If you like foie gras- make sure you order the foie gras sushi  it's the bomb. \nPork belly with kimchi apples- what flavors.  I know it does not sound good- popcorn Brussels sprout- I'm not a fan of Brussels sprouts but this is amazing.  \nI recommend getting the Omikase or sitting by the bar and ask the chef to give you their specials. By the way, make sure you make room for desserts- one of the best in town."

            "review": "Ordered the Omakase for two and based on my personal experience 3 stars is being generous.\n\nI was looking forward to a Japanese Fusion dinner and was definitely keeping an open mind.  I'm not very experienced with fusion so I knew there would be some interesting items.\n\nOverall there were some items that were good and some items that were off (totally off, as in the Flying Fish and the Ahi).  \n\nThe flying fish tasted fishy as did the ahi.  So bad, I brought it up to the server and she mentioned that's how the Japanese fish is supposed to taste.  Well if this is true, it's not for me. \n\nInitially I expressed my desire to order thier top selling items along with what would appeal to my pal n myself.  They reassured us the Omakase would give us a real opportunity to taste the essence of this spot by providing some of the menu highlights.  \n\nSo we took the word of our friendly server.  Perhaps it was an off night because I wasn't really impressed.  Not once did I have that \"wow this is good\" moment - when enjoying a solid meal.  Even the very popular Salmon and Orange dish was just okay.  If I had to pick the best tasting item the pork belly was the real standout, seasoned and cooked perfectly."

We  actually made reservations with them at the last minute when our other reservations at another Japanese restaurant fell through and they accommodated nicely. We're so glad to have found this place! We had a group of 5 and had the omakase 11 course meal and let me tell you.. It was delicious! We were all so satisfied and happy. Service was also very good. We'll definitely be back. Thanks Yonaka for a great experience! We'll definitely be back."

            "review": "I'm far from a sushi expert or sushi snob, but this was one of the best sushi places I've visited in a very long time, or at least as far as I can remember. I've had my fair share of decent to expensive sushi in Tokyo, and this place blew me away with their creativity as well as the quality of their fish. In fact, I loved it so much, I returned the next day for round two. I must add, that it is VERY rare for me to go to a restaurant two days in a row. \n\nIt's nice to take advantage of the happy hour deals and also order the regular menu items to truly embrace the Yonaka experience. \n\nBluepoint oysters ceviche- 5 stars. The oysters themselves are not the ultimate best, but the fixings inside as a ceviche really complemented he oysters well. \n\nNegitoro (HH)- 7/5 stars. This is what got me to return. The tuna belly melts in your mouth. It is amaaaaaaaazing. \n\nYellowtail nigiri- 5 stars. Awesome fish to rice ratio. You might be thinking it's pricey, but it's so worth it in my opinion. The quality of hamachi was perfection to me. \n\nSaba nigiri- 5 stars. I ordered it after watching the sushi chef immersing the Saba in a vinegar liquid. \n\nSalmon belly nigiri- 5 stars. Maaaaaaaan get in mah bellyyyyyyy! Melts in your mouth. Definite score over their regular salmon. \n\nUni nigiri- 5 stars. If you want to get a good overload of awesome quality uni in your mouth, this is the way to go. It has a crispy quinoa on top which was really odd to me since I thought I was eating shell bits for a second. I'd pick this over the other uni dishes. It is a bit pricey at $5/piece but so worth it! \n\nLipa roll (HH) - 3 stars. When you go to a sushi place with high quality ingredients, ordering a roll is probably a crime. I committed one with this dish, as the spicy tuna totally drained out the fish flavor, and tempura was okay.\n\nSpicy tuna crunchy hand roll (HH) - 2 stars. I love spicy tuna, but again, at a place like this, it is such a waste to drown the flavor of high quality ingredients with a ton of spicy stuff. Save it for the AYCE sushi joints. \n\nSaba shioyaki (HH) - 3 stars. Nice, great, and cooked well. \n\nSake orange (or shall I say SHAKE orange)- 3.5 stars. I thought this was okay, even though it is one of their most popular items. \n\nUni to ikura and scallops- 4 stars. This was very good but due to personal preference of not liking raw scallops and grapes in the dish, I have one star down. The uni and ikura combo was amazing. \n\nCrispy Brussel sprouts (HH)- 5 stars. This is a must-try item. They were crispy and had a balsamic glaze that added a nice hint of sweetness to the dish. \n\nKaraage (HH)- 2 stars. The least favorite of the group. The chicken is soggy from the sauce, and I also didn't like the breading at all. It reminded me of a pre-fried chicken that was reheated in a microwave (soggy).\n\nTea-braised pork ribs (HH)- 2 stars. I wasn't liking the flavor or the texture of this dish. The flavor was a bit strange for my palate, and the meat almost tasted overcooked and a couple days old. It wasn't falling off the bone as some other reviewers have described and had a rather tough, chewy texture. \n\nYellowtail midori- 3.5 stars. This is a great dish with fusion flavors. I personally love the taste of yellowtail on its own, and the citrus sauce was overpowering, taking away from the essence of yellowtail flavor. \n\nService was impeccable, ambiance is nice, but not too formal. \nThe next time I return, I will be sticking to the nigiri's in addition to the brussels sprouts. \n\nThanks Yonaka, you've turned my sushi brain on big time. I'll be on my quest for the best high grade sushi in town. And I sure can't go back to an AYCE sushi place anymore because I'd rather spend my money on higher quality than quantity."

Their sushi were very fresh and the staff were really nice but their sushi lacked taste and everything tasted very raw. They did introduce that to us when we got there so that was nice! The place is neat and clean and im giving 4 stars because I had better tasting sushi for my tastebuds. I would only go back to this place because of my girlfriend."

            "review": "A great twist to sushi. I went here with my mom and her friends and we ordered a lot of things. \n\nI'll try to remember all of them.\n\nThe crispy brussel sprouts (5/5) were amazing! You HAVE to try it! It had this tangy sauce that accompanied it -- so delicious! \n\nThe Bluepoint Oysters Ceviche (5/5) was yummy due to the sauce. The oyster were good quality.\n\nThe cilantro hamachi (2/5) was okay. The overall dish was overpowered by the cilantro and was very bland. \n\nThe Salmon belly nigiri (4/5) was delicious. The belly melts in your mouth. Yum.\n\nYellowtail nigiri- 5 stars. Awesome fish to rice ratio. You might be thinking it's pricey, but it's so worth it in my opinion. The quality of hamachi was perfection to me. \n\n\nUni nigiri (5/5) was top quality and very good. It's a little gritty because of the quinoa which I found odd and my mom thought it was sand, but it was still really good.\n\nSake orenji (4/5) was good. I enjoyed the garnish and the sauce combined well with the salmon. \n\nThe crudo-seabass (3/5) was okay. The sea-bass itself was good but when combined with everything else in the dish, it didn't palette well. \n \nThe persimmon and scallops (3/5) were pretty good. I liked the crunchiness of the persimmon but I felt the sauce was mild.\n\nWe also Wagyu Ishiyashi (3/5) where we could cook the beef on hot rocks. It wasn't bad, but I felt the rocks weren't hot enough to cook all of the beef. We did ask for another hot rock, but it still wasn't hot enough to get a good sear.\n\nI enjoyed the palette cleansers which were melon pops.\n\nFor dessert we had the warm strawberry milk (2/5) and cookies. It's okay, but I'm not crazy about this dessert.   \n\nMango coconut dessert (4/5) was versatile. I liked everything else but the main part of the dessert. \n\nOverall, the food was good but only for once every blue moon. Maybe I enjoy regular sushi too much. Some of the dish pairings worked and some did not. I thought it was very pricey for the dishes. The fish were very high quality though. The waiters were prompt, attentive, and knew the menu well and answered all of our questions exceptionally. I enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. Some people dress really well, but you don't need to."

            "review": "We tried Yonaka after we couldn't get a reservation at Raku for 9 people. They were very accommodating. When we arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday the restaurant was only about half full. The waiter was very attentive and we ordered drinks and some starter dishes to share: the crispy brussel sprouts, shiyoyaki Saba, hamachi Kama, and the mushroom wakame which was a soup. We ordered three of each for 9 people. The brussel sprouts were amazing. The hamachi Kama was a bigger portion but the mackerel was also good. We also tried one order of the meat candy which melted in your mouth. Originally we had also ordered a few orders of the buta shishito but they must have forgotten it and when we reminded the waiter at the end he only brought one. This was actually a pretty good sized portion though and very spicy. \n\nWe all ordered our own sushi and though I didn't have any sashimi, others in the party ordered the omakase and loved it. The rest of us ordered shrimp tempura, midnight, and spider rolls and though good, they weren't anything special. \n\nThey brought out a mango dessert that was delicious for a birthday in the party which was very nice. My only complaint was that as the night went on the restaurant got a lot busier and the waiter didn't come by nearly often enough. We ordered our cold and hot dishes almost immediately and ordered the sushi about 20 minutes later and the dinner took about 2 1/2 hours. It's nice to get the dishes staggered so we don't have a ton of plates building up but everyone seemed to get their sushi at different times and the rolls seemed to take the longest. The waiter did apologize that they only had two sushi chefs working. \n\nOverall very good food. Make sure you have time to enjoy it all."

We had a party of 10, which I know is always difficult for servers. However, I ordered the Midori Salad, and I did not get it until at least 1.5 hours later. Everyone else at my table received their food way before I did, even though they ordered more complex dishes, such as the chef's omakase sashimi. \n\nI really do not understand why it took so long to get me the salad - after 3/4 of the table received their food (which came inconsistently as well), I asked about the status of the salad, and they told me that I should get it within a couple minutes. My friends had to ask two more times before someone came to say that it will be the next thing the kitchen works on.  I received my salad the same time we got the check, when literally everyone else was already done with their food.  Food was good, portions were quite small for the price, but service leaves much to be desired."

Even Ray Charles can see why Christina and Arvin seem to be glued to this place. \n\nMy phone's been acting up so i couldnt really take picture or make notes of what i ordered so going off of memory as best as i can.\n\n - Brussels Sprouts \nSlowly but surely i'm starting to see these micro cabbages pop up at more and more places which isnt a bad thing if cooked properly. Does Yonaka Modern Japanese know how to prepare and serve brussels sprouts? You bet your sweet ass they do!\n\n- something something oysters\neh...cant remember the name possibly due to the fact that it was written in romanized japanese. Fresh oysters and quite refreshing with the yuzu and pickled shallots\n\n- Fresh Uni\nI traded an oyster for a piece of Uni. I've had fresh like 10 minute ago the uni was in the ocean talking about pointy politics with it's other pointy uni friends before it was ripped from the ocean and thrown on the table just to be hacked open with a knife and hungry people going fingers deep to get it's buttery orange flesh. Anyway the shell is still suppose to move a bit even after you hack it open and all the ones that were served werent moving no more. They probably shocked it or read it parts of Twilight to get it to stop moving. Regardless...question is: Was it fresh? Answer: Yup!\n\n- Seasonal Sorbets\nWow..i can not for the life of me remember anything else...i know there were others but for the life of me i cant remember wtf we ate...I was given 3 flavors: Passion Fruit, Granny Smith Apple, Blood Orange. I should have just got as much Passion Fruit as i could get my hands on without being charged extra because it was the best one in my opinion. Blood orange came second, It was either Yuhi or Anthony but i agree that Blood Oranges arent exactly something i like. Pretty sure it was Yuhi now. But yeah Blood oranges have this bitter sourness to it kinda like grapefruit. The sorbet did a great job adding some MUCH needed sweetness to this otherwise bitter and sour fruit. The granny smith did nothing for me. Thought it was too tart. \n\nEh....i'll write a better review next time. Not to self bring note pad next time.\n\nYelp 100 - 013 of 100"

            "review": "3.5 stars but because the value and presentation is good; I rounded up. \n\nWe had reservations right at opening (5pm). It was completely quiet in the restaurant, even as it slowly filled over the night. Music would make it feel a little more jolly.\n\nWe sat at the counter and ordered a few rounds of sake. $3 for each serving, so we had two hot and two cold servings. The chilled sake was served in a great glass decanter with room for ice in the middle. Beautiful and functional. \n\nThe chirashi dish had generous servings of tuna, salmon and flounder (?). The homemade soy sauce added flavor but not too much salt.\n\nThe barracuda nigiri was new for me and was quite tasty! And mackerel and I go way back so I had the Saba Shio, which didn't disappoint. The tuna roll and and tobiko pieces too were good, but I did eat something that I can only describe as silly. A foie gras sandwich was served with a poached egg and soy sauce on the side. The sandwich contained a sweet custard which overpowered everything else. You can skip this and won't miss it. \n\nChicken wings were good, but the foie gras on skewers fell flat. The outside was not seared to the point of caramelization, and was undercooked on one of the pieces and very gland-like. Eek. \n\nWe finished with the chocolate 10 ways: tofu mousse, Nutella, ice cream..if you like chocolate, it's good. \n\nIf I want a casual bite of sushi, this place is good for that. When I made the reservation a few days ago, they asked me if it was a special occasion and I said that my friends were celebrating their anniversary. They said that they do something special at the end of the meal. The meal finished without the mysterious special treatment, but that's okay. At least I didn't tell them about it and get their expectations set."

This is exactly where Yonaka lies.  \nI was in town for a normal debaucherous/degenerate weekend trip in vegas and decided to venture off the strip to try out Yonaka.  It is definitely better if you have your own car (rented or driven from LA) but still worth a cab ride for some modern Japanese cuisine.\nOur group of 6 tried the large omakase (11 course) and the smaller omakase (8 course) and it was a unique roller coaster of dishes that constantly had us guessing the flavor profiles of sauces and the techniques of dishes.\nIt was pretty cool.  \nOverall, there were many notes of citrus that were surprisingly well matched with the fish.  However, the fish itself could have been fresher.  Some of the presentation was nice and whimsical... others looked like a train wreck.  But the good at this place, definitely outweighs the bad.  \nSo if you are a frequent Vegas visitor, it is definitely a nice breath of fresh air from the normal places on the strip."

My favorites were the spicy grilled edamame and some kind of salmon/orange slice creation that I'm still dreaming about.  The staff was attentive and helpful, and the marketing manager even came over and explained the concept behind the restaurant.

It's almost like they're trying too hard to be a hip Japanese restaurant. The biggest example of this was their  compressed watermelon with the frozen grape (compliments of the chef). It looked really good but failed to deliver on taste. If they let the natural flavor of the watermelon and grape come through, it might have had a chance, but instead they drowned it in this salty brine that made it taste like it was spoiled. We ordered family style, but again nothing stood out. The best thing  we ate was their salmon that they drowned in yuzu and the grilled edemame."

No, I'm inside a (beautiful) hole-in-the-wall in a confined strip-mall on West Flamingo next to a McDonalds and a tattoo shop. \n\nThe courses arrived in decent intervals.

My best explanation is a photo paired with a detailed caption. I usually don't need to say anything else. The presentation and methodical usage of ingredients elevates itself from other Japanese and fusion establishments and has become a category of its own. So, what is Yonaka? A place that will intrigue your tastebuds and incite conversation of excitement and surprise.\n\nI've had the pleasure to try many dishes during my multiple visits. I wish I could write about all of them! I really enjoy the items that involve sashimi or other raw seafood and feature a wonderful balance of sweet and savory elements and textures. The dishes truly heighten the different flavors of the sea creatures and such an experience than your typical sashimi. The menu is impressive and ever-changing. Simply the list of ingredients will intrigue you and the best part is they keep some of it a surprise (although they are happy to share the details).\n\nSake Orenji ($11): Scottish Salmon sashimi, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, lemon and orange oil, maldon, and micro arugula. The sauce is their take on Ponzu and it is delicious. This is a great example of the sweet and savory balance. I've had this dish during every visit and the salmon is always so succulent.\n\nNana Iro ($13): Hamachi sashimi, grapefruit supreme, avocado, golden cherry tomato, pickled fennel, dehydrated fennel, and chili sauce. I'm already a big fan of raw yellowtail, but I really dig this combination of flavors. Highlights: the non-tart grapefruit and dehydrated fennel.\n\nTea Brined Ribs ($10; HH $7): Pork ribs, citrus-honey-tea glaze, sesame seeds, topped with negi. These ribs are on-point. Flavorful and the meat falls right off the bone! I love the fresh negi with every bite.\n\nTate Ichigo ($13): Hokkaido sea scallops, fresh strawberry, negi, apricot and strawberry relish, hibiscus salt, Thai chili, negi oil, and strawberry sauce. I love the soft texture of the raw scallops with the sweet and juicy strawberry slices. You get just a little bit of heat at the end as well.\n\nMango Cotta ($8): Mango panna cotta filled with mango pur\u00e9e, pistachio butter, crumbled pistachio, mango ice cream, and mango tuile. One of my favorite desserts, ever! The panna cotta has the perfect consistency and even with the pur\u00e9e, it isn't too sweet. The pistachio marries well with the mango and all the textures make it fun.\n\nAlthough these are my favorites, I've enjoyed mostly everything. I really like the Foie Gras Nigiri, Yoshoku, Avocado Nigiri, and Crudo as well (to name a few), however, I'm not a big fan of the Tsutsumi, Buko Jam, or Tuna Tataki. The Specials Menu ensures that you don't tire of dishes and also highlight seasonal ingredients. The Happy Hour Menu (Daily 5PM-6:30PM, M-Th 10:30PM-12:00AM, F-Su 11PM-2AM) also features items not available on the Regular Menu like the delicious Hana Wings.\n\nHelpful notes: Bring a couple friends and share several dishes since most are perfect for 3-4 people. Most importantly, this is not a place to dine and dash. As I'm sure you've seen the photos, the dishes are intricate and obviously take time to prepare. Heed the warnings and don't visit while in a hurry! I usually allot two hours and it's given me enough time to really enjoy the meal and my company. Reservations can be made via OpenTable or phone. Happy Hour is offered at the bar and booth area only and not available for reservation. The bar is a great place to sit to watch the chefs at work! It's mesmerizing. This isn't your typical sushi bar, so orders are placed with your server. Also, I haven't tried the Omakase since I was fortunate to visit with seasoned patrons, however, it's a great way to try their popular dishes and not worry about what to order. Lastly, this is a place to leave your preconceptions at the door. Don't let the ingredients or combinations intimidate you and just go for it."

The place was easy to find, quiet and the food was absolutely amazing.  If you are looking for the normal rolls, they have a few, but their off the beaten path combinations of flavors in all of their outside the norm dishes will knock your socks off.  Don't be afraid to try something new.  The wait staff was phenomenal...so friendly and informative.  And do NOT forget to save room for dessert.... Such amazing taste combinations!!!  One thing to note... If you're a big eater and looking for big portions, this is not the place.  The food presentation is beautiful as well.  Give them a try... You will not be disappointed!!"

Our food never came out because apparently they were too busy to even drop off one sushi item!  How long do u have to wait for a couple pieces of sushi? We were there for a good 40 min and still nothing. And nothing was about to come out either after asking and asking. Are u kidding me? Customers who came in after us to sit at the bar were chowing down on food so I have no idea what the problem was. Asking the waiters and waitresses was like asking each other. Nobody knew how long it would take. When the workers avoid you, you know there's a problem.  And the answer to why it was taking so long was \"oh we're really busy!\" Yeah, they're  the only restaurant that gets busy.  That's the excuse? So I think this place got rave reviews maybe as long as you can eat something otherwise don't bother going on an empty stomach because you'll be leaving hungry still. Second time ever that I had to walk out of a restaurant!  Totally unacceptable."

            "review": "My review will strictly be on what I ordered:\n\nCoconut Ceviche - The idea of a coconut broth and tuna at first glance was not too appealing, but this was definitely one of those \"try it before you say something\" dishes.  Very refreshing with big cubes of tuna, fresh tomato, fennel, etc.  The dish overall made sense and I would recommend this.\n\nSushi Omakase 5 piece - I ordered 2 of these, requesting all different fish and while they were all sushi grade, fresh, firm, and withheld a nice temperature, I would have preferred my sushi WITHOUT the garnishes.  Understandably their aim is a modern twist on Japanese cuisine, however in my own preference, this dining experience made me realize I like my sushi with rice done well under a fresh piece of fish.  \n\nSake Avo - The waitress suggested this and while it was visually appealing, the flavors weren't to my favor.  The salmon was firm, fresh, and tasty, however the avocado puree was extremely salty.  The citrus gelee was a fun addition, texturally.\n\nIshiyaki Wagyu - This was one of those dishes where I asked myself, \"why in the world did I order this\".  As familiar as I am with American Wagyu & true Japanese Wagyu & true Japanese Kobe, this meat tasted nothing more than a piece of thick-cut brisket.  There was no \"wagyu\" flavor... Even with the ponzo and mushroom sauce, it was a bland piece of meat.  \n\nAmuse - This palette cleaner wasn't too appealing to me.  Because the flavors were so COMPLEX, my palette felt overwhelmed.  I would have preferred a light citrus, sorbet perhaps.. maybe even something so simple as a roasted fig.  \n\nOVERALL:  I respect this place for being so bold and taking a modern twist on japanese cuisine, however I feel like this place has a few more steps to take to get there.  While every dish was ok, they didn't have that \"wow I would come back here\" factor.\n\nLike I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!"

            "review": "Service is a plus. The interior looks great. I've had the same server for both of the times that I've went so far. He goes over the menu for a brief 5-mins intro of their selections and categories. He speaks highly of their happy hour menu, quoting as \"one of the very best\" because they take their most popular items and make them cheaper for HH :0). \n\nI'll list all the dishes I've gotten on my 2 visits (all HH except for the fatty tuna) and what ones I wouldn't mind getting again. \n\nBeet Fries $5\n-- I'm not really a fan of beet fries so this did not stick out to me, but whatever the sauce is, that was pretty yum.\n\nSake Orenji $7\n-- Delish! I got it both times. There's a nice kick to it and I like the touch of the oranges with it.\n\nLipa Roll $7\n-- Pretty standard tasting in terms of a roll.\nNegihama Roll $5\n-- Yellowtail with scallions and that was pretty decent.\nNegitoro Roll $7\n-- Bluefin tuna toro with scallions. Decent.\nCrunchy spicy tuna hand roll $5\n-- Nothing special really. Might wanna add your own wasabi.\n\nChuka buns $7\n-- It's got pork belly, green apple, cilantro, jalapeno, shallots, black lime, and kimchee puree. It reminds me of the Great Bao buns and it's not too shabby, but I wouldn't be begging for it.\n\nKaraage $5\n-- Surprisingly decent. I guess I got used to the lame ones at those ramen places.\n\nGyu Sliders $7\n-- Double no. It was bland and tasted quite plain. I ended up dipping it in the sauce from the beet fries and that made it taste less bland, lol. Don't recommend this one personally.\n\nFatty Tuna Nigiri $5 apiece\n-- If you're the type that likes your fish-on-rice plain and simple, then you might not like how they add seasonings and shiz on it. I liked it, though :0).\n\nI'll be back to try a few of the other things that I missed from their Happy Hour menu as well as try some daily specials fish (sashimi) another time :0). Happy Hour is from 5-630pm and 11pm-2am daily. They open from 5pm-2am daily."

There were previous complaints concerning the pacing of dishes, but we experienced none of these issues.   The restaurant manager personally stopped by our table and took the time to explain the concept of dishes and the flow of the restaurant.\n\nDishes had were the following:  \n\nSangria Sake (5 Stars) - i dare You to find a better Sangr\u00eda.  It was unique in its flavoring and the sake kick was a crisp flavor explosion.  The best thing was the left over fruit in the craft.  It was an unexpected dessert-like treat.\n\nCrispy Brussels sprouts (3 1/2 stars) - lite and crispy, but a little too oily.  Try it if you've never had gourmet brussel sprouts.  You will be presently surprised!\n\nSake Orenji - (5 stars) FAT pieces of sashimi style salmon!  Very good.  I'll have this every time i return back.\n\nIshiyaki (5+++ stars!) - wagu beef strips that you cook yourself at the table via a hot stone.  I wanted three more orders ASAP if I wasn't full from the meal.  \n\nSome kind of yellow tail sushi roll - (2 stars). - I forgot what it was.  Unforgettable.  \n\nAvo Hanimu - 4 star- a chocolate (fudge???) type bar.

So had it on the radar then hearing more and more great reviews, oh my GOD the pictures get posted looked phenomenal, and even done too the decor. Friday night asian persuasion decided check it out on recommendation of the duke and duchess of Yonaka. Mahalos too Arvin and Christina. The place from the minute you step in blows you away with the interior design. The walls with wood whatever but really modern retro look, the tables (even have slot too hold the menu on the side of the table; REALLY now if that not modern what is?) and booths too chairs really nice and comfy, and the sushi bar although we Mel C, Terri R, and I sat on table look really nice. Jus the whole look of the restaurant looks like fine dining see on the strip but think Yonaka free standing restaurant is impressive too say the least.\n\nIt doesn't with the decor but from the service our servers was the best started with Ashley and then Michael. They both were extremely knowledgable about the menu made some great recommendations that we all had and some ran out of room but UYE Duke and Duchess get the rest in!! The attention too detail was top notch constantly checking up but at the right times. Just super friendly staff that makes the evening experience that much more fun. The management very much present asking us questions and also giving us great recommendations (pointing out the specials of the day chalkboard; I miss I walk in really blown away by the decor). Never empty glass on our table. \n\nThe Happy Hour forget the booze for food! Yonaka takes Happy Hour food too another level!! This stigma that cheaper price food. Yonaka is artwork on plate or even say picasso on plate. Seriously the amount of detail put into every dish HH or regular menu there is no difference. Refreshing. The prices are very reasonable for HH not just one or two things few things on the menu most under $10. The regular menu not so bad. I keep thinking that eating at fine dining establishment on the strip but yet got the bill not even close. \n\nThe food gosh we just about order the kitchen sink and more. I did have the benefit of Mel and Terri on lent. LOL! I got whole karaage for myself! It was really good. I like the fact that not deep fried more saute and the sweet chili something type glaze combine with jalapenos and onions was awesome, The edamame was solid. I fan of ones not just boiled but saute or this case grilled get so much more flavor in every bite. The spicy tuna rolls not that spicy at all but loved it! Three per order for HH. Brussel Sprouts everyone raves about that staple everyone should get every visit. It refreshing dish. It just vegetables but still so good. I love the sauce served in or more vinaigrette. Soft shell crab was solid. I found it interesting that not come with wasabi or ginger (had too ask). It was tasty and liked maybe the chef was bored but spelled Yonaka on the plate! Yellow tail was really good. We had mixed berry that was good. I sure missed couple but everything was awesome! If not been too Yonaka yelpers need too GO!!!"

Our dinner for two actually could have fed four very hungry people -- the serving size for each dish is very generous. I have been to several of the most popular or so-called \"best\" Japanese/sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, and Yonaka is every bit as good as, of not better than, Raku, Kabuto, and Nobu, and it definitely is better than Zin of Japan -- (not meaning to demean or be negative toward any of those 4 fine Japanese restaurants, because I consider all of them to be excellent). Moreover, Yonaka is far (repeat, FAR) less expensive than Raku, Kabuto, Nobu, and Zin of Japan.  I would highly recommend this exceptions Japanese restaurant. You will not be sorry you ate there."

            "review": "Yonaka Modern Japanese is a pretty modern place; their omakase was similar, more of a modern flare for small plates to share rather than all sashimi. \n\nWe chose the omakase 8 course for $101, which was a good amount for two people to share.\n\nCrispy Brussel Sprouts\n- If brussel sprouts were prepared this way all the time, we'd eat them more often! I loved how some of them were cooked/dehydrated a little more because the taste and flavor was amazing. \n\nSake Infused Scottish Salmon\n- I was hesitant about the sake, but the salmon was marinated pretty well. The sauce actually tasted more salty than boozy. \n\nSea-bass with Komodo Tomatoes\n- The fish was delicious and the Komodo tomatoes weren't bad either (first time having them)\n\nMeat Candy\n- This was twice cooked pork belly with kimchi salad. The pork belly was sweeter than I prefer. The kimchi salad was made with slices of apple instead of daikon, very creative!\n\nNiku Berry\n- The server presented it as a type of beef, but it tasted like duck to us. There wasn't anything special about this dish.\n\nSeabass with creme fresh/cauliflower\n- The seabass was ok, but the creme fresh and cauliflower pur\u00e9e was a little on the bland side. \n\nDessert\n- I can't even begin how to describe all of the different pieces of the dessert dish!! The strawberry ice cream had a hint of basil, my favorite part.\n\nOverall, this is a nice place to try for non-traditional Japanese food. If you love tapas/small plates style dishes, but with a Japanese flare, this might be the right place for you. If you are a purist, probably not. \n\n\nYelp 100 challenge - 41 of 100"

I absolutely loved it and only wish we had another couple to share dinner with, so we could have ordered the 11 course.  \n\nPork belly, wagyu beef, skewers of grilled tuna, mint & basil watermelon and more...don't overthink this.

As for the food, the presentation to every dish was great and the taste was amazing! I enjoyed the warm custard--it was a wonderful surprise to have a clam in the dish! The waiter we had was very nice & I wish I remembered all the names of the food I tried but there's one where you sear your own meat on a hot stone that you are given in this clay like pot and then you would dip it in the sauce---Oh so yummy! The yellow tail collar dish was also a delight! The Brussels sprouts were crunchy & tasty. I wish there was more I could tell you but you've got to check this place out! I would give this place a 5 star rating but because parking can be a challenge, I recommend getting there early & making reservations ahead of time. And to Jackie: Thank you so much for letting us be one of your first customers to dine here! What a great treat! We will be back:) Much success to this great new treasure for more Yelpers to discover! God Bless!"

            "review": "I usually don't do reviews on sushi establishments, but I had to do one for Yonaka.  I stopped craving sushi for over a year because the whole AYCE sushi craze got really boring.  The whole quality vs. quantity philosophy plays a big part with this establishment.  Yonaka has actually made it fun and exciting to sit down and eat! EYE LIKA!!!\n\nSo Mikey C. Elite brings me here.  Was kind of reluctant to eat sushi, but I went along.  I was so thankful afterwards.  First off, I was surprised to see no soy sauce on the tables.  Weird.  I totally understood why after my face was stuffed.  The tapas that they serve have all these different ingredaments that when combined, gave off an everlasting impression with my palette.  Mind boggling was what was going through my mind.  I'm not even going to mention what my favorite plates are.  Just find out for yourself and be adventurous. That's going to be the fun factor when you eat here.  I admit there was one plate that I wasn't a fan of which had an edamame puree for its base, but I think they took that off of their daily special menu, which change from time to time. \n\nNow back to the whole quality vs. quantity philosophy.  In my last feeding, I was talked into eating uni.  From a FEW bad experiences from a few AYCE restaurants, I stopped trying uni.  I'm not a big fan of uni, but DAMN THEIRS IS EXQUISITE!!!  Adding that to my menu in my gut.  Another item which I'm not a fan of is raw salmon.  I tend to stay away from it whenever I'm eating sushi.  Salmon was my favorite item on their menu!  Who would have thought that salmon would go so amazingly well with something citrusy!?! GREAT EXECUTION with the salmon guys! HIGH FIVE!!! \n\nIn the end of my last feeding, I was fortunate enough to shoot the shit with our waiter.  He wasn't trying to BS us on what was good on the menu.  I could see and feel his genuine passion for the establishment where he was working in.  Pretty much the cat said to just start on the first 5 on their menu and keep going down the line to experience the art that these amazing chefs have to offer. \n\nEYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"

Creative food, ultra helpful and friendly staff, and great flavor combinations as well as texture variety.\n\nHidden away on Flamingo and Decatur next to an unknown hair salon.  I had bookmarked this place away a month back and had forgotten about it until I saw some recent check-ins.  Decided I should go check this place out with the wife during the late night happy-hour.  Arrived around 12 with only one other table in the dining room.  The decor is very modern, but being dark wood-based, not museum like.  \n\nList of our food for the evening:\n\n* Amuse bouche - what?  Since when do you get amuse course at a non-fine-dining place?  Blood orange slices with yuzu and some candied quinoa.  Very tasty starter.  Little did we know we were in for more flavors and textures!\n\n* Anago (fried eel with sweet potatoe chips) - Probably the \"least\" flavorful dish of the night, but the star of the plate was the egg salad \"dressing\".  Puts a nice creamy texture onto the fried eel.  \n\n* Sake Orenji - If there was a signature dish to the place, I'd say this is it.  From the looks of the photo album, it seems everyone ordered this.  So we tried it and oh-man, was it amazing.  The trick to this dish is to pile a little of everything onto an orange and salmon slice, and eat it all at once.  The usual overbearing taste of salmon was somewhat masked by the orange slices and lemon oil's acidity, and the yuzu tobiko puts a sweet crunch into the bite.  \n\n* Konpa - similar to the Sake Orenji, except that we had more hamachi than salmon.  The crisp of the bellpeppers with a little twinge of spice from the jalape\u00f1os makes this dish a great starter, as it whets your appetite for more.  We inhaled this dish under a minute, I swear.\n\n* Sashimi - uni and hamachi, both served with similar presentation.  Server had mentioned that they had \"live\" uni yesterday and we just missed out, so it almost made it a let-down to get our dish.  But, you could still taste the freshness in the uni, as there's no \"aftertaste\" that you'd get in bad servings of sea urchin.  The candied quinoa puts a crunch into the creaminess of the uni.  Great!  The yellowtail, on the other hand, was mostly dry except for a dab of japanese miso sauce.  However, eating it with some radish, the full flavors of the hamachi was brought out.  Very tasty indeed!\n\n* Agemaki - Decided that we should have at least ONE roll.  The california roll with snow crab looked enticing, but we settled on this one instead.  Served with baby yellowtail, a tiny slice of avocado and thai basil, slightly fried in tempura batter.  Yuzu kosho and hoisin sauce for dip.  Ultimately, another roll; however, the flavor of the fish was enhanced by the yuzu kosho, and the slightly crunchy texture of the tempura with the ultra tender fish was sublime.  I had no idea that hamachi could be so creamy.\n\n* Kudamono - Intermezzo for your mouth.  Mixture of daily fresh fruits of the chef's choosing.  Tonight we got berries with granny smith apple, topped with a homemade fish broth and basil strips.  Eh, fish broth on fruit?  Amazingly enough, you don't get any fish taste...instead you get ultra flavorful fruit, which washes your mouth clean of all prior fish!\n\n* Ishiyaki, wagyu beef - THE most interesting presentation for beef tataki I have ever seen, as you sear it yourself on a hot stone.  The beef is on a separate platter, doused in olive oil and salt/pepper.  You then take the beef, put it on the hot stone for a count of 2 or 3 (each side), and dip into either a ponzu or mushroom sauce.  Both are very flavorful, but I found that just the beef by itself was enough.  ULTRA tender slices that just melt in your mouth.  This and the Sake Orenji are two must tries if you decide to visit!\n\n* Iraho (i think, forget the name) - salmon and white fish with heirloom tomatoes, candied quinoa, asian pears, serrano peppers, and mizuna leaf.  Lemon oil and yuzu complete the sauce.  This dish was similar to the konpa, except that the serrano pepper lends a spicier dish, which is cooled by the asian pear.  Again, mouth full of flavor along with good texture (recurring theme).\n\n* Oysters! - We were full, but looked through the menu one last time and spotted fresh oysters on the daily specials list.  The wife is a sucker for oysters, so we had to give it a go - I don't eat raw oysters, so can't really comment.  But considering that she said it was the most amazing sauce she's ever had on raw oysters, I'm going to assume they were good. :)\n\n* Ringo Lico - The manager touted this as her favorite dessert, so we had to give it a go.  Plate full of random bits and the game is to find the best combination of goodies. ;)  The pistachio butter is what really stands out - freshly made in house with roasted pistachios - really really flavorful.\n\nGreat place to check out if you like flavorful food with a creative twist."

What an incredible find this was! \n\nAfter an emotionally and physically exhausting MDW we were left in a coma-like state by the hotel pool, waiting for our late flight out of McCarran to hurry up so we could. just. go. home.... Fortunately, in our vegetative state we turned to Yelp for something a little nicer than the usual crap served up in overpriced hotel restaurants and disgusting food courts. This turned out to be an incredibly stroke of luck, as we stumbled across Yonaka Modern Japanese; a very highly reviewed (and surprisingly inexpensive) Japanese restaurant that was walking distance from our hotel (Palms Place)- oh and Happy Hour starts in an hour (5pm)! Woo!\n\nWe arrive at 5pm on the dot, looking a little disheveled after the not-so-pleasant walk in the heat (turns out 'walking distance' after a long weekend in Vegas isn't the same as 'walking distance' any other time- if you're reading this... just get the cab). \n\nWe were greeted immediately by a lovely lady who sat us, and began explaining the menu. We ordered waters, and before we knew it a warm towel had arrived for both of us- a really nice touch and much needed after that brutal walk! Having already scouted several 'OMG THAT LOOKS INCREDIBLE' dishes in the photos section of their Yelp page, we knew exactly what direction we were headed. Within minutes of placing the order, a complementary aperitif had arrived at our table - a small bowl of sliced apple with Japanese spices. Very simple, very clean, little palate awaken-er that got the meal started off in a really pleasing way. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n1. KARAAGE - fried chicken, jalapeno, mint, basil, onion 6\nDELICIOUS. Perfect appetizer-sized portion and a light flavorful rendition of a classic. Could easily have eaten several bowls. Utterly addictive. \n\n2. SAKE ORENJI - salmon, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, orange oil, maldon 11\nIt's always a good sign when your server gets visibly excited when you order an item - it's like they know it's an absolute slam dunk, and thus they can't wait for you to try it. Wow is all I can say. One of the most exceptionally composed and executed flavor profiles I've ever tasted. Just wow. A true 10/10 dish that would be at home on ANY fine dining Japanese menu in the world.\n\n3. HAMACHI MIDORI- yellowtail, cucumber, avocado, fried yucca chips, green herb dressing and negi oil 14. Gorgeous plating- really breathtaking presentation. A very light, refreshing, dish that was a nice contrast to the big bold flavors of the Karaage/Orenji. The chips offered a nice crunchy counter point, although I'd say overall this combination was missing another element to put it over the edge. Still delicious.\n\n4. TEA BRINED RIBS - pork ribs, citrus-honey-tea glaze, sesame 11\nAt this point, we were both full up and should probably have thrown in the towel and got the check. However, inspired by what we had already tasted, I insisted we rally and make space for one last offering. Our jaws dropped to the floor when these ribs arrived at the table for two reasons: a) holy **** that's a lot of food! 4 huge ribs stacked b) holy **** they look divine. And wow, they did not disappoint! The ribs were PERFECTLY cooked. I like my ribs to be just one notch below 'fall off the bone', so that you can take a decent bite without pulling ALL the meat off the bone and getting it everywhere! These ribs had a sweet glazed outer layer that soon gave way to sublimely tender and flavorful pork rib meat. The sauce wasn't what I was expecting (perhaps a little too sweet without too much of a savory after-note to balance), but it was still a very successful and satisfying end to our meal.\n\nPlating and Presentation: 5/5\nIngredient quality and freshness: 5/5\nFlavors profiles and general composition: 4.5/5\nService: 5/5\nPrice: 5/5 (for this level of dining, this is remarkably affordable. + great Happy Hour!!!)\n\nWill absolutely be back and will absolutely be ordering the 11 course Chef Tasting Menu."

Yonaka delivers in all aspects from ambiance, location, service, presentation, and of course the food.  This has been bookmarked ever since I read Cathy L's review in January.  Also, the current Duke of Yonaka aka Arvin C and his beautiful wife C-Dub also recommended this place to us.  So it's set.  Me, Sugi, and T-Elite changed our original Friday night plans and headed here for dinner.  Best decision we made all week.  Yonaka is legit!!!\n\n-Food:  I enjoyed every dish that I had and when it comes to freshness, Yonaka is the \"Duke of Freshness\".  Their fish is even delivered straight from Japan.  I had their Horse Mackerel Nigiri, Yellow Tail Nigiri, Yellow Tail Hamachi, Yellow Tail Shashimi, Spicy Tuna Hand Roll, Asparagus w/rice crisp & spicy mustard, and their Spider Roll.  Come to think of it, this is a lot of food that I just ate for about $30.  Every dish is prepared and presented like a piece of art.  You have to check out the pictures to know exactly what I'm talking about. I don't think a review does the food any justice.  You just have to come by and check them out for yourself. \n\n-Service:  Woohoo! As good as it gets!  Jax and Tiffany were great.  Jax came to our table and explained everything to us, the history, about the food, etc.  Jax is such a darling.  How often do you go to a restaurant where the staff shakes your hand and introduces themselves to you?  Think about it for a second.  Here, they do exactly that. We even had two servers (Ashley and Mike) and they were both attentive.  One thing they do here at Yonaka is that they serve each of your dishes one at a time.  This means no crowded table full of empty plates and no food confusion.  I think they watch when you're about done with one of your dishes, then serve the next one.  Perfect timing here and I love it.  When we were done eating, Jax gave us her number so we can spread the word. I guess she knew we were all very satisfied. \n\nSo many positives about this place.  Here's another one...it's close to the strip for you out of towners.  I think I could go broke eating here, but not because it's expensive. The prices are fair here.  I think I'd go broke because I could eat everything on this menu.  \n\nPS:  Yonaka...Can't wait!!!"

Small parking lot but enough spaces next to it in front of salon and in back as well. \n\nDecor is beautiful, looks like jenga blocks on the wall, tables and chairs are comfortable and nice. \n\nOne of the best dishes i have ever tried in any restaurant was the uni and scallop dish. Raw scallop on the bottom, uni on top of that, ikura, baby micro greens = omg i could eat that dish every night of my life. If you don't like uni, you are a clown and need to get the heck out of here.\n\nMeat candy was pork belly, it was sweet and savory, and perfectly cooked. It was fatty and delicious. The kim chee apples and onions could not have been seasoned more perfect.\n\nBrussel sprouts = fried with lemon chili which was perfect amount of tartness and spice, and included something they called puffed rice, it tasted like the chinese chips that you get with peking duck in chinatown.\n\nHad the tartare trio, maguro was good with shiso leaf, sake was amazing with ikura, and hamachi was nice with a good spice from the jalape\u00f1o.\n\nSushi was good but wouldn't waste my time, small plate place might as well stick with what they are good at.\n\nAny place with orion beer = awesome\n\nService is decent, not great, could have been a little more attentive but seemed busy at the time. The manager was quite friendly though and they were all knowledgable about the food\n\n$ was a little pricey but worth it and i will def go again soon.\n\nif waking up this morning and still thinking about the food last night is any indication of me having a good time then, your welcome"

Our wait staff were knowledgable and very excited to hear it was our first time visiting.  Our main waitress explained the concept of Japanese with a modern twist and smaller plates/tapas style.   \n\nWe started with grilled edamame and crispy Brussels sprouts...amazing.  Not a bite left.  Next we order Meat candy( pork belly), SAKE ORENJI\nscottish salmon, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, orange oil, Maldon, ISHIYAKI \"sear it yourself\" on hot stones, lemon salt ponzu, mushroom sauce, wagyu beef & sea scallops, spider roll, and fois gras.  PARTY IN MY MOUTH amazing!!!! Half way thru serving us our order, the waitress popped by with tiny melon pops to clear our palate.  So yummy.   We ended our dinner with Choco 10 ways and French presses coffee.  I plan on becoming a regular and feel lucky to have had such a simple yet wonder dining experience!!"

We had a toro dish with freeze dried cherries and walnuts - out of this world. The sake orenji (salmon with orange slices in a citrus sauce) was well received by my lunch mate. However since I am not a fan of salmon, I passed. Also served was tuna, yellow tail and scallop sashimi which was very fresh!  We cooked some wagging beef on a stone and had it with some ponzu dipping sauce. Just melted in my mouth.  Lastly we hade shoulder of amber jack in a light curry and coconut sauce. Wow!

            "review": "I first went here with a large group for a Yelp event and really enjoyed the uniqueness of the food. I liked the yellowtail collar and the presentation of it on a board. I didn't like the compressed watermelon with fish sauce. I think fish sauce has its place and I wouldn't say its with fruit. The waiters knew their stuff and took the time to explain each dish. Service was great for a big group and the food kept coming. Let's just say It made me want to come back for more after my first experience.\n\nThe second time was just today and it was for happy hour. I'm not sure if something was off or we ordered the wrong things, but I was disappointed in some ways. Granted I've been eating paleo and have been eating very mild food so everything here was bursting with extreme flavors and some were not good. Everything mentioned below was from the happy hour menu.\n\n The tuna hand roll- great presentation with orchid flower. Simple and tasty, I ordered two. No soy sauce or ginger offered, too embarrassed to ask but wondering of that's normal? 4 stars \n\nshort ribs- fall off the bone good. 5 stars\n\nAsian bacon- pork belly looked dry when they brought it out but it was moist. It sat on a bed of salad which was completely soaked in fish sauce. The pork belly was delightful but the fish sauce soaked salad underneath was overboard fishy taste. 5 stars for pork belly 2 stars for fishy salad \n\nTuna ceviche- I love tuna I love ceviche I love coconut I love tomatoes I love strawberries but put them all together and you have one disgusting mix. It was not edible in my opinion. I forced myself to eat it because it was $7 and I'm a real cheap ass.  I don't know what that sauce is that its soaked in but I couldn't event taste the tuna!! It was completely overpowered by the coconut \"sauce\" at the bottom of the dish. Gross. Negative stars\n\nKaraage chicken- I can't say I've ever had a bad karaage until I came here. How can you screw this up? I'm so confused. It was soaked in sweet chili sauce and had tons of onions sliced. Who wants to eat large slices of chili soaked onions. The sauce again was overpowering. Negative stars\n\nSake orenji- one of my favorites here, perfect blend of flavors! 5 stars but no longer on the happy hour menu\n\nBrussel sprouts- I've been dreaming of these brussel sprouts. They were very oily today and not oily the first time I had them, usually 5 stars, today minus a star for the pool of oil ;(\n\nBeet fries- love the presentation in the cute basket! Nice dipping sauce. Sadly I love beets and love fries but it tasted like warm pure beets. I didn't get much of a breading or a fries taste. 3 stars you better really like the taste of pure beets. \n\nI still am curious to give it another try based on my good first experience here but I'm not sure what to order. It's been hit or miss for me. \n\n5 stars for first time and 3 stars this time making it 4 stars."

Due to the size of our party, I got to experience several of the dishes on the menu.  I would say that about half were very good, and the remaining were well below par.  They either hit it out of the park or struck out on each dish.  The dishes that failed were not properly balanced (either too salty, too tart, or too sweet).  The restaurant seemed to be well staffed, however the service was incredibly slow.  Our dinner lasted 3.5 hours, which was insane.  For a better sushi experience (and much more reasonably priced) I would recommend either Pier 215 or SOHO.  If you are going to try Yonaka, keep your party small and keep you expectations in check.

All our dishes were beautiful and composed with finesse. There is a deliberate effort made to incorporate citrus and fresh micro greens in many of the plates, so the overall menu has a lightness and especially brightness you won't find in many \"sushi\" joints. The square quotes point to the fact that, for some depressing reason, the owners decided to jump on the horse flogging bandwagon and refer to their dishes as \"tapas.\" Dear future restaurant owners, for the love of all that is holy can we please let go of this \"tapas\" fixation?! Sushi is the original tapas. No need to call it \"sushi tapas\"--it's redundant! That is the restaurant's major downfall, the urge to make trend and style it's leading concerns. I can hear the original concept tumbling into place: \"hey man, let's do a sushi place, but \"tapas style\" and with a California color palette.\" \"Yeah man, dig, right on.\" The execution, however,  is to be applauded. Some of our dishes were first rate, especially the yellowtail collar with (just slightly bitter) preserved lemons. There is a level of obnoxious pretense threatening to eclipse the quality of the food here, and draw in the kind of fickle crowd that will bounce onto the next hip \"tapas style\" whatever. Here's hoping the kitchen can get out of its own way and prepare the kind of food that doesn't need to wear a costume. Give me great ingredients prepared with confidence. Leave the yoga pant selfies for the strip limo crowd."

Yonaka did an impeccable job of bringing new flavors to traditional Japanese foods, incorporating fresh ingredients from around the world. \n\nWe tried the ten course tasting menu, ordering two sets for our table of six and were not disappointed!  Each dish was impeccable in taste and presentation. The meal built perfectly, nothing was too heavy so we could enjoy every course. The flavors were all unique, with combinations like Hokkaido scallops with strawberries, black pepper, and cilantro. Who knew how delicious that could taste?!!  Even the simple starter, watermelon with fish sauce and mint~ was perfect in taste and timing. The unique taste grabbed our attention and got us psyched to try whatever was coming next. There was blue fin tuna, yucca and kale chips, red radishes, grilled potatoes, delicate sauces all craftily combined for perfect bites. We had unique sashimi, flying fish included! All great. \n\nBy the 8th course, we were definitely getting full. The 9th course was a dashi/rice/egg/stew kinda delicious concoction, that easily filled up anyone who was somehow still hungry.  And the desserts were pieces of art (we had two different types, with many delightful combinations on each plate-- mango mousse and coconut, strawberry mint ice cream, green tea brownie, strawberry chocolate milk.... YUM). It wasn't too sweet, which our indulged bellies appreciated. \n\nThe decor is simple and elegant, service was timely, friendly, and each dish was explained thoroughly (a tough task with all those ingredients and courses)!\n\nAlso, the fresh ginger ale was perfect and helped me digest all the amazing food Yonaka served up!!

It came highly recommended by our server so we went with that. She highly recommended the lobster as well, so we ordered it in addition to our meal. \n\nFirst to arrive to the table were:\n\nA tangy tomato aperitif. Juicy plump and ripe cherry tomatoes with a punch of citrusy flavor. An excellent palate cleanser that got my appetite pining for the next dish. \n\nCrispy Brussel sprouts\nLemon chili, mint, and puffed rice \nOmg, I thought I tried every variation of brussel sprouts already but this has got to be my favorite! The textures of the crispy brussel sprout leaves were light and airy, while the lemon chili dressing perked up my taste buds with a surprisingly zesty sweet tang. A must if you dine here! \n\nSake orenji\nScottish salmon, orange supreme, Yuzu tobiko, orange oil\nButtery soft slices of fresh salmon soaking in a lip smacking orange yuzu oil and mixed with slices of fresh orange that gave each bite a pop of bright acidity. The yuzu tobiko caviar added just the right amount of saltiness to balance out this Droolworthy  dish. \n\nSakana Crudo\nAn artfully arranged plate of fatty tuna with fresh lemongrass, crispy fried shallots, cucumber bunches, fresh mint and spicy Jalapeno Slices. A dish that will excite your taste buds as well as whet your appetite. \n\nHamachi Midori\nYellowtail, cucumber avocado, fried yucca chips, green herb dressing and negi oil. A delightfully refreshing dish that was beautifully plated. That being said, it was almost too immaculate to eat, well almost. \n\nWhite eye flounder sushi with mint was spectacular. The flesh was supple and melted in my mouth. The mint added a refreshing contrast in flavors as well to this exhilarating piece of sublime sushi \n\nNext up was the lobster with fennel bathing in a sumptuous lobster emulsion with freshly baked housemade chuka buns. I found myself sopping up every bit of that delectable sauce with my warm pillow-y soft rolls and the buttery lobster made for an irresistibly indulgent experience bite after the bite \n\nMeat Candy\nTwice cooked caramel glazed pork belly, crispy kimchi apples chunks, cilantro\nWith a name like meat candy i was expecting a sweet decadent dish but this was just ok for me.\n \nWagyu\nGrilled wagyu short rib with bell pepper relish, leek-sweet onion pur\u00e9e dehydrated Caramelized onion\nBeautifully marbled chunks of wagyu premium beef will melt like butter in your mouth. Sumptuously decadent and infinitely satisfying.\nFor dessert we enjoyed a whimsically delicious warm strawberry soup. It made me feel like a kid again! The green tea and strawberry mint ice cream were luscious and delightful and the green tea brownie coupled with candied almond semi fredo made for an extraordinary mouthfeel and fantastic textural experience. \nWe had warm friendly service from Marcy who gladly provided some wonderful recommendations that made the evening's experience truly unforgettable!\n\nThanks for a divine omakase, I can't wait to come back and sample more of the chef's inspiring dishes!\n\nHappyeats"

Many of their dishes are tapas style with hot/cold plates and sushi. Our waiter was very courteous and explained the menu to us. He emphasized that their specialties are their cold plates.\n\nWhile I prefer traditional Japanese sushi, I do appreciate their concept of incorporating complementing ingredients into their dishes. We started out with a watermelon salad on the house. The waiter wanted us to get a taste of how their sauces merry with the dishes. We then went with the waiter's recommendation and ordered the Crispy Brussel Sprouts and Sake Orenji. The brussel sprouts tasted great, but it's also a dish that's difficult to mess up. I do like how they incorporated puffed rice to add some crunch into the dish. The Sake Orenji was one of my favorites and one of their most popular dishes. The salmon and orange flavor was a great palate cleanser. Another highlight was the sashimi omakase.\n\nJust a note they don't serve liquor, but they have wine and beers as well as an extensive sake selection."

Even bad service I can sit back and chuckle about, but the end of this meal had me in awe.  We went here after work one night, not too late though.  I think they are open till 2 and wen went in at 11.  We were promptly seated and greeted.  Everything went great.  The food was great, it was paced out, we were not in a hurry so we were happy waiting a few minutes between courses.  Our server seemed knowledgable.  She checked in occasionally and had some good suggestions.  \n\nAll seemed to be going great.  When we were on our last course, with food still on our table, she came by and asked if we had decided on dessert yet.  Well, that's a little early to ask that when we don't even have a dessert menu in front of us and we are still eating our entree.  We said we were still eating and we weren't ready yet.  When we were done, a busser cleared our food.  We figured out that the dessert menu was on the regular menu which was in a drawer beneath the table.  So we pulled it out and she immediately came back and asked us again if we were ready.  We told her we needed a minute.  \n\nThat was the last we saw of her.\n\nAfter ten minutes, she had not come back, I even tried to wave down a manager, who ignored me.  I finally got up, went to the bar area where they were all hanging out and asked if we could order desserts.  The manager came over to take our dessert order.  The dessert came out, still no check backs.  About the time the dessert is delivered I see our server sit down at the bar with her friend.  They both have beer in front of them and start having food put in front of them.  Now my blood starts to boil a little bit.  We finish our desserts, while I have to stare at our server sitting down to a good time.  \n\nAfter about 10 more minutes I go up to the bar again.  The manager is behind the bar, the server is still sitting there.  I ask if we can have our check and the server looks at the manager and says, \"can you get her check.\"  What kind of restaurant do you run where your staff gets to drink and eat instead of doing their duties, and not only that but bosses around management to do their job.  I cannot even fathom how this is acceptable at this restaurant.  So the manager brings us our check, and I\"m still fuming, he apologizes for me having to get up and says he took care of our dessert.  I'm still fuming.  He comes back with our credit card and gives me a coupon for a free appetizer next time I'm in.\n\nThe server literally never came back to our table.  News flash...I will never go back in to redeem my \"free appetizer\" coupon.  \n\nAs I said, the food was amazing, it's a nice place and I know a ton of people have had great experiences here.  I was so offended by how I was treated, I will continue to tell people this story.  Any place that allows their staff to behave this way clearly is not run well."

My friends Nelson and Sylvia took us to Yonaka for happy hour and they did not steer us wrong. I'm from Hawaii where we have a plethora of Japanese cuisine and Yonaka certainly holds its own.\n\nHighlights were:\n\nBrussel sprouts: Order them and then write me a thank you letter. I enjoy beautiful stationary and $100 bills.\n\nAvocado nigiri: I've never really cared for avocados but somehow they really worked as nigiri sushi. The creaminess of the avocado just explodes in your mouth.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of other dishes but quite honestly my brain exploded from the pure bliss I experienced and I basically blacked out. It was that good folks. I do recall though that service was excellent and the modern, clean decor is great for a first date or gathering of friends. Happy hour is definitely the way to go and we left stuffed for just $20 each once we split the bill. Just a few minutes off of the strip and a great way to eat like a local on a budget! Do it, do it NOW!!!"

Three hours later and still reeling in the liquids and solids.

My friend was too busy enjoying to bother his eating groove-on. I only remember the name because it was recommended more than once on the menu.

The mushroom soup was also very delicious and flavorful. The spicy tuna was good and the spicy aioli that was on the plate had an unexpected heat that I enjoyed. The food here is not the problem. \n\nUnfortunately, it took an extremely long time to get served. I recommend if you are hungry and/or thirsty, order multiple plates and drinks because it will be a long time before you see your server. After I ordered a couple of dishes and a beer, I finished and ordered more (it took approximately 45 minutes for the server to resurface). The sushi came out right away. The beer took some time and I finished my water waiting for the refill. Water was never refilled. Beer finally came after I finished my sushi. The other plate I ordered never came out. When the server finally came back around, he asked if there was anything else I needed? I reminded him of the missing dish. When it finally came out, the order was wrong. I requested he just take it back and hand me my bill, which he tried to charge me for but gave me no problem when asked to remove it, which took another 20 min.\n\nHe kept apologizing that his mind was elsewhere, but the place was not busy (only 5 tables were full). Maybe it really was a bad night for the guy, but the service was just unacceptable. The worst I've had since moving here. I spent a total of 2 hours there to get an appetizer, a bowl of soup and a sushi roll. Since my beer and water stayed empty the majority of the time, you can imagine how bored I was waiting around. I assume it isn't always like this or the place would have been out of business a while ago.\n\nI'd like to come back and try other dishes, I just hope a different guy is the server."

From their unique menu items with interesting flavor combinations and quality ingredients, to the amazing ethereal desserts and service. Instant favorite that left me and my group hastily planning our next visit. \n\nWe ordered a lot of our plates according to our servers suggestions, and they did not disappoint. We had a variety of items to share and go around, and all in all everything was great. The Crispy Brussel sprouts with lemon chili, mint, and puffed riced packed a fairly unexpected pop of tangy flavor and texture. So different and such a wonderful play on a veggie dish. The Tar Tar trio with salmon, yellowtail and tuna with cassava chips was tasty. The tar tar itself was a little more minced than expected but it still allowed the flavors of each fish to be distinct and delicious on its own. The Asian pork belly with papaya salad was acidic, sweet, and salty. Tried not to let any of it go to waste.\n\nOur desserts absolutely sealed the deal. To be honest, Id come back solely for dessert. We had the \"Greenies\" and a chocolate dessert, that was equally phenomenal. The Greenies came with an amazing green tea and chocolate brownie, green tea semifreddo and a lot of other unique components. A warm strawberry white chocolate accompanied and pulled everything together. The other dessert consisted of chocolate mousse, with beet ice cream and cocoa nibs. What I loved about each dessert was that they were not overly sweet, in fact incorporated flavors of savoriness and salt, and had many complexities with depth and subtlety. \n\nService was the best I have received in a while. Professional and sophisticated but still humorous, light and personable about their food. The layout and timing of the meal was also the best I've never had. So very impressed with this establishment and look optimistically forward to future visits."

The serving sizes are much more generous than other \"tapas\" type restaurants. \n\nI ordered the karaage ($5) & the coconut ceviche ($7.) The chicken was sweet and spicy - as in spicy from the fresh jalapeno slices dispersed throughout. It was so good that I tried to recreate it in my kitchen today for lunch. Definitely a must have. \n\nThe ceviche was good, but I prefered to just eat all the stuff in it as the \"soup\" portion was a little tangy/bitter. The amount of fish in it was incredible. Definitely a good deal. \n\nI got to try some brussle sprouts that everyone was ordering. YES. Ummmm... Yes x100. These were delicious. \n\nWith tip and tax I spent a tad under $15. Not a bad deal.

Our server also explained the menu, including some of the new and popular dishes. We ordered our drinks (a white wine and green tea), which arrived promptly. The rest of the service for the night was great, everyone was attentive with check ins and drink refills (for the green tea) and always made sure we weren't wanting for drinks.\n\nThe one tiny demerit point is that when there wasn't anything for the servers or kitchen staff to do, they would gather around the bar for a chit chat. I'm not opposed to a friendly work environment, but having 4-6 staff gathering at the edge of the bar in plain sight of the customers just seemed to be off. Again, this is a tiny tiny demerit point, since they WERE attentive and prompt with service.\n\n== Food ==\nThe omakase was well paced. It was also a lot more food than I had anticipated. We had an extra starter course, compliments of the chef, which is always a nice surprise. The omakase consisted of an appetizer of brussels sprouts, 3 cold dishes, 3 warm dishes and a dessert.\n\nThe one thing that is consistent through all 8 dishes is that the sauces were amazing. As in, lick-the-plate amazing.\n\nAnother minor demerit point, and I'm not even sure if it's a food-category demerit, or even demerit worthy, is that because the sauces were so amazing, I often wanted a spoon to scoop it up with. Admittedly, I could have just asked for a spoon.\n\nI don't think I could pick a single favorite dish from the 8 course omakase. Overall, it was well balanced.\n\n== Ambiance ==\nThere was only 2 other tables when we arrived. At the end, there was about 6 tables, including us. It was quiet, but not uncomfortably so. We could carry on a conversation in normal voices without feeling like we were being too loud.\n\nThe decor is calming and modern. There's options of table seating or bar seating.\n\n== Summary ==\nGreat food, good service, good ambiance. Will be back for the 11 course omakase!"

The service was top notch from the kind greeting at the door to attentive service at the table.  This isn't one of those 'all workers greet the new customers' place.  The hostess greets you at the door which is much more personable then the \"everyone yell greet\".  I don't believe any item on the tasting menu is on the regular menu.  But, we did order three things off the regular menu: Anago, Brussel Sprouts, fried beets, and karrage.  So, by rights, if we count the omakse complimentary fruit, my table had 14 courses.\n\nItems on the menu...The brussel sprouts were a hit; everyone loved and raved about them.  Fried beets where unique.  Never had them before.  Not sure if beets can be cooked to be crispy like fries, but these were not that crispy but tasted great. I didn't taste the Anago, but everyone said it was great.  Karrage was good too.  \n\nFrom the omakase, what standed out to me was: raw oyster, this salmon dish that had pears and candied quinoa and serrano chilie slices.  I took the serrano off but there was just enough heat left in the sauce that made it tolerable for me.  This was my favorate dish in the omakase.  Other notables were the wagyu and yellowtail collar.  \n\nOverall, we had a lot of great food here.  Look forward to coming back to try more things off the menu.  There are a lot of yelp pictures to help me decide what I want next time."

We were lucky enough to try a dish that the chef had been working on that day. I am not a huge fan of mackerel, but it was fantastic. Paired with huckleberry compote, blackened citrus salt, onions, and frois gras sauteed mushrooms, it made for a splendid dish. I would happily order it again. That was still not enough. An order of the bay scallop fritters were necessary. One order comes with two large pieces. The light batter had a nice bite and did not feel greasy at all.\n\nAt this point, I have had almost everything on the happy hour menu.

Yonaka is in the same category as Nobu or Raku but Yonaka is much, much cheaper for the same- if not better- quality food and service. I've been back a few times (forgot to check in sometimes, but whatever) and it's been phenomenal every time since I know \"what to order\" now :).\n\nFor New Years, my family and I ordered a plethora of food and drinks and thoroughly enjoyed MOST of it. We even ordered some of them twice because once isn't enough when your taste buds are dancing. The sake orenji alone could probably be your entree (if you wanted a light meal) and you will be satiated and happy- FOR $11! \n\nI had the pleasure of visiting Yonaka again when I attended CES. I went for lunch and wanted to taste their popular lunchtime omakase. That day, it was a light salad appetizer with feta, apples, and ahi. I also ordered the hand roll trio. The entree was chicken in a creamy mushroom sauce and a side of wasabi mashed potatoes. \n\nI'm not super picky, but out of the handful of things I hate to eat, mushrooms and wasabi are two of them. Our waiter laughed and told us he hates wasabi too, but the wasabi is very light (and he was absolutely right- I'm so glad I didn't pass on this dish). As for the mushrooms, I got them on the side and I gave them to my friend to munch on :). The salad and entree were fantastic. The dessert was a coffee pudding/jelly mystical, magical, deliciousness. My friend and I LOVED it and asked if we came back for dinner, can they save two for us. The pastry chef actually came out to talk to us and thank us for liking the dessert so much! And you know what- they did save us the dessert and we did come back for dinner the same day to enjoy their food (and that coffee dessert) again. Scrumptious, I tell you.\n\nAs for the things that I would pass on, I have two. The \"Meat Candy\" dish sounds so delicious on the menu but the pieces were too large and not juicy nor buttery for being pork belly. I expect pork belly to melt when it touches your tongue and it took so many chews to get it down. The kimchi is comes with is very good and unique, though! Next is \"Uni to Ikura\" (sea urchin and salmon roe). I like uni. I like salmon roe. But there's just something about this dish that didn't work for me or my family. The texture of everything together (as recommended) is just, for lack of better words, kinda icky. \n\nNevertheless, the majority of Yonaka's menu is phenomenal and unique. The service here is outstanding, friendly, and accommodating. Yonaka is easily one of Vegas's best restaurants."

There was 4 of us and having that many, we were able to try out more dishes.  I definitely want to return for this infamous happy hour. \n\nAs soon as you walk in, the ambiance is relaxing and hip.  We tried a variety of things.  A list of goodness that entered my belly:  Wagyu Beet, Ibushi Hamachi, Crudo, Uni to Ikura, Toro Sashimi, Foie Gras Nigiri, Crispy Brussel Sprouts, and a few more dishes I'm sure I'm missing.  \n\nI saw Foie Gras Nigiri, my eyes went bug eye and I literally was drooling when it arrived.  I devoured it and the Mmmm sounds came out without hesitation.  You know, everything that we ate was EXCELLENT.  Its kind of like tapa style, but the portions are more than enough to share.  With the 4 of us, we left satisfied.  The dishes yes are fusion, but not so crazy fusion where the natural flavors are ruined.  In fact, that's what makes these dishes so great.  They really emphasize on using real natural flavors to their dishes.  Like candied quinoa, fresh fruit, or dehydrated fruit, or vegetables, that give the fish or meat added flavor.  \n\nIt was a great overall experience, a bit on the pricier side but a MUST try.  My mother-in-law and I drink lots of tea, we did however find ourselves asking for tea refills often.  Either need to give bigger cups for the tea, or allow us to have the tea pot.  The Only suggestion.  Staff was great and inviting.  I am a fan!"

The crispy brussel sprouts & sake orenji were good. I also liked the kurobuta pork belly, very tender with perfect crispiness. The other stuff was not bad, but not good either. Uni & scallops in the \"uni to ikura\" dish didn't taste particularly sweet. I think the biggest fail was the rice of the sushi (we got 5-piece omakase). It was cold & hard, which kind of ruined it cuz I thought the fish part of it was decent.\n\nAmbiance n presentation n service lived up to hype, but I care more about the actual taste & quality of the foooood."

And every time I try something new, I find something else I want to order every time I go. Service is always friendly and efficient, too.

I asked one server what the \"super dry\" asahi was, and rather than bs his way through an explanation he ran back behind the counter to ask someone more well-versed and came back with the full scientific classification of a super dry beer (LOL). Slightly unnecessary but appreciated. \n\nthe food did not disappoint, I had hamachi chili, which had a generous slices of yellowtail in a chili soup reduction thing with pickled cucumber and fried onions on top. the mackeral (3$) was decent for the price. \n\nI knocked over our bottle of sake and the ice spilled out of it.  The waiter came back and was like, no worries, i'll replace it. ( i thought he meant the ice) he comes back with a full nother bottle of sake (ours was almost gone) minutes later he comes back with another bottle of sake (complimentary for my roomies bday). Later he returns with two shots of the best sake they had, and did a shot with my roommate, again celebrating her birthday.  Finally, after we did the celebratory midnight drink, they came out with an elaborate plate of some sort of mango coconut concotion with mango ice cream. \n\nAll of the sushi was fresh, interest, and retained the integrity of the fish. Great service.  the waiters recommended dishes that I sincerely believed they enjoyed and did not try to push anything on is. WIll return."

I'm going to break this review down to 3 sections: 1) Service 2) Food Quality 3) Price.\n\nService: The waitress we had was very very knowledgeable about the menu and everything that came with it. She was very nice and observing as to when to refill our drinks and what not. She recommended some amazing dishes to us and brought us some complimentary chef appetizers which was pretty darn good! The only gripe I would have against the service was that we had random servers serving us at random times but that's not really a gripe, more like they were busy. The manager actually came out to serve us too. We witnessed the quality expectation of the chefs directly when the manager sent someones dish back to the kitchen because it didn't look neat enough. Props to them for maintaining that quality effort. \n\nFood: The food itself tasted pretty darn delicious. I was surprised. We ordered a 8 course Omakase dinner for my girlfriend and I. That pretty much means chef's selection of what to serve us. I believe we got 3 appetizers, 2 sashimi's, and 2 hot dishes, and a dessert. The sashimi was fresh, the appetizers were full of flavors, and the hot dishes were to die for. After all that, the dessert was  full on blast. We were so full from the meal itself, it was a struggle to finish the dessert. Definitely a gem in Vegas and just barely off the strip.\n\nPrice: This part is the best really, $50 Omakase dinner (per person). This is outrageously cheap for the quality and service that this place serves you. This dinner we had in the bay would definitely run close to $80+. With the friendliness of the waitress, the quality of the food, and the nice ambiance, this place deserves a 5 star and more. \n\nI'd definitely come back when i'm in vegas again. Can't really go wrong here.\n\nTips:\n1) Get the Omakase.\n2) Watch the chefs work the magic\n3) Enjoy some delicious sushi!"

Every course was delicious and each omakase served 3-4 people. From fresh salmon, blue fin tuna, yellow tail tuna, sushi rolls, roasted brussel sprouts, wagyu kebabs, and even lobster which came with the most delicious home made rolls to sop of the broth. Shocking to get this quality of meal for such a reasonable price. \n\nWe can tell that this was definitely a local's spot and I honestly wouldn't have known about it if a local friend hadnt recommended it to us. They really aim to please here. A friend ordered a mixed drink which she didnt like and a new drink was offered promptly to replace it. We loved our server Charlie!

I decided to find the most popular sushi places on yelp. I took my fianc\u00e9 for dinner here for his birthday last night while we're in town, and everything was amazing. \nI ordered: karage? (It's the chicken)\nPork belly\nSpider roll\nCalamari\nTea brined pork rib\nSpicy tuna\nSalmon in Orange sauce ( I forgot the name)\n\n\nI would suggest trying everything on menu. The fish was soooo fresh. I loved the little appetizers and Popsicles they give you during your meal. It was so delicious. It was one of those meals where it is so memorable, that you cannot forget the wonderful taste in your mouth.( okay I'm drooling right now) anyways, The service was excellent! The asian girl that served us was super sweet. They definitely need to give her a raise or something because I literally see her as the only waitress that took orders for most of the tables. She did an amazing job. I will come back with my family and friends next time I'm in town."

I'm open to new things and I liked the idea of what they are doing but the execution was a little lacking. We ordered 4 dishes. \n\nA yellowtail sashimi dish with grapefruit and avocado, probably the best dish we had. Although the yellowtail was cut very thick. It was 5 thick pieces when it could have been 10 thin pieces. \n\nA seared beef dish that was mostly rare, I forgot the extra components that were on there but they were minimal. This dish had kind of a funky taste to it and it seemed like the \"sauce\" that it was in  partly blood from the rare beef. It didn't gross us out or anything but it certainly wasn't appealing. \n\nWe ordered a special, a candied pork belly dish that was very good. But honestly if you mess up pork belly you shouldn't be in the business. \n\nAnd last we got a cooked beef  dish with strawberries, fennel, mushroom, and a fried egg pur\u00e9e. It was extremely hard to believe that with all those components this dish was absolutely flavorless. I mean none. We didn't even eat more than one bite. It didn't taste bad, which I guess is a good thing, but it literally tasted like nothing. \n\nBased on how much I liked the food I honestly would have given this place a  lower score but I like what they are attempting to do and the food quality was actually very good as well. Maybe there are better dishes on the menu or maybe they will tweak a few things since they are still relatively new"

I thought the flavor combinations were a little ambitions and overall successful. \n\nEverything was great. The atmosphere is a little tighter and more sophisticated than, say, Ichiza. For the portion sizes, the prices are a little higher than Ichiza as well. But for the quality and preparation of the food, for the type of service and ambiance, the prices are just right. \n\nI liked that the sushi menu listed the fish and place of origin. Most of the sushi in the world indeed does not come from Japan. \n\nThey frequently rotate out the specials. \n\n#offthestrip #noncasino"

I wish we had just gone to a regular sushi restaurant with fresher fish and a more authentic feel. Fusion just isn't for us. To top it off, the service was extremely slow. There were only 4 occupied tables, a few people at the bar and two servers. After our meal was done, we were asked if we wanted to look at the dessert menu. The server never came back. We sat there for 20 minutes and then had to flag down the server to ask for the bill. We won't be coming back. 3 stars for food, 1 star for service."

Maybe the best $8.00 you will spend in your life, if you live forever. The grape cocktail with it only makes it even better, as if that were possible.\nUnfortunately, this wasn't the only thing I ordered. I started with asparagus with a sauce vierge. Not bad, but really, bar food (see Raku) instead of high end restaurant food. After the awesome grape salad, I ordered the pork belly. Now pork is to my taste buds the summit of Japanese cuisine. There is no better food in Japan than the tonkatsu at Maisen in Tokyo. Forget Sushi, this is the food for food lovers, food worshipers, those who really care what goes in their mouths. The pork belly I thought would come from the same back ground of pork reverence. Alas, was not the case. I sent it back hurriedly. \nThe waitress, who had hustled me into ordering sake (don't go there) instead of the infinitely more appropriate grape cocktail, hustled me again to order the lobster. She failed. One is constantly hustled as one walks down the strip, or through any hotel. One hopes to escape such relentless annoyance by going to a good restaurant. Not this one. But go there for the grape salad. Even if you live on another planet, it's worth the trip."

I'd recommend if your visiting; always nice to explore and see what's out there instead of staying ordinary cause that's just BORING. You don't want to be that guy/girl.\n\nWith that being said I would like to bring this up...\nme and a friend had an Indian food funner \"I'm not being racist\" don't know If he was new to the restaurant or not but he had no idea what was in some of the dishes for example; what type of fish it was, what sauce it was dressed In, the vegetables to compliment the dish. I knew for a fact what type of fish  it was but I let him explain the dish before I ask questions. He then told me it was scallop sashimi... idiot it's red snapper, then told me there was all kinds of veggies on the plate. WHAT A MAROON! \n\nAfter I corrected him they switched of food runners that actually knew what he was talking about lol which was kinda nice. No need for being a pain in the arse.

Yonaka has diminished it's ability to deliver quality and value expected from their projected image.\n\nFirst, they were out of a sake offering from the menu.  Either re-print the menu or strike it out from the list.  And we polished off two bottles of the substitute, so we're not stingy.  I'm annoyed with this trend - 2 in 1 night - restaurants with beverage offerings that are \"out of stock\".  Baloney!\n\nSecond, the order of delivery of the dishes should be as presented to the waiter.  Edamame, sashimi and sushi - in that order.  Not the reverse, which is how the dishes came out.  I also fear the edamame was of the frozen variety.  Hey, guys and gals, we can get that dish at Costco.\n\nThird, don't tell me the \"sushi chef is not taking special orders\".  It's not like he or she was asked for milk-fed yak rolled in Alaskan salmon roe.  Is a spicy salmon skin roll too exotic?\n\nThe search for a cozy, suitably-priced sushi bar in Las Vegas continues.

The day before, I got the opportunity to try Soho Japanese restaurant for the first time, so I had super high expectations. I heard this place was more of an upscale, modern take at a sushi joint, so I was pretty excited!\n\nThis joint is located in a pretty weird strip mall close to Flamingo and Decatur. The inside, though, is completely different. Such a gorgeous setting! Dark wooden floors, aesthetically beautiful wooden designs on the wall, dim lighting and an open kitchen. The interior design work is elegant and high end! When we sat, we were greeted with warm wet towels for our hands and a plate of yellow beets and strawberries. Our server was Naomi and she was definitely sweet and accommodating. The server assistant was just as accommodating. At the end of our evening, we were greeted by Janice, the restaurant manager. She was by far, the most personable employee! I really enjoyed her presence and energy. I really think highly of businesses who have managers humble enough to converse with guests. Awesome! For dinner, here's what I got:\n\nHamachi/Yellowtail sashimi platter for $11. This is probably the best deal of the day! 5 very thick slices of hamachi on a plate. The fish was super fresh, not a lot of fishy flavor. Those sashimi cuts were on point! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish!\n\nMiso soup for $3. This soup was definitely strong on the miso side. It was really salty but didn't hurt the overall experience at all.\n\nHamachi/Yellowtail nigiri for $2.50 per nigiri. Another fresh pick! The hamachi was topped with a jalapeno miso sauce and micro cilantro which definitely enhanced the overall taste. \n\nHamachi kama for $10. Whenever I visit sushi joints, I always get this dish. Love yellowtail, love the fact that it's grilled and love that it's super flaky yet very marbleized and flavorful.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my time there! This place really takes the time to showcase their love for food. From the garnishes to the side dishes, to the main course, this place focuses on serving great food and aesthetically pleasing dishes. I highly recommend this place for a date night or catching up with friends. Such a great experience, one that will keep me coming back for a long time!"

A complimentary plate of Asian pear, apples and lemon oil between courses proved to be refreshing while a pair of white chocolate ganaches concluded the meal. Each dish was skillfully prepared using the freshest of ingredients and beautifully plated with commensurate service.  A shoutout is extended to the Brussel sprouts and calamari for being the best in class. Yonaka is included as one of the 50 Essential Restaurants in the 2016 edition of Eating Las Vegas."

My husband had never been, and I  kept raving about it....so we decided to meet up with some friends for their late night happy hour.\nI have nothing bad to say, my husband isn't even a big fan of fish and he was astonished at how fresh and delicious it was. We shared the Crudo and Sake Orenji...he loved both. Complimentary taste of the Watermelon with Tuna, sweet and delicious, again Doug was shocked. We got some meat dishes as well just in case he wasn't a fan of the fish, but it wasn't an issue...Tea Brined Pork Ribs and Chuka Buns (Doug still talks about these). The Grilled Edamame really has that grilled smokey taste...wow! \nEveryone of the staff makes you feel welcomed and taken care of.\n\nI will never turn down an offer to go have a bite here, everything is a delight to the eyes as well as the taste buds."

My date actually couldn't get enough of the signature salmon sashimi with orange sauce... We both agreed to get a second order! :-) Yes, it's deliciously addicting!\n\nAs for service - personal touches by Rob (our awesome server) and Jax (marketing manager) for birthday and anniversary dual celebrations in Vegas, made very memorable!!!\n\nI can see why locals would want to keep this restaurant a tiny little secret, as its off the beat and path from the main strip. Located in the new strip mall corner (tucked closest to Palms Hotel), it can be easy to miss unless you are a local, or in the know...\n\nFantastic value (especially with some happy hour choices), unparalleled signature dishes, with superb quality, freshness, presentation - for the discerning palette. So very memorable, and left us craving more, melting in the mouth sashimi. Will be a must - everytime I'm in Vegas!!!"

            "review": "I decided to give Yonaka a try, even though I'm not a huge fan of raw fish.  Lucky for me, there are plenty of options on the menu for the sashimi-averse, and the raw fish offerings I did try were so different and delicious that I might just end up a convert.\n\nFirst, the ambience.  The interior design is smart and contemporary, without overdoing it.  A loop of music plays constantly, but not so loudly that it interferes with dining.  There are some really nice touches, like the wood-block wall, that give the dining room a casual elegance.\n\nI sat at the sushi bar and asked the staff what were the dishes that a lot of people seem to like, especially the Happy Hour items since the prices are so gosh darn reasonable.  The first recommendation was the crispy brussel sprouts, oft-mentioned in other reviews.  Yes, they are every bit as good as everyone reports, and this coming from someone who used to hate brussel sprouts.  I also tried the sake orenji, salmon w/oranges - fresh, clean, and delicious.  Executive Chef Ramir DeCastro has an uncanny knack for putting together flavors and ingredients that you would never think of combining, yet blend together for unique and delicious dishes.  At HH prices of $5 for the sprouts and $7 for the sake orenji, the Yonaka HH menu is some of the best bang-for-the-foodie-buck in Las Vegas.\n\nFrom the regular menu, a crazy-but-it-works (and how!) combination is the beef berry:  medium-rare beef medallions with strawberries, trumpet mushrooms, caramelized enoki mushrooms, and fennel.  Uh, fresh strawberries with beef??  But as nutty as it all might sound, the dish works!  In my three Yonaka visits, other knockout tapas were the beef tongue sliders, the uni (raw sea urchin, amazing freshness), and the ishiyaki (wagyu beef you cook yourself on a hot stone).  The only item I wasn't crazy about was the eel tempura with sweet potato chips.  The fried eel didn't have much flavor, and even seemed a bit dry (how does anything tempura end up dry?).  But the $6 cost of the dish was well worth it just for the sweet potato chips: the thinnest, crunchiest, and crispiest I've ever had.  My favorite from the specials menu was the foie gras sushi.  At this point, words fail me.  You simply have to try this exercise in decadent self-indulgence for yourself.  Just trust me when I say the foie gras melting on your tongue sparks an involuntary response of your eyeballs rolling back into your head.\n\nI also tried a couple of desserts, chokoreto and the ringo lico.  As much as I'm not a chocolate fan, I tried the chokoreto (lime, avocado, chocolate ganache, chocolate crumbles) just because by that point I was so blown away by Ramir DeCastro's inventive combinations that I was adventurous enough to try anything.  I loved everything, especially the chocolate ganache, except the chocolate crumbles, which were far too dry and bitter for me.  The ringo lico is more up my alley:  granny smith apple sorbet, grapefruit panna cotta, candied kumquats (only ingredient I don't like, but I just push them to the side), sugar-dried fennel, grapefruit supreme (grapefruit segments with the membrane removed), pistachios and pistachio butter.  How they sell it for $7 and still manage a profit is beyond me.  I'd pay $7 just for the little cube of grapefruit panna cotta.\n\nThe staff gets an A+ for effort.  A lot of workplaces like to describe their staff as a team, which usually makes my eyes roll because it all seems a little too Self-Help Meets Fortune 500.  But at Yonaka, the staff really does work as a team.  They're putting in a heckuva lot of hours, far above and beyond, but they know that's what it will take to make a new restaurant a success.  I did find that sometimes the service can get a bit too casual, however, like when I saw on more than one occasion the server punching in an order a good 5+ minutes after taking it.  I was in no rush since I loved chatting with the staff at the sushi bar, but diners at the tables might get annoyed.\n\nYonaka is smart, hip, contemporary, and all while avoiding pretentiousness or even a hint of attitude.  The menu is creative, the ingredients are first-rate, and everything they serve is done with passion and dedication.  There are countless restaurants in Las Vegas.  It's a tough to pick just one, but I think Yonaka just became my favorite."

It also has bits of ginger so if you're allergic, avoid.\n\nBuko Jam: This sounded really interesting because it has coconut pandan jelly on toast along with foi gras and egg. Very cute presentation, but the combination of tastes was a little odd.\n\nLipa Roll: Shrimp Tempura with Spicy Tuna. Standard stuff.\n\nNegitoro: Nothing special about this.\n\nTsutsumi: Pork belly with pork ears, and you mix a raw egg in it to cook in the stone pot. Cute presentation and it was fun mixing.\n\nAsian Bacon: This was really good! Yummy pork belly with a nice crisp. Like lechon.\n\nShioyaki Saba: Good presentation, but a little dry.\n\nCrunchy Spicy Handroll: Generous portion but didn't seem like HH price at $5 per.\nBrussel Sprouts: This was roasted really well and a good filler for $5!\n\nFoi Gras Sushi: This was off HH menu at $9 per piece.

            "review": "They have fresh fish that is for sure, and I think that they have capable and competent sushi team.  It started off pretty well.  I was promptly greeted and then given a detailed overview of there philosophy around only serving one item at a time to fully enjoy each serving.  In essence to \"Focus\" on the course.\n\nI can appreciate the desire for a \"Zen\" experience around the serving.  Certainly at many of the finer establishments I have been to this has been the case.\n\nHowever they are still going through the growing pains of a new restaurant which I found to be surprising.  The space is much too big a space for their ability to put out consistent and reliable food.  The friendly woman managing the front of the house does a great job explaining the concept they are going for.  \n\nHowever, they are SOOOO concerned with \"pacing\" so I can \"focus\" on one dish at a time that it took 70 minutes between my app and my first piece of fish.  I had all that time to focus on no food and crappy service which over shadowed the originality they were going for.  What little I got tasted great, but I would never go back again.\n\nAs a note, to the fellow from Austin that rather snobbishly insulted about everyone he could.  You should be embarrassed to compare this place to Jiro Ono and his business in the Ginza Tokio Subway station.  Yonaka's wasn't consistent between preparations of the same dish at the same station let alone over decades.  Most certainly Yonaka's is not even worthy of a Las Vegas gamers's dinning award let alone a Michelin star.\n\nAgain, fresh fish (which most can get at their local Uwajimaya market, Ranch 99, or similar market).  They also have an interesting concept of a fully prepared bite with the ideal flavor combination, but they have a very long way to go.  Frankly, if I'm getting fully on water while I wait they aren't going to sell me very much food.  So whatever success might be found is going to start with figuring out a pacing of food and a consistent quality product while they still have the appeal of being new."

The flavor of each dish slowly exploded in your mouth, and it was beyond delicious. I came here twice, and both times were equally delicious. All in all, I tried the crispy brussel sprouts, karaage, pokuyaki, tea brined ribs, 10 course chocolate dessert, and a couple of other dishes (which I unfortunately forgot the names of and will try to describe).\n\nBrussel sprouts: I hate brussel sprouts, but after having Yonaka's brussel sprouts, I would come here again and again for it. The brussel sprouts I have tried are usually bland, but there was so much flavor packed in their dish. There was this crunch, and in a way, it felt like you weren't even eating brussel sprouts. They almost tasted like mini-potatoes, because it was so soft.\n\nKaraage: As I'm writing this review, my mouth is watering. The chicken is extremely juicy and cooked to such perfection. At other places, the coating of the chicken overwhelms the chicken itself, but the chicken to coating ratio is perfect. \n\nSalmon, kale, quinoa, cherry tomatoes, and pear (I forgot the name of this dish.): I am not a fan of fish, but I did try the salmon. The cut of the salmon was extremely fresh, and my table loved it. I did eat the other parts of this dish, but the one that that stood out  of this dish was the crispiness of the kale. It was flawless.\n\nCoconut sandwich with egg dipping sauce (I forgot the name of this dish.): My table got this dish towards the end of our meal, and by then, we were stuffed. This dish is unique: a sweet coconut sandwich dipped into a soy sauce with egg? Even though it sounds weird, it was scrumptious. \n\nPokuyaki: Ah, I'm so used to eating steamed buns with peking duck, but Yonaka's twist with the pork, granny smith apples, and jalapenos surely satisfied me. They give such a big, thick slice of pork, and the flavors of each ingredient compliment each other. I especially liked the spiciness of the jalapeno.\n\nTea brined ribs: Yummy ribs! This dish a bit on the sweeter side, but still mouthwatering. The only negative is that I made a mess while trying to eat it because the meat doesn't slide right off.\n\n10 ways to eat chocolate dessert: If you love chocolate, you have to order this. SOOO GOOD. I particularly liked the ice cream, and the chocolate isn't beyond sweet. Our table was also given a complimentary strawberry drink in the cutest cup, and I could drink that forever. \n\nI love Yonaka, and I would definitely come back again, and again. The quality and quality here is beyond superb. And their waiters/waitresses are extremely friendly and well-informed. It is such an exquisite place. :)"

            "review": "8 course omakase. Specials off the board. Sashimi, usual find like Hamachi kama, dessert and cocktails. Imagine that you have taken some of these Michelin star restaurants and new American or new French restaurants and consolidated them into one, and you got this heavenly, spectacular presentation that is so unexpected that you wondered how others have found this spot off the strip. Google review gives it a 4.9 out of 5. I can see why. It wows people. \n\nTo summarize in a San Franciscan friendly terms, this 8 course omakase is a bit of a French Laundry, Urchin Bistrot, Benu, COI, Saison, Sons and Daughters, Izakaya Yuzuki, Common Wealth, State Bird Provisions and Rich Table all blended into one and then some. If this is what modern Japanese means, man I need to immediately go on an extreme diet so that by the time I get to Japan in February, I will eat my way through Tokyo. \n\nI enjoyed it so much that I texted a friend who's coming here in a few weeks from New York, and said that he should forgo other eating opportunities and camp right out here. It's one thing to say that you have eaten good sushi, it's another to say, you've eaten really amazing Japanese food. This place has amazing food. \n\nEarlier this year, I was flying on business class via ANA from HK to SFO. It turned out to be a transformative experience because up until recently I thought of Japanese food as sushi and sashimi, very much like most Americans, who think Chinese food as Kung Pao chicken and Mongolian Beef. ANA had prepared for its business class passengers two types of  elaborate multi-course meal. One is French and one is Japanese, designed by a Michelin 3 star French restaurant chef in Tokyo. I opted to taste the Japanese food only to be blown away by how unlike it is to all of the other Japanese food I've eaten in the States, and even in Korea and Hong Kong. The moment I landed in SFO, I booked my 2015 trip to Japan. \n\nRead Yonaka's cold dishes menu and you get a sense how innovative it is: \n\nCRUDO\nsea bass, kumato tomato, ikura, candied quinoa, lemon herb oil \n\nUNI TO IKURA\nsea urchin, salmon roe, hokkaido sea scallops, shiitake mushroom, kabocha, yuzu kosho \n\nThe list goes on. \n\nNo one has ever created a restaurant like this in the bay area. Why? I think it goes back to my other L.A. restaurants' review theory. You must have discriminating taste among the masses in order to erect restaurants of this caliber. We in the bay area, despite our acclaimed foodie city status, lack innate curiosity and innovation among the young. We get Bostonians occupying San Francisco and think they have arrived in food haven but we do not get New Yorkers, not enough of them, anyway, to say you really have not eaten good Chinese food until you have gotten yourself to Flushing, Queens. \n\nWe like good food but we do not demand excellent food. We like variety but not authenticity. We lack maturity in the food evolution, and thus we don't have such restaurants. Case and point, Ippudo, which coined the ramen scene for me anyway, had been open in New York for over a decade, it would not and will not come to San Francisco, because the demand is not there. Modern Japanese can be found in L.A., and apparently Las Vegas, but not in San Francisco.\n\nI fear my enthusiasm is running low at the moment for my beloved city, and it does not help that by eating at Yonaka, it cemented my long term suspicion. \n\nShould I continue my food travel journey elsewhere outside of San Francisco? The answer is obvious. I must. If I want to venture out of my own comfort zone and eat some of the best of the things one could ever experience, I must.  \n\nAna\u00efs Nin wrote, \"We travel, some of us forever, to seek other states, other lives, other souls.\" I have ceased to seek other souls (it would appear that I have failed, over and over again, to connect with others, or others failed to connect with me. But I digress, this commentary clearly requires another medium), but I have not become tired of other states and other lives, especially if those states and lives continue to introduce me to this type of food.\n\nYonaka is worth the $20 cab ride from strip. Its out of this world food reignited my passion for exotica. Perhaps I won't be wowed any time soon by any San Francisco restaurants, I won't despair. My next flight is in five days, this time, Portland, Oregon bound."

So last night, we decided to try the food out.  I enjoyed the ambiance... just like their food, it had an edgy elegance and yet relaxed feel.  \n\nThe food was presented beautifully, but unfortunately we had quibbles with each item.  Great stuff - beet fries and an apple berry palette cleanser.  The quibbles - the salmon toro sashimi was too cold, like it had to sit out longer from a freeze.  Not good :(.  The hamachi sushi had too much miso mixture that was very tart it just blew away the delicate hamachi.  The pokuyaki pork belly was... just that... seasoned fatty pork.  The other elements were all separate.  If you like eating a lot of fat, then this dish is for you.  The chicken kaarage was drenched in sauce.  My longing for some lightness and a little crispiness was lost in what I thought was a muddled flavor.  The brussel sprouts tasted good, but I think if you were to serve a deep fried item, you should serve it with other stuff.  Not on its own, and not as a starter to a group of hungry people having dinner at 9pm.  If not your evening just starts with too much grease.  The shrimp tempura was not great tempura, and was served with a marmalade and a side of salt.  Sorry, but this is not good fusion to me.\n\nAnd finally, the exquisite looking Chokoreto dessert had too much icky cookie crumb in ratio to the good chocolate mousse, and the ice cream on top?  Is lime.  Very sour ice cream on top of chocolate goodness.  It was not good :(.  I am no foodie expert, but these details in fusion cuisine cause a successful transition from the traditional Asian flavors, to Western yumminess.  And somehow, we left Yonaka with a reasonable but substantial bill feeling let down."

Being from SF, with an ubundance of fresh and local sushi/seafood options, this little Izakaya style joint serves up unique and flavorful dishes, the ones worth mentioning being as follows:\n\n*Sake Orenji (scotish salmon with sliced oranges in an orange yuzu dressing) Simply my FAVORITE! \n\n*Sake toro (Salmon belly) this was so buttery and just melted in your mouth! I'm also not somone who enjoys most raw fish.\n\n*Toro (Tuna belly) very simular to salmon belly but a stronger fish taste\n\n*karagi (fried chicken) thiers was the mpst unique as it had a spicy jalepenio sauce which really gave it that extra kick!\n\n*sauteed brussel sprouts-these were amazingly delicious and crispy,  with a lemon zesty sauce. I truly have never liked brussel sprouts until I tried thiers!\n\n*thier pork belly steam buns (thier version was spicy and perfectly steamed) \n\n*ribs (4 peices with tons of tender meat that falls right off the bone in a tangy orange bbw sauce.\n\n*fresh house made ginger ale. \n\n*greenies dessert (green tea brownie with a rasberry and green tea ice cream served with a small cup of strawberry white hot chocolate. I loved thier take on strawberry milk so much so that I specifically requested this each evening we came. Its completely made from scratch using real strawberries and a perfectly frothy milk. \n\nIf there is one place that will make me keep coming back to Vegas (since I dont smoke, drink or gamble) it would be this place! I highly recommend coming here, especially for happy hour and for those who want a little taste of the bay that thier missing from back home! The only (minor) thing I would say more as constructive criticism, is the time it takes between dishes to come out, even when there are only a few tables there. I've eaten at plenty of sushi and Izakaya places and even when packed, the food seemed to come out more quickly. Again, this was just a minor annoyance and doesnt take anything away from my overall experience or appreciation for the place. :)"

Now, you could ask, why didn't I check Yelp to see if it was indeed an izakaya.  I typically do that, but for some reason I didn't bother to confirm.  Well, when every time you punch in \"izakaya\" on search and this place pops up at one of the very first ones...\n\nAnyway, it turns out the experience was worthwhile, so I'm not complaining too much.  If you take it for what it is - an upscale Japanese small dish RESTAURANT - it is quite a unique experience.  The restaurant is attractive - modern, grey-neutral tone, open space - with a large sushi bar area across the back.  The front host as well as all the staff are very pleasant and quite professional in appearance and demeanor.  They really make all the efforts to make this as upscale as it looks and costs, and succeed at it quite well.  Despite what it was not, our expectations rose a notch or two.\n\nWe ordered the 8-course omakase, which was recommended by our server as appropriate for 2-3 people.  She was spot on, as we struggled to finish the complete package and left the very good dessert only half-empty.  At $106, the 8-course is quite a bargain.  Here is what we got:\n - Bowl of Pan-fried(?) brussell sprouts which had a great toasty-tangy taste to it, although it came with no accompaniments and was much too salty for that\n - Sake Orenji, which is sashimi slice of salmon and orange with clear sauce.  Delicious.\n - Hotategai & strawberry is big slices of scallops and strawberry.  Interesting flavor, but I think it would be hit or miss depending on your take on the combination.  I liked it, mainly because I love both ingredients.\n - Hamachi & grapefruit is the same theme as previous two with yellowtail & said fruit.  Again, depends on your taste but I liked it as well.\n \nWe are starting to get full at this point, and then the heavy stuff starts coming\n - Pork Belly w/Kimchi is 6 THICK pieces of pork belly with side of lettuce-like kimchi.  Pork is sweet and kimchi is semi-spicy, and the combination goes well.  At this point we are really wishing for a side of rice to tame all the raw flavors.\n - Angus Beef w/Mushrooms was my least favorite, because there was a bit of fishiness to the beef.  The sauce and shroom mix made me wish the beef was better, because that was a great combo otherwise.\n - Flounder w/dried Chorizo and potatoes - We are completely full at this point and I wish I had the stomach for this, because it was really good.  Probably the best dish of the course.\n \nThe 8th course is the dessert, which they mercifully waited a while to serve.  Still, we could only eat half of the combo of Green Tea Brownie, Strawberry Mint ice cream, and the vanilla ice cream.  The strawberry cream is quite unique, as the mint flavor is as if I was actually chewing on mint leaves.\n\nThat plus a hot sake resulted in a $160 bill after tips, which is a relative bargain.  While the taste of each dish with the strange recipe was largely dependent on the diner's preferences, the presentation and quality was top notch.  Regardless of your personal preference, this place deserves a 4-star or more.  We need more places like this.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  They have a large bar so that might work, but the atmosphere is wholly for dates and good conversations for larger groups.  So I wouldn't recommend it."

The restaurant is a great value if you are willing to spend some money for some great food. The sushi quality is great and I loved everything we ordered. Service was very attentive. We were able to get a table last minute on a Saturday night, which was great for us because we failed to get one for some of the other popular Japanese places in Chinatown. I just hope it doesn't mean that it will be gone soon after."

It's close to the strip (2.5 miles, about 10-12 dollar cab ride)... but you feel like you're back in the \"real world.\"  The restaurant is moderate size, modern yet cozy inside.  The service was excellent - probably the best I've had in Las Vegas.  We ordered the omakase - which here means you get 8 of the chef's favorite/classic dishes. The 8 dish omakase is recommended for 2  ... and yes we were stuffed (rare for a fancy restaurant let alone a fancy japanese restaurant). Each dish was a delightful spin on a classic, yet preserving and highlighting the main ingredient rather than hiding it in a bunch of hackneyed spices.  My favorite was the first wish - some perfect large slices of salmon sashimi crowned with micro-arugula, sitting on citurs slices with a delicate ponzu sauce.  Usually such dishes I've had at other restaurants use crappy salmon, and they attempt to hard that under a bunch of salt - this was delicious salmon they were somehow able to highlight"

Those business are not always packed, so its easy to find a parking spot, even on busy nights. \n\nAmbiance (5/5)\nThe atmosphere is excellent at this restaurant, it has a vibe of a posh casino restaurant but the its more relaxed. It's not noisy, at least when I went their at night for their happy hour. \n\nService (5/5)\nService is excellent, there is no rush on ordering the food and each course is served as based on how your party is eating the food. Since, my friend Shawn and I were taking a lot of pics, we were taking our sweet time eating each item, and upon noticing this the restaurant staff paced how they would bring our meals. The staff was very friendly and courteous. \n\nFood (5/5)\nI want to apologize in advance for this review focusing on just one item. I'm writing this review 2 months after I went to this restaurant. I loved everything they served, but this one item they served changed my perspective on whole it, so here is goes. \n\nNot everyone is a fan of Uni; it looks scary from the outside and when you look at the meat, it looks like a tongue of cholera patient, yellow and slimy. So, I've always tried to avoid eating it for the texture reason. We decided to order the Fresh Uni, from their menu during their happy hour (also, its not part of their happy hours menu, ~$20). When they mean fresh, they really mean fresh, the spikes were still moving a little when it arrived on our table (see the pics below). Each piece of meat was placed on the radish strings, which were stuffed in the actual shell. The presentation was excellent. Upon taking one piece into my mouth it literally dissolved in my mouth, like a piece of butter does in a 500 oF oven. The flavor was exquisite, it was so smooth and buttery that I had to sit back and take it all in. This is the moment that I realized my love for Uni, it has to be fresh to be enjoyed properly. You can't expect the same flavor from any AYCE sushi restaurants. \n\nOverall (5/5), I wanted to write down negatives about this place, but I just can't find any. Happy hour (11PM - 1AM) is the best time to go here. Our bill came out to $30 for one of the best meal I've ever had. I also want to do a shout-out to my friend Shawn Hong for introducing me to this gem. Thanks bud."

The interior design was clean, minimalist and of course modern. The service was superb (you get hot towels to wipe your hands with [\"like the ones you get from the airplanes!\" as what my friend said],our water glass was never half empty, our dishes came out in a timely manner, our plates were removed almost instantaneously after we were done with our meal) and the ma\u00eetre d stopped by to ask about our dining experience and to inform us about their concept. \n\nNow, moving onto the food. We ordered from the Happy Hour menu. The Happy Hour menu provides you a great selection with a fraction of the cost, so I definitely would recommend it, especially if you would like to try as many plates as possible. Each plate was a work of art (almost hard to take a bite), this is probably a repetition from what others have said previously, but it's true. Not only does each plate look B-E-A-utiful, it also taste just as wonderful. We ordered: Negihama, Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Konpa, Sake Orenji, Crudo, Ironha and for dessert, Chokoreto. We also received a couple complementary dishes, before our dishes arrived, which was a slice of heirloom tomato with some garnish, and a fruit salad (Asian pears, blueberries, strawberries, crunchy seeds and micro greens) which is a combination of savory, tart, salty and sweet. The sauces in each dish was not too overpowering and brought the whole dish together. The ma\u00eetre d suggested that we incorporate all of the ingredients into one bite in order to experience the dish as it was intended to be. \n\nYonaka has only been open for a couple months, and it would be by no means a surprise when it starts getting a buzz all over town, or have an article in the foodie section from a local magazine. Truly an amazing experience."

I liked the sauce it came with, but the piece of watermelon was too big and watered down the whole taste of the dish.  \n \n-Gyu sliders: wow, probably my least favorite dish.  It was meat and chunky slices of jalape\u00f1o (which I don't mind), nonexistent pur\u00e9e/sauce smacked in between two pieces of molded white rice made to look like buns.  They tried to get too creative, but in essence it's just meat and rice.\n\n-Asian pillow: this was a horrible take on fresh spring rolls.  It was basically salmon, kumquat, and greens wrapped in rice paper, cut into pieces of \"rolls\".  There was hardly any salmon, too much salad, cut to big, and not enough sauce.  \n\n-Grilled mackerel was good, how do you mess that up though.  It was served atop sliced cucumbers that were there more for decoration.\n\n-Uni to ikura: uni, scallops, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, salmon roe, and this spice (that tasted like nothing).  This dish had too much going on.  I love salmon roe, but they didn't need to put that much.  The pumpkin pur\u00e9e was too thick and didn't taste like anything, pair that with a big piece of scallop and uni, and you're left with a very confused palate.\n\nI also ordered both desserts that they offered.  It was probably the only part of dinner I actually enjoyed, even better had they not left a finger indentation on my sorbet.  haha, that was funny.   Overall, yonaka left me wanting more.  I felt like I was in another restaurant, on the strip, that's trying too hard to impress.  Actually, considering the price point, it might as well be on the strip. \n\nOn a more positive note, the decoration is nice; it was very hip, sheik, clean, and simple.  Our server was very kind, presentable, and did a great job explaining the menu and dishes.  Oh, and if you're on a time crunch, I suggest you ask the server to bring the food out as its ready.  Our server coursed each dish out one by one and we ended up being at the restaurant for nearly two hours.  Seriously, took forever.\n\nI'll probably come back just because I want to try out the other dishes, but based on this first visit i'm rating my experience at a 2.5 (solely based on the food.  I'm not taking into account the decoration or service, which were both fine, but i'm here for the food and I just didn't taste that WOW factor.)"

With some help from some local knowledge, we were able to make it to Yonaka and we are both thankful.\n\nI can't recall getting this level of quality sushi at this price anywhere, let alone Las Vegas. Maybe I am used to the sticker shock prices of the Strip. We started off with an interesting amuse bouche of a strawberry with some foie gras mousse. Well, I should say that I started with both of them as the wife was not feeling the foie gras this evening. I did encourage her to try a piece of it, but I also gobbled the second one down after 3 straight no responses. They were really indescribably delicious. How they made the foie taste like sweet caramel while preserving the flavor of the foie is beyond me. And then we ordered sushi!\n\nOur sever talked to us about their menu options since it was our first visit. We opted not to do dinner for two with chef selections, because we had already decided on some items that we wanted to try. We started with the sake orenji, which is one of their signature dishes. The citrus and salmon worked perfectly together. We followed that by some hotate kokoro (scallops) and uni to ikura (sea urchin). Again everything was expertly prepared and taste phenomenal. The wife was not the biggest fan of the uni, but that just meant more for me. Next was a smoked hamachi special plate that was on their daily special menu and shioyaki saba (grilled mackerel). Ok, now the grilled mackerel was great, but the wife and I agreed that the smoked hamachi was the best piece of fish in recent memory. So much so that we loaded up another plate of it in sashimi form. I am sure that I missed a plate or two in there somewhere as there was more sea urchin for me and something else the wife wanted. \n\nWe left Yonaka stuffed for a decent price and we were ready for bed after our long trek from the east coast. Yonaka will definitely be seeing us again on future trips. We still need to check out their happy hour."

Off the happy hour menu we enjoyed the suitoviche which was their play on ceviche, the flavors were good and the presentation was lovely.  None of the other happy hour items (shioyaki saba, ribs) were anything to write home about however.  The star item of the night was premium selection of sashimi we ordered off the regular menu! The sushi chef really put together all the best items we enjoy the most: otoro, amaebi, oysters, hamachi etc.  The uni to ikura appetizer was also pretty good but eaten together the flavors don't really marry.  Overall dinner was quite tasty and definitely better in value than any strip property.  The one star off was for the pushy waiter.  I appreciate menu suggestions but I do not like to be pressured into ordering something I do not want.  In the end I could not tell if he was genuine or getting pressure from management to sell certain items."

We complimented dinner with sake sangria. Each dish was extremely balanced, never letting the sweet fruit over power the savory sauce, or the other way around. Every sauce was so delicious that I wished there was more food with the plate to keep using it!

I was a bit disappointed that my version didn't come with ikura as I had seen other diners receive, but it was an interesting start to our meal.\n\n* Crispy Brussel Sprouts \"brussel sprouts, lemon chili, mint, puffed rice\" ($6) - This came out rather immediately and set the tone for the rest of the meal.  (The Husband had high hopes for this dish and the result would probably reflect how much we would enjoy the rest of our dinner.)  It was good...really good.  Yes, damn good.  It was a generous amount and we were loving it.  We were delighted.  \n\n* Crudo \"sea bass, heirloom tomato, ikura, candied quinoa, lemon herb oil\" ($12) - This next course took quite awhile to come out.  It wasn't as if they were cooking anything for it, but we were twiddling our thumbs waiting.  The presentation of this dish could be as to why the wait.  The candied quinoa is definitely different as its uncooked quinoa.  The Husband only wished he had more.\n\n* Takorizo \"grilled japanese octopus, chorizo, melon, almonds, salsa verde, black olive oil\" ($16) - Again, quite a wait for this dish too.  The octopus was warm, the melon was cool.  You need to take a bite of the chorizo, melon and octopus altogether to really appreciate the sweet and salty factor.\n\n* Hotateyaki \"sea scallops, tomatillo, cauliflower, grapefruit-ginger-miso vinaigrette\" ($13) - At this point, we realized we needed a fork and knife to cut down the food as chopsticks weren't cutting it.  (Plus, most items were served in quantities of five and we are all about sharing equally here!)  Another dish that requires you to get a piece of the scallop, tomatillo, and grapefruit segment all at once.\n\n* Compressed watermelon - This was a complimentary dish, again something I had seen served with big eye tuna for other diners.  It was soaked in fish sauce, but was quite refreshing. \n\n* Sake Orenji \"atlantic salmon, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, lemon oil, maldon\" ($10) - It was among one of our favorites.  The salmon and orange segments were a bit large and needed to be cut down, but the sauce that it lay in along with the yuzu tobiko were delicious.  My only problem was that the tobiko would fall off the fish and into the sauce and I had to dig around to get every little morsel out.  The busboy wanted to clear my plate and I was definitely not done digging around!\n\n* Sakana Dore \"fish of the day, bell pepper, zucchini chips, apple, micro greens, yuzu honey, tosaka seaweed\" ($15) - We were told the fish of the day was albacore and Yonaka was the only place in the Valley that had fresh albacore versus frozen albacore.  The waitress said it came from Hawai'i, so we decided to order it.  However, it came out with salmon instead of albacore.  They ended up comping this dish for us while they made a new order with albacore.  You really need to get every component of the dish into your mouth to enjoy the food.  The yuzu honey was superb!\n\n* Sakana Dore \"fish of the day, bell pepper, zucchini chips, apple, micro greens, yuzu honey, tosaka seaweed\" ($15) - This time it came with albacore, but the Husband actually preferred the salmon version.  This version was a bit fishier, but still good nonetheless.  And we were happy to get more yuzu honey!\n\n* Shioyaki Saba \"grilled norwegian mackerel, cucumber, lemon, parsley\" ($5) - Considering they said the dishes were meant to be shared, the saba was one large piece of fish sitting on a bed of English cucumbers.  Thank goodness for our knife and fork because we needed to cut down the cucumbers to enjoy a piece with every bite of fish, which was just cooked perfectly.  We made a point of pulling the fish to the side so it didn't soak up the sauce too quickly.\n\n* Machitaki \"yellowtail tataki, asparagus, yuca chips, tomato ginger puree, soy pudding\" ($13) - This dish came highly recommended by our waitress and for good reason.  It was among one of my favorites.  The soy pudding wasn't exactly what I was expecting as its rather concentrated soy sauce and not soy like tofu.  Instead of asparagus, we got avocado, which tasted great anyway.\n\n* Chokoreto \"lime, chocolate, mint, avocado\" ($7) - A generous chocolate heavy dessert with chocolate cookie, chocolate cookie crumbles, chocolate torte/pudding, lime sorbet, and dots of mint and avocado sauce.  I think I could have used a bit more mint and avocado though.\n\nService - Ashlee, our waitress, was great - attentive and relatively knowledgeable.  The busboys were bit overanxious with trying to clear our plates, twice reaching from behind me and over my shoulder.  Water glasses were filled very quickly though!  I thought the music was a little too loud.  (And no hot water in the restroom?)  \n\nOverall, beautiful presentation with foods jumping from savory to sweet to tangy.\n\n4.5 stars and only three weeks since it's been open."

The have a bunch of tables, and a sushi bar. The music playing in the background was my type of music. \nSo, on to the food and service.......\nFood:  Everything had such a beautiful presentation. We received several comp'd tastings from the chef. (very cool!). My favorite was the compressed watermelon and tuna with sliced jalapenos and cilantro. Very tasty. The fried tofu was good too. We ordered what seemed like every item on the menu. Fried brussel sprouts, (FANTASTIC), japanese pumpkin tempura, (YUM), beet fries (Tasty), a tuna plate, a mackerel plate, a scallop plate, another tuna plate, a prokbelly plate. And, I'm sure I'm forgetting some. \nThe presentation of all dishes was beautiful. My scallops had some edible flowers which were so pretty. The flavors on all dishes (except pot belly, I didnt try that), were good to very good. The brussel sprouts were I think my favorite. The were fried and then tossed with crunchy rice and vinegar? WOOOOW. So good. So so good. I will get those again. The fishes were all nice too. Nice flavor and one of them had a nice smoky char flavor which I enjoyed quite a bit. Dessert was good, but they were out of the one we really wanted. The chocolate dessert we got was good, but it was supposed to come with white chocolate (which I am not a fan of) and instead it came with a lime sorbet. I didn't think that matched the dish though. I think the white chocolate would have been better. \nThe bathroom was very very clean. They have mouthwash and small cups to rinse with after dinner. Or, you can do like I did and think it's soap and try and wash your hands with it. Duuuuuh! \nThe service was excellent. Our waiter called the quinoa I sampled, KIN O WAH, which was weird, but he was very nice and attentive. They cleared our plates once they were done, they refilled our waters/ice tea's when they were close to empty. The manager came over and introduced herself and gave us all her card. \nIll definitely come back here, and I just might let Christina talk me into raw fish!"

Let's get on to the food.\n\nChicken Karrage with jalape\u00f1o ,mint ,basil, and onion was very good everything just went well together. The chicken was perfectly cooked,and very moist. Well done.\n\nCalamari with almonds, and mango was just a nice wonderful light dish. \n\nHamachi Kama is one of my favorite things to order, and Yonaka just cooked it perfectly. The hamachi skin was nice and crisp, and the meat was so moist. Now that was fresh.\n\nUni To Ikura with salmon roe, Hokkaido sea scallops, mushrooms,and yuzu kosho was just a work of art on a plate. I didn't know if I should have eaten or frame it. It was just amazing how the creamy of the uni the saltiness of the salmon roe the sweetness of the sea scallops,and the yuzu kosho just comes together perfectly. Party in your mouth. Hands down my favorite dish of the night. Highly Recommend\n\nHamachi Crudo with grapefruit was another stellar dish. Hamachi was very fresh. \n\nPokuyaki kurobuta pork belly. You definitely can't go wrong with this dish who doesn't like pork belly. They did a wonderful job the belly pair it together with the Granny Smith apple, fennel pur\u00e9e and lemon shiso. The lemon shiso was a good touch. \n\nDessert \nChoco 10 ways is for those chocolate loves out there. Very good. 1 ordered is good enough for four.\n\nGreenies is for those green tea lovers. I really enjoyed this one a lot.\n\nWhat a great dinner, enjoy every bits of it. I'm definitely booking it again on our next Vegas trip. Love to try more of their wonderful dishes."

            "review": "The first big note I'd say is not to eat at this place if you are in a rush. The food takes an extraordinary time to come out. Not everyone at the table got everything they ordered because it took so long and we had to leave to catch our show. That's bad news since we had been there for an hour and a half and were not ordering everything off the menu. While we were leaving, one of the APPETIZERS we had ordered finally came out but we had to go so we let some other patrons have it.\n\nThe waitress told us that they course the meals, so everything comes out at different times. I call shenanigans on that. There was no rhyme or reason for that, nor did they explain that when we first ordered. I ordered spicy tuna rolls and a few other sushi dishes and my food came out ALL AT ONCE. However, other people at the table had to wait about half an hour before ANY of their food came out. Not sure why they coursed it. There were not a lot of people in the restaurant at the time. Plus, a lot of this food is raw food. It's not like they places six sizzling fajita skillets on our table at the same time and we had to rush before it cooled. It was strange. \n\nThe service wasn't great either. Did not fill up the water very often (and again, not a lot of people inside). The waitress also took forever giving us the bill even after we had told her we were in a hurry and a party member had to track her down to get her to take the bill. I will say the waitress did seem knowledgeable about the menu and did put in a special request of mine (which wasn't that special, just not to have cucumbers in my spicy tuna roll).\n\nWhat saves the restaurant really is the food and the presentation. I'm not a sushi connoisseur, but I enjoyed the sushi we had. I had a tuna belly sushi roll which did (as the waitress described) melt in your mouth. I believe we had some midnight sushi rolls wish was eel that I enjoyed as well. I had a freshly squeezed ginger ale that was strong and tasty. All the plates had a little pizazz on them as well. Just looked great. Also liked the inside of the restaurant, very clean look about it. \n\nOverall, the place was a little underwhelming (as it has a ton of five star ratings). I thought it was okay, just plan on being there for a few hours apparently for the coursing or ask them not to course the meals (as the waitress commented as we were leaving)."

It was the night before Valentine's Day so a lot of places had no more reservation available. The interior inside was nice, modern,small restaurant. And then it began...our server seemed nice but by the time we started ordering our drinks and meals EVERYTHING came out SLOW it was unbelievable!! 4 of us arrived first including the birthday girl ordered drinks and waited about 20 minutes before our cocktail came. Our food came before our drinks. 3 outta 4 of us received our drinks 20 min later and the other 2 girls arrive and get their cocktails before the birthday girl! And she ordered it first...Really?! Some people got their food after when everyone was already finished. I've worked in the food industry so I know servers can be \"in the weeds\" but not even a manager came to check and see how we were doing and gave us a lousy free birthday dessert when we ordered about $300 worth of food! I can give them this...presentation was beautiful and food was yummy, but thinking it's okay to make people wait that long and no manager to help out or an apology is just ridiculous, for that I won't be coming back:/"

And we're not novices - Japanese food is one of our favorite foods. I think the 'modern' aspect takes it heads above. The fish is like off the boat fresh. Then it is uniquely presented with contemporary ingredient pairings like hamachi with avo, cucumber & jalape\u00f1o as a spicy cold salad - wow. There was exceptionally fresh salmon with grapefruit slice salad and an outstanding dressing. Both of these were happy hour prices - what a deal. The uni & scallop dish was too good to be true. It was so good that we went back and the second night we got the 8 course meal. It was the best and the price was reasonable. And we are not usually dessert eaters but they had a custard filled with mango that I am still thinking about. Prakash facilitates and he's really helpful if you have questions or specific likes. I used to think if you can't see the ocean don't eat the fish but this place changed all that. I'm driving back to LV really soon since I'm already craving their food."

It was delicious with earthy crispy mushrooms, tomatoes, fresh delicate uni, scallops, and roe. We had the greenies for dessert. It tasted very sweet and had a lot of components to it.

We could see all four chefs preparing food for the entire house with their skillful and mouthwatering dishes.  \n\nMy love and I ordered a bottle of wine and found ourselves lost in conversation as we paused to enjoyed these visually stunning and highly satisfying courses:\n   -Sake Orenji...scottish salmon, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, thai chili, orange oil\n   -Kanpachi Crudo...amber jack, pickled cucumber, mint, jalapeno, cilantro, crispy shallots, \n    sakana zu, Thai basil oil \n   -Toro...blue fin tuna  belly, candied walnut, dehydrated cherry, negs, piment d'espelette\n   -Uni...sea urchin, hacaleback caviar, yuzu creme fraiche, lemon zest, chives\n   -Oysters...kumamoto, salmon roe, micro greens, minced vin dressing\n   -Foie Gras Nigiri\n   -Seared Fatty Tuna Nigiri\n   -Sake Steamed Clams...littleneck clams, soy glazed kurobuta pork belly, thai basil\n   -Wagyu To Kinokoi...grilled wagyu filet, mirage oysters, shitake, bok choy, nas, coconut soy \n    cream sauce\n   -Yuzu Ichigo...yuzu, calamansi, lemon, white chocolate, strawberry ricotta\n\nWhen service meets the quality of food, this perfect match takes you beyond simply eating to a place of rapturous harmony...Yonaka delivered, providing more than a backdrop, but weaving  elevated and modern Japanese dishes into moments of wonder. Not afraid to put out new components on classic and trusted ingredients, Yonaka boldly presents a modern standard that is simply beautiful...bold enough to serve you Foie Gras Nigiri, the ingredients shine on their own. Our Omakase was selected from their most popular items and the specials of the day. \n\nThe setting is simple and modern, but their food and service command elegance. Parking is hectic, like any other popular eatery corner, thanks to the addition of Shang's and Very Berry Caf\u00e9, but still doable with a little patience."

Manager came by (Jax) she was nice chatted a bit. Hostesses, our waiter Michael took care of us.\nThey go a little too much into detail about what they are doing; I mean I don't really need to hear a lecture on condiments or what they recommend we do with the ginger or soy sauce, unnecessary chatter.\nBATHROOM: why? because which bathroom do you know has mouthwash to rinse your stinky onion and garlic chip breath after eating here? They do, cute setup.\nCOST/VALUE: Its moderately priced; some yelpers say its cheap or less than the norm, maybe if you eat 5pcs of sushi and drink ice water. But if you have an appetite, and drink, minimum youll blow is 50/person, so again not high not low average price.\nFOOD: When I eat sushi, I look at 4 things: 1)quality of fish 2)taste  3) presentation  4) originality\nTaste ===4.5 stars\nPresentation=4.5 stars\nquality of fish =4.5 stars\noriginality=6 stars (yes six out of 5)\n\nHeres what I ordered:\nTsukijji express: tuna ok, with avocado, just a standard item.\nAgemaki=deep fried with yellow tail, cilantro and asparagus, very good. Loved the black and orange colored sauce next to it. Actually their sauces are great, each dish seems to have its own one.\nMushroom wakame soup=order this soup. has 3 kinds of mushrooms in it, a tasty fish/musroom oily broth just amazing. Liked soup more than anything yes that good.\nCrudo=candied quinoa (not enough on it though should put a lot more) on top of sea bass, tasted awesome, with bursting cut heirlooms in the mix.\nAtlantic salmon with citrus slices underneath, I know sounds gross...until you eat it, wowzerz, good stuff.\nSuika Sakana=favorite and most original item. Who would put slices of jalapeno on top of tuna, then put chopped watermelon blocks underneath it, and make an ocean out of the plate base with basil oil? Just heavenly. Their fruits are super fresh and crisp.\nFried chicken bits=only item I didn't care for; chicken needs to be fried in a better method, it was very bland tasting chicken, even with the jalapeno slices and thin onion slices. doesn't taste fried, like the chili sauce they mixed with but doesn't save the chicken. Skip this.\nOh, they gave complimentary cantaloupe shot, wasn't crazy about that should be chilled but didn't mind it, nice gesture.\nDowned meal with 2 Asahi Blacks...excellent beer and frigid as always like all Japanese RR's.\nIf your staying in las vegas, this MUST be on your checklist.\nShockingly close, just take (from strip) flamingo and go up to past the 15 N/S ramps, keep going about 1-2 miles its on the left side after decateur, very easy to find, but be sharp. There is a separate lightless left turn that turns you right into the small lot. DO IT, don't think go there, and enjoy a great quiet tasty fruit and funky flavor-infused night.\n\nso, bottom line, I give the place for the food 4.5 stars, and the smiling faces make it 5. Minor flaws which are easily overlooked even by a sushi snob like me."

The waiter, Ken, said we could get items from the menu or we could select \"omakase,\" from the Japanese, literally 'respectfully leaving another to decide what is best.'  (in a Japanese restaurant) a meal consisting of dishes selected by the chef.  We had the five-course omakase.  First they brought us the  CRISPY BRUSSEL SPROUTS in a\u00a0lemon chili, mint sauce.  Then we got the SAKE ORENJI\nscottish salmon, orange supreme in a yuzu tobiko, orange oil  sauce.  Then we got the TORO\u00a0\u00a0-- bluefin tuna belly with walnuts, dried cherries and negi, piment d'espelette . Next we got the 12 piece sashimi with HAMACHI / YELLOWTAIL, SAKE / SCOTTISH SALMON, \u00a0HOTATE / SEA SCALLOPS, Fish Roe and something else I didn't recognize.  Those scallops were so fresh, like right out of the ocean and so tasty!  Then they brought out raw WAYGU BEEF, two sauces and a cooking stone to cook the beef to your liking.  Next we got a whole FLYING FISH -- it was deep fried to perfection -- love love loved it!  All of that was included in the omakase for $91 (for two).  But we added the MANGO dessert.  It was a mango pudding with a mango yolk inside plus mango ice cream, tiny sponge cake bits, mango chutney, cookies, special sauce and crushed nuts -- it was unbelievably delicious.  YUM!!!  \nThe restaurant is in the spot that my friend Josette Lablond had her French Bistro.  They took that restaurant and put some big bucks into creating a nice atmosphere."

            "review": "Soooo, we came here for New Year's Eve thinking we were fortunate to be part of their NYE Holiday omakase special, which proudly boasted a complimentary bottle of Prosecco!\n\nWhere to begin...\n\nWe arrived a little early, were seated right away. After one glance at the omakase menu (which surprisingly featured not sushi/sashimi as one would normally anticipate for an omakase experience, but brussels sprouts and cauliflour dashi as the first two courses) I asked the waiter if we were committed. He looked perturbed but offered us a menu. Moments later, he was back for a decision. Lots of empty tables, what's the rush? Odd.\n\nWe decide to continue with the omakase.  We felt at this quality of restaurant it would be a good to have a nice bottle of prosecco included, and the menu featured a kind of oyster (shigoku) I had never tried and was excited about tasting.\n\nWe also ordered a wakame mushroom soup as a kick-off to the omakase because it was cold out and the idea of a warm, earthy soup pleased us.  I was hoping for something more hearty and/or creamy, but it wasn't bad, just brothy and thin for my taste.\n\nWe research the prosecco as we're waiting because it isn't very good. Apparently, you can purchase a bottle of Cielo Prosecco 1908, Italy, 750ml, online for as little as $3. I believe it.\n\nBefore we could finish our soup, they brought out not one, but TWO of the omakase courses:\n\n1. Brussels sprouts (crispy with lemon chili, mint & rice puff): done quite nicely, citrus was just  right not to overpower, crispiness and rice puffs were perfect. Very well executed.\n\n2. Dashi (cauliflower dashi, golden beets, prosciutto & pearl onion). Pretty unremarkable, I took one bite and never revisited. I love every ingredient in this dish, but somehow they managed to marry them in a wholly unimpressive way.\n\n3. Sake Orenji (salmon, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, micro arugula). Good, but not earth-shattering (it's salmon, after all). Hub loves salmon but 2 days later, even with the reminder in print, it leaves no memory...\n\n4. Should have been Shigoku oyster topped with ceviche. They skipped it. \n\n5. Machi ringo (yellowtail, apple, fennel, sweet chili zu, negi). Yellowtail was swamped by the apple (trying too hard, too many ingredients). \n\nWaiter comes out, asks if we are ready for dessert. \nHuh? Not only are we only halfway through your 8 course menu, you've skipped the oyster. \nOh. We're out of those. \n(Insert my flat expression here)\n\nI say to the waiter that it would have been nice if he had shared this with us when he knew we were riding the fence about the omakase. I am highly aggravated at the poor planning and lack of information.\n\n4. Waiter brings us some crab concoction in spoons with a curried soup on the side. It bought no forgiveness for what I see as a HUGE snafu with the oysters. It wasn't just me: we heard several people at neighboring tables complaining about the oyster issue.\n\n6. Braised wagyu (soy-red wine braised sweet onion wagyu, seared foie gras, brioche). The foie gras was good, as foie gras tends to be. The wagyu was basically elevated pot roast, which is not quite what I expect when I sign up for omakase.\n\n7. Sake coco (scottish salmon, spicy coconut cream, bok choy, sweet chili). I had one bite and turned the rest over to the hub, who, as you'll recall, loves salmon. Salmon twice on the same omakase menu is unnaturally repetitive, Scottish or no.\n\nWaiter (again): asks if we're ready for dessert. I say I am, and I want an extra dessert to make up for your omission of the oyster snafu when you should have informed us. Also I love panna cotta. He agrees.\n\n8.  Whoopie pie (dark chocolate, peppermint crunch gelato, raspberry coulis). Not bad. I liked the peppermint gelato, nice finish. I should have ended on that note. My bad.\n\nWaiter returns, hub mentions something again about the oysters (but nicely). Waiter says, that's why I'm giving you an extra dessert. No, you're giving me an extra dessert because I asked for it as a concession, it wasn't your idea as a customer service move.\n\nMango panna cotta: I love mango. I love panna cotta. This dessert was singularly disturbing. Sour. Just bad. One bite, finis. And yes, I know: I asked for it.\n\nAt least the company was good.\n\n*As a final thought for the restaurant owners who may read this, we dined with you once before and had a much better experience with much better sushi, which is why we chose to visit you again on NYE. The NYE menu was forgivable, but the oyster snafu, the sub-par prosecco, and the apathetic service is what really undercut our experience."

Perfect cuts of fish fused with lemon herb oil and the heirloom tomatoes make this dish so good.\n\nKaraage-Fried chicken with mint, jalapeno, basil and onions.

The waiter could tell we weren't exactly sure what to order since there are so many options and he took the time to explain all the menu items to my mother who couldn't decide what to order. She asked a billion questions and he patiently answered every single random whim she had. \n\nWe came here because the reviews for the wagyu beef were highly recommended and it didn't disappoint! We were served a hot plate with the raw beef and you could cook the beef as well done or rare as you liked. The service was outstanding! Before our food came out, the waiter even gave us a complimentary dish from their omakase menu and it was so buttery and smooth. The rolls were just average but their sashimi was very light and airy. Their meat candy was the best dish hands down and it melted in my mouth with every bite. It was a little too rich and heavy though so I split it with my father who is a big meat lover. Overall it was a wonderful experience and I'm sure to come back whenever I visit Vegas!"

Thank God we had a hotel to go vomit in afterwards because that's what we did that night instead of going out. \n\nWe ordered the wagyu beef tartare and it was one of the best dishes I've ever had. Thought we were off to a good start. We also ordered a lot of sashimi and noticed a few of the fish were not fresh, especially the Toro which tasted like it had been frozen for six months and thawed out, not even completely. Worst toro I've ever had. The sea bream was sliced in front of us but when we ate it, it tasted a bit fishy. How long was that fish sitting outside before we ate it, I don't know, but it seemed like too long. It's a shame because the menu looks enticing & the reviews are mostly great, but to serve customers subpar fish forever bans me from coming back. Not to mention the food poisoning!\nOne star for the wagyu beef & amuse bouche, one star for the atmosphere."

Then topped off with a green tea  brownie with almonds.  We were scared there wasn't going to be enough food but it was perfect!!  Everything was perfect and tasted amazing!  The customer service was great and very efficient.  Jax took care of us and made sure everything was perfect.  Absolutely nothing to complain about.  They did an excellent job.

I don't remember everything we ate, but here are a few highlights.\n\nWe replaced one of the courses with the sake orenji since my friend really wanted me to try that. The salmon was fresh and the flavor was just so smooth.\nOne of the courses was fresh scallops served with a hot stone so we could sear it ourselves. I'm really into the whole interactive thing so I liked this, one of my favorites.\n\nAs we finished the cold courses, we were becoming intimidated by the remaining 5 hot courses. Our kind and friendly server even said she has rarely seen two people defeat the 11 courses, but we continued to convince ourselves by saying \"We got this!\" Once we got the tenth course, we became worried. It was.... a rice bowl. After all of that, we have to eat a bowl of rice?! It was a delicious uni rice bowl and we conquered that as well, but it took as a bit longer. Of course, we all have a separate stomach for dessert. Oh, sweet, delectable, dessert. We had an amazing mango panna cotta with mango sorbet.\n\nOnce we finished up the dessert, our bill came with a side of yuzu shortbread cookies (oh boy course #12). We also overheard the couple next to us rant about how they were so full after they were defeated by their 9 course meal and how they couldn't possibly imagine how even three people could finish the 11 course meal.\n\nSo worth."

You can't use her sudden inability against her because the names Yonaka created are not easy to remember. \n\nWe had a thirteen course omakase meal here, and all I  can say was that it's all fresh and delicious! \n\nI remember we had yellow tail, toro tuna, salmon, fish eggs, a whole fish with more slices of sushi (I forgot the name), pork belly, a grape salad, cantaloupe lollipops,  and a mango cott with ice cream and coffee for dessert. \n\nThe omakase was a wonderful experience for all of us. The sushi chef came out with his own unique sushi creations.  It is quality stuff served, unlike other places that serves fresh but not so high quality fish. You can actually taste the difference as the fish melts in your mouth while you chew. Believe or not, my favorite dish there was the non-sushi pork belly.  I'm usually not a big fan of fat pork belly. But this belly was marinated and cooked to perfection.  You barely needed to chew since it was already so tender.  The sauce used made it extraordinary delicious. \n\nI think the grape salad, the cantaloupe pop, and the mango cott are all standard feature items served to everyone who orders omakase. The pork belly, the types of sushi is based on the chef's preference. You will just need to leave it to the sushi chef and enjoy his surprises.  And that's what omakase is all about.\n\nThere was twelve of us, and the omakase was specially made for four people per table.  Our salads, desserts,  and sushi were the same.  Except when the whole fish came out,  we all had a different fish along with its meat. \n\nThe food presentation was magnificent. Everything I saw looked so good that it simply made me salivate. \n\nEach of us paid $60.00 for omakase.  I thought that was very reasonable as it also included drinks.\n\nThe restaurant was clean, it had a comfortable ambiance, and the service was superb. It was a perfect night.\n\nYonaka is definitely a five star sushi restaurant, and I will be back when I'm in Sin City."

The bluefin came out and disappeared like it was a magic trick. Each bite of the bluefin taste better than the other. The manager talked with us and offered recommendations what to eat. She told me about the scallop roll than the seared scallop I was going to order and quoted \"I have dreams about this roll\". So I gave it a chance. The roll was amazing and just melted in your mouth. \n\nIf your in Vegas, this is a must stop.

In a day and age where new age sushi bars are a dime a dozen and usually lacking in viable cultural substance, Yonaka is a breath of fresh air.  I get hamachi kama everywhere I go, and so far this is the only place in town that has made it right.  That in itself is a huge statement if you are familiar with the dish in its perpetually wonderful traditional preparation.  The classics and the fusion dishes are created and presented wonderfully, and don't forget that they are Japanese in doing so despite their modern twists.  I have had a few dishes that missed the mark here, but they are easily forgotten amongst the many great ones.  Love, love, love the atmosphere, and the management always seems present and involved in a non overbearing pleasant manner which is a huge plus.  The only thing I would cite for improment is confidence from some of the servers.  While some seem knowledgeable and comfortable, others seem nervous and unknowing.  Relax, you are serving great food.  Study up on sake and sushi a little and taking an order won't stress you out as much.  \n\nThanks for making such a great place.  Hope to be back soon!"

Yonaka is no exception except it's not a sushi restaurant.  They really do serve small raw fish plates and Japanese tapas.  That doesn't mean there isn't a roll or two out there but go in and ask for AYCE sushi and they will look at you funny.\n\nThey always start you off with a small bite right after you sit down.  I really like an amuse bouche to set the tone of what the chef is thinking and Yonaka's have always been good.  They pimp out their sake orenji quite a bit and this little Scottish Salmon dish is a winner.  Super fresh and the fish is clean and buttery.  The brussel sprouts are also popular but I have to say they are good but not miles past any other good bowl of sprouts you've probably had.  I do recommend the Omakase.  This provides the chef the option of serving whatever is fresh and new that day.  Our Omakase included some excellent flounder sushi (we ordered seconds), toro sushi, grilled lobster tail and pork belly.  The pork belly was great although super rich compared to the previous dishes.  That took a second to get used to.\n\nAll said, Yonaka is a great experience and with two solid visits under my belt I'm looking forward to visits 3, 4, 5...."

            "review": "I went back and forth on whether I should write this update. Ultimately, I decided that sharing observations, positive and negative, was more important than listening to the impulse to write off part of the meal as a fluke.\n\nYonaka Modern Japanese is still the same old restaurant with bold combinations of flavors, but they've recently added a lunch menu. In addition to a variety of sushi and some of their signature cold plates, they've added some hot plates that are a bit more casual and accessible for lunching. I'm not sure how well that experiment has worked with the public though.Even though it was a weekday and not peak lunch, it felt surprisingly empty with only one other party in the dining area.\n\nOh well, more time to catch up with my foodie friend. Seeing as how it was inexplicably her first time, I was more than happy to revisit their signature dishes while dipping into the new lunch items.\n\nBrussels sprouts ($6): a customer favorite that I actually hadn't tried before. Some of the brussels sprouts leaves deliberately pulled apart to make it a more salad-like experience, and there's a nice char that adds the right amount of bitterness With a sweet and sour dressing, crispy puffed rice, lemon chili, and mint, it's about as good a brussels sprouts dish as you can get without including pancetta or bacon.\n\nSake orenji ($11): it's what the Double-Double is to In-N-Out or the Foie& used to be to the Goodwich a long time ago. With luscious fresh salmon, delicious slices of orange supreme (which my friend explained is actually a cutting technique that's pretty wasteful), crunching yuzu tobiko, and acidic orange oil, it's still as harmonious and delicious as it was the first time.\n\n(On a side note, I was pleased to see that the spectacular sake kale dish from my last visit was available, It didn't feel right to order two salmon dishes in one meal though, so I'll have to wait until next time to taste it again.)\n\nUni To Ikura ($19): it's one of those dishes where everything is artfully piled atop each other. The dish's namesake items are a salty salmon roe that bursts in your mouth and a clearly distinguishable and sweet-in-a-seafood-y-way golden uni, but pay attention to the delicious sea scallop base, the kabocha (squash), the shiitake, and the oddly-non-citrus-y yuzu kosho. There are six pieces, so consider dissecting one with chopsticks and using the large serving spoon on the remainde(s). You can distinguish all the flavors separately and appreciate how they combine into a satisfying bite.\n\nHana Wings ($8): an appetizer of roughly five pieces of crunchy fish sauce wings and a garnish of atchara (pickled carrot and papaya). It was very good, and the spice from the chili seeds was appreciated, but I'm not convinced that it's quite on par with the Thai Caramel wings at Flock & Fowl.\n\nMiso Ramen ($11): here's where the meal fell apart a bit. I will disclaim that we allowed this to sit around a bit, so naturally the noodles soaked up a lot of broth. That means I can excuse the low broth levels and the noodle texture (in retrospect, surprisingly still chewy). The problem here is that the broth tasted like a light miso soup and not the rich miso broth that I'm accustomed to at Ramen Sora. Also, the noodles tasted bland, which I can't explain away, and the naruto and negi weren't anything special. The bright spots were the egg (more of a medium than the ideal soft boil, but still great) and the chashu (fatty and very flavorful), but they couldn't compensate for the aforementioned issues.\n\nKimchi fried rice ($10): it's a pretty solid dish. The tender, meaty pork belly and especially the fried egg really brought it home. I actually fried up another egg to enjoy with the leftovers because one egg in that sea of rice just isn't enough richness. Sadly, I didn't have extra pork belly sitting around. This dish could also use some sort of sweetness, or perhaps bacon. Unlike the ramen, this is just a couple layers of flavor away from being a spectacular dish, and that one egg gets spread too thin..\n\nYonaka will remain among my easier recommendations for a nice meal for foodies and special occasions. However, I just can't and won't vouch for their lunch-specific entrees, at least not until I've tried some different ones and had positive experiences. Stick to the cold plates or dinner items (at happy hour if possible) and you'll have a good time. My friend loved lunch, so I'll still call it a big success."

The HH menu had a huge selection which is awesome, and I really wished I could order everything, but my stomach space is limited. In my next life, I wish for a bottomless digestive system, and infinitely high metabolism. \n\nThe decor is very modern, zen, clean and fresh. I love the open sushi kitchen and sat right at the bar so I can star at big pieces of fish... no, it's not creepy at all! Everything I got, all 6 items were 2nd to none in both taste and presentation! I love the beautiful plating which shows the tender love and care that went into the dish. I did not use a single drop of soy sauce as the flavors were already explosive. Highly recommend the coconut ceviche, hamachi chili, and the toro belly roll. The Tsusumi was also amazing twist on the sisig served with very fresh lettuce!\n\nService was great, and I love how my waitress explained every dish and the ingredients when she brought them to me. The sushi chefs were very friendly and chatted with me. Highly recommend this place! I will be back very soon!"

A beautiful setting with its modern clean lines, colors and decor...very fresh looking. We decided to sit at the sushi bar, because I wanted to see the preparation of the sushi.  However, this is not a sushi bar you start ordering.  First, we were brought hot wet towels to wash our hands.  Then, Michael, our waiter, explained the philosophy behind the menu and pointed out a few popular dishes. Then as we got our complimentary \"bite\", Jax, the Manager, explained that with each bite we eat we should try to get a bit of all the component of the dish. At first it seemed like the explanations were a little excessive, but without those explanations I am not sure I would have gotten the full experience or appreciation for the detailed and intentions of plating of each dish. \n\nHere are a few details that make this a 4 vs 5;  these are just preferences.  I am always cold at restaurants, but my husband for once in his life felt chilly. The wine glasses were small and only filled slightly above half way so at an average of $8/glass for ordinary wine (yet well selected), I expected more wine, not much more but another ounce would be good. However, the bottle selection and pricing was very good.   Not a complaint from me about menu because it is low carb friendly, but my husband was craving some noodles or udon (probably because he was cold), and there wasn't any on the menu.  While I do appreciate the subtle flavor of fish, I did feel I needed a touch of soy sauce, which they brought out upon request.\n\nAbout the food, my husband got the shrimp tempura and  5-piece sushi omekase  (toro, salmon, halibut, and hamachi, ) and I started with the uni to ikura special...which was so pretty I didn't want to eat it, well ok, for 10 seconds I just look at it.  My first bite, I was surprised at the unusual, but pleasant combination of  kombucha squash puree, citrus, mushrooms,  ikura  and uni...it was sublime. My husband got a spicy tuna roll, he appreciated the price is comparable to run of the mill sushi joints, and the tuna to rice ratio made it a great value.  I ordered the kama; they were right, it was the best kama I've ever had. \n\nThe prices were very reasonable, especially given the portion and quality.  Service was genuinely attentive yet professional.  Can't wait to come back, but definitely with a thicker sweater."

Best decision ever. \n\nEverything we ordered this most recent time was delicious, with a few dishes clearly being the rock stars.\n\nDishes we LOVED and ended up ordering a second round of: \n\n1. Sake Orenji - such beautiful, generous slices of fatty salmon in a bath of tangy sauce with tangerine slices to complement. Yuzu and orange heaven!! \n\n2. Uni to ikura - I LOVEEEEEE UNI AND SCALLOPS. And this dish was perfection. It combined everything I loved in a simple way that still made every component distinct and delicious. Slices of uni topped off each piece, complemented by scallops, salmon roe, Yuzu, etc. I loved how each of the components still preserved it's seafoody sweetness, and wasn't at all overwhelmed by the sauce/other seafood. \n\n3. THE MANGO COTTA!!! I am going to get this every single time from now on. Mango pudding that is filled with mango sauce, paired with mango sorbet, sesame mochi pieces, and Yuzu cookies. The description in the menu does not do it justice. Such a party of flavors and textures for your tongue and your tummy. This dessert was phenomenal!! \n\nOther delicious dishes:\n1. Gyuyaki - realllllyyyy interesting and delicious combo of beef, avocado, almond beer butter, and more! Lots of flavor that will leave you wanting more! \n2. Fat duck - rich and delicious foie gras roll! \n3. Allllll the sashimi! \n\nDecent dishes that we probably won't be priority next time: \n1. Sinuglao\n2. Machi Ringo\n3. Crispy sake - pretty common at other top notch Japanese restaurants. Still delicious, but didn't come close to the wow factor of other dishes here! \n\nOne of my favorite Japanese places EVER. I would pay any price for this and am so ridiculously happy that this place is so reasonably priced. We ordered at least 20 dishes on the menu plus 2 large orders of sake, and the meal came out to be around $300 (including tax and tip)!!! WOWWWWW!"

Within a two-hour time frame, we were served various dishes, ranging from cold plates to hot plates, enough for 4 people to share. In between, we were given palate cleansers as well as a complimentary dessert even after the 11th course.\n\nIt was a tasting adventure indeed. The plates brought out were small, but diverse and rich with flavor. It was necessary to eat slow and enjoy the concoctions, to truly savor each bite! I tried everything that was given to us, but I personally did not care for the cold plates. (Mostly because I'm not a big sushi aficionado at all.) The hot plates, for me, were where it was at!\n\nHere are some of my favorite dishes:\n\nMACHI UNI: hamachi, sea urchin, ikura, koshihikari, shiitake, green onion, baby bok choy. I think I got excited that there was a course with rice in it...asian alert! and it was my first time trying sea urchin! So bomb -- a plethora of texture, flavorful. \n\nLOBSTER: Mmm! Served with bread rolls which reminded me a lot of malasadas. It was so good to dip them in the lobster sauce. So succulent.\n\nSAKE COCO: salmon in a coconut curry with cherry tomatoes, bok choy.

The whole plate is simply divine!\n\nOur complimentary dessert were soft sea salt caramels, and that was a nice cherry on top to this dinner journey.

They don't have a liquor licence, so the only thing missing was creative cocktails, but the Nigori sake was a rather pleasant quaff.  Don't let the milky appearance put you off; it's a gorgeous smooth drink, and quite a large measure for the $3 happy hour price!  Oh, and it didn't sit right with me that the drinks menu included such low-rent yellow fizz as Bud Light (really?  Who would have Bud flipping Light with this food?  I don't get that).  Minor quibbles that really don't take away from my 5-star rating because the food is enough to get there.  At first glance, it seems a little expensive, but, as I've said before on Yelp, we get what we pay for.\n\nAnd so to the food.  Oh, my stars!  The fooooood!!!  I frankly don't think the people dissing the food for too many flavors are totally sane.  All of the flavors were subtle and beautifully balanced.  Trying to balance a slice of dehydrated pear, toasted almond, dehydrated fig, leafy herb thingy, and pesto-y sauce on a piece of hamachi sashimi slippery with house-made fish oil sauce and getting it all to the mouth with chopsticks was admittedly not an easy venture, but it was worth the slapstick effort on the first chew when flavor explosions of sheer delight decorated the palate with joy!  We had the Omakase 8 courser, which is a tasting menu that changes according to the chef's creative whims on the day.  There was nothing in it that we didn't love or at least like very very much.  With each mouthful of an eclectic mix of flavors, some that appeared really incongruous, like the amuse bouche strawberry with fish sauce (say what?!), salt, pepper, and some funny little leaves that I can't remember the name of, we MMMMM'd and rolled our eyes in pure delight at each new flavor sensation. The portion sizes were very reasonable, and we were satisfied without being overstuffed, even after the to-die-for chocolaty dessert concoction, which was the perfect conclusion to an outstanding meal. \n\nThe service was generally good, if a bit...what's the word?  Juggly?  We seemed to have a different server for each course.  It just seemed slightly strange, but everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Our courses came out mostly in excellent time, not too slow, not too fast, with plenty of time to savor each course and let its moment pass whilst enjoying each other's company.  \n\nWe couldn't figure out why it wasn't busier at late night happy hour (it was steady but not packed) on a Friday night (maybe location?  maybe no liquor licence?  maybe the word hasn't gotten out yet?). I hope it picks up because this is going to be one of my go-to places for beautiful food.  \n\nYataaaaaa, Yonaka!!! :)"

They were actually pretty busy for the 3 or so hours we were there and rightfully so.\n\nThis was our first time here and thankfully got some great advice from Nelson Q. on what to order. Per his suggestions, we started off with the crispy brussel sprouts and avocado nigiri. He was dead on and we absolutely loved both! I believe this was the first time I've ever purposely ordered brussel sprouts, but if every restaurant served them like this, I'd get them all the time. It's packed with flavor and the mint adds a slightly refreshing feel to it. The description mentions lemon chili and while the lemon was definitely there, I didn't really get any type of chili. Don't get me wrong, these things are absolutely delicious and addicting but I think they could benefit from a bit more heat and a touch more salt as well.\n\nThe second suggestion was for the avocado nigiri and it was even more impressive then the brussel sprouts. We liked them so much that we ended up ordering about 8 pieces on top of the other food we got. They are small but with a happy hour price of just $1, they're a steal. There's so much flavor in these things! You get a little sweetness with just the right amount of saltiness and the rice is cooked perfectly. It may look and sound like a simple item but if you come here, you can't leave without trying one...or 4! \n\nWe also ordered some tea brined ribs and I got a lipa roll for myself since the wife doesn't do seafood. The ribs were super tender and tasty but too sweet for my taste. I loved the lipa roll and can't wait to go back for some other rolls. Then to finish off we had what I believe was a version of their Kanmi. Once again, just bursting with flavor and while there was much more there, it was really like a bananas foster on steroids to me. So, so good!\n\nYonaka not only offers great food but some of THE best service I've ever received. Every single employee who came to our table was super friendly and made sure we were taken care off, had full drinks, etc. We also had the pleasure of having Jax come to our table several times. She was enthusiastic, friendly and I loved how she and the other servers explain the dishes to you. It was an amazing dining experience and I'm itching to go back already!"

My husband and I went during happy hour (which runs 5pm-6:30pm and 11pm-2am) and spent a mere $55 (plus a well-earned 20% gratuity) on six small plates, two glasses of wine and a beer. We were stunned by the quality and inventiveness of the menu at this price point. It's icing on the proverbial cake that the service was highly attentive and the modern decor was gorgeous."

When I visit a place as amazing as Yonaka...I'm speechless!?!   This is such an adorable space.  The food combinations are smart and leave me wanting to go back again and again.  Service was wonderful and our waiter was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about everything on the menu.  Plating is so thoughtful and elegant.  If you are a fan of Japanese, or just good food, I definitely recommend.  My only complaint?  There is no Yonaka near my house!!"

Yum.\n\n-Sake Orenji: Scottish Salmon on top of a bed of oranges, with a bit of yuzu and tobiko sauce.  So refreshing.\n\n-Toro: Elegantly presented and topped with walnuts and dried cherries.  I love this dish.\n\n-12 Pc Sashimi: There were pieces of the scallop, yellowtail, salmon, tuna, flounder, and another that I can't remember.\n\n-Ishiyaki: we sered our own pieces of wagyu beef on a hot stone, then sprinkle some lemon salt on it, or dipped it into the ponzu or mushroom sauce.  \n\n-Deep fried flying fish: Another beautifully plated dish.  So beautiful that I didn't want to eat it.  But I did.  \n\n-Mango Dessert: This is just delicous (and again, beautifully plated).  The mango jello-ish pudding contained mango yolk, and once we dug into it, the yolk runs out of this pudding just like an egg yolk.  I particularly enjoy the light cracker like cookies that accompanied it.  There were just so many interesting elements to this dessert.  I would go back just to have this dessert, but then I probably wouldn't be able to stop myself from ordering other delicious dish."

I havent tried all of them but I order these every time i've been there. \n\nYonaka didnt get a 5 star rating from me cause there are some dishes that will disappoint you. As well as a very slow service. So don't eat here if youre in a rush.( I was here with only 3 other tables and it was still slow) I ordered my beef tongue when i sat down and it didnt come until an hour+ later. Dont get me wrong, it's DELICIOUS and i'll order it everytime but does it really take an hour to make it!?\n\n I just think that this place would taste a lot better if it ran a lot smoother. I'm usually the one telling my mom to be patient but when I get antsy I know it has been awhile. \n\nBottom line theres some great stuff here that it warrants five stars but the cons dropped it to four."

The remaining items we ordered came and we finished it but could not get that sake orenji out of our minds so we ordered another one. And plan to go back again today! Love it.

I am always up for a unique dining experience and this place just blew my mind!\n\nAfter this appeared on my radar, having seen my yelpster pals Misty Y, Lisa R, Tony T, Terry R and new friend Arvin C and all the reviews, I was raring to go!\n\nThe tough thing about going to a restaurant with your hopes high, is that it is sure to be difficult to meet the standards that you create in your mind, going in already expecting a lot.\n\n1.  Location - Oddly located on the SouthWest corner of Decatur and Flamingo, near a tire outlet. Plenty of parking, easy to find.\n\n2.  Ambiance - Modern, clean, warm, good flow, a nice way to enter and go, okay, I am gonna like the place.\n\n3.  Service - The best!  From the greeter, to the server to even the owner Jax coming out to say hi, you immediately feel you have just been seated in a first class seat!.  I mentioned to Jax that Arvin C highly recommended this place and said hi and she was really cool and appreciates yelp.\n\n4.  Busy Factor - OK, you all need to go to this place NOW.  I went there on Saturday for a 6:30 dinner and it was not too busy. I can tell you, this place is gonna be swamped in the future, so go NOW.  They also have some \"happy hour\" specials where the food is cheaper.\n\n5.  FOOD!!! - So, you can imagine first of all, I eat basically everything, not fear factor stuff, but I enjoy great food. I was blown away regardless of my already high expectations.  My recommendation is to order from the appetizers, cool plates and hot plates to gain a new perspective on Japanese Food and exquisite dining.  Order from  all their specials too!\n\na.  Grilled Edamame - I never had it grilled, only boiled and salted in the past. What a nice and delicate flavor!\n\nb.  Crispy Brussel Sprouts - What the heck, is this a brussel sprout or the most amazing vegetable dish that any carnivore would love!   If they made all veggie dishes like this, the cows would all be safe.\n\nc. Shioyaki Saba - A great mackerel, just right.\n\nd.  Kurudochikin - Fried Chicken with ikura and kabocha ginger. Watch out Col. Sanders!\n\ne.  Pokuyaki - Kurobuta pork belly. I am not sure if I was in love with the pork or the granny smith apple, dehydrated Fennel and puree or what, but man was my porky belly enjoying this puppy.\n\nf.  Ishiyaki - Now, I have had teppanyaki, teriyaki, shioyaki and my old favorite robatayaki, but never cooking on a stone.  We had the beef and it was delicate, and it was the perfect way to cook it.\n\ng.  Live uni - What the heck, I thought that the stuff served in sushi was already live, judging from how it wiggled and jiggled.  So when I was shown the live uni, I had to have it. And, most of my guests I was with are not uni lovers like I am, we were all amazed.  OK, amazed that they tried it, I really enjoyed it. Flavorful, light, delicate.  A great mixture of natural taste and great texture.  And, if you have never seen live uni, it comes in some freakin porcupine like shell thing and served with it, so it is also FUN.\n\nh.  Nana Iro - Ii am thinking, is this Grandma Iro??? Named a food after your nana?  Well it is Yellowtail.  And, it is served with grapefruit, avocado, tomatoes, fennel.  What an explosion of tastes for my little buds.\n\ni.  Iroha - OK, this is salmon.  I am not sure if I was more impressed with the salmon, or the candied quinoa,\n\nj.  Irodori - Big Eye Tuna - with fennel and pistachio no less.  My eyes were getting big too.\n\nk.  Dessert - I don't care if you are on a diet or what, order it and share. I don't even remember what I had, I stopped taking notes. \n\nl.  Price - Are you kidding me?  I feel like I just got the deal of the century. I would pay a lot more for this place, and now know that I have been overpaying at many other places!\n\nAll I can say is that when you think of first class, of quality , this place is extraordinary when it comes to ambiance, quality of staff, freshness of food, and a savory otherness when it comes to texture and taste.  I am not sure what impressed me more, however, I believe the texture to me so outstanding that it far exceeded most of my experiences in life so far throughout 6 continents of traveling!"

Ordinary cooking employs concepts one may find in chemistry while molecular gastronomy uses physics principles to construct the food to the desired texture, taste, shape, colors, etc. Here you'll experience food that went through processes such as compression and dehydration, or perhaps food cooked at various temperatures atypical to traditional cooking techniques. But before I started to sound like an ad executive writing a promotion for a client, I will just go straight to the food we tasted.\n\nBeet salad - Wow! The presentation alone deserves five star, seriously! On the plate sat four or five pieces of cooked yellow beets wedged between dehydrated and wafer-thin slices of green apple; all of the ingredients piled atop a layer of the most creamiest and delicious white dressing. This is not a salad. This is dessert!!! It is THAT good.\n\nYellowtail sushi - Really fresh yellowtail. Normally I prefer my fish pieces to have a slight drop of lemon or lime on them. This tasted like a piece of plain but very fresh fish so over all, not bad.\n\nCrudo - This is a big roll of sea bass sushi. I tried one little piece of it and I thought it was good but nothing super special.\n\nMidori salad - My friend ordered this so I tried it. You'll find square pieces of crunchy pear and green leaves all dressed in a nice acidic dressing. It's really refreshing and light.\n\nVarious other fish sushi - We also ordered four or five other pieces of fish sushi but I didn't get the names. They were all really fresh. \n\nOne thing we didn't get is the dessert. Perhaps this beckons another visit at a later time. For sure!"

I am a firm believer that we all have personal preference and have different likes and dislikes but even then, I am baffled by their 4.5 average rating based on +600 reviews for this place. I don't think so.\n\nI must say, the service here was impeccable. Our server gave us a quick run-down for the entire menu and suggested several dishes for us. \n\nHe then asked what drinks we wanted so I simply said water. He then asks, \n\n\"What kind of water?\" \n\n....um, what kind of water? The one where two hydrogens are covalently bonded to oxygen? The liquid that make up 60% of adult human being? \n\nYeah, I was confused as mofo. My company laughed out loud but he then gave us the option of sparking water, flat water or regular water. I've never been asked this question before. As simple as ordering a plain water can be complicated here. Or perhaps this is what it's like to order water at fine dining establishment? I don't even know. \n\nSeemed like their specialty was sushi so we selected omakase for 5pc sushi as well as few other rolls to try out. It was nothing special. I did like how everything we ordered were presented beautifully. However, they packed so much rice on nigiri I wondered if I was eating nigiri or simply just rice. Overpriced for what they serve if you ask me. \n\nI also want to note that I was the only Japanese patron during the visit. I always know a restaurant serves good Japanese food when the place consist of 30-50% Japanese patron. I must take in consideration that this place is called modern, meaning they do not serve traditional Japanese dishes that I was craving. But I find it questionable by their name \"Yonaka\" which translates to midnight, but they are open for lunch? Why don't you just open for night time like a normal izakaya especially when you call yourself \"midnight\"??? Clearly, I am not a fan of modern, Americanized Japanese food but I am overall disappointed by the food they serve."

We didn't have any reservations, but that wasn't a problem as there were plenty of tables available. \n\nMy friends decided to come here based off of Yelp reviews. They were expecting common Americanized sushi rolls like rainbow, dragon, and california rolls. Now, Yonaka definitely had rolls, but none that they really recognized. I opted for the 5 piece Sushi Omakase. I love being surprised! I really can't recall the fish that I had, but you really can't go wrong with this. Everything was surprisingly fresh (being in Las Vegas and all) and very tasty. I liked that they only included small drops of soy sauce. There is no way I could overpower the fish with the sauce and I think just that tiny bit of sauce brought out more of the flavor of the fish. Excellent! \n\nMy friends ordered some rolls that I didn't get to try, but they left unsatisfied. They didn't want to order anymore as it would have been too expensive. They wanted more bang for their buck. \n\nWe also ordered a bottle of TY KU Coconut Sake. This went down extremely smooth. \n\nThe marketing manager came out to speak with us and explained their concept - how they strive to modernize their dishes and incorporate non-traditional ingredients for a great balance of flavors. I really didn't feel like I experience that in my dish, but they provided a complementary after dinner appetizer which exemplified their concept. It was chopped apple and pears in a lemony fish sauce. Sounds weird, but totally works. We all loved it. \n\nI loved the decor. Very classy and modern. I love the wood paneling and the wood blocks at both ends of the room. Great place for a date."

Then, you take a moment or two to admire the colors, the texture, and the usage of the dimensions of the plate. \n\nThe FLAVOR.\nOMG! As if the presentation didn't take your breath away, the taste will just do the opposite. You will find out you have way more taste buds than you realize after taking a nibble of any of their choices whether its an appetizer, main entr\u00e9e, or dessert. They even give you a complimentary palette cleanser to keep your tongue in check from the multiple flavors you will encounter. \n\nNow you're probably wondering what I ordered. Well, im still trying to figure that out too! I have been here twice. The first time me and the wifey ordered the 6 course Omakase which consisted of 6 of the popular favorite dishes. The second time, we did the Happy Hour from 5 to 6:30. If you refer to my pics, I have each one identified. If I actually typed up each thing, I will never get this review done. I will leave it up to you to decide what you think. Im just merely guiding you to this place. You know, you can lead a horse to water and so on.\n\nBut wait, if you go and eat here now, as a bonus, you will get some seriously awesome service! Your drinks will constantly be refilled, plates picked up when you are done, and then on to the next course.\n\nHow's that for a synopsis? Again, just when you think this review is over, they not only give you great service, but the overall d\u00e9cor of the place will astound you! Did I also mention the bathroom? Its very nice. What's that word to describe the ambiance of this place? Oh yeah, its very MODERN.\n\nLastly, if you want to make a good first impression and want to be adventurous whether its your friends, family or that awkward first date, this place will impress them. I know I was with my first impression which brings me back to my intro. Once you try this place, you will know why I said what I said. Cheers!"

See my pictures below.  An piece of apple on a spoon with fresh fennel and jelly eggs served over tea.   The server told us we were supposed to eat the apple while also drinking the tea.  It was fun.   Very delicious.  They also brought one for my daughter so I had two. Lol. \n\nWe ended up ordering the brussels sprouts and shrimp tempura for apps.  I liked the brussels sprouts more than I thought I would!  \n\nWe also ordered the pokuyaki.  Pork with apples and dried fennel. Presentation was nice, I had to admire their great job before eating it.  Very yummy. \n\nI ordered the 5 piece nigiri omakase.  The chef picked five fresh pieces of fish for me to try.  Bluefin tuna from Spain, yellowtail, salmon belly, flounder, and something I cannot pronounce.  The last two were different and new to me but I enjoyed them all. \n\nI ordered 1 piece of Uni. So fresh, so creamy.  A sushi spot that has good uni to me means they are the real deal. \n\nLast but not least, the sake orenji!!  Get two of these.  Sooooo dammnn good.   Thick fresh slices of salmon on top of mandarin oranges, tobiko on top, served on orange oil.  My mouth is watering just thinking of it. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the greenies.  Green tea brownie on pistachio coffee soil with green tea ice cream and strawberry mint ice cream.  It also came with \"strawberry soup\".  Wow looks nice, tasted great!  \n\nBe back soon, Yonaka!"

The food is playful.  A fusion of Japanese / Peruvian / Argentinian cuisine popularized by Nobu Matsuhisa.  From the flavors to the presentation, this is the poor man's Matsuhisa (Beverly Hills, LA).  Oh yeah, it's good!\n\nDishes deliver a punch.  No monochromatic plates here.  Bold flavors that try to push the boundaries of sweet, sour, bitter in a single dish.  Excellent use of texture.  It is not uncommon to have a deep fried leaf sitting atop a piece of delicate fish.\n\nOrder an assortment of small plates and share.  \n\nI won't ruin the \"joy of discovery\", besides the menu changes as specials come and go.  One day, teriyaki foie nigiri topped with candied quinoa, live uni another,   The menu staple, deep fried Brussels sprouts with lemon, chili, mint, and puffed rice is amazing.  It looks a mess but as a dish, it's comforting. Vegetal, sweet, sour, bitter; the perfect match to beer.  Ingredients are fresh and seasonal.\n\nAll nigiri sushi comes with a twist.  A sauce of this, an unusual garnish of that (hamachi with a spicy jalape\u00f1o miso and a cilantro leaf; unagi with togarashi and a leaf of Thai basil).  The rice is good and the fish fresh. Go crazy, order one of each.\n\nService is very good; friendly and attentive.  Prices are very reasonable.  Two happy hours (17:00-18:30 / 23:00-02:00) make it even more inviting.\n\nOne of the best in Vegas on or off the Strip."

First, our waitress was extremely knowledgable and knew everything about the menu and really guided us through the experience. The general manager was also amazing; giving us a background on who they are and what they're trying to accomplish. It made the whole experience feel very personal. She mentioned that this was the kind of restaurant you would enjoy the most if you came in with an open mind, which we did. \n\nThe tastes were really unlike anything we've had before. I highly recommend this place! (I actually started writing this review last year and just realized I never finished it.

We ordered the Brussel sprouts since that's what so many people suggested based on the reviews. They didn't have much flavor & tasted charred. They brought a side of sauce which made it better but not great . We had the Lida roll which was decent but really dry. Our server told us that the chef doesn't liked to put lots of sauce on the rolls. I don't like lots of sauce but I also don't like choking on something dry. The edamame was ok, I've had way better. The daily special of something coconut ceviche was lackluster. The tuna didn't taste like it was good quality, def didn't taste any coconut & overall it wasn't very flavorful. We had another roll Okura(sp)? and it was just ok. It needed more miso sauce since it was very dry as well. For the record I'm not a mayo roll kinda girl. I also don't like feeling like what I'm swallowing won't go down. I've eaten sushi all over the world & I'm totally down with eclectic Japanese fusion (or whatever they call it). But this place was way off the mark. I grew up in the restaurant biz so I'm thankful to have had the privilege of knowing what good quality food is. I give this place props for trying something diff but they need to do something about adding more flavor to their dishes. I left feeling empty. I will say that we had a humorous server which helped make the dryness a lil more palatable but not enough to warrant another visit to this establishment nor would I recommend it to friends."

This elegant little cafe with the simple decor is obviously well loved because it filled up rapidly.\nMy husband took me out for a special dinner. When Julie our server started to describe the special 8 course omakase we both swooned, picked ourselves up from off the floor, looked each other in the eyes and, in perfect Meg Ryan style moaned the word \"Yes!\" (But silently.)\nThere were five cool plates starting with a mouth cooler of watermelon with fish sauce and basil. Outstanding!\nThe salmon orenji was first, followed by yellowtail, richly spiced tuna with peppers, avocado and garlic chips, flounder, and bluefin. Two hot plates were amazing wagyu beef skewers and twice baked pork belly with fabulous sauce. Another palate cleanser was frozen seasoned canteloupe cubes!!\nI cannot do it justice- you must go!!\nThe only drawback was a table of loud people who were playing with an Apple watch and ringing their phones. They also ate like 3 recently freed hungry inmates from Corcoran with their loud mouths open as they chewed, but thankfully they did not have 8 courses.\nI love that Yonaka tables are spaced well enough apart that one is not picking the crispy rice out of the next guy's beard from being too close.\nService is energetic and committed, food is divine and creative, and do not skip the crispy brussels sprout appetizers."

When I first looked at the menu, some of the flavor combinations were similar to that found in fine dining places. The prices, however, were not quite that of fine dining.\n\nThe strip-mall like entrance did not help my initial perception of this establishment.\n\nBut once you're in, you are greeted with a decor that is truly contemporary. The wait staff members are all sharply dressed, but since it's Vegas, casual attire is always accepted. \n\nI don't remember what we ordered exactly as it's been a few months. I do remember that the flavors are truly done well here. I've always thought that a dish is cooked or prepared properly if you can properly dissect the flavors. For the most part, this place indeed succeeds in that respect.\n\nThere are a few misses in terms of the ingredient combinations. I remember trying a roll whose flavors didn't quite jive. However, the raw fish in their rolls is very fresh, so if a given piece of a roll as a whole does not fit your taste buds, you can always eat the components separately and still be rewarded with fresh ingredients. The same freshness can be had with their warm dishes as well.\n\nIn terms of portions, the individual dishes can be best described as super-sized tapas that can easily be shared between two or perhaps three people. \n\nMy friend and I paid $50 per person not including drinks but including gratuity. We ordered at least seven dishes and were very stuffed. For food of this caliber, it was well worth it.\n\nMy next trip to the Vegas area will definitely include a stop at this restaurant. The New York City area may have establishments similar in appearance and/or name, but I have yet to see a \"Modern Japanese\" restaurant in the NYC area that is as true to its name as Yonaka is."

The restaurant is brightly lit and has a modern, upscale cafe feel so I'm not sure it would make for a great date place like some of the other yelpers have suggested. As far as the rest of the ambiance goes...and I know that Yonaka can't control it's clientele, but there was a family with a small child dining in the restaurant and a good number of that group had on sweat pants, pajamas and slippers. Really? It definitely took away from the Saturday night experience were shooting for. \n\nWhen we were seated the restaurant manager came to our table and instructed us on how to eat the food. Fine. But then she insisted that she new my \nboyfriend. She asked him what he did for a living, if he wore glasses, etc. The abrasive questioning went on for an uncomfortable length of time. It was very strange. In spite of the weirdo start, the wait stuff was awesome. They were knowledgable and overall helpful and friendly. \n\nSo moving on to our order...we started off with the fried octopus. No bueno. It was tough, rubbery, soggy, oily and worst of all, terribly salty. I couldn't eat it. It was the kind of heavy salt that stings your mouth a little bit. My boyfriend, who is a salt fiend, even commented on how salty the food was. We went on to try the scallops that cook yourself on the hot rock, the tuna/jalapeno/watermelon dish, a few of the salmon sushi options and their tempura veggie/hashbrown dish. The fried veggie/hasbrown was, again, heavy on the salt and greasy. All of the other dishes we tried were awesome. Beautiful textures and fresh flavors that were a treat to eat. \n\nI can't say I won't be back to Yonaka, there are still a few more options that I'd love to try. But I'll stay away from the fried options."

Oh and they have their own twist on their plates but it was yummy! Their Scotland salmon special (don't know what it was called) surely was the best salmon I've ever had. The mandarins and the sauce fit together perfectly. The foie gras was also awesome!.."

            "review": "This is the type of establishment that makes me want to start writing more Yelp reviews.  For the quality of the food, creativity, and value, Yonaka is truly a gem!  My boyfriend and I came in on a quiet Sunday evening, and the emptiness almost scared us away. Good thing we stayed, because our dining experience was phenomenal!\n\nWe ordered a few items off their happy hour menu (5-6:30pm), daily specials menu, and regular menu.  They started us off with a complimentary appetizer: a Kumato wedge lightly seasoned and so, so flavorful.  My boyfriend ordered $3 sake drinks off their happy hour menu, and while I'm not much of a drinker, he seemed to really enjoy it, especially for the price.\n\nOther items we ordered:\n\nBeet fries - beets had a good sweet flavor, the creamy dipping sauce complemented it well\n\nSake orenji - slices of salmon (think carpaccio) on top of orange slices, topped with yuzu-infused fish roe and micro greens, swimming in a sea of citrus-y oils...I love citrus flavors with salmon, so I absolutely adored this dish!!  It's a must-have for me :)\n\nHotateyaki - another favorite!  Grilled scallops with tomatillo and grapefruit slices, lightly dressed in a fruity vinaigrette, with creme fraiche and edible flowers. Both delicious and a beautiful presentation!\n\nPork belly sliders - I forgot what it was called exactly, but the sliders were made with Chinese steamed white buns, with pork belly, apple slices, kimchi, pickled carrots/daikon, and cilantro.  The flavors reminded me of a Chinese-Vietnamese-Korean fusion.\n\nCompressed watermelon with mint - really refreshing!  The restaurant started getting crowded, and gave us this plate on the house as an apology for the wait between dishes.\n\nSalmon belly - fresh salmon belly sashimi on a bed of ice.  Lovely presentation and rich flavor.\n\nLime-infused ahi with leek puree - I don't remember the exact name but it was on the daily specials menu--this dish NEEDS to be on the regular menu because it's SO good!! The ahi was really fresh with a light citrus taste.  It was accompanied by kumatoes, leek puree, candied onion, and some sumac.  Probably my favorite dish of the night!\n\nDessert time!  We ordered 2 desserts because we were excited to discover more of Yonaka's creativity, and because I love desserts :)\n\nChokoreto - a bar of chocolate on a plate with avocado cream, an avocado chip, cookie crumbles, and a lime sorbet.  The rich creamy flavor of avocado complements the chocolate well, and the sorbet helps cut the richness with some tart flavor.\n\nRingo lico - when they brought the plate, I thought it looked like a mini alien landscape! There was a cube of grapefruit panna cotta, with pistachio pieces, pistachio butter, dehydrated fennel, slices of grapefruit and kumquat, and apple sorbet.  Despite my misgivings about how the flavors would work out, this dish pleasantly surprised me!  The pistachios really stand out and help bring together the other ingredients.  Definitely try this one!\n\nThe servers were very friendly, and took the time to explain every dish to us.  Yonaka is a very creative restaurant that really lives up to their title of \"Modern Japanese\".  I saw mostly young hip patrons during my visit, but I hope more people will be open to trying it and discovering for themselves the wonderful dining experience that Yonaka offers.  As for myself, I will definitely look forward to my next visit at Yonaka Modern Japanese :)"

            "review": "Food is about soul, but it is also passion and ambition and when you can translate that into what you present then you are onto something.\n\nWe start off with a amuse of a compressed watermelon, with thai basil, pepper and a bit of fish sauce. Nice, fresh and herbaceous. \n\nWe went during happy hour, but we ordered these off the new/specials menu and it was worth their price -\n\nHotate Kinoko (Hokkaido sea scallops, cauliflower, morels, pistachio, grapefruit $16) - the scallops were nice sized and very fresh. I liked the texture play of this one and depending on what you combine together it can be like eating a different dish. Cauliflower, mushrooms and scallops is always a trifecta combo for me that I do at home so you see how that wins, then the pistachio and grapefruit wasn't expected, but made sense.\n\nGyu Rame (wagyu, halibut cheek, orange supreme, peach herb puree and gelee fish sauce) The wagyu was really tender and went very well with the gelee fish sauce and the peach herb puree. I've never had halibut cheek, but it was much meatier than I expected, and went well with the puree. Nice take on surf and turf. \n\nYuzu To Kaki (shigoku oyster, yuzu sorbet, pickled shallots, thai basil) - 3 small oysters, but top notch freshness and the toppings on it was perfect. I just wish there were 4 as splitting a 3rd was a bitch. \n\nThese were off the Happy Hour ( 5-630pm, and 11pm-2am ), \n\nCrudo (japanese seabass, kumato, candied quinoa, ikura, lemon herb oil) - I liked the use of green varietal kumato tomato in this. There was jalapeno and I bit into a few that made it spicy. It was good with, but better without. The fish freshness and the ikura was really nice. \n\nKonpa (salmon, yellowtail, shallots, bellpepper, apricots, tomato chips, jalapeno) - the BF normally doesnt like salmon, but this place serves up some he likes. I like the bellpepper and tomato chips adding some crunch to it all! \n\nSake Orenji (salmon, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko,sprouts) Since the crudos salmon as good we decided to get one of these. We love yuzu tobiko and it was the most sad game trying to get it to not drop in the sauce. There's a surprising spiciness with it which came through but nice with the citrusy. \n\nCrispy brussel sprouts - I love crispy sprouts and never get to cook them at home. This has the right amount of seasoning with the lemon chili and the rice puffs add just some extra crunch. \n\nNegi hama - really simple, but good staple that fills ya up and is comforting. \n\nChicken karaage - if you like thai chili type sauce this is tossed in a more tangy version of that. I like it, but didn't love this one. I cracked myself up at a observation the BF made that was just so WRONG though in that he thought it smelled like....vaginas. \n\nWe also got a palette cleanser somewhere between our courses of a fruit salad (strawberry, blueberry, apples with fish oil, fish sauce and microgreens. Interesting combo, but it's successful. Think about Asians who put fish paste on mangoes or salt on fruits. Same idea.\n\nThen desserts. \n\nWe just grabbed a sorbet sampler. Today was strawberry, lemon and blood orange. The standout was the blood orange, the strawberry was good and the lemon was a slightly too acidic.\n\nThe chef then sent us out one of the desserts since we missed yesterdays tasting, the Ringo Lico which had granny apple smith sorbet, panna cotta, pistachio butter, pistachios, fennel chip, dill chips,  kumquats. It was a lot going on, but I liked the aspect of the panna cotta with the pistachio butter, or the pistachio butter with the sorbet and fennel/dill on it separate, but not together. \n\nOverall I think the food is exciting and bright and things I like. There was a repeating theme of citrus fruits in things we had being a bit heavy. Some items didn't say it would have it and it was in the dish.  I guess I got my Vit C today? Since people will be doing some form of courses, just a thought it might become one noted to be used so much.\n\nService was very attentive, talkative and earnest. The manager came up and asked how it was going and asked how we heard about them and introduced herself. Our servers asked for feedback on their newest dishes and what we thought was successful about it, etc. This is not a fast dining place. They like to pace you out, bring you a dish so you can focus just on that and not have hot plates go cold or cold plates go room temp trying to go through it. In ways made me appreciate each dish, but maybe they could have tried to shorten the gaps in between just because it was 2am when we were done with dinner and tomorrow was a work day. \n\nIt's one of those places that can be trouble as I want to order all the things. The quality, the plating and flavor felt much more expensive than what it was. . Ambitious food, earnest staff and doing a little bit extra to make the experience, it deserved 5 stars off the bat which I normally reserve after repeat visits. Yes, this is a Yelperazzi cult favorite for a reason."

There are so many great restaurants to choose from when you're in Vegas, but if you're craving sushi- take the time to drive off the strip to check this gem out.  An 11 course omakase will serve 4 people easily- and it's such a fun experience sharing a dish with friends and clamoring over how great every dish is.  I've been here twice and most of the omakase dishes do change periodically.\n\nThe service provided by this restaurant is just as wonderful and they are quite flexible with the omakase dishes as well, catering for food allergies or preference.\n\nI'm disappointed by the less than 5 star reviews here.  Can we cut these restaurants a break and refrain from criticizing when every little expectation is not exceeded?  These people work hard and it really shows!"

            "review": "The mistake I made coming here last night was coming alone.  I had looked at their menu and thought I'd do the omakase.  My server, Noemi, explained that omakase was meant for two people to share.  She quickly said, \"We can change it and do it for 1.  How's that?\"  That was quite OK with me and with that a wonderful meal began.\n\nAfter being brought some iced green tea, Noemi brought an amuse-bouche of some thinly sliced pickled cucumber wrapped with pickled papaya and topped with feta cheese.  What a grand way to start.  The contrast of flavor with fruit, cheese, and vegetable was a harbinger of good things to come.\n\nMy first dish was a grape salad.  It had both red and green grape halves with candied walnuts, enoki mushrooms, and some feta cheese with a light dressing.  What an interesting salad with wonderful flavors!\n\nNext came the star of the evening and according to Noemi, the most ordered thing on the Yonaka menu--the sake orenji--Scottish salmon with orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, lemon and orange oil, maldon, and micro arugula.  Salmon nicely laced with fat cut sashimi style on a bed of orange slices.  The tobiko added so much flavor to the dish.  Beautiful blend of flavors with the orange and the salmon.  The sauce was their homemade ponzu and it was superb!\n\nAt this point, Nodemi asked if I could eat two more dishes or was I too full and should we go directly to dessert.  Rhetorical for me but she was serious. I told her that of course I'd go for two more dishes and she said that it would be one more cold dish and one hot dish.  Next came tate ichigo--sliced Hokkaido sea scallops, fresh strawberry, negi, apricot and strawberry relish, hibiscus salt, Thai chili, negi oil, and strawberry sauce.  (I stole the full description from my friend Amelinda so I'll give her credit!) The raw scallops with the strawberry slices was another example of a different take on fish.  It's no wonder they refer to this as modern Japanese food.  It was delicious!\n\nBefore the hot course, I was brought a lollipop--a frozen cube of cantaloupe as a palette cleanser.  Very nice touch and very good.\n\nThen the hot dish came.  It was skirt steak pieces with mushrooms, tomatoes, Brussels sprout leaves and some cracked salt.  The meat was a little on the rare side which was good and there were both tomato wedges and halved grape tomatoes.  The cracked salt added so much flavor to the dish.  Now I was feeling full, but there was one more dish to come--dessert.\n\nDessert was the mango cotta, a large round of mango panna cotta filled with mango \"egg\" made from mango pur\u00e9e.  On the other side of some mango tuile was some mango ice cream on a bed of pistachio butter.  Both sides of the dessert had finely chopped pistachio pieces and it was a tremendous ending to a wonderful meal!\n\nService was excellent throughout my time there.  The restaurant only had one other table occupied so it was quiet.  The music was perfect--modern and not too loud.\n\nNow all I have to do is get some Yelp volunteers to join me so we can give the full omakase a true workout.  It was quite good of them to allow me to do a lesser version of the omakase with full size dishes of fewer courses.  Very well done and deserving of all 5 stars!"

The chef has combined traditional Japanese ingredients and techniques, with refreshing fruits, Western herbs and spices and flavors from SE Asia to dish up original culinary treats for your eyes and mouth.\n\nTraditional Japanese comfort food such as chicken karaage, is skillfully enhanced with jalapeno, mint, basil, onion and a fish sauce-based sauce. \n\nSalmon pairing with oranges. Not a huge culinary leap of innovation, but the presentation and taste combination is at least equal to those of restaurants with celebrity chefs billing, strong patrons followings and good reviews.\n\nYonaka Modern Japanese is definitely going to cost you more than your typical AYCE sushi meal, but if you want to experience something different and still get your sushi fix, make Yonaka one of your final selection options.\n\nThey also have Happy Hour from 5-6:30pm and again from 11pm to 2am.  Perfect for test driving their menu in the shallow end of the pool or diners that are looking for a light snack.\n\nService:  4.5/5  The staff worked together to service the guests, so you are in good hands.\n\nFood:  4.5/5  The chefs definitely have put a lot of attention into all aspects of the dining experience. Plates of food served are all artfully plated (color, arrangement, height, etc.) with thoughtful pairing of quality ingredients, flavors, textures, smell.  \n\nPrice:  4.5/5  For tapas, the prices seems high, until you see the portion size of the food served.\n\nDecor/Atmosphere:  5/5  Very modern, minimalistic interior design application, with well lit counter seating, which are perfect for photographing/Instagramming/Yelp photo blogging your food.\n\nParking:  4/5  Not a huge parking lot, but seems to be sufficient for the businesses in this strip mall.\n\n5 stars."

We were even given favors, which was a nice touch. \n\nI love the pace of the food and the passion of the staff, from Jax at FOH to servers and chefs. The passion for creating unique items is clear. \n\nSo why not 5*? Everything is just too precious for me, save one or two dishes (the much lauded Brussels sprouts and Sake Kama collar are stellar) to me, the simplicity of Japanese food is my preference and there is an overabundance of unnecessary accoutrements which many times distract from the focal point of food. And perhaps it is a personal preference, but fish sauce with my fish sauce - and everything else on the menu - is overkill. And salty! And compressing fruit is impressive...the first time (and yup, fish sauce!) \n\nHowever, this being a fusion spot: what they are doing is very creative and the aforementioned service is top of the line. Preferred spot for Happy Hour and Reverse for many, and this is where they shine. Or, perhaps another $30 Omakase?! Because of the Omakase and service, I've rounded up from a 3.5, I prefer my neighborhood joint.

I can't even begin to explain how good this place is.  I am a foodie, I appreciate textures, presentation, originality, flavor combinations.  And this place has it all.  I've been telling all my friends to check this place out and everyone has been blown away like me.  I'm totally serious -- in my opinion this is THE BEST restaurant in Las Vegas.  In fact, I ate at Nobu the other day and although it was amazing I think Yonaka's has it beat.  Please please please do yourself a favor and check this place out.  I'm not going to recommend anything because at this point I've probably had at least half of the menu items and they've all been amazing.  Well OK, I'll recommend a few things.  First of all, the chocolate dessert plate is out of this world.  The cold plates are unreal.  The sushi rolls are excellent but in my opinion not as good as the cold plate options.  I just tried the octopus dish today and was really surprised how good it was.  And the new dessert addition -- the cheddar flan -- was also super super good.  Most of the people I know are crazy about the brussel sprouts -- I think they are good but I'm not crazy about them.  Then again, I normally hate brussel sprouts and these are pretty good so that in and of itself is a feat.  The saki orenji, the crudo, the karaage, any of the wagyu beef options (the berry, peach, mushroom sauce, etc) are all amazing."

The walls are decorated with 4x4 cubes its actually pretty cool looking.\n\nEverything on the menu is made for sharing except maybe the sushi orders. We ordered a lot of dishes. So I cant review every single one. But i felt like all the dishes had WAY too many ingredients. It was so much that i couldn't figure out what flavor I was supposed to be tasting. Most of the dishes were OK. I think my favorite was the Fois Gras sushi and the pork belly. The service was really nice but the food took a long time to come out. Probably because they had so many ingredients in each dish. \n\nI don't think i would return because it is quite expensive. Some of the food were good and some were not. It would cost too much to try everything on the menu. The bill was around $300 for 4 people. It was worth a try though."

The food was fabulous from start to finish. Yonaka is high-end sushi and sashimi doing Nobu-quality dishes (including some very creative and delicious items) for 1/4 of the price. The crispy brussels sprouts, sea bass, yellowtail, wagyu beef and scallops were all simply great. And... The tasting menu for 2 plus a couple of drinks each came to $150.\n\nMy only criticism is that the drink service was a little slow mid-meal. I'm a customer who likes a server to notice that I'm almost done with my cocktail and ask me whether I want another drink and bring it quickly. On this occasion, I had to flag down the server and ask for another cocktail, and then it took quite awhile to get it. However, the server acknowledged the slow service and apologized (without me needing to say anything) and the manager took the drink off the check.\n\nI'll be visiting again, soon!"

Even at 1130pm....High class service at cheap prices!  Great date night spot :)\n\nThey brought out a surprise amuse for us, but my little guy ate it so fast I couldn't take a picture of it LOL.  \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#PeQuMZ1m0oU0Z7ynmAx5Yg\n\nIt was some sort of tomato and ginger I believe lol.\n\nNext up was the Grilled Edamame :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#j44-Gn1LOSkmTLcqUXwBjQ\n\nAnd Avocado Nigiri :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#r-9Ejdlk9C1eakbrvz1zJA\n\nWhich were great versions of the classics. This is my Baby's go-to food, and he ate them all up!  Actually, he ate EVERY single thing here...he loves great tasting Japanese!\n\nThe Sake Orenji came out next :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#tsjmaUkTc2NVZu0-ajlE7g\n\nSalmon and oranges in a great sauce and garnish. It was very summery in taste with just a hint of spice. Good stuff!  I think this was the most spendy dish oh happy hour at only $7, but still worth it for sure!\n\nI think the highlight of the night was the Crispy Brussel Sprouts though!\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#TEMmqjR8-fZcDcWyDujkQA\n\nThese were the best way I have had them....with lemon, chili, mint, and puffed rice! The edges were burned with a nice char, and they had a very nice caramelization! I will be ordering these every time I come here!\n\nAnd last but not least, the Karaage : \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#i1e390goIk-di0_kTiljPQ\n\nFried chicken, jalapeno, mint, basil, and onion! A great version of the classic...each bite was very tender and flavorful, with just a hint of spice!\n\nWe will definitely be back!

A few Yelpers had been checking-in to this place rapid fire a couple of months ago when it first opened, so not wanting to miss out, I took a friend and went to investigate. And then I thought my investigation could use a little more research, so I went back a few more times. Findings: creative food, great ambience and friendly staff. Ding, ding, ding we have a winner!\n\nYonaka is a bit off the beaten path at Flamingo and Decatur in a generic looking strip mall, if you could even call it that. A real diamond in the rough, it's pretty unassuming until you step inside and are kind of transported to another dimension. The restaurant is modern and Japanese in design with this awesome wood tiled wall, clean lines, and minimalist decor. I know it's a weird thing to comment on, but even the (ladies) bathroom is nice! The sink is on this cool bamboo-ish platform and they offer nice hand soap in a decorative pump-not one of those generic plastic boxes that sit on a wall that someone always forgets to fill up. \n\nThe food is an eclectic mix of Japanese inspired tapas that are creative without being pretentious (i.e. essence of foam nonsense). Some favorites that I've enjoyed here are the sake orenji, fatty tuna, grilled edamame and brussels sprouts. I'm still on the fence about the karaage-the first time I had it I didn't care for it because the texture wasn't as crisp as I was expecting, however the second time, really great flavors jumped out at me, so I'd probably order again to give a final judgement. They have an excellent happy hour featuring some of the above as well as a daily specials menu with some of the most creative combinations and platings you'll experience in town. The dining experience here really is something special! If you're not an adventurous eater, this might not be the place for you as the dishes here are a little off the wall (in a good way), and being open minded about combinations like cauliflower and grapefruit is a must. \n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful about answering any menu questions and always happy to give a recommendation. It's one of those places that really makes you upset when you go to another restaurant with piss poor service that is considerably more expensive than Yonaka.\n\nYonaka could easily become a weekly habit for me. The detail that is put into everything, says to me that this is a place that takes pride in everything that it does. And who doesn't want to dine at a place like that?"

We had a spur of the moment girl's night out and I'm craving sushi. Seeing as this is Vegas and it's a Friday without dinner reservation, thus, common sense dictates that the best option is to go off strip. I, once again, relied on my fellow yelpers and decided to check out this place and by gosh, I'm glad we did!  \n\nI called en route & we were immediately seated upon arrival. Marcy was our server and she rocks! She is attentive, fun, never pushy, and a wealth of knowledge, so make sure to heed her recommendations as it all hits the spot & definitely heightened our dining experience. \n\nOnward to the delectable foods... We had the crispy brussel sprouts (way better than Wolfgang Puck's) Hamachi Kama tastes very fresh (as in Hawaii fresh), pork belly is a nice surprise (albeit, my least favorite; side note- I went rogue on this and this was not recommended by Yoda Marcy).\n\nTo save the best for last, if you only go here and get 2 things out of all the many sumptuous offerings of this fine establishment, make it the Sake Orenji and the Ono Meron. When Marcy described these dishes to me, I was at first hesitant. I love fish and I love fruit... separately, but together? But trust me on this one, it freakin' works!!! Having eaten at all the high end sushi places at the strip, in Hawaii & the likes of LA, SF & NYC, I , arrogantly think I know salmon and all it has to offer, but, dear friends, you barely met salmon until you had sake orenji! Ono Meron definitely lived up to its' name as it's simply onolicious! Hats off to the chef for this off strip gem!"

My friends and I are very conscious about our health so we were trying to decide on a place that was healthy, has a good atmosphere, and delicious food.  We had a group of six and wanted to avoid the strip if we could.  I had heard nothing but great things about Yonaka from friends so we decided to stop in and try it.\n\nFirst off, don't be fooled by it's surroundings.  Yonaka is located on Flamingo amongst a bunch of small unknown businesses.  Once you step inside, it rivals some of the nicer restaurants that Vegas has to offer.  As to the clich\u00e9, don't judge a book by it's cover.  You'll be pleasantly surprised by it's modern d\u00e9cor and sexy atmosphere.\n\nWe were promptly greeted and seated shortly thereafter.  I must say, the service here is impeccable.  The waiters are attentive and the staff is friendly.  We were tended to by a number of different staff the entire night.  The attention we received made it feel like we were the only table in the restaurant.  We were also greeted by the marketing manager - Jaz, whom occasionally checked in on us throughout the evening.  A great touch and presence to a great meal.\n\nAs for the food?   The restaurant started us off with an amuse bouche to invigorate our palettes.  It was a slighted salted blackberry and watermelon dish.  The presentation was simple yet refined.  The dish was delicious.  After that, I knew I was in for a treat.\n\nWe ordered for the table and had:\n-  Brussels sprouts\n-  Karrage (3 of them!)\n-  Hotateyaki (2 of them)\n-  Crudo\n-  Shrimp Sashimi\n-  Yellowtail Sashimi\n-  Niku Berry\n-  Yellowtail collar\n-  A sushi roll (can't remember the name)\n-  And Kudamono complimentary from the chef\n\nOverall, everything was perfection.  I am very critical of food and service and Yonaka exceeded all expectations.  The dishes were all delicious (didn't trying the yellowtail collar) and the presentation was masterful.  I highly recommend Yonaka with no hesitation.  It's become my new favorite go to spot."

Consisting of around 20 items or so, the happy hour menu has a great variety of flavors, some of which are as high quality as it gets.\n\nI'm honestly addicted to avocado nigiri, even if its super simple and not even special. At a dollar a pop though, I could go there and just order 10 of these and be very happy. I should just learn to make it myself, huh?\n\nMy personal favorites are, besides the avocado, the new pork belly, the chicken karaage, and the tea ribs. Ok, so I'm favoring the meaty dishes, but they're fantastic deals at their price. I've been making it a point to try pork belly a lot more because it can vary greatly in quality based off preparation and the source of the meat, and Yonaka's is one of the better ones I've had, with a good balance of fat and meat.\n\nAs for service and environment, Yonaka's staff is very attentive and polite, while the decor is very modern and clean. One cool thing is they often (I can't remember if it was every time) give you a little taster at the beginning of the meal!"

You are warmly greeted when you come in, and all of the waitstaff are very attentive and most cordial.  We started with crisp coated baby brussel sprouts in a semi-tempura batter that were delicious.  Next their Sake Orenji- an incredible blend of slices of scottish salmon, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, orange oil and maldon.  Then we enjoyed a crunchy spicy tuna hand roll, followed by Machi Ringo.  The Machi Ringo was buttery yellowtail,interspersed with apple slices on a sweet chili zu with negi and fennel sprigs.  What a creative flavor treat!  Next we were offered frozen Kudamon- fruit as a pallet refresher. We then enjoyed Tea Brined Rib with a citrus honey glaze and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Though we were pretty stuffed by this point- we managed to enjoy every drop of their Choco 10 Ways desert.  Pure decadence!\n\nWe will be back for sure."

For the 3 of us, we ordered the omakase and threw in a couple extra things (the menu is quite extensive). For me, the cold plates really stood out -- sashimi paired with fresh fruits, vegetables, and sauces. Will definitely check it out again!"

Why would you open your restaurant when you don't even have enough ingredients for your menu. That was not a good start but we were fine with it and went ahead ordering other things. I was on my 3rd cup of tea and more than 1/2 hour passed still no food, not even appetizers that we ordered. We asked the waitress and she said our order was next. We were all starving since we didn't have any breakfast and with 2 kids to feed we can't wait for this kind of service forever so we paid for the drink and left. Needless to say, this is our first time there but will be the last for us. The review is for the service they provided us, not for the food since none of us get to taste any their food due to their snail crawling speed service. We went over to Jinya down the street which has hot ramen ready in 5 min after ordering."

We had the hamburger which came with french fries which were just about the best fries I have had in many years. The hamburger was big and tasty, but maybe a little overwhelmed by the sauteed onions and other toppings so the hamburger taste didn't make it through everything else that was going on. Our last indulgence was the Hojicha (green tea) milkshake. Delicious and different. I watched them make it and you could see the time and care they took to get the orange peel and the orange zest on the drink just the way they wanted it. \n\nI'm looking forward to trying lunch again and also a dinner sometime. The place was pretty empty for lunch, so it may be that their current lunch menu undergoes a change at some point, but I hope not."

He arranged everything for about 16 of us who flew out to Vegas to meet-up just to eat food!!  This was one of the restaurants and let me tell you it was a phenomenal experience!  Now, I must confess that I rarely put reviews on Yelp...I get lazy about it since I'm on Foodspotting and I'd have to review twice about the same place - once here and once on FS.  So I usually Yelp restaurants when I'm super impressed or when I'm super PO'd about the place.  Well, I must say that I'm not easily impressed when it comes to food and service and this place got 5 stars on both ends!  EVERYONE who work there were friendly, efficient, and just happy to be there!  The service was on par with Four Seasons Resorts where they remember and call you by your name, food service was synchronized, every course was introduced prior to serving including ingredients, etc.  The manager, Jax, catered to us the entire time we were there, and the chefs came out to meet us after we were done.  \nThey prepared a special 10 course menu for our party and on top of that there were two amuse bouche which were amazing!  When I heard 10 course menu, I expected the portions to be on a smaller side, but some of the dishes were almost a full size which was crazy and generous at the same time, because I was literally busting at the seams!  :D   I've been to many of the 5 star restaurants on the Strip that bear names of the famous chefs.  Some of them don't even impress me as much as this place!  Thank you Jax and staff for your incredible hospitality and amazing food!  If there was only one reason to be back in Vegas, Yonaka would be it!\n\nAmuse Bouche #1\nWatermelon topped with minced cilantro.  Dash of fish sauce.  This chef is genius at playing with different flavors.  Fish sauce!  Who would've thought??  It was spectacularly refreshing!  \n\nAmuse Bouche #2\nCurry curd on top of crispy rice.  Definitely a big teaser for my tastebuds.\n\nCucumber Basil Martini\nMy choice of drink from their omakase drink menu.  Refreshing saketini with subtle basil flavor.  Very refreshing!  \n\nBudo (Grapes)\nWarm grapes cut in halves, sprinkled with feta and toasted walnut.  \n\nSake \nScottish salmon, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, sanbai zu (ponzu sauce.)  Literal explosion of flavors in your mouth making you utterly shudder in ecstasy!!  That was this dish.  Enuf said!\n\nHamachi \nYellowtail sashimi with fennel bulbs, lemon curd, horseradish, garlic pur\u00e9e, and white soy lemon vinaigrette.  After being literally punched in the face with a flavor bomb by the previous salmon dish, this one was mild in comparison.  And that was just perfect, because who wants to be punched in the face repeatedly albeit it was a tremendously sexy and foodgasmique?  This was the gentle lover versus the passionate and dominatrix of the previous course.  Both are more than welcome on my palate!  :p\n\nUni \nSanta Barbara sea urchin served with sea urchin panna cotta, fresh scallops, poached egg, and buttermilk dressing.  Dollop of salty ikura to balance out the flavors and splash of grape seed oil to paint the canvas with a vibrant green!! \n\nToro \nBluefin tuna belly is wrapped in nori, battered in glutinous rice batter, then flash fried.  Served with marinated vegetables, and edible flower.  Such a stunning dish!  Fatty melt in your mouth tuna turned chewy due to the glutinous batter was genius!   \n\nToro Sashimi\n Just look at that substantial cut!!  Beautiful presentation!  This is how sashimi is done, people!! (This was an extra order outside of the 10 course meal)\n\nTako \nGrilled Japanese octopus served with saut\u00e9ed and diced beets, mushroom pur\u00e9e, avocado pur\u00e9e, and quinoa.  Perfectly grilled and tender octopus tentacles with subtle yet complex flavors!  WOW!  \n\nPalate Cleanser\nFrozen cantaloupe with mint popsicles.  Served on a stick in a bean filled wooden sake cup, this bite sized popsicle was one of the more sophisticated and fun palate cleanser I've ever had!!  I'm so impressed with this place, words escape me!\n\nWagyu \nThe flavor on this dish was SPOT ON!!  \n\nButa \nCaramelized pork belly, kimchi apple, apple pur\u00e9e, and fried cilantro.  Spicy tangy kimchi apples cut the richness of the fatty belly and made this a heavenly dish.  \n\nMatcha \nStrawberry mint ice cream perched atop pistachio crumbs with Japanese Matcha green tea custard poured at the table.  Great flavor and not too sweet.\n\nOkashi \nLemon poppy seed cake, lime ice cream, olive oil emotion, and pliable lemon cream.   The lemon poppy seed \"cake\" are the crumbs you see strewn about the plate as well as the cracker looking slices which were fluffy and delicious!"

If you like imaginative eats, and are open to some wild protein-fruit combinations, get over there and try it.\n\nUnfortunately, the second line service we received was very poor... and unbefitting of the food and the atmosphere.  Our server (Gene, I think his name was?) was great.  Deep knowledge of the menu and was working his ass off.  The busser/helper dudes, though, were in way over their heads.  One guy, after delivering some nigiri sushi, said 'I'll be right back with wasabi, ginger, and soy for you'.  Never came.  Tired of sitting there watching my sushi get less fresh by the moment, I flagged him down, and he apologetically said he'd bring it right over.  HE.  FORGOT.  AGAIN.  Having to ask three times for the same thing is crazy.  And I'm really not a picky diner... but we're talking about a SUSHI BAR where traditional accoutrements should be provided on an anticipatory basis.  Another guy accidentally dumped so much water on the table next to us, I thought there was an ice bucket challenge going down.  Anyway, we'll go back and give it another shot.  The food was that good.  Bonus tip:  The $8 Chardonnay on the list is surprisingly delicious for the price point and goes great with everything we tried on the menu."

At the end of a strip mall, it sort of doesn't fit the mold of \"modern Japanese tapas style restaurant\" like they advertise on their website, but we'd heard good things and decided to go with it.\n\nIf ever there was a time where the phrase \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" were true, this would be it. The interior is indeed modern, but compared to the showy palaces of the Vegas strip, it falls a little short. But what it lacks in atmosphere it makes up in taste ten times over.\n\nto see pics of the food we ordered, check out the post on our food website at the following link: http://eatsporkjew.com/recipes/dessert/us-kids-grew-up-in-the-casinos/"

Some friends were in town and I wanted to find an off-strip restaurant to take them to.\n\nWe were four people, and on the recommendation of our waitress we got the omakase menu, which on the day we went was $109 total for 8 courses.\n\nFor our courses we had -\n\n- Cantaloupe appetizer\n- Crispy brussels sprouts ~$6\n- Sake Orenji (salmon, orange) ~$11 x 2\n- Some sort of sashimi cucumber slices ~$16?\n- Something that looked like a Hamachi Midori ~$16\n- 4 pieces of nigiri (one each) ~$12\n- a palette cleanser of frozen cantaloupe\n- wagyu beef skewers (2, 3 pieces each) ~$16\n- meat candy  - ~14\n- dessert - similar to greenies ~9\n- dessert - similar to milk and cookies ~9\n= ~$120 of value with mistake extra dish, $109 without\n\nOverall, I felt the food quality was great.  I enjoyed all the courses, found the flavours and selection to be good.  Service was also excellent (though our table did feel a little awkward when we were told we were accidentally given two of the sake orenji when we were supposed to just have one.)\n\nFor the four of us, we were completely full at the end of the courses, but that included the extra plate.

I'm slightly worried it might ruin me for other sushi (like, um, our usual semi-weekly AYCE gorgefest).\n\nI had the single best piece of salmon belly I have ever eaten! It literally, literally melted in my mouth. The toro was fantastic as well. Each piece of sushi is served with its own special flavorful accompaniment and the fish is so fresh and tasty by itself that you will not long for soy sauce and wasabi. We had very simple shrimp nigiri which was topped with a little dab of garlic butter which added awesome flavor. It was like Shrimp DeJonghe nigiri. YUM.\n\nThe only disappointment for me was the wagyu nigiri, which my husband wanted to try- it was just kind of boring. HowEVER we also had a dish called niku berry which had perfectly cooked beef, mushrooms, strawberries, a fried egg pur\u00e9e and an amaaaazing chimichurri, so don't stay away from the meat!\n\nI could happily make a meal of their sushi but the tapas portion of the menu is too yummy to ignore. I looooved the sake orenji which is so refreshing and explodes with fresh deliciousness.  Our first dish was a special which was some crazy concoction of tuna with dehydrated pineapple, blue cheese, apple and fennel.The crudo (which we were lucky enough to receive free of charge) was great, too. Honestly, everything was great! Chef Ramir is pretty awesome. I really want to come back for omakase or something because I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nOH and get the chokoreto appetizer which is a crazy array of flavors (chocolate, mint, lime, avocado) and textures (crispy, crunchy, creamy, crumbly).\n\nWhat I really like about Yonaka is that it feels like a really cool, classy restaurant on the Strip but instead it is a really cool, classy restaurant free of annoying Strip pretension and without Strip prices. Our bill was surprisingly reasonable.\n\nStaff are super nice and helpful and made us feel very appreciated! When asked where we heard about the place, we mentioned Yelp and they gushed a little about Misti Y. and the great review she left (which is what made me take notice of Yonaka in the first place, so thanks, Misti!)."

After returning, I'm sad to see its not on the menu. \nThe scallops were seared skillfully. Crunchy with a medium rare center. Paired with a salad that had some bomb sauce I forgot what. And topped with crushed pistachios. It was hella good! \nPut it on the menu! \n\nMy favorite dish here is the foie gras nigiri. It's why I came and now why I always come back. \nPerfectly seared foie gras with crunchy candied quinoa. Whoever thought of that is a f'ing genius. \n\nOn my second return I did have the worst wagyu beef sushi. Maybe I was expecting too much. It was over cooked and chewy AF. NOT the wagyu sushi I'm use to. I complained to the chef and he made some new ones. Those were cooked better. Still, wagyu here is lacking. I think they're using the same ishiyaki Kobe for wagyu nigiri. \n\nThey should be using A5 wagyu for their wagyu sushi. Other than that, this place among the best in Vegas."

I was afraid this place was built up too much and I'd be disappointed, but that certainly wasn't the case!\n\nWe came for happy hour as suggested, and everything was amazing. The brussel sprouts came out first and set a high bar for the rest of the meal. One of the best vegetable plates I've ever had! I could eat bowls and bowls of these! Then we got the sake kale and the sake orenji (not on HH menu). Both were an explosion of flavor! The pork belly buns came out last, and they were worth the wait. I love the grilled, charred flavor and the jalapeno added a nice spicy kick. Yum! Not only does everything taste delicious, but the presentation was absolutely beautiful. It made the food look even more appetizing! \n\nThis will be my new go to place for out of town guests!"

It was very limited so we tried just a few things. The hand roll was just ok. We tried a roll with yellowtail which again was just ok. The prices for the happy hour menu though would be normal price at many other sushi joints. \n\nThe compliments of the chefs were bits of cherry tomatoes with some sauce. They were really stomach churning.\n\nThe good thing I can say was the sake cake martini with the graham cracker ring was actually really good! \n\nSuch a shame about this place. Lower prices, more effort into the food, and a more extensive happy hour would make this place a happening joint."

If you haven't eaten here yet, do yourself a favor and make it happen soon! \n\nThere was no question what we would get when we saw there was an 8 course omakase. Timmy, our waiter also suggested the Crispy Brussels Sprouts (Brussels sprouts, lemon chili,mint,puffed rice) I hate brussels sprouts, and normally wouldn't touch them with a 10 foot pole. But, Timmy said the same thing, so I was like what the heck...  And let me tell you they were friggen amazing! A little crispy, and a lot tasty.\n\nOur 8 courses were timed perfectly, and generously plated. The dishes were creative, and absolutely beautiful. There seemed to be fruit fusion theme with many of the dishes. Combinations that most would never think of. \n\nI must say that I'm still convinced there was an error on our check and we were severely under charged. I have never in my live gotten away with such a low bill when I've gone out for sushi, tapas and had 3 bottles of saki. \n\nThe service was excellent by all and we were helped by a team of workers. The manager even found time to come and explain their dining concept. She was thrilled to find out I was a Yelper and had heard good things from my friends. \n\nIf I could give 6 stars I would, If I could give 3 thumbs up I would, all in all, it's become one of my favorite sushi places in town. \n\nLooking forward to my next tasting, and happy hour."

This is clearly not a traditional Sushi place - note their description is \"Modern Japanese\". We ordered the Crispy Brussel Sprouts which had an amazing flavor profile, followed by the Shrimp Tempura with a very, very light batter which did not overwhelm the flavor of the shrimp. Then came the Sake Orenji, a Scottish raw salmon with orange oil and orange supreme - just wonderful - we could have ordered another portion. The came the Shioyaki Saba which is a grilled Norwegian Mackerel with cucumber, lemon and parsley - delicious! Lastly, we had the Ishiyaki which are raw sushi grade scallops which you sear yourself on a hot stone - fun to do and an enjoyment to eat.\n\nOverall, this was a culinary delight and priced very reasonably - the two of us spent $72 including 2 hot Sakes and a good tip. The service was outgoing and very friendly but was delivered in a rapid fire explanation and a not so subtle attempt to up sell. \n\nWe definitely will be back and will highly recommend it."

Located in a typical strip mall on West Flamingo and featuring a concept self described as 'Japanese tapas' the evening began with the simple decision of bar versus table and opting for the later amidst a warm yet stark interior it was to the tune of a shared $95 omakase plus several supplements that the meal unfolded - an invigorating paco-jet concentrated cucumber amuse setting the stage for what would follow.  Beginning first with a trio of fried happy hour bar-snacks from which the 'best' would be impossible to select and then transitioning into several amply portioned plates both cold and hot it was early on that a consistent pattern of superlative proteins over bright citrus and subtle aromatics emerged, the Suika Saka and Sakana Yaki particularly enthralling while the slightly overcooked Niku Berry's beef proved that a m\u00e9lange of mushrooms can truly save a plate, particularly served point/counterpoint with tart early-season strawberries.  Rounding out savories with the crunchy Age Maki, an inspired take on Mexican Street corn dressed with briny uni, plus a $9 bite of slightly overseared foie gras cribbed direct from Austin it was at long last that we transitioned to sweets, a trio ordered but four delivered and all amongst the best I've experienced from Eastern influenced cuisine - the mango 'yolk' of the panna cotta and banana pudding-come-cr\u00e8me brulee Kanmi-O both on par with the pastry at Robuchon or Twist at half the price."

If you're looking for seaweed salad and more traditional rolls, this is not the place for you. \n\nThe service was very attentive, even if a bit much. But, one can't fault the staff for trying to make up for what the menu lacks in predictability. I had the feeling they were explaining the menu to the point of being apologetic. The restaurant was nearly empty at 1:30 pm, so that may have contributed to the over-attentiveness.\n\nThe chef is clearly talented. I just question how long a place with an avant-garde menu will last in this part of town. Perhaps his talents would be better served in a high-end casino sushi bar. Just a thought."

Some parts were crispy but others were drenched with oil so it was not crispy. It also had a vinaigrette taste to it.\n2. Sake Orenji- salmon sashimi over oranges-it was a strong overwhelming orange taste, the idea was interesting however, I thought a different citrus that was more tart might have worked better. The orange was so over powering, there was no fresh salmon taste to it. There was also oil pooled at the bottom of the dish, it was too oily which is not a good combination for fresh fruits.\n3. Sakana Crudo-tuna with cucumbers and jalape\u00f1os.  The dish was nothing interesting. I am not a spicy eater so I removed the jalapenos. I can tell by now why the fish were all flavored with strong flavors, such as oranges and jalapenos. The fish was not fresh and was very fishy. Not exactly what you would expect for omakase quality. Thats not the worse part, on the last piece, we found a lump/ tumor in the fish. That was it,  my appetite was done. I showed the waiter and he brought it back. The female manager came back and explained that it was a cartilage. yea...NO. We are medical professionals and although not fish experts, we have an idea what a tumor vs. cartilage looks like. I don't blame the restaurant/chef for a cancerous fish, or even say it really WAS a cartilage...presentation is KEY. Why would you cut me a piece of fish like THAT and still serve it. Clearly there was not much thought into my \"Omakase\" dishes.\n4. Hamachi Midori-the fish with cucumbers, avocados and yuca chips. Again, nothing special about this dish. The yuca chips had lots of oil pooled at the bottom-no surprise- but since I walked in, the chips were pre made and placed at the sushi bar counter. I questioned the cleanliness of the yuca chips sitting out in the open and the freshness. \n5. Five Raw Oysters-nothing special. It wasnt great but it did not taste fishy at least. It had apples ceviche ( i think) chopped over the oysters which was good but again, seafood freshness masked by other flavors. I wonder if these oysters were thawed because the center of the oysters had ice chips in them, as if they came frozen.\nComplimentary Cantaloupe ice cube palette cleanser-this was surprisingly good\n6. Wagyu beef skewers-this i thoguht was very good, tasty and cooked just right\n7. Pork Belly-again, very soft and tender, flavors were good\n8. Desserts-nothing special, not horrible but a bit bland, I could have appreciated more flavors here instead of my fish.\n\nOmakase plus two hot green teas, tax and tip=$140 down the drain. My stomach feels bloated in a bad way too, must be the excess oil or not fresh fish? Raw fish was bad, cooked foods were good. But I am very disappointed and would not be coming back here again."

The yellowtail had apples layered in also really good. And lastly the oysters were topped with a ceviche that was so refreshing!  I can't wait to go back for the full 8 course meal.  We sat at the bar so watched as the delicately made each presentation.  \n\nThe cookies were pretty good, warm, perfectly cooked.  I did prefer the cereal milk here over momofuku's.  Overall, I prefer regular milk with my cookies but a fun different touch. The cookie dough is more like a spread with the crackers.  \n\nOverall a great experience, dessert was good and the food a great surprise that was above my expectations and stands out as a different sushi spot with how fresh, flavorful and tasty the dishes are especially with the sauces and fruit added.\n\nThe only odd thing was that we didn't have a reservation and had to sit at the bar even though a bunch of tables were open the whole time we were there.

The meat candy, foie gras risotto and miso black cod were well executed but not truly innovative. The lone sushi we had that was good was the fried oyster sushi. Finally, the dessert we tried, mango cotta, was a true standout and worth coming here to try out.\n\nThe risotto of the foie gras risotto was the standout of that dish, filled with savory soy-sauced flavor and sweet flavors. The mushrooms were also done very well. The rice of the risotto was koshihikari and the mixture tasted very much like glutinous rice mixtures you might find in Chinese restaurants with the exception that it was much more sweet. The koshihikari rice gives off a more firm texture than what you might find in risotto elsewhere. The unagi was well executed but in some sense, was overwhelmed by the flavors of the risotto itself. The foie gras was fine, perhaps not the fattiest foie gras that you've had as the liver had not been completely taken over by fat, but it also seemed lost in the dish.\n\nThe meat candy was a very well executed pork belly dish, flavorful and crisped very well. However, it wasn't as sweet as you might imagine with a title like \"meat candy\". It definitely was much less sweet than the foie gras risotto. The kimchee apples were interesting but perhaps something more tart and sweet would have complemented the fatty pork belly better.\n\nThe miso black cod was also very well-executed, delicately cooked and not overdone whatsoever. The flavors were of savory miso and also very sweet. It was a very well cooked piece of fish, but nothing innovative as miso black cod is almost ubiquitous. I did wish for a bit more of a crisp on the skin of the fish.\n\nThe one truly interesting bite was the fried oyster sushi. The fried oyster was of good quality and the aioli paired with it went very well. The other sushi we tried were less interesting. We were excited about the grilled Alaskan king crab sushi which was served on a bed of deep fried rice instead of on typical sushi rice. Unfortunately, the delicate flavors of the grilled Alaska king crab were overwhelmed by the components of the dish. We were similarly excited about the amaebi as they seared it instead of the typical raw amaebi sushi elsewhere. Again, the description did not fit the final execution. The amaebi was barely seared, thus tasting much like the typical raw amaebi preparations. The confit garlic butter also did not come through in the taste. Finally, the deep fried shrimp head that typically comes with amaebi sushi preparations was fine but certainly wasn't among the best that you've had.\n\nOther less successful sushi options were the two daily specials that we tried. We tried an apple smoked yellowtail sushi which was much fishier than hamachi we've had elsewhere. Similarly, the yellowtail tartare sushi sounded interesting, but again it was much fishier than we've had elsewhere.\n\nThe standout of the night was the mango cotta, which was the dessert we selected. We recently tried Sweets Raku, and the mango cotta here was definitely much more interesting and tasted better. The mango cotta was a panna cotta filled with mango puree. The panna cotta tasted a bit of almonds. It was also paired with some coconut flavors which went very well with the panna cotta. Overall, this was a great way to end the meal.\n\nWe would likely come back again but primarily for the hot plates, desserts and fried oyster sushi."

However, we concluded that we would rather order a la carte the next time we dine here. \n\nOne thing can be equally said about all of their dishes, they have perfected the art of plating and presentation - down to an extremely beautiful science! I adore vibrant, edible flowers used as garnish and they really outdid themselves on the colorful aesthetic of each dish.\n\nAppetizer:\n//Crispy Brussels sprouts//\nLemon, chili, mint, puffed crispy rice. The charred, dark brown, leafy bits coated with the sweet tangy sauce is to die for! I can honestly say that it's my favorite dish of everything we tried. So good! Flavor rating: 5/5\n\n3 Cold: \n//Sake orenji// \nScottish salmon, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, orange oil. This dish had wonderful soft texture and refreshing flavor. It was a little on the oily side, for my taste, but it was the second top dish of the evening. Flavor rating: 5/5\n\n//Tate Ichigo//\nRaw Hokkaido sea scallops, fresh strawberry, apricot relish, strawberry dashi, hibiscus salt. The presentation and the sauce was extremely gorgeous, yet the sauce and overall taste of everything was mild and forgettable. Flavor rating: 2/5\n\n//Crudo//\nSea bass, kumato tomato, ikura, candied quinoa, lemon herb oil. This dish also didn't blow away my tastebuds. The sauce was tangy, but simple. It's an innovative combination, but definitely not one that I favor. I also ended up with stab inside my cheek by a sharp, firm pin-bone. Flavor rating: 2/5\n\n//Hamachi Crudo//\nYellowtail, Castelvetrano olives, pickled fennel, chives, grapefruit, preserved lemons. This dish was the Chef's apology for feeding me a sharp pin-bone in the last crudo dish. While the gesture was appreciated, I took one bite and couldn't eat the rest. The yellowtail sashimi tasted offensively fishy, the pickled fennel was cut too thick and extremely hard to bite into, and the overall, combined flavors of the dish was unappetizing. They practically took the dish back whole. Flavor rating: 0/5\n\nPalate Cleanser: Small bowl of fresh fruit and mint (green apples, kiwi, strawberry) \n\n3 Hot:\n//Meat candy//\nTwice cooked caramel glazed pork belly, kimchee apple, fried crispy cilantro. The pork belly was tender and sweet. The kimchee green apple salad was unique and it helped add texture if you ate it together with the pork. (If you're wondering, we're stuffed silly by this point) Flavor rating: 3/5\n\n//Niku berry//\nWagyu, strawberries, apricot, Serrano, candied enoki, grilled fennel, fried egg puree, thai chimichurri. This dish was extremely dry for my taste, there was minimal sauce or chimichurri on the plate. The wagyu was offensively overcooked, dried out and tough. Again, the fennel was an unwelcome addition to the plate - raw, flavorless, and too hard to cut or bite into. The only thing on the dish that I enjoyed was the candied enoki mushrooms - wow those were amazing! Flavor rating: 1/5\n\n//Sakana yaki//\nChef's choice oak grilled fish seabass, cauliflower, table poured cauliflower dashi, pickled Cucumber, creme fraiche. The overall flavor was very bland. Use a spoon to scoop up a bite of the seabass together with the creamy cauliflower dashi, and make sure to get some of that pickled cucumber into the bite- it will help wake it up a bit. Flavor rating: 3/5\n\nDessert:\n//Greenies//\nStrawberry white chocolate sauce (yum), rich coffee soil (chocolatey and crunchy), crunchy candied almonds (adds perfect texture), refreshing strawberry mint ice cream (light), lusciously creamy green tea semi fredo (my favorite!), green tea twill (tasted burnt) and green tea chocolate chip brownie (great concept, but it was rock hard and dry) & wash each bite down with a sip of warm strawberry white chocolate soup (WOW!)\n\nWhat made the \"Greenies\" dessert course from Yonaka incredibly unique and extraordinary were the little cups of warm strawberry white chocolate soup that was served alongside the dessert. You're supposed to sip the warm, slightly sweet, almost milky soup after every bite of the dessert. Wow! It tingled and delighted my tastebuds! Step aside milk! The warmth of this soup set each component of the dessert to a whole 'notha level. The dessert concept was extremely chic and scrumptious. (I'll turn away my cheek from the burnt twill and the dried out brownie on this one) Flavor rating: 5/5"

Trust me, you definitely want the Wagyu beef. We ordered two, and then we ordered two more. \n\nEverything fresh, everything delicious. Our waiter was great, too.

The service is where he had issues - big issues. I've decided 2.5 stars is appropriate (I'll round to 3 because the staff was friendly enough), as this is not a fancy restaurant. This is a slightly expensive Japanese restaurant, with poor service. If this were a fancier restaurant, I would be appalled by the service quality. We came on Saturday night at 8:30 as a party of six, and were surprised that it was over half empty. \n\nLets talk positives first. The sashimi plate was really great, fresh and on top of a bed of crushed ice. That was really very nice. The brussel sprouts were awesome (we ordered 4 for our party of six....). The Wagyu Beef was really fun and tasty ($40), you take a beautiful thin slice and sear it on a hot stone. Also, don't touch the stone. It is very hot. Do keep in mind, it was 5-6 slices of beef, not an entree - more of a tapas. I didn't care for the shishito peppers but I think they are supposed to taste the way they did. I just didn't care for the taste. All the other food was good, and I'd eat pretty much everything again. Maybe just not here - because the staff had just got off the struggle bus. \n\nLets elaborate. A dirty fork from a different table was dropped on a friends suit jacket, then retreived with out a word. That's not cool. The wait staff seemed to love stepping on shoes. The dishes seemed to come out at random times, two people ordered the same dish - one came out in 3 minutes and the next 15 minutes later. The bussers were inconsistent and slow, taking some empty dishes but leaving others. Our waiter, Prateesh (I think), was perhaps having the hardest time. He forgot several orders, refused to substitute fish for vegetables for a vegan diner, and was very pushy on the exact way to eat, everything from sashimi to the wagyu. He was friendly, just a little off putting when he was orchestrating every chew. \n\nThe worst part: they had no red bull. I do enjoy a red bull from time to time, and was deeply saddened when I was unable to order one. They did bring out a nice complimentary dessert for my birthday which redeemed them slightly. \n\nTL; DR: Tasty food. The staff had an off day (I hope). Based on many other reviewers, I think we just got unlucky. The bill was around $260 before tip."

The food was very good, and bonus points for the creativity of the flavors.  \n\nBest dishes we had were the brussel sprouts and the shishito peppers.  Despite my initial skepticism, the beet ice cream for dessert was also really good.  Decor and ambiance of this place is great for a date or a group of friends.  \n\nI'm reluctant, though, to give this place 5 stars, because the two fish dishes we had -- the suika sakana (watermelon tuna) and a yellowtail dish were slightly fishy.  Not too noticeable to be a problem, but there was still a fishy taste.  Their fish is sourced from Japan according to the general manager, so I'm not sure if the fish was just slightly too old or had a rough flight or what.  We'll be back for sure, but we'll probably try to order primarily non-fish dishes in light of this."

I like taking visitors to restaurants off the strip and this one is great!\n\nThe first time I went I asked the server for suggestions and she suggested the Crispy Brussels Sprouts.  After I finished laughing, she told me I HAD to try it.  I have had brussels sprouts once and it was not a good experience and I swore never again.  \n\nBut the server was insistent that I should try it.  I decided to put my faith in my server and we ordered a plate of brussels sprouts.  Then we ordered another.  Yonaka is probably the only place I will ever eat brussels sprouts agin.\n\nAnother dish enjoyed by my guests and I are the Tea Smoked Ribs.  Now, honestly, it's hard to make a bad rib.  I like Yonaka's version a lot.  Tea smoked, deep mahogany color, flavorful, and tender.  Fatty?  Yes.  What do you expect?  They're ribs.  Don't want the fat?  Get the sushi.  \n\nThe food is very good and very creative.  In addition to their regular menu, they also have a happy hour menu and a daily special menu.  Different foods have different preparation times so if you are in a hurry, this isn't the place.  This is a place to have a great, unhurried meal.  \n\nThe staff is friendly, knowledgable, and attentive."

Now happy hour lasts only 1.5hrs, so we had to really rush from the Strip to make it out here, but it was well worth the effort.  (If you miss the first happy hour, there is a second late after 11p...but not avail on Sunday seeing how they close around that time).\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nBrussel Sprouts:  The thick lemon chili sauce really made this the best brussel sprouts dish I've ever had.  The crisped rice made the texture interesting.  V. good portion size.  10/10\n\nCrab Handroll:  The crab seemed to be mixed with a mayo based sauce, which was great for texture, but I'm not a big fan of that.  The handroll was big enough to share with my husband. 5/10\n\nSake Kale Salad:  Huge fan of this one.  I liked how the cooked kale soaked up the slightly tart sauce, so that eaten with the sake, it was a wonderfully balanced bite.  I actually liked this much more than the sake orenji, which had a similar flavor profile.  This dish was more flavorful.  The deep fried kale on top though didn't add anything to the dish for me.  9/10\n\nShime Saba:  Whenever available, I always order this.  The flavor and texture were good, but what was nice was that we were given an extra piece.  Incredibly, the price is even on par with what I pay in KS, but the pieces are actually larger!  So generous!  8/10\n\nBuka Jam:  This was the most creative dish that we tried.  I'm not sure what was in it really.  I think there was foie gras maybe...and perhaps kaya jam along with lettuce.  You dip this sandie (conveniently cut in fours) in a savory sauce that held a beautifully poached egg.  I lurv savory/sweet, but I have to admit that it was a little too sweet.  Otherwise, perfect.  8.5/10\n\nRaw Oysters:  Though it was topped with veggie ceviche and you can add lemon, I found this not very interesting.  Perhaps something spicy would've helped.  5/10\n\nGrilled Mackarel:  Just as you would expect it to taste.  The fresh cucumber was the perfect touch.  6.5/10\n\nSake Orenji:  Our waiter said that it was the most popular dish.  I thought it was fine.  Nice to eat the sake with sliced orange.  6.5/10\n\nService was impeccable and perfectly orchestrated.  Though there were a number of other ppl at the restaurant as the meal progressed, our waiter kept an eye out for us, so as soon as we finished a dish, someone would come by to pick up the plates and replace it with a next dish.\n\nOur poker friend said that meals average around $40pp during happy hour, and after taxes and tip it came out to exactly that.  Factor in the creative, well executed dishes and excellent service...and I haven't even tried the drinks and desserts(!)...makes Yonaka during happy hour a rare find, and well worth your trip off Strip."

Yonaka's sushi is disappointing: though the chef prepares the meat in a presentable contemporary style with many flavors (often very strong and overwhelming), this rating falls heavily because of the disorganized service. Our server forgot the sushi orders, which set our entire day's schedule back 30+ mins. Not to make anything better, another table ordered a sizzling dish that emitted so much smoke permeating the air in the restaurant making it a very musty experience. I ordered one premium sashimi platter($58 two pieces for everything), oysters, hamachi kama, avocado rolls, salmon special, shrimp tempera, and spicy peppers; and none of these dishes tasted particularly good! Upon request, sushi and nigiri can be prepared traditionally. However, the oysters were the one delicious dish as they had were topped with fish eggs!\n\nBroadly speaking, this restaurant is very expensive for their service and the amount of sushi and meat they give. \nRecommend to my friends?

Otherwise, the marketing manager paid us a few courtesy visits, actually, more than a few, but she was cool.\n\nThe food was amazing, but definitely for the faint of stomachs.

Great presentation and flavorful.  Not a fan of the rock Salt on the Uni, but maybe it's modern twist.\n\nExcellent playlist to get you in the mood to say the least.

Despite their (much appreciated) efforts to accommodate her, I wound up eating 8.9 out the 10 courses.  Everything was SO DELICIOUS!  I felt like the fat guy in Monty Python's Meaning of Life - and when they brought the special desert course (after we said we don't really eat desert), I thought I was going to explode - but it was so beautiful, we had to try a couple of (ok, several) bites.  The sushi (salmon, amberjack, tuna, fatty tuna, oysters, uni, Foie Gras...I'm forgetting one or two) was all fresh and beautifully presented with multiple layers of flavors...Very Nobu-like.  My wife loved the sear-it-yourself Wagyu beef.  She had a texture issue with the Meat Candy (Kurobuta pork belly) but I loved it.  My favorite was the Foie Gras Sushi - sinfully excellent!  I'd back again and again and again.  However, the Omakase experience is a bit tough on the meat and potatoes folks...My wife was a trooper - said it's a good thing I only turn 50 once!

It is friendly and they describe the dishes in detail as they bring them to you. Love that. \n\nWe had the toro appetizer, salmon orenji, short ribs, and spicy tuna rolls. The toro and salon orenji are a must!!!  All I can say is wow!  The quality, flavor, and presentation of the food was remarkable. They mix their sauces with certain nuts or fruits with the dishes that are simply outstanding.\n\nYou get what you pay for here and we will be back for the next Vegas trip!"

I am a bit health conscious and this type of restaurant doesn't make me feel guilty because everything is fresh and not filled with empty calories.  I regress...\nWe sat at the bar for their happy hour which starts right when they open at 5pm and tried the following.\nCrispy Brussel Sprouts-amazing and I wish I could eat them everyday.  \nAvocado Nigiri-just avocado on a bed of rice\nFresh Ginger Ale-OMG, its addicting\nSpider Roll-average\nSpicy Tuna Handroll-fresh and filling\nKale Salmon-favorite dish hands down.\nWe ordered a few other dishes but I can't recall the complex names and it appears that their HH menu changes all the time.  Our waiter definitely tried his best to get us to purchase off their regular menu but we held our ground and took advantage of the amazing HH prices."

            "review": "Great place; super cool staff, on the whole (Filipina waitress was wonderful); went with friends last week on a tip while visiting LV and were delighted with nigiri, sashimi and composed dishes, alike.  The uni (fresh from Channel Islands, off Santa Barbara) on scallops dish was a particularly great take on a Japanese original.  Service was strong, overall, with one episode of soy sauce spilling on a diner's jeans from an over-eager, but, sweet, manager.  Two suggestions:  Please make sure the hojicha or genmaicha is served in a warmed mug and nearly piping at 170-175degF (ours was lukewarm); and, please consider offering a lighter, more tradional dessert.\n\n***Noto bene to Roman, Franklin, Marissa and other Yelp haters -- others who will never \"get\" a place like Yonaka:  there is a Chinese mega-buffet with mountains of cheap \"sushi\" near you where you can be as loud and tacky as you like, and, where you can fill up your gut with non-sustainable fish that's likely mismarked, e.g. what you think has been hamachi all this time has actually been something else (bait fish, rejected by fishermen), washed in bleach.  You can actually then pass out in the booth at said same establishment once you've had your fill, awaken a few hours later and then hit the buffet, again!!  Such a deal!! They also have unlimited fortune cookies!!  And, vanilla pudding!!  Oooooh, you're such celebrities!!***\n\nOh, and, oenophiles, spare us ALL, please, your whineeee complaints about corkage fees, etc:  it is so Junior Varsity to order red with sushi, in the first place; it is even more JV to actually bring a big red (or, \"buttery chard\") with you from your private stash.  In the best Japanese restaurants (think Jiro-san's Michelin 3-star, Sukiyabashi in Ginza), the progression is sake and beer with early courses, progressing to hojicha with later, then, fresh matcha whisked up to accompany sweet course (and, not much of that), to finish.  Save that \"amazing\", leggy cab that you simply cannot live without and must carry around in its own, special wine carrier for your philistine buddies and those corn-fed, USDA Prime, 24oz, steroid-laden T-bones at the country club where you, as the great Bacchus, god of wine, can lord over lesser beings with your phenomenal ability to actually drink $200.00+ bottles of wine in public with a straight (and, way too serious) face...  \n\nAnd, gentle eaters, kindly stop rubbing your chopsticks together, making soy sauce-wasabi emulsions, and, dipping the rice portion of the nigiri into the soy sauce, will ya?!\n\nYonaka works on so many levels, but, it works best for the more experienced, subtle diner who's actually spent time in bigger markets (especially Japan) and who can appreciate just how good this place really is.  There is a fine, well-edited selection of beers, etc., along with really good sakes (it's World Sake Month, so, good specials, now), and, thoughtfully selected wines, etc., so, appreciate the staff and ask for pairing recommendations.  The measure you give is the measure you receive...  \n\nAt @ $60.00/person for sharing the abundant 6 course omakase (w/drinks), we kept wondering where the rest of the check was.  This is one of the great deals out there, folks."

Mu is smooth and floral and I can literally drink this like juice. Keep in mind that the omakase here is more of a fushion style izakaya with both cold and hot plates/dishes. I loved the omakase because we got to try a bit of everything. \n\nYou would think that sushi and Japanese dishes are rather simple but it's amazing to me how the artistry, palette, and style of these dishes rather contrast remarkably on the same type of dish depending on the chef's perception. The previous day, I had dined at Raku and Raku was decadence and rich with creamy, savory, and buttery flavors. Yonaka's was a stark contrast but in a good way as well. They like to infuse lots of fruits and citrus flavors into the dishes here. It was refreshing and light and unbelievably delicious. \nSome notable dishes were the sake orenji wich is salmon with yuzu and slices of orange and orange oil. This dish really astounded my taste buds. It was so crazy good. I literally died a little right there. \n\nOther notable dishes included the pork belly with pickled appled kimchis\nand also a cold sashimi dish with mint and avocados. \n\nCONS: I was playing nice today by giving them a five star but their service was definetly not 5star worthy. I'll forgive them this time but it better not happen again when I come back.\nFirst off each dish took forever to come out. \nSecondly, our server spilled a glass of our (EXPENSIVE) sake. Didn't even bother to give us service or give us some kind of refund."

They work flawlessly together from a customer view. \n\nRamir and the other chefs are always creating unique dishes that raise the bar from the previous weeks star. I absolutely have never had a bad dish here, ever !  Coming here has opened my mind to many things and I can hardly wait for the new adventures to come. The menu is composed of fish you don't typically see on sushi menus around town . His dishes are broken down in a unique way of getting rid of the rice and using fresh vegetables, candies vegetables, dried fruits , nuts, fresh fruit and oils n fresh made house sauces. This makes the dishes lighter fuller flavors and allows you to try more.  They offer cooked items too. Excellent happy hour.  By far the best off strip Japanese fusion spot or in town for that matter. A+ desserts."

So we Yelped it and were directed off the strip to this minimalisticly decored and unpretentious appointed restaurant.\n\nWOW!!\n\nIt was very late...in fact early, when we began receiving the amazingly presented uniquely prepared dishes.  Flavored with that perfectly unexpected mouth \"zing\" and accented with items that brought the perfect mouth \"feel\", these dishes were truly a Most unplanned culinary treat!\n\nThe symphony of teamwork demonstrated by the wait crew was quite unexpected for the unimposing ambiance.  If it weren't for the suggestion of the gushingly \"proud of her establishment\" manager, who couldn't stop herself from helping her wait staff deliver these pieces of artwork, we would have missed the Crown of the night.\n\nMy son and I have been most fortunate to have dinned at some impressive restaurants.  (We actually came to Las Vegas purposed to eat at Picasso and Aliz\u00e9)   Each, father/son dinning experience has its defining dish that we remember forever with joy.\n\nThe Yonaka's Deserts were literally Insane with flavor and perfection.  I thought the adorable manager was simply offering us a closure to our meal, but let me tell you what.  The flavor memory of those 2 desert offerings, after already being blown away by the products of that kitchen, will be lifelong memory markers with my boy!\n\nThanks Yonaka Team! \n\nIt was MAGIC!"

I'm glad we did because I've been wanting to try this place for a while. We decided to go with the Omakase (I mean it's her birthday, go hard or go home right? haha) which is 8 courses per person. We were both being really indecisive otherwise I think I would've ordered a la cart. A lot of the menu items they served (I noticed) were on their happy hour menu too so I felt like that was kind of fucked and we were a bit cheated. Usually the omakase includes more of their top of the line items. I wasn't very happy with the chef's choices, but I can't complain too much... some of it was really good.\n\n1. Brussels Sprouts - brussel sprouts, lemon chili, mint, puffed rice. Weirdly enough (because this is probably the least Japanese out of everything), this was one of my favorite dishes.\n\n2. Sake Orenji - salmon, orange, yuzu sauce and masago on top. Salmon was really nice and fresh. It was a great, light start to our meal.\n\n3. Hamachi Midori - yellowtail, cucumber, avocado, yucca, green herb dressing. I was not a fan of this one. The green herb dressing was too lemony and very overpowering.\n\n4. Sushi - 2 nigiris each of salmon and the mackerel. I was good the the mackerel, but why would the Chef choose salmon? You gave us a whole plate of salmon as a starter??\n\n5. Uni to Ikura - sea urchin, salmon roe, hokkaido sea scallops, shiitake mushroom, kabocha, yuzu. Easily my favorite because duh I love anything uni!!! This is not usually included in the omakase but I paid extra to have it subbed in for another dish. Same yuzu sauce as the sake orenji so I wasn't sure why they didn't sub it for that one..................\n\n6. Wagyu beef filet skewer - red miso, thai chimichurri. We were told we would get one of the skewers and I'm thinking we were gonna get foie gras. Nope. This was my least favorite and really basic.\n\n7. Meat candy - caramel glazed kurobuta pork belly...... SOOOO good, but so fatty! BUT again, soooo so so good!! I really enjoyed this dish.\n\n8. Dessert was not good. Some kind of fruity mousse? Weird taste\n\n*Comped birthday dessert with green tea everything was 5 stars for sure.\n\nDespite only loving 4 out of 8 dishes, their service and the overall enjoyable/relaxing vibe is top notch. Our waitress was patient, informative, and understanding (I rushed her a lot because I was about to be late for my flight) -- she was awesome!"

For two if us, we split 6 dishes from the HH menu: salmon kale, tuna ceviche, the other cold dish, tuna hand roll, spicy crunchy shrimp roll, and the pork belly buns. They were all very good, but the salmon kale really stood out. They actually made kale taste awesome! We also had a cucumber saketini and a sake and grape drink that were both excellent. Overall 5 stars for food and drink. \nThe location is china town south, so not quite as packed in, but not any closer to me. \nThe ambiance is definitely cool - they've got the minimalist sushi thing going on, but with a rustic vibe. \nIt only loses points for price. For HH dinner and 2 drinks, we spent $70 for two. And that was basically half off regular prices. High! I would come back for happy hour, but not during regular price hours."

Since we had a sitter tonight we figured we'd check out Yokana. We had been given a heads up about the location (strip mall near China Town) and to make reservations (it's a small place, so you never know if you'll show up and they'll have a full house). We sat at the bar and could tell immediately this was not your typical sushi restaurant. The dishes looked like works of art and they weren't making a lot of the usual sushi suspects (aka rolls). The staff was very friendly and our server gave us the run down on their concept as well as some dishes to consider. They do stagger the flow of food to ensure that you are not overwhelmed with many dishes at once, and they are all shareable for 2-4....although there were definitely a few I could have kept for myself. In all my husband and I shared 9 different dishes (6 cold dishes, 1 order of \"traditional\" sushi, 1 hot dish, and a dessert). Honestly we felt every dish was unique and amazingly good. It was fun to try differently things, but we stuck mainly to the cold dishes simply because we preferred the lightness of the fish (we didn't want to fill up too quickly because we wanted to keep trying different things!).

The mushroom sauce was very addicting. The scallops were tender and seasoned mildly. What's also fun here is you cook the scallops on a hot stone.\n\nSuika Sakana (4.5 Stars) - Tuna, watermelon, jalape\u00f1o, mint, cilantro and basil oil. The combination was great but I hardly tasted the tuna which was supposed to be the main ingredient.\n\nSushi (Toro, Honmaguro, Hamachi, Ebi) (5 Stars) the fish was very fresh. I loved the Hamachi the best. The garlic butter on the Ebi was a nice touch. Really good.\n\nIbushi Hamachi (4.5 Stars) Smoked Yellowtail, Figs, Asian Pear, Cassava Chips and Almonds. This is a good dish as well but I hardly tasted the smokiness of the yellowtail. \n\nChicken Karaage (3.5 Stars) this was the most disappointing dish from their fabulous menu. I didn't like the sauce that was coated with the chicken. I've tasted way better Chicken Karaages. \n\nChocolate Dessert (5 Stars) (Lime ice cream, chocolate, mint puree, avocado puree) This delectable dessert is the bomb! A great way to end a meal. The combination and presentation were awesome. The best part was the dehydrated chocolate! Tasted like choco wafers. \n\nA must try restaurant for all you Japanese cuisine aficionados out there. \n\nWe will be back."

We loved that we could just park and walk in, rather than have to walk through a hotel casino. We arrived around 9 pm and there were only two other tables (the restaurant was full by the time we left around 10:45). The waitress was incredibly friendly, honest, and gave us some great tips about what to order. From memory, the brussel sprouts were delicious (my first time eating brussel sprouts!), the Salmon with orange was my favorite, and their rolls were okay but then again I don't like seaweed. My little brother is a very picky eater but they had some thin sliced steak that you grill on a hot stone at the table, he ate every last bite. Their appetizer portions are huge in comparison to the entrees. My family shares everything so we just ordered a bunch of plates and took a couple bites of everything. With a bottle of wine, appetizers, entrees, and dessert, we came out to $120 (great price for a family of 5 in Vegas!!!). We will definitely return when we are in town."

Edemame is covered in some kind of seasoned salt or cajun spice, which is no good. We got there at 6:00 on a Friday and it was completely empty. Bad sign, this place won't last long. Owner and staff were very nice. Priding themselves on Japanese cuisine intermixed with food around the world. Which begs the question, why is your menu then smaller than most sushi restaurants? And come on, no sashimi at all on the happy hour menu, and 2 weak rolls on it. Bad menu. Go to a real Japanese restaurant and skip this \"modern\" aka failing restaurant. We spent 30 bucks a person and went away hungry, could have hit up yama sushi or other great choices in Vegas and had all you can eat with better selection."

We ordered the Omakase thinking this would be their best dishes.  The first two dishes had excess lemon (citrus) flavor and most of the other dishes were very salty.  All of the dishes masked the flavor of the fish with citrus or other sauces, which makes me doubt the freshness of the fish.  On top of the mediocre food quality, the prices were very high.  I recommend you look elsewhere if you are looking for quality Japanese dining."

With its modern and chic decor and inventive Japanese cuisine, there was no other choice.  The only gripe I have is they didn't sing me Happy Birthday.  :)\n\nI got the omakase sashimi and the chef didn't disappoint in his/her choices.  They served fatty everything, just the way us sushi die hards like them.  The other dishes were superb as well.  The orange salmon had my mom wanting to find something to soak up the sauce.  The foie gras was perfectly grilled.  The fried brussel sprouts were crunchy, sweet and salty at the same time.  The shishito peppers had a nice snap and I kept grabbing the sweet bacon lardons.  Yum.  The fried cornish game hen was nice but got overshadowed by the other superb dishes.\n\nI always order the home made ginger ale.  It is good for your digestion and it is refreshing.\n\nThe dinner came out to $25 per person which is quite reasonable for the kind of food you are getting.  It could get pricey because you are ordering dishes to share for the table so watch out.  Hard to resist ordering everything on the menu."

Service was really amazing.  My server Ashlee was very attentive, gave me great food suggestions, and made it easy for me to be a solo diner.\nThe chefs in front of me were also great - I did not get any names but we had a cross-section of Asia with a Japanese female chef, a Thai male and a Filipino male.  I also met the executive chef, who is Filipino.\nI received a hot towel to prepare for the meal, and ordered a pot of hot green tea.\n\nThe amuse bouche: king oyster mushroom \"scallop\" with yamaimo (mountain yam), raw okra slices, yuzu tobiko - a bit hard to pick up with chopsticks so I had to ask for a fork - the raw okra was awesome, and everyone knows I love a good yuzu...anything!\n\nSpecial dish from the chef: fresh (large) cubes of watermelon topped with cilantro, in a lime-fish sauce-coconut cold broth.  When I first tasted this, it exploded with Thai flavors and was more delicious that I expected it to be.  It was a nice gesture to receive this dish gratis.\n\nAppetizer: crispy brussel sprouts with lemon chili, mint and puffed rice.  I love brussel sprouts with crispy leaves (I make this at home with basalmic and olive oil) - these were different because they were halved, with some of the stem on, in a powerful citrus-y sauce that was deeeelicious.  I could probably make a meal off of this dish.  A MUST order.\n\nNigiri: I ordered 3 pieces next, the shime saba (Norweigan mackerel) with ginger, scallion and lemon zest; hamachi (yellowtail) with jalepeno miso and cilantro leaf; and the gyutan (beef tongue with pesto).  The hamachi was good but not too fatty...sauce was tasty.  The saba was a star - perfectly cured and the flavor highlighted by the lemon zest.  The beef tongue was SO tender, it was glazed and in the shape on a rectangle, wrapped with a seaweed wrapper around the nigiri, topped with basil and pine nut puree. It was really unique and I would get it again.\n\nSakana dore: fish of the day (tonight was choice between salmon and albacore and I chose salmon), apple slices, zucchini chips, bell pepper (yellow and red in long shreds), tosaka seaweed, micro greens, and yuzu honey.  The apples really tasted great with the yuzu honey, which was spiked with aji amarillo (yellow Peruvian chile pepper) and had quite a nice back heat to it.\n\nNext for my pre-dessert, I ordered uni, with candied quinoa and tamari.  The tamari is not necessary here because the uni is really some of the freshest I have ever seen or tasted.  I also hate quinoa but the candied nature added an interesting crunch.  I did not like the candied quinoa on my nigiri at Uchi either, but this was still a delicious bite of food.  Normally I end at uni, but I decided to go for dessert since I was doing a lot of tasting.  First, I asked the chef in front of me if I could try the mentaiko aioli served with the toro.  He happily obliged.  It was really delicious.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the avo hanimu.  The menu only says \"avocado, lime, peanut, honey\" and Ashlee gave me a brief description, but when I received it, it was HUGE and not at all what I expected.  It has these disks of lime curd? with a peanut-sugar crumble, lime \"chips\" that were like sugar glass, and then 2 textures of avocado - a frozen mousse and a sorbet.  The avocado was really tasty (I love a good avocado smoothie so bring it on as a dessert!) but the dish was a bit disjointed and I wish I had other people there to share it with me!\n\nWhen I was preparing to leave, Clint B. and his wife arrived and I told them to order the brussel sprouts.  Great ambiance, wonderful service, creative eats, and a lot more to try!"

What an incredible mix of hot and cold dishes, sweet and sour, so many amazing flavors as well as four premium sushi dishes, this truly was an experience. Of note are the yellowtail with apple and chili, the pork belly with kimchi apples, and the premium flounder sashimi was so smooth. The dessert was a variety of mango delights including a mango flan and a sorbet. My kids were still hungry (!) so we ordered a cookies and milk dessert--which is extraordinary! Three fresh baked cookies, cereal milk, and a chocolate chip and cream \ntopping. This was truly and event as we were there for nearly 90 minutes as the food kept coming.

Dot get me wrong, if your ordering maybe couple dishes or eating by your self, then I'm sure it's fine.  \nFor large group it's the worst place to eat."

Every course got better and better. I travel the country and have the privilege of experiencing some of America's finest eateries. This is now sitting on my top 5!!!\n\nHad the pleasure in partaking on several plates that gave us a taste of the whole menu.

Food was good nonetheless, but I feel like I wouldn't try to many things more than once, but hey, they have a lot of things to try.\n\nWhat I had:\n-Beet fries (Unique. Tasted nice. I wouldn't really push this one that much though.)\n-Kara age (Kinda felt like calling it Vietnamese chicken.. Basil, lime and sweet chili sauce. It was good though, and only $5.)\n-O-toro (As long as its fresh, its always good. Five slices for $25 so it's priced averagely.\n-Wagyu sliders (Nice idea and execution. Pretty much a bun made of crispy rice with Wagyu beef and a jalapeno. Didn't really blow my mind, however.)\n-Uni to Ikura (Best part of the meal. A mix of scallop, ikura, uni, lemon, orange and a pumpkin puree. The texture and flavor mixed very well. It was REALLY good, but just so unique I'd only feel like eating it once.)\n\nI heard the dessert is awesome though, and wished I could've tried, but we were pretty full. They give us some complimentary snacks like freshly cut watermelon with some basil. Rice is complimentary as well if you ask for it."

Even for dinner, prices are pretty reasonable compared to lot of quality Japanese restaurants serving this caliber of food. If it's your first time here, the omakase is the way to go. The ambience is nice for a date night and the service is prompt and friendly.\n\nAlmost everything is good here. Standing out from their regular menu were the uni to ikura dish, wagyu beef and the seared foie gras sushi. The latter is just so buttery, it melts in your mouth. There are also several must-try items on their happy hour menu like the crispy brussel sprouts; the sake orenji which consists of salmon sashimi on top of sweet oranges and special sauce; and the chuka buns which are yummy pork belly baos. Don't care what those talking chihuahuas say, this is the place to go for fourth meal.\n\nWith more delicious dishes to try, Yonaka is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to eat."

We also came during happy hour and were glad to see there were some pretty good discounts from the regular menu. We thought it was dumb that we had to sit in a certain section of the restaurant to order from the happy hour menu, but that's not a big deal. \n\nStarted with brussels sprouts and beet fries that were both ok but we didn't particularly enjoy them. Brussels sprouts were too sweet and the beet fries seemed like they were missing something. \n\nThen we had a coconut ceviche that was a chore to finish. The fish came in big chunks and was very underseasoned. \n\nWe enjoyed the sushi, but I didn't think anything was all that great. \n\nFor our hot dishes we got tea braised ribs, salmon curry, and a pork belly dish. The ribs pretty good. The salmon curry and pork belly were terrible. The curry had an overwhelmingly strong jalepeno taste that ruined the whole dish. The pork belly had a neat presentation where the waitress broke an egg and mixed it in with the hot pork belly to cook the egg, but when we tasted it all we could taste was the mayo. Our waitress was nice enough to notice we didn't eat it and asked us what we didn't like and took it off the bill."

            "review": "With the wide array of Asian fare available in Las Vegas beyond the strip, Japanese cuisine continues to lead the pack in terms of variety and innovation.  With heavy emphasis on presentation in Japanese dishes(often to create the illusion of more with less), they inevitably begin to resemble works of art.  If Japanese small plates in Las Vegas were to be represented by famous artists I would label them as the following:\n\nRaku= Picasso- the old master, consistently brilliant and timeless with indisputable genius and imagination\n\nKyara= Cezanne- transition between the traditionalists and the modernists pulling in influences from various sources \n\nIchiza= Warhol- iconic and often overhyped/controversial in public opinion\n\nWith Yonaka, Rene Magritte comes to mind:\n-Magritte is from Belgium (the signature appetizer is the crispy \"Brussels\" sprouts with puffed rice, coincidence?)\n\n-Often overlooked and underrated (much like Yonaka's location off the strip in an unassuming retail center on Flamingo and Decatur) \n\n-Challenges convention while giving new meaning to the familiar (compressed watermelon with house made fish sauce and thai basil? But of course!)\n\n-Much like his most famous work \"The Son of Man\" (http://uploads2.wikipaintings.org/images/rene-magritte/son-of-man-1964(1).jpg) there is  frequent juxtaposition of fruit in unexpected settings at Yonaka, like the dynamite combination of orange supremes with salmon and tobiko or the tender cuts of wagyu served with peach salsa and slices of georgia peach, which all work in surrealistic harmony.\n\n-Pierce's Brosnan's title character in \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" takes inspiration from Magritte's \"Son of Man\" to pull off a seemingly impossible art heist at the climactic conclusion, and the happy hour menu offered at 5-630PM and 11-2AM offer food and libations at such low prices/great value, your bill will seem like the steal of the century.\n\nPerfect for a first date, gathering of friends, or an intro to the local scene for an out-of-town visitor, Yonaka is modern Asian cuisine executed to perfection, and the food does in fact tastes as good if not better than it looks."

The only issue with this is that each plate is so good you want 5 more.\n\nAppetizers:\n- Crispy Brussels Sprouts; I love Brussels sprouts so I really enjoyed, no strong flavor added possibly just salt and pepper. Most likely roasted to get the crispness\n- Karaage; Little pieces of fried chicken, simple and flavorful, came out nice and hot\n\nSashimi:\n- Suika Sakana; Tuna paired with watermelon and jalape\u00f1o. Interesting mix of flavors but it was unique and delicious, topped with mint and cilantro \n- Sake Orenji; Salmon doused in a tangy fruity dressing and served with mandarin oranges \n- Salmon Belly: No other salmon belly compares. Literally dissolves in your mouth. You can taste how fresh it is!\n- Seared Sea Scallops; The best scallops I've ever had. They were cooked and seasoned perfectly; not undercooked or overcooked which is very common... I could eat this all day! \n\nI honestly don't know how anyone could give this place anything lower than a 4 or 5.

Located in a small strip mall, Yonaka is fairly easy to see driving by. Floor to ceiling glass walls adorn the front of the restaurant. Inside the decor has a very clean, neat & modern look.\nSince there was five of us, we ordered a very wide variety of dishes. A couple of dishes that stood out is the Sake Orenji, their take on salmon sashimi. The flavor of orange stood out and it complemented the fish quite well. Nana Iro, hamachi sashimi. It came with a mix of grapefruit, avocado, tomato & pickled fennel which also formed a well combination. The tea brined ribs are finger licking good, although they do take quite awhile to prepare so remember to order them early in the meal. The mango panna cotta & mango ice cream paired very well with the nutty & saltiness of pistachios.\nThe service was good. The employees were very attentive & considerate. Some might consider Yonaka slightly on the pricey side but there is a happy hour to take advantage of. In my opinion, it's definitely worth a try. I give Yonaka 4.5 stars."

This is a modern take on Japanese Cuisine but tapas style. All of the dishes were great but the Cool Platess were excellent. My favorites are crudo, sake orenji, konpa. I could have done without the sliders and the takorizo. There is nothing wrong with those dishes but I didn't like the Mediterranean take on the takorizo and the sliders were a bit dry. However, 15 great dishes out of 17 ordered is fine by me. The fish was fresh. The ponzu sauce was flavorful with  a great soy base and bright citrus notes. Each dish looked like a work of art. Every ingredient in all their dishes were thoughtfully prepared and placed harmoniously to produce a masterful bite. I found out later that their soy sauce is specially blended for them.

After visiting Yonaka, I swear they used some kind of alchemy. Maybe in the back of the kitchen they have a philosopher's stone churning out magic. \n\nThat magic of theirs is putting out dehydrated this, compressed that, candied this and maintaining a clean presentation that has no \"odour\" of pretentiousness. What more can one ask for in off strip dining? Really, the only thing that could make the experience better is if they threw money at you. Chances are if that ever happened, it would be folded nicely in some origami. \n\nIs there an option to mark \"Yes\" for \"Good for dates\"? If your date is not a success after visiting Yonaka you're doing something wrong. \n\nIf you're not convinced on visiting Yonaka yet, then let me tell you what I ate! The Crispy Brussels sprouts are a must get. The dish comes in a surprisingly generous portion and very clean flavors. Unless you really love edamame, or craving it I would pass on the grilled edamame. HOWEVER you would be crazy to pass on ordering the Sake Orenji and its tasty citrus flavors! I believe that its only $7 during happy hour too. Now the Wagyu ishiyaki was good, but a bit gimmicky, if you want something interactive then by all means go ahead. For me the stone cooled a bit quickly after about the 5th piece and took a bit longer to cook the delicious sliver of marbleized beef. The Pokuyaki is recommended, comes in large portions of Kurobata pork, complimented by a fennel puree, dehydrogenated fennel, sliced jalapenos and granny smith apples. Finally to desert (phew!), just take a look at it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas#HbyoBxcqDscvxc9Zvway0A) if you don't want to try that, there must be an error in your DNA replications, or you're allergic to chocolate. \n\nI believe the happy hour starts at 11pm to close (around 2am?) with a decent amount of selection (SAKE ORENJI!), $3 Asahi draft, and wine.\n\nThe only thing *I* would like to see from Yonaka in improvements is a better beer's list. They have the classic Japanese beers, but with craft beer booming in Japan there are lots of tasty options that could be added and pair well with a lot of their food."

The chefs paired some unique flavors well in some traditional dishes. \n\nI also ordered a Sakura Cake Martini. Absolutely delicious! Sake, cherry, vanilla, mint, lime juice, and graham cracker dusting on the rim of the martini glass.\n\nImpressed with the entire experience from the moment we stepped in the door, until the owner greeted us on the way out. We definitely will be returning customers."

            "review": "What a novel idea (at least compared to the Strip)... a restaurant whose concept focuses on innovative and artistic food as opposed to the dining atmosphere. Dishes here are equal parts substance and style with ingredients that work together.\n\nSome combinations might seem odd, but most work brilliantly. And, they're not just a million random ingredients that are thrown together. You can actually taste how they benefit each dish.\n\nLisa R. was heading out as I came in and she recommended some great dishes. The brussels sprouts are a must. I didn't think I'd find any better than the ones at Meat and Three but Yonaka's is tops. The hamachi were generously sliced and the jalapeno miso sauce gave it a unique touch. I've never been a big fan of uni, but the execution here, with it's candied quinoa, is good enough to turn many skeptics into fans.\n\nTeri C. raved about the sake orenji in her review so I had to try that. Yeah, it was just as amazing as she described it. Another must when dining here.The avocado nigiri was good, the agemaki roll (baby yellowtail, avocado, yuzu kosho, cilantro lightly battered into a tempura) was tasty and had an interesting profile as it had a bold flavor on the first bite, but finished bland. The watermelon cubes with cilantro and fish sauce was delicious -- another dish with a variety of discernible flavors in one bite.\n\nI finished with the Chokoreto ($7) - lime, chocolate, mint, avocado. It wasn't my favorite dessert but I appreciate the uniqueness of it. I could have done without the lime sorbet. I think this dish had too much going on with the textures and flavors. The chocolate crumbles and chocolate mousse (? -- or whatever it was) was amazing and if those two were the dominant flavors I would have loved it. Still, I cleaned the plate, so you know it wasn't bad.\n\nThis place might be new but you can already tell it's going to be a hit. The Strip can keep its \"vibe dining\" with their music turned up to level 11 and all the douche bags it attracts. I'll take the thoughtful and creative food at Yonaka any day.\n\n4.5 Stars"

The only negative I can think of is that they change the menu often so on occasion the item we were hoping to order wasn't there but whatever they change is just as good or better. I'd offer some recommendations but really anything your order is amazing.\n\nYonaka is all about the details which is big for me.  The place is always spotless and the service goes above and beyond.  I called ahead once for my wife's birthday and when they set our table, they had special napkins that said happy birthday and brought out a special dessert.  Another time we came with our daughter and they had a special box of crayons and all kinds of stuff to keep her busy, plus they gave her this cool clip to help her use the chop sticks.\n\nCan't wait to go back!"

As a person of Japanese descent I was offended when I pronounced the items properly and my waiter didn't understand me and \"corrected\" me re-saying the word with a very American/English pronunciation. My friend and I ordered about 8 different tapas which they brought out all at once, our table was so crowded and the manager had told us that they were a very new restaurant and asked for suggestions or comments. I told her that I felt the plates were too big for the table since we had no room. Instead of saying to the affect of noted or thank you, she says to us well the plates are meant to be ordered one at a time so that they can be focused on one by one, to which I said I understand that but as a foodie I like a blend of various flavors or how about if they know that plates should be focused on one by one how about you only bring the table one or two plates at a time till we finish and then bring us the new dishes as we finish them. How dare they ask me for an opinion or comment then tell me something like that. I asked for green tea and was served mugicha (barley tea) which is fine but if for example I order a hamburger and you serve me a tofu burger it's two DIFFERENT things, my waiter didn't know the difference, yet he told us how he lived in Japan for years. I realize this is \"modern\" fusion food but I only liked one item out of 8 we ordered. \n\nYonaka means midnight as in 0000 hour, blank slate, beginning of something new. Personal opinion: was not my kind of fusion or restaurant."

            "review": "A modern and elegant Japanese restaurant popping up at the intersection of Flamingo and Decatur was definitely unexpected. But here, Yonaka takes fusion and knocks it out of the park. Too often, Asian fusion takes a wrong turn (at least on my taste buds). But I could just die at the perfection of each and every dish served up here. Its beautiful to look at and even better to taste.\n\nI'll start by saying that I've left every meal feeling light and healthy. Nothing is overladen with fat, sodium or sauce and I've come to prefer eating my uncooked fish here over any other place in Vegas. Fusion or not, this place is the real deal. Top-quality fish and expertly sliced nigiri. We sampled the Toro, Salmon Belly, Saba, Hamachi, Hirame, Scallop and Beef Tongue. The Saba was a winner (I love my cured mackerel) but the Hamachi had to be my favorite flavored with jalapeno miso. The beef tongue wasn't my cup of tea. It seemed overly dry and had a slight jerky quality to it which only added to the oddness of it being served as nigiri.\n\nAfter that, it was all enjoyable again. We came late and ordered a the Konpa and Brussel Sprouts off the Happy Hour menu (Everyday 5-630 & 11-2). Those brussel sprouts are totally addicting and the innovative combination of salmon, yellowtail and apricots is news to me. Toss in some jalapenos and tomato chips and you've found the must order item on the HH menu (also available on the regular menu w/ a higher price tag). On the main menu, their take on crudo is perfection with candied quinoa. The tuna nicoise, machitaki, umi matsuri, and shirohana were all equally as fabulous. Next trip, I'm trying some of their hot items for sure!\n\nAfter all of that, I have to rave over the prices. Rave in positivity and gloriousness. As if the already low-prices weren't alluring enough, the HH menu is downright irresistible. Recherche, creative and artistic cuisine in a strip mall on Flamingo is as random as it gets. But as soon as you see the modern and minimalistic design of the interior, you will be impressed from first glance to final taste. \n\nBasically, everything is amazing. And needless to say, like everyone else I'm beyond fangirl-ing (or fanboy-ing for my male Yelpers) over Yonaka."

It's artistic, vibrant, and in some ways delicate. The food is explosive! I feel like there's a party going on in my mouth when I eat something from here. There is a nice balance of texture and flavors. Powerful bites of citrus, strong hints of heat, and sweet accents to smooth over your palette. Mmmhhhmmmm. \n\nMy suggestions: THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS! Crisp, light and airy with hints of zest. Sake Orenji - fresh cut salmon, orange slices, and this tingly orange oil that's just...drool...I have no words for! The tea-brined ribs are scrumptious. Sauced in sweet & sassy perfection. For parties or 2 or more, go for the 8-12 course meals. The 8 course is $98 and consists of the kitchen's fave dishes with a few surprises along the way. Good portioned sizes. Also, the Happy Hour deals are great. \n\nThe service is on point. The staff knows the menu and are super accommodating if you have specific wants or needs.

However, the nigiri took longer to make than I expected. \n\nThe waitress told me that the nigiri took more time to make because they cut the fish from the block (in order to keep the freshness intact). \n\nI was perfectly fine with this but when it took more than 25 minutes to get 7 pieces of nigiri, I was disappointed.\n\nFor the price, I was expecting a little better. Still it's worth a revisit."

            "review": "It's called Yonaka and the style is different from any sushi place I've ever been.  They make all their sauces from scratch and the seafood is shipped in daily (you can taste the freshness and quality).  I went with friends who love Nobu and this has even become their new favorite.  So good that we all went back the same night for a second helping.  The service is excellent (very attentive) and they bring you complimentary dishes and items to refresh your palate.  They explain the dishes, make excellent recommendations, clear the dishes, bring hot towels, etc, etc.     \n\nIt's tapas style so dishes are small but you can order a lot and try different things.  Here's the list of items that we loved:\n\nCrispy Brussel Sprouts, fried, charred sprouts with seasoning. He best starter to any meal.\n\nThe Sake Orenji, salmon over orange with yuzu.  Omg!  We had friends that don't like salmon love this dish (tasted almost like yellowtail).   \n\nNana Iro, Yellowtail with grapefruit, avocado, fennel and chili sauce.  Flavors complimented each other so well.  \n\nWagyu Beef on Hot Stone, highly marbled and melt in your mouth beef that you cook on a hot stone they provide and it comes with a mushroom diping sauce and a ponzu style.  \n\nKaraage, fried chicken with onions, cilantro and jalapeno (the first visit was bomb and the second time the flavors were there but it wasn't as crispy) \n\nTea Brined Pork Rib, tangy citrus honey glazed Chinese style ribs that reminded me of really good charsui.\n\nThere was also this Pork belly dish with slices of spicy apples that were melt in your mouth good.  I didn't see it on the menu but it was fabulous (added picture if anyone can name it for us)  \n\nThere were two desserts both good but hard to describe.  One was a white jiggly custard that had a mango center the other had a green tea cake and strawberry ice cream over a bed of coffee flakes, the perfect crunch to every bite.     \n\nThere's also the Yonaka Omakase ($90) for 7 course tasting menu good for 2 persons (some of the above was part of the Omakase and we added the rest).  We had a group of 6."

Thank you to David V. for the recommendation on the best sushi + happy hour that we've had in quite a while.\n\nWe arrived during happy hour and were greeted immediately by some happy faces.  The service is phenomenal, and our server was attentive and professional.  We had a handful of questions about the small plates, recommendations, and cocktails they had available, and all of our questions were thoroughly answered.\n\nPrior to dining, we were treated to a ginger apple/fruit mixed amuse-bouche which was incredible in itself.  How can one bite have so much flavor?  Seriously delectable.\n\nFor our meal, we ordered the chuka buns (pork buns), sashimi, and California rolls.  I'm a little disappointed I didn't end up trying the brussels sprouts that everyone's so clearly raving about, but I suppose that's for next time.  The chuka bun was delicious, and the kimchi gave me a spicy kick in the mouth.  The fish was fresh and the visual presentation was exceptional.  The sashimi was almost too beautiful to eat!\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=eWTu-jCx_xakSovzb21UNg&userid=FAJSZu5vgxibnUN7HxKItQ (chuka buns)\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=fvQ4S0Qtg996zDuh-Tk4YA&userid=FAJSZu5vgxibnUN7HxKItQ (sashimi)\n\nI highly recommend the cucumber basil martini.  It was refreshing and complimented nicely with the sushi.\n\nWe couldn't pass up the greenies.  Green tea brownies, strawberry ice cream, and white chocolate is the perfect way to end your meal.  I'd visit again just for drinks and dessert.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kqvP774Oh4qOAQYTjhNe8w&userid=FAJSZu5vgxibnUN7HxKItQ (greenies)\n\nYou're absolutely getting what you pay for with Yonaka.

O.M.G. 2 other tables on a Friday night at 9:30pm, I should've taken it as a sign... \n\nOrdered:\nx UNI TO IKURA (sea urchin, salmon roe, hokkaido sea scallops, shiitake mushroom, kabocha, yuzu kosho) - ughhhhhhhh, the uni did not taste fresh AT ALL. The scallops were fishy and the best part of this was the puree... presentation was great, but the flavors were TERRIBLE. None of the ingredients complimented each other, nor did they work in ANY way.\nx SHIRO MISO (shiro miso, tofu, negi) - came warm... and cold by our 4th sip.\nx Hamachi sashimi - we ordered this because we thought it would come with jalapeno miso and cilantro like the menu says, but it did not. Just came simply sashimi style... while the fish tasted fresh, cuts were unpleasantly huge.\nx Seared Chutoro - off menu item that we requested and probably the best/only good thing of the night.\nx HOTATE (sea scallops nigiri w/ avocado, spicy aioli) - nonono. I didn't even eat mine because the babes said it was gross. He only ate HALF of his too.\nx EBI nigiri - tastes the same everywhere. Not bad, but not great. A little to dry IMO.\nX Kampachi sashimi w/ blood orange and cilantro - I like the first 2 bites of this, but the fish became too much... their cuts are ridiculously large here and I hate that more than anything when it comes to sushi...\n\nService was OK, but overall had a MEH experience. Would not come again! I was feeling a little uneasy after..."

The \"meat candy\" - caramel glazed pork belly - was a personal favorite; don't miss it!  It was probably only surpassed by the wagyu skewers with the chimichurri, which very well may have been the best piece of meat I've ever had (make me a full steak that way some time and I'll sing songs of you to my grandchildren.)\n\nLest you think I'm prejudiced toward the land critters, the fish is off-the-charts fresh and delicious too.  Trust the omakase.  The chef is your friend and trusted guide.\n\nNice selection of sake, to boot.\n\nOh yes -- dessert.  Choco Ten Ways is the way to go.  Not going to spoil it for you, but CHOCOLATE IN TEN DIFFERENT FORMS.  Split 2 ways, for sure, after a big meal."

It's pretty pricey, but I think it's occasionally worth the cost if you know which few menu items to avoid. So, let me get that out of the way first!\n\nKaraage (Fried): too sweet, too much fish sauce. I just didn't like this at all. It had potential, but I felt like it was done poorly.\n\nChokoreto (Dessert): this dish is trying way too hard. Far too many contrasting flavors, and most of the combinations of them just didn't go well together. Yuzu ice cream was novel but awkward, and the combination of lime and chocolate just isn't good. My friend and I both really disliked this one.\n\nBut now that I've said those things, let me reiterate that if you decide to splurge on a meal here, you'll probably be very happy that you did. I strongly recommend:\n\nSushi omakase, their fish quality is truly excellent.\nPokuyaki, absolutely incredible interplay of crispy textures, fruity flavors, and meltingly tender pork.\nFlan with cheddar ice cream (was on special the day I went). This dessert was mind-blowing. Yes, it was cheddar ice cream, and it was amazing. Seriously, get this if it's available.\nAnything with wagyu - they serve excellent quality steak dishes.\n\nThe service is very sharp and not a single beat was missed during the entire meal. However, the chefs were not talkative or engaging at all. Overall, I recommend this restaurant, but you should expect to spend a good chunk of money here."

I had been really excited as I love sushi/Japanese food, and the reviews sounded great. \n\nIn their defense, my girlfriends and I made the mistake of meeting here for happy hour when they had a special event/tasting menu going on, and the entire place was booked out, so we sat at the bar. \n\nService was a disaster at best. They were busy with the event, but they knew they were sold out and should have either brought in more staff or not had the bar area open for regular service.\n\nOur drinks took close to 20minutes. White wine was nearly room temperature and came in tiny, cheap looking glassware that is generally only found in cheesy local casinos and dingy downtown bars. Specialty drinks tasted watered down and reminiscent of Kool-aid. \n\nService was spotty at best. It once took 20min to get the attention of an employee- even though we were sitting at the bar. \n\nFood didn't arrive for nearly an hour after that... and in haphazardly timed segments to boot. I could have forgiven the service in light of the event- if the food had been as fantastic as I had hoped. Sadly, it wasn't even good. We had a hamachi appetizer and some other raw fish plate. Both were cut thickly and tasted fishy. \n\nI forget what else we had (bad sign), I only remember that all of the starters seemed bland and thoughtless. Such a disappointment.

My husband and I love Brussel Sprouts so it was easy for him to convince us to check it out during happy hour (5:00pm-6:30pm and 11:00pm to close). You cannot make reservations for the bar tables where happy hour is served. It's first come, first served, but I wouldn't anticipate a wait. We were the only patrons until 5:30, then tables slowly started to fill. The space is modern and comfortable. Comfort is important because it takes time to craft their beautiful dishes. Cold sake and Asahi drafts ($3) are available during happy hour along with a couple other options. The menu offers a variety, allowing you to create a feast. Our party of three enjoyed the following:\n\nBeet Fries ($5) I didn't expect to enjoy these as much as I did. Crisp, earthy and slightly sweet. They were addicting. \n\nCrispy Brussel Sprouts ($6) were highly addicting. They were caramelized and dressed with lemon chili and topped with puffed rice. \n\nSake Orenji ($7) is one of their best sellers. It's beautifully presented. The flavor is fresh and clean, with a hint of orange. I thought the salmon pieces were cut too large. It would be better with more delicate cuts of fish.\n\nHamachi chili ($7?) was another beautiful dish. Well balanced and great flavor, but again, the fish was sliced too thick.\n\nNegitoro Roll ($7) is blue fin tuna belly with scallions. Tasty.\n\nCrunchy spicy tuna hand roll ($5) were a pleasant surprise. I really enjoyed the crunch, it offered a contrast texture to the soft spicy tuna. Very fresh and great flavor.\n\nChuka buns ($7) were quickly devoured. The pork belly was tender and nicely rendered, loved the crispness of the green apple, and the heat from the jalapeno.\n\nAvocado nigiri ($1) so simple, but well composed with a hint of soy and citrus.\n\nService was attentive but disjointed to start. We were approached by no less than three staff members before identifying our server. All in all, it's a great little find."

I wanted to treat myself to a decent meal and saw that this place was highly regarded by the Yelp community.  Wow!  Did you guys ever let me down!\n\nI sat at the sushi bar and intent on ordering the 9 item \"omakase\".  To allay any confusion, their omakase is more of a set meal of menu items that they pump out conveyor belt style.  Not to be confused with an actual omakase meal you will find in a good Japanese restaurant.\n\nThe sushi chef did not greet me at the sushi bar nor did he acknowledge my presence at any point during the meal.  To be fair, he was pumping out omakases in buffet sized portions at a very prolific rate.\n\nA server came to take my order, after which she was nowhere to be found for the rest of the evening.\n\nThe dishes were brought out in sequence.  A different server would bring the dish out, mispronounce the name of the dish in butchered Japanese and then disappear.\n\nI'm not sure if I caught them on a bad night, but the service was incredibly slow.  After finishing the first dish, it took another 20 minutes for the second dish to appear.  In between dishes, the servers did their best to avoid refilling my water glass or to otherwise look in my general direction.  By the time the fourth dish came out, over an hour had passed since I had sat down.\n\nAs I was concerned over dying of old age before the ninth dish arrived, I decided to cut my losses, got out of my seat to flag down a server, paid for the first 4 dishes ala carte, and left.  As I was paying, I saw two other patrons at the bar get up and decide to do the same thing.\n\nI am by no means a sushi snob nor a stickler for customer service.  But I have lived in Tokyo before and eaten at countless sushi restaurants.  The level of service at this restaurant would be unacceptable at your local McDonald's let alone a fine dining establishment where I am shelling out $109 for the meal.\n\nThere are literally hundreds of sushi restaurants in the Las Vegas area that offer adequate to outstanding sushi at much better value and customer service."

Salmon was fresh and the orange made it sweet yet savory (ponzu sauce I think).\nMisses:  \n-  Beet fries.  No real flavor.  Had to use the aioli to make it palatable\n-  Blue fin tuna.

When i took a peak of the kitchen, i saw that the cooks was not in a rush to make plates, but have plenty of time to talk with servers. Hopefully they will get their act together in 6 mo. I might go back.\nIt ashame to have good food but very slow service. At this rate they wont make any profit."

Poor waiter though, I kept asking him questions and he had to keep going back to the chefs.  He was a very patient dude.\nHowever, the real treat was the \"MangoCotta\".  Vegan, gluten-free OMFG goodness.  You'd NEVER know it!  I can't sing this dessert's praises enough.  It's one of the best desserts I've ever had.  I've been to Per Se in NYC, this dessert blew theirs out of the water.\nIf you go there and don't order the MangoCotta - you are SO missing out.  I'm going there again tonight and ordering that for dinner!\nThis is a great little find.  Very willing to accommodate, open until midnight (thank the gods since my husband made me wait an hour at the airport while he got a \"cheaper\" car) and damn, so good!"

It works, but it's not my thing.\nFollowed up with the CHUKA BUNS, which were easily the largest buns I've ever had with thick, succulent slices of fatty, flavorful pork in a beautiful sauce topped with apple, jalapeno, and a relish that all complemented one another perfectly.\nServer recommended their MIDORI CEVICHE, with apple, avocado, tuna, and a Midori sauce that resembled a pesto- very light, seemed like it was missing a citrus element to truly be a ceviche, but I enjoyed eating this with yucca chips.\nCRISPY SPICY TUNA HANDROLL was tasty with a spicy mayo sauce and an explosion of fresh fish and nori flavor- perfect hint of sushi to tide me over because I couldn't justify getting the Fat Duck roll this visit.\n\nLastly, we opted for a new dessert. The Greenies was an amazing flavor and texture adventure, and this time the Chocolate 10 Ways didn't disappoint either: highlights were the white chocolate tofu and some kind of chocolate dust that reminded me of the old-school Nestle Quik powder, except without the chemical aftertaste or weird foam at the top of my drink. Again, another dish that married various flavors and textures in a harmonious way, to great effect.\n\nService, as always, was stellar. Sitting at the bar this visit allowed us to see various dishes being prepared, and it's crazy how familiar I am with the menu to be able to identify which dish each is after only two visits. You might say I'm obsessed.\nStill have to schedule another trip here for the famed Fat Duck roll and the 20-minute made-to-order Milk N Cookies dessert!"

            "review": "Let me get it out of the way that this, after two visits, is probably my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.   But you say statistically that's not a large enough sample size to make that sort of declaration you say?   I REVIEW WITH MY HEART AND NOT YOUR FANCY STATISTICS.   With reviews from my heart, I type a lot, so be warned:\n\nLet me start with the service, which starts with the hostess who on my 2nd visit already made me feel like Norm from Cheers with a hearty \"welcome back!\"   Full disclosure she also thought that I had been there before during my first visit, so perhaps this is all a big marketing ploy to make everyone feel like Norm.   The waitress both times was helpful with recommendations and the food and refills came out quickly and impeccably timed so there was never too little or too much food waiting to be devoured.  They're a well oiled machine of asian fusion delivery at Yonaka.\n\nAs for the food itself, each time has started with a different amuse.  I can't remember what exactly, but they did their job in amusing the mouth each time.  For what we ordered, both times we started with the brussel sprouts which lived up to the hype and then some.  My favorite appetizer this year, and at $6 for a plate big enough that it satisfied 3 guests on my 2nd visit, a total steal.  On the first visit we tried the Grilled Edamame, and while did enjoy them, and having them grilled is more interesting than you can get at most, it didn't really stand out too much to me.   It IS edamame though, so I'm not sure how high your expectations will be of this to begin with.      \n\nWe got the Ishiyaki \"sear it yourself\" hot rock plate with wagyu beef both visits. On the first visit we liked it so much we ordered it twice.  I'd had this dish once before at Japonais and always had fond memories of that, and found it to be just as delicious if not more so at Yonaka.  They bring out two dipping sauces with it (ponzu and mushroom), and then you grab a piece of thin, uncooked high quality wagyu beef and place it on the hot rock to cook, dip and eat.   One interesting thing to note is as much as I loved the sauces, I actually preferred the meat by itself.  This is why we ordered a 2nd helping the 1st visit, to forego the sauces on the 2nd plate.  I'd also like to point out that against all odds, I have not yet burned myself on the hot rock.   Highly recommended.   \n\nAnother highly recommended, oh hell I'll bump it up to a \"YOU HAVE TO GET THIS\" rating, is the takorizo.   Goodness look at this list of ingredients:  grilled octopus, chorizo, melon, almonds, salsa verde, black olive oil.   Why does this taste good?  Who on earth came up with this?  Is this an episode of Chopped?   My favorite thing about this dish is that you can either get a big boy bite of all the ingredients and the flavors somehow work together to form an incredible mouthful of food, or you can take each individual part of the dish and eat them alone and enjoy the heck out of them.   Each segment is of the highest quality ingredients and have been prepared beautifully (particularly the octopus which I am hit or miss on depending on the preparation at other restaurants).   I haven't even really hit the tip of the iceberg with this menu yet, and I'm sure there are several other menu items that have the same depth and \"Chopped\" style combos that will blow me away...\n\nSuch as the Wagyu Peach off the \"specials\" menu on our 2nd visit.   I'm sure there were other ingredients, but all I needed were the ones in the title.   Beautifully cooked, thick slices of melt in your mouth wagyu along with juicy slices of Georgia peaches.  As I've said about other dishes, whether I ate the beef alone, the peaches alone, or together in a bite, it was pure bliss.\n\nDuring both meals I've been lucky enough to have at Yonaka we were also presented palette cleansers gratis, and both involved fruits with their homemade fish oil.   I must say I wasn't a huge fan of the mixture of fish oil with sweet delicious fruit.   Other members of my party strongly disagreed with me so I chalk it up to personal preference.   I still appreciated the ability to try these free of charge.   And here my mom always told me nothing in life was free.   I'll have to bring her to Yonaka to prove her wrong.  I'm the type of guy who almost always skips dessert, but not here.   This last visit we had the Chokoreto and Ringo Lico and both were phenomenal.  All with various components that (I know I sound like a broken record) taste great individually or separate like candied kumquats and lime ice cream.\n\nI'd be remiss not to mention the prices here as well.   Both times my portion of the bill ran $60 or so after tax and tip.   This is after having several alcoholic beverages, a plethora of food to stuff my face silly and wonderful service in a great atmosphere.   Go for the Norm greeting, stay for the candied kumquats."

So I eagerly went to Yonaka, hoping for a new Japanese dining experience in Vegas.\n\nThe first bad sign was that the restaurant had only about 10 people in it at prime time of 7pm. Not a positive sign. The next was that not one but 2 of the wait staff couldn't even pronounce \"omakase.\" What?\n\nWe ordered the 8 course omakase anyway, despite the pronunciation issues. For some reason, this restaurant loves to combine citrus acid to their fish and it just didn't work for me. Oranges and salmon. Strawberries and scallops. It was just all too bizarre. The flavor combos didn't work for me at all and I felt like the fruits were disguising the lack of freshness of the fish. And their fish was cut way too thick.\n\nThe hot dishes weren't much better. The supposedly wagyu beef was overcooked (there was no red at all in the steak) and the pork belly was chewy.\n\nSometimes, traditional food just shouldn't be messed with and Yonaka is a prime example of that. If you're looking for good Japanese food in Vegas, head over to Raku. Right now."

But there are no friendly shouts and greetings from the sushi bar. Instead, its very quiet and upscale, so the environment actually feels pretty cold. (Minus 1/2 star)\n\nWe decided to sit at the bar because the bar experience is usually pretty great. This time though, no one talked to us. No friendly banter from the sushi chefs, and no complimentary dishes to try. The chefs did not seem very upbeat or happy to be there at all. (Minus 1/2 star)\n\nWe were not very hungry, so we just ordered a few dishes. One of which had to be uni of course! We were blown away by how cheap it was. $5/uni sushi piece? So we ordered two each to try. I forgot to ask where it's from, but it tastes like Santa Barbara. Very good quality, and sweet. But it was so small. Just one small piece of uni on rice. Maybe that's why it was cheap?\n\nI also ordered Ebi. Which... weird.. why is it fully cooked?? Is ebi usually cooked? Because it's never been cooked anywhere else I've been before. I look it up, and its not uncommon to be slightly cooked. But my huge piece of shrimp sitting on rice is fully cooked, cold, and tough to chew. Not good at all. (Minus 1 star - how do you mess up raw sweet shrimp?)\n\nOverall, the food was decent. The Hamachi Kama was very tasty.. But if I had to choose, I probably wouldn't come back here for sushi. \n\n(My favorite is still Soho Sushi!)"

For starters, the Gyu Sliders are slices of beef tongue sandwiched between two layers of rice. Also try the Tea Brined Ribs for a meatier, filling dish.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself! I must note the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Jax greeted us while we waited for our dish and it was a neat conversation. Guess what? All their fish is imported from JAPAN. That explains why the seafood is such amazing quality. We tried the Uni (sea urchin) dish and it was stellar, 100/100.\n\nHowever, I wanted to point out a few things that makes Yonaka juuust slightly short of perfection. Firstly, the waiting time can be pretty darn long. My party of three and maybe another table were the only ones present at the restaurant and it still took nearly 20 minutes for our first appetizer dish. Secondly, as Happy Hour was ending we managed to squeeze in our last order. Unfortunately, by the time it got to the chefs it was literally ONE MINUTE past the Happy Hour time so our orders did not make it in time. Seriously? What a bummer. Usually the servers will go around and announce a last-call for Happy Hour at other restaurants but there was none during our visit. Oh well, not a deal-breaker by any means.\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience."

The timing of the food and how some dishes came out confused me.  First two appetizers came out quickly, then other dishes just came out at the weirdest times and some were cold dishes and some were hot dishes.  I just think most of the dishes flavors were okay, probably the risotto dish was probably one of our favorites.  For example, after getting all our dishes, the hamachi kama came out last.  That was just an odd way to end our meal.  I think the cooks and the sushi chefs need to work better on their timing.  Get appetizers out, then cold items and sushi items, then get hot foods and larger entree meals last.  Overall with 9 people, the bill was around $500, pretty affordable for the amount of people we had and most people were full after the meal.  Our dinner started at 7:30 but we didnt leave almost until 10pm.  I'm glad I tried it but I probably would not come back. I still think hands down Raku is the best Japanese restaurant for tapas style dishes."

The plates each are made with extreme care and concern towards plate presentation, evidenced by the myriad of colors and textures combined into each plate.  Each bite screams umami, in a perfect blend of flavor profiles that tantalize each taste bud.  I tried the brussel sprouts, beet fries, konpa, sake orenji, crudo, karaage, agedashi tofu, gyu sliders, pork ribs with honey and sesame, chokoretto, fresh made sorbets, and ringo lico. Yes, happy hour (5-6:30pm, and 11pm to close) was good to me! Of all the items I ate, the only two I didn't care for as much were the beet fries and the karaage.  All the other items were beyond delicious, my favorite being the crudo and the brussel sprouts.  The dessert is also stellar, with again a unique combination of flavors and textures.\n\nOnto the atmosphere, seems out of place in this little strip mall and reminds me a lot of some old stomping grounds in Belltown, Seattle.  The decor is modern with wood paneling, clean lines and minimalistic furniture, but yet the establishment still gives off a warm vibe. The service was stellar with smiling servers and even a PR person coming around to explain the concept of the food, as well as the proper way to partake of the items to experience the full flavor.  We recently got engaged and they even gave us a free dessert to help us celebrate.  What can I say, I'm in love with this place.  I almost wanted to be selfish and not review this place....so I could keep it to myself.  But the success of this restaurant is inevitable, and I know there will come a time where they will no longer take reservations or have cheap happy hour prices and I will have to wait outside with the rest of the groupies."

I loved the modern decor and feel of the restaurant and given that they were not busy at the time, we got excellent service. So why the three stars you might ask. I just felt like the food didn't quite match the service and decor.\n\nThey serve mostly sushi/sashimi done with a modern twist. They also had a lot of small tapas style items such as karaage (fried chicken) and pork belly buns. Although I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to sushi/sashimi, I wasn't necessarily turned off by the fusion concept. However, judging by the overall experience, I'd say the fusion aspects of it did not work well. It didn't help that we had karaage as the first dish. However, instead of the usual dish you get in Japanese restaurants, theirs come in with jalape\u00f1os and fish sauce. It had a real Vietnamese taste to the fried chicken. While I enjoyed this dish more than my wife, it totally killed by palette for all of the dishes that followed. We also ordered some salmon sushi, unigi, anago, and uni. Their salmon wasn't as fresh as some of the better ones I had before and the eel were just so-so. The presentation of all of their dishes were 5 stars. The dish I liked the most from them was the uni (sea urchin). It was the best dish of the night. Then we had some pork belly in steamed buns. While the dish was tasty, it didn't feel like it complimented the sushi at all.\n\nOverall, I liked what they were trying to do, but unfortunately, it just wasn't my cup of tea. Their overall sushi quality was just average so thus the rating. If you just want to bring someone for great atmosphere and service, and don't care much about the food, this place might be good for you."

            "review": "My buddy and I were hungry at about 9:30 on a Wednesday evening on the west side of town. We both had never been to Yonaka and there was no better time than the present to give it a try. We were seated immediately with one other table of four in the restaurant. With so many interesting items and wanting to get a taste of everything, we decided to to get the eleven course chef's special tasting menu market priced at a very reasonable, in my book, $69/person.\n\nWe were served by Elizabeth, who had a trainee working with her and the trainee was the original person who greeted us and took our drink orders. This trainee was our lone issue. Every course was flavorful with a progression of cold to hot plates. Timing of the delivery of could not have been better including about a five minute intermission to let us catch our breaths before transitioning to the hot dishes. Accompanying each dish was a detailed description of the ingredients and flavors.\n\nThe presentations of each dish are intricate and appetizing. But as always, the final verdict should always be based on flavor. Expect some unique flavors and combinations that will leave you nodding your head after the first bite. Most of my head nodding was followed by \"that's nice\" or \"interesting\" rather than \"wow\" or a bunch of superlatives. My favorite out of the cold dishes was the sake orenji and of the warm dishes, the meat candy. A close second was the duck fat which was some of the richest couple of bites that I've had in a while.\n\nThe trainee, which we didn't know he was until Elizabeth informed us after she took over, put some bait in the water and my buddy and I gobbled it up without even doing a drive by or attempting to sniff it out. Originally wanting to split a $7 large craft of hot sake, we somehow let the trainee talk us into getting a bottle of premium cold sake in which the price was never disclosed to us. We were expecting something of comparable value. When we received the bill, we saw the price tag for the 16 oz bottle was $67. I'm all about up selling and not afraid to pay more to enhance my experience, but to up sell something with a price that's 700% of what you originally wanted is ludicrous and straight up greedy.\n\nNeedless to say, we still take part of the blame for being so trusting in a highly regarded restaurant and should have investigated further. But the experience will not keep me from coming back from trying more of the menu. Yonaka is place that I'm sure will grow on me as I try more of the unique flavors and has potential to be as good as it gets as long as I don't get swindled into buying some overpriced sake."

Everything was delicious, and only one dish, involving a piece of supposedly Australian Wagyu beef that was pretty tough, was a let down."

Traveling around the United States, there are few restaurants that really stand out as my \"death row meals.\"  \n\nFirst, what makes Yonaka great:\nTradition - 3rd generation sushi chef, low reliance on American traditional B.S. (like soy sauce and wasabi), the pacing of the meal as it is in Japan, ingredients.\n\nFlavor Combinations - I could give Yonaka 5 stars just on tradition, and then six stars just on flavor combinations.  They break rules, they stick to rules.  They combine old favorites, they create new must-haves.  If they only had a dollar for every time they heard \"I would never think to put _______ with ________ and then douse it with ________\" \n\nHot plates - Yellowtail collar - exceptional.  Ribs?  How did they get the ribs so perfect?  Barbecue spots must be jealous.  Amazing.  And the Hana Wings - the best wings in Vegas.  I am a Buffalo Bills fan - spent 2 years in upstate NY and will tell you these wings are as good as any in Vegas.  My two other faves are Steiners and Johnny Mac's in Henderson.  \n\nDessert - No, seriously.  Let's be honest here.  No japanese restaurant really offers any worthwhile dessert options unless you love mochi or something super simple.  The elaborate yet playful cookies n milk combination is everything I have ever wished for in a dessert.  \n\nAll in all, you can't beat Yonaka.  Lotus of Siam put Vegas on the map for exquisite Thai cuisine.  Yonaka continues what Raku started - exceptional Japanese food in Vegas.  \n\nNote to management: please raise prices.  Your restaurant is too inexpensive!"

Sushi is sold in singles or in 5's.  Five - kind of an odd number but I guess it feeds 2 with an extra piece to fight over?? \n\nThe amuse bouche was cute but not super impactful.  Cherry tomato and Asian pear, topped with roasted quinoa.  Would probably have been better as a palate cleanser but oh well.\n\nThey attempted to start us out with our dishes, saving sushi for later on.  First up was chicken karaage.  This was probably the ONLY dish we really didn't care for.  We understand the \"modern\" twist on the classic Japanese dish but quite honestly, this was more reminiscent of Orange Chicken.  It was battered chicken stir fried with onions, mint and lots of sugar.  At this point, it's just a whole 'nother dish.  \n\nStandouts for us included the Pokuyaki, the Hotateyaki and one of their specials Uni to Ika (Sea Urchin & Squid).  There were definitely a lot of re-using ingredients - it was obvious one of their favorites was the roasted quinoa.  Not a bad thing but things just started looking very familiar.\n\nSushi was very fresh.  Our favorite was the uni.  Chef recommended that we eat the sushi without soy sauce (none is provided on the table) but when our first order of fish came out, it had stuff on it but virtually no salt.  Everyone at the table (including my mom who is salt-adverse) says there was no salt. I actually think he forgot to put salt on it.  There were no grains visible on top! We had to practically beg for soy sauce.\n\nService was nice but the food could have been a little quicker coming out.  There were long lulls between SOME dishes while others came out at lightning speed.\n\nWe skipped dessert since the selection seemed like an after thought.  Nice place but I think it's gone some work to do.  I really only want to score this a 3.5 but rounded up for their effort and beautiful d\u00e9cor (love the walls)."

As someone who dines out at sushi restaurants often, \"omakase\" usually means a chef's choice of a variety of 12 - 14 pieces of different sushi. Here, it was a plate of sushi sliced from only 3 kinds of fish which makes for a boring, uninventive meal. The fish also lacked flavor. When I questioned their definition of omakase, I was treated rudely by the waiter. I then had to ask for the manager who seemed to blame me for not understanding their unique \"twist\" on \"Modern Japanese cuisine\", which is that they served all their items in a Spanish tapas-style fashion. \nI am also giving a poor rating based on their service.  Of the five items brought to our table, only one of those times was brought out by our waiter who took our order.  Even though there were only two of us in our party, the other wait staff never knew who ordered what and would constantly interrupt our conversation to ask us.  It was not busy that night so I didn't understand why our waiter was not properly taking care of us.  When I provided this feedback to the manager as well, she was defensive.

Beautiful wood accents, simple, and clean.  I liked that the tables had a hideaway for the menus--cool.\n\nService:  Top-notch and attentive.  From the time we arrived to the time we left, the Yonaka staff were so personable.  Ashley and Michael waited on us and we met Jax and Tiffany, who I'm guessing are managers.  Jax came to our table and we name-dropped Christina and Arvin and that did the trick-hah.  Seriously, the staff always checked on us, cleared empty plates often, and refilled our glasses promptly.  Little things like bringing us hot towels at the beginning of the meal to wipe our hands to a couple of complimentary food items were nice touches.\n\nFood:  Delicious and artistic--the presentation of all the dishes was fabulous. \n\nWe started with the Crispy Brussel Sprouts since that was recommended in almost all the previous reviews--who knew they could taste so good?  I loved the sauce and the crispy rice.\n\nMiso soup:  Nice and light, but I could have used a bit more salt.\n\nGrilled edamame:  Never had it grilled before, so it was different to have it warm, but I liked it.  They also had a nice little kick to them with the seasoning used.\n\nSea Scallops on Hot Stone:  A tray of sea scallops was brought to the table along with a hot stone to cook them on.  The scallops kind of stuck to the stone at the beginning, so Chad and Mel just watched me try to finagle the scallops with my chopsticks.  Maybe the stone needs a little oil or something like that.  However, they were still good.  I needed a second stone because the first one got cold (cold stone, get it?) before I could finish cooking all of the scallops--there were quite a few!\n\nShrimp Tempura hand roll:  This dish and the Brussel sprouts were on the happy hour menu.  I've had shrimp tempura rolls lots of times, but this was probably the best I've ever had.  \n\nMel and Chad had some great looking fish dishes, but I cannot comment on those since I can't eat fish, just shellfish.  \n\nOverall, this was a lovely meal in an equally lovely atmosphere.  For a Friday night, it was pretty empty, but hopefully word will get out and others will find out how good it is because a business like this needs to stick around.  Try it; you'll like it."

Such original tastes off traditional dishes! Or so it seems. My experience here was decent. It's a very trendy-style location if you're aiming for new-age Japanese cuisine, but if you're into the old-style dishes, I wouldn't suggest coming here.\n\nWe got there early, at 6PM. We said we had no reservations, and the hostess told us only a bar was available. I'm going to say this now before I forget: My mom and I noticed that for the 2 hours that we were there (and we didn't want to be there for 2 hours, it's just how slow everything is), there were still ample amounts of empty tables. I don't know if it's because my mom and I weren't decked out in jewels and cocktail dresses, but we had the feeling we were being completely discriminated. This isn't fact, this is just how we felt.\n\nI'm not going to blame our server - He was concerned that we were waiting so long for our food, and was the only person that showed genuine concern for our dining experience. There were two sushi masters, yet it only seemed like one was really working hard, and the other, older gentleman, just stood there. No joke. And maybe that's cause he's the owner, who knows. It took us 2 hours to dine, and nearly 25 minutes between dishes. It was just all too long and painful. We would have ordered more but we were tired of wasting our time.\n\nAs for the dishes itself, the brussel sprouts were creative essentially, but they had too much zest. The shishito peppers (and they misspell shishito in their menu, and correct it in the description - pet peeve), were OK, but the homemade bacon wasn't all that grand. I give them kudos for the cookie and strawberry tortilla/salsa thing. That was interesting. Tempura was normal. The sashimi moriawase was pretty good, but I imagine we are paying more for the aesthetics than the freshness, as Naked Fish still blows this place away in terms of freshness. The foie gras sushi was good, and the best part was the LIVE Uni. That stole the show and was the best part of my meal.\n\nWouldn't come back here again."

Small details like caked on food on the sake bottle and descriptions on the plates as they bring them out were a little lacking.  At over 100$ for lunch I expect a little more.  The presentation of the food and quality of the food was definitely good to try again and overcome some of these details."

We thoroughly enjoyed the wagyu beef on cooked on a hot rock as well as their fresh salad, chicken karaage and pork belly dishes. Service is good and very attentive, but perhaps a tad too much. \n\nHowever, if you are looking for traditional Japanese food, this may not be the place for you. It's more a modern, American take of a what high end Japanese izakaya could be. It's an upscale and trendy place with rock music blaring in the background, which to me, lends little to the restaurant's ambiance. At least to me, I go to any restaurant primarily for the food and service, but definitely not the music. For that, I would go to a show or a concert. It may appeal to the younger set; but it would probably not appeal to those within the more mature and upscale market segments (i.e., those who can afford to come here regularly). \n\nTheir menu is somewhat limited. For example, other than sushi, they do not have any rice or starch options. To me, they should be offering onigiris or other types of rice dishes on their menu as is typically served with Japanese cuisine.  \n\nPlus, because it's a brand new restaurant, and not that crowded, the restaurant staff goes overboard in constantly asking you how things are. They even had a marketing manager ask the same question. We understand that management would be very curious over this matter as a brand new establishment; but it's a little too much in my opinion and does not afford patrons with sufficient privacy and space to enjoy their meals in peace. Yonaka marketing manager, hope you are reading this, because if you're not, you're not doing your job well."

If you enjoy food in the slightest, you have an obligation to get here ASAP as it would be a culinary tragedy to lose Yonaka. \n\nAt some \"small plate\" establishments and \"fusion\" restaurants you feel that you are overpaying for a gimmick, which I think is especially true in Vegas, but not here. First, the plates are not small. Everything is generously portioned. Second, you are definitely not overpaying. We had several dishes that we felt would have gone for 3X the price on the Strip. And, lastly, and most importantly: Chef Ramir takes what feels like a gimmick at some places and demonstrates a mastery that puts even big name chefs to shame. With the freshest of ingredients and creativity, he creates beautiful, delicious and fun masterpieces. Did I mention they are delicious?\n\nThere may be 5 ingredients on the plate from dehydrated fruit to an emulsified something or another, but when you put it in your mouth, you just think, \"Damn, this is good.\" You're not left trying to justify that there should be bonus points for technique or art or thinking outside of the box. You just get it because it is delectable.\n\nPeruse my pictures to see the feast that we enjoyed and know that we relished every dish. And, whether you love fish and sushi or fried karaage, there is something you will go gaga for. I would recommend something, but I think that everything is worth trying even if just to see the beautiful plating. \n\nWhich brings me to this: every detail about Yonaka is notable. The interior is fantastic. It should be your first date, date night, impress-the-out-of-towners go to. If you're a tourist, you have to go too. I can't really think of an occasion you wouldn't want to go here for.  \n\nThey also have a sake, beer and wine selection. Plus, a daily happy hour from 5-6:30 and 11-2am includes $3 Asahi draft and plenty of food options, even some food that you can't order during other times, like tongue sliders. So, it's now a late night must as well!\n\nWhat did I say? We may need to lobby for a 6th star."

There's too many new places for me to try since I've been MIA from the dinner world. \n\nWe decided against the omakase.  We've done the whole omakase thing before and just didn't leave full. So we got to order what we wanted and that's how I like it! My favorite dishes: ishiyaki beef (\"Kobe\" beef cooked on a stone...so delish with side salts/sauce for flavor but I didn't need it), the sake oranji (salmon with some oils and tobiko pretty good), baby take and the avocado sushi. \n\nWe had ordered 12 items and had a chefs special the Kudamono given to us for free. The sauce on the Kudamono, jalape\u00f1o based sauce with little crispies was such an awesome delight! Everything else we ordered like the Hotate Kokoro was just over seasoned.  It took away from the scallops in the Hotate Kokoro as it was just too salty. The toro wasn't melt in your mouth fatty goodness and the salmon belly was too fishy for my liking as it had the typical Chinese steamed fish sauce on it. Don't get me wrong I still think this place was a winner but I just scraped off the salt/seasonings and went on to the next item. \n\nService was attentive, but there were only a few diners on a Monday night. Although it took awhile to get the check (a good 15 minutes) and since I'm a tired new mom I was a bit cranky after that as it was wayyyy past my bedtime. We ordered 12 dishes plus one from the chef and I also got a free sorbet for it being my birthday. The total with tip came out to be under 200 bucks which in our case was totally worth it because we were stuffed and got to pick what we really wanted to eat. Yonaka was delish and I hope they continue to do well."

The order that the food came out could also be better - a lot of citrus flavors in the beginning, and a rice dish that finished it up (we ordered the meat candy on the side thinking that we wouldn't get a rice dish). It would've been nice to know what dishes were coming up and if the hostess/server thought about what other things we could've paired our dishes with. \n\nOverall would recommend getting individual dishes and not the omakase.

Dish after dish was just not that good. I'm really sorry. Did someone in the kitchen have a bad day? I don't know but you only get one chance to earn my business and while I would love to make this a go-to spot, it's just not. \n\nThe biggest thing for me as a Yelper is the food and quality. Service is second for me. The food here was overseasoned or drenched with sauces. Everything had TOO MUCH SAUCE! Don't get me wrong. I love sauces, hot sauce, pasta sauce, dipping sauce ... but there is a time and place for that!\n\nThe KARAAGE aka fried chicken was served with a sauce that was not impressive and would have been best served as a side condiment, not drizzled and smothering the fried chicken, which took away from the crunchiness of the meat. \n\nThe WAGYU BEEF SKEWERS and again drenched in sauce with more sauce on the side. I just wanted to taste the meat itself. \n\nThe KAMASHITA AKA FATTY TUNA COLLAR, which was the first thing we ordered on the menu and it never came out. We waited and waited and finally, we thought maybe they forgot so we decided to cancel the order. They go back to the kitchen and bring it out immediately and say that it's already been made, implying that we should eat it. Um, no.\n\nI'm a big UNI person and it was not up to par for me. (The next day I went to Sushi Samba and got my fix there. They serve Catalina Uni and it's ah-mazing)\n\nFOIE GRAS RISOTTO - this was a very heavy dish which didn't blow my mind. \n\nI've dined all over from LA to NY so yes, I am an official food snob. I wouldn't have said that before but after living in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and now Las Vegas, I just expect the best. \n\nSeriously, I can keep going because we all really wanted to like this place so we ordered a variety of plates and sushi. I just left unsatisfied and smelling like burnt butter. Service was fine. Our waiter was great but the food, on my god. No. \n\nWe spent a ton of money here and probably won't return. EVER."

The Tempura dishes are served with a gelatinized dipping sauce and a nice finishing salt to preserve the crispy batter coating on the Tempura while you are eating it. The Ebi Kinoko was a new addition to the menu and has already become a new favorite for me. Yonaka does many dishes uniquely and has become the new standard to which I will gauge all other Japanese restaurants by.  \n\nOn the second trip we ordered a replay of some of our favorites then I pointed at the board with all the special fish and said \"I'll have two of everything on there.\" The Sushi was of the highest quality. Off the top of my head I can remember having the following: Aji, Hobo, Kiara, Kanpachi, Kinmedai, Shima Aji, Tennen Tai, Toro, Sake Toro. We also ordered the Seared Wagyu, Gyutan Beef, Foie Gras and Avocado Nigiri Sushi. Some of the Nigiri was served naked and some were either topped or accompanied with something that both complimented and highlighted the ingredients. The sushi rice is awesome. Each piece was an experience in its own.\n\nI have only tried two deserts, the Sorbets and Chokoretu. The Chokoretu is a brilliant combination of citrus, mint, chocolate and avocado. The Sorbet trio was b far my favorite. Blood Orange, Green Apple and Passion fruit. Each was good on their own, get to mixing them in different combinations for more fun on the tongue. Mix all three together for a fruit punch. I'll be back for the other deserts soon enough.\n\nThe staff at Yonaka is a perfect example of how a restaurant is supposed to be managed. Tiffany and Jax are a pleasure to meet and talk to and always make you feel very welcomed while simultaneously keeping an eye out for every little detail. We have had the pleasure of being served by Michael, Rob and Joe. We were never left wanting for anything. The servers here are so knowledgeable. They can take a jumbled order and bring the food out in a way that makes the whole meal cohesive. Executive Chef Ramir DeCastro and Head Chef Toshi Yoshioka are performing a mix of old world magic and science in that kitchen. Their cooking techniques have so much visual appeal and will enchant your taste receptors.\n\nYonaka Modern Japanese is an exciting dining experience. It truly is as good as it gets."

            "review": "With its excellent service and delicious food, Yonaka is now my favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas. Different from Raku and Yuzu, Yonaka provides Japanese fusion dishes to diners. \n\nWhile most Japanese fusion restaurants like Roka Akor in Chicago provide food on the salty end, Yonaka's dishes are on the sweet end. Fried Brussels Sprouts served in most restaurants tend to be very oily, but those in Yonaka are balanced by the citrus sweetness. It is refreshing that the shishito peppers are not overwhelmed by salt. Diners can opt for purely the peppers or the bunta peppers, which are thick bacon and peppers. \n\nMy friend loved the chef's five-piece sushi sample - the fish was fresh and the sushi rice had good acidity. Although I am normally not a dessert fan, I enjoyed eating the green tea brownie dessert that was complemented with ice cream because it was not overtly sweet. \n\nLast but not least, I am impressed by the service at Yonaka. Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu and the food execution, while our server constantly ensures that our glasses are filled with water. The food was also served extremely efficiently. It would be great if Yonaka can slightly slow down the pace of serving the food to give diners time to clear their palate for the next dish. \n\nAlbeit I normally prefer authentic Japanese restaurants to Japanese fusion restaurants, I rated Yonaka the best Japanese restaurant in Vegas because of its fresh ingredients, great execution of food and amazing service. As much as I enjoy eating in Raku and Yuzu, I am not a fan of the former's service and the latter's occasional subpar quality of ingredients. Yelpers, come to Yonaka!"

My expectations were low but I was extremely pleased with the food and overall experience of this place.\n\nFood: DELICIOUS.  It's Japanese cuisine with a modern twist, exactly like the title infers.  You have your usual raw dishes with something unexpected.\n+Brussel Sprouts: Caramelized and yummy, an excellent appetizer to start with.\n+Edamame: Garlicky and delicious\n+Tuna tataki: Tuna was meaty and well seasoned with soy but not salty.  \n+Scallop: Served on it's shell the presentation was stunning.  It was a delicious bite balanced by the cream sauce.\n+Soft Shell Crab: This was okay.  Fried soft shell crab always tastes about the same to me.  \n+Sake Orenji: Their signature dish, the salmon pairs really well with the orange flavor.  Very delicate and original.\n\nService: The waitress really went into detail on the menu and making recommendations.  Each dish was presented to us with an explanation.  It made it an experience.\n\nDecor: Cool and modern asian.\n\nPrice: Yes it's expensive but you're getting quality food.\n\nOverall Loved IT.  The entire experience was amazing and I can't wait to come back to Vegas to try it again."

I've only been to their 11 pm Happy Hours which doesn't get to busy.  Sit at the bar if it's available or at one of their tables though they both work out good.  \n\nA must have is their Crispy Brussel Sprouts http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=3_WTe2cZ1rDORg9bsAWJgg#3_WTe2cZ1rDORg9bsAWJgg there are better pics but this was mine. So good and so refreshing.  They're brussel sprouts with lemon chili, mint, and puffed rice all charred up together. Didn't really care for the puffed rice but so good.\n\nAnother must have is their Tea Brined Ribs http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=De2lRI4xE353jlYac9aC6Q#De2lRI4xE353jlYac9aC6Q again there's probably better pics.  They're pork ribs in a citrus citrus-honey-tea glaze and sesame.  Sweet and tasty, not your typical BBQish pork rib.\n\nAnother must have is their Karaage  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=De2lRI4xE353jlYac9aC6Q#4SDCYEHrg0maFggCW_1T5g  I didn't take a good pic so I stole one.  They're this fried on the outside and juicy on the inside fried chicken pieces with jalapeno, mint, basil, and onion.  The best way I can describe it all is like fried frog legs but not really.  You bite into them and after you past their fried outsides it feels like it burst opens with it's moist insides. I don't really know how to explain it just try it. Spicy, yet refreshing. \n\nWho am I kidding almost everything is a must have. Here's a few more items I've had with a pic.\nThere's Gyu Sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=8bju5AS8EBNp7o4aO6k9Lw#8bju5AS8EBNp7o4aO6k9Lw \nA Seasonal Sorbet Selection http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=yAxLlRGdxR-3axaQ2Jc7zw#yAxLlRGdxR-3axaQ2Jc7zw \n\nEat everything slowly and in small bites that's how I'd eat it all. Nice interior and excellent service and very friendly staff. They have special daily items. And there's sake.\n\nIf you need a quick phone charge while you eat there's a power outlet next to the tables near the hostess counter.  It's right there so why not use it just don't go setting up shop there."

These were new and exciting flavor profiles. The very best dish we had was on the Special menu. It was called Iroha and was hands down the best thing I have ever tasted in my life. So many textures and flavors! Another great surprise was dessert. Who eats dessert at a sushi joint? Well now I do. We had th Chokotero. Sounded weird but OMG it was amazing!\nGood bye Blue Ribbon.

            "review": "Not quite a 4* but does not deserve 3*.  We went to Yonaka for lunch on the recommendation from a trusted friend. All three of us were starving so we were there just after they opened, 11:10am. Suffice it to say the place was empty. Service was fine and given the hour and lunch time it really didn't detract from our experience but our server was fairly distant until we starting talking sports. But I digress.\n\nWe ordered the fish and chips (not even close to what you'd imagine fish and chips to be), the hand rolls, and the crispy sake (all appetizers), and the burger, ramen and porchetta. All three appetizers were very good while the burger and ramen better than the porchetta. The burger was well cooked with ample onions and bacon. The jalape\u00f1o pesto didn't seem to make an impression and the bun a little to delicate. Over all very good. The ramen was good (not my dish so couldn't really eat too much) with the noodles being the standout, simply outstanding. The broth was decent and the egg delicious. Overall very good. The Porchetta wasn't bad just a bit clunky. The fontina seemed a bit misplaced overpowering the pork.\n\nOne of the ways I determine how good a restaurant is if I say I will return. Yonaka is on the cusp. I'm going to say yes, just not sure how soon."

            "review": "Came to Yonaka on my most recent trip to Vegas.  I actually came twice during the trip.  On my first visit, I was not happy with the food or service at Yonaka.  It was probably a combination of the waiter not directing us anyway in what to order, and the kitchen having an \"off night.\"  When I expressed my disappointment, Chef Ramir contacted me personally and requested that I return to give it another try. \n\nMy wife and I came to give Yonaka one more try due to the great reviews on Yelp.  Chef Ramir guided the menu with a 6 course Omakase.  On our second visit the food was amazing, service was spot on, and the experience was exceptional.  Every dish that we had built on the flavors of the previous and left us satisfied and impressed.  If you are looking for a great meal in Las Vegas and want to get slightly off the strip, go to Yonaka.  This is a restaurant that takes pride in their food and service, and is an asset to the city.  Las Vegas is full of great restaurants, and Yonaka is toward the top of that list.\n\nIf you are in Vegas, get in an Uber or a Lyft (if you don't have a car) and get to Yonaka for a delicious meal.  If you like Japanese food, you will be more satisfied that any overpriced establishment on the strip.\n\nThank you Chef Ramir and team for a fantastic meal.  We will return!"

Sushi is my go to favorite and within that my expectations are simple. I want fresh, quality fish. While decor, service and unique menu items score points in my book, at the end of the day I go out for Japanese food mainly for the fish and am not shy above indulging in massive quantities of sashimi. \n\nPerhaps the modern twist was too much for my palate, or we caught them on a bad day.. The root cause doesn't matter, the bottom line is this is not my kind of Japanese restaurant.\n\nTo the establishments credit, the decor is solid and staff super friend. Seriously 5 - 6 staff members stopped by to ask how we liked our food / the restaurant.  Good try.  There in however lies the double edge sword of customer service. Asking is only the first step. We found the staff friendly, but not knowledgable about the menu nor really sure how to handle it when we weren't so keen on what we ordered.  \n\nIf you're more into hot plates with fried food and pork belly you'll have lots of options.  Clean sashimi and rolls, not so much.\n\nBack to Soho for us."
