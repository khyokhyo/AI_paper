Jump in the hot bath and then the steam sauna. Go upstairs and lay on the hot stones or chill in the cold room. Sit back and relax on the recliner. I even fall asleep there for like an hour. \n\nThis is the best way to unwind after a long flight. I know they have massages there too but the $20 entrance fee is all I need to get me ready to party for the next three days."

            "review": "I used to come here a lot but now I live very far from here, I hadn't been here for 4 - 5 years. Finally after 4-5 years, I came back here today. I was worried about this place reading the recent reviews saying this place went down. Had to check it out because I was missing getting Korean body scrubs. My opinion, this place neither went down nor went up. \nI've been to a couple of Korean spa (NJ and CA) and this place is my least favorite but can't get fussy because I think this is the only place in Vegas I can get authentic Korean scrubs. (Hey, let me know if you know any other place in Vegas ;-)!)\nNot the cleanest. Not relaxing or fancy at all. I would never come here unless I'm getting Korean scrub from Korean lady. I saw a couple of girls wearing swim suits and just enjoying the saunas. If you are embarrassed to get naked in front of people, I would not recommend this place. Go to Qua bath or Bellagio or Wynn. More expensive but I bet you get your money's worth. Unlimited beverages, nice amenities, fresh fruits and etc... \nSomeone said they don't speak English, but everyone spoke perfect English at the front desk. (guys and a girl)\nWhen I was there, there was not a hair dryer. Bring hair brush. Bring your own flip flops to walk around the facility. Bring extra towels if necessary (they only give you one hard bath towel and a face towel.) Low quality shampoo, conditioner and shower gel available. Bring your own facial soap. \nI will be back even though I'm not crazy about this place because there's no better scrub than Korean scrub!!! (My opinion.)"

            "review": "I was looking for a Korean Spa in Las Vegas. The Groupon offers really allowed me to try this place out. It's rather a \"typical\" Korean spa format. \n\nI enjoyed my time here, especially on a Monday around 4p.m. There were few people. I think there could be some room for improvement, as they do not have extra towels available once you get inside the spa. I get that it's probably to cut cost of towel cleaning, but other Korean spas I've gone to have ample towels inside as well. \n\nI'll definitely be back."

Such creativity used in creating the different relaxation rooms and areas, and the entrance fee of $20 just can't be beat! I MIGHT have deducted 1 star because: 1. They really should have more signs letting people know to SHOWER after leaving any steam room, before entering the pools and 2) Some signs telling LOUD people to be quiet- to promote an environment of relaxation. However the price and experience are both so good, I'll leave it at 5 stars. Sublime!"

The herbal steam room is amazing; you can really feel it clearing you out and relaxing your muscles.

I also went and bought a bunch of fun bath scrubs and brought it along this time and I like that better then just plain salt, mine smells better and has oils in it for my skin so that problem is solved also.

            "review": "I go to lots of Korean spas in Orange County and LA. This is the worst Korean spa I've been to. The management is obviously very stingy with spending money on any kind of upkeep. There are signs asking you not to use the towels. There's even a sign asking you to limit how much water you drink. There is an angry sign about a guest that damaged something with how much the repair cost and threatening the other guests with a fine of that amount if caught doing the thing that damaged the equipment. All of these signs didn't add to my relaxation or enjoyment. \n\nThe facility is in very poor condition. Things are broken and aged. I understand it might be expensive to renovate, but I see no excuse for not cleaning. It had that smell of a wet place that isn't kept very clean. There were spots of gray water on the floors in the wet area. \n\nThe price is quite reasonable in terms of price. The pools, steam and sauna were in working order. If you just want to soak a little and shower, and you aren't worried too much about cleanliness, it's probably worth the $20 entrance fee. If you want to really relax and enjoy a clean, pampering environment, I would pay more and go somewhere else. \n\nI didn't visit the coed area so I can't comment on that area."

They don't seem to understand that I would like to use the jacuzzi, hot tub and cold tub but prefer to wear my bathing suit. I always get threatened by the cleaning lady that she is going to tell the management that I am not naked. I tell her that I am not going to expose my ugly body to anyone.

If you don't want a crowd, go there early like when they opens at 8am.\n\nBut I noticed that there are lots of first-timers. and I feel like they need to read this.\n\n[ INSTRUCTION TO A KOREAN SPA ]\n-if you've never been to a Korean spa, you'd be lost what to do, what to wear, where to go. They don't tell you. I saw many first-timers wearing swimsuits or wondering around in the bathrobe in the sauna/bath area. If you are too shy to be naked in front of people, this is not a place for you.\n\n***IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO A KOREAN SPA, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THIS SECTION BELOW***\n\nThings you should bring\n-change of clothes\n-skin care product \n-facial lotion/cream\n-razor (they have it too)\n-tooth brush (they have it too)\n\n When you get there, they'll give you a key, towels(small, medium, large), co-ed clothes.(you should also ask to get slippers at the front desk too.) Then, you go in to the locker room, take your shoes off, change to the sandal. Go to your locker(the number on your key). And this is the part most Americans don't know to do - GET NAKED! You don't take a shower/bath with clothes on at home, right? Same thing here, just take your clothes off. Nobody cares. Take a small or medium size towel(the large towel are to dry yourself after the bath, so save that - I saw some people hide themselves with a large towel to go in to the bath, and later realize that she doesn't have a towel to dry herself). Go into the bathroom. They have a area for shower. Make sure to wash yourself before going into the bath or sauna! They have shampoo/conditioner and soap, but if you are picky bring your own. Once you are done washing, tie your hair and go take a bath or go to sauna.\nOk, you are done with sauna and bath. Now you can get out and change to the cloth they give you to go to the co-ed area. Co-ed area is upstairs, there is a stairs in the locker room. DON'T GO UP WITHOUT CLOTHES! Upstairs is CO-ED area. Co-ed area has cafe, lots of couches, variety of rooms - they have different health properties. People go in there and sleep or just lay for a while. some of the rooms are pretty hot, so don't stay too long. Keep drinking water!\n\nEnjoy!"

It was a $20 entrance fee and they gave me a shirt, pants, towel, and a locker key. The lockers were nice and huge so I really enjoyed that, along with there being a couch and several sinks in the women's room. Another thing that I loved about this place was that if you walked upstairs, there's the coed area. Maybe I need some getting used to but I did not like how you had to be naked in order to go into the hot tub. All of the rooms were amazing. Make sure to wear sandals when entering the Red Clay Room or the Jade Room! I didn't feel as relaxed. My favorite thing about Imperial Health and Spa is that it's Korean based!

Some of the unique  dry saunas include; Jade, red clay coves, Himalayan salt and the bed of rocks or red clay balls to lay on. I found that if you alternate between the hot dry saunas then use the ice room back and forth is a much more enjoyable experience. The spa provides  free Wi-Fi codes and outlet so you can use your electrons or listen to your music while you meditate. \n\nDownstairs is a separate spa area for the men and women.

After reading the reviews on this site, she picked this particular spa. \n\nI swear it was a religious experience.  We went into the jacuzzi first to loosen up and my little sweet faced masseur came in to get me.  She was wearing her 'uniform' of a bra and underwear.  Yep...either time to run or time to take the dive!  Now, if you are modest, this is not for you.  Usually I am, but I was warned before we went that if you don't want to get naked, don't go at all....but I decided to surrender to the experience.  Great decision.\n\nFirst, I was taken into the room where my sweet little Jenny rubbed delicious smelling sugar all over my body.  Okay....98% of my body.  Again, you have to surrender to the experience.  lol.  Then, she put me in the sauna for about 10 minutes.  I was joined there by my 2 girlfriends where we sat there, in the buff, with melting sugar all over us.  Talk about bonding!  lol.  She took me back to the shower and washed my whole body.  We headed back into the room where she put some kind of volcanic ash or seaweed or something...and wrapped me in plastic and left me in the quiet for about 40 minutes.  Next, after I took another rinse, I went back to her table again where she gave me the best massage of my life, then a cold fresh cucumber facial....the cucumber was freshly smashed by her at some point...and it was ice cold.  Oh my gosh AMAZING.  And finally, after putting amazing lotion all over my body, she removed the face mask and WASHED MY HAIR.    \n\nAfter this amazing experience, we proceed upstairs to the clay rooms.  One room had these awesome balls of hot clay that you lay in and just relax.  \n\nThe spa portion of our visit was about 2 hours.  We were there for about 4 and a half hours total and when we left, we could barely talk.  It was a great bonding experience.  And when it was all over, I hugged my little Jenny and told her I wanted to come back over and over again.\n\nI was also excited to find out they had a location here in Fullerton, California!  So now I can go to the spa whenever I want to.  I will never go to Burke Williams ever again.  \n\nAAAAhhhhhhhhh...heaven.  Highly recommended!!!  I am telling everyone about this experience and trying to take as many other friends as I can!  :)"

            "review": "It is ALL about the Aromatherapy Scrub & Massage at Imperial Health Spa. But brace yourself, bitches. There's no gentle, relaxing touch involved so if that's your thing, don't even bother reading any more of my review. The hearts and rainbows and jumping unicorns and rose petals are just not the type of things that transpire over at the Korean Spa. So if you're a bad ass like me and you're from the school that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, do feel free to read on... \n\nThey will scrub you within an inch of your life and elbow the shit out of knots in your back but it's sooo worth it! No pain no gain baby! Brunhilda from Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure has nothing on the chicks that work here! If you don't get that reference, don't feel bad. It's just some obscure, cheesy movie that I happen to have acted in so I wouldn't expect you to have any idea what I'm talking about. And if you do get it... I'm impressed! Extra cool points in my book for you!\n\nCome earlier than your appointment time. Like half an hour early minimum. They want you to be human soup with the rest of the nudists that enjoy the facilities here pre-scrub/massage. Oh and jump into that steam room for a few too if you can handle it. I can't take it too long though. I get wayyy too hot! *insert cute boys sending me compliments like \"Yeah, that's right, you ARE way too hot!\" here*\n\nMy suggestion is to come here before an airbrush tanning session. Get all that dead skin off your body and then head over to see Terry over at Bronzed. But actually the ideal thing is to do this the day or two before because they put a bunch of hardcore moisturizer/oil on you which is not good to have on your skin before an airbrush tanning session because it will make it so the tanner doesn't stick and defeat the whole purpose of your doing the scrub in the first place.\n\nThey do just about everything that can be done to pamper you here during this treatment. And there are two different options. One's $125 and the other is $150. Only difference between the two is that the massage is a little longer longer. The Aromatherapy Scrub and Massage appointment goes as follows:\n\nYour scrubber/massage lady comes and finds you in the steam room or jacuzzi. You go back with her and get completely nude. She scrubs the hell out of you as you contemplate your escape route and/or start thinking of a way you can start climbing the ceiling. She shows you all the nasty skin she has taken off of you and you're like, \"Wow! I guess I definitely needed this! I swear I don't live in a cardboard box under a freeway overpass!\" Then she washes you with this pineapple smelling soap and one of those poof things. This is one of my favorite parts of the treatment because the scent is very intense and smells amazing! After that they wash your hair for you and condition it while giving you a bit of a head massage. Then they seat you up and give you some soap for your face and have you go get in the shower while they clean up all your dead skin off the table so everything is nice and clean for the massage portion that is coming up next. After your shower, they hand you a towel and have you lay down on the table face down. Then they dry you off some more and begin the massage. After that they flip you over and massage a little more, then put a mask on your face. While the mask is drying, they massage your neck and shoulders. Then they peel the mask off and that's the end of your aromatherapy scrub and massage treatment. \n\nAll in all it is a great experience that I recommend and partake in often. So if you see me running around naked 'round these parts, don't be surprised. And sorry dudes... it's not co-ed in the naked area although the men do have their own birthday suit section at this spa. No clue what goes on back there so you're on your own there, buddy. To all the ladies out there... Maybe say hi or something if you see me... Or not. Cuz that like might be awkward since we're like naked and stuff. I dunno... I'm pretty easygoing so if you don't mind, I won't. Your call either way, fellow yelpers. \n\nAll I know is this... You will leave here glowing and looking fantastic, feeling like a new woman! This place is the bomb diggity and the sheer number of checkins I have listed above should speak volumes about how much I love this place!"

Wet areas downstairs have jacuzzi, sauna and steam with a cold plunge to relax.\n\nUpstairs area is coed requiring you to wear their outfit which was quite comfy.  Favorites upstairs were the clay ball room which I had never seen and I have been to spas all over the country.  Fridge room  was also a first for me but refreshing after heated areas.  \n\nA few tips:  you only get one large towel when you check in so save that for your finishing shower. All the towels provided in the wet areas are too small to dry you off.  \n\nIf you are uncomfortable with nudity, this spa is not for you.  There are no private shower stalls or private dressing rooms.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and relaxed but not much service; they basically hand you your stuff and point you to the door so go explore a genuine Korean style spa!!"

We used a living social coupon for the place and I dare say we'll do it again.  \n\nOnce you check-in and pay there are 2 different locker rooms, male and female.  Connected to those locker rooms are showers, hot and cold jacuzzi pools, steam saunas, and salt saunas (my wife said the women's side had an herbal sauna; I didn't find one in the men's).  \n\nThe second level has 3 different heat sauna rooms: clay ball room, adobe clay room, jade and eucalyptus room, and an ice room. There is also a yoga room and a little restaurant. You could probably spend all day going in and out of the rooms.  They also offer massages, for a fee.  We didn't get the couples massage 'cause we're cheap, but everything else is amazing.  \n\nAll the patrons there were very nice and talkative, as were the workers.  If you need a day to relax and sweat out all the toxins, this is your place.  I plan on going back again and again.  I would have given 5 stars but the messages were pretty pricey.  Other than that great experience."

I came here on a random Thursday morning, and it wasn't busy at all. They have a bunch of sauna rooms. Some of the saunas are designed so that you can take a 10 minute nap and not feel overwhelmed with the heat. I also like that this place has a \"chill\" room to cool off after coming out of a sauna or a steam room. \n\nI loved that they also served food there. I had their KRN beef ribs, and it tasted BOMB! Totally worth it. My friend and I stayed there for 6 hours, the longest we've ever stayed at a spa before. Granted, we did take a 2 hour nap in their nap room. My friend slept in the \"yoga room\" \n\nI paid $10 on a groupon deal that allows me the use their facilities all day long. Worth every penny, and THEN some. If you were to go to ceasers palace for their facilities it would cost $40 bucks for the day pass (still worth it though). If you're in Vegas and trying to recover from a hang-over, check this place out, it'll do wonders."

So it's not like gym intimidation where you think people are constantly comparing body types. You also get towels, so if you want, you can cover up between rooms. If you do go to the second floor, you have to put on whatever they give you at the lobby. \n\nOnly thing - i didn't have slippers so I had to walk on the sides of my feet in some rooms 'cause the floors were just way too hot.

Drinking most nights has made me realize that alcohol is not my friend and I came here with a friend to detox. \n\nFor $20 daytime or $30 nighttime, you get full access to the general facility. It is extra for services such as a scrub, massage, facial, wrap, or food. They have package deals that put the Strip to shame. \n\nCame in on a Thursday afternoon and had the whole bath area to myself. I showered, sat in the warm bath, switched to the cold bath, jumped in the herbal sauna, moved over to the dry salt steam room, scrubbed down with salt, lounged around the salt sauna with said salt still on me, watched it all melt away as I sweated out the toxins, washed off, shave, and the only person I had around me was the attendant. It was amazing. I could couldn't care less if people were around me, but if you are worried about it being crowded then a weekday afternoon might be best for you.\n\nAn hour and a half later, I was ready to go upstairs to meet my friend. We had lunch in the lunchroom. Prices are close to some restaurants outside. The ddeokpokki and udong are ok. The kimbap was my favorite. They were large filled with veggies, ham, and egg. \n\nIn the communal area, there are recliners, tvs, a fitness room, clay ball room, jade clay room, salt room, and a cold room. Remember to stay hydrated throughout the day. Laying around the various rooms for four hours I must have guzzled a gallon of water and felt like a new man. \n\nThe best part is that after all of that, I showered and repeated the bathing process again."

All I can say is that I think I'd like to move in, or at least move to a town that has one of these available. I was a little nervous being a newbie and not entirely sure what to expect. Once I got over the initial weirdness of being in my birthday suit around strangers, which took about 2 seconds since everyone was so nonchalant about it, I just gave myself over to the experience of being relaxed and pampered beyond what I knew was possible. I spent about an hour bouncing between soaking pools of different temperatures and steam rooms with different properties (herb, salt, etc.) then had the 70 minute scrub and massage ($120). Again, a weird, but fully pleasurable and relaxing experience. Then I headed up to the co-ed section and enjoyed the red ball clay room. Everything was sparkling clean, professional, and I can't think of a single negative thing to say except that I should have stayed longer. And I could have if I wanted to. I bought a groupon for the use of the spa but found out it was included in the price of my treatments so I'll definitely go back and enjoy the tubs, steam rooms, and other amenities for about the cost of a movie ticket."

You're also issued a key for a locker to hold your personal belongings. They provide you with a quick run down of the facility and let you have at it. If you want a separate service, such as a massage, it's a separate price but they seemed to be reasonably priced.\n\nThe locker room and changing areas are your first stop through the entry doors.

We were interested in the facilities and seeing what amenities they had to offer.\n\nFirst impression, bright open entrance with hardly any smiles from the workers.  They offered us these super over-sized shirts and shorts that fits sumo sized.  They are very unattractive, but it did the cover up job.  I was handed a towel with this disgusting yellow stain that seemed like it could wash off, but it didn't look washed.  This didn't instill confidence within me about this facility.  \n\nThere was a quick explanation of the facilities and off we went.  No tour, just reading signs, using common sense and wandering about the entire facility.  It was pretty empty for being the weekend.  \n\nHere's the entire facility breakdown:\n\nThere's 2 common lounge areas to watch TV, sleep or read on over-sized lazy boy type chairs.  \n\nThe clay room is like little igloos that you crawl into and lay in there.  It's just a hot sauna with red lighting and I can't tell if there's any benefits to lying there with the clay.  \n\nThe clay ball room is individual squared off spaces that is filled with what feels like marbles.  You have to really gently lay yourself onto it, because it's pretty painful getting out when trying to stand on marbles.  You just do a swim motion like you're at Chuck-e-Cheese and let the clay balls just warm you entire body.  Again, another hot sauna room.  Bare in mind, you can't last more than 10 minutes per room, per recommendations of the facility, because it's so deathly hot.\n\nThe chill room is literally just the chill room.  The U shape tile that allots about 7 women to sit in there comfortably and we switch from a hot treatment and back to the cool room each time to reset and cool down.  Nothing special, just a chilled room with mood lighting.  \n\nThe treatment rooms seem like they were all just in a big room, but separated by shoji screens.  The prices seemed reasonable, but if the facility wasn't attractive, I can't see how the treatments would have been any better.  \n\nThen back downstairs is when the nakedness happens.  There's a sauna room, empty big room with floor mats to lie on and zen out.  The water features were a salt water pool, a cool plunge that wasn't working, a jacuzzi, 2 different steam rooms featuring herbal scents (by far my favorite), sit down showers, stand up showers that had the essentials and that was pretty much it.  I was not impressed with the water features.  The mixture of hot and muggy was a turn off and there was a smell the lingered.  We spent but most of our time showering off in there and back to the lockers.  \n\nThey had teeny tiny cups for water refills, but thank goodness the offered water.  There was the bare essentials like blow dryer, brush and maybe some cotton swabs.  I didn't find the place too pleasant, so the consensus was leave as soon as possible.  \n\nThere was a dining area and the food was over priced, but at least they offered food.  We didn't eat there, so I can't comment.\n\nNext time, heading to the strip for a spa day is probably going to be the best bet."

But there is one problem here Towels... they give you a towel when you check in and by the time you are trying to take your final shower and get out that towel is useless because that's the towel you use to wrap around you and sit in a steam rooms and dry sauna and at the end you definitely don't want to use that towel to dry yourself out after your final shower , they have a spot for clean small towels where you can get some but last two times I wasn't able to get any because there where none , when I asked the guy for more towels he said that they are washing them and need to wait 30 minutes , I mean common this is a spa you can't run out of towels... I would give this place a 5 stars if no towel issue , hopefully someone will see this review and will fix this issue. But in other hand if you want to visit this place get your own towel just in case"

If you are wanting the whole sensory experience with the glowing candles, scented aroma therapy, cozy linens on top of the massage tables and other things that lure you into spas then you will be disappointed. \n\nBUT, if you want a fabulous artisan massage by a strong Korean woman that will find that knot in your shoulder or back and make you limp like a wet noodle, THIS IS THE PLACE and ask for Emily. Apparently Korean Massage School is fine tuned compared to the message therapists I've received on the strip. No leaf is left unturned, from your scalp to your toes. \n\nIf you are easily offended by exposing your naked butt, go else where. You are naked on your tummy, they cover your private area but she scoots down the cloth to work the sciatica on the butt cheeks. Boobs get massaged too, you are covered by a light gauze cloth.. \n\nI grew up in Japan until I was 18 and the Japanese Onsen is a way of living, nobody cares what you look like naked anyway. You have to go in with a mind set that these massages are not intended to be sleazy or inappropriate as seen by westerner. They are truly committed in providing excellent massage experience. So, if she moves your leg in a particular position and it exposes you a bit, don't have a \"OMG, COW\".  Nothing was intended inappropriately. \n\nThe water area is swimsuit optional. Only saw 1 Caucasian woman wearing a bikini everyone else, NOT. They treat the locals right, with a discount of $5 off a massage and if you only want to use their facilities $18 for as long as y ou want to stay. The $18 is waived with a service purchase.\n\nAll the positive remarks about cleanliness on the reviews are all true!\n\nTrying the massage and scrub next time, recommended by Emily."

I paid upon entry and was given the standard shorts/shirt to change into. My massage therapist was prompt and picked me up at the exact time for which I was scheduled. \n\nI stripped naked and she placed a sheet over me and worked on a full body massage over the sheet. Half way through she repeated the same massage with lotion and regular contact. The massage was great... Jenny made sure to check in and find out if the pressure was too hard. She seemed to really focus on my tight back spots and I felt better afterward.\n\nFollowing my massage, I enjoyed the hot salt room adjoined to the ladies locker room, the women's jacuzzi, and even the wet salt room... Which was... Breathtaking. Literally, I don't think I stayed in there five minutes... Breathing was a little too challenging!\n\nAfterward, I showered and surprisingly found the shower and supplied shampoo/conditioner to be quite good! I have thick hair and am always nervous about getting a good conditioner, but this one did the trick and got the knots out. \n\nI checked out the upstairs clay ball room but did not go in (next time). I was disappointed to find there wasn't anyone manning the restaurant upstairs as I might have indulged in a late night dinner...\n\nThe overall experience was good... $90 for a 60 min massage. I booked and was able to get in on the same day and two days later my back pain has substantially subsided. \n\nI was freaked out when I entered... Sketchy dude on his bike asked if he could come in and join me... But knowing this Vegas neighborhood isn't the greatest... I just think that's par for the course.\n\nThe spa was clean but not quiet and serene as others I have been to (MHotel, Venetian, and Green Valley Ranch). I could hear people outside during my massage and while in the hot salt room. And there were TVs playing odd channels in the lady's locker room... A bit distracting from an otherwise serene experience. \n\nStill, it was convenient and had the essentials so I would go back."

            "review": "Some basics:\n\nFirst off, the lower floor, where the showers, locker rooms, and Jacuzzis are located, is an all-nude area. No biggie; everyone is of the same sex, everyone is minding their own business, and it's not awkward until you make it awkward. Don't make it awkward. \nTowels, shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel are provided. There are also cotton swabs and hair gel in the public bathroom area.\n\nI highly recommend asking for slippers at the front desk or bringing your own, because the floors in the sauna rooms are HOT. Also make sure to stay hydrated. You're gonna be sweating after all. \n\nAs for my experience:\nThis is the first Korean spa I have been to, but I have been to spas in Germany, so I do know what a good wellness experience looks like. \n\nI am a little confused that there are a lot of reviews about the friendly customer service and the helpful staff. Maybe they were on break when I walked in, because neither of the two ladies at the front desk were smiling or even talking to me. They silently took my phone to redeem my groupon deal and laid my spa outfit and locker key on the table for me and my friend. They then proceeded to look at us as if to say, \"What are you still doing here? Be your way.\" It was only when I told them it was our first time here and whether there was anything specific rules or guidelines we should be looking out for, that one of the ladies finally gave us a very brief summary along the lines of, \"Women on this side, men on this side, you can meet upstairs.\" Welp, alright then. Thanks. And yes, I have considered the fact that this behavior might have been because of a language barrier. And no, it is not. I have experienced perfect customer service abroad and in the US where people spoke a different language from their customers. I don't expect perfect English. Just friendly service. \n\nThat said, the spa rooms upstairs aren't bad. My favorite is the clay ball room. You basically just lie down in a bed of marbles and immerse yourself in a pleasant heat for around ten minutes. If you have lain down on a sun-warmed rock before, you know how enjoyable that is. \nThe ice room wasn't as cold as I expected, but it's a nice place to hang out at after sweating in one of the other rooms. There is also a food area. The platters are a bit on the expensive side, as to be expected at a spa. \n\nOverall, the Imperial Health Spa is a good deal with the Groupon (it's $24 for a two-person day pass), but it's not really anything to write home about. The service brought the experience down by quite a bit for me. Since I have not had any massages or treatments, I cannot speak for those."

The price is a lot more reasonable then some of the fancy casinos and a great place to hang out with friends of both sexes as there is a common spa area.  The place was clean and lots of options in the gender specific wet rooms like standing shower area, sitting cleaning area, warm pool, hot pool, cold pool, sauna, herbal sauna.  This was just in the wet area.  Then getting comfy clothes to join our guys in the common area for relaxation in the various rooms like cold room, red clay balls, etc...  In other Korean spas, I could see Jade or amethyst or salt in the walls.  At this spa, all the surface were smooth so I assume the tiles were Jade or Salt...  The floor was hot so I wished I had brought some flip flops/slippers.  There was Korean food that I wish I had time to sample as that is my favorite cuisine.  Very relaxing place with friendly regulars that we could ask questions.  There wasn't a big presence of people working there so I had to get dressed and go to the front desk to ask any questions.  I opted for a thai massage but it was more like ashiatsu with massage bars that she held onto and walked on me.  Normally I love that style of massage but I was sore from hikes in Sedona and the cramped car ride to Vegas and she ended up hurting me.  She said I should have gotten deep tissue instead and she switched to that but I really didn't want oil and just wanted pressure and stretching.  My arm still hurts from her weight.  I hope it heals quickly.  I would definitely go back for the amenities and opt for a different massage therapist or not so sore and tight when I go back."

I've been to 3 other spas in town and this one is very different in the fact that everything is open including showering area and there are less hallways and secluded areas, especially for the male portion which may be how Korean spas are and I didn't have an issue with it. I did have an issue with everything being extremely HOT- the sauna was hot, the dry sauna benches were hot, the Jacuzzi was boiling,and  the infrared catacombs were baking me. It wasn't enjoyable to the say the least, but glad I at least got to finally check it out. \n\nThe customer service was top notch and the ladies at the front were very friendly. The place is very clean and I felt like they used too much space for the dressing and lounging area and not enough for the actual spa amenities itself. The prices for massages are kinda high for being off the Strip and serving mainly locals. The sauna was incredibly small and uncomfortable due to high heat. They had two saunas on the male side but the other one was not working and the dry sauna was empty. The upstairs area has more fun having mostly clay type rooms to enjoy yourself. Like I said they were all HOT areas, but I tried each one out until my body was baked. It was a 2 hour experience for me and Ill stick to the Strip spas.\n\nLastly, the mens portion has this cruise-y vibe to it, as if all the guys are trying to get each other off. It was exhausting trying to avoid eye contact with them.I did manage to catch two guys in the act and like I said it's not the right place for anything of that nature considering everything is open space and huge windows are on EVERY room. If you're looking for a better spa to cruise for men or women go two blocks down to Hawks, Entourage or the Green Door."

We have been wanting to try a Korean spa ever since seeing one featured on a late night talk show.\n\nThis place did not disappoint! I have been to many spas, and he has been to a few as well. When you get there, they give you a shirt, shorts, towel(s), and locker key. Then you go to your respective locker room. You may be barefoot or wear slippers throughout the facility - no street shoes.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed all of the co-ed sauna rooms upstairs. Our favorite was the room with the red clay balls. So warm and comfy! The pits closer to the back wall were warmer, and they also had a different type of stone. Very relaxing and romantic! The ice room afterwards was excellent - and not nearly as cold as I was expecting. It was a perfect way to cool down after being in the hot sauna.\n\nThen he booked us a couples massage. They had full availability, so we didn't have to wait. The room was nice. It wasn't as fancy as an upscale spa, but definitely better than average. The price was reasonable as well. \n\nI can't remember the name of his massage therapist. He said it was a good massage but maybe not his favorite. I had a lovely therapist named Angela. She gave me one of the best massages I've ever had, plus she happened to do some energy work on me (Reiki). I've never had that done, but I've always wanted to try. I got lucky! I was in a ridiculously good mood afterwards, no doubt in part because of her good vibes. I will be seeing her again!!\n\nAfter the massage, we returned to our respective areas. He tried out the wet areas, but I chickened out! Perhaps I will next time. You are not allowed to wear clothes in the water. I think clothing is optional downstairs (not co-ed), including the dry salt sauna. Clothing is required upstairs in the co-ed areas, of course.\n\nOverall, this was a wonderful way to spend a few hours (even longer). We will be back!!"

I don't think so, but I'll start at the beginning, because this one's a doozy.\n\nSo, my best friend wanted to play 25 cent (you read that right) Roulette. We asked around and eventually, we were led to downtown Vegas at 3am to a place I like to call, \"The Gates of Hell,\" also known as The El Cortez, ya know, either or. So here we are at El Cortez and...yeah. It was every Tarantino movie come to life. It was like the inside of the brain of every Elmore Leonard character. It was, in a word, dreadful. After about 15 minutes of repeated admonitions to my stupid friend not to \"touch anything or anyone,\" we made our way through the smoke and found ourselves outside on a dark, dirty downtown street. My friend looked like he'd had 20 years shaved off his life. I took one look at him and said, \"We need to save our souls.\" And this, my yelp friends, is how we came to find ourselves at Imperial Health Spa.\n\nWe got back to our hotel and I immediately started searching online in the hope that there was a Korean spa in Las Vegas because I knew, in my heart of hearts, that our spirits needed cleansing, and only a Korean spa (or a Holy water dunk tank) could do it.\n\n Lo! There it was. I tucked my friend into bed and we made our way there in the morning. I've been to several Korean spas in L.A. and in Washington state, so I know the deal, but if you don't, here it is: YOU'LL BE NAKED THE ENTIRE TIME. The only clothed areas are the check-in desk, co-ed infrared rooms, yoga room, and the lunch counter. Come to think of it, that's kind of a lot. But if you want the real deal fun, you'll be in the women only or men only section, enjoying your wet blessedness. You'll be in one of the hot pools or the steam room or the sauna. Do one or do them all, your choice. I like to make my way through the pools then cook myself in the steam, then stumble into the sauna, then back into the pools. But that's me, you do you. \n\nI joined my friend for a smoothie at the counter and he was having a ball in the guys' section. From what he told me, it's the same set up as the ladies' section (but you know we ladies have more fun). Anyway, we downed our fresh fruit smoothies (delicious, btw) and headed to the yoga room. We blissed out in there for a while to the soothing sounds of the on-a-loop yoga video, then went into all the infrared rooms, my favorite part. I was daydreaming in the little red, clay balls when I heard my friend snoring SO LOUDLY in the box next to me, he could have woken the dead. Since we were alone, I let him have at it. It was the sleep of ages. He was having a good time.\n\nIn the end, our souls were saved (yay!) and our bodies were cleansed of the debauchery and stupidity of youth. So, to sum up this novel, go here. You'll love it. Or you won't, but then I'm pretty sure that means there's something wrong with you. :)"

I've been to spa castle in new york, and comparing it to that is somewhat unfair. \n\non to the actual review... the counter girls are somewhat friendly if you come at the right time. They need to change the pamphlet because it is misleading saying that they have an ICE ROOM, but at which they do not.  The times that i have been there it wasn't busy at all which was sort of disappointing. The big plus they have for me is there theater room...they have a good selection of films to view, but i wonder if you can bring your own.  The food is one of the greater points of the spa. Cheap as far as Korean food does go, and worth every bit of it. \n\nat the very most i would return just to relieve some tension from what ever is stressing me. and i could recommend this spa because its cheap for the service they do provide."

It's located on Sahara and Maryland in the same plaza as Rainbow's End grocery store. \n\nI must admit the facility is a bit outdated but it is still a real treat to go to detox and relax. And the owners do a great job maintaining this spa so it's very clean. First floor is where the locker rooms , showers , hot tubs , and saunas are all located. They provide towels as well as shampoo , conditioner and shower gel. Not the greatest quality products so bring your own if you're picky. Hairdryers and disposable razors & tooth brushes are also provided. They have three different saunas - steam sea salt , herbal , and dry salt room. My favorite would be the herbal one. I highly recommend bringing your own flip flops because some of the floors can get really hot. They used to provide flip flops for free but now you have to pay to rent a pair.\n\nAlso , keep in mind that the first floor is separated by sex and have to be all-nude to go in the hot tubs and saunas. If you aren't comfortable with that , I recommend going to Qua bath at Caesar's Palace or any of the other spas on the strip or resort casinos.\n\nThe second floor is co-ed so be sure to put on your lounge wear on before heading up there. They have a lounge area with resting chairs and TVs playing Korean cooking shows or news lol. There's also a cafe/restaurant that serves pretty good soondubu (spicy soft tofu soup). It comes with banchan (multiple side dishes like kimchi). The prices are steep though - typical spa prices. I normally just get their hard-boiled eggs (1$ each) and their Sikhye (sweet Korean rice cold drink).\n\nAll day pass is very affordable - Groupon deals range from ~12-15$ for one ! Definitely worth a visit. I always bring my cousins here whenever they visit in town. I have not had any of the massages or treatments they offer (since it costs $$$) so I cannot review on those."

Professional and just the right amount of pressure. This place is less expensive than the spas on the strip regarding entrance fee ($20) or services. If you have a Groupon the entrance fee is ($12). The staff is courteous and helpful, there can be a language barrier depending on how educated and open to other cultures a customer is. If you go in there with an attitude, and put negative energy out into the universe, expect the same back. Just saying, so don't be dickish. I'm wanting to try a body scrub but I'm afraid. I hear from other patrons that it's a Korean style scrub and you will be scrubbed to the bone. My threshold for pain is low.\n\nI could not give this place 5 stars because the downside of things are as follows. \n- maintenance is lacking. Missing ceiling panels in men's wet area and puddles of water during busy times. \n- lounge chairs need to be replaced. Sorry, I'm used to the finer things in life, and if the lounge chair screws are not working, how do you expect me to adjust it accordingly to my comfort level? It's not that expensive to replace...again, just saying.\n- speaking of stuff to replace, the salt room floor mats REALLY needs replacing. They are tatted and very worn. And if that ever happens, can management lay down more than 3 mats?! There is a lot of floor space, and the mats are all in one corner. I'm comfortable naked, but I don't need to be that close to another naked man. \n- restaurant prices. Good lord the prices went up recently. It was already expensive to begin with, but now no matter how good the food is, it's a bit much. What used to be an $18 Kalbi Rib is now $25. The ice cream fruit cup (which is HUGE btw) was $9 is now $15. \n- the Jade hot room in the coed section, where is the jade? It is not the tiles on the walls because it is the same tiles on the floor.\n\nNow for the good. \n- clean. The staff works hard at keeping the place clean. \n- the various rooms like the salt room, the red clay ball sauna, the hot hut room to sweat out whatever you want to eliminate through your pores. All rooms have different purposes regarding health and effects on the body. \n- the food at the restaurant is good. Most plates come with lots of side dishes.\nRelaxing atmosphere. You can nap almost anywhere. Lots of beds and recliner chairs to do so. Large TVs to watch a game while getting your spa on. \n\nWhen you enter your respected area, M or F, please follow the rules. There are signs everywhere. In today's world, illiteracy is rare and reading simple sentences is achievable. Remove your shoes and put them in the locker area. Take a shower before entering any steam room, jacuzzi or sauna. This is a place of health and cleanliness. Leave your body odor at the showers. Lastly, people here are nekkid. Nude is an understatement. Leave your inhibitions at the door. Other than that, have fun."

They give you a key, you drop your shoes off in the locker and head onto another locker area where you strip down and put all your stuff in. \n\nThe 3 pool in the woman sauna was hot, warm, and cold. I was disappointed that the pool, it was small (fit maybe at most 6 people) and it didn't look like it was filtering much. Again, not complaining because there wasn't a lot of people.\n\nThe woman floor had a wet sauna, salt sauna, herb sauna, a dry salt sauna, and a sleeping area near the locker. They provide razor, toothbrush, tooth paste, 2 shared hair brush (cleaned in a UV toaster machine), 1 blow drier to share, lotion, hair spray, q-tips, and they have shampoo, condition, and body wash (that smells really good btw)\n\nWhen you get upstairs, it offers less--- a red domn room, a red bead room, ice room, salt room, fitness machine, 2 tv room, 1 cafe room, 1 room to do Yoga?, and that was it. Some room' floors are HOT, so remember to ask for slipper at the front desk where you paid.\n\nFood there was expensive. I ordered the beef noodle and there was only 2 shredded meat in the bowl. It didn't taste that good either. $12.81 --- I suggest eating before you come or bring your own food and sneak it inside.\n\nGreat deal only if you buy deals online."

            "review": "I loved King Spa in Dallas, and was excited to hear there was a Korean spa in Las Vegas! I had never tried a body scrub, and decided to go for a package deal that included a body scrub, deep tissue massage, and reflexology.  \n\nI checked in about an hour before the appointment, but was asked if I could move up my appointment 30 minutes. I was fine with that, but since you have to soak in the hot tubs for around 15 minutes before your appointment starts, most of my time after putting everything in my locker was spent in the hot tub before my appointment. Why does this matter? Well, they give you a nice shampoo and conditioner in your hair during your spa treatment, so I didn't want to try the steam rooms after my appointment since my hair would need to be washed again from getting steamed and sweated over. I still was able to enjoy the facilities, but thinking about it now, I would have liked extra time to relax more before the appointment.\n\nFor those that are new to Korean spas, in most of them, you will be enjoying the facilities in your birthday suit in the gender-specific areas. There are co-ed areas, usually different saunas, that you will be wearing the pajama-like clothes they give you at check-in. At Imperial Spa, they've modified it a bit so that you can wear a bathing suit to the gender-specific areas except the hot tubs. When I went on a Friday late afternoon, it wasn't too crowded, and everyone in the women's area was either in their pajama outfit to go to the co-ed room, or naked.\n\nOn to the spa treatment. For those that like more \"relaxation\" time massages and scrubs, this isn't it! The scrub was very scratchy feeling, and a little painful. It felt kind of like someone was scrubbing me with a brillo pad. Almost every surface of your body will be scrubbed, rinsed, then scrubbed again. The hair treatment came afterward, which left my hair nice and soft. After rinsing in the showers, I was escorted to the massage rooms, where the deep tissue massage/reflexology combo treatment started. With kidney-crushing pressure, my muscles were rolled and kneaded into submission. \n\nI spent a few hours afterwards using the various saunas, alternating between the hot sauna and the cold room. This area is co-ed, so suit up in your ugly pink pajama pants and top! I brought both my towels with me so it wouldn't be too hot laying on some of the hot surfaces, such as the clay balls in the clay ball room.\n\nI also tried some food in the kitchen. I was disappointed they ran out of seafood pancake (Haemul Pajeon), so I decided on the kimchi fried rice. It was made fairly quickly, and was a huge portion, but it was very hot (Almost sauna-like) in the eating area, which made it unappealing to eat hot, spicy, fried rice. I asked if I could bring the food to the air-conditioned bar area, but in an apologetic tone, The cook/owner(?) explained that people complain about the smell of the food so it isn't allowed outside the dining area. She did turn the fan on, but when there's no cool air in the room whatsoever, a fan just blows hot air around. Deciding against sweating while eating, I ate a little bit, then boxed it up to take back. The kimchi fried rice itself was OK, but the price was a bit high for me (~$13-14). Maybe if I go back I'll try a cool food or a smoothie.\n\nCheck out was easy. Any extra charges are put on your locker number. As for tip, the massage/scrub therapist will give you an envelope, and you can put cash in it, or you can charge the tip to your account up front. I found my therapist afterwards and handed a cash tip to her directly.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll go for a scrub or massage again, but I'd definitely like to get a day pass here to relax in the steam rooms, hot tubs, and saunas. My skin does feel smoother and softer after the scrub, but I'm not sure it was worth enduring being scrubbed until it feels like your skin is raw (It wasn't, but it felt like it while I was getting the scrub done)!"

Taking the advice of a spa veteran we met upstairs, we did the clay balls sauna, ice room, jade sauna, ice room, then 'hell' (where you lay in a furnace-looking and -feeling thing), ice room. Downstairs, we did the dry salt sauna, then ventured into the no-clothes-allowed area. It was less comfortable since we were in a group, but we eventually got used to it. My grandma said she felt like 'the queen of naked' by then end.\n\nI have celiac disease, and I get rashes on my hands and feet with the slightest chance of contamination. I've been fighting daily breakouts, trying to figure out where the contamination is coming from.  Since I've been to Imperial Spa, I have had ZERO breakouts, and I have been eating at restaurants left and right (where I am typically contaminated). I don't know which room did it, but something in there might be magic. \n\nAnd I might have to move to Vegas now.\n\nAlso - our husbands were not happy we did not include them.

Before I get myself forcibly admitted to Betty Ford, let's just say if you need a place to detox by choice, Imperial Spa does the trick, and is an excellent place to nurse a killer hangover. \n\nBeing a Korean spa virgin, I didn't know what to expect and still feel like I probably did it all wrong. The front desk worker does not show you around, so it's kind of trial by fire and I felt real stupid walking I around upstairs in my bathing suit and a towel. Wear your little outfits that they give you, friends. \n\nFavorites were the clay ball room, laying I the different little pits, and the ice room, pretending I was in a place with actual seasons. I'm sure my friend and I annoyed all the other patrons by having a monopoly on that ice room all day and having some really intense conversations in the little fridge....sorry that I'm not sorry. \n\nI also had some food.

Now that I've experienced a Korean spa in LA, my appreciation for Imperial has increased.\n\nYou wouldn't expect something so nice in this part of town. The facilities are clean and well-maintained. Imperial Health Spa has everything you need in a Jjimjilbang. The gender-specific sauna areas provide lockers, towels, toiletries, showers, hot/cold tubs, and salt/steam/dry saunas. This is where you start and end your Korean spa experience. We typically just put our things in our lockers (your wristband is your locker key), take a quick shower, change into the provided shirt and shorts, and head up to the second floor.\n\nThe co-ed space upstairs is the \"hangout.\" You can lounge around and watch Korean TV, get some surprisingly good food in the little restaurant (you charge everything to your wristband), and experience the various rooms. My favorites include the Bulgama room and the clay sauna. The Bulgama is the hottest of the saunas and features eight oven-like structures for you to lie inside. If you've ever wondered how a turkey feels at Thanksgiving, this is your chance. In the clay sauna, you immerse yourself in a bed of hot clay balls. It's awesome once you get used to it. We also enjoy cooling off in the ice sauna in between rounds.\n\nWhen we're done relaxing upstairs, we split back up and go do our things in the naked areas. Oh, did I forget to mention that? In the shower/tub/sauna section downstairs, you're supposed to be clothless. I usually try to use both the steam and dry saunas, as well as the hot and maybe the cold tub. Once my skin is sufficiently tenderized, I do a little self-exfoliation scrubbing. They offer body scrub services (and I hear your skin feels amazing afterward), but I have yet to work that in during a visit.\n\nNeedless to say, I always feel uber-relaxed after spending a few hours at Imperial Health Spa. Just a word of caution. Don't go here expecting solitude and quiet. Jjimjilbangs are places for friends and families to hang out. It's the perfect place to bring a bunch of friends and just chill for several hours."

Wherever your Maps tells you it is, turn into there. If it had not been for my best friend's guess, we would've missed that turn.

He took my payment after giving us our pink shorts and shirts, wristbands, towels, and we also asked for slippers. Remember to ask them for some if you did not bring any! After that, he asked if we had been here before or if it was our first time and then he began explaining the process of their Korean spa. He pointed out where the razors and toothbrushes were near the desk and then told us to come back to the front if we needed extra towels. We thanked him and then went on our merry way into the Women's Spa Area. \n\nAfter we walked in, you cannot miss it, shoe lockers. Take your shoes off, put it in the number that coordinates with your wristband/key and throw your little slippers on. Walk more into the area and you will see lockers on the right hand side. These lockers are awesome. Stick your key in, turn it to the right, hear some whirring, and then it opens your locker. After you are done changing.. close your locker, twist the key to the left and remove. Keep this on your wrist at all times.\n\nFirst things first. Walk into the vanity area and through the glass door. On your right hand side will be showers. Take a shower as this is the first of many to prep you for your day. If these showers are ever crowded, there are a few more passed the cold plunge. On the left are squat down showers and on the right are the normal, upright ones. After you shower, go about your spa journey.\n\nThere are three tubs: cold, warm, and hot. The Warm Tub is the biggest and also the only one with working jets. The rule is that you have to be completely nude in order to use the tubs. Strip off that bathing suit (if you had one on in the first place) and let yourself relax! We started with the warm tub to let ourselves begin to relax. After that, we showered. We then added cold water to our provided facial towels, wrung them, and made our way to the Herbal Steam Room. This one was fun, but boy was it hard to breathe without that towel on your face. What did we do after that? You guessed it. We showered. We went into the dry sauna and hung out in there for a bit before I started getting hungry. We showered off again and then put on our pink outfits to go upstairs to the coed area.\n\nThere was no one at the counter, but an instruction paper said to ring the bell and we did. A very sweet lady came out and took our order. It took about 10 minutes. I ordered the Ramen and my best friend ordered the Won Ton Soup. We both agreed that our food was delicious and they even cleaned up after you. You don't need money to order the food! They charge it to your locker number, and you pay for that at checkout. \n\nRed Clay Ball Room time! Luckily, we had brought our towels with us and laid them on top of the clay balls before we went in because those suckers were definitely warmed up! The pit is big enough for two people, but of course, laying together made us a little rambunctious. Luckily, the only other people in there were a couple who were talking and laughing loudly so they didn't seem to mind us. I did notice the \"Quiet Area\" sign. Whoops, sorry guys xP Also, the floor is hot! Be careful getting in and out. All of the amenities have signs next to them that advise you on how to properly and safely use their facilities. \n\nWe entered the Red Clay Room with the red clay domes and attempted to relax, but we were again, too hyper. The floor's hot everywhere, yikes. We took a peek into the Jade Room, but didn't enter because the women in there seemed thoroughly relaxed while doing their bikram yoga and we didn't want to disturb them. We both agreed that we missed the Warm Tub so after taking a peek into the Salt Dry Sauna Room, we showered and went back into the Warm Tub. After that, we took a real shower with our own products and got ready in the Vanity Area. Definitely lots of space. Q-tips, Suave hair products, tissues, and hair dryers are provided.\n\nAfterwards, drop everything that doesn't belong to you in the provided hampers if you haven't been doing so along the way, and then give your key back to the receptionist. Go about your night after a beautiful spa day!\n\nTHANK YOU to all of the Yelpers who wrote tips on their reviews about what to expect. It definitely prepared me for the experience!"

            "review": "This place is FAB---U---LOUS!!!\n\nPlease let's get the record straight though for folks who haven't been to a Korean Bathhouse, the name of this place is deceiving.  \n\nWhile they do have Spa services (massages, facials etc) , this is really a jjimjilbang.  A Korean BATHHOUSE.  Please do not ding this place because it's not as luxurious and attentive like an expensive spa on the Vegas strip.  It's not meant to be.\n\n=======================\nHere is the wikipedia description of  a Jjimjilbang: \nJjimjilbang () are large, gender-segregated public bathhouses in Korea, complete with hot tubs, showers, Finnish-style saunas, and massage tables, similar to what you may find in a Korean sauna or mogyoktang. However, in other areas of the building or on other floors there are unisex areas, usually with a snack bar, ondol-heated floor for lounging and sleeping, wide-screen TVs, PC bang, noraebang, and sleeping quarters with either bunk beds or sleeping mats.\n\nMost jjimjilbangs are open 24 hours and are a popular weekend getaway for Korean families to relax and spend time soaking in tubs or lounging and sleeping, while the kids play away on the PCs.  \n==================\n\nNow I've been on a quest to visit as many of these as I can, as I find it very relaxing to lounge around in a warm dry sauna reading, listening to my ipod with Korean food waiting for me whenever I desire.  Being from the Bay Area, we have very few Korean Bathhouses, so when I just want to relax, I go with one of my daughters whenever we get a lazy day to relax. \n\nThis spa is founded by the same owners who developed the Imperial spa in San Francisco, however, this place is so much more grand.  The pictures posted on yelp are accurate, dark flooring, leather seating throughout, unique dry saunas and clean ,clean, clean!\n\nMy experience: \nFirst floor, you walk in, put your shoes in a shoe locker and proceed to the well appointed locker rooms.  There, you have access to the 3 baths,  Warm, Hot and Cold.  (the HOT tub was extremely hot).  I quickly took a shower and hopped between the hot and cold tub to get my blood going..then noticed that they had two separate steam rooms: Herbal steam room and a Salt Steam room... very nice, because  they kept a big tub of sea salt out where you could take as much as you need to exfoliate in the Salt room...  Oh and by the way,  I was very thankful because everyone (only approx 4 other ladies in the whole facility at the time) was very cognitive about the \"rules\".. everyone showered before entering and re-entering the spas/saunas or dry rooms.. Also on the women's floor which I did not use was a very large \"SALT\" Dry sauna room, and Dry Cedar room.. \n\nI also had an excellent Korean body scrub, in their individual wet rooms.  Woman was very friendly and not at all hounding me for a tip.. for that I tipped her well..\n\n\n2nd floor (the unisex floor) :\n2 large rooms with Leather \"lazy boys\" to individually watch the big screen.  Various Dry Sauna rooms: Clay , Clay ball, Jade etc.. all very large and expansive.. They had a theatre room.. and a separate work out room and Skin services (facials) room.. Oh and of course the Cafe..  My husband and I enjoyed a pretty good korean meal of ramen and egg omeletts.  (approx $8/person) and a pretty good tropical smoothie.\n\nMy only regret is we allocated only 3 hours there.. we could have been there for at least 4-5 .."

How the hell did it take me so long to try it out?!\n\nI'm not really a spa person, but when the weather gets cold and shitty like it is now, and you work as an outdoor art nude model....... this place is VERY therapeutic after a long day spent naked in the desert, shivering your ass off. It's an amazing and cost-effective way to thaw out your bones again.\n\nThe value cannot be overstated -- $20 (less if you get a punchcard or coupon), and you have full use of the various saunas and steam rooms, the cold plunge and the hot jacuzzis. The variety of different saunas and steam rooms is exceptional -- some salt, some jade, some herbal and one filled with warm little red clay balls. And then a sort of chic walk-in freezer with mood lighting, to \"close\" your pores at the end of your stay.\n\nEverything is super-clean and well-organized, probably because most of the patrons are Koreans and have some kinda weird culture of respect and cleanliness. But what really deserves 5 stars is the ambiance: relaxed, but not sanctimonious. Most everyone was chatting quietly or looking at their cell phones while steaming/baking/etc, which is a HUGE plus for me! I hate those Nazi spas that mandate silence and no phones!! \n\nI haven't had a massage or scrub yet, so I can't comment on those services. But based on the spa alone, I will definitely be back!"

            "review": "I have been here numerous times and really do enjoy this place. It is located off of Sahara and is easy to miss if your not looking. Once inside you will usually meet up with a female Korean girl working at the desk. They no longer give locals a discount for $15.00. It is $20.00 for all day spa usage, $30.00 for all night (Yes you can sleep here) it is a Korean bath house afterall and if you purchase a massage or any treatment over $70.00 in price the spa entrance fee is waved. \n\nThe girl at the desk will give you your spa Pj's, a key with a number on it, 2 towels one small and one large and if you need slippers they will also provide those if you just ask. After you receive your  items you will go to your designated side. Males to the left, females to the right. When you first enter your respected locker room take off your shoes and place them in the shoe locker. This locker doesn't lock even though it looks like it might. The number on your key is the locker you place your shoes and socks in. After you do that proceed around the corner and find your clothes locker. Again, it is the same number that is on your key. \n\nNow, like other reviewers have stated if your are not comfortable with your body or if you have any problems being naked in front of the same sex, this isn't the place for you. Almost everything here is done in the nude. Except for when you go upstairs into the co-ed area. Then you must have on your spa Pj's. Now that we got that out of theway, lets proceed. \n\nOnce at your locker, get naked, grab your small towel and head over to the wet area. Shower first before you go into any of the pools or saunas. Shower, then go soak in the hot or cold pools. Head into one of the three saunas and relax for a bit. After that shower before you enter any of the pools again. No one wants your nasty body sweat floating around in the pool.  So shower.\n\nIn the wet area there is a hot and cold pool. Three saunas, one dry, one herbel and one salt. If you would like salt go see the girl at the front desk, she will give you one bag. After that dry off, put on your Pj's and go up to the 2nd floor. There are numerous other sanuas, tv room, workout room, food (Extra charge as it should be) and chairs to lounge out in. \n\nI've had a body scrub done which is done in your locker room area. I'm a male and the person doing the scrubbing was male, that's how it is, deal with it. You lay down naked on a table and the man scrubs every area of your body and gets your skin nice and clean. I also has a massage done by a female masseur in an area outside of the locker rooms. This area is known as the massage area. The massage was good and professional. This is not an Asian massage parlour like we have so many of in Vegas. If your looking for that kind of extra service you will not find it here. Most of the other reviews are spot on and describe this place in enough detail. If your looking for a quiet place, that's not to busy go check it out . You cannot beat it for $20.00."

However I really came here to enjoy a relaxing morning and I am a bit disappointed.  Maybe to say I'm a bit disappointed is being kind.\n\n1.  Water temperatures are off.  Warm water tube is large and spacious however the temperature is too lukewarm at best.....a joke.  The hot water temperature was better, but that was closer to warm water temperatures elsewhere.\n\n2.  Red Clay ball Room and even one of the Salt Room....again the temperature is off.  Not hot enough....highly disappointed.  I did find the Red Clay room to be pleasant.\n\n3.  Food here is served....is it?  The time says from  10-9pm.  We rang the bell....no response.  Phone upstairs is broken so I called from downstairs to contact someone....no response.  So we asked the people at the front what is going on with the kitchen.  Their response the lady should be here in 30 minutes but there isn't a set time when she serves.  Are you kidding me?  \n\nI really feel like I didn't get the full experience here and I need to do a do over back in Ca.  This is not the proper way to run a business!!\n\n...............................................................................\n\nOkay so finally someone came and took our order.  Gave me one wrong meal....then forgot the rice for the other.  Said he was making it and would take 10 minutes.  The rice came and low and behold it was old, yellow, stinky rice that was reheated up.  I'm not an idiot when it comes to cooking don't give me that.  I told him it was old and it smelled and there was no way it was new and requested to see the owner.  He decided to comp the meal.\n\nI guess if you have never fully experienced a proper Korean Spa, perhaps you wouldn't know the difference.  I'm sorry Do Not Waste Your Time Or Money!!"

            "review": "I was so excited to find a Korean style spa here in Vegas!!! They had a groupon good for 2 people so a friend and I went one weekday afternoon. Unlike the other Korean style spas I've been to in the past, this place provides clothing for you to wear in the non-nude areas but it does not provide flip flops (nor do they allow you to wear outside shoes). My biggest problems with this were they didn't seem to care about getting a variety of sizes of shorts, so my fat butt was barely able to wear the shorts comfortably and I wasn't really thrilled about having to walk around barefoot. \n\nSo, downstairs is split into the women's side and the men's side. I assume both sides are pretty similar but I don't know for sure. We were assigned a locker each to put our clothing and once we stripped down we went exploring. In the downstairs \"wet\" area, there are 3 tubs (a hot tub, warm tub and cold tub), stand up and sit down shower areas, 3 saunas (one dry sauna, a steam sauna and an herbal steam sauna), and then the private service rooms if you get a massage or body treatment. The regular steam sauna was not open, but otherwise we tried everything out. Also in the nude, women's only area, is a sitting area for drying off/getting ready to leave), a quiet nap room (right off the locker room. I almost didn't notice it!) and a dry salt room (which is the only downstairs area I have a complaint about. The lights are a little too bright and each time the main door opened, the back \"employees only\" door would open a bit). \n\nUpstairs is mixed gender and therefore non-nude. It has a bigger variety of rooms, all \"dry\" rooms: a clay ball room (where you lay in a \"bed\" of tiny red clay balls, or towards the back they had \"beds\" with crystals. It was warm in there, but not super instantly start sweating hot), a red clay room (without the tiny little clay balls. Instead you lay inside these individual little \"houses.\" The floor was SUPER hot in there), a jade sauna room (warm, but not hot in there), a nap room, and finally the ice room (which was very cold, but very refreshing after sweating like crazy). Also upstairs is a sitting area and a cafe which serves over priced food & non-alcoholic drinks. I didn't get anything from the cafe, but just looking at the menu prices I was taken aback by their pricing. \n\nOverall, I'm glad this place is in Vegas. I dislike the lack of options when it comes to shorts, the lack of provided footwear, and the too bright of lighting in the dry salt room. I like the red clay ball room a lot (it sounded uncomfortable but laying on that bed of red clay balls, my back felt so freaking good afterwards!!) and the herbal steam sauna. I like that they have signs telling you how to use each room and the health benefits provided. The staff wasn't talkative or helpful but we didn't really have a whole lot of questions and spoke to some of the other people there if we couldn't figure something out. I would like if they gave out 2 large towels instead of just one, though. Next time I go (because I will go back), I'll bring my own indoor slippers and some shorts of my own to wear in the non-nude areas."

I was handed a couple of towels a t-shirt, and shorts, but even after telling them that this was my first visit, I was not given much direction as to what I should do while waiting for the appointment with my masseuse. I would recommend that they give us newbies a quick tour of the facilities and some basic instructions. As is, I wandered around, wondering how to utilize many of the facilities (Clay Ball Sauna? WTF is that?). \n\nIt is certainly true that you have to be comfortable with nudity to hang out here. Two things I would definitely recommend bringing with you: shower shoes and a swimsuit. This place is lousy with mirrors, and I don't particularly care to look at naked middle-aged women, including myself. There are no changing rooms, and the showers aren't curtained off. However, they do have a big mirror under every shower head. \n\nAs I sat in the \"warm\" tub (they have 3 whirlpools, hot, warm, and cold), I saw a rather chunky. middle-aged Asian lady changing from street clothes into a lacy black bra and panties. Moments later, I heard her call, \"Stacey? Stacey?\" and I realized that she was my masseuse and the \"sexy\" bra and panties was apparently her uniform. Marketing note to owners: Putting the mom-shaped masseuse into lingerie does not enhance the experience for most of us ladies. \n\nI had prepared myself for the \"torture\" that I had heard was involved in the body scrub, and it actually wasn't bad. The masseuse donned a couple of mitts that looked like those Scotch-brite pads one uses to clean pots, and scrubbed everywhere. It was a little rough, but not really painful. And effective, I might add. I opened my eyes at one point and saw what appeared to be hundreds of gray lint balls on the massage table, and then realized \"Eeeww! That's my skin!\" \n\nAfterwords, I had a \"Swedish\" massage with oil, and I have to say, my skin has not been this soft and smooth in years. It was definitely worth the price, and I intend to return."

I have a few things to add:\n\n- Bring flip flops.  They didn't supply them for me and I walked around barefoot the whole time.  It wasn't bad but I was running out of a couple of the sauna rooms really quickly since the floor was hot.   \n\n- No option for bathing suits.  You will be naked with everyone else.  I am very near sighted so everyone looks like they've been blurred out for public television.\n\n- Be VERY careful when getting into one of the beds in the red clay ball room.  It's like walking on a hundred marbles and the floor is not forgiving.  I wiped out pretty bad and strained my MCL.  My doctor said I'll be fine in a week.  Thanks to all that laughed at me (wife included).  I am going butt in first the next time.  \n\n- The signs say to use each sauna on the 2nd floor for 3-7 minutes.  You can definitely do a little longer than that.  But one guy fell asleep in the red clay ball room (you could hear him snoring) and I am guessing he was in there for a solid hour.  He looked like a total disaster when he came out.  Stay hydrated!\n\n- I never do this but I paid $1 for the 3 minute massage chairs.  There were 2 types.  One was the standard massage which was decent and the other was the \"slimming massage chair\" which was ridiculous.  The latter just started shaking your butt from left to right, up and down like you were going through terrible airplane turbulence and it also crushed your calves.  Definitely avoid that one.\n\nI know it sounds like I am just complaining but there's a lot to like about Imperial.  The steam rooms are great.  I enjoyed sitting in the sheer heat of the herbal steam room only to jump into the cold tub as soon as I got out.

There were too many people who did not know what to do and a lot of noise. There were two massage therapist that wouldn't shut up. One was a little heavy set white lady with dark hair and the other a Hispanic lady with short dark hair. They were talking so loud we could hear them in the saunas. People kept giving them dirty looks but they didn't care. This place needs to regulate their staff. My massage and scub was pretty good. I enjoyed it. Besides the annoying employees I would of had a prefect spa day."

We found a Groupon for this place, and we LOVED IT! \n\nUpon arrival, we received a large towel, a small towel, a shirt, shorts, and a locker key. It's expected to shower first before you go into any of the spas or saunas. It's also expected that you will be totally NUDE while on the first floor. That means no swim suits. No undergarments. Seriously.\n\nThe spas here are really relaxing. There's a warm tub, hot tub and cold tub. There's also a dry sauna, wet sauna, herbal tea sauna, salt sauna and more. \n\nUpstairs is co-ed, so this is where you wear the clothes given to you upon entrance. There are some more rooms to experience here such as an ice room and a clay room (where you lay down on small hard round balls of clay or rocks). At the time that we visited, part of the place was under construction so we weren't able to experience certain rooms. You can also sit in one of the many chairs and just relax, while watching tv. The food is a bit over-priced, so I didn't taste it. However, I did see some folk eating in an adjacent room with tables. Maybe someday, I'll order something.\n\nThis place is so relaxing. If I didn't have anywhere else to be that day, I could have stayed literally all day. I also wished I could have experienced the rooms that were closed off due to maintenance/construction, so that is something to look forward to next time I visit."

Either way all the saunas are pretty good for your skin, and to add there are a bunch of jacuzzis and hot tubs you can relax in. If you wanted a massage you have to ask at the front desk before entering the spa, and they do massages for you upstairs in one of the massage rooms. There's normally lockers given to you and there should be razors, tooth brushes, q-tips, hair dryers, etc. if not all out. The cleanliness of this place is incredible considering how many people come here everyday. Now to add you can go upstairs and there are hot clay ball rooms or the cold room or different types of cool rooms to be in but they're also very relaxing. Or if you're hungry you can get yourself some food at the kitchen upstairs where all the resting chairs are and the TV. I absolutely love the kitchen you can order all sorts of stuff, The udon is my favorite. They sell smoothies, coffee, green tea, wings, soup, and basically all sorts of good stuff. Except the fact they close the kitchen at 8:40 but that's ok the place closes at 11. I would definitely recommend all my friends here and I would most likely be bringing all my friends here haha because there's two separate spas, one for men and one for women. But upstairs you guys are all allowed to meet back up and eat some food or so or sit in the hot clay ball room (my fav room). The owners do a very good job maintaining this spa and it deserves a perfect 5 stars in my opinion."

            "review": "Let me start off by saying that this place has so much potential. \nThe bestie took me to Imperial Health Spa after a crazy Saturday night out on the strip. We were a bit beat up from the floor up so a visit was much needed. She purchased a $20 deal on Groupon for two people, not bad.\n\nThe spa is not on the main street. It's in an odd area, a little sketchy even off of the main road. They have ample parking space.\n\nThe ladies at the front counter have NO customer skills whatsoever. They handed us the towel, pointed towards the door and said in there naked. We encountered a nice lady inside who gave us a play by play on how things run in there. Once they verify that you have an appointment they will you hand you a towel, locker key, shirt, and shorts. Grab a locker, remove all your clothing and take your towel and key with you. \nTake conditioner, scrubs, masks, and anything else that you might need. They do not provide anything except for body gel and shampoo. \n\nOnce you have made your way to where the pools and saunas are, to your right, wash yourself. You'll be getting in the pools naked, be considerate and make sure you are squeaky clean. If you have a bush, hairy armpits, hairy anything... take your time and clean yourself.\n\nStart with the pools first. The big one to your left is hot but not jacuzzi hot, jump in for about fifteen minutes then move on the hot one across from it. That one is hotter, take your time. Another fifteen minutes there. Last but not least walk towards the back and get in the cold pool. Is not freezing, just cold. After the pools, try out the sauna and steam room on the left-hand side. Once you're done, shower again. If at any point you go urinate, and you will. Shower before getting back in the pools. \n\nUpstairs you'll find the red clay ball room and the arctic room. I was not impressed with either. The floor in the clay room is too hot and the tiny balls are recipe for disaster. Watch your step and do not walk inside barefoot. Get on your knees to get on top of the tiny little balls. The arctic room was nowhere as cold as we expected. \n\nThe place can use some renovations. It does not look like the pictures on their website. Lack of customer service and the place not looking up to part led me to write this 2 star review."

Therefore, if you use a certain shampoo, conditioner and body wash, do bring your own.  \n-facial moisturizer: unless you want to use the suave body lotion for your face.\n-bath salt: they don't offer this for free when request at the front desk anymore.  \n\nThings to remember to get from the front desk besides the big towel and bracelet with your locker number/lock attached:\n-toothbrush\n-razor\n-slippers\n\nThings to remember to do before going into the sauna/steam room:\n-small towel, dip it into cold water, and cover your face because these rooms are sure to disorient you without that protection.\n\nWe saw half of the females in bathing suit and half naked.  We didn't appreciate a group of ladies decided to submerge themselves in the warm bath without taking a shower.  There are signs indicating to shower prior to enjoying the baths but clearly that group did not read.  Gross.  Good thing we had already dipped in that warm bath.\n\nAfter we enjoyed the various baths and steam rooms and saunas downstairs, we head up to the second level (co-ed), and enjoyed all the rooms.  At the jade room, we put on a collagen mask.  After 20 minutes, we skedaddle over to the red clay room.  Looks like a bunch of furnaces, but Debbie and I decided that it's our favorite room.  While we were lying in these furnace like structure, ladies in the two other furnaces decided to socialize to get to know each other.  Again, there are signs posted out front for them to be quiet.    Whatevs.\n\nWhen we got to the red clay balls room, we put on another cucumber mask and after 20 minutes of that, we made it to the final pit stop, the ice room.\n\nAfterward, we head back down to the first level and rinse off.  Was a very relaxing 4 hours we spent at this spa.  Will definitely come back."

I was a bit apprehensive going to this place since it was located in the hood of Las Vegas, but i felt much better when i saw a couple of Mercedes and BMWs parked outside in the front, just make sure you bring your valuables inside. You pay $20 to enter and you have access to everything in the spa. they give you a wristband and that is the key to your locker. You change into your clothes they give you, make sure you bring your own slippers, you will be more comfortable. \n\nThey have a bunch of cool rooms on the second floor ( communal area) you can try, the ones i did were the red ball clay room which was really cool. Beware! step in butt first or you will fall on yo @ss like i did rolling all over the place disturbing the peace in the room! haha! memorable! After the red ball clay room I went into this other room with these little clay dome  huts i forgot what they were called, All i know is they help you detox, I did it because I enjoyed the heat, it  made my muscles and back from working out relaxed, after all that hot and steamy stuff I decided to chill in the Ice room, which cooled me off. \n\nAfter your finished you can relax in the spa on the first floor, just make sure you shower before entering in. They had a bunch of other rooms upstairs which I did not get to since I was in a rush to get home. I will definitely go back and check out the movie room and the restaurant ( which was closed at the time i went because it was late at night) and also I will try their massage and see if it is any good.\n\nOverall, loved my experience here, the staff was friendly, this place is legit no monkey business!"

            "review": "I'm glad I tried this out. I was freaked out by the nakedness but decided to just go for it. I didn't walk around the first floor buckey naked like a lot of women were, but in the hot/warm/cold tub areas it was best to be free in your birthday suit.\n\nI decided to go after reading a lot of reviews and tried my best to follow the rules, but really, no one was. I wore my own yoga capris because the shorts given to me had a huge hole in the crotch. So whats more offensive: me wearing my own clean clothes, or you having to look at my vagina as you roll around in clay balls.\n\nNo one was quiet in the quiet rooms, and that was fine with me. It wasn't yelling like a party but people were quietly speaking to each other. In the sauna on the first floor and lot of women just struck up conversations. I met a lot of women from LA who were here for birthday parties or bachelorette parties. \n\nThe clay ball beds was the most hilarious experience. People were falling and in some instances could not get up. Here's a tip: go into the room wearing shoes, the floor is FUCKING HOT. Bring the small hand towel you're given when you first check in. Lay it down on the clay balls. Step out of your shoes and on to your towel, SLOWLY. If you step in facing the middle of the room, you can brace yourself on a wall or on the middle divider and lower yourself. You do not want to put your bare feet on hands directly on the balls for too long, they are hot! And you have to be careful. A lot of people would come in without shoes and try to run out, only to nearly fall after slipping on clay balls which are all over the floor. Anytime anyone stood up the balls would fall down, clacking all over the place. \n\nI think people didn't follow the rules because there was no one where to enforce them. They give you clothes and you're just on your own. It's pretty cool that its all self-guided, but would be nice to be able to ask someone about the different rooms, or what order you should do things in. \n\nThe only rule breaking that annoyed me was people bringing their phones with them everywhere. You're supposed to be relaxing in a spa, plus, in a place where people are not fully clothed, its just disrespectful to have a phone with a camera out at all time. Respect our privacy. \n\nYou could tell that some people were regulars. Women were wearing face masks and biore strips (steam rooms open up those pores), doing hair treatments and applying body lotions and oils. By the time I left my skin was REALLY soft with out all of that, but for next time I am going to bring some beauty products. \n\nAlso, choose the time you go carefully. There is a groupon out, and a lot of people are using it. There were A LOT of people there, probably because it was a weekend. When I left the parking lot was full. \n\nI'm not giving it five stars because the holes in the clothes (there was a hole in the shoulder of the shirt they gave me in addition to the crotchless shorts) and because the food was HELLA expensive. $20 for something I could get anywhere in Chinatown for $7. I also think the massages and body scrubs are ridiculously prices. $120 for a massage? In Vegas? Off the Strip? No ma'am."

After reading all the reviews here on yelp we decided to give it a try. First, the facilities are nice inside. The dressing room men's and women's areas are nicely maintained and they have thought of everything for your comfort. The respective areas include multiple areas of relaxation and rejuvenation including dry and wet saunas, salt sauna, whirlpool, ice bath, stand-up and sit down showers. The coed areas include the Red Clay ball rooms (best experience every) and the ice room (also a favorite). Included in the coed area is relaxation areas and a cafe that looked nice. Second, massages are offered and we HIGHLY recommend. It was the BEST massage I've ever received to date.  Overall, very nice facility. It is a Korean spa so they do abide by the no clothing rule in the men's and women's areas. Lounge clothes (hospital scrub like) clothing is provided for the coed areas. Some Yelpers said this element made them uncomfortable and we were a little nervous but the environment and staff makes you so comfortable that it really is ok. People were very respectful. You will need to bring a pair of flip flops. We WILL go back next time we are in Vegas. Great value as opposed to a day trip to say Qua at Caesar's or the Spa at Mandalay Bay."

I checked in and was given clothes to change into, slippers, and a key to the locker.  I had my scrub scheduled first. I was told to strip down and soak in the hot tub for 20 min. before my service to loosen the dead skin (a hot tub of dead skin and naked people woo hoo!).  My lady called me (by locker number, this isn't the Bellagio here) and lead me to a room with a padded table covered with the plastic that reminds you of what your grandma had on her dinning room  tables 7 years after buying them.  I was expecting a salt scrub, but she scabbed me down with a mit that was probably intended to clean a stove, but did it ever scrub the dead skin off! Now I'm a daly bather but when she showed me what was on the mit you'd think I hadn't showered in a month! When its time to splash off the clumps of dead skin she dips her bowl into a by-the-curb size garbage can filled with water.  No fancy shower above the table here.  No dim lights either.  \nNext was the massage, I was super thankful that we switched rooms, as i didn't want to slide off that plastic wrapped table.  We went upstairs (which is co-ed... time to put of the of so fashionable clothes that have never ever seen a drop of fabric softener) This room was a traditional massage room set up, table with a face hole, nothing super special, but not horrible.  \nNext up was my facial.  I switched to a different girl (I was slightly concerned as I'm fine getting \"reflexology\" from a person who isn't a licensed masseuse but when it comes to extractions, chemicals and microdermabraion I want to see a license).  \nI forget the girls name, (holga. elga something like that...) She was very good, she spent a little too much time on extractions for my annoyance threshold, but my skin needed it.  The microdremabrason machine seemed a little past its prime, not as potent as the ones I've had in med spas, but i could still tell a difference.  \nAt this time I had been there for about 3 hours and I was ready to go home, so I didn't try out all of the red clay balls and jade room, but that seems to be detailed in every other review.  \nAll in all I liked the services, no frills, and about 1/2 the price of the same services in a strip spa."

Yes. \n\nFirst things first. If you're new to the spa scene, especially with this being a Korean spa, make sure you let the receptionist know so that she can give you the lowdown and you can get better acquainted with the various rooms and regulations. That was our first mistake - We had just walked in totally clueless. Consequently, an older asian lady had scolded us in the powder room for wearing our bathing suits in the jacuzzi room. So be prepared to go out in your birthday suit on the first floor (which is gender separated btw). Also, we weren't aware of this, but there are toothbrushes and razors at your convenience just right before you enter the locker rooms.\n\nOnce you get all showered up, soaked in the jacuzzi to your heart's content, and sweated out all your toxins in the steam and sauna rooms, you can then shower again (they're all about cleanliness), throw on the oversized T-shirt and shorts they provide you with, and head up to the second floor. \n\nThere are several rooms here which all incorporate eastern elements such as jade and red clay, that supposedly aid in a variety of ailments. Signs in front of each room provide you with more details on this since I have forgotten the exact verbiage. My favorite was the red clay ball room - so relaxing!!! The concept is simple - you lay on a bed of heated tiny red clay balls and just relax. Try not to fall asleep. \n\nThere was also a space to follow a yoga instruction DVD, a snack bar (which we didn't get to eat at), an ice room (which was under construction at the time we went, but looked pretty cool...get it? nevermind), a small gym facility, and lots of comfy recliners to relax in.\n\nThere are a number of spa services available for separate fees, but we just wanted to check this place out.

The rooms are very unique for Las Vegas, I've never experienced anything like it. Most of the rooms were warm, only 1 being a little hot and there was also an ice room for a break from any heated rooms. Our favorites were the red clay ball room and sauna/steam rooms. While in the ball room, dig into the balls to experience more heat. Do bring a pair of your own sandals as the floors in some rooms get hot.There is a yoga room but we saw no instructor or schedule? The ice room was about 40-50 degrees id say and between the ice room and heated rooms, it worked wonders on some upper back/nerve pain that flared up a bit before. \n\nWe planned to hit the jacuzzis last, at that time we discovered the real sauna (there is a room temp salt room sauna that we were a little let down by) and also found 2 amazing steam rooms. My girlfriends and I agreed that next time we visit, we will hit the sauna and steam rooms first, then the co Ed rooms, then finish at the jacuzzi's and showers. The jacuzzi's, sauna and steam rooms are entirely nude so be aware if that's not something you're accustomed to. \n\nEvery piece of this facility was very well maintained. Ask for an extra towel when checking in as they only provide you with one large and on small face towel. I used one towel for the jacuzzi and steam rooms and the other large towel for my shower afterwards. The clothing they provide is very unattractive so you may get a laugh when first putting them on. I brought my own shampoo/conditioner but they had both there plus shower gel and several other basic toiletries. The shower gel dried my skin out a bit but not a big deal. \n\nWe spent about 3 hours at this spa but could've easily stayed longer. There are a couple of dim lit areas for napping or just relaxing and reading a book. The Korean food place inside smelled amazing and also serves boba tea, coffee, smoothies. Overall a FANTASTIC and relaxing experience that I will absolutely enjoy again."

It was pretty tart for my taste. We went on a Tuesday morning/afternoon so there were only a handful of people there. It may be best to go during the weekday. We were able to lounge out in the movie theater room and take a nap before our flight took off. Overall, kudos to this place. I'll definitely be back."

My entire body gets so smooth and glows.  The Spa is awesome.  I love spending hours here (sauna, steam room, the waters).  They have a great resting area along with a great dressing area.  The prices are better than the spas in the resorts.\n\nThis is one of those places that you walk in tired and come out feeling like a newborn.\n\nLooking forward to my next visit!"

This is a fantastic experience! I'm writing this laying in a stone bed of heated clay marbles, just after a full body exfoliation/moisturization then massage. The guy that worked on me said \"much dead skin\". I knew that when sunlight hit my legs waiting for a table at breakfast.\nExfoliation here is akin to sanding paint off a car!\n\nHe wasn't shy on the massage either. The largest muscles in the body are the glutes and I can affirm a Spartan Race abuses them fully. All of my previous massage therapists were shy in this area, not A Korean with over 20 years experience , thank you!\n\nIt took some getting over my modesty when in the men's saunas but steam works wonders in more ways than one.\nRead the other YELP reviews, one details everything a first timer needs to know.\nThis was a fantastic first experience.\n@SpartanRace @MannColonel\n #rejuvenated #recovered #spartan"

It's not sexual and the other reviewers who make it sound so negative, just don't know how to relax and be at peace.\n\nI've had several massages there and all were great. The ones done by \"Chong\" were incredible.\n\nThe spa is upscale and spotless. Sure there are lovely places on the Strip but locals can enjoy the Imperial for a mere $20 ($30 for tourists).\n\nMy only suggestions for improved service? It's okay to have every television tuned in to Korean TV but put the \"closed captions\" to English for the rest of us."

            "review": "I absolutely love coming here. My best friend and I will always go to a foot spa to get a massage then come here after to continue our day of relaxation. \n\nWhen you enter the facility, there are two doors. One leads to the women's locker room and bathing areas and the other to the men's. There are small lockers to put your shoes in and bigger lockers to put all your clothes and toiletries in. There is a shower area where everybody's first stop should be before using anything else. Toiletries are provided but we're quite picky with what we use in our hair and on our bodies so we always bring our own. There are 3 tubs, one with hot water, one with warm water and one with ice cold water. There's also a station with a bunch of stools and mirrors. I've seen plenty of women doing some serious scrubbing with these little pads there. There are also a number of dry saunas and steam rooms. I love the herbal steam room myself.\n\nUpstairs is co ed. There is a red clay room, which have little huts you can lay in. There's a switch to control the amount of light that's in your little hut and there's a mat and pillow in each hut. It gets quite warm but I've dozed off in there a couple of times. There's a jade room which is also quite hot. There is also an ice room, one of my favorites! But our ultimate favorite is the red clay ball room. Inside there are about 8 areas filled with red clay balls or stones. You can lay in it and it's great coz it gets in every crevice in your back and warms it up. There is also a room where they have yoga videos on a loop. Towards the back and the front of the second floor, they have TVs with big couches and recliners where you can doze off for a bit. They usually play Asian programs on the TVs so we usually use this place to nap haha. \n\nI mentioned toiletries before. Bring your own if you are picky (like us) with what you use on your body and in your hair. They also supply hair dryers so that's nice. They used to supply shower shoes but at our last visit, they said they no longer do that. I'm not sure if they still do and they just ran out that day since it was quite busy or if they don't supply them at all now. The woman at the front desk spoke very little English and the little she knew was hard to understand. We will be bringing our own from now on.\n\nOne star off since the services are way overpriced. Other than that, it's a great place to come and relax for a few hours or even the whole day."

Huge amount of space with different theme rooms, and the option of paying a small ($20?) fee to have run of it is a steal. I got a massage, which was quite nice, and they had a room with individual tubs full of little heated clay balls. That was fun and I'd never seen it before. But mostly, it's just so ...itself. It's a Korean spa that's inviting everybody, so it includes a lot of details that are familiar to Koreans and novel to everybody else. This is worth seeing, because it gives you an immersive experience that's like traveling without actually having to get on a plane, etc."

There is almost always a groupon going on for this place! Always check!! Beats paying $20 per person there. \n\n*ALSO* if you buy a groupon for 4 people, but you just want to go by yourself/just with one other person, they will write a coupon card with the remainder! This way you can use your remaining groupon visits each time you come in with the card! So go with a friend or by yourself, they're accommodating for whichever groupon you purchase!\n\nThis is a korean spa tucked away on Sahara and Maryland. Not visible from the major streets. Ample parking.\n\nI absolutely adore this place! You walk in, pay, and you're free to enjoy the saunas or pay extra for their facials/other spa services they offer. If you've never been to an asian sauna, (I know I was confused) here's some helpful step-by-step tips:\n\nFIRST: After paying, they hand you a waterproof wristlet key for your locker; towels; baggy T-shirt + pants to change into for sauna. There's also disposable razor blades. Feel free to ask for extra towels and slippers! Some of the room floors are HOT. Trust. \nGo to your gender segregated room; take off your street shoes please!! Look for your real locker after the tiny shoe lockers. Deposit your stuff and bring any bath stuffs. Undress completely. Yes, it's one of those spas. You're nude. Get used to seeing other nude people as well. Haha.\n\nIf you're body-shy, wrap yourself with your itty-bitty towel. Head to the shower place room past the lounge area with the sinks/mirrors. There's rows of showerheads/mirrors along with generic shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser in case you didn't bring your own tote. Pull up a stool and have fun manipulating the temperature. To get a hotter water temperature, just know there is a red button to push in as you slide it toward you. It's a safety measure. Can you say unlimited hot shower?!\n\nAfter, you can enjoy their 2 hot bath pools or their cool temp pool. Please don't go in without scrubbing/washing yourself proper! You're meant to go in nude for sanitation purposes. There's a dry sauna in this room as well.\n\nHead back to your locker and change to your baggy T-shirt and pants. As you're barefoot, marvel at how clean everything is or just wear the slippers you asked for at the front desk. Head upstairs for the co-ed saunas now! \n\nThere's a caf\u00e9, lounge area with korean TV playing, and the sauna rooms. \n\nROOMS: The clay ball room has giant tubs filled with tiny clay balls that are HOT as you get in. It is a bit noisy as you get in and out. Careful not to slip when you get out! \n\nThe jade room is a room with large mats. Lie down with a friend, plug in your headphones, relax to the herbal-infused air here.\n\nThere's a water dispenser where the food bar is. Be sure to drink plenty of cold water!! Plenty of fluids are lost when you're sweating this much.\n\nThe red clay room is one of faves as well. Be warned, the floors are searingly hot as you step in. Clean house sandals/flip-flops are the way to go! The red domes each have a mat and a light control switch in there. It doesn't get too bright though. My friends and I play card games crammed in one dome haha. Easily the hottest room, sure to sweat your heart out. \n\n*Look for the wi-fi password listed outside this room!*\n\nFOOD: The caf\u00e9 does have pricey food. I believe it comes with banchan (multiple korean side dishes like kimchi) with whatever meal you order. We normally get the hard-boiled eggs ($1 each) and the delicious sweet rice drink. Super refreshing. Hand them your key # and you pay when you return your key at the front desk.\n\nOne of my favorite rooms is the frozen room. Small. Feels like sitting in a mcdonald's freezer, only without the gross frozen McRibs and the self-loathing. Very nice change of pace from sweating.\n\nAfter all that sweat, it's a good idea to head back downstairs, strip again (throw your sauna clothes in one of the large chutes), and take another shower. They also have standing showers at one end if you want a lighter shower. \n\nAMBIANCE: it's never super crowded whenever I go, especially during the weekdays. Very soothing. Quiet normally. \n\nHave a hangover? Stressed out? Come here. It's fun to go with friends. It's slightly awkward being naked around each other at first, but it's also a great place to bond, hang out, and have a girls' day. You know it's love when a friend scrubs your back! Also a fun date idea. My skin always feels amazing when I leave. Super affordable, fun, and a great experience! Absolutely my favorite place to detox and relax."

Sometimes, Groupon will have specials where you can grab an awesome deal for an even lower price! \n\nWhen you enter, they provide you with a shirt, shorts, 3 different towels, shoes and a locker. You change into whatever you want to wear and you can start using the facility!\n\nDownstairs is the separated area- men's in the other corner, women in the other side and upstairs has the co-ed and restaurant facility.\n\nThe women's section downstairs has hot tubs, different types of saunas and a shower area. My favorite sauna in the women's section is the dry salt sauna. Each room tells you what each element does for your body. The dry salt helps with your metabolism and your skin looking young and fresh! \n\nWhen you walk upstairs, you have to wear the outfit they provide for you since it's a co-ed area. They have red clay balls where you literally sink your entire body and you swear off all the bad toxins in your body. They also have a jade room sauna where soaking off the jade in your body helps your metabolism and skin. To end off sweating in the saunas, you go in the cold room to close all your pores!\n\nThis place is so relaxing. You can stay here for as long as they stay open... all for $20! Amazing. Where else can you get a better deal?!"

It's a real treat when there are not too many people, as it seems many aren't too familiar with the rules. I have posted a picture with the three most important ones.\nIt's simple really. Let me walk you through it. \nUpon arrival you will be handed shirts, pants, a small and large towel, and waterproof keys. \nWomen to the right and men to the left. \nFirst take off your shoes. They'll provide you with slippers if you ask. Place your street shoes in a locker. Any locker, as these do not require a key. \nGo to your locker and strip down to your birthday suit completely. Wrap a towel around yourself if you're conscious but at a jim jil bang it is common for everyone to be naked. No one cares how you look. Seriously.\nImmediately after, GO SHOWER. Please please shower before entering any of the baths. Shower after the sauna. Shower after the restroom. Shower after a massage. Shower after and before every activity, preferably. There are standing and sit-down showers. Take your pick. \nWhen using the baths (jacuzzi) you have a choice between cold, warm, or hot water. In all three you are allowed to bring in NOTHING but your body. That means NO BATHING SUITS for sanitary purposes. These rules are also posted near the baths but it seems that customers fail to read signs. \nDo your best to remember that this is a spa - people come to relax, so please keep quiet. There are quiet rooms, but even if not in a quiet zone it would be polite use inside voices :-)\nWhen you've had enough of saunas and jacuzzis and showers in between, put on the shirt and pants given to you in the beginning. Sure, they may not fit well. just fold up the pants at the hips a few times. Don't use your own. Again, for sanitary purposes. We don't know where your clothes have been. \nOnce clothed go upstairs. Relax at the recliners/couches and watch television. Go into the clay ball room (bring the slippers- floors are HOT!), jade room, red clay room, ice room, or dark room temperature room. These are quiet rooms as well.\nWhile you're up there do some yoga or watch a movie. Eat at their overpriced restaurant (it's a mere $20 for all-day use of their facilities, what do you expect!). $6 bowls of instant ramen but hey if you're hungry.. Then go back downstairs and shower again.\nThat's about all there is to it! Did I mention shower? Enjoy!\n\n5/28/16 update: prices have risen at the restaurant. $8 for ramen?!  Be sure to ask for your razors or toothbrush at the front desk before going in now. Also, bring your own CLEAN flip flops for the saunas. \nAgain, shower and enjoy!"

Just minus the big bulky wooden doors and kept it sealed and shut-in, and minus the 15 huge oversized, overused recliners, which I really miss. But at least the main area still has some recliners, although, i still prefer the ones they got rid of . haha. I usually just go in there to rest in silence and away from the rest of the guests, however if you feel like watching a movie, just ask one of the nice ladies at the food bar, and choose from the list which american, or korean movie you would like to watch and they will put it on for you! \n\nSecondly, AND MOST EXCITING, is the new addition of the ICE ROOM! oh yessss. No more running downstairs three times, changing in and out of sauna clothes just to take a dip in the ice cold bath. Now i can easily move from a sauna room and into a huge walk in FREEZER! awesome for bringing the heart rate down, but don't stay too long in there. \n\nThat is pretty much it, I haven't been here in a while, but I hope that after my trip back from visiting family in Hawaii, i will maybe make a trip back here to wind back down from some jet lag, does anyone wanna join me? \n\nHappy Sweating! haha"

Needless to say it was an amazing experience. I read a few of the reviews on Yelp just to see what I should expect. Let me tell you, some of these reviews were completely off. I came in expecting a beat up place but I was wrong. I suppose the previous reviewers were over-exaggerating. The women's locker room was spotless and the jacuzzis were clean as well. The Herbal Steam Room was amazing. But make sure to bring in a small towel to breathe through once you're in there! The steam room next to it wasn't working, though. So that was quite disappointing. However, even if it was available I would prefer the herbal room over the regular one. \n\nThe second floor is co-ed. The uniforms that they provide are quite odd. I felt like a pink marshmallow in my outfit, but it was comfortable and clean. Make sure to try out every room on the second floor. The red clay room was my absolute favorite room. \n\nAs for the food, the sweet lady who cooked my meal really does have a talent for cooking! The beef ribs were a bit pricey but insanely delicious. Try out the strawberry-banana smoothie as well. \n\nOne more thing, if you wish to take a dip in the jacuzzis be warned that you have to go nude. They will tell you to get out and undress if you're wearing a swimsuit. I understand that not everyone is comfortable in their body (take myself for example) but no one will judge you or pay any attention to you if you take it all off. Just enjoy yourself and let it all hang out!"

This is great relaxing place without the extreme pricing of regular spas. \n\nI could not give it 5 stars because some of the showers were not working and I wish there was more monitoring of rules such as showering in between uses and no bathing suits. Some believe they are more clean by wearing a swim suit and that is false. Those are things I wish were more enforced like the spas in Korea. As well as photo taking in the dressing room. I noticed a few people nervous since others were taking selfies and didn't notice that others were in the background due to the mirrors. \n\n\n\nAgain I love korean spas and I enjoyed imperial and will return. I just wish there was a little more management throughout whole facility."

That's when we found Imperial Health Spa.\n\nI haven't really been to many Korean Spas but I felt really comfortable here. Upon entering the female section, there are lockers to place your shoes and belongings; the lockers were pretty big so I was able to fit my duffel bag and backpack in there. The spa gives you pajamas and two towels to use; they only give slippers to people receiving massages (or so I've heard). \n\nThe shower area was kind of small, maybe only 6-7 heads however there were multiple stations where you could scrub yourself down. Shampoo, body wash and conditioner is located next to each shower head. BTW, this is a communal showering area, YOU HAVE TO BE NAKED TO ENTER.\n\nInside the bathing area, there were two jacuzzis, a small one and a larger one. There was also a steam room and sauna. Outside the bathing room, there's a red clay room where you can go relax as well. \n\nThe second level is where the food facilities are as well as ALL the other sauna rooms. Being that i was in a hurry, I didn't get to check all the other different rooms. The food was ok, a bit overpriced.\n\nAll in all, if I ever needed a shower in a hurry or if I would just like to sweat out my toxins in multiple sauna rooms, I would come here. The facility is really clean and the workers are nice."

Sorry, standard everywhere is one hour, so I found that to be ridiculous.\n\nOther than that, Imperial is pretty choice, despite it in being in the 'hood of Vegas. \n\n$20 to enter and use their facility. Bring your own flip flops if you can because they often run out. \nPlease take off your shoes before you enter the locker room area! Change into your slippers or go barefoot, and YOU MUST TAKE A SHOWER BEFORE ENTERING THE FACILITIES. Come on people! It's plastered all over the walls. \n\nIn the female only area: Whirlpools ( 1 hot, 1 warm, 1 cold soak), dry sauna, steam room and herbal steam room. GET NAKED. Don't be a weirdo and wear a bikini because really, nobody is there to check you out. And all of us ladies there have seen boobies and vaginas before so don't be shy. We really don't care about yours. No really, I don't care. \nThey also provide toothbrushes, toothpaste and razors. So nice! In the locker room there is also gel, mousse, lotion, cotton swabs, tissue, hair dryers AND a curling iron. Very handy if you're going out and about afterward. There are a few reclining chairs to relax in and watch tv in the locker room, so feel free to bring a facial sheet mask to slap on when you're done. I saw quite a few ladies doing that.\n\nCommunal area had lots of rooms. Really enjoyed how spacious the communal area was. It has 2 sides of reclining chairs and tvs. \n\nFood option there was a bit pricier than all the other jjimjilbangs I've been to. I didn't bother to try any, but it smelled good. \n\nFairly clean, and I did see a woman constantly cleaning. This spot used to be open 24 hours.. I wish it still was."

I ended up using my street shoes because I was so disgusted. The showers don't work, and they expect you to keep the same dirty wet towel your entire stay. They didn't give me a tour or tell me about anything, very unprofessional. I've had many deep tissues and have never felt so much pain. I asked again and again for lighter pressure and nothing, my masseuse barely spoke English. Overall I am more stressed from going then relaxed!"

There's also this room I call the pizza ovens. You lay in them and it's quiet and comfy. The clay ball room is a little weird. I've almost died a few times slipping on those, but they feel pretty good. \n\nProTip: don't go immediately when they open. It's takes a bit for hot rooms to get up to temp."

My sister felt a bit uneasy with it at first, but she agreed to get a massage while I did the go at your own pace stuff.\n\nThere is a separate entrance for men and women.  They give you two towels and a \"gym outfit\" which is basically the most unflattering thing ever.  It's a hospital scrub-like top and then these stretchy linen shorts.  Then you also get a key to a locker. \n\nThe locker room/lounge was very nice.  They had comfy chairs and several women were there napping or just watching tv.  They had a lot of amenities, including disposable razors, individually wrapped toothbrushes, hair products, etc.  It felt like they had put a lot of thought into what to make available.  Right off the lounge is the entrance for the upstairs area for both men and women, which I will get to.  There was also a dry salt sauna.  When you enter the glass door there, you enter the main spa area.  Immediately upon entering, there is a dry suana ahead and showers to your right (you have to shower before going in anywhere and anytime after you get out of a sauna).  To the left there is a warm tub with jets, a hot tub, a cold water tub, a salt steam sauna and a eucalyptus sauna.  Pro tip: if you are new to one of the \"wet\" saunas, sit on the bottom step.  It will not be as hot since the steam rises.  Also, breathe through your mouth and not your nose and just stay in for a couple minutes.  There was also a section of little showers where you could sit on a stool close to the ground.\n\nThe upstairs area was nice, but I hated having to wear my gym outfit.  The rooms were hot and I didn't feel like adding polyester blend to the mix was relaxing.  Also, they have signs posted, but let me just tell you: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU STEP INTO THE CLAY BALL SECTION.  I don't know why, but I thought the signs meant \"be careful when you step in the room\" as opposed to \"be careful when you step on the heaping pile of clay balls.\"  Yeah, I'm an idiot.  Anyway, I fell and woke up a very nice Asian man who asked me if I was ok.  I was, but I decided to beeline out of there and decided that the ice room would be the best option.  It's basically like a walk in freezer that you sit in, though it wasn't quite as cold as a freezer.  I got to talking with someone in the ice room and completely forgot that I had left my sister and her massage had ended 45 minutes earlier.  I was so worried that she would be mad at me, but when I looked for her, I found her completely naked, in the cold tub, talking gingerly with another woman.  I honestly don't know what it is about this place, but it was very freeing to be able to walk around with no clothes on and my sister ended up loving it, even though she was initially scared to be naked.  She said her massage was incredible, as well.\n\nHonestly, this was the highlight of my trip to Vegas.  If you are thinking of coming here, please do.  It can be intimidating at first, but it was so, so nice and relaxing and freeing.  I've added this to my must do list when I come back in town."

(If that's what you want, you're better off collecting those hooker cards. I hear some of those chicks are running $35 specials!) \n\nI missed out on the Onsen experience in Japan, so I heard about Imperial Health Spa and decided to at least get something similar. It was worth it. Thanks Yelp!\n\nUnfortunately traveling chica didn't want to come out here. Sharing bathwater and getting nekkid in Vegas just wasn't her thing! (Whether or not that's my thing will stay in Vegas!)\n\nBut hey -- I went in the morning around 8:30am and there were only a handful of people here, and most were in the co-ed area. The entire 1 1/2 hr I was there, I only saw 1 person in the nekkid area, aside from the staff who was walking back and forth carrying the laundry. \n\nJust like in Japan, they have the rows of wash stations lined up in a row, each station supplied with a hand-held shower and shampoo, conditioner, and bath gel dispensers. \n\nAfter your bath, you can choose to soak in the pools. There are 3 types: the cool one, the warm one, and the hot one, which is a jacuzzi. I didn't feel like the cool one, so I sat in the warm and hot ones. Ironically, the \"hot\" was only warm, so it was weird sitting in a warm jacuzzi. The \"warm\" (which was really the hottest) was nice and relaxing and there was a TV beside it so you could occupy your time while relaxing. I stayed in this one the longest. Aaahh....\n\nThere were also massage rooms and a dry and wet sauna in the females only area. \n\nI decided to go to the co-ed area since it was covered in my fee (they provide some pajamas to wear in that area). They have more hot rooms. One was simply a big room to sit in, another contained little cave-like areas for each person to rest in (kind of reminded me of a dog house, Lol), and the best ones (there were two like this) had boxes that contained rocks that you lay down on. Soooo relaxing! Two types of rocks -- smooth and rocky (har har). I preferred the smooth type. \n\nI wish there were Korean spas in the South. Or Japanese spas. Or just something similar. There is a place by my house that says Tokyo Health Spa, but alas, it was just a massage parlor. And it isn't even run by Japanese. Not such a happy ending for me Lol. \n\nBut any day relaxing day spent at Imperial Health Spa is a happy ending, in my opinion. The spa is located far from the strip, so get a car and head north. It's worth it!"

I had booked a massage for myself and my husband and they asked if we would like to make it a couples massage for no extra charge.  How cool is that??  We got to be in the same room and candles were lit (oooh la la).  We paid $180 for two swedish massages for 60 minutes.  My technician was Angela and my husband's technician was T.K. I think.  The lights were dimmed and there was soft elevator-type music playing in the background.  I have nothing to compare this to since it was my first massage but I enjoyed it. \n.\n We were given shorts and a shirt to change into and then the technicians took us upstairs for the massage.  I think their clothing is asian sizing because they gave me a 4XL and it was sooooo tight.  I'm 5'2\" and 230 pounds and those shorts were screamin....I was afraid to sit for fear I would rip them.  If you're a big gal like me you might want to bring your own clothing for the co-ed areas. Definitely bring your own flippy-floppies or you can rent a pair of theirs.  \n. \nAny service over $80 comes with admission to the rest of the building so after our massage we explored the upstairs rooms.  My favorite was the red clay ball room which is basically just grown-up versions of ball pits like they used to have at mickey d's and burger king.  The balls are warm and they envelop every part of your body and it feels *amazing*.  We also tried the cold room which is like a walk-in cooler and the red clay room which is HOT and dry.  \n. \nAfter that we went down into the spa area and I was super nervous about the nudity.  There are signs everywhere saying \"no bathing suits allowed\" but still there were three women in there wearing them so that made me even MORE nervous to get into my birthday suit.  Finally I just said screw it and stripped down.  Soon after those three ladies ripped off their bathing suits so I think I inspired them LOL \n. \nThe downstairs had a bubbling hot tub, a FREAKIN HOT tub with no bubbles, a cold pool, sit-down jimjilbang showers, a steam room, stand up showers, a dry salt sauna, a regular dry sauna, and a salt steam sauna which was out of order.  The facilities are clean and well-maintained.  \n. \nI really enjoyed the experience.  I was so apprehensive about being nude but once I got there it all faded away.  There is a groupon right now which makes it $15 I think for a day pass so definitely take advantage of that while you can."

Instead of partying it up, the hubby and I just enjoyed a weekend of great food and relaxation.\n\nWe love going to k-spas back home, so we were thrilled to find one in Vegas as well. The spa is a nice size and has all of my favorite amenities including the clay ball/salt room. I love being able to lie down in the salt and over myself up with salt crystals to draw out my sweat and toxins. It leaves me feeling rejuvenated.\n\nAs with all great k-spas, this one also had a little restaurant that served chicken wings and shaved ice. The prices are a little steep considering the fact that the spa is a little outdated, but not a bad find!"

Hot tubs, Hotter tubs, steam rooms, salt rooms, all the rooms upstairs, cold room, relaxation rooms. You can stay forever. You won't find a better price/minute value at any other spa. It is a little \"ghetto fabulous\" though. Don't expect the extra frills you would get at other spas and I make sure to wear my slippers EVERYWHERE, but for the price, it is fantastic\n\nFor spa treatments:\nPrice is a little higher than it should be for the services. The scrubs are crazy effective. You will literally have a new body at the end, but the technicians are less than debonair. Usually showing up in a bra and panties set (sometimes see-through) to pick you up for the service, do not expect modesty. Be prepared to expose all for every nook and cranny to get scrubbed down. There is a massage after the scrub but it is on the same uncomfortable flat bed with a plastic sheet on it that the scrub is done on. Again, no frills here, but it is an effective service."

I didn't take my panties off because of the P factor... the incorrigible red sea virus.... the menstruation monster... the bloody- okay I'm done now.  I loved.. LOVED, the boob massage.  They should open up nonsexual massage rooms where they only focus on areas where the professionals lawfully avoid. Or is that what Thai massages are about?? Is there more than one way of getting a happy ending?\n\nI was going to knock off a star for the food I didn't eat that I ordered from the cafe.  Their kimchi fried rice and kalbi needed salt... or ANYTHING. A rock would have tasted better.  But I'm reminded of the times when I look at my boyfriend and I think to myself, \"I can do better!\" But it really depends on the state of mind I was in when I had looked at him. So I won't knock off a star for the food. Maybe the food sucked in relation to the boob massage. Maybe the boob massage triggered the nerves that inhibited my taste buds.  Maybe I'm just generous.  Maybe I really did like the food and I forgot. \n\nThe end."

Today I wanted to go there and I noticed that the prices have gone way up but still decided to buy a two person pass, use one today and save one for next time. So the horrible old woman working in the front had the nerve to deny me access cuz my groupon was for two people and I was alone. So she argued with me she couldn't let me credit the groupon fir next visit and told me simply to call groupon and cancel my transaction. HORRIBLE customer service. Never going back again. VERY BAD ENERGY FROM HER!!!!!! I spoke to a lady that was walking out of the spa and she couldn't believe how nasty the woman behind the desk was and she said she's not returning either.

For those of you who can put away your western inhibitions and don't mind being in the buff around total strangers who you will probably never see again, this is a wonderful experience.  I did see a couple of patrons in bikinis this trip.  They have updated their facilities a bit and have added to their menu of services, but I still fall back to the original which includes a full body scrub (I do mean full body and I do mean SCRUB) followed by a relaxing massage, cucumber facial, and hair wash/condition.  $90.  This includes the use of the facilities.  \n\nUpon arrival you will be issued a small towel, large towel, and short/shirt set which is required in the coed area upstairs.  Entering the locker room, you must first remove your shoes and place them in one of the lockers that don't lock.  Then proceed to the locker area for which you were given a locker key upon check-in.  \n\nFirst shower then put on your short/shirt and go upstairs to experience the sauna rooms: jade, clay, clay ball.  I prefer the clay ball.  Know this: the floors in the sauna rooms are hot!  Also upstairs is a food service counter and lounge chairs where you can watch Korean TV.  Back downstairs in the ladies locker room is a dry salt sauna with mats on the floor - my favorite.  \n\nStrip down and enter the wet area.  Another shower with wonderful coconut bath gel, shampoo, and conditioner followed by a sweat in either of the two saunas (salt or herbal), a quick rinse off shower and into the warm tub.  The cold tub is frigid and the hot tub is truly over the top hot.  They also have the traditional Korean bath house setup where you sit to bathe.  Try to spend about 30 minutes in the wet treatments before your therapist calls your number at which time you'll be escorted to the private treatment room.  Again, the scrub is a must and the massage, facial, and hair treatments are nice accompaniments.  Emily is a wonderful therapist.\n\nThey provide toothbrushes, toothpaste, hair gel, hairspray, dryers, and curling irons."

Imperial Health Spa is a Korean spa located off the strip - about a $20 cab ride. The facility has the standard amenities: steam/dry saunas, hot/warm/cold pools, showers, etc. There are separate floors for men and women, and a common floor for both to meet to relax and enjoy some coffee or food. \n\nThis was my second visit and I got the La Belle package: scrub, massage, facial, and hair wash for $215, gratuity not included. The scrub is a little rough but that's kind of the point; by the time she was done my skin felt soft and new! The massage was relaxing, the facial refreshing, and the hair wash pretty standard. \n\nThey have a variety of services and and you have full access to the facilities whole you wait for your treatment.

We couldn't see it from Maryland, or Sahara, so getting there was a little challenging.  \nI didn't know what to expect, but this place is very clean, and looks great on the inside.  \nThere is a lot of nudity in the women's section, but that doesn't really bother me.  Some people wear bikinis, some people don't bother.  I don't see the benefit of being fully nude, but I guess it's good to have options.\nI was bummed that there was no salt in the dry salt sauna, or the wet salt sauna.  I was really looking forward to that.  Also, the wet herbal sauna didn't seem...herbal, and both wet saunas were insanely hot.  Wet saunas are kind of our thing, and it was a little irritating that they were both so hot that we were unable to use them.  The benches in there were hot enough to scald your butt. No wonder they were both empty. \nThe upstairs area has lots of comfortable chairs, couches, and a tv with Korean programming. Unfortunately, the tv that people are watching in the lounge area can be heard in most of the relaxation rooms. Some soothing music probably would have been nicer.  \nThe relaxation rooms upstairs are really nice.  The red clay ball pits were amazing.  There was also a red clay room with little cave-like structures you could lay inside.  That room was probably the quietest.\nThere is a cafe, but we decided to skip it.  $10 for soup seems a little steep.  We were hoping for something smaller to snack on, but didn't really see anything.\nAfter showering on our way out we realized that there were no hair dryers.  Not such a great surprise when it's cold out. \n Oh well, we'll just have to bring our own next time.  Hopefully the salt, and sauna temperature issues will be worked out by then.\n\nOverall, the experience was definitely worth it.  My mom, and I were both very relaxed when we were done.  We ended up spending 3 hours here, but would have stayed even longer if the wet saunas were usable."

Unlike my fellow Koreans, I'm not a big fan of the whole 'let's get naked and have a scrub down after sweating like a hog'. But there was a Groupon that was offered not too long ago - admission for 2 for $20. My mom says that a single admission is around $20. That being said, she immediately bought 6 Groupon vouchers.   \n\nImperial Spa made me a believer! I've been to \"the best\" Korean health spas but this place definitely takes the cake! Couple reasons why - this place isn't swarming with people (at least when I went on a weekday evening) and the hot rooms as well as the locker rooms are super duper squeaky clean. \n\nThe building itself is hidden away around Sahara and Maryland. The physical address states Sahara Avenue but you won't find the building driving up or down it.  I had to drive into a small hidden street (or perhaps it was an entrance into a huge lot - I couldn't tell. It was dark!) in order to get to get there. Don't let the area fool you. When you walk in, you'll forget that you're in the backstreets of Sahara and Maryland!\n\nUpon walking through the entrance doors, you'll find yourself in a large lobby area with a service desk in the middle. There's a greeter in the front. She was a cute older lady with a big smile on her face. In exchange for my Groupon voucher, she handed my mom and me 3 towels (small, medium and large), t-shirt and shorts as well our locker keys. Apparently you have to ask for slippers, or else they won't give them to you. There's also a basket full of razors and toothbrushes, complimentary of the spa. \n\nThe entrance way to the locker rooms are located in the lobby. Walking into the locker room I found myself staring at a wall of tiny locker cubbies. Confused, I told my mom that my stuff didn't have a chance of fitting in those. My mom laughed and stated that those cubbies were for our shoes. Whoa! Separate lockers for our shoes. What a fantastic and thoughtful touch! Our actual lockers are located behind the shoe lockers and they were much bigger in size. \n\nThe locker room is very big, very clean, and very awesome. There are four leather recliner chairs that you can rest in. Around the chairs are countertops with mirrors stocked with q-tips, lotion, hair mousse, hair dryers and hair brushes (these are in sanitizer). At the other end of the lockers is the Salt Room. This is a heated room with marble flooring in which you can lay down and sweat. This particular room is for women only so don't get too frightened when you see naked women walking around! The shower room is also located adjacent to the locker room. Shower room contains the steam and dry sauna, hot tubs and multiple showers equipped with shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. \n\nThe second floor is the co-ed area. There's a large area with rows of black leather recliners. You can also find massage recliner chairs as well. Hungry much? The Imperial Spa Restaurant offers an array of Korean dishes as well as drinks. I think it's a little pricey compared to what you'd find at Korean restaurants around town. \n\nAround the large resting/restaurant area are additional heated rooms. There's a clay room - pits made for two people are filled with small clay balls. Lying in this really relieved a lot of tension in my back and shoulders. I thought this room was the hottest out of all of their rooms. There's also another room that contains what looks like clay ovens. One person can lay down within these clay domes and sweat it out. In addition, there's also the Jade Room where the floor and walls are all marble. The ceiling is coated with clay. There's an aroma that fills the air that really calmed me. I think this was my favorite out of all the heated rooms. \n\nI left Imperial Spa feeling rejuvenated. My skin was soft as a baby's bottom. I felt like I was glowing. Thanks, mom - you were right."

There was a young man cleaning the wet areas the whole time we were there. \n\nMuch like other Korean spas I've been to, I was greeted by a shoe locker area, before entering the locker room.  The clothes lockers have the weird little magnetic/electronic keys on plastic bands that looked like hair bands from the 80s.  \nThe men's locker room is huge.  On the left and right are lockers.  In the middle of the room  are 4 black leather  easy chairs and behind them, two red lounge type chairs.  A flat screen TV is across from these chairs.  (It was tuned to a basketball game.)\n\nAlong the walls are long counters with brushes and cotton swabs.  I'm used to seeing more grooming products than what they had out. (I only saw some lotion and nasty hair gel.)\n\nOutside of the glass doors to the wet areas, there is a shelf with smaller and larger towels.  Immediately inside the glass doors is another shelf with towels, to your right.  To your left is a shelf with toothrushes, wash cloths, and razors.  The stand up showers are directly in front of you.  To the right of the shower areas is a flat screen TV.  (Tuned to a Korean talk show.)  There is a privacy screen by two of the showers to the right.  The remaining showers are open.  (It took me a while to figure out the showers.  You adjust temperature on the left dial.  There is no right dial and then you push the \"button\" in the middle for the water to turn on.   Think push button sink faucets, just you get to adjust the temperature on these.  I realize they have drought restrictions, so this was a clever idea, but strange to those of us who have never encountered that before.)  \n\nTo the left of the shower area is a huge hot tub with the jets going.  It is much deeper than you would initially expect, but a comfortable temperature and the jets are perfect for helping relax a tight bath.  \n\nin the next room over, there are rows of sit-down (Asian-style showers).  They have glass dividers between them.  On a table near these showers is a large bucket of salt.  it is for the salt sauna.  \n\nAcross from the sit-down showers, there is a large cold pool.  It is deep, too, but not as cold as some places I've attended.  \n\nBeyond the sit-down showers there is a body scrub area, sectioned off by a privacy screen.  To the left of the body scrub area there is the salt steam sauna, an herbal steam sauna and the dry sauna.   I didn't enter the dry sauna. \n\nAfter showering, I salted myself up and entered the salt sauna.  it was quite nice.  The heat and the steam made the salt melt and all my toxins left with it.  I ended up rinsing off and then moving to the herbal sauna.  This room was at a much higher temperature. It hurt to breathe in there, so I left it.  The salt did make my skin smoother.  \n\nThere is a room off to the side of the cold plunge.  I saw a young man go in there and he described his body scrub when he came out.  I think the term he used was \"thorough.\"   That is my kind of body scrub!  \n\nGoing back out to the locker room, there is a resting room (in the dark) amidst one bank of lockers.  There  is a bathroom across from the stairs leading to the 2nd floor and the co-ed areas.  At the entrance of the stairs, there is a salt cave.  It is a large room with salt bricks along the walls and ceiling.  There are mats on the floor and head rests.  I stayed in there for about 10 minutes and was sweating by the end.  It didn't seem that hot, but it got me sweating.  I liked that room, quite a bit.  \n\nWhen we entered, we were given \"spa clothes\"  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to go upstairs to the 2nd floor because my spa clothes were too  small for me.  Next time, I'll bring my own shorts and tshirt, so that I can go see what else this place has to offer.  \n\nI didn't get a massage, though I doubt I would ever get one here, since I pay about half for the same kind of massage where I live.  I might pop for a body scrub, though.  :)"

Since I have been to one like it before I already kind of know how it works. Im a fan of asian bathhouses. what i did not like however was the unprofessionalism on how the employees in the locker room areas don't attend to replenishing towels fast enough, especially since it was considerablly not even busy. Authentic korean bath houses usually over more services of a more wholistic nature.\n\nthe food was great felt like i was at my grandmas house real quick. service was chill food was good ordered the dumplings (potstickers) came with some delish ginger side garnish with jalepeno's\n\nginger tea and the carrot/apple juice.\n\n\nAs far as a get by regular wind down, becoming a general admission regular isn't far from reality in my opinion.\n\n\nAlthough for my husband I will say his experience was great thanks to me being an awesome massage helper. but the lude behavior in the locker area at night before close was just disgusting. and honestly more things should be done about that. guys of both sexual orientations should feel comfortable coming to relax, especially if they are paying entry.\nIt should not be tolerated for men to do some of the disgusting things I heard from his traumatizing experience on that last-minute shower before check out..\nI understand you can't control someone elses eyes, but masterbating right next to someone while they are trying to shower is just ridiculous and he even said they were roaming around doing it, the sauna, the hottub, and lounge area by hot tub and  I can see why guys don't accompany their wives to great experiences like this. its ridiculous and we can look past one person, but a whole shower area full of masterbating men? that made us very angry upon leaving..\n\n\n\nnone the less it didnt ruin the night, but in comparison to the one ive been to in atlanta, this one is alot less organized, smaller, alot less \"sauna\" room variations... and no locker security, or attendees. There should be something to regulate that. I want my husband to enjoy wellness too without getting an eyeful of MULTIPLE fellow clients pulling the rabbit out the hat..\n--girl at front was not polite upon closing.\naddressed \"we're closed....get out!\"\n\nTIP BRING YOUR OWN SANDALS the floors are hot and when you go in the sauna with the balls enter with caution balls are slippery if you step in fast you can fall pretty bad...\n\nSTILL ON A MISSION FOR A 24 HR KOREAN BATH HOUSE LIKE THE ONE I HAD HOME IN ATLANTA!! now that i live here please imperial get it TOGETHER!!!"

Their wasn't any music in the background and another thing is that when the scrub was over I thought I would be in a different room finishing off the massage part of it. I was wrong . She threw water on the bed where she had just gave me a scrub and she asked me to lay their for my massage . I was very cold and not relaxed at all. \n\n\nI was happy with how she did the scrub but it isn't set up very well. I feel that the price would not have been a problem of the end massage was a calm relaxing experience. But it wasn't."

Its up to you, but dont skip this spa, if you think you have to wear your birthday suit, because you don't. You are allowed to wear a swim suit.\nI take my daughter with me and we have a great time relaxing together.

Imperial Health Spa was recommended to me by several female friends and after some research on Yelp, I felt it was an legitimate spa and made an appointment.\n\nThe spa layout is pretty simple unless you're gender-confused.  It is located in a two story building and divided into three areas; the top floor is the co-ed area and the bottom is segregated by gender. \n\nBefore I go any further, I must warn you...  DO NOT go if you are not comfortable with same-sex full frontal nudity.  There will be naked people there and they will walk as if they are strolling in the park.  If you have a hang up about being naked, don't go, because if I catch you checking out my junk, I'm gonna kick your butt--and two naked dudes fighting in a spa is the last thing ANYONE wants to see.\n\nWhen you arrive, you will be checked in by the receptionist, it costs $15 for locals and $20 for non-locals to use the facilities (Mani, Pedi, Facial, Massages, Exfols services are also available at extra cost).  You will be given a set of shorts,  hospital scrubs, 2 towels and a key.  The key is for your locker, the rest, hopefully, are self explanatory.\n\nWhen you walk into the changing area, there will be mini-lockers, those mini-lockers are for your shoes.  You are now faced with a couple of decisions, put your shoes in the mini shoe locker or your key locker; and use the slippers in the mini shoe locker or go bare foot.  You're an adult, figure it out.\n\nThere will be lockers and the number on your key will correspond to the locker.  Get out of your street clothes,  wrap a towel around yourself, hit the showers.  In the segregated area, there will be:\n\nStand-up Showers\nSit-down Asian Showers\nHot Tub\nCool Tub\nSalt Steam Room\nHerbal Steam Room\nDry Sauna\nSalt Hot Sauna\n\nPLEASE SHOWER AFTER YOU VISIT EACH AREA... shower/hot tub/shower/steam room/shower/cave/shower/sauna... and any combination thereof, just shower after each \"area.\"\n\nThe upstairs is the co-ed area, it consists of a general lounge area with big comfy lazy-boy chairs where you can watch TV and a mini-restaurant that serves basic Korean/Asian food as well as some boba/smoothie drinks.  Upstairs specialty rooms are as follows:\n\nSalt Brick Room - A hot room with salt bricks\nRed Clay Ball Sauna - Think kitty litter, for humans, without the poo.\nJade Sauna - Not sure what this room was for and didn't bother to read the sign, just remember it being hot\nRed Clay Room- It's a red clay igloo... also hot.\nCold Room - Basically a walk in freezer\nMini Gym - I don't exercise, so I avoided this room.  I think there were treadmills and stationary bikes.\n\nI got the combo package of \"Pure Heaven\" which consisted of a Body Scrub, Swedish Massage and Fresh Grated Cucumber Mask (70 minutes, $130).  The scrub was great, left my skin baby soft.  The cucumber mask made me hungry.  The massage was okay.  \n\nI took one star away for the fact that I didn't have a choice of getting a female therapist... becuase I got the body scrub, the entire package had to be done by a middle-age Korean man.  I was told that if I wanted a female therapist, I should have separated out the massage and body rub; wherein the exfoliation would be done by a man and the massage portion, a woman.  Fine, next time I know.\n\nI did enjoy the Tofu soup at the restaurant ($9.00)... which was prepared by a woman.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty good experience, relaxing after having to deal with my crazy mother."

Clearly they are in severe financial trouble based on the cuts in maintenance, cleanliness and staffing. You often are trapped there when it is time to leave after showering off due to no towels available. Also, they recently turned the peaceful salt sauna into a prison yard with bright lights (like a stadium) and make you change in and out of the ratty old uniforms they give you. Additional, the cold plunge pool is often at room temperature and the second sauna is off. Hardly a place to relax. I had recommended this place to several friends who visit Vegas as a no-frills \"Korean\" style spa at a reasonable price. Now I feel bad and will tell them to stay away and let all of their friends know as well."

Upstairs is coed... that's where most of the rooms are, as well as many lounge chairs to relax. Also, there is a mini restaurant upstairs. They will provide you with unflattering shorts and a shirt to use upstairs.

(Don't read into that). OMGosh! Sign me up!!  This place did not disappoint. But it's not a \"spa\" in the American way of thinking. It's a bathouse--very different. So research before you go--- After my scrubbing, she massaged my skin with oil, and a cool yogurt cream, and finally washed my hair. Good gosh. Best 3 hours, I've spent in a while. Check out the co-ed areas...where you can rest and take a nap if you feel like it. Best part---It is very very clean!! Cost about $100 bucks and then $20 for tip. I'll def be back."

            "review": "Wow, probably the best Korean spa I've been to...I haven't been to too many though..I've only gone to a few in LA...but the place was really clean and it was fairly large. Not as large as I imagined it was going to be...but large enough, I guess. There were plush lounge chairs and TVs in the common area. And, yes, all Korean shows. But  you can watch American movies in the theater. You get to choose a movie from their selection. Only thing is if someone else gets there first, you're stuck watching whatever they're watching. Food is VERY overpriced. But I guess it's expected at a spa. I like the fact that it has a cardio room. So I ran first, then relaxed in the different sauna rooms and then took a shower and went back to the strip.\n\nTheir website is misleading though. There was no ice room, or half dunk tub or whatever. All they had was two red clay rooms and a salt sauna in the common area, and the usual steam room and dry room downstairs, in the tub and shower area. \n\nCool place...don't know how long it'll last though. It was empty when I went last Friday..."

Sheesh.. all I wanted was a tour and with lack of sandals provided I quickly chose to leave the souvenirs behind and go back to cover my assets while trying to explain \"all I want is a tour not to stand here in front of you to watch me take a shower and someones athletes foot fungi!\"\n\nWait, it gets even better...\n\nDid a nice steam and and herbal room as prep for my Shiatsu massage. Little did I know it was going to take a lot more than that to make it!\n\nMassage I received was FAR from \"Spa\" quality or even professional for that matter.\n\nFirst therapist introduces them self in spa area and is nice.\n\nGiving and receiving countless massages I know the good from the bad and this so called therapist clearly didn't have a clue and started on my neck digging in thumb not even coming close to equalizing with opposing fingers. \n\nI can tell already.... this is only a test...\n\nAfter a bit of torture I asked therapist why only using one hand instead of both and said \"I don't know how to do that type of massage, I get other therapist.\" Tried to even show basic Shiatsu technique but was totally against it and says learned only to use one hand. hmmm...\n\nThen said \"let me tell receptionist\" and another therapist arrived several minutes later. \n\nThe second therapist was the tour person.\n\nAfter lying there listening to them rant but not understanding a word the massage finally gets started. WOO HOO!!!\n\nDon't get too excited now because after only a few minutes...\n\nRINGGGGG RINGGGGG.........\n\nLooks like the tour person has a call on cell phone... stops massage answers and talks for quite awhile... sheesh\n\nIt gets worse...\n\nTherapist finally back to my scheduled massage and you could tell by technique they didn't have honed massage skills or oral hygiene skills as it smelt nasty as they breathed on me. \n\nSo to try and be optimistic on this train wreck and salvage what I could of the massage....\n\n\"Don't\" massage ON the spine but next to it... \n\nColon massage is \"clockwise\" to release. they say OK and continues counter clockwise till I stop him again, then he continues wrong way again and I say, \"lets just skip the stomach today\".\n\nNo, your fingernails in my eye sockets is not pleasurable. ughhh\n\nAdd to that first therapist comes back... knocks on door... massage stops.... towel delivery and heated word exchange. This keeps going on for a total of SIX interruptions over the one hour session starting from phone call! \n\nFinally damage is done and the so called \"massage\" is finished and therapist says \"lay here relax take your time\". \n\nA few well earned peaceful moments elapse as I start to feel like I've survived the most challenging massage experience of a lifetime.\n\nTAP TAP TAP on shoulder... \n\"Heloooo? \nYou lay here relax take your time\". \n\nOMG! At this point i am now honestly feeling this has to be a Candid Camera, Boiling Point or comedy show and just shake my head and laugh at life's always amazing mysteries and manifestations.\n\nDefinitely a first for me...\n\n*and hopefully the last and hope to return to share improvements.\n\nPS: Bring some earplugs if you don't care for Korean News or Game shows blasting loudly on the TV's or happen to hit the power switch when you walk by. \n\nSome sunglasses might also serve you quite well in the brightly lit sauna area. \n\n*Please give the Imperial Health Spa Manager \"Rick\" some feedback for improvements as I would really like to see this place make it."

Was impressed w cleanliness and friendly staff. My personal couple tips would be:\n\n1) Try applying salt before going into sauna room (NOT on forehead!! As salt melts in heat it drips down and causes eye irritation. From personal experience! See I was overly excited and put salt all over including my forehead. Had to walk out blind to wash my face) In sauna room, gently rub the melting salt on your body. When done, wash off with cool shower. Your skin will feel so smooth! :)\n\n2) Keep hydrating yourself. There are plenty of cups and cold water throughout the facility. \n\nI am definitely going back to relax and hang out w my friends^^"

            "review": "- EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAN\n- Great construction throughout building (especially saunas)\n- Great way to relax\n- Mediocre massages\n- Ethnically non-diverse\n- LOTS OF NAKEDNESS \n\nMy girlfriend and I wanted to destress a bit on our recent visit to Vegas.  Normally, we don't have a car while there, but given the last-minute status of our trip, we ended up driving in from San Diego.\n\nAfter researching the prices at many of the spas at big strip hotels, being the cheap ass I am, I preferred to drive off the strip a bit and pay 50% less for more services.  \n\nWe arrived at Imperial Heath Spa without an appointment, and were able to book a couple of hot stone massages for about 3 hours from our arrival.  This was perfect timing, allowing us to spend several hours soaking, showering, sauna'ing, and generally relaxing.  \n\nMake no mistake:  when you walk into the gender-segregated locker rooms, you'll be immediately accosted by a WHOLE LOTTA NAKEDNESS.  And there's a good reason I use the word nakedness as opposed to nudity.  \n\n1. Nudity seems too soft and appealing\n2. Nudity insinuates being stationary\n3. Nudity reminds me of good times in my life\n\nNAKEDNESS, on the other hand, is all about being butt-ass naked while doing other things.  And that's what goes on here...a bunch of naked dudes walking around naked while doing any number of things:  grooming, showering, watching Korean soap operas, doing body scrubbing with salts, hot tubbing and much more.  \n\nSo if you're sensitive to this type of commando-style productivity, you might opt out of this spa.\n\nThere aren't many bad things I could say about the facility itself:\n\n- Its immaculately clean in almost every area.  \n- The showers are very well kept (though they allow for ZERO privacy and are spaced very close together).  \n- The hot-tubs are clean and don't smell of over-chlorination (the hot tub is probably 115 degrees, the cold tub is probably 60 degrees).\n- The saunas are AWESOME.  The dry salt-sauna was my favorite of the bunch, as the walls are built completely out of salt bricks.  The Jade sauna upstairs was my second favorite for its hot floors and size.  The clay ball room was less cool than I expected, mostly due to 2 loud Korean children making it a playroom.\n\nWe decided to grab a small snack from the restaurant upstairs before our massage.  We ordered the tofu-soup (for $10!), and hoped for just a reasonably sized portion to split.  What came out was a magnificent cornucopia of foods to dip into the soup (or so we assumed).  The soup was excellent, as were all the sized, the rice, and everything about the snack.  $10 was absolutely a DEAL for the quality of the food received, and it fed 2 of us decently well.  Very clean, hearty food!\n\nThe hot-stone massage I received wasn't nearly as good as I hoped it would be.  The older Asian lady that gave me the massage lacked any semblance of tenderness, and turned a seemingly tranquil experience into a what felt like a worn out wooden rollercoaster ride.  The first stones she attempted to place in my hands were so hot that I had to drop them (and they left a welt on my hand for 24 hours).  Luckily, she understood what it meant when I tossed the stones and used cooler stones from then on.  Nothing else seems during the massage sticks out except the end, which I almost looked forward to.\n\nThe biggest negative of the entire experience, though, was the herd of unruly, seemingly undisciplined children on the co-ed second floor.  They went in and out of many of the sauna rooms, leaving doors open, loudly eating food and chatting without restriction.  \n\nMy overall takeaway from this Spa was very VERY positive.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm 95% sure I'll visit this place again for some relaxation."

It's been a nice oasis from the strip but this year my experience was very poor.  First, the facility was poorly maintained.  No water cups, towels and the dirt and grime was obvious.  You also now require a uniform to be worn in the salt room.  It is very uncomfortable to wear a uniform in that room.  Part of the Korean spa culture is the freedom to be naked.  also, if you are open until 11pm why do you stop letting people in at 9pm. The first njght I tried to go I arrived at 9:45pm and it was locked.  Why?  My guess is you are on a path of destruction for your business as there was no one else in the spa.  My suggestion is you take a trip to king spa in New York and copy their business model.  Going to 24 hours (at least one weekends) would be a home run and you guys would need wheelbarrows for your money.  I offer this email as help because I hope you can fix the problems and thrive in your business."

Unfortunately, no Korean spas exist (for guys at least) in Hawai'i.\n\nSo I did my yelp research and located a highly rated Korean spa in Las Vegas.  A perfect getaway from the heat and to recover from a previous night's debauchery.  \n\nI made my way via taxi, however for some reason the taxi driver could not locate the building.  After calling the receptionist, she clarified the location as across the street from the Bank of America, but in a small lane behind the main buildings on E. Sahara.\n\nThe receptionist was pleasant and checked me in for my 30 minute Korean-style scrub and 60 minute Acu-Massage.  I arrived about forty-five minutes early so I could soak in their Jacuzzi.  I was handed their \"uniform\" t-shirt and shorts, required for the coed areas and sleep rooms.  Otherwise, you're in the buff (get over it!).\n\nThe facilities were immaculate and nicely maintained.  The locker room/lounge area was very comfortable, despite its starkness.  The television here was tuned to Korean soap operas (addicting stuff).  The leather chairs were a nice touch and the counters were filled with amenities such as soaps, disposable razors and shaving cream.  I kept coming here for the filtered water in an attempt to battle the alcohol I ingested practically hours ago.\n\nI alternated between the steam and dry saunas to the Jacuzzi then the ice plunge that electrifies every nerve ending in your body as if it were on fire.  Love that feeling!  Reminds me of my road trip from Portland, Oregon to Anchorage, Alaska and skinny dipping in the glacier water as our daily shower.  Ah, better than caffeine.  \n\nI was called to my scrub in an adjoining room and the guy worked his magic, polishing my body down to a pulp and splashing buckets of warm water between applications.  A great feeling to emerge renewed!  From the scrub, I showered and immediately started my Acu-massage in a separate massage room, equipped with bars on the ceilings for the therapist to play their footsie magic on my back.  Man, what a glorious experience Acu-massage is!  Part deep tissue, part Thai.  60 minutes of bliss!  When done, I headed back to the Jacuzzi, dry sauna, steam room, ice plunge rotation for about another 30-45 minutes.  \n\nI did not try their coed section of other mineral and sleep rooms, but will defiantly try them if I ever return (and I hope to soon!)  Otherwise, I walked away a new man.  Ready to brave the sweltering summer heat and feeling lucky to tempt chance at the casinos.  An amazing start to my appointed spa day in Vegas.  An experience (and price) that does not exist on the Strip.\n\n#Yelp 365:  054/365"

I was so pleasantly surprised at how fantastic this place was! From the soothing red clay ball room to the gorgeous heated crystal and salt rooms to the herbal steam room to the ice room...it was just warm, beautiful and soothing throughout. I easily spent 5 hours there wandering from room to room with my friends soaking up the ambiance. \n\nThe dry saunas upstairs such as the red clay ballrooms, the salt room, etc are co-ed and fully clothed areas. The steam rooms,saunas and whirlpools are segregated and clothing optional. They have a hot, warm and cold whirlpool.\n\n\nAfter my friends left I gave myself a clay facial, hot oil hair treatment and body scrub in this body scrub area they have set aside where the whirlpools are and I was surprisingly comfortable being overweight and nude...that should tell you how nice this place is. :) the bathing area was very unique, with big bowls you place under spigots then pour over yourself. (Or,if you don't enjoy the pleasure of a rush of warm water over your head, they also have shower attachments)\n\nIt wasn't too crowded (we went at 7pm on a Tuesday) and the energy of the place was just welcoming and soothing...\n\nAbout half the women were nude and half were not,so you have to be pretty comfortable with nudity or get comfortable fast. If you consider going to Massage Envy going to a spa, this might not be for you. \n\nThey give you a hideous pink getup that looks like you escaped from Gay Guantanamo, lol, so be prepared for that. The shorts didn't really fit me...next time I will bring my own pink pair to wear with the shirt and just hope they don't notice. Also the bath towels are too small for a larger person to completely wrap around themselves, so I would suggest bringing your own towel if, like me, you have some junk in the trunk.  \n\nAlso, bring a towel with you into the red clay ball room...without one it is hard (and sometimes painful) to get up out of the ball pit...since as you get up your hands can sink past the balls to the super heated marble floor below. \n\nThey also give you a little facial towel, which I will bring with me next time from room to room to roll up under my neck.They have inflatable pillows,but they are a little too big.\n \nWe also ate at the little restaurant they had. both of my friends really enjoyed their soup, I opted for the spicy cold noodles...and while the flavor was delicious, I found the consistency of the noodles too difficult to eat. It was like trying to eat tiny bands of elastic...lol. I also tried the sweet rice drink,which I thought might be similar to horchata...but it was actually whole grain rice, sugar and water shaken up in a cup. It was not so good.I went back and ordered a strawberry kiwi smoothie which was delicious. \n\nI didn't get a chance to try out their reasonably priced massage chairs...maybe next time:)"

When you're walking into the locker rooms, you must take your shoes off and store them in the shoe lockers that are the same number as the number on your magnetic key. Then, you find your locker and store your stuff in there. The key can be kept around your wrist. In the locker room, there is a shower area, Jacuzzi, and saunas \n\nWhen you head upstairs, there are dry saunas, on of which is a bed of beads. I couldn't help but laugh as I tried to get in because it made so much noise. Literally every move you make, everyone in the room could hear. Imagine trying to get \"comfortable\" in a bed of bead, or rocks if you choose. So noisy. and some of the pebbles get stuck in your toes or clothes when you get out, so the go bouncing on the tile floor. Another room is just a dry sauna with mats in it. Perfect to stretch in to detox your body in different positions. I started sweating a lot in there. We went to another room, where you get your own space, like you're literally baking and sweating.  It felt good to sweat out all the toxins. Once we were done we went to the cold room to close our pores. \n\nAlthough this place is very far from where I live, i would go back.

It is a Korean style so they have a sex separated area where nudity is encouraged. I love that aspect of it. The only thing I wish they had was a hot tub for both sexes to go in so my love and I can share the experience. They are under new management and the customer service is much more friendly. I have gotten a deep tissue massage there and it was amazing! They have a lot of options to pick from, or you can just go and enjoy the spa. I loved it because I was able to study for my Real Estate License while being in the most relaxed and peaceful environment. The only reason it is not 5 is we are not allowed to bring our own food- which I understand why but I am a strict vegan and cannot consume anything they offer. They are hidden in the back of a parking lot so you cannot see them from the street. Do not be discouraged by the outside of the spa...it looks MUCH NICER on the inside. \n\nA GREAT PLACE FOR LOCALS AND VISITORS."

Regularly, it would cost $20 per entry but they also have a 12 for $120 deal going on. Upon walking in, you're given towels, an oversized tee and shorts, and a key with a designated locker number for your shoes and belongings. Be sure to ask for slippers if you didn't bring any. Also, there's a basket at the counter filled with razors and toothbrushes up for grabs. \n\nFirst floor is gender separated and nudity is strongly advised. There are hot, warm (with jets), and cold tubs. There's also a steam room, an herbal steam room, a hot dry sauna, and a salt sauna room that reminded me of the setup of a bikram yoga class. It was pretty hot in each of them but definitely tolerable. Be sure to use the sit down showers or stand up showers to rinse off after each use of an area before dipping into another.\n\nUp stairs is co-ed. There's a bunch of massage chairs in front of a tv and different rooms alongside a gym room. My favorite was the red ball clay room. I recommend bringing a towel to lay on because those balls were pretty hot. Also, proceed with caution since those tiny, unassuming balls are slippery. We also enjoyed the ice room and probably spent most of our time there. It was just like a huge freezer and probably the only room we felt like we could talk. What you do in the rooms for the most part though, is pretty simple: lay or sit down in silence.\n\nWe didn't get to try the food but they seemed to offer a variety of choices alongside coffees, smoothies, and teas. Prices for food averaged to $10 and up.\n\nIn all, for the price you pay to use all those facilities, it really is a bargain. If you want massages, scrubs, facials, or treatments, they offer those as well for additional fees. I was set out to have a relaxing time and that was what I got at the end of the day. I left feeling calm and rejuvenated-couldn't have asked for more."

            "review": "I've never been to a spa before. I'll do a quick review of the place itself first and then explain my experience for anyone who cares.\n\nAll I have to say is that I don't really understand the concept of a spa like this lol but it was still enjoyable.\n\nSo basically the place has different rooms to relax in with varying heat levels.\n\nIt's $20 for all day admission.\n\nIt's all about relaxing and distressing your body in a clean and calm area.\n\nThere is a restaurant, a few different Sauna rooms, place to watch tv, and even a place to exercise. There is a fully stocked hygiene type area with shampoo, lotion, and hair products, for getting ready. \n\nAside from those amenities you can get massages at an additional cost.\n\nOverall it's super clean. The staff is super nice. And the place is large. \n\n\nSo if you want a place to go to to just lounge around and relax for a few hours then I'd say to check this place out. \n\nOkay so here's how it works! I feel like saying this because I had no idea \"what to do here\" so hopefully this helps those first timers.\n\nThere are two floors. The bottom is gender specific and the upstairs is for both.\n\nAfter you pay you are given a wrist band. This is used to open your locker and also to charge your food or drinks since you pay when you leave.\n\nYou enter through a a male or female side, put your shoes away in the shoe locker, then you are at a locker room area. There are TV's and chairs to watch TV away from the women and is where you out your stuff. \n\nIn the men's side there are a bunch of showers. Sitting showers, standing, cold or hot. Then a big \"hot tub\" type pool and a cold one, and then 4 saunas. There's a dry sauna, two steam saunas, and another dry heat type sauna room. I don't dig saunas so I don't really have an opinion on these.\n\nOh yea! Everyone is basically nude down here so don't be bashful. I was a bit apprehensive at first but you really have to get over it to enjoy yourself.\n\nBasically the only time you HAVE TO be fully nude is to enter the pools. It's all about hygiene so you shower nude and then get in the poop nude. This was really actually one of the more relaxing things.\n\nCan't say much about the saunas.\n\nAnyways upstairs!\n\nThen upstairs you must wear the little outfit they provide which include shirt, shorts, and sandals.\n\nThere's two TV areas, a restaurant that also serves smoothies and teas, an exercise room, the private Massage rooms, a yoga area, and the \"saunas. \n\nThe restaurant seems expensive but hey if the food is good who cares. \n\nThe rooms are all different in what material they are made out of and how hot they are. I honestly hate being hot so my favorite parts weren't related to the saunas so much.\n\nThe stand out rooms were the ice room and the red clay room.\n\nThe red clay room has these small red clay balls that you lay in and also these clear rocks that you can lay in. I preferred the balls and this was our favorite room. The balls felt very therapeutic when you lay on them or stepped on them\n\nThe idea is to just lay there and relax but the whole process of getting into a pit with tiny clay balls is really loud.\n\nThe second favorite room for me was the ice room. It's a freezing cold room. My cup of tea for the hangover I was having.\n\nYou use these sauna rooms for 3-7 minutes, drink some water, and relax for 30 minutes and try out the other rooms. I'm not sure the purpose of each room but basically whatever floats your boat then go to the room!\n\nThat's basically it. Idk if I'd go again but it was cool to experience. Maybe if there were different explanations to the rooms and their therapeutic benefits then I'd have been more into it but sitting in hot rooms isn't my thing. \n\nIf you do it the right way there are about 5 of those dry sauna rooms so in 45 minute cycles you could easily spend a few hours here."

The massages were really rushed and fast. NOTHING about it was relaxing. It was like \"Get in, get out\", I think the massage should have been one hour but they tried to squeeze a massage, body scrub, scalp massage and wash, facial all in 70 minutes. I should've known better. The shampoo and conditioner they used for the scalp massage wasn't as good as the ones in the public wash area. My hair was all tangly afterwards, but my skin was soft enough after the scrub. Wat do u expect tho, the scrub was one of the most painful i've ever had -.- I was a little suspicious about the cleanliness of my masseuse because when I came in, I asked for another towel and she just threw my old towel into the pile of new towels. Then one of my towels had make up stains on it and a piece of here.. I don't wear make up to the spa so it might've been someone else's towel that she mixed in with all the clean towels. Kind of disturbing.. \n\n I did the $130 Body Scrub package \"Scentau\" or sth.. I've had more relaxing scrubs at Wi Spa. However, this spa is definitely much cleaner. The sauna rooms were very organized and clean. The customer service was really good. There is a lot of facilities within this spa, like 8 types of saunas or sth. There're definitely not as many people as other korean spas I've been to. The food is not that great but the price is alright. I ordered a Strawberry smoothie for around $5 and it tasted like they mixed some sort of soup into the drink. Maybe it's a healthy blend of things, who knows. The kimbap was kind of bland, they put sliced up fishballs in there or sth.. it tasted kind of spoiled.. Overall, the spa was great but just no massages for me, as for the food. I'm sure you can't go wrong with the kalbi, which was $10 but i wasn't that hungry. And just don't get the smoothie, the facilities are great though."

Bring your own flip flops and extra towels. It's 2 levels. It used to be a 24 hour fitness center. \n\nThe one thing I don't like is that is that people don't follow directions.  Posted throughout the spa in the whirlpool and steam room areas, no swimwear,  underwear, etc. Only your body and shower after you sweat. For cleanliness purposes. They don't know where your clothes have been, but they know where your body has been (In the shower). Most people are very friendly.  Always sparking up a conversation and tons of laughs. A few shrewd people, but we pay them no attention. A little tip, if you are trying to detox more or shed some excess water weight, then I recommend applying albolene to your body before you enter the steam room or dry sauna. It helps to open your pores. You will sweat like crazy and it's so relaxing. It gets pretty hot in there.  I love the heat so it's not an issue for me. If you do hot yoga, it's nothing.\n \nUpstairs, I certainly suggest the red clay ball room and the ice room. Be careful in the ball room, otherwise you will fall and bust your ass......lol. those little balls are slippery. They suggest being in the room for 20 mins, but it's so warm and comfortable that you will fall asleep. I did. The ice room is to close your pores. It's not extremely cold, just relaxing. \n\nGet the groupon. So worth it. I will be visiting the imperial spa quite often. It will be perfect after a hard workout."

I'd like to say I'll go again to see if I have a better experience, but I'm not willing to put up the money for it.\n\nCouples massage: mediocre at best. And it cost $260 Not a bad price for 90 min. BUT with that price, you expect it to be a resort style massage (like Red Rock or GVR). It was supposed to be a Swedish massage...honestly, it was the kind of massage you get at Bali Foot Spa, or any other hourly place in town. I wanted to ask if the person giving the massage was a licensed therapist. In 90 mins she didn't rub my feet. She didn't ask me what areas to work on or how the pressure was (I had to tell her that it was too much). Also, both of the massage therapists had their phones on and in the room, 3 texts and 1 ANSWERED phone call. \n\nMassage Room: AWFUL. Really, really bad. The bed was uncomfortable and covered in rough towels (not sheets) ...again, if you're charging resort prices, it needs to be that level of experience. The room was freezing, huge, and marble. They brought a heat lamp in because we were cold, but it didn't help. Imagine being naked and rubbed with (not warm) oil in a freezing cold room...now try to relax and enjoy your massage. We could also hear the TV and people talking in the waiting area over the music. Super relaxing. \n\nCheck in: ok. They had us down for the wrong time and said they would \"squeeze us in\"...could this be the reason for the horrible room and sub-par masseurs?! They gave us things to change into (shirts and shorts). I came out of the locker room to ask for flip flops as they don't allow outside shoes at all. They didn't have any left...they were cleaning them. But I was told the floor was \"relatively clean\"...so that's great. \n\nAmbience: great. (Hence the 2-stars I gave) loved the dry rooms upstairs. Very cool and relaxing. The red clay ball room was my favorite.\n\nRestaurant: CLOSED. Now, this would have been good to know when we called to book the massage, since we booked it around lunch time and planned to eat there. \n\nOverall, it was a very disappointing experience. We were both really looking forward to having a nice, relaxing day and we splurged on the couples massage to treat ourselves...I'm left feeling ripped off for sure."

In recent months you can see the cleanliness and facilities deteriorating i.e. Broken showers, broken steam sauna which makes the other available one crowded.  Towels, or lack of them and used towels left by customers which are slobs don't help.  Every time I go to the DRY Sauna there is the same Asian guy who is a regular pouring water on the rocks; did I mention it's a DRY Sauna??  The guy apparently can't read the sign that says \"Do NOT pour water on the rocks!\"  That's what the STEAM Sauna is for.  The guy didn't listen to me and I told the woman at front desk, who didn't really seem to care.\nNow, to go in the salt room there are signs posted everywhere about wearing uniforms only.  It's a major pain to put those on every time you go into a Men's ONLY salt room; towels should be sufficient.   Not impressed with the Fort Knox type lighting in the room either, not very relaxing.\n\nI hope Imperial Spa gets their act together, because I will pay a few dollars extra to have a better experience somewhere else in Las Vegas."

Just sayin'\n\nThe ritual when you get there is to to put your shoes in the shoe locker, get the flip flops out and head into the locker room to continue getting changed. The shoe lockers don't lock, so I just brought my shoes with me and put them in my locker that actually locked. From there, you head into the wet area to shower and just relax in the hot tub or variety of saunas and steam rooms. If you get a little over heated, there's a cold plunge or if you aren't that brave, there are chaise lounges in the wet area or comfy chairs in the locker area. \n\nI got the basic men's body scrub. It was great. He scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed. I don't remember feeling so clean - ever. Just get there about a half hour before your appointment time. You'll need that time to relax and spend 10-15 minutes in the spa to soften up your skin. That, and my skin was exceptionally soft. My wife is a fan ;-)\n\nAfter the treatment, I checked out the co-ed areas upstairs. I put on my \"uniform\" and headed up. I checked out the rooms upstairs, but fell in love with the Red Clay Ball Room.

It is hard to relax in their beautiful chairs when you don't understand what is going on.  It would be nice to have one area with the t.v. in English...."

Its called Imperial Health spa.  $25 bucks to spend the day (locals $20), co-ed area, red clay rooms, heated Jade floors, Salt rooms and of course the $40 Korean scrub!  Its super clean and open 24 hours a day!  Not sure if you can sleep overnight as you can in other  korean spas I have been to, but worth asking about.  I went there on Sunday and was surprised at how mellow it was.  It just opened 4 months ago so that might explain it.  If your new to the korean spa ritual just remember to shower before entering the water and after you sweat in the steam/sauna rooms, it's all nude(except in the co-ed area).  The girl at the front desk speaks english so you can tell her its your first time and she will help you.  One things for sure, you will leave there squeeky clean and soooo relaxed!"

Do NOT let the photos fool you like it fooled us!!! \n\nSo we were looking for a spa off the strip and stumbled onto this one based on the photos and yelp reviews... Little did we know that we were about to enter a bath house... and that wasn't even the worst part...\n\nWe walked in and were each given a pink t-shirt which felt hard and rough against skin (not the fluffy robes i was envisioning) and a pair of shorts that were one size fits all...\n\nNext was the locker room - it was in this open space with the lockers, showers, the bathroom, the naked scrubbing stations and everything else in the OPEN... there were naked women walking and dripping everywhere... \n\nThen comes the masseuses... while we had called ahead and requested girls - mine was this middle aged, malnourished, jaundiced, creepy asian male who wore almost a wife beater... I also saw him poke his head out of the back door to throw out a cigarette butt while we were parking... let's just say that - THERE WAS NO WAY IN HELL I WAS EVER GOING TO LET THIS GUY TOUCH ME ANYWHERE... So i demanded for my money back and decided just to pay for the day use fee...\n\nWhile waiting for my friends to get done (those who were lucky enough to get girl masseuses), my other friend (who also refused to be touched by another creepy male masseuse) and I had many adventures...\n\n1) saw people getting scrubbed down and marinated butt naked in the open like tenderizing a piece of meat\n2) naked women squatting in a row doing their washing and scrubbing their faces\n3) creepy men roaming up stairs in the lounge area in wife beaters sleeping everywhere\n4) learning that men often come looking for \"additional services\" vegas style\n5) women squatting on the toilet doing #2 and NOT closing the door plus other things I probably shouldn't mention here on yelp \n\nThis whole place felt like a cheap and dirty bathhouse/brothel... it's open 24hrs and only costs $25 and you can stay all day or all night with plenty of spots where you could be doing the dirty business... \n\nI have nothing against bath-houses but it just ain't right to misrepresent it  as a spa... I learned my lesson and next time, I'll definitely be sticking to the strip when I need a massage in vegas..."

So you shower naked and soak naked with other people of the same gender.  There are a lot of really cool rooms to spend time in but some weird warning signs about lewd behavior.  A tiny bit dirty but for the price the place is amazing."

Imperial Health Spa received raving reviews for it's cost, treatments, etc. I was sold.\nIf you are used to a more Western spa experience, this will not be your scene. Not to say this was bad, but just not what I enjoy. It was clean, the staff was ok and there is a number of rooms to relax in. There is a little area to get some food. The locker rooms have a large spa area to hot tub or scrub ( bring some salt! ). I spent 15min laying in what can only be described as a giant kitty litter box filled with hot little clay balls. The boyfriend wasn't a kitty litter fan, but I enjoyed it until some kids came in. Basically, this spa can be enjoyable if this is what you are used to and price is the number one focus. \n\nA huge downside was the small children running around. I love children, but not when I have mine at the sitter so I can enjoy some quiet time. It also creeped me out to have the children there when it's hot tub time machine in the locker room. I am not a prude and have no problem letting it out, but you get all different kinds in Vegas...and this is just asking for creepsters. Don't bring your kids please. \n\nThe prices that everyone raved about were not that inexpensive considering the location and environment.It's not that much more and such a better experience to check out a larger hotel on the strip's spa. For the 20-30$ you will save, it's just not comparable. I'm not a fan of the Eastern spas and this was too far east. -Big bush all around me. Between the Russian and Korean...my rosetta stone was spinning. Korean soaps on all the tvs. Yelpers, just want you to realize what this is. -If you enjoy a more Eastern experience, this will be great and you will feel right at home...if you are from the bible belt...turn the car around."

Plus I have gotten many  treatments done. But I'm noticing that in other people's Review's... They pay less then I do. I do show my Nevada ID so I don't understand I pay $20 to just get in and every time a do go. I at least get a smoothly.  Anyway's it's  been a while since I have gone to the spa since I'm a new mother of course your not going to go a spa pregnant. Well at lest I didn't.          And now I see pregnant women there in the hot tubs and sauna's. It blew my mind that they would let her in pregnant.  Anyway's ...                      This time I have brought my sister in law witch came here once and my 17 year old niece which was her 1st time along with me... You know girls day. I payed the $20 per person got drinks and smoothly's and the spicy ramen sope... Remember times three. Everything was grate we enjoyed are selfs relax had a Hispanic cleaning lady help us with getting things like the sea salt for the sea salt sauna you have to get from the front desk now which was new to us but she was nice e nuff  to get it for us. We tip her for it because its not her job. But there was another Korean worker there watching us at everything we did... She yelled and gave us dirty looks at us because another lady left the water on at the sit down shower. Really? So about an hr latter we decided to leave we shower one last time and we are getting dressed. My sister was using there blow dryer and it started to spark, so we hurried to turn it off and we set in on the ground to see if she was okay. The mean Korean lady that should of been working and was just sitting and watching a TV like a lazy butt, jumped up yelled at us again saying to not put the blow dryer on the floor we tried to explain to her that it was sparking and we didn't want it to catch on fire. So that's why we put it on the floor. The lady grab the blow dryer and put it back the cabernet and slammed it, liked a child. If things are like this again the next time I go. I'm very sad to say that  I'm never going again. I love this place to death a lot of my friends and family go here on MY WORD because it's so nice, clean and relaxing. I told the lady at the front desk hopefully it will change or get better. But over all it's a grate place."

First floor (past the reception desk) locker rooms (you wear your electronic key on your wrist), dry sauna, pools, steam rooms. My favorite on the first floor was the herbal steam room (so fresh!) and the hot pool. There are several groups of showers, some sitting, some standing. There are toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo/conditioner and body wash. There's water (hot or cold0 to drink. The signs say no clothing but i did see girls in bikini bottoms. It seems as though you can undress to whatever level you're comfortable. Towels were available. \n\nDownsides to the first floor: it's very humid. No phones or electronics. No food or drink (even water? in a steam room?). Only one pool has jets (the warm pool, not cold or hot). There was a tv in the hot tub area but it didn't seem to work. Maybe bc of the humidity. \n\nUpsides: you could spend all day on the first floor. Large, spacious, I never felt crowded. Modern, updated. \n\nSecond floor: there are about 6-8 treatment rooms ringing two lobby areas, a dining area and bathrooms. There are also private/paid/extra treatment rooms. One room was just a yoga clip playing with some available mats. A few others: jade clay room (no clay visible? just seemed like a hot room), ice room (not that icy), infrared/red clay room (little clay domes you slide into and rest in), red clay ball room (like a sandbox/cat litter tray you climb into, with red clay balls, pinkish rocks [looked like himalayan sea salt?] or white flat rocks). They recommend you spend 3-7 minutes in a treatment, then 30 minutes resting. You can rest on a variety of seating options: stadium cushy recliners, loveseats, massaging chairs (coin op) or loungey bed things like what you  might see at a pool. There was one Asian channel tv playing and one American tv playing. The remote is up for grabs. We were forced to watch Spike for awhile but did also see some HGTV and Food. So basic cable. \n\nEven if you never went into a single treatment room or bought anything they were selling, the $20 would be well spent if you just wanted a comfy, quiet place to sit with WIFI and a tv. We had early checkout from our hotel (11am) and spent 6 hours here, no problem. Eat before you go in and lounge. It's a great place to just be."

Only 2 pools (no Hot pool), but the facility is very clean and well attended.  However, the mega-Resort spas (European) on the strip can easily overshadow it.  If you're staying at one of the nicer hotels, you can likely visit it's spa for just a little more money.  But if you're a local, or specifically looking for a Korean spa/body scrub, this place is a descent (and your only) option."

I have since then been to several in Korea town (LA) but imperial is still my favorite.\n\nThere is one downside- now that imperial is letting people wear bathing suits- it makes me want to go somewhere else. the reason being naked works is because everyone is naked. I feel like the people who are wearing bathing suits are judging the others not in bathing suits. If you don't want to get naked DO NOT GO TO A KOREAN SPA. (so imperial lost one star because bathing suits are allowed now) \n\nAll the ones in LA do not allow bathing suits. I think primarily people should understand this is more of a BATH HOUSE vs a SPA. This is part of Korean Culture- and the services are wonderful.\n\nKorean scrubs are my favorite because they are so thorough- if you are shy work up to going to a Korean Spa and getting a treatment. you will be scrubbed EVERYWHERE- your going to have to be comfortable being touched. The ladies providing the services are in bikinis or shorts because they will be getting wet and are in watery environment. If you have never gone to a Korean Bath House ask a friend who has and go with them so they can show you what to do. \n\nGenerally- you go check in, go to the locker area- undress and put your shoes away- then go to the bath area and soak in the various hot pools, steam rooms and saunas, -ALWAYS SHOWER BEFORE ENTERING (and if they  have baskets grab one to put any towels or items you brought in)- if you get to hot take a plunge in the cold pool. The facility will provide clothing for you to wear int he co-ed areas where there are several other rooms- jade, ice, clay ball etc. There is an area to eat if you would like to have lunch- also an area to sleep if you get tired. There is a gym and a movie theater area for you to enjoy. I recommend spending the day and really experiencing the bath house.\n\nThe scrub/massage treatment- you will be scrubbed as stated above, this will follow with a vigorous Asian style based massage, you will have your hair shampooed and conditioned, and will also get cucumbers on your eyes and a face mask. You may be asked to shower a couple times during your treatment to remove scrub. \n\nOverall the experience is wonderful and relaxing and I encourage everyone to try-due to the nudity this may not be everyone's cup of tea- but at least you can say you went and had a new experience. \n\ntip in cash."

            "review": "From a guy's perspective...\n\nIf you want to get away from the crowd, the noise and the people trying to flick their little cards of adult content on the Strip, Imperial Spa is an awesome retreat.  It's not glamorous or toney like most of your typical casino spas that have fluffy towels, fruit, flavored water and Enya playing in the background but, in so many other ways, you get so much more without having to break the bank.\n\nAlright, so the location is kind of hidden and hard to spot if you're not paying attention.  Okay, it's outright shady and the building kind of looks like they were trying to make it look like the Excalibur but I digress.  Once you check in, pay for your services, get your key, your \"spa pajamas\" and enter your respective locker room area.  When you get to your locker, strip down and take a freakin shower, regardless if you're going to use the wet area or not, think of it as a courtesy to the other spa patrons who don't want to smell your funk or lingering smell of tobacco from the casinos.\n\nThe wet area, which has a large hot whirlpool tub, a cold plunge, a sauna, steam room and open sitting/standing showers.  It's freakin dude heaven because where else can you chill in a hot tub or take a shower while watching ESPN?  Yup, there's a freakin flat screen tv in the shower area that faces the tub.  Sure, you're watching the game and chillin in your birthday suit, no one gives an eff, it's a Korean spa and it's what they do. \n\nIf you want to check out the coed area, change into your spa pajamas so you can head upstairs to the coed area where they have various sauna-esque rooms, a sitting area with couches and a tv, a theatre, etc.  Of all the rooms, I especially liked the red clay ball room, it was awesome.  I literally could feel every little ball on my body!  They also have a little snack bar near the sitting area.  If you really can't live without technology, you can also bring your laptop if you want to jump on their wifi.\n\nTIP 1:  Before you head to the coed area, bring one of those small towels from the locker room so you have something to rest your head on when you use the rooms.\n\nTIP 2:  In the wet area, alternate between hot and cold, i.e. hot tub, cold plunge, sauna, shower, hot tub, steam room, etc.\n\nTIP 3:   Think of the wet area as the good ol' locker room at the gym.  You need to leave your inhibitions at the door.  If you're uncomfortable with  nudity,  this isn't the place for you.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience.  The facilities were clean, the staff was quite friendly and at least when I went on a Thursday afternoon, it wasn't too busy, which was kind of nice, it felt like I had the entire spot to myself!  You can seriously spend hours and hours in this place just chilling, without going broke.  Imperial Spa is definitely going to be my relaxation spot whenever I'm in Vegas!"

I saw glasses in the parking lot which indicates a break-in has occurred or someone got locked in their car.  You also see homeless people roaming around.\n\nThe cost is $20 for one entry\nYou can bulk by 10 passes for $130 ($13 / entry)\nSpa entry is included with massage prices if you choose to do a massage.\nTIP - Bring your own slippers.  Slippers are RECOMMENDED and they charge $5 for them.  You can walk around bare foot, but some of the rooms have burning hot floors.\n\nGreeted by a very friendly lady and she explained the process which there wasn't much of.  Basically, take a shower, go to rooms, take a shower, leave.\n\nThey hand you change, towel and a key to your locker.\nEntrance for men and women are separate.\nOnce you go in, you need to take off your shoes\n\nThen you go to your locker where you store your clothes and belongings.\n\nREQUEST - When multiple people come in at the same time, can you guys separate their locker locations?  The people around me were awkwardly saying \"excuse me\" and trying to get by eachother since all our lockers were near by.\n\nThe Shower\nYes, people are walking around naked and people get naked as soon as they go in.  Yes, ass naked with their wieners hanging out.  People are all taking shower in the same room and they are chatting in the tub.  It's very strange at first, but you just look away from others and start taking a shower.  They provide a tooth brush, shaving cream and a plastic shaver.  There is a mirror in front of every shower so you can see yourself taking a shower.  There's the usual shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel.  Dry yourself off with the towel before you leave.\n\nOutside the shower, there is everything from dryer, brush, body moisturizer, after shave, etc.\n\nThe Sauna\nUpstairs (co-ed), there are many rooms.\nExercise Room - A few bike machines and a mirror to stare at yourself.  Would've been nice if they had weights.\nCommunity Room - Many people sitting on massage chair to sleep or watch TV\nIce Room - It's just a giant freezer.  Why?\nIron/Magnesium Room - Just a hot room to lie down in.\nClay Room - Very hot room and you lie down in a coffin like place\nYoga Room - Seems like a room where you're supposed to meditate\n?? Room - A room with a bunch of rocks or beads on the ground to lie down on.  \nWork Room - Just a room with a bunch of tables and chairs so you can work or eat.\nWifi is provided.\nWater is free.  There is a water dispenser\nThere is a random korean food menu too I guess in case you want to be there the whole day.\n\nDeep Tissue Massage ($90 for one hour) - It was a-ok.\nThis was professional.  The masseuse made sure I was covered most of the time and I was at ease.  There was nothing inappropriate and a bottle of water was provided at the end.  The towel against my face felt a bit hard at times.  My neck is a bit bruised, but I think I could've had her adjust the strength.  Not that refreshing and I would probably try something else next time.\n\nKitchen - Stay away\nThey have a korean kitchen where you can eat over-priced food.  The food quality isn't bad, but there are many better choices elsewhere off the strip.  Wait if you can.  There was a metal mesh wrapped around my friend's bean sprout which was not safe or acceptable.\n\nAll in all, did I enjoy it?\nIt was a new experience\nI sweated a lot.\nI can't say I feel extremely relaxed or detoxed like I've read, but I'd probably do it again when I'm feeling like I want to take a break from Vegas."

            "review": "This place is fantastic. What a hidden Vegas gem. I've lived here all my life but I never would have known about Imperial Spa if not for their deal on Living Social. If you can catch it, the deal is $20 for two passes (regular price is $20 each), so bring a friend (or use it twice)!\n\nMy favorite was the dry salt sauna room. It was warm but not too hot and there are big mats for your to lay down on. I stayed in there for about twenty minutes and was completely relaxed. Be sure to wear slippers in here (you can bring your own or get a pair at the front desk in exchange for your I.d.), the tile floors get really hot. \n\nI also really enjoyed the ice room. It was such a relief after being in some of the hotter rooms. The cool marble felt amazing against my skin and there is a little section of cold stones you can stick your feet in. \n\nI did not like the red clay ball room as much as I thought I would. This room has big tubs which you can lay down in full of tiny red clay balls. I imagined getting down in the balls and relaxing that way but they were way way too hot for that. I was able to get in there for a few minutes by laying a towel down on top of the balls but anywhere they touched my skin was almost unbearable. \n\nI ate lunch in the little cafe and it was pretty tasty. It was pricy but you get a lot of food for the money. A friend and I split the chow mein and we couldn't even finish it was so much food! After lunch we relaxed for a while and watched tv in the lounge area on the second floor while sipping iced green tea before getting back to the spa time. \n\nI will definitely be going back again. I left feeling completely refreshed."

The downstairs Men's side was clean. Everything was in working order. Plenty of room, especially since there were so few guys there mid-afternoon. \n\nThe upstairs co-ed area was very nice, with lots of sauna options.\n\nBut by far my favorite was the Clay Ball Room. \nI just love balls, and these are the hottest balls in town! \nThey're clean and smooth, and fun to play with.\nI spent a good twenty minutes snuggled up against the balls, and could have easily gone a second round.  Honestly, if I thought that I could install one of these pits in my bedroom, I would sleep surrounded by hot balls every night.  \n\nAs someone with minor arthritis, it felt wonderful to roll the balls around in my hands and to rub my feet up against them.  Truly therapeutic!\n\nA cooling sit in the ice room was a nice way to end the day. \n\nFood is expensive, and not much vegetarian.\nThis is not a fancy place, but very nice, nonetheless. \nI wish that there had been more large towels available. \n\nTotal Win."

Especially with groupon deals.\nOnly thing I wish was the customer service aspect of this.  \n\nThere wasn't much direction on which spas to go in first, or how to use them? Other than just lay down, try and relax and sweat. Maybe I had higher expectations and expected aroma therapy along with the rooms to make me feel some type of way. \n\nThe herbal sauna downstairs in the men's section helped out a lot. \n\nThe food seemed over priced vs typical Korean dishes in china town."

I'm addicted to Korean spas.\n\nMy boyfriend schemed with my girl friend to take me here to celebrate some turning points in our lives (grad school acceptance, etc.).  At this point, I had only visted the Wi Spa in LA.  \n\nImperial Spa is HUGE.  It's a little bit hard to find, tucked in the back behind some buildings.  It boasts its own parking lot with plenty of space.\n\nWhen you enter the lobby, you will check in and pay your entrance fee at the desk.  Feel free to inquire about any services you may want, although it is prudent to book these services in advance.  You will be given a numbered electronic key wristband.  Put it on right away to save you from the mistake of accidentally leaving it in your automatically locking locker.  You will also be given shorts, a t-shirt, a small towel, and a big towel.  From there, men and women will enter separate spas through the designated door.\n\nWhen you enter the women's side, you first encounter small lockers for your shoes.  Remove your street shoes and place them in your assigned locker (these are not lockable).  Beyond that point is a \"no street shoe policy.\"\n\nYou will then come up to a set of larger lockers in which to store your things.  Open the locker by pressing your wristband key up to the reader.  Store your belongings and strip down to your birthday suit.  Feel free to wrap your big towel around you to start to get used to walking around nekkid.  It's also nice to have the towel to set down on benches in the dry sauna/steam room.\n\nPRO TIP:  Bring an extra towel for post-spa showering/drying off.\n\nFrom here, take a thorough shower and get squeaky clean.  Your fellow spa patrons will appreciate it.  Then you're free to use all the amenities!  Just remember to rinse off after using the steam/sauna rooms.  A good rule to remember is:  If you sweat, shower.\n\nIf you're with a co-ed party, put on your provided shorts/t-shirt and meet up in the jiljimbang (co-ed area) to explore the sauna rooms, relax, and eat!\n\nKorean spas are WONDERFUL, inexpensive (comparatively), and social.  Even at full price admission ($25/person), it is money well spent for a day of relaxation.\n\nPRO TIP:  This is also a SUPERB way to start girls night out.  They have incredible vanity stations where you can do your hair/make-up, also lots of blow dryers.\n\nPRO TIP:  Bring your usual shower gear (face-wash, loofah, etc.) to take a proper shower after your spa day."

We spent most of our time in the co-Ed areas (the heated clay rooms/ice rooms).  The next time I went I met up with friends again but stayed several hours later by myself to enjoy the female only areas on the 1st floor.  The first floor (naked floor) included the showers, tubs and steam rooms.  There were several different tubs, a cold tub, warm tub and hot tub.  It was nice going into a steam room and then going into one of the cold tubs afterwards.  I never thought I'd be able to spend so much time at a spa but I was probably there for a good 3-4 hours alone.  If you are there with a male/female group or going as a couple you can only spend time on the 2nd floor which is the co-Ed floor and you must wear your spa attire (t shirt and shorts provided at the front desk). The cool thing about the 2nd floor is the food/drinks you can order and the section where they have TVs and recliners.  I went on a Sunday so some people were watching the football games.  *wear your provides flip flops or wear your own especially in the hot rooms, your feet will burn up!"

            "review": "So this was my second time coming to this facility and let me say that the second time around was ten times better. And I KNOW that's mainly because I knew what to expect. So let me start this review by describing it through the eyes of a first timer.\n\n(Cue in reminiscent music, pan in on face then fade out) I came here with my sister for Christmas 2012 as that was our Xmas present from my brother in law. He for sure wanted to have his wife and sis in law pampered so insisted we go to a spa. Being the glamazon princess that I am I pushed for Qua but my sister didn't want to break the bank on her hubby and pushed this place. I gave in as there is no sense in arguing. After all its a gift and I'll be appreciative no matter what or where it is. So off to Imperial Spa we go.\n\nNow I've never been to a korean spa so had no clue what I was in for. With that said nor have I ever been to a naked bath house either and that's basically what I got. Not that that is a bad thing....it's just that I'm not used to seeing that many naked women in one setting...especially naked women that can pass for my mom and aunties. AWKWARD. So it was DEFINITELY initial shock. Naturally my sister and I were shy about being naked and walked around holding two 12x16 towels over our lady bits. But after being overwhelmed with the inundation of nakedness, my sister looked at me, exclaimed \"Screw it!\" and dropped trout. Due to her apparent \"freedom\" I shrugged and tossed the towel too. And there we were, the Naked Sisters, experiencing what the world would be like if clothes weren't invented. \n\nWe decided to check out all our options. There were several SAUNA ROOMS: dry salt room, herbal room, salt room, and a dry room. We ventured in all four and I would have to say my favorite is the herbal room as you can smell the herbs. It was very relaxing if you can tolerate profusely sweating. Prior to enjoying the three different tubs--think of it as Goldilocks: cold, warm and hot--you're required to shower before entry. So there are showers equipped with shampoo, conditioner and soap dispensers. I used all three and all smelled lovely. \n\nWe then ventured upstairs/2nd floor, which is the co-ed floor. Btw, you have to be clothed for the coed floor--this place is not that free love. There you'll find an exercise room, two media lounge areas with leather recliners and couches; the restaurant, skin/beauty/massage rooms, and three different DETOX ROOMS. I like to call them detox rooms as they are the following: red clay balls, jade, and red clay. They emit into your body releasing your toxins and promotes agelessness and function. Actually, just go on the website for a better accurate description as my review definitely is not medically approved. \n\nFor additional costs, you can get other services--and no I'm not talking happy endings--head over to Chinatown for that. Sister got a bath scrub and I got a stone massage. \n\nSo having returned for a second time last night with a girlfriend who isn't shy to bare all (caveat: groupon states that its recommended to be naked however upon check in it clearly states that it's REQUIRED to be in your birthday suit), we ventured in every area included in the day pass. My favorite experience was the red clay balls. I thoroughly enjoyed wiggling myself deeper and deeper into the miniature balls however try not to make too much noise as most of the areas are Quiet Zones and you WILL get looks. \n\nWe did also eat at THE CAFE and ordered the beef bulgogi. The prices are expensive, the plate alone cost $18. However it does come with sides of kimchee, tofu, and seaweed. I wished, wished, wished I had my iphone with me so I could upload pictures of the food--it would make you want to eat the pictures! I was nosy enough to look at what the other patrons were eating and their food looked just as yummy. With that said, although pricey at least it will taste good. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nIn case they don't give you any sandals, bring some as the floors get extremely hot in particular on the co-ed floor. If you don't want to be bouncing around like a Russian dancer or one of the seven lords a-leaping or walking like a penguin, bring spa sandals. \n\nThe locker room can get pretty cramped as there's only two \"ottomans\" centered there. There is a lounge area right by the lockers. I would suggest changing in there if the locker room does get clogged up. \n\nCome with an open mind and a mind that's ready to reach zen. \n\nOVERALL, I like this place. I like this place a lot. So much that my gf and I plan to come here at least once a month. I seriously could have fell asleep amongst the sea of red balls......its the following morning and I still feel so zen."

This spa is a hidden treasure grant it the exterior isn't as nice as the Mandarin but the amenities nonetheless are comparable for this price!!!! It's tucked away on the east side of the strip on Sahara. Their amenities include 6 rooms in which 4 are hot rooms made of stone jade, red clay, and Himalayan salt. These rooms are meant to regenerate your core and relieve any type of muscle pressure or pain in the joints. There is also a room designated specifically for yoga and it'll have a large screen where they show yoga videos. The last room I visit is the ice box room because you will sweat ur nuts off in all of them except for this one, it's literally an ice box. The spa also includes infinity pools and dry sauna and 2 steam rooms: herbal & sea salt. I love coming here with my girlfriends and spending a day just relaxing doing yoga in the hot rooms. We feel great after we leave. Did I mention the spa also has a small fitness room in which you can work out. It's a MUST GO!!!"

I'm just going to get to the point since quite a few fellow yelpers explained clearly in their reviews what to expect from this korean spa. \n\nPretty much for any korean spa you go to - the best services to get is the body scrub treatment. But I'm not comfortable yet having an ajumma giving me a full body scrub down butt nekkid. So I pass on that & the amenities as well for i'm more about the massages/treatments.\n\n:: SPA SERVICES ::\nSo I came for the deep tissue massage & my gf had a facial treatment. Don't expect to get a bathrobe - it ain't the hotel spa. They do give you towels and a set of short/shirt to wear.  So you don't have to worry about going in a bath towel for your massage treatment - which i'm sure you could if you wanted to?! The massage treatment rooms are downstairs and the facial treatment is upstairs on the Co-Ed floor. Patricia was my masseuse & she did an outstanding job. She really got to my knots & double checked to make sure the pressure was ok throughout the hour. I think there was even a moment or so that I almost fell asleep! I know my gf said she did in her facial treatment :) That's how relaxing & enjoyable our treatments were~\n\n\n:: FOOD ::\nOMG I must say that i was surprised that the food we had here was actually really good. We ordered Bibimbap & Galbi Tang. Both were made just perfect and it was so tasty! We were given 3 banchans & they were hella good too!  As for pricing I must say it'd definitely on the pricier end but still worth it. There are hot/cold water dispenser by the cafe bar (located on the co-ed floor) too. Plenty of seating of your choice.\n\n\n:: DRAWBACKS ::\nThe only negative I have is that it was pretty warm all around the whole place - especially the bathrooms (definitely no ventilation in there!). The only spot that was nice & cool was the lobby area =\\  Maybe it's just me? \n\n\n:: NOTES ::\n1) Not that easy to find for it's not visible off the Saraha strip\n2) The front desk area do provide complimentary toothbrushes & razors\n3) There are kids here that family's do bring so don't be surprised seeing them\n4) slippers  can be requested from the front desk just know you aren't suppose to\n     wear the slippers to the Co-Ed room\n5) smoking patio is upstairs to the left of the cafe side where the dining area is"

My favorite rooms are the Himalayan salt room, the clay ball room, and the ice room. It's extremely clean and even when I've been there later in the evening, staff are cleaning. I have never eaten here, but the shave ice looks good. The only negative thing I can think of, is that the lounge chairs in the upstairs area don't all work, but that's pretty minor. \n\nIf you are looking for an inexpensive, fun way to relax with friends or even alone, check this place out - and check groupon first, there is almost always a groupon!"

Both saunas were very slimy feeling on the floors, and the amount of dirty towels and clothes around the men's area was pretty bad. There were no clean towels available, and as a very frequent spa visitor towels get wet after a few sauna visits. Draping a wet towel around you isn't always the most comfortable thing to do.\nAs for the hot tub, I wasn't to impressed and the fact that there were black dirty spots inside the rim of the walls was not a pleasant site to see. I'm not sure how often they are cleaned but I do know any pool or hot tub should not have dirt rings on the walls. \n\nI will however give the third star due to the cost of spa, the dry rooms were very warm and relaxing also very clean. Coed was especially clean.  I will probably visit again but it definitely wont be for a while, and next time I really hope to see the cleanliness of the wet areas to be better. \n\nTO THE OWNERS, we as customers to you are all NAKED. How would you feel if you saw dirt and slime everywhere and your naked skin was surrounded by it. GET IT TOGETHER OWNERS!!!! I'm sure your private homes are not as gross as some of these conditions were."

(And because I paid for it before knowing what was to come) It was an accidentally pleasant and interesting experience.   \n\nIf you can get over it (being nude), this is a really fun and inexpensive place for a spa day! We used the groupon deal which was a steal! I gave them 5 stars because you can't beat $21 dollars for two people for all day access to their spa facilities. They provide things like spa clothes, sandals, soap, shampoo, conditioner, a toothbrush, a razor, lotions, hair dryers and water bottles. We started off using the different sauna rooms. Also tried the clay toom, jade room and ice room. They also have a yoga room. For a Friday morning it was very quiet and peaceful. \n\nAfter we got a feel for the place we decided to purchase a 70 min body scrub plus massage for only $120 a person. A steal considering how much it cost to do the same anywhere else on the strip. It took a little bit of courage considering you have to be nude in front of all these strangers. There are no clothes allowed in the pools, wet saunas, showers and treatment rooms. They require you to shower or sit in the sauna for 10 minutes to soften your skin before a body scrub. They scrub every inch of your body that you can imagine. THAT. YOU. CAN. IMAGINE. Massage was great for tiny little women! They are way stronger that they look. The package also came with a facial mask and shampoo massage. Felt super squeaky clean and relaxed afterwards!\n\nThey also serve Korean food and drinks in the common area upstairs.  I ordered KBBQ and shrimp fried rice to end the day there. Not sure if it was delicious or if I was just starving, but it felt like the best meal of my life at the time. Who wouldn't want to gorge yourself with Korean food after spending hours getting pampered!!?\n\nI would absolutely return!"

My boyfriend took me for my birthday yesterday and it was such a much needed \"gift\". He has been here before and raved about it. Going in, I didn't know what to expect but it was really clean inside. He let me choose what package I wanted, I ended up getting the aroma-therapy scrub and massage which was 90 minutes and $150.00. He got the swedish massage which is a mild massage for the men, if you get the deep tissue expect it to be a bit rough. When buying the package a man was complaining about this massage, stating he must've bought the wrong package. There's a woman's area, & mens, and they provide clothes for you to change into.\nThere's saunas and hot tubs, beware ladies A LOT of nudity but in your area. At first I wasn't so comfortable, but seeing how everyone was naked in the woman's area, I adjusted. Finally my massage came and found me in the hot tub area. The aroma scrub was delightful, she scrubbed away all my \"dead skin\", and even asked if I wanted to avoid my tattoo areas, I told her to go gentle in that area. Even though she didn't speak English that well, she was kind, we communicated well, made me feel comfortable because I was naked throughout this whole scrub / massage. Washed, and cleaned, and went onto the massage. I think I even fell asleep, it was a great experience. I also got a facial, and my hair shampoo and conditioned. I felt like a whole new woman, and RELAXED! I'm still relaxed lol.\n\nNice Staff, clean, and well worth the time and money.\n\nP.S. There is a common area where there is lazy leather boy chairs, and a big screen t.v. and also an area where you can watch movies. I have to say this was a great gift! My boyfriend will have me raving for months, or until next time ;]"

I was super happy when I found this place in Las Vegas!\nUSED to go to this spa pretty often with my friends, but after visiting last time on 7/18/2016 unfortunately NOT GONNA COME BACK!\nThe staff was extremely unhelpful and don't bother with asking to talk to a manager\nMr. William Chang , he was rude and absolutely didn't try to find a solution.\nThe story:\nI bought a few groupons for this spa (as like I said, used to go to this place often) but suddenly I had to fly to another country for a couple months because of family issue my mom got very sick). By the time I've got back the groupons were still working for me but I didn't use them all in time because I had to fly back to my family again. So I went to SPA on May 1 and ask if there is anything they could do for me so I'm not loosing my money and they were so helpful and understanding that they gave me vouchers for all my groupons that they were good till sept 2016 and some good till even 2018 year!!! I was extremely happy. \nI am back to LV now and yesterday 7/18/2016 went to SPA with friends but didn't end up using the facility at all. As soon as I pulled vouchers out of my bag the man at the reception right away said: WE DON'T EXCEPT THIS ANYMORE! Even the expiration day was sep 2016,they refused to let us use the facility except we would pay, but I already paid for it!!! \nWhile we tried to find any solution the manager Mr. William Chang came out of his office and started talking to me, but he didn't even try to find a solution to satisfy us as customers. First of all he said that vouchers I have they were giving for free and couldn't been given to me instead of groupon! and they've stopped excepting those since May 11 anyway. WHAT?? \nAfter long explanation and telling my story to a manager he said: All I can do for you today  is you pay for one visit and can go 2 people! it's my final offer, he said!\nI'm sorry: final offer??? I didn't hear any other offers, that was the only offer he made! In which case why would I agree to that offer, if I already paid for the visit?! Not to mention he was speaking with a very rude tone to me and didn't even try to understand the situation. In fact he didn't even try to listen. He even was back to his office without saying anything, so I had to ask him to come back again! And then finally after all my trials to prove him my point, he said he doesn't believe me, so I asked if he is calling me a LIAR? His response was: ACTUALLY, YES YOU ARE LYING TO ME.\nLater one of his staff said that manager didn't call me a liar, that was some kind of misunderstanding!\nI wasn't alone there, I have people who heard what I've heard!\n\nAlso I still have about 7 more vouchers as deals from groupon were for 1,2 and 4 persons.  \nThe SPA manager told me that I have to talk to groupon if I have any issues. The whole reason I went to this spa in may and agreed to those vouchers it's because there was an expiration date at the groupon deal so I was trying to find a solution to not loose my money. But the SPA manager said that groupon never expires, he didn't even want to look at my groupon account while I was trying to show him to prove that expiration date does exist!\n\nVERY DISAPPOINTED!!! I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS PLACE, BUT SEEMS LIKE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS ANYMORE!\n\nP.S. Not that I didn't get chance to relax at the spa I've got stressed out because of visiting this place! Ridiculous!!!"

I did not feel like I was rushed through it. I was a little disappointed that there were only 2 hot tubs and 1 cold tub to soak in. The hot tubs were a bit too hot for me so I had to keep plunging in the cold tub to cool off. I'm used to Korean spas that have 6 pools of all varying temperatures plus mug wart rinsing stations etc. was pleasantly surprised with the herbal sauna. I think that was my favorite. I ate in their tiny restaurant. Had marinated beef. it was kind of like bulgogi. It was okay, not the best but then i wasn't expecting it to be the best. The spa was pretty much empty, about 7 women came through while I was there, all Korean (which I think is a great sign) Upstairs in the coed section there were 4 men (all Korean) All in all I had a fabulous day and will be going back. I am so glad i am local and its not too far from my home. I definitely recommend this place it is a jewel in the desert!"

Last call for orders is 9:30p.m. and to get anything, just ring the bell by the water dispenser. I also like their Sikhye (sweet Korean rice cold drink) for when you're feeling dizzy or low on sugar. This will definitely help you replenish! And if you have room for dessert, their snow ice fruit dessert is ginormous in serving size! So good in cooling you down.\n\nI skip the mud ball room, but if I have time, I'll stay a few minutes in the red clay eskimo room. The rooms upstairs are extremely hot and it wasn't like that a few years ago. Afterwards, I'll go take a shower and call it a night. I use the big body towel at the very end to dry myself and my hair. I use the smaller towel for whenever I'm sitting down inside the steam rooms, scrubbing myself, wash it, use it upstairs over the pillows to help me stay cool, and finally after I'm done taking a shower, I wash it again, ring the excess water, and pre dry myself before heading to my locker to change. I do bring my own face and body lotion to use after I changed into my regular clothes. I'll put my towels in the hamper and my used tshirt/shorts in the hamper on the locker side. They do have signs on where to put what, but nobody seems to keep it together here. I also bring a gatorade drink to get my electrolytes back into my body after sweating so much. I drink it after every sweat session to keep me hydrated. There are water dispensers by the lockers and upstairs by the yoga room. \n\nFor men, be careful with wandering eyes and lurky hands. My Father's best friend had someone lay right next to him and waited until he fell asleep to grab his you know what and when my dad witnessed this, he yelled.. you crazy! I also had a woman that was coloring her damn hair at this spa and when I was taking a shower at the end, she was rinsing it off next to me. All that black dye was spraying all over my legs! I was not a happy camper. \n\nOverall, this is the only place in Vegas that offers so many amenities and delicious, authentic Korean food. I wish they would open another one in the west side of town! Love getting my sweat on, detox my toxins away, and reeeeelaxing!"

It was there that I learned to overcome any residual American victorian reserve about spending time naked in water with fellow business associates. As a voluptuous non-asian from a cheese-eating nation, my naked form stood out from the lithe Asian locals in the locker room like a lolly pop pulled from its stick. I spent my first visit trying to keep the small towel strategically placed on my flora and fauna_ as not to offend. That was a long time ago, and I have since come to love this communal bath experience that has spoiled me forever. Today I can saunter about a locker room or mineral spring butt naked with more gusto than Will Ferrel's famous streak in the movie Old Skool.\n\nQua... Oh Nua, Forget overpriced hotel spa rubs that annoy with Enya music and slather you with rancid oil used to fry buffet fare. I 've come to rely on the Asian bath house experience as a way to heal and regenerate regularly. At Imperial, the hot and cold plunges are only outdone by a golden jade sauna and clay room_great for  getting your meditation on. Imperial Spa has provided me with a local fix for this once exotic travel indulgence, right here in LV 24/7. Katherine is an amazing healer and massage therapist, and good homestyle Korean food rounds out your visit.   \n\nTo quote Ru Paul \" You're born naked, you die naked, and everything inbetween is just drag\""

If you're like me and don't look Korean, you won't get stared at at all.  I'm from southern California and came here while on a short stay here in Vegas.  It wasn't easy for tourists to find, and I'm guessing the clientele was mostly locals.  I'm glad I got there early.  At that time, I nearly had the bathing section to myself and the ratio of Koreans to non-Koreans was 1:1.  By the time I was leaving (around 4 pm), it was 1 Korean : 2 non-Koreans and it got busy.  I guess there aren't that many Koreans in Vegas.\n\nThe bathing section had weird hooks hanging from the ceiling.  At first, I was a bit confused about the knobs for tubs' jets.  The seated showers were a ways off from the standing ones.  My favorite part of the bathing section was the herbal steam room.  Bath towels were large enough to wrap around my body, unlike at most other K-spas.\n\nThe coed area was upstairs.  It sure looked nice up there.  Its main lounging area and the restrooms there were really cold though, so I never felt the need to try the ice sauna there.  Also, compared to other K-spas, these saunas took longer to make me sweat.  I guess what I liked best upstairs was the free wifi (an access code is posted at the snack bar), because all these places in Vegas are so stingy and want to charge for wifi.  I take free wifi for granted back home in So Cal.  The main problem I had upstairs was that the shorts of my PJs kept falling down - they were huge and the elastic wasn't snug enough to hold them up.\n\nApparently, they allow babies here.  As I left, a woman was taking her baby into the bath section.  At least his or her diaper was still on.  I don't think saunas and steam rooms are safe for babies, and I sure wouldn't want them in communal bathwater...also babies aren't put into showers, but rather into little baby bathtubs at home.  I can see parents wanting to go to a spa, but they should hire a babysitter first, leave the baby with them, and then go.  I also saw this Korean family (granny, 2 adult daughters and a 3 yr. old granddaughter) come into the sauna of the bathing area.  The little granddaughter hated it and was throwing a fit, so they all left soon after they got there.  This isn't really a place for little kids or babies, and I felt like a perv being naked with a grown woman's body (big boobs, hairy bush) in front of a little kid like her.\n\nThank goodness the cleaning lady here wasn't hovering near me when I was getting ready to leave like they tend to do at some of these other places, and yet the place was kept clean without her being underfoot or in the way."

I don't feel particularly good with 6 year olds that aren't my issue running around at schwantz level looking at my crotch area.  Might be cool in other cultures, but definitely queers the vibe.\nSecond, they have a restaurant located on the second floor.  Didn't try any of the food, but I'm not a huge fan of smelling kalbi while I'm trying to relax after a steam shower.  Food is a good idea, I just wouldn't have anything cooked to serve.  \nThird, this is a Korean spa, so all the televisions are on Korean channels, whose programming is strange.  Would like to have seen more screens for all the new years day bowl games.\nFinally, because this is Korean joint, all the men(and woman according to my girlfriend who also visited the woman's spa) do not shave, so it looks like a jeri curl convention in there, which is also unattractive.  Massage I got was pretty good, but not cheap at 90.00 for an off strip joint.

They used to have shaving soap and razors--not anymore.  There was no attendant, either, so nobody was cleaning.  I went in the morning and they only had one employee for the entire place.  He was very nice, but if a woman had an issue, she would have been out of luck.  The steam room had steam, but it wasn't hot at all--just warm.  They also have a new rule where you have to wear the uniform in certain parts of the locker room, so you would have to keep putting clothes on and taking them off. I know that they are trying to stop people from doing inappropriate things, but if they had an attendance walking around, that wouldn't be an issue.  It seems to me that they have made all of these changes to save money, but now it doesn't seem like a Korean spa anymore.  Unless they change back, I will not be returning."

Definitely more popular during the cold winter months versus hot summer days. \nTips- Be prepared to be naked in all male/female locker room and shower stalls. They give you a uniform to wear in the common area where the different relaxation rooms are at. Food is good too.. a little pricey compared to regular restaurant but homemade good."

            "review": "The spa is very clean but I personally prefer more \"pretty\" places. This is a very pragmatic place. It feels institutional to me. When I come here, it's to get a treatment and to hangout for a few minutes in the co-ed areas. Then I leave. I enjoy the clay ball rooms a little. I don't zen out on them like other people. To me it's more of a novelty. I wouldn't make a day out of a visit here. It's just not luxurious enough for me. A few hours is plenty.\n\nBut with that said, this is a very big facility with a lot of good things going. My recommendation is to pay for a spa service and use the facilities as an added bonus. I get scrubbed shiny with the Body Massage Scrub for $120. My skin is always super smooth with all the dead stuff sloughed off when the treatment is done.\n\nYes, yes. You get naked for the majority of the time you're here. I think this is more bothersome to the men I know who've been here. Something about bathing with other naked men. Oh... get over it! Naked is good. Naked should happen more often with no sexual intent."

Please note that there is a lot of NUDITY (your own sex of course) and if you're okay with that then this place will not let you down.  I loved the the hot tub, warm tub and cold tub.  There is a variety of saunas which include both wet and dry.  I like to alternate my time in each.  My personal favorites were the wet salt sauna, dry salt sauna and the clay dome sauna.  The clay dome sauna felt like a bunch of little caves and you can have one all to yourself.  It may make some feel claustrophobic, but I actually enjoyed it.  I felt like it was my escape from the world.  There was even an ice room, which surprisingly I enjoyed.  I felt like every muscle in my body was able to relax here.  You sweat a lot too, so I felt like I was clearing out my pores and doing something beneficial for my skin.  They have shampoo, conditioner and shower gel by each of their showers.  My skin can tend to be sensitive and neither one of their products irritated me at all which was a huge plus.  Also please make sure to shower before getting into any of the tubs.  It's a courtesy thing.  I must have showered at least 3 times when I was there.  I have to say even the showers feel amazing.  The water pressure is excellent.\n\nThey do offer spa services which have received tons of great reviews.  I do plan on doing some of them.  The packages sound excellent and then you can spend the whole day using the facilities.  The admittance cost was ridiculously affordable too!  I'll be sure to be back soon."

Marble floors, marble walls, leather barcaloungers. The hot rooms are my favorite, especially the room with the heated clay balls. It's an adult version of the ball pit at Chuck E. Cheese, minus the snot. Bonus: the heat gives you a legit natural high, which you can bask in as you watch Korean soap operas in the lounge. You can add treatments & massages if you like. Downstairs is the woman only spot, where you get naked. I loved the showers where you sit. Used those multiple times, as is proper etiquette.\n\nIs it weird that hanging out here with my best friend naked all day is now among my top 3 memories? Maybe. I am really bummed that on my next visit I won't be able to come here, because I am with child & the hot rooms are a big pregnant lady no-no. I mean, sanctity of motherhood, beauty of life, blah blah etc, but for fuck's sake, I want to rub myself in a pit of balls!"

            "review": "I went to this spa at the recommendation of a friend who had been here before. \n\nI've previously been to jeju Korean spa in Atlanta, GA, so I had high expectations that this would be similar. It's not quite the same but it's kind of like a baby sister version, if that makes sense. (A bit smaller and less saunas upstairs.)\n\nYou check in at the front desk and get the spa clothing--my bottoms were too small and the replacement bigger size I got were still a little snug. I'm not sure if they go bigger than what I had but if you are a larger size customer I would call ahead to find out what size they offer and if you can bring your own clothing.\n\nI couldn't tell from the website but if you pay for a massage you get the day spa access included, which makes the big price of the massage much more worth it. \n\nThere are at least two steam rooms (one salt, one herbal) downstairs in the women's bath area, complimentary razors, toothbrushes and toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel included. I would bring your own face masks and scrubs if you have them. \n\nThe upstairs has several hot rooms, a red clay stone thingy where you lay in a bunch of rocks, a room with a yoga workout projected on a screen and two areas where you can hang out in recliners watching TV (one was on a Korean channel and one was on English speaking channel). \n\nI had the spicy pork bbq for lunch--it was pricey at $15 but came with several side dishes. The ginger tea was excellent.\n\nI got a 90 minute deep tissue massage and it was pretty good. Not the best I've had but overall contributed to a relaxing day at the spa."

I used a Groupon and paid $14 instead of the regular $20 facility fee. \n\nThis review is only for the facility. My girlfriend and I flew into Vegas for The Chainsmokers at Hakkasan Friday night and had a flight home the next morning at 6:20am so we wanted to relax at the spa a bit and have a place to get ready. \n\nThis place was gross. The showers were dirty and the sinks all had hair in them. Half of the showers didn't work or were broken (spraying water in odd directions). The hot tub & warm tub temps were the same and both had a heavy chlorine/chemical smell. Half the lights above the sinks were out so not the best lighting for applying makeup. We were already in our way out at 10 but they announced over the speaker system that the spa was closing in 1 hour but the website states the hours are till 11:30pm. \n\nNever coming back here and DO NOT recommend to anyone."

You can stay all day and enjoy the facilities upstairs and downstairs.\n\nO.K.  First things first.   The downstairs area is separated by sex.  Men go in one room, women go in another room.   The pools, jacuzzi, steam rooms, saunas are ALL NUDE!  No bathing suits, no clothes.   So if you're super shy - this is NOT the place for you.\n\nThe place is very clean and the people are very nice.   I'm a big lady (200 lbs) so I was a little nervous at first about the \"nude\" part, but nobody made me feel uncomfortable about my size.    I love the jacuzzi pool (warm) (largest of the three pools).  They also have a hot pool and a cold pool.\n\nMy absolute favorite is the HERBAL STEAM ROOM.   Smells so good and feels wonderful.\n\nUpstairs is CO-ED.   When you check into the spa they give you towels, slippers, and a pair of shorts and a t-shirt.   You wear the shorts/t-shirt upstairs.\n\nThey have a place to eat, but I haven't eaten there -- too pricey for me."

I received the vitamin C facial and I really felt like she did a good job of tightening up my pores and having the products penetrate my face.\n\nHowever, there were some gripes I had. The facial was supposed to be for 1hr and 15 min and it was more like 1hour. It probably would have been if she was more slower and thorough during her massage. It was was nice and replacing, just wished she slowed her tempo a bit. She's not too gentle, but her hands are very experienced and knows what they're doing. Also, at the end of the facial, instead of a glowing, my face was slathered on w/ oil, that made me look like I was drowned in it.\n\nThe facilities has probably seen better days. Doesn't look like they are doing a good job of upkeep. The chances of me returning are pretty slim. I'll just stick w/ Korean spas in SoCal."

Stuck between some European lady giving me a facial and a middle-aged Korean woman scrubbing the top 5 layers of my skin off.\"\n\n\n\nI decided to go with the Korean woman and Imperial Health Spa.  Imperial is tucked away in a less than ritzy part of Las Vegas on Sahara East of the Strip.  Keep an eye out for the signs or you might miss it.\n\nI had come here on recommendation from a couple sets of friends (some local and some tourists that found this place on Yelp.)  They are open 24 hours if you just want to use the saunas and what not for $20 admission (I honestly am not sure how the overnight admission works)\n\nI came here specifically for a Body Scrub & Massage ($90) and was kind of disappointed to find out (after I had been there for 5 hours) that for $5 more I could have \"upgraded\" to a salt scrub or some kind of fruit scrub.  Oh well... now I know for next time.\n\nYou kind of have to do a little reading to figure this place out so that you don't walk in there expecting one thing and getting another.\n\nWhat to expect:\n-Clean facilities.\n-Korean tv blasting EVERYWHERE\n-Tough love type of massage (the kind that hurts good)\n-Husky Korean lady in lacey bra and panty set (that would be your scrub technician/masseuse, Joanne)\n-Nudity. Lots of it.\n\nCool Perks:\n-Theater room\n-Juice bar and Restaurant (I really liked the food, and the fact that I could take my leftovers to go... That spicy tofu soup made an awesome midnight snack... Prices rance between $7 and $15 but portions are pretty big for 1 person)\n-Exercise room (even though the treadmills were out of comission)\n\n\nThe Saunas were different and although I read the descriptions of each of them I still didn't really feel any difference between them. (Salt Sauna, Jade Sauna, Red Clay Sauna, Red Clay Ball Sauna, Cedar Sauna).  I kind of felt bad in the Red Clay Ball Sauna because some lady was snoring away and I kind of accidentally spilled a bunch of the teeny tiny clay balls on the tile floor as I was trying to get out of my Clay Ball Bed.\n\nThere were 2 steam rooms: a Salt one (awesome...bucket of salt you could use to exfoliate... and for some reason a lot hotter than the other steam room) and an Herbal one, which didnt smell too herby.\n\nI liked the 3 tubs Hot, Warm and super icy Cold.  Something refreshing about stepping from a hot tub to totally submerging yourself in an icy cold bath.\n\n\nBottom Line:\nPrepare well for your trip to Imperial.  Enjoy a few hours (I did 5 and a half... could have easily stayed longer).  Bring gym shoes (if you want) and some reading material. Try the food.  Get a scrub. Not in that order."
