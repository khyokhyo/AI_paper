The steak and baby back ribs were dry and average in taste.  The corn bread was bite sized and tasted terrible. Waiters didn't refill drinks, and never asked if we needed anything.  Don't come here, there are much better choices."

There was a cover charge of $10 for this weekend only. Otherwise entry to the saloon is free. There is a separate entrance for the restaurant and the saloon. we were seated quickly. they had a variety of choices on the menu. I ordered the BBQ hotlinks with japalpeno cornbread, BBQ beans and creamed corn. LOVED the creamed corn. The beans were a little tart for my liking. I should have sent the hot links back. They were cooked to a crisp. Usually hot links have some juice but this had nothing at all. The hot links sat on top of a piece of bread with grilled onions and tomatoes. I had one link and shared one with the others in my group. after dinner, we paid our cover charge and headed into the Saloon. they have one bar, the bull riding and a large dance floor. there are tables in the back of the saloon and chairs along the bar. The saloon is also where the kitchen staff is cooking the food. Usually its behind a wall hidden. i should have asked about my hot links :)"

The bartender was friendly and chatty, and service was good.  I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, and it was very good.  Not too spicy, cooked well, and the sides were nice.  Obviously this place has a country, honky-tonk feel and I imagine it gets pretty kickin' on the weekends.  Prices were actually very reasonable, especially for Vegas, and most importantly the beer was cold (no Gilley's brand beer, though, and no Mickey sightings!).  Tons of souvenir items in their own souvenir shop too."

            "review": "Stopping in was definitely on my list of things to do while in Vegas since I haven't had a chance to make it the one in Texas. There was hardly anyone there in the afternoon and they had lunch specials going on (till 3pm). The place itself is pretty big, apparently they have line dancing lessons in the evening and then it a full blown dance hall at night. I got the lunch special with the pulled pork sandwich, the chips were homemade and were very good. Light but still crunchy with just the right amount of seasoning. The nachos were HUGE definitely enough for a few people to share. They didn't have as much Gilley merchandise as I'd hoped to find in the store. Glad we got to go!"

The bartender did not serve up service with a smile.  He asked us what we wanted to drink.  When I asked him what the specials were he responded and I didn't hear the second thing he said so I asked him to repeat.  He seemed truly annoyed and put out by this.  I guess when you mix overpriced drinks with drunk tourists you don't really have to smile to get tips?  \n\nThe happy hour deals weren't that great - 3 dollar drafts or an extra shot in your well drink, which was regularly priced.  There's a big dance floor, stage for live music, and a mechanical bull.  Seems like this place would be pretty fun at night but won't go out of my way to check it out."

            "review": "We came here when we were in Vegas for Memorial Day weekend. We saw the sign for Bikini Bullriding and decided to check it out. Why not!? \n\nIt's a pretty big place with an open kitchen, large dance floor, stage, mechanical bull, bar with tables, and both indoor and outdoor seating. We arrived around 10:30 on Sunday night and found one \"stool\" at the bar. That's in quotes because the seats are actually saddles - love it! Shortly after, we scored a table right by the dance floor and center stage. Nice! \n\nWe only ordered drinks since we had already eaten, but the food I saw looked good. The drinks were good - not necessarily strong, but not totally weak either. There was a band playing and singing country music (my favorite!), and people dancing. When the bullriding started, we didn't have the closest seat but a drop-down screen replaced the band on the stage, which gave us a pretty good view. The riders were just customers that had signed up or been coerced - not professionals or the staff (like we initially thought). The girls stripped to their bras/panties and rode the bull. The true winner was robbed as she was the only one who lasted without falling, but the audience chose the other girl (who fell off) instead.\n\nThe bar area is self-serve, which isn't my favorite, but the bartender made it good. He remembered our drinks and the name on the card each time, even though he was busy. He was very friendly and also gave us a round of drinks to go in plastic cups when we were cashing out. Why can't more places be like Vegas!? \n\nHighly recommend and I will definitely be back next time I'm in town!!"

Doubt I'll go back.\nGreeted fairly quickly by a friendly young lady.\n Seated in a great seat overlooking part of the strip...right by window.\nThat is where the 'good' ends.\n I asked for a child size salad as I usually am too full from a full sized  salad to eat an entree.At all restaurants I have been to, this request is accommodated. It is not a difficult. Just choose a smaller dish.The server told me they do not make child size salads.I asked why she could not put it in a smaller dish. She just said 'sorry.'\n My chicken was so bland. It was supposed to have chipotle but there seemed to be none on it. The avocado was scooped onto one side of the burger so I got big chunks in one bite and none in the next. I finally poured hot sauce on the chicken and ate just that.\nMy husband left half of his burger as it was tasteless...no salt, no flavor at all.\nWe were in a  huge rush to make it to a show and as a result of having to wait for a table we had no time to waste waiting for a manager.\n I DID tell the server of our disappointment. She was polite and apologized but that was all.\n$82 later and not satisfied. Pretty sad.\nWill not recommend to our out of town guests."

We figured maybe we would have better luck getting a table. We stood in line at the hostess center, where there was one party of about 6 ahead of us. I'm not sure what was going on, there was a lot of back and forth between the party(who I don't think spoke great English) and the hostess, but we waited our turn for 5 minutes or so, while doing so the line behind us grew even longer of people waiting. At no point did the hostess even look up at any of use, and since the party of 6 was still in front of us, we waited. From the other door a couple walked up around the waiting party, and asked the hostess about seating, and she put them down!!! UMMM Excuse me??? You have a line of people waiting honey, why don't you try looking up! \nNeedless to say we left, plenty of other choices in Vegas, although I think it's important to point out, we looked in the windows after leaving, and there were plenty of open tables.

But I practically had to climb over the bar and serve myself.  A wait is to be expected in a crowd, but the place really wasn't that busy. And the all of the staff members behind the bar had their back to the patrons.  I don't mind waiting while they help the other customers, but I kind of take issue when they're not helping anyone.  That said, I will likely chalk it up to a one-off night, and give them another try when I am back in town.  Because, hey, where else can you do bull riding on the strip?!"

We chose to sit in the bar and there were four of us.. a young couple in mid 20's and my husband and I in our 40's so it wasn't like we were rude or obnoxious.  There weren't a lot of choices to sit close to the bar and the waitress told us to sit anywhere so we had to take a table away from the bar where her and another waiter just stood talking.  We waited for about 5 minutes and no one ever came over to take drink/food orders so we got up and left. There are so many places to choose from in LV that customer service should be top notch.  This bar is located right outside TI so we went inside and ate at Khahunaville  where we were treated like valued patrons."

It was around 10 p.m. on a Sunday night, it was pretty dead, lots of empty tables. We were seated immediately and shortly after a little bit a man came to take our drink orders. A little while after, a woman came to take our order. A normal wait time, then a food runner dropped off our food and asked if we wanted more beverages, which we did. The man never came back and was waiting on other tables, but, the woman never came back either until it was time to pay the bill. \n\nThe food was pretty bad. We ordered a giant pretzel, which was ok, not great, but edible, and salads. The salad I had was chicken, apple, spinach, blue cheese, dried cranberries, with a tangy vinaigrette dressing. My friend ordered a chicken ceasar salad. My salad was so drenched in dressing I couldn't taste anything other than dressing. It was basically the taste of the dressing with different textures. It was just unpleasant. My friend's salad was also bad, huge globs of dressing with wilted romaine lettuce.\n\nThe worst part is that we could never have even asked for something else, complained, or anything because the waitress never returned to ask about our meal, refill or offer more drinks. She just dropped off the check and that was that. \n\nNext time I come to Vegas I will not be stopping here for anything at all."

But that didn't stop people..mostly women from gettin their party going. They of course played country music the whole time. They also have lessons which was funny to watch the people try to learn the moves. My favorite part was watching the girls riding the bulls. It's always the ones that should not ride that do. The bull operator likes to get the bull to do this jiggly thing that of course causes the girls to jiggle. Mildly amusing. Guys will love it..how can ya not?

Although the ambiance was fun, the food left a lot to be desired. \n\nI ordered the fried catfish. The portion was HUGE, but the fish was not fresh at all. They were basically pieces of catfish dipped in batter and then fried. The first piece I had I couldn't eat. They left on the dark meat and if the chef knew what he was doing, he'd know that that's where the blood is concentrated in the fish, making it taste fishy. I ditched that piece and ate one with only white meat, and it was obvious that the cat fish was not fresh. It tasted like it was frozen or has been sitting out for too long. They also overcooked their corn on the cob, which is something that annoys the daylights out of me when it comes to most American restaurants. \n\nMy boyfriend had brisket, which he didn't seem to be too happy about. I tried a piece and it was a little dry and hard, not moist, melt-in -your-mouth, fall-off-the-bone like a proper bbq should be. \n\nHowever, I will give them props on their hush puppies, which were delightfully flavorful. I also enjoyed the green bean casserole, but I could've easily made that at home...  \n\nI don't agree with having to pay a cover charge to stand in the dance hall... even though we ate there. So, we didn't get to watch any bull riding. Will not go back again."

There was a group next to me (obviously locals or friends of Mike) who were extremely rude and drunk. I was waiting for my sister to finish dancing with some guy and out of nowhere these girls are yelling at me, stating that their group was sitting there. I hadn't spoken a word to them at this point. So, I apologized for sitting down on the edge of an empty spot. I also told them there was no need to yell at me. The security guard, Matt came up and saw that I was just sitting there and these women were acting all crazy and yelling at me, yet Matt made me move.  Then my sister and I watched as he was laughing with these women after. Very unprofessional and discriminatory. I have never been treated like this. I will never go back.

            "review": "Let me start off  by saying this place is BAD with a capital B. I was in Vegas last week, the weather was awesome, the entertainment and the food were all great up until the point we stepped into this place. It was our last night  in Vegas and last dinner, so my father in law picked this place because he heard it was a bbq rib place and that's what we craved. We had tickets to a comedy show later that  evening so we left 2 hours earlier so we could have dinner. We parked at Mirage hotel next door and we walked over to Treasure Island (thats where the restaurant is located) MIND YOU ON THE WAY OF PASSING MANY GOOD PLACES TO EAT ---California kitchen and the deli Joint in Mirage.. When we first got there we passed through a bar where people were taking cowboy dance lessons, there was a bar, dance floor and a bull riding area. We walked up to reception and she stated it would be a 30 minute wait meanwhile I could see in the backround empty tables. So went back to the bar area, had a bear and was listening to an annoying dance instructor, left, side step and so on so on, over and over. After 20 minutes we went back to see if they had a table and she said it might be another 35 minutes but, she stated if you sit at the bar you can be seated right away and you can eat there. Even though I don't like to eat at the bar we were pressed for time as it was already 8:05pm and the show started at nine so we dicided to take the bar area. When we get there we were greeted by Kimi the bartender/waitress, she asked if we would like something to drink and I got an ice tea and a beer for my father in law.When we were in there we noticed multiple empty tables, so my father in law tried to mentioned if we could sit at one. She stated that we would have to speak to the hostess and said \"we were confusing her\"--dumb waitress syndrome.......Anyways we oredered ribs/pulled pork combo with a side of baked beans and mac and cheese...We waited another 25 minutes as it was 8:35 pm and we had 25 minutes to spare. I asked the other bartender Liz if she knew when are food was coming. So Liz went to our original waitress Kimi (literally 2 feet away from us ) and asked about our food, Kimi then stated \" it is really busy\"---sarcastically. She went in the kitchen came back and stated to us \"the ticket is still on the board,there is nothing I can do, sorry\" sorry was very sarcastic. We recieved our food at 8:40 pm, when we got there an hour earlier, finally. First of all I felt rushed and the food really sucked. Let me elaborate  on that the ribs were cold and tuff, the beans were blah, the mac and cheese was horrible and the pulled pork was on a wet piece of bread (awful). I tried everything but, I couldn't eat---it was that bad. 90% of waht they served me was left on the plate. They asked me how was it, we stated it was awful...At that point we asked for the bill and they went on to speak to the manager. They spoke and came back with the bill. They only charged us for the drinks and I asked were was the food on the bill, they stated we took it off _---which was a nice gesture but, we still tpped 11.50 as the bill would have been approx $55 dollars and they only charged us 8.50 for the drinks. At that point they \"the waitress\" ignored and gossiped about us two feet away from us as if we were deaf and did not acknowlede us on the way out as we still stated thank you. Note: the manager was out socializing with one table before the incident as I observed him taking pictures and with no mind of the action as the restaurant was full by this point and he did not apologize to us, rather he went to sit right back at the same table after the waitresses spoke to him---poor mgmt skills.....Kimi should not be in customer service---probably the worst service ever and attitude galore. The manager/owner is to blame in all of this as he's running a train wreck waiting to happen...DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT ----IT SUCKS\nDO NOT RECOMEND NOT TO MY WORST ENEMY--If I could give a 0 star I would as it is not deserving of even one star, poor food, poor service, poor management....With so many good places to eat in Vegas this place is on the strip and a tourist trap--It gives Vegas reputation a shot in the gut...."

During our wait we were amused by the popularity of the \"bullride\". \n\nI'm somewhat surprised the place is still in operation but then again, nothing is surprising about Las Vegas."

Any place that you can sit on a saddle, eat ribs, and drink a Lone Star is allllright in my book.  Came here over the weekend, as we were walking by, and could not pass it up.  Snagged a perfect table outside to people watch, and ordered some Lone Stars.  I opted for the pork sliders with crispy onion strings on them, and couldn't even eat all three. My friend ordered the Nachos, and the waiter who brought them muttered \"Good Luck!\"  Those babies were HUGE! They were a mountain of cheese, nacho chips, jalapenos, sour cream, and guac.  They were YUMMY!  The service was good, and the crowd diverse.  They even have big beers that come in a big boot shaped glass.  Country music played, and the bathrooms were pristine.  On Sundays, they have bikini bull riding, and in the evenings they have country cover bands.  I will be back!"

Haven't had dinner or anything over there yet.\n\nPros:\n\nIf you go early-ish (before 7:30/8) it is fairly easy to get a table, especially earlier in the week. Waitresses are also fairly attentive, again, the earlier in the week the better.\n\nNo cover! I hate hate hate paying covers. They also have pretty good drink specials\n\nI have never been on the floor when it was too crowded to dance. Have certainly come across your typical drunk chick doesn't know what she is doing type dancers, but overall there is room to get away from those people and not be squished against the person next to you.\n\nIf you get a table next to the bull, you not only have easy access to the dance floor, but great people (on bull) watching as the night progresses.\n\nDance lessons M-F at 7pm. \n\nMusic is a reasonable, can carry on a conversation at your table, volume\n\nCons:\n\nCan be loaded with tourists, which can make you feel like an animal being watched in a zoo while dancing...maybe that is just an issue for me though\n\nEveryone (tourists, regulars, waitresses, etc.) will walk straight across the dance floor, which is generally know to be fairly bad etiquette. When the floor is empty, it isn't the biggest deal but I have turned during a dance and nearly taken out a bus boy walking right through a line of dancers. \n\nFloor is so-so, fairly sticky as far as dance floors go.\n\n\nOverall, I like Gilley's. The older I get, the more I appreciate the more laid back, not as loud, not charging you for everything under the sun, not being slammed into by barely conscious club girls vibe that is getting more and more difficult to find out here. Keep in mind that kids are allowed here until 10pm, which may bug people, but there have never been that many kids there. I think the general family friendliness is part of what keeps the \"club\" crowd away, so I'll take it."

We went there for Sunday brunch before heading home. We did not have high expectations, and yet, it was really disappointing. To drink we had Bloody Mary's - $10 each and were so SO basic... not strong and only tasted like gross tomato juice. And to eat, we shared the Pulled Pork plate, with a side of the Jalapeno Tots and Mac & Cheese. It was just sad, like they don't even care about the flavor or quality of the food AT ALL. The pork was luke-warm and lacking any flavor whatsoever, piled atop a piece of mushy bread, which I think was supposed to be Texas toast, but was basically just some soggy goo under the meat. The Jalapeno Tots were pretty tasty but clearly just something out of the freezer that was thrown in the deep fryer. The Mac & Cheese was beyond flavorless and totally mushy and overcooked. We were sharing a plate and didn't even bother to finish our food. On the bright side, the waitress was nice and the water wasn't terrible. The decor was kind of fun and the concept is a good one. I left thinking it was just too bad... it takes almost as much work to make bad food as to make good food... Anything worth doing should be done right!

Asked for a drink in a (cowboy boot), \"they only serve that in the restaurant\". Ok now we sit diwn to eat..\nFirst guy came and grabbed our drink order..20 min later a different guy brings our drinks. Brought my drink in a red boot, and my wifes in blue. Handed us the wrong ones. Get our cold ass food about 30 minutes later. No lie. We came 2.5  hours early and damn near missed the opening of our show at TI. Waiter was supposed to bring us water..Brought it about 10 munutes after our food. He never came back after that. We waited another 20 min after we finished eating before we waved him down for the check. Very disappointed,  was not worth $100 for 2 meals and 2 boot drinks. Save your money for McDonalds on the strip, their service is 100% better. Also dont buy a boot drink and try to take it to your show. They will make tou chug it or toss it. At least Mystere did."

It's the quality of the experience that matters in a casino bar.\n\nGilley's is known primarily for hosting bikini bull ridin' on its mechanical bull (Thursdays & Sundays at 10pm).  And I have to applaud them for the showmanship.  Vegas runs on skin.  And putting skin up on a bucking mechanical bull draws a crowd.\n\nThey have other nice touches to drive home the country bar feel.  Bar stools have been replaced with saddles (with stir ups for your feet to make sure you don't topple over after one too many shots).  There's country music and dance floor that gets going some nights.  The drinks are served up at casino prices which are a little high for your average country bar, but you're paying for the real estate--drinkin' on the strip ain't cheap.  \n \nAll in all, it ain't a bad bar, just a little overpriced for what it is.

I haven't been to many (if any) country-western bars before, so this being my first one, it did not disappoint, appearance-wise. Saddle-seat bar stools, a mechanical bull, loud country music and several televisions playing the corresponding music videos for the songs, plus a decent-sized dance floor with a few people two-stepping. The waitresses were wearing bikinis with chaps and cowboy hats, which I guess is the 'Vegas' spin on country attire, lol. \n\nAnyway, we spent some time in the bar area while waiting for our table, but we didn't order anything. The food smelled great though, and we were looking forward to our meal. But, that's about as good as it got for us.\n\nWe were seated and it took a while for the waitress to come around and take our order. Then we ended up waiting a for what seemed like nearly 40 minutes for our food to arrive. The waitress stopped by and said the reason for the delay was that one of us ordered salmon, so the other 3 plates were ready, she was just waiting for the salmon to be cooked. Umm, ok. So, when our food finally came out, 3 of the dishes were only luke-warm, having been sitting out, waiting for what must've been 20 minutes. I would assume that if the kitchen knew the salmon was going to take longer to prep, wouldn't they start that dish FIRST, and the others later, so that all our orders came out together - and hot? We could've sent the 3 other dishes back, but by the time everything finally arrived, we were too hungry to bother.\n\nAs it was, we were all disappointed, not just with the service, but with the food itself. The ribs were overcooked and very dry. They looked and tasted burnt. The salmon was alright, but it's pretty hard to screw-up salmon. The mashed potatoes were good, but that wasn't enough of a plus to redeem the failure of the BBQ. I've eaten at many other BBQ places before...and this place had the worst ribs and BBQ I think I've ever had. Couple that with the slow service, and Gilleys was a disappointment all around."

She then proceeded to strip down and ride the bull like a pro.  She hasn't ridden it in a very long time?  I saw her there the night previous to that riding it and then doing some well-choreographed line dancing.  This girl clearly works at Gilley's in some capacity.  Which is fine, I understand that they need to have some kind of a \"show\" for this type of thing, but what bothers me is the girl made it to the final 3!  What if she had won?

Let me put it this way, the chili cheeseburger was NOT cheap.  At $18 for a cheeseburger and a $2.49 upsell for onion rings it was.. just wow. Add a Diet pepsi on top of that and now Lunch is over $25.00 and more than I intended. \n\nHowever, the service was quick and polite, the food was good and filling and all in all, it was a good experience"

The atmospher was incredible, the food was equally incredible but inexpensive.  At the same time you would get massive amounts.  It was the kind of place that you would get gallons of beer while your mouth watered over the incredible bbq smell wafting from the kitchen.  We would make it a point to visit several times during our stay.\n\nNow, 4 years later, we were thrilled to know that it opened up again at TI.  It was the very first stop we made when we arrived in Vegas.  Honestly, we were disappointed.  It lost its charm, it appeal, it became commercial.  The food was decent but defiantly more expensive.  You could no longer choose from a huge list of burger toppings to personalize your burger.  The portion sizes were smaller and the prices significantly higher.  The menu had a very limited selection as well.   \n\nThe area the resembled the old Gilleys the most was the area right as you walk in.  However, they had the music turned up so loud you would have to yell at the person right next to you just to have a conversation.  Not something I would like to do.  \n\nHonestly we were very disappointed.  We were longing for the charm of the old place.  I could have gone to Applebees and been just a pleased."

The hostess said we'd have to wait 20 minutes yet there were plenty of empty tables. My husband peered his head into the restaurant as he was hinting to the fact of noticing the open tables. The hostess then spoke up and explained that a few waitresses were on break and that she couldn't seat anyone in those areas until they returned. We decided to wait it out \n\nThe hostess was accurate in her estimation..it was just about 20 minutes before we were taken to our table. This is another restaurant in Vegas that offers street side seating. I love to people watch so this was perfect to me. I ordered the blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich and a salad. Oh my...was I pleasantly surprised! One of the best sandwiches I had ever eaten. It was sooooo good! My husband tried it and agreed which is surprising because it wasn't fried. He is a fried fish guy all of the way! He had even said that he wished he had ordered it. \n\nThe salad was made with an assortment of dark, healthy, fresh, greens and a homemade vingearette. It was delicious. The meal was around $20...a bit high...but it was a great meal...great scenery, no regrets. I'll also mention that the waitress was great!\n\nI rounded up to 4 stars because upon first appearance, I didn't expect to have such a good meal here. I thought it would be mediocre at best. I'm glad that I was wrong."

            "review": "I tried out this bar/restaurant while staying at Treasure Island in Vegas.  This place is located inside the hotel but also has two parts.  This place touts itself as a place that has a Hooters theme with a cowgirl twist.  Basically, they have servers dressed in bikinis and chaps serving you food and drinks. The kicker though is that they only seem to work the back side of the place where there is a bar/dance floor area.  If you are looking for that you probably should ask to be seated in that part of the restaurant.  The funny part is if you're entering from the inside of the hotel that's the area you walk into...the actual restaurant looking place is located a walk down past this part which takes you to the actual front part of the place which you can also enter from the street side on the strip.  Here the servers are wearing a cute little get up with jean shorts and a black halter top shirt.  So when I actually ate at this part of the restaurant I thought it was odd they were advertising chicks walking around in bikinis serving you food when there was none actually working this part of the place.  It wasn't until I left I saw those severs working the bar/dance floor area.  Maybe they have stricter rules on attire on the front part of the establishment since it is on the Vegas strip?  Anyways on to the food review...I had the southern style fried chicken with butter whipped mash potoates, and coleslaw.  It was a good meal and a lot of food.  The hostess who I checked in with told me it was 15 minute wait but I also made a note to look down at the waiting list and literally saw one name.  She recommended I sit at the bar for no wait which is what I did.  Funny because when I panned around the room there were quite a few empty seats...I think she was just too lazy to actually look for a seat for me to be honest.  Good thing I didn't tip her.  The bartender ( a dude) was nice enough and got to me pretty quickly.  The manager also checked in with me and saw if I liked my meal which I did.  At the end I got the wrong bill but the tender caught his mistake and gave me the right one.  However, when checking my credit card info a few days later I was double billed with my bill and that wrong one.  Still waiting to see if that wrong bill actually gets charged on to my account as its pending.  Overall, the food was good, the hostess could use some work, the tender was cool except for that mistake.  If you're specifically looking for the servers wearing bikinis and chaps go to the back end of the restaurant inside the hotel.  If you want to eat at the front you'll get more of a cute country chick serving you food."

The chicken strips were just that--frozen animal flesh fried in un-food batter and grease--but the vinegary mustardy sauce sold me.

There are posters all over TI advertising the place, with the girls in their (tiny) black bikinis front and center. My husband and I were looking for a bit to eat on our last night in town and got tired of walking around so we settled on Gilley's. I am an avid country music (and western wear) fan, so I felt right at home. You walk through the bar and dance hall section to the restaurant in the back, which has a completely different feel than the front of the establishment. I immediately regretted our choice when I realized Yelp's average was an unimpressive 2.5 stars, but since we were hungry we decided to stay anyway. And boy, am I glad we did!!\n\n My husband had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of the two-cheese mac & cheese, and I had the Gilley's chili with a side of mac & cheese. The chili wasn't at all anything to write home about - a little too thin and runny and the texture of the beef reminded me of Taco Bell. However, the chili came with jalapeno corn muffins which were AWESOME... cakey and dense but not dry with the perfect amount of jalapeno flavor. I ordered two more on the side for $1. My husband made a complete mess of himself eating the pulled pork sandwich, declaring with confidence that it was easily the best one he had ever had. While I make dramatic declarations like this all the time, he does not, so this is quite an impressive comment coming from him. The mac & cheese was excellent, and service was very friendly and prompt. Lona, our waitress, took care of all our requests very quickly. I did leave with an empty plastic boot, which you can get filled with a margarita for $17. Since I wasn't up to being three sheets to the wind 16 hours before needing to board a plane, I opted to take it home empty. It was cheaper than the cowboy boots I had been ogling at Boot Star in Fashion Show the day before! For the first out of two times on our trip, I was glad I didn't heed Yelp's advice and miss out on this one (the second location I almost passed up was Sammy's Beach Bar & Grill at McCarren Airport - see review)"

The sweet potato fries could definitely have been crispier and I would have sent them back but decided it might take too long.

The rest of us sat back and watched and it was very enjoyable. The resident dance instructor was personable and clearly knowledgable and I later learned from another patron that he (Tim) also teaches at other places like a Revolvers, etc...although I'm actually a ballroom dancer I was fascinated to watch the crowd having a great deal of fun in class.

He, his wife and a couple of his friends were coming out to Vegas to participate in a Spartan Race and celebrate his birthday. \n\nThis Gilley's is located inside Treasure Island ( I mean, the T I...) facing Las Vegas Boulevard. I will say, the whole country and western thing ...not really my cup of tea (or sarsaparilla ). But, I am always up for good barbecue if that's what's advertised and so I will reserve judgment (or at least try...). So, its Saturday night and my wife calls to make a reservation, but apparently they only take them for parties of 12 or more...huh? We decide to take our chances and head down to the Strip anyway, and after an hour of waiting we were finally seated (we almost decided to bail and go to Se\u00f1or Frogs next door). \n\nOur waitress and waitstaff were nice and very attentive, even getting my brother-in-law a strawberry shortcake dessert with a candle and singing Happy Birthday to him...I won't get into what everyone ate, they all seemed to enjoy their meal. I will only comment on what I ordered...I usually judge a barbecue joint by how good their Brisket is, so I ordered the Brisket filet which comes with 2 sides. I decided to get the 3 cheese Mac and cheese and BBQ beans, figured you can't go wrong with those ( or can you?)...the beans were a little soft and bland, the Mac and cheese tasted a little gritty (I think the flour in the cream sauce hadn't cooked off maybe and it was topped with unmelted shredded cheese...good Barbecued Brisket is usually juicy, smokey, and kind of melts in your mouth...this Brisket was dried and chewy and way to fatty. Not even the drenching in BBQ sauce could help it, kind of disappointing considering this is a Strip restaurant.\n\nSo then it was on to the entertainment portion of the evening, we took the party over to the club and dancehall part of Gilley's. Just in time for the band to take the stage ( I forget the name, but they were pretty tight), playing what I'm sure are decent covers of today's top country hits. I only recognized the country song that Hootie did (wagon wheel?)...look, there's the mechanical bull! That looks like fun...mm, maybe not. Not drunk enough. Also, a big dance floor for the two-steppin'. Looks like fun...not for me.\n\nIf country, cowboy hats, NASCAR caps, and the two-step are your thing, this place place is for you...I probably won't be back for the BBQ, but I might come back for the bikini and chaps-clad waitresses and the drunken girl \"R\" rated mechanical bull riding."

He freaking allowed his wife to sing rap instead of country that people wanted to dance to. He had no sense of what the crowd wanted. I won't go back for karaoke that's for sure."

This place is nothing like the old Gilleys.. and can't even touch Stoneys in the fun department.\n\nFirst of all, someone please tell me why the kitchen is out in the open right when you walk in...with bright cooking lights shining and only a few feet away from the dance floor. Talk about mood kill. When you are trying to have fun and dance and drink with friends... it's kind of awkward to have an open kitchen right in your face. Just a stupid and awkward set up. The kitchen should be in the restaurant area, not the night club area. \n\nWe did go sit in the back and grab food before we headed to the \"club\". It was just okay. Nothing to write home about. Too expensive for what it is. I got a cajun hamburger and fries, which cost $16. Then, I got a Sangria to drink which was $10. After it was all said and done after tip, My meal alone was $32 bucks. A little ridiculous for one person for average food that wasn't even that good.\n\nI went last night which was a Sunday, so not sure how the rest of the nights are... but this place is 100% country. Stoneys at least breaks it up and will play some booty shakin freestyle dance music every hour or so to change it up, which I like since I don't really country dance well. Unless you are a die hard country music lover, this place probably wont be for you. They didn't even play cupid's shuffle or the cha cha slide. The basic fun and less country line dances that everyone knows and loves.\n\nNow the final straw.. This bikini bull riding. It went on ALL night long pretty much. It consisted of mostly overweight or obese women in bikinis and underwear trying to look sexy on the bull... while the lighting and jiggling of the bull accentuates every dimple and unsightly flaw. I was embarrassed for them. However, this was mildly entertaining, plus there was some fun and nice people there to talk to from a convention that made good company.... so that's why I give 2 stars. \n\nThe old Gilleys was a blast. Had a bigger and better lay out. Had better ambiance and appeal and seemed more with it.. and more like a night club and bar. This Gilleys has the wrong lay out and you are next to a bright kitchen and a small dance floor, and watching the bull is the highlight of the night. It's a shame cause I was excited that it came back but it was an utter disappointment."

In those days Gilleys featured not only a mechanical bull but also bikini mud wrestling. Cold Beer and Dirty Girls was the mantra and it was a trip to remember.\n So my excitement was peaked when i found out that the place had relocated to the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino.  However my excitement was short lived ( as was my peak) when i found out that the dirty girls wrestling in the mud had been replaced with senior citizens line dancing the night away. The term \"titty alert\" which had been used at many a mud wrestling events to describe a fighters wardrobe malfunction had turned into a \"old bitty alert\". To add insult to injury , the only person riding a bull was a thirty something year old male misfit from Brokeback Mountain. So with a broken spirit i had the hostess find the wife and I a table.  She was nice enough to sit us in a spot that overlooked the Vegas Strip, nice, but still not mud wrestling.  Gilleys specializes in BBQ and has always done a good job at it.  After reviewing the menu Simone and I started with Sweet Potato Fries served with molasses ketchup and a maple marshmallow dipping sauce. For some odd reason the marshmallow sauce was a light green ( i dare not ask why). It worked well with the crispy fries and probably would have worked just as well with a peanut butter sandwich.  The molasses ketchup was also good and Simone and I finished it all. For our Entrees Simone tried the house chili. It was average and light on the spice, and reminded me more of spaghetti sauce then it did chili.  I probably could have made some at my own house for a fraction of the cost and it would have been much better and i at least would have served it with some chips. For my own entree,  I choose the Classic Pulled Pork Sandwich. It was a huge portion of pulled pork piled high on a garlic toasted bun topped with creamy coleslaw. The pork was smoked perfectly and had great flavor and moistness.  However this did cause the bun below to quickly get soggy which was disappointing because the bun was very good before it turned to mush.  The fries that the sandwich was served with were some of the best i have had in a long time. They were super thin and super crispy and may have been the highlight of the plate.  Overall this version of Gilleys left me a little dissapointed. It still serves great BBQ ( and good fries) but the other offerings were lacking in flavor. I still prefer the Dirty Girls and Cold Beer days of old. I hope that some day the mudd will return and Gilleys will once again be a little more country and a little more dirty"

Ive eaten pounds of BarBQue at all kinds of Texas BBQ joints and i failed to heed Rule #1: \n\nDon't patronize any BBQ place if you cannot locate the smoker. This place has none and their sucky BBQ and the rest of their food should be avoided at all costs. \n\nI thought because this was Vegas, maybe they carefully disguised their smoke pit as a fake rock or they rigged it to come out one of those pirate ships at T.I. Alas, no. \n\nI ordered the chicken fried steak. It was clearly a frozen rectangle patty and tasted like the kind you would find near a convenience store microwave. In fact, i thought i saw a cook run out the back and cross the street to the AM/PM and then run back. \n\nI don't remember what my wife had. I do remember her saying it sucked and was overpriced. The waitress was always in a hurry and literally threw our plates of food on our table as she zipped by to attend to other customers. I felt like hitting her in the head with my frozen patty. \n\nMuch like the song of the sirens next door and the T.I. pirate show, the menu lures you in with dreams of gastronomical delights. And just like the show next door, your meal ends with a ship battle going on in your stomach because of the poor food quality. \n\nP.S. Gilleys: I wouldn't tout the fact that your menu claims your sausage is imported from Elgin. You re making it sound as if Elgin is this magical, mystical far away place. Its like saying your Budweiser is imported from St. Louis. So what? the rest of your food is imported from the generic food aisle of the grocer's freezer. Will never go back there again."

We ate dinner there and later came back to the bar for the bikini bull riding contest, which was a lot of fun (but we had two friends in the contest so that probably made it more fun than it would have been otherwise). Nice, low key atmosphere with people line dancing when the bull riding wasn't happening. Deejay wasted a bit too much time trying to convince girls in the audience to enter the contest. Drinks were good but nothing special. Eye candy was excellent, even for us girls, who were happy watching the (gorgeous) cowboy-hatted mechanical bull operator. The bull is cute, too, operated in such a way that it seems to have personality."

They have decent drink specials and great live country music with a huge dance floor.  \n\nThis is your typical over-the-top country bar.  It has live country music, mechanical bull riding, and ass-less chaps on the bar girls.  The service was great and the atmosphere is electrifying.  There are always people on the dance floor either doing some line dancing or some other crazy honky dancing. :) \n\nThe wait staff was friendly but the last couple times I have been in there the waitresses have to been getting older and less attractive.  Nothing appealing about seeing a 40-year-old women in ass-less chaps.  Other than that you're going to have a great time here."

We arrived just when they opened at around 11am but surprisingly, the food tasted old, like it's been sitting there for awhile.  The fries were cold and didn't have the reliable crunch factor we were yearning for.  I wonder if they just took the leftovers from the Buffet tables.  The only thing decent was the pulled pork.  The entree costs a whopping $26!  Definitely not worth the money or the calories.  \n\nAlso, the service here sucks!  Older Male Bartender is really snippy, Oscar the grouch and a true @sswipe.  \n\nIf you're staying at Treasure Island, I'd recommend Canter's Deli."

            "review": "I was at this restaurant on the Las Vegas strip this past Wednesday night 6/25/14 to have some drinks and grab some dinner with my wife. She's a big \"Urban Cowboy\" movie fan so we had to give it a try. \nWe were extremely disappointed in the bar and restaurant service. First thing was that they do not offer a small appetizer type menu in the bar. It's strictly for drinking. Ok, no big deal. We hung around to listen to a few of the patrons sing some karaoke while we got familiar with the bar atmosphere. After about 20 minutes we decided to head into the restaurant area to order some dinner. Although it was a slower night, It still took a while for our waitress to pay us a visit to take our order (10 min) She was a semi friendly waitress. While we waited for our meal we noticed a good size bug (maybe roach) walking across the floor near our table. So when she brought our order back, within 8 min, we informed her of the bug and she didn't seemed too surprised. She flagged over a bus boy and told him about the bug. He moved a chair or two and then went about his business. Basically he didn't do anything.\nThe meal was brought out quickly but it had major flaws. The entire meal was luke warm. Like it had been warmed up in a microwave. We had a slab of ribs, macaroni, some cheese tots and a muffin. All the food had basic dull flavors. We decided to go ahead and eat anyways since we were rather hungry and also didn't want to waste more time walking to another location on the strip. I was expecting the meal to be a little tastier based on the description on the menu. I guess that's what we get for expecting.\nIn the end, we informed the waitress about our experience and she did apologize for the experience. However she said we could have told her sooner and maybe she could have had the chef cook us something different. The funny thing is that she didn't pay us our second visit until the end when she brought us our check. Not once did she return after serving us to check how things were or if we needed a refill or anything. Had she returned at least once, she would have been informed sooner. I wouldn't recommend this place to any of my friends. Its one of those gimmicky restaurants and we experienced the faults of it. Oh we'll, that's one to learn from. Sorry Gilley's, the best thing was the Willie Nelson look a like you had singing karaoke that night."

            "review": "I rarely write about my bar hopping adventures since there is normally not too much to say-- I usually grab a drink and move onto the next spot-- but Gilley's definitely left quite the impression. Located off the strip in Treasure Island, Gilley's is the place to be for those who enjoy country music. It has that cowboy saloon ambiance that I don't experience too often where I come from. \n\nWhen the girls and I came in, this bar was packed!! There was even some filming in progress of some country/western/line dancing. I'm not too knowledgable in this field, but it was definitely impressive watching the professionals perform.\n\nSo the reason why my friends wanted to take me here was so that they can see me ride on the MECHANICAL BULL. While we were hanging around the bar, it was so funny that this guy comes by and asks me if I want to ride the bull and that he would pay for it ($10). Not only that, but he buys all of us shots of Fireball to try and convince me with liquid courage. I would have done it either way, but I like being convinced with freebies! \n\nI've been on a mechanical bull before but the place I went to was empty, this place was packed. Not only that but some of the guys here do rodeo professionally. I can't compete with that... Well good thing for me, the crowd was cheering me on. I was reassured that I didn't have to do it well. According to this group of girls near us, it was just hotter watching a girl do it... \n\n1 minute and 16 seconds -- good enough. The crowd was too sweet to be cheering for me. One guy was even like, \"I've never seen that before,\" since towards the end I just grabbed on to the bull's neck to resist falling off. He hasn't seen it before probably because it's not a real rodeo move. I was just trying to hang on for my dear life. \n\nDespite light bruising and my left shoulder feeling some pain from falling off the mechanical bull, my friends and I had a blast. I love the positive vibes and how welcoming and supportive everyone was. Gilley's is a solid spot and I recommend checking it out even if it's out of your comfort zone."

This bar has that. \n\nHere's a bunch of other random stuff I noticed on my visit:\n\nLots of dirty old cowboys doing inappropriate things (spitting beer all over their wives for example).\nA mechanical bull with an operator that knew what he was doing.\nA very authentic country band (very talented, I forget the name, sorry)\nIn a well-lit, country bar, the stereotypes about white people being bad dancers are hilariously true.  I think copious levels of alcohol had something to do with all the bad moves.  \nIf you learn the electric slide, you never need to learn another line dance again, they do it to every song.  \n\n\n\nThis bar reminds me of a lot of college bars around the country:  Same level of intoxication, but more tourists, and less lacrosse hats.  \n\nI wouldn't say I'm looking forward to returning to Giley's, but the staff was very friendly, and there are worse places to spend an few hours on the strip.....Y'all!"

Overall the atmosphere is cool, and they had someone teaching some line dancing routine's which we thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nWe sat down at the small area in the back (which only has maybe 10 tables) and yet were ignored for the first 10 minutes until we walked up to the bar and asked for a waitress. I asked if they were doing happy hour (knowing that at some point in the night they were doing $1 drinks), the waitress said yes and we ordered 3 cocktails. To my surprise she came with 4 drinks -- apparently we ordered at 6:50 instead of 7 so they were BOGO -- at $7.50! We could have certainly waited 10 minutes had I known that was the case. \n\nWe all ordered the vegetarian chili -- which was OK. I hadn't eaten anything all day, so I couldn't complain. We also ordered the sweet potato fries, which to my surprise came with a cinnamon frosting dipping sauce (sounds weird, I know, but it was actually very good!)\n\nAfter we ate we closed the check, but continued to order drinks at the bar. Again, customer service was very meh. When I went to order drinks, I was told I could only order one because \"one drink special for one person\". So all of the girls had to order their drinks separately...which was annoying to say the least.\n\nAt the end of the day, its hard to beat $1 well drinks -- but when visiting Vegas I won't be back for anything else."

The server was nice and was able to put the vegetarian chili on them instead of the meat chili. The problem was that the chips were swimming in a pool of soupy nacho cheese. I love cheese, but I wasn't looking for soup. There was not much else on the nachos, and they left me feeling sick to my stomach. I had a little of my friend's mac 'n' cheese, and it was average; kind of boring. Everyone else seemed to think their food was ok, but nothing special. We were there for a birthday (ok... it was my birthday), and my sister asked if they could sing happy birthday. She was told we had to buy a dessert and then they could do it. That is not a big deal. I have seen that before, but she had not even offered us dessert. So then it was inconvenient. I didn't need to be sung to, but the girls were disappointed in that. There was nothing particularly special or bad about Gilley's, but whenever I leave nauseous, I feel like I have to downgrade it a bit."

After walking the strip for the past few hours  we kept smelling that damned BBQ so naturally with us being from the south (ATL shawty lol) we opted to eat here and get our 'grub' on.\n\nWe chose to sit inside because the restaurant sits literally BTW the boat at T.I. and the boardwalk where everyone walks and I am not a fan of putting on a show while eating. \n\nThe guys ordered a pitcher of beer and the girls got either soda or water. I'm assuming the server was new bc it took him forever to bring our drinks (not beer bc I understand that comes from the bar, but 10 min for water and fountain drinks for 4 people in a slow restaurant is not a good look). The bartender ended up taking our orders and waiting on us for the remainder of the meal. I can't recall what everyone else ordered but I think one of the meals might have either been quesadilla (i can never spell that right) or sliders. But 2 of us ordered the short ribs, including myself and man-o-man was that good. \n\nThe Shot rib (rib because it was only one, and had I not have had two sides I may have been a little pissed off) was prepared the right way, whichever way that may actually be, but the meat fell off the bone! They had variations of sauces at the table people could choose, don't remember the flavors all to well but they were what I would expect from a west coast Vegas-y restaurant, and with my expectations not being set too high for the sauces to blow my mind, I was pleased. My side dishes consisted of baked beans and mac & cheese. Again, my southern roots didn't sway me to expect them to be like moms homemade dishes, I was fairly pleased with them. I give the place a B- simply because I love BBQ and that particular day we hadn't eaten except maybe once and had walked from PH to the N & S parts of the strip all day so maybe my stomach appreciated the meal more than my taste buds.\n\nThe server/bartender whom we saw all of 3 maybe 4 times got the minimum tip from us bc she wasn't as attentive as she could have been esp with it not being crowded at all. And had this not have been Vegas they might not have gotten anything.\n\nThe meals are not cheap, but then again what is 'cheap' in Vegas. Even the McDonalds isn't cheap, but one should expect to spend $$$ when you come here for leisure otherwise, why come right? All in all, I would come again if I have the urge for BBQ. I won't expect the best service, they just better be sure to have my food right."

Wait, what show? We had no idea there would be a show, we just came in on impulse. He said that at 7pm Uncle Cracker would perform! It was already 6ish so we decided to stay. Finally 2 seats opened up at the bar so we grabbed them. Great view of the stage and the TV that showed a close up, right behind us. The bar started filling up quickly.

We were near the Fashion Show Mall and just wanted a place to sit down and get some drinks.\n\nThey have a happy hour menu until 10pm and select cocktails are $7. I ordered a midori sour and it wasn't bad.\n\nI was pretty full from lunch still so I had a side of mac & cheese it was only $4.99. My sister and her friend ordered the sweet potato fries and it comes with a sweet marshmallow type of dip that was really delicious! I highly recommend ordering it!\n\nI saw on a sign that Gilley's has line dancing here! It sounds like it would be fun if you're into that stuff which I'm not LOL\n\nThis wouldn't really be my first choice for a bar or dinner place but we just happened to be in the vicinity and we were too lazy to walk anywhere else. It was just okay."

We went on a thursday night and waited about 15 minutes for a table,  Noticed when we sat down there were lots of open tables so apparently they are short on staff.  An assistant to the server got us drinks right away but then it took another 10 minutes for our server to show up.  We both ordered a half rack of ribs which were touted to fall off the bone.  You have your choice of sides and we both got the slaw and I had grits, hubby had fries.  Both meals came with a tiny and I do mean tiny corn bread muffin.  With BBQ it's all done, all they have to do is serve it.  Took almost  25 minutes and finally the server went and found our meal rather than wait for the folks who were doing the actual serving.  The ribs were barely warm, hard as a rock and the meat did certainly not fall off the bone.  The slaw had no flavor and neither of us ate much of it.  My grits tasted good but were the consistency of wallpaper paste.  Hubbys fries were cold when they arrived.  All in all, a very unsatisfactory meal and I don't recommend this pace to anyone."

The ambiance is fun with country music jamming in the background, some sports channels on the various TVs, and western decor throughout.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty family friendly and the staff is nice too. Our server was always on top of everything and took really good care of us.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I wasn't mind blown but it was enjoyable. Between the two of us, we shared a Cowgirl combo where you can choose from 3 meats and 2 sides. The baby back ribs were delicious and so were the hot links. The half chicken seemed like it was reheated and a bit dry but still edible. My husband ordered the green chile chili but it was not good, and more soupy  than chili. On the other hand, the sweet potato fries were nice and crispy. What I loved most is that it came with two dipping sauces. One was like a ketchup and the other was like roasted/melted marshmallows with a hint of cinnamon? It was delicious and great for sharing!\n\nOverall a good time. My only complaint was that the food took quite a bit to arrive and we were sat near the kitchen where you could heat a loud ringing sound once in a while (the beeping of a broiler when it's ready? I don't know). Still worth checking out and a great place to share your plate."

It's definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say, but I can see how people wouldn't like it. I personally got the pulled pork sandwich, which was different from other ones I've had. It was a lot sweeter, but I enjoyed it. The bread was completely soggy as soon as it was set on the table though, so I was forced to eat it with a fork. The rest of the family thought their meals were pretty good too. The prices were decent for a restaurant directly on the strip and the food was alright. Downside- we asked multiple times if they could change the television directly in front of us to a baseball game. They told us every time they would, but never did. Kind of annoying! Overall, this place is just OK. However, it is a good place to stop at if you're on the strip and want a decent meal and don't feel like spending an outrageous amount of money."

Love the saddles on the barstools, loved the band one night, the crowd was interesting to watch and I'd go back if asked to. They offer discounted or free admission with NV ID (depends on night) and that was kinda cool; Thursday is ladies night. So, if you are into country, dressing in matching cowboy outfits with your homies and/or know the secret dances = you're golden.

My date had the pulled pork sandwich (same sides as me) and loved it.  The portions were generous.  We ate and watched the Sirens of TI (which was kinda lame) from the best seats in the house.\n\nThen we went into the club, which was too crowded.  We had a couple of affordable drinks, got our groove on for a song or two, then left.\n\nIt was a fun evening of honkey tonk - Vegas style - and bbq."

We hadn't made up our minds as to where we'd eat dinner when we happened to wander by, and are glad we did.\n\nEntertainment: It was a Thursday, so ladies drink for a buck in the bar. There was line dancing, bull riding, and with the low cost of alcohol there were plenty of poor decisions to witness and enjoy. We got a lucky table between the mechanical bull and the dance floor, and it was non-stop entertainment. The sound levels were just about perfect, too--they made sure you could hear the music without trying to blow out eardrums in the process.\n\nFood: This surprised me a bit. We got a couple appetizers and split a BBQ combo. It was delightful, and we enjoyed the meal without feeling like we over ate yet again on the trip. The portion sizes were just right in my book.\n\nAtmosphere: Very laid back and casual. Wide range of ages, and not too many recycled prom dresses you generally see most nights out. It was comfortable, and we liked that.\n\nService: Our waitress hustled. She had a lot of customers to serve, but we never felt like we were forgotten. Orders were filled quickly, even my soda cup (I'm not really a drinker) stayed topped off. I didn't need the somewhat sexy uniforms to make me enjoy the place, but most importantly they didn't detract from the service by feeling sleazy. That's a very difficult balance, and it was great to see how they pulled it off successfully. To some degree, showing the extra skin meant they weren't sweating so much as they hustled around the bar.\n\nMy wife and I are certainly fans. Our total bill came up under $60. We'll be back on a future visit to Las Vegas."

Maybe it was the lover of country music in me, the fact I've walked past it's adorably-themed exterior, many times on the strip, or because the words meat and BBQ, ring louder than other food words. Yet, the 3-stars, should have made this Elitist, think again. \nWe walked in on an early Saturday night, and was pleased it was just a 10 minute wait. We were told to head to the bar, for a drink if we wanted, while we waited. \nThe bar area is pretty cool, with actual saddles for sitting on, tables, a mechancial bull, restrooms, and a large dance floor. We \"saddled\" up to the bar and watched as a busboy and at least 2 bartenders paced back and forth, with no one even greeting us, despite them being slow! No joke, it took over 5 minutes before someone DID take our drink order, and once we received the beer and Cape Cod, the buzzer went off, to be sat for dinner. We headed to our table.\nNow, during a meal rush, I don't expect everything to be immaculate, but it was a turn off to literally sit down with a straw wrapper, sugar packet and other table debris, right near/under my feet. I just kicked the crap aside and shook my head. It take 5 seconds with a pooper-scooper, people. Show some pride, in your establishment. \nOur server was \"pleasant,\" but not a happy lass and definitely wanting to get-through the end of her shift. She did point us out to ordering the combo with 2 sides, and splitting it, since we weren't that hungry. My boyfriend and I picked the Tri Tip, Brisket of beef, Creamed Corn, and Green Beans. The green beans were good, the creamed corn was delicious, but packed a kick (if you aren't into spicy dishes), and the meats okay. Despite them being marinated previously, they did need more and I like how there were several sauce bottles to choose from. That always grosses me out though, as I imagine people coughing, sneezing, licking their fingers and then touching the communal, plastic, sauce bottles. The jalapeno cornbread was too dry and flaky. Kinda awkward to eat and continue pinching at, after dissolving from its cupcake liner. It needed a butter and/or honey packet with it. So simple, not to expensive, but would have helped it go down. \nFor the price, I likely wouldn't dine there again, but would visit the nightclub part."

I now feel the pain of the \" be careful what you wish for\" theory. \n\nI popped into Gilley's at TREASURE ISLAND for the \"first night of business\" aka #epicfail\n\nAs my friends and I were in line, we were notified by the \"host\" (guy in black polo indicating security) that there was a $20 cover, but free if we are guests in the hotel. Luckily, my friends were indeed guests at the TI and I snuck in with them. No way in hell I am paying cover for a bar inside a hotel...especially since it's not a club.\n\nNext...why should I be paying cover for a place that hasn't even had it's grand opening yet? And shouldn't a complimentary cocktail ticket be in order? SOMETHING...ANYTHING?\n\nOnce we got in, we were introduced to a large dance floor a few people were line dancing. I'm not going to slam this place on it's \"culture\" because we chose to come to this \"country\" themed bar. But this place was kind of empty. Lame. Fail. Get me out. \n\nNext to the dance floor, there is a gigantic mechanical bull, where cougars, and less than attractive women pay five or so dollars to ride it. Fun for a little giggle. My friends rode the bull, and we took pictures. It was fun.\n\nUnfortunately, the drunken messes before and after my friends, made the mechanical bull less of a novelty for tourists, and more of a shaming device for men and women who need a bull to feel \"wild\". I'm not going into this any further...use your imaginations. This place needs a better crowd...especially for the first night.\n\nOn to the drinks. Beer selection is your usual Budweiser garbage. No craft beer. Drinks are reasonably priced. A friend got a tequila shot (double) for $13. Beers are about $5. Reasonable for Vegas I suppose.\n\nMy real \"beef\" with this place isn't the bad beer, the crowd or the line dancing to Lady Gaga (yes, it really happened, and I have video). \n\nThe fact that this was \"opening night\" and they were willing to charge people a $20 cover is disturbing. Also, they should have packed this bar with the plethora of girls and dudes that stayed at TI....this is spring break season. \n\nI'm no crystal ball or anything, but I don't believe this place will be in business long.\n\nIf you want the novelty of riding a mechanical bull, do it now, before this turns into a better, cooler joint.\n\nBefore I go, I do want to point out one thing. There are hot girls here, but they are the shot girls, and servers. It was all great for the usual \"ha ha\" the girl is wearing chaps. But it got old when this place was so dead, that these girls were dancing with hammered patrons. Count. Me. Out. \n\nPeace.\n(drops microphone)"

The top was crunchy, the breading was crumbly, and there were bits of jalapeno and corn kernels embedded throughout this heavenly yellow cake.\n\nMmmmm, that was a lot of food...BBQ slathered rack of ribs, slow cooked pulled pork on texas toast, Louisiana spicy sausage, and half of a rotisserie chicken.  The ribs were my favorite and the sausage was good drizzled with the sweet mustard sauce they have caddied on the side.\n\nI've never had grits before and the cheesy ones that we ordered will be hard to top.  The green bean casserole was great too.\n\nRide the bull if you dare and sit cowboy style at the bar with your feet resting in stirrups and your bum on a saddle.  A very interesting atmosphere and really good BBQ!"

Even The Wynn, most hyped of major, mainstream spots for being vegan-friendly (Mr. Wynn is vegan and reportedly Tal Ronnen, of the wonderful all vegan Crossroads Kitchen in LA, created vegan dishes for The Wynn's various eateries) was a total disappointment, with just one labeled item at the buffet (there were other items, but I needed a staffer to point them out and had to ask for specially prepared stuff --- in fact, first person I asked actually said \"we have tons of vegan options like... this lettuce?\"). \n\nShockingly, Gilly's of all places was the best! They feature a vegan entree of gardein really nicely prepared with BBQ sauce and tons of perfectly cooked veggies, including absolutely perfect garlicky baby broccoli. Total surprise here.

I came here really wanting to dance, but the only music that was offered was from a live band that wasn't very good. Would have preferred a DJ. I also was surprised by the people here, everyone seemed closer to middle aged. Kind of weird. Considering I'm young and single I would have liked to hang around people my age. The bullriding was fun, but keep in mind it costs $10 per person to ride. I didn't have any food so I cannot comment. Also there is no cover charge. Overall this place has a lot of potential. Just get rid of the band, and advertise to younger people."

Count me in.  \n\nLots of bad to mediocre reviews on Yelp but we had a good experience.  Our server was right on top of things.\n\nAt $19, the cowboy burger is no bargain.  But it was big enough for two semi-hungry people to share and it was well-cooked and delicious.  The fries were great, too.\n\nI can also strongly vouch for the kid's chicken tenders which came with a huge vat of mac and cheese.  The tenders were indeed extremely tender and they tasted terrific.  Plus, the mac and cheese might have been the best thing on the table.  Incidentally, the kid's meal was big enough to satisfy your average Vegas tourist fattie but the menu specifically states that you have to be 10 years or younger to order from the kid's menu.  That's too bad because I would have no qualms about ordering this particular meal myself.  Still, the first wife and I stole early and often from my daughter's plate.\n\nThe drinks were really weak.  I don't think it's my own personal pet peeve when I say that weak drinks suck.  Everyone hates weak drinks.\n\nOverall, it was good grub and we got a lot of it.

Stood at the table while we had to rush to decide what we wanted.\n\nFood came out and it was delicious!

We were having a good conversation and we hadn't finished our meal but were slowing down and the waitress dropped the check. Didn't ask us if we wanted desert or anything. Came back and stared at us until we paid. But we wanted desert! The bread pudding was the most amazing thing ever! It was soooo good. Best thing on the menu\n\nWaitress again dropped the check.

It's conveniently located in the heart of the Strip and typically doesn't have a cover till after 10pm. Gilley's has a restaurant where I've eaten one time several years ago. It's BBQ which is pretty standard for a country bar and the food is good for the price. I had the country fried steak for $17 which came with 2 sides and corn bread. \nMy favorite part about Gilley's isn't the food though... it's the bar. Typically before 10pm there is no cover, and after 10pm the cover is $10 which is pretty cheap by Vegas standards. Get geared up in your cowboy and cowgirl attire and walk on in as there's usually no line. The first thing you'll notice as you walk into the bar is the huge dance floor. Whether you're into swing dancing, 2 step or line dancing, you'll get your fix. The music is almost always country (though some line dance songs aren't country) and sometimes they have excellent musicians that'll play anything you request. If you look past the dance floor, you can't miss the mechanical bull. It's not a rare thing to see girls in bikinis climb on up and go for their 8 second ride. There are contests Thursday's for the guys and Sunday's for the ladies (in bikinis). I believe the payout depends on the amount of contestants and the rides usually cost $10. The actual bar in this place is very long and there's never too much of a wait to order a drink. The one issue you'll find is there may be standing room only if you're looking for a table. The waitresses are showing off their bodies in bikinis and chaps and aren't afraid to hit the dance floor to dance with customers. \nGilley's is a great place to go if you're looking for a bit of country in the heart of the Strip at reasonable prices and great music."

We got a little glimpse of the karaoke night with a pretty cool host. \nI really wanted to try the food because I hear it's awesome but we came pretty late and they had already stopped serving food. The guy and girl at the front were very nice about it though and even threw out some suggestions on where we could grab a bite to eat. Very sweet of them. No Worries though we'll definitely be back to give their food a try. \n\nThe place as clean, bathrooms were clean, the crowd was good, bartenders were great and drinks were on point.

First, the hostess didn't smile at all and seemed like it was a burden to seat us by the window, on a near empty patio. \nWe wanted to sit on the patio to eat, we are told they don't serve food out there. Great. So we sit on an enclosed patio next to a super loud couple having an intense conversation about who knows what, so obnoxiously loud neither of us could even think of something to talk about with each other. Why not seat us on the other end of the patio where there are like 15 open tables?\nThen, we realized that their draft beer on \"special\" wasn't special at all. It was a 12 oz beer for $4, where the usual draft beer is 16oz for $5.50. That's not a special, that's just serving less beer for less money....\n So then we decide to get the bucket of 5 beers for $20. We are told they can only do bud light or 1 other beer in that, and I pointed to the menu where it has a total of 5 or 6 choices. The waitress stood corrected and we got another type of beer for the bucket, fine. \nWe ordered food, it was fine as well. \nWe finish our food, take our beers to move to the patio, and are stopped and told we can't go out there until our bill is paid. Even after another employee told us it was fine. Wtf? Just bring us our bill out there?\nSo dumb, felt like we kept hearing \"no\" for everything, even thought about asking permission to go to the bathroom."

Arrived with no reservations needing a table for 9, was told the wait would be 40 minutes which was what I expected and the entire paty hadn't arrived yet. Literally saddled up to the bar (bar stools are saddles) for a cocktail while we waited and about 5 minutes later our table was ready. We weren't. Asked for 15 more minutes and right on time the table was ready. Great choice of stick to your ribs southern cowboy food. I ordered the grilled chicken breast with sauteed vegies and white c/ddar/green chile grits. Chicken was flavorful with a great BBQ sauce, vegiew were still crisp and the grits were AMAZING! hubby had the fried catfish, perfectly crisp served with hush puppes as well as the two sides, so good. Friends had fried chicken, short rib, baby backi ribs-all were happy. A good portion for the money in Vegas and service was nice, nothing to write home about. Would come here again."

Entertainment was good- if you like watching a bunch of drunk goofs getting thrown from a mechanical bull into a balloon fence (I like that). At one point the guy operating the bull got on and it was pretty cool to see someone who knew what they were doing go for a ride.

The band (Scotty Alexander) was really good, playing a good variety of country favorites and a few of their own originals.  Our table proved worthwhile for some great bull riding viewing of people of all ability (or more accurately inability). Maybe best of all though was our bill after about 4 hours, 4 captain and diets, 4 blue moons, and 2 shots was about $90 with tip. Not bad for drinks considering we were still on the strip. Too bad I am not into light beer much since they had $1 light beer (I think bud light) for sale while the band was playing. Even though the place doesn't have the classic vegas ambiance, this place might be a new go to for me when looking for a no frills, affordable, good night in Vegas."

We didn't have to wait to get a table, and were sat in the semi-outdoor seating...complete with flys. \nI'm sure its hard for restaurants to keep flysout but that doesn't mean it isn't gross. And it doesn't mean that swatting a fly for my entire 45min dinner was any less annoying. \nThe service was alright, the server we had was nice but definitely too used to have food runners and bussers. A huge pet peeve of mine is sitting at a table for a prolonged period of time with dirty plates ( napkins on plates to signify being finished) while the waitress walks by, asks if we need anything thing else and brings and closes our check. The dirty plates where still there when we got up to leave 10 minuets after we received out check from out waitress. \n\nNow, I have been a server for 3 years, so I can understand a bad night, being busy, etc. The real disappointment wasn't the service, it was the food. I just wanted some tasty BBQ. That is not at all what I got. First of all, we ordered the nachos, which were picture in the menu and showed up completely different. They were pictured as being laid out on a plate...they came piled a half a foot high and smothered with all kinds of crappy looking toppings. \n\nSo that happened, we ate what chips we could find that weren't soggy yet and put some toppings on them ourselves. Then our entrees arrived. I got the half of a rotisserie chicken with the mac and cheese and green bean casserole. The chicken tasted OK, but it was cold. The mac and cheese was cold, oily and disgusting...I had no idea you could mess that dish up! The green bean casserole was also cold and gel-like. : / ....My boyfriend got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. His food was super hot(which tells me that mine was sitting in the food window as his chicken was fried) but his sides were crappy too. His chicken was hard as a rock. Needless to say it was gross. \n\nUsually we say something when things go this wrong, but we were late for a show and we dont like to receive free food so we left and vowed never to return."

Just...wow. \n\nHorrible, horrible, horrible. \n\nWe didn't even sit to TRY and enjoy anything- food, drinks, or football- because everyone was just so rude. \n\nWe are from the Bay Area and wanted to watch the Oakland/Detroit game so we put on our A's jerseys, headed to Gilley's, and asked one of the workers if he could change one of the tvs in the corner that NOBODY was watching... He just laughed at us and said \"Who would want to watch THAT game?\" and just walked away......obviously us when we are dressed in Athletics gear and asking you to change the channel. We gave him the benefit of the doubt that he may have been joking...but when you joke with guests/customers, you say something to CONNECT with them, not be a total douche.\n\nSo then, we asked the bartender. He hesitated and said \"umm..I'm kinda busy. Let me ask my manager.\" he comes back and says \"we're not going to change it\" without any reason as to why. \n\nWhat's frustrating is that if we had our boyfriends with us (who were going to meet us half an hour later at Gilley's), they would have changed it.\nUNFORTUNATELY for their waitstaff, my friends, boyfriend, and I all have worked in restaurants for over 5 years. Generally it's a 50% tip we shell out because we know what it's like Even with bad service, we leave 20%. Definitely sucks for them because we LOVE to spend money!\n\nNeedless to say, there will be no next time for us because everyone here was just SO rude. I give 2nd chances. This place doesn't even deserve a 2nd look."

Strange thing was when we were seated, we saw so many empty tables which made us wonder why we had to wait so long...\n\nThen came the ordering - we had to waive them over as it took them a long time to take our order and once they did, we probably waiter another 40 mins for our food to arrive.

Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of BBQ and was very excited to try Gilley's for the first time. I was disappointed from the minute I opened the menu. I must have flipped through it front to back and back to front three or four times because I felt like I was just overlooking a section that listed brisket. Sadly I wasn't overlooking anything. Gilley's does not have any type of brisket whatsoever; not even so much as a chopped brisket sandwich. How can a place with a huge neon outline of Texas on the wall with it's original roots in Houston, TX serve not serve brisket? I know there are a lot of other types of BBQ out there and I am sure I am biased because of the fact the I was born and raised in the Lone Star state, but I have a hard time accepting a BBQ place that doesn't have brisket as at least one of it's offerings. Aside from the disappointment of not having brisket, the food I did have was definitely not anything special. We started off with the \"Texas\" nachos, they must have felt the need to get the word TX in there, but they were just nachos and we're a sad version of them at that. I can't take your nachos seriously when the melted cheese is a liquid you poured out of a can. The BBQ ribs, side of mashed potatoes and corn bread we're decent at the very best. I may visit the bar again at some point, but will definitely be eating elsewhere."

DJ Shaddix is so nice and will play all the line dances that you want. Trent is an awesome bartender and I just need to look at him to get my usual drink!\n\nLine dancing tips:\nWear Boots or something that will slide on the floor. I see so many people try in flip flops or heels and they look like they are going to break an ankle. Ouch!\n2-step is really fun if you have a good leader. On locals night there are a lot of good dancers. So just ask and you can generally get a Yes. \nSome more advanced dancers will add a bit of flare, but the general steps are more basic. Try to follow along or ask someone in between songs to show you off the dance floor or off to the side. Most people are very nice about that. \nGilley's does offer lessons at 7 or 8pm most days I can't remember which.\n\nOn Mondays a few tips. $1 drinks for locals till 10pm. A lot of locals will be there and they are REALLY good dancers. The locals get annoyed with some of the drunk tourists, but at the same time the drunks will get mad at the locals. They claim they need to practice in order to know what they are doing. The locals dance a few nights a week and definitely get their practice in. I agree that the locals on Monday's should be a bit more inclusive of people just trying to learn. I know that I help when I can. I suggest that you try and control your liquor and practice respectfully and don't bump into people. ha ha. Drunk dancing starts about 11pm if that is what you are really into. Or there is a Senor frogs down the way that offers that all night. \n\nOn Fridays a few tips. Bull ride watching on Friday's are my favorite because there tends to be a bachelor or a bachelorette party and they put the person who is the most intoxicated up there. It is $10 to ride the bull. I will not be getting up there. Toughest Man-Bull riding competitions that they do every so often are fun to watch. They also do bikini bull riding on Sunday's if they get enough girls.\n\nThe food is also really good. My favorite is the pulled pork sliders. \n\nA few things that would make it that much more spectacular:\nBetter drink specials on Friday's. For a local, it can get pricey on Friday's.\nI wish you could have food in the bar area after 9pm or at least appetizers."

Alas, here's why I've decided against coming here for my bachelorette party next year.\n\nMy mom, sister, and I were here this past Thursday and out of our entire trip, coming to Gilley's was the one thing on our to-do list. We had previously scoured websites for things to do in Las Vegas that would be different and interesting and not terribly expensive. So imagine our excitement when I stumbled across the website that boasted Thursday Night Ladies Night and free dance lessons at 7pm! We left our hotel down the strip early enough to arrive in an Uber just after 7pm. Having donned our \"Gilley's outfits\" and ready for a good time, we ordered our drinks with the expectation that the Ladies Night Special $1 well drinks and Bud Light Drafts would make our bill 3 dollars for our first round and then we'd learn how to do a country dance. We were heartily disappointed and utterly upset that we paid 23 dollars instead and were so discouraged that we entirely missed the 5 minute dance demonstration (Only 1 dance? C'mon.) Yes, we should have gathered the courage to mention something about the $1 dollar drinks before paying (and I will say that we never got a receipt), but the whole reason we came was to see what Gilley's was about and not break the bank. \n\nWe had sat at a table with our cups and beer bottle empty, ready for another round, but feeling quite deceived...and none of the scantily clad bikini wearing waitresses came to see how we were doing. So I let go of my pride, went up to the bartender, and asked if tonight was Ladies' Night and if that meant $1 drinks. I told her that we paid 20 dollars for ours (plus tip) and that it was no big deal, but that if I wanted to order anything else, would I be getting the deal? At the same time I was talking with the bartender, one of the waitresses approached my mom and sister at the table (or my mom tracked her down. Either way, they were talking to someone, also). The bartender I was speaking with pointed to my table and said that \"oh, they're talking to someone now. I'm sure she can help you with that\" and said it in a way that made me feel like an idiot. Not only that, but it seemed very dismissive, as she walked away and expected me to return to my table, sans drinks. \n\nWhen I took a seat, the waitress said that if we wanted the special, we had to mention it. She, too, walked away. It was clear that we would not be receiving a refund (not that we expected it), but neither bartender, nor waitress, seemed inclined on taking an order from us now that we knew the secret to cheap drinks. \n\nI felt embarrassed and furious that we had planned this amazing time here at Gilley's on our last night in Vegas, and not only had we paid way more than expected for our drinks, but we didn't get to learn how to dance. \n\nWe left in a pretty terrible mood. Customer service was severely lacking. The dance session was bogus. We were drawn in by an advertisement that wasn't automatically applied. And we left upset without a backup plan, having had the expectation that Gilley's would be amazing. \n\nWe tossed around the phrase, \"oh, that's Gilleys\" if something was lame or stupid. \n\nI don't mean to be a sourpuss because the rest of the night turned out great. We spent full price on our drinks everywhere else up and down the strip and had a ton of fun making fun of Gilley's, knowing that no one there probably actually gives a shit how our night started, and that we won't ever be back.\n\nLesson Learned: if there is an advertised deal online, you HAVE to mention it. Don't expect it to be automatically applied. And there are plenty of bars on the strip that have amazing service...there's no reason to stay in a place that disrespects you and chooses not to take your order."

We actually went there twice during our stay in Vegas and overall it was a average bar. There are bars here in Arizona where the girls wear the same skimpy outfits, and drunk girls get on mechanical bulls. \n\nWhen a girl that goes by the man \"cougar\" wins the bikini bull riding contest you know there is something wrong. I love cougars.....hell I love them all, but it's Vegas and that was the best they pulled in that night. \n\nAlso every time any song came on a few people, who I am sure were paid to be there, began the SAME choreographed dance. They took up half of the dance floor, if not all of it, to attempt to line dance to non country songs. It was annoying to say the least."

It was exactly as the three stars shows: A-OK. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't something I would order again. It was very mediocre and the green bean casserole has absolutely no flavor to it. I am a decent bbq critic, and the sauce on the chicken was too thick and overpowering. \n\nThe service was good and they have a place by the bar to plug in your phone.

Thirdly, the price was somewhat comparable to all of the other restaurants on the strip we paid around $50 for the two burgers and two sodas. The restaurant was pretty busy but didn't have a chaotic feel which was good (can't speak for the bar attached as it was pretty chaotic). The only issue we had with our visit was one of the waitresses had such an awful attitude and was very rude and obnoxious to not only us but many other customers. We put in a complaint to the manager whom was very apologetic and handled the complaint both professionally, and sympathetically. Therefore I believe that they still deserve this 5* review!"

Stay on the bull for ten seconds. Maybe like 8 or 9 guys would try it out, and half would be eliminated.

So I felt like a rockstar, totally in my zone here. \n\nFor the qualifying round, the bull is just going to buck up and down in a circle aggressively. Ten seconds can fill like forever if you've never done this before. Keep your body loose, and go with the bull. A shot before riding can actually help.\n\nThe final round is just to see who can stay on the longest. For this, it's just going to come down to experience. Can you handle the bull bucking in a circle, changing the direction before you know it, going high, going low, the crowd roaring, feeling like a boss, going a second longer to win, the chance to feel like a cowboy? \n\nI only won once, but it was one of the most memorable parts of that summer. I had went toe-to-toe with legit cowboys. I was for one night the toughest cowboy."

            "review": "I have wanted to go to Gilley's for a while now for both food and just to hang out and have drinks.  The high prices for bbq made me apprehensive to eat here and the fact they would have a cover charge just to go in and have drinks is always a no go as I do not like going to places that charge cover.  So we finally decided to go eat here and I'm glad we did.  \n\nGot here about 8:30 on a Friday night and had about a twenty minute wait for a table which we used to figure out our order right away.  I had the ribs and my wife had the fried chicken.  You get two sides with the meals.  I really liked the ribs and they had a few custom sauces at the table.  One of which (i cant remember what they had) really went well with the ribs and made them extra good.  The cole slaw and mac n cheese were alright, nothing to write home about and not in the league of smoque in chicago.  My wife really liked her fried chicken.  I thought it was good, I was happier with my ribs.  Overall good food, good service, and will be back to eat again.\n\nTables are really close together throughout the place.  Country videos are played on the screens and are played at a perfect volume to listen and still have a conversation.  Although due to the closeness of the tables I'm sure the table next to me was probably forced to hear my rendition of eric church's hell on the heart.  But i couldnt help it, i love the song.  Overall I liked gilley's and will be back."

That is exactly what happened to me, but my expectations were sadly not met.  Don't get me wrong, you can't ask for a better country bar to break in a newby into the scene, but BBq was just not up to power.  \n\nI got to sample the rack of ribs, the famous brisket sandwich, and the country fried chicken.  All of course accompanied with a symphony of sides; home style mac' and cheese, biscuits, gravy, cornbread, smashed potatoes, and cole slaw.  Everything looked appetizing but tasting it was sadly a whole different story.\n\nRibs that were promised to be falling of the bone were tough.  The brisket sandwich that promised to be famous was infamous for lacking deliciousness, and the country fried chicken.... well that was actually the only thing I took to.  \n\nHowever, there was an upside.  Wait staff was wonderful.  They really know how to give you that warm country welcome.  Drinks didn't cost a pretty penny and it was nice to know that it's okay to have a plastic bucket of beer on your table while you dine the night away.  I definitely will come back for some line dancing, beer buckets, and country karaoke, but won't be visiting the restaurant side any time soon."

They were strong and to the point.  We came in here on our first night in Vegas and put our name in for a table and ended up getting pretty wasted and had a ton of fun while waiting.  They have the mechanical bull going and music and line dancing.  We did manage to get to the restaurant later in the evening and the food was pretty good.  Cant go into real details for you since I had plenty of $1 drinks and really didn't care what I ate, just know I needed to.  The Treasure Island show is right outside however you cannot see anything from here and they even block off the exit that goes out that way during the shows.  I fully recommend coming here if you are a lady on Thursday nights it certainly gets the night started off right.  WARNING it took us 1 day to recoup from this night so don't over do it."

The positives are the atmosphere, food, and staff. Staff was pretty nice, food was OK, nothing too special but overall tasty, and the restaurant was bright and open- offering views of the strip outside the windows. The negative would certainly be the prices. It was certainly overpriced (soft drink + meal around $31 for one person)... but depends on what you order! Will probably be back!"

We had dinner on Friday at Gilley's and I got the buffalo chicken sandwich. Now, I've had many a-buffalo chicken sandwiches, but Gilley's was the best I've had... hands-down. They even topped it with slaw, which made me skeptical at first, but the combination of flavors delivered. \n\nWe sat at the bar and Kimi was tending. She was so great! Very easy to talk to and we had a great time joking around with her. So, if you find your self in the desert and want to eat well and listen to country music... oh, and have a little eye-candy too, then Gilley's is the place for you! It really is a lot of fun! We had a blast, for sure!"

Terrible.\n\nThe only good part about this meal was that I had a beer outside on the first non-oppressive night of the Vegas summer. The bad part is that I chose Gilley's.\n\nMaybe my palate is becoming too sophisticated for this shit, and I really don't want to be that guy. I literally couldn't eat my meal. We started with nachos - it's been months since I've had good nachos. These were covered in black olives, chili, salsa.... nacho cheese sauce. Like - movie theater nacho cheese sauce. It was never my favorite, and it really didn't seem to go right for me with the chili. My parents polished off that plate, though, so what do I know? I asked for a side of guacamole, but it never came. I think that was for the better, though, since I got guacamole on my burger.\n\nSo, I get another beer, because god knows I need it to get through the entree. My burger - in theory - sounded good. Guacamole, jack daniels BBQ sauce, a tasty burger, onion strips... bar food, you know?\n\nGuacamole. Man, I should have known better. Guacamole is tough sometimes... if you fuck it up, you really fuck it up. Gilley's - come on. Take it off your menu. It tasted like old cheese mixed with armpit. I ended up not eating my burger and just polishing off the fries (which were good).\n\nFinal verdict? I'm literally still shitting, and this review has taken me like 12 minutes to write. Not like - just sitting here writing, but sitting here and actively releasing. I'll never eat at Gilley's again. The only way someone could drag me here would be to stare at the waitresses asses and ride the bull at 3AM."

But it was hot and that's more than we could say for the Nachos.  My first bite had sour cream and I thought that's what was cold but my wife Hates sour cream and she said the same thing, avoiding it of course.  I stuck my finger straight into the center and sure enough, cold to the center.  I wish I had taken a picture.  The shredded cheese on top hadn't even melted.  They were kind enough to remove it from the bill but after acting like they might not at first.  I don't trust a kitchen to fix me more after something like that.  The weird part didn't bother me as much but my wife felt strange walking in because they have a sign having you follow the footsteps and it leads you through the dancing and party area.  You can tell lots of add-on construction has been done over the years.  Might be time for a total redo."

We arrived and we were told by security that they had no reservation for us. Needess to say, ms. Robin was off and failed to tell anyone about our reservation. I spoke to the mgr on duty and after having to yell at the guy, we were taken all the way to a back corner where he had towipe dirty tables just so we could have a place to sit(we were promised up front by the dance floor) Then it takes 30 mins to get our designated server and she complained about having to serve us the entire time. To end the night, a stupid female security offcer kept yelling at us to \"Get the F out or she would hurt people\" 30 minutes before closing. Of course they were ok with adding over $100 gratuity for themselves. After our horrible night, we called that robin chick and she made promises to us she still hasnt followed through....

Our first choice was Senor Frogs but the wait there was a 20-30 or 30-45 if you wanted to sit outside. Even though the atmosphere at Senor Frogs looked like fun (there was a live show of sorts), we had build up a hunger from shopping all day long and decided to take our chances on Gilley's. We were seated immediately near the window. We had a great view from the strip there and if we turned around we were able to catch the pirate show. \nOur waitress, Catalina was a very nice girl and when we decided on appetizers she even gave us the advice not to start with the nachos grande plate because it was huge and it will spoil our dinner. So we started with the chicken strips.They were good, crunchy and a bit spicy. We had two dips of choice, one was barbeque and another was ranch. My husband and I usually enjoy the ranch sauce, but this one we kept doubting over. Do we like it or not? We decided that it had weird tangy taste, as if they used a lot of lemon in it. So we emptied the barbeque sauce. \nFor dinner my husband had the baby pork ribs, with a side of corn and fries. I had the steak with the side of corn and fries. The steak was a bit luke-warm when it arrived and I am a very slow eater, so that turned my steak to become a bit cold. It wasn't a big deal for me, the steak still tasted good, but I would prefer a very hot steak the next time. My steak was sometimes a bit too burned, which caused me to scrape some of the burned bits off. \nFor my husband the baby pork ribs slided right of the bone and I could see that he was really enjoying his food. For the side the fries were good, crispy and small very nice. We got two pieces of corn, but the corn was too buttery.\nWe both enjoy our corn un buttered and it had us cleaning off butter from our corn. \nOther than that, we were treated really well, our waitress, Catalina was a very nice woman. \nThe view is nice and fun as well if you catch it around the pirate show. We saw the other ship coming in and battling with the other one. Lots of fun, imagine if you would catch a seat on the patio!"
