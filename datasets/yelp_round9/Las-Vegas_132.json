They were probably one of the worst tasting sushi I've had in my entire life..... Fish was far from fresh, and the rice was definitely not sushi rice. My boyfriend liked their ribeye steak though so that was fine. Service was great. Just avoid their sushi at all cost...."

I asked the waiter if I got the right role since he recommended it. As it turned out, he never had it. Just recommending things on the menu that he has no clue about. Learn the f**kn menu and what's on the menu. Could've done better with a hamburger or something else that looks OK on their menu. Definitely stay away from sushi at this place. I also ordered the wings which were gigantic, but in the end average. I would probably give it a second chance if someone wanted to go there however I wouldn't go there myself again."

The service was excellent, our waiter was very attentive and answered all of our questions.  Our food selections were not so great however.  We started with the edamame appetizer, it was boring no and bland.  Our son had a flatbread pepperoni pizza that looked good and he enjoyed but the side selections were no good.  I had the pork butt Rueben, didn't like it at all.  Just slices of fat with slaw, should have guessed that though.  My husband had the miso salmon.  He said it was bland and flavorless, where was the miso glaze?  Would maybe give it a second chance sometime."

Beautiful hostesses waiting to greet you, awesome waiters, and delicious food! My husband and I had the Valentine's Pre Fixe Menu for two. All I can say is,\"Mmmm\"... Completely satisfied with everything from the appetizers down to the dessert! My daughter ordered the bamboo bites (sushi) and crab cakes, both exceeded our expectations. We were really impressed to see how well the whole staff seemed to operate on such a busy night. Shout out, to our waiter Victor, for the excellent service!"

            "review": "All of the staff was very cold and unfriendly from the hostess to the server.  You do not feel welcome at all and almost like you being there is putting them out.\n\nWe asked to sit outside, but they only had tables in the sun.  We took the sunny table but after about 20 minutes it was just too hot.  We saw the hostess setting up more tables outside in the shade and asked if we could move.  She just said no she was setting these up for another party but did not offer to move us inside or elsewhere.  A couple minutes later her, and who I think was the manager, were setting up chairs for the tables and we we asked if we could just move inside then.  We were told yeah give us a minute.  So they proceeded to both push in chairs and get everything ready for the guests who hadn't arrived yet instead of relocating the guests who were already there and sweltering in the sun.  It seems like one of them could have handled pushing in the chairs and the other could have re-seated us.  \n\nOnce we were eventually moved and received our food nobody ever came by to check on us or refill our drinks, which were both empty.  After we had finished eating and our drinks were still empty the server finally came around, but by that point we were just ready to go.\n\nI can deal with bad service if the food is good, but that was not the case.  I ordered a flatbread pizza and it barely had any cheese on it.  Maybe 40% was covered in cheese.  Most of my bites were just the flatbread with tomato sauce.  All of the entrees were way overpriced too.\n\nThe whole vibe in this restaurant was just bad.  We couldn't wait to get out of there.  I will not be giving this place another try."

The Scallops were nicely seasoned and browned, over a bed of butternut squash rissotto. The scallop poppers were from the sushi menu, its a ball of rice, wrapped in raw salmon, and topped with scallop chunks in the middle. \n\nThey have happy hour during the week only. We ordered a White Sangria and a Sparkling Cranberry. They were both very delicious but i felt disappointed because i think they drink sizes were too small. \n\nThere is indoor and outdoor seating, the outdoor seating has both tables and lounge chairs and couches.\n\nI felt that our server was not very knowledgeable. She would admit she hasn't tasted all the menu items, and then she would recommend drinks, we'd how that drink tasted and then she'd say again she's never tried it."

The service is usually slow and I am always confused about the decor. Not too sure what they are going for with the applebee's style tables/chairs, carpeting, and curtains in all the corners. Feels very dated. I would expect a little bit nicer atmosphere for the cost to dine there. Overall we will probably keep coming back because it's an easy place with lots of choices for everyone."

Of course half way through eating it down comes my dinner.  \nLet's talk about that. Had the chefs special steak and while it didn't taste bad it's was one step above cold. The Brussels sprouts were cold and hard, mashed potatoes tasted like they came out of a box\nNow let's top of the fact the server while I was still eating plops down to the others sitting at the table this \"sign up for points card\" DUDE IM STILL FREAKING EATING HERE! Next he was plopping down the check.  AGAIN IM STILL EATING MY DINNER WHY THE HELL ARE YOU RUSHING US.  \nOh wait, now that you closed out the check did you even offer desert? \nI so can't wait for the rest of the mall restaurants to open cause business will drop there with service and food served this way"

Mike had steak sliders, and I ordered the bison burger. \n\nFirst, they didn't even get Mike's coke right. The shrimp was pretty good, but it took a while for a starter. \n\nThe chef spent most of his time chatting with his friends at the next table about a party at Brooklyn Bowl. \n\nWhen our entrees (finally) arrived, I took a few bites. The second bite was a mouthful of chewy undercooked pork fat. I was done. I searched for our server, but since the chef was at the next table, I told him to send the server over, because I was done. \n\nWhen the server took the burger away, I told him the pork belly was raw. The chef said, \"let me see that\" under his breath. \n\nI'm sure he was going to say it was fine. He probably doesn't realize that Crave isn't the only place in Vegas that serves pork belly. \n\nThe manager came over and apologized for the burger, and said she took it off the bill. I told her, \"of course you did, I didn't eat it.\"  \n\nThe management, should work on their service standards and service recovery, because there are literally thousands of restaurants in Vegas."

We had a server named Maggie I think which every sweet and full of jokes. We loved her! Gave us recommendations to our foods and drinks. Explained I wanted a mojito but I can't have pineapple (which is what they have on their menu) and she said no problem, I'll substitute it with a splash or raspberry or regular mojito. She made my day. We had about 5-6 mojitos later... Lol we had to cancel our shopping and walk it off a little. The food was delish! Sliders, truffle fries and sushi was A1!

Well two times I have been there and both experiences have had issues. I usually Pay attention to my surroundings with what can be taking so long or what can be possible on why it's been so long on waiting for pretty much everything. With that being said the manager is great, checks up on you a few times to make sure everything is ok, the standards with the waiters and waitresses are there, but what causes me to be there for an extensive amount of time? Two words, -Understaffed - (wait is that one word or two) haha! You get the picture! But yes service lacks with being understaffed even when it's not busy. But you know lets put that aside. The food is great here for what it is. The 702 burger is a hit. The truffle fries for sure. Chips and guacamole, yup! And the crispy pot stickers are great. The half off wine is what keeps me coming back, you take that away then there is no way I'll be back. So I guess it gives you plenty of time to Drink the bottle  but you know I see what the situation might be with the waiters and waitresses, and I always take care of them real good because I know they are short staffed. If I'm wrong I want my $20.00 back ! Jordan thanks for the service!"

I thought the restaurant had great ambiance and being able to try several items on the menu gave me a prespective of the type of food CRAVE offers. The items we tried were hit or miss, but overall I got a good feeling from the food we tried and knew we would be back.\n\nWe came back probably a month or so after and I ordered the Lamb Meatballs which is a Signature Dish at crave. It was AWFUL and I do not use that word often to describe food. The pasta portion of the dish was fine but the Meatballs were extraordinarily bland and did not taste fresh. I would not be surprised if they used frozen meatballs. My mother-in-law also had to send her dish back because the lobster tasted awful.\n\nI came back last night with a livingsocial coupon and because opentable was giving 1,000 dining points. I actually was pleasantly surprised with my meal. I ordered the edamame starter which at $8 was definitely not worth it, but tasted fine. I ordered the chicken apple sausage flat-bread and a couscous salad as a side. The salad came out first and it was great. The dressing was very refreshing. The flat bread next came out and it was amazing! The mix of flavors between the sausage, bell pepper, and balsamic vinaigrette was unique and blended together well. It was around $16 which is a little over-priced but I would order it again. My husband just got a burger and fries and it was the perfect medium rare, very juicy and he was a happy guy! I also thought the service was great.\n\nOverall, food is VERY hit or miss. Additionally, the food is generally not worth the prices. It appears there is a happy hour menu, which might be a better deal, but I have not tried.\n\nService is just ok. I have had terrible service there, but last night it was great. Jury is out on that.\n\nAmbiance is great. Beautiful restaurant in a great location. Food is average and not worth the price."

There was a slight wait when we got there but no big deal.  Our waitress walked by and stopped with a stern look and said, \"I'll be back!\"  Who are you, the effing Terminator.\"?\nAnyway she came back to take our drink order.  My wife wanted a cappuccino but couldn't find it on the menu and our kind waitress said, \"Oh it's not on the menu.\"  Helpful, but doesn't tell us what other drinks you may have.  At this point, I'm starting to notice food boogers all over the silverware and asked for a cleaner option but spoke too soon.  The water glasses had stuff chunked on the sides as well and once we finished the appetizer, there was some pasty/dry/cheesy crap now smeared across the table which was nothing of the likes of what we ordered.  This apparently is on the bottom of the disgusting plate.\nSince our dining experience is not quite going as expected, we begin discussing places we should have gone.  I was thinking to myself, are we really discussing my shortcomings of picking a suitable restaurant for Mother's Day?  Wow, now I feel like an ass!  I felt even more like an ass when the food came out.  Not sure who the broad was that brought out the food but she had no clue what she was doing nor could identify anything on the plates.  No worries, here comes our friendly neighborhood waitress that's been such a joy.  Everyone finally got what they ordered however the food was cold.  My daughter got the Crave Burger.  I'm assuming the buns are not fresh because when I say cold, I mean you could have reduced swelling of an injury with her hamburger.  Both my wife's food and mine were also below room temp.  This was the straw that broke the camels back.  Check please!\n\nMy daughter and I were excited to take my wife here for Mother's Day.  Now we're going to one of the places we discussed while waiting for our food.  Sorry Crave, won't be back...ever."

Anyway, we waited and ate. Food was OK, but would have been better if the food wasn't sitting under a barely working heat lamp, forever, because the service is awful!! And I mean AWFUL!!

We ordered the chicken wings and the chicken pandoori sandwich and split.  Most of the sliced apples were on one side of the sandwich along with most of the chicken. It tasted good but had too much sauce. The French fries were terrible!  They need to have good oil or fresh oil for the fries to taste good. The manager needs to step it up with his quality control. This would be a great place if they were more attentive to the food that was served."

Or the fact that my jambalaya tasted like someone poured an entire bottle of tabasco in the sauce!! I love spicy food... But give me a break!! I was expecting Cajun seasonings. The smell of the sauce literally was burning the inside of my nose. 4 bites in and I thought I was gonna be sick. I pushed my food away because the smell of vinegar was too much.\n\nWhen our server finally decided to take out plates away, he noticed that I barely touched my food. I proceeded to tell him that the smell and taste of Tabasco was just way too much and really gross and make me sick to my stomach. His only response to me was \"maybe you would like to order some desserts to get the taste out of your mouth\" ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!  No apology.. No getting the manager. I tried to wave a manager down, but I was ignored. \n\nDon't waste your time. Don't waste your money. If you value your precious daily calorie intake.. Go to shake shack"

The reservation didn't seem necessary even though it was Sunday lunch time. Our server was nice and attentive. We ordered Salmon Sashimi which was ok. Then our entrees came out. I had steak sliders that was beyond boring in flavor. It was so bland that I could hardly make out anything I was eating and my fries looked old and also was lacking in flavor. My husband had the Steak, he asked for medium cooked but all we could taste was burnt meat, it was tasteless even after asking for a1 sauce. I was glad we had that coupon since paying for a disappointing meal is never a good time. We won't be going back."

The sushi is very fresh and well done but the offerings are limited. Most of the items either have a deep fried component or spicy mayo, so you might choose another option if those aren't your taste.  The steaks are excellent.

I ordered the rainbow roll and the fish was okay again nothing amazing very similar to sushi from a grocery store and for the price defiantly not worth it I also ordered the albacore nigiri and that was a huge disappointment, a coworker ordered the Godzilla roll it was so big and tasteless too much work for a blain roll , onto the burgers the bison burger was served literally burnt and the fries were over salted ,the lobster linguini was flavored good  but for the price you get 1 1/2 claw very tiny  and a very small portion of pasta that was undercooked lastly another coworker ordered the gluten free chicken salad (a plus this place has a gluten free menu) so you really couldn't go wrong with lettuce , we also had to constantly ask for refills mind you our group was only 9 people very disappointed . It's such a great location and very nice place itself but the food just isn't up to par"

William represents CRAVE, he was still wearing his CRAVE uniform when he sat down with his VIP friends and drank that shot. Apparently it doesn't count if you regularly go to CRAVE, only if you're friends of William does it matter. I hope William's friends come as often as we did.

Not to mention that for the same prices I can get the real gourmet version of what they are trying to do at a strip restaurant. My Mahi Mahi was over cooked , and had a bizzare banana and curry sauce. The sushi roll we had was edible...if you are the type that likes American AYCE places. The best thing was the burger, which was ok, but for $17 I expected better grade beef and more interesting bun. The service was good. I liked the waitress but In the end, I don't think I would come back. Too many other better places to spend $100 on dinner for 2."

Bearing in mind we got there at 11:30, we were ahead of any rush. Nice enough weather to sit outside where they have lots of umbrellas for those who don't enjoy direct sunlight dining. Before moving on, I will say that the hostesses were quite friendly but I hate how they dress! I think there's a red/black dress code- which I'm on board with- but the women (more like girls) looked like they belonged at a club, not a restaurant at a mall in Summerlin in the afternoon. Our waiter was adorable & on his game. We started with the bread assortment with fragrant olive oil... we loved every bite, though they were a tad skimpy on the oil. The tables have salt & pepper grinders but if you're a pepper user, don't use salt because there's a bit in the pepper (we super liked it!). She ordered the chicken breast entree that has a tropical spin (with jasmine rice) & I ordered the steak (with mashed potatoes & heirloom carrots). There was a bit of a panic when the chicken came, because it was on the bone with a wing & skin- my friend doesn't like meat on the bone, chicken wings or skin. Our waiter very apologetically offered to do what he could to make her lunch enjoyable & she settled with a side of the glaze since the glaze was only on the skin she wasn't going to eat. At that point, she liked it but I doubt she'd get it again.\u00a0My steak was tasty & so were the carrots (either sauteed or lightly roasted). The mashed potatoes had a homemade texture but no butter or sauce/gravy of any sort- I ended up using some of the side of chicken glaze to spruce it up & it worked wonderfully. I'd definitely get my dish again. All in all, I think Crave has potential but a few kinks to work out. I won't rush back but I won't protest if it's suggested."

He was honest and had a sense of humor which can be an issue in these parts. \nOrdered the jambalaya. Was forewarned there were better items on the menu, but that's why I we stopped in after viewing menu outside. It was more like a salty tomato base with sausage and shrimp and minimal seasoning, lacking in flavor. Dish came out lukewarm with indications of having had a visit in the microwave from the uneven heat around the plate. Fish tacos were good. Coconut jasmine rice good too. Neither out of this world. Average. Had a ginger vodka drink which was decent.\n\nI'd perhaps return for drinks and apps but the menu has an identity crisis and still manages to have nothing that stands out. Basic Americana fare with a sushi kitchen. Not an original idea, but catchy perhaps to some. Will try the other places in Dtwn Summerlin before heading back."

My husband had to speak to the bar tender to find out if we can just seat ourselves, we actually almost left. After being seated, the server ( petite with orange hair - Saturday shift at 7:30p ) approached to get our drinks and gave our little one his activity stuff. She looked very tired but still attentive, mediocre - not friendly or entertaining, just there to fill a shift. Food came after about 15mins since we wanted it all together. My miso soup was not even warm so I asked to replace with \"hot\" miso soup. The server seemed very apologetic, (she was very attentive the entire time) and got another one. Whoever the cook was ( cant call that chef ) seemed to just have poured boiling hot water on the soup. It tasted like hot water with a minuscule hint of miso so I returned it after I asked both my son and hubby if they wanted it ( they both said yuck ). \n\nThe rolls we ordered were alright, nothing I will come back too .. The last roll was loose, the cooks lack pride in making them. \nI have tried better and more artistic seaweed salad before.

CUSTOMER SERVICE- From the hostess and the waitress, they have been extremely polite, taking our drink orders once we sat and our entree orders as well. Time is a precious matter and no matter how busy they were, they helped us at any chance they get.\n4. FOOD- I ordered the aloha sushi roll and it was amazing, it had ginger and a sweet teriyaki sauce that meshed well with the raw tuna, my friend had the \"crave burger\" and it was cooked just right medium rare, and the French fries had a great seasoning not just plain. \n5.

No problem we said, we will have a drink at the bar. There were three bartenders working, and the tall male bartender directly in front of us wouldn't turn around to ask me if I wanted anything to drink. He was too busy chatting to the other bartenders and slicing his lemons and garnish.  I was practically waiving the menu to get his attention but was unsuccessful. Luckily the hostess came over and said our table was ready. She brought us to a high top table in the bar area which was too small for me and my guest. I asked for a normal table in the restaurant area and she said no problem, but it will be another 10-15 minutes. Ok, I will try to get that pumpkin spice Ale that I was thirsty for. Still unsuccessful in getting the bartenders attention (he is really focused) the hostess comes back and seats us at a booth in the back. On the way, I told her about the problem with the bartender. She just smiled and told me to ask my server for a beverage. She was totally unaccommodating.\n\nThe server came and she was great, so no real complaints about her. I did notice however that most of the servers came and went like waves. I mean they would be all over the tables and then they would all disappear for  7-10 minutes at a time. I mean no service staff at all in the restaurant. \n\nThe appetizers came and they were fantastic. It took about an hour for our entrees to make it to the table, steak salad and burger. Steak salad was great, however the french fries on the burger plate were soggy as a sponge. So they were sent back and replaced. When I went to eat the burger, the bottom bun was saturated from grease. In fact, the hamburger was sitting in an oil slick puddle of grease. Pretty gross. The manager came to the table after speaking to our server about the issue after about 10-15 minutes. Seems there were some problems with their Point of Sale system and he was concerned with that issue. He took the burger away and he replaced it with a sandwich which was more of a wrap, and it was tasty. He replaced the replacement fries as well again as they were just as soggy as the first if not more.\n\nThe acoustics in the restaurant are not very good either, it is very loud inside. Very much like a sports bar. Good luck having a conversation.\n\nI know this restaurant just opened, but I expected more from them. I would be willing to give them another try, but it wont be any time soon. Hopefully they will still be in business by the time I do decide to patronize them again."

Im so glad we didn't settle for rudeness at the other place. At CRAVE we were met by courteous smiling hostesses Chelsa and Kayla who in tandem took our requests and sat us outside under the stars.\n Crave has a menu called \"DATE NIGHT\". We loved the food choices and the bottle of wine that was included in the rate. And then much to our surprise we were greeted with a 5 star server. Her name was Maggie T. and right from the beginning she seemed delighted to serve us. Her 5 star demeanor lasted throughout our meal. By the way, not only was the service great for a mall restaurant the food was delicious! We had the pleasure to be served by Jennifer Lapadu; a Manager at Crave. I shared my delight with the service and asked if she could share their names. As much as I share honest and truthful negative experiences it is much more important to shed light on servers who do their jobs so well..it even makes the food taste better!"

The crispy chicken that was $6 looked like someone already ate half of it and it was like a sliver of chicken with bunch of breading.. The sliders came out and there were only 2 and light ingredients. Sushi was also ok, Philadelphia was quite fishy.. Used to salmon having a more buttery taste. We tried out this place during their grand opening but it was a madhouse so don't want to rate on that day. Only reason I would come back is because of their awesome patio seating and to have a few beers.. Other than that, not too crazy about it."

A really nice looking restaurant with a large center bar with plenty of seating, and an outdoor patio area. \n\nMy friend and I decided to give it a try. He had already been to Wolfgang Puck's (I haven't so that's another future review). We ordered the crab/artichoke dip in a lemony mayo sauce which was pretty tasty, but lacking a lot of crab. ($14).\nFor dinner my friend ordered the Chicken stir fry ($20) which he said had good flavor but the noodles were undercooked and the veggies overcooked. I will note that our bartender did try to talk him out of that selection.\nI had the Norwegian Salmon in a mustard sauce and that was pretty good. I enjoyed the flavors and the salmon was cooked nicely. I would order this meal again. $27.\n\nThey get lower stars due to two main factors. One - my friends Chicken stir fry meal and 2 - we sat at the bar, and my cocktail sat empty for almost 10 minutes while 3 bartenders looked and walked by. That's not good."

We didn't know what to expect, walking through this deserted shopping center.  \n\nWe saw the menu, saw they have gluten-free, so I'm testing a new diet to see what my allergies are.  I never knew how hard it was to eat GF, dairy and soy free, when dining out.  \n\nThe sushi is nothing to run home to, but at least it was decent.  My chicken and rice noodle dish was a good-interesting, really flavorful, also filling down to the last bite.  Not good for low carb, but perfect for gluten-free, minus the goat cheese for a non-dairy meal.  I always associate rice noodles with my Chinese flavored broth, but this lightly salted, olive oil concoction was surprisingly great.   \n\nThis place has the generic contemporary sort of look, nice choice of orange/red tinge to their decor.

For our food my husband ordered the Crave burger with fries.  I ordered the baked mac and cheese with grilled chicken added to it.  We also ordered appetizers.  Now initially our service started out great.  Our server checked on us and brought us the apps in a timely manner.  When he brought our food, mine came out and, my husband only received his burger.  Our server told him that he asked the kitchen to make a fresh batch of fries and that it will be out shortly.  That was great, but why wasn't this done when the order was taken initially?  Ten minutes or so goes by and our server comes back saying he was off, but another server was taking his place.   He introduced her and they both left.  Five minutes or so passed and when our new server comes by she looks at my husband and says, \"Sir, can I get you anything?\". I think to myself, I'm100% sure she see's me here with him, so why not address us both?  My husband mentions his fries never came out so she goes to get them and by now I'm just annoyed that she didn't address us both, nor did she look at me.  I don't know what her deal was, but honestly I was looking forward to going back with friends for happy hour.  Now, not so much. \n\nBesides the lack of good customer service, the food for okay.  Again, I don't know if we'll go back for a second try or not.  It's a shame too, I thought this would be a good hang out for us aside from Public School."

However, with poor Yelp reviews and a discouraging word from my parents that it wasn't good and over priced I had mixed feelings. When a meetup group scheduled a lunch here I thought I'd give it a try before planning to go with my husband and having a bigger tab.  Meh, nothing special about their Sushi Lunch Combo and service was poor. For 13.95 it came with miso soup, a skimpy spicy salmon roll and 5 nigiri. We were a group of 9 in the corner and server never came around to refill beverages and the restaurant had barely any guests. My glass of water was low and I slurped the remains of melting ice when we left. Sometimes with larger groups I wonder if servers feel more relaxed about providing excellent service because they know there is a high likelihood the total tip is going to be pretty good. I am usually a very generous tipper (18-25%) but not today. No one at our table raved about their selection. If you want sushi, this isn't the place to get your \"fix\"!"

            "review": "Overall\n   My first and second time dining here were both amazing experiences! During my first visit, my coworker and I had just finished shopping around and were looking for a place to eat and we decided to give Crave a try. Having a wonderful experience there the first time, I told my parents about it and they ate there for lunch for a meeting and soon called me over as well; ending again with a wonderful experience. I definitely recommend this restaurant, but just watch out a bit for the pricing. \n\nWait Time & Customer Service\n   Hostesses are alright in my opinion, and the wait for us wasn't as long as some other reviewers (do note that it was only the two of us) had experienced; I waited around 10 minutes for an indoor seat my first visit, which isn't bad. The indoors looked pretty classy. Our waitress was absolutely amazing, she was friendly, knowledgable and very attentive. \n   We received exemplary customer service; During our first visit with my coworker the manager paid for one of our desserts just because we couldn't decide between two of their desserts. He (the manager) did initially think that my coworker and I were on a date though, so I believe this would be a great place for a date knowing that the manager's trying to make your date run as smoothly as it can. I don't know if the manager does this 24/7 but, during the first visit the manager was roaming around the restaurant, checking on the customers constantly. I gave the biggest tip I've ever given a restaurant here. \n   During the second visit with my family, again, we had exemplary service. We were seated outdoors at the patio. I don't know if it was super busy that specific day, or if the waiters and waitresses for the patios are just less organized. Our waiter for that day was friendly as well but wasn't as attentive. A few times different waiters came to our table with something that wasn't ours (but all of the food we had ordered had been served already) and at some point went from table to table asking if they had ordered what she was carrying. It wasn't bad though, we're all human and they just opened so there will always be a few kinks here and there. I overall definitely recommend this restaurant.\n\nFood\n  During my first visit I had the Filet Mignon, which by the way, is the best Filet Mignon I've ever had! It was very juicy and had lots of flavor, I find their Filet Mignon better than Cheesecake Factory's (and Crave's Mignon is a bit bigger). It's accompanied with \"potato puree, caramelized brussels sprouts, [and] topped with garlic butter\" which is a perfect (I guess you would call it) side to the dish. My coworker had the Ribeye which is also accompanied with the same sides as the Mignon. I had a taste of his Ribeye and it was pretty delicious too I'd give the Ribeye about four stars and the Mignon five stars. We also ordered the sushi, Godzilla. Very delicious. I'd give that about five stars as well. \n   With the desserts that night, we had the Smore's Brownie and Signature Cheesecake. We devoured the smores, and we didn't really eat much of the cheesecake. The smores had the perfect balance of sweet flavors: five stars. The cheesecake was ok but nothing really special: three stars. \n   During my second visit I initially wanted to have the Filet Mignon again (it's that good) however, I'm a person who loves to try new things so I went for the Pork Tenderloin instead. The Tenderloins were not as delicious. It was kind of dry, but manageable, nothing really special in my opinion: three stars. \n   My Father had Half Roasted Chicken, which was absolutely delicious; I took a taste of it as well! It contains rice, bits of grilled pineapple, and \"jalapeno orange glaze\". The chicken was juicy and seasoned deliciously, and with the pineapple and the orange glaze it tasted delicious altogether: five stars! My Mother had the Chicken Stir Fry, (which again, I had a taste of. I'm a foodie) it was okay for me, around three stars. My Mother however found it to be too salty for her, and asked if she could have something else (which they happily obliged) and then ordered the Half Roasted Chicken.\n    Both times that I was here I had some tea with peach in it (different drinks) the first one was mixed with raspberry I believe, and it was okay. The plain peach tea was not sweet enough for me, so it'll be good for those who like not-too-sweet drinks. Wait time for the food wasn't that long as well, pretty average wait time for a restaurant. \n   The food overall? 4.5 Stars\n\nPricing\n   The prices of the food here are kind of pricy, but my coworker and I thought it was worth it; I think they would have even more business if they maybe lowered the prices a bit. The bill for my coworker and I came up to the low $100, with the cheesecake being free (Filet Mignon, Ribeye, Godzilla, Cheesecake, Smores, Peach tea, Raspberry  tea). I do not know of the total bill for the lunch meeting during my second visit, but as far as I know, there were no complaints."

They put your first and last name in the system then give you a waiting pager. They seemed so unorganized like they didn't know what they were doing. The wait was an hour long so we decided to walk around downtown summerlin and check it out.. About 40 minutes passed by so we checked to see how much longer. They said about 4 more people were in front of us still so we waited some more.... About 15 more minutes passes by so we check how much longer again and she said 2 more people were still ahead of us but since we were in there she'll just seat us. I don't know if that was a good or bad thing because if she let us cut in front of people imagine how many people she let cut in front of us?! \n\nSo now that we're seated let me say... She gave my boyfriend and I the WORST table. It was so tiny right in between the bar and the bigger tables. We were so close to the family sitting on the side of us. The space was so tight the servers were having a hard time squeezing through to drop off and pick up food. \n\nNow for drinks I ordered a white sangria. Our server bragged about how delicious and popular that drink was and how I'm gonna love it...... Then he comes back and says they're all out!!! Really?! Got my hopes up! So I went with the blueberry lemonade.. It was good-- super minty from the mint leaves. My boyfriend just got a Stella.. Nothing to mess up there. \n\nAs for food.. The menu was on the pricier side. Their pastas ranged from 20-30$... 18$ for some Mac n cheese!!! They have a sushi side of the menu too but I didn't order any sushi. My boyfriend got the crave burger and the fries tasted over-cooked. The food was just okay. \n\nMainly went to check out the new mall and decided we'll stop by and eat there and it was just bad. They are the only restaurant open right now so I understand that's why they were so busy but they just seemed  so unorganized. Probably will give them another shot again like later later once they figure themselves out."

To some extent, for better and for worse, it feels like a Cheesecake Factory type menu with lots of variety in the cuisine types but at a high degree of quality. I chose the fried calamari at the server's suggestion, and accompanied it with hot marinara. I love any calamari that is freshly battered and not too greasy, and this more than met the test. I really liked the crunchy corn meal batter. I also had the steak sliders for my dinner since I was not too hungry, and I enjoyed them a lot. I wasn't a big fan of the sauce on them, but the steak itself was juicy, tender and came in large chunks on the Hawaiian sweet bread.

I also had the tempura veggie roll with cream cheese and it was excellent. My husband ordered a burger and requested no cheese. Our waitress told him it doesn't come with cheese, but unfortunately, when he got it, it had cheese on it. The waitress apologized profusely, got him another burger, and gave us a $10 off coupon for our next visit which will hopefully be soon!"

RANDOM but also... if you can't decide what you want... i guess you can come here for a VARIETY of Choices.\n\nI have been here before when they were fairly new... the food was AMAZING! this time around... i was a bit disappointed... as the selection i made again of what i had eaten before was NOT the SAME as what i was expecting.\n\nOur server was nice, but she seemed like she was having a bit of a rough day... We also ordered a bottle of wine & there was some spilling action due to the capsule not being cut off all the way... which the wine hit & just dripped all over the table =/ \n\nCame here w/ 2 of the girlfriends so we shared a bunch of different things.\n\nBREAD BASKET $3 - different kinds of bread & probably wouldn't get it again while paying... prefer to get truffle fries as a filler but our server forgot to put our order in for this & we were already too full to tell her.\n\nCRAB ARTICHOKE DIP $13.95 - a mix of crab & artichoke tossed in a lemony mayo served hot w/ flat-bread. This thing was freaken AMAZING & scorching hot which made it even tastier. The crispy flat-bread just perfects the dish!\n\nCRAVE HUMMUS $9.95 - a pesto & goat cheese infused hummus served w/ rainbow cauliflower & fresh veggie bruschetta w/ crostini. This was not my style & we probably made the least dent in this item. It just had a sour taste to each bite... =/\n\nARGENTINE STYLE RIB-EYE $31.95 - rubbed w/ palm sugar rub & chimichurri served w/ potato puree & rainbow cauliflower. I was hoping to taste some chimichurri but the palm sugar rub was overpowering & it tasted like a sweet piece of meat rather than the melody of sweet & savory....\n\nSAUTEED SCOTTISH SALMON $21.95 - mustard crusted served w/ grain beurre blanc, potato puree, heirloom carrots. PERFECTION on this dish, although i don't like salmon... i had to try it. it was also a HUGE piece of fish! the mustard crust gave it a nice blend in flavor.\n\nSIMPLY GRILLED HALIBUT $MP - typically served w/ coconut jasmine rice & roasted rainbow cauliflower, but i got potato puree & asparagus instead. This was a very DISAPPOINTING dish... the fish was like GOO... i LOVE LOVE halibut & i just couldn't eat it.... every bite, it was like MUSH rather than FLAKEY meaty goodness... also tasted fishy which typically should NOT be the case for HALIBUT!"

I had to ask three times for a glass of water; once when I ordered my drink, once when the bartender gave me my drink, and finally to who appeared to be the assistant bartender.  I even had to sit and wait, with empty plate and glasses in front of me, and finally ask for my check even though I had told the bartender I was done when he asked if I wanted another drink after I finished my food.  Besides those times I, along with the other three ladies at the bar, was mostly ignored.\n\nThe kicker is they weren't all that busy with it being past the lunch rush and before dinner.  Hell, while I was sitting there waiting with my wallet in front of me the assistant went and started to chop lemons instead of asking if I needed anything. The food and drink were good which is why they get two stars and why I'll probably give them a second chance sometime.  But it won't be soon."

The $5 cup of black bean soup was fine, however after that, things got bad.  We ordered the \"steak\" sliders as an appetizer.  They were a sad shade of gray, tasteless, tough and luke warm.  Couldn't figure out if it was salisbury steak, or something more sinister.  $15 for 3 of these monstrosities was criminal. The calamari was tasty, but skimpy, and again luke warm.  The caeser salad was bland, with absolutely no flavor, and next to no dressing.  \n       Ordering the 'signature' rib eye for the main course was another huge disappointment.  $31 for a steak 3/8ths of an inch thick is absurd.  I don't think they are getting nervous at Del Frisco's.  After all this mediocrity, we decided to skip desert at Crave, and purchase some items from the nearby Trader Joe's.\n      The highlight of the meal was the desert from Trader Joe's.  I am not a malicious person, however I need to warn other yelp fans about this $155 fiasco.  For that type of money we could have had an outstanding meal at the nearby Vintner's Grill or Honey Salt."

The sushi menu was good, but really nothing that jumped off the plate to make it stand out over your local sushi hole in the wall. The calamari starter was a decent serving and something I would recommend.\n\nThe service was great, our server ran through the menu lighting fast and offered up some really interesting choices from the sushi menu.\n\nDowntown Summerlin has some great options to choose from either for lunch or dinner. With no disrespect to Crave but i believe it falls in the middle of the locations you can choose from. If you have not been, Go try it out \n\nOverall:\nFood: 3-5\nDrink: 3-5\nService: 4-5\nComing back: sure"

The restaurant was not very busy so we were surprised that we had to wait so long to be seated. \n\nHappy hour is available all day Sundays, and found that CRAVE had quite a few items offered between $3 and $6. We ordered 3 dishes, the pesto chicken flatbread, the Korean nuggets, and the bacon cheddar tater tots.\n\nThe Korean nuggets had a good flavor, however the breading was falling apart and quite mushy. It definitely needed to be cooked to a crispier finish. \n\nThe bacon cheddar tots are not what you may expect. I was thinking it would be a crispy tot with bacon and cheddar melted on top, however, the bacon and cheddar were actually inside the tots. The tots had mashed potato consistency on the inside. The flavor was good, however it was served on such a large plate, that it looked rather unappealing. \n\nIn  contrast, the flatbread was larger than the plate it was served on. It had an okay flavor, however it is not something I would actually ever CRAVE. \n\nOverall, the happy hour food and drinks are cheap, but so is the quality. I would say you get what you pay for, however, I still think I overpaid."

I love the twinkling lights; the crisp air; the elevated spirits of people who'd likely be under a rock because it gets dark so early; the food.  Ah, the food.  I hate the food.  There's just too much of it in December! And that's what brought us to Crave, who generously hosted a free reception after the Menorah lighting at Downtown Summerlin, open to all.\n\nThey brought out an admirable selection of appetizers:  two kinds of flatbread, two kinds of sushi, multi-colored cauliflower with a dip that seemed to be babaganoush with diced apples (?), bacon & cheese potato tots with a very garlicky dipping sauce, and an assortment of breads.  Drinks were on us, and service was excellent.\n\nWe might have stopped there, but we had a BOGO coupon for dinner that had actually expired about a week ago.  They generously agreed to take it, so we decided to continue our food fest in the dining room.  One quibble, and it's not only for this place:  why on earth do restaurants insist on air conditioning a huge restaurant when it's winter in the desert?  I quipped to the hostess that we should sit in the [open] kitchen, but she said it's cold in there, too!  If restaurants stopped doing this they could probably lower the cost of each entree by $5.  \n\nDespite other reviews decrying the service here, our experience was different.  Just as in the bar, the service was A+++.  Our waiter, Jordan, was friendly, chatty, attentive and fun.  Though others may feel differently, we hate it when a wait person is a robot; to us, a personable server is an asset, makes us feel welcome, and adds to the overall experience.  Disclaimer:  I like chatty seatmates on airplanes, too.\n\nThere were numerous entrees to choose from, and I had Pesto Chicken Greek (no, I didn't reverse the strange order of the three words) - two small but thick breasts atop a mixture of roasted potato dice and multi-colored cauliflower.  The very juicy chicken was topped with mozzarella and drizzled with a nice, creamy pesto.  I loved the veggies, but alas, it was a very small portion.  If we hadn't had the BOGO, I would have objected to the 17.95 price of this dish.\n\nMy husband had Chicken Caprese Rosa, a fried chicken breast duo sliced over angel hair in a vodka-ish sauce.  Very juicy chicken, tasty pasta, but again, not a very large portion of pasta.  \n\nThe food is very good, the service is excellent (our waitress from the bar even stopped at our table as she was leaving to wish us a happy Chanukah), and the restaurant is very pretty.  We liked it and we'll return."

Ive been here 3 days in a row now and every meal gets better then the last. \nThe first time we dined here we were lucky enough to be invited for the Soft Opening. We got to try numerous items from their menu. I loved all of them and a few of my favorite items were:\nChicken Apple Sausage Flatbread- Caramelized red onion, balsamic glaze, manchego, roasted red peppers\nPork Belly Sliders- Kimchi, Korean BBQ sauce, cilantro\nJumbo Shrimp- Spice marinade, flash fried, tzatziki sauce\nLemon Garlic Wings- cucumber, bleu cheese dip\nLobster Linguine- Poached lobster, lightly truffled lemon butter sauce\nStrauss\u00ae Free Raised\u00ae Grass Fed Burger- Foie gras butter, caramelized onions\nAloha Sushi Roll- spicy tuna, mango, cilantro, avocado, pok\u00e9 sauce\n\nWe also had an arrangement of cocktails, my favorite was the Candied Carrot Martini. It contained a few different vodkas with fresh pressed carrot juice. YUM!\nOur server Jennifer was great, we could tell she was very busy but still provided great service. Probably the best server Ive ever had.\n\nThe second time we dined here it was the grand opening. There was a 2 hour wait at the door so we tried our luck at the bar. We grabbed a few seats (we got extremely lucky) and started out with a few wines. They have an amazing hour Pinot Grigio and Merlot. We had the Aloha Sushi roll (again) and the calamari. Andy LOVED the calamari. it had a crispy cornmeal crust and came with  jalape\u00f1o aioli for dipping. It was a great twist on the classic calamari dish. Although I didn't get any of the bartenders names we again had great service.\n\nAnd the third time I dined here (this afternoon) Ceasar took great care of us. I came here with a gf and my mother, who has celiac disease. CRAVE has a huge Gluten Free menu! Ceasar even told us that they take celiac so serious that the chef who makes any gluten free item even changes their coat, gloves and apron to keep from cross contamination. We were so impressed by this. \nMy gf and I started out with the Margarita Flatbread. So amazing!! Each piece had the perfect amount of fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomato. \nFor entrees my mom had the lemon garlic wings, she loved them as much as I did. I had the  Roasted Chicken. It came with coconut jasmine rice, grilled pineapple relish, fried plantains and was glazed with a jalape\u00f1o orange glaze. This is probably my favorite item I've tried here. Its amazing. Jen had the Turkey Burger and she loved that as well. \nI had a blueberry Fizz to drink, it was pretty much a non-alcoholic blueberry mojito. \n\nThis is probably my new favorite restaurant in the Summerlin area. We've dined here 3 times in 3 days, and enjoyed each experience. So happy to have a place like Crave right up the street!"

Do not order Steak Sliders if you are hungry!! It's consider an entree/burger which looks like it should be an appetizer $14.95!! A White Castle burger is bigger than the sliders I got. The wait staff was decent and friendly which is why I gave 2 stars. FYI you'll be \"Crave\"ing that you had more food on your plate. Pass!!"

Said she never put them in...hmmm, kinda of a drag. Was looking forward to a salad. At least she was honest. Also our steaks came with a different veggie than advertised. When asked, she said she didn't know why and brought us the correct veggie (which was cauliflower and was utterly tasteless), so we were glad it came with asparagus instead. The steak medallions were good, as were the roasted new potatoes. That saved the meal, otherwise would've been totally disappointing. To start we had the fried calamari which was actually really good, so that was a plus as well."

The place had maybe three people in it. Though I'm visibly pregnant and the place was empty they sat my friend and I at the bar.\nThe waitress mentioned happy hour was coming up and even though we explained we wouldn't be drinking she failed to mention the food specials (which we found later on after we ordered) We ordered two salads, truffle fries, and the crab and artichoke dip with my coupon. The waitress never came back to check on us to see if we needed anything else and I had to chase her down every time she dashed by without refilling our waters. I wasn't a fan of the aioli for the fries and wanted ranch.. I was able to ask her for some about 10 minutes after we were served. Ten MORE minutes later she comes back and says oh no one brought you ranch? By now the fries are cold and soggy. She offers to take the fries off the menu. We ask for more flat bread crackers for our dip which we were charged extra for... My friend takes a bite with dip and finds A STRING OF PLASTIC in her mouth!!! We stopped a manager and to tell him what happened. He apologizes, leaves, comes back and says \"You know what I think it was? A bristle from the brushes they use to clean the kitchen.. You know like a toothbrush.\" UM WTF!! Yuck!!!!! How did that get in the food?!! He returned with some more free appetizer cards and a $10 off coupon for the next visit buuuut I'm honestly scared to come back. Also hate not being checked on in an empty restaurant. I personally have never worked in the food industry but if I was a manager I think it would be common sense to train your servers to come check on the table 2-3 minutes after being served."

We decided to go to Crave for two reasons. 1. It was in Downtown Summerlin and we wanted to go shopping. 2. They had sushi. We made a reservation and headed over. We sat down in a little table and got some menus and the waiter explained the place to us. They have two kitchens, one regular and also a sushi kitchen. We took a moment to look over the menu and kinda just ordered a little bit of everything. We ordered a couple rolls, truffle fries, guac and chips, edamame, flat bread pizza, and even some mac and cheese. My favorite was probably the crunchy spicy tuna roll. We ordered so much they had to extend out table. HAHA, fatasses. We also ordered drinks. I had the blueberry Lemonade, very delicious if you like mint. It has mint leaves in it so it wasn't very lemony. We also ordered lemon drop shots which were strong. My friends also ordered some beers and ciders. We discussed the meal together and came up with 3.5. The flat bread was a little cold and not super tasty. The fries were probably my second favorite. I mean they are fries, you can't do much to mess them up. The guac was on a pile of lettuce which made it look like there was more than there was, also don't like lettuce in my guac, hopefully i'll remember to order it without the next time. Our server was really nice tho. He gave us as much information as he could and helped us organize our table to fit everything. I want to go back and try more items and hopefully fine something more memorable."

My boyfriend ordered a their signature Crave burger, the meat patty was a bit dry and the fries were soggy. I ordered turkey BLT and I got somewhat of a flat bread sandwich, kind of threw me off.

He was a great server! Very attentive, funny, knowledgeable about the menu, refilled our waters often without being asked. We really liked his personality. \n\nI really like the menu selection. They also have a special menu (at least they did on 3/26) where they donated a portion of the meal price to a charity.\n\nI was really wanting some seared ahi tuna but I wanted a tuna steak and a side of rice. So I looked at the menu and the closest thing I could find to what I was craving was the sesame seared ahi tuna salad. I asked the waiter to order just the seared ahi on a plate, and a side of jasmine rice. I was rather disappointed in the serving size of the tuna, very very thinly sliced ahi. Ah well.. it *IS* what I requested... I can't get upset about my bad choices, right? I will give the chef credit, it was definitely a very beautiful presentation, and the tuna was super delicious. I just wish there was more than 2 ounces of it! It actually melted in my mouth, it was quality sashimi. \n\nMy friend and I also ordered the hummus appetizer, which was amazing!!!! I love the cucumbers served with the crispy pita bread, something about a really fresh cucumber and hummus that is so refreshing. The hummus was slightly spicy and had jalapeno in it. SO good. \n\nEverything is reasonably priced, with the tuna only costing $15. Great service and food, and an awesome location in the middle of downtown summerlin mall. Great place to stop before or after a movie, or to take a break from shopping."

The host greeted us (4) and continued finishing up whatever she was doing before we walked in, which kind of bugged me. We waited for about 2 min before she grabbed our menus and escorted us to our booth. Mind you, there was absolutely no one in the restaurant. We were the first guests of the day I assuming. We shouldn't have waited at all. We got seated and immediately our server greeted us and asked if we've been here before which we haven't. And began to give us a quick run down of the restaurant and menu. He was great. As soon as we ordered our food started to come in quick one by one. Also ordered a mimosa which only tasted the Orange juice. The appetizers were great (tuna poke) and the jalape\u00f1o poppers were delicious. When we got our entrees my husband ordered the b\u00e9arnaise burger and I ordered grilled cheese with tomato soup. Mine turned out great (but who can mess up grilled cheese) as soon as my husband was about to take a bite from his burger our server mentioned that it was the wrong burger. He was served the Bison burger instead of the b\u00e9arnaise. He apologized and offered to get him his original burger but my husband was fine with the bison burger. Which he said was really good. So no complaints. The manager even came to apologize about the mix up. When we got our bill nothing was even deducted for THEIR mistake. I mean the least they could do for their mistake on a slow day was take off a few dollars. But hey that's my opinion. All in all the food was good, the restaurant was nice and our server was great. I probably won't ever come back."

My sister made a reservation for lunch. A few friends of mine warned me about the taste of the food but it was too late and I'm pretty stubborn.\n\nI just had a great shopping trip at my favorite store nearby. I was happy. We walked in and the host took us through a maze of high tables and high chairs. Did you not see my big shopping bags and yoga mat I was knocking things on the tables with? Why would you seat us at cramped tables when you have booths available? Lack of perception and care. Woosah!\n\nCRAVE Grilled Chicken Salad:\nCandied walnuts, goat cheese, field greens, grilled chicken breast with balsamic vinaigrette. I was leaning towards the Baby Kale and Steak Salad but this had the place's name in it so, it must be a must-have item, right? Not really. Everything that does not require cooking was ok but the chicken was dry. 2/5\n\nNorwegian Salmon Salad:\nCouscous, salmon, quinoa, pomegranate, pickled grapes and wilted spinach. The chef must not be good at checking for meat temperature and doneness. The outside of the fish was cooked but a big portion of the core was not. The manager got involved and offered another piece of cooked salmon. Why can't you just get it right the first time? 1/5\n\nNigiri:\nMy sister got salmon and escolar (super white). I didn't have any. The cuts looked good and the fish seemed fresh. I won't ever touch escolar due to its natural laxative properties - I don't need that!\n\nI normally would try to be understanding of things. Mistake after mistake...after we were done, I was yearning for my bathroom. I had plans to continue shopping with my sister but I had to go. I guess it didn't matter if I ate escolar or not, the food here has the same effect. I don't CRAVE for pain and suffering that's for sure. Holy borborygmus, I gotta go!"

We went in the middle of the afternoon, so it was not busy. We were sat right away, and our waiter came out shortly after to get our drinks in. We paid the $2 for the bread basket, and while it was adequate, the stuff that was supposed to be crispy was soggy. Just, no. it really should have been free. The runner who dropped it off took the time to explain what each of the breads were, by touching each one! Wtf! We had to laugh. The menu is extensive and appealing, but, They were out of the sandwich my boyfriend ordered, which seems to be a theme in alot of other reviews. He settled on a burger that featured a foie grais butter, and i got the steak sliders, both with fries. As we waited for our food, we had time to look around the restaurant, It was not busy at all, and it was obvious because there were waiters everywhere, standing around and talking in the middle of the restaurant, one guy even stood in the middle of the restaurant and texted on his phone! Gross! Some food got dropped off at a table near us and we could hear the waiter say to another one, \"bet that food gets sent back, looked pretty bad.\" Umm what? At least we were entertained while we waited for our food. Our food comes, and yikes, it didn't look good. My sliders were sloppily put together, the crispy fried onion strings were really pale and under done, the steak had no flavor and the color of it was... Unappealing. There was no detectable juniper mayo, and the buns were underwhelming. There were about 9 soggy greasy French fries on my plate, and the temperature of my food was Luke warm. My boyfriends burger was ordered at medium well, it came out well done, and the bun was burnt to a crisp. His fries were also cold and soggy. There was no foie grais butter to speak of, either. I felt really bad for our waiter, he must know how bad their kitchen is because he brought us out fresh fries without us even saying a word about them. \n\nWe left our waiter a nice tip, as it wasn't his fault, it is clear to me that he was trying his best despite a kitchen that doesn't seem to care.\n\nBottom line, this place needs to get it together quick, or it will be gone as soon as the other restaurants open. It seems poorly managed and the kitchen is a mess to say the least, zero quality control. For a $40 lunch, we would have had a better meal at 5 guys."

The food was tasty and somewhat prompt with above average execution.  The quality that seemed to be missing from everything overall was conception.  It comes off as if they are trying to execute multiple concepts at once, like a casual mid to upscale sushi bar/yardhouse that is part intimate - part sports bar-ish.  This creates a confusing vibe as it is not pulled together in its paradoxical ways, and IMHO they do not capitalize on such a mish mash of concepts with their menu items.  The other reason I give them four stars, is because despite these and more shortcomings, it is clear that they are putting time and effort into making it all work in a genuine way.  Whether or not they continue to develop it into a more refined version of itself, I applaud the effort they are clearly putting into it."

The meal took an insane amount of time to be brought to us only to have soggy luke warm fries. Sushi was average but not memorable. Dessert (a small mousse cup) took nearly 15 min to be served and STILL had a shortbread cookie in it in spite of us being told it was the only gluten free dessert and us making it clear we needed it without the cookie. Since we had to leave (since the whole meal took twice as long as necessary) The waitress merely suggested it be removed from the bill since it could take another 20 minutes to put mousse in a 2in cup. Absolutely absurd. Looking around the restaurant at any time one saw waiters just loitering around....so they are clearly not under staffed on the floor , maybe the issues stem from the kitchen that isn't even prepared to serve to a restaurant less than half full.

I guess being in the business myself has made me a bit of a picky diner. I wouldn't go back to Crave because the meal we ordered was not worth the $43 bill. The only thing I really liked was the crab cakes and I didn't think they were worth 15 or 16 dollars. They tried to put their own spin on butterscotch pudding. I didn't care for it at all. It was served with an oatmeal cookie than looked and tasted like it came out of a box. I didn't like the margarita flatbread either. The sauce tasted really strange and not pleasant. There's too many dining choices in that area to go back and give them a second chance.

We sat out on the patio which was interesting on a side note as all the booths were filled and they weren't seating in general at the tables in the center due to having to sit in direct sunlight, but we noticed that they had umbrellas so we asked to be seated at a table and had a umbrella moved to give us some shade. It took about 10 - 15 minutes before a wait staffer came to ask for our drink order, so as we waited we noticed a table of 3 women who order the hamburgers which looked really good, but what caught our attention was that all 3 of them ate their burgers with a knife and fork. It took another 10 -15 minutes before our drinks came and the waiter informed us that he was actually not the waiter assigned to our table and that our assigned waiter would come shortly to take our orders. It took another 10 mins before we saw our new waiter, so in the meantime we watched as a family of 3 insisted on being seated in a booth near us where the sun was shining directly at the table. The woman was pushing a stroller and we saw that there was a small dog inside, not a baby. When our waiter finally appeared to take our order we chose a starter of the Walleye cakes and then for entrees I ordered the Mexican sushi roll which was the only roll on their menu that had any hot spice to it, my partner ordered the Kogi tacos. As we now waited for our food, I noticed the lady at the booth looking distressed and covering her head with a magazine to block out the sun, she was frantically looking around for something. Her husband and son looked peaceful and were chatting quietly over the menu, the little dog in the stroller was soaking up the sunshine, finally the lady waved down a waiter and much to my surprise, asked him if he would move the umbrella that was at OUR table over to hers. Seriously?! Wow... The waiter looked confused and said that he couldn't do that as it was in use at OUR table. Ok, moving on now to the review on our food. The Walleye cakes were interesting but not enough to ever order again and personally felt they were overpriced at $ 13.95, they were just 3 little patties of wild rice and red onion with a tarter dipping sauce. My partner's kogi beef tacos were good with a nice flavor but a bit too sweet for my taste. My Mexican sushi roll was just eh....nothing memorable or different from any other standard roll. Overall, we spent almost 2 hours there with 3/4 of it waiting for service and food, if not for the side notes of \"people watching\" it would not be a memorable experience at all."

On the server's suggestion, my fianc\u00e9 ordered the jumbo shrimp appetizer and I ordered the poblano Caesar salad, both very good but the jumbo shrimp was not hot.  Our mains came out midway through eating our appetizers which was quite annoying, we felt rushed.  He ordered the half chicken which was good, Jamaican flavours.  I ordered the farfalle pasta which was warm in the middle and cold on the outside when I received it.  I mentioned the temperature to the server and she offered to take it back to pan fry and I said no that's ok.  Our bill was $98 and we tipped $15.  A bit expensive for the rushed feeling but the flavours of the food was very good and I will give this new restaurant a chance to work out its kinks."

We were brought to our table which already had people seated at it, then, it was right by the kitchen which was very crowded and the wait staff was clearly didn't know the layout of the restaurant yet. The beer they brought me was warm from the tap and the food I ordered was way too spicy and the lamb meatballs were overly dry. It will be a long time before I go back."

            "review": "I went to Crave yesterday, 10.13.2014 around 2 p.m.  I was told a 45 minute wait when there were empty tables all over the place.  We ended up sitting in the bar.  The service was awful.  When the server Julie  did come over she was writing everything down on an OUTBACK notepad and when I asked if the restaurant was part of outback she said the restaurant was too cheap to supply paper for them to write their orders on so she was using the outback notepads.  Her attitude was less than professional at the start.\n\n I ordered the sandwich with chicken, apple and brie and when it arrived after about a 35 minute wait the fries were cold and chicken cold.  I asked the person who brought me the sandwich if it was suppose to be a cold sandwich.  He said Yes.  When the server came over I asked her and she said no and took the sandwich back.  20 minutes later when everyone else had eaten the sandwich came so I ended up taking it to go.  The manager came over and apologized and said he would be back in a \"few\"  never did see him again.  The bill came; it was wrong and when I mentioned it to the server instead of wanting to correct it she wanted to give me the cash in lieu of fixing the bill so I would pay the bigger amount on my credit card.  When I asked her to fix the bill she slammed it on the table and said it would take a while to fix it.  Let's just say that this experience was not good and it will be a LONG time before I would try this restaurant again.  Too bad because it has a nice ambiance but the service and food has to improve."

We decided the wet, bland, shredded chicken may have been slightly \"off\" and left after two bites & paying our bill.  Our fault for deciding the 20 minute wait for a table at another restaurant located right above Crave was too long.  Our first clue that something wasn't right should have been all the empty tables during what should be a busy lunch hour on a Saturday afternoon.  Too bad, too. The interior is lovely and the staff is pleasant."

I mean really good but not OMG amazing.  We split a chicken salad which was the star of the meal.  14 bucks for a lunch portion salad.  We each orders the sushi lunch combo which is a midi soup, one 6 piece roll and 4 pieces of nigiri.  Again, it was all tasty and presented well.  14 bucks each for the combos.  Just ordered water to drink in order to better enjoy the Unami of the sushi.  Total bill.....almost 24 bucks each so all in 28 dollars for lunch.   To me, a bit overpriced considering the choices Vegas has to offer.  \n\nI don't consider myself a cheapskate, so I think I am pretty accurate in my value ratio.  The food was good, not a single complaint.......it just wasn't 28 dollars of good."

We showed him what we ordered on the menu and what was supposed to come, but he got defensive and was almost fighting with us. So crazy!!! I have worked in the hospitality industry for 15 years and have never seen anything like it. I will never go back to this place and will advise anyone who asks not to bother trying it. They need to start fresh with staff that is competent and actually want to be there. Your food can be great, but if your service is terrible, your restaurant is doomed to fail miserably...but the food was mediocre so good luck..."

I will tell you this, the chairs to the high tops stink! They are super uncomfortable and not a lot of room for your booty! The menu offers a huge variety of choices and the Happy Hour menu is decent.  Since it was happy hour, this is the menu we stuck with. We ordered up a sampling of sushi, miso soup, edamame for our first go round. I really appreciated our server advising us of which dishes she felt were the best. Note to self, never order sushi unless you are in a sushi house! I was sorely disappointed with the sushi and let my friend eat most of it. The miso soup had the oddest taste and I could not finish it. The edamame was ok but how much can you screw up edamame?? We then tried the lemon garlic wings and the mini pesto chicken flat bread which were actually quite tasty and these made up for the poor tasting sushi. The wine choices were the best part of my experience at CRAVE. The \"Freakshow\" Cabernet was so yummy. We had to have a couple of glasses. This is a wine I have always wanted to try and it did not disappoint. Overall the service was A++. Our server was attentive and friendly and we enjoyed talking about wine with her. As we lingered, the restaurant began to fill up with holiday shoppers and then they had to move our table which we didn't mind as \"The Human Jukebox\" was setting up to provide some holiday fun and entertainment. He made the night, by playing all kinds or requests from holiday to classics. I may go back again in the future to try an actual entree as the location of this restaurant is very close to where I live which makes it a convenient place to have a bite."

For my first dining experience I had Channelle as my waitress. She was awesome! My drinks never got empty and she knew the menu quiet well. I'm not a sushi fan but she recommened I try it. I ventured out and tried the King Kong sushi and loved it! The pineapple baked chicken was a little dry but it  was very flavorful. However, the water was stale and gritty. I think a high end water filtration system might improve the taste.\n\nMy second trip I tried the guacamole and apple sausage flatbread. Both dishes were very good. I also had the bread basket. Although it was only $3 it would have been better if it was free. The pan bread and crispy flatbread were delicious with the homemade garlic butter. However, I was not a fan of the baked bread. I had Michael as my server this time and he was on point! He never let my drink get empty and put the order in so I didn't receive the appetizer with my meal. (I appreciate that).  \n\nAll in all this restaurant  has very flavorful food that is not too filling and serves much healthier food than many of the other  places in Vegas. I will continue to go here."

I also selected the Caprese Chicken Sandwich, which was pretty weird, by the way--otherwise okay tasting. \n\nAlso, the happy hour drink section just wasn't worth it. My friend ordered one drink and I had to finish it because she didn't like it. All I have to say about it is that..that drink was not worthy. \n\nI see that they have sushi, but I think I'll pass.

We had plenty of time to figure out what we wanted so we did drink and food order at the same time. Drinks arrived (we only ordered water and never were given refills)....then waited well over 30 minutes for just a turkey burger and chicken stir fry to show up. We saw our server only 3 times in the hour we were there and had to almost tackle him to pay attention to us to get our tab. Manager walked around a lot and was on his cell. Not a good view when people are waiting for food or have that look like they need assistance but no one is showing up. We weren't the only table that seemed to be forgotten. Staffing needs some work and management could step up and help out more as well in my opinion. We probably won't be going back.\nTurkey burger was average and the chicken in the chicken stir fry was thinly sliced like it could of been used in a chicken sandwich or BLT style sandwich."

I ordered the cioppino.  $27 for what seemed like a few tablespoons of broth, 2 nice sized shrimp, 4 over- cooked mussels and a few tiny scallops.  I'm quite aware that I live in the land of buffets and oversized portions but this was a bit extreme in the opposite direction.  I sent back the cioppino and ordered the bison burger.

This is like a wealthy stoners paradise. \n\nI came here with a table of ten on their official opening day during the Downtown Summerlin insanity. Turns out this was the only restaurant that was open for business and you could tell. Crave was bursting at the seams; the bar was overflowing with the Real Housewives of Summerlin, the patio had the aging bros and most likely the ex-husbands of the fore mention housewives, and the dining room was a hodgepodge of suits, children, and hungry looking patrons. The front desk was backed up and a little unorganized, we had reservations for 8:30pm, but weren't sat until about 9:15pm.\n\nThe food options at Crave can be confusing, but in a good way. As I read the menu I wanted a little bit of everything and when the waiter took our table's order I noticed everybody must have felt the same way. We ordered sushi, fried chicken, sliders, calamari, and a Margherita flatbread. I only ended up trying the sliders and calamari... \n\nThe slider was very good, a seared piece of pork belly with kimchi, placed on a very soft dinner roll. Full of flavor and the pork belly wasn't too fatty. The calamari was forgettable and it was served with a jalape\u00f1o aioli which I though was good, but it didn't quite fit with the flavor of the calamari. This would be better on a sandwich or burger, not with a seafood dish. \n\nAfter we finished our appetizers we had about 35 minutes of waiting before our food was finally served. I ordered the Bison Burger with fries and when it finally arrived it was cold and you could tell that the fires had been siting for awhile, they looked wilted and old. I was starving so at this point I really didn't care about the food's temperature, I just wanted to eat. The Bison Burger was very tasty even at a lukewarm temp. This chunk of beef came with a healthy slab of pork belly on top of it and a tasty aioli. I can only imagine was this must taste like straight out of the kitchen. \n\nThere's a lot of things to consider in this review:\n- It's their grand opening day. There's going to be hiccups and as a customer and former restaurant worker, I understand this\n- They were the only restaurant open at the time. I don't know of any place that can feed about 2,000 people within a few hours and not mess up once or twice\n- Our server was solid. We always had fresh water and drinks in front of us\n- The manager came over and checked on our table multiple times\n- The place was crackin', I mean slammed! So, the fact that we only waited 35 minutes for our meal really isn't that bad. If you have good company, and we did, time will fly. \n\nThis review is really a 2.5 stars, but the service pushed to a 3 star. I will be back in a few months to see if they have worked out the kinks.  \n\nJUST A NOTE - If you give brutal reviews to restaurants on their opening day. You're probably an insanely critical jerk with everything in life. Just sayin'"

When we got there we had to wait a few minutes to be seated. Even though you can clearly see many tables open. The service wasn't great but wasn't bad either. The server took a while to refill our drinks. When I clearly saw them just talking and messing with each other. \n\nThe restaurant itself was nice and lively. The decor was simple but vibrant. The staff wasn't very approachable. They were stern and not friendly. \n\nThe food here is over priced for the quality and portion. I ordered the Steak Slider and my friend ordered the Pork Belly Slider both came with 3 sliders each. The size of each slider was probably 2x2 inches. It was not filling unless you went there not hungry. My Steak Slider was slightly tough so I'm guessing they used a flank steak for it. The only thing that was good with my order was the pickled jalape\u00f1o. My boyfriend ordered the Grilled Bistro Steak. That was not worth $30. There was like 8 pieces of steak that did not have flavor what so ever. Even steak on it's own has flavor and that did not. My friend's boyfriend got the Bison Burger. That was cooked well but for the kind of restaurant they made the place seem to be they use the cheapest type of lettuce for the burger. Anything else would have been better than what they used with it. \nWe for sure will not be coming back here again."

Drinks - pear martinis - perfect pour, delicious.  Drinks came out quick.  We each ordered a Poke bowl.  One traditional, one Mexican.  So tasty, light, healthy.  They say these are for a limited time - I hope they keep them on the menu.  Food came out quick.  And we each got a dessert - coconut cake and the french silk mousse.  What I love about this place - nice size portions.  No gluttonous, over sized dishes.  Go the strip and eat like a pig there.  Every restaurant here doesn't have to be VEGAS SIZED.  Perfect size portions. You don't need a doggy bag to go.   It's a great place.  Want to go back and try Happy Hour at the bar next. :)   What more can you ask for at a restaurant?  Service, prices, food, drink.  All A+."

I got the mac and cheese with chicken apple sausage, that was soooo yummy! My friend got the scallops which he said was great ( I'm not a seafood fan). The best part was dessert. We got the coconut cake and the walnut praline cheesecake. OMG the coconut cake was the best I ever tasted! I'm still craving it lol! So please don't be put off by the bad reviews and the long waits.

            "review": "Crave just makes it to three stars by the grace of a person who walked by and gave me a $10 gift card as he and his party were leaving.  Otherwise, it would be two stars.\n\nI made a reservation for 7:30 and arrived on time.  I accidentally came in the back door via the patio and was shown to the hostess podium by a nice woman hereafter referred to as NW.  After checking in at the podium, and asking to be seated on the patio, NW took me outside and said that all the booths were filled but I could have any table.  I chose a table that was set for only two people to minimize removing place settings.  NW left menus with me and said that my server would be with me shortly.\n\nThe server brought the menus and took my drink order.  He seemed a bit overwhelmed with the number of tables he was covering but he eventually came back with my iced tea and took my order.  I asked his advice on the entr\u00e9e and I took it.\n\nQuite some time went by and NW had come by and said, \"Didn't *server* get here yet.  I told NW that he had taken my order.  After another wait, the server came out with two drinks for another table and my cup of tomato soup.  He first stopped to give the drinks to that table and before he got to me, NW said, \"Didn't he bring your soup?  I thought I saw him with it.\"  I told her it was on his tray and she was happy.\n\nI had just started my soup when NW came out with my entr\u00e9e.  She apologized for how soon things were appearing.  I was very close to telling her to take it back, but I thought it would sit under a heat lamp and then be brought back out.  I made a split second decision to let her leave the dish with me.\n\nThe tomato soup was very good but I wish I had more time to enjoy it but I hurriedly finished it to get to the lamb meatball pasta.  When I tasted the pasta, it was still hot so I cut a little break for that.  Perhaps if the place was busier things wouldn't have been so quick.\n\nThe menu describes the pasta this way--poblano cream sauce, red pepper, goat cheese, black pepper fettuccine.  The poblano cream had a nice zing to it and the small amount of goat cheese could be used to cut the heat if you wanted.  The meatballs were kind of dry.  The poblano cream sauce and the pepper fettuccine made the dish, flavor wise.  The fettuccine had become stuck together and I was given no spoon to twirl the pasta on.  Since the soup dish had not yet been cleared, I used the soup spoon to twirl the pasta but it came in very long lengths because of this sticking together.\n\nFor dessert, I got their S'mores brownie, a long brownie topped with marshmallow that was br\u00fbl\u00e9ed and had three thin ginger snap cookies placed in the marshmallow.  There was also a dip of marshmallow ice cream.  As it turned out, dessert was the best part of the meal.\n\nNW came by a few times to see how things were and my server was around more often as the patio emptied of all patrons except for two dog hugging young women who took up a lot of my server's time.  \n\nFor the experience, the food would have been better if it had been timed better.  There's no excuse for NW to bring my entr\u00e9e when she already knew I had just gotten my soup.  What was she thinking?  \n\nThe place is Downtown Summerlin priced (this may become the local version of \"Strip prices) and without the $10 discount card, the place wouldn't merit the 3 stars.  Too bad, because for the most part, the food was good.  They've been open about 6 months and they still don't have their act together.  That's sad.  It's also the only time I'll dine there."

Our server Cassie was very attentive to our needs from making sure our water glasses were always filled to going out of her way moving our table under the umbrella as the shade shifted. \n\nAs for the food, I was thrown off by the menu which seemed to be all over the place.  The cuisine is \"American\" and Sushi. We ordered various dishes from sushi to macaroni and cheese to a burger to short rib tacos and my pork belly on fried rice.  See what I mean? \n\nOverall,  the food had good flavor but I've had better.   My rating is mostly based on Cassie and her service.  If it weren't for her,  I'd only be giving this restaurant 3 stars but the fact that she ran all the way to the parking lot in 90+ degree heat to hand us the sunglasses that my niece forgot at the table,  just earned themselves an extra star. \n\nThank you for your exceptional service!"

The outside was very attractive and the menu had a good selection to choose from. We walked in and the restaurant was decorated in ultra modern d\u00e9cor. The hostess greeted us and asked if we had reservations.  Never understood why this  question is asked because there were empty tables available. My wife asked the hostess to sit us in a nice area.  She guided us through the restaurant to our table which was a booth in the middle of the restaurant. We had a view of the bar and the outside. The waitress came to our table and greeted us. She immediately asked us for our drink order and asked if we wanted to start off with appetizers. The waitress suggested that my daughter order the raspberry lemonade. My wife and I ordered a bottle of wine.  I knew that I was going to order a big meal so we skipped the appetizers even though they had a good variety.  \n\nThe waitress returned with our drinks.  The raspberry lemonade looked delicious and was. Then she presented the wine by displaying the bottle and opening it for us to taste and proceeded by filling our glasses. She left allowing us to review the menu. The menu had a good variety, beef, chicken, pork, seafood, pasta, sushi, sashimi and a section of chef signature dishes.\n\nThe waitress return to take our orders, my daughter order the marinara and pasta with french fries from the kids menu.  My wife ordered the sea bass and I ordered the rib eye steak.\n\nWithin 15-20 minutes our entrees came to the table which had a nice presentation and looked delicious. We preceded to eat, however I did not have a steak knife and my wife was missing her knife. We stopped our waitress and requested the knifes. The waiter should have notice or asked us if there was anything else we needed. Our waitress brought the knifes to the table and apologized.  \n\nWe began eating our entrees.  My wife thought that her sea bass was cooked to  perfection, light and moist with the right amount of seasoning.  The pasta with marinara was a little gummy but the french fries were crisp on the outside and soft in the center. My steak was very good, medium rare with good flavor, charred brussel sprouts and creamy mashed potatoes. \n\nThe waitress checked on us several times and refilled our wine glasses which shows that she was trained properly.  At the end of our meal the waitress returned and asked us if we wanted dessert. Unfortunately, we were stuff.\n\nOverall the experience was average because the restaurant was relatively new and need some refinement.  It would have been nice if they offered complimentary bread at the table and a little more attention to detail. We will be back again to give it another try."

I'm actually surprised and shocked on the amount of good places to eat in this downtown Summerlin but wow crave is definitely a shoe in to take first place. Everything about the place is 5 stars even the bathrooms. I usually hate waiting but when Miranda is on I have someone to talk to that'll make time fly by and somehow she can deal with all my questions and still take care and give other guest 5 star service she's an excellent person to have for when you first walk in. The shoe in for greatest sever alive and the most personable server I ever met is Mikey D. Not only does he remind me of home but he makes me feel like I have a great friend every time I step in to the place and I have been here plenty of times happy hour wings is something I live for some days. There a lot of great servers on but when I come and he's on that's who we will request. For the days we come in and we want the bar there's only one person we want back there and that's Andrea she has the most amazing wonderful personality and her smile can move mountains. The fact that she can keep up with all of these different conversations and still have positive input and feel like she's just part of your group makes me salute her. Crave you definitely have an all star cast and as long as you keep on with your 5 star employees which everyone is you'll stay on top of my list. Thanks for being a great place to be"

Maybe a bit overstaffed due to the recent opening, but every face was smiling and welcoming from the host, to the chef, to the wait staff. \nBetween us, we ordered edamame, a couple sushi rolls, and jumbo shirmp. I also endulged in a martini, because they offer blue cheese stuffed olives and I just can't ever seem to turn those down. We weren't looking for full meals, just something to hold us over.  \nSo basically, in my own humble opinion, this place has mediocre food, an overpriced menu, and a faux gourmet intention when you are getting nothing of the sort. \nWhy should an 8pc. sushi roll with spicy tuna and shrimp be $19?! Because I am in the new mall in Summerlin, eh, NO. \nWhy should 4 appetizers and a cocktail cost $80!? Not my style. Was the food decent, sure. I would eat all of it again. But I would never pay that much for it. I could easily go to Ra, or Sushi Roku, for gourmet sushi, AND IT STILL WON'T BE $19 A ROLL!! \nThe decor was beautiful, the cocktail was great. (other than the fact that only ONE of my olives was stuffed, LAME!) But remember, Wetzels Pretzels is still 500 feet away, and Crave, you are not good enough to charge the prices you're asking. Rent must be super high at this location. Sitting between MTO (which has GREAT prices) and a Wolfgang establishment, where its worth the price, my final words for Crave, GOOD LUCK."

I heard some good things about this place but with a 2.5 rating I was a little skeptical. This rating proved to be wrong. The whole night was perfect from the food and decor to the waiter (Marianna). Starting off with bread basket, sashimi (very fresh yellowtail)  and crab cakes the cakes were very tasty and the jalapeno tartar sauce went perfect with them. Dinner was Mahi Mahi for my wife and I had the Sea Bass. Both pieces cooked perfectly and the sauces that accented both were spot on. The flavors all just worked perfectly together on both plates. Desserts were tiramisu and I want to say a hazelnut pudding? Cant recall but it was a bit grain for my taste, but the flavor was good. Tiramisu was not too traditional but again really flavorful. We ended the night with Almond Coffee which was really a great ending note and was pretty damn good - we had to have a second one before heading out.\n\nOn a side note Drinks were all perfect from the bar and their mixed drink menu was pretty good - ginger lime Margarita is worth trying. The biggest plus of the night was our waitress Marianna - probably one of the best we have encountered at any restaurant and was on top of everything throughout the night. From recommendations paired with drinks to explanations of each dish she was all around worth asking for on your next visit. \n\nDont base this place on the 2.5 stars it has right now - these will go up. There was obviously some issues upon opening which any restaurant will have - especially when you try to match ticket times from a main kitchen to a sushi kitchen. I was a chef for years in Las Vegas and observe what goes on in restaurants very closely when I visit - they have obviously pulled it together here - its worth the visit."

The hosted Chyna was lovely, but beyond that the service was lacking.  I wish we had chosen another restaurant.  We had been to Crave once before and because our food was really good, we had forgotten that we  had almost left due to the extreme long wait for a server to even acknowledge that we had been seated.  On this night, our 3 children were dining with us and from the time we sat down until we asked about the progress of our food, it had already been over a 40 min. wait.  A good waitress would have submitted our children's orders immediately.  When we inquired about the food the waitress Julie stated that she didn't enter our food order until 10mins after the appetizer was brought out - only one appetizer was order and it didn't come out for over 20mins.  Her remarks were said in a snarky tone, as if we should be grateful for her failure to realize small children were at the table.  Children have a hard enough time waiting 20mins let alone the almost 60+mins from the time we were seated to receiving their food.  We appreciate they brought fruit bowls to the table for the kiddos, but the fruit was sour and was old, hence none of our fruit loving kids ate the fruit provided.  We watched our plates sit under the heating lamps for over 20mins before being served, I imagine they were waiting for the other meals to be completed.  Just in case you were wondering the restaurant was only about 1/4 full and we seated about 7:15.  When the meals arrived to the table, we were very hungry.  My Bison burger was tasty, however luke warm, as was the rest of meals at the table.  The kids food was barely warm.  A manager, Joe,  passed by with plates in hand for another table, asking how are meal was...we didn't have time to actually answer him, nor was his question sincere.  He stated he would \"be right back\" but that was not the case.  A few customer service 101 tips: When something goes wrong, ie, slow, slow food service, especially for children, don't give or make excuses...simple say you are sorry and correct it quickly.  As a bonus bring the kids some chips, bread...anything (edible) when there is an extended wait.  If you want to ask your customer how there food/experience is, be genuine and have time to listen.  I have a Crave loyalty card and I really want to love this place, there are some great tasting dishes, the cooks are clearly not the issue.  However, I don't for see us going back or recommending it to friends because the restaurant truly lacks great servers and management."

I've been here twice before and the service has been good, friendly, timely, and interactive, so I think this time was more of a scheduling mishap.\n\nThe food I've ordered is very good, I've ordered off the menu, Gorgonzola Stuffed Chicken last time, and Salmon this time.  Both were excellent, though I think I like the Chicken better.  On Father's day, both my Dad and Mom had the Prime Rib special, which was anything but special.  Super thin, over cooked greyish-brown lump.  But, not one of their normal dishes, so maybe a one off mistake.  It was all-you-can-eat, and when the server came with the second round, the meat looked the same, so we said no thanks, and left it at that.\n\nI'll be back though!  Fun place with a lively crowd, especially at the bar.  They must have a decent happy-hour since I've seen the bar busy the 3 times I've been."

Despite seeing several tables available, I was asked if I had a reservation.  Nope.  So when I was told it would be a 45-60 minute wait because I didn't have one, I hopped on OpenTable and made a rez for 7:45.\n\n\"Yes\", I said.  \"I have a reservation for 7:45.\"\n\nThe hostess got huffy and went and got a manager.  I explained that I went on OpenTable and made my rez after I was told there would be a 45-60 minute wait.  I played by their rules, and the millennial hostess decided to get upset.  \"After all, the restaurant is 1/2 empty. A potential hour wait seems a little absurd\", I observed.\n\nThe manager protested that his place was half empty (it turned out to be more than that). But I remained cool headed and just told him to seat me after he seated everyone else waiting (there was nobody waiting).\n\nMy gf and I eventually were seated.  I am 100% certain that the manager decided to mess with me because every single dish came out of the kitchen wrong.  The salad had no goat cheese and was overly slimy.  When I mentioned it, I was given a tiny cup on the side rather than re-making the slimy salad.  The Mac and cheese was under seasoned, my gf's sushi was hastily strewn about the plate, it took 25 minutes for our drinks to arrive, and the first brownie desert we got was so overcooked and burnt it couldn't be cut.\n\nI'm SO glad I ordered the extra spit.  (I'm nearly certain, though have no proof.)\n\nAnyhow, we were there on a $100 gift card and since I will never go back, I tipped the waiter the $25 of change I could have gotten back.  He did fine, it's really too bad his manager and hostess were such clowns.\n\nIf I could shut this place down, I would.\n\nPro tip: Avoid it."

The turkey burger was fine, served with fries that were slightly greasy. The steak sandwich was quite excellent, served on a fresh hoagie with a delicious spiced mayonnaise. The steak was perfectly cooked medium with that wonderful char-broil flavor. The sandwich had green lettuce and some bits of zesty pickled celery, pepper, carrot, and pearl onions that really complimented the flavor of the meat.

I'd also seen lots of fellow Yelpers check in here and wanted to know what all the fuss was about. \n\nUpon walking in we were greeted by at least 4 hostesses. We were quickly walked around what felt like the whole restaurant to our seats. The hostess pulled out our chairs (fancy) and handed us menus. Our glasses were filled with ice cold water. They do have a vast menu and they even have a full sushi bar. The prices are high so be prepared. Since we had intentions of eating someplace else later I was checking out the appetizers, but could not resist their huge sushi menu. Since I was watching my budget I just went with the Spicy Salmon Roll ($8). Dyanna got another specialty sushi roll and a martini and Brent got edamame, soup and some jumbo shrimp. Everything was just ok. Nothing that special and definitely not worth the price. \n\nFancy atmosphere and only meh food doesn't mean your can charge outrageous prices. With Wolfgang right around the corner we might as well have gone there and had amazing food or I guess we just should have stuck to Wetzels Pretzels. Save your money and hit up another restaurant in this ever growing mall."

Also I had the salmon and it smelt extremely fishy which usually means it's not fresh .. Ruined my appetite and sent it back .. Was excited about this place but unfortunately won't be returning"

It was pretty quiet because it was before dinner time, and a Tuesday night. Our server was Jordan and he provided amazing service throughout our dinner. He started off by giving us waters right away. He gave great recommendations and was very knowledgeable with the menu. Some time in between he came back with warm steamed hand towels for us to clean our hands, which was a great touch. Our food came out shortly after. We order tuna tataki, Philly roll, Angus sliders, chicken pesto flatbread, and caprese chicken pasta. Everything was really great, although I'd skip the pasta and flatbread. They were kinda boring and bland dishes. At the end Jordan let us know that if we signed up for a rewards card, we'd receive a free mini tiramisu. We signed up and the tiramisu was delicious. Overall the  service was impeccable and the food was pretty good."

I had the lamb meat balls for twenty some dollars and was less than impressed.  There were only a few and were only an inch or so in diameter. Others had the bison burger which was ok,  but it is hard to mess up a burger. With all the great dinning options in town I doubt I will go back and will not be recommending this place to anyone.  Oh and their largest beers are small and over priced as well."

Okay so be it. It doesn't get any better though. The wine was rancid, the margarita was lame and the main course came 5 minutes after the soups and salads were delivered. It was a disaster and the worse part is the food was just okay. I so want local restaurants to succeed however Crave has some work to do if they are going to last."

Walking in, I noticed how clean and well-decorated the place was. Very clean lines and appealing.\n\nWe sat down and I put my service dog under our table. My girl had the grilled cheese sandwich and I had the chicken & avocado salad with an order of Unagi (sushi). The grilled cheese comes on a rectangular dish with six triangular wedges and a cup of tomato-based soup for dipping. Really tasty. My eel sushi was baked to perfection and quite tasty. My salad was so fresh and delicious. It was SO refreshing in this utterly ridiculous heat and humidity. \n\nOur server was attentive and friendly. I really have no complaints. The food was unique and quite fresh. I would definitely eat here again."

We get there, and after our bizarre waitress swings by to state \"I 'll be back\", we review the menus only for me to see that I was right. They have food that isn't sushi, but I don't eat fish or hot, spicy food so that narrowed the choices down a lot. I went with the stir fry that came out cold. I'm not talking warm, it was cold like someone had put it in the refrigerator to cool it off. I was absolutely done at that point. I just wanted the check. We had already discussed where we should've gone. The next evening we DID and had good food, good service, and a great time, so we were able to salvage Mother's Day!"

Although the wait was rather long and there were alot of open tables (I understand it is they want to pace the flow) we were seated and greeted promptly. Our adorable server Cameron was amazing. He was efficient and thorough in answering all our questions about the menu and accommodating our allergies. Per his recommendations we started out with the Jumbo Shrimp (Mind blowing) and We ordered the Roasted Half chicken and Norwegian Salmon for our entrees. Both were incredible - The chicken was perfectly seasoned - almost had an indian kind of curry taste and the salmon was to die for with it's crispy mustard crust. Cameron seems to be a reader of minds as anything we needed, he got it without us even asking and still made time to chat it up with us amidst the chaos in the restaurant (we probably heard dishes dropped by employees 3 times while we were there). Cameron suggested a coconut cake for dessert which just pushed our meal over the top. We had several managers stop by our table to make sure everything was okay which was a fantastic touch. Amazing, We will be back for sure."

I can say we definitely won't be going back for any of the sushi dishes, as each dish we tried (Mexican Roll, Bamboo Bite roll, and jalapeno tuna sashimi) reminded me of the \"safe\" sushi dishes I would try when I first forayed into the sushi world.  The menu made the rolls sound creative and flavorful, but alas that wasn't the case.  It's been years, possibly decades, since I've used soy sauce on any sushi that I was sad I had to resort to it here.  Without the soy sauce, there was no flavor at all, and that's talking about rolls that purported to have special spices and sauces already added to them.  The tuna sashimi was stringy, and not buttery and I could've done without the cucumber slice.  On a positive note, the sushi didn't come off as \"fishy\" smelling or tasting, so there was that.  After finishing the sushi, again which wasn't great, but wasn't horrible either, my husband and I decided to try the hummus.  On paper, it sounded amazing, served with goat cheese and herbs infused into the hummus, and rainbow cauliflower and toasted baguettes for dipping.  Again, the flavor was \"okay\" but there was too much of a layer of diced veggies dubbed as \"bruschetta\" on top of the hummus that we had to push to the side and the hummus itself had too much of an herb flavoring to it.  We had two bites and finally just opted for a slice of chocolate cake to share.  We will definitely go back and give it another try, as the menu boasted pastas, burgers, steaks, and salads that looked good as we saw them go by our table.  The bar area looked like a great place to meet for apps and drinks, and catch a game or two and the outside seating in the arroyo area of DTS also looked inviting.  Props to our server, who was friendly and efficient.  I'm hoping our experience was just a fluke, and we are open to another visit."

We put our names down. Granted, Crave was the only sit-down food place open. We waited 30 minutes and went back 2x thinking they forgot about us. Now, it was creeping up to an hour. We waited inside next to the over occupied hostess stations. There were a lot of tables open but, clearly not enough wait staff. After we complained again about our wait time, we FINALLY got seated. By now, it was well over the hour mark. Our waiter was prompt but then dropped a BOMB on us by telling us that the kitchen is backed up and that it will take 45 minutes to AN HOUR to get food!!!!!!! 40 minutes for appetizers!!!! We have literally never stormed out of a restaurant! You would think the 5-6 hostesses they had huddled around the one hostess stand would've warned customers about the kitchen wait time on top of making people wait for their tables!!! So, even if you had a reservation, you would've had to have waited a least an hour for your food, and this includes their sushi menu!!!! Unbelievable. Note to this establishment--make sure to either have enough employees to cater to the influx of curious people coming to check out the grand opening or, don't serve people at all, especially if you make them wait from lunch to dinner time! Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to sample the food so, I can't comment on the menu items."

We first started out with a few appetizers before dinner , the chicken wings , Korean chicken bites,  pork dumplings and sushi tempura bites . The only thing I woukd order again was the pork dumplings. Lunch , me and my gf ordered the short rib hash , I ordered everything extra crispy with runny eggs on top , my friend ordered the same but hard fried eggs , the order came out completely wrong , my daughter ordered the bison burger , not only did the whole plate come out cold the bun was frozen,  manager came and asked if she wanted another or something else , she then ordered a sushi roll at 16.95 I'm thinking this better be an amazing roll , hardly the case not only did it fall apart it was small and tasteless. My friends daughter ordered the chicken sandwich which she said was ok and was only order that came out right but was cold too. I didn't even mention the service our waitress just seemed irritated the whole time serving us , enough so I mentioned it to the manager , she seemed to care but not really.  I'm not even sure how they stay in business , good is sub par and so is the service , for the prices I would much rather take my business somewhere else.  However they did take 20% off out bill for all the inconvenience.  I still do not wish to return again I wish they could get it together because it's a great location ."

My friend mentioned to me last week that Crave started their Happy Hour. \n\nAt first I was not sure since I had read so many negative reviews about how disgusting this place because this place are pets friendly. As a person who love dogs myself I think it's nice to have place like that around town. \nI also suspected all 8-9 negative reviews might be friends and I think it's not fair for group of friends speaking about business in all negative thought. People should yelp but let's be fair. So that's why I am trying out this place. \n\nMy message to CRAVE employees is... Don't panic guys.... I didn't take my dog with me today! So I have nothing to complain about pet friendly. \n\nOur server was very nice. Listening to the server from table behind us also told me that everyone are on point for their customer services. I also noticed floor manager were running the food by himself helping out his employees. \n\nIt's a 4 stars since my server forgot my ketchup for my fries but it's not a big deal! I will bring my own package myself next time lol. \n\nHappy hour.. A nice selections of food and drinks. I started with drink and how fantastic their serve my favorite Bluemoon for $4! during HH. My friend went for Kinky cocktails drink which I think it's great value for $4 as well. \n\nFat!!! Chicken wings, Veggie Bruschetta, Tuna roll and Truffle fries are all tasty. \nWill be back again hopefully for date night special dining with a bottle of wine."

The sushi smell will likely knock you over when you walk in the door.The hostess could use some classes on cordiality, and possibly look at you when speaking, let alone a smile. My family and I waited for 30min, to be set at the bar when there were open booths available, not the most comfortable. The hiring manager likes blondes with tattoos, that's clearly evident by the very attractive tattooed waitresses.\n\nFood: I was surprised that I had to pay for the bread basket (usually complimentary), but ok. The burger, well it had a patty. Now the flatbread apple sausage was totally worth all the BS that I had to deal with. Also, the crab cake (with salad) was pretty darn good. For desert, the smores brownie... Or the snores browie... \n\n\nNot really for the fam, Ironic since Summerlin (the target demo) is mostly families.

We showed up & waited for our table for about 10 minutes, with reservations but it was a Saturday night so I guess we let that slide. Our waitress was overly stressed out. We ordered drinks and chips & guac. My margarita came in a tumbler, no salt, very little tequila. Our guac was served with shredded lettuce which I found to be odd. Honey ordered steak, I got steak medallions with asparagus. Food was barely warm when we finally got it, but they were nice cuts of meat. Didn't do dessert because the wait times for even water were just too long. We won't be going back anytime soon."

Service was decent.\n\nThe food:\n\nCrispy rice -  Two large square of pale pinkish tuna that looked like very low quality and the consistency of a well blended hummus.  The pieces were too large and had a gagging consistency\n\nDuck Flatbread - Supposedly a specialty.  Tasted like Fig jam and the duck looked like it was microwaved.  Greens were dirty and flacid. \n\nSushi - very large pieces but not very good.  Too much rice on the rolls and didn't look appetizing or taste very good\n\nDips - Soggy cucumber pieces and cold flatbread with three spreads that were decent.  Best food item but not saying much.\n\nNone of our food went back to the kitchen empty and almost all of the flatbread was on the plate when the server took it away.  No questions were asked if we liked it or if we were just full.   The truth is it was hard to eat any more.\n\nManager looked like she was going to a coffee shop with a very large back tattoo and could only be distinguished when she helped with a credit card.

Upon entering, the restaurant looks pretty nice. It's interesting because craves menu has a bunch of diff options: tacos, sushi, Korean BBQ, burgers...we thought, what the hell? \n\nAs an appetizer, we ordered jalape\u00f1o citrus yellowtail. Prob the best thing we ordered. The fish and mandarin orange sat on top of thinly sliced cucumber. It was so refreshing! 5 TINY pieces for like $12-$13? Also ordered the tomato soup, good but not memorable.\n\nMy husband ordered the 702 burger. He said \"it was good.\" It had egg, candied bacon, red onions, spinach, tomato jam. It was really large, he had to cut and eat it with a fork lol.\n\nI ordered Blackened mahi tacos. First off, it wasn't blackened, it was good, nothing exceptional. It had like a corn/jalape\u00f1o salsa...good but definitely lacked flavor. \n\nOur son had the quesadilla with fries. He didn't like either but that's just because he's picky and tired. \n\nThere is an advertisement on every table that says like half price bottled wine on certain days, kids eat free Sun-Tues 11am-close etc. When we got our bill, our sons food was on the ticket which was fine but we asked the waitress do they not do this on holidays? She came back and said management would honor it even though they do not usually do this for holidays. So that was nice.\n\nThere are better options. I probably would only come back if every other restaurant was packed and I couldn't wait for a seat. Not bad, just nothing special."

I'm gonna try not being bias here as the whole reason of writing a review is to give the readers and idea of the type of experience we had by eating there. So, let's start by talking about their location, service, foods, deals and finally what makes them different from other restaurants.\n\nLocated at Downtown Summerlin in Las Vegas, The CRAVE restaurant has a very good location right by the Red Rock and the luxury theater Downtown Summerlin. I have been eating there since they first started and I have to say that I'm still getting impressed with every new dish I try.\n\nWhat I love about it is their service and deals! I got a royalty card that it's very useful, it's not just a cheap punch card, it's a card made of hard plastic just like a credit card. You can always expect your card to reward you with something every time you eat there. Sometimes it's going to be a simple $10.00 discount, but sometimes it will give you a two for one entree or even a free meal. Keep in mind that their entrees are just out of this world. Their servers are well trained and very happy for working there, which makes the whole experience very enjoyable.\n\nAsk the servers to help you choose something, trust me, they know what's up. But if you are looking for a something specific, you can still dig thru the menu to find it. Their menu is very diverse, from amazing steaks and salads, to poke bows, chicken wings and even flatbreads; everything you order is going to be top quality and presentation.\n\nMy only concern is the price, since their food is so delicious that you might end up spending more than you wanted (happens to me all the time at restaurants like this one where everything is damn good). Besides that, make sure you ask for the royalty card and sign up for their email marketing so that you can get to know about their special deals and events.\n\nFinally, I can't finish my reviews without letting you know what's good there right out of my review. You must order their truffle fries, then try their flatbread and their chicken wings. For your main entree, order a File Minion with Crab sauce and vegetables. They have a great list of wines and beers too. They also have sushi, OMG, how can it get better than that? Well, it does when they have deals that allow you to get two entrees for the price of one! Me and my wife got two File Minions with crab sauce for the price of one!!!' Yes, two top meals for one!!! Of course it doesn't happen that often, so that's why you must subscribe to their email marketing list and get the awesome Royalty card!!!!!! Just an awesome place!"

Yellow with rotten tips.  Didn't look like the chef was even trying to hide the zero quality of the arugula.  I wouldn't call the cook a chef to be honest.  \n\nI wasn't offered any real apology, a free dessert or anything, still had to pay full price for everything and the replacement dish.  \n\nWhen I found the hair, it took 5 minutes and I had to get out of my seat for me to get someone's attention, still had to wait after getting up when finally a manager noticed after a second pass.  It wasn't busy, the service was just poor, neglectful, just sad... The burger was returned and I ordered something else because I didn't trust a cook who served spoiled arugula (that should have been thrown away awhile ago) to not try and recycle some parts of the burger I sent back.  \n\nWater was empty 3 times and had to wait 3 times.  \n\nPeople need to remember, these low star reviews are just showing what people see.  It's always worse than how it looks.  The only reason I went here was because I had stubborn company.  I would guess that the idiot owners have a lot of money and take for granted that this place is in downtown summerlin and resting on the value of the location, so they don't seem to actually care about the quality of the food or service.  \n\nAn infant in a high chair was playing with their paper menu, it fell on the floor and a hostess walked right by it without picking it up.  This table was not situated in a way where I could believe anyone sober could actually not notice it.  The parents didn't see because of how the infant was positioned around the table.  The manager walked by, noticed, and picked it up and put it back on the table.  The infant picked it up and dropped it again.  Things that fall on the floor don't belong on a table... Especially in a restaurant, especially in front of babies that put their hands in their mouth.  In the food industry, there is absolutely nothing, in any circumstance ever, where the right thing to do when something falls on the floor, is to pick it up and put it back where it fell from.  \n\nWhoever owns this place definitely did not deserve the money they thoughtlessly threw into this place.  \n\nThis is my 3rd or 4th Yelp review... Maybe only second... Because I only dump on places that actually deserve to be called trash.  This is not an isolated bad experience, a bad apple... This is pretty foundational.  The staff doesn't need a pep talk or a little staff meeting, it needs an episode on Restaurant Impossible."

Had a variety of choices to choose from.  We started off by the chicken avocado spring roll which was good.  It had more of avocado than chicken.  On to our entree's my boyfriend ordered the chicken, apple brie' sandwich and I got the salmon salad.  When his sandwich came out it was different it than your regular bread it came as a focaccia bread folded in half - Like eating a taco.  It was yummy!  Very good tasting.  My entree' had great presentation and the portion was just perfect - My salmon was cooked perfectly along w/ the other wilted spinach and israel couscous. Every bite was complimentary to everything.  We also had dessert which was good.  You can pick individuals or sharable.  We chose from sharable - Smore's brownie (it said ice cream but it wasn't it was just a marshmallow topping) and the cheesecake w/ rhubarb strawberry topping - Very good but huge.

I was told by family that this was a good place to eat.\n\nThe hostess was friendly and sat us a few minutes upon arrival.   Then greeted by our waiter a few min later.  He asked us if we had any questions on the menu and my friend asked about their rice bowls, and he had to go ask someone about the ingredients, one time was okay, but 2nd time he had to go ask, it just felt like he don't know the menu all too well.  Or am I just being too critical?  Okay, let's skip that....\n\nAccording to the waiter, we came on a \"slow\" night.  So, I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but our food came out FAST!  It didn't even feel like ten minutes before it even came out.  I ordered the Chicken Caprese Pasta.  Flavoring was great in the pasta as well as the flavor in the chicken, but what was bad about all this was the temperature of the pasta.  It was in between cold and luke warm.  How is that possible... it just is.  Some bites that I took was just cold.  The chicken was cooked in a bread crumb/tempura batter and honestly the presentation of the chicken looked burned.  It was a dark brown color, and I was expecting it to be a golden brown color.  My friend order the Thai Curry Shrimp bowl.  It came with three jumbo shrimps.  For the cost of $16 dollars, you would think you'd get a little bit more shrimp.  So if we broke it down, it was around $5 something per shrimp with a side of rice and curry sauce.  Yep, that sums that up.  I honestly would have been better off at an Olive Garden.  At least they served bread with my meal.  \n\nThe server that we had, we'd be in the middle of a conversation and he'd reach over and fill our cups with water and MY CUP WAS STILL FULL!!! He did that several times!  Which started to bug me because my cup didn't need any water.  When we were finished eating, we were still talking and when my water was actually empty, he NEVER came back once to fill it up or offered to fill it up!!! WTH!!!! The whole time I DIDN'T need water he was trying to fill my cup and when I NEEDED water, he didn't even bother filling it.  \n\nIf you do try this place, I truly hope you all have a better experience than I did.  With that being said... Happy Eating!"

            "review": "Walking in on Tuesday night and were sat right away. We were seated at high top table by the bar, we were not offered to be sat in the restaurant or the sushi bar. It was our first time here so we really didn't know the restaurant offered. Our server Stephanie was super sweet and knowledgeable. She helped me pick out a popular margarita, I believe the lime and ginger, to start with. They also have a lot  of beers on tap which my friend enjoyed. We started with the crab and artichoke dip and the bread basket. The bread basket it not complimentary but it's only $2.00. I loved put starters, everything was warm, gooey and flavorful. I asked for another popular margarita drink and Stephanie told me about the prickly pear. I decided to go with it. When it came  out and was a very pretty drink but not my style. Stephanie graciously switched it out for the lime and ginger one. We ordered two pastas to share. The lobster linguine and the lamb meatballs. The lobster linguine was great, nice chunks of lobster, the sauce was buttery and light. The goat cheese meatballs were in a Pablano sauce that was just okay. The lamb meatballs oozed goat cheese but the lamb itself was vey under seasoned and need salt. Safe to say we finished the lobster linguine and just picked at the lamb meat ball dish. We got the chai tea Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e dessert along with, by Stephanie's suggestion, a baileys and coffee with a bit of fransican, I think?  It was a hazelnut liquor from what I understand. Either way it was great. Stephanie also brought us house made marshmallows fluff for the coffee. Oh it was so good! The chai Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was very tasty and a nice twist on the classic. We are already planning our trip back to check out their happy hour!"

            "review": "I want to start off by saying I understand as a server what the job entails and the work that goes behind it.. I am a server at Wynn hotel and we constantly have to give that 5 star service to guests. \n\nI went in today for a late lunch with my sister and my son. We were all pretty hungry and ready to enjoy some tasty food. I walked in and a manager, a man in a button up and tie was at the front on the pos system. I asked for a menu and he didn't look up and handed it to me. He responded but not a lot of engagement or a greeting while I was there. He then walked away and I waited for a hostess to approach me. We had 2 and a high chair... it took her a few minutes to get back to us and sat us. She sat us on the patio, which was beautiful and comfortable. \n\nI got us settled in, looking at the menus to decide on food... 5 minutes had gone by and no one had greeted us... I saw 2 servers. A man and woman talking to other tables but neither looked our way and walked by to say \"I will be right with you.\" I get it.. you're busy but to inform us you are aware of our presence is ALL I ask and that wasn't the case.... I then went to the front and asked if we could get a server. A woman who seem to be a manager or supervisor apologized and brought us waters. She was very accommodating and quick. She then took our orders and brought settings to the table. \n\nI was still waiting on the high chair.. my son gets a little wild when he is on the loose... I got up again to ask the host if I could please get it. At this point I felt like a burden... She was great and I'm sure she just forgot because she looked like she was running around working and bussing tables. \n\nFood arrived about 15-20 mins later and food was okay. I was surprised how small my shrimp tempura roll was... we got the kids flatbread, the roll, tempura bites, and a fried rice chicken bowl. All of it was okay... It wasn't until our food came that I actually got to see who my server was. She came and asked if we needed anything and I requested spicy mayo for my roll... she left to grab it and came back but I saw she didn't have it in her hand but other drinks etc. for her other tables. I waited a little more because I figured maybe someone else would come out with it... she came out and back in another time then started to bus her tables and check on other people. At this time I was getting upset... my son and sister had finished their meals and I was still waiting for a side sauce to use... \n\nWhen she came back around I asked for the check, boxes, and side of spicy mayo to go. To get me cashed out and boxes it might've taken her less than 5 minutes which pushed me over the edge. I spent $44 on my lunch didn't get to enjoy it or eat more than a few bites... it wasn't even expensive but I just didn't enjoy my experience.. at all. They were quick to collect my money from me and send me on my way. I was trying to be as understanding and patient but all in all I felt we were being neglected and other tables had higher priority... I had high hopes here. I am sorry but I will not be returning."

After an hour or so of exploring the new shopping area, we wanted to find a place to enjoy drinks and share a few appetizers. \n\nWe looked up happy hour specials nearby and found that we could still make it to Crave's happy hour. \n\nI really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant - very modern and attractive in decor. We sat at a hightop by the bar so we could partake in the happy hour discounted specials. \n\nFor drinks, I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and one of my friends got the Kinky Mojito. I tried her drink; it tasted sour and I couldn't taste the alcohol. She didn't enjoy it either so she ordered wine for her second drink.\n\nWe all ordered our separate happy hour menu items and shared a Caprese Pizza. I ordered the Pork Belly Sliders and a Philly Roll. My friends ordered fries, Crispy Chicken Bites, a Futomaki Roll, and the Kogi Tacos.\n\nThe food wasn't bad... it was pretty average. The sliders had a unique taste - the pork belly was grilled in a Korean BBQ marinade and topped with a Kimchi relish. They were good, but nothing to rave about. The sushi rolls were rather large but I've had much better. I would not recommend this restaurant if you wanted to splurge on sushi. I enjoyed the fries my friend ordered, they were seasoned perfectly and came with a Peppercorn Avocado Ranch dipping sauce. You can never go wrong with fries!\n\nOur server's name was Joelle and she was very sweet. Attentive to our needs and checked up on us throughout our meal. Nothing negative to say about her.\n\nI would give Crave a 3/5 for the food and a 5/5 for the service. I would recommend Crave only for happy hour drink specials. I think I recall Blue Moons (my favorite beer) being only $4 during happy hour!"

Since we were hungry , we decided to get a \" quick bite \" and go on our way.  The restaurant was not busy and we liked the fact that they were not playing loud obnoxious music.  Then everything went downhill.   In hind site i wish we had just left .  We had our menus which were long and there were about 3 different parts that went with the menu - there was the main one and then I think a lunch one and maybe something else.  The server asked what we wanted and we told her we needed more time but we did want some drinks and 2 waters    For whatever reason it took quite awhile to get our drinks and had to ask a 2nd time for water .  She finally reappeared to take our order and since we had already been there for 20\" we requested an appetizer to ( hold us over ).   Another 10 - 15\" went by  and no appetizer so we grabbed the manager (?)  and he said there was a mix up because of shift change and our appetizer had not been made yet !  To appease us he brought us some calamari (on the house because it had been made by mistake ). After another 20\" we finally got our food, which was mediocre  and our server had her head in the clouds    Could hardly wait to get our boxes and check and get the hell out of there.   Awful experience. All total we were probably there an hour and 20 minutes    Certainly was not a quick bite.  It was  agonizing and we will never return ever !"

            "review": "This midwest chain recently opened in the new Downtown Summerlin complex. It claims to be chef driven -- and maybe it is -- but the quality and execution is on par with similar chain restaurants. The duck confit flatbread ($15.95) was one of the more interesting sounding dishes, but there wasn't enough duck to balance out the sweetness of all the fig marmalade. The lemon garlic wings ($13.95) were huge, but the heavy lemon flavor made them unappealing. The Crave burger ($13.95) wasn't bad. It's a simple burger made up of an angus patty, smoked cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion and their signature burger sauce. The undercooked and under seasoned patty were the only thing holding it back from being a decent burger. Desserts fared much better. Although for someone with a sweet tooth like mine it's tough to screw up chocolate cake ($7.95) -- five layers of dense, moist, sweet chocolate cake. It was, however, lacking a sufficient amount of the orange creme anglaise mentioned on the menu. The S'mores brownie ($7.95) had some enticing elements like the chewy brownie and the marshmallow ice cream, but the amount of torched marshmallow topping the brownie was overload.\n\nWith so many other places in town to try, I'm not sure I'll return. Sure, they have a large menu, which also includes sushi but the combination of that and American food in the same restaurant is an even bigger deterrent to my return.\n\n2.5 Stars"

We stopped by for a late afternoon bite and walked into a crowded entry. The place just opened, why wouldn't it be packed in here! However, that was not the case, there were 4 tables and 2 couch areas opened on the outside patio and the bar area had only a handful of patrons. There were 3 women at the hostess podium who were engaged in their own conversation. It looked like they were trying to figure what they were going to do. There was no friendly greeting nor did they even acknowledge our existence. One walked away, another when to seat the group in front of us, the blonde in the white shirt (I'm assuming she was management since everyone else was in all black) continued to ignore us and stare at her laptop even as I walked up to her. Another girl came by and greeted us, I asked if we could be seated outside. She commented that we can but she's not sure if there were any open tables as she hesitantly went to go check. My Husband commented that there were open tables, she returned a minute later and directed us to the patio. \n\nOur server was friendly, however service was bad. It took a while for him to greet us, take our drink order, take our food order, and our food took 40 mins. If the food was good, the wait time could easily be overlooked. The food is MEDIOCRE AT BEST! Seriously, we travel a lot, we eat out a lot and we love trying new places, nor are we snooty food critics. We simply enjoy dining out and appreciate getting what we pay for.\n\nThe menu is all over the place so I had a hard time deciding on what I wanted. There's sushi, burgers, pasta, salads, etc. There's no rhyme or reason for the menu. I ordered a salad and added a grilled chicken breast, my husband got the crave burger and our daughter got the baked mac n cheese. Yeah, we settled for this because nothing else seemed appetizing and as much as we love sushi I'm glad we didn't order from here. \n\nAgain, the food was mediocre at best you can go elsewhere to get better food. The icing on the cake however was that THEY RAN OUT OF BEER! The server was kind enough to tell my husband that there was a possibility that they were out of Stella and make a 2nd choice just in case. The server ended up coming back because they were also out of his 2nd choice which was Miller Lite. Are you kidding me?? OH and did I mention, I also ordered a cocktail, some dragon drink. I don't remember the name of it nor can I comment on it because I NEVER GOT MY DRINK! I get it they just opened up, but you ran out of at least 2 types of beer at 4pm?\n\nThere's not too many restaurants open at Downtown Summerlin yet, until then go to the Red Rock Casino and enjoy better food and over 150 beers on tap at the Yard House!"

The restaurant has a nice vibe...very comfortable. \n\nOrdered the Kogi beef tacos...\nThe food runner came out with the tacos and another entree looking a bit lost as to where to deliver it to. After realizing that it was our order, I told him we never ordered the second item so he hands it to the bartender who then passes it around the bar asking if it belongs to anyone. It ended up sitting behind the bar for the rest of the time that we were there. \nVery unorganized system they have going on...\n\nThe Kogi beef tacos itself was very bad. I took one bite and passed it off to my friend who eats anything and everything but even admitted that it was pretty terrible. The meat tasted as if it was marinated in butter rather than cooked with it. The bite left a very unpleasant greasy film like taste in my mouth. \nI will not be coming back to try anything else on their food menu."

            "review": "We went here for a family dinner and we were all pretty impressed. Aside from the service glitches, CRAVE is on the right path. \n\nFor starters we placed an order of the cheese and bacon loaded tater tots in addition to edamame. Plain edamame can get pretty boring, CRAVE adds a twist by tossing the edamame in a special sauce blend - so good! \n\nFor an entree, I was craving (ha!) a burger, so I went with the 702 burger and I loved it! The bacon was the right amount of crispy, the burger was cooked exactly how I ordered it and the egg was a perfect touch... in hindsight, I'm wondering why they didn't just call it a breakfast or hangover burger, ha!\n\nCRAVE has a decent beer list, when it's available. It took me three beer brands to finally order something that they actually had in house... Pro Tip: Update your menu as often as you switch out the menu items so that your guests don't get let down. \n\nThe only major discrepancy was the service... the evening wasn't TOO cold so we wanted to sit outside. The hostess was prompt and our wish was granted. The server, not so prompt. I feel like it took her quite a bit to greet us and when she finally did, we were treated as if we were inconveniencing her more than anything. She couldn't seem to get away from our table fast enough... quick to walk away before everyone had even had their questions answered. People have bad days/nights though, so I'm willing to give it another shot!\n\n*2016 Yelp Review Challenge: 19/100*"

Even though we had a reservation and made it on time, we still had to wait 20mins. Not too bad, but you would think they have the table ready for a reservation beforehand. \n\nThe sushi was OK, I had better. I feel it was somewhat plain with the menu only showing the 'standard' specials. Like spicy crunch tuna...etc. nothing too fancy that can be seen as signature. \n\nAs for the entrees, we had a bunch of sandwiches, standard BLT, burgers, etc. the the Kobe burger was the most fancy one. I personally had the saut\u00e9ed Norwegian salmon. The fish was tender, flavorful, but not dry. The sauce was creamy and perfectly paired with the veggies and fish. I recommend this 100%. For this fish alone, I would come back, my husband likes classic burgers so he is good with that.\n\nThe ambiance is nice, very modern, suiting the overall setting of the mall. Only visited during lunch, so we'll see how dinner will be. Perhaps I'll update the review when we have done so with my dinner experience.\n\nStaff was friendly, didn't know the specials, again, went here opening week, so I'm sure everything was new."

The whole front desk situation was pretty disorganized and chaotic.\nWhile waiting, I asked to use the restroom and walked through a half empty restaurant which we were told was due to a \"shift change\".\nWe were finally seated right next to the open kitchen and placed our orders. Plates that were out when we first sat down were waiting for a least 30 minutes before they were finally thrown away. In fact, by my estimation, at least (and probably more) than half of the food put out was thrown away because it sat too long. This didn't make much sense because there were tons of wait staff standing around waiting for plates that were never passed to them. \nI can't speak about the quality of the food because after an hour we never received our food. I had a hard time sitting any longer watching food get thrown away while we waited. \nCrave is the only restaurant open at Downtown Summerlin which seems like it would put them in a great position. If they don't get their act together then I don't see them still being open in 6 weeks when all the other restaurants open."

Keep in mind, they just recently open and like all new restaurants, venues, hotels, there will always be some level of service issue.\n\nI for one can say, we did experience some negative service but not by the staff.  But the organization of the kitchen.  Our experience ended up where dinner turned out to be an 2 hour ordeal, but it wasn't unpleasant as the staff were very tentative and apologetic.  We sat by the kitchen so we were able to see what all the held up was.  So I can ding them for the slow service but I am not going to because service provided by the staff was execellent and I honestly cannot fault the staff for something that is out of their control.  I would say the the GM is to look at your kitchen, your line cook and get that together.  But I won't be harsh because we went on openinlg weekend.\n\nNow for the food, I made two appetizer plates into my dinner; the Pork Belly Sliders with kimchi, Korean BBQ sauce, cilantro and the Kogi Beef Tacos with red miso, napa slaw, sesame.  I was a bit disappointed that the Pork Belly Sliders weren't serve in the steam buns that I am so used to have pork belly with, but the flavor and the meat was excellent!  I may ask next time when I order to see if it is possible to get the steam buns.  Now the Kogi Beef Tacos were my favorite!  I can eat those ALL DAY!  And I might even just order two of those next time as dinner!  The meat was so flavorful and rich, with the red miso, napa slaw to give it that nice sweet and spicy kick!  \n\nI can't find fault in this place.  Food was good, service (staff) were attentive and friendly and I am sure it will take time for the kitchen to figure out a smooth system.  Until then, I will still be coming back!"

The hostesses were nice & since there was an hour left of happy hour and my honey is a beer connoisseur we decided to sit at the bar. Wow, wish we would have just gotten a table. \n\nOne of the bartenders came around & asked me what I'd like to drink. I asked if they had coke. She said \"umm...\" And had to turn around to look at the sodas to see. Then she said yes they did. After she brought our drinks, somehow she disappeared & another woman bartender, Samantha, took over. \n\nNow I'm not sure what was going on behind the bar, but there was some drama & confusion because the three bartenders were muttering to each other. I'm not sure what the problems were but you could tell they were stressed out. I've worked in restaurants before & I understand how stressful it can be, but that's no excuse to give bad service. And that's what she did. \n\nWe asked for menus & decided we'd just order some apps from the happy hour menu. Samantha, in the middle of listening to our order, walked away from us when another bartender walked by her and said something to her. Just walked away! I wasn't sure if she had gotten all of our order or what! Then she came back and said \"I'm sorry\" & looked at us so we ordered again. \n\nBasically once we ordered we hardly saw her again. Pretty sad considering we were AT THE BAR and so on front of her the whole time.\n\nOur food was good, especially the beef tacos & the tempura sushi. Very good. \n\nWhen it was time to pay the bill we put the money in the glass & waited for Samantha to close it out. Only she didn't pick it up. She kept walking back & forth, making drinks, etc. completely ignoring us until finally my boyfriend called out \"excuse me. We'd like to close our tab out\". Pretty sad. \n\nAll in all, we'll probably go back again. But never will I sit at the bar."

Prices are a pretty penny for what you get, but they offer specials like $50/couple Date Night entrees and wine, discounted sushi days, and such. They do offer an \"Under $10\" snack section that trends to small and disappointing, but I guess it's the thought that's supposed to count.\n\nLEMON GARLIC WINGS: I'll start with the positive menu items. Hot damn these were good! Fragrant with garlic, flavorful and crispy, and served as the full wing rather than just the drumstick as elsewhere. Even the bleu cheese dipping sauce, while totally unnecessary because the chicken itself was delicious, was good.\nCRAB ARTICHOKE DIP: This was tasty, decent amount of meat combined with a \"lemony mayo\" that gave it a bit more flavor than other versions. Served with thin triangles of flatbread, but we mostly at it with the aforementioned tortilla chips. Though there was crab in this dip, there wasn't much in the way of artichoke, surprisingly. $15 for a small, shareable appetizer portion.\nCHIPS & GUAC/PICO: Chips with guac and chips with pico are both listed on the \"snacks\" section, and they're fine. Portion is small to match the $5 price tag. Guac was fresh, pico was boring and bland. Having a solid house salsa would be a better option.\nNEGIHAMA ROLL: Simple maki-style roll with a white fish, seasoned with some green onion and a hint of ponzu. Fresh and tasty, if a bit on the boring side. Can't really argue with the $5 price, kind of hits the spot if you're craving sushi but don't want to do a full meal of it.\n\nService was lackluster: initially walked in to an unmanned hostess stand, as we debated whether to dine elsewhere, she returned and told us to seat ourselves if we were going to be in the bar area. 15 minutes later, no one had acknowledged us so we went back to the hostess to receive an actual table. She didn't seem surprised or apologetic, so this may be the norm. Server was less than efficient and not particularly personable. \n\nAs other reviews have stated, the menu is all over the place with apps, pastas, burgers, fish dishes, and sushi, leading to a 'jack of all trades, master of none' feeling. Despite sampling a few different types of dishes, I can't honestly say there's one they do best. Will likely be coming back to try their date night or sushi specials. \n\nNOTE: For those with Celiac disease, they do offer a dedicated GF menu that isn't as sparse or boring as other places."

I think they may have been a little understaffed on this night but our waitress was moving as fast as possible. The Tournedos were served with mashed potatoes and asparagus with a peppercorn sauce for the meat. Meat was tender and tasted great. The sea bass was served over rice with a pesto sauce. I had a bite--flaky and excellent flavor. The place was hopping this night. We were very pleased with the meal. Couldn't beat the 2 for 1 deal either."

Started with a blueberry lemonade which was good, but not the best I ever had. It was more of a mojito and I'm never one to hate in a good drink.  Moving on to the Crab-cakes with jalape\u00f1o sauce. They were a bit on the sweet side and the jalape\u00f1o was very, very lacking.  The salad with baby greens and tomatoes was good.  Then we ordered the pork belly sliders.  Huge disappoint and maybe I'm just spoiled ( I blame a certain somebody for that) but none the less pork belly was a little to chewy for my taste and the garnish in it has a refrigerator taste.   The Kobe beef tacos were actually one of the better items. If you order this is probably a must just ask for garnish in side as it made the tacos soggy, but the meat was cooked well and very tasty.   And last but not least the Mac and cheese with sausage was good.......yes, here it comes it lacked salt or some sort of a step up to make good and something worth recommending .  The sad part is after i posted I was here then I got comments that this was not the place to eat. To say the least I feel like I spent money for something I didn't enjoy.   Our server was nice and accommodating and that is the reason they get two stars.  This place seems to have potential , but food needs a bit of a rework and the presentation needs to be part of that stepping it up!!"

First impression, 5 stars! From the time we entered, to the hostess seating us and so forth...wonderful! I was excited to stare at the menu. The menu wasn't overwhelming nor was it needing more. Remember, tis all an opinion! \n\nI was tossing between a bison burger which has pork belly, cilantro, and a couple more add-ons that I can't recall. I just kept reading pork belly, pork belly, pork belly. Lol. Not one to eat pork too often, although, I do enjoy some good home fried or bbq pork belly a few times in a year. So, passed on the bison burger. I ended up ordering the chicken caprese sandwich which is basically chicken, mozzarella, arugula, tomatoes, a drizzle of the balsamic glaze, and placed in tandoori bread. Which is pretty much a pita bread.\n\nHow boring I know. But I love caprese anything! Simple ingredients but it could easily be messed up! Plus, it was 7 something at night and i didnt really have the stomach for a burger even though deep down inside i was longing for one. \n\nWhen I received my order I thought, aww....this looks deelish. I took a bite and thought damn, I need more of that balsamic glaze because there were droplets of it in my sandwich and I needed more since I could barely taste the balsamic. Waved our waiter down and he happily gave me more. Which by the way our waiter was always in sight!  Alright, so more glaze to drench this sandwich in. \n\nI didn't really care for this type of sandwich with the tandoori bread. It felt sloppy. It was like eating this giant taco with each bite I had to ensure I gripped that sucker or else it'd fall apart. Annnnd if you didn't bite into it methodically it could get messy. But, probably because I added a little more glaze? Not sure. But it was a little uncomfortable biting into considering it is labeled as a sandwich.\n\nThe fries were crispy with a mush. I don't even know how that happens, but I liked it. Didn't get the parmesan fries for a 2.5 dollar upgrade...so regular fries it was. \n\nI can only offer 2 stars because of the staff and ambiance. My food wasn't something that blew me away or thought, hell yes I'll be back for THAT caprese sandwich. The husband ordered the sandwich that had the apples, brie, and grapes? He usually likes that combo but he too thought twas pretty basic. It truely felt it lacked effort. I mean, how exciting can you make a caprese sandwich. Believe me, I've had perfectly executed caprese whether twas a salad, slider, flatbread, bruschetta, etc....you get it. This really was pretty blunt.\n\nWill I be back? Ummm....maybe just to try the other things in hopes to up my review. How soon? Probably not that soon because there are so much more other eateries there for me to experience first. Will I recommend it? Ummm...probably wouldn't be a place during a convo where I'd even mention it! Nothing memorable. But I wouldn't count them out only because it was my first time there and I only tried 1\n food off their item. \n\nI do love, though, how they serve each child a bowl of complimentary fruit as all the adults read through the menu. They were very quick to bring that out. That's the way to shut these gremlins up so us adults can focus. Lol.\n\nYou try for yourself kind of place.\n\nDefinitely kid and stroller friendly! Oh, and a highchair with an actual working buckle!"

Their signature drinks are really good, I tried the Michelada (which is great if you like spicy items), Raspberry Ginger Gimlet (was super good, very refreshing, somewhat sweet and with a great flavor) and the Angry Dragon (also a very tasty and flavorful drink) if you are not into prepared drinks they also have a large selection of beer. \nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is very inviting. The decor is fresh and modern but somewhat relaxed at the same time. \nWe tried the mini chicken apple sauce flat bread which was good, but nothing that I would be craving. The crispy chicken bites were just ok, but again the size portions were small. We ordered a few rolls and they were no big deal, I'm sure I can get the same quality at Smiths. Overall a good place for drinks, but there are probably better options out there."

The server seemed put-out by the 5 of us being there. We ordered our drinks and the other 4 people at my table got them at one time and my glass of wine came 15 minutes later. When it finally arrived, he said \"Sorry, we had to open a new bottle of wine\". Since when does it take 15 minutes to open a bottle wine in a mostly empty restaurant? Then the food finally came out and the guy quickly disappeared before my husband (who got sushi) could realize he had no chop sticks! Since the server didn't return for 15 minutes, he ate half of his dish with a fork before he could even ask for chop sticks... fail! Then he brought us the bill and disappeared without saying anything. We were like, wait, we wanted to order another round of drinks. What if we wanted dessert?

Which is what I am going to deduct stars for...And my mom was not impressed with her chicken farfalle. It was a 20.95 dinner priced item (it was also a lunch sized portion that they only charge you 13.95 during the day for). Don't order it unless you're there for lunch... Not worth the money and you won't be getting extra food... Or even a dinner salad with the dish.\n\nMy dinner was great... Price point was on point. They accommodated me totally, Being vegan and Taking out the sashimi and adding a few extra cucumber and avocado rolls. The veggie roll it came with was delicious and flavorful. The rice was just a tad but dry... And I would always prefer brown over white... I'll ask next time if that's an option. It was 13.95 for a lot of food... Saving them some stars..\n\nThe edamame app was severely over priced.  8 dollars for a child sized portion... I'm not sure why I even ordered it or what I was thinking... But it wasn't worth 8 bucks... I could of got 4 large bags of traders joes edamame... For what I spent on one serving there. Never again. Please note they use fish sauce... So order it steamed... With just Lemon and sea salt if you are vegan. \n\nThe server was really accommodating and sweet. She was on top of the table and we never had to ask for anything. She was knowledgable about the menu and accommodating to my life style. I probably will come back for happy hour... Or lunch... But 50 bucks for dinner... For the two of us... For two mediocre dishes is not really my thing... My dish was amazing and so was the service. That's whats earning them three stars. Get your prices together guys! If I'm spending 20 dollars on an entree... I don't want the bottoms of my table to be balanced with napkins on the ends of the legs to keep it from wobbling... Or having a free stoli bright read umbrella over my head... Yes those are free from\nThe liquor reps... Fix the patio decor and ambiance... Throw a candle on the table...

The food was fine, and the price was right--especially considering that some of our $20 lunch was going to a good cause!\n\nMy husband had the avocado rolls and the Crave burger. Not much to say about the rolls, but the burger was pretty good. I had the edamame and bento box, and I think I got the better bargain. The edamame was delicious--among the best I've ever had--served warm with a tasty Sriracha soy glaze. The bento box was chock-full of delights, from fruit and salad to fried shrimp and four different types of rolls (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and cucumber). We both had the mini blueberry cheesecake for dessert, which was served parfait-style. As I said, the food was fine, but nothing (except for that awesome edamame) was compelling enough to bring me back.\n\nService was good, although they brought out our entrees before we had finished our appetizers. While waiting for our food, I read their happy hour menu, and that looks like a promising deal. Much of the menu reads like the Yard House happy hour, which is one of my favorites, so if I lived nearby, I think I would stop in occasionally for that. But otherwise, I think I will try one of the other Downtown Summerlin restaurants next time I am in the area."

We were early for our reservation but they were able to work with us and provide us a seat. We came the day before Valentines day for a Prix Fix dinner for two. Price was 89.00 before taxes and drinks. Our waiter Jake came right away and gave us water and requested a drink order. We had not seen beverage list and asked him to return. He came back soon after took drink order.( was very impressed with his service considering how busy he was). I want very hard to describe Crave. Its not upscale, or bistro. Has a bar in front open restaurant with open kitchen. It was loud and hard to talk over the din at times. They were quite busy and despite that they did have great service. The Prix Fix Menu had choice 4 items for starter and 4 items for entree and the desert was a duo that came together. Starters were for us Bronzed Scallops and Coffee and Pepper Crusted Petite Tender in Chocolate Port Sauce. The Scallops were perfectly cooked however had a fishy smell that I am not used to with Scallops. They did taste good and were rightly cooked. The Petite Tenders were cooked mid rare and the Chocolate Port sauce was very interesting. When added with the Coffee pepper rub on the meat it gave it a sweet mocha taste. Not bad just different.\nEntree....Salmon and shrimp Duo and New York strip. Jake did not ask how I wanted my steak cooked. When I told him Mid Rare he stated \"is there any other way\". So be warned if you want a more cooked piece of meat (and why would you) you must ask. Mid rare is their way. (Yay). Steak was actually bigger than I expected for a Prix Fix dinner. Had great flavor, the red wine reduction was quite nice also. Garlic mashed and Asparagus. Asparagus was nicely cooked on the grill and properly flavored. Josie had The Salmon and Shrimp. Both cooked perfectly. The shrimp had a crispy skin that added perfectly to each bite. There was a carrot Ginger puree' under the Salmon. The flavor of the puree' is hard to describe. Almost like a pumpkin spice but not as bitter. I kept wanting to eat off of Josie's plate. \nDessert....Duo of Chocolate cake and a Passion Fruit Creme Brulee. The cake was okay, the Brule was grainy and flavor was more Lemon than passion fruit. \nAll in all it was a good meal and experience. Service was excellent and food was quite filling. Again very impressed with the portion size for Prix Fix meal. We will return again. If you are shopping or going to a movie in Downtown Summerlin it's a good eating spot."

The rice noodles they replace the pasta with were soggy and I could only get two inch pieces at most on my fork, because they were so overcooked. It was in a green sauce. Not sure you could say it was cream sauce as most of it was soaked up by the noodles and it was green? Can't understand the choice of rice noodles as there so many other options of pasta that taste amazing as GF. The meatballs were completely dry and tasteless and the tomato garnish was as dry as a potato chip. Maybe an attempt at their own sun dried tomato? Not feeling this restaurant.

            "review": "Ugh. This review is long overdue. I purchased a Livingsocial voucher for Crave. The deal was $58 for a three course dinner for two that included an appetizer, entree, and a dessert from a select menu. My husband and I came to Crave to celebrate our 10-year anniversary together. \n\nCRAVE STARTER SALAD ($7.95): The ingredients sounded exciting but the salad tasted pretty average. Nothing special here. 3/5\nPOBLANO CAESAR SALAD ($7.95): The polenta croutons were an interesting touch and the mister approved of the salad. 3.5/5\n\nGRILLED MAHI MAHI ($26.95): He thought it was alright but complained that the shrimp was really rubbery. 3/5\nLOBSTER LINGUINE ($28.95): Got it without the lobster, of course. The truffled butter sauce was extremely rich and got old real quick. After the third bite I was not feeling this entree at all. 2/5\n\nCOCONUT CAKE ($7.95): The cake looks beautiful but tastes like a store bought cake. I was really disappointed. 2/5\n\nVIBE: Crave is a nicer restaurant with a fancy bar and a proper staff. The bathrooms are gorgeous. On a Tuesday evening, the place was nearly empty. I found it interesting that upon getting seated, our server handed us warm moist towels to clean our hands. That's a first. 4/5 \n\nSERVICE: Started off with a bang but faded off into obscurity. Our waiter disappeared and it took a while to get refills and get the check. 2.5/5\n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nAfter all was said and done, me and my husband agreed that even with the Livingsocial deal, our meal wasn't worth what we paid for. Nah, we won't come back. The highlight of the meal for me was the salad. Nuff said.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #136"

I suppose the food was good but finally after over an hour we still didn't have any food even though our server said it would just be a few minutes about four times, even saying they would take 20% off our check, which really equates to a tip they wouldn't have received and didn't deserve anyway. They seem to cater to the bar group.  There really weren't that many people in the place.\nThe menu is way too extensive to begin with.\nBy the way if this place makes another year I'll be very surprised."

Waited 25 minutes for our food.  Wife ordered pulled beef tacos and I got the chicken caprese pasta.  Pasta was over cooked so a little mush (angel hair).  Hair tacos were nothing special.  The flour tortilla was dry and a little hard.  Our tempura appetizer was mushy and, again, not great.\n\nGood place to get a drink maybe, but not so much for dinner."

They enjoyed them and said they were juicy and full of flavor. I had sushi, which was great as always. Our waitress made us some sort of lemonade concoction she recommend...turned out to be delicious AND bottomless! \n\nThe only thing I noticed was the hostess (seemed to be new) disappeared from her booth. We could see the main entrance from where we were seated. We noticed a family with two small girls waiting around to be seated for almost 15 minutes. The bartender eventually saw them and apologized. That's the only down-side I saw. Even when it gets slow, make sure your hostess is where she's supposed to be. \n\nOtherwise, great food and service at our table! Will be back."

This was a special day resulting in let down and disappointment to say the very least. Shame on Craves management team for enticing return/repeat customers such as ourselves via online advertising to \"book reservation for Mother's Day brunch\" using LAST YEARS 2015 Mother's Day brunch PHOTOS of their previous brunch buffet layout. The only reason we returned for this years Mother's Day is because of said brunch buffet. Ultimately, their management team should refrain from using BAIT and SWITCH shameless tactics. Word of mouth is what brings business in, not lies. There are many wonderful Restaraunt options in Las Vegas to choose from. Why would anyone choose this establishment for special occasions, when they participate in unsavory deceptive advertising?"

Sushi roll was 20$ but a fairly larger portion.\n\n I got the mahi mahi. It was to die for! A burst of flavor! It had hints of pecan and cinnamon on a bed of shrimp rice. My friend got the apple sandwich that came on pita. Very good, great for a tasty lunch. \n\nWe finished off with The tiramisu shooter, and the chocolate cake. \n\nEverything was excellent! We will definitely be back next time we spend our day in dt summerlin!"

We walked in and was greeted by a wonderful hostess, she was friendly and polite.The decor here is very beautiful.  We were seated as a party of 6. Got menus and waters right away. They have a variety of things to choose from to eat. We ordered all sorts of stuff and we were able to share and try everything out... FOOD was BOMB.... Service was BOMB also. When Im back in Las Vegas I will sure to be back. The one thing that I noticed was we sat at a booth and if you want a more romantic and intimate setting they have a curtain which I assume you can close so you can have your privacy,,, Very cute for couples..."

I decided to go to the sushi bar.  I should have known when not one person was at the sushi bar that something was up.  We ordered tuna and a spicy roll of some sort and  It just wasn't fresh or very tasty.  We were so disappointed.  Giving it one more chance, we ordered one order of salmon and another type of tuna sushi and both were just OK.  \n\nOn another note, the service was great from the server that brought our wine.  I will return to the restaurant for their regular menu as it does interest me but I will not return for sushi.  \n\nOh, one more thing, there was no soy sauce at the bar.  After asking for some low sodium, the server came and poured a way too generous amount in our dishes.  He sould know to let the customer do that, as we like to get a certain amount in the dish to get the consistency right with their wasabi."

The problem here is that they have cranked up their own music outside, which conflicts with the music played by the mall.  It's unpleasant, to say the least. It makes it hard to think, let alone chat.\n\nI ordered the chicken with lemon and garlic sauce for $22.95.  Sadly, it tasted neither like lemon, nor garlic.  It was really bland.  It tasted most like plain grilled chicken sans salt and pepper.  My husband ordered the chicken stir-fry, which was also bland.  It lacked seasoning and the vegetables were over cooked. This was not anything either of us would come back for, let alone \"Crave\". \n\nWe hope they improve the taste of their food so they can live up to their name."

I had the Bison burger which was amazing and also the sliders to start. Also amazing. The only thing I didn't like was the butterscotch pudding for dessert slough it was risky probably to order it anyway but the texture was a little strange and it was too much. But that might just be the butterscotch flavoring. I dunno but other than that great experience. Will come again for sure one day."

I was beyond disappointed. I made a reservation through opentable.com for a party of two. Upon arriving I was greeted by a very polite hostess who asked where I would like to dine (inside or outside). I of course wanted to dine outside because the weather was perfect. So here's where the train started to wreck. We waited for our server for approximately 15 minutes. 1 person came up to tell us that she would be right with us and then she didn't come over as soon as we expected. Now don't get me wrong she was a very nice and polite server but that doesn't cut it when it comes to moving quickly and efficiently. The excuse that they may or may have not been busy can be forgotten. In this case they weren't! So for my appetizer I ordered the CRAVE stack sushi roll and my partner ordered the Crunchy Roll. The sushi was just OK..Dragon Fruit martini was good! For dinner I went with the 702 Burger that was recommended by our server which I wasn't impressed at all. Took OVER 20 minutes for two burgers to come out? Really?? And then to comer out not even the right way? When it came out the bacon was BURNT..like burnt to capacity! I showed my server and even she agreed that was unacceptable and that she'd have some more bacon sent out to me. Fries were cold on both of our plates had to have more fries sent out. The problem is that it took about 15 mins for that and I literally was damn near done with the burger by then. My partner had the CRAVE burger and he to was not impressed with the burger so I'm really not sure if we just caught them on a bad night (if they are allowed to have those) but yeah the jury is still out on whether or not I will be returning or not. Management hopefully reads these reviews because clearly the general consensus is that they need to get it together.. I can now see why they are rated an average 3 star! I really wanted to like this place especially because it's so close to my house.."

It was ok. The steak was cooked right but I felt like I spent a lot of time chewing, more than normal! I left two medallions as I just couldn't chew anymore. Pureed potatoes were fine, nothing special. The grilled, burnt brussel sprouts were not the best, though I ate half for the nutritional value. The candied carrot drink was different and ok. Again, ordered that for the carrot juice nutrient.\nThe server came to the table a few too many times and always when I was chewing. Give it a rest after your first check on the food stop by. Just keep an eye on drinks. I may go back once more for another item. Husband enjoyed his sushi."
