The only thing I enjoyed was the Famous Rigatoni, very flavorful and delicious.  The baked ziti pasta was very bland and tasteless.  The surf and turf was a mistake for a pasta place."

I had read the reviews about Maggiano's catering to their gluten free patrons and looked forward to our visit.  We were not disappointed.  I asked about a gluten free menu and the waiter told us they didn't have a menu, but almost anything on the menu could be made gluten free.  They even offered to coat the chicken in potato chips and pan fry it if I wanted chicken parmesan.  Someone pinch me, I must be dreaming.  To make our visit even better we happened to come during happy hour when their signature cocktails were only $6.  YES PLEASE!  I ended up ordering the lobster carbonara and hubby ordered veal parmesan.  All I can say is WOW.  My meal was BEYOND fantastic.  I fully expected tiny pieces of lobster and was astounded when my plate arrived and there were large chunks of lobster.  Both meals were enough for two so we gladly took our leftovers back to our room and had them for lunch the next day.  Hubby's grandmother came straight from Italy and trust me, these meals rivaled hers.  My only disappointment is we don't have a Maggiano's where we live.  Seriously, it was THAT good."

The chicken was cooked just right and it had just the right amount of capers.  It came with angel hair pasta that they put in a separate bowel.  I also ordered a side of grilled asparagus.  \n\nI have been craving this chicken picatta since I finished eating mine! I was informed there is one in San Jose...I will be checking that one out as well and hope it will be just as tasty!\n\nThe restaurant is located at Fashion Show mall.  I'm usually not a big fan of mall food but this was pretty darn good.  Service was slow but they were friendly. There were a lot of people and the wait was around 45 minutes so we decided to head to the bar for seating.  We lucked out and found two bar seats.  \n\nGreat food, decent service, I would go back!"

            "review": "We did a pre fix menu because that was our only option with 11 people. Food was ok. Gnocchi w sausage was alil salty. Veal parm needed to pounded out it was way to thick for veal, chicken Marsala I was told was good but not enough chicken was given for everyone to try, some pasta dish came out but still not sure what it was maybe it had some meatball or sausage in it but it wasn't a red sauce n it was very bland. stuffed mushrooms were stuffed with only bread crumb which was ok I guess. Chef gave us a really nice bruschetta platter which was great n our Apple n brownies were great as well. I am disappointed in the fact that we were unable to order separate dinners, we are not big fans of eating off of plates that others have their hands in and being that it's cold n flu season it was just not a good idea. I manage to get my husband dinner served from the kitchen but the waiter seem annoyed n recommended that I just scoop his first. Well I refused n insisted he get his from the kitchen. Anyway it all worked out. We enjoyed the rest of the evening but will never do a pre fixed meal again."

            "review": "Maggiano's has been a favorite of ours for over ten years now. Unfortunately, the last 4 times we went we experienced awful customer service. We kept giving them \"one more chance\" because we loved the food, but ultimately we gave up and resorted to just getting to-go orders.\n\nNow, I know carry-out is never as good as eating in the actual restaurant, but we adjusted our expectations accordingly and were quite pleased with this compromise.  Until tonight. \n\nWe had a pretty simple order-\nChicken fettuccine alfredo, meatball sub, zucchini fritte, and a side of bread.\n\nStrike 1: they were out of meatballs\nStrike 2: they forgot the bread, although they did give us butter so I guess they thought about giving us bread?\nStrike 3: I've literally had better alfredo at the Olive Garden.  \nThere was no chicken. There was no fettuccine. It was undercooked penne. And I don't mean al dente. I mean stiff and barely chewable. This penne was swimming in what I can only describe as some bland cheese milk. \n\nI gave two stars because the zucchini was amazing, as always. Except \"always\" isn't quite true either because they were out of the zucchini the last two times we had tried to order. \n\nI'm afraid my former favorite has finally run out of chances."

My friend and I had the calamari app, rustic chicken pasta and veal parm. Everything delcious. Even saved room fro teh tiremisu desert which is probabaly one of the best tiremisu's I ever eat. Assad our waited was on top of things the whole time. made sure we always had everything we wanted and very friendly. I will ask for him next time I go. Only reason didn;t give it 5 star is because the items are just a tad bit pricey i think. I have noticed the prices inch up little by little every tiem I visit. But since this is a Vegas strip location, they can do this I guess, since more tourists than locals go here."

It can be busy around dinner time so just be prepared.\n\nThey have a great bar with lots of selection and a very big menu. One of my favorite dishes that actually isn't on the menu (but they will make it for you) is the spinach and artichoke dip. So yummy and so creamy! Their bread is freshly baked and comes nice and hot.\n\nI always order the lemon salmon and it's normally served with spinach and I sub for asparagus and they don't seem to have a problem with changing anything on the menu! If you don't see a pasta that you want they can easily make one for you! (My sis does that)\n\nThe staff is pretty nice, I mean they are pretty busy so you might not feel that they are \"paying attention\" to you but overall pretty good food!"

Service was pretty good, my girlfriend and I came as a short last dinner before heading back to reality. I would give our server a solid B+/A- considering menu explanation, time it took to get his attention, he remembered my to-go order, and we spent less than an hour there from being sat to exiting.\n\nWe had:\n-Side spinach salad with gorgonzola cheese: pretty yummy, I am a fan of gorgonzola but I think huge chunks were a little much, even for me. Dressing was a little heavy.\n-Linguine & Clam: good broth in the pasta, healthy amount of clams\n-Peppercorn steak w/ the Maggiano's sauce which was carmelized onion and such: so yummy; a bit salty so you have to eat it with the mashed potatoes but the potatoes had melted cheese and it was so so good.\n\nDo want to mention that this restaurant did not have the classic \"buy one take one home\" menu options that are available at a lot of other chains, though."

Only mine. -__- \n\nFirst time was a big ass spill..next one went on my bread..third one went on my meal. Come on maaayynn. \n\nBUT THE FOOD WAS BOMB DIGGITY!\n\nWent to Maggiano's for me, and 2 other friend's birthday dinner with everyone! They have a nice little family meal which is a ridiculous amount of food. But it's all you can eat. Doesn't really explain much,  but if you have a big group..I would suggest that you get that. (Although we didn't order it..lol) \n\nService was pretty good. We got some toasty warm bread (yum) and their butter is so  yums!\n\nI ended up ordering the chicken & spinach manicotti. SOOO CREAMY..SO DELIIICIOUS! Comes in 3 decent sized pieces, and I just wanted to savor every bite. \n\nIt's really quiet in there..none of the other customers talk, so for the most part, my friends and I were the entertainment of the night. \n\nWe were seated in the back right corner, so we are able to see the other hotels and what not. All of a sudden, we see 4 cop cars chasing this white car, and it stopped right in front of our view. All of us got up and it was so intense!!!  The police ripped the driver out of the car and shoved him to the ground. Ohmygah. That was good stuff. \n\nAlso, I can't fail to mention..we all got to go boxes and bags..and we took some pictures outside. This was towards the hotels, so away from Maggiano's. My friend left her bag near a trashcan and left her Coach wristlet inside. We were all facing away..when we were done with the picture, she asked where her bag was. We had no idea.. I said to not worry, cause it's just her food..but none of us knew her credit card, iD, and other important things were in it. \n\nANYONE could've taken it! LUCKILY. One of our friends saw 2 homeless men downstairs carrying a Maggiano's bag, and he looked inside the bag and pulled out the food and Coach wristlet! \n\nFriend's bf sprinted down the stairs and charged for the guy and said, \"GIMME THAT BAG!\" & the homeless guy was pissed, but gave it back. If it wasn't for our one friend who saw him, we would've never found it. \n\nJust wanted to share the crazy experiences from Maggiano's :] \n\nBut I would definitely suggest this place! It's really good. Tried all of my friend's food..and perfecto!"

Portions are generous, prices reasonable, and service is friendly, makes this an acceptable place to go in the northern/central part of the Strip (Fashion Show Mall).\n\nOrdered the Linguine di Mare (seafood), it's a decent dish with mussels, shrimp, bits of lobster with pasta in a tomato based sauce.  It's a huge portion but what's up with the tons of mussels?  Extreme dis-portion of mussels, which is more than half of the seafood.  I like mussels so that's ok with me, others may not be so happy.  The noodles need to be cooked longer in the broth as the flavors are not completely absorbed.\n\nFor desert, ordered the tiramisu, very light and creamy, with a strong coffee accent.  This would be a good choice."

I had never been here but took their word that it would be great. Unfortunately, we were all extremely disappointed. \n\nUpon entering, we were all shocked at how warm it was in the restaurant, even with it being 100+ outside, it felt muggy and warm. We were promptly seated but that's where the good news ends. \n\nOur waiter was Billy and he was cheerful and happy to hear we were celebrating my birthday. He took our drink orders and disappeared. This was a common theme during the night. There were times we didn't see him for over 20-30 minutes. Busboys as well, at one point I had an empty water glass for 25 minutes, and as hot as it was in there, I was miserable. \n\nOk, so a review of the food. We opted for the family style dinner for the 7 of us. I asked specifically if they made my favorite meal, penne ala vodka, where the pasta is extra \"al dente\", almost crunchy. Billy said absolutly, all their pasta is made like that. Awesome. We also ordered ceasar salad, tomato & mozzarella salad, fried calamari, balsamic glazed salmon, pasta with clam sauce and veal parmagian. \n\nOn the plus side, the portions were plentiful. But once any plates were dropped at the table, we never saw a waiter or a server again. \nThe appetizers and salads were great. After our appetizers were finished, the busboy asked if we would like more drinks. My brother ordered another pitcher of sangria for the girls. This is important. Remember when we ordered this. But the pastas were horrendous. Mushy and way overcooked. I was so upset since I asked specifically about this. And our waiter was no where to be seen. Finally, 25 minutes after our food was dropped off, our waiter surfaces after we flagged him down. I had also had an empty water glass for about 20 minutes at this point along with 4 others. I tell him what's wrong and he argues with me about it. I just start laughing at this point and tell him to forget it. He says the kitchen can remake it and I say what's the use? Dinner is over! Remember that pitcher of sangria we ordered? Yeah, it finally shows up now. None of us really want it now. Oh, and we had to order dessert. They forgot it was my birthday. \n\nNow here's the kicker. 4 of us end up getting sick that night. Turns out it was the 4 of us that had the balsamic glazed salmon. So my mom calls the restaurant to tell them and to complain about the general bad service we had. They do their due diligence, have the chef call her and tell her they are going to send her \"something special\" in the mail. That was SEVENTEEN DAYS AGO. She hasn't received anything from them. We spent almost $500 on dinner. What a waste for poor service and a lackluster dinner. \n\nPros: portion size\n\nCons: Service, restaurant temperature, food quality, management follow through\n\nAll in all, I won't be back and neither will the 6 other people in my party."

I do have one complaint: during the dinner there was a young lady walking around with the camera, offering to take couples photo. At first my husband declined, as he felt he was underdressed, but she insisted that the photo was complimentary, and lingered around until we agreed. She returned toward the end of our dinner with a complimentary postcard as well as two large photos she wanted us to purchase for $40. When we declined, she went down in price and seemed offended we did not want to buy them, when we did not want ANY pictures to begin with. This really should not be taking place during dinner as it is in bad taste and cheapens the whole experience."

The food was burned and the server was so rude that we didn't feel comfortable with the scene that we thought complaining would have caused. It went sort of comical at first, but the longer the service continued for, the more abusive it got until it was downright hostile at the end.\n\nIt all started with drinks we ordered at the bar; the hostesses told us it would be a 20-25 minute wait, so we ordered there. Our table was ready in 10, so we settled up at the bar (the bartender was incredibly nice, btw) and took he drinks to our seat. The waitress was clearly agitated that we already had drinks and said she didn't bring us bread because we might have just gotten that at the bar too (you only get bread with dinner, so that was a very clear dig). My girlfriend said \"are we being punished for having drinks already?\" when the waitress left the table, and it was obvious we were. \n\n She paid attention to the table's around us and didn't even make eye contact with us. She finally asked about the food hallways through our meal by saying \"it's good, right\" while looking at the plate of burned cannelloni that was sitting mostly uneaten (I'm posting pictures). When a server asked a question like that as brusquely as she did, she sin't looking for the truth, so I kept my mouth closed while my girlfriend said her dinner was fine. She asked us if we wanted desert or more drinks and when we said no, she plopped down our dirty plates back down at the edge of the table and stormed off to get our check. She dropped it at the table and that was the last we saw of her.\n\n We talked it over while trying to make change between the two of us and left her a 10% tip. I don't believe in less than 15% typically (we left the bartender 30%), but she was so rude I think that I should have left nothing.\n\n  I used to take people here all the time (and it was recommended in my Las Vegas list) because the atmosphere was nice, the view is great and the food was reliable. Lately, none of that has been true and I'm done trying to weather out a bad time at Maggiano's. I've been to this location 5 times in the last year (I'm the duke of checkins here on Yelp), but tonight will probably be the last. Disinterested service I can overlook and even incapable service is something I'll suffer through for decent food or the right occasion. I've learned my lesson tonight though; there are too many better places that are only a stones throw away."

Cassy was extremely helpful and always responded to my emails in a timely fashion. I also appreciated how she genuinely cared that I was getting the most for my money. She made great suggestions about how to spend the money toward our room minimum. The workers at Maggiano's did a fantastic job setting up our reception. It looked even better than I had imagined it would. There was SO MUCH food and it was all delicious! My guests all loved the food and some said it was the best food they had ever had at a wedding. This venue is a one stop shop, they referred me to a great DJ, bakery, florist, and limo service too! Thank you so much to everyone at Maggiano's!"

I would give this 5 stars but the server let my tea run out and didnt refill it for about 10minutes after it was empty.

Truthfully left with nothing exciting or inspiring comes to review. If there was one thing that stood out more then the food was the service was awesome. Our waitresses really wish remember her name cause she deserve shout out in otherwise A-OK review. She was super friendly, cracking jokes with everyone keeping the atmosphere positive/festive, on top of our every needs, and personnel touches stood out for me. She had whole separate dessert just for birthday girl. Just happen she was not at the table so took the dessert back and waited for birthday girl come back light the table right in front of her. Great service.\n\nSince it was decent size party we had nine. Terri was able to order family style meal. It reminded me Bucca di Beppo style. Starters we had fried calamari, spinach and artichoke dip, and caesar salad. Entrees not sure the filling believe ricotta raviolis with tomato sauce, spaghetti with tomato sauce, chicken marsala think, and lasagna. Dessert chocolate cake, and one more forgot. By the time got to the dessert was stuffed. None of the dishes had WoW factor at ALL. Some of them felt like lack any depth of flavor. The tomato sauce in the spaghetti and am sure same base sauce use on the lasagna. Bland not even sure if they put salt or pepper in it. The portion size got nothing to say except nice and generous. The pricing not all that bad for strip restaurant. The atmosphere is upscale but looking at the prices reasonable. It located in the Fashion Show Mall so parking is ample and whether you valet or not easy access. \n\nOverall so many more italian restaurant in Vegas that are just as reasonable that food taste so much better. On this night it celebration BeastMode Terri R. not about the food but supporting family. Happy Birthday Terri R.!!!!"

A little too fast if you ask me. I hope they were not sitting under a heat lamp. Fettuccine in lobster sauce was pretty good. Chicken picatte fed two people just fine. The creamy chicken and potato soup was awesome. Next time, I will order a bowl. \n\nService - The service was good. Our waiter, however, wouldn't shut up. Don't you hate it when they keep trying to talk to you and just  go a bit too overboard and waaay too personal with the conversation. It was comment after comment. I could not really enjoy the  time with my friends. At first I felt bad but then I realized that he was borderline flirting with my girl friends. Especially in the end when my friend was trying to get out the booth and he extended his hand an exclaimed \" need some help miss\"? My friend politely said \"no thank you\". While I was thinking in my head \"WHAT A PERVERT\". To be honest, he probably gets off by touching women any chance he gets. \n\nMinus one star for the server that wouldn't shut up."

So we had to stand in the aisle and wait for an adjacent table to open up, so part of our party could be seated there. So, we had a table and a close by booth. This was super disappointing since it was a special occasion and since we had made reservations far in advance and confirmed them. No manager came by to address the issue, offer us a free appetizer for the mistake, or really any sort of apology! Generally, they just didn't seem to care.

Luckily, the bar is open seating and we were able to get a hightop table. Usually I skip the bread on the table but I was starving, so I had a piece. It was very good and I didn't put anything on it.\n\nWe started with the Mozzarella Marinara for an appetizer. I used to love it but last night it tasted like it had been frozen and warmed up in a microwave. (not a good taste!) It came out about five minutes after we ordered it...so I'm not sure how it was prepared.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered chicken parmigiana and it was delicious, as always! It comes with two large pieces of chicken and a side of spaghetti. For dessert, I ordered strawberry cheesecake to go. I ate it the next day and it wasn't the best I've had...but it wasn't bad. Overall, we had a nice experience. If you're a tourist and want yummy food with a good view, request a seat by the window!"

I'm usually quite picky with lasagna too as I had amazing lasagna on my trip to Italy. This one at Maggiano did a pretty good job at an authentic lasagna. Definitely recommend ordering this one here. Price was pretty decent too as it only cost about $11-$12. Luckily even though this is a franchise, food was very authentic and it certainly didn't feel like eating at a franchise.\n\nMy friend ordered Chicken Florentine with Angel hair which was amazing. It was breaded chicken stuffed with spinach, parmesan cheese, and sun dried tomatoes. The angel hair pasta was in house made and it was cooked perfectly. \n\nThe portions were very generous so we didn't get a chance to try the desserts but definitely would be coming back here on my next trip to Vegas!"

Our pasta main course was undercooked, although every dish had sat under the heat lamps/salamander too long. So, tough ravioli, penne (wheat) undercooked but meatball was pretty good. Since we were guests, we did not send anything back. I guess it's just difficult for a well established and popular restaurant to consistently produce good food. But that just doesn't make any sense does it?  What makes more sense is that they get so many customers they'll likely never see again, quality doesn't matter. Good thing there is Yelp."

The Wonder Twins (aka Terri R and Alicia R) invited me and you know I am not turning down a good meal with the hottest twins in Las Vegas. Besides, it's been forever since I step foot in here.  It's had to be at least 5 years and I've been really missing out. \n\nI've only been to one other Maggiano's and that one is located in Costa Mesa.  Maggiano's use to be the place where my favorite sister would take me for my birthday.  All I remember from Maggiano's is a lot of good food, huge portions, great service, and long waits even with a reservation.  \n\nThis Maggiano's is a lot similar to the Costa Mesa location.  This place was packed on Friday, great food, huge portions, and great service.  Only difference, which is a big one, there was zero wait.  I had their Parmesan Crusted Tilapia which was really good and the portions had to be triple of what you get compared to other restaurants. The $20 price tag is pretty good considering that I had over 10 oz of great tasting fish.  After my meal, I washed it down with 3 scoops for their Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.  I offered to share, but everyone in our table had their own treat.  I didn't want to put my dessert to waste, so I killed it. \n\nThere's not too many Maggiano's around in any city.  I believe that this is the only one in Las Vegas.  I've never had a poor experience at Maggiano's and recommend if you're looking for fine Italian food with huge portions. \n\nPS:  Happy Birthday to Alicia R. (aka Terri R's twin, aka my 5K partner, aka my half marathon inspiration, aka Yes, and aka the former Finger Printing Lady).  Ha Ha...and more nicknames to come."

Somehow, I was put in charge of finding a restaurant suitable for all four of us. Normally, I shy away from huge responsibility at work. I avoid the break room so I don't have to ever have to take out the trash. That's just how lazy I am.\n\nAnyway, with this language challenged arrangement, I knew it was going to be up to me (and my two years of Spanish in college) to keep the dinner engaging, organized, and running smoothly. Luckily for me, Maggiano's helped out with the experience.\n\nThe two Chilean clients communicated to me that they loved steak and Italian food. With the help of my Yelp Blackberry application, I suggested Benihana or Maggiano's (and tried not show sadness in my eyes). Ironically, their eyes lit up when they heard Maggiano's and the date was set.\n\nFor starters, the staff here is a superb. The hostess helped me make a reservation for a couple hours later, so I was able to give the rest of the dinner participants time to get ready, as I ran off and went shopping for a little gift for La Novia at the nearby mall. Our server was awesome. How lucky was I that the server was Chilean? He helped out immensely making our Chilean clients feel comfortable, recommending dishes and beers, and making on occasional joke or two. Great guy. Great server. Give that guy a raise.\n\nAs for the food, it wasn't terrible. We had the \"all you can eat family style\" meal, which included two salads, two appetizers, four main courses, and two desserts to share (and share and share) until we were ready to be wheeled out of the restaurant.\n\nAppetizers: We had the \"Calamari Fritte\" and \"Stuffed Mushrooms.\" The fried calamari was average and the dipping sauce was essentially Ragu. I liked the stuffed mushrooms and so did the rest of the group as had another round of it. However, I did wonder why they were not given an Italian name on the menu. Maybe the guy who wrote the menu only took 2 years of Italian in college?\n\nSalads: The \"Chopped Salad\" was a eally good salad. There is no way it can be good for you.  We also had the \"Italian Tossed Salad\" and it was wonderful. Who doesn't love a good tossed salad by an Italian?\n\nMain courses: We ordered 4 different main courses. The \"Spaghetti, Meatball\" and I could have made it better at home. The \"Veal Ravioli\" was pretty good. It wasn't as heavy as I had imagined. The \"Gnocchi, Tomato Vodka Sauce\" was my contribution to the group. The gnocchi just melted in your mouth. It was the best dish all night and we had another round of it. The \"The \"Salmon, Lemon & Herb\" smelled pretty bad. I was afraid to get that on my lips or fingers. I didn't want La Novia to pick me up from the airport and think I was having an affair or something.\n\nDesserts: The Cr\u00e8me Brulee was pretty good. We had three rounds of this. I love burnt cream. We had the \"N.Y. Style Cheesecake\" and it well, it was just plain ol' cheesecake. I think the \"N.Y.\" stood for \"Not Your.\" As in, \"Not Your Style Cheesecake.\"\n\nOverall, the food was up and down and mostly mediocre. It was factory style Italian food that lacked much distinctive flavor. Essentially, it was a pricier version of \"Olive Garbage\" or \"Bucket of Crappo.\"\n\nThis was no more than 2 to 2.5 star food. But the ambiance and staff helped make this a very successful business dinner. So successful, we went out on the town for an adventure that included gambling, karaoke, and general Las Vegas debauchery.\n\nAnd well, I will award another star for that."

The place was crowded, but that was not so much of an issue. The noise level in the restaurant was pretty high, but if you are lucky you might get a table with a good view of the strip.\n\nWe ordered the steamed mussels and crab cakes for appetizer. The grilled salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes.  Kids ate the flat bread pizza and spaghetti with giant meatball.\n\n- Crab cakes were okay, the sauce that comes with it is nice\n- Mussels in red sauce (Diablo if I remember well). When served they smelled funny. My first impression was that the mussels were steamed and a can of crushed tomatoes was thrown over them. Some spaghetti strings were visible, so I was wondering where the sauce really came from?! But, that was not the problem; the smell was just unbearable that I could not eat these mussels. Returned them and was notified by the waitress that it was not the first time that the mussels smelled. Manager came and offered us another dish, we ordered the fried calamari ... and it was okay.\n- Salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes; the salmon was a bit overcooked and was sitting in the juices of the spinach. Not very appetizing to see, I like grilled fish to remain dry when served. The potatoes were really overcooked and very dry on the inside ... they were left to roast just beyond what they needed.\n- Flat bread pizza, not too bad for a kids meal\n- Spaghetti with giant meatball; I am not sure what people like about \"giant\" food, but for me it looks disgusting. \n\nWe were not charged for the mussels nor for the fried calamari, which is great customer service. \n\nOverall, maybe worth a two or three star but definitely not more than that if you grade it on the food."

I usually go for appetizers (caprese, zucchini fritte, mozzerella marinara)  and a main (ravioli, eggplant parmesan, manicotti). One of my friends always raves about the baked ziti. \n\nOne of the best parts is that every time you ordered a main you could get a side of your choice of pasta  (from a list) with a choice of sauce for an extra 1 or 2$. We used to get this to go and eat it poolside the next afternoon for lunch. Cheap (sweet, more shopping!) and delicious!!!! I even brought some home on the flight for friends and family once. \n\n*Obviously not counting my relatives home-made Italian cooking.

There are a number of basic pastas that you can get for less than $15, but these are bare bones dishes.  While still good, you're going to have to spend $20-$30 per dish if you really want to experience what they really have to offer that makes them great.  The atmosphere at Maggiano's differs between restaurants.  The Maggiano's in Denver has a much more classy, and quiet environment with great ambiance.  The Vegas location is much more noisy, usually overcrowded and the service much more casual.  Here's a few tips; make a reservation online, and in the comment box request a booth."

All it came with was a little bit of risotto for $33. My mom's shrimp dish looked like the shrimp wash dumped right onto her plate from the shrimp boats met and came with hardly any pasta, too much shrimp.. Terrible Presentation! Next time I take an out of town guest to have Italian food we will definitely be going to the Italian American Club for dinner and music! I will never go back to Maggianos. I was disappointed, since it had been on my bucket list for months to have dinner there"

(they don't they are 100% beef)\n\nup to this point was was frustrated that everything seemed disorganized, sloppy and chaotic. it took 20 minutes to get bread on the table.\n\n------THE REASON FOR 1 STAR------\n\nwe were given a table outside on the patio and i was in the back corner of the table. as i was sitting at the table i scooted my chair over and back about 5\" it turns out there was a hole about 2-3\" deep that used to have a hand rail post sticking out of it but was removed to make more room.. i fell back in my chair and some how caught myself mid fall to avoid slamming my head into the cement wall behind me. i pop up and my dad said the dishwasher behind me had a look like i almost died and the server next to me said WHEN I WAS IN THE HOLE PULLING MY CHAIR BACK OUT. \"OH YEAH THERE IS A HOLE THERE\" WTF kind of observation is that. if you know about a preexisting hazard FIX IT!!!\n\nlong story short i pulled something my back and was instantly hurting. we contacted the manager who seemed on top of offered to take me to the hospital and call him if i had any problems.  i wasn't about to have my last night in Vegas be ruined by that. for my Pain and all this we got 25% taken off the bill. and i left hurting and in pain.\n\n\ni think this was a weak compensation for the pain the and hazard, have my mom or dad been sitting here they physically couldn't have caught there balance as fast and would have been seriously hurt."

And I decided to check this place out for a lunch date today (2/3/15.)\n\nOkay so I'm not the biggest pasta fan in the universe, and the calorie counts here are insanity. I figured 800-1700 calorie meals must equate to a restaurant that serves huge portions. After eating here, I guess not.\n\nWe waited outside because we had an 11 am reservation. 2 minutes to 11, staff, including back of house, were sitting at tables right in front of the doors, on their phones drinking stuff. Not a good look.\n\nWe entered through the mall entrance. Staff at the bar just looked at us but didn't point us to the podium in the center of the restaurant or acknowledge us. \n\nWe sat at a booth while a boisterous waiter told us about the specials. He talked up a bacon bruschetta ($13.95) and a spare rib dish ($19.95) - both of which we ordered. Brian ordered the steak ($17.95) as his entree.\n\nAbove us must have been some waiter stand because two male waiters were complaining to each other about who was scheduled for the night shift vs day and how it was unfair, blah, blah, blah. Take that ish to the back, not right where customers are forced to listen.\n\nBacon bruschetta was not that great. 5 pieces of crostini topped with a tablespoon of ricotta, a slice of bacon, a single arugala leaf and some balsamic drizzle. That comes out to... $2.79/piece pre tax. It wasn't that tasty and definitely did not deserve a waiter waxing poetic about it. Would not order even if it were $2.79 for all 5 pieces. \n\nPork spare rib dish was quite small and not filling. Amount did not justify the price. Polenta was fried like tater tots rather than creamy like I was hoping.\n\nBrian's steak was ordered medium but was easily well to well done. He was visibly unhappy about his meal. Presentation was sloppy as his meat was swimming in sauce. \n\nDespite an empty restaurant, a crochety, demanding couple was seated next to us. They needed lemons, they needed balsamic, they needed minced garlic, they needed the garlic to be fresh and then fried in the back, they needed the garlic crispier... This was before they even ordered and all this was just to eat the complimentary bread. Then they needed the specials read and then they couldn't decide so they needed verbal descriptions of a handful of the waiter's favorite dishes. It was all I could do to not make a comment to them.\n\nOverall while the restaurant looks nice and our waiter did a fine job, the rest of the experience was lackluster and the food was disappointing and a poor value at $55 total. Would not recommend."

There is always a line, so that is a good sign that they are doing something right.\n\nIt has been more than two years since I have been able to get back to this Italian restaurant. I wanted to see if it is as good as I remembered. When a friend came into town, it was the perfect opportunity to visit. The wait was estimated for 30-45 minutes, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. They make a skinny sangria that tastes like fruit punch. It is lethal and easy to knock back. My friend ordered the frozen peach bellini and it tasted like a smoothie. Most of the drinks cost around 8-10 dollars. Not bad for being on the strip.\n\nWhen we were sat, the server promptly greeted us and filled our water glasses. The service was impeccable. She was friendly, attentive, and non intrusive. \n\nWe had ordered the calamari appetizer to give us some time to decide on our entree. Apparently it took some time to come out, but we did not notice. Caught up in our conversation and snacking on the bread made time go by quickly. \n\nOur waitress gave some great suggestions and I decided on a dish that would help the Make-a-Wish foundation. Right now, they have a few specialty items that Maggiano's will donate a portion of the proceeds to the charity. The roasted chicken farfalle is delicious. The bow tie pasta was cooked al dente, the chicken moist, generous amounts of spinach, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, topped with parm slivers. The broth like sauce at the bottom made the dish light. I was happy that I could get something that was not cream based and not have to settle for marinara. My friend had ordered the chicken pesto pasta and it was good. You must love basil and pesto to get this meal because it is bold. I would order it again. \n\nOverall this was a nice meal. I would not hesitate to go back, but next time I will skimp on the bread to save some room for dessert."

I made a reservation on the phone for 6:30pm, we got there by 6pm so I asked them if we could be seated.  They were still pretty empty at that time except at the bar where they had happy hour so they sat us in a nice booth seat.  Our waitress wasn't particularly friendly but she did provide good service overall.  She didn't go over the specials either but no problem since I can read it myself.  \n\nOrdered the half order spinach salad (I always forget to ask them to leave the dressing on the side.  Did it again this time too and they put way too much).  I remember it tasting a little better but it's probably because there was too much dressing.  I do love my grilled veggies and bacon in it though.  Also ordered the calamari.  It was okay but I wish the marinara was spicy because it tasted kind of plain.  The warm bread with the olive oil and balsamic was yummy.  \n\nI only ordered two pastas for three people (waitress said all their dishes are now \"half order\" sized).  Thank goodness I did too because the portions were still pretty big, plus I was already more than half-full from the appetizers and bread.  Got the pesto chicken linguine and the seafood linguine.  The pesto chicken linguine had a ton of pesto, a little too much but when I reheated it the next day, it was so good.  The seafood linguine had a good amount of seafood and the tomato sauce kept it from getting heavy.  We took back over 2/3 of each of the pasta dishes because we were too full by then, even for dessert.  \n\nAlthough the waitress wasn't talkative with us, she refilled our water, checked up on us, and gave me two little rolls of ciabatta breads when I asked her to box the few pieces left to go along with our pastas.  Good service and she was well rewarded with a nice tip."

He immediately took the order for my nephew (turning 3) who was getting anxious because he was hungry and offered appetizers for the table. We decided on the family style menu and everything we ordered was awesome. I have to come back to Hector's service. He was so attentive, helpful and genuinely seemed like he wanted to be there. Thank you Hector for an awesome family birthday dinner!"

We came in through the back of the restaurant and I was amazed at how beautiful it looked. The hallways were decorated with vintage looking furniture, and the reception hall itself was beautiful. It had a big windown that you can see part of the Las Vegas strip from. Lots of light.\n\nThe dinner was sit-down buffet style. We had three courses: Appetizer, Main course and dessert. The food was awesome, most especially because there was only one dish with tomatoes! This was a special Italian restaurant and I was so happy to be able to try all their food.\n\nThe salad was excellent: fresh lettuce, blue cheese and dressing. There were two types, but I didn't get to taste the other one. The calamari was really good, too.\n\nThe cheese ravioli was a big hit at our table. Something so simple was so delicious, and felt so light in your mouth. There was chicken florentine, a steak with mushroom and then eggplant parmesian. I heard that this one was the best dish out of the main course, but i couldn't sample it. Guess why? :P\n\nThe dessert was cheesecake with strawberries, as well as a fruit plate with pineapples, honeydew, cantaloupes, grapes, strawberries, watermelons. Fresh. everything just tasted so fresh.\n\nThe best part of this dinner was that we found out that this reception place was a restaurant towards the front entrance. There is a full bar, and it looked like really efficient servers. They were all polite, too. \n\nThis is a place to definitely check out if you aren't interested in buffets, or just want to sample a different type of life with Vegas. Definitely a great atmosphere, with great food...and even better with great friends and family."

Then the hostess seats us and walks away. I grabbed my own menu, got my own balsamic because my server was no where to be found. Ordered a second glass of wine and never received it.I can't rememeber the servers name but sweetie if someone orders a $14.00 glass of wine at lunch rememeber to bring the other one. Guess your tips were just that good today that you didn't need that money. This happened a few weeks agao but I was at the fashion show mall today and opted to eat at the food court instaed of having another $80.00 lunch at your restaurant. That's right, id rather eat sbarro than deal with awful service. The food however was amazing! Kudos to your chef, maybe you should bring him to the FOH!"

Fun for people watching during the day (love sitting outside, if not too cold, hot or windy!) then transforms at nite when the 2 windowed walls facing the Strip allow you to dine alongside the buzz & beauty of the Vegas lights. While ambiance is a factor in why I like Maggiano's, consistency is the reason I go back time & time again. I don't believe I've ever had a bad meal or experience there (other than occasionally being sardined on busier nites). Unbeknownst to me, at some point, Maggiano's even changed ownership; I couldn't tell, because unlike other cases when there's an ownership change, nothing about the quality changed. I'm part of their email list so I get emails with coupons every couple months. A few no-fails on the menu: tomato caprese, stuffed mushrooms, rigatoni d (though not great for leftovers, because of the cream sauce), mom's lasagna (had it for the 1st time last nite & it's one of the best, not too mushy), eggplant parm (generous portion), the best chicken parm I've ever graced my mouth with & linguine di mare (substantial seafood). For dessert, if you're still feeling gluttonous, go for the apple crostada... otherwise, we generally get the kids scoop of vanilla bean icecream with hot fudge. Also, keep Maggiano's in mind for Thanksgiving & Christmas dining, if you're in town visiting or if you just don't feel like cooking- they do a wonderful job with the menus & you'll surely have leftovers, for a reasonable price. It's easy to mosey in & be seated right away for lunch but I recommend reservations for any time after 4:00."

We were all starving to be honest and this place had been set up as our go to stop. We received a number of pre-ordered dishes family style that were already included in our costs so I am not sure what the breakdown was, but it was AYCE and we definitely enjoyed the grub.\n\nWe had about 30 guys and took over a gigantic table next to a bachelorette and her party and a bunch of normal patrons. We had multiple courses and the food came out hot and tasty and in portions big enough for our entire table to get enough to eat at once...\n\nPro Tip: Call ahead and get a reservation. A number of people had to wait quite a while in order to get seated who didnt.\n\nThe food was all decent to tasty and the chicken and pasta dish stuck out as the best to me. It had some type of a white (creme?) sauce with it. The dinner also included appetizers and dessert. It's a tremendous amount of food and the only way to go if you dont want to hit up the buffet's.  \n\nThe one thing I will add is that the service is not exactly the best. It took several requests before anyone brought us water or drink refills (soda, tea, beer, etc). It was also a bit difficult to get additional bread n butter. It just seemed to take an inexorably long time.\n\nOverall it was worth it and our service could have been affect by the sheer size of our group. It is hard to say for sure."

Of course I always manage to order anything but pasta so I am probably missing the best part.\n\nI've been here a few times and never been there without a 30 min wait.  Nevertheless I enjoyed the service and the food each time I've been there.  It's not cheap but you will for sure leave with a very full stomach. \n\nPersonally I find the musicians performance somewhat annoying.  Maybe because I have always come here with a group and it's hard to have a conversation with that in the background.  I am not sure if I was on a honeymoon I would like it either.  Just not working for me."

Food was heavy loaded with sauces and it's obvious there are lots of can openers in the kitchen.   Now believe it or not when you have 15-20 people they serve a family style dinner and the food is a higher quality and the good pasta's, the sausage &pepper appetizer is great!

Our orders came out surprisingly fast, as an appetizer we had the stuffed mushrooms, we loved it. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan which was very tasty as well, Italian food when cooked properly is very comforting. Also another thing that I really enjoyed and just shows how well the kitchen is run, was that the bread for the table came out very warm . I hate going to a restaurant and they serve you cold bread. \n\nOverall it was a great experience! Lovely restaurant, nice atmosphere, genuine service, good Italian food and convenient parking."

One waitress was pissed because we were taking a lot of pictures and standing in her way!  OOOOHHHH I'm SCARED - she kept giving us mean looks but WHATEVS.  Getting a group of females together to decided on 2 entrees, 2 salads, 2 apps is like filing your nails down a chalkboard.  Someone has to take control!  I ordered a Reisling and sat back to watch the fireworks show.  With large parties, the restaurant STRONGLY \"suggests\" ok forces you to have family style, which is FINE by me.  It actually works to your advantage because then you aren't squabling over the damn check.  Of course we had one in our party that was a squabbler and a little bit of a pouty puss and was mad when she didn't get her own way.  Well OKAYYYYYY.  So we finally decided on the chopped salad and spiniach salad and the bride is Jewish so we asked for bacon/pork on the side, which was no problem.  The brushetti was awesome, the bread great and the spinach dip was ok, kinda like the frozen kind, just ok.  The ravioli was great!  The waiter even brought me and another girl a sample (large sample) of the pesto with chicken and it was my FAV - we both wanted to order it for the entree, but because of the family style, we couldn't.  Two people wanted to order off the ala carte menu, which they said was fine, as long as at least 6 wanted family style - that built in gratuity is a blessing because at the end of the meal, which was $22.50 per person, I ended up putting in $35 which covered my dinner, wine, tax and tip - couldn't beat it with a stick.  The food is 10000000000 times better than stinky old Buca di Pepto Bismal!!  I highly recommend this place and I'm a picky eater.  LOVE IT"

I had never heard of the chain before because I am not really an Italian food fan and tend not to notice those restaurants around town.  I went here for the first time for a friend's birthday dinner a while back and have been hooked ever since!  \n\nBefore Maggiano's, I was a pasta hater.  I know, I know, I am a weirdo, but I just wasn't into any pasta.  I would only eat it if I had to, but it was never a first, second, or third choice for me.  That was until I had the Chicken and Spinach Manicotti.  This is in my Top 10 dishes ever.  That very night after eating this dish, I kid you not, I had a dream about it.  Yes, when I have a great meal, I will dream about it.  I still get this dish 99% of the time.  Every time I get it, it makes my whole day.  If I could get away with it in public, I would totally lick the plate to get all of the sauce off because I don't want to waste one drop of that awesome Alfredo goodness.  When I do try a different dish, I often feel like I am having a food affair and cheating on my precious manicotti Yes, I love it that much.\n\nI have tried a few other dishes (while having a food affair) and they have all been good.  I really have enjoyed the Chicken Saltimbocca, Eggplant Parm, Lasagna, and the Beef Tenderloin Medallions.  I don't think I have ever heard anyone I was with not like one of their dishes.  Yummy yum.\n\nThe kid's menu is also fantastic as well.  The food is awesome adult quality except it is just a little more friendly to a kid palates.  They have all sorts of pasta options, chicken fingers, and pizza.  The kid's chicken fingers are ridiculously tasty because yes, I steal my kid's food on occasion.  Every kid's meal is $5.95 for a big entree, dessert, and a drink.  This is a better deal than a lot of restaurants that serve kid's mediocre food.  I love a good deal!\n\nOne good tip I have for you is to make a reservation ahead of time.  This particular location always seems to be busy, no matter what time of day.  They are on OpenTable.com, so making a reservation is super easy 24/7.  \n\nIf you have never been to a Maggiano's, you should give it a try.  And of course my recommendation would be the Chicken and Spinach Manicotti!"

The service is always just as impeccable and I'm glad to report that the same experience that I've always had at Maggianos carries over to Vegas as well.\n\nWe happened to make it during Happy Hour although it was a sheer coincidence. We started off with the chicken balsamic flatbread for $4 and a couple glasses of wine for $5. Woohoo! The chicken balsamic was divine. All of the flavors and the light and airy flatbread really helped make this a light but delicious appetizer. On to the entrees. I had the mushroom ravioli with braised veal. The sauce was lick-the-plate good and I found myself scooping up as much as I could with my fork. I don't feel that the veal added much when eating it in the same bite as the ravioli, but I ate it separate drenched in the sauce and I preferred it that way. My husband had the chicken and shrimp ziti and while it was good, it wasn't anywhere near as good as mine. I like my ziti spicy and this was pretty mild in comparison to my personal preference. We also had the creme brulee which had a little bit of orange liqueur in it, as well as a strawberry on top. YUM! Best part of the meal, of course. I'm a sucker for burnt sugar and custard, what can I say, but I thought that the orange really added something different to the dish. \n\nOur waiter gave us amazing service (very attentive) and he was also very attractive--two unrelated things, but hey -- I have to appreciate a fine looking person when I see one.\n\nMy only complaint was these jerks next to us allowed their three children to run across our half of the restaurant. It was all I could do to not get up and ask the mother to control them. One of the other waiters asked her politely twice to please take stop allowing her children to run around like it was Chuckie Cheese, but she continued to allow them to knock things off neighboring tables and climb all over booths. It reminds me of a Yelp Talk discussion a few weeks back about why children shouldn't be allowed in fancy restaurants. I never had much of an opinion on the issue until this experience, although I can't knock Maggianos a star on it, as they did try respectfully to take care of the situation."

The wait staff is so stressed out by all the drinks, bread, meals, desserts, and checks that they barely have a minute to be cordial.\nI equate Maggiano's with romance-dark setting, big booths, great music and good food. Well, sadly the place has turned into family heaven. There was every age group of child from infant strapped to his dad's chest, to toddlers in strollers parked in the isle, to children throwing tantrums, to teens glued to their iPhones. Sorry to say, just the sights and sounds of all these children during my meal turned my evening into a spectator event rather than a romantic dinner. I suggest keeping the kids with grandma or the babysitter, but probably most of the kids we saw were tourists so I think I will just try my luck at a different Italian restaurant off The Strip."

Since my mom and I didn't really know what we wanted to eat for lunch, it was a why not kind of thing. We got there and was seated  within 5 mins, granted this was a lunch hour so i'm guessing there were fewer people there. \n\nPersonally, i didn't like our waiter. He sounded insincere. i know that they don't really care whether you've eaten there or not, or if the food it good or not, just act better.\n\nWe ordered the fried calamari for the appetizer; i really liked it. My mom ordered the shrimp and crab imperial; that was yummy. My dad ordered some lobster alfredo; that was also delicious. I ordered a steak bruschetta(sp?) and it was absolutely delightful! it was the right portion and i loved eating it. since i'm not a food expert, that's all i can give with the food.\nThe blood orange italian soda tasted good too; it comes in a fancy bottle.\n\nOverall, i much enjoyed this restaurant ^.^, but if i ever want to eat legit italian food, it would be at my friend's house."

Everything on the plate was soggy, tasteless and gross. I realize one shouldn't order roasted chicken at an Italian place, hence why this place gets 3 stars instead of 2!!\n\nOverall not a bad place to dine on the strip but with so many fabulous options in Vegas it's hard for me to endorse this place.

We made reservations for 5:00 pm (a month ago) at their Las Vegas location and they did not seat us until 6:15 pm.  I was not happy, but really try to make the best of this special day.  Waiter was overworked, came to our table maybe three times.  I felt like the whole thing was a big rush, did not enjoy at all.  Could have stayed home, cooked and saved the money we spent.

It was one of the best decisions we made!!\n\nWorking with Beth, Assistant Banquet Sales Manager was awesome. We emailed back and forth prior to our October 13th reception. She was easy to get a hold of and very helpful. \n\nWe had 25 people attend the reception. They put us in the DiCarlo private room. We decided to go with the 2 hour reception, all you can drink/ appetizer food menu. You can't beat the price!! Beth asked how would we like the room sit up. I told her that majority of the people will be standing around socializing but I wanted the options for guests to sit! We had 3 high tables and 2 low tables for people to sit. Worked out perfect!!\n\nWe arrived a little early. So we made our way to the bar, which was large! When the married couple arrived, they felt special that their name was on the board when they came in. When you walk into Maggiano's it is very elegant. \n\nThe 2 severs for our party, I forgot their names but they were excellent!!! The drinks were flowing and the food was coming out!! Our guests are drinkers and probably were very needy... I never felt the servers were annoyed! They were in a good mood and accommodated us!! They were very nice too!!\n\nThe food was amazing, no one complained!! THANK YOU CHEFS!!\n\nMaggiano's allowed us to have a dock station to play our own music! \n\nSince no one was in the other private room we were able to go on the balcony to make toast and and take pictures! The balcony is awesome! I actually wish the party was out there!\n\nThe manager stopped by at the end of the night to see how everything went! We couldn't have thanked him more for an unforgettable wedding reception! Our friends and family are still talking about how they enjoyed the wedding reception!\n\nI especially recommend Maggiano's in Vegas for a wedding reception! I can't wait to come back and get dinner here! !"

I am not willing though to rate to a higher level as this dinner on many levels fell flat. I should have known, but kept my hopes up none the less. My husband and I were invited to a date night dinner here, so we went along for the ride.\n\nFirst off, service was a tad better this time around. Our waiter was a bit of an odd-ball though. I have to give him props for getting me a cocktail in just in time for the Happy Hour price. He was also incredibly knowledgeable about the restaurant's extensive menu. Happily telling us all kinds of things, including his opinion of the Marsala sauce that is very unlike his Italian grandmothers.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nCalamari Fritte, served with marinara. It was fried Calamari. Luckily though it was not soggy or gross. It was fried up nicely and with a spritz of lemon and a bit of the sauce was a decent app. \n\nSpinach & Artichoke Al Forno - I am a fan of artichokes in apps. My favorite though it basically just grilling the artichoke and serving it to me as is. However, I was not impressed with this dip. It is baked in an Asiago and Alfedo-like cheese sauce and it just did not have any zing to make it any better than any other spinach dip I have had.\n\nCrab & Shrimp Cannelloni ($18.50) - Ugh! What a waste of money. This dish came out in a POOL of cheese sauce. Literally, the entire plate was cheese sauce. The menu description says this, \"Asiago cheese sauce and breadcrumbs\". No. There were no breadcrumbs. My plate was a goopy pile of cheese sauce, with three lone Cannellonis that had, perhaps, 4-5 pieces of shrimp. The peppers included did not enhance the meal one bit. The cannelloni was soggy and unappetizing and the crab meat inside was like a wet mop, just smooshy and gross. I was incredibly disappointed in this dish.\n\nI wish I had gotten the Spaghetti and Meat Sauce, which is what my husband got, and he cleaned his plate!\n\nCreme Brulee ($7.95) - A huge portion of creme brulee served in a trough. Okay, I'm just kidding it wasn't served in a trough, but it might as well have been. The dessert portions are large, so ya know, share. My husband had one spoonful of the creme brulee and I was left to eat the rest of it.\n\nAgain, as an overall opinion - it's over-priced, over-salted, overly-hyped Italian food on The Strip. It's a chain Italian restaurant I will continue to avoid."

It used to be my favorite spot for HH on the strip. It has an inviting bar area with a classy bar counter and several bar tables around, with a good selection of drinks and excellent service. But my wife and I just had an unsatifying HH experience there recently.\n\n- One early Fri evening inmid-August, mywife and I came here for happy hour again and were disappointed that:\n(1) They NOT ONLY took away our favorite \"Fried Zucchinis\" from the Happy Hour Food Menu,\n(2) BUT ALSO, the entire bar menu now contained a grand total of ONLY ONE ITEM, i.e., Flatbread! Luckily the flatbread was delicious.\n- Well, my wife and I used to bring our out-of-town guests here for happy hour and dinner. The place was almost always very crowded with happy customers in the PAST, especially during its happy hour. But, on this Fri evening (around 5:30pm),the bar area was PRACTICALLY EMPTY, with only 2 tables occupied and only ONE customer at the bar counter! We thought it could have a lot to do with the now VERY LIMITED HAPPY HOUR MENU, our nice and efficient waitress agreed.\n- Well, one more good point: We were nevertheless pleased that they still give out their best tasting warm bread FREE, which tasted heavenly especially dipped in olive oil/basamic vinegar!\n\nBOTTOM LINE for HH:\n- Due to the diminished value and the \"Empty-Space-Atmosphere\" (on a Fri evening at that!), I'd now give it only 3 Stars for HH.\n\nOn the other hand, to be fair, just back in March, we brought friends over there for dinner (NOT HH), we did have a fabulous time, with tasty dishes, drinks and superb service! So, we wish that Maggiano Management would do something to bring back their popular HH menu and fill its place again for HH!\n- Hints: Please put back \"Fried Zucchinis\", and perhaps even add \"Crab Cakes\" to its Bar Menu, which is a GREAT HIT on Schottsdale Maggiano's HH Menu anyway!\n- Until then, I could still go there for a good dinner, but will not likely go back there just for happy hour.\n\nPeterskis, August 2012"

I really hate when servers decide whether to give good service to tables on whether they think the customers will leave a good tip. Our water glasses sat empty for over a half hour while our waiter filled other tables' glasses and avoided eye contact with us. He delivered our salads and then extremely awkwardly reached over us to get the remaining place settings. I understand that might be a corporate policy but why would you set food down, ask if you can get anything else (usually a good indicator it is okay to start eating) and then reach over your guests? Wrong order of things, weird waiter. That was the last time he visited our table before we were finished, leaving our salad bowls for our enjoyment. I also had a discount that said nothing about not being valid on weekends but they would not honor it. The other staff was not super friendly either, so I did not feel that complaining would elicit a response.\n\nThis was a one star experience overall but the food is truly amazing here that I have to give them two. They also had the large lunch menu displayed outside the restaurant when they were not serving their lunch menu on weekends. What a weird day at Maggiano's."

The restaurant itself sounded familiar but I knew I had never dined there before.  \n\nOur server Daniel was very attentive and personable, it was my first visit to Las Vegas so he pointed out many things that we could do in our spare time.  This restaurant had a great view.  You could see Las Vegas Blvd, people shopping, or other diners just like me.  Everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their experience at Maggiano's and we were definitely enjoying ourselves!\n\nWe started our dining experience with the Bruschetta.  It was definitely some of the best bruschetta I have ever had.  I make a pretty killer bruschetta and I was extremely impressed with shredded chunks of parmesan covering the top of the bruschetta.  Splendido!!  The bruschetta was served on Italian Garlic Bread that was topped with a tomato bruschetta relish made of tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, and roasted garlic.\n\nWe also ordered: the Chopped Salad, the Tuscan Sausage & Orzo Soup, and the Fettuccine Alfredo.  The Chopped Salad was very good.  I ordered it without green onions.  The salad ingredients were iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, blue cheese, avocado, and prosciutto tossed in a house dressing.  Most of the items on the menu, they give you the option to order half or the full portion.  Believe me when I say half is plenty when you want to eat more than just one thing.  I ordered the whole chopped salad and it was really big.  The Tuscan Sausage & Orzo Soup contained italian sausage, fennel, white beans and tomatoes.  It was really tasty.  The Fettuccine Alfredo was delicious!  It was prepared with broccoli and garlic in a creamy alfredo sauce.  We only ordered the half portion of that as well and it was really large.\n\nOverall my experience at Maggiano's was great from start to finish.  Our waters were never left empty, and our server was always around if we needed anything.  It seemed like all the servers we saw there were on top of their game waiting tables because you never saw a table that needed anything that they couldn't ask the server for.\n\nIf you around the Fashion Show Mall and you spot Maggiano's on the 2nd floor, you should definitely wander up there and grab a bite to eat because I assure you it will be worth it.  I will definitely wander back into a Maggiano's even if its not in Las Vegas.\n\nCheers and Enjoy!"

I actually changed my reservation twice because my parents' plans kept changing. First I scheduled it at 7pm, then I changed it to 6pm, then finally to 6:45. I got a confirmation email for each change, so it was fine. In my reservation I specifically stated: We would greatly prefer a view seating as we are here to celebrate my mother's 63rd birthday. Did that happen? NOPE.\n\nWhen we arrived at 6:45, I went up to the heavy set host/supervisor who didn't even care to greet me and told him I had a reservation that I made on Open Table for 6:45. He clicked around on his computer and said he didn't see and record of it. I proceeded to login to my Open Table account and pull up the whole reservation on my Ipod. I maximized the time, name, and party party size and showed it to him. He scrolled around on the page as if he were trying to find something that'd prove me wrong, but there was nothing. My reservation was right there on my phone. He told me \"well, you should really call to verify your reservations\" and I said, \"Oh, does this happen a lot here?\" he said, \"No, that's never happened. This is the first time I've ever seen that happen.\" As if I made everything up! I tried to explain that I changed my reservation a couple times and that might be why, and he said \"no, that wouldn't be the reason.\" So wtf is the reason then? Not that I care, but he just stood there making it seem as if I forged a reservation on my phone or something. Ridiculous. After a couple minutes of just telling me he doesn't see the reservation and ignoring the fact that it was on my phone he said he'll try and find us a table, as if it was such a huge favor. They took us to the back, as far away from the windows possible and sat us in some table right behind a pillar, so the only view we could've gotten was then blocked. \n\nI was very upset. The whole reason why I chose this place for my mom's birthday is because they wanted a decently priced restaurant with a view. Instead, we got a shitty table in the back of the room behind a pillar that we paid a total of $114 for. I could've gotten a better ambiance at Olive Garden with employees 5x more polite and a bill half as high. At least the food was good...too bad my appetite was spoiled before we even sat down. \n\nTo make matters even worse. I went home and checked my email, only to find that Maggiano's marked me as a NO SHOW on Open Table. How the F*ck did they mark me as a no show if my reservation was supposedly NOT THERE?! 100 points out the window. I had to contact customer service to explain that I was there and take a picture of my receipt for proof, so I wouldn't have the no show on my record. Their response, \"Based on our diagnostics, your reservation was in the restaurant's electronic reservation book, but for some reason this was not conveyed to you. Thank you for making us aware of this discrepancy!\" Hmm, I wonder why that happened?\n\nVery upset with Maggiano's and that heavy set host/supervisor man, so much that I don't plan on coming back here anymore. I'll Splurge on Capital Grille instead if I want that same view."

So we get a good size group, pay the $35 a person, then eat until we get our money's worth, and can hardly get out of our chairs.\n\nWith family style the order includes a salad, 2 appetizers, 4 entree's, and 2 desserts. \n\n**HERE ARE THE MUST GETS**\nSalad- Caesar Salad.\nApps- Calamari, Fried Mozzarella.\nTrey trey's- Chicky Chicky parm parm, mushroom ravioli's, fettuccini Alfredo.\nZerts- New York Cheesecake, Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nIn the past, my experience with the waiters and waitresses has been nice with them continuing to bring out food when asked for more with it being all you can eat Family Style and all. \nI had friends in town for Thanksgiving break who had never been to Las Vegas so I called and made a reservation for us. There was 6 of us at the table and our waitress Vanessa was really stingy and cheap with the amount of food she brought out for us. She took forever to bring out the food when we asked for more and would try and talk us out of being hungry.\n\nI love Maggiano's, but next time I go I will make sure Vanessa is not my waitress."

After about 45 min, we went up to the counter and asked how much longer our table would be.  The hostess checked their list and looked a little flustered... as if our name magically disappeared.  She immediately seated us.  Our server was pretty good at first.  I got the \"famous\" rigatoni D, while my bf got the beef cannelloni.  Both our dishes were very very salty.  For the beef cannelloni, they were very generous with the beef, very sparse on the pasta, and the carrots were undercooked and very crunchy.  My rigatoni was a very big portion, but so salty I ended up drinking all my water for half the dish.  \n\nThis brings me to my second qualm...  once we got our dishes, our server went MIA.  It seemed like everyone around us with bigger parties had very good service, while we waited and waited for him to even acknowledge us.  We had to ask for water and even then it took 5 min to get it.  \n\nOverall, I'd say the restaurant was overpriced (we ended up spending $45 on just those two entrees) and overhyped.  Would I eat here again?  Maybe if someone were treating... and only if I have a full glass of water!"

When they opened one in Las Vegas I was happy to go there as well and have frequented it many times since then. \n\nMaggiano's is one of those rare restaurants that overfeeds you meaning they serve huge servings which is very hard to usually finish unless you're super hungry. \n\nOn our most recent visit we got Spaghetti and Meatballs, Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Piccata, sauteed spinach, and mashed potatoes. As usual my family had a hard time devouring all the food. My niece was overwhelmed by the huge serving of shrip scampi as was my son with the spaghetti. I was just able to finish off my dish of chicken piccata. \n\nNeedless to say that we are fans of Maggiano's and it is always on our list of restaurants to visit when in Vegas."

My usual entrees here are the Lasagna, the Rigatoni D, and the Calamari;] Yum Some of their entrees are good but I've realized that most the white based sauces could taste a little bland along with other pastas, but maybe it just comes down to preference.\n\nAlso while you're there take advantage of their delicious bread, we had like 3 rounds when we were there and they provide this dip that has olive oil and balsamic vinegar? not sure.

Once we were seated our server was super knowledgeable of the menu, which was great. Also he tailored the service to our party which had 3 kids, this was also great.\n\nHowever there were certainly some service failures... we sipped on water for ~25 minutes (yes I timed it) before our actual drinks came in and he would literally ramble off every single ingredient in the specialty menu before letting us order, it was like he was reading a disclaimer off of one of those TV commercials.\n\nI finally ended up ordering the Chicken Marsala and the Fettuccine Alfredo. The sauce on the chicken marsala  was creamy but watery and the mushrooms were soggy and looked like they had been left in the salamander for too long. \n\nThe Fettuccini was also a little tough and the Alfredo sauce had texture like mayo, not as creamy/runny as it should have been.

If you're looking to impress a date this is a great spot. However if you're just looking for some great Italian food with your family or a large party this is not a good spot for the money.\n\nTip: Menu is small and it is periodically updated, something to keep in mind just in case you had a favorite."

Lets talk about some of my favorite things to order.\n\nRight from the start the warm bread basket is fantastic please enjoy the top notch virgin olive oil and the best balsamic vinegar i have ever had! \nSome of my favorite appetizer are bruschetta, a simple but very tasty plate, the chopped salad or any of their salads are great and large enough to share and though i personally am not a fan of calamari my grandma and fathers side of the family who are 100% Sicilian i may add rave about it and order it every time we go! \nAs for main course you can't go wrong with any of their pasta dishes which i can almost guarantee you will have some left over to take home! My favorite, though it is another simple classic dish, is the spaghetti and meatballs i absolutely love it! The chicken parm is fantastic as well! In all honesty their are more great dishes here than i can name in this review!\nNow for desert, if you were able to save room go for it or you can be like me and get a piece of tripple layer chocolate cake to go, it is extremely rich and very well made the cheesecake is very good as well! \n\nI strongly reccomend this restaurant and as i said in the beggining it is one of the better places to take a date especially if you want to impress, once again please make reservations for less wait time but if there is a little wait they have a great little bar area you can grab a few cocktails relax and socialize! Also as i said dont limit this place to only dates its great for the whole family with large portions attentive wait staff and a lot of class ! 5 stars and truley a gem! \nEnjoy :)"

Despite this minor inconvenience, we were welcomed by the bartender and directed to a 4-top table.\n\nWaters and cocktails were ordered to battle the slight hangover from previous eve's shenanigans.\n\nThe menu is varied but not overdone offering traditional Italian meals. The 4 of us places our orders. I went for the chicken parm sandwich. All our food arrived at once, hot and fresh.\n\nMy sandwich was good - nicely seasoned! My dining companions commented similarly regarding their meals.\n\nMaggianos opens on to the mall for post-meal shopping and to walk off a good meal!"

            "review": "Second time to this Maggiano's... The first time we sat on the patio and I swear a cockroach bit my leg. SOOOOOO GROSS. I don't think that's the restaurant's fault... The interior appears very clean. Came here for dinner the other night to meet up with a friend at 7pm but hadn't called to make a reservation. My boy and I got there a little early so we put our name down (wait was 30 mins, nbd) and took a seat at the bar. The bartender took a minute to get to us but was friendly and made an AWESOME drink for me. Moscato Mojito. Definitely try it!!\n\nWithin 10 minutes, our buzzer went off for our table. I brought it over with my still nearly full drank-drank but had to wait like 10 more minutes at the stand to be seated. I get that it was much faster than the 30 minute prediction... But don't tell me my table is ready then make me wait again while with a drink in hand. Whatev. \n\nWe were seated, our server said he'd be right with us. Our server came back and took our drink order. We ordered 3 of those moscato mojitos (one extra for our late friend lol). I'm telling you! Try it!!! Our friend showed up shortly after and we got our drank-dranks. Server asked if we'd decided on our meals yet... Our friend just sat down.... Give us like 2 more minutes? Ok cool! He came back like 15 minutes later. With bread and oil. We ordered and asked for vinegar to go with the oil. He never brought it....\n\nMeanwhile the table next to us had sat down 5 minutes after us and was being served their food. Again, I get that we were taking our time and our friend was late, WHATEV. But their server was ON IT. I was able to get his attention and asked for vinegar. It took him 12 seconds. I was so jealous of the table next to us. \n\nFood finally came like 30 minutes later and I was a little disappointed with the size of the salad that my boy and I agreed to share because it was \"enough for two\"... Maybe enough for two kids. My ravioli and side of broccolini were really good tho. Our server came back 10 minutes later to ask if we needed anything. I was gonna get a dessert but after waiting forever for our meal and having never gotten vinegar from him, I decided to pass fearing it would take too long. Just the check thanks! Ugh. That was another 10 minute ordeal. I don't recall him thanking us or looking forward to our next visit but that may have been said...\n\nOverall, 3 stars only cuz our service was slow and spotty. Memorable I suppose but not for the right reasons. Food was good. Nothing to write home about but satisfying. Dranks were BOMB. I'll go back just for that Moscato Mojito! Better luck next time though, Maggiano's."

I never miss a chance to dine there every time I am in Vegas.\nOur last dinner there was for New Year's eve 2009. \nI had never ordered family style....be ready for pregnancy pants :-)\nThey serve an incredible amount of food...great food. The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.\n\nOrdering family is style is great when you're a large party (4 or more). The choice is limitless. \nFor fewer people, I would recommend a la carte.\nMy very favorite dish is the braised beef cannelloni....The beef and sauce are divine (it's better ordered a la carte than family style as it comes piping hot from the oven rather than on a large plate for everyone to share)\nTheir spinach salad and Maggiano steak salad are both great.\nDon't miss the lasagna too and the Apple crostada (so buttery).\n\nMaggiano, please open another location in the Bay Area closer to SF or in the East Bay. San Jose is too far!! What about Walnut Creek??"

Came with three well-sized pieces of chicken with mushrooms over the marsala sauce.   However, what surprised me was how freaking good the noodles on the side were.  I don't know what made them so addicting and delicious but they were.   Our server stated it was just simply seasoned with olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.   It tasted really good and I wish I asked for more.\n\nHaving kids also has its perks.  From the kid's menu, we ordered the lasagna.   The portion was enough to feed a family.   Lots of meat.  Very filling and we liked it alot.\n\nDidn't care much for the soup I added to our meal.  Tuscan-something, I forget the name right now.  But it had beans in it.   Won't order it next time.\n\nI think you have to ask for the complimentary bread though before they bring it out.  My server didn't mention it until I mentioned bread.  Maybe it's so you can possibly order other appetizers.  Great for lunch or dinner whenever you're around Fashion Show Mall."

Feeling of perpetual movement and panic. Our server was more than adequate but I'll bet he was the best. Food is really nothing. Everything is drowned in a sauce of some kind. Cheese on the table in a jar, so I ask for fresh cheese and get some more shredded cheese in a glass. Class is not available in this place unless it is none.  Saltimbocca is on the menu as Chicken. So, I call ahead to get a veal Saltimbocca. They have no idea what a Saltimbocca is. Sounds more like a Veal Marsala.that they serve.. I ordered a baked Ziti, figured what could they do to pasta. Well, the Ziti was not baked. Just regular Ziti drowned in something. Edible but not what I go out for. I do wish restaurants and others would stop putting names on menus that have no relationship to what they serve. I also wish the public had more respect for itself and did not rave about bad restaurants like this one. Well, at least it's terribly overpriced so I knew I was in Vegas."

A lemon chicken with capers, I think. There was also like a lasagna or something. I don't know but everything was good and just really above average. The girl sitting next to me hated seafood and wouldn't try a few things so she kept complaining but seriously grow up and eat some damn fish! This place is great.

The joint was hopping.  I found a vacant seat at the bar and grabbed their wine list.  I usually start with a white, but my mood was askew due to the onset of cool weather and early sunset.  After a brief study, I requested a glass of Meiomi Pinot Noir.  Score!!  Now, what to do with my hands while I sit here, but of course, an appetizer!  All of my friends can attest that I've been on a calamari quest of late.  Not surprising, I opt for the calamari.\n\nWhile I'm kicking back sipping my savory cherry berry juice, the fellow next to me, a tourist from Connecticut, strikes up a lively conversation.  I discover he works for the Travel Channel, has an exact opposite wine palate from me, and we were both at the same event last Saturday (the Lee's 9th annual Wine Experience).\n\nPerfecto!  Little golden rings cooked to lightly crunchy perfection arrive.  Pair them with Maggiano's famous marinara that suggests nuances of garlic, onion, and basil and I'm one happy camper who forgot she was waiting on anything.  The Lens Crafters notification call comes and goes, but I'm not ready to leave just yet, so I order up another glass of wine.  This time I order up a Cline Ancient Vines Zin, which isn't bad at all."

Waiters was great.  Very little wait time.  If you never been there before and don't know where to park it can be tricky or you will be walking for a while before you get there.\nHubby and I had a great romantic time.  Been going there since 2003, every visit to vegas we always make sure we stop here.\nThis is great mouth watering italian food.  My fav dish is the Rigatoni 'D' &\nWe love the calamari!!"

With seating inside, bar, outside, patio and even when the mall is open next door they have some tables set up there. So seating shouldn't be a problem. \nOur waiter was James. What a very helpful and a polite waiter! Always came by to see how we were and asked if we needed anything. TRUELY GREAT!  \nWe ordered 2 side orders of Caesar Salad, Fried Zucchini, Prime New York Steak with Potaoes and pasta dish. We first brought bread to table. Very good. Then were brought our salads. Very good. Then the Zucchini. OH MY! AMAZING! So crisp and loved the seasoning! And lastly our main dishes. The steak is a on the pricer side of things but WORTH it! It was so good my girlfriend took so much away for me! \nOverall it was very good and I was VERY pleased with our visit. I will be back when I'm back in town!\n\nSide note. Only thing I will ding about this place is that a photographer comes to your table and takes a picture of you and your guest and then comes back to show you the pictures so that you can buy it if you want to. BUT the one we got was pretty rude with us. Seemed visibly upset when we didn't want to purchase any of the pictures. Gave us some looks but we didn't let that affect our evening."

It's great because you have a perfect view of the lights and hustle of the Las Vegas Strip. I ordered to go but had a glass of wine while I waited for my food to finish. The servers seemed really nice for the most part, although I didn't get the full service since I was ordering to go. \n\nI ordered the shrimp fra diavolo (lighter version) with a side casear salad. The food was packed very nicely and thoroughly saran wrapped to keep from spilling. The salad was OK. Nothing too extravagant. The pasta was a nice portion, perfect to get full off of and then have leftovers for another meal. Also, they were very generous with the shrimp. Sadly, some of the shrimp tasted a little undercooked. I wasn't sure but the next morning when I was sick it was confirmed! Definitely may think twice before ordering seafood here!"

A full order is for people who want to share. \n\nI ordered a special, Chianti Beef, it was a little salty for my taste but my brother said it was great. I tasted some of his Garlic Shrimp Linguine, which was good but the noodles lacked flavor. I also tasted some of my mom's Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta which was the best in my opinion. It was full of flavor, but not too much. My family did critcize that the noodles were a little overcooked though, but I found it perfect. i guess it depends on your preference and how you like your noodles. Now i saved the best for last, I would honestly go to Maggiano's just for their garlic mashed potatoes. \n\nI have ever only really tasted two chef's mashed potatoes that i liked previous to this dish, but this is definitely in my top 2. It's hard to describe, but you just have to taste it. It's the perfect blend of ingredients, not too salty, good consistency, just try it! I'd seriously go all the way to San Jose from SF just to eat the mashed potatoes. \n\nFood took a little long to be prepared. Service was pretty good. Our waters got refilled, but nothing extremely special or eyecatching."

This past year, we decided to dine at Maggiano's afters having a good experience in CALI.

You can choose between 3 different price groups, all that come with different options, which are all reasonable and well worth the money. \n\nI'm absolutely gaga (No lady, stay out of this one) over their Chicken Francese and their mash potatoes. To DIE! Their Chicken Francese is not traditional, however. It is breaded and then smothered in lemon sauce.

Anyway, we needed to find a place with food that was better than McDonald's for the adults and would appeal to our kids and not bankrupt us.\n\nI had the nifty Yelp app on my new, handy dandy Crackberry and it pointed us to Maggiano's.  The app provided many positive Yelp reviews ( of dubious value as usual), a web address and phone number enabling me to call and make a reservation and a map feature that helped us find the place with ease.\n\nWe were seated promptly upon arrival and the waiter was very kind to my wife and I in spite of the antics of my three little darlings.  It can be a royal pain to take care of families at a nice restaurant with tablecloths and wine glasses but the service was very good.\n\nThe have a full kids menu from which our children were able to choose something they liked.  My wife had some chicken pesto pasta dish which was tasty and I ordered chicken francesca, which was supposedly inspired by the Italian cuisine from St, Louis.  Having become intimately familiar with St. Louis Italian cuisine over the years I think that was a reach but nonetheless my dinner was very good-especially for a chain.  The price was very reasonable and I would love to dine here again but I'm not planning to go to Vegas again in the near future and unfortunately the closest franchise is in Orange County.  Perhaps they'll open a San Diego location some day."

I was back at Maggiano's for a private event and this time it was much better. Yes, they serve the dishes family style. Yes, you pay a slightly inflated price I attribute to the unofficial Strip surcharge. You get past all that and you'll find some good food here. \n\nOn this occasion there was one item that had me going back for more: Crispy Zucchini Fritte. The zucchini is a diet killer. Calorie counting? Yeah, forget about that. Just make sure you get yours before the rest of the table does. \n\nThe rest of the items I tried today were good, but there was nothing that warranted asking for a box to take it with me. The Fettuccine Alfredo was respectable, not the best I've ever had but it certainly was filling and I sneaked in a second small helping of it. The Chicken Piccata was actually disappointing. I masked my disappointment by having more Caesar salad and where did that Zucchini go again? \n\nOne note to the staff...the Lemon Cookies were too cold. But the Apple Crostada made me forget all about the cookies...\n\nAs this was a business function, the Maggiano's staff took great care of my needs and of everyone that I work with. All things considered 4 Stars seems appropriate. \n\nAlmost forgot to mention one more thing. The Valet seems super slow here. If you're in a hurry to get somewhere else plan accordingly."

The young low quality waitstaff, the generic menu and the robotic operationally efficient way the place was run all made me think that.\n\nThe couple in front of us requested and was granted a booth.  We then ask for a booth and are told there are no booths available.  We look around and there are tons of booths available both on the outskirts of the floor layout and right in the middle.  We ask if those were reserved and the host says no, there is only one table open and no booths open and he says that is due to lack of waitstaff.  Wtf.  Within minutes of us sitting at a table the next couple is sat at a booth...WTF?!?  This pisses off my buddy who says something negative and storms off to talk to the manager.  A random waitress hears this and ask if there is a problem.  I tell her the issue and her reply is essentially \"We have lots of booths available for you to sit\". Long story short the manager moves us to the booth we figured they would seat us at in the first place.\n\nOur waiter at the first table was terrible.  I'd expect him at an Applebees in some Podunk town of 15,000 people..not a supposed nice restaurant on the strip.  His unkept hair and facial hair that more closely resembled pubic hair made him look like he was homeless.  He talked like a \"surfer duuuude.\"  This isn't Taco Bell buddy.  He also didn't seem to know what he was doing.  He would just ask if we know what we want and then would disappear for a long time.  He brought my water without the lemons I requested.  When he asked if we needed anything else I said lemons and he's like \"Sure dude\"seemingly oblivious to the fact that he had previously told us he would bring some.\n\nOur waiter at our 2nd table was much more experienced.  He gave us spiels about the menu items.  He was also far more attentive.  One funny thing I heard him say quite loudly to the other waiter that most would have taken offense to was that the first waiter \"won the lottery\" which was an obvious reference to us not spending much money.  It should be noted that we ordered drinks/desert later which he didn't realize when he made the comment.\n\nTo me the menu was boring and bland.  It should be noted I don't eat seafood.  There was nothing that jumped out at me and told me it wanted me to eat it so I just made the oh so generic order of Spaghetti and Meatballs with meat sauce.  It was tasty.  Don't expect anything special from it.  Free bread before the meal always gets my approval and it was good.  I also ordered the Tiramisu which was awesome.  Definitely recommend that.\n\nMy buddy was told each waiter only has 4 tables which I can't fathom especially with as poor service as the original waiter delivered.  I assumed they were having service issues because youtube personality \"The Trooper\" recently quit working there.  The host was clueless and didn't even know who The Trooper was.  Whattttuuuup Trooper, it's the yelp reviewer letting you know that Maggianos has already gone downhill since you left."

I come here about at least twice a month and I've always enjoyed the atmosphere and their delicious food. Make sure you try their Caesar's salad because they honestly have the BEST Caesar's salad. Everything else I've had on their menu has been phenomenal. \n\nAt Maggiano's you're able to substitute or subtract/add items you don't like. They also serve bread so an appetizer isn't needed unless you want to order them. \n\nOn weekends, it's probably best if you make a reservation just in case cause they can make you wait 25-35 mins for just 2 people, but they do accept walk-ins as well if you're up for the wait or just in the area. \n\nAverage bill for 2 ppl with 2 orders of side Caesar's salad and 2 beverages, excluding alcohol...is roughly $40. That price for good food, fancy looking restaurant and is on the strip is hard to find!"

It was packed as we went on a Friday night, but after the experience, you can see why it was so busy. Great food, great drink menu, and the best service I've ever received. Our waiter, M. (I'm not sure if it's polite to mention names even if he was awesome) is probably the best waiter in Las Vegas: polite, charming, and honest. So many times waiters are told to say \"everything is the best\". When asked about dishes and wines that were not his favorite he would say that they were fine but he would really recommend Dish X or Wine Y. It helped a lot that his recommendations were spot on and he wasn't just trying to pad the final bill; a lot of his recommendations were cheaper than what we had first asked about\n\nAs mentioned, even though this place had a packed house none of the waiters or waitresses seemed rushed or hurried. The food was cooked perfectly, the view was amazing, and the experience was perfect. The GF puts this in her 'Top Three Favorite Restaurants' category. To directly quote her, \"I love it!\".  \n\nI can't believe that this place is a chain. The set up is so nice; dark hardwood, dim lights, beautiful glassware.. It seems so against the whole 'Here's what corporate sent in a box, let's go throw this crap on the wall'. \n\nEasily a new favorite. If you happen to get a male waiter whose name starts with the letter 'M', be prepared. You might just get the best waiter in Vegas."

The garlic shrimp pasta turned out to be delicious, especially the savory shrimps! Also, the lobster dishes (ravioli and carbonara) which my friend and boyfriend ordered were cooked perfectly.\n\nIn terms of Italian food, I give Maggiano's a 5!

Our waiter, Billy, was very friendly and made us feel like valued guests--almost as if he had invited us into his home. I wanted a glass of wine to start but I didn't know what to order from the large selection of wines on the menu. Billy was able to make an excellent recommendation by asking me a few questions about what I like. I wish I could remember what it was :(\n\nI ordered the Taylor Street Baked Ziti which comes loaded with Italian Sausage, Pomodoro Sauce, and an Italian cheese blend. Just thinking about it again makes me want to Fed Ex an order of it to Edmonton right now. But Canadian Customs would probably eat it all at the airport.\n\nThe selection of entrees at Maggiano's is large and it was difficult making a choice of which to order. The Baked Eggplant Parmesan, Chef Mann's Country-Style Pasta, Chicken Parmesan, etc. are all on my radar for future visits to this restaurant. In addition to pasta there is a decent sized seafood menu.\n\nThe portions are large and the prices are right. It's $15 - 20 on average for the pasta dishes with the seafood being around $21 - 30 (unless it's lobster tails then you're paying more).\n\nMaggiano's is clearly about creating a delicious, comfortable experience that makes customers want to return. That is such a rarity in today's corporate culture which simply treats consumers like a number. I can't wait to return to this restaurant."

I could hardly place a drink order with the server because I was so fixated on this overlooked problem. Only compounding the unease, we were placed on the edge of the aisle, the front legs of my chair were on a carpeted area and the back in the aisle ... so I always felt like I was about to fall off my chair. (And this was before the wine!) \n\nOur server was curt and lacked warmth. I think this may have been the result of me being sucked into the tractor beam of the dirty wine glass when I was ordering. We had to ask twice for butter (over EVOO). However, we were truly glad this restaurant was open so late! (Most every sit-down establishment was was closed except Buca and Maggiano's). \n\nWhile it is chain food and has that \"chain\" quality (frozen), it is still filling and occasionally tasty. If you are a vegetarian, be careful! Many of the appetizers (like the stuffed mushrooms) and entrees use chicken-stock for flavor (which is not posted on the menu). We discovered this \"the hard way.\" Ask your server for guidance.\n\nMaggiano's receives high-marks from us for being open late in this city that seems to close-down everything but the casinos after 10:30. Nonetheless, the walk to the deserted Fashion Mall (at this hour) is truly harrowing (we saw NO security in this area whatsoever) so go in a large, alert group. Seriously."

Yelp and other online reviews were great so we thought we will give it a try. As soon as we went inside, they said the wait time is 15' which wasn't too bad. My sis-in-law had a baby so she had a stroller with her and baby was asleep at that time. After 15' we went inside and they said the stroller is not allowed. My sis-in-law explained that the baby is asleep and it would be nice of them to accommodate the stroller. The waiter told to some lady and she allowed to have the stroller inside. The stroller was kept near the pillar so that it is not in anyone's way. We had 2-3 different servers for this visit. One took the order for water. The round table had 5 chairs but only 3 appetizer plates on them! We were total 4. Had to tell the waiter to get us 1 more plate. Then we had ordered 2 soups (tomato-basil) and since they did not split in half, we had asked for separate bowls. They brought the soup but not bowls! Although we told them to get the bowls, after drinking half the soup from the bowl, still we did not get the empty bowls. Then we told another server to get the bowls. By the time we got empty bowls, soup was done! we had shared from the same bowl.However, apart from their service, the Soup tasted Excellent! For the appetizer, we had ordered Fried Mozzarella with Marinara Sauce on top. The Mozzarella was Terrific and too heavy. We got 4 pieces and just 1 piece filled our stomach! I will surely recommend Tomato-basil soup and Fried Mozzarella! \nFor entree, we had Angel Primavera with vegetables and 4 Cheese Ravioli. Since we are vegetarians, We had Angel Primavera with vegetables. Although, the taste was blend, except for me, rest 3 of them liked it. To me it was okay. I would have loved it with extra sauce, seasonings and olive oil. It looked bit dry. The 4 Cheese Ravioli was Excellent. Very creamy light green color sauce and light marinara on top of ravioli and soft cheese inside the ravioli and nicely baked cheese on top. Again the Ravioli filled us up with all the cheese..! Lastly we thought (not me as my stomach was Full) to try their 5 Pc Dessert since it looked nice when they brought out for others! well, truly nobody liked any of the dessert except 1 person liked 1 of the dessert. I personally will not recommend the 5 pc dessert. 1 was Tirmasu cake-was ok.\n1 was cheese cake-no no, 1 was Apple Crostada-no no, 1 Butter Cake -no-ok, creme brulee-ok-good. \nFood Taste Overall -4 *\nFood Taste for Appetizer and Entrees - 5*\nService- 4*\nDessert Taste- 1*\nDecor and feel - 5*\nCost- Fried Mozzarella (4 piece)-$11.95\n         2 Bowl Tomato Soup ($5.95 each)-$11.90\n        Angel Primavera -$13.95\n        4 Cheese Ravioli- $15.95\n        5 Pc Dessert - $12.95\nTotal - $66.70\nTax: $5.44\nTotal - $72.14 for 4 people.\nI will surely recommend this restaurant on the strip!!!

Were quick to get our drink order and it quicker with our food, the calamari for appetizer was glorious. I had the lobster carbonara and I absolutely loved it, keep in mind there actually big portions so I wasn't able to finish it. Got a to go box for sure, you don't let good things like that go to waste. My friend got the ravioli,  he was pleased with but seemed like a smaller portion it had like six or seven or so raviolis seem to fill him up though. Bread they brought out with the balsamic  was amazing I now want to go to the store and do that for myself. I very much enjoyed this last night and intend on going back, today I went to Hooters for lunch and even though I'm stuffed from it I have the lobster carbonara in my fridge I refuse to go bad so that's what I'm eating now, i'm a fat ass."

I've never independently chosen to eat here.\n\nI will say they have their sh$t together when it comes to large private gatherings.  They're always well staffed and organized, unlike other spots in town (*cough* PJ Clarkes *cough*).  The private rooms are also spacious and feature large windows -- you're not in some afterthought back room.\n\nFurther, the portions they provide for groups are enormous.  Even if there are 10 people at a table, it never runs out.  In fact, I usually get stuck with taking home leftovers.  Just what I always wanted, 4 lbs of artichoke dip......\n\nBUT, large portions aren't really a godsend if the food is just meh.  I've had the chicken & eggplant parmesan, chicken piccata, penne with meat sauce, spagetti, caesar salad, stuffed mushrooms, calamari, profiteroles and...... none of it was memorable. \n\nOverall, they serve up very basic Italian food meant to please the masses......something easily achieved when the patrons are seven-years-old....."

It turned out to be a great decision.\n\nLocation-wise, it was very easy for our guests to get to from the Wynn. We had a couple of older relatives, and being able to drive up to the valet area and drop them off was super.\n\nPlanning - the banquet staff was responsive and accommodating. They also took care of everything - saving us the hassle of trying to manage multiple vendors. We selected the cocktail reception package. After signing the initial contract, the only other planning we had to do was answer the occasional email about headcount or food and beverage choices.\n\nFacilities- beautiful banquet room. Our decorations were minimal (some flowers on the tables), but that's all the place really needed. Maggiano's let us drop off the decorations the morning-of, and the banquet staff did a knock-out job of decorating the room for us. We rented out all 3 portions of the banquet room, which was great for our 100-person reception. We also got access to the terrace, which was great for the smokers, let us enjoy a view of the strip, and kept the temperature perfect for the event.\n\nFood & staff - amazing. Everyone loved the food. The staff was quick to respond when food ran out in the banquet lines - new food came out fresh and hot. Bar tending staff was awesome - no one waited in line very long. Also, the staff made my husband, myself, and our photographer \"to go\" boxes with extra food because they were afraid we didn't get enough to eat. How awesome is that?\n\nDo yourself a favor and let the awesome staff at Maggiano's handle your reception. Professional, painless, and the end to a perfect day."

We had 6 in our group so we took two cars to the venue. I arrived earlier than the rest of my party hoping to put our name down but the hostess wouldn't let us since the \"majority\" of our party was not present...keep in mind we were told the wait would be 40 mins and my party was only 15 mins behind me. I assumed this wasn't the hostess' rule so I shrugged it off. When my party arrived we put our name in and we're told it would be 40 mins max so we had a drink at the bar while we wait. I was supposed to get a text when the table was ready but over an hour (maybe 1hr 15m) had passed now. We check with the hostess and she couldn't find our party on the list. We give her the phone number  and she seemed to try to make it look like she found the party all of a sudden. We were then seated minutes later on their \"indoor patio\", basically tables set up inside the mall.  We were seated at a very small table (felt like a kids table) so we asked to switch tables, which the hostess hesitantly directed us to a table right next to ours. Not a great experience before we even were able to look at the menu.\n\nThe food was alright, not worth the price or service experienced. The waiter was very nice but the hostesses all seemed to have an attitude. \n\nThe only reason I would go back is the cheesecake."

We said we called to make reservations, but they told us that they didn't take them until 8:30, AND said there would be no wait. Girl at the front desk said oh, we take reservations 90 minutes or more out. Oh okay, please tell us that next time.\n\nWe were seated about 30 minutes later, outside (yay!). Our waiter appeared quickly and we ordered beverages. Sadly, none of our drinks - water, coke, or beer - were ever refilled. Nobody even noticed that my husband was out of both water and coke and that I gave him my water to tide him over. Not that we could have notified our waiter; most of the time, he was not to be found.\n\nWe ordered shrimp linguine and angel hair with tomato sauce. The half orders, contrary to what we've heard, barely fed 2 adults, and we're not gluttonous eaters. Angel hair was decent, but nothing to write home about. Skip the side salad - it was iceberg lettuce, whole grape tomatoes, and dry croutons. You can either have italian dressing or blue cheese. Apparently, those are your choices.\n\nOur server was very polite, but he was very rushed; it was hard to get him to linger at the table for a moment, and as I mentioned, he never noticed our empty glasses, nor offered any refills. We sat with a pile of empty plates at the end of the meal for a long time before he reappeared and asked if we wanted dessert."

So crammed on top of one another. It is so loud you cannot hear what the other people at your table are saying. The tables are not big enough for the amount of people they seat at them. We were 6 people squished in a table which was meant for 4.\nOur server may have been new so I will try to cut him some slack. but he did get alot of our order wrong. Our drinks were mixed up, it took forever to get our appetizers, the entrees came pretty quickly. but one was wrong. The dessert was the worst part. My sister brought in a cake for my nephews birthday, and it took nearly an hour before it arrived. By this point we asked that it be put back in the box to take home. \nThe food was not good. There are so many better options for Italian food. Real Italian food. To me this is on the same level of Olive Garden. The one shining star of the meal was the spinach and artichoke dip. it was one of the best I have ever had. \nSave your money go elsewhere, where you can have a great meal and a nice conversation. \nI for one will never go back."

When our waitress had come over to check on us, she saw the error right away as she had not delivered the food to us.

Julio was an amazing waiter that made our family style meal comfortable and celebratory!! Food was very good and more than we could eat. Linguini clam, veal marsala, calamari fritte, grilled salmon with asparagus spears, tomato bruschetta, spaghetti meatball, tiramisu, warm apple crostada, and complimentary vanilla cake & butter cake with birthday candles!! All very very good and beyond satisfying. We were seated at the best round table of the dining room surrounded by big glass windows to enjoy the flashing lights and energy of Las Vegas Blvd. But the dining experience tonight was made special because Julio was so attentive and patient with our large party - great customer service with a smile! \nSide note: they had prepared extra warm apple crostadas - yummy deliciousness - and gave to us to enjoy."

Unfortunately our experience for our anniversary was the complete opposite.  Even though we made reservations our table was on top of the guests behind us. The service was virtually nonexistent;  we had empty glasses, we waited about 30 minutes for each course,  and when  finally got our food it was not as satisfying as our original experience.  Needless to say, we will not be dining with them again."

We had a driver take us from our hotel to this restaurant so there was obviously NO parking problem. :)\n\nWe had a table reserved for about 6 of us and we were seated promptly. The place was JAMPACKED for a weeknight. But everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their meals and their service. It can definitely get pretty damn loud here.\n\nWe ordered tons of different pasta, chicken, seafood and dessert dishes. Everything served family style of course. Everything that came out tasted wonderful. I honestly didn't wanna look like a mcfatty pig in front of some of the executives I was dining with so I kept my portions on my plate pretty small. But when dessert came out...I opted to eat my full slice of cheesecake all to myself AND of course nibble on some of the other dessert plates that were still sitting there in the middle of our table.\n\nOur waiter/waitresses were all very friendly. And service was quite efficient.\n\nWould I dine at this particular Maggiano's again? Hmmm, well I have about a million bookmarked spots to try out, so I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon just due to the fact that I already know it's standard Italian food. But I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's not that adventurous with other types of food and just want to enjoy their night with a hearty dinner at a well-known chain restaurant."

This place does get crowded so a reservation is suggested.  \n\nThe food is ok...I have never had anything here that I would say was off the charts.  The prices are a little higher then you will find in other Italian places but its a chain and its on the strip. \n\nThe food is cooked good but there are a lot of items that are bland and under seasoned.  What makes up for the food is the ambiance and I am going to steal this part from my friend and fellow Yelper, Gregg W. who said this part best.  \n\n Classy, Rat Pack Music, Meticulously Clean, Upscale.\n\nMen...wear a suit/tie or dress it down nicely casual, but certainly no flip flips and gym shorts here!  \n\nThe dark wood interior walls have some nice old Las Vegas framed black n white photos. Tables are white cloth. Nicely dressed wait staff. Bathrooms even have cloth towels! Just a very classy Italian restaurant!\n\n*Full bar w/ dining option. \n**Happy Hour specials. \n***Reservations recommended for seating by floor to ceiling windows or prepare to go shopping and come back and wait some more, etc.  \n\nSo I say you should visit this place, try a few different dishes and share your opinion here on Yelp.  This is not my first choice of a place to get Italian food here in Vegas,  but if you like a chain and are familiar with the food and you like it, GO, GO, GO and enjoy...its not a BAD place by any means, just not up to my liking to say it is a favorite of mine."

It comes in really big portions so you can share or just take the rest home. \nPrices are reasonable."

The servers struggled a little because of the volume of customers but held up pretty well all things considered.

At first, we thought it would be very expensive to eat there but since it's at the fashion show mall, we thought we'd stop by and check it out. We were pleasantly surprised to see that the prices were pretty reasonable (except Steaks which cost over $40)\n\nI ordered shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta and I loved it!! it was very light in garlic butter wine sauce and unlike most restaurant, they put a generous amount of shrimp in there, which was awesome! It was a pretty decent sized plate too, but I ended up eating every bit of it! Yumm! \n\nMy friends ordered the lasagna and they both loved it too. Good portion, very meaty, cheesy and delicious. (Yes, I had to take a bite for myself!)\n\nWe ordered a bottle of chianti for $36 (I think) and it was pretty good and went well with the food.  If you're planning on having at least 2-3 glass, that would be a better option than ordering by the glass which is usually $10/glass.\n\nAbove all, our server was really nice, friendly and fun. I think her name is Lori (?)\n\nTheir freshly baked bread was soooo good, nice, fluffy and warm. I am not really a big bread eater, especially before my meal, but I ended up eating 3 pieces - dipped in the olive oil vinaigrette and grated Parmesan cheese. Yumm!  \n\nWe didn't have a reservation so we were told we have a half hour wait. We were waiting for about 15 minutes but  luckily, we found a table at the bar, first come first serve, so we ended up eating at the bar area, which was just fine by us. They serve the full menu there as well.  They have a nice outdoor seating area as well. \nI'd recommend that you call and make a reservation if you have a large group or don't want to wait to be seated.\n\nSooo, Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely going back there, to try out their seafood Linguine!"

Whoa.\n\nWe pretty much hit the jackpot with parking. The underground lot of the Fashion Show mall has several entrances, and although we entered from the south end of the mall, we found our way to the northeast corner (which was actually near an exit) and found a perfect, surprisingly non-wheelchair parking space very close to the elevator that takes you directly to the back of Maggiano's.\n\nAfter walking through to the host desk at the front, we got seated fairly quickly. It was a busy lunch hour, but not absolutely jampacked. We were seated by a window, thankfully, and we got to see some of the Wynn and Palazzo. I had a blast watching the Wynn divider move up and down the LED screen. Who needs a TV?\n\nI somewhat surprised myself for asking for coffee. I was dead tired from accumulate sleep debt this week, so it was worth every penny of the $2.95. Our server was funny though. He took care to turn the saucer such that the spoon and coffee mug handle were angled to my left, even though it's kinda assumed that most people (including yours truly) are right-handed.\n\nI have a lot of love for the Baked Eggplant Parmesan. So does my mom. She ordered it (and saved the leftovers for a special someone) along with the stuffed mushroom appetizers. My aunt went with the Linguini and Clams with white clam sauce, and I had the Veal Parmesan.\n\nJust like in most Italian restaurants, we got started off with complimentary bread with olive oil / vinegar dipping sauce. Nice crust on the outside and soft absorbent inside. What more do you want?\n\nThe mushrooms came out first of the orders, and they were delicious. Couldn't care less that basically bread crumbs and fungus (with spinach and garlic). According to my mom, the version she knows from San Jose uses a higher number of smaller mushrooms. I guess you gotta go big in Vegas though, and I didn't mind fork-and-knifing it. I thought that the parmesan cheese available table-side did enhance the flavor, which some might view as a shortcoming.\n\nI sampled some linguini too. It's pretty good, although the clam-to-noodle ratio reminds me strongly of ramen, in a not-that-appealing way. I like to have more of a balance of protein and starch.\n\nMy veal was nicely pounded, breaded, and fried and was sufficiently tender as far as that goes. The melted provolone and marinara sauce and the accompanying spaghetti were all great complements. I just realized that I didn't dust off my leftover veal with parmesan before leaving, which makes me a bit sad.\n\nOverall, it was good, solid Italian food. One of the best parts, really, was the view, which strongly correlates with the obvious Las Vegas Strip price markups. It's alright though - I would have been hard-pressed to spend the $50 in gift cards at another time. Yay for heavy reductions on out-of-pocket costs!"

I have one close to where I live and ate there only because we had been given a gift certificate. \n\nWhile in Vegas with my family, I insisted we have a big family meal at Maggiano's. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday night. \n\nWe arrived on time, but had to wait more than thirty minutes to be seated. The place was totally packed, so we had to stand, smashed together, in the bar area while we waited. That sucked, and made me wonder why we bothered with reservations.\n\nOur server was extremely busy (there was an 18 top in our section), but he did a fantastic job, considering how busy he was, and how many questions and picky orders my family came up with.\n\nThe food was fantastic. I ordered the spinach artichoke appetizer and the eggplant parmesan. Everyone at the table absolutely loved the spinach artichoke. However, we prefered it on the table bread, as opposed to the \"crostini\" it's served with. The little pieces of crostini are too small and too hard for the yummilicious, creamy, piping hot, rich spinach artichoke dip. \n\nMy eggplant parm was beautiful and delicious. Unfortunately, in total vegas style, it was enormous. A small family could have shared it (I have a big family....haha). It was just perfect. I'm not used to whole pieces of roasted garlic in my eggplant parm, but they were delightful little treats to discover here and there. It couldn't have been better, honestly. Four meals came out of it- the one that night, a midnight snack later, my meal on the plane the next day, and my husband's lunch the next day. It was even delicious cold!\n\nFor desert, my sister ordered the 5 desert platter. It had tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate cake, apple pie ala mode, and....I can't remember the last one. It was so pretty- and only $9.95. The whole table shared it, and we still had leftovers. I'm not a fan of sweets, so I only nibbled a couple things. My sister said it was the best cheesecake she'd ever had.\n\nAll in all, it was a fantastic night. I remember sitting back for a moment, looking around the table... everyone was laughing, eating, and having a wonderful time."

They also have a great alcohol selection and assist you in helping find a wine that best fits your meal that night.

They put the slice on chocolate sauce and it seems to be garnished so nicely. Though, I think I'm only going to order at the to go counter, seeing that the last time I order it at the bar, they kind of just got the slice and didn't really do much with it. Still tasted great, but I actually do enjoy how they garnish it.\n\nPutting all of that aside. The restaurant and its food is just as splendid altogether.

The crostini was fine it could be sliced thin get but the dip was just HORRIBLE!

Due to Las Vegas traffic and a double overtime basketball game I attended, our party arrived at approximately 7:55. I checked in to the front desk and said hello. To which I was not greeted and immediatly asked for the reservation name. I provide the name and am told that due to my lateness, keep in mind I am 10 minutes late to a reservation at a restaurant, they marked me as a no show and notified the yelp reservation site. At this point I am already annoyed, but I am on vacation and starving so I state the reason for my 10 minutes of tardiness. I continue and ask if we  can get another table. The \"greeter\" says I will have to wait at the end of the line for an hour to two hour  wait . I am still calm at this point and oblige to stand and wait. A minute passes and a heavy set supervisor type asks my party to move from the desk area. We move over to the corner by a coat rack. Another minute passes, the supervisor again states to move away from the coat rack area also. With my patience drawing low, I move over again to another open spot in the corner. After a couple minutes the supervisor AGAIN states to move away from this new spot. Not once does he show us another place to stand, nor does he say please or  thank you or anything but move. Rather, he comes off as annoyed at the fact that we are occupying space and breathing within the reastaurant. Finally, we have had enough and call the manager . A \"manager type\" scaddadles over after about 15 minutes and says whats wrong. We tell him the situation and he coldly replies that he is busy and the we missed our reservation time. Also so, he has no suggestion as to where to stand and wait in the restaurant. We left. Ridiculous service by a faux Italian establishment that has not the slightest idea about Italian culture, gratitude or hosting. They are obviously solely interested in getting you in and out as fast as possible. You are not a customer to them, you are another number to stuff with chef boyardee noodles at $20 a pop."

However, I have not been back to this place for at least 3 years because there are so many Italian restaurants in town. I came back last night for my friends bday and found out they've changed their menu quite a bit. I guess my palate has changed as well and became more picky. I wasn't completely satisfied. \n\nI was surprised that they don't have any pesto sauce on any dish. They also took always the half/ full size. They only have one size for their entrees  now where it's more for individuals rather than sharing. I guess that makes more sense for the restaurants on the profit sides.\n\nAfter I sat down, it took the server 10 minutes to bring me some water and then another 5 or 10 minutes to take my drink order. Even though I was the only one who arrived in our table, I was bit annoyed by it. The server was friendly though. I wasn't sure if they were under staffed or he's just keep forgetting about me. \n\nI was not impressed by any of the pasta we tried. We tried fettuccine Alfredo, gnocchi and Italian sausage, and shrimp scampi. Alfredo sauce was not creamy enough. I like the vodka cream sauce in gnocchi but gnocchi was overcooked.

The food was wonderful. Everything we ordered, including the dessert, was at least a 4/5 rating. The service was excellent. Friendly and just the right amount of attention without hovering. The view of the strip and the Wynn is a nice taste of Las Vegas. The roving musicians I can take or leave. It's a bit coercive when you are asked if you want a song for your lady in front of her, and knowing that they expect payment."

            "review": "This is my first time at a \"buyer beware\" restaurant!\n\nWhen a customer takes a bite then returns a dish because it's not good, the restaurant doesn't happily take it back... then charge for it anyway. Right? Not normal, Maggiano's - especially for a supposedly established chain upscale restaurant. (It was soggy bow-tie pasta a/ spinach, btw.  Ick. Exchanged for Pizza-Hut quality spaghetti marinara, though they still charged for the more expensive bow-tie - we balked, but they would not budge. Supposedly it came from the kitchen or management, the nice waitress still got our normal 18% tip.)\n\nBad taste in my mouth from a bland dish and dirty rotten maneuver. First and last time, thank you.\n\nUPDATE: After a whole lot of nudging they apologized and fixed the difference on my credit card.  They also said they were sending a little \"gift\".  Well, now it's been three months and nothing ever arrived.  \n\nSo for same reason -- careless lack of regard / seriousness for customer service -- STARS UNCHANGED.\n\nThe customer service training at this outfit just is rather careless, and that doesn't feel good.  Very nice people, everyone I interacted with, but they lack common classy restaurant business sense.  Maybe it's Vegas culture and I'm used to L.A. and midwest?  I do sense there's a weird thing going on in Vegas service culture.  Anyway, I'm ragging on their manners, but two-stars also reflects the quality of food, it's really quite unremarkable.  Interior modern but likewise absolutely unremarkable.\n\n(BUT, and this was nice, a guy goes around and sings to your table.  Don't know if that's regular.  Normally would have earned a star for that ;)"

I believe it was linked to Foursquare?? Not sure though.  \n\nWe took my mom out for a late Mother's Day dinner.  It wasn't crowded; which was great...though it got a bit crowded after 6pm.  While, we waited for my mom to arrive we sat at the bar.  My husband got a beer and he got a little surprise!  The glass in which the bartender poured the beer had a lipstick mark.  It was gross.  He told the bartender and looked at it in shock.  He gladly switched it out.  \n\nWe went with the family style \"classic\" option which includes 2 appetizers, salads and desserts & 4 entrees.  We got the calamari and zucchini for appetizer.  The ceasar and spinach salad.  The chicken parm, grilled salmon, spaghetti w/ meatballs and gnocchi w/ italian sausage.  Spumoni ice cream and tiramisu for dessert.  My favorite was the calamari, cesar salad, chicken parm and desserts...everything else is okay.  I didn't care to much for the salmon, though.  The portions were huge; had to take a lot of it home.  I didn't understand how they just put the ice cream in a warm bowl...by the time we got it, it was melted.  Maybe they should put it in an ice bowl??  The waiter was nice and service was quick.  View is nice...oversees the Wynn properties.  There is also a man that walks around in his violin to play music for you; which I believe you have to tip him. \n\nIt's a good place to eat if there is a big group of you and craving Italian food."

I wanted a lighter fare so I ordered the caprese mozzarella and the cheese was so good.  I did order grilled scallops for my main course, but I think it was sitting under the lights for too long and the scallops were overcooked...to the point of being stringy and hard.  The manager took the order away and offered to replace the scallops for another dish on the house.  At that point we were full from the pasta dish so we declined.  I think it was just an oversight on such a busy night.  Beside this incident, we really enjoyed our meal at Maggiano, service was excellent, food was delicious, ambiance was authentic and on point.  If you're craving for some real authentic italian food, this place is a great option."

We were immediately seated and service was prompt.  \nThe appetizer we chose which was stuffed mushrooms was quite delicious and I would order these again.\nMy dish was a Shrimp Risotto which wasn't a part of the regular menu, but a special they had.  I thought it was good, but it didn't \"wow\" me.  I probably wouldn't order it again.\nMy mom had a Beef Tenderloin dish...and because she invariably cannot finish her meal, she offered some to me.  I found the beef to be very good, and in fact wished I had ordered that instead.\nMy brother ordered a Lobster Carbonara dish which he was disappointed with because they mistakenly did not put bacon in the dish...even though it is listed and most carbonara's should have it.  I got a bite of the lobster in it and thought it was okay.\nOverall, the meal was good and I would probably eat here again, but would try another dish.  The prices here are not too bad.  About $60 for three of us including appetizer and drinks."

One person had a party of 8 with a confirmed reservation and was told by the hostess they don't show a reservation and maybe they had Maggiano's confused with another place.

I used the open table feature to make a reservation (not knowing if it was really needed or not, but I figured why not). I'm glad I did. When we made it in to the restaurant it was packed and there was a wait. We were seated immediately. \n\nWe were seated in a comfortable booth seat, and served water immediately and given some explanation of the menu. This place had a good variety of Italian food from pastas, to chicken, beef and seafood selections. I liked that they had a family style option as well. At first glance I would say this place looks pricey specially since your entr\u00e9e comes with just your entr\u00e9e no salad or soup like Olive Garden. \n\nWe ordered a side salad to share that was $4.95 but it was the perfect size for two specially since we were stuffing our faces with the yummy French bread served with olive oil and vinegar (oh so yummy, and dangerous!). \n\nOur plates took over 30 minutes to arrive, if it was not for the bread and salad I would have been more upset. \n\nI ordered Mom's Lasagna made with meatballs and sausage with your choice of marinara or meat sauce. I choose marinara since so much meat came with the dish already. My plate arrived and what do you know, it probably could have served four people, fairly large portions. I ate all of it, in phases but I ate it all. It was exquisite. Perfect layering, the lasagna stayed together (I hate when you cut into lasagna and the layers fall apart). \n\nMy favorite part was being serenaded by a duo (violin and guitar) to one of my wedding songs (It's Impossible). If it weren't for the Wynn in the background I could almost say I was in Italy.\n\nI don't have any complaints about this place. Our total bill came to $37.50: two entrees, one side salad and one beverage. We came on a Monday night and it was busy so definitely try and make reservations if you can."

For entrees we ordered all pasta items with the standouts being the lasagna and manicotti dishes.  For dessert we tried the chocolate cake and cheesecake.  I'm not a chocolate person so I didn't try it but the cheesecake was Devine.  We actually ended up with two pieces to match the size of the chocolate cake.  Portions are huge enough for 5-6 really.

But if you live there, you know that you can save the Strip for the tourists. Maggiano's Little Italy is the exception to this.\n\nThe happy hour is one of the best that I've experienced in Las Vegas. Boasting $2.50 appetizers and well drinks with $3 premium drinks and beers. This place is a great place to stop after work. You have to get there somewhat early or be forced to wait outside. The dining area is a bit cramped. But it's best just to situate yourself at the bar.\n\nThe appetizers are tasty and not of your typical bar flair. I usually favored the calamari and tomato mozzarella. Free Italian bread with Vinaigrette sauce make it even more delectable. All the better to wash down the drinks with. \n\nWith the main dining so close and the tunes of classic jazz standards overhead the ambiance can be busy. But it never seemed to escalate over a dull roar. So keeping conversation is never a problem. Along the walls are classic pictures of \"Old Vegas\" and it's easy to get stopped along the way to the restrooms and take in these old photos as if you were in a museum. \n\nThe bartenders pour a mean drink and remember the locals well. This isn't an easy feat when you serve as many drinks as these guys do. Each bartender has their \"specialty\" drink but don't push it down your throat. Ask bartender \"Chris\" about his Poma-tini. It's a pomegranate flavored martini that is refreshing, smooth, and very drinkable.\n\nSadly, I've never had a full fledged meal there. The happy hour was always enough for us. I have indulged in a slice of the cheesecake, which gives the Original Cheesecake Factory a run for it's money. The filling was smooth and creamy and the strawberry topping tart and sweet. And the best part was the price. Only $5 for this massive chunk. \n\nMaggiano's Little Italy inside the Fashion Show Mall is outstanding and I recommend this place to any friends who are visiting.\n\nThe only think keeping this place from a Five Star Rating is the fact that it does get very busy and sometimes the bartenders tend to lose track of you. \n\nFour Stars for:\nGreat deals\nStrong drinks\nSuper Hour\nTasty appetizers"

Fresh and evenly flavored but nothing I can't easily make at home. (first plate came out and my husband took a bite only to get a long blonde hair in his mouth.. we notified our waitress who immediately apologized and took the plate to the manager, which came over to apologize and offer a new appetizer whether the same or a different one, and comped the appetizer for the troubles.)\nMy son had the kids Mac n cheese, one of the best Mac n cheeses we have tasted off of a kids menu.\nMy daughter had a Caesar salad add shrimp:  fresh and like a Caesar should taste.. I did not try her shrimp because she ate them so fast so they must've been good.\nI ordered the lobster carbonara add Oscar style (crab meat and asparagus).  (((Next day update:: I just finished my leftovers and I can actually judge this dish.  I think it was good, but could've been better based on the ingredients alone.   The sun dried tomatoes would've been better in smaller pieces, and there weren't enough snap peas.. a few more would've given it that different texture that this dish lacks.  Maybe add a slice of or recommend garlic bread to soak up some of that cheesy sauce.))) \nMy husband ordered the rigatoni d, that was quite delicious!\nWe also had the chocolate cake a la mode for dessert.  I should've taken our waitress suggestion and tried the Italian cream cake.. the chocolate one was good but it was just that, a good slice of chocolate overload cake (and this is coming from a chocolate lover.). \n\nWhy we will go back:  ambience/atmosphere, good service, big selection."

I happened to be doing a little shopping over the weekend, so a friend and I decided to grab a quick bite. \n\nThe greeters were super friendly and funny...I always appreciate a little humor. People in the service industry on the strip can get so jaded dealing with tourists. \n\nReservations were not needed during off peak hours. We came here around like 2 pm, and we were seated immediately.\n\nWe ordered the fried zucchini, ravioli, and Maggiano's salad.\n\nHOLY MOTHER OF **** the fried zucchini is amazing. I don't know where they are buying their zucchini, but the pieces were gigantic and barely fit on the serving platter (let's try not to think about GMO's for the moment). And my goodness, the tangy creaming sauce they bring with it...so good! I could've eaten ONLY this. \n\nMaggiano's salad was a spectacular burst of flavor. I normally hate blue cheese, but it was nicely tossed throughout the salad with crispy pieces of prosciutto. The prosciutto was a little overcooked, but that was really my only complaint. \n\nOur waiter was prompt, but unfriendly. I don't think I saw a smile the entire time. In fact, he seemed a little annoyed we were lavishing in our \"girly time.\" He could stand to take a couple notes from the greeting staff at the door, they were so nice!"

I made a 7:15pm reservation but we arrived about 20 minutes earlier (Vegas traffic unpredictable). I asked them if we could be  seated and in less than five minutes we were already enjoying ourselves. Nestor was the name of the waiter, he was there when needed with suggestions of appetizers, wine and desserts. Simply GREAT SERVICE!!"

Either way, they are welcoming; but the wait time can be long so I recommend getting a reservation if necessary, especially during weekend nights.\n\nYou get complimentary bread in the beginning after you order, but don't eat too much of it because the dishes are pretty big. I have ordered the \"Famous Rigatoni 'D'\" couple of times and the \"Peppercorn-Crusted Sirloin\"; they were both good! The Rigatoni can get really heavy because of the Marsala cream sauce, but don't get me wrong, the flavors are all there. The mushrooms & the chicken go really well with the pasta and the sauce.  \nLast time I went, I got the Sirloin cooked as medium, but it was pretty chewy so next time I get that, I will be sure to get it medium-rare. I had to cut them into little tiny dices to get through them. The garlic mash potatoes that were on the plate added a nice touch to the sirloin. \nI never have room for dessert when I eat here because the proportions are pretty big! But it fills me up so I'm not complaining. The waiters are all so kind here, but the noise level can get really high, especially if there is a large group of people sitting in the middle celebrating a birthday or whatever.

The food was excellent, the quantities generous, the atmosphere upscale but not formal, and the service both courteous and efficient.  The three of us were uniformly pleased with our respective selections: chicken, spinach and ricotta stuffed manicotti for me, eggplant parmesan with gluten free pasta for Norm, and I believe \"traditional home-style lasagna for Dennis, a favorite of the Philly native.\n \nOur meals were preceded by warm, soft and delicious house-baked bread accompanied with olive oil, which we determined not to over indulge in in anticipation of the main dishes of reportedly large portions, which again, did not disappoint in either quality or quantity. \n\nMy manicotti rested in on a pool of delicious and thankfully not nauseatingly rich Asiago cream sauce, a 4-Lactaid event of potential dairy disaster, especially as it was determined early on there would be no leftovers, but all settled just fine and I don't regret one rich delicious bite or spooning up the remaining Asiago sauce after the entr\u00e9e was gone.  My meal came in at a very reasonable (especially for  the Strip) $18.50 plus $6.50 spinach side salad with pine nuts, a not-overpowering smattering of red onion, applewood smoked bacon, a white balsamic vinaigrette, and blue cheese,  I loathe bleu cheese but had mistaken it on sight for feta, and the salad did not suffer for its removal. Regrettably there was no room for dessert. \n\nService was polite, efficient, and more than reasonably attentive.  My iced tea and water glasses never stayed low for long.  Our total for 3, including wine, beer, and my tea and side salad came in at I believe under $100, which we agreed was very reasonable given the location, quality, quantity, service, atmosphere and ambiance.  \n\nWe were surprised to learn this restaurant is part of a modest sized chain of Maggiano's Little Italy restaurants, and grateful to find out they have one comparatively near us in Phoenix, over in Scottsdale.  Given distances (and our budgets!), Maggiano's won't be a regular dining destination for us, but it will be a special one.  If all locations are as good as this one, we collectively highly recommend."

And don't lose your hostess when they lead you to your table; this place is huge and a maze.\n\nI came here for lunch and we began with complimentary bread.  Given it was lunch, there was a lunch special for half a sandwich, soup, or salad (pick two).  Some people tried this at my table, but it did not look the most appetizing.   I tried the gnocchi with sausage.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, but the sausage was not the greatest as far as flavor.  The sauce was quite good though.  \n\nOverall if you are craving Italian while at the Fashion Mall, then Maggiano's will do, but it is pricey and probably won't bring you back to Little Italy in terms of flavor."

Went during lunch time and had some drinks, appetizers,  and pasta! Yummy. \nFirst off, the restaurant is gorgeous and huge. They have a few rooms that can accommodate large parties.   Love the fact that they have a specific menu where all proceeds go to the make a wish foundation. Love the view of the strip from the restaurant. Had the lasagna and I thought it was delish!! My husband had to be difficult so he had them make him a specific  pasta that wasn't on the menu and they did so without hesitation.  The waitress was awesome and suprisingly didn't seem frustrated by my husbands need to be picky! Lol. Enjoyed everything about our experience!"

Called in the afternoon to see if we could move up to 7 which they were able to accommodate. Got there and the atmosphere is great. Just a couple minutes and they seated us. Food was family style and amazing. I can't even remember all the courses but there was sublime mozzarella cheese, artichoke dip and bread for appetizers, sirloin, chicken, lasagna and Alfredo and amazing dessert apple frittata was crazy. The waitress was fantastic, completely attentive and helpful in her suggestions. One down was table was in close to other patrons, bumping chairs issue. Probably because we moved up our reservation. One person at the table next to us was total rude jerk (I paraphrase for this review) toward my daughter which came close to ruining the evening, but that wasn't totally restaurants fault. Managers stepped in and gave us a private room to be sure the rest of our night was perfect. This place is top notch, don't hesitate to let management know if you have special request. They're very cool and want to make your experience the best it can be."

I had my lunch wedding reception at Little Maggiano's and was so impressed by their amazing customer service, food, ambiance, and patience throughout the planning process and on my wedding day.  I started e-mailing the banquet staff about 6 months out from the event.  Jesse and Kara were absolutely amazing to work with...they answered all of my e-mails within a timely manner.  They were also so accommodating with my various requests.  I was so impressed when I walked in to my wedding reception and saw everything set up so beautiful and all of my guests having so much fun.  Now the food, that's another story....It was DELICIOUS!!!  The portions were big and the food was wonderful.  I don't even have enough words to rant and rave enough about Maggiano's Little Italy!!!  I would highly recommend them for any type of event.  Even my guests were saying, \"this is the best wedding I have been to!\" and I really do owe it to the chefs, wait staff, and banquest staff for making the day amazing!!"

I wish they had one in San Diego, but the closest one to us is in Orange County at the South Coast Plaza. I ordered the four cheese ravioli which came with two sauces, basil pesto and marinara, evenly distributed over the dish. The amount of ravioli was bountiful. I was barely able to finish it and when I did I was really full. My wife had the spaghetti with meatballs which she had no problem finishing.  We tried to eat here again before we left but it was too busy. I think there was an hour wait. And this was on a Sunday night. This is a good sign the restaurant is doing something right since there are plenty of choices at the mall.  The service was a bit slow but the waiter kept us informed on when our meals would be ready. No big deal, we were not in a rush. Even though I am not a big fan of chain restaurants, this one is worth a try."

From the hostess who ignored us and spent time talking to servers while she saw us waiting to the waiter who put in the wrong salad order to the server who brought us our main course before we were finished with the salad the employees were not the best. The food was very good so that is the only thing that kept me from giving 2 stars. Maybe it was a bad night for the workers. ( main courses cooled down while we were finishing our salads in a hurry. Couldn't linger over salads since our food was already on the table. )"

I had Maggiano's book marked so it was the obvious choice.  Pulled into Fashion Show Mall garage, and I just happened to park right by an elevator that led directly to Maggiano's... Already winning.  Out the elevator we walked into what looked to be the alternative entrance with a sign that said go to the main host booth up front.  It was a little awkward at first walking all the way through the restaurant to get to the front but it gave us a chance to admire the place....   Loved the atmosphere and decor.\nFresh bread was good but pretty basic, slight disappointment there as I was kinda expecting something that would blow Olive Garden's breadsticks out the water.  But they did have some legit olive oil on the table.\nWe ordered the Chefs Special Lobster carbonara and chicken fettuccine.  The lobster carbonara... just might be the best pasta I've had.  Perfectly made creamy cheesy carbonara sauce infused with the flavors both the smoked bacon and the lobster was crazy good.\nMy wife's fettuccine was a huge disappointment in comparison.  It had an off taste that she nor I did not like.  Fortunately we were able to take it back, I sadly gave my wife my dish and I ordered lasagna, which was super good too, easily one of the best lasagna dishes I had.\nI was also told they are willing to do custom pasta dishes where you can pick your noddles, sauces, and items in the pasta."

Not a problem for us, considering we had no reservation and we were waiting for the rest of our party.  Our buzzer was activated almost exactly 45 mins after we spoke with the hostess.  We were seated just about 5 minutes later at a great table facing their floor to ceiling windows which looked out toward Encore, Wynn and Palazzo.  It was a great view at 6:30pm.  \n\nThe food was excellent. Our order included garlic bread, zucchini fritte, shrimp scampi, shrimp tropheo, lemon chicken and salmon oscar.  Everyone enjoyed their a la carte entrees.  The scampi and tropheo were both such large servings that 2 people could easily share.  Then we ordered dessert, their 5 item sampler, lemon cookies($2) and profiteroles ($2).  All was soooooo delicious!!  And their 5 item sampler was only $9.95 -- but each of the samples was a portion fit for one person as a normal serving!   All of the food tasted fresh and extremely flavorful.  Service could have been a bit faster but one has to take in to account that many large parties go to this location on The Strip at Fashion Show.  Our server was extremely friendly and helpful.  Other workers also pitched in when we asked for anything.  \n\nParking is a bit unconventional, especially if you dine at late evening/night because obvious parking would in the mall's garages.  However the Mall does not stay open as late as Maggiano's.  I would suggest parking at a casino across the street to save yourself the confusion.\n\nAll in all, the experience was great and the price was not bad either.  For all items listed above, the total came to about $150 and fed 4 adults and one child with leftovers.  I will be going back in the future and would happily suggest Maggiano's to anyone!"

Giant crystal chandeliers line the majestic hallways as you pass through the entryway and multiple private dining areas lined with dark wood.  The bar area is dark paneled, well-staffed, and tucked far in the busy back / main dining room.  It was packed when we arrived, but we found seats and ordered cocktails quite easily (though we heard there was a one-hour wait for tables for those without reservations).\n\nWhen our table for 10 was ready we headed over to a corner lot where our group gathered.  It wasn't particularly easy to navigate the space in which they'd placed our party, as they've crammed as many tables in the room as they can and we were situated up against six booths. However, the waiters were quite patient practicing a constant ballet / battle with us while we hugged one another and took photographs (or they just went around the other way).\n\nThe ambiance inside Maggiano's was so dark, warm, and cozy that I was expecting more from the food.  The calamari that someone ordered as an appetizer was boring, bland, and uninspired.  The spinach salad I ordered was GIANT and tasty; however, I wished I'd stopped there.  Unfortunately my huge vat of gnocci was equally bland and mediocre, and the bread on the tables was stale/hard.  It was so loud and busy in the restaurant (and I was drunk, which I'll get to in a minute) that I didn't even think to ask to try GT's entree (linguini and clams in red sauce) which he said was a good thing, because he hated it (and said that the food was much better a few years ago).\n\nThe adorable accordian player was a wonderful touch; he played some of our requests at one end of the table (although it was so loud in the restaurant that those on the other end couldn't hear).  Throughout our meal I was shocked that I wasn't drinking my wine; every time I turned to look at my glass I could swear it looked as if I hadn't touched it.\n\nTurns out that the stealth waiters were just constantly topping it off, which unfortunately resulted in a disequilibrium in the brain of yours truly, and my evening ended with me trying to get my mother in law to take us to a strip club and arguing with GT's uncle (who'd flown in from Oahu for the occasion) about whether or not boys are hornier than girls.  BAD, SELF, BAD!  Perhaps a waiter asking a gal every now and again if she'd like more wine would help a hypothetically drunk girl manage her evening in a slightly more classy manner.\n\nMy main gripe, however, was that GT and I had made cupcakes for dessert that spelled out \"OH, SHIT, SHE'S 70!\" when all lined up properly.  But we brought them in our cupcake pan and the waiter brought them out in the same pan we'd brought them in (though we'd asked that they be put on a large plate).  As a result, they read \"OHSH   ITSH  ES70!\"  Also, although the kind/patient waiter did light the candles for us, I got the impression that the staff just wrote us off at the end, or perhaps someone in the back was a little ticked off with us for bringing our own dessert.  Regardless of the reason, I thought it very odd that they didn't bring us plates or forks with dessert - we had to hunch over the table and eat cupcakes over the tiny cupcake wrappers, carefully trying not to spill crumbs everywhere, which is not so easy to do when you're drunk on Maggiono's bottomless glass of wine."

Arguably better than the buffet options on the strip which costs too much!"

It was the same story both times - they tend to serve customers based on who looks like they're ballers.  I guess that means I don't look like I'm not balling out of control, because I always have to practically beg for a drink refill.  It makes me wonder what it is that makes them classify people that way... I was dressed in nice business attire... so did I look like a redneck or something?  Was it because I was young?  Either way, the Maggiano's staff needs to wise up:  you never know who someone is and how well they will tip by appearances alone.  Just sayin'.\n\nThe food isn't that great either.  During both visits, my fianc\u00e9 and I ended up with pathetic salads, burned or under-seasoned entrees, and virtually no service whatsoever.  Both times, something had to be sent back because it was either made incorrectly or was disgusting.  Pathetic.  Get it together.\n\nIs there something I'm just not \"getting\" that makes this place so special?  As far as I have seen, the elitist attitude from the servers amounts to jack squat.  They can't deliver on any front - food OR service.  This is another scenario where I really feel like you're paying for ambiance, and as I always say, I can't EAT ambiance.  \n\nI know!  Maybe I should go be a baller at the local McDonald's - I could order the entire dollar menu and I GUARANTEE the food would be better than Maggiano's!"

We arrived at the fashion show mall, parked, and wondered our way out front to the entrance of Maggiano's.  I always love the atmosphere in these kind of places.  I'm not a big fan of Italian food, so don't read too much into my comments about the food.  The Calamari Fritte was a bit greasy with too much oil, but was overall pretty good.  The marinara dipping sauce was superb.  We also had stuffed mushrooms, which were really good.  They were stuffed with spinach and topped with seasoned bread crumbs and served in a garlic white wine sauce.  My fiance and I shared a bowl of Linguine di Mare.  It had lobster, shrimp, clams, & mussels with noodles in a spicy lobster tomato broth.  It was pretty good.  Lots of meat.  Very filling.  A man with a guitar and another man with an accordion serenaded us with a romantic Italian song.  Simply romantic.  We had nice seats facing Las Vegas Boulevard.  We lingered a while after paying the bill, but the server stopped refilling our water.  This bothered me a little.  I was unusually thirsty and could not seem to get enough.  The bill was almost $60.  We had to take an alternate route back to the car because The Fashion Show Mall was closed.  I enjoyed this experience and would go again, but would prefer some place else because I'm not a big fan of Italian food."

It is however made to order and above the quality of most other chain restaurants.\n\nTiramisu here was the best I have ever had.

It was a short walk from our hotel and we wanted some REAL food after nights of bingeing on whatever we can get our hands on after the clubs. It is definitely on the expensive side where a half order of pasta will be around 11-17 bucks while a full order will cost you 20+. \n\nThey do encourage family style for tables of 4+, but i think the cheapest family style was still around 20 a person. \n\nOut of the four of us we ordered: spaggetti with meatballs, lobster alfredo, fettucini alfredo and linguine with clams. All of the dishes were tasteless. I had to drown my linguine with claims with half the bottle of salt  and all my friends did too. Maybe the chef forgot about the salt??

We started with the zucchini appetizer which was all kinds of amazing! They were lightly dusted with parmesan cheese and served with a lemon aioli of some sort. Very delicious. My boyfriend thought they had a little too much batter, but I thought they were perfect. We asked for a side of marinara or meat sauce with the app and our server gladly brought us a little of both. They too were very good! Very different from each other which I thought was nice.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Francese, I think that's how it's spelled, with angel hair pasta instead of the potatoes. It was a lemon chicken with a parmesan crust and what I would describe as a light creamy mushroom sauce. Idk but it was good! Not too lemony or heavy on the sauce and the perfect portion. I saved one chicken breast to take home because I wanted some later.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the rigatoni d which he was really disappointed with.  It had an odd sweet flavor to it. We took most of it home with us and never touched it after that. \n\nOverall it was a good experience! I definitely will be back to try something new!"

The server was really nice and she even gave us her card at the end of the meal (after she had learned that we were locals).  We ordered Chicken Fetuccini Alfredo, Baked Ziti, and the Fried Zuchinni as an appetizer.  We were about to order more than the Fried Zuchinni for an appetizer, but I'm glad we didn't.  They turned out to be Zuchinni Spears (6) and they were huge! The breading on the Zuchinni was to die for!  It was cooked to perfection. I wonder if they used Panko to bread it?  I highly recommend it.  The Ziti was not that impressive at all.  It was way too meaty and sauce was bland in taste.  My Alfredo was good and rich in taste.  I had no complaints about the service (they even were able to give us a window seat when we asked...no reservation made).  We had a good view of the strip and Wynn casino.  I'd definitely come here again.  I would have scored them 5 star, but the Ziti knocked 'em down.  Next time, I want to try their Calamari!"

I usually get the Linguine di Mare with lobster, shrimp, mussels and calms but this day, I decided to get the shrimp scampi thinking it might be less food for me to eat.\n\nOur server was friendly and happy with a smile but not annoying.  He was great to bring us bread, mmmm, warm bread and poured the oil, and brought balsamic vinegar to include.  It was a great start to a delicious meal.  It didn't seem we had to wait long for our main seafood meals.\n\nThe portion size didn't disappoint (I had asked our server if they had half portions but nope!) There was about 20 shrimp and on top of a large plate of angel hair pasta.  My husband helped me eat the shrimp but it was too much pasta for me.

And while the dining experience for me is usually diminished when dining in a mall (even a Vegas mall), I found that the location was actually quite nice and lended itself to great views of the strip.  I would have liked to have tried the desserts but I hardly could finish my meal because of the large portions--I guess that means I'll have to go back."

I was impressed with how often he checked up on our table and he took the time to hold a conversation with our family.\n \nI tried their lobster carbonara and their chicken flatbread has always been a favorite! If you haven't tried, this is worth a share around the table. \n\nFood is always prepared as quickly as possible but still maintains its quality and taste.

We then shared the salmon club sandwich. Good tasting, could have had more seasoning, but all was yummy. Food was well proportioned and they served bread as well. So, very filling, excellent management services bc our waitress forgot to place our food order and we sat for a long time. Otherwise a wonderful experience . We will be back.

The waitress was terrible. She had zero customer service skills. She never asked us if our food was good, if we wanted refills on water, or even dessert. Overall I found service to be very sub par throughout Vegas. Everyone that works in the hospitality industry there gives off this air of entitlement. Anyways, she got what she deserved, 10%. There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas to get GOOD food and bad service. Skip this one."

We usually just sit in the bar area and have drinks and appetizers and whatever we order is always full of flavor, a hearty serving and tasty! A few things I would recommend, the Maggiano's Salad with a delicious house dressing and crispy prosciutto, the mussles with red sauce that is spicy and sweet and makes you want to pick up the bowl and drink it! The flatbreads, bruschetta, sausage and peppers, stuffed shells and chopped salad are also top picks. \n\nEven if you are feeling like you need to unbutton your pants as the server asks you if you would like dessert, say yes!! We ordered the mini sampler and every little delectable sugary bite of creme brulee, apple crostada, chocolate zuccotto bites, tiramisu and cheesecake were perfect. \n\nWe will definitely be back.

As you would expect from any decent Italian place the prices are a little high and being right in the fashion show mall doesn't help. Overall the food is great and the atmosphere is what you expect for what your paying. \n\nNow for my favorite part about this place. They have something called a Family style dinner. To order this you are required a party of 4. The cost is about $35 per person and completely worth it! This includes the following: two appetizers,two salads, two pastas, two entrees and a desert. Now you might be thinking wow that's a rip off? BUT WAIT there is more to this then meets the eye. All the items have to be selected off the pre-build family menu BUT the portions are UNLIMITED!! for instance if you order 2 appetizers and you greatly enjoy them tell the server and he will bring you another order of them. Same goes with the salad, pasta and everything else. The kicker here is that you ALSO get to take home your leftovers!\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Italian food! My personal favorite dish is the following.\n\nFour Cheese Ravioli +\nRavioli stuffed with ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella, and provolone filling sprinkled with house cheese, then browned in the oven and served in pesto-alfredo cream sauce with a touch of marinara. \n\nIt is AMAZING! It also always puts a smile on my face :)"

I shared the gnocchi and meat lasagna with Chris L. and my Mom and aunt shared the corn pasta with shrimp.  The corn pasta was a must for them because they are both on a gluten-free diet so regular wheat pasta just doesn't cut it.  I love that a serious Italian restaurant cares about the wheat-free side of life and offers wheat-free options.  I also love that a serious Italian restaurant can taste this good and not break the bank.\n\nThe wine list is great and the desserts were pretty good--I got the profiterole with ice cream and chocolate sauce and the dessert would've been divine if it weren't for the profiterole....  The two baby boomers at the table each got the (GF) creme brulee and loved it.\n\nSo, for what Maggiano's is, I'm giving it 5 stars.  It certainly beats the other \"cheap\" food of Vegas and the price is so much better than the expensive restaurants there.  That's a win-win in my book."

The tiramisu was also quite tasty and enormous (not that this matters much since Maggiano's is all you can eat)\n\nMisses included a mediocre (actually pretty bad) gnocchi, oily and limp Eggplant Parmesan, and cheesecake that was heavy and flavorless.\n\nI last went t this Maggiano's back in 2005 and can't say I'd recommend it for 'fine dining,' but in terms of bang-for-your-buck in Las Vegas it is certainly a valid option.\n\n2 Stars for the food, 4 for a good time atomsphere with a big group.

The first-class service he provided to us, despite his n00b status, indicated to me that Maggiano's did not hire your commonplace waiter who's only job was to write down what you wanted.  Not only was he able to describe to us in great detail the dishes we inquired about, he was also honest about what dishes he tried and would recommend.  Of course, he did press us a bit to order more than just entrees, so he was successful in getting us to order a few appetizers lol But those appetizers were all tasty and worth the price of entry (like $1-2 a person for our table of 8).  \n\nCustomizing your entree with a variety of different pastas and sauces, and withholding from certain ingredients is expected @ Maggiano's.  They will ask you how you like things and if you aren't keen on a certain ingredient, the cook will gladly make it to your liking.  This also shows that their entrees aren't \"mass produced\" and  are made-to-order (which is why food takes a bit longer than most to come out).  However, our waiter also promised us that the pasta served was made-on-site and fresh daily, thus enforcing my belief that Maggiano's is a high-caliber restaurant.\n\nFinally, one of the best parts of my experience eating @ Maggiano's is the fact that our waiter was extremely friendly, able to hold conversations and joke around with the group, and also treat us almost like a \"valued\" and welcomed patron of the restaurant.  Yes, we were eating during lunch/daylight hrs and it wasn't too busy, but our waiter made the extra effort and it definitely showed.   \n\nCost for entree & appetizers shared @ the table: $16-20 out the door. For Vegas, that's a great deal for a sit-in restaurant with some amount of class and zero strippers/half naked individuals :)\n\nI will definitely return to Maggiano's LV and hope to duplicate this prior positive dining experiences."

I got so many raves for our reception, and the process was super well done on their part. I was so happy with how everything went, and the communications before the wedding couldn't have been better! I started with Calabria only and ended up super happy I upgraded to include Di Carlo. You can see from my photos how good sized the Di Carlo dance floor ended up being! We also used their recommended photobooth company, and they were amazing, as was the floral company they used, better than I hoped for! We ended up with 49 total people, and you can see from the pictures this was a good size. Although we could have comfortably fit 60 in our space and still had the big dance floor and photobooth area. Our guests also utilized the access to the balcony, which was nice. The bar was fantastic and all staff were perfect. The only thing I would caution is that the speakers in DiCarlo did not work through the house system from Calabria and we did not have a DJ/sound system brought in, so our playlist was not super loud for dancing. We still had a fantastic time but this could have been better, the people there really tried to accomodate us though.  Another good thing about them is they try to get you the most for your money, the packages are all clearly laid out on their website, and they are extremely reasonable with what is logical for your specific event. AND OMG THE FOOD, everyone raved all weekend about our food, the sausage gnocchi being the favorite. You will not regret choosing Maggiano's for your event :) They even arranged a tasting for us in Houston at our local Maggiano's to help decide the menu.  The venue itself is gorgeous so not much need for dressing up, the people are fantastic, and the food is incredible. You can't beat the price either, it was a great value and a no brainer!"

I ordered ravioli and it was pretty average (I think CPK and Lavo have better). Service was excellent and it was pretty busy at the time. Will maybe come back but the food was mediocre."

Even if you don't want pasta, this place still works. The bruschetta appetizer had grilled shrimp on top. Never had seen that, but it worked. The chopped salad was light and refreshing."

            "review": "Love Maggiano's for great pasta! \n\nMaggiano's is noted for their excellent sauces and pasta combinations. You usually get a quite large portion as well. I can usually barely stuff half the bowl down and have to take the rest to go.\n\nI am a fan of the simple fettucine alfredo here. Their sauce is homemade and has that traditional cream taste that is perfect and blows chains like Olive Garden out of the water. Add chicken if you get the chance....the chicken is that soft, pulled chicken taste like it came off a rotisserrie chicken, instead of the gross, rubbery cubes or strips that you get at lesser chain restaurants. So yummy!\n\nDishes are plenty big to share. Appetizers as well. We order the Fried Mozzerella and it is definitely enough for four and impossible for two to eat alone. Very reasonably priced as well, right on par with Olive Garden, but much, much better quality.\n\nIf you do the large 'family style' dining or have a birthday they bring you these soft cookies with a lemon glaze that is perfect for nights when you are already stuffed full of heavy pasta. The perfect quick, sweet bite.\n\nOnly warning is this is not a location that is a quick stop. Save for rare occasions they are extremely busy 7 days a week. Even with a reservation you will likely end up waiting 10 minutes or so before being seated. Request to be seated away from a main aisle way or you risk getting jostled and bumped by passing rude dining parties. \n\nHave always had exceptional service by the servers. They are always personable, quick and welcoming. \n\nThere is a kindly older gentleman who usually comes around with a guitar or accordion (?) and offers you a song with your meal. This is perfect for those celebrating a birthday or anniversary."

He made reservations for two and when we got there, the table was ready and they were waiting for us! They had us sat at such a beautiful spot next to the window in front of the Wynn Hotel (which is always a sight to see!) \n\nWe were immediately treated with bread and balsamic vinegar which was very good! The bread was warm and soft and they kept coming with them! And the balsamic vinegar was also so tasty! We ordered our food and did not wait more then 20/ 25 mins. But we enjoyed it because they had a man walking around playing the violin very beautifuly. We loved it. When we got our dinner it was very delicious and the portions were great! The price was also very reasonable for a restaurant on the strip! They had $14 plate all the way up to $25 dishes. But they had all the Italian classics and many seafood dishes (which was what my boyfriend had, and said it was great!)\n\nI highly recomend this restaurant for people who need a good warm meal in a great, soothing atmosphere! \n\nThe only reason why I gave Maggiano's Little Italy 3 stars was because towards the end of our meal the waiter was standing (not very far from our table) staring us down, waiting for us to finish up and leave. I found it a little rude and uncomfortable, but other then those last 10 mins it was a great experience."

Usually, I use them for meetings -- their private dinning space and budget friendly menus are great anywhere in the USA.  \n\nBut this visit I found myself in the Fashion Mall on the Vegas strip.  I wasn't in the mood to shop nor did I want to pay $6++ for Starbucks so I went into Maggiano's to grab a coffee.  It was between lunch and dinner and the bar was empty.  I bellied up to the bar and ordered my 3 shots of espresso and read my book -- sometimes I find relaxing spots in the most unlikely places.  \n\nThe bartender was friendly but kept her distance as I wasn't in the mood to chat. Plus the off-hour diners kept her busy.  I had to leave before my coffee was finished so she gave me a kid's sippy cup so I could take my coffee to go!  Great service!"

The private room was perfect in size with a large bar at the front and a balcony overlooking the strip. The service during the reception was stellar. I told our bartender/server about my gluten allergy and she was immediately able to identify substitutions and alternate courses for me that would meet my needs. She knew exactly what to do and made me feel at ease right away. I had an awesome chopped salad to start with that made the other non-gluten free people around me jealous. Then I enjoyed marsala mushroom and chicken gluten free pasta. Oh my God, it was out of this world. I need to go to the Maggiano's and Tampa ASAP to have this again. Finally for dessert, I had the creme brulee, again making everyone around me jealous. The meal was unbelievable!! Kudos to the staff and chef at Maggiano's for making the whole night perfect both for guests and for the bride and groom. I have not visited an Italian restaurant since I learned of my allergy but now I absolutely have to go back to Maggiano's.  If you are in Vegas, definitely make this a dinner spot at least one night of your stay."

We had the calamari appetizer and garlic bread. The seafood pasta was loaded clams, shrimp,lobster, and muscles in a rich red sauce. Absolutely delicious. The spaghetti and meatball is also amazing, it comes with a huge, tasty meatball. The portions are big so it's best to come hungry and share an entree. It's obvious that this establishment uses fresh, quality ingredients. Our waiter, Mark, was the absolute best and so on top of everything. Everyone was so nice and I especially loved guy who greeted each table with beautiful songs. This was without a doubt the best place we have eaten during our stay. The atmosphere is classy but without the snobbishness and the view of the strip is also a plus. Best to make a reservation."

We waited for a guest who showed up a few minutes late, but our waiter was kind enough to check on us while we waited. \nOnce our guest showed up, we ordered 2 appetizers;\n \nfried calamari- soft and non chewy, seasoned well\n\nfried eggplant- sliced thin, breaded and fried- double yummy'\n\nsalad- I don't remember what kind, but they were kind enough to substitute the gorgonzola cheese with mozarella.I had to ask them for more avocado, since there was only one piece in the whole salad. I think the waiter returned with a few more pieces (there must have been a shortage of avocados that day). Plus, the dressing was a little weak and I could barely taste it  (they must have been short on that too).\n\ncream pasta with chicken dish- There was barely any sauce on this and what I did manage to get onto my pasta and fork, seemed to have a nice subtle taste to it. Would have been nice to be served pasta that glistened with sauce, instead of me looking and wondering if there was any on there to begin with. Instead of the slogan, \"where's the beef?\" the guestion of the day, should have been, \"where's the sauce?\"\n\nService- good\nfood- mediocre'\nprice- moderate\n\n\nOur waiter mentioned that they'd soon be opening a Maggiano's in Hawaii, I hope by the time that they do, the quality of the food will improve.  Maybe I went on a off day, but I'm willing to give them a second chance.\n\nTill next time, happy eating!"

So when we were in vegas for my birthday we decided to head their for our lunch before we headed back to Cali.   We ordered our meal after awhile because the server was being erratic and then after twenty minutes or so we got our appetizer.  After we recieved it they asked us to move to another table towards the middle and we had to carry our own food and dishes over.  Then after another twenty minutes or so we received our food.  Too bad when we said \"no marinera' on my besties pasta and confirmed that we are sorry but to please substitute and she glady said it was no problem it of course came out with marinera.  However it took so long in the first place for our food to arrive so my bestie stuck to it.  THEN what happened is unbelievable..they actually started VACUUMING right behind us.  Back and Forth Back and Forth with NO warning what-so-ever which I don't even know if it would have made it any better.  After 5-10 minutes...YES SERIOUSLY the couple behind us asked to get the check because they couldn't stand it.  After the whole ordeal our server comes out as if she just realized the vacuum had been on and asks if we want to move.... NO IDIOT THE DUST ALREADY FLEW UP AND LANDED SAFELY ON MY FOOD. I DONT WANT TO EAT NOW I WANT TO GET OUT... \n\napparently they had their carpet cleaned and they needed to vacuum the moisture out....As if that could not wait until another time????\n\nwhat a dissappointment.  So I asked her for their card so I could leave corporate a comment.  I didn't get to it until a month or so later and they said it was too late to leave a comment but too bad I still did.  After my comment I didn't receive any notice that they received my comment.  I am NOT looking for free comps or anything of that nature I just want them to understand that is NOT what I expected in a restuarant...it reminded me of those annoying sweepers in cafeterias/fastfood joints.  \n\nThis location needs HELP"

Usually the lunch portion would be way smaller but I really could not tell the difference. The party/family style is definitely NOT worth the price. I do admit that Maggiano's is probably not even comparable to Bucca but still they overprice their food too much when I could probably get the same thing at a small family owned business.

I had some type of pasta with Lobster all up in it. DAMN it was good. I savored every bite. Everyone else in our party loved the food as well. Even when my son screamed a little, it didn't seem to bother anyone else sitting around us.

I was not really a fan of this dish just because if was overly breaded.  We also had the peppercorn crusted sirloin.  This dish was really good. The meat was tender and the flavors were good.  Along with our meat dishes, we ordered baked ziti and fettuccine alfredo.  I enjoyed the baked ziti but the fettuccine alfredo was too much on the thick side where the noodles clump up together.  The dessert we chose are tiramisu and creme brulee both were yummy. The creme brulee was on the little runny side but it was a really good runny kind.  There were so much food that we even had tons for left overs.  Everyone enjoyed their food before food coma sets in. \n The service was very very very good.  The host was able to hold our table even past the 15 min hold time because our party was so late.  Our wait staff was so friendly and soft spoken.  She was attentive but not annoying.  She approached our table frequently but not too frequent.  Drinks were refilled  before they  even reached half way.  Overall, it was a great experience.

No dish should be drowning in a butter sauce. The salad had wilted lettuce and over dressed. The service I will say was excellent but this in itself is not why I go out for dinner.  They say this is Italian food but can't imagine that any Italian would say this is good sauce.  Too many good Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas area to ever go back."

This particular location is given special attention because it's in Vegas. The view is brilliant from the corner window tables, very romantic. Some days there is a violinist strolling around playing requests. Try the calamari and Maggiano's salad to begin with, stuffed mushrooms aren't bad either. Traditional fare is great, lasagna and angel hair pasta with Arrabiata sauce. Finish with tiramisu and a moscato, delicious."

Service was excellent.  The portions were very large for the price -- the full size pastas came in 8\"-9\" casserole dishes and about 3\" deep.  Everyone at the table was satisfied with their dishes (fettuccine alfredo, baked ziti and sausage, some type of seafood pasta -- it was on the Little Italy Favorites menu).  I ordered the eggplant parmesan which I wasn't too fond of.  I found it to be too breaded and mushy, not what I'm used to.  Otherwise, great atmosphere, great prices.  There was even a wedding party at the table next to ours!"

Although, this spot is in a mall, I really wouldn't have pegged Maggiano's as a chain restaurant. The restaurant is spacious and comforting.\n\nThe food was pretty good as well. I went with the veal piccata and tried some baked ziti and four cheese ravioli. The veal was not as tender as I would of liked it to be but it was still nicely prepared and the sauce was right on. The pastas were tasty, especially the ravioli. A bottle of wine completed our meal.\n\nAfter lunch, my buddies and I went to the bar for some blue label whiskey, which I've tried one other time before I really had a decent palette for whiskey. All, I have to say is wow!! It was so much better the second time around.\n\nThe bill for the whiskey was another wow!! Our bartender sheepishly placed our bill on the table. 42 bucks a piece... Damn, I was thinking maybe $20... The bartender was nice enough to pore us the rest of the bottle though! Vegas baby!\n\nI did feel bad for my buddy who was not a whiskey drinker at all. He ended up asking for a coke, which he ended up mixing the whiskey with. Oh wow..."

My husband decided to take an earlier trip to \"taste test the food and see the space\"... as well as golf.

The atmosphere is so beautiful and romantic.  The food and service was absolutely amazing. The menu options are by far the best value money can buy in Vegas.  You definitely will not go away hungry.  We still get compliments from my guests and we can guarantee they will all be eating at Maggiano's on their next visit to Vegas!\n\nIf you are considering Maggiano's Little Italy as your venue of choice, you won't go wrong!  We do, without hesitation, recommend to everyone we talk to, to have a meal at Maggiano's.  It is perfect for parties of all sizes and you will definitely impress your guests.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you! For everything!\n\nSheri & Bill"

This works out better for appetites such as mine, as I can usually help devour whatever is left over.\n\nWe went with the larger set-up of family style meals, which looked to be a good deal. As we awaited our appetizers and salads, an older gentleman stopped by the table with his acoustic guitar to sing some songs, he played three (including happy birthday) and wished our friend another happy birthday before he went to another table. And proceeded to play the same three songs (but with more gusto for them); and to the next table, you guessed it... same three songs. \n\nThe appetizers came out, we opted for the fried mozzarella and zucchini. The mozz was great! Wish there was a little more sauce on the plates or some ranch. The fried zucchini came with what looked like ranch, so it all worked out. Nope, that is a lemon sauce that masquerades as ranch. When asked for a side of ranch, we were rebuffed with a, \"We don't carry ranch here.\" OK then.\n\nOur main courses began to roll out, this time our table became filled with lasagna, ravioli, alfredo and a go-to Italian dish: chicken parmagiana.\n\nWhere to begin? The lasagna had a very pre-made/frozen taste to it, however, Stouffer's tastes more authentic than Maggiano's. Their iteration of chicken parm was ghastly. It seemed like it was cooked in a microwave with its rubbery, tough, dry and flavorless texture.\n\nI did not partake in the ravioli or alfredo until the next day, which is where I messed up. Those two dishes were the best of the four we chose.\n\nDesserts came out and they looked amazing. I, however, don't eat dessert, so I can only go off of the very little that was left to ascertain that it was pretty good.\n\nOnto day 2... I awoke Saturday morning with some serious pain. A mixture of \"I ate too much and now I am starving\" and \"RUN\". After a few trips to eliminate the intestinal pain, I was feeling good again.\n\nThat evening, my wife re-heated the leftovers we were given according to the instructions on the to-go containers. Once more into the breach we went, devouring what was left. The ravioli and alfredo I skipped the night before were really tasty and I wished I had tried them the first night.\n\nSunday morning was a repeat of Saturday morning. Needless to say, I shan't be patronizing Maggiano's again. The service was pretty good, the ambiance was nice. As is usually an issue for restaurants, it was the food that will keep me from going back."

The spaghetti was so overcooked it was mush, the eggplant parmigiana was so dry, the Gnocchi was all mush. Very little of the main courses were eaten. The waitress did feel bad cause she had told us it is fresh cooked to order. Some was removed from our bill. We were of course hungry so we ordered the dessert sampler and they were all delicious and big sized for samples. We would not return to this restaurant for a main course."

When I've already completely decided my meal before I've even been offered a drink, I get a little impatient. That's the only reason I knocked a star off. The food came out within 20 minutes or so after we ordered, and we split chicken piccata, but unfortunately they didn't split it. I don't mind paying a split charge, especially when I specifically request a split.

It was certainly a nice treat for me!\n\nAfter initial introductions and the start of the seminar, food starting coming out of the kitchen.  All served family style which was a bit odd for me because I barely knew the two dozen people in the room!  But ah, not a big deal as long as none of them had herpes or mono...or a cold for that matter.\n\nOur appetizer courses came first:  along with warm French bread (excellent) we had the:\n\n*Tomato Caprese - tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil, topped with olive oil and balsamic glaze\n\n*Mozzarella Marinara - breaded mozzarella with marinara sauce\n\n*Maggiano's Salad - Iceberg and romaine lettuce with bleu cheese, crispy prosciutoo, red onions, topped with their signature dressing\n\nPretty good start!  The salad was crisp, but my fav was the Tomato Caprese, sweet and ripe tomatoes with the silky cheese and the acidic touch from the balsamic?  Very nice!  I didn't try the Mozzarella Marinara in trying to keep with my P90X diet...damn you I say Tony Horton!\n\nNext up was our main courses:\n\n*Chicken Parmesan - Breaded chicken breasts baked with Provolone cheese and marinara sauce over spaghetti\n\n*Our Famous Rigatoni 'D' - Rigatoni with herb-roasted chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions with a Marsala cream sauce\n\n*Mom's Lasagna-Meat Sauce - Pasta layered with Ricotta cheese, meatballs, Italian sausage, and marinara sauce, topped with Provolone cheese and meat sauce\n\nNice!  All were good.  Unfortunately, I ate like a banshee here...I dug the Chicken Parmesan and Mom's Lasagna very much!  The sauce was great, not too sweet, not too tart, and complemented the dishes very well.  Oh my thighs...the horror!!!\n\nAfter the business presentation dessert was brought out:\n\n*Apple Crostada - Granny Smith apples baked in a pastry crust topped with crystallized sugar, topped with caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream\n\n*Chocolate Zuccotto Cake - Chocolate cake layered with sambuca chocolate mousse, iced with chocolate frosting, then dusted with cocoa powder\n\nAt this point I was too full to have any more!  But I gave in and had a bit of the Apple Crostada.  Yummy to my tummy!  The tart apples went well with the sweet sugar crust.  Good way to end the meal.  Bad way to end my diet!\n\nFood here is great for a chain restaurant.  The ambiance is nice, dark woods and colors.  It would be very nice for a date night out.  I may just come back here again and actually shell out my Visa to try more of their dishes.  As a note though, I did look through the menu and see a lot of their dishes are on the pricey side.  But, one dish could probably feed two people easily. \n\nThankful for my one day reprieve...I am back to my P90X diet and the ramblings of the Devil's Spawn named Tony Horton.  One more push up or pull up and I think I'm gonna be sick!"

Having never been before... a window of opportunity would present it's self to give it a shot.  The GF had a gift card, we had the time and reservations were made.\n\nWe arrived at the Fashion Show Mall and parked half way from the north forty.  We made our way around the outside of the mall and entered.  \n\nVery nice atmo and servers in white shirts.  We had a window table.  Sounds fancy....but it was not.  We gazed out on the promenade outside and watched people loiter and or pass by.\n\nService was initially slow, and pretty much stayed that way through the entire meal.  I had a drink run empty and was not addressed until 15-20 minutes after.\n\nI ordered up the Chicken Piccata.  It looked delicious on the menu.  The GF ordered up Chef KB's Lobster Carbonara.\n\nWe chowed down on bread prior to plate touchdown.  If they don't bring the balsamic, be sure to ask for it.\n\nWhen the plates arrived, I surveyed the contents.  It all looked good enough.  Dipping into the two plates with my fork.....something seemed off.  It seemed almost sort of commonplace.  \n\nMy eyes and my knowledge of the location told me I was at someplace that was supposed to be special.   My tastebuds were telling me I have been here many times before.  I could not really put my finger on it.  That was until I noticed the gift card the GF was partially paying with.  On the back of the card, were familiar corporate foodie locations I was well aware of.  \n\nPutting it all together, Maggiano's taste reminded my of other chains.  Putting it all together, I can check this off the list."

The wine is good food is fantastic but it took our server 13 minutes to greet my girlfriend and I I requested a table by the window of Las Vehas Blvd since its Valentine's Day and I get sat in the back of the restaurant.... And yes I did request to be sat there on my reservations. Service could use some work. Also took my server about 15 minutes to just bring our drinks and the bread was cold... Other experience's were great but not this one... Also waited on our food for 30 minutes and other people who got here after us were getting their food before us."

            "review": "Not a big fan of chain restaurants usually but this is great. Beautifully decorated with lots of dark woods and smells like my friend's Italian Grandma's kitchen. I was in heaven the moment I stepped inside. Table wasn't ready as we were a little early so got a drink at the bar, the specialty cocktailes we're delicous. Went with a party of 13. They sat us in the \"wine\" room so we were all by ourselves, which was great as we didn't have to compete with the entire restaurant noise level, just ours. Since we had a large party we went with the \"Family style\" dining option. Went for the middle level (classic) choice of 3 appetizers/salad, 4 entrees and 2 desserts. Lots of choices so had to come up with an organized way to get 13 people to agree. Once we figure that out it was on. Chopped salad, fried mozerella and stuffed mushrooms to start. Brought three platters of each which was more than enough but, did I mentione, this is also all you can eat! So never a worry there wouldn't be enough to go around. On to the main course (and timing was perfect, staggered but not too slow). Breaded Tilapia, chicken marsala, Lasagna and linguine with white clam sauce. All were super flavorful and again we ahd more than enough on the first serving, no need for a second order. Dessert was delish as well, (profiteroles and an apple tart) although I could only fit a bite of each aftert all that good food.  Highly reccomend especialyl for a large party."

Ordered the margherita pizza for an appetizer and for my main course I had the spinach and chicken manicotti.  Fortunately, I also got to try the linguine di mare and the chicken parmesan that my party ordered.  They were all delicious but the manicotti has to be my favorite.  \n\nThis is a very inexpensive restaurant with generous portions, so it's definitely worth the try after a long day of shopping.  Be sure to call in advance otherwise you'd be waiting as long as an hour and a half to be seated.  Ask for a table next to the window with view of LVBlvd, not one of the best, but still a pretty sight for you out of towners."

The food was fresh the calamari was tender the salad was crunchy and crispy and the flavors were delectable. I spoke with one manager briefly I believe his name was Jesse he made sure I was well taken care of and was enjoying myself, another young lady who is a manager and very beautiful also make sure I was well taken care of I want to say her name was Christmas? She had dark reddish brown hair with bangs and she was tall and stunning but very professional if only I could of have the courage to ask her for her phone number. Stephanie is a great bartender and made a wicked delicious sangria it's always good when you can't taste the alcohol in your drink that means it's really good! I will definitely be back and hopefully I'll run into Christmas and Stephanie, those ladies are awesome and easy on the eyes to."

The tables were very close together and people kept squeezing by our table which truly annoyed me. For that reason i had to remove one star. However everything else was superb! I had the lobster ravioli which was delicious. In fact I'm making myself hungry just thinking about it! I also had a Caramel apple martini which was delicious! I had to get another.

Him and I were watching the Seahawks vs. 49ers game at the hotel, came here at half time, and were able to get the perfect seat to watch the rest of the game. \n\nI'm not sure if the waitress was training someone new or if the other person that helped was just the bus girl but she was more attentive than the waitress. If just the waitress helped us, I would have said the service is lacking, but since the other lady was there to fill up our drink and bring us menus and take our plates away, I would say it was between average and good. \n\nThe food was great. I had the mushroom ravioli. The sauce was delicious. My husband tried it also and thought it was really good. My husband had the lasagna. He thought it was good. The sauce was a little sweeter than I like but it was good. \n\nOverall this is a good restaurant. Good place to stop for a good meal. The prices were reasonable. Check one of Las Vegas's tour books.

The outdoor patio is fantastic and as there's few places on the strip where you can eat outdoors, this is a great option for dining al fresco. Service is good, but it can take a while for your food to arrive.\n\nOne of the reasons I chose this place is that they will prepare your dish gluten free on request, if you ask. They also can substitute regular pasta with gluten free pasta.\n\nGood selection of wines by the glass, but it's rather expensive. $16 a glass is out of my league. However, they do have a happy hour from 3pm to 6pm Mon-Fri with a selection of beer, wines and cocktails for $6 or less.\n\nMore on gluten free in Las Vegas:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/gluten.free.las.vegas/"

Of course, we can't possibly eat there all the time, so during our last Las Vegas trip we also tried Maggiano's Little Italy. I understand this is a national chain (one which I wasn't aware of at all up until now), but if you didn't know that you would assume this was a single independently owned restaurant. The atmosphere is very nice, but not pretentious. Service was rapid and very personable. Like many Italian restaurants, especially on the strip in Vegas, this place is fairly expensive, but if you do not go crazy on drinks and appetizers there are several reasonably priced entrees on the menu. Our bill with tip was under $35, which is very reasonable for the large portions we received, as well as the quality of food and service we experienced. We experienced no real negatives, and the view outside of the Vegas strip while we were dining indoors was spectacular. They also have outdoor seating, though it is limited in the number of available tables. One minor complaint is that they could turn down the air conditioning a notch, but that is a common complaint anywhere indoors in Vegas, not limited solely to this restaurant. We've experienced much colder air conditioning elsewhere in Vegas. They also did not serve butter with there bread, but brought us some butter promptly when we asked for it. Their to-go boxes are of high quality and very usable aluminum. Portion sizes were large enough for us to have leftovers we ended up taking with us on our flight back home. My daughter ended up eating that, and she was very impressed - even though the food had just been reheated in a microwave, instead of more properly in an oven. For the price, this is a well located and enjoyable Italian restaurant. It is well worth checking out in comparison to some of the more outrageously priced (for Arab sheiks?) Italian restaurants on the strip."

Unfortunately no locations in Canada (where I'm from) yet! This Maggianos is located in the Fashion show mall next to Wynn and Encore Hotels. \n\nMaggiano's isn't exactly fine-dining, but it does have a pretty nice ambiance for a family style restaurant. It has full panoramic glass windows around the perimeter of the dining room, showcasing an awesome view of the Wynn hotel and that part of the strip. While we were there, two violinists went around the restaurant playing songs for each table. And to top it off, our server was so kind and helpful!\n\nThe menu here is also pretty interesting and worth a mention. Along side the regular a la cart menu, they also have a \"family style\" menu. Basically you choose several items from a predetermined set, and for a fixed price per pereson, you can order as much of any item you want! Its kind of like \"all-you-can-eat\" but for only the few items you choose. We ended up going for this option and ordered the light family dinner that comes with bottomless portions for 2 appetizers, 2 salads, and 2 pastas.\n\nMaggiano's Salad : \nThis salad is literally the best salad I've ever had! The signature house dressing was a spicy-sweet vinaigrette, and paired with the crunchy prosciutto bits, I could NOT for the life of me stop eating this!\n\nCrispy Zucchini Fritte : \nThe waiter said this was their most popular appetizer, and I can see why. The zucchinis are deep fried in a crumbly crunchy batter, and were irresistible with the cool ranch dip\n\nLinguine and Clams with White Clam Sauce: \nI did not like this at all. The sauce was runny, and tasted like fishy sea water. It was way too salty.\n\nOur Famous Rigatoni 'D' \u00ae :\n guess they don't call it \"Famous\" for nothing, this pasta is really really good! The pasta is cooked perfectly al dente, and is served with lots of mushrooms and creamy Marsala sauce. \n\nFor a chain, this place really isn't bad! You'll leave for the most part happy and full :)"

We knew that it was our own fault for running a little behind, but when Nicole found out that we were on a time limit, she made sure that they had everything out for us in a timely manner without us having to ask her. We were not expecting that at all. She gave us suggestions on what to order and what not to order since certain items take longer to make. She kept checking up on us and our waters were always filled. Portions are big (family style is an option as well) so we ended up ordering an appetizer, one pasta dish, and then dessert. Soooo good! We will be back"

Calamari is really yummy, not overly breaded or chewy. Lunch menu has a good chicken parm sandwich. Salads are good, fresh and deliccious dressings... Now the hot bread they serve....... I could eat this bread all night with their cheese and balsamic.  It's good they bring it out in small 4-5 rolls because I would have rolls for days...... on my thighs..... I do wish there was a location off the strip in summerlin somewhere.... weekend wait times are terrible, so get a reservation. The fried zucchini is one of the best I've ever had with ranch BUT it's just too big to share between two people. Eat here. Just do it. Oh and they usually have a musician walking around asking if you want them to play something if your into that sort of stuff."

One family party of 4 (2 Adults, 1 kid 7 yrs and 1 (2 yrs old)) arrived at 8.32 PM. They went to the host and asked for the reservation which was under his name (me). The hostess was reluctant to have them seated after requesting 2-3 times stating that they will make everyone seated once all the parties will arrive. What kind of customer service is this? Finally getting impatient as 2 yrs old was cranky i had raise my voice and asked for the manager. Then finally at 8.50 PM they got us seated - my friends family arrived 5 mins later. This in appropriate for a business like Maggiano's - the host should have been trained on the behavior on how to interact with the customer. I wouldn't recommend Maggiano's Las Vegas due to its poor customer service in dealing with people specially families with Kids. Thereafter the service was phenomenal - waitress were nice - Food was great too. But initial experience was pathetic....."

(They do allow for you to take things home but they've become quite strict on finishing the first plate first).  \n\nThey do have gluten-free penne pasta so I was able to eat that.  \n\nWe ordered the caesar salad, calamari, clams and linguine, gluten free baked ziti, tiramisu, and the double fudge brownie.\n\nThe salad was a huge let down - the lettuce was super soggy.\nThe calamari was awesome, light batter and fried to perfection.\nEveryone who had the clams said the first dish was too salty and the second dish that came out was way better.\nThe baked ziti had sausage in it and I usually love sausage but I didn't care for theres.  \nThe tiramisu was delicious and the brownie dish came with ice cream and strawberries.  My nephew and I had the strawberries while everyone else ate the super chocolatey brownie.\n\nIt was nice to get together with family and eat a buffet without having to get up.  Our server was nice but could have came around just a tab bit more."

As my husband and I had been once before in St. Louis and enjoyed it, we hoped to have the time to try it again. It also turns out that I had some rewards points that could be turned into a gift card here, which presented the perfect opportunity. \n\nLet me first say, the hostess, manager, and our waiter especially were awesome! Professional, efficient, and very friendly. They seemed to be having a great time, which is always a good sign.\n\nThe food was also excellent. Between the three of us, we tried the lasagna (with marinara), lasagna (with meat sauce), and the Gnocchi & Italian Sausage dish. All were wonderful. \n\nAlso while dining, there were two musicians that came around and asked if you would like them to play the table a song - which similarly happens in Italy. Very charming."

And, in the case of Maggiano's, they're consistently good, for the most part, and a good value.\n\nMy wife had a gift card to their family of restaurants, which included Chili's and Macaroni Grill. Naturally, we chose the best of the lot -- Maggiano's. Located in Fashion Show mall, it's a pain to find the entrance. Walking through the mall, you have to actually walk outside of the mall towards the Strip and head to the second level via the outdoor escalators to find the main entrance.\n\nThis was a family outing for us -- our three year old son in tow -- so we were happy to be seated at a booth. They've got a kid's menu with the usual stuff (pizza, chicken fingers, mac-n-cheese, etc). For $5.95 kids get an entree, beverage, and a dessert (lemon cookies or vanilla ice cream). My kid opted for the pizza. It's a long, rectangular, crispy cheese flatbread pizza cut into triangles. Tasty and large enough for two kids to share.\n\nThe lasagna was the best item of the night. A huge brick shape filled with crumbled meatballs and Italian sausage and covered in meat sauce. The gnocchi also came in a large portion, good enough for two people. While it was a little too dense, it was a passable version of the dish that came with spicy Italian sausage and a creamy (oversauced) vodka sauce.\n\nThey have small dessert options for $2.95. The chocolate cake was decent. A little too cold and firm, but it hit the spot. We also opted for the lemoncello pie ($7) -- essentially a circular key lime pie with cherries garnishing the plate and topped with whipped cream and almond slivers.\n\nWhile not the best Italian food in the city, Maggiano's does make for a good family restaurant at a decent price, considering its location.\n\n3.5 Stars"

The menu we choose was a family style 3-course meal with appetizers.  Since we had some older people attending the family style service was great.  It was all you can eat, but they served everything at the tables so no buffet type of lines.  Everything was done through email and a few phone calls and it was done.  Cassie, the second in charge for catering was extremely helpful.\n\nShop around, but the food is second to none and the service staff during the reception were very professional and friendly.

We ordered the mozzarella appetizer, which was delicious.  Husband has his green salad and of course the fresh bread with oil and balsamic vinegar is a huge hit!   An affordable bottle of wine to share and for entrees, my fish loving husband actually ordered the beef tips!

I got the 4 cheese ravioli and although there are only about 7 ravioli on the plate they are HUGE yet oh so delicious and fresh out of the oven that the plate was still burning hot.  desert was amazing, I got the new york style cheesecake and while it was small because I was doing a prom promo it was still amazing, it wasn't as dense as a normal cheesecake would be and with our stomachs full from the main dish that was perfect."

The delicious food here will restore your apetite from whatever came back out from the previous night.  The family style is a great way to enjoy the meal.  They provide a lot of food for their prices.\n\nWe started with the potato soup which relly jump started my apetite.  It's rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Next up was the Beef Braciole.  This dish was quite interesting.  The texture was weird yet it was edible (may have been my hangover dulling my senses).  I can't quite remember the name of the next dish, but it was a spicy spaghetti and meat balls, I believe.  The spiciness brought back all my senses and pretty much kicked me out of my intoxicated state.  You can never go wrong with spaghetti and meatballs.  We also had the Rigatoni \"D\".  The chicken was tender and the protein gave me energy for more partying.  \n\nThey gave us enough food to take back to the hotel and have for dinner.  If you love Italian food and pastas, this place would be a place to stop by."

I finished my dinner in about 5 minutes. (could have been 2 but I was eating slow) I asked the waitress about my order and she said that was a 1/2 order and about 10 minutes later they brought me some more ravioli. Well not much more. 5 more to be exact. \n\n So my advice to you is to only order family style here with a group of people and avoid coming with any less than 4 folks. You just won't get the same bang for your buck. \n\n Nice wine list and there were a few banquet rooms / wine cellar rooms that the dining seemed to be really nice in. \n\n There's a much bigger restaurant right above this one that I am gonna have to try out because it really looked nice."

Server was nice,  but definitely seemed rushed. \n\nComplimentary bread and butter / olive oil, which was probably the best part of dinner. \nGot the crab cakes appetizer, which was tasty.  I ordered the beef tenderloin medallions and husband got chicken marsala. My entree was tender and cooked to perfection, and tasted good at first,  if a little monotonous. \n\nHusband's (birthday boy) entree was a total failure. He asked to substitute the standard spaghetti aglio olio with spaghetti meat sauce,  which didn't happen. The chicken was as tough as shoe leather, the sauce didn't taste at all of marsala wine,  and the mushrooms had hardly any evidence of being cooked.\n\nConsidering we were here for his birthday,  it was pretty disappointing. Still, service was nice enough, and location, and cleanliness can't be faulted."

Even though it's an outpost of a chain, they do a pretty good job with the food.  The veal Marsala was a generous portion and was excellently prepared.  Pastas were really good and filling.  Service was friendly and competent.  The restaurant was buzzing and filled with diners, which is always a good indicator.  A meal here will cost you much less than at a budget buster celebrity chef restaurant and the experience will be almost as good.  I'm looking forward to going back."

We were seated right away even though we ended up 30 min early for our reservation. I had the linguine with clams in the white wine sauce and my boyfriend had the scrimp scampi. His was amazing and they give you about 20 shrimp! Mine was good but I think the red sauce is probably better. It was a little bland so a lot of parmesan helped :) \n\nGet the dessert sampler! It's delicious! Tiramisu, apple crostada, and the cheesecake were the best. The chocolate cake was really not great and kind of dry, and our creme brulee was runny and undercooked. \n\nOverall good prices and good portions! $73 for 2 entrees, a dessert, and a bottle of wine.

Their Chef's are very cautious when it comes to food allergies, and they go out of their way to accommodate nearly any request. They have even made me gluten free fried zucchini that is sure to compete with their original recipe.\n\nTheir portions are quite large and reasonably priced, making it the ideal location for large groups. They also have private dining rooms if celebrating a more intimate occasion or hosting a business meeting. Overall, an excellent choice no matter what the occasion. They do get really busy with conventions, etc. so make a reservation in advance. I can assure you that you will be happy with your experience."

I suffered from major heartburn from this later.\n\nC) Salads - Only have one dressing and wouldn't take other request or have other dressings.\n\nD) Lasagna - Too much oil and grease, also contributed to the heartburn.  Also contained too many onions.\n\nOverall, I don't think I will be back.  I'll stick to Olive Garden or a place that can serve true Italian food.  Was not happy about the service nor the food.

We had 3 tables that seated about 10-12 people. There was plenty of room for a display table as well. And there was also an adjacent balcony with a view of the strip & Encore. They had a specially tailored menu with their names on it as well as at the door upon entering the room (we had to correct them on the spelling when we arrived & they corrected it before the families arrived). Overall the service and the experience was a positive one. I think it's safe to say the guests & celebrants enjoyed their time at Maggiano's. I'd advise you to valet outside because the elevator by valet takes you right up to restaurant. My friend that lives in town gave me that nugget of information. So convenient...\n\nNow on to the menu: First course was stuffed mushrooms, calamari & italian salad. The stuffed mushrooms were good. They were big mushrooms and it was stuffed with spinach and bread crumbs. They were served in a white wine sauce. You cant go wrong with calamari and their version didn't disappoint. Fresh tasting pieces of breaded squid accompanied with marinara sauce for dipping. Just squeeze some lemon over the calamari and you're golden. The italian salad was surprisingly delicious. Salad had arugula, lettuce, pepperoncinis & croutons in italian dressing. Good appetizers. I enjoyed every single one of them. \n\nSecond course consisted of meat lasagna, rustic chicken & shrimp and chicken marsala. I loved the meat lasagna. But really, what's not to love? It's lasagna! And it was classically delicious. They don't call it \"Mom's meat lasagna with meat sauce\" for nothing. Crumbled meatballs & sausage with ricotta cheese. Boom! I didnt have the rustic chicken & shrimp but my friend's seemed to like it. The chicken marsala was so very good. White meat chicken that was so moist and tasty. It was the perfect chicken dish. I loved it the most... And that's saying a lot given that lasagna was on the menu. Order it. Trust me.\n\nFor dessert, we had 2 offerings. Chocolate zucotto cake & Nonna's toasted pound cake. All I had was the toasted pound cake & that's all I needed. It was so damn good. Crispy edges on the pound cake topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, slivers of chocolate and served along side caramelized bananas. Game over. I dont have to tell you how good it was. You already know. \n\nYou're welcome..."

She took my phone number down and said the system would shoot me a text once they're ready. So my bf & I went to go find somewhere to sit & came back 30 mins later since that's what I had anticipated. It was 8:15 & this man started to get agitated with the women on the host stand because he checked in at 7:45 he says... so the lady just told him to stand by the light & someone will come get him. & obviouslyyyy, I'm standing here like... excuse me? I checked in 15 mins before you did & you get to be seated first????? Ok. We were seated at 8:20 - so 50 min wait. I don't mind waiting but I wish they told us it would be longer, yaknow? Anyways, that's why im giving 4 stars & not 5 lol. \n\nI ordered the lobster carbonara. It was delicious! I wish they put broccoli instead of the peas but the peas were crisp & it was great! There wasn't a lotttt of lobster on there but it was a good amount. My bf had the Tuscan shrimp & chicken. It was pretty amazing too. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate zuccotto cake? I think that's what it's called. Lol all the portions were huge! Definitely took about half of it to go. \n\nOur server was also great. She definitely made our dining experience amazing."

Also, decor and space is fine-- clean and open, what you expect from an upscale chain. \n\nThe bad part: the salads we ordered looked like a pre-made salad that you can buy in a bag at the supermarket. The first time it came out there were wilted pieces and they forgot to add the chicken. They were very apologetic and brought out new salads. This time they came out without wilted leaves, but still the produce was as dry and brittle as the first time. The chicken was also overcooked, dry. Maybe I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't a $13 salad. I didn't expect anything fancy, but I do want carefully prepared and fresh food. \n\nWe then wondered if maybe it wasn't the fault of the restaurant, but of their food suppliers--the cost of being a chain restaurant. But then we went across to the street to the Wynn and had a delicious, vibrant, salad. \n\nSo though I appreciate Maggiano's eager and friendly service and pleasant decor, I think they would do better to focus on the quality of their food."

Love the Chef K Lobster carbonara , chicken parm, Lasgana, bruschetta, tomato soup, and chocolate cake! Also have requested a broccoli, chicken, and garlic pasta. Wonderful!! Big portions.

Minuses: Even though we had reservations, it still took 20 mins before we were actually seated and we had to wait in two different fusterclucked lines - people were bumping into each other and unsure where to stand or go (numerous signs for the \"Host Stand\" were borderline comical, giving an Alice gone through the looking glass experience - but with annoyed tourists); we asked the seater to speak to management (we were there for family celebration,and the evening wasn't feeling terribly \"special\" with this first impression), who didn't appear until 50 mins later (that's because she never bothered to contact himl) - the manager was extremely defensive, admittedly he was probably slightly broadsided by our complaints but still seemed barely receptive to the criticisms and made repeated excuses about \"the layout of the restaurant\" and told us we should've came in via the revolving doors that we almost got whacked with twice because \"most of our traffic comes off the Strip\" (we'd already explained we were locals, apparently we shouldn't come in where the valet is). All in all, we'd have been better off going to a nice local joint like Chicago Joe's - this place was basically a fancier version of the Macaroni Grill."

We went in planning on having a romantic dinner for our anniversary and instead it's like we walked into a big family dinner party. And it maybe fun for some I found it a bit overwhelming. Soon as we walked in we had to walk through the dining room maze and to the middle of the crowded restaurant which is expected at 630pm Saturday night. But it was the layout that just crams everyone together. Unless you're in a booth it's pretty much like you're eating with the other tables next to you. It was so loud that I had to shout over to have a conversation with my hubby. It wasn't loud music it was just having so many people in one room talking, even the guy who serenaded us with a guitar I could barely hear and he was right in front of me.\n   As for the food, awesome! I got the lobster carbonara and it was delish. Lots of lobster, cream sauce was tasty and huge portion, only complaint is a little too much Parmesan cheese that it kinda hides the flavor of the sweet lobster. Hubby had chicken Alfredo and loved it but couldn't finish it (rarely happens). Got the sampler for dessert and it's must if you can't decide on one thing. \n  Overall not a bad place for good Italian food with family & friends but definitely don't recommend for romantic dates."

I ordered the \"Parmesan Crusted Tilapia\", which included mushy and obviously frozen fish and a bed of watery and bland spinach (3 leaves total) and orzo pasta. All off this was doused in an excess of capers and way too finely chopped cheap tomatoes. \n\nHowever, taste and presentation aside, and once all scraped off, the fish had a terribly sour after taste. Upon bringing it up to the waiter, it was blamed on the capers (great endorsement of the kitchen & recipes). However after I left, my stomach was ill the entire night and into the next day. Sparing the intimate detail of my night spent with the toilet, the summary of this meal is that the fish was frozen and once defrosted it was obviously left out beyond expiration, and then cooked and presented with the effort of a 1st grader. \n\nAt this point I'd rather go vomit again than ever visit this establishment again. As an Italian and really as a human who eats food, I'm insulted at what this place is dishing out. \n\nSpend an extra $5 a dish and go to D.O.C.G. in The Cosmopolitan instead for real Italian food."

We showed up without notice, and they were still able to get a table for us in about half an hour or so. The table ordered off the family style menu where you can only pick two of each course, but can have as much of those courses as you want until you're ready for the next one. We ordered calamari, caesar salad, another type of salad (I think it was the Maggiano's), tomato with mozarella, chicken parmesan, lasagna, spaghetti with marinara sauce, salmon, tiramisu, and cheesecake. The salads were decent - crisp, and tangy. The mozarella that came with the tomato was not very smooth and a little too 'pizza mozarella' tasting for me. The spaghetti with marinara sauce was my personal favorite, along with some of the other people at the table. It was light, and the spaghetti was cooked to just the right tenderness. The lasagna was very salty and the meat chunky in an unpleasant, crumbly way. It wasn't chewy, cheesy, and meshing with the lasagna layers. \n\nThe cheesecake was really delicious, came with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Mm!\n\nThe service was a little slow and sometimes unmindful of us, but it was fairly busy in the restaurant, so I can understand.\n\nI'd come here for a decent large group setting with fairly cheap eats, but I wouldn't come here for a date or a small intimate group meal."

            "review": "This was yet another visit to Maggiano's on our nephew's birthday for a pleasing authentic Italian dinner.  This time the repast was more colorful than usual, with an entree of Lobster Carbonara accented by reds and greens, and a green-flecked Chicken Piccata punctuated by capers and a light Lemon Sauce.  As usual, entree portions were large, with ample portions of Veal Parmesan bathed in white Alfredo Sauce, and my sizable medallions of Veal Marsala covered in sweet dark brown Marsala Sauce and topped by uncharacteristic but chompingly enjoyable Button Mushrooms.  But I get ahead of myself!\n\nOur meal began with two fine starters: tender rings and tentacles of golden brown Calamari Fritti served with a classic Marinara Sauce and specially prepared Lemon Aioli for dipping, along with large rectangles of thick and cheesy Mozzarella Marinara.  A side Caesar with creamy Caesar Dressing and several croutons was a nice bridge to the aforementioned mains.  And we finished with an assortment of unexpected complimentary birthday desserts, including tasty Tiramisu and Italian half-moon cookies.  Service was spot on this time, and the view of Wynn just across the street from our faux-leather booth added some Vegas pizzazz to the comfy red-&- white-checked tableclothed and family celebratory ambiance of this old school Italian ristorante. \n\nThis time service was spot on!"

However, this review will be on my recent visit, just a couple days ago.\n\nMe and my boyfriend decided to go for lunch here to celebrate on him getting a potential new job.  In the beginning, everything was fine.  We ordered our appetizers and... that was it?  He didn't ask if we'd like an entree after taking down our appetizers.  So, we waited for our server to come back and ask if we'd like to order an entree.  After he gave us our appetizer and even finished it, all we saw  him do was helping every other customers but us.  Did he have something against us because we \"look\" 16 years old and can't afford an entree???  After about 20-30 minutes of waiting, we asked another server to ask him if he can take down our entree we've been waiting for.  He comes over and he goes, \"Okay go ahead.\"  He didn't apologize for making us wait.  REALLY??  Wow.  I'm appalled by his performance.  And after we got our entree, he only came over to us twice, third time being check, and we never saw him again.\n\nThe saving grace to our experience was the food.  Our appetizers were the Zucchini Fritte and Stuffed Mushrooms.  I loved how crunchy the zucchini was and the soupy base for the mushroom was great!  Our entrees were the Rigatoni D and Chicken Parmesan.  He enjoyed his parmesan very much and the rigatoni was very fulfilling and the cream sauce complimented the whole dish so well!  The little mushrooms in it was too cute to eat!\n\nWe're always going to come back here.  Just not have that older server again."

EPIC FAIL LAST NIGHT!\n\n\nOK, so last night (10/2/13) we returned to Maggiano's Little Italy restaurant in the Fashion Show Center, on the Vegas strip, expecting our usual fine dining experience.  But things went badly awry.  \n\nHere's how our evening went:\n* 5:00 -  check in and immediately get seated in a nice booth with a view of the Strip.  So far, so good.\n* 5:15 -  finally get some water.  Hmmm.\n* 5:25 -  finally asked what we wanted to drink.  As we already had plenty of time to ponder, we immediately gave our entire order.\n* 5:40 -  bread and olive oil arrive.\n* 5:55 -  bruschetta and salad finally arrive.  Really, 30 minutes for bruschetta and a house salad?\n* 6:25 -  entr\u00e9es finally arrive.  No special requests, mind you, just the house special.  WTH!\n* 6:35 -  we ask for our bill and some take-home containers, so we can head out to our show.\n* 6:50 -  we sign our bill and head out, thank heavens.\n\nHow about the food?  Salad dressing contained some new, hotter peppers than previously.  Wife took a few bites and quit.  Bruschetta was good.\n\nEntr\u00e9es were very disappointing.  We had our usual Rigatoni \"D\", a house specialty, which is usually excellent.  Not so, last night.  The sauce was so watered down that it wouldn't adhere to any of the rigatoni, mushrooms or chicken.  We had to dunk our bread into it to get any, or it just dripped off like water.  \n\nMy wife plans to \"doctor\" the sauce a bit to make it workable, and we'll try the leftovers tonight.  Hope she can fix it.\n\nLast night Maggiano's failed badly.  Never had that happen at Gaetano's ... ever.  Guess where we're going from now on.\n\nDean Herrington"

This restaurant certainly does this and more...especially the part where the dinner tab sticker shock comes into play.  You won't get that here.\n\nNoel our server was money!  With a sense of urgency he made my petite, red headed passion flower and I aware the Happy Hour was in full swing for just a short period of time.  With this very subtle hint we ordered the Coppla Rosso and Chardonnay by the glass.  These wines complimented our meals very nicely.   I ordered the Rigatoni  D.  This came with pasta, herb-roasted chicken, mushrooms and caramelized onions, tossed in a Marsala cream sauce.  Very generous portion.  Awesome!  My PRHPF ordered the Baked Ziti and pronounced it to be very good!  For what we had in mind for an Italian dinner this exceeded our expectations.\n\nFor desert we kept it pretty low key..Italian lemon cookies were perfect.  There was no way we were gonna be able to enjoy desert properly as we were stuffed.\n\nThis very nice wedding anniversary dinner was over the top because our server Noel was polished and engaging at every moment.  Easy to talk to and a keen sense of humor, we couldn't help but like this guy.  He truly made this a 5 star moment for us.  I can't wait to take my Best Girl to our local Maggiano's!"

I really regret not taking pictures of our food but I was enjoying it so much that I was too busy stuffing my face and didn't think to pull out the camera. \n\nI'm a total soup girl, so after hearing the day's selection of soups, I decided on a cup of roasted mushroom soup. When it arrived my jaw dropped. I asked for a cup (or small ...whatever) and it arrived in a huge bowl!! The portions were huge! I even waited and double checked with our server that they didn't make a mistake and give me the bigger size bowl of soup and she said \"nope, that's the small one\". Well, the soup was delicious. It was full of mushrooms in a cream base and was sooooo yummyyy!!!  My mom ordered the \"small\" Spinach Salad and that was delicious as well. Never had roasted red peppers in a spinach salad and it surprisingly gave great flavor with the smoked bacon, crumbled gorgonzola, sweet onions and toasted pine nuts. We would have been just fine with our soup and salad but little did we know that the portions were going to be so huge!\n\nOkay, entree time...we both went with sandwhiches. I had the Jumbo Lump Crabcake Sandwhich (via their menu on the website...\"Crab cake on a brioche bun with arugula, tomato and crispy onion strings and mustard mayonnaise. Served with parmesan chips\") and my mom had the Seared Salmon Sandwhich (which is not listed on the menu online for some odd reason). THOSE WERE THE 2 BEST DAMN SANDWHICHES I'VE EVER HAD!!!! OMGGGG!! Sooo yummyyyy!!! I think it's funny that we were at an Italian restaurant and didn't have pasta but I am so glad at our choices because the food was soooo delicious!\n\nWe were so stuffed from our soup and salad that we each only ate half of our sandwhiches and went back to our hotel room with our leftovers, happily! LOL! We were very happy with our lunch from Maggiano's and will be making it a regular stop on future visits to Vegas.\n\nAlthough I am in the Bay and heard there's a Maggiano's down in San Jose, I rarely head down to the South Bay so I doubt I'll be visiting that one. I highly suggest the location in Las Vegas!! \n\np.s. Excellent service as well! Oh yeah, and it was a lovely day so we opted to dine outside and it was very nice! The weather was perfect!"

Overall a gorgeous window view.\n\nOrdered the veal scaloppine piccata style and an Arnold Palmer. The veal scallopine was flavorful, especially with the pickled capers that had almost a tangy sensation. There was also spinach placed at the bottom of the veal. It was a light bed of spinach and I felt that I could have benefited with a bit more. The dish came with a side of angel hair. As for the drink, it was just your typical Arnold Palmer, half iced tea half lemonade.\n\nOur server seemed really versed with the various menu items and the ingredients. At first I thought it was only our server and his personality that made him a great host, but after listening in another table it seems all the servers are well-trained and sociable. I applaud the servers for their knowledge and service.\n\nOverall it was a good experience, but not a restaurant of choice since it's a chain. When I am in Vegas, I prefer to dine in locations that are exclusive Vegas restaurants. I feel as though that would add to the experience versus eating at a chain that is readily accessible in my hometown."

First, my friends and I made reservations for 7 pm on a Saturday evening 3 days in advance. We get to the restaurant at 6:55pm and the hostess gave  us the pager gadget and says it will be a few minutes. Half an hour later, we still have not been seated yet. I wonder why we  even bothered to make reservations. In my book, you make a reservation for a certain time and when that time comes,  you get seated. that is the point of making a RESERVATION and the basic meaning of the word. This is a big NO NO in my book. That is either poor planning or mismanagement or both. If I am gonna spend some bills in a fancier style restaurant, I expect to be taken care of. that is what I am paying for and have no problem doing so.  The silver lining ,if there is one, is that we weren't the only ones. there were numerous folks there having the same frustrations and issues with this topic and wishing to speak to the manager. Not a good sign. the waitress was nice enough and adequate though. the only issue I had with her is that we got our vinegar and oil for our bread, but guess what, no bread. only after 20 minutes and asking did we receive our bread. again, not what I expect from a  purported higher class establishment. the food was adequate but not what I would call earth shattering. the calamari was tasty and the Rigatoni D was tasty and sauce was good. I have had better and worse.  my friends all liked what they got from what they told me. Overall, mediocre experience at best.One thing I have learned over the years is that  you can tell a lot about a place by the way they keep the bathrooms and I must say that was horrible and maybe the worst I have ever seen except for a few roadside gas stations in my days. It  was an absolute mess with dirty paper towels, water, all over the floor and overall condition to be filthy. again, I hope they don't keep the kitchen like the do the restroom. I don't even want to think about that.  Overall, not a horrible experience but not one for the books either. In my opinion, Carrabas easily matches and super cedes Maggianos overall for a much better eating experience and price. Oh,  Almost forgot, I will give a 4 or 5 on the overall ambiance and feel of the restaurant.  It was a comfortable and luxurious setting, and decorated nicely but unfortunately, the wrapping on the package was much better than the gift inside."

My advice-Beware if you order any beef dish. I ordered the Braised Beef Pappardelle, with garlic mashed potatoes as a side. Waiter didn't tell me that it came over pasta and it only came with a small amount of shredded beef. Or did it? Because I never got the mashed potatoes and the description mentioned nothing about pasta. It had obviously been left under a heat lamp because the plate rim was very hot, the food was only warm, and the sauce had started to congeal. I ate maybe a third of it and the bus boy came by and started clearing the dishes. What am I going to do, complain to him? My daughter ordered the filet with asparagus risoto. A bunch of under cooked asparagus, a reasonable amount of risoto and 3 little slices (2 ounces?) of well done beef (filet?) about the size of your little finger. By the way, she ordered it pink, which after verbally stumbling around we agreed was medium. More signs it sat under a heat lamp?"

When ordering my husband asked if the portions were big (he's got a big appetite) and the waiter said not really. However, the portion is huge!! So, be prepared to eat if you order one of their pasta dishes.  My lunch wasn't so great. I orderd the Crab Cake Sandwich which was salty and soggy. The chips that accompanied were stale and overly salty. I had desperatly wished I had stuck to what they know. . .pasta.  The service was slow and to top it off, I ordered a side salad with my sandwich for an extra $2.25 but they charged us for a normal side salad with out an entree. . .$4.50. Now, Its only $2 and I don't want the hassel of getting it  back, but what if everyone was getting charged incorrectly by the same waiter? No Bueno!  So, I said something and the Manager said he'd take care of it. We waited over 20 minutes for $2 and I was regretting my decision as I munched on the mints in the Host area.  When the Manager re-appeared, he comped our lunch because he made us wait so long!  So, I have to say, I will definately visit the one in Santana Row in San Jose, CA just for that. At least I know to stick to the pasta!"

We were told that we HAD to order off the family style menu even though the menu clearly states that they \"ASK parties of 10 or more to order Family Style.\" There was no mention anywhere that this was required.  After asking if it was possible to order individual entr\u00e9es, the hostess looked at us like we were stupid and asked \"why?\"  I simply stated we all have different tastes and one person in our party had food allergies.  Then what looked like the manager came over and told us that the kitchen could not accommodate a group of ten individual entr\u00e9es and that the only way we could do that is if we split into two groups of five HOWEVER this would make the wait even LONGER.  We were confused because the kitchen would still be making ten orders but whatever.  We were annoyed with them already and decided to leave and check out El Segundo Sol, the Mexican restaurant right below Maggiano's.  Read my review of El Segundo Sol, they definitely took care of us!"

            "review": "So my parents were in town visiting and my dad loves Italian food. We were on the strip and I remembered hearing about this place, so we decided to give it a try. This place definitely has some old world charm, it feels a bit like dining at your nonna's house. In typical strip fashion there were some people in prom style dresses and others in basketball shorts, I love Las Vegas! The place is huge and we were seated in a booth that felt a bit claustrophobic. We tried to maneuver the table a bit, but it was a tight fit even for me, and I am pretty small. Regardless, it was a bustling Saturday night and we were seated within a few minutes and our waiter promptly appeared at our table.\n\nOf course we started with the bread and it was delicious. I always appreciate olive oil and balsamic with a warm and chewy piece of bread. After checking out the portion sizes on other tables, I opted for a Caprese salad, figuring I could scavenge off of everyone else's plates. The slices of tomato and mozzarella were quite large, I like mine to be a bit more dainty, but they actually had great flavor and it hit the spot for me. I usually add salt to my Caprese, but in this case it was perfectly seasoned. My husband ordered the Rigatoni D, which features chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions all tossed in a creamy marsala sauce. It was definitely delicious! I appreciated that the chicken had flavor on its own and each element really brought something to the dish. It was even better reheated the next day! My dad had the baked Ziti and it was also well done. It had a great tomato flavor with a hint of sausage. I stole a little plate and also reheated it the next day for dinner. My mom had the lasagna and it was pretty good. I feel like lasagne is a dish that everyone makes at home and isn't very difficult to make, and they had a pretty standard version. \n\nI was very surprised with how well we ate and even more surprised to learn that this is a chain restaurant. It made my picky dad happy and I would definitely return. It is not the best Italian food in town, but not bad if you're in the mall or on the strip and want a good meal at a decent price."

This was after waiting for at least 5 minutes, standing right in front of the desk, with no one in front of me and the 2 people at the desk didn't even acknowledge that I was there!  We decided to sit in the bar area so we could eat sooner.\n\nWe were worried that with the small number of servers there our service would be slow.  But the service from our waitress was actually the best part of our experience there.  We were able to order relatively quickly (I didn't expect superfast service sitting in the bar) but our food arrived and one order was wrong while another was missing a crucial ingredient.  Our waitress immediately apologized and worked to get it fixed.  She blamed the errors on the kitchen - I have no idea what was the cause but it didn't really matter.  In the end one of our party was unable to get her order fixed and ended up boxing it to take home...after waiting over 30 minutes to get the missing ingredient.\n\nOur waitress took that order off the bill which was very generous (and naturally resulted in a very generous tip).  But we were disappointed with the number of errors with our food and slowness in having them fixed by the kitchen.  If the kitchen staff were having a \"bad day\" the management should have been fixing it.  I live here in Las Vegas and normally go to Maggiano's almost every time I go to Fashion Show, but after this experience I have no plans to eat here again.  Hopefully the management will see this review and get their stuff together!"

The peas were good but I was looking for the lobster - where was the lobster I have seen in the Yelp photos??  Was I just there on a bad day where the cook said forget it, no lobster for you?!!  Cumulatively I don't think there was an inch of lobster in the whole dish.  Seriously, I would NEVER order this dish again.  I'll be back for the other items though, but this was a $27 mistake!\n\nOh yeah, service is always great, but minus one star for the forgettable lobster pasta dish.  Order the clams or the shrimp!

I must admit, it was slightly biased- I was part of an organization, and the organization catered the food.. so I had, literally, had a TON of food. Nonetheless, it was the best way to try the food!\n\nFirst, the appetizers came out. After having the appetizers, I was pretty set on making that my lunch! There was bruschetta, tomato caprese, two types of salad, but my favorite was the stuffed mushrooms. OH MAN, SO GOOD. I was trying to be all professional at this lunch, but all I really wanted to do was to just take the plate of mushrooms and eat off the plate. It was so juicy and flavorful! \n\nNext, came the actual entrees. After filling up on the mushrooms and good salads, I was about stuffed already. The entrees were all really good as well! There was the Four Cheese ravioli (mmm, def was one of my faves!), herb chicken, pork medallions (also, one of my faves!), some pasta + vodka dish, and some great tasting beef. It was all really really good.\n\nWhat really topped the meal off (well, any meal for all I'm concerned about) was the DESSERTS. First, these gigantic profiteroles came out, made out of huge biscuits and lots of ice cream. But, my favorite of all time came out.. the tiramisu!! As tiramisu is my all time favorite dessert, I had high expectations of this dessert.. and it was met. It was the right amount of lightness and the cheese was just right.. I was in heaven. \n\nOur waiter was great as well, explaining every item he brought out and was prompt on filling our drinks. He even answered nicely to all my curious questions of, \"so... what exactly is that? What is it cooked in?\" etc. \n\nPerhaps my view was slightly biased as I did not even have to pay for this lunch, but all I know, is the food was GREAT, and I would love to find a Maggiano's close to me! Mmm. :)"

I came back home, to Vegas, and was unaware we had one here until I went to the Fashion Show Mall. They never cease to amaze me. From their freshly baked bread that's still hot when brought to your table, to their absolutely delicious 4 Cheese Ravioli, you can't go wrong dining here. Our waitress was this super sweet lady who was obviously from a different country. I can't remember her name, but she was the best. Couldn't ask for a better server. The hostess was a bit... Off setting. She didn't look very happy. But I've been a hostess before and I know how stressful it can be. A smile will go a long way though (:"

Nice, fresh, plump mussles mixed with white beans, gave them an added creamy touch! Yes! \nThe third app were the stuffed mushrooms. They were good, but was missing something in the stuffing, maybe some sort of cheese...the spinach and bread crumbs were more mushy and added nothing to the mushrooms. \nIt was nice to sit out on the patio and watch the rest of the runners cross the finish line. \nWhen in Vegas I will definitely consider this a place to come back and grab a drink or a bite to eat."

He had been to one in LA before so we gave this one a try.  We were seated right away and, being the klutz that I normally am, I spilled my water all over the table.  Our waiter was super nice and friendly and joked around about it (aka he teased me).  He brought us bread right away and when I spilled water on that, he brought us another basket without us having to ask! \n\nI ordered the garlic shrimp linguine and my friend ordered the braised beef canneloni.  We both loved our meals but I think I filled up on bread so I couldn't finish.  We didn't have room in tiny mini fridge in our hotel room so we didn't take home any leftovers; our waiter seemed almost hurt by our almost full plates of food.  I usually don't like creamy sauces but my pasta was very delicious and flavorful and the shrimp was cooked perfectly (I find that with pasta, the shrimp is often overcooked).  \n\nThe decor was excellent and everything looked very clean.

I'm sure it loops every day though.\n\nDecor:  3.5 Stars\n\nFancier than Macaroni Grill and I should hope so as this is Vegas and a step above its sister restaurant.  The seating was vast and it could probably fit at least 5 bachelorette parties.  Oh yeaaahh...  bachelorette parties...   *droool*  There weren't too many people let alone bachelorette parties, but most patrons were enjoying the beautiful weather in their outdoor seating area.\n\nFood:  3 Stars\n\nThe minestrone was ok.  It was a bit cheesy and the color seemed paler (not as tomato-red) and its taste was different than most minestrone soups I've had.  \n\nI had the Lobster Fettuccine.  There wasn't much lobster.  Italian Sausages were also few and a bit burnt.  The peas and artichokes gave it a nice balance.  The white wine cream sauce was really good but a little salty than I like my pasta sauces to be.  So this Little Italy Favorite is a mainstay in San Francisco fare?  I'm glad I had the chance to savor it in Vegas.\n\nI'd come back.  I'd probably go someplace closer though, like Orange County and go all out Family Style.  \n\nP.S. - To the previous Yelpers, I agree that the food made me thirsty; however, this place isn't as salty as their cousin On The Border in Rancho Cucamonga.\n\nP.P.S. - Update 3/26.  I just read an article in Yahoo Health today:  http://health.yahoo.com/experts/eatthis/26542/americas-unhealthiest-restaurants.  Chili's, On the Border, and Macaroni Grill - all owned by Maggiano's parent company, Brinker are on the hit list and the sodium count on their menu items aren't benefiting my pre-hypertension."

Would I come here again? Well, if a motor vehicle is involved, then I'm headed to Caesars which is so much easier to deal with than this place. If I'm in the areas on foot and hungry, I'll go back into this place. Gave it three stars because of the parking and secondly, it's not as good as Carmines but it does not suck.

The decor in the restaurant looks nice, but the it is a little cramped in the hallways. The employees looked well dressed and clean, and also very friendly. I do have one complaint though. The waiter who boxed our food to go forgot to put the pasta in the box. It's a minor mistake, but my boyfriend was really upset to come home to his incomplete meal that he paid $30 for. Maggiano's price is not the highest in town, but it is higher than an average Italian restaurant. Granted they have higher than average tasting meal, but I'd at least expect them to at least remember something as important as pasta. All in all, I'd still come back because their food tasted wonderful. The veal was really tender, and so flavorful that you can taste immediately without even chewing. Keep it up, Chefs!"

I'd never eaten here prior, but I'm a little risk taker, and figured that hundreds of honest reviews cannot be wrong. I was SO RIGHT!!  We had our reception in the DiCarlo room on 3/28/16. Small crowd (26 ppl) and a dance floor w/a DJ. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place. \n\nThe Decor = Old world Italian (think 1950s, which went GREAT with my wedding theme of tea length dresses and fedoras). \n\nThe Service = Our waitstaff was very attentive, and very friendly. Our server kept making sure that we were all full with food and drinks in hand.\n\nThe Food = OMG. This was some of the BEST  I'd ever had. It was Family Style. We decided to go with the Milano Package (which included 4 HOUR open bar of premium liquor, and various wine, appetizers, salads, pasta, main course, and desert). We had SO MUCH FOOD that we ended up leaving with 5 trays of \"to go\" items that we just ate for dinner last night. Thank God we had a DJ to work off the food. \n\nThe Nitty Gritty =  I'm not sure if this goes for ALL the rooms, but to book a room (DiCarlo) there is a minimum of $1200 that needs to be spent (If your food package is less than that amount, you can always use DJ svs, cakes, decorations etc...as part of the minimum if booked through Maggiano's which is AWESOME). They do charge a 20% event Fee (before tax) for the private room used. Additional gratuity is optional as your waitstaff is paid at a higher rate for your event.\n\nHIGHLY recommended. For someone like myself who is a total control freak, these amazing Coordinators @ Maggiano's took care of everything that was required to make this day memorable. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!"

Strollers are parked away from the tables. Value: for the level of cuisine, it is definitely overpriced (3).\n\nIf I were to sum up what the feeling was after leaving Maggiano's, it would be an overpriced, upscale Olive Garden. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the food is definitely better as is the service. But the prices seemed exorbitant for what it was. \n\nWe ordered a plate of fried zucchini, a lunch special (half chicken parmesan sandwich and half Caesar salad), and a plate of gnocchi.\n\nThe fried zucchini was a bit greasy and the coating was too heavy. The ranch dressing was relatively bland and lacked acidity. For $12 it was a smaller portion than I expected.\n\nThe lunch special with a half portion of a soup, salad or sandwich for $10.50. I got the chicken parm sammy with a half Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was pretty generic and generally uninteresting (there was no garlicky, lemony, anchovy punch at all). The chicken parmesan sandwich was very skimpy on the chicken parm and could have used more marinara.\n\nThe gnocchi fared better. The gnocchi was soft and not overly gummy. However the sauce it was paired with was overly salty and needed more acidity to lighten the dish.\n\nService was good and prompt. Our water glasses remained filled and our food/check came quickly. \n\nFor families, they do have a changing station in the family bathroom which is hovering over the toilet. There is no private area to breastfeed. Strollers are parked around the hostess station while an infant car seat can fit in one of the booths.\n\nOverall, the joint is okay in my books. The level of cuisine certainly does not merit the lofty prices they charge. But then again, this restaurant is on the Strip. 3 starred review."

While the Lemon Drop was excellent, Sis had a little Bellini envy going on, for sure.\n\nWe had a calamari and shrimp appetizer which was plenty big enough to share and was served on a colorful bed of greens with a light dressing.\n\nSis had the Caesar Salad + shrimp, which she has had before and loves.  I went for the Spinach Salad and it was perfect, no need to add anything, as bacon and pine nuts were liberally applied.\n\nService was excellent and happy.  Great location + Great food = Great dining experience"

I've been to three of their locations, and most recently the Las Vegas one again.\n\nMy bf and I arrived around 8 on a Saturday night, and thankfully only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. I had been starving myself since the morning in anticipation of this meal. We took the first available, which was outside and I wouldn't recommend it. It's not Maggiano's fault, but there was an iPod commercial running on a continuous loop on one of the outdoor televisions at the mall. Even with the ambient noise, and the restaurant's own music, by the time we were done with dinner, I was ready to jab a fork in both of my ears. That being said, I still had a great dinner! \n\nI've never been disappointed with the food nor service, and this time was no different. Our waiter was very nice and attentive and helped us pick out a really good bottle of wine.  We started with the fried mozzarella with marinara sauce... yummm.  The Maggiano salad has a great light flavored dressing and little bits of prosciutto in it.... so tasty! And for the main course we shared my favorite dish on the face of this planet, the chicken and spinach manicotti. Words just cannot do this dish justice, suffice it to say it's freakin fabulous. \n\nI somehow mustered the courage to order desert, even though my stomach was filled to the max. But I just absolutely love their cheesecake. I am NOT a big fan of cheesecake, but Maggiano's makes theirs with mostly marscapone cheese and it is just wonderful! \n\nSo if you are in Vegas and looking for some overly generous portioned great food I highly recommend Maggianos!"

Second they ran out of food, or perhaps do not know how to plan well.  Third, they ran TWO HOURS late for our confirmed reservation!\nRidiculous- ran out of proscuitto for their own Maggiano's salad!  They obviously were running low on food by the time we were seated. (5:15 reservation, seated at 7:15!)\nFor seven adults, they place two ice cream scoops of mashed potatoes on a small plate in the center of the table-for seven people!  Then the turkey platter looked like  a sad plate of leftovers-and had one little mound of stuffing- which was gone after it was passed to the second person. We kept thinking that was decoration, and they would bring some in a bowl (aka family style). Same for the ham platter, one little scoop of sweet potatoes for seven adults!  The pasta course however, was abundant --apparently the only thing they know how to cook.  They brought two big bowls of pasta for side dishes. Everything was horribly over salted!  The gravy -also they must have been running out of...was a tiny little coffee cup sized dish of milky white looking blah gravy??   I cannot repeat enough it was HORRIBLE.  Two ten year olds could pull together a better turkey dinner.   They have a lot of nerve charging $40 per person!"

Got seated towards the back area with a view of the Encore/Wynn, our server was a great host since obviously we were the only ones there, provided great privacy and comfort to act a little hung over. I ordered the chicken florentine to my surprise, it was delicious and was a great proportion where I felt skinny for not tearing up my plate! (Or maybe it was my slight hangover?) The food is great for it being a mainstream/chain restaurant. I was expecting it to be like a Coco's type, but to gladly it exceeded my expectations.\nWill come back on my next visit and will recommend!\n\nHappy munching!"

Located in the Fashion Show Mall, the restaurant has easy access and parking. It has a great location. \n\nThe ambiance is just like every other Maggianos, with only about 1/3 of the tables having a view of the strip. We had made reservations for 8:00pm on a Wednesday night, and arrived 10 minutes late. Granted the restaurant was packed as ever, but there were empty tables. The Ma\u00eetre de gave us such a stern look of disapproval and then gave us a buzzer to wait near the bar. We waited for almost another 25 minutes, are you kidding me? \n\nWhen we were finally seated at a table in the back, it took us way longer than expected to get the attention of the waiter to take our order. Maybe they have a problem with the ratio of tables per waiter. We could see that he was working hard, but we were hungry as well! The food was delicious, as expected. All of us were stuffed and enjoyed our meal. We actually loved the two elderly men who came to sing at our table =) The one with the Violin reminded us of the man in UP. With such good food, we were happy to have several boxes of leftovers to enjoy the next day. \n\nBut then, at the end of the night when we were paying the bill, we asked the waiter to split the bill amongst the guests. One of our friends actually paid in cash and the waiter actually assumed that his bill was his tip. This is before we got the receipt back to sign. The waiter assumed, and gave himself a 25% tip! That has never happened to me before, and sadly I have to say he didn't deserve it. Overall we had a great time and I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would hope they would improve on their service between then."

The wait staff was young but knowledgeable, friendly and helpful but never intrusive. I had the linguine di mare which was perfectly prepared. It was mildly spicy and contained a nice mixture of lobster, shrimp, mussels and clams. Though I found it very generous with the lovely shrimp, I found it less than generous with the lobster - I found one small piece on my plate. The clams and mussels were tasty but rather small. One of my companions had the seared tuna which he very much enjoyed. The portion was large and was cooked perfectly medium rare with an ideal 1/8 inch seared thickness all around and a rare center. My other companion had the Parmesan crusted tilapia. It was well cooked and tasty. We accompanied our dinner with a bottle of their nice house chianti. For dessert, the three of us shared a generous and quite delicious order of the cannoli cake. With two rounds of drinks and tip, the bill was $240 for the three of us. A very enjoyable experience well suited to a special occasion."

They seated us right away on a Tuesday evening and the Cesar gave us stellar service.  This is Maggiano's so I didn't raise an eyebrow at $12 for a small glass of the \"house\" red (Cherry Tart pinot noir).  He recommended the risotto fritte for appetizer which I requested and we had the gnocchi in vodka sauce with Italian sausage and spaghetti with meat sauce.  The house bread they bring for free is awesome.  You can season some olive oil with pepper and Parmesan for dipping.  I'd say don't ruin your appetite but the quality of the food gave me pause to cancel that suggestion.  They served the risotto fritte quickly and upon seeing it, they are effectively arancini with pepperoni mixed in.  They are salty but dip it in the marinara they provide and they not only become brutally salty but the sauce obscures any subtlety of flavor in the balls.  By the time they brought our entrees I was starting to get full.  Both dishes suffered from the same affliction as the arancini.  Perfectly good pasta (wonderfully tender gnocchi especially) coated in supremely salty sauces.  I took a few forkfuls and asked for a box (as cold leftovers - once a lot of the sauce fell off was ok to eat).  About $75 for two with tip.  The waiter and staff definitely earned a top review and an extra star but considering the meal quality that only earns this place somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars."

Still, I have eaten there almost every trip I take to LV so I went again a few days ago. This time, YIKES!  I ordered the eggplant parmesan and I could barely eat it.  I wonder if it was stored in the kitchen for a while or what, because I could only eat a few bites.  It was sitting on top of spaghetti which was (weird and tasted) just OK.  Before my main meal I had tomato bisque soup which was very salty.  I was so disappointed in the meal.  My waiter was rather scattered.  I had to ask him four times for some butter for my bread. I will say he was friendly and did his best.  I think he could tell I did not like the food as he did give me some lemon cookies from their bakery when I asked for my check.  I will say those were delicious, but I wasn't there for cookies.  I don't think I will come back to eat at Maggiano's unless the locals tell me that the restaurant has improved and is back on track.

I threw in a side of broccolini to have a nice lil veggie in the mix.\n\nWell 1 - 10:\napps 10\nmarsala 7 - salty but good.\nfrancaise 5 - It wasn't bad, but I have had much better and expected more.\nling with g&o - 2  No taste at all\nPotatoes - 7\nBroccolini - 10 nicely cooked and seasoned in garlic and oil\n\nThe menu is very extensive and overall it was a great time with the gf.

We went here about 3 years ago and wanted a nice dinner after watching \"KA\" and it was a nice walk to get there and we only waited about 20 mins. We got seats near the window with a wonderful view of the Vegas strip. If you're gonna compare chain Italian restaurants, \"Maggiano's\" little Italy is much better than \"Olive Garden\". I recommend going here to finish off a nice romantic night in Vegas."

Located conveniently outside Fashion Show Mall, perfect place to grab lunch or dinner if you're at the North end of the strip.  There isn't a Maggiano's in the Bay Area, but this best resembles Romano's Macaroni Grill and/or Olive Garden.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here for lunch before our flight home and ordered:\n-Rigatoni D: chicken, mushrooms and rigatoni pasta [I forgot what sauce was used...since this was my boyfriend's plate and I didn't really eat off of it cuz my sandwich was so filling].\n- Seared Salmon Sandwich: the sandwich included 1) seared salmon was so moist, 2) applewood bacon was so crispy, 3) avocado gave it the perfect ring to my sandwich (I LOVE avocados in my sandwich), 4) tomato, 5) lettuce.  The brioche bread was so fresh and soft!  Kettle chips was a bonus!\n\nBill wasn't too bad for 2 people considering how full we were.

I also ordered the lasagna (which they're well known for) which was also served cold and the sauce was nearly flavorless.  I would've been more satisfied with a Stauffers frozen lasagna.  I hope the Las Vegas location management does some serious quality control, trains the staff, and realizes that Vegas is a very competitive market before they're out of business.

I have eaten at the one in Minneapolis as well as this one. I guess in the hiearchy of Italian food Chain restaurants it goes something like this:\n\nOut of the can and not Italian: Chef Boyardee\nSlightly better Casual not Italian: Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill\nA little better if you didn't know better: Pasta Pomodoro \nMid-level trying to fool you as high-end Italian: Maggiano's and Buca de Beppo\nHigher prices and more Northern Italian: Il Forniao\nReally great Italian: don't tend to be chain restaurants \n\nMaggiano's has nice ambiance, expensive dark wood decor, and is usually very popular and crowded. In Vegas expect to wait even with a reservation. We had a party of 10, called at 5 and couldn't get reservation until 8:30. Maggiano's is perfect for large parties, as they offer huge dishes that are meant to be shared (most have a half size option, so take it!) They offer a family style approach special menu for large groups, where the cost is $29.95 per person, and includes 2 shared appetizers, 2 pastas, and 2 mains in a bottomless approach. They encourage this, as they will tell you if you order a la carte, it may take 30 - 45 minutes (for Pasta?). we went a la carte because some didn;t want to comprimise into limited selections. \n\nThe Mozzarella Buffula appetizer (what they called Tomato Slice and Mozzarella, or something like that) is one of my favorite Italian appetizers. The special goat mozzarella with a basil leaf over a tomato slice is a nice combination, Maggiano's shreds the basil, which I prefer the fresh whole leaf. You get 3 slices with an order. \n\nThe Capellini d'arrabiata (which they call by the English name of Angel Hair) comes in a huge bowl with about 1/2 to 1 pound of pasta, roma tomatoes, garlic and a little oil, with some basil, and a slightly spicey arrabiata sauce. They have a couple of lasagna offerings, either covered in a bolognese (ground beef) sauce or in a Marinara. It is huge, like everything is. There is a large menu of good selections for most people. \n\nThey don't offer olive oil and balsamic vinegar with your bread, but if you ask for it, they will bring it to you. \n\nIf you want A LOT of food and willing to pay over $30 per person for Pasta, go here."

As locals, our group of 4 was well aware that we would need reservations for a busy Saturday night.  When we called at about 5pm to make reservations we were told \"we can get you in now or at 9pm.\" We immediately went on open table and booked a reservation for 6:30pm. So, clearly, the hostess stand and open table seem to have some miscommunication.  Once we arrived we were escorted to our patio table but another couple cut in front of us and took our seats. Our host went over to talk to them and came back with his apologies and confusion.  He said \"they did have reservations as well but just sat themselves.\" While the appropriate action would have been to tell them they must be escorted and seated by a host, they just let them have their way. Fine, we didn't want to make an issue of it and just wanted to get on with our evening. We were then sat at another patio table that was filthy with food remnants and bird feces. We let the host know immediately and he said someone would be by shortly. After about 5 minutes of sitting there at our wobbly table (we looked underneath and it was being held on with electrical tape!!!) we'd had enough! One of our party went to address our issues and horrible experience thus far and were promptly seated at a different patio table by Kristie Miller. She was apologetic and friendly. Our server Gary was very fun and attentive. The chef even came out to discuss a special request one of our party had placed. Thank you all for making what started out as a zero-star experience a pleasant evening. Kudos to Kristie for turning this one around!"

No spice or pepper, and not a whiff of flavor from the fatty meat.  Marbled goodness, this was not.  Ravenous from a heavy workout earlier, I would have normally savaged this piece of meat.

Maggiano's was one of my favorite meals in Las Vegas, because they just made everything easy. First of all, being in a non-smoking restaurant was literally a breath of fresh air. We got to curl up in a cozy booth facing floor to ceiling windows so it was an entirely different vibe from most casino restaurants. \n\nIt is a chain, but it meant they offered a wide variety of reasonably priced options and our lunch entrees, Chicken Pesto Linguine and Chicken Francese ($11 - 13), were excellent. One of my favorite things to eat in Italy is a fresh arugula salad lightly tossed with oil, but it is hard to find in the U.S. I was thrilled when it came as a side to the Chicken Francese and it brought back so many wonderful memories. \n\nFrom our arrival through the end of service, the staff was professional, prompt and courteous. Portion size was hearty, especially the pasta dish, so we even skipped dinner that night. Not the most exciting choice in town, but sometimes you just want a little comfort food and air, sweet, sweet fresh air."

The Chef came out with the biggest smile ( I thought the Italian mafia going to kill me and buried me in the desert) but gave me couple options. I was delighted to know I can eat some Angel pasta with vegetables and Primavera sauce. Great service as well (if the server can stop to call me Boss on every sentence and replace \"Boss\" by \"Sir\" it will be great.. Thank you for the present as well when I left. Thank you Maggiano's  and welcome to the neighborhood!"

Daughters spaghetti was fine. Service was fine.  Were told we had a 1/2 hour wait. Buzzer buzzed 75 minutes later. Formulaic, poorly executed Italian food that people seem to queue for. I'm puzzled.

We were 30 min early, but they waited until 615 to seat us - which would have been great, if the service times were fantastic.\n\nFor a party of 8 it took 15 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered. Then close to 40 minutes to get our meals after being ordered. Our party was ready to leave after filling up on bread and drinks for 45 minutes! Once we were finishing up, it took another 20 minutes to bring out the cake that we brought in. Nothing was done in the dead time to fill the wait... having a similar wait time experience at another nearby restaurant, they brought out a couple courses of comped appetizers to sate people due to the extended wait time. \n\nThe meals were great. All of the food was enjoyed once they replaced the kids macaroni and cheese plate. For some reason their kids dish is made with a bitter white cheese and my son didn't like it.\n\nI would definitely return here, but they need to pay closer attention to the service times and fix whatever the issue is that is stretching out their table turns."

But, he did have their baked ziti and was very disappointed.  Just a little cheese on top and watery gravy (red sauce) on the bottom. All of my seafood pasta choices have come out exactly the same.  One dish is described as shrimp Fra Diavolo with spicy tomato sauce - nope it was pink, watery like broth and no spice,  Another was the shrimp scampi - nope pink, watery, tasteless and shrimp were slightly overdone.  Another choice linguini di Mare - pink, watery, tasteless sauce with overcooked seafood.  I loved the Maggianos on the Strip and the one near SouthCoast Plaza in CA.  Someone needs a lot of instruction on the seafood side of the kitchen.  The restaurant is beautiful and the service is great.   I want them to succeed but the have to be able to manage basic sauces and there is no greater sin in Italian cooking then watery, tasteless sauces."

My server was very out of focus and inattentive. We were waiting forever for refills, the check, and so on. The second time, the server we had was a lot more attentive. But what I have noticed is that the staff is not very well read on the menu. They do not seem to know how the menu works or what is on it. This isn't just from the servers I had, but also from hearing other servers talk to other tables. I would just suggest that the servers read up more on the menu and get the information down on lock. We had two entrees to go and when we got in the car we noticed only one was in the bag. Which was odd because we watched our server check the bag and assumed that it was all in there. When we brought it back and explained the situation, the host looked at another employee and says \"what do I do\". That just shows that the staff needs more training. So they called for the manager and we got our second entree. But he didn't really apologize or make sure everything was okay. Which isn't really surprising considering how the overall experience was, but if you are a manager you need to provide the best service possible and ensure that your customers are satisfied and will come back. Overall: it's a glorified Olive Garden. My experience wasn't BAD, it just wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. The staff needs some more training that's for sure. The food isn't amazing and there's definitely better Italian restaurants in the same price range near by. I'm not sure I'll be back. Maybe I'll give it another chanc when it's been open longer and the restaurant is running more smoothly. The two star rating is based mostly on service, the food was okay."

The eggplant parm was served over a small amount of pasta which should be served separately-was awful -not fresh -was mushy -the same sweet thick sauce.

Maggiano's has a family style dinner where you pick one appetizer, one salad, two entrees , two meats and two desserts for 4 people and a child. Our share came out to be around $89.00 with plenty of left overs. The proportions are a good size where there is plenty to share. \n\nWe first had a complimentary appetizer come out compliments of the chef which had tomatoes, roasted garlic and  fresh mozzarella. It was like a mini Bruschetta bar. \n\nThe salad we had was the Maggiano's specialty salad . It came with a light creamy dressing, crumbles of blue cheese and crispy bacon. It was light and didn't have a strong blue cheese taste.\n\nThe appetizer we chose was the fried calamari with marinara dipping sauce. The calamari was tender and it didn't taste fishy. It was a great choice instead of my first choice of mozzarella sticks. My friend was like \"you have to get your money's worth \"....lol....She was right on getting the calamari instead. \n\nThe Shrimp Fra Diavolo I thought I would love but it was only okay to me. The shrimp was kind of smelly for me. I love shrimp but not in this dish, \n\nMom's Lasagna was really good! I typically don't like  lasagna but I favored this  over the shrimp pasta. \n\nVeal Parmesan and the Veal Marsala was good but I liked the Veal Parmesan better because it was less salty. \n\nWe had the Tiramisu and Apple Crostada for dessert which were\nequally delicious. \n\nThe service was wonderful and welcoming! We didn't feel rushed because of the holiday . The servers were very accommodating and happy to help us with anything from refills to taking pictures for our table."

The manager apologized and gave us free desserts and again, all was well. \n\nThird visit: Went with a friend for her son's birthday dinner. The service was extremely slow at our table for some reason. There were four of us, yet a table with a larger party next to us (that came later than us) were able get their food, pay, and leave before us.

We felt very satisfied that we had made the right choice and will return again when we go back to the Red Rock."

The minimum requirement for four or more at $32.95 per head is an unbeatable price for what you get and it's bottomless! Refill for our group need not apply. The huge portions given were incredible! We came in with a party of 8 to celebrate the holiday season from work. Here's the rundown of what we ordered:\n\nCompliments of the Chef Italian Antipasti -  Amazing way to start our meal! \n\nChoose 1 Salad - Chopped Salad was crispy, refreshing, and an excellent choice!\n\nChoose 1 appetizer (7 options) - Stuffed mushrooms were huge and tasty!\n\nChoose 2 pasta (19 options) - Linguine and Clams and Tuscany Shrimp and Chicken. Both pasta were cooked al dente and had wonderful flavor. The meat portions were generous!\n\nChoose 2 Signature Cuts (11 options) - Veal Parmesan and Grilled Salmon Lemon and Herb. These dishes were cooked perfectly. The Veal Parmesan was lightly coated with breading without being overcooked. Grilled salmon with lemon and herb was absolutely delicious! It was garnished with spinach. \n\nChoose two desserts (10 options) - Apple Crostada and Chocolate Zuccotto Bites. The Apple Crostada was served warm with ice cream on top. This reminded me of an apple pie. Super good with a light crunch! The Chocolate Zuccotto Bites remind me of truffles but not as rich.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how much this place impressed me and my friends. Starting from the reservation request made, the amazing food served, and our server Erin who definitely has people skills! She was very accommodating and always had a smile on her face every time we needed assistance.\n\nThis location is an absolute return versus the other location at Fashion Mall where they cater more to tourists than locals. And by being not too far from home, this place hits a home run all around!"

No freshly grated cheese offered, just the dry leftover parmesan cheese powder in a shaker on the table. My \"crusted chicken\" had no crust, just the browning of the egg it had been dipped in. From my experience the food here is below average. The 2 \"gift meals\" we took home were no better.  I really don't understand why this place has so many customers. Cheesecake Factory makes a better pasta than this place. They have nothing on other \"scratch kitchen\" Italian restaurants like Carrabbas.  I'm giving it two stars because the tiramisu was actually good. (maybe not made on site?)"

Having lived in Chicago we were never disappointed when we went to any of the unique and successful restaurants opened under the tutelage of Rich Melman. We were eager to try the second Maggianos closer to us than the one located in the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas strip where you could always count on great food and customer service. However we were disappointed to find out there was no similarity between the two locations. When we entered we were surprised to find the restaurant fairly deserted  during the dinner hour. We were further surprised to find servers rushing back and forth past our table with out even a glance at us. After 10 minutes of watching servers chatting and looking busy I left my seat to stop one scurrying by for the third time to get some service. Disappointment continued as the wait for our drinks and appetizers was unreasonable considering the lack of customers. Our flatbread pizza was baked so long it was like a wooden board. The final insult came when the complimentary take out pasta that all customers received during the opening week took an inordinate amount of time to receive as did our check. I realize this was their grand opening but thats when customer service and food quality count if you expect return business."

Unfortunately, I will have to continue taking the trek down to the strip if I want hot and fresh Italian food instead of defrosted and microwaved Italian food, or simply walk to one of the other 2 Italian restaurants that taste much better.\nOur waiter, Tommy, did a great job serving us and everyone else was very nice and attentive. Throughout the service my daughter and I kept saying something about the look and flavors of the dishes we had ( lasagna and fettuccini alfredo) resembled and tasted like canned sauce and microwaved meals. Normally on the strip the food comes out piping hot and you can actually see and taste the basil, garlic and oregano. Don't expect that at the DT Summerlin location...2 stars for the food, 4 stars for the service - whomp, whomp."

Not sure if it's bc the service was superb-- shout out to Jenna!-- given their President Steven was walking around, greeting customers and bussing plates! I always learned through business school.. and even that show on CBS that a good CEO understands even what the lowest employee endures and experiences. Regardless, there wAs lots of staff on hand tonifht and nothing went awry.\n\nTo start from the end-- almost everyone walks out of that restaurant with a doggie bag in hand. Why? Because when you order a certain meal special you get a take home order of their classic pastas. Yes that's right.. dinner.. lunch.. and dinner again! \n\nMaggianos is my go to Italian if I'm not in Little Italy NYC. Family style is nuts. Definitely a great way to celebrate a meal with the family. \n\nOur favorites are the gnocchi and sausage, chicken piccata, and the lasagna. Dessert is never to be missed! \n\nI can't wait to come here monthly. Oh how large I will become..."

They are brand new and want to make an great first impression. Our server was Jenna. So nice!! She was sweet and engaging with my 2 peanuts. She gets 5 stars. I don't think my two \"suggestions\" are worth anymore then 1 star loss...\nI wish they had a light sauce for the non meat eaters in the crew.  (Also wish they had almond/soy for coffee too but...)\nI wish their kids ice cream was more than 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream. I'm sure the food cost for some chocolate syrup and sprinkles is next to nothing and it would make it 100% more appetizing to a 3yr old. We would have gone for gelato if we knew that was the case. But, they have this \"gift\" part of the menu. If you order from one section of the menu you get a gift. When she said it I thought maybe a coupon for future visit or complimentary dessert. Nope, a free entree. Winning. I was able to grab dinner for my husband who was not feeling well and was home sleeping. I will be back again and again. Food was delicious, service was amazing!"

            "review": "We normally go to the Fashion Show Mall location, which is always just, AMAZING. Being that this location is so much closer, we decided to come here for my son's birthday! I had made the reservations a week in advance, and had gotten confirmation the day of. We arrived 15 minutes early, where I told her our party had shrunk to only 4, possibly 5 and she stated she would keep me at 5. We stood, since they only have one small bench, there for 25 minutes past 7, starving, watching everyone get seated. I went and asked what the deal was and she said they were just cleaning our table. We ended up getting seated in the middle of the resto in a huge table for either 8 or 10, I can't really remember, next to what looked like a table they were setting up for a party of 15 and next to a part of 8. At this point, there were 4 of us. FOUR OF US, INCLUDING MY 11 year old. I got up to find the host and asked if we could PLEASE have a smaller table, because we were literally yelling across this monster table to speak to each other. He said he would see what he could do.\n\nWe ended up getting seated at the bastard table in the corner, and it was not 7:45pm... my reservation was for 7pm.\n\nOur server FINALLY came over after 10minutes and we were literally ready to eat the table. We asked for bread and water, like dang prisoners, and ordered right away. He was totally aloof and had to come back a few times because he got the drink orders wrong.We noticed a large party getting seated about 30 minutes after we did and he was on the like a pig in shit. It was really sad. Our food finally came out, I would say after a good 25 minutes, luckily we ordered when we did, and it was less than desirable. My sauce was watery, and my chicken was luke warm, one of our guests food was COLD, and the others was just alright. But, we weren't going to say anything because 1. our server was no where to be found and 2. it would've taken like 100 more hours to get new food. So we just suffered in silence. Did he come and ask if everything was alright? No? Was he almost sucking the shat out of the other larger parties a hole? You bet your butt! They literally had their drinks filled, bread, their food, everything either before us or at the same time... AND THEY GOT THERE 30 MINUTES AFTER US! And let me remind you... we had resos at 7pm and IT WAS MY SON'S BIRTHDAY.\n\nOur server finally came to the table and asked if we would like dessert, he asked my son if he would like a scoop of ice cream or the lemon cookies. Now, when I got the confirmation call for the reso, the nice man told me they would give him a plate of the lemon cookies and it would say \"happy birthday\" and that they would sing happy birthday to him.  So I was kind of confused. My son answered the ice cream. Now, I made my son wait to open his gifts until after he was sang happy birthday to him, needless to say he was antsy, because we had already been here 2 effing hours! So, lets go ahead and wait almost 30 more minutes for our scoop of ice cream........ we see our server...... nope..... NOTHING. In the mean time, guess what? I let my son open his gift and whilst he's doing that, the large party is done with their lovely meal and EXITS (While I'm taking photos, literally photobombed us, we were seated in the corner and they did not want to be inconvenienced with walking through the resto so they decided to use the exit next to us and walk through the videos and photos of my son opening his gifts, they weren't quick about it either, rude, uncouth mongrels!.) THEY LEAVE! Because why? BECAUSE THEY WERE TAKEN CARE OF. And here we are, waiting for ice cream and a happy birthday.\n\nAt this point I'm pissed. I see what looks to be Supervisor or Manager and I go and express that my son hasn't gotten his birthday ice cream scoop and the treatment we have received thus far, and how the table next to us was seated WAY after us has already eaten and left. He apologizes. Oh yeah, forgot to mention, our server indeed gave us the check when he asked if we wanted dessert. So, I gave the manager the money, and advised, see, we even tipped for the shitty service.\n\nOur server finally brings out the ice cream and a plate of stale cookies, no happy birthday writing on the plate, and acts like he did us a favor. UGH\n\nAND GUESS WHAT?? NO HAPPY BIRTHDAY SONG FOR MY SON! Yet we hear them singing it to another table, and my son looked at me confused.\n\nHow can you not sing happy birthday to an 11 year old, who had a reservation for a birthday? My son is so sweet and said it was ok, that it wasn't my fault his birthday was ruined. \n\nI expected so much more! We could've went anywhere else to celebrate his big day, but chose here and sorely regret it. Total time there around 2.5 hours!"

We were first in line and three more couples came in after us. The fourth couple tried to take the first available table. We said we were waiting first. They got all huffy that it was first come first serve and if they could sit there before us then they get it. We said again we were trying not to bother the dude who was eating. They got pissed and left instead of waiting for  the next table. A older single woman came in and sat at the bar bc she felt bad taking a table ordering an appetizer for herself. We chatted about the game. What a lovely lady. The gentleman who was finishing his meal invited a second gentleman  who was only there to watch the game to sit as he was leaving. We introduced ourselves to him, Jerry, and said we were going to eat. He asked if he could camp out and watch the game as today was his 60th birthday. He was a snowbird who owned a restaurant on Long Island. We met a couple of his friends who were here to celebrate with him. The service from Joey (awesome female server) and Laura took care of us. The food was of the quality one would expect from maggiano s but with Marco s meal it was an awesome deal. The trip started off a little sour but was sweet by the end!! Go Cleveland!"

Of course the sausage was removed from the check and a gentleman sporting some sort of headset stopped by with a quick apology.

My family had such high hopes because we ate at the Maggianos a while back located in the strip and had a good experience. However this time, it was nowhere near pleasant. \n\nOur waitress didn't even know the menu. She told me that I could not have the Spaghetti and meatball and meat sauce together, but can only order Spaghetti and marinara and the meatball. However the menu said I can choose either sauce.  When we showed her, she seemed flustered. I was quite surprised when she told me that because spaghetti and meatball must have been a popular dish on their menu. Throughout our lunch, she was in a rush. While we were still eating she would keep asking us if we were done eating and take our plate. \n\nFor food, we ordered the lobster carbonara and spaghetti and meatballs with meat sauce, both of which were below average. They came out cold and dry. The lobster looked and tasted dry as if it was defrosted. It would be better if it were more fresh, juicy, evenly cut, and were bigger. The lobster and noodles weren't coated in sauce either because it sat for so long. The noodles were okay but wasn't amazing as they made it out to be because it was \"made from scratch\". The meat sauce of the spaghetti with meatballs was VERY soupy, sweet, and unseasoned. Another result of sitting out for so long is the soupiness of the sauce. The meatball wasn't as juicy or tender as the one from Trattoria Reggiano. I honestly think anyone could make better pasta at home. \n\nAfter this upsetting experience, they made a mistake when charging us for the Spaghetti and Meatballs. It took another 10- 15 minutes for the manager to come and fix it, and she didn't even bother to ask if we wanted to change the tip. \n\nIf you try Trattoria Reggiano and Maggianos, you will see what I mean in this review. There is something significantly missing here. If they want to survive amongst the 2 other Italian restaurants, they're going to have to improve their service and food."
