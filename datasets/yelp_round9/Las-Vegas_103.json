            "review": "The sushi wasn't sub par because the location and prices set a higher standard, it was poor quality sushi even for strip mall standards. Not only was the size very small...smaller than a regular sushi place but the quality was not only disappointing, it just wasn't that good. Had I eaten this from a to go box, I would've thought it was from a grocery store.  It is unbelievable that they would charge the absolutely outrageous prices they charge and not have the quality back it up a thousand percent. A hand roll is literally 2 bites, the fish in a sushi order is thin, small and tasteless, the regular rolls were decent but at $32/roll, I thought my socks would be blown off. We asked if they did fried rice and the waitress said they could make it but it would be a $45 charge. Ridiculous! The ONLY redeeming part of the whole meal was that it's located next to the Bellagio fountain and we asked to sit outside for my daughter's birthday. Definitely skip this place! So many other places to go, this place isn't it!!"

            "review": "I love sushi.  I love it raw and I love it alot!  My goal is to try every Japanese place in every hotel we stay at in Vegas.  Raw may give you the runs but raw will keep you lean.  Yellowtail at the Bellagio Hotel in Vegas is an excellent choice.  We started out with endamame (soybeans) which came out in 2 flavors:  with sea salt or wok fried with a sweet chili sauce.  The sea salt was good, but the sweet chili sauce was a little too oily for our tastes.  It's something a white person would eat and like, but for Asians don't do it! It was like something from Panda Express - the white man's chinese food.  Our next try was the spicy miso soup with crab. It was not too spicy, pretty good, but the crab made it a little fishy tasting.  Next we tried yellowtail sashimi and giant clams. Both were delicious and fresh tasting.  Yellowtail has fish flown in daily. Next we had the kobe beef skewers.  It tastes like real kobe beef.  Alot of times you go to places that sell Kobe beef and it just tastes like regular American angus. We finished off with mango sorbet and mochi balls.  The fried mochi balls are good if you like that doughy mochi taste.\n\nTry the Omakase.  It's a six course fixed menu.  It will give you a little sample of everything.  Do not try the melon martini.  It was gross and creamy.  Creamy martinis are always disgusting.  Service gets an A+ here.  There are always about 5 people nearby just waiting to meet your needs.  Oh and this is not your traditional sushi place with the sweet Japanese girls.  The girls look like the \"me love you long time\" type in shorty slutty cleavagey dresses.  I think that big fake racks are required to work here since all of the girls had them. The tits here are better than they are Hooters. It's great for people watching!"

            "review": "Upon arrival, you are able to see that the restaurant is very well decorated and the fixtures and furniture are amazing (of course nothing less would be accepted at the Bellagio)! They sat us at a round table that we all appreciated. However you weren't able to focus on the atmosphere because the hip-hop dance music was playing so loud it was difficult to even talk to the person next to you. (now don't get me wrong - we went clubbing after dinner and hip-hop dance is what were after that nite but with a 5 star level of service the music was really contradictory to the atmosphere). It was also very dark - almost so much so that it was hard to read the menu.\n\nWe were greated promptly and presented with the wine and saki menu. They have no warm saki so I chose a cold saki that they were out of. The sommelier was sent over to make other recommendations but it was just as though she was reading from the saki menu, not really making any suggestions or asking me what I had in mind. Therefore on my third try for a drink I opted for a cocktail, but other members of my party got sparkling saki that they enjoyed.\n\nOur server was prompt and seemed very knowledgeable. He made great recommendations, many of which we tried. This is not your typical sushi roll restaurant! They had the best albacore tuna and yellowtail sashimi that I have ever eaten (and I have eaten sashimi all over the world). Other members of my party enjoyed the spicy tuna snapping roll - I recommend you try it! The cucumber salad was heavenly with a sesame dresssing. The espresso was wonderful at the end of meal with dessert!\n\nOverall this experience was slightly pleasureable and never forgettable, the food was excellent in quality and flavor, average in presentation. We probably won't eat there again and most likely won't recommend it. Maybe lunch there would have been a better choice."

The high steaks roll is good too. \n\nThe bad: The second-to-last time we went there, we made a reservation on Open Table. Their airheaded hostesses couldn't even be bothered pressing the button on the screen that said that we had shown up. We spent over $1,000 that night and yet got a nasty note from Open Table saying we were cut off from making reservations, because we had \"No Show\"ed at Yellow Tail. Are you kidding me?? \n\nMore bad: This last time, we got a call to confirm our reservation, with a warning saying, because they are so full tonight, all dinners are limited to two hours. Basically, we will kick you out. Are you kidding me? \n\nI've had enough of the attitude. There are plenty of great sushi restaurants in Vegas and we'll happily spend our money there."

But it was too...something.  Pretentious maybe?  It irritated me.  (not giving much information here!)\n\nBut the food was great.  We ordered this tuna pizza thing and a crab dish to share as appetizers, which were fantastic.  Especially the tuna pizza.  For my entree i had some sort of \"angry salmon\" roll -- really good.\n\nI just hated the ambiance for some reason -- just over the top.  Also, we had probably the worst table in the house, and twice a waiter brought us food that didn't belong to us."

Other restaurants have seating next to windows, but I think this one (maybe also olives) are the only one that allow you outside to see it all. \n\nWe called and made a reservation for a Tuesday night. While the restaurant really wasn't that busy, the patio is small so it's worth calling. \n\nThe service as most yelp reviews have said, was ok. Weird buser who kept making loud dramatic comments about how much water I was drinking. The server was a calm individual who never listened to what we would answer to his questions. Example, so\" you guys are here visiting Las Vegas?\" \"No we're local, we're just celebrating our anniversary\" \"do you know what you would like to drink?\" \n\nThe food:\n1. The tuna pizza, pretty good. Bread to tuna was sad. But hey, it shows the chef knife skills to cut the fish that thin!\n2. King crab tempera chopped and deep fried. Small portion but good flavor.\n3. Salmon roll. Same as any roll at a sushi place. But they double the price. \n\nWould I come again? Maybe for dessert and capachinos and sit on the patio. If your on the patio...it ain't worth spending your money here."

They wanted to eat at Outback Steakhouse since they spent the day buying designer belts, but I was NOT down for that. I told them that this place had a steak too... a grown up steak.\n\nAnyways, I had the spicy tuna roll, the eel roll, and the surf clam sushi.\nSpicy tuna: just the right amount of spice. Had a great kick to it and the fish tasted super fresh. Also had some scallions thrown in there which heightened the flavor a bit\nEel roll: Pretty good. IMO it's pretty easy to mess up an eel roll by dousing it with sauce, but this was perfect.\nSurf clam sushi: Best surf clam I've had in awhile. Surf clam can be awfully tough and hard to chew, but this was great. Surf clam was tender and just the perfect consistency. \n\nOur server was amazing. He was very accommodating to my friends and I. Regularly checked up on us, topped up our drinks, and made sure that our table was spotless. \n\nMy friends didn't want to admit that they had the best steak of their lives that night, despite the small portions, but I'll take their facial expressions at face value. It's really hard to find a non-gimmicky place in Vegas, but this was it for me. Loveee Yellowtail and I'll def be back soon."

The atmosphere is like a nightclub, the music was loud and terrible, and it was extremely dark.\n\nPutting all of that aside, the food was mediocre at best.  The sauce that the tofu came with tasted exactly like Oriental Ramen broth.  The rolls were extremely small and had minimal flavor, the edemame was adequate although half of it was overcooked.\n\nI think their slogan on the business card said it all:\n\n\"Yellowtail - Barely Adequate\""

All of us showed up either 5 minutes early or on time, and were asked to wait for a few minutes. No problem, we understand this is usually the case while tables are cleared out. \n\nBy 8:20pm, we were all still standing around. \n\nHowever, during the 25 minute wait for our tables, two Japanese business groups (containing 4-6 people each) showed up without reservations and were rushed through to open seats. When we asked Barbie about this, she just prattled, \"Oh, it'll just be a few more minutes.\" \n\nWe left shortly afterward. \n\nI'm not sure what happened to the other 4 schmucks patiently waiting for a table. But as far as I'm concerned, front of house represents the restaurant and if you cannot manage your customers, how do I know whether you can manage the food?\n\nTwo thumbs down for this restuarant."

Thank goodness it was my birthday dinner so I got my wish! We ended up at Yellowtail in the Bellaggio. The staff is completely friendly and fun and I love that more than anything. Friendly staff can make okay tasting food into a great food experience and you might not even realize it. The ambiance really seemed to match the whole cocktail dress look, I honestly felt like I was in an episode of the Hills, I don't know if it was the martinis or what, but I really felt like Heidi would walk by with Spencer or something. I loved how the windows looked right out to the Belaggio fountains. The sushi here is really amazing, taste was extremely well balanced, fresh and just left you wanting more and more. I loved the two different kinds of Edamame, the one with the sweet chili sauce on the pods was a hit at the table. I was a little disappointed by how simple the menu was, I like lots of specialty rolls with lots of ingredients in them as opposed to the more simple rolls but the simple rolls were to die for so I am not complaining at all. The entire table seemed to really be enjoying their experience the signature cocktails were well received as well as the food. The birthday dessert brought out was similar take on a chocolate lava cake with a liquor and mint infused foam on top. Perfect to share with a table. I would highly suggest taking a few moments out of your trip and give Yellowtail a try, great place for several occasions and you might see Brody or something!"

Our waiter was a great photographer, so he gets kudos for the most excellent picture he took! \n\nThe specialty drinks are stunning and creative in presentation, heavy on the alcohol by my standards, but expensive - $20 for one martini!  Loved the Lychee martini!\n\nThe food is fresh, inspired, and pretty!  We had the Big Eye Tuna Pizza.  I could have eaten two of them by myself.  It really isn't a pizza at all, but an artfully covered cracker with plenty of tuna accented by shiso and truffle oil. To get my daily dose of veggies, we ordered the grilled eggplant skewers which were covered in miso and sesame. It was sweet and good enough for dessert.  We had to try the Popping Spicy Crab Roll, the claim to fame being the addition of pop rocks (remember those?) amongst a more traditional crab, asparagus and cucumber roll.  We were expecting an explosion of sorts on our mouths but it was actually very subtle and sweet on the finish. It didn't wow us like we thought it would, but it was still a delicious roll.\n\nYellowtail is really all about the combination of atmosphere, service and food, and it was a great experience!  Next time, we might try sitting in the lounge area that faces the casino as you get a prime spot for people watching as the throngs of people come through Via Bellagio! That's entertainment!"

We were a large group of 20 meeting up for a joint bachelor/ette dinner after a weekend of solo partying. The girls were staying in the bellagio but the guys were not so of course there were a few people who were late (within 10 minutes) arrivals. The manager was overly concerned with these people not being present even though we had a prix fixe menu already outlaid, and orders at the ready. Eventually he let us sit but as people filed in he scowled as us disapprovingly the entire time.\n\nThis was very strange since it was early, they had been nothing by nice in making the arragements over the phone and via email, and the place was totally not full. Also, we were all dressed up trying to show each other that we hadn't partied as hard as we could the night prior! Dressed to the nines and very mellow as we dined and tried to eliminate the pain we felt from the night before, we were far from rowdy but this manager acted like we were wild kids who needed to be rushed along.\n\nThe wait staff was actually professional and friendly and everyone was well taken care of. We had three awesome options for entrees and the accompaniments were equally delicious. My shortribs were very tasty tho a little on the fatty side (tricky when you're eating with chopsticks). A bunch of people ordered extra food like sushi (strawberry roll!) and sashimi and it was fresh and flavorful. They had a nice selection of tequilas and girly drinks like the cucumber one I was enjoying. Our shared dessert plate was a hit!\n\nI would come back if that manager were off duty for sure!"

We walked out for under 100 bucks and that was for Appetizer, Cali Roll, Unagi Sushi, Sweet Shrimp something er other, and Dessert.\n\nThe staff was incredible. We had atleast 4 different people serving us. From the warm towels, to topping off our drinks, to checking to see if we needed anything else, to offering information on their menu.\n\nThe menu is about the only negative. And that is mostly because I'm not uber sushi connoisseur. But the staff was friendly and answered all the questions I had.\n\nOh! And the view...we were lucky to get a seat inside, next to the window, looking right outside to the fountains.\n\nIf you like sushi, you gotta check it out!"

We had a table near the window but it was too windy for the watershow that day. We arrived a bit early for our reservation so we waited in the bar until our table was ready. Soon after we ordered our drinks, the hostess came by to seat us.\n\nI was happy to see that they had a selection of Japanese beers, which you don't see much around. I ordered the Hitachino White Ale. Great beer, very clean and refreshing.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers to share with the table. We started off dinner with a their signature dish, Big Eye Tuna Pizza. This is thinly sliced tuna on top of a very thin crunchy piece of flatbread (similar to a wonton chip). Next we had the Lobster Carpaccio. This was probably the best dish of the night. Thinly sliced pieces of lobster in a ponzu sauce. This is a must order. A good hot appetizer was the Tempura Alaskan King Crab. Bite sized pieces of Alaskan King crab deep fried in a tempura batter. We then ordered various pieces of nigri sushi for the table. The fish was definitely fresh."

            "review": "On a weekender to Vegas, my gf and I were hungering for sushi one night and the concierge of our hotel (Monte Carlo) suggested going to Yellowtail, the newest restaurant at the Bellagio.  Only open a week,  one might expect some hiccups along the way, but the food was top notch and the service was even more so.\n\nThe outside entrance signals the restaurant's presence with a beautifully decorated, massive glass tile mosaic of a yellowtail fish.  Indoors, posh, elegant, with clean yet comfortable lines in a contemporary style. \n\nSeated at the bar (since we had no reservation), the service didn't slack one bit as our bar waitress was more than knowledgeable, explaining the vast menu choices and offering helpful suggestions on what to order.   Despite the busy atmosphere of having to juggle bar mixology and restaurant patrons, she checked up on us often and made us feel comfortable.  \n\nFood wise, my best description for this dining experience would be - sushi fusion.  Combining East and West sensibilities into sushi produced some unique flavor combinations that I've never tasted before.  I'm not talking about your typical California roll here.  Think banana flavored sake, strawberry topped rolls in place of unagi, Big Eye Tuna Pizza with shiso, Toro Sashimi with caviar and microgreens.  The crab dynamite was delicious with generous chunks of crab meat, and a hint of spiciness. \n\nOne of their signature selections is the Grand Omikase, a six course tasting menu based on the chef's* fancy that day.  I would highly recommend this, as it's the most bang for the buck, and you get to taste a vast array of flavors.  Kobe beef fans will be satisfied as this includes  Washu beef (a domestic breed of Kobe) offered in a tenderloin cut; a texture that just melted in my mouth.\n\nSome might think sushi fusion is a bastardization against tradition, but I think it's fun.  Why not try something new?  Your palate might thank you for it.\n\n\n*(Head chef, Akira Back, has worked with industry greats such as chefs Nobu and Morimoto.)"

In both visits, a group of 3 to 5 of us had reservations. However, we had to wait an hour to be seated. During my most recent visit, the manager even had the nerve to say, \"We're waiting for you. Are you ready?\", after we sat at the bar for an hour (I checked in with the hostess several times). I was close to punching him where he stood.\n\nThe food was poor quality for the price. We ordered a couple of rolls and were told that they take more time than other menu items. Ummmm. . . . that doesn't make sense. You don't have to cook anything for the rolls we ordered. However, we theorized that they had to catch the fish first . . . . in Japan.\n\nIt's sad that this place is in the Bellagio, a high-quality resort.

Just get it.  That's all I'm going to say.\n\nSecondly, ask for the patio.  It lays directly over the Bellagio fountains and provides an amazing special occasion experience, especially for newcomers to impress.  Otherwise, the inside area has a more bustling, active ambiance.\n\nIn addition to the pizza and the patio, I'd also recommend ordering the miso glazed cod which is not on the menu for some reason.  Although it is not as good as the original (Nobu), it's definitely up there, albeit a too-small portion.\n\nMy only gripe would be the less-than-sweet (I'm being nice here) hostesses, which is why I'm only giving four stars.  Yea, less attitude would be appreciated.  The servers are awesome, however.  \n\nI'll be back."

The atmosphere, view and service was well worth the  $400 something dollar bill. \nAlso the food presentation was very nice as well I didn't take any pics because that is very tacky to do at a place like this. \n\nSo overall it was a good experience, but I think I'll stick to my small hole in the wall sushi joints."

Didn't get a chance to try it until now, and the results aren't impressive...\n\nThe wait wasn't too bad; around 10 minutes for 5 on a Saturday night so a few members of our party decided to go play some blackjack while they waited. While they were gone, we were seated and placed our drink orders. A few moments after our entire party returned, yet neither the waitress nor the sake attendant could be bothered to acknowledge their arrival or take their drink orders. Pretty tacky...\n\nThe service didn't get much better from there. Sake came quickly, but anything from the bar took way too long without any explanation. When we finally ordered our food, our waitress missed two of the items, most of our 2nd round of drinks and then checked in on us very infrequently. I suppose to her credit, she admitted her shortcomings and offered us a free dessert, but it would have been nicer had she just been on her game from the beginning. \n\nThe food wasn't much better. Sushi was an embarrassment. Ordered a lobster roll; the lobster was alright, but the mango was nowhere to be found and the roll was simply too small to justify the price. The toro was nowhere near as delicious as toro should be and I'm not sure there was actually any wasabi on the nigiri. \n\nThe hot food does deserve a little praise. The rock shrimp in a korean chili sauce was very tasty, although the sauce made the shrimp on the bottom of the bowl a bit soggy.  The kobe tartar and kobe filet were the highlights of the meal, but again...way too small for nearly $40 a plate.\n\nI'm aware it's the Bellagio, so obviously things are going to be a bit higher then an off-strip place, but that's not an excuse to rip people off and you better have your execution down. This wasn't the case at all, so it deserves no more then two stars. If you're on this part of the strip looking for good sushi, I'd recommend Sushi Roku across the street at Caesars."

I live in Southern Cal and some of the best sushi I've had has been in the LA area i.e. Sasabune, Mori etc. But I'll simplify to specifics:\n\nService:\nSucks...lots of staff running around serving people with way too much money and food takes forever.  \n\nSushi:\nWe tried the bigeye tuna pizza and I guess it was decent...nothing to call home about. As for the sushi...I never knew they could cut sushi so thin and charge so much money.  I don't mind spending money on sushi but throw me a bone and at least make it hearty!? I can't believe they call themselves a sushi joint. I guess Bellagio can get away with charging that much for people that don't want to leave the hotel. The rolls were tiny and mediocre tasting. Usually my wife and I are fighting for the last piece but at Yellowtail we were fine leaving the overpriced food.\n\nAmbiance:\nI kept reading about being sat by the fountains which is why I chose the place. But the first thing you see on the site \"patio seating is very limited and you are not guaranteed a spot\" Well figures...when we walked in it was packed and we got seated in the middle area which basically defeated the whole purpose of us eating there. It's basically a club that serves sushi.\n\nSummary:\nA white washed sushi joint for people with too much money.  Lesson learned...Vegas is not the place for sushi...should have listened to the other reviewers. I wish I would have spend my time and money at a restuarant like Joel Rubichon or Bouchons or even just the buffet.  Won't go back. I spent $190 for an appetizer 2 drinks, a couple rolls and a couple pieces of mediocre sushi. I have to give it one star of the cost of food and not meeting our expectations."

You get what you pay for, this Yellowtail considers reasonable compare to other sushi spots on this strip! P.S. try the cucumber and ginger cocktails when you get a chance!"

I booked the reservation online, and was very satisfied.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were seated right away.  Our server was attentive and courteous for the duration of the meal.\n\nOrder three appetizers: the standard edamame and gyoza (particularly delicious) and Alaskan King Crab tempura (our server's recommendation).  Other than looking like tater-tots, the tempura was very good.  My rolls were amazing: the yellowtail scallion (made sense to order the namesake) and the Rock Shrimp handroll.  Boyfriend's special lobster/tuna concoction was not worth the price.  Spicy tuna was good.\n\nAs others have said, liquor prices are ridiculous.  While the prices for the rolls were generally reasonable (around $15), the cheapest carafe of sake was $35.  Stupid."

We ordered pomegranate martinis, glasses of riesling & sauvingonm blanc, also some sake. Mixed drinks r much better than the wine.

We were looking for a great place to take our customers after long meetings during the day and Yellowtail seemed like the beat choice after pieros and Spago on previous nights.\n\nWe ordered based off recommendations from our waitress. During dinner we realized that a lot of the food seemed familiar. Nobu! We actually ate at Nobu in Manhattan a few weeks before. The crab calamari, sashimi with jalapenos were very memorable from Nobu and were nearly identical to what Yellowtail offered. Not sure if there is any affiliation but we were joking that we found the second nobu branch in las vegas.\n\nBesides those dishes the sushi was well prepared but the cuts and taste of some of the fish itself wasn't the greatest."

They were actually on the food network for their crab. The sushi is very fresh and all the other food I had (rock shrimp tempura, Chilean sea bass, and ankimo) were all delicious. The restaurant is expensive, but the location is why. Food is great too. Would recommend going."

The soft shell crab was delicious and so was the yellowtail roll.  \n\n     For a refreshing cocktail, try the Sunset.  It is made with grey goose, blood orange pure and yuzu.  For something sweet and bubbly, the sparkling infused blueberry sake is amazing.  This restaurant is just as good for large groups as it is for a small intimate dinner.  But if you would like to take advantage of its location overlooking the famous fountains on the eight acre lake, make sure to request a table by the window or even outside on the patio."

Food was exquisitely prepared and very tasty.  Sake / wine / beverage sommelier was really over the top and an aggressive up-seller, not appreciated.  Service was sporadic and they forgot our edamame order.  Portions could be larger, but every bite is delicious. The quality of the food helped counterbalance the negatives.

We saw a bottle of Yellowtail (the name of the restaurant but also the crappy Australian wine you can buy at our corner Ghetto Mart for $7) for $48!  Using that as our baseline, and knowing next to nothing about wine, we ordered a bottle of $70 wine thinking it would be at least decent, and it wasn't.  \n\nThe terrible wine almost ruined an otherwise great dinner."

The hostess tells us she'll have a table for us in 20 minutes. Great, we go to the bar.  35 minutes later I go back to check in and a different hostess tells me it will probably be another 15 minutes. Meanwhile the place is at least 1/3 empty. They're probably trying to create that fake buzz that the restaurant is more popular than it actually is. Annoying, but I guess that's part of Vegas. At one point the bartender even asked us \"You guys are STILL waiting for a table?\" When we said yes, he actually went up to the hostess stand on our behalf. Not sure that it did much, but we were appreciative all the same.\n\nAfter waiting for about 45 minutes in a 1/3 empty restaurant we finally get seated. The decor of this place is nice, I'll give it that. One of the few redeeming qualities of Yellowtail.  We're seated by the window facing the fountain show outside The Bellagio. Nice setting. Unfortunately things went down from there.\n\nWe ask to start with some edamame and the King Crab Dynamite starter. Then we order a couple different rolls and a few types of nigiri sushi. The starter arrives (the edamame never actually showed up) and within 2 minutes all the rolls and sushi were on the table. Shouldn't you have at least 5-10 minutes minimum to eat your starter before the rest of your meal is being hustled to the table? The restaurant at this point is probably 1/2 empty.  It wasn't like they had to turn over the table quickly for other waiting guests.\n\nIt's not even worth rehashing exactly what type of rolls and sushi we ordered because it was all pretty poor, as was the crab starter. The quality of the fish here is equal to what you get in those pre-packaged Safeway sushi trays. No lie, it's on that same level. Certainly not what I expected given the decor of the restaurant and the exorbitant prices. We were ready to drop some $$$ for a good meal. We certainly dropped the $$$, but Yellowtail didn't deliver on the good meal.\n\n2 Large Sapporo's, 2 glasses of champagne ($30 total), King Crab Starter, 2 rolls, 6 total pieces of Nigiri cost $170!! $170 and I left hungry.\n\nMy advice for anyone thinking of going to Yellowtail... instead go to Safeway, buy a few of those pre-packaged sushi trays, a 6 pack of Sapporo and a bottle of champagne and take it back to your room. Same quality food and to complete the effect, you can even make yourself wait 45 minutes to eat it. And the best part is that you'll have an extra $120 in your pocket to spend in Vegas."

Our server, Roberto, did a spectacular job - I have never had such amazing service ever. He also made some excellent recommendations such as with the sake selection \"Wandering Poet\" - a fine balance between dry and sweet at a fair price.\nOur entree was an usual order of spicy tuna roll, bluefin tuna sashimi style, and some whitefish. The ribs came highly recommended so we decided to give it a go as well. I'm not going to lie but I was pretty disappointed and felt like I just got ripped off for a mere handful of meat chunks. Like, seriously? 4 pieces of beef for ~$30?! Of course, this IS Vegas and the quality you get is definitely noticeable, no complaints there.\nFor dessert we moved to the balcony with a perfect timing - the water show! The view was awesome and we enjoyed the green tea mousse which came with a shot of coffee  on the side. Really superb combo.\nDefinitely give Yellowtail a try when you're in the area!\nPS keep in mind this meal may take a chunk out of your wallet."

Originally we planned to get a few cocktails, but had a little bit of sticker shock when we found that the martinis were $20. We ordered the yellowtail sashimi and the big eye tuna that everyone seemed to be raving about. Both were delicious, but they were $30 each. Normally I wouldn't think much of that. I'm a strong believer that you get what you pay for, and when it comes to raw fish, you want high quality. But I felt a little ripped off when I discovered that the same exact appetizers were served at other restaurants within the Bellagio for around $18. This experience alone would have caused me to rate this establishment at three stars. The reason I've opted for two was the service. I had to order several things numerous times since our waitress seemed to keep forgetting. When I ordered the big eye tuna, I also placed an order of standard salmon sashimi. After finishing the big eye tuna, I had to remind my waitress of the salmon sashimi. It took at additional 15 minutes to receive my sushi. No apologies, no discount. Nothing. It appears that this establishment is more interested in hiring for looks rather than talent. Save your money and go somewhere else."

The presentation was beautiful and the dressings were subtle, not cutting into the glorious stand-alone flavor of the fish itself.\n\nfoie gras torchon - two slices of foie gras with a nicely sized scallop, and an oyster. break it down! - I would have liked to see the foie gras seared, but that's ok, that's ok, it was still a decadent heap of fatty goodness that dissolved on my tongue bite after bite. The oyster was perfectly cooked, which is to say, nearly not cooked on the inside. It was fresh and delicious, but I could lose the weird crunchy balls that had been sprinkled no the top. Nearly ruined it for me. And lastly the japanese oyster sitting in the middle off the plate was to die for. Meaty, fresh and not fish. It didn't taste horrendously like the sea. It was covered in watery, salty juices. It was just a clean, fat, oyster.\n\nToro and scallion roll - there's not much to say. They make this everywhere because it's a classic and it works. The fish was good, the rice was good, it was a solid roll, But not if you're looking for something special.\n\nUni sushi- Since this is synonymous with awesome, there is nothing more I can say.\n\nAnd the Bellagio is such a beautiful and romantic place.

So the incredibly lethargic speed of our server was uncalled for.  \n\nNot going to lie, I will not eat sushi in Vegas again...unless someone else is fronting that bill. HAHAHA. I am so cheap..."

            "review": "I really enjoyed eating at Yellowtail.  The menu provides many different options.  From raw sushi and rolls to hot dishes.  I ordered the popping spicy crab from the sushi side of the menu.  It was amazing!  They put pop rocks candy inside the roll!  From the hot side of the menu, I ordered the rock shrimp and the tempura Alaskan king crab.  Both were excellent.  Service was good.  The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and the food took no time to get to our table.  Another great bonus yellowtail offers is their outdoor patio.  The patio sits right on the water where the Bellagio fountains sit and every 15 minutes the fountains go on and display a spectacular water show.  Since I was with my wife, it made our time at Yellowtail very romantic and overall, I had an amazing experience!  I strongly recommend having dinner at Yellowtail if your ever in Las Vegas!"

            "review": "This review is for the sushi only. \n\nI understand people not wanting to pay the price of high quality sushi - it's expensive, I get it. But it's truly a culinary experience. When you get good fish, cut with artistry and finesse, served well in a beautiful setting, then it's a price worth paying. \n\nI absolutely love sushi. I've had good and bad experiences all over the globe. This, while not in my #1 slot, it does make the top 5. The cuts are perfect. Thick,  uniform, and precisely sized. The fish itself melts in your mouth, as it should. The edamame was crisp, and well seasoned (I didn't care for the chili seasoning, but my husband did). The seaweed salad was perfectly prepared. \n\nDrinks: I started with an infusion. A pineapple sake cocktail. Probably one of the most dangerous drinks on the planet. So good! The sake selection is extensive and will take another visit to explore more throughly, but impressive nonetheless. \n\nService: Our waiter was triple sat with us (party of 2), a party of 7, and a party of 10. Come on guys, that's just not fair. But in our servers defense, he handled it expertly. He asked for help from other staff when he was overwhelmed and the support staff always stopped to refill our glasses or clear the plates. To someone who doesn't notice those sorts of things, it would have been seamless. To me it was server perfection. Well done! \n\nAtmosphere: This is a nice get away from the bustle of the casino. You can't hear the commotion from the dining area and the views of the fountains are spectacular! It's a beautiful setting and quite conducive to an enjoyable evening. The music is quiet, yet enjoyable and the decor is hip and trendy, yet elegant and well executed. \n\nIn conclusion, I'm sad that yellowtail doesn't get better reviews. While I only enjoyed the sushi on this visit, I would be willing to try more. Including the chefs choice menu with 7 courses and a sake pairing! \n\nWell done over all, Yellowtail. A specific thank you to Chef Akira Back and your team!"

The seafood is top quality and the service at the bar was on par with the food. Like any restaurant there will be things you will like and not like. I have a feeling that there will be few things at Yellow Tail that I would not like. The view of the dancing fountain out front is the \"cherry on top\" of high class ambience.\n\nDon't expect large portions. The food served here is carefully and delicately crafted. Take your time and enjoy every bite and you will be satisfied. If you are looking to hobble out of yellowtail with your belt loosened, then you have the wrong idea. While the prices were high (all Bellagio restaurants are high priced) this was one of the few places that earned their high price. Some have said that this is overrated, my experience did not disappoint and I look forward to going back every time I come to Vegas."

We love sushi - there are a lot of GREAT sushi places in SD so we had high expectations of this place.  First the choice of sushi rolls were super basic and boring.  Nothing creative or even remotely enticing.  We started with the seafood ceviche.  The portion size was a joke.  Seriously, I'm guessing that we were served about a half cup of ceviche with 5 or 6 wonton chips.  Not off to a great start.  Then we ordered 3 different rolls to share - all 3 were bland, boring and super small.  After a very disappointing meal, we then get the check and see that the Rainbow roll that we ordered was $30.  Are you kidding me??  Take my advice and find another sushi restaurant."

It was a pretty swanky place so I had some high hopes.\n\nThe server was really nice, but she accidentally gave us someone else's bill on top of ours... \n\nFOOD\n1) Tempura fried king crab appetizer\n2) Red snapper sushi\n3) Shrimp tempura roll\n4) Salmon sashimi\n5) Angry salmon roll\n6) Toro scallion roll\n\nThe TEMPURA FRIED KING CRAB was fantastic. I wish we just ordered a few of those instead of the sushi and sashimi. The crab itself was juicy and the tempura was perfectly crisp and crunchy. The dish tasted so good with the ponzu sauce! The scallions were a great finishing touch because they added that final subtle zing to the dish.\n\nThe SUSHI and SASHIMI were both mediocre at best. The rolls were small and they weren't that creative. The only good thing about the sashimi was that it was presented in the shape of a rose, but it wasn't the best sashimi I've ever had.\n\nOverall, Yellowtail is overrated and overpriced. I feel like I had better sushi at Ichiban in the basement of Bally's for 1/10th of the price."

They don't mention the prices and beware it's in the $35-40 range per ounce.  It's heavenly but way too expensive.\n\nThey have a Kobe-like flat iron steak for $42 on their everyday menu so it gives the impression the special Kobe will be prices in the same range - NOT.  \n\nLastly, check the bill carefully.  They will offer to room charge it, but be sure to take a look - in error on our bill was three orders of some lobster roll that no on ordered - plus the surprise of the outrageous Kobe - even the waitress and the manager did not know agree on the price per ounce ($35-$42).  \n\nBeware!"

There are a few tables that are situated next to the French doors with a view of the Bellagio water show. You can also request, in advance to be seated on terrace outside, which a few brave couples did, in 40 degree temps!\nI love the rock shrimp, the tempura crab, the filet and also the black cod. What I have found in the past as well as this visit is that the sushi here just doesn't cut it for me. They have a good variety and it seems fresh and the choices are pretty much on par with other locations. However, if I were to close my eyes, pick a piece, I would not be able to distinguish the rolls. They all seem to taste the same to me here. Nothing in the sushi selection stands out for me. The winners are the starters and the main entree's here, and are quite good. Also very shareable."

Have three additional dish recommendations in addition to those in the first review.\n\n- Crispy Kalbi. This dish has a center of Korean short ribs and uses slaw, rather than rice, as the outer layer.  Yep, you read that right.  No need to grab your Grandmother's glasses; I said slaw.  Trust me (famous last words.)  ;-)  But really, trust me.\n\n- Broiled Atlantic Black Cod.  OMG, and I mean OMG! Any attempt to describe the taste of this menu item will fall short.  The fish is firm, yet pulls apart easily and I would ask that this be the last item to be served during the meal.  A perfect punctuation mark to an experience that has been building in taste and texture.  The chopsticks were clicking as we attacked the dish like a school of Amazonian pira\u00f1as.\n\nI would replace the Filet Mignon Toban with one of the above.\n\n- Rock Shrimp Hand Roll.  I would order this rather than the Baked Crab Hand Roll.  Both are good, but the Rock Shrimp Hand Roll takes it over the top.\n\nHappy eating!"

The restaurant was beautiful and the view of the Bellagio fountains impressive.\n\nBut here's the bottom line: at approximately $60/person (including tax and tip), guests should be leaving pleasantly full and impressed with the cuisine.  We left already planning our late night snack and absolutely unimpressed with anything that Yellowtail had to offer.\n\nTheir flagship item, the  Big Eye Tuna Pizza was good, but somewhat bland.  We also liked the Edamame Two Ways: Sea Salt and Sweet Chili.  Everything else we ordered was pretty uninteresting, and I've had far better at any number of sushi bars in LA at 1/3 the price.\n\nWe had a bland Yellowtail Scallion roll, a lame Spicy Tuna roll, a very fishy Mackerel with Shiso that I couldn't even eat, very average pork Gyoza, and a fairly tasty Seared Albacore with Onion, Crispy Shitake Mushrooms and Chili Sesame.\n\nI don't mind dropping some coin on a great meal, and I am even OK with the concept that I might have to pay a premium for dining at the Bellagio (although I doubt I ever will again, after this meal), but heck...do I have to leave hungry too?"

It's definitely elegantly designed and does its job in attracting the hip/beautiful crowd but I can't say it's any different than the other Nobu ripoffs you see in town.  We got the traditional sashimi dishes, the yellowtail serrano and the hirame usuzukuri, and thought both were ok.  They didn't have as extensive of a sushi selection as I anticapted which really surprised me, considering being in the Bellagio, and to make matters worse, they were out of two of my favorites uni and mirugai.  Not having abalone on the menu is excusable but really disappointed me as well.  I tried the strawberry roll out of curiousity and was surprised that flavor combo of fruit and spicy tuna tasted actually alright together (props to being bold).  The two pluses for the night were the miso soup of all things (which really tasted more like a fish stock soup) and our sommelier Yukiko.  Yukiko was super friendly and after politely asking what type of sake we liked, she paired us with a real nice Daiginjo from the Murai Family.  I highly recommend this bottle. It's good to see that they have the sake segment of their restaurant in the right hands.  I read another reviewers remarks about the wine list being bad but I've always thought wine with sushi was weird anyways...just stick with sake and beer.\n\nMaking reservations is a must and pricing is in the Nobu neighborhood.  If you can, try to get a seat outside on their patio which allows you to watch the water show.  Although the hostess are definitely attractive, you're not missing much in terms of decor on the inside."

The entrance to the restaurant is rather narrow with bar setup, but once you walk past the bar, the place opens up to a nice and spacious dining area.\n\nOne of my buddies was quite intoxicated when we were seated, and he started asking so many questions about how the food is prepared and what goes into each dish on the menu to our server.  My other friend and I were amused, so we didn't interrupt and we really appreciated our server's patience and also his professionalism. \n\nAbout half way through our meal, another server started serving our table. When this talkative friend asked her to surprise him with a good glass of wine, she brought him one of the most expensive wines (as the rest of us suspected!) on their menu (~$30), but this wine tasted merely ok, not great. \n\nI had sushi rolls and it was very mediocre tasting. Presentation also was OK. I expected more and better food for fine-dining for the money I was paying. \n\nIf you really don't care much about food or price, this place offers modern and well polished environment with good cocktails. But alas, you are in Vegas, the place full of many great fine dining places that could offer the same level of ambience and cocktails. \n\nAlthough I realize if you are in Vegas to party the hard way, the food might not be your main concern... in which case, what are you doing, wasting your time reading this review!"

The server explained that the chef's mother used to put candy in his rolls to get him to eat them and that's how he developed the concept. \n\nThe angry salmon roll ($16) was also quite good.  Just the right amount of spice. The sashimi was also excellent.  We tried the yellowtail serrano ($23) and the Shikoku octopus ($23).  There are some Korean influences, such as onion and corn in the seafood dynamite ($23).  I never really liked dynamite anything - covering perfectly good food in mayo or cream cheese is just not my thing.\n\nThey have a great Woollaston Estates Sauvignon Blanc by the glass ($12).  A 20oz bottle of Kirin was $12.  The service was impeccable.  Nice view of the fountains from the back dining room, but you can see those from the strip for free. Also a nice view of the casino and the crazy tourists from the front, which is much more interesting. I recommend checking this place out."

High end or not there is an art to cutting sushi.\n\nOur meal:\n\n'Sushi'\nHamachi - VERY good, best part of my meal, but again, each slice was about the size of my pinky\nTuna - quality of the meat was good but the meat was butchered to the likes of which I've never seen and again, the slices were about the size of my pinky.\n\n'Entree'\nSea Bass - for the price we were a bit surprised to only receive a piece about the size of one and one half golf balls, we were told it was large enough to share; it was good.\n\n'Rolls'\nThis is more of where the major disappointment came in. The rolls were very small and basically fell apart upon touching. I'm no sushi expert but I believe the rice is the portion of a roll that the chef takes the most pride in\n\nHamachi roll - fish was SUPER fresh but it again was butchered and appeared to be more of the left overs than a fresh cut of meat meant to be placed in a roll.\n\nShrimp tempura roll - there was very little 'tempura' to the roll and it felt as though the shrimp was split in half to fill an already tiny roll.\n\nGyoza - Not that it was bad but I mean its Gyoza and I've had better at Ramen shops. \n\nMy wife had a lychee martini that was pretty damn good and they have plenty of beers/wines/sake on hand. Not listed is a warm sake which is decent and cheap at $18. \n\nI think the lesson to be learned here is that just because you charge more than market prices for your food that doesnt mean you're a high-end restaurant. There is a sushi joint 2 blocks from my house across the street from an auto parts store that could teach the chefs here a few lessons on preparation, the proportions are larger, the fish is of equal quality, and the prices are a little less. I'm not trying to harp on price here, I go to Vegas knowing Im paying more for everything.\n\nWe were never offered tea, no edamame which at least to me seems to be a default appetizer when you visit a sushi restaurant. No Ahi Poke on the menu but I didnt ask and they do have a Ahi tartare if I remember correctly, no chicken karage, and I dont even recall a side salad with the awesome miso dressing 99.9% of sushi restaurants offer.\n\nAgain, the food was NOT bad, the services was good, the ambiance was elegant but it felt more like a steakhouse trying to be a sushi spot. I would like to visit again and hopefully I'll be able to give another star. \n\nI would recommend checking it out for yourself if you're really craving sushi and have a couple hundred to blow. It's an experience and maybe they just had an off night. \n\nMy personal opinion is that I'll try a couple more Sushi joints before returning here."

Yellowtail greets you with scantily clad exotic waitresses (this is Vegas after all) and you eat your small portioned Japanese gastro pub dishes while endless techno club music pounds in the background. While eating Japanese food in this manner isn't really my style, and holding a conversation at a table larger than two was rather difficult, Yellowtail did leave my tastebuds popping with pleasure from a few select dishes. One minus was that the food took a while to come out. It's a truly one of a kind place from which to view the Bellagio fountain show. They have a balcony you can watch from, and you're on the side of the Bellagio right up in the action - I could feel a slight mist from the shooting water!\n\nMy favorites:\n\nSeaweed salad: The seaweed was fresh, with two different kinds, and the sauce was tangy and refreshing.\n\nSalmon and sweet shrimp sashimi: The salmon was a more expensive cut than you usually get, a darker orange salmon with more punchy flavor. I've had sweeter ones, but these shrimp were up there and fresh. The heads were fried to perfection, and you could eat 100% of the fried shell. Crunchy!\n\nBig eye tuna pizza: Now here's something innovative and unique. You're getting fusion cuisine at its best, with thinly slice tuna sashimi laid on top of thin cracker style crust, with truffle flavors and small garnish tying it all together in a savory finish. This was a wonderful surprise and really got my umami on. I loved the pairing of the truffle with tuna sashimi and the crunchy texture of the crust to offset the soft raw fish.\n\nProtein roll: We tried a few rolls and this was by far the head of the class. It's called the protein roll because there's no rice! A well seasoned seafood and fish egg mix is wrapped inside layers of fresh sashimi. The roll disappeared in seconds, and one of our party didn't even get to try a piece! Oops.\n\nOther things we tried:\n\nThe Kobe beef tataki was pretty good; the texture of the raw beef was phenomenal, as it was fresh Kobe, and you could see the delicate marbling in the meat. However it seemed a waste to drown it in a soy sauce based sauce, with raw garlic slices as garnish, since they are both very strong flavors and high quality beef should be worshipped instead of overpowered.\n\nThe Alaskan king crab tempura was apparently featured on Best Things I Ever Ate with Chopsticks. I thought that it was good, and the sauce was savory and tangy, but it didn't seem like anything special enough for a TV show. How could something fried like that be bad? Seems a shame for fresh crab.\n\nWe tried some other rolls, but none else were memorable. The vegetable tempura was nothing special, the rock shrimp tempura had a mayo-y spicy sauce and was good, but like something from a seriously upscale Buffalo Wild Wings."

The rolls were basic, the miso cod was so small....I mean, I knew we weren't going to get a big piece of fish, but what we got was VERY small!\nOur waiter was friendly enough, although he brought us the bill without removing the item we sent back.....was it on purpose?...Probly not, but when someone is spending $400, don't try and throw in extra stuff on the bill....\nThe hostess was a biatch! Yes, we showed up late for our reservation, but at 9pm telling someone that there would be no more tables for the rest of the night on the patio.....really? She just gave us attitude the entire time......\nVegas is a customer service mecca, or so it should be.....Yellowtail, I may be back for that pizza and cocktails...but that is it....Social has far better sushi!"

The best part was that we literally tried just about everything on the menu. \n\nOur flight got to Vegas at 9, we were at our villa by 915 and we called and asked for 36 oysters to be ready for us because we were starving. When we arrived they sat us right away and had the oysters ready in minutes! They were so delicious we ordered a second batch. \n\nAll the sushi was fresh and delicious (you can see in the pictures I posted), the lobster was really amazing (I actually don't even like lobster to begin with so I was pleasantly surprised when I was going back for seconds) Even the lobster tempura was good, it literally melts in your mouth. \n\nWe also had the most AMAZING bottle of wine. It was $1700, so normally we would never but since it was on the casino's dime, why not? I think it was called the Montrachet (I posted a picture of the bottle incase you wanted to try it) but it was the most expensive white wine they had. \n\nWe also tried one of everything on the desert menu, I'm not too crazy about sweets but the ice cream was pretty bomb. \n\nIt was a fun experience, honestly it is overpriced and pricey but you're in Vegas at the Bellagio so what do you expect? It's got a killer view if you're seated near the balcony so go let loose and have some FUN!"

Stay adventerious when ordering; you will be rewarded.\n\nThe majority of the dishes are made to be shared (although the portions are not too large that those dining alone will not have a decent selection).  \n\nThe tai (snapper) served sashimi style with EVOO and shiso is excellent.  The peppery edge of the oil enhances the sweetness of the fish.  The lobster carpaccio is amazing.  The sweetness of the lobster and the onion play off each other beautifully and offers the perfect textural contrast.  Finally, the kobe beef tataki is an absolute must try.  Roll up the paper thin slice around a sliver of garlic and spicy diakon pickle and pop it in your mouth.  It's amazing how the bold flavor of the garlic is washed away by the fat of the beef as it melt in your mouth.\n\nFor warm plates, top props to the \"Seafood Dynamite\".  Lightly broiled king crab and rock shrimp dressed in a spicy yet not cloying citrus aioli; delicious.\n\nThe nigiri sushi is all very high quality but boring when compared to the inventive speciality rolls.  The \"Popping Spicy Crab\" is a serious must try.  Crab, spicy aioli, cucumber, asparagus, and POP ROCKS!  Just try it.\n\nService is excellent.\n\nThe wine / sake list is very good with well chosen selections by the glass.  Prices are high (remember, you're at the Bellagio).\n\nHighly Recommended."

I managed to do so, but I will say that we ended up ordering more \"non-sushi\" items than we had intended here, and that was fine.\n\nFrom their hot and cold plates menu, we ended up with four things. Our Bigeye Tuna pizza came recommended, and was quite good. The tasty thin sliced tuna was \"glued\" to flat bread with something - creamy, and neutral, maybe a creamy cheese? That particular ingredient wasn't listed on the menu. The whole thing was topped with drizzled truffle oil, which I frankly could have done without. The more I am exposed to truffle, the more I think the smell is offensive. It's too powerfully earthy, almost a rotting smell, to me at least, and while the taste is not as strong as the smell, it tends to overwhelm my nose, and thus my sense of taste. But this was still good, my anti-truffle campaign aside. The sliced octopus in jalapeno vinaigrette was...fine, but unremarkable. The octopus was tasty, but the vinaigrette needed some more punch. I didn't find much jalapeno in it.\n\nFrom the hot side of the menu, our tempura king crab was awesome - light batter, flavorful tender crab meat, tossed in a sweet/hot sauce. So delicious, and probably the highlight of the prepared plates. The seafood dynamite was also good, served in a cast pan with corn and mushrooms. Kind of an interesting take, with plenty of chunked seafood. Also worth ordering.\n\nFor sushi, we ended up with their popping spicy crab roll - how can you resist a sushi roll with pop rocks? This is gimmicky, but also very good. I liked the crunch of the pop rocks (and the pop) along with the soft crab and crisp cucumber. Their spicy tuna roll was good - heavy on tuna, not just spicy mayo like I've had at some places. And the toro scallion roll had some of the best toro I've had to date. Super tender and flavorful. The scallions did not overpower like I thought they might.\n\nI also had my standard seaweed salad, which here is a mix of fresh and pickled seaweed, for a nice change of pace. Really enjoyable.\n\nService was good, prices are...well, I'd say normal, but not absurd for Vegas. The restaurant looks out over the Bellagio fountain, so if you get a good table, you've got a great view. Even from the middle of the room, we found ourselves stopping conversation to watch the thing go off. Cliched though it may be, it's still really cool, every time I see it.\n\nHere's to another successful sushi meal in Vegas - 3 for 3. Of note, dress code here is \"casual\" for sure. One of us saw a man enter the bar wearing a bear costume (which included fake abs and a furry hat with bear ears) underneath a suit. So yeah. Wear those sneakers without fear."

Service was good up until the food was served and then our waitress completely forgot about us and didn't come back to check in on us or to give us our bill.  The pros though are they do offer a variety of fresh sushi - try the rock shrimp and crab hand rolls, yellow tail tataki, and flavored edamames.  Portions are small and meant to be shared.  The prices are high but it's assumed since it's in the Bellagio."

We get there and it was packed, so we decided to sit at the bar, where there were some seats. \n\nService in the beginning was spectacular, really nice bartenders, suggesting what is good on the menu.  I wanted everything on the menu but it was a bit pricey so had to be selective. \n\nTheir edamame app is unique as it comes with two bowls of edamame one tradition with the salt, and one with a sweet chili sauce. Both were fantastic and just the right thing to have before the sushi.  Next up, Miso soup - delicious!! \n\nI had ordered sushi, along with my two other friends, and figured it would be up after the apps.  It was a long wait for the first round of sushi for my friends, and even longer for me :( They had forgotten about my order and somehow the sushi chefs never got it! The bartender (our server) was trying to figure out what happened.  He gave us a round of drinks on the house to apologize.  \n\nPersonally, I was not even that mad even with him apologizing so many times, and him saying this was not acceptable to their restaurant.  I was just happy to be in Vegas an having a good time.  Yeah, it did suck that my wait was really long. Never had to wait that long before in my life.  Hopefully in the future that does not happen with anyone else.  Once I finally got my sushi roll, Shrimp Tempura type I think it was, it was delicious and so happy it was good for me waiting so long. \n\nI would want to try this restaurant out again but at a table next time and not the bar :)"

Our server I believe his name was Seth he was incredible, very knowledgeable on all of the wines and dishes he is awesome!\nThis was my first experience with Sashimi, I love sushi rolls and never thought I would care for sashimi.\nI believe we had the halibut I could be wrong on this. We also had the yellowtail jalapeno, oysters all of these were amazingly good! We also got the big eye tuna pizza so delish! A real treat was the tempura king crab the sauce with it really complimented the crab. We also got the filet mignon that came out sizzling and it is finished on the table with a peppery sauce it. Last but not least we figured we needed a little carbs ;) so why not get a roll my Sister opted to get the protein roll and to our surprise it did not have rice it was filled with crab, and it was amazing! We kept debating on whether or not to get another because we were running short on time to make it to, \"O\". We came to a decision that we would go with another. Our server knew we were going to the show and we got our second serving fast. \nThe service was incredible not just Seth but everyone there! The food was amazing! By the way did I mention how amazing this restaurant is lol!"

We actually finished early and arrived at 8:30pm.  When we checked in, the hostess was able to seat us. Score!\n\nOur server was super nice and knowledgeable.  He recommended dishes and answered every question we had about the dishes. He also took his time- so even though the restaurant was busy, he didn't rush us.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n- Big Eye Tuna Pizza - this is one that the server recommended and oh-mah-gawd.  It was SO good.  The whole dish was light but filling.  The truffle and shiso complemented the tuna and crispy rice thing on the bottom.  YUM.\n- Salmon sushi - fresh and delicious.  I got several orders of this.  LOL\n- Ikura - my favorite ikura is from SugarFISH so I always compare ikura to theirs.  This was pretty close.  =)\n- Yellowtail Scallion Roll - I figured since I was at Yellowtail, I should order something with Yellowtail.  The roll was good- nothing special.\n\nWe just drank soda since we were buzzed playing at the tables. Total came out to $120 after tax and tip!  Not bad!\n\nAfter our dinner, our server told us we should go out to the balcony to watch the Bellagio water show.  It was nice to see the show from a different point of view (usually it's from the street), but I felt weird standing in the corner amongst the other patrons enjoying their dinner.  LOL.\n\nI definitely would come back (at least for that tuna pizza thing)."

My co-worker and I arrived to our party's reservation (of about ~12 people) late and ordered our entrees late, but that should mean that everyone else's entree orders should arrive on time, right?!?!  Wrong.\n\nWe had the Big Eye Tuna Pizza, Yellowtail Jalapeno, and Tempura Alaskan King Crab (which is supposedly highly praised by the Food Network).  I liked the tuna pizza, but mostly because I liked the truffle oil.  The yellowtail tasted odd to me but that could be that I'm not a fan of orange flavored things and it's sitting in a blood orange sauce.  Meh, I think it was just not for me.  I had high hopes for the crab tempura given our waiter's high praise for it, but it was lackluster and did not wow me at all.  Tasted exactly like what it sounds like.   :/  What's up with that Food Network?  I thought this was supposed to be good!\n\nGiven our lackluster appetizers, I was hoping our entrees would make up for it.  I had a taste of the High Steak Roll, Crispy Kalbi Roll, and Jidori Chicken and again... lackluster.  :c  I could only taste the A-1 sauce in my steak roll and mostly only mayo from the coleslaw on my kalbi roll.  The rolls were overly sauced making it hard to even taste anything else!  Luckily the chicken was not so bad, and actually quite tasty and tender.  Thank goodness. But despite the chicken, it didn't save this place from the mediocre food and long wait times!  \n\nThroughout dinner, everyone's food came out at various times so one or two people would get their food, while the other ten would sit there waiting.  And then another person gets their food 15 minutes later, while the other nine sit there waiting.  And then another one or two people would get their food 15 minutes later, while the other seven or eight people would sit there waiting... you get the idea.  By the time everyone's food came out and decided to order dessert, it took another half hour before it was brought out!  To the point, where we almost wanted to just call it quits and pay just to leave.  After having the dessert, it wasn't even worth the time we spent waiting... sigh.  It made the wait that much more terrible.  :c  This resulted in an 3.5+ hour, $$$$ mediocre dinner.  :c  Lots of thumbs down.  Waste of time and money if you ask me."

Both of these are cold plates and i could not get enough. We reordered these multiple times. The warm shared plates i enjoyed were the Black Code and Seafood Dynamite. Both were wonderfully balanced with many layers of flavor.\n\nWe ordered quite a bit of sushi and i am not sure now what all of it was. I had my standard Dragon Roll, Tempura Shrimp and then some of their specialty rolls. Fish was very fresh and the rolls were made well. All of it was good. I am not a dessert eater but the Chocolate in a Cup was excellent. Their Lava Cake is also good."

Between my other half and I, we ordered a couple of small plates and rolls and one entree to share. I'd say some were unique and delicious. The pop rock roll, oyster shooter, and big eye tuna pizza are a must. But otherwise I wouldn't spend so much money on Japanese food. Definitely overpriced."

A few more specific comments\n\n- on a busy night they do not give beepers or have any way of tracking you when your table is ready. So keep a watchful eye or they could skip you!\n- drinks at the bar are about $14 for cocktails (the kiwi one is tasty), to $12 for large Asahi. Reasonable for Vegas, but still on the high end.\n- Sushi rolls are pretty tasty, but be forewarned that they are SMALL. They roll them tight with not much rice. Not too much inside either. So while you may think a roll for $9 isn't that bad, you only get a small portion. So you must end up ordering more than you thought just to not be hungry an hour later.\n- Bill for my wife and I. We each ordered 2 rolls, plus some sashimi. 2 cocktails and one large beer, with tip came to $150. Luckily we charged it to our MGM room which has a 30% off promotion via Mastercard until January 31, 2009 - otherwise it was a complete rip.\n\nFood good\nAmbiance good\nService acceptable\nPrice excessive\n\nSimply for better and larger sushi (and cheaper), I suggest the sushi bar inside Caesar's Palace (next to Cleopatra's Barge)."

The quality of the sushi/sushi-mi was adequate, but I've had better Sushi experiences in Colorado thousands of miles from the ocean. Very small portions for very high prices, so you have to order 3x as much. Made the mistake of taking our waiter's recommendation of the tuna \"pizza\" which was little more than some thin slices of tuna on a burnt 8\" tortilla for $26. Saki prices STARTED at $30 for a tiny carafe and beers were $12 each for Sapporo and Asahi. Our bill, with just 2 beers 2 rolls, 3 two slice orders of sushi and the nasty Tuna Tortilla \"Pizza\" came out to just under $200 for the 2 of us. The food was ok, presentation was better, but the service left a lot to be desired. Later"

(Someone else paid...if I'd had to pay, I probably would cut off a star or two for it being overpriced and pretentious...as I am wont to do :-)\n\nMy friend and I shared lobster carpaccio, the tuna pizza (!!!!!!!FABULOUS!!!), Japanese snapper (!!!!YUM!!!), octopus sashimi, duck prosciutto (shockingly AMAZING, and I hate duck!!), tuna tataki, some kind of crispy pork roll, and another sushi roll that had pop rocks mixed into the rice (sounds weird, but was AMAZING!!). Every single thing was exceptional, but the ones I marked with exclamation points were pretty much orgasmically good. We had some good desserts, too.\n\nIt didn't hurt that everything was washed down with a sake flight featuring 6 different types of sake...plus a shot of some cucumber vodka cocktail they feature that was incredible. \n\nI'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 just because I can't in good conscience give a place this full of itself 5 stars.

This time around, we still loved three out of four of those aspects.  The food was delicious. The rolls are on the smaller side but the fish is very fresh and the seasoning is perfect. We had a split opinion about the popping crab roll. I personally did not enjoy the \"popping\" part as it felt like my rolls had sand in it, but the rest of the group loved it. The ambiance is still amazing. From the outside, the restaurant looks like a typical strip mall sushi place. Inside, however, it is gorgeous and very romantic. Service, unfortunately, was a bit underwhelming. We ordered our food and I, specifically, asked that we get the dynamite shared plate as an appetizer. However, our server decided that he'd bring the dynamite last, as he didn't want us to fill up on the mayo. Had he brought it up with us, we may have agreed. But he made that decision himself. Somehow, the vibe of the service felt as if they are doing is a favor by letting us done there. Other than that it was a delicious dinner. Next time, I'd probably try another place."

            "review": "So I went to Vegas this past weekend for my friend's birthday and we decided on Yellowtail for dinner. We wanted an elegant setting and a good range of choices. I was excited for dinner even before we got to Vegas! I knew it would be fairly expensive and portion size wouldn't be all that filling. But damn! \n\nMy friend ordered the Scottish Salmon and asked the waiter approximately how large the fillets would be and he said \"two pieces of salmon equal to about 7oz.\" and then he gave us a visual of the two fillets and motioned them being placed on the plate \"boom, boom\" he said for each piece of salmon. When her dish came out, we were looking at it in dismay. This did not look like a \"BOOM BOOM\" but more like a \"bing bing!\" Boy, was that microscopic. I tasted some. The texture of the salmon wasn't bad, not too dry. However, my taste buds don't fancy sour marinade so I didn't really enjoy it. But hey, \"one man's trash is another man's treasure.\"\n\nMy other friend ordered the Braised Kobe Beef Short Ribs. The texture and taste was quite succulent. The beef was tender and juicy. The only thing wrong was that it was the size of one of the salmon fillets. \n\nAnother friend ordered the Big Eye Tuna Pizza and the Popping Spicy Crab Roll. The pizza was alright. Thinly sliced tuna on top of a thin cracker-like crust. That, too, had a sour taste. The Popping Spicy Crab Roll was ... fun. I wanted to try some so my friend ordered it. What was fun about it was that it consisted of Pop Rocks! When they first brought it out, you could hear the Pop Rocks crackling in the roll. I have a major sweet tooth, so I enjoyed the contrast of the pop rocks and the crab. \n\nI ordered the Angry Salmon Roll. It wasn't horrible, except that the roll had a diameter of maybe a quarter. Mediocre to me. It filled me up quite nicely and kept my bill under $20. Overall I thought Yellowtail was average for the classy prices they were charging for each dish. \n\nP.S. \nDid I mention that the portion sizes are very small?"

The waitress kept leaving the table after taking one persons order without allowing the rest of the party to order their dinner.  We had to keep stopping her and telling her to come back for the rest of the order.  We had only ordered a few appetizers previously so I'm not sure what she was thinking.  We waited 30 minutes for one of our pre dinner drinks and 30 min for a hot tea I ordered after dinner.  She forgot one of our rolls.  And she never seemed the slightest apologetic or embarrassed.  All this at an extremely high price point, even for an upscale sushi restaurant.  It was more than our dinner at Andreas (at the Wynn) the night before.  Terrible experience."

Let me qualify this review by saying we were motivated by a good experience at Noodles and the in room bio about the Korean executive chef who broke down the making of his signature tuna pizza.\n\nDecor / ambience: excellent.  In fact, probably one of the best places on the strip for views of the fountain show and quiet atmosphere for a business dinner or dinner date.  Minimalist decor with candles on each table.  Drink menu presented via a customized iPad app, which was a little over the top, but fine.\n\nService: fine, exactly what one would expect from a restaurant trying to market itself more on the fine dining spectrum.  Drink glasses always full and empty plates taken away quickly.\n\nFood: herein lies the great and tragic downfall.  We began with the tuna pizza and soft shell crab roll.  The roll was small for our tastes about a 4 inch cut roll, wrapped in nori and soy.  The crab was crisp and fresh though so okay all around.  The pizza however left much to be desired.  The tortilla on which the tuna lay was burnt and overpowered anything that the chefs could have placed on top.  The tuna itself was cut delicately, but tasteless.  The order was followed up with ankimo, Saba roll(Holy Mackerel), hamachi roll (Yellowtail Scallion).  Ankimo was not true pate, but the tube sort, cut into round circles and lacking in any flavor.  The rolls resembled convenient store sushi in appearance - although the rice was soft, there was such an insignificant amount of fish that we really could not taste anything.  I really am not trying to be overly dramatic here - looking at some of the photos I post, you will get a feel for what the plates are like.  The price for the disappointing food was the final nail.  I understand that when going to a place like Yellowtail, you will be overpaying to a certain extent for the ambience and experience.  However to not even receive food I could get from places in LA, I.E., Go's Mart, Katsuya, Sugarfish, or Got Sushi for what Yellowtail charges is ridiculous.\n\nNormally, if I do not like a restaurant, I would not return.  However, I was so dissatisfied with my experience at Yellowtail, that I felt compelled to review.  I do not plan on returning."

So at a tab of  about $125 (all we had was water to drink), we decided to cut our losses and headed straight to the Bellagio snack bar.  Yes, the snack bar.  We were all still so hungry that we actually didn't feel satisfied with what we ate.\n\nThe service was good but I felt that the server was a bit pushy with ordering more things or trying to push us to order something from the bar.  But in hindsight, she probably knew that the things we ordered wouldn't fill us up.  \n\nDefinitely not worth going to, there are so many better places that you can get this kind of food without dipping into your gambling bankroll.  Save your money to use it on something worth wasting your money on...like Megabucks.  At least then, you'd have a chance to get some of your money back, instead of it just turning into crap."

My spicy miso soup was incredible, made with fresh crab and tofu in a surprisingly spicy miso broth. For my main course I went with the flat iron kobe steak. It was as tender as any steak could get, back lacked flavor. My friends ordered an array of sashimi, all of which was excellent. However, you could get the same quality sashimi in San Francisco at better prices. The prices of the sake were outrages so we all settled for their signature cocktails, all of which were delightful, especially my \"sunrise\" drink- made with grey goose vodka and blood orange juice. 4 cocktails= $80. Total cost of our dinner= $470 :O\n\nWas it worth it? Not really! But was it very good? Yes!"

When sushi is this expensive, you expect it to be really good.  I ordered Ikura, Japanese scallop and yellowtail sushi.   Each piece was very smail, which to be fair is more traditional, but when you consider that each order was $9.00-$11.00 or $12 you kind of want a teeny bit more substance.  If not substance, then at least some kind of special preparation.  Small portiions are even forgivable if the fish is to die for.  The yellowtail had virtually no flavor - weird, right?.  Even bad yellowtail tastes like, well bad yellowtail.  This was just void of anything.  The scallops were wet and mushy and the Ikura was just okay - kind of fishy - even for salmon eggs (which I love and order all the time)..  I also ordered the eggplant on skewers.  This was so-so..  They cut the eggplant into small cubes, skewered them, supposedly grilled them, then slopped it with the sweet sauce that you usually see on eel sushi...a.totally forgetable dish.  But the worst offender of the evening was one of Yellowtail's 'signature' cut rolls: spicy crab, asparagus, green bean  and (are you ready?) pop rocks.  This is HAD to try just for the goof.  But before diving in, I asked the nice barternder/server if this roll had mayo in it because I'm not a fan.  She said that they could make it without,.  It arrives and looks like your basic california roll.  When I tasted it, it wasn't spicy and the pop rocks just don't work.  In fact, it was ridiculous...like the chef was high out of his mind one night and said hey! let's stick some candy in a sushi roll and see how many suckers out there will pay $16.00 for it!!    Dinner with one non-alcoholic beer cost $79,00.  Granted, I'm at Bellagio so this should be expected - and I'm happy to pay for something that is worth the money.  But this was a waste of money, calories and time.  Don't go here.   This hotel has so many great places to eat.  Don't squander one of your meals here."

That said, Yellowtail is not the typical sushi restaurants that has 3 pages of different sushi rolls or all you can eat option. Its an upscale Japanese restaurant with tapas serving sizes. We ordered most of the popular dishes: Big Eye Tuna Pizza (Crispy), Tempura King Crab (Crabby Crab Crab), Kobe Beef Tataki (raw and weird at first), Crispy Soft Shell crab and one specialty sushi (don't remember the name because it wasn't memorable). I was very pleased with the suggested dishes by the waiter and was awed by the view of the Bellagio Fountain. If you're looking for a romantic night out with your significant other and wanted to splurge a little, this would be the spot.  Ask for the window seating to get a better view of the Bellagio fountain."

The food was VERY good and things like the edamame with sweet spicy chili sauce were new and very good to me.  I thought it interesting that they have a Nobu staple (popcorn shrimp in spicy sauce) on the menu.  I ordered 4 of these for the table and they were gone in 3 minutes (they should be eaten hot anyway).  I ordered more and they too were gone. \n\nWe ordered some sushi rolls that were fantastic including the first lemon zest I have ever had in a Maki Sushi.  It was a special and tasted like a perfect summer happy hour roll.  So good...  Anyway the one guy that didn't like sushi was happy with his $50 Kobi beef.  Seaweed salad was fantastic and ample/fresh.  The Ahi nachos rocked too.  You will not be dissappointed here but bring money like at every non-buffet in Vegas.  Again, this place was built for the expense account.\n\nCheers.\nT"

We sat in the back and were immediately greeted with steller service and recommendations. \n\nAppetizers:\n--  Seaweed salad: came with two types, one with an overwhelming oceanic taste and the other a salty and sweet clear green thin type found in most restaurants. I liked this one but the fresh seaweed was almost too powerful to handle. \n--  Cucumber salad: light and refreshing, they use some great white vinegar to enhance the flavor. Makes a great refresher in between complex dishes.\n--  Miso soup: the best I have ever had.\n--  Grilled Eggplant Skewers: one of my favorite dishes, this eggplant is cooked PERFECTLY, and has the best sauce I have ever tasted. It is like a caramelized miso reduction and if you like eggplant you need to try this. I think it was around $12 so for being the cheapest app on the menu it was by far the most memorable!\n--  Big eye tuna pizza: We tried this one because it won \"best appetizer in LV\" (according to our waiter). It was good but not spectacular. I will say that you will definitely taste the truffle oil. Also, the salmon was fresh. Not worth 26 though.\n-- Scottish Salmon Carpaccio - Another winner, fresh fresh fresh! The sauce (Yuzu Soy I think) was delicious\n\nEntrees and rolls:\n-- baked crab hand roll : SO GOOD. THIS IS SO GOOD. I MEAN GOOOOOOOOD. If you like your sushi with a little oomph and cream sauces then get this. for 10 bucks it is well worth it!\n-- rock shrimp hand roll : I liked the flavors a lot, but the roll is a bit more of a dry one in comparison to the baked crab. **The paper that wraps these two rolls is unlike any other I have experienced, I would go back just to have this style hand roll again. \n-- california roll : tasty and standard, again aim for the more unique dishes here \n-- spicy tuna : not much more than tuna and rice. I liked that they were very spicy \n-- oysters - creamy and very good\n\nDrinks: \n-- Lychee - This one was good but for $20 it wasn't great. There was a strange flavor to it that was not sweet, empty and unsatisfying. (It was too unusual to compare to something else though). I will give them points for strength, the cocktails most assuredly hit the spot. \n-- Essence - cranberry cucumber flavors, extremely refreshing and mild.\n\nOverall go here for appetizers and drinks, do not waste your money on an entire meal. We spent around $500 for 4 people in total. \nI will give it 4 stars because for as much as we spent, I was expecting each dish amaze me in some way or another."

We wandered in while waiting for some friends to get in on our first night in Vegas, and we were seated in the front section, out in the casino - honestly until now I had no idea you could get a view of the Bellagio fountains!! Will definitely push for that next time. \n\nWe ordered the edamame and two share plates - rock shrimp and tempura crab. The edamame was unique - came in two dishes, one with rock salt and the other with chili sauce. The rock shrimp was good but the sauce was too creamy for my taste. The crab was, hands down, the star of the show. Huge chunks of crab. Tasty (ponzu?) sauce. We also had the chocolate lava cake which was delicious, although not very lava-y by my standards .... I like my chocolate to ooze. Our drinks were amazing - I had the blood orange and my bf had the kiwi (this will make sense when you see the drink menu). \n\nOne gripe - I hear they have super nice bathrooms, but when I went they were shut down and I was (sternly) directed out of the restaurant. The food was definitely tasty - if I were in Vegas again I would go back to try some other things on the menu ...which could push my stars up to 4 (stay tuned)."

The California roll has real crab in it rather than imitation crab. The ginger is quite fresh and pleasant tasting. Unfortunately the  tempura is nothing special. The seaweed salad is tasty but common. The 50 shades of blue martini was quite chemical and unpleasant tasting. This restaurant has too many dings against it to consider returning.

The edimame appetizer was really good. You get one bowl of sea-salted ones and one bowl of them in a sweet chili sauce which was awesome. For my entree I figured 2 rolls would be enough since the waitress said you get 6-8 pieces. Well she was correct, however the peices are VERY small considering the $12-18 price tag. But the sushi was good - I had a spicy tuna roll and the unagi (eel). \nProbably wouldn't come back here given the extensive dining options in Vegas and how rarely I'm able to make it out there, but don't let that stop you from going."

We could see part of the shows from where we were seated inside. The hostess was a hot mess and not very welcoming or polite- in fact she seemed a bit unsure and uncomfortable. Our waitress was very nice and had excellent recommendations. The wait for both our drinks and food was quite a bit. Our waitress apologized and kept checking in, but you could tell the wait staff we slightly taxed. And we overheard another table complaining about being forgotten to management. We got the Alaskan king crab tempura- dear god that dish is amazing! One of the best I've ever tried! The Angry salmon roll was decent. Miso soup was good, and the red Zinfandel that was recommended was also quite good. That being said the price was too high for the small portions, slightly above average sushi, wait time, and fail on seating. Our price was $97 for 2 people- including a discount rate we got due to attending a conference in Vegas. I'd recommend it if you're going for the crab tempura- but get 1 for each person! And at $45 a plate it won't fill you up.  Lots of opportunities for this place to\nImprove!"

I still can smell the old oily smell of the crisp. Then tuna roll, protein roll, steak. none was good. very disappointing. Not to mention that the price was unreasonably high. I asked for a cucumber avocado roll. I was charged for cucumber roll plus 3 dollar for avocado and additional 3 dollar for \" inside out\" which means in cucumber roll the rice is inside the seaweed  ( seaweed paper is the outer layer) but now that they added avocado they had to have the rice outer layer and that cost 3 $ additional to price of cucumber and avocado! \nI also asked for side of rice with steak which I was charged additional 3 dollar for bowl of rice ( which make sense ) and another 3$ to serve the rice in a bowl!! and I have to add the quality of steak was close to what you eat at fast food places and the steak was cooked completely bloody even I requested well cooked and I specifically asked the server's opinion ordering that for my kids, which he recommended!

We had a reservation at 9pm but were 1 1/2 hrs too early. We got a table, regardless. Unfortunately after only a few minutes we were about to leave. The place was incredibly noisy, no way to have a normal conversation. The music was sooo loud, the people's voices level unbearable. We were so disappointed..... We wanted so much this evenIng to be unforgettable. The staff was really nice and showed much understanding for our frustration. First they offered another large table, however the noise wasn't really better. Since the number of available seats on the patio/outside terrace is very limited, the likelihood to get a table for six with no reservation was very low! But i must say i was impressed by their efforts to help us. And after 15-20 min, with a bit of patience they were able to seat us outside, in the patio, with direct view on the Bellagio's fountain with great water choreographies and our evening was saved! Yes, the evening is really memorable. The food was great! We had revisited oysters, tempura crab, a selection of sushi, kobe beef tabaki, i recommend the 'angry salmon', shared plates: yellowtail jalapenos, gratinee seafood, scallops: all was great! My guests were absolutely delighted! But we had our very highlight with the dessert. I am not a 'dessert guy' but what we got that evening was absolutely magic. The yuzu citrus was the best dessert we ever had, the chocolate in a cup with banana foam absolutely top!! It wasn't cheap (700$ for 6 incl 5 glasses of very good chardonnay) but our evening with the fountain spectacle will remain for ever one of our best event!!"

I choose this place because I saw the chef on the Bellagio info tv channel making the popular big eye tuna pizza dish. Just to clarify, this is not your cheese and tomato pie, but slices of tuna on a crisp tortilla bread and sliced onions with truffle oil sprinkled on top. That was $26! Yes, that was our appetizer and it was really delish and one of the most creative dishes that I've had in a long time. I ordered a Lychee martini - $20, for that drink. \n\nThe mister decided that we should go with the chef's seven course tasting menu. The last time we ate a chef's tasting menu anywhere was ages ago, so why not, the mister was treating the Mrs. Here is the breakdown of the chef Akira Back menu: \n\n1. Seafood Pate with a tiny, delish sugary treat (I didn't like this) \n2. Sliced Yellowtail with jalapenos \n3. Salad with greens, tomato, & onions \n4. Salmon with miso sauce and foam \n5. Kobe short ribs with a quail egg and star shaped veggies \n6. 5 pieces of sushi (sushi was average) \n7. Green tea mousse cake with a shot of milk. \n\nPortions are small so this tasting menu made our stomach at that beginning feeling at full. Believe me, there will be no leftovers to wrap up and I made sure that I drank very sip of my lychee martini. Overall, I loved my experience at Yellowtail. The waiter was awesome as he made sure we done on time as we had to leave for our show. The ambiance is beautiful, so chic, and very romantic. This restaurant has a beautiful view of the fountain show. I would come back just for the tuna pizza and ambiance.

This was the WORST, absolute WORST, and for those of you who are just skimming and may have missed it... THE WORST PLACE EVER! Overpriced Garbage! \nI made reservations at Yellowtail for my husband's birthday. He loves sushi and could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Even though we had reservations, we still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and the place was not that busy. No big deal there...it happens...sometimes you have to wait. \nThen there was the food. Becca F. was right in her review...\"sushi chefs everywhere are embarrassed\". We order the 7 course chef's tasting menu. After each course I was hoping and praying it would get better. I kept thinking...How could it get any worse? I was wrong every single time. Then we finally got to the dessert and it was bad! How do you screw up dessert? \nEven the service left lots to be desired. Since we had 7 courses we often watched our next courses take a couple laps around the restaurant before it made it to our table. A few waiters that didn't know their table numbers I suppose. No big deal, until the ice cream was practically completely melted on the dessert by the time it came to our table. \nThe ONLY thing that was good about this meal was the Sapporo and we all know Yellowtail had nothing to do with that. I have been reading a lot of the other reviews on this sight and I wish I would have read them before I went. \nHere's the kicker for those of you that are still reading...After dropping almost $400 on this crappy birthday dinner we went directly from the restaurant to Taco Bell. My husband didn't eat any Taco Bell because he was full from eating my meal and his meal at the restaurant because he didn't want to waste it at those prices. Now the next morning, as I type this review, my husband is having a hard time trying to decide which end to put on the toilet first because he has FOOD POISONING!!!"

So getting the reservation or a large party was a little bit difficult especially on fight weekend. They accommodated us with a phone call about three days before.\n\nService - pretty decent. Very responsive with a large party but thats because tip is guaranteed. But they did fill our waters and had decent suggestions. Also they were very responsive and helpful.\n\nFood - Each group of 4 people ordered their set of dishes. In my group we had a hardcore sushi person, two experienced sushi eaters and one non sushi eater. \n\nWe ordered the tuna pizza, which was pretty good, the non sushi eater liked it. Along with tha we ordered 4 rolls, a unagi type roll, a soft shell crab roll, a tempura roll of some sort and a tuna roll. We also ordered a Wagyu beef dish that was probably the highlight of the meal. We also had a snapper dish which definitely one I would come back for. I am not much of a roll person, so I can't say they were that good nor that bad.\n\nThe non sushi eater was pretty good at taking down the rolls, so in that sense the fish was pretty decent. The tuna pizza is more of a novelty, sorry toro, or hamachi are number one on my sushi wants.\n\nDecor - It was a very modern setting and the view we had was outstanding, it was a great view of the water show at the bellagio, it can get pretty noisy in here so don't look here for a romantic dinner unless you like raising your voice to the person across from you.\n\nI'll admit it wasn't my first choice (Comme Ca was) but it proved to be good for a not too filling meal, which is what we aimed for."

The tempura crab (I can't remember if it was crab or lobster) was also amazing. Scallops were amazing too. So tender, Like eating butter! I got some sort of fruity mixed saki drink which was also to die for!! I can't remember what else we got but it was all amazing.\n\nOur waiter however was terrible. I don't know if it was because we were all younger or what but he just didn't seem to care about us at all. We ended up timing him based on the Bellagio fountain \"shows\". We got seated in the middle of one show, and it took him until the start of the next show to even ask what we wanted to drink. The service got worse from there. He was really nice every time he talked to us but we seemed to burden him. I say this because he was really attentive to literally every other table he had, except us. Was it because we didn't order bottled water?"

Major letdown.  I had the spicy tuna & some other roll (I forgot).  The ingredients were fresh & tasty, but I've seen conveyor belt sushi with more charm and heartiness.\nThe sake was insanely priced.... however there is a huge selection of high grade sake!\nYes, the price was ridiculous for everything ($5 beer = boo) but that's just how it is on the main strip in the big hotels.\n\n* The Service:\nIt took about 10 minutes before the staff prepared an empty lounge table.\nThe waitress was charming, but she wasn't attentive at all.\nThe service had a lot of room for improvement.\n\n* The Setting:\nI really dig the style of Yellowtail.\nThe outside lounge tables look over the casino floor, where you can be seen as the coolest dork under the Yellowtail sign (or I can at least).\nThe interior is dimly lit, there are some Asian inspired artworks along the walls, and the lounge music sets a nice background.\n\nIf I were to return to the Bellagio, I would keep Yellowtail as an option for an expensive drink and a quick bite in a very cool lounge.  Don't go for more than a bite, or you might just end up unsatisfied and cursing the bill."

I was taken to a two top at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains.\n\nI looked at the menu and my server came and asked about water/other beverages and I ordered my standard iced tea which was quickly brought to the table.  I looked over the menu some more and the server gave me some recommendations.  I decided to order one cold shared plate and one warm shared plate as the server (and some reviews) point out that the shared plates aren't that large.\n\nI got the Big eye tuna pizza and the tempura Alaskan king crab.  These were two recommendations from the server and he pointed out that the tempura crab had been on the Best Thing I Ever Ate Food Network show.\n\nThe tuna pizza was very good.  It had a very, very thin crust with just enough substance to pick up the pieces and eat it truly like a pizza.  The flavors were great even the truffle oil because it was used sparingly.  The tempura crab was a bit of a disappointment.  It was OK but the tempura was a bit heavy and took away from the crab. I couldn't help but think it was a waste of good crab making it tempura style.  It wouldn't go on my list of best thing I ever ate.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the Chocolate in a cup.  It consisted of Nutella, banana foam, and vanilla bean ice cream.  The Nutella is in the cup and there's a ring on top of the foam that breaks and dissolves into the foam and ice cream.  It was a great dessert.\n\nService was impeccable.

The ambiance, service and food were nothing short of excellent.  We were seated next to the big windows and had a great view of the fountains.  Our waiters were very helpful in suggesting \"what's good to eat\" there and they did not disappoint.  Among our favorite dishes, we enjoyed the Kobe Beef Tataki, the Tempura Alaskan King Crab and the Unagi & Banana Roll.  While we spent about $200 on our meal we enjoyed every penny of it!  We definitely will visit Yellowtail again the next time we are in Vegas."

Food is inventive and fresh making it great for a date or a bigger group. Love the big eye tuna pizza and how can you pass up the sushi rolls with pop rocks. The cocktail menu is great flavor and fun. Have to say my fav is the essence. If you are dining alone the bar scene is fun looking out on to the rest of the casino a killer spot for people watching. Love coming here. Easily my favorite restaurant at Bellagio."

It's off the casino floor but I didn't feel bombarded by slot machine sounds all night. The we had a couple starters, sushi rolls, and dessert. Everything was great and the only slight downside to the evening was arguing over who might have eaten the shrimp's eyeball (it had fallen out). We had a nice dinner. I wouldn't rate it five stars simply because while our experience was good, it wasn't spectacular or particularly memorable either. Would give it another shot though if I'm craving sushi on the Strip!"

It is listed under the \"Shared Plates\" part of the menu but I can guarantee that on my next visit, I am getting one of those suckers all to myself.  Maybe two.  It is that delicious.  My husband had tried it before and was raving about it ever since, so I tried to manage my expectations, but he wasn't exaggerating, it is that good.  I am not even going to bother describing it, because no description would do it justice.  It is just a flavor explosion in your mouth.  Period.  \n\nI am quite serious about ordering two for myself next time.  One to start and one to finish my meal.  In between I will order the Uni Sushi again, and the addition of the quail egg, really put these 2 pieces of sea urchin sushi over the top.  The baked crab roll is also fabulous.  My husband and I shared it, and I may just have to get an order for myself next time because the crispy onions, spicy aioli, in the soy paper was fabulous.  I was literally \"mmmmm\"-ing after every bite.  \n\nWe also ordered the Popping Spicy Crab just because it is such a unique dish that we had to try it at least once.  Not only was this meal a pleasure for the senses of taste, smell, and sight...it was quite an experience for the ears too.  When the dish was placed on our table, you could hear the pop rocks popping away.  It was actually quite tasty.  Who knew that the sweet and crunchy pop rocks would be a great compliment to the spicy crab? Chef Akira, obviously.  \n\nMy husband's favorite seafood is scallops and so we had to order the Seared Diver Sea Scallops, and it was seared perfectly and accompanied by a mustard potato puree.  It wasn't my favorite, but my husband loved it.  Fine with me, because that just meant more room for another order of uni.  From start to finish, I had a smile on my face.  With a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountain show and a tall glass of Asahi Black, I was in heaven.  \n\nThe service was impeccable.  I highly recommend that you ask to be seated in Roberto's section if you want amazing service.  I was quite pleasantly surprised with this meal.  For years, I have walked past this restaurant in the Bellagio, not giving it a second look.  But, from now on, I will be salivating every time as I imagine the big eye tuna pizza.  If they were open for lunch, I would be there right now."

Other \"signature\" appetizer with four tiny little pieces of seared albacore hidden under a canopy of crisp onion? Yep. Downright stingy serving sizes? Take a guess.\n\nI actually had a very enjoyable evening thanks to great company, and I was prepared to feel overcharged given that this restaurant is located inside the Bellagio Hotel. But, if you live in a city that has good sushi (L.A.) you can probably think of 3 sushi bars within 3 miles of your house, have a better meal at each and every one of them, and still have money left over in the end.\n\nTo me, sushi is supposed to be an experience in every bite. Yellowtail Japanese Restaurant & Lounge is too bland and too expensive (and the servings embarrassingly small), and will likely disappoint all but the most novice of sushi fans."

I ordered slices of Tuna (Maguro) sashimi and the fish turned out to be rather fishy, red flag alert for bad sushi. I'm highly doubtful at the skill of a sushi chef who would let bad sashimi pass in front of a customer.

If it wasn't for Beau MacMillan's convincing testimonial of their Alaskan King Crab Tempura from Best Things I Ever Ate, I probably would never have considered coming here.  It looked so good on the show, I had to make the effort to try it out.\n\nI came by on a Sunday night without a reservation so the pretty hostess asked if I want to sit at table inside the lounge or outside on their front patio.  So no view of the Fountains of Bellagio which wasn't such a bad thing.  I chose to dine at the front patio as it was a nice way to people watch while I would wait for my food.  As a side note, the hostess and all the waitresses here are really HAUTE!!  Never had Crab Tempura before, but after having it at Yellowtail, I'm gonna look for it at any Japanese Restaurant.\n\nThe Alaskan King Crab Tempura was amazing!!!  Not only was it delicious, it was very photogenic as well (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=cqE1cyW2PUjUEbx1Z58Hrw).  The Crab was tasty and the Ponzu sauce totally enhanced the flavor of the Tempura.  For me, it was a foodgasm with each bite.  At $23, it is quite a splurge considering it's from their Small Hot Plate menu, but they give you plenty of pieces and a side order of Rice went great with it.  Plus, it's not very often that you would find Crab Tempura on a menu at your conventional Japanese Restaurant.  So consider it a different experience when you're ordering it.\n\nMy waitress was great and very friendly, and as I mentioned earlier, very HAUTE!!  One minor hiccup about my service was that the person who served me my food forgot to include the Ponzu sauce which was a very important ingredient.  It took a while for my waitress to get the sauce for me which cooled down my food a little bit.  But once she brought me the sauce, the awesomeness of the Tempura totally made up for it.\n\n4.5 stars rounding up!  Yellowtail has definitely earned a spot as one of my To-Go Vegas dining spots."

When I got back it was unanimously decided (without my vote) - YELLOWTAIL JAPANESE RESTAURANT & LOUNGE.\n\nOuch, this was going to be expensive! \n\nThe fact is, this is really good Japanese cuisine. The best ingredients, great preparation, beautifully done and very delicious. The menu offered so many variations of what I'm used to on my Ventura Blvd. niche environs that each dish as a pleasant surprise. This was, flat out, a wonderful dinner with fantastic service. Everyone including myself enjoyed the hell out of it, and I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting this cuisine.\n\nWas it very expensive - a resounding YES! It's not a hole-in-the-wall place with hole-in-the-wall prices. It's a \"Real Deal\" place with \"Real Deal\" prices. Was I shocked when I got the bill - No. Did I feel I got my money's worth - Yes. So why the four stars and why am I crying; It was one months car payment and I still have to write the car payment check."

So, if I want sushi in a restaurant that is located in the lobby of the Bellagio, it should be served all night, not until eleven PM. 11 PM?! Really? Because I'm not a Vegas local I'm most likely just getting out of a show then, or maybe 1/4 of the way into my night. Serve sushi all night...it's a good business model.\n\nHowever, if you do serve sushi, don't put white onion in it. It's totally gross. Maybe the chef was playing a joke on us.\n\nDinner for two: $80 including a horrible plate of mushrooms and \"sauce\" that tasted like something from my high school cafeteria; that weird \"onion roll,\" and something tempura'd, which can never go wrong. \n\nAlso, the server insisted on reaching our table by maneuvering through a tiny gap between my left shoulder and the wall.

I had booked a reservation to celebrate an anniversary on their patio a week in advance.  On the taxi ride to the restaurant, I called to let them know that we were running a little bit late.  I was told that there was no reservation under my name, and when she looked up my OpenTable confirmation number, it showed that it was booked for the previous night (Friday), and that the restaurant was fully booked, especially for the coveted patio seating.  I was floored at myself for the mistake; we were so excited to try Yellowtail and experience their beautiful patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  I asked to just put my name down in case something opened up, and perhaps we would just dine at the bar.  We checked in, were told that it was a realistic wait of an hour and a half, and proceeded to order a few drinks and appetizers at the bar.  Maybe 20-30 minutes passed by, and the hostess that I spoke to over the phone approached me at the bar and said she was able to get me a table on the patio, saying she \"knew she had to do something for me\" after speaking to me on the phone.  I really appreciated the hospitality, especially since it clearly was my mistake on booking a table for the wrong night.\n\nThe patio table and view of the Bellagio water show were divine.  I have no words to describe the amazing ambiance, and truly can't compare it to any other view while dining.  If you dine here and the weather is nice, I would try to get a table out here.\n\nThe food was a bit mediocre for the pricing, though I feel like it was justified by the patio experience.  The only dish that really stuck out was my boyfriend's Surf & Turf ($115).  The sauce on the lobster was so delicious, and both the proteins were cooked to perfection.  I ordered the Hirame Ikejime ($30), which was just OK.  Hirame is one of my favorite fish eaten raw, but nothing wowed me.  I also ordered the Seared Foie Gras ($45), which was again, OK, and a very tiny portion for the price.  There was nothing special about our miso soups ($8 for a regular, and $9 for spicy).  The spicy version just tasted like they added few dashes of Tabasco.  All in all, the scenery made it all worth it (I know, I can't stop talking about it).\n\nService was great.  He didn't mention anything about it being our anniversary, but I was already highly appreciative of the fact that the hostess got us a table.\n\nThis is a great experience to celebrate a romantic evening!"

You see, I visited YT on a night where the stars were completely aligned.  \n\nAkira Back present - Check\nCameraman filming Akira Back - Check\nAkira Back dedicated to our table alone (due to the 10+ group)- Check\nAkira Back dedicated to our table alone while being filmed - Check\nAkira Back dedicated to our table alone while being filmed and making his favorite dishes - Check...mate...\n\nI'm typically not a big Vegas sushi joint kind of guy.  I like my hole in the wall, off the beaten path sushi places.  I think that there are sushi chef's in smaller places that outperform the renowned.  Perfect example is Crazy Sushi in St. Peters, MO.  One of the best IMO.  Why do they not have a Crazy Sushi in a Vegas casino?  Thus going into YT I was skeptical, and preparing for the same roll I could get somewhere not Vegas for a lot less $$$.\n\nYellow tail was a great experience, and I understand why Akira has his own place at the Bellagio.  This isn't Dragon, Philly, or Vegas rolls, and if that's what you want go elsewhere because you are going to overpay for very basic sushi.  Sushi is a very tiny piece of YT.  Notice this says Yellowtail Japanese Restaurant, and not Yellowtail Sushi Bar.  There you have it... I have still avoided going to a Vegas sushi bar.\n\nLike I said, we were treated to a much different experience than someone who waltzed in on any given night.  Akira is not always in, and I doubt I will ever visit a restaurant again where the chef is being filmed while making my dinner.  FYI Akira Back was on Iron Chef North America...   \n\nWe did a hybrid Omakase  which is the 7 course sampler.  I think we received over 7 courses, and I think this was due to Akira, and the camera guy.  Again, stars aligned...  Also we agreed with the server to let him make whatever he wants for us which probably didn't hurt either.\n\nFrom the first dish which was his pizza, I started realizing why YT is different, and not a sushi bar.  I really like truffle oil when it's applied to the right dish.  You wouldn't think raw fish would mesh well with the pungent truffle oil, but it goes great with the other flavors of the pizza.  \n\nThe kobe beef tataki was awesome, as was the protein roll.  \n\nThe pop rock roll was just odd to say the least, but was freaking amazing.  Pop rocks in sushi WTF?  Only in Vegas.  There was also a roll brought out, and I want to say it had strawberries and tuna in it.  \n\nThere was agrilled walu which was outstanding...  \n\nThe kobe short rib dish he made for us was awesome as well.  I think we asked for another round of the ribs, and walu.  \n\nI could have done without the rock shrimp.  Shrimp is just meh for me. I don't get excited over it because well... its just shrimp.  Shrimp should be the chicken of the sea, not canned tuna.  With that being said, the table loved it, and if you are a shrimp lover you'll go nuts over it.\n\nAnyhow, those were some of the dishes that really stood out for me at YT.     I'm pretty sure we had something chicken and sashimi as well.  They were good, but drowned out by the quality of the courses I mentioned.\n\nAppearance, flavor, and quality were top notch.  Akira Back should be very proud of his ability to be extremely creative with food, and a pallet that knows what goes.\n\nWould I have enjoyed the restaurant as much on any other night? I don't know.  I  wouldn't have been as daring and would have just ordered some rolls, and the pizza.  I probably wouldn't have went to YT because I would have thought it was just another sushi joint.  Things happen for a reason right?  I can share my experiences so you can either walk-in, or walk-by.  \n\nI think this place is well worth the money.  Sure it's expensive, but seriously folks... if you're worried about price why the hell are you considering eating at the Bellagio to begin with?  Hey I look for the 5.00 tables, but that's only because I am a shitty gambler.  For dinner I go all in..."

I can't wait to return to Vegas just to eat at Yellowtail again!\n\nDuring my last trip to Vegas, my friends and I checked out Yellowtail and tried the following menu items:\n\n-Big eye tuna pizza: WOW... this was so good.  I loved the contrast between the soft tuna and crunchy pizza crust.\n-Kumamoto oysters: super fresh and perfectly scrumptious. \n-Kobe beef tataki: melted in my mouth. \n-Yellowtail tataki\n-King crab tempura \n-Popping spicy crab roll: yummy and the popping candy was definitely a nice surprise!\n-Unagi roll\n\nYellowtail's menu is definitely one of the most creative and innovative ones I've seen.  I love how everything on the menu was so unique... I wish I could've tried it all.  Plus, the ambiance is fun and trendy and the service was great.  \n\nI can't wait to go back!"

            "review": "Yellowtail will not overly impress traditional sushi aficionados but for the jetset, it will make for a good change of scenery from Nobu at the HRH for those used to that sort of dining environment.  There are however a fair number of reasons why you might put this on your itinerary for your next Vegas trip: \n\n1) \"NOBU\" FOR ADULTS\nThe d\u00e9cor, the atmosphere, the music, the attractive hostesses... even many of the dishes are blatent clones of Nobu's aesthetic.  Some of Nobu's more famous plates like \"tuna tataki\" have been adapted to \"yellowtail tataki\".  Some dishes served, like Nobu's Toro Tartar, are available as flat out Xeroxed, down to the caviar accenting & ume plum garnish.\n\nThat being said, there are some improvements over Nobu that aren't hard to miss:\n--- CROWD:  The clientele are of a, uh, higher caliber.  Being at the Bellagio makes Yellowtail a target for business dinners & younger committed couples.  This is by design, according to a friend who works there.\n--- BAR:  The bar is very large & active, not to attract singles but to provide respite for individuals waiting for their tables.  There are 14 first-come-first-served 'bar tables' that you can just jump on & get served at.  And again, since it's at the Bellagio, you'll find it easier to dodge the patented HRH skanks & douchebags.\n--- SERVICE:  There is a very strict code of service at Yellowtail where \"everyone on the waitstaff is held responsible for any customer's satisfaction\".  They have \"secret shoppers\" go through often to ensure service levels & with the exception of really busy days, this should shine through.\n--- VIEW:  Call for the 'window view' reservations FAR in advance & you'll have a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains & the Eiffel Tower at Paris.\n\n2) NOUVEAU JAPANESE DISHES\nLike most \"trendy\" sushi restaurants, the Yellowtail menu has both traditional as well as avant garde dishes to satisfy any age palette.  Yellowtail didn't hold back in duplicating the \"Hot Dish/Cold Dish\" menu orientation of Nobu, & why should they?  It works & is immensely profitable.\nA few notes:\n--- ROCK SHRIMP:  Overly soaked in a cream thai hot sauce that mimics the ludicrous over-saucing of many of today's Americanized sushi \"rolls\".  Similar to a finger foods version of a \"911 roll\", this undoubtedly is a huge moneymaker w/ its cheap ingredients but familiar flavors.\n--- TORO TARTAR:  An poor clone of Nobu's more famous dishes, this is disappointingly salty.  The soy sauce concoction that the minced toro w/ caviar sits in lacks the savory nature of Nobu's dish because they forgot the bonito stock.  As a result, its got a salty bite & at $39, it's as they say: EPIC FAIL.\n--- SUSHI:  The salmon & mackerel were fairly good.  Fresh, select, cut correctly, & in good proportions.  The sweet shrimp were actually live amaebi surprisingly.  The deep fried head however was served luke warm, but it was also a pregnant shrimp providing a good amount of roe to accent the head & that sort of made up for it.  I expected the toro & the yellowtail to be good considering how much they must serve at the restaurant.\nRock Shrimp/Creamy spicy sauce:  3/5\nToro Tartar: 3/5\nSalmon: 4/5\nSpanish Mackerel: 4/5\nSweet Shrimp: 5/5\nSweet Shrimp head: 4/5\nToro: 4/5\nYellowtail: 4/5\n\n3) SAKE MENU\nYellowtail has a fairly good sake menu that is price-designed very well to direct people to the cheaper high-margin Jokigen.  As a result, don't be surprised if it's \"out of stock\" as a result.\n--- BEWARE THE SAKE 'SWITCH'\nDon't order an expensive 'carafe' of sake if you don't know what you're doing.  I received a tokkuri of sake - the Mukune, which I've had many times before.   They serve the Junmai Ginjoshu which is dry & a little earthy but still lightly fragrant.  What was given to me was none of the above, making it either a) not Mukune or b) very old.  To the wait staff's surprise, I demanded that they bring out the sake bottle.  Not surprisingly, they chose not to & instead brought out a completely new unopened bottle of Mukune.  The bottle's production date was 9/08 & lo-and-behold, the flavor was greatly improved from the first.\n--- EXPERT'S HINT:  If you order a 'carafe' of sake, request that your sake be served in a 'tokkuri' or ceramic flask COLD & have them bring out the bottle at Yellowtail.  And most importantly, do not let them pour it into those bamboo shoots - it distorts & changes the flavor.\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\nFor the strip, this is about as good as you're going to get.  There's better in Vegas, but not by much.\n\n4-stars.\n\n-----\nNOTE:\nYellowtail does not have the \"most comprehensive sake menu in Vegas\".  That award goes to Okada & Shibuya, as any sake distributor will confirm. \n\nAnd as for the dude that recommended \"the sushi bar inside Caesar's Palace (next to Cleopatra's Barge)\" over Yellowtail, that place is called \"Hyakumi\".  It has an all-you-can-eat sushi deal during lunch if that tells you anything. [shakes head]"

It is a fun, hip kind of place to be, and it was a treat to sit outside and see the Bellagio fountain show over and over again. (They gave us a great table, and we are not in the NBA).\n\nWhen I say the place was hip, I mean it might be a little too hip. The team of waiters (young, cool, and attractive) were always passing by and were perhaps a bit too present if you know what I mean. Certainly nice, certainly attentive, but also often interrupting us to ask us what we needed. This might just be a function of the place being new (and I admit that it's certainly better than being ignored!) but it was noticeable.\n\nSome of the food we had was incredible: the Kobe beef carpaccio and the lobster carpaccio get five stars. The sushi, on the other hand, while good, was nothing to write home about. I felt like it was about the same as the good sushi I can get here at home, and it didn't compare to the sushi I had at Shibuya in MGM Grand.\n\nThat said, Yellowtail is a solid 4 stars, and I would go here again if I wanted to see and be seen while enjoying the good food."

The thinly sliced fish over a crispy cracker, drizzled with truffle oil...yummmm\n - Kumamoto oysters\n - Kobe beef tataki: delicious! The meat was so tender it melted in your mouth\n - Popping spicy crab: the reason we came back! It's basically a spicy crab roll...with pop rocks. Pop. Rocks. The candy!  Super fun to eat.\n - Shrimp tempura roll\n - Spider roll\n - Maguro sashimi: really good! \n - Brussel sprout: nicely seasoned \n\nWe have a good experience this second time around.

Okay I know all is like that, but...it was alright. the red beets were just julienned on top...nothing to write home about really\n-seaweed salad: rather interesting with the inclusion of non-traditional seaweed (i only recognized the wakame). this was rather bland 'cuz the dressing kept \"falling off\" into the bottom of the plate\n-assorted mushrooms:  HOLY FREAKIN' GOODNESS = reminded me of the frickin' delicious mushrooms @ Tokyo-Go-Go (SF)...'NUFF SAID (aka \"it tastes like it has buttah insoyde\" aka butter is totally in that awesome sauce and I dipped my ikura sushi rice in there to sop it all up)\n-ikura sushi: this was really good. actually no fishy taste at all and not too salty.  wow.\n-tamago sushi: um...this was like eating egg spongecake...we were confused.\n\nAmazingly we got full. Boyfriend had a $20 glass of champagne and that wasn't even the most expensive glass..it did taste better than my $12 champagne (don't ask why we were drinking champagne in Vegas). \n\nBeef 1: We did order the vegetable sushi roll, but they forgot about it, so we just took it off the bill.\n\nBeef 2: Our server suffered from tunnel vision. She was nice enough, and spoke clearly and whatnot, but we had a lovely time trying to flag her down.\n\nIf I find myself in the Bellagio again, I'm going to just go here for (overpriced) drinks and eat tons of the mixed mushroom plates. I felt like there's definitely better for the price, and I only give it 3 stars because of those mushrooms and the fresh-@$$ ikura.\n\nAnd for the record, we paid ~$86 for vegetables and a glass of the cheapest champagne they had.

We had already eaten the Buffet, so we narrowed it down to the four or five remaining restaurants. Yellowtail had the shortest line, and I had been in the mood for sushi for a few days, so we stopped in.\nThe setting is very intimate, very cool. There's a small section inside next to the bar, a few tables spread throughout the restaurant, and a few tables on a deck looking out over the casino floor. We were seated immediately, and the service was outstanding. Very, very beautiful hostesses and servers took care of us all night long.\nHad a few different rolls and a few orders of sashimi. The pace of the meal was pretty good, as we got our drinks and soup immediately, then slowly started receiving the rolls and sushi as the meal went on. It was at a good enough pace where you could eat and enjoy the meal, yet not have huge plates covering the table, spread out every which way. Overall, the quality of the sushi was very good, and the taste was great also. \nFor the restaurant, I was going to go with three stars. The food was good, but I've had better sushi at many local restaurants throughout the country, and it was WAY cheaper. The price of this restaurant certainly doesn't reflect the taste, although it was good, just not for the price. The service definitely knocked it up to four stars, however. Our waitress was exceptional, and the entire meal was very relaxing and enjoyable. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for sushi on the strip, as it probably won't get any cheaper unless you go somewhere else in Vegas. Definitely enjoyed the experience, and I would probably stop here again."

I eat various types of meat, chicken, beef, pork but no fish.  \n\nI got a text asking if I wanted to join everyone for dinner, of course I said \"yes\" before asking where they were taking me only to find out that it was Yellow Tail.

The bartender was very nice and they do have vanilla vodka, so I was happy with my drink.  We were seated shortly after and were quickly greeted by our server, he was very nice and attentive throughout the entire meal, he was great!\n\nSo my very funny coworkers decided to order a Chef sampling, so I ate nothing due to the fact it was all seafood.  The server noticed my lack of food, he felt terrible and offered to bring me some cooked meat... we decided upon a filet cooked medium.  My filet arrived shortly after the order and I promptly wolfed it down in about 3min flat.  I have never been so happy to see cooked beef in my life.  The filet was ok, cooked well and topped with some sizzling teriyaki sauce.  It wasn't as good as Prime, but given that this is a seafood place, I was just glad that they had the option.\n\nI did try some cold Saki for the first time ever.  I was scared at first but it turned out to be very good and was nice to sip along with the meal. \n\nI would return here for the service and beverages without question.

Had a variety of rolls (all of which tasted very fresh) but smaller portions than your typical sushi places. Rolls vary from your basic spicy tuna, shrimp tempura roll, and unagi rolls.  Yellowtail Tataki was very good (we ordered 3 of them after the first tasting). The pop rock candy roll was ok and something we would pass on the next time. 2 desserts (chocolate in a cup and green tea mousse) were very good (and our waiter picked them out). The dessert actually came with some type of mocha shot and was a nice way to wash down the dessert. 4 bottles of beer and the total was about $340.\n\nBeing in Vegas, this is not as authentic as R-23, but the ambiance and service make it a very enjoyable dining experience. We were fortunate enough to have a table next to the window and saw several Bellagio fountain shows and added that much more to the ambiance (music was great too). Our waiter was exceptional and not pushy at all about what to order. He took the time to explain items (I think his name was Roberto). Bonus that he picked out desserts that the wives loved. Would definitely go back to this place."

Enjoy extraordinary culinary selections from Chef Akira Back and libations provided by Wirtz Beverage.  Chef Akira Back has chosen to feature the Big Eye Tuna Pizza, Crispy Kalbi roll and his famous Baked Crab Hand Roll among other items.  Gulf Oyster Industry Counsel's amazing Oyster bar. Salty coastal waters produce the world's best oysters for the world's best chefs and restaurants, harvested today as they have been for generations.  Chef's menu will be paired with specialty reserved Sakes, Wines & Spirits provided by Wirtz Beverage and custom cocktails created by the mixologists from Hendrick's Gin and Tito's Vodka\" as described on the website, the actual format of the event was a standing circus of confusion where \"reserved\" tables were fed full trays of food while the rest attempted to hunt down one of four circulating servers that were frequently mobbed and stripped clean at the doors where 'diners' gathered like a group of kids playing World of Warcraft sitting on a spawn spot.\n\nWith booze of decent quality and the modicum of food equally competent a total of six mouthfuls of food plus three oysters were accrued by myself (one literally FROM a reserved table) during the course of the afternoon, probably justifying the $26 though certainly not $100 or the overall aggravation.  With no Akira in site and 'live music' that fell through for unknown reasons I can only assume that this 'event' was a money-grab intended to draw high rollers to The Bellagio or an attention-seeker for an outdated property hoping to generate new fans; both goals a miserable failure as we walked out in search of sustenance down the strip at Aria."

Yes, you could say it is overpriced and not so good and whatmore. Some of the items on the menu could just be considered mediocre, yet their signature dish were definitely worth calling them 'signature.'\n\nMy friend and I took all the recommendations of our kind server and had an overwhelming dinner. Their Big Eye Tuna was served first. It was to die for. I personally love truffle oil, and its scent and flavor all went well with the crispy tortilla and thinly sliced tuna. This is a must-try on their menu, and probably one of the best I had the night. Second, we got the Yellowtail jalapeno. There was nothing that really stood out or made it different to other japanese restaurants, so you could skip this. Then, we got the rock shrimp as a finale to our appetizers. This got us FULL. Their portion for rock shrimp which is simply popcorn shrimp marinaded in somewhat like a spicy mayo sauce was huge, but the overall taste got sick after few pieces. \n\nYes we thought we were full but we still managed to move onto our entrees, the rolls! Our server asked us couple questions and brought us out the Popping spicy crab roll and Happa roll. The happa was a little spicy but it was delicious. THEIR POPPING SPICY CRAB ROLL WAS THE BEST. it was probably one of the best rolls in my whole entire life. You may think pop rocks in sushi roll is weird, but trust me and get this roll. It is worth every buck that you pay for it. \n\nThe service was great as well. Just make sure that you have plenty of time if you were to dine here since they do take awhile to bring out your food. Our dinner was done after their signature dessert-chocolate in a cup, which was amazing-- in total we were there for about 2-3 hours. Long dinner but everything was amazing."

Angry Salmon Roll was delicious as was the California Roll, which had nice chunky pieces of crab as apposed to the crab salad you find at most sushi restaurants. Both rolls were the perfect size, I am not a fan of sushi restaurants that make the rolls so large you cannot fit them into your mouth in one bite. Tuna sashimi was fresh and very delicious, however kind of on the small side. All in all the prices were comparable to our local sushi restaurants. The staff was courteous and quite informative.

You can go to hundreds of Japanese restaurants and see the same exact menu... but to see things like sushi made with pop rocks or big eye tuna pizza- that jumps off the page. I love the originality!\n\nThe pop rock sushi was fun. The taste of sushi was fresh and delicious and then the aftertaste of the pop rocks fizzing in your mouth made it even more enjoyable. The tuna was delectable as well. Fresh and plenty of flavor and surprisingly easy to chew. I had other sushi rolls like spicy tuna and eel and avocado but those two items were the most memorable.\n\nAlso worth noting is the view. If you are fortunate enough to get a view of the fountain it doesn't get any better than that.\n\nAs many have already mentioned, the only complaint are the prices.

The decor was upscale, but trendy at the same time.  In addition to the extravagant decor inside Yellowtail, you're also spoiled with an absolutely breathtaking view of the famous Fountains of Bellagio.\n\nFirst off, I acknowledge that eating at Yellowtail comes with a premium.  And I already expected the increase in price from eating in Boston compared to eating in Vegas.  With those two factors in mind, I still found the prices a little on the high side.  Normally I'd be fine with paying a premium for high quality sushi, but for the price in Vegas and the sushi I got... I felt like the price I was paying was more for the surroundings and the location.  I found the dishes to be on the smaller size, but it's all about quality, not quantity.  Still would have liked to get a little more bang for my buck. Here are some of the rolls I tried:\n\nBig Eye Tuna Pizza - Micro Shiso, Truffle Oil\nSimply put, this thing is amazing and unique.  It's a stark contrast from the soft delicious tuna and the crunchy pizza crust.  It just all worked, very clean flavors.\n\nKobe Beef Tataki - Spicy Daikon, Garlic, Maldon Sea Salt\nThe Kobe Beef is cut paper thin, but it's the combination with the crunch of the garlic and the sea salt that makes this dish a sure winner.  Melts in your mouth.\n\nTai Snapper - Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Shiso, Tosazu\nThe extra virgin olive oil makes this dish divine.  The slight peppery taste gives the snapper a nice little kick.  Excellent stuff.\n\nToro Scallion Roll - Blue Fin Tuna Belly, Green Onion\nOn the small side, but a classic combination.  Fish was nice and fresh, rice was perfect.  Nothing special, just very solid.\n\nPopping Spicy Crab Roll - Cucumber, Asparagus, Pop Rocks\nAmazing and unique roll.  Yes, the description does say Pop Rocks.  Most unique roll I may have ever had."

You are here because you have fat bankroll, a generous sponsor and/or you're very very beautiful.  Unlike some of the more hip upscale places, there weren't any goofy spikey haired mtv types, which is a good thing.\n\nAlthough I normally evaluate the value of a place, it is difficult to do since I did not see the bill and probably if you are worried about getting your money's worth, you might as well just get a $14 cocktail and enjoy the atmosphere before grabbing a cab and having a giant feast on Spring Mountain for the same price as your cocktail.\n\nWe had spicy tuna rolls, flat iron kobe beef, beef tataki, seaweed salad, miso soup, halibut sashima (I think), potstickers, big eye tuna pizza (a surprising dish!), lobster bowl and some weird roll with pop rocks in them.  I made sure that I got full by adding a bowl of rice to my order.  Portions were generally tiny, though aside from the pop rocks, every dish was excellent.  Even the miso soup was done right.  Normally, I am a little bit more aware of the food, but I was a little buzzed and didn't have my inner yelp critic active.  Since they don't publish the menu nor do I have a receipt, I can't remember the exact dish names.\n\nAs a practical matter, if you are on a date here, try your best not to get whiplash.  The ladies are out in force here.  If you are here with the guys, then get a table in the waiting area instead of the inner restaurant.  It's the best view in the house.\n\nFinally, a shout out to our generous sponsor.  I doubt that I would have tried this place without 'em."

We were all staying at the Bellagio, so this was a great place as far as convenience goes. I was able to place my reservation online using the mLife portal.\n\nLet me start by saying Yellowtail is expensive. If you're looking to have dinner/drinks for a party of four, prepare to spend about $75-100 per person.\n\nThat being said, Yellowtail is also very delicious! We started by ordering some small plates (Gyoza, Edamame, Ceviche) which were shared. The Gyoza came out hot and crispy on the bottom, they were very full of flavor. The Ceviche is served with five fried wonton \"chips\" to use, and was very flavorful and had a strong citrus backing. The Edamame comes out served two ways, one small bowl with traditional steam and another tossed with a Chili Sauce. Trust me when I say this, get the Chili Sauce! It's FANTASTIC!\n\nFor our meal we ordered an assortment of sushi rolls, sashimi and nigiri. We had several special requests for preparation of these rolls and they were followed well. As other reviewers have said, the Crispy Kalbi is very special. Korean short ribs and slaw as a role? Sounds crazy, but it works!\n\nSo is Yellowtail overpriced? Yes, obviously ($14 for a 12oz can of Japanese Beer, for example). But show me one restaurant located in a casino that isn't. If you're willing to overlook the price, it's actually a really fantastic Sushi restaurant and fun dining experience."

When our drinks were brought mine was fine but my date had to ask the waiter for an extra shot of rum because his drink just tasted like soda (they brought it and didn't charge us, which was nice). The rolls came out very quickly but no scallops - the waiter said everything on the menu is an appetizer so they just bring out whatever comes up first.  That was weird to me.  The rolls (we ordered three different ones) were just blah, no decoration or sauce on the plate and we had to ask for soy sauce. The whole experience was just meh - our server seemed like he was losing his mind although it was a very slow night in the restaurant.  Someone who may have been the manager did check on us at least three times after the drink incident.  All in all, uninspiring rolls, weak drinks, way too expensive."

The seaweed salad was mediocre, just like any other seaweed salad at any other sushi joint, save yourself $9 on that. We stuck to water, so can't comment on the beverages. Waitstaff was courteous, on point with checking on us and refilling our water, and helpful with the menu items as we were newbies. Over all a great experience, and I'd say worth the money."

We usually stay at the Bellagio but because my husband does not eat sushi or fish of any kind, this isn't a restaurant I would pick for the two of us. However, we were meeting a friend who is a local and said we had to go.  We did and my husband was an instant fan.  A lot of their items are a shared plate (warm and cold) as well as the rolls, etc.  My friend and I shared the tuna pizza which is excellent!  It consists of a toasted tortilla (whole wheat I think) with thinly sliced red onion, some sort of white sauce and then the tuna on top.  Delish!  We also had the yellow tail which was good (a nice light fish).  My favorite was the king crab tempura.  To top things off we had a spicy tuna roll.  We would have loved to try more but there is only so much you can eat.  My husband had the aged Kobe beef flat iron steak which was sliced and served with a teriyaki sauce on top of some root vegetables.  He ordered this the 2nd time we were there as well but ordered a bowl of rice since he felt he needed a bit more to eat since he passed on sharing our plates.\n\nThe hostess was great, she remembered us right away.  There was one hostess (not at the desk) that sat us and she was not friendly at all but that did not detract from our night.  The waitstaff was so friendly and when we asked for suggestions, they were spot-on.\n\nI loved the whole ambience of this type of restaurant. First off, it overlooks the fountains at the bellagio.  The restaurant is small so make your reservations.  The music that played, the design, all great."

They set up a private table on their small balcony (it could only fit a table for 2) overlooking the fountains.  It was dusk so the lighting was perfect.  The noise was minimal.  We had most of the nigiri on the menu - from hamachi (yellowtail) to toro (tuna belly) to uni (sea urchin).  It's so hard to find fresh uni and yellowtail had the best!  I swear I could taste the ocean, it was so fresh!  The waiter said they had just been flown in from japan (not sure if he this was true but I didn't care b/c it was delicious).

            "review": "This place is so expensive but also so good! Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. I always leave this place satisfied and wanting more and with a hole in my wallet lol. Well, technically I'm not the one paying but you know what I mean. Last time we came with the party of 8 and the tab came out to be around $1,600 including tax and tip. \n\nLet's talk about the setting of the restaurant. It's located in the casino of Bellagio. It's next to the fountain. If you get seat by balcony like we did, you get to experience the fountain show from inside the hotel. It's a completely different feeling than experiencing it on the Strip. It's much closer that way and you can enjoy it without being in a huge crowd of people. As you'd expect from a high end restaurant, the setting inside is fancy. It's dim a little giving sense of romanticness, so it's a perfect place to take your date. \n\nThe food. There large selection of food and honestly they're all great. Though these are my personal favorites: tuna pizza, yellowtail, flat iron steak, ribeye, and Scottish salmon. \n\n-The tuna pizza is a thinly sliced pizza served with raw tuna on top. I thought it was an interesting combination at first. I mean, raw tuna on pizza? Does that even go together? Oh man, let me tell you, it does. And it does great. It has the soft and juiciness of the tuna and the crunchiness of the pizza. This was our party's favorite and we just kept ordering these. They come at $29 a plate though. \n-The yellowtail has got to the best yellowtail I've eaten. My go to food at most Japanese restaurants is grilled yellowtail cheek, so I've tasted plenty of yellowtails, but this is honestly the best one I've tasted. Well I mean you'd expect it to be good, afterall it's the name of the restaurant. The fish is juicy and soft and just melt in your mouth. It's not dry like some places. \n-I'm going to review the ribeye and flat iron together. They were both great. The quality of beef is excellent and it's super soft. However my only complaint was that they were a little burnt. Maybe the chef was a little off today, but the outside of the beef were a tad bit burnt. This wasn't the case with my previous visits. Aside from that it tastes heavenly. \n-The Scottish salmon also tastes great. Not much to say about it. Just your average salmon, but they just somehow seasoned it and made it taste so good. Maybe the chef used his secret sauce or something? ;) lol jk but seriously it's good."

One of the girls  is vegetarian, so of course she did not partake in any of the seafood dishes.  Nor did I, as I don't eat fish. A 7th girl joined us in Vegas the following day, so she did not dine at Yellowtail. \n\nTHIS IS THE ONLY THING WE DID DIFFERENTLY FROM EACH OTHER THE ENTIRE FIRST DAY OF OUR TRIP which is how we know that the food poisoning came directly from Yellowtail.\n\nThe next morning, all 4 girls INCLUDING THE BRIDE, who ate the fish & sushi came down with debilitating food poisoning symptoms.  Vomiting and other issues that I'm sure I don't need to spell out, kept them literally lying on the hotel bathroom floor for the remainder of our trip. The poor things were hardly able to stand and we were thankful that we had a suite with multiple bathrooms or we would have been in an even worse state.\n\nOur trip, and more importantly, the Bride's special weekend (and more--this food poisoning spell triggered her to experience vertigo which she is still suffering from to this day), were COMPLETELY RUINED.  The girls spent all day and night feeling like they literally might die, and the 3 of us who did not experience the symptoms , were force feeding them Gatorade and toast so that they wouldn't be hospitalized in Las Vegas with dehydration.\n\n7 girls, 7 RUINED trips. \n\nWe couldn't do any of the fun things we had planned and wasted a lot of money and time that we will never be able to get back.\n\nWe called the Bellagio right away to put in a complaint thinking that they would AT THE VERY LEAST, refund our dinner bill as a courtesy for our extreme inconvenience.  \n\nInstead, they proceeded to give us the run-around for weeks, passing us off from department to department--Security to \"Guest Services,\" to the restaurant itself, to the Light Group (who owns the restaurant), etc., and ultimately we were told that they would not be taking ANY responsibility and that we were basically sh*t out of luck. \n\nDO NOT EAT HERE.  Vegas has so many amazing and accommodating places to dine, and so many fun things to experience. Don't ruin your trip by eating at this irresponsible establishment."

            "review": "I would NOT eat here again.  The food way way too expensive for what we got.  We ordered a bottle of wine and I felt we got regular casino everyday glassware.   I would expect a nice expensive restaurant to have decent glasses not a glass you would receive while gambling or something.    \n\nThe tuna pizza was good but presentation rather boring.  We also ordered Kumamoto oysters which was about $32 for 6 and it was not anywhere near Asian inspired I felt like it was something I would have got at an Italian place.   Oysters and cocktail sauce is basically what we got.   We ordered the filet toban as well which smelled awesome but was nothing special.   The crispy kalbi roll was delicious but presentation was lacking!!!!  \n\nNow I don't mind spending money on my meal if the food and presentation and service was great but I wasn't really happy when I left.  The service was rushed and she didn't really listen to us, plus she kept telling us that was probably enough food in which was not and felt that she didn't have time for us.   Maybe she just wanted us to leave.  We were helped by another man who was dressed in a chef coat who was not the chef but was helping out he said and he was very personable and helpful more than our server was.  She kinda disappear towards the end.\n\nI Have high expectations for a restaurant in Bellagio and was highly disappointed.\n\nFood was ok...service lacking....and food presentation pretty plain.  Prices should be much lower for the quality of everything.    Even a sushi roll was between 20 and 30 which is fine is it's exceptional.\n\nIf you're looking for delicious Asian food Andreas at Wynn or chada Thai near China town is great and you get what you pay for!"

We wanted a few minutes to look over the menu and the server never came back to us. Instead another server came and took our order. We only ordered 3 items since we only had about 2 hrs before meeting up with friends.\n\nAfter our order was taken, the previous server came back and asked if we ordered. We told her we did and waited another 15 minute before we were served with Braised Kobe beef short ribs. \n\nHonestly, it tasted like something my dad could make for 1/3 of the cost. Wasn't impressed, but the next item that came did taste amazing. The Seared Diver Sea Scallops tasted Amazing! It was cooked perfectly and practically melted in your mouth.\n\nHere is where I have trouble understanding your service. I had to wait 30 minutes for the Big Eye Tuna Pizza. A cold dish. There was 3 servers that came over and asked me if I wanted to order more. Did it look like I was happy sitting there with no food on the table? I asked one server to check on it and she never came back. The second one actually checked on it and told me it's almost ready. The third one obviously wasn't told that people were working on it already. \n\nIt then took another 10 minutes to get the check. Is it because we came in late around 9:30? Is everyone rushing to get off work, so we end up getting a few minutes per server?\n\nSo the main reason I'm giving this place a 2 star rating is because of the horrible service."

Highly recommend  dinner for two reserved and seated outside to have the view of Bellagio water show. We had sushi and steak. The sushi was fresh, but the Kobe steak was not really hot and it felt like was placed under the cold lamp instead of hot lamp. The rib eye was tasty I would recommend that over Kobe. My wife ended up eating half of my rib eye and I did not mind switching with her. Over all good experience and if you first timer to see the water show that is a good dinning."

After 30 minutes of waiting for 2 sushi rolls (we were just getting a snack), I finally was able to get our server over to our table and ask what was going on.  Her response was that they were really busy; which was not the case.  Let me also say, once we had our drinks, she NEVER came back to our table.  Our food was brought to us by runners, and our server never even came back to see if we wanted another cocktail.  I have to say the food was excellent, as usual, and also very overpriced but I knew that going in.  I give the food a 4, the price a 2 and the service a 1.  Overall for me, terrible experience."

Both times I recently went we sat right next to a window overlooking the Bellagio fountains and the food and service were both phenomenal.  \n\nI've had the edamame, big eye tuna pizza, the Alaskan king crab tempura, the popping spicy crab aka pop rocks roll, and the filet mignon toban.  \n\nThe sweet chili that was added to the edamame made it very delicious.  The big eye tuna pizza is a dish that is an absolute must try.  It's difficult to describe the burst of flavor when you bite into it a piece, but it's excellent.  The crab tempura was fried to perfection and went really well with the sauces they served it with.  The spicy crab roll was unique because of the pop rocks they add to it.  The filet mignon melted in my mouth.  I also had a dessert that was made from nutella that was amazing.  I don't remember what it was called (dessert in a cup maybe?), but I would recommend it as well.  The overall quality of the food is good enough to justify the price you pay for it.  \n\nI would definitely call in advance and make a reservation.  Also, a lot of people dress up to eat here, but the atmosphere and vibe is laid back and relaxed enough that you can wear relatively casual attire and not feel under-dressed."

We stared at it for a good 30 seconds when it arrived.  The chicken entree literally came with 1 small carrot, 1 small piece of asparagus, and 1 pearl onion.  We do not have big appetites but the portion size here just did not justify the price.  Service was good but looked confused when we mentioned the portions seemed small in relation to the price.

It's myself, 7 other students, and a professor in town for a convention. After a lot of deliberation our waiter suggests letting him order, saying it'll be a good way to try the menu as well as making the price reasonable for us. He asks for our preferences so he can understand our tastes, and two of the students say they like California rolls - which should indicate to him their tastes are pretty basic. \n\nWe get one round. Four plates, all different, and share. It's kind of cool we think. Then another round comes out, two orders of two items. Then another. And another. Progressively going up the menu. \n\nAfter about our 5th round the waiter tells us everything he ordered is in and now we just need to wait for the rest to come out. After this, two orders of a $60 dish come out. Then more rolls. Then two orders of a $130 dish come out. At this point, everyone is full and wondering why this waiter has ordered us so much food. Food that some people can't even enjoy because it's too eclectic for their tastes. Another order comes out. Then another, four rolls that are barely touched because everyone is so full. \n\nWe've barely touched that order before the next thing comes out. Luckily someone says \"No. We're done eating.\" Afterwards our waiter comes over, leans into the ear of the girl who organized our dinner and somewhat snarkily says \"Just so you know... Well, nevermind.\" And walks off. Then we get the bill.\n\nOur bill is about $1300 and our waiter has guaranteed himself about a $200 tip because of the automatic gratuity placed on tables of 8 or more. \n\nOur server took advantage of us. He knew we were young students. He knew we were indecisive about our tastes. He knew that amount of food was way too much. And yet, he put in at least 11 courses of food, possibly more. \n\nWhy wouldn't he place 3 courses, ask if we would like more of what we had or if he's matching our tastes, then continue? Why would he place THAT MANY orders at once?\n\nThe service here completely ruined my faith in Yellowtail. Between being shoved in the back and having to wait forever to get refills on drinks and our experience with a waiter who knew he ordered too much food that was too expensive for a group of 20-22 year olds and a professor, likely because of an automatic gratuity, I don't know if I can return. If your waiter is a tall man with glasses and closely cropped hair, do not let him order for your group.\n\nIf, despite reading how they treat their customers, you decide to est at Yellowtail anyway, give the tuna pizza a try. That and a few other dishes are slightly redeeming qualities of this restaurant, but I'll never forget the way their staff abused the trust of myself and my peers."

Very much not to the standard of Bellogio casino this restaurant service and food  should get better to the 5 star rating or should close down."

We started with some sparkling sake with blueberry puree.  It was actually really good, seemed like an odd combination at first, but clearly they know more about these things than I do because it worked quite well.  The sweet chili sauce on the edamame was all very good.  The sushi wasn't anything special.  It was good, but nothing I'd go out of my way for.  \n\nThe dining room was very pretty and the ambiance was nice.  It's Vegas, if they can't make you comfortable in a restaurant then you're in the wrong place.  Considering the prices you're paying I expect a comfortable dining experience.  Overlooking the Bellagio fount is a nice addition to a dinner.  I have a hard time calling anything in Vegas \"romantic\" but I suppose this should be deemed a romantic restaurant.  \n\nSeems like the place was crawling with staff, every direction you look there's a server or hostess descending on you.  It was a little on the annoying side, but the food and drinks made up for it. \n\nOverall, it was pretty good.  If you're looking for good sushi on the strip Yellowtail is a good place to start your search."

The service was extremely spotty.  \nWe had a large party, and I do understand if certain mistakes are made during busy hours.  However, they weren't super crowded.  Took a while for everything to come out.  What I really disliked the most was the waiter dropping off everything at certain spots of the table.  If you're a fancy sushi restaurant, wouldn't you at least know or remember who ordered which food and where it went? Also, there was clearly timing issues, and dishes came out one or two at a time.  For a large party, some people had to watch others eat.  It just amazed me how they dropped off the food, and since we were a large party, it took a while to determine who had ordered it.... And the waiter was pretty clueless also! The food itself was pricy, yet it was decent. The edamame was good, as it was well seasoned.  Besides that, definitely not worth it.  I would only go here again if I was forced to... If not, definitely visit other sushi places on the strip!!"

The multitude of restaurants and Buffet is excellent and the price never bothered me, until now. \nThe \"dynamite\" Seafood dish was a mush of mostly canned corn, fried old shrimp and chewy leftover scallop pieces  amalgamated in an overly sweetened mayonnaise sauce.  EXCEEDINGLY OVERPRICED at $32. \nFor four small lumps of Kobe ribs, you pay $42.  Each refill of Coca cola was $5. \nVery limited menu overall. Sushi is average and again, OVERPRICED at about $7-8 a PIECE. The Japanese yellowtail sashimi was tasteless and rubbery, for example.  \nBut lets talk about the worst service for an over-hyped restaurant where the decor cost needed to be made up in what you pay for bad food.  Each dish came out within 20min of each other.  Each person at my table waited and watched as the other person finished his meal.   Waiter said he would bring our meals but never did.  My second drink came at the end of my meal. \nAfter paying $250 for a meal that deserved $50 I MUST SAY THAT THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST DISAPPOINTING MEAL, EVER!\nIf any person from management of Yellowtail sushi would like to discuss this further, I am happy to do so."

For my entree I had a flatiron with asparagus that was topped with an amazing teriyaki-like steak sauce. Couldn't have been happier with the service and food, check this place out next time in Bellagio!!"

Our sushi was made separately by the chef so as to not cross contaminate with gluten items in the kitchen.  The sushi was well presented and tasty with the gluten free soy sauce and wasabi.

The tuna pizza was one of our faves, and this was actually the first time I ever tried Uni (yum!!).  We also had some tasty drinks here, I wish I could be more helpful and remember the names of the drinks but they were tasty enough so you couldn't taste the alcohol, but not too sweet, and definitely refreshing.  I think it might have had something to do with melon??  Anyway, along with the food and drinks you can go outside to their balcony and get a fabulous view of the watershow at night."

I got the same lychee cocktail as I always get but this time I switched up the entr\u00e9e and stuck with the sushi side of the menu. It was a much better choice. The ambience here looks fancy, and it's priced fancy, but one of my friends was let in with a bro tank and swim trunks which is much appreciated. \n\nDo not pass on the sushi roll with the pop rocks and crab! It was the funkiest, coolest roll ever! We had to order another one for the table because we liked it so much."

            "review": "Definitely not my usual price point for sushi... I'd rather go to a steakhouse or something for the same amount of money.  That being said, the ambiance was pretty nice.  The decor was dark and sleek, and our server was decent (he did forget to bring us tamari, but other than that, great).  We could also look out the window and see a little bit of the Bellagio fountain show, and it was neat to see it from inside the building.\n\nI also liked the sommelier.  She was able to take two different wine preferences (dry vs. \"sweet!  I like Moscato!\") and recommend something in the middle that would appeal to both types of palates (still a little too sweet for my liking, personally, but a good compromise).\n\nWe shared the seared diver sea scallops (\"mustard potato puree, cherry tomato\").  These scallops were cooked very nicely and were garnished with a smear of the potato puree, which was too sweet, and a roasted cherry tomato.  The only thing was... there were two scallops.  They were 1.5 inches in diameter and had been cut in half so that there would be four pieces arranged delicately on the plate.  For $23, I think at least one more scallop would have been nice.\n\nNext up was the popping spicy crab roll (\"cucumber, asparagus, pop rocks\").  Umm, it had pop rocks in it.  How could we not resist?  This was really fun to eat and actually worked a lot better than I expected.\n\nWe also ordered the unagi roll (\"cucumber, sesame seeds, eel sauce\").  Eel is always good and this was no exception.  These rolls were all a bit on the small side though.  Actually, I could have eaten the scallops and the rolls on my own, and then I would have been full.  But that would have cost me $50+.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't choose to come here, but this was a nice place for a group of friends to chill and drink some wine (marked up from $20 to $55).  Such is my experience with Vegas... I don't gamble.  Instead, I lose a lot of money whenever I dine out, haha."

We ordered a ton of dishes and while the \"signature\" or special dishes were the BEST EVER, the spicy tuna roll (which I think is a pretty basic staple) was the only let down really.\n\nI tried the following dishes, and I have listed in order of how amazing they were:\n\n1. Yellowtail Serrrano - go figure, the yellowtail dish was the best dish at a restaurant named Yellowtail. Thinly sliced with jalapeno and cilantro, the worst part of this was it was 6 pieces and there were 5 of us... dilemma.\n2. Rock Shrimp Handroll - this was so yummy, I didn't even offer a bite to the others.\n3. Big Eye Tuna Pizza - I'm unsure why others don't like this... it was delicious and a perfect appetizer.\n4. Rock Shrimp / Tempura Alaskan King Crab - these were similarly prepared dishes but complemented each other well. When the Rock Shrimp would get a bit too sweet, the Alaskan King Crab balanced it nicely.\n5. Red Dragon roll - I only got one piece of this, but it was the best Red Dragon I've ever had. I think the others agreed with me as... you know... I only got one piece.\n6. Fillet Mignon Toban - sizzling and amazing. It comes out in a tiny skillet with the best mushrooms I've had in a while. The only reason it's this low on the list is because that is just how awesome all the other food was.\n\nNow, the last two are the only two that we didn't finish, or I wouldn't order again:\n7. Kobe Beef Tataki - maybe because it came out with the Yellowtail and just couldn't hold it's own. I really can't remember that much about it.\n8. Tempura Veggies - run-of-the-mill like the spicy tuna roll.\n\nI want to go back again and get a table by the windows so I can watch the fountains of the Bellagio while I feast on fish."

Nice and light! The king crab tempura was outstanding- nothing like i have had before in terms of SUBSTANTIAL King Crab. Rock shrimp roll was good, I would most likely try something different next time. The protein roll is a must!  Cup of chocolate was a great twist on a classic! Banana foam is a nice touch!\n\nAll is all, amazing meal, amazing service! So why the four stars instead of five? Well I was looking around and it seems that We got lucky with our waiter! Next to us, i was watching a waiter pour beer into a class(not tilted) and it completely over flowed on the table. The waiter seemed to just walk away before he could watch the inevitable happen. Also, it seems theres a lot of confusion with tables, many of the food runners were making mistakes around us involving table numbers. Either a lot of the runners don't know the table numbers or theres a lack of communication.\n\nLast words: sushi rice was warm- GREAT hard to find warm sushi rice anywhere! They are good with allergies such as Celiac!"

Lmao\n \nRight away we ordered the edamame, in which we wanted both bowls to be sweet chili instead of sea salt (the best way to order them). \n\nThere were a few things on the table... Let's see if I can remember them all.   \n\nMy favorite roll is the high steaks! It's a shrimp tempura roll topped with filet mignon and A1 sauce. It's a interesting combination... But a good one. \n\nMushroom as a side.... Soooo much flavor!!!! \n\nRock shrimp- a little dry. Not as good as Nobu\n\nChilean Sea bass- great tasting... Small serving. \n\nNope, can barely remember anything else (I had a lot to drink) but I'll post the pictures! \n\nJust make sure when you come here you bring both of your wallets, because it won't be a cheap night out. Also, if you're in a big group they don't split checks... Not even three ways!!!!"

Located inside Bellagio, if you reserve seats outside, you will have a nice view of the Bellagio Fountains (which performs every 15 and 30 minutes). The place is elegant for dinner, dimly lit, and loud with the sounds of other table guests. Our reservations were for 9pm, but was seated around 9:30pm, so just be cautious about time if you are on a schedule.\n\nThis is what we ate:\n1. Big Eye Tuna Pizza $26 - thin crust on the bottom and tuna on the top, good to share, and definitely should try if you never had it before.\n2. Grilled Eggplant Skewers $12 - sweet miso sauce with sesames, soft mushy eggplants. I would pass on it to try other things.\n3. Popping Spicy Crab Roll $16 - House recommendation, actual pop rocks within the roll, very interesting, a must try!\n\nWe also ordered a bottle of sake, there are lots of selections. You can also grab a beer or glass of wine.\n\nService was attentive, they came back a few times to see if we needed more sake, more food, and filled up our glasses of water. I left feeling pretty good, and would come back for another nice dinner occasion."

We showed up precisely at 9:30 and checked in, were asked to give them a minute and please go to the bar if we wished. We waited a couple minutes for a place at the bar to open up and then ordered a drink. We sat and watched as walk ups were seated before us, including a couple of girls who walked up and hugged the hostess and were seated immediately. While I am not too stupid to understand that some people \"deserve\" to be seated immediately, it was disheartening seeing walk-ups get seated before us. I guess I wouldnt have a problem if they said they dont accept reservations, but they do, so I didnt understand the point of having one if it took 20-25 minutes to get seated.\n\nSo with that negative, lets say a positive. Our servers was perhaps the best server Ive had at any restaurant, high end or otherwise. I believe his name was Nick. Just wanted to give a shout-out because he was that good. We never ask to speak with management, but made sure we did this time to put in a good word for our server.\n\nSo, the food. It was good, and some of it great. Pricey, but then again, we knew that going in.\n\nThe yellowtail Serrano appetizer was outstanding. It practicably melted in my mouth. The Gyoza app was good, but nothing special.\n\nThe edamame was good too, I mean, its edamame, how could you mess it up? I wasnt a fan of the sweet chile flavor, but the gf loved it. The japanese pickles salad was awesome!\n\nOne of their signature rolls is the Popping Spicy Crab...it was ok. Seemed a little gimmicky, but wasnt bad. The yellowtail scallion roll was very tasty, as was the spicy tuna roll. I also had some scallop sashimi...it was very tender and had good flavor.\n\nOverall impression, it was good, but slightly over-priced. You pay for the atmosphere and to be at the \"cool\" place to be. Dont get me wrong, the food was good, and I wouldnt hesitate to go back again, but just be warned you arent going to be absolutely blown away with some new type of sushi. You are going for good sushi (better than 90% of places), and for the atmosphere with outstanding service (once you get seated)."

The star of the show was the walu in tosazu sauce - the best-cooked whitefish I have ever had, in a vinegary and savory broth that I wanted to drink with a straw.\n\nThe lobster carpaccio was also a hit with my fiancee, a crustacean nut who gobbled it down happily.  The cilantro was used liberally, which didn't mind me but could be off-putting to those who think it can overpower dishes.\n\nThe only dish that I would not have ordered again was the eggplant skewers.  The eggplant itself was nice and meaty, with a good char, but the sweet miso sauce was just way too sticky and sweet for my taste - going with a less sweet, more spicy drizzle (and using less of the sauce) would've made a world of difference!\n\nIf you want to splurge with a date in Vegas, make a reservation and be clear you want to get a seat by the window (or outside if it is nice).  They have unparalleled views of the fountains at the Bellagio, and you can get one of the lightest, tastiest meals in Vegas.  Of course, your wallet will also come out lighter too, so perhaps best enjoyed after a lucky day at the slots/blackjack tables!"

When the plate hit the table, we looked like gremlins after midnight, devouring each piece like it was the last piece in existence.  \n\nRewind to us waiting for our table and them trying to place us facing the smoky and noisy casino. No... $100 later and we're on the outdoor balcony facing the famous bellagio fountains.  That's more like it.  \n\nWe ordered uni and we were presented with a small portion of nigiri.  After describing that we literally wanted a \"pile of uni\" on a plate, the waiter quickly returned with exactly that.  We scarved that down with smiles until more sushi came out.  I would say the fish was wonderful, fresh, and paced well.  \n\nIt's not cheap, but it's great if you are in the mood to splurge or if you won some $ at the tables and have extra cash to throw around.

For background: My mother is Japanese, and I've been fortunate enough to visit many times. I don't need my Japanese food to be authentic, but it does have to taste good.\n\nYellowtail's food is neither authentic nor good. The glazed salmon I ordered was soaked in a sugar sauce, sweet to the point of being inedible. (My theory: To cover up the fact they serve cheap salmon.)\n\nTo their credit, when my waiter came over, he immediately asked me what was wrong. When I told him, he quickly replaced the dish with something edible but completely forgettable. (The good service is the only thing that brings Yellowtail up to two stars.) My wife had a similar experience. The food is more \"Japanese-y\" than Japanese.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I had a severe stomach ache for the rest of the night - a distraction to say the least when I was trying to enjoy Cirque du Solei. The Bellagio hotel staff were completely unhelpful to the point of belligerence, but that's a story for another time.\n\nMy wife and I are already planning our next trip to Vegas. We would have considered staying at the Bellagio. But after our experience with Yellowtail (and Bellagio), we're going back to the Wynn. They certainly know how to treat customers well there."

My wife and I read the mixed reviews and decided to try it since we love sushi and unique dining experiences. I'd  have to say, this was one of the only vegas \"higher end\" meals that had left us disappointed, and sorry we didn't heed the warnings of those who had been disappointed  before us. We eat a LOT of sushi,  probably 6x or more a month. We tried two rolls (for a total of OVER $50) and were  completely  underwhelmed.  I've paid the same for similar sized rolls at sushi roku in Ceasars and didn't regret the price for a second because it was that good. Yellowtail? Meh.. ok flavor, pretty small size. Then we ordered  salmon sushi. My wife and I both laughed out loud when the order came. Others have scoffed at the size of the sushi pieces and we should have listened. I honestly can't even describe how small they were. I guess the best I could day is, take a standard \"pink eraser\" from when you were a kid in school, cut it in half, and that's the size of the order.  For $12. And, it was just ok. \n\nThen we get to the service. We were in vegas on a Sunday night. It was dead. Walked right into this place and could have had a seat on the terrace on the fountains had we asked. That's how dead it was. The waiter was running around like he had never been busier, checked on us maybe once and in the midst of his \"rush\" failed to bring a BOWL OF RICE that we ordered for my son. We had two rolls and a salmon sushi delivered approximately 20+ minutes after we had ordered, ate them and then sat around waiting for him to come back. He looked shocked when he asked if we wanted anything  else and I asked if we could get the food we ordered in the first place before we moved on to anything else. \n\nMy wife and I eat out A LOT. It's a passion to try new things and explore new places. This place fell dead flat. Extremely disappointed  and thus, doubtful  we would ever return. Too many other great options out there. Not to mention much cheaper. It's unfortunate.  Great location and concept and beautiful decor."

I agree that the price is definitely a lot higher than your average Japanese restaurant, but aside from paying for the incredible quality of fish, you're mostly paying for the real estate so it's a great place for a date! The ambiance is romantic and ideal for beginning your night out since they have a trendier atmosphere. They're in Bellagio Hotel which is centrally located on the Las Vegas Strip and sits by the lake overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  Also, trust me when I say this... Yellowtail has some of the best servers in the hospitality industry.  Every time I come here, the service is impeccable; personable, knowledgeable and top-notch, worthy of Bellagio.\n\nRoll Call - \n\n*Ahi Tuna Pizza - MY FAVORITE! Thinly sliced grade AAAAA ahi on a light, crisp tortilla with a magical onion and mayo blend, topped with micro greens and...TRUFFLE OIL!\nI've personally had friends tell me they don't like tuna OR onions OR mayo and then I introduced them to the tuna pizza and BAM! Life-changing.\n\n*Baked Crab Hand Roll - What is up with soy paper? I love anything wrapped in soy paper! And this isn't your typical grossly baked, oozing with burnt mayo roll. The crab itself is baked, I believe. This roll will make you MOL (Moan Out Loud). \n\n*Crispy Kalbi Roll - I don't know how this came to be but it definitely works! I love the texture of this roll - meaty, crunchy (from the slaw), and juicy! It also has complementing temperatures of hot and cold in your mouth!\n\n*Grilled Walu - Of course it's amazing and buttery and just melts in your mouth. Just don't order too many or you may end up on the toilet the rest of the night since Walu is like a natural laxative. You're absolutely fine if you have a few bites and it's worth the small risk since it's fatty and delicious!\n\nAnd then if you want a fun novelty roll, get the Popping Spicy Crab roll. I'm personally not big on it only because it's a pretty simple roll (crab, asparagus, cucumber) with pop rocks in it but I have to order it whenever I bring someone to Yellowtail for the first time and they always love it! \n\nMy 5 O'Clocktail is the Lychee Martini! It pairs wonderfully with everything on the menu & you don't have to love lychee to enjoy this beverage!\n\nStay classy Las Vegas and thanks for stopping by!"

In fact, everyone just orders their own plate now, and we share everything else!  \n\nFor those complaining about prices, you should make sure you sit on the patio facing the fountains.  Its an amazing experience to be so close while having dinner.  That's what you are paying for as well.  \n\nDear Management - wish you guys were open later.  There is nothing in the Bellagio open after 11pm.  Maybe keep the bar area open till 1am or something on a late night menu.  You guys close way too early!"

            "review": "4.5 stars, rounded up-- mostly for the fact that their service has been the cream of the crop in Vegas every.single.time. Along with this, the restaurant is very hip and trendy yet maintains a beautiful and almost addicting ambiance. \n\nI've now visited Yellowtail on 4 separate occasions, all very impressive. As aforementioned, their service is truly top-notch; At times I felt that there were anywhere between 3-5 wait staff members assigned to our table; on one occasion, we had 7 different members visit our table. However, none of this was overbearing to the point where our party felt uncomfortable or \"too\" helped, if that makes sense. Perfect balance. Also, I'm a water snob, and my water glass was never less than half-full. Wheeee.\n\nSome patrons have docked stars because Yellowtail is so expensive. Well, I can't blame them, as I almost docked a star because of its price tag. I try to reason that \"it's Vegas, and everything is overpriced, and blahblahblah *insert the voice of the teacher over the intercom in Charlie Brown / Peanuts.*\" Anything to assuage the bill's amount....riiiight? \n\nA few of our favorite items include: \n\n--Big Eye Tuna Pizza ($26): Quite the delectable item, but make sure that you don't mind truffle oil! The oil is strong but brings out some additional nice qualities of the tuna sashimi. All served on a crisp \"pizza\" crust, this appetizer is best split between 2-3 people. \n\n--Tempura Alaskan King Crab ($23): My mouth waters just thinking of this...nom nom nom. Tender pieces of fresh king crab with just the right amount of tempura battering. Served with some shaved serrano (think like bitter jalapenos) and a delicious sweet ponzu, we make sure to get this each time. A great starter for 2-4. \n\n--Cucumber Salad ($8): Probably their most basic menu item besides the miso soup, but the bountiful, thin shavings of cucumber mixed with the delicious sweet/vinegary liquid makes this something we always crave. \n\n--******Baked Crab (or Rock Shrimp) Hand Roll ($10): This is probably my family's favorite little dish at Yellowtail. My mom always cracks me up when she says that \"we need to order the little burrito things!\" May seem a bit funny, but these really do resemble mini burritos. We love both variations of the hand roll-- I personally prefer the crab-- and we once got carried away and didn't realize that our party of 8 had ordered 10 of them until the bill came out. Sorry we're not sorry..? I'm sure our waitress loved us that night. \n\n--Popping Spicy Crab ($17): If nothing else, this is worth a try. Very unique with the pop rocks embedded in the roll. \n\n--Shrimp Tempura ($14): Extremely basic, but tasty nonetheless.\n\nTIP: Their specialty cocktails are good, but for $20, I'd rather stick that into a video poker machine, test my luck, and tip the cocktail waitress for 2-3 premium drinks. \n\nOverall: Yellowtail keeps us coming back with its impeccable service, unique ambiance, and fantastic flavors."

The crab and shrimp hand rolls are great and the the roll with the pop rocks is very unique. The atmosphere is nice and hip without being too loud and over the top.

That was not going to cut it. So we looked through the restaurants in Bellagio and passed Yellowtail. It was a bit more than I wanted to spend but we were hungry and tired. \n\nWe were sat immediately. I must say it is a beautiful restaurant. The rear of the restaurant looks out over the Bellagio fountains so we could watch the fountain show from our seats. \n\nNow to the food...the kid got edamame and gyoza. The edamame came 2 ways: with sea salt and with thai sweet chili sauce. Edamame with sauce was very tasty. Then wife and I ordered 2 sushi rolls. The one that stands out had pop rocks in it. It was surprisingly good. For entree I ordered Kobe Flat Iron Steak and my wife had Scottish Salmon. Both delicious but portions were on the small side, typical of over-priced Las Vegas restaurant. The food is so expensive because they don't turn the tables so you have to make all you can get off of each table.\n\nUnlike some of the other reviews we had good service.\n\nWe enjoyed the food but $170 including tip is a little steep for edamame, gyoza, 2 rolls, salmon, steak, and green tea cake. If we had more time we probably would have gone to Michael Mina or made our way to another celebrity chef restaurant. I am not going to fault them on stars due to price because that is what good Vegas restaurants cost. I would only complain if the food did not equal the price."

The cocktail with cucumber was AWESOME!  \n\n3 complaints: Sake menu is pretty unfamiliar for most people, and the very nice girl who helped us by making recommendations only pointed out extremely expensive bottles, like $250+... ummmm... no.  So we felt like douches because despite everything she suggested, we chose an $80 bottle because that's more reasonable for us... to us, it's sake.  It's not Opus One.  Some people might disagree, but I just wish her suggestions were a bit more varied. \n\nSecondly, the seating is too close together.  The tables where we were seated are all situated along a bench, and you sit THISCLOSE to strangers right next to you.  It makes for an uncomfortable dinner, because I didn't feel like I could talk to my husband freely without feeling like everyone was listening in to our conversation.\n\nLastly, when you order lots of small plates, I expect the server to stagger them so that you receive one or two, and then you get a break between.  This is the way our meals have always been at Yellowtail in the past.  This time, our table was suddenly loaded down with all 4 of our choices within maybe 10 minutes time (or likely less).  We felt very rushed and not relaxed at all.  That part sucked.\n\nIf the service had been a bit better and we hadn't been jammed in with strangers, this rating would be much higher.  The food itself and the atmosphere is amazing."

In a nutshell, if your looking for Japanese food this place can be skipped. If your looking for a hybrid type of food this place is just ok. \n\nTuna pizza - this was the highlight of the dinner. Thinly sliced tuna on a fried tortilla with a few greens on top and a slash of truffle oil. It is tasty and you can really taste the truffle oil.\n\nMiso Cod - basically it is butterfish. This as always a winner. It is served with a sake foam that actually does add something to the dish. It also comes with a pickled cauliflower to tasted like a red plum. \n\nSushi - here is when things go all wrong. The sushi was cut thin and a small piece. Even tough the fish is fresh, you can't taste it because their is not enough of it. It reminded me of buffet sushi. I take that back. Buffet sushi in some ways is better than what we were served. \n\nA Japanese Resturant doing sushi at that price point   needs to do it well. I'll say it again. Disappointing."

The seafood dynamite was the least refined of the dishes, very stew-like but still good. We were offered a special roll that was made with Maine lobster, it had flavor reminiscent of the tuna pizza which we loved and the lobster was excellent. The unagi, maguro and shiro maguro were all very nice.\n\nOur server, Teo (sp?), was attentive and made our experience a comfortable one.

They were regular rolls. A regular tuna roll which is $5.00 anywhere you go (tuna, rice wrapped in seaweed), at yellowtail, it was $16.00..I will admit the salmon Sashimi and the salmon sushi was delicious. 4 ppl, did not eat much as all, $450.00...We actually left Yellowtail so disappointed and hungry and went for another dinner. The second place was better for a fraction of the price. Went to RA in the fashion mall. Now this place isnt the best, but we had a much better meal, we ordered more food than we did at Yellowtail and the check was $100.00...I never take the time to write reviews, but this yellowtail was so disappointing and overpriced that i had to write a review..PPl, stay away.........Now i see a lot of people giving this place 4 & 5 stars...Fake..Fake ratings...PPL in Vegas are being paid to write up bogus reviews in behalf of this place..There is no way this place should ever get 5 stars..They only thing that gets 5 stars for this place is the decor..IT is really nice..But they are charging you for it..NO thanks...Yellowtail get Yellowfail...If there was a a seventh dollar sign, i would pick it..$14.00 for 2 pieces of sushi or sashimi...That is $7.00 per piece..Terrible.."

They need to learn from Nobu here.  $30 tuna pizza- pricey but worth it bc it's original. $60 for one order of toro sushi (2 pieces).... Not so much. \nService- if I had nothing else planned for the evening, it might be mildly tolerable. We put in an order for 6 items and they rolled out 20-25 apart. Nobody wants to put a tiny piece of fish in their mouth and wait 20+ minutes for the next piece. When we tried to order more food, the server told us that everything roll-like will take 40 minutes and that we should only order off the appetizer page. Obviously this limited our ordering substantially. \n\nThis was my first time asking for a manager at a restaurant and he told me that these wait times were very normal. Not how you want to treat guests in my opinion. Never had such an experience at Nobu, Mastros, Katsuya, Mizumi, or anywhere else in LA or Vegas. This ruined the experience for me.\n\nIt was a special night for us (anniversary, which nobody mentioned or cared about) and we wanted to have a great time.

Surprisingly, yes, the chicken.  It was the last entree, and one bite was so tender & moist, we couldn't resist our stuffed silly selves.  my stomach wanted to explode like a ticking time bomb, and wait... there's more.  a ginormous dessert platter, i nearly lost my ability to breathe.  luckily i savored more than i sweet, so after a few bites, i was able to.. slowly....put...down...the....spoon....... easy there.\n\ndecadence knows no boundaries!"

After much contemplation we finally decided to get some sushi at Yellowtail.\n\nThe decor inside the restaurant was amazing! However, the sushi was just ok, and considering the fact that it was waaaaaaay to expensive, I'm not likely to come back.\n\nI did think the pop-rock crab roll was very cool, although it didn't taste all that good."

It's very dark, as you start to walk around the room you just think this place is breathtaking. My experience at Yellowtail was early this Spring just as the Vegas weather was beginning to change. You have the option to dine out on the patio with a view of the Bellagio Fountains. SIT ON THE PATIO, IT WILL MAKE THIS PLACE MAGICAL. I swear you could fall in love on that patio! I couldn't even imagine this, there are many great views in Las Vegas but how many can you see people on the strip, hear the water spraying from the fountains, and be surround by beautiful lights in the center of everything.\n\n\nI'm not even a huge Sushi fan, however my boyfriend is and we just we're floored on how fresh and delicious everything was.  \n\nStarted out with,\nThe Tofu Miso Soup, Lobster Carpaccio, and Kobe Beef Tataki. Oh my does the Tataki own! Loved it, the amazing blend of garlic and sea salt. Next came out the Cucumber salad. Everything was so yummy, I must say. \n\nFor our entrees we got the Jidori Chicken with veggies, and I got the Kobe Flat Iron with veggies. The chicken was really good, juicy and well flavored but def not a dish you would eat with chopsticks in my opinion. I'm a Flat Iron-oholic and this was no disappointment! The only thing I think Yellowtail is lacking on is a solid selection of dessert. I have a serious sweet tooth. :) All in all, Glitz and Glamour. I'm enamored."

            "review": "No, No, No, No...and No...You've been warned. \n\nSadly, everything was wrong about this dinner. We made a reservation on Saturday morning for an evening dinner there. We like to do a ton of research and try new places, because well, it is Vegas and there's a jazillion restaurants to try. Frankly money doesn't matter to me (though it is nice to feel like you are getting what you pay for).  If the food, service, and ambience are great, then it is worth it.  I like to leave a place happy and satisfied.  But, on the other hand, if you drop ~$200 (for two mind you) to eat what amounts to nothing (and not remarkable either), then we've got issues. \n\nWe arrived for our 6:30pm reservation and were greeted by the hostess(es), who all wear the same tiny black dress with extreme amounts of cleavage baring cut-aways. Being a dude, I don't mind this much, though I will be respectful to my lady and not ogle or point.  I mention this because my girlfriend was appalled by a couple of the girls, and as she \"pointed out\" an Asian hostess seemed to have gotten the wrong size dress because her assets were on display. Not sure how cold it was in there all day, but it was beyond a tit bit nipply for this lady.   My gf was put aback by this at an upscale place.  Strike one for low class wandering exposed boobage.\n\n(As for the d\u00e9cor, location, and the restaurant. It is a dimly lit, very woody feeling, and warm (dark) hues of browns and low orange light. I liked the ambience and d\u00e9cor. This is the one earned star.) \n\nNext up we got seated. Sadly no fountain views were available though I had asked for it...not a big deal. Our server was all hopped up and excited, which can go either way...but she really, really, really was pushing the Big Eye Tuna Pizza appetizer...hard core...so we bit at it much to my dismay (I wanted the Toro) and it was a super thin cracker with way too much truffle aioli on it, and the thinnest slices of tuna ever fashioned. It was \"6 pieces\" but honestly I could have put back 3 or 4 orders of these things for the amount of food an \"appetizer\" should have been.  We were both not impressed.\n\nWe also ordered an Organic Field greens salad, a Rock Shrimp (warm plate), the Protein Roll, and the Toro Scallion roll. Also we ordered a two-person pot of hot green tea because it was effing cold in Vegas this past weekend (and even dusted some snow!??!). Quick reviews:\n\n- The Big Eye Tuna Pizza was just a $29 waste...not even tasty (see above).\n- The field greens salad was acceptable...and simple salads should not be the highlight of one's dinner experience.\n- The Rock Shrimp were over fried, hard, and just smothered in chili oil. Our local sushi place in LA has a similar dish where the shrimps stay moist, meaty, and the fried batter is a doughy, spicy delight. Here it was like eating rocks. I am being serious...they were so overcooked, I couldn't tell that it was a shrimp dish. \n** Meanwhile our bubbly server is asking us every other minute what we want to order next, we got so frustrated with her constant up-selling, it detracted from \"trying\" to enjoy the food we ordered **\n- The Protein roll was okay. I thought the flavors worked. But the portion and roll size were embarrassingly small. 7 disjointed pieces, not symmetrical in cut, super small in diameter...this would NOT have passed for an appetizer, let alone a $32 entr\u00e9e roll.\n- The Toro Scallion Roll was tasty, but again it was too small, and weak for the asking price. \n- Two person serving of green tea is $16. Wow.\n\nI do not ever mind spending my hard-earned money in Las Vegas. I like gambling it away, I like eating it away at nice restaurants, and I enjoy the shows, the comics, and the art work...but I could have rolled up two hundred dollar bills, dipped them in McDonald's ketchup and eaten them, and probably come out more satisfied than Yellowtail. \n\nFrom hostesses with wandering nipples, to a giddy over-selling waitress, to tiny bites (ha ha small plates...not so much), to dishes that fall flat...save your money and go somewhere else...there's a dozen more sushi joints in town that will impress you.  \n\nI give Yellowtail a double Emoji big brown thumb's down!"

It is also recommended to make reservations during the weekend just incase it gets a little busy.\n\nWHY: The dishes are worth the while (or at least the ones that I got the pleasure to try tonight! =D)\n\nWHAT: So... first thing's first. I actually got home not too long ago from eating here.  Right after my amazing experience in this great atmosphere, the only thing I could think of was \"I'm so going home and writing a review!\" So here I am, and here I go...\n\nOne of my good friends has been talking about how great everything was for the past year. So after a year, we finally got together to make it happen! Prior to getting to the restaurant, I was extremely giddy and excited!!\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, checked in, and got seated, we automatically were asked what we wanted to drink. Tangent! Before I forget, customer service was at its best! Anyways, back to my experience. We weren't as hungry, so we all decided to get an appetizer each and share. =) That's what friends are for.\n\nFOOD: Keep in mind, the portions are small, but so worth your taste buds!\n\nWe started off with Edamame.  There were 2 bowls, one with cold, salted edamame beans, and the other with a warm and cooked-in-some-good sauce (sweet chili) edamame beans. Always such a great starter!\n\nEggplant Skewers:  One thing, I am not an eggplant fan, but I am not afraid to try it. My friend recommended I try this, and thank goodness she made that recommendation! It did not taste like eggplant at all. It tasted like bbq on a stick brushed with sweet miso and sesame sauce goodness. KUDOS!\n\nBig Eye Tuna Pizza:  Definitely not like your ordinary pizza! One of greatest things I have ever eaten! To simplify such a magnificent dish, it was smoked tuna on some type of cracker/bread (which made it a pizza). Everyone must try this! KUDOS!\n\nPopping Spicy Crab: Why come to a sushi joint and not order at least one roll?! We made the right choice. If like uniqueness in taste, be sure to taste this roll! Who would have thought that pop rocks (candy) can enhance a simple sushi roll?! It was magical! KUDOS!\n\nLava Cake: For dessert (I always have my heart, mouth, and tummy ready for dessert), I was given the duty of choosing. I chose correct! To explain this lava cake, it was a small, dark chocolate-filled cake, topped with banana foam, and lychee ice cream on the side! Perfect amount, perfect taste, just pure perfection!\n\nTo sum it all up, I had a wonderful time with my friends, the staff, and most definitely the food. We also got to say hello and converse with Chef Akira Back! He is very down-to-earth and such a great chef!\n\nI leave you with this. KUDOS, KUDOS, KUDOS!"

I was quite disappointed with the entire experience -- the customer service was poor, consisting of a handful of confused or unwilling servers/hostesses running around trying to ring me up. I paid nearly $50 for an 8 piece roll and a seaweed salad. The quality of the roll was not worth the price -- the rice was hard/not fresh. I felt like I was eating grocery store sushi. The seaweed salad was good, but not extraordinary.  The three stars reflect my previous experience in 2013 together with this one. I will likely not return here for sushi as I've had better quality fish and service elsewhere in Vegas."

After taking the Tram from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur, Getting lost inside New York, New York for 15 Minutes and walking all the way back from there to our Hotel (Planet Hollywood). I decided to come here for a Late Night Bite, located deep inside the Bellagio lies Yellowtail: a Japanese Restaurant that serves killer Food, with waitresses dressed in Miniskirts (but mainly this is about the Food). \nWhen I made the reservation I asked if I could have a Table overlooking the Bellagio fountains outside, but they said they were all taken (that was only negative thing about my Experience here, Other than that everything else was Spot-On) they were at least kind to put me close to the window (Close Enough). \nThe reason why I wanted to come here was because of one Dish: Tempura Alaskan King Crab recommended by Beau MacMillan (1st Season Co-Host of the Food Network show: Worst Cooks in America and 1 of 15 Challengers to defeat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef America) on The Best Thing I Ever Ate episode (With Chopsticks). \n\nIt came out and it was like layered like a Cake and When I went to take a Bite it was Awesome (The rich juicy Crab meat, the Crunch of the Tempura, you get Heat from the Serrano Chilies, Mildness from the Red onions, Smokiness from the Micro Cilantro, Earthiness from the Beets, some Crispness from the Shredded Nori and you get sweetness from the Ponzu sauce that they pour over just when its about to be served).To take the world's biggest and most expensive Crustacean and turn it into this is just Mind Blowing. I had that along with a bowl of Spicy Miso Soup and a tall glass of Blueberry-Infused Bonzai Bunny Sparkling Sake (Refreshing).

The sea eal was not prepared properly, the salmon was old, cucumber salad was just tossed on a plate. All would be enough but to add insult to injury they have the smallest servings at stupid prices. If you love sushi don't come here. I never will again."

It's here that you get a fist class view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nYellowtail has an amazing selection of Sakes, and a great twist on Japanese cuisine. My favorite dish of the night had to be the Big Eye Tuna Pizza with micro shiso and truffle oil. Our table ordered two plates of it at the end of the night it was so good!! The sushi was good as well, but not incredibly outstanding. Overall I would recommend Yellowtail and DEFINITELY recommend a table outside."

If you go there, request a patio seat so you can watch the fountain show, it was a great view.\n\nThe server was amazing! He was very nice and professional, and yet he had so much personality! He made amazing recommendations and was attentive all night regardless of being very busy. Best waiter I've ever had.\n\nThe food was phenomenal! Everything tasted amazing, I've never had anything like it. I was astounded. I tried a lot of things and everything was perfect. We had the house sake and a few different years of the Macallan scotch, both amazing. My favorite drink was the desert sake called Banzai Bunny. It was a sweet sparkling sake, a perfect finish to the meal.\n\nThe music and atmosphere were perfect. I've never enjoyed the music in a restaurant so much, it was mostly very ambient and relaxing, yet slightly up beat remixes of popular songs played at the perfect volume. The tables were set wonderfully and the entire restaurant was beautiful.\n\nThe overall experience at this restaurant was wonderful, my boyfriend and I were both extremely impressed and will be back again! Thank you Yellowtail for the great experience!"

Well, the Popping Spicy Crab was great!  There is just something about the spicy flavors and the pop rock surprise as you eat it.... we ended up ordering more.  We had a few other things also, like the soft shell crab sushi roll which was good, but not special.   The Alaskan Snow Crab Tempura which was really good, the crab was tender and the tempura was crunchy, served in a bowl with a nice ponzu sauce, it was lovely.  We also tried the Big Eye Tuna Pizza, and it was good, I especially liked the truffle oil, it really worked.  The sommelier helped us pick out several different beers to go with the meal, we had fun with the Japanese beers she recommended.   All in all, a great meal."

Our order (tuna pizza, cod-not on menu, dynamite crab, soup, salad, tuna roll, chicken, etc?) was inspired and delicious. Don't overlook dessert - it's just a few bites and it arrives looking like art. \n\nAdditionally, I was served the best cocktail of my life - and now have a somewhat strong compulsion to buy Square One Organic Cucumber Vodka.\n  \nService was excellent, the room dark and lovely, yet open to the throngs passing through the casino if you are into people watching. Skip the patio if you are after a quiet meal. The view is great but those Bellagio fountains are thunderous at times."

            "review": "Disappointing. Decided to have a late dinner around 10pm. Dinner was a toss up between Fix and Yellowtail. Glanced at the menu and started walking away but got pulled back by my significant other with a 'Hey let's try it.' I should have kept on walking to Fix. Service was horrible from when we were seated to our departure. The staff seemed totally disorganized and were running around with a deer in the headlights look. We ordered our beverages and an appetizer immediately but failed to get either until we asked. Not even water was served until we asked. Really? Food was just OK. Nothing wowed me... maybe the foie gras with oyster and scallop dish. Other than that nothing spectacular. Left totally annoyed and unsatisfied. Had to run to Jean Philippe and order a delicious dessert crepe to erase the bad meal at Yellowfish. Next time, we'll just go to Nobu!"

I expected to pay a lot, but I didn't expect the food to be this good!\n\nThe decor was just in my taste, gold, warm colors, dimmed lights - just a romantic, pleasant atmosphere. Tables aren't too close together, so we had our privacy. LOVED IT!\n\nTHE FOOD IS EXQUISITE! I was extremely happy with EVERYTHING we ordered.\n\nBig Eye Tuna Pizza - simply delicate and delicious. The truffle oil was an amazing addition.\nBaked Crab and Rock Shrimp Hand Rolls - delicious and tender\nMadlon Sea Salt and Sweet Chili Edamame is a MUST - a very nice twist to edamame!\nSake was good as well!\n\nThe SERVICE WAS SUPERB! Our waiter was pleasant, cooperative, and attending without hesitation. He was very helpful with any unfamiliar items on the menu.  He truly deserved a big tip!\n\nThe bill was a bit pricier than what I usually pay for Japanese, however, it was worth it. Plus for the Bellagio, the prices were considerably cheap!\n\nAll in all, this is a must for a nice Vegas dining! You will not be disappointed. I'm definitely making another reservation soon!"

The big eye tuna pizza was a great start with the truffle  oil.  Even the duck procuitto was delicious. At first i was a bit hesistant but when i took that bite i was in heaven! I have posted up some pictures of the food we had.\n\nEven the executive chef Akira (who was also on Iron Chef) came out to greet us. He was very nice and funny. We had a great table on the patio that has the best view of the Fountain show of Bellagio. We were very lucky.\n\nDefinitely would recommend this restaurant!"
