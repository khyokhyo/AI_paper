            "review": "\"What do you feel like eating?\" is probably the most difficult decision my bf and I ask each other all the time. Sometimes it takes us forever to come up with a decision, other times it doesn't. But thanks to Yelp, we found this place and both agreed on it right away. \n\nRight away, our drinks arrived along with our chips and dip. Dip was beans, tomatillo sauce and a chipotle roasted salsa. All delish and packed with flavor. I don't usually like beans, but these were pretty good. The bf also put in an order of guacamole with crab. Their guacamole was also really good. It was thick and chunky with big pieces of crab on top. \n\nNow for our main dishes. Since I was getting full from chips and dip, I opted for a cup of chicken tortilla soup and a side salad. My cup of soup was a huge serving for it being in a cup. It was ok, nothing special. It was a little on the salty side so I wasn't able to eat it all. I also got a side salad, which was AWFUL!! When it arrived at the table, there was so much cheese on it. Then I noticed the reason why it was covered in so much cheese was because the lettuce was old and wilted. I asked our server to just take it off the bill and she was shocked that my salad looked the way it did. She was nice about it and took it off. The bf's carne asada burrito was the highlight of the meal. The meat was so tender. Although the burrito was on the smaller side, it was packed with so much meat, cheese and beans that we both got full from it. \n\nDefinitely a good spot for Tex-Mex food! Since I live so far away, I doubt I'll be eating here any time again soon. If I'm in the area, this will definitely be a one of my options though."

            "review": "This is the real deal, imagine authentic Mexican food at an affordable price in a clean and welcoming environment.  I first noticed this place in a food show where this restaurant competed against some top notch restaurants on the Strip and they won!\n\nA bit of warning, this is not Tex Mex, so the flavors are more on the milder side. If you need to, they offer various hot sauces.\n\nI ordered the soft tortilla soup and it was great with the subtle tomato flavor with a squeezed lime is a good balance to bean and starchy flavor.\n\nYou can also appreciate the care they put into their chicken enchiladas, it's baked perfectly without being overcooked, the shredded chicken is moist and seasoned perfectly.  It's a great deal for $11 and change.\n\nIf there is any drawback is the drive here from the Strip, it would take 30 - 35 minutes to get here.  But that won't detract from the great food."

Also, get some Mexican coffee. It is very, very good. We were staying on the strip and vegas and this is worth the 20 minute trip out."

My wife and daughter's  dinners were fine.  my problem is the service, we ordered an appetizer and received it with the dinner and I ordered a salad that never showed up.  4 different people were at our table at one time or another and nobody could get it right. Every person thought the other was getting what we ordered,  frustrating. The bill came promptly and he remarked that he took the salad off the bill, like he was going me a favor."

It was a Wednesday night so it was not busy by our food took a while.  Ordered a stake.  It was ok, but nothing great.  I would not order it again.  My husband got a carne asada burrito.   Much better than my stake.  My daughter got a soup, which was ok as well.\n\nOverall the place is good and the food is ok.  Give it a try!"

My wife had a combination plate which is not on the menu but they were happy to create for her. The margaritas were tasty and beer was cold. I can see why some would think service was slow but it worked out well for us since we were with friends and it was nice not to be bothered by the waiter. But we never had to ask for a refill and they did a great job cleaning the table around us without being annoying. We will definitely make this place a frequent stop!"

The place was busy for lunch on Saturday with no waiting time.  The chips and salsa/bean dip were good.... The husband got the Street Tacos (chicken and carnitas) which was excellent served along side beans and rice.  I got the Mexican style Hamburguesa (because we just had mexican the night before!) and this was like a torta, but so tasty!  Not like a regular hamburger and big enough to share!  They have a  great happy hour M-F which I can't wait to try when I'm not pregnant and can enjoy some margaritas!  :)  Can't wait to go back. Fun atmosphere and would love to sit outside next time."

The waitress forget about getting tortillas, doesn't even know her own menu and idk she's was just not paying attention at all, which I would understand if it was busy, but it wasn't that night and there was just another table and a couple of ppl @ the bar. The food that I have ordered was wayyy too salty and it just didn't taste good. My fianc\u00e9 ordered a burrito and he said it was alright. They never check on us till the end when we asked for the check and by then they send a manager? To see if we want them to remake the food. But seriously, i just wanna get out of there by then. There's no point of remaking the food when my fianc\u00e9 is done eating and well just end up staying there for probably another hour longer. Just waiting. \nCrappy service, meh food, and it's not even cheap. We will not be back.\nOh and they were on dirty dining and attempted to hide their grade smh."

            "review": "The service was terrible! We came in on Mother's Day. We arrived at 2:45 and was told it would be a 30 minute wait. No problem, they took my phone number so they could text when the table was ready. We were four with a high chair. I specifically mentioned we'd need a high chair. Around 30 minutes later I received the text our table was ready. This is when it all started to go wrong. The hostess was ready to seat us and then says 'oh you need a high chair'. Apparently the table we were supposed to get would not accomodate a high chair or it would have been in the way. So they would get us another table.  15 minutes later we're still waiting. I took my son to the bathroom and noticed a large party had just left and the staff was pulling apart the 3 tables they had used. I figured that one of those would be for us; the space looked perfect to fit the high chair. But no, they took two of the tables and put them together with some others to seat another large party that had arrived after us! After another 10 minutes they  finally seated us at a two top booth that they added a two top table to. It was squished and awkward. Sitting there for almost 10 minutes we still had not been greeted, had no chips and salsa and no drinks. Finally a busboy brought the chips etc and asked if we wanted something to drink. I tried to order a margarita but he said her could only bring water.    Our server finally showed up asking if we'd been helped yet. He said since no one had helped us he would. He also said it was shift change time, trying to explain, we assumed, about the wait time. However since it was now 4:15 and the place closes at 9 we figured that was bs. We gave him our food and drink order right away.  The drinks were brought out then another 15, 20, 25 minutes goes by with nada. My husband had to go to work soon and we had no idea the experience would be so time consuming. We were literally rising from our seats to leave when the food showed up. The food was good but not spectacular. Between the high prices and the piss poor service we were hoping for something better food wise. At one point my husband talked to the manager about the situation. She was flustered and nervous and simply did not know how to handle the complaint. Over all her attitude was 'oh well', (shrug). No offers to comp anything, not my kid's meal or even my margarita. No attempt whatsoever was made to assuage the situation. After we finished eating we sat and waited some more and then had to ask for our check. We chose to go there because of the good reviews and high stars. But after a closer review I've noticed many other reviewers have had similar complaints. Needless to say, we will not return, we will not recommend, and we will let others know not to bother with this restaurant."

There were nine of us. Despite the fact that they were very busy, we were able to be seated after only a short wait. The staff was terrific. They were friendly and attentive. Not only did our server make sure our needs were met but two other gentelmen came over to make sure everything was to our liking. I spilled my iced tea and someone was at my side as soon as it happened, helping to wipe up the mess. She was really nice about it and within 60 seconds, it was cleaned up and I had a fresh glass of tea. It was as if it had never happened. We were there on their karaoke night and that was a lot of fun. We've decided that we'll always try to go there on karaoke night. Most importantly, the food was delicious. The portions were just right and everything tasted perfect. I'm really excited that we finally tried this place. We're from out of state and there is a Mexican restaurant back home that I miss all the time. This place totally helps fill that void."

Yea, we timed it. So we sat there looking at our food. No one refilled our water so finally my husband went to the busser station and brought back a pitcher of water and filled our drinks. Our food was way too salty. Our friend ordered an appetizer that never came too. Like I said never again. For the price we got bad food and no service. This place is over rated."

After finally be able to put in the order (after 20 min wait) we waited another 20 mins (I know because I timed it) to get a cold to semi-warm plate, the carnitas was over cooked, tough (that's a HUGE accomplishment if you know how to make it) and bland. Had a nice piece of bone in there too. The beans had that nice dried crust layer on top like it had been sitting under the heat lamp a little too long but was too far to get the heat. \nThat salsa everyone loses their shit over, was okay. El Torrito and On the Boarder has that too, so does Rubio's technically. \n\nService: This was just stupid. And I'm kicking myself for not walking out. Went on a late Sunday afternoon after hiking Mt. Charleston (needless to say, hungry). The place is hardly busy. One girl comes over to take drink orders, says she can't take beer orders, but the the bartender can who will also be our waitress. I don't know why she couldn't have given our order to the bartender when she informed her of our table. 10 mins later, bartender comes (Natalie) \"You want something from the bar?\" Place DRINK order. I've been watching her from my table 15 ft away flirting with some douche face at the bar. Beer comes out in a glass so cold the beer is slushy. I'm not only a pretentious dick, I'm also a beer snob. I like to taste my beer, frozen glass = no taste. In spite of my annoyance, I asked nicely If I can have a glass that isn't iced. Natalie \"They all come like that.\"  Me, \"how about that (soda) glass that isn't frozen or run one under some cold water?\" 10 mins pass, flirts with douche, comes back, replaces beer in different frozen glass. Now takes FOOD order.\nFood comes out like it's been under a heat lamp and the beans have that nice crust on them. We pick at our food. Flag  Natalie down for our bill, and get the hell out of this pit.\n\nThis place sucks. The food sucks, the service sucks, the menu sucks. there isn't any thing redeeming about this place. Someone please correct me if I'm out of line here."

After we sat down though our waitress was nice she was really slow at attending to our table. Once our food finally came to our table it looked as though it had been sitting for awhile. You know when you put fresh beans on the plate they have a moistness to them.. These looked like dried old beans along with this on my fiance's plate he also received a taco where literally the shell wasn't cooked, it's as though they took it out of the package onto the plate no heating at all, the waitress didn't believe him so he had her physically touch the shell which was raw and she agreed and seemed taken back by it. The main course of his dish was cold on the inside which brought him to believe it was frozen then just reheated. As for my plate im vegetarian and found something suitable enough for me the volcanes, I asked the waitress to leave the cheese off to the side as I'm more vegan than vegetarian. After waiting for about an hour to get our food a different waitress finally brought our plates and there on my meal the cheese was on top. Since we'd been waiting so long I was like screw it I'll just eat it. Though I found out the guacamole and the pico have jalapenos in it which im allergic to unfortunately so I sent the plate back and since they aren't really a vegan friendly restaurant I settled for the Spanish rice which tasted like it came from a box. For all the hype this restaurant puts out it was extremely over priced for what you get and the service is horrible. I wouldnt recommend this place. The only reason I gave two stars was because the ambiance of the physical restaurant itself was nice."

Great meal both times!\nI have had the shrimp diablo, bacon wrapped shrimp tossed in a spicy tomato sauce. YUM! Bacon and shrimp...come on people. Magic. Homemade guac! Delish! Pozole - Hell yessss! The only thing I have had here that I have not loved was the shrimp ceviche. Kinda meh. Everything else! perfect!"

Atmosphere is amazing but everything in between fell through; menus with food still on it, slow service. It almost seemed as there was 1 server for the whole restaurant. I was craving the Mexican corn. Now I've had this before, not here, but I was familiar with the taste. The corn arrived and looked amazing however the corn tasted as if it was sitting in a pot of boiling water. It was soggy and very watery. \nThe entrees were okay. I didn't order it but had a bite of the grilled shrimp cheese taco which is a must! Unfortunately I'm one of the few that will say I probably won't be returning. Not my favorite for Mexican food."

The waitress asked what we wanted to drink since we didn't know she brought us water. Upon her return with the waters we told her we wanted a cafe de la olla and a caf\u00e9 con leche. I was in the middle of asking her what the different bowl sizes were when she interrupted me to tell me she would be right back because she wanted to put in our coffee order because it would take about 10 min to make. She left and it took her a while to come back. She came back because I flagged her down because I wanted to give her our food order. My sister and I ordered enchiladas and a small menudo. We waited a while and she finally brought our food out. She asked how everything looked and I said it was ok but we still needed our coffee. She left to check on them and after a few minutes she came back and told us that she had forgotten to put our order in and that they would take a while more to come out. Our coffee finally came out by the time we were almost done eating the menudo tasted old by the way. We sat at our booth finished our coffee and the waitress never came back. Finally after a long wait I flagged her down and asked for our check. That took a long time to get when she finally brought it to me I handed her my credit card without looking at the check. This woman walked all over the place with my check and card and I had to wait a very long time just to pay. I finally got up and walked over to her and told her I needed to leave and that she needed to run my card and give me by receipt and card back. I have been here before and I have never seen a waitress that is this disorganized she is too busy yapping and sticking her nose in other customers conversations. She did not charge us for our coffee but I would have rather she put in the order when she said she would that way we could have had our drinks with our meals. The restaurant was not busy when we got there and our order was easy. I just don't know why this waitress can focus."

It's located on a cool little street that I didn't know existed. It has a nice atmosphere and I bet it would be a neat place to take a stroll at night. \n\nThe service was just average, even a bit slow at times. Nice enough but it took longer than expected for condiments and few other items to show up at our table after the food arrived. I had the empanada lunch special with grilled shrimp. At $9 it was a reasonable portion, served with rice and beans. It was crazy heavy on the onions. I like onion for sure, but I couldn't taste anything else. The onion overwhelmed all the other flavors in the dish. Rice and beans were pretty standard, nothing to brag about. \n\nI also tried the shrimp a la diabla. It was much better than my own meal. Nice and spicy with a good amount of tiger prawns. I didn't try a margarita, perhaps it's the star of the show? With all the good reviews and the cool atmosphere I'll come back next time I'm in the area. I'd like to try the happy hour or dinner and have a few other menu items. This spot seems to have lots of potential. I just won't do the empanada on my next go."

We just moved to the area and don't know our neighbors well enough to ask for any suggestions.  It has been hit or miss when it comes to the ratings on Yelp for more than one place since moving to LV.  I will say our visit to Leticia's was a HIT!\n\nWe took our two kids with us and had a little bit of a wait to be seated but it was no more than 10 minutes.  We sat in a booth right next to the kitchen so we could smell the food.  We were brought chips, beans and 2 salsas and asked for our drink orders.  My kids ordered sodas while my husband had a Blue Moon and I had a blended strawberry margarita.  We dug into the chips, beans and salsa.  I enjoyed the tomatillo salsa while my husband liked the red salsa and we both loved the beans.  The children ordered off the kids menu; my son had a bean and cheese burrito that came with beans and rice while my daughter ordered a hard ground beef taco which also came with beans and rice but she only wanted the rice.  My husband ordered the street taco platter which offered 3 street tacos with choice of carne asada, al pastor, carnitas or chicken.  He had 2 carnitas and 1 carne asada served with rice and beans.  I ordered the Ensenada taco platter which offered two tacos of your choice of fish or shrimp which I had one of each.\n\nThe food arrived fresh, hot and quick.  My husband devoured his taco platter leaving nothing behind.  I would say he enjoyed it!  My son ate all of his burrito and brought his beans and rice home.  My daughter only ate her rice and have of her taco because she was so full.  I only ate the fish taco and a small portion of my rice and beans.  We packed up our leftovers in their to go boxes, which are great and will reuse them!  All in all, our total bill was just under $60 for the 4 of us without the tip.\n\nPros:\n1. Nice variety of offerings on the menu\n2.  Chips, salsa and beans.\n3. Portion size.\n\nCons:\n1. When my daughter asked for no beans, I asked if they could give her double rice instead.  The kitchen didn't do that.  It wasn't worth sending back for more.\n2. Parking- it's a little strange.  There is a parking lot behind/next to the restaurant but it seems odd.\n3. The cons aren't deal breakers so we'll be back!"

If you're not interested in long waits for no reason, there are lots of other options close by; for example try the place next to Red Robin or if Italian would fit, go across the street to Streets of New York."

That would have been fine if the food was gourmet-level, authentic Mexican food but it tasted like Roberto's. If I wanted to eat subpar, greasy food I would have just gone there and paid their prices. One of our orders was supposed to sub a side salad for beans but the order included the beans with no salad in sight. The boxes had no markings to distinguish the spicy tacos from the mild. A few bites in, my cousin bit into a hair baked into her food so everybody was grossed out and that dish had to be thrown out. \n\nWe also notified one of the staff that the prices aren't accurate on their online menu and he said that they already had 3 complaints about that earlier that day. Seems like they should either honor those prices or change their online menu so diners aren't in for a nasty surprise. The food was cold when we picked it up and they were very stingy with the condiments. When we asked for salsa, we were given a miniature to-go sauce container and told that if we wanted more it would be an additional $5. Don't order take-out from here unless you want to be nickel and dimed for every little thing.\n\nThe restaurant itself looks cute and has a nice atmosphere but the experience of ordering take-out was so frustrating and unpleasant that I will not be returning to dine in. I don't know if they had an off night or whether this is a common occurrence but that entire experience was completely unacceptable."

Happy hour is amazing. The queso fundido is my favorite appetizer. The capirotada is a favorite am dessert but only made seasonally! The shrimp quesa tacos are the most amazing and a family favorite of ours. Don't forget the sangria and / or margaritas!"

            "review": "My fianc\u00e9 is grotesquely addicted to Mexican cuisine. Wether it is authentic or TexMex, he craves it. If he could have a burrito everyday, he'd do so. I, on the other hand, find Mexican food on the same level as a Wendy's hamburger. Which is why I was delightfully surprised when we stumbled in here and found some great food, along with the warmest and most inviting decor I've encountered in North Las Vegas. Walking in was truly an eye-pleaser. We were immediately directed to a comfy booth, and then confronted with the traditional basket of complimentary chips and salsa. Two salsas, and a bean dip, all of which were tasty. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 ordered the tamale plate, which was delicious, and I had the bouillabaisse, which was divine. The tamales were smothered to perfection. The meat inside could melt in your mouth. The sides complimented the overall flavor, and the plate was fairly large, though not enough that the price was justifiable. The bouillabaisse was delicious. The broth was warm, not overly tomatoe-y (if that's even a word) and the amount and quality were about right for the price point. ($25.00.)\n\nLaura and Oscar waited and bussed on us Sunday evening around 7:00pm. Both were incredibly nice, considerate, and honest. The service here would have been perfect had our food not taken over half and hour to get to us. Laura had to check on the kitchen a couple times before anything came to our table. I was feeling very sick that day, so my irritability came as swift as the drink refills did. I cannot at all blame either server, though. They took care of us and did everything in their power to make us happy. Great personalities.\n\nAfter forty minutes the food arrived. I then ordered the flan with chocolate cake, however they were out of the cake portion. So I settled for the flan alone, instead. I like most flan in general, I'm not picky. I think it's all pretty smooth and wonderful. So when I took a bite of this dense little mound of rubber and water, I was so horribly disappointed. I thought maybe it might be due to me being sick (messing with my tastes and textures), but nonetheless it was just...not great. Presentation was bland. Flavors were off. Texture was just awful. The little gross place on the college campus provides better flan in their little plastic boxes (I'm 100% not over exaggerating). \n\nOverall, I was a tad bit agitated. More like disappointed. The food was so good, excluding dessert. And the service was great on the waiting staff, horrid on the kitchen. If you don't mind a wait, and want a hearty, romantic, authentic meal, then Leticia's is definitely the place for you.\n\nUPDATE: The business owner was kind enough to explain their situation in the kitchen that day, and reached out to me asking to drop in again. That was insanely considerate and very sweet. I bumped my review up a star and definitely intend to stop back in for a bite. Nothing is more awesome than someone who is passionate about their business and food."

I haven't seen him in forever and he said he wanted some mexican food. I chose Leticia's because my sorority sisters suggested (and they are mexican) this place! They said it was a nice sit down restaurant with some really good food. So, of course we had to check it out!\n\nIt's located in a beautiful area (super far from my house) in north town. I was surprised! The outside atmosphere looked like a really nice place to sit outside. It was really hot weather at the time so we went inside and got greeted right away from two beautiful ladies! We were seated immediately at a booth. It's really authentic looking decor. Lots of awesome designs and fun things to look at all around the room. Our booth was kinda small for the three of us, but we managed. The two waiters we had were super nice! They spoke in spanish (and my friend spoke spanish as well since he worked in Chile the past two years) so it was pretty awesome to watch! I love mexican food! They started us off with a bowl of chips with two different salsas and beans. They even refilled it if we ever wanted some more! Now time for the hard part. Choosing what to eat. The menu is filled with so many options!\n\nI decided to go with the lunch specials. There were a bunch you could choose from, and I got the burrito lunch special enchilada style with verde sauce on top. It came with lettuce, tomato, beans, and mexican rice. Boy was it super yummy! The burrito was smothered in sauce and cheese. I had to use cholula sauce to add a bit of flavor. The atmosphere inside was really fun. The waiters constantly checked up on us. They even had me try the spiciest sauce there, and MAN was I burning up!!! You should definitely try it if you want a KICK!\n\nThey were kind enough to offer dessert which looked delicious, but we turned it down because we were so stuffed from our entree. If you are in this area and want some awesome mexican food other than a chain fast food stop, definitely try this place out! Definitely glad that we did."

I had to wait literally 30 minutes for my food.  My server was nice and apologized several times for the delay.  When my steak tacos came, they were dry. Luckily, my server Joanne, checked back with me fairly quickly and offered to change my order for something else.  Luckily the replacement order came very quickly. Joanne chatted with me briefly when I finished my meal. I would have liked to see a discount (or even a dessert on the house) placed on my final bill for my inconvenience.  A while back, I went to Red Robin and my burger was overcooked.  Not only did the manager come over and offer me a soup while I waited for a replacement, she took the burger charge off the bill without me asking. This is the service that I come to expect.  I'm not sure if I will return to Leticia's again. I've been to Michocan Gourmet Mexican restaurant twice and both times, I've gone the food and service was excellent."

Overall, I think their food is excellent.  They have some of the most tender, flavorful Carnitas I have ever eaten.  I've also had their Carne Asada burrito and the Milanesa; both where the steak was also tender and flavorful, and not tough and chewy.  I've had better chips & salsa at other places, but I can't complain when it's free (part of the meal).  Of the numerous visits, I've only had one visit with slow service, and our food took 30 minutes to come out from the time we ordered.  All other visits, the service was great and the food came out fast.  Prices are decent for lunch specials, but I haven't eaten dinner there yet.\nI haven't been disappointed with the food there yet, and I would recommend this place to anyone.

The rellenos we have at our employee dining room tastes better than theirs.  And Leticia's is not cheap.  \n\nTheir award-winning tacos were delicious however, and that's what warranted them that extra star.  Their fried ice cream was also very good.  Their tres leches cake was not as moist as it should be -- weird.  That's what tres leches cake is about.  Moist and milky.  It tasted like boxed cake with milk and slivered almonds poured over it.

Anyway, the first thing that caught my eye when we pulled up was people were already lined up waiting for tables outside (presumably). Must me common place for a Friday evening about 7pm. Once we parked and got in, I think we waited maybe 30 minutes. During the wait, we took the opportunity to look at the pictures on Yelp, so we had a pretty good idea of what we wanted. I recommend you doing so as well because the menu has a lot to choose from and it all looks good. Once we were seated, Luciano greeted us and took our orders. We shared the guacamole with crab and shrimp (minus the spicy, but still a bit spicy) and the quesatacos!! Both we delicious. Authentic flavors and everything. By the way, the chips and salsa were great too.  We actually over indulged in the chips and salsa, so we barely touched the guacamole. Don't get too full on the chips and salsa, you'll miss out on the food!! Overall, great place. I'd recommend it and definitely done here again!"

The wait time for 2 was only about 10 minutes and we were seated in the bar area which was a bit more cramped and loud. My drink of Cabo Azul was great! The tortilla chips and 3 sides of salsa were great. The food we ordered was just ok. Nothing great or super fantastic. I ordered shrimp ceviche and the mexican corn. The bf ordered carne asada enchilada. When the food came out is was almost like we read each others minds. Not very thrilling. I guess we were expecting a big old wow factor of taste. One thing that threw me off was the girl who first took our drink orders. She was under 18 so she couldn't bring me an alcoholic beverage which is what I wanted so there was some mix up with who I was supposed to order the drink from and how it was going to get to my table. My mexican corn was like something that I could make at home. The bf's enchilada and sides were a bit dry and overcooked. I think we will skip Leticia's and stick to the regular places that give us a bit more yay when it comes to the food."

My favorite is the molcajete fajitas with flat-iron steak and chicken. The sweet cactus that supplements this fun dish is a great substitute for the normal bell peppers in fajita dishes and the presentation makes for a great conversation piece. As far as the normal Mexican food selection goes, the carnitas is what I get when I am in the mood for the more traditional meal. Always great, but getting through the door can be a challenge. 40-70 minute waits are not uncommon. Hence the ding to 3 stars."

The first time was fabulous and inline with the overall score this place gets on Yelp. Our waiter was very helpful in navigating their somewhat complicated menu and process. It all turned out well.\nThe second time we went was a tragedy. We arrived with friends for a double-date night, signed in and waited outside with lots of other people waiting as well. After a half hour and noticing other, new tables getting seated before us, I enquired of the hostess what the deal was and found out that we'd been totally skipped on the list about ten patrons ago. After expressing my displeasure, we still waiting about five minutes, then on the way to the table, my friend fell due to water on the floor. Apologies? Manager rush over to gush on us? Nope...just a, \"Sit here\" in a booth a little too small for four grown adults. The food was still good though.\nThird time, tie breaker, we arrived on a Sunday after church and sat outside and it wasn't very busy. This time the service was prompt and the food delicious. The beautiful weather on the small deck didn't hurt either.\nSo, that's why I'll let the \"tie go to the runner\" and give a four. We'll see what the next visit delivers. My advice? Go when it's not super busy to ensure a good trip."

My first time here I gorged myself so heavily on the preamble that I had to take my main course to go without tasting it!\n\nThe food comes out in the traditional large portions you'd expect and this leads to an occasional problem of saltiness or slightly dry meat,  but i have never once left anything other than satisfied. \n\nP.s the spicy crab guacamole is a spicy food lovers dream."

I ordered two shrimp tacos. They had a creamy chipotle sauce on them that made it delish!! My father ordered the queso tacos & said they were absolutely great! For appetizers, we tried the shrimp ceviche and elote de creme. The corn was absolutely amazing. A critique for the ceviche would be maybe a little more spice or lime.. it just seemed like it was missing something. The price is a little higher than most places around this area.

Several min later, our \"waitress\" re-appeared on \"regretfully\" said the kitchen was out of the entree dish we both ordered.  Shouldn't the kitchen communicated this to the wait staff PRIOR to the opening or at least when we FIRST placed the order... not 25 min later???

From their menu:\n\nQuesaTacos wrapped in a blend of melted Oaxaca cheese, stuffed with our grilled shrimp cooked in Leticia's Abuelo sauce \"Mild, Medium or Spicy\" your choice of tortillas and topped with our chipotle cream sauce, served with our Poblano white Rice Casserole with crema, cheese and rajas, Additional filling choices of gilled Chicken, shredded Beef, Carne Asada, Carnitas, Birria, Chicken Tinga or any Saut\u00e9ed Vegetables.\n\nI had two original shrimp tacos.  My son had regular tacos: two Al pastor and two Birria (goat).  I gave him one of mine and took one of his birria.  FMR, they were delicious.  The Quesa Taco was superior, and the birria was tender and sweet.\n\nWhen we sat down, we were brought chips and three bowls of dips: one fire-roasted salsa, one bean dip, and one an avocado-tomatillo sauce.  Excellent.  Even the beans and rice which accompanied my taco plate were spiced and cheesed.

The chips and salsa were AMAZING.\n\nThe atmo is sort of casual upper-middle-class-suburban Tex-Mex, and they have a patio for outdoor dining, where you can bask in the breeze created by all the SUVs blasting down one of those ginormously expansive asphalt rivers that pass for roads up there.\n\nOverall, it was excellent food at a great price, but I probably would not drive all the way up here to eat here. If they opened a location closer to midtown, then maybe."

Finally the other evening I have really had enough bad food. I have sent back a simple burrito because the meat smelled funny.    \n\"Only to be told that it is the broth they cook it in\" My food has been cold over and over again. The most recent experience is I was given a incorrect meal after waiting a very long time for it to arrive.  During our wait our water glasses were not filled and we were not given any extra chips. I asked to speak to manager who basically told me that there  would be no charge for my meal but my son's meal was still being charged \"$20.00 for a build your own burrito\". So I waited for him to eat. It was a horrible experience once again. Anyone considering going to Leticia's please look for another place to go. I am not a one time customer who had a bad experience. I am a returning customer who has always had a bad experience."

So amazing, and a mo ths worth of cheating in one meal. Just have to mention a couple of things that have disappointed me in my last few visits. At least the 3 most recent times that I have decided to go to Leticias have been based on the awesome weather, and wanting to sit outside on their patio. Every time, Ive been told that they have no server for the outside. Its not like I went there once a week for 3 weeks. How can this be? The patio is amazing, and so cute, and when the weather is good, to sit outside and chat and eat does not compare to sitting inside with a/c and a loud restaurant- so that was a bummer. Multiple times. The other thing is that I got my world rocked by the vegan tamales on a previous visit, and tried to order them on the next few visits, and was told that they were out of them. If it werent for those things- it'd be a 5 star. Please Leticias- get some people to man the patio. The weather is amazeballs right now, and Im getting the itch! Dont let me down!!"

We've been to Leticia's more times than I can count in the year that I've lived here.  We've brought every one of our house guests to Leticia's - and that's a whole bunch because when you live in Vegas people come out of the woodwork to visit.  Everyone we've introduced to Leticia's has fallen in love, just like we did.\n\nSome of our favorites include: Poblano White Rice Casserole (I order it on the side no matter what else I'm ordering), El Molcajete, Quesa Tacos, Sopa de Consomme (which I get to go every time I'm sick) and their bean dip.  The chips are dangerously addicting.  We've never had anything that was bad.  Also, the service is great.  The first time we went our waiter, Mario, was so fantastic that we request to sit in his section every time we visit Leticia's.  He know's the menu inside and out always gives the best suggestions!  \n\nAlso, I have to say, I am allergic to MSG and normally stay away from ordering anything with sauce and almost never order soup in restaurants.  If I eat anything with MSG in it I get a horrific migraine the next day.  I have never had a negative reaction to their food.  Before I ordered the soup I asked if they made it in house.  The chef got on the phone and said it was made in house and from scratch.  I wish there were more restaurants like this one!"

The food is absolutely spot on every time flawless and as authentic as you can get.  Nothing on the strip or anywhere else in Vegas comes close.  I travel to San Diego for business and I visit a section of the city called old town. It's filled with Mexican restaurants and cafes and none of them come close to this.  How sad to be so close to the Mexican boarder yet we have better Mexican food in Las Vegas.  Try this place once and you'll be addicted just as I have been since the day they opened."

We took my niece there for dinner.  We got there a bit early so seating was no problem but when we left there seemed to be a wait.  \n\nStarted off with their chips, bean dip and salsas.  LOVED the salsa verde.  My niece raved and she is 8!!  The beans and other salsa were just fine.  My niece ordered off the kids menu and had the chicken burrito (came with beans rice, a beverage and dessert).  She really liked the burrito.  \n\nMy husband ordered the Latecia's Quesa Tacos which had a blend of melted Oaxaca cheese stuffed with shrimp cooked in Leticia's Abuelo sauce \"and topped with a chipotle cream sauce.  It came with a  small individual cheesy rice casserole  topped with crema and chile and a side of beans (he picked refried).  I stole that tasty little rice casserole right from under his nose!  I would come back for that and their grilled mexican corn on the cob!  That corn was super tasty!\n\nI had their Taquitos dinner which gives you a good variety to choose from.  I chose the beef picadillo, chicken, and the most delectable  Potato and Cheese wrapped in  corn tortillas and fried crispy. All were topped with guacamole,  Oaxaca cheese, cotija cheese, crema and pico de gallo.  I had a side of black beans and cilantro rice.  \n\nService was good and the decor was really nice.

Instead, I'll concentrate on the items I have eaten in the recent past: the Molcajete de Mariscos & Pastel de Tres Leches.\n\nMolcajete de Mariscos, served spicy -  Lobster, clams, shrimp, mussels, & fish in a special sauce, white arroz poblano (rice, peppers, & cheese casserole ).  Served in a hot Molcajete (three-legged round bowl, which has been carved out of basalt).  The seafood was all perfectly cooked, the broth was spicy but not too hot.  The broth was flavored of roasted peppers, tomatoes, & seafood broth (not fishy).  The arroz served as a balance to the bold flavors of the broth but very tasty in its own right.  Something that impressed me was the white fish being flaky, the shellfish being tender, not rubbery, and the lobster meat being easy to pull out of tail, but not overcooked.  I highly recommend this dish\n\nPastel de Tres Leches - A very moist desert cake topped with citrus & whipped cream.  I am not a great lover of cake, but this is sublime.  Moist & flavorful, Leticia also infuses some type of cordial or liquor in the cake.  The flavor is creamy with a mild citrus flavor.  If you're a choc-o-holic, maybe you should look elsewhere, but, I consider this a great desert.\n\nStandard Margarita - Buy them by the pitcher, on the rocks.  They put the ice in your glass and the pitcher remains un-diluted.  Every drink is good with their perfect proportions and better than average tequila.  The Cadillac Margarita is expensive, but excellent.\n\nThe only problem I ever have at Leticia's has been service.  Since I am a regular, that typically isn't a problem, so I may not be the best to assess their service.  Regardless, the staff is always warm & friendly with many regulars, and very friendly regulars at the bar.  \n\nOf special note: During warmer months on Mondays, street tacos are available in front, on the corner of Norman Rockwell & Farm Road.  Reduced price and, in my opinion, even better flavor.  On Saturday nights, after 8, there is karaoke in the bar area. Gustavo (restaurant partner) typically sings and gently cajoles the regulars into giving it a go. Very fun.\n \nThe restaurant itself is very clean and is in the location that was previously Joey's Seafood Only.  Parking is generous with street parking on Norman Rockwell and a well lit parking lot behind the restaurant.\n\nThat's all for now!"

The times I've been here, there's more gringos and gringas than Mexicans.\n\nI do love their chips, tomatillo, chipotle and bean dips for sure. I can eat 2 baskets of their chips. 5/5\n\nI've tried their signature dish: Quesa Taco. Loaded with cheese, very flavorful and very salty. I asked for no tomatoes since I'm allergic, they gave me tomatoes anyway. I scraped the tomatoes off but I guess not all since my lips were puffier than their puffy tacos. 3/5\n\nPuffy Tacos:\nFried flour tacos. Greasy. Rice was salty. 3/5\n\nI love horchata. They don't have free re-fills though.\n\nThe wait can be ridiculous even with a reservation. There are parts of the room that is dark and warm (to the left of the hostess' booth) and bright and freezing (to the right). Bring a scarf/jacket just in case."

While waiting, we tried to get a drink at the bar, but it was tough getting a menu and a space at the bar.  Once we were seated, though, the whole experience changed.  The service was awesome- prompt, efficient, knowledgeable, not over the top.  The food was great, too.  The guacamole w/ jalapenos was fresh and fantastic.  The small was plenty for 2.  My wife had the \"something\" casa chili verde.  The pork was tender, the beans were good.  I had the \"something\" Quesa- their house special.  I had one shrimp taco and one shredded chicken.  It was awesome.  I would get the shredded chicken again and try a different filling instead of the baby shrimp.  Oh, and we each had a margarita that was top shelf ingredients and quite good.  Maybe I'm still a country bumkin' adjusting to big city life, but I thought this place was great.  5 stars for food and service.  3 stars for generic ambience."

Unlike other places that have gotten that notoriety and now require reservations 6 months in advance, Leticia's keeps it a hunnit. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I love the quesa tacos which is their signature dish. I've always had great service. It takes some time to get your food, but it's worth it. If it were an option they might get a 1/2 star deduction for that. It's a small place so it might be busier on Friday or Saturday nights. I tend to go when I can make the trek across town which is usually a Sunday afternoon. Just something to keep in mind."

I ordered one of my favorites, tostatas but when served, it tasted stale and the appearance looked as if the food was old. My mother and uncle ordered the same thing and it was soggy, bot cooked well and cool, not hot. My husband's order was also cold and he said it tasted old as well. My aunt's order was also cold but also had a bit of rubber feel. When we talked to the waitress, she told us it was because they had a new cook. She did not offer to fix or replace any of our meals. Weeks later, I was watching the news and they were on dirty dining with a C rating based on a lot of thr complaints I listed. I won't go back there and I hope the owners fix this issue."

This was our third visit to Leticia's and I have to say, I'm a fan!\n\nThey've been fairly busy each time we visited but they get you seated quickly. One reason behind my 4 stars is their waiting area. It's extremely small and with the cold weather right now, no one wants to be outside. Last night was a busy night and you could barely get in the door to put your name down. They also don't take reservations so with large groups waiting for a table, it was hard to even find a place to stand out of the way from employees and guests coming/going.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I haven't had a bad experience here. As soon as you sit down you're greeted with warm chips and 3 dips, one of which is a bean dip which my wife absolutely loves. They also serve a guacamole style dip and a spicier red salsa. Each one is good, the salsa has a good spice to it and they each have a great fresh homemade taste.  \n\nBeing a cheese fanatic, on our first visit, I had the QuesaTacos and they are spectacular. Last night I had the tamales and even those surprised me since most \"restaurant tamales\" just aren't that good. I love that they will let you choose two styles in several dishes like the tacos and tamales I've had. I decided on 1 green sauce chicken and 1 red sauce beef tamale. My wife went with shredded chicken enchiladas. The food came out extremely fast and was even brought to us by the Executive Chef of the restaurant. They plate the dishes with generous portions of rice and beans . My tamales were delicious, the masa was moist and fluffy, both meats were juicy and even by themselves had great flavor. The only thing I did not like about the tamales were the onions. I'm usually a fan of onions but they basically threw on some slices of raw onion that just didn't quite work with the tamales. All in all, a great meal and my wife loved the enchiladas as well!\n\nWith the $15 for $25 deal, our bill came out to $5.49 (without tip) which included two dinners, one soda and one beer. Beer being another reason for my 4 star review. As another Yelper noted, they serve their beer in frosted mugs which for us beer guys is a little disappointing. Other than that though, Leticia's serves great food at decent prices and we'll definitely be coming back!"

The style of salsa is not the kind we like.  the beans they served with chips lacked any flavor.  The Fideo soup we both ordered was thick and glupy. The salad I ordered was loaded down with about a cup of too much cheese.  The shrimp poppers were overly breaded.  Hubby did like the Consume soup.  The staff was friendly, but service was slow and they never checked on us to refill drinks.  I do like the decor, but the fluorescent lighting is bad.  The place is always packed so we thought why not give it a try again & it's so close to home.  However we won't be returning.  Sorry Leticias, Michoacan is just much much better."

We tried their fajitas for 2, which were tasty, but mostly veggies and less meat than the competition.  Guacamole was good, but they don't offer table side preparation.  Their Mexican corn was a fantastic little surprise that I never see on most other menus.  Whatever you do, DO NOT order a bloody mary here.  This was without a doubt the worst bloody mary I've ever ordered.  They politely agreed to swap me out for a beer when I explained the predicament.  I wouldn't be surprised if they get similar requests frequently.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, the decor kinda looks like it used to be a Chili's or something like that.  We visited on a Sunday evening, and the place was hopping and fairly noisy.  \n\nOverall, this is a 3.5 star review.  There were some high points such as the salsas and menu variety, but the bloody mary, meat quantity in the fajitas, and no homemade tortillas left more to be desired."

Every time I drive by I see hoards of people waiting outside so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. My friend and I got there at about 5pm on Friday. It wasn't too busy yet although there was a bit of a wait and the small lobby area was full. After waiting about 15 minutes we were seated in the dining area. It's super crowded- tables are very close to each other in an almost claustrophobic way. We were served chips and salsa first. I notice other reviewers raving about the chips, and I almost wonder if we were served something different than everyone else? The chips we got tasted like any tortilla chips you could buy at the grocery store and were not warm as some stated. The salsa didn't stand out as anything different than what you'd get from Chipotle or Zabas. I ordered the \"build your own burrito\" and my friend ordered the shrimp tacos. My burrito was made as ordered with red sauce \"enchilada style\" and carne asada inside. I agree with other reviews that the food was quite salty and to me the carne asada was really fatty. The serving sizes were large which was good considering that I found the prices to be a little on the high side for the type of restaurant this is. My friend said that her shrimp tacos were tasty but nothing to write home about. Frankly, I actually prefer Zaba's burrito over the one I had at Leticia's for less than half the price. The service was quick and friendly. There was nothing inherently bad about our visit, but I do think that this place is way overrated. Would not be first on my list when I'm looking for Mexican food."

I love their food, but they are so far away from the Green Valley Area. They as well have a bar. Why do they close at 9? I suggest they close somewhere around midnight."

The service on the other hand, was horrible. Having worked. The service industry( ok Dairy Queen ) I appreciate good service . I am diabetic.. The waitress came within 10 minutes which was fine.. and I was sitting outside. But I felt like I was ignored. But as soon as I went in another 15 minutes later I was promptly served my drink and chips and salsa. I would recommend hiring busboys.. or maybe you have them. Anyway, service is big to me , so  disappointing, \nI won't be back ."

We sat down, and started with the salsa, beans, and chips which I am in love with! I proceeded to eat some of the chipotle salsa and there was a hair about 10 inches long, that I had to pull out of my mouth. I asked my server whose name was Duke, about it, and he told me it was a chile strand and it happens all the time. he refused to to acknowledge what had happened, and did not apologize. We then tried to order off of the happy hour menu, and he told me because it was New Years Eve they were not honoring the happy hour menu, when we called two hours earlier and the hostess and told us they were having it. So we proceeded to leave, it was the worst customer service I have ever received. I did have a couple other experiences at Leticia's, that were quite enjoyable. Although, I will not eat here again, the hair experience was a total turn off."

The entire time the manager (I think) was gabbing with the waitstaff about nothing important, right next to our table.  We were pretty much ignored throughout the meal.  The waitress brought out two scalding hot cups of soup, literally seconds before our entrees arrived.  On top of that, she placed the soups directly in front of our 4 and 5 year old eaters.  Common sense isn't always so common.  \n\nI mentioned the poor service to the manager, who just said, \"Sorry,\" and carried on chatting with his waitresses.  \n\nThe food was bland at best.

I had an amazing watermelon Agua Fresca and carne asada. Portions were HUGE and presentation was perfect. Sometimes Mexican restaurants can just slop their portions together, but this is not the case here. \n\nIt may not be Abuela's food to a \"T\" but it's pretty darn good! We put a lot of weight in customer service and this place does not disappoint!"

Me and the beau wanted to celebrate so I suggested to come to Leticia's.\n\nLocated right off the freeway in the Centennial area, it reminded me of Tavoli Village actually. It was a very cute location and secluded. Upon walking in at 6pm it was pretty busy. We waited only about 20 minutes though. When you check in you receive a free house margareita so I took advantage of that. The beau got a guava jalapeno margareita. Oh that was delish!\n\nOf course a red and green salsa and bean dip w/ chips came out. I always appreciate that because sometimes you just have the munchies as you wait for your food.\n\nSo I ordered ceviche with crab. oh my goodness, that was one of the best ceviches I ever had. The crab just made it extea amazing. It wasn't too sour because I hate when it is. It was the perfect amount. I had to order fresh guac of ocurse. Their guac is topped with a slice of queso which is apreciated also. You can also add crab on the guac, we didn't, but that sounds like a good idea! i love crab.\n\nI got pork/beef pozole. I honeslty have had authentic home made pozole so in my mind I always compare it so Leticia's pozole didn't really cut it for me but the beau really liked it. It didn't have all the spices that I craved in it I dont know what was missing. \n\nWe also ordered carne, chicken, shrimp Molcajete. That was a lot of food. It was sooooo good! that is something I reccomend if you are dining with friends because that could be easily shared. \n\nThe waiter, I forgot his name, was amazing. He really helped us in information about the menu and ordering the right foods. He was awesome! everything came out in a reasonable time. We did order a lot of food for 2 so it was appreciated it did not come out all at once because we wouldn't have room on the table and that was all due to our waiter. \n\nI ordered a CocoFlan to go because I was so full but I needed dessert for later. That was amazing. The chocolate cake was very moist and the flan wasn't too sweet. It was perfect.\n\nOverall, it was a good dine in experience and I can not wait to return."

You know when you go somewhere and the food doesn't live up to the hype? This was NOT that kind of place. The food was SO good. I have been let down by many Mexican restaurants, but the flavors here were the bomb. I got the Molcajete which is served in a giant, sizzling bowl with your choice of meat(s), ranchera sauce, grilled cactus, and a side of tortillas, rice, beans, etc. Basically, it's like fajitas. The ranchera was a little spicier than I was expecting, but still delicious. Our server was Mario. He was personable and kept our drinks filled. My only disappointment was that they were out of Mole sauce, which is my favorite and what I originally wanted, but that forced me to branch out and try something new. I will definitely be back!"

My step grandma cooked food similar when she was alive and this was the closest to that and my moms Mexican cooking. \n\nBut somehow it's lost its way for me. Look at my previous reviews over the years to look at the trend.\n\nIt's become inconsistent. It's better during daytime, probably because the owner is there. There are times also for dinner the food is SO salty, SO greasy. Servers are either wonderfully attentive and super friendly or horrible and will never check on you at all. Horchata is sometimes perfectly creamy and spiced and sometimes so cinnamony. It's like being at 2 different restaurants. \n\nThinking back, out of the last 6 visits, once both the food and service wasn't good, 2 visits the food was good and service wasnt, 2visits where the food was bad and the service was good, 1 visit where food was amazing and service was too. Most of the good food was earlier in the day. These 6 visits have been the past year, I've gone less and less when we used to come frequently.\n\nThey also raised their prices from opening to now, by quite a bit. Most of my favorite dishes have gone up $3 since I first started coming here a few years ago. I like the food and probably would still frequent even with their raises every year if it was still as good consistently, but I think some of the items are priced too high for what they are, they are definitely higher than most competitors aside from Lindo which also prices rather high. \n\nGo during lunch as they tend to be better then. Also it's cheaper so that if you were iffy about the food, you just didn't pay $15 for 2 enchiladas. \n\nWhat is (usually) good here is the carnitas, the chile verde, the mole poblano, enchiladas and I think their mocajete is solid. \n\nI just wish they would up their standards a little bit again. I might look for a new Mexican food place."

Served with mexican rice, guacamole, pico de gallo and choice of tortillas. We had the carne asada & added Chorizo. \n\nTasty! But not as much meat as other places. A little spicy if you are sensitive. Chorizo was pretty salty. My wife used the left overs to make eggs the next day, sooo good!! \n\nEnchiladas Del Mar (Seafood Enchiladas) - Shrimp And/Or fish in Leticia's white Cream and Cheese sauce or Chile de Arbol spicy sauce. Served with a Poblano white Rice Casserole with crema, cheese and rajas. \n\nThis was really good and different take on a Mexican classic! \n\nPozole -  tender beef and pork, slowly cooked with a blend of red guajillo sauce and Leticia's special spices and hominy. Served traditionally with a side of tostaditas, lime, chopped onions, cilantro, chopped lettuce, radishes, oregano, crushed chile and avocad (Chicken Pozole also available).\n\nI didn't try it but my brother enjoyed it.\n\nQuesadilla - Large flour tortillas with house blend of Oaxaca melted cheese, served with guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream.\n\nThere was A LOT of cheese in these, easily shared by 2 people. Well made and tasty. \n\nThe table Chips, Salsa, and beans were really good too!\n\nDrinks: 5 Stars\n- The Mango \"Agua Fresca\" (Fresh Fruit Water) is AMAZING!! The Horchata was also good with a little creamy instead of watery taste most other places have.  \n\nPricing: 5 Stars\n- What you would pay at most sit down Mexican spots. Good portions! \n\nService: 4 Stars\n- Nice, friendly, attentive, they do a good job! There was a bit of a wait.\n\nAtmosphere: 5 Stars\n- Really liked the decor of this place, they really have a that Mexican culture feel. Even the Caucasian host was in a traditional dress!  \n\nComfort: 5 Stars\n- Plenty of seating, comfortable seats and tables. \n\nLocation: 5 Stars \nPlenty of parking in that area, easy seen from the road and simple to get to. \n\n- The Fat: \n\nWent out to eat with my brother and his family. Only my sister in law had been there and she loved the place. We weren't convinced though because not to offend, but she's a white girl and were all Mexican (our parents were born/raised in Mexico) so we have more a say so on Mexican food ;)   \n\nWe really had a hard time deciding on what to get cause the whole menu looks delicious! We were pleasantly surprised by the food. My wife and I love \"Molcajete\" but it's hard to find a good one, none the less, a place that even serves it! there is a lot of \"soup\" in the molcajete bowl so my wife used the left overs to make eggs the next day, sooo good!!\n\nI really enjoy the \"Enchiladas Del Mar\" and would get that next time. The Mango drink is to die for! If you want a different Mexican food experience far from the usual sit down Mex chains, go here!"

I got the carne asada fajitas thinking that this is a good rated restaurant with good food and high prices so the meat should b of quality!  Well, the carne asada was the kind of steak you have to chew on forever before deciding it's not not breaking down so you either have to spit it out or swallow it whole.  The to go condiments for fajitas was tiny and didn't fill much of the container they put it in and didn't come with sour cream either.  My husband ordered Leticias award winning quesadilla tacos and these were really good.  They were filled with shrimp.  The poblano white rice casserole was very bland though.  We got a small bag of tortillas, really should have taken a picture.  It probably was about 15 chips.  Would not order take away from there again,  prices were high and didn't get what expected out of a quality restaurant for the prices."

I don't know if she was new or just doesn't know the menu. She brought my daughter the wrong sauce then tried to lie that is was the correct one. We have been dinning there for 3years always order the same thing I guess it changed over night. I guess over night drinks are no longer included in the kids meal. Normally a kids cup of fideo is .50 but today Gladys charged us $3. She forgot to even order my other daughters food.  Initially took 10minutes just to acknowledge we where even sitting there. I know helping a mom with three kids is every servers worst nightmare, but my kids go there often and are well behaved. I hope our next visit will be with a better server."

When the Mrs. and I were discussing lunch plans on a Sunday afternoon, mexican food was mentioned and we were off to \"that mexican place right down the street.\" The atmosphere was great and we were greeted immediately by a friendly hostess. We were seated in an area near, but away from, the bar. Chips were on the table almost simulatneoulsy with us sitting down with three different types of \"dip\" to induldge in. The bean dip was outstanding. Great flavor with whole pinto beans, along with a mixture of the standard consistency of bean dip. The bean dip was accompanied by a red sauce and a green tomatillo sauce. Both were very good and full of flavor.\n\nWe ordered their mexican style corn as an appetizer. Corn on the cob, grilled to perfection and covered with crumbled bits of cotija cheese, melted butter and thick creamy mexican cream. This is a must have. I would have been satisfied just powering through these for lunch. I chose carne asada tacos for the entree. You have the option of hard, soft or \"puffy\" tortillas. The waitress was more than happy to allow me a different type of tortilla on each taco. I opted for soft and \"puffy.\" Both were great and I would describe the \"puffy\" as kind of like the torilla bowl you would expect to get a taco salad in. The carne asada was thee best I have had in Vegas. It was tender and juicy with plenty of spice and flavor.\n\nThe Mrs. chose the \"hamburgesa.\" You may be asking yourself \"why would she order a hamburger at a mexican food joint?\" One bite and you just might say \"this is the best hamburgesa I've ever had.\" I have had hamburgers at mexican restaurants before that are obviously just on the menu to satisfy someone who didn't want mexican but went along with the crowd. or was coerced by family or friends. This was anything other than your standard hamburger. The patty was handmade and seasoned to perfection. It comes on a torta style bun, complete with tomato, bacon and avocado. The french fries were crinkle style and mighty tasty. \n\nThe menu says if you check-in on Yelp and show the waiter/waitress, you will get a free dessert. We couldn't take advantage of this, as we were stuffed and in the beginning stages of our food comas. Although nobody was seated at the bar yet, it did look like pretty cool place to hang out, catch a game on the TV and enjoy your favorite libation.\n\nI highly recommend this place and will definitely be back to work my way through a menu that includes \"Baja Style Fish Tacos\", \"Rib Eye Tacos\" and \"Carne Asada Nachos.\""

The atmosphere is very authentic and fun.  The service was great and the food was delicious!  We were raving about our great experience for days.  My boyfriend and I thought we finally found a worthwhile Mexican restaurant near us. \n\nSadly, our most recent experience is probably going to be our last experience for a while.  The server seemed a little overwhelmed and we saw more of the busboy then anyone else.  Being a Tuesday night it wasn't jam packed.  Our burritos were beyond mediocre and I could've made a better one at home.   \n\nThe menu is a little pricy for Mexican food.  What we were once okay paying, now seems like a rip off.  I have no problem paying more for great food and the experience.  The past few times I've gone have been disappointing and I walk out feeling jipped. \n\nI hope that maybe somewhere in the future my boyfriend and I will go back and will be pleasantly surprised."

Went their this morning at 10:45 to beat the crowd and that was about the best thing about our visit. Chips and salsa took very long to arrive along with our extra bowl of bean dip that we had to ask twice for. My wife had the street tacos and I ordered the pozole. Her tacos came out lukewarm and she was very dissatisfied with the taste of rice and beans. My pozole was lukewarm as well when it arrived and i had asked for extra radishes when I had ordered and I received three pieces of a radish, seriously. They gave me about a tablespoon of cilantro and onions for my large bowl of soup, seriously. This is just being down right cheap not to mention that the radishes were dry. Now onto the fact that my water was only refilled once and I had to ask for that to be done. When refilled it had no ice so I was drinking warm water, I could have gotten colder water out of the tap. I honestly hate to post this because we have had good food from them before but it looks like that is a thing of the past. Oh yeah, they also overcharged us on our bill. Pick it up Leticia's or you are going to lose other customers."

The d\u00e9cor is pleasing to the eye and they have patio dining.  I opted for the inside.  To start, they offer chips with a tomatillo sauce and a darker salsa which was really good.  They also offer a small dish of refried beans.  I ordered the Carnitas plate which comes with your choice of soup (they offered two) or a salad.  I got the salad with the house vinaigrette.  That vinaigrette was fabulous!  The Carnitas plate came with refried beans, rice, guac and pico de gallo.  The pork was fork tender and fragrant.  The corn tortillas were warm.  I totally enjoyed my meal.  The service was good, albeit intrusive.  I like attention to my table, but not so much where everyone was stopping by the table to ask how everything was.  The waiter stopped by, the busboy stopped by, the host stopped by.  I fully expected someone to walk in off the street to stop by and ask about my meal.  I don't know if they have gotten some bad reviews and are trying to rectify the problem.  All told, the experience was good and I am glad I went.  I took a carryout and headed back to my hotel.

It was pretty bland and was in need of salt, but I would rather put my own salt on guacamole anyway.\n\nThe BF and I both ordered the street tacos.  The waiter said they were what he usually ordered and so we thought we were good to go.  I ordered ground beef, chicken and carne asada on flour tortillas.  They were so good and I think I found my craving for this place.  It really was so much food though.  I only ate two and picked at the 3rd one.  It came with rice and beans and I only had a couple bites of rice.  I do love the rice here...its a no nonsense rice-tomato sauce and diced onion is my guess.  The BF and I also split a Mexican style corn on the cob (they cut it in half) that came topped with a white creamy cheese sauce and seasonings on top.  The corn itself had little cornels so it was just blah to me.  I might have to try this corn again because I'm not quite sure how I felt about it.  It was much different than I've had before.\n\nThe middle of our meal the owner stopped by our table to make sure everything was going good. I think he has done that every time we have been here.  I always appreciate an owner or even the manager that can take time to acknowledge their customers.  A simple effort but not many do it.\n\nAs our dinner started to wind down the karaoke crew started funneling in.  I had forgotten that they do karaoke on the weekends.  So we extended our drinks and our stay to watch some people strut their stuff.  I believe the starting time was 9pm.  Pretty smart to bring in a new crowd just as the dinner crowd is thinning out.  I hope it brings in some added business for them.  Really fun to kick back, catch up with friends with some good live music in the back ground.  \n\nOverall, the service is very personable and caring, the food is a delight, the ambiance is cozy and after 9pm on the weekends live karaoke lovin.  Score!"

I have been here a few times and the dishes are consistently traditional and flavorful. \n\nService starts with chips and salsa both a red and green along with refried beans for dipping. All three are  delicious and made fresh in house. The tortilla chips that accompanied  the salsas are also delicious.\n\nMenu prices are a little high I feel but the portions and quality help to justify the price point. Daily specials that highlight traditional mexican home style dishes are very good. I had the Bisteque  and it was very good.  Tender beef with potatos, corn, peppers, and onions in a thick gravy like sauce was very good. I really enjoyed the white rice and beans. The white rice was prepared with sour cream and roasted peppers....Amazing! \n\nOne of the best parts of the meal was the free Margarita with the Yelp check in. It's always good to be a member of the club. Great beverage. \n\nEnjoy!"

I gauge a Mexican restaurant by its chips and salsa.  Chipotle and green were delicious.  Plus, you get a bowl.of creamy beans.  Never had that before.  I really had to control myself.  My girlfriend had grilled fish tacos so moist and we'll seasoned, not to mention a generous helping.  I had Camarones al mojo  de ajo.   Sauce was so good, I dumped all of my rice in to soak it up.  Their drinks are terriffic as well.  Strawberry Margarita with chopped jalape\u00f1o had a nice kick.  The people who work there are all really nice.  It is obvious that they take pride in what they do.  I look forward to visiting again!!!"

Reminds me of the tacos I could get when I hopped over to Tijuana when I Iived in SD. They're only about 1.75 each. 3 is enough for me. The carnitas & rib eye tacos are the best. I had the grilled fish tacos but I wasn't a big fan - I didn't like the sauce they put on top of it. \n\nDon't forget to check in onYelp! You ge a free fried ice cream which is delicious!

The people I was with who had meat entrees loved their food.  I did not like their red enchilada sauce.  It tasted terrible and ruined my dish.  The rice and beans were good.  My food was just average.  I would have rather gone to a lower end Mexican restaurant and had more vegetarian options and tastier food.  The server forgot one person's dish completely in our large party.  She asked about it, and the server had forgotten to put it in.  When we got the individual bills, they were all wrong and people's drinks and food were mixed up and not on the right bills.  We ended up just figuring it out amongst ourselves since the server wasn't very competent."

My particular burrito was made with Al Pastor and Red Guajillo, Black Beans, and House Blend Cheese. This was a BEAST...had to take the other half to go! Really loved the salsa...it was actually a bit spicy!\n\nI also liked the Queso Fundido : Chorizo, Gouda, and Menonita Cheese. Super cheesy mix, with tons of oil and fat...just like chorizo should be! It was almost too cheesy actually, with it being super stringy and a little difficult pulling apart! But that's what friends are for...to help you with your cheese!\n\nEven the complimentary salsa and chips are great, and bottomless if you enjoy them as much as us! \n\nPrices seem a bit steep at first, but the quality of ingredients, taste, and portions make it worth it.  Wish the portions were smaller with more reasonable prices to reflect that...ie a burrito at half the size, but around the $10 mark vs $15.\n\nTook plenty of pics, check em out! :"

They also don't serve energy drink here. I couldn't order a Vodka/Red Bull, but their margarita was delicious! We were patiently waiting for our check at the end. It took over 15 mins for us to get our check! I definitely can say that their chicken enchilada was one of the best I've ever had."

Yes!\n\nI will start by saying I love the decor on the inside and outside and the bar area looks great. \n\nThe waitresses were very friendly and were doing a great job at serving our table of 7. The menu was okay but a bit pricy. \n\nI ordered 2 tamales rice and beans dish for $10.89 my hubby ordered the chicken enchiladas rice and beans for $13.89 + a beer with tax and tip included came to $35, which was a little too high.\n\nThe meal itself wasn't too fresh or tasty. My tamale was a little too spicy and no taste, the rice was dry and looked like it was sitting around for hours under a heat lamp. The portion sizes of the sides were just not enough.\n\nIn a nutshell I don't mind paying good money for food, but this was definitely not worth it. I'm only giving this joint 3 stars because the service was friendly and the tamale was edible but that's all. If I ever come back I hope this place steps it up a bit."

Food great. \nBut went this past weekend with my daughters and when they brought our food, rice/beans were a bit cold but the tacos were pretty warms all our plates.  I noticed the rice and beans was cooked and left for awhile in their pots. I'm a cook I know. So, you need to get your money's worth, my daughter paid for the dinner,  I am teaching her that your paying for this food, don't ever accept what it is.  Your a customer and food needs to be hot and cooked well.   So I asked the waiters about it and they were very understandable did take it back and gave us a whole new hot plate of food.  It looked fresh.  But there are no excuses to ever bring your customer a cold plate. I didn't get that.  That's my point. I hope that when I go there again it doesn't happen.  If it does I will walk out and not come back.  It's a shame because it's really a nice place to enjoy your food and great atmosphere."

I just don't get all the people that eat here and like it.  they can't possibly know real Mexican food.\n\nWhat a disappointment! DO NOT EAT HERE! The carnitas were bland, the tacos unbelievably salty, the taquitos were so over fried I could just about bite through them and the meat was dry and tasteless.... service was terrible - the waiter brought the wrong food... tell me, does \"TAQUITOS\" sound like \"FAJITAS\"???? Then by the time I actually got my taquitos the rest of my party was finished. What was offered to make up for this??? Oh, fried ice cream.. As if any of us wanted anything else fried. We ate outside. The table was filthy - chair were full of food crumbs - it looks like they have never washed the ground with a hose... people are banging into your chair as you eat to walk by... \n\nThis is truly THE WORST Mexican food I have ever eaten.... and I have eaten Mexican food in NJ and Hawaii - and even there it wasn't this bad! I don't know where the other people posting have eaten, or what their definition of good Mexican is - but you would do better at Taco Bell. \n\nTo add insult to injury, it is WAY over priced.... two street tacos were $13... three burnt, small taquitos also $13... save your time, your money, and your stomach and go elsewhere.\n\nMy husband, who has a cast iron stomach got sick and could wait to get home to run to the bathroom. Next day - he is still sick.\n\nFood is certainly not fresh. Not tasty. Not cooked well. Service is sub-par. I honestly don't know how the place is still in business."

Even though it's a huge hike north to go here, the food was so good I am sure we will be back often.\n\nThe chips looked worrisome, but looks are deceiving, they are fresh as can be and absolutely delicious. They come out with some very good bean dip, and a pair of excellent salsas (one red, one green) - No \"spicy pasta sauce on a bowl\" here - these salsas taste how salsa should taste.\n\nWe started our meals with the Mexican corn which was very tasty without being overwhelming and I followed this with a plate of Nachos. I was really pleased with the use of good quality Mexican cheese and the options available so I could tailor my nachos to my specifications. I went with carne asada (incredible quality for a nacho topping) and chiles toreados. \n\nNow, I'm something of a nacho connoisseur - if I see them on the menu then chances are they are what I am ordering - these were some really special nachos. It wasn't just the quality of the cheese. It wasn't the delicious carne asada and the fresh and tasty chips. It wasn't even the wonderfully roasted and flavourful whole green onions that laced the top of my food. It was a combination of everything. The best nachos I have eaten in Vegas by some distance.\n\nMy wife ordered vegetable enchiladas with mushrooms and spinach which came with a white rice casserole with crema, cheese and peppers. A real change from the \"Cheese in a tortilla with sauce\" that's often her only vegetarian option at Mexican places and we both really liked how Leticia's offers more to have with your meal than just rice and beans. Thought has really gone into this menu.\n\nOverall, a great meal in pleasant surroundings. An absolute no brainer to award this one 5 stars."

Since i was eating alone, I saddled up to the bar and ordered from the Bartender.  \n\nI decided on the Nachos and a Raspberry Iced Tea to wash it down.  While I was waiting for my order a server brought out complimentary Chips, Beans, and Salsa.  In Vegas, it's rare to get Beans with the comp Chips/Salsa....also, there were two Salsas.....a Chipotle based Salsa and an Avocado/Cilantro based Salsa.....it was excellent!\n\nA few minutes later my Nachos came out.  They were covered in Cheese and had two small portions of Sour Cream & Guacamole on top...certainly not enough for the entire dish.  The Nachos has a lot of potential....the Chips were fresh, all of the ingredients tasted very good....but the proportions were all messed up.  Too much Cheese, not enough Sour Cream/Guacamole/Pico de Gallo.....just the right amount of Beans & Jalapenos.  The Cheese was melted just right, but with some bites it overwhelmed the dish.  A lot of potential here...\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the meal and loved the friendly service and active owner who cares about her restaurant.\n\nWill I return?

After not dining here for 3-4 months, a group of friends and I decided to meet for lunch today and try it again. The chips, salsas, and beans were great as usual. I shared the empanadas (1 chicken tinga, 1 beef), Mexican corn, and had a bite of carne asada chimichanga. It was all good, but for the prices ($15 for the chimichanga burrito!) I feel it's not a great value. \nThe main area of concern was the service. After being seated it took 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order (water and iced tea), and an additional 20 minutes for the drinks to be delivered. Granted it was a Saturday afternoon, but it's standard to have at least waters brought out within 15 minutes of a party being seated. When we politely asked our server about the drinks, she made some excuse about the bartender being busy. Not cool Leticia's, not cool."

Food is good so I can't knock them on that, but the service by Saul is some of the worst. I've been in the restaurant business for over 20 years and this guy might be one of the worst servers I have ever encountered. He is a disgrace to people in the industry. All he does is smile like an idiot to your face, because he is clearly overwhelmed all of the time. He went from a buss boy to a server which was a poor decision on behalf of management, but even worse is that they keep him in a position that he will never succeed at. What makes me most upset about this place is the lack of management or ownership presence. The restaurant appears to always be busy, and it's because it takes and hour and a half for a three top to get entrees only. Pathetic!  \nThey truly need the help of a good consultant to go in and show them how to be operators of their business since it's clear that they are not capable of managing this place themselves. It is currently doing good volume, but if another place in the area opens up that is decent I don't think this place will make it which is sad. The lack of ownership presence on the floor shows they have no respect or appreciation for the customer. Good restauranteurs are involved in their business during peak times so they can evaluate what the business needs to improve on. It's clear they aren't watching their social media reviews which are done by customers taking time out of their busy day to tell them either what they are doing well or what they need to improve on. 7-12-16\n\nUpdate: After this review was posted the GM emailed me with a response to how things were handled. I appreciate the fact that they take reviews seriously, and the importance of customer feedback. Great job! I had to raise my review from a 1 star to  a four star, because they do have great food and that's the reason most people go out to eat. \n\nFirst review:\nI frequent this place a couple times per month because the carnitas are very good. \nMy last few experiences have been less than stellar. Customer service has fallen off drastically, and there is no management presence so the staff does whatever they want. Nobody has ever come back to ask how everything is and if they can get anything else before they bring the bill. The last time I was in which was yesterday the very inexperienced server rang in both orders incorrectly and when we finally had to track him down it took another 25 minutes to get one carnitas taco. How it takes 25 minutes to put pre cooked meat on a flour tortilla with some onion and cilantro is mind blowing. There was no manager to complain to. It took an hour and a half for two people to eat which makes it clear why it always looks busy in there because they don't turn tables very fast. \nGET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!"

This isn't your typical chain restaurant.\n\nThe environment inside is very nice. Decor matches the obvious theme, the lighting is at a slight dim and the bar has a sort of cantina look to it. Every time I've been the staff has always been pleasant and personable, always willing to strike up conversation besides the typical \"What can I get for you?\" routine.\n\nThe first thing they bring out are tortilla chips made in house, along with bean dip, verde salsa and a black salsa. The chips and dips are so good that you can get full from eating so many, they are that delicious. They have a crisp airy taste and taste like they just finished making them. When I say the chips are baked in-house, you can genuinely taste that they are. Amazing way to start a meal.\n\nMy first visit there I ordered the Milanesa and man was I blown away. Everything seemed to be cooked perfectly. The portions are huge so unless you come with an appetite plan on leftovers. My second visit I ordered the quesa shrimp tacos and just when I thought their food couldn't get better these tacos proved me wrong. The only way I can describe their food is to let your taste buds do all the talking for me. I decided to try out their dessert and their tres leches is delicious. I was given complimentary coffee with it which was an amazing gesture in my book. Be sure to check in as sometimes you'll get a free treat to top your meal!\n\nOverall, this place takes the cake when it comes to Mexican dining. Prices can get a tad steep but I'm okay for paying a little more when the food is well worth it. A++ in my book."

It is a very long way away from my house, but I felt good enough about the tip to drive all the way across town today to check it out for lunch. I ordered make your own combo which I chose the noodle soup, chicken enchilada with red sauce, beef tostada and added in an extra of Carne Asada.\nLunch started two very good salsa's and warm bean dip, and was quickly followed up with a very tasty tomato noodle soup!\nThe main course was nothing short of excellent. My fav was probably the carne Asada, but the other two were excellent as well. The beans and rice were a very nice compliment! The great news is that it is far and away the best Mexican food in Vegas in my opinion!!! My waiter, Walter was also great... Taking care of all my needs! The bad news is that it is 40 minutes away from my house, but I will be scooping up all my friends and diving back over to enjoy often!!!

I can only imagine my disappointment and confusion had I read the reviews before eating at this restaurant.\n\nWe went on a Sunday around 2:00.  The hostess was unfriendly and unwelcoming, but nonetheless we were seated quickly.  The restaurant look and feel is very average.  No unique decor, no ambiance, just your basic looking food house.  Very misleading from the outside appearance, in my opinion.\n\nAs I perused the menu, I was particularly struck by all of the specific rules, guidelines, directives, footnotes, etc.  Split plate charges (even on kids meals!), drink substitution upcharges, different type of rice charges, etc.  I actually read the whole menu cover to cover because it was so silly.  I actually found myself wondering if the chips and salsa would be charged to us, or not refilled for free.  Hey, I understand businesses have to make money, but the food is already way overpriced and expensive, the special rules just make it absurd.\n\nAnyway, so the super tiny basket of tortilla chips and 3 varieties of salsa/dip were brought to our table by an apathetic busgirl.  The waiter soon followed and placing our orders was an easy, quick process.  We ate the chips in about 4 minutes, so we flagged down the busgirl to get a refill.  I was surprised to learn that the chips and salsa were, in fact, complimentary (haha), but we ended up receiving our first refill after our food was already delivered to the table (so about 20 minutes from the time we asked).  Which, hey, great, we didn't fill up on chips and salsa, right?\n\nSo, I had an order of ceviche and a carnitas street taco.  The ceviche was fine.  Not good, not bad.  Just basic.  The street taco was absolutely disgusting.  At first, I was impressed with the amount of meat, but when I realized it was very little meat and mostly globs of fat, I quickly lost my appetite.  That was made worse when I smelled my husband's ground beef tacos, which, I swear, smelled like cat food.  My husband, who eats everything, ate about a half of his taco.\n\nIn the end, we chalked this up to a \"learning experience,\" and paid our bill and left.  We are not the type to complain to try and get something for free.  I sent in feedback online, because I think it's important for the owners to know the details, but I haven't heard back.  I can't say I'm surprised, and I will never step foot in this restaurant again."

Had the grilled fish street tacos today and they were excellent.  I am still craving them tonight!  My husband loves the puffy tacos.  They are tacos in shells similar to the shell you get on a Tostada salad.  Looked yummy.  Carnitas and Carne Asada platters are great choices as well.  Large portions so you can take some home for lunch the next day."

A little greasy but can be good hang over food. The rib eye was very tender and juicy. Yum all around\nChipotle fajita tamales- Definitely get the green sauce. Good vegetarian option- filled with onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms. \nOMG Churros! Sinfully sweet and coated with cinnamon sugar. Served with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces on the side.

When we told the waiter, the waiter said \"Well don't you even want to taste it?\" NO! we just want what we ordered to begin with. Their red sauce tastes like a mild mole sauce, which was not all that good. I ordered a taco and it was pretty good, but beans and rice were cold. It was higher priced than most places, which would have been ok, had it been good!\nWe will not go back!!!!!!!!!"

When I walked in, the place has an odd smell, maybe it was the furniture or ventilation?  It wasn't an encouraging first impression.\n\nDecor is nice, wood furniture with lots of Windows.  Service very friendly.\n\nWhen the chips and salsa came, it came with a red, green and bean dip.  Both salsas had excellent flavor and respectable spice level without burning your mouth.  Love bean dip, but this one had a hint of cloves which I don't generally care for.  It grew on me, however, I wondered if all the sauces were going to have \"twists\" on the traditional versions.\n\nI ordered one chicken enchilada green sauce, one shredded beef in red sauce, and one crispy tacos.  When it came out, I got concerned again, since the presentation was really nice.  In my experience, the Mexican places with fancier presentation often lack authenticity. I usually go for no fanfare.  \n\nTo my surprise however, the chicken enchilada may have been the best I ever had.  Fresh bright flavor including fresh oregano, tart tomatillo sauce and really tender chicken breast.  Generous amount of meat too.\n\nThe shredded beef was super tender and flavorful, and the taco shells were lightly fried just the way I do them at home.  Both very good, although the chicken enchilada was the star on this day.\n\nI'm really picky about authenticity, and Letticia's pleasantly surprised me at every turn.  I don't know if I'll ever be back in this remote area, but the locals have themselves a gem in this one.\n\nIf you're a stickler for quality and authenticity like I am, you'll really appreciate this place.  \n\nImmaculate bathroom for bonus points lol...it matters."

I wasn't too sure what to try because they all seemed delicious. I ended up ordering the Ribeye Tacos...YUM! My cousin ordered the tamales and I had a little sample...totally worth trying.\n\nThe second time I came here I tried the Quesa Tacos because the server said it was one of the best items on the menu and I wouldn't be let down. He was right!! I ordered the Quesa Tacos with carne asada with a side of queso rice; I totally recommend trying it and trust me you can probably share because the tacos are pretty filling and the rice is amazing. \n\nThe third time I came here I tried the shrimp tacos (grilled), yeah I don't recommend it at all just because it was salty and just not that great. However, my cousin ordered the Empanadas and had a little bite of it and it was really good. \n\nBTW if you check if you get a free fried ice cream, so make sure you check in and show your server because dessert is a perfect way to end your meal."

I ordered the chicken fajitas and she ordered cheese enchiladas. It smelled great with the peppers and onions. Unfortunately the chicken had no seasoning, it was as if they just bought the chicken from Albertsons and grilled it with no spices. The beans tasted like Rosaritas straight out of the can. The cheese enchiladas Were hard on the tortilla edges. So we both agreed not to go there again. We could of cooked that same meal with more flavor for less. Just my opinion. I know others like this place but its just not for us."

The hostess walked by us after seating another table and asked if we had been helped yet and we replied with a no. She brought us our chips and salsa and we still had not ordered drinks (we didn't even have water). Finally the lady who was refilling waters brought us some, but did not say a word to us and still no sign of a waiter. We waited about another 15 minutes and no one had even acknowledged us so we ended up leaving. Now I understand that it was a Saturday evening and they were busy, but to not even have someone say a word to us or bring us anything except for our hostess was pretty ridiculous!

In the end we felt that it was a cover up to how slow their food serving was. It took forever for our food to get to the table. We have been told that the timing is solely about taste and delivery but when we received our plates we wondered why they still lacked taste. My two cheese enchilada in red sauce plate was disappointing in all areas. The cheese was cluttered and not melted and the red sauce was overbearing. My husbands fajita plate was alright to his taste yet he said it was a little bland. All he received was a tablespoon of guacamole and when he asked if he could get a little more we joked about how he better not be charged for the additional tablespoon sized guacamole they brought to the table yet we were charged $2.50 which was ridiculous. Only saving grace to my disappointment was the two child plates. We ordered a child chicken enchilada meal and a child beef taco meal. Granted my kids both skipped on the rice and beans, they both ate their main dish which was a plus for me seeing as how my WHOLE plate went untouched and I was still charged and had to pay for mine. Definitely not worth it and won't be back.

Their street tacos are ALMOST as good as real street tacos from the taco stand in the hood lol. If you go you gotta get dessert.! Best fried ice cream I've ever had! Yummy! Great atmosphere.

We tried to persuade our friends to go elsewhere but they wanted to stay so we did as well.  We ordered elote corn,  a cheese quesedilla and a horchata.  the horchata was too sweet so I traded it for a soda.    The salsas were good but the chips tasted odd. The food took a while to be delivered to the table. The cheese in the quesedilla was too salty.  The elote arrived about five minutes later and was cold.  The service itself was pleasant.  Rating not withstanding, we won't be returning."

It is located in the far northwest of the valley, but luckily we live within 10 minutes away.\n\nWe dined here last night and it was everything I had hoped for.  We were seated right away, and we had our drink orders and chips served almost immediately. Our food server (waitress)  was wonderful, the margarita's were delicious and the chips/salsas/bean dip were freshly made (a bean dip, a smoky mild salsa, and a guacamole/cilantro smooth dip).\nWhen the meal arrived, I knew before even taking the first bite, that it would be great. And it was.  We both ordered the shredded chicken enchilada's with Ranchera sauce (they offer other flavor sauces but we have been looking for Ranchera sauce with enchilada's for as long as we have searched for a restaurant.)  Our rice (Mexican rice) and refried beans were very tasty with a lot of good flavorings.\n\n The quaint little street the restaurant is located is designed beautifully, and the interior d\u00e9cor was very nice, and colorful. We will definitely be coming back."

Chef Leticia has my utmost respect, the first time I had the opportunity to meet her, she was cleaning off a table, and expediting food for the kitchen. She took my order, allowed my changes, and cooked my food to my specifics, and then delivered it to my table, to make sure it was correct. How many Executive Chef's do you know, that would put that much effort into a plate, especially during a dinner rush? Leticia's has surpassed my expectations, and actually inspired me to cook better for my own family. The food is brilliant, the atmosphere is great, and the price is right!"

There were 3 of us dining and 1 had the Milanese Chicken, which was absolutely horrible and almost inedible. The chicken was pounded so thin and pan seared that it was like a dried piece of chicken jerky.  The carne asada burrito was just okay (Cafe Rio is better and cheaper). I had the Taquito's, the potato and cheese was the only good thing about my dinner, the chicken taquito and the beef were both very dry and the meat was tough. Not including the tip dinner was over $60 (only 1 beer).  I would only go back for the potato and cheese taquitos."

We loved it so much the time we ate here before despite the ordeal we went through (see my previous review for details) that I knew it wouldn't be long before I had some of this yummy food in my tummy.\n\nI was so pleased with the \"Happy Hour Menu\". It runs Mon-Fri from 3-6 pm. You can get margaritas 50% off! They have other food items starting at $2.50. We tried the \"Cheese Quesadilla\" and \"Chorizo Taco\". Both were well worth the regular menu price but getting them and just a great discount is just a bonus! They had other things like nachos, toastadas etc.\n\nI tried the \"Carnitas & Carne Asada Tacos\" tonight and they were just so tasty. The rice that comes with it is good but the beans are the winner. The beans are thick and have great flavor.\n\nThe \"Fried Ice Cream\" is very yummy!\n\nMy experience as far as service and the food and restaurant are the same.

A true dining gem and one..knowing what I know now..would drive from any of the three other points of the valley to visit.\n\nParking has never been an issue.  That being said depending on when you arrive,  the wait could be an issue.  My advise is be prepared as the inside and outside waiting area's are small.  You could opt for a seat in the bar to wait or dine.  But is you have to wait..where ever that might be..hang in there because it it all worth it.\n\nThe inside of LMC is full of character and when you are eventually seated, creates a vibe where you can focus on your family and drown everything else out.\n\nThe chips, salsa, and bean dip are divine.  Many a visit I have sabotaged myself.  DON'T DO IT!  It might take you a few visits to learn this and STILL on my most recent visit I failed to heed my own advise.  BALANCE!  Don't spoil the meal with a belly full of this mana.\n\nMy personal favorites (so far) are as follows...\n\nThe Queso Fundiso, it's fun to say and fun to eat.  Make sure you add the fungus (mushrooms).  It's makes this gooey and cheesy combination with the delicious tortillas POP!\n\nNext up is Leticia's award winning \"Quesa Tacos.\"  This consists of a blend of melted cheeses cooked in a delicious sauce.  You can choose shrimp, chicken or beef, carne asada, or many other meats.  The beef and the shrimp have been my favorites.  You can control the heat of the meal to your liking.  The Pobalano rice is phenomenal!\n\nOn my last LMC adventure, I thought I would try something REALLY different.  \"El Molcajete\" is the prehistoric version of the popular flaming fajitas. Primal but even more delicious, it comes in a smoldering bowl which looks like it was made out of volcanic stone.  A slab of tender carne asada, cheese, ranchero sauce, with shrimp. There was also some greenery hanging off the side which I thought was poblano pepper.  WRONG! After looking at the website, it was a delicious piece of Mexican Cactus.\n\nThe Margarita's...............................You will just have to experience them yourself.\n\nThe service though one time or two seemed overtaxed.  But the other staff tries hard to fill in making the experience seamless.  When everything IS in sync, no one cane beat it's tasty and friendly efficiency."

That definitely explains some of the great tastes found here.\n\nChips and Salsa start the meal, like almost every Mexican Restaurant here in Las Vegas.  That is not the case in the places I have been in Mexico... but I'm a fan anyways.  And Letecia gives you three dip choices...  A traditional salsa, salsa verde, and bean dip.  All are excellent, though my favorite is the bean dip. \n\nThe entree's are excellent.  They boast a variety of creative tacos that will really get your tasebuds firing.  But I was all about the mole poblano on this trip.  Now I have had some great mole's in Mexico and every one is different from the next.  Here in the states, most places get too caught up on the \"chocolate\" part.  In reality several Mole's don't even include chocolate and those that rank among the best in Mexico don't emphasize the chocolate.  The sauce has dozens of ingredients.  I was really excited to try Leticia's.  Unfortunately, it came across too chocolate for me.  This will probably appeal to a lot of people... but not me.  Everything else was great and all my party enjoyed their food.  It was all excellent.... but I just didn't care for the mole.\n\nTopping off your meal with fresh Churo's is a nice nod to Mexican street food and truly delicious.\n\nThe service was excellent and the restaurant is clean and inviting.  I like Leticia's a lot!  I will be back often for the tacos and enchiladas... but not for the mole poblano.  I am glad to have a great Mexican restaurant in an area that is starving for restaurants.  I hope Leticia's sticks around.  \n\nGive it a try!"

From the chips and three types of salsa that arrives immediately, to the authentic, home cooked food. \n\nEven though we've been there 1/2 dozen times, I'm still surprised how good things are. We continue to try different things, but even a simple dish like the quesadilla with carnitas can be a great meal. It's an appetizer, but it's phenomenal. \n\nWe're lucky, we live only a few miles from Leticia's.

We recently decided to try Leticia's because it looked so appealing from the outside.  \n\nWe were NOT disappointed when we walked in. It is very cute and gives an instant feel of being in a local, family-owned, neighborhood restaurant. We were greeted warmly and were immediately glad we had come in.\n\nWe have now been there 3 times in 2 weeks.  We have sat at the bar each time.  The food is fresh and delicious and the carne asada has the most amazing flavors.  It was instantly our favorite!\n\nThe staff, including owner Leticia was extremely welcoming.  The bartenders are great!  Ignacia is friendly, very attentive and seems like an old friend when she chats with us.  Wendy is the epitome of friendly and always has a smile while she is giving us her full attention.  Saul is a mixologist.  He has won awards for a few of his drinks and when you taste the strawberry jalepeno margarita you will see why.  He is friendly, professional and knowledgable of the wide variety of tequila's. \n\nWe are going to take friends there next week and cannot wait to show off our new favorite place.  The only downside I can see is that it has become an addictive pleasure for us.  We look forward to going frequently!"

It took 30 mins  for the waitress to comeback to take our order. \n\nWe waited, and waited and waited. In the mean time other customers were being seated and eventually served, a few even finished eating. By this time the whole restaurant was full. We kindly asked the bus person, and the waitress about our food. Finally the manager came to our table and told us he was going to check on our food. \n\nBy this time it had been ONE hour and THIRTY mins since our order was taken. The manager came back and kindly said that our food was still not ready. \n\nHe did offer to comp our bill. But that didn't resolve our food not being ready after almost two hours. This is the first time I've walked out of a restaurant. To think that I've praised Leticia's for years makes me even angrier. \n\nThank you Leticia's Mexican Cocina."

Unfortunately it was nothing special, in fact it was a pretty poor dining experience.\n\nOur wait wasn't that long, though the restaurant was incredibly busy. Our waitress had absolutely no people skills and was clearly in a rush to get through ordering and move on to a new table. She was also seemingly unable to answer any questions about the menu.\n\nWe ordered drinks and they were forgotten about until our entrees arrived, which was only minutes after the chips and salsa arrived. This kind of \"speedy\" service is nothing but rushing a guest through dinner so they can turn over the table faster. This resulted in little time to enjoy the chips, salsa, and guacamole we ordered.\n\nThe food was sub-par. The chips didn't taste fresh, the guacamole was covered in cheese (that wasn't specified on the menu) which completely took away from the taste of the avocados. I ordered the enchiladas (one red and one green) and both were tasteless. The sides of rice and beans tasted as if they had been sitting under a lamp for a good hour or so which wouldn't surprise me given how quickly they arrived. I also ordered a house margarita that tasted more like pure sugar than anything else.\n\nOverall, poor service and mediocre food. Based on the rave reviews this establishment had up until the last few months, something has clearly gone wrong at Leticia's."

The bean dip was ok, the red salsa was marginal, and the green salsa tasted like grass. I ordered the Tampiquena--made from top sirloin which sounded interesting. When I attempted to order it medium rare, the waiter tried to explain to me that it could not be cooked to order because it was pre-cooked ( I assume he meant marinated) in lime juice, but he assured me that it was very good. I was presented with a very thin, tough and poorly seasoned piece of beef with some cold, clumpy queso on top of it. Not at all impressed. The enchilada that came with it was ok--but certainly nothing special. Judging from the other reviews here, I either came on the wrong night or ordered the wrong thing. If I happen to be this far north in LV again, I might give it another shot."

The check said jalapeno margarita $8 + $1 for strawberry.  Not sure why i was charged the extra dollar.  I also ordered the fish tacos which were $13 on the menu the check showed $13 + $1 for Fish. excuse me? you charged me a dollar for fish when i ordered fish tacos?? lastly the fish tacos came with ONE wedge (for 2 large tacos) of lime which had not one drop of juice so i showed the waiter the lemon was dry and asked him for a replacement.  He took so long my tacos got cold and i ended up using the lime from my margarita cup instead.  He finally showed and apologized for the long wait.  I noticed on my bill i was charged $0.75 for lime :-/ Not cool.  The food was pretty good and the place is close to our house but we will not be returning. Makes me wonder how many suckers (like us) are paying the misc fees without even noticing.  I doubt we will be returning.  CHECK YOUR BILL EVERYONE!!!!!"

The salsa brought with chips when you are seated ( and you server acknowledges your existence) its so delicious it makes it a little hard to write this review. We had to ask the busser to take our drink order, then about 10 mins later we had to ask him to have someone come take out order. With a 3 yr old and 1 yr old in our party it was getting ridiculous. Our busser (great young guy) hurried around the restaurant doing as much as he could for several tables I saw the servers standing off to the side talking. As we waited for our food another patron was up front complaining she had only seen her server once and was NOT happy about her service. One of our water cups was dirty and when the guy came around to refill it was with carbonated water and had to give us all new water (no biggie) the food FINALLY came and the kids were beyond starving (took about 30 mins) I could understand if the place was busy but there were 4/5 tables max... The food was a little cold but tasted great. The place is clean and the decor is very nice. The music and the salsa were my favorite part. We left a nice tip (for the busser) it's sad to think this kid worked as hard as he did for a woman whom we interacted with twice to get the tip.. I'm not sure the salsa is enough to bring us back. Staff really needs to get it together even on a slow day. People that were seated after us had their order taken before us and we had to ASK to helped."

I loved all the fresh veggies that you can add in proportions to your own liking.  I also learned (from having leftovers - the portion sizes were generous...  I had leftover soup from ordering a small) that the avocado in the soup (this soup, at least) was still bright green the second day when I reheated it for lunch as it was the first day.  Cool!\n\nI live down in the Anthem area and can't think of any Mexican restaurant that quite met up to what I saw or experienced this day.  Although I do love Las Cazuelas - gave them 5 stars, too - but their menu is pretty tiny compared with Leticia's although it has the mom and pop atmosphere.  That's really the only possible complaint about Leticia's - its success means they're no longer a mom and pop place - not bad, just not as personal as it undoubtedly was when it first started.

For really reasonable mexican quizine that is tasty this place is good. And childrens menu helps."

But I think they have the best Carne Asada. Tonight I had the Nacho fries with the carne Asada. Very full feeling. Didn't even eat them all.\n\n\nSo all the good things said\nThe service has declined and we only saw our waiter 3 times. Once to take our order. Second time to drop off food. Third was our check. The little bus boy had to stop him to refill my drink. This manager lady walked by twice and never offered to refill my empty glass. There used to be a guy named Gus. He made you smile and always told you what was best to order. \nThis is a good place to eat. But this is definitely not a Texas style Mexican cantina. Still on the search for a New Mexican restaurant i can call home.\n\nShould I go back.........yes no maybe\nIt will be awhile maybe a few months or so."

He made eye contact with our table grabbed the chair from the floor and walked away without even acknowledging the fact he hit a customer. I know he was aware of it because he went and told the manager about the incident right in front of the kitchen window, we were seated two booths over so we were able to see & hear the conversation happen. Not the waiter or manager came over to make sure he was okay or apologize for the incident. We let the incident go and even returned tonight giving it a last chance.

When he came back, he had no beer, ran to the bar, came back and said they were out of Dos Equis.... Not okay with that delay, or paying for the Pacifico that I didn't really want. Anyway, the service got a little better from here on out, except that when my mother ordered her chicken enchiladas, he tried to push a different style chicken on her, which was very awkward.

The service was special for sure.\n\nMy husband has ordered their pozole a few times over and seems to be salty each time he has ordered it. He works nearby and sometimes he comes in there because vendors or board members would like to eat there as a informal lunch meeting so he has more dine-in experience. He has felt they have gone downhill. He doesn't feel the price ratio to food quality match and have been inconsistent. I have to agree because their taco salad was pretty skim considering it starts at 10 bucks then whatever extra it costs to add meat. \n\n5 stars for the corn because I never had mexican street corn until here and I have yet to find a spot that can beat that euphoria I felt upon taking my first bite. Corn wasn't overcooked at all! \n\nOverall, it's just a 3 star spot for me. I was really excited the first time.in hopes of finding a good sit down mexican restaurant...but unfortunately, Leticias isn't it for us at least. There's nothing extra special aside from.it being the only decent restaurant within the Tule Springs vicinity.

I was ecstatic to learn that Leticia's had potato and cheese flautas ($13.98). Whhaaa! I'm all about that vegetarian flauta life! The entree comes with 3 flautas and a side of rice and beans. The flautas are topped with guacamole, pico, and authentic Mexican queso (the tasty white crumbly cheese). This entree is way too much food for me, but I do my best to eat all I can, savoring every bite!\n\nThe Mexican rice here is where it's at it. I am particularly picky when it comes to Mexican rice. The Mexican rice at Leticia's, however, reminds me of the rice my mom and grandma make. I get all nostalgic eating that stuff! \n\nService could be better, but it's sufficient.  \n\nIn a nutshell:\nFood: 5\nAmbiance: 4\nService: 3-4\n\nOf course I'll be back! This is the only legit Mexican restaurant I've come across in Vegas.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #12"

Over the years the prices have slowly gone up and I get that. I don't expect a restaurant to keep the same prices forever. I am a vegan and my husband is a vegetarian and we have limited menu choices at any restaurant. I have always loved their vegetable fajitas. On our last visit the price of veggie fajitas was $19. $19 for a hot plate of sizzling veggies, rice and beans??? I realize you get the fajita fixings and guacamole on the side but $19 is just too high for something I can make at home for a few bucks. Yes, I can make fajitas just as good at home with a flavor that's not just primarily salt. So, goodbye Leticia's...even though it is about 2 blocks from our house."

The hostess was a little confused right at 11 when they opened and we were a little worried but our fears quickly subsided when our waitress and bus boy took excellent care of us.  We loved the chips and the three dips and both got super fresh salads with the taco lunch special.  My husband had the ground beef taco and I had the carnitas and it was filled with lots of delicious meat and we loved the beans and rice too.  We asked for some hotter sauce and it was hot but tasty.  We also had some delicious margaritas.  We live in CA but will definitely make the trip to Leticia's the next time we are in town."

We ordered their signature tacos, some tostadas and the fajitas!  All flavorful and amazing!  The carnitas taco was amazing, seasoning just perfect!  Their ground beef tostada was to die for!  Their ground beef has to be the best in Las Vegas!  I can't wait to come back to try a beef burrito!  The fajitas were piping hot and everything was succulent and juicy!  All white meat chicken!  We are waiting on sopapilla's and im more than positive I'll be mind blown by these as well!  The service was amazing, our waiter gave us the most amazing recommendations and I am so excited that I finally got to try this place!"

There were multiple great reviews so we were looking forward to trying it out. \n\nThe vibe we got coming in set the tone. We did not feel welcome. Our service felt like they thought we were a waste of time, certainly not as a guest. \n\nWe asked for one slight change to a menu item and that was flatly refused. \n\nAsked for some more chips and they took forever to do that, and tossed at us. \n\nFinally got our food, and it was pretty tasteless. \n\nThe TV report saying they hid the \"C\" rating card, pretty much reflects my experience with them. \n\nThe food and service were enough for us never trying it again.

The first time we sat at a booth by the bar and a college football game was on so it was a little loud but we could easily carry on a conversation. Our waiter was extremely helpful in answering questions, and we were promptly served our beer, waters and chips with salsa trio.\n\nYou can choose from family style or individual selections and we each chose seperately. My mom got Guisados de Casa -chile verde which was really good. The pork was super tender without being mushy or fatty and was seasoned well. I got chicken fajitas which were excellent....two people could easily share this. My husband got spicy chicken quesatacos...they were okay but the poblano casserole served alongside was awwwesome. \n\nOur second trip was just as successful. We went on a weeknight and it was much quieter. Our waitress was helpful, although not quite as prompt. Very friendly however! My mom went with spinach and mushroom enchiladas which she liked but I probably wouldn't order...I felt like they needed something to brighten them up and cut the heaviness of the creamy sauce. My husband and I each ordered grilled fish tacos with soft flour tortillas. I have had fish tacos from Ensenada to Costa Maya to Belize and I can say 100% that these were the best I've ever had, and it's hard to top eating them while sitting on a white sand beach with turquoise water staring at you. \n\nThe fish was perfectly seasoned and light, super fresh tasting with a perfect fish to sauce ratio. The veggies were also perfectly proportioned and every bite was just as perfect as the first.  We mentioned to the server how much we enjoyed them and she told us on Monday nights their street-sized tacos are all available for 1.25 each! \n\nIt's five minutes from our house...super close proximity to pick up after-dinner cupcakes from retro bakery (prior to dinner, retro closes at 7 I think) and both our visits yielded both stellar food and service. This will be a regular stop for us."

It's actually perfect for a nice occasion maybe like a date or taking friends or relatives from out of town...which is what I did. And my relatives loved it too!\n\nThe servers are also just amazing. So attentive and sweet. Please tip them well. \n\nThey also have the cutest bar and fun, Latin music playing. It made us want to get up and dance, lol.

We still heart Casa Don Juan, but it's way on the other side of town.\n\nThe decor is nice, but maybe just a tad dark on the bar side. They brought out chips, salsa and bean dip, all of which were delicious. Best chips and salsa BY FAR that we have had in LV. The food was really really good. My wife had crispy tacos -- she loved the carne asada but didnt care for the chicken. The 13 year old had the ground beef taco and liked it. I had the Quesa Shrimp Tacos, the house specialty, and they were very good (the corn tortillas were ok, not great). The shrimp was SCRUMPTIOUS! Overall, the food was very good. Warning: the portion sizes are HUGE.\n\nI can see what other people are saying about the service. Our server was somewhat indifferent. It took quite a while to get our food. But it didnt ruin our meal, and I wouldnt let it stop you from trying the place.\n\nIt was a bit pricey -- $50 for 2 sodas, a 2 taco plate, a 1 taco plate, and the special tacos."

Leticia's is our \"go-to\", primarily because of the fantastic drinks, fun atmosphere, clean restaurant, and friendly service. We've been here enough to know what we like to order, but I'm docking them a couple stars because we've had a few misses on our entrees over the years. The carnitas, carne asada, and generally anything on the family style menu have been delicious. Some of their other dishes, (such as the pork guisados) have been lacking in flavor, or overly greasy.  So, give Leticia's a shot, but ask your waiter for his or her recommendation."

But we used to live a couple of miles away in Centennial Hills, and now that we have moved to Henderson, our \"couple of minutes\" drive changed to a \"little over a half hour\" drive.  But, um, we still do it...  Here's a quick list of why:\n1) Best Margarita in the valley.  Well, if you like them... I know, every place makes them differently, but here they use multiple fresh squeezed lime slices and that works with the pattern of fresh food here, and it's really tasty.\n2) Best interesting drink - the Pomegranite Margatini is totally unique and I can't even list all of the ingredients here...  But it's one of my wife's favorite drinks of all time!\n3) Ignacia - oh, yeah, the Margatini is generally only a good drink if she's the one who makes it.  Everything she makes is awesome, even if she's taking care of the bar and the entire dining room at the same time...\n4) Ignacia again - sorry to be redundant, but beyond drinks, she knows the food and what mama's making, and knows what is good, and very quickly learns what you like!  Which is invaluable... Even if you don't know what to order, just let her do it.\n5) To be fair, even if Ignacia is not working, the food is all fantastic and the drinks are awesome.  I just wish they'd open a place in Henderson!"

I work as a server as well & I just believe you should always make your guests feel welcomed rather than a nuisance. Our server Dolce (i believe was her name, didn't get a receipt) was extremely rude. My friends and I sat without water for about 20 minutes. we consistently tried to get our servers attention & she just kept walking away from our table as we were trying to order a drink. & then when I finally got frustrated and went to the bar to order my Bloody Mary, she asked me why I didn't order the drink through her! & when I responded saying that I had tried to, several times, she told me I didn't. Whatever, I just kept to myself but when it came to paying we had asked for separate checks & she brought one check & then disappeared for another 15 minutes & then split the checks with the wrong items on each bill. TWICE. I can understand that being confusing had there of been 10 of us or something but there were only 3. It's not that hard. Needless to say, my friends and I got so frustrated that we just paid the bill and then figured out the proper amounts later on. Overall experience... Disappointing, but I will be back nonetheless because the food is good."

The decor consists of pottery and brightly colored paintings along with cheerful tunes. I sense a familiar sound; it's mariachi music- a sound I can only tolerate with a full cultural experience (not one I experience on the radio or anywhere else lol)\nAt last- I am surrounded by a blanket of my mothers culture. Now I am ready for some authentic Mexican food!!! AYYYY YA YAYYY! (I am allowed to do this- It's in my blood)\n \nI love practicing my first language here- makes me feel cool. I ALWAYS order a delicious margarita- done just as my uncle Jesse would make them. \nFOOD- ODM (means OMG in spanish- Oh, Dios Mio!)

Really odd considering the more broth like soup I had been accustomed to. I later learned there are various ways to make it and this was one. Either way we brought it to out kind waiters attention and he took it off the bill and was very understanding. \nThe food was too authentic for me to never try it again...... So I've actually been back numerous times since... For business meeting, lunch specials and just for fun. \nIt's fast becoming my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant !!!!! It's a little pricey, but this can be avoided mainly by going during lunchtime! :) I'm sure they'll get another start once I've tried more on the menu. \nLove love love this place!!"

I was told to get the Chicken Fajitas so I did.\n\nThe salsas that they bring out first were amazing. I loved it! The green salsa was pretty baller. When the fajitas came out I was excited but when I started digging into them I tasted oil and butter. I'm not a huge fan of buttery veggies and chicken. My taste buds aren't quite up to that. The flower tortillas weren't exactly my favorite either. Too cakey. Overall the chips and salsa that were brought out were the best thing for me. The rest, well let's say for a chubby man that never leaves food on his plate there was plenty left when I left. \n\nI recommend swinging in for the salsas and if you like buttered down veggies."

Service was OK and they weren't even busy. I think Roberto's down the street taste way better for a fraction of the price."

About 30 minutes later the bartender finally got our drinks to us. Another 10 minutes we noticed tables clearing out and no line at the door. My husband went to the hostess to find out if we could get a table yet. They totally forgot about us! Our server was just as bad and should not be in the food service industry. We tried to give her a pass since she seemed to be in pain and have neck problems. It was difficult getting her to come over for a drink refill or even come back to the table but she was sure busy on her phone. Food was mediocre. Hopefully they were all just having an off night not sure if we will come back. We certainly won't recommend them anymore!"

Now let's just hope it can STAY open!\n\nThere were good things about Leticia's and a few not-so-good things. \n\nTHE GOOD\nOur chips and salsa and waters were brought to our table right away... like within 3 minutes of sitting down.  I like that.  The chips weren't anything special by any means, but both types of salsa were very flavorful.  I especially liked the chipotle based one.\n\nThe menu had a lot of variety, lots of things I would have liked to try.  It was hard to decide what I'd try first.\n\nThe prices were very reasonable for big portions.\n\nMy shrimp tacos were excellent.  (The rice that came with them was a different story, but more on that below.)\n\nI'm embarrassed to admit that we ate through a whole basket of chips and a whole cup of that chipotle salsa.... but happy to say that we didn't even have to ask.... they just brought us more as soon as we were done.\n\nThe service staff seems to work very well together.  They seemed on top of things everywhere we looked, and were definitely good to us.\n\nTHE BAD\nMy husband's seafood enchiladas were definitely \"meh.\"  Very bland tasting, with more of a pasta-type sauce on top.  But even more bland was the rice that came with my shrimp tacos.  UGH that was some nasty, dry, tasteless stuff!\n\nOur desserts were very fairly priced, but just kinda \"meh\" too.  He got the fried ice cream, which had a kind of stale-tasting shell around the ice cream.  I had the sopapillas, which were ok.  I mean it's just fried dough with some cinammon and sugar.... there's not a whole lot you can do with that ... but I have had better.\n\nIf I were going with my kids, this would be up in the \"good\" section, but because we were out on \"date night,\" I'll put this here.  This place is VERY much a family restaurant.  Like I said, that can be a GOOD thing if you have kids... and I would definitely think of taking my daughter here ... but if you're going for a date night type atmosphere, I wouldn't choose this place.  There were LOTS of kids... pretty noisy.  \n\nAnd I'm apparently in the minority here since it seems that every restaurant is doing this now.... but I don't understand why there has to be TVs playing sports on every wall.  At a sports bar/pub?  Yes.  At a Mexican Cocina?  I don't get it.  \n\nAll-in-all we liked our experience there pretty much.  I won't be rushing back, but I wouldn't mind going again to try some other stuff."

They have deserts which I have not seen offered at other Mexican restaurants, such as Capirotada (Mexican bread pudding). The server was happy to make recommendations and frequently checked in to ask of the meal was and if I needed anything else. I ordered an horchata and loved it. It was served in a huge glass (no refill needed) and so authentic, like the kind made at our family functions. It tried the Taquiza (Mexican Street Tacos) in chicken, carne asada and al pastor. They were all really great and will be back again to have them. I also had two tamales, Green Sauce Chicken and Rajas Con Queso. Unfortunately, I did not like the tamales, kinda of dry even though I got them \"Enchilada\" style. My server had mentioned that she did not care from them and that they were dry, prior to me placing the order. I appreciate her honesty and she was right. I will come back to sample more items and for the Taquiza."

He made sure our drinks were always filled and had extensive knowledge of the menu. We ordered the Nachitos Fritas as an appetizer and built our own burritos. Everything was perfect!! We couldn't finish everything so we got the rest of our burritos to go. I have to say it was just as good the second day!"
