            "review": "DO NOT EAT HERE EVER AGAIN!\n\nThe service is  very very very bad , the food doesn't taste great at all and their service is really really slow. For the price you are paying , its not worth to go here before the Blue Man Group Show. It's a better choice to have dinner at David Burke's restaurant. Our group was really really dissappointed with this restaurant.\n\nThe waiter that served us (including my boss, co workers and other clients) was very arrogant and was LYING to us from the beginning saying that we will make it on time for the Blue Man group show for ordering their Pre Theater show menu. At 6:50 pm we still didn't have our dessert, and our waiter said that \"oh don't worry the show doesn't start until 7:30 pm\". We all believed him and waited for our dessert .To end the story short, we were late and felt so humiliated during the show because they show bright lights on people that are late going into the Show.\n\nDO NOT EVER EAT HERE ... EVER!!!! PASS This on to everyone. Don't waste your money!!! Please pass this on!!!"

            "review": "I am not entirely certain what went wrong here, but something did.  The lighting was a bit too dark.  The wait staff was a bit too rigid.  The smoke wafting in from the casino was a bit too distracting.\n\nI really wanted to like B&B, but the situation conspired against me.  Granted, I ate what may be the best pork chop of my life there (a bone-in number with a quintz accompanyment), but I didn't walk out happy.  It's as if the restaurant started off on the wrong foot and could never entirely correct itself.  B&B won't crack any Top Ten lists for food on the Strip.  You can find countless other places offering impressive Italian fare for a more reasonable price and in more comfortable surroundings."

            "review": "With all the great food in Vegas, I feel a little cheated that I wasted my opportunity and money eating here.  It's my second Batali experience and guarantee it will be my last.  \n\nOur server was excellent and knowledgable.  She was able to recommend a wine that met my criteria (I don't know Italian wines), and the bottle was $43.00 which was a bargain since it was $17.00 each by the glass.  The garbanzo bruschetta served compliments of the chef was very tasty.  \n\nWe opted for salads, secondis and sides.  While adding a primi would have been too much food, the secondi portions were very small.  \n\nBeet salad was beet salad.  Nothing exceptional. \n\nI ordered the lamb chops ($28.00) which didn't happen to be on the menu that night.  They serve the lamb with the fat still on the chop.  I liked the idea better than the execution.  The chops were supposed to be medium, they were more like medium well.  Unfortunately, that still didn't give the lamb fat an opportunity to crisp.  It was just too much fat too under cooked.  It would have been impossible to eat all that fat.  \n\nThe biggest let-down was the shortrib. ($32.00)  Absolutely tasteless. \n\nThe Quail was corn meal crusted, I didn't try it, my friend said it was good, but it was tiny and 3 hours later he was starving.\n\nSides: we got brussels sprouts ($9.00) which were hands down the best thing we ate.  They were really outstanding.  Brocolli with garlic and chili flakes.  Good, you know, nothing exceptional.\n\nThe service was SLOOOOOOOW.  We didn't have anywhere we needed to be but I was STARVING by the time the food finally came.  We finally ended up telling our server we needed to meet some friends and had to go.  \n\nIt just was not good enough.  Nothing memorable, nothing I need to go back for.  Do yourself a favor, and check out Keller's Bouchon instead.  THAT was a memorable meal."

            "review": "Our second visit to B&B was just as memorable as the first. The food was fantastic, and the staff were knowledgeable, friendly and attentive without being obtrusive. \n\nMy grilled octopus was tender and tasty, the beef cheek ravioli rich and satisfying and the calamari was fiery and succulent.\n\nMy only regret is that to order either of the tasting menus, the entire table must order one of the two tasting menus. This just isn't possible when eating with my wife, as she isn't quite as adventurous as I am, and there is almost always something on a tasting menu that doesn't interest her.\n\nWe will definitely be back, as there are many items on the menu that I still want to try, such as the rabbit porchetta."

            "review": "Mario's restaurants hold a special place in my heart since we went to Babbo after we got engaged!  Babbo was literally one of the best meals of my life, every single need was anticipated and dare I say it...everything was flawless from decor, to service, to the food.  Since Mario doesn't have any restaurants in Chicago I couldn't wait to try his Vegas offerings.  We had wine and appetizers at Carnevino, which we couldn't have been more impressed with, and then came here for dinner and dessert.  I was glad we we went to carnevino first for drinks because the bar here was essentially in the foyer and no one was there at all.  The tables were uncomfortably close together and that combined with the multitude of servers made dining there sort of weird, I felt like I was constantly interrupted and couldn't help but overhear everyone's conversations around us.  Our first course of goat cheese, fennel pollen and orange ravioli were amazing!  Next came the mint love letters which just couldn't have been any more disgusting.  My husband LOVES lamb and mint and they were so bad he had half a bite and couldn't get any more down.  We obviously didn't eat the rest of it and when our server came over and asked us what was wrong he immediately removed them and couldn't have been any nicer.  The manager came over next and apologized and offered to help, and then two glasses of prosecco arrived.  What could have been a dealbreaker for us turned into a moment that made us like B&B even more since they handled it so well.  Our dessert was amazing!  Overall, since Babbo was so amazing we had lofty expectations for this place that it didn't fulfill.  If I didn't go in expecting to be amazed though, I think I would have been much more satisfied with this solid restaurant."

I ordered the short ribs and my sister ordered the Cavatelli with lamb. My food had no flavor whatsoever. I was very disappointed.  My sisters portion was kids size and after tasting it I was very unhappy. It had no flavor either. The pasta was very dense and chewy. There is absolutely no way Mario Batali is hands on in this restaurant. It was horrible! I was very disappointed.  I will never go again. I passed up CUT and Aquaknox to give him a try.....never again. Way overpriced and below mediocre for me to return. If you are a foodie don't bother....waste of time and money. Oh, the food did the agree with me either. I just finished puking 3 times....ewwww yuck. Never again!"

The waitress took time to answer questions about the menu and to recommend wine pairings for various dishes. I had the grilled octopus appetizer, the pappardelle bolognese, and the brasato al barolo. The grilled octopus wasn't chewy at all, but surprisingly tender. The pappardelle bolognese was prepared with a thin tomato sauce, and the pappardelle had a slight chew. The brasato al barolo was a very small portion of delicious, tender beef.\n\nNotables: portion sizes are small compared to \"American-sized\" portions."

            "review": "Unimpressed... Had the grilled octopus, was heavy on the lemon. I will admit I thought the lamb tongue was delicious. Ordered the linguine with clam and hot pepper flakes, the pasta came out very undercooked to a point it was inedible cause it was crunchy and sticking to our teeth so we informed our waiter who said it was el dente... I grew up in an Italian neighborhood in NYC, it wasn't el dente, it was just hard and undercooked. We sent it back expecting it to be redone, instead we got our same plate back that was probably just thrown back in the water for a little longer, didn't expect that from a batali restaurant at all. For the main course, ordered the rabbit which was bland but ok. also ordered the Branzino which ended up having bones in it, luckily that was my bfs meal cause after the first bite with 4 bones stabbing my gums, I wouldn't have touched anymore of it on my plate. We ordered the balsamic mascarpone baciato as dessert and that was absolutely delicious. They did do a good job of giving me a candle for my birthday. Overall unimpressed and actually disappointed with Batali, but maybe it's cause I'm a NYC food snob. Either way, with the choices of food in Vegas, I probably would not entertain this place again."

            "review": "Wine Connoisseur would probably enjoy this restaurant.  Its \"fine dining\" label was something my friends and I have overlooked.  For their wines, I would rate it 4 stars as \"excellente\" but I'm giving it 2 stars becasue my el  stomaco wasn't quite satifacto. LOL..\n\nI didn't quite like their \"breadsticks.\"  They were really sticks like the pretzel sticks which was not appropriate for an upscale restaurant.  It feels \"cheap\" to wrap up tiny bread sticks in paper.  \n\nThe quantity of the entree is for feeding birds especially for the $$$ they charge & the quality of the entree.  $16-$25 isn't a lot for upscale restaurant but at least make me full.......\n\nI'm not trying to sound like a self-indulged Americanized customer, but I'd like to be able to SPOT MY FOOD on the big giant plate.  There doesn't have to be a plateful or bowl full of food but all we wanted was something enough to feed a PERSON instead of birds.\n\nFarallon, in San Francisco, serves tiny portion as well but the food they serve taste MORE DELICIOUS and REFINED than B&B Ristorante.\n\nBy the way, the waiters expect to receive large amount of tips.  They can be a little judgmental but they are not really bad people, just people who want money, and will give you dirty look if you don't look like a wealthy old couple who drink with your pinkies up."

            "review": "I have walked by the Venetian hallway of restaurants before. I was pretty excited to finally get to try one. And on top of that, we were going to try the restaurant associated to Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich. I had really high high high expectations, but was really really really disappointed.\n\nWe ordered:\n*Bone Marrow Ravioli with Osso Bucco Ragu $32. I believe the concept of wrapping pasta around bone marrow is both spectacular and a delicate process, however, the dish failed to wow me. The pasta was fresh and super al dente. When I ate it, I felt the texture of the bone marrow oozing out of its al dente shell, like a gusher candy, but the flavor was lacking. I guess bone marrow is better paired as a topping to compliment a dish rather to serve as the main content in a ravioli dish. \n\n*Spaghettini with Spicy Budding Chives, Sweet Garlic and One-Pound Lobster #32. The dish was sufficient. The lobster was there, but the spaghetti was yet again, too, al dente. We also started noticing the chef tending to give a heavy hand of salt for each dish. \n\n*Roast Pork Cheeks/Belly. Tasty, but a little too burnt as you can see in my picture. I know the place was dim and has romantic lighting, but it was a little too burnt to be acceptable. \n\n*lled Ribeye for Two with Roasted Potatoes and Aceto Manodori $120. After waiting 45 minutes for the dish to come, it was displayed to us over a cutting board as a one piece of steak. Then the waiter, took it aside, and sliced it into more management pieces and reorganized it onto a dish. The meat was cooked perfect for medium rare. However, it was apparent, too much salt. We were too lazy to complain because we couldn't wait another 45 minutes for a new one. We were so hungry. But it was truly disappointing. \n\nOverall, I was so super disappointed with B&B. I was really expecting top knotch food. The service was great, but the food was horrible. It will be hard for me to go back to any place with the name Batali or Bastianich associated to it. There are a lot of great restaurants in Vegas, unfortunately, B&B doesn't cut it on my list. I wouldn't give them a second chance."

            "review": "Before going to Las Vegas for my best friend's 21st birthday I asked around a bit for recommendations of restaurants to take him to. The typical suggestions were given (Michael Mina, Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, etc) but one name stood out in my mind; B and B Ristorante. I did my research on the place and found out that it's on the amazing list of Mario Batali owned restaurants. Perfect. The same friend and I just recently went to Manhattan for my college graduation and we ate at multiple Batali restaurants (Lupa and P\u00f3) which both blew us away. I've also dined at his Los Angeles restaurant, Pizzeria Mozza (next door to Osteria Mozza). Each and every time I've dined at a Batali owned restaurant my stomach has left extremely happy and my wallet isn't too hurt. B and B was a perfect choice to celebrate my friend's second birthday dinner.\n\nB and B is inside the very classy Venetian Hotel and is tucked on Restaurant Row. It's Friday night in Vegas so the casino floor is bumpin' and there are suits and cocktail dresses galore while walking to the restaurant. Thankfully we came prepared and were sporting our suits as well. After walking the million or so steps through the humongous hotel/casino we arrived in front of B and B and were happily greeted by the two gorgeous hostesses. We then were led to our seats against the \"window\" in a cozy half booth half table. Sitting by the window was great because the people watching outside couldn't be beat. Out of all the hotels we went to beforehand, the Venetian definitely had the most attractive, interesting, and fun-looking crowd.\n\nOur extremely professional server came over to greet us and take our drink orders. Right away we felt as if we had been teleported off the bustling Las Vegas Strip and into a fine dining restaurant tucked under a stoop in NYC. After looking over the menu we came to our decisions.\n\nTo start, we got one order of calamari and seppie fritti to share. This was probably the best calamari I've tasted in my life. The sauce at the bottom complimented the calamari perfectly by adding a slight spice to each bite but not enough to knock you out of your chair. We devoured the dish pretty quickly and then sat back to wait for our pastas.\n\nMy friend and I are big pasta lovers so we stuck to the Primi section of the menu. My friend ordered the spaghettini (with spicy budding chives, sweet garlic and one-pound lobster). The second my friend said his order our server got ecstatic. He said it was one of their best dishes and also one of their most popular. He then described in great detail exactly how it is prepared as well as how each ingredient compliments the next. Whoa. \"This guy knows his shit.\" For me, I got the goat cheese tortelloni (with dried orange and wild fennel pollen). Again, our pro-status server then described how it's cooked and how the ingredients would taste with each other. My friend's dish was amazing. It had a small kick of spice but the lobster helped even out the flavor. Also, the lobster was the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth lobster I've ever tasted. My dish was also fabulous. I'm sold immediately to any dish that is prepared with goat cheese and this dish didn't upset. The milky goat cheese gave an explosion of flavor with each bite and the tiny shavings of orange offered a different and interesting flavor every third bite or so.\n\nBefore our meal started I told our server very discretely that it was my friend's birthday. He said that if we order a dessert they will add a candle but they don't offer any special (by this I mean complimentary) birthday desserts. Hm, oh well. We ordered the dark chocolate torta (with spiced huckleberries). Sure enough, out came a candle and script writing on the side of the dish. It looked beautiful (as well as delicious). Needless to say, we devoured this thing pretty damn quick as well.\n\nBeing familiar with Mario Batali's cooking we both came in knowing exactly what to expect; an amazing meal. We both left very satisfied. We then proudly and excitedly crossed yet another Batali restaurant off our list."

Wine was a nice barbaresco. \nExecution, presentation and see rice were 5 stars.\nSo....

            "review": "The restaurant is located in Restaurant Row between the Venetian and Palazzo.  We originally have a small reservation but the group kept growing and they were very accommodating with adding more to our party.\n\nThey offer both tasting menus and pre fixed menus (discounted to $55 if you're staying at the Venetian or Palazzo and have a coupon book) that are done in a reasonable amount of time (~1 hr) if you have a show to catch or something.  I opted to just try some of the food a la carte and was pretty happy with my meal.  I ended up getting the bone marrow ravioli and the broccoli which both combined was just over $40 (not including tax and tip).  They originally brought out the wrong side and gave us potatoes, but let us keep the tables on the house and gave me my broccoli shortly afterwards.  However, by then, I had already finished my entree so by itself it was a little salty.  I thought the bone marrow ravioli was seasoned well and the pasta was cooked al dente to my liking, but it wasn't mind-blowingly-good in my opinion.  Other dishes on the table were the beet salad, gnocchi, and spaghetti with lobster.  Tried a little of those and they were all tasty as well, but once again, not blown out of the water.  A few people got affogatos at the end of the meal (with a twist - with chocolate gelato instead of vanilla) and after we had paid our bill, the waiter was so kind to give us a dessert sampler which I found phenomenal.  Notable favorites were the chocolate flourless cake and the biscotti."

You're kidding right?\nPretentious menu with little translation - I almost felt like I was bothering the waiter by asking but I seriously had no idea what 80% of the menu said - I'm not an idiot either, I can usually figure it out but here I was clueless.\nLengthy wait time for food - ok I know B&B is supposed to be a traditional Italian style meal with a leisurely pace but the wait was excessive.\nVery dark! It was like sensory deprivation and I didn't like that.\n\nPros:\nPerfectly cooked pork chop - exactly how I asked for it (\"not pink\" despite the dirty look I got from the waiter for the request), was probably one of the most delicious pieces of meat I have ever had.\nReally excellent flavor pairings - they obviously hone their combinations to perfection here, the food love is apparent.\n\nDunno if the pros outweigh the cons but I probably wouldn't make a return trip here.

Was there with a party of 4 and tried 2 Atipasti, 3 Primi, 2 Secondi and one desert.  Here we go:\nChic pea brushcetta--got this complements of the restaurant.  Did not care for it, tasted weird to me.\nBread--It was not good at all, don't even try it.\nAntipasti\nTomato fresh mozzarella (can't remember the fancy name) was good, a bit salty.  Tomatoes were sweet and fresh, good combination of flavors.\nCrispy Pork Trotter --awesome, great combination.  Loved it!\nPrimi\nSpaghettini with lobster --I did not like this dish, it was ok, would not order again.  For me it was weird and did not work very well.\nGoat Cheese Tortelloni--this was a hit, pasta was good and it was a great combination with the rich taste of the goat cheese. Portion was small, but I think is because the assumption is that you would get a secondi, so that makes sense.  \nBucatini all Amatriciana--amazing!  It was so good, I wanted more.  It is perfectly spicy and the bacon was just outstanding. \nSecondi\nLamb for two--it was great.  Cooked to perfection, tender and juicy.  Our came with roasted peppers.  I wish they would warn you that some of the pepers are hot, like really hot.  I took a big bite of the green one and omg, fire in my mouth.  Although the waiters were on top of our table all night long, they could not keep up with how much water I was drinking to put off the fire in my month....\nVeal Chop--I did not try this dish, but the people who eat it said it was great.  I would add it looked just like the picture on their web site, really good.\nDolci\nDark Chocolate torta--it was not good and so small.  The waiter recommended a cherry wine to go with it instead of the rum as suggested in the menu.  The wine was a winner, great! \nWe also had red wine, not sure which one it was as I did not select it, but it was outstanding.\nOverall it was a good experience.  Like some of the other reviews, it is difficult for me to assign an overall review because some of the dishes were amazing and some I did not care for.  Overall, I would give it 3.5 stars.  I am rounding down because of how expensive everything was.  Dinner for 4 about $700 with tip and we actually shared a lot of the food... \nI was told the music we were listening came from Mario Batali's ipod.  Not sure if that is true, but I thought it was cool and different"

I highly recommend."

That said, we started with salads which were again \"just good\", I had the Homemade Orecchiette with spicy lamb and rapini and the flavor was \"just good\" but nothing to make me think it was outstanding, which is what I expected given that my husband and I are huge fans of both Chef's.  \n\nThe Italian wine selection is well thought through, we had a nice bottle of wine from Piedmont. I would say that considering we have lived in Italy for four years the wine selection way, way over priced, we brought back several to include 95/97/99 Bondi Santi Reserve and did not pay a fraction of what we saw on the menu....just saying...."

This was unbearable at times.\n\nWe were seated by our hostess in a semi-private room and a few minutes later our waiter arrived and delivered his opening spiel about the restaurant. Drink service was offered and extended with the best Negroni I've had since Harry's Bar in New York City. \n\nOther drinks included Prosecco by the glass, Bellini's made with fresh white peach pure and a variety of Bastianich signature wines, many of them available by the \"quartino.\"\n\nANTIPASTI:\n\nMarinated fresh anchovies, warm tripe \"alla Parmigiana,\" grilled octopus, three goat-cheese truffles, warm lamb's tongue, cauliflower sfromato, vegetable \"Frito Misto,\" baby red oak leaf, roasted beet salad, prosciutto San Daniele \"Riserva,\" \"Carciofi alla romana,\" steamed clams, calamari and \"Seppie Fritti.\"\n\nThe grilled octopus with spicy limoncello vinaigrette was divine. Not only was the dish simple, but the octopus was grilled spot on. The flesh was so tender, yet full of texture that no knife was needed to cut off a piece. A quick flick of the fork was sufficient.\n\nWarm tripe \"alla Parmigiana\" was delightfully soft and tender with a bit spicy marinara sauce. Once you get over the fiery overlay of the potent dose of pepper, smooth and sweet tomato sauce envelopes beneath it. \n\nRoasted beet salad, although extremely tiny, had the perfect balance of tanginess and sweetness. Steamed clams Amalfi coast-style turned out to have too much heat in the broth. Warm lamb's tongue with chanterelles and a three-minute egg was declared to be the best dish of the evening. The lamb was very succulent, with the mushrooms lending an earthy flavor and heavenly texture to the dish.\n\nPRIMI:\n\nThe beef cheek raviolis were shaped like triangular envelopes, filled with a slightly grainy pure of beef cheeks and duck liver. The black truffles were, unfortunately, devoid of flavor, but otherwise the dish was tasty and fragrant. \n\nSilky, yet light, airy and moist gnocchi were assaulted with an overly salty and way too heavy reduced braised oxtail that dried the sauce out.\n\nThe stinging nettle pappardelle was a spectacular dish, rich and extremely well balanced, with the nettle providing a nice counterpoint to the boar's earthy flavor.\n\nSpaghettini with spicy budding chives, sweet garlic and one-pound lobster was another good choice.\n\nSweet potato \"Lune\" with sage and amaretti was an exceptionally savory dish, even before the amaretti cookie was grated over the lunes (round raviolis). Sweet potatoes and sage is an excellent pairing and fared very well.\n\nSECONDI:\n\nSweetbreads dusted with fennel pollen and prepared sweet and sour, made with membrillo (quince paste) vinegar, was superb. \n\nLamb chops \"Scottadita\" with eggplant and lemon yogurt were seared to perfection.\n\nSpicy two-minute calamari Sicilian lifeguard-style is Mario's conception. It's a simple and robust dish that was unbelievably delicious.\n\nBranzino is brought out whole and filleted tableside. But I chose to do it myself. Charred on the outside and slightly overcooked on the inside, a drizzle of olive oil would have been sufficient, but was not offered by our server or staff. It seems olive oil is very difficult to get at B&B Ristorante. Only after twice requesting the precious liquid gold, was I given a tiny amount on a community plate, where bread-dipping privileges had to be shared with my entire dining party. Martha Stewart would not have been pleased about the double dipping.\n\nDOLCIE E FORMAGGI:\n\nCinnamon spiced-sheep's milk ricotta Bombolino's essentially doughnut holes that are served with a rich, warm, amedei gianduia chocolate sauce, which was too thick for my taste, slightly thinner would have been better. Another favorite dessert was the vanilla bean Semifreddo with strawberry-rhubarb marmallata and vanilla syrup. gelati and sorbetti are all homemade. A variety of Italian cheeses is available.\n\nB&B Ristorante does very good European dining in a polite, yet overly casual environment, allowing a diner to enjoy real Italian cuisine without feeling uptight; but it is a little overwhelming with the choice of rock and roll dinner music. \n\nOliver Kern was trained in Vienna, Austria, specializing exclusively in the European culinary arts and has worked in some of the finest dining establishments throughout Europe and the United States.\n\nFor the entire review of B&B Ristorante please visit www.freshfoodnews.com"

We had the salumi plate to share.  The salumi were house-made, which was nice.  Not much a fan of the head cheese (I don't like aspic-y jello-like consistencies), but the rest were lovely, if not overly-spiced like mass-produced Salumi are (Batali's dad at Fra'mani does it a bit better, but these were nice).  The pickled olives, onions, and radishes were a lovely touch.\n\nWe had the pasta bolognese and the lobster spaghetti.  My bolognese was wonderful.  The pasts was VERY fresh, and the flavor was good, even if the portion wasn't very big.\n\nThe lobster pasta was just GREAT  There was quite a lot of lobster in it, the flavor was nice, but not so overpowering that you couldn't taste the sweetness of the lobster.  The pasta was lovely, and the garlic chives on it tasted like they'd just come out of the garden.  Simple, clean, EXTREMELY fresh, and good flavors.  Very nice, I just might've wanted to take some leftovers home. But alas, there weren't any.  I suppose that speaks well for the place.  I'm always a little skeptical of restaurants by big name celebrity chefs, but this was great, if not stunning."

First, it was a larger group, second there were two and then a few more potentially buzzed/intoxicated members of the party and three we were all really tired from traveling all day and setting up for a trade show.  OK preface done!\n\nNot being a frequent visitor to the Las Vegas area, honestly its just too much for a simpleton like myself, when I am there it is generally for business and/or trade shows.  I got a call from one of my friends to meet up with her and have some dinner at this great restaurant at the Venetian, B&B.  Learning that it was one of Mario Bitali's restaurants and a fan of Italian wine (oh yeah BTW I am a wine maker) I was quite excited!!\n\nWe get there, table is not ready nor are all of our party so we head to the bar.  Drinks ordered .... Negroni consumed.  Probably the best Negroni I have ever had!  Tick tock, still waiting for the rest of our party.  Now with most everyone here they seat us.  Realizing that they did not have enough seats at the table we informed the waitstaff.  Once the balance of our party arrived at the table still without the needed seating the manager came over rather gruff and threw up his arms and walked away muttering not so sweet nothings under his breath.  But I do need to qualify that statement by saying that are late companions were feeling the side effects of drinking Vodka Tonics.  \n\nWe order the wine, sans any real help the Sommelier other than \"yeah were are out of that one but if you like Barbera there are more on page so-and-so\".  Gee thanks guy.  \n\nOur waiter was a bubbly guy who reminded me more of a mad scientist from an old western movie with his big moustache and insane enthusiasm for his job and food.  He takes the orders and assists where he can.  Being sure to compliment us on our orders (I dont understand that move) and briskly rushes back to the waiter cave and put the orders in the hopper.\n\nTick tock, tick tock waiting for apps to arrive.  Tick tock.  I know that the Molto Mario Empire want the world to experience the way that Italy eats but when you are with a group with some members who are more the burger king crowd one would think that the staff would adjust their schedules to turn the table.  Oh well.\n\nApps arrive, good - not great - good.  One not so good dish but our enthusiastic waiter fixed the situation.  \n\nWine is running low ....... Mr Sommelier where are you.  Oh there you are, gliding in and out of the room looking down your nose at all the tables.  Um we would like our wine now please.  But you keep walking by ignoring us.  Sure we are a big group, sure we are talking and having a good time but no need to ignore us. Hey man not all of the public are ignorant.  Oh yeah I also like how you take two oz pours to check for tainting.  I wonder how the person buying the $1400.00 Super Tuscan feels when they see you taking $80 out of their bottle?\n\nSo before we could contain our now intoxicated friend walks to the wine station grabs our bottles and briskly brings them to the table.  Now everyone on staff is aghast with jaws on the floor and the look of \"I cant believe that fat guy just did that\" written all over their faces.  Oh bother, great now we are going to have issues.  Surprisingly no one said anything, the waiter simply brought a bottle trivet over to protect the already stained table.\n\nTick tock, tick tock.  Secondi would be nice.  Ah there is our enthusiastic waiter again, lets ask him.  \"They are plating them right now\"!  Yippie!!!  Plates arrive.  Again good - not great - good.  Steaks are chewy and medium rare became very rare somehow and the polenta crusted sweet breads were interesting to say the least.  Something about raw polenta and cooked polenta as a crust for sweet breads does not work for me.  Maybe I dont get it?  \n\nExhausted with the evening we decide to skip dessert and just get the heck out of dodge.\n\nAll in all the dining experience was OK.  Perhaps a smaller crowd, perhaps a more refined crowd, perhaps a less intoxicated crowd?  Either way, its Vegas!  People drink and there are large crowds.  Maybe, as I stated earlier, the staff should recognize when they should rush a table out and not stick to the corporate dining model?  \n\nTo the waiter and the water/bread waitress .... you are saints for dealing with certain elements of our table.  To the management , relax.   To Mr Sommelier, people skills go a long way and maybe it is time to not take yourself so seriously.\n\nWould I be back ..... maybe but keep it small and simple and dont come with high expectations."

The service was the best I've experienced, the atmosphere was dark yet intimate, but the food was only average. B&B is known to serve more rustic Italian foods than the other Batali restaurants. Some of the \"interesting\" menu items are lamb's tongue, lamb's brain, and beef cheek ravioli.\n\nI had an ice tea accompanied by the best beverage service. They brought an empty glass with ice and a slice of lemon, a stirring rod, a tumbler with my ice tea, and simple syrup. I helped myself to the perfect blend of ice tea, ice, and syrup and enjoyed the complimentary chick pea with olive on crostini. \n\nWe ordered Calamari and Seppie (part of the octopus family) Fritti. The calamari was lighter than the usual that you find elsewhere. The marinara sauce tasted like it was freshly made from tomatoes and was the perfect dipping sauce for the calamari. Of course, you have to squeeze the lemon on the side to give the calamari a lighter and more refreshing taste. \n\nFor the main course, I ordered the grilled lamb chops with mint sauce. The eight pieces of lamb that I got were cooked just right but were way too salty. Given that I'm not a big fan of heavily flavored foods and always opt for the natural and original taste, the lamb would probably be salty for the average food connoisseur. I talked to the manager of the restaurant and he told me that Mario's signature style is to soak all meats in salt brine prior to cooking which brings out the tenderness of the meat. Thus, if you are like me, try the pasta instead. The manager told me that the pasta is also soaked in the salt brine but later soaked in water to enhance its texture. \n\nWe finished off our meal with a  today's dessert special of blueberry fruit tart and lemon mascarpone. It was very tiny for $14 but it was good. \n\nI like Mario's other restaurants a lot better than this one but I still look forward to visit Babbo when I travel to NYC next time. I'll try to make a reservation months in advance this time!"

The atmosphere is cool, relaxed and kind of chic, but the casino is in sight so that can ruin it. The 7 course pasta tasting menu was amazing. Very different pastas, very different sauces, and the desserts were great (beware-the final one--budino I believe--is very hot.). The cheek ravioli was absolutely amazing. My only complaint was that the balsamic brown sauce tastes a lot like balsamic, maybe a little overpowering, however the final taste you taste is the smooth meat inside. This could be a very pricey meal, but definitely well worth it."

Ok, the service was attentive and helpful, but the food (except for the Limoncello Octopus appetizer) was awful. We were six people, and not a single entr\u00e9e was satisfactory. Mario, Please remove your B from he name as soon as possible! I had the Linguine w.Clams, and it was like biting into a block of salt. The Linguini were actually Spaghetti. Obviously they fried some Pancetta, added some Garlic and  clams, then fried the al dente pasta in that pan which dried out and hardened the noodles and clams. Then drenched the whole thing in olive oil! No broth at all! I had better pasta in some cafeterias...\nI normally don't mind spending $ 750 on a dinner for six, but if I wanted this kind of food I could have gone to Olive Garden and spend a fraction of that money"

This was the only restaurant I did not look up at all before visiting Vegas, and I can say my co worker and I were disappointed.\n\nThe complimentary chickpea bruschetta was nothing to write home about - it was okay, but a bit salty. Glad I did not choose it, personally.\n\nWe both chose to eat light then order more if we felt we needed it. Our waiter praised the bone marrow ravioli with osso bucco ragu. We tried it. On top of being like eating a tough lemon and parsley gusher, the meat was extremely fatty and just tasted like bad pulled pork, to a point I almost thought they pulled some pork and served it, knowing no one would notice in the dim light. My co worker got the same meal, and the look on her face when she bit into the ravioli was just utter disappointment. We chose not to get any wine or dessert since the meal was so disappointing, but some complimentary dessert was brought out anyway. The chocolate covered cherry, which tasted like the cranberry raisinets, was the best thing. The chocolate cake was dry and bland, the biscotti was meh, and I have had better meringue bought at the grocery store, sadly. And I do not love grocery store meringue cookies or anything. \n\nI left shunning the restaurant and Mario Batali. Then I woke up in the middle of the night with terrible food poisoning before a 6 am flight. So yeah. I would definitely suggest you go elsewhere."

Each time water was refilled, they would cover the lip of the glass with napkin to keep the water from splashing onto you. I thought the tables were a little close to each other, but whatever.\n\nOn to the food:\n\nOctopus - I couldn't taste the octopus. All I tasted was salty carbon because the meat was so burnt and they used so much salt. I mentioned this to the waiter and he said that's the way it is supposed to be. I was thinking that it is too bad it is supposed to suck. He graciously offered to take it back and bring something else. He recommended:\n\nCheese custard with shitake mushrooms - This one was a winner, had they not sprinkled coarse salt at the bottom of the dish. The dish didn't need any salt! Nonetheless, the custard was outstanding. This was the only remarkable dish.\n\nSome fried pork patty with salad - Whose idea was it to grind up some pork and fry it into a patty? The presentation was poor and it was soaked through with oil. We thought that the dish might be redeemed through its flavor, but alas, it was no good.\n\nOxtail with pasta (the one on their tasting menu) - The best part of this dish was the pasta. It was well cooked and springy. The oxtail was plain. The way they were cut into little cubes reminded me of dog food. \n\nQuail - The quail was perfectly cooked, slightly rare and delicious. The presentation was good on this one. Then, they ruin it by adding this small red pasta at the bottom of the dish with a very salty sauce. Why?\n\nThe food was bad for $100+/person. I've lost a lot of respect for Mario."

It's too bad there wasn't a better, more prominent spot that was easy to get to in the Venetian.  Compared to, say, SW or Andrea's, Costa Di Mare, Sinatra or some other very nice restaurants located within Wynn/Encore where you can easily find the restaurant and you do t feel like it's a mall environment, B&B did, and therefore the 1 star reduction.

He redeemed himself during the evening, but it wasn't exactly an auspicious start.  \n\nAlthough the lighting was dim, this is not the place for a romantic evening.

After my horrible experience at their New York restaurant, I had no intentions of ever patronizing another one of their restaurants again. However, the wife really wanted to give them a second chance and asked me to accompany her to their Las Vegas restaurant.\n\nI agree with a lot of the other negative reviews below. The food at B&B is way too salty. I had their lamb's tongue which was so salty it took three pieces of bread in order for me to finish the appetizer. Oh and could it have killed them to serve the bread warm like all the other fine dining restaurants, instead of the semi stale cold bread they had?\n\nThen, I had the squid ink pasta. Again, and as other reviewers have commented too, it was extremely salty. Also nowhere on the menu did it say it was going to spicey. It was so hot that I was only able to finish half the plate with 2 cups of ice water, and sent the rest back to the kitchen.\n\nFinally, I had the rabbit. It was overcooked and dry. And surprisingly, it was bland, contrary to the previous two dishes! It came with 5 medallions of meat, but after the first 2, it was unbearable and I sent the rest back. I rather waste the money than have any more of their food go into my mouth.\n\nI don't know what's going on with their kitchen but the food here is generally very salty, and inconsistent and not worth the $200 I spent. I wouldn't pay $20 for the food they served.\n\nTheir only redeeming factor was the excellent service and ambiance, in contrast to their restaurant Babbo in New York. However, when I go to a restaurant, the first and foremost importance is the taste of the food. If that fails, nothing else really matters.\n\nI do not recommend this restaurant, nor do I recommend any restaurants of Batali & Bastianich after my horrible experiences at their restaurants in different states at different times of the year."

On July 3rd, everyone in the group seemed to have individual plans and my husband had been wanting to try out B&B Ristorante since he is a fan of Mario Batali. I'm not a big fan of Italian food so I checked out the menu before going and decided I would be having steak instead of pasta for my dinner. Upon arrival, the service was attentive and timely. We were seated and the waiter was very helpful in explaining the various dishes as we were not well-versed in Italian food. When I told the waiter I would like steak for dinner he pointed out the grilled ribeye for two ($120). He then let us know they ran out of their regular ribeye so we were in for a special surprise. Since they had run out of their normal ribeye, they were serving a 6 MONTH dry-aged special reserve ribeye from Carnevino for the same price. Normally, this steak would cost over $200! We were completely caught off guard and couldn't be more delighted. So for the appetizer we decided to order the grilled octopus and it was really good. It didn't have the rubbery chewy texture but was actually juicy and tender like eating a seafood steak. For the next course we ordered the beef cheek ravioli upon recommendation from our waiter. It was ok, nothing spectacular, kind of like eating beef pate inside of a ravioli. I wish I had ordered the bone marrow ravioli instead, next time! So then our waiter comes out with our main entree, the glorious huge 27 oz (with bone) ribeye on a wooden plank. He presents to us the meat before slicing it into strips for us. He arranges the strips of steak on the plate with potatoes and some other stuff I ignored and then drizzled some beautiful balsamic and olive oil on top. I've never had steak like this but it was the best steak I have ever tasted hands down. It was like eating the most tender juicy filet but had the bold fatty flavor of a ribeye. The balsamic and olive oil combined with the steak was the most amazing combination of salty and tangy with a subtle sweetness. I was really sad I couldn't finish it so I had to take the leftovers back to the hotel. Later that night after partying at Marquee, I went back to the hotel and ate the leftover cold steak. Even cold, I'd rather have that steak than any other steak cooked, HA! I know we got lucky this time with that steak and sadly I'm not sure if it's something that is readily available or even on the menu at B&B Ristorante or Carnevino. It's bittersweet to eat such an amazing steak because from then every single other steak has to be compared to it and will ultimately pale in comparison. Next time we head back to Las Vegas I will hunt down that steak and pay whatever they ask because I know it will be worth it."

The peas looked beautiful in size and with a brilliant bright green color, but had absolutely no flavor.  Nothing special about the Burrata, comparable to something I would buy at Trader Joe's.  Oh, yes, and the mint..there was one mint leaf as garnish. Blah.\n\nMy husband had the Beef Raviolis (I think it was short rib filled).  I took one look at them, and first off, thought it was one of the most unappealing plates of pasta I had ever seen.  No presentation at all.  Took one bite and they tasted every bit as bland/blah as they looked.  Not only were they blah, they were lukewarm, and the filling was dry and very salty.  \n\nI chose the Beef Short Rib on polenta.   It's hard to really mess up braised short ribs, so it was okay, but the polenta tasted like something you would serve a baby as one of there first foods. No salt, no flavor of any kind.  I've made short ribs that were much more memorable than what was served to me in a restaurant owned by a world renowned chef.  \n\nI have a few of Batalli's cookbooks, and have made some of my favorite meals out of them.

UGH... really.... food now and no wine..\n\nThe food however, was really nice, the apps were great, loved the beef cheek ravioli, and the goat cheese tortelloni was - uh wait, it didn't arrive, cuz the great server we had FORGOT IT. My wife really just wanted to eat a couple of apps, and now her meal was well.. gone poof...\n\nUh, Mr Manager... yes sir, we're terribly sorry, we'll get it out for you... \n\n$55 Veal chop arrives but not the side... hello? Mr Manager... oh the med rare veal chop was well... rare at best, but I was tired of complaining...\n\nTHey comped much of the meal and apologized profusely"

When we arrived here we talked to the waitress, and she said she could ask the chef to see if he could do the tasting menu vegetarian do my wife. He agreed. When I mentioned the vegetarian tasting menu to the sommelier, he said he could talk to the chef and pair wines for each dish for my wife. \nThe food was fantastic and the wine pairings gave me a new appreciation for the art of the sommelier. This was the best meal I have ever had, and the way the staff went the extra mile made this a truly wonderful experience."

Although it looks classy and the wait staff are professional and friendly just this side of reserved, the food is just not that good.  We ordered the pasta sampler which was $99 per person and expected to be amazed.  Sadly, we were so underwhelmed that we barely made it through three courses.  The staff were very gracious and let us order something else, but when you are charging $99 for pasta, it had better deliver.  Instead, it was pretty bland and one course tasted like someone had popped open a can of Dinty Moore beef stew and mixed it with a too al dente pasta.  Soooo disappointed, and cannot recommend this place.  Walk down the block to Caesar's Palace and go to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill."

B and B was not only not good, it was overpriced too boot! I don't think there is a foodie out there that does not mind spending any amount typically as long as the entrees are well prepared. Here is the breakdown of my meal so you can compare:\n\nANTIPASTI:\n\nBeet Salad: One of the better dishes. The marinate had a touch to much vinegar. The pistachio with the beats was excellent however!\n\nWarm Lamb's Tongue: Really bad. I love lamb. Almost every part. Haji Baba in Arizona does wonderfull lambs tongue for $6.00. Haji blew away B & B on every note. The tongue was sliced so thin it was almost unrecognizable. The Chanterelles had very little flavor. A poor dish.\n\nGrilled Octopus: While every flavor hit, it would have been nice if the octopus was cooked properly. The Octopus was dry and fibrous.\n\nPRIMI:\n\nBeef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver: I LOVE fresh pasta. It should be cooked properly. Al Dente it was not. It actually was hard, absolutely undrcooked! The Beef Cheek was lacking creaminess. The crushed duck liver was not crushed duck liver? It was pureed tpgether with an overly salty beef stock. No earthy chocolate notes from the black truffle was present.\n\nBone Marrow Ravioli with Osso Buco Rag\u00f9: The worst dish of the evening. I'm a Bone Marrow aficionado and this was DISGUSTING! What was inside the undercooked Ravioli was BONE MARROW FLAVORED OIL. The Ravioli was like a Gushers fruit snack. Hard and chewy outside with an disgusting burst of oil inside. TERRIBLE. I actually told the waitress how bad it was and I my comment was dismissed instantly. Basically our waitress turned my statement into a MY PROBLEM, not hers or the restaurants! I had every Ravioli on my plate minus two and she did not offer a replacement or to remove from our bill. The Osso Buco was not Ragu. The Osso Buco was minimal in size, with large anounts of chewy, unrendered fat.\n\nSpaghettini with Garlic Chives, Sweet Garlic and One-Pound Lobster: The pasta was toothesome and cooked perfectly on ONE order of this dish. The other again was undercooked. The Lobster was not sweet, although plentifull. Some was translucent and inedible. The sauce was simple, not a lot going on HOWEVER, I did really like the natural subtle flavors and freshness of this sauce.\n\nWe were all very dissapointed! Skipping dessert was a first for me but we did indeed skip. Man, what a fucking let down. Really bummed out! As far as the movie review, it sucked. It sucked worse than Glitter!!"

Suffice to say, I am not a huge fan of the town, but am certainly excited by the number of restaurants renowned chefs have put their name behind.  I was particularly intrigued by this as not only does this bring Molto Mario to the table, but also brings Lydia Bastianich's son's influence.  Lydia, for those that don't know, is the quintessential Italian Nonna, and was a celebrity chef (PBS channel) before Food TV made a brand out of their chefs!\n\nThe menu did not disappoint -- the bold, rustic, real Italian offerings you would expect from Mario.  Everyone at our table was quite happy with a range of options -- roasted beet salad, prosciutto to start.  We opted to share a couple pastas so we could all taste pasta while ordering the temptations for the secondi section.  WOW!  We has the mint love letters pasta -- a bright fresh green pea and mint pesto filled ravioli envelope with a rich, spicy lamb sausage sauce. Such great combinations of flavors, and the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. We also had the beef cheek ravioli with black truffle and crushed duck liver.   Yum.  Warm, rich, earthy flavors.  (in fact, this is a good dish to share as the richness may be too much for a solo dish.) I thoroughly enjoyed the short rib dish - brasato al barolo.  Tender meat braised with a barolo reduction; rich and heavenly! Others at the table enjoyed the calamari, the sweetbreads (yes, really!), the rabbit, and the branzino (a white fish).\n\nAll in all, glad to have tried a higher end Batali joint, and will continue to do so!  He really has such great insight to real italian food. The ambiance, however, was lacking a bit for me.  It is partially open to the brightly lit 'mall' so it does not reflect the rustic charm that it really could be, particularly given the price.\n\nService brought this from four to a three.  Waitress did not like the notion that rather than her suggestion of ordering three pastas to share, we only ordered two.  Oh, and when she was starting to go over the specials and detail out some of the dishes we were interested in, she departed suddenly with some sort of grunt to assist another table, coming back to us a bit later. Oh, and very unhappy we did not order desserts/coffee.  (We were stuffed! This is big food! - maybe not huge portions, but hearty, heavy, happy belly food!) Seemed very put out with some of our questions on the menu, and yet seemed to be very serious when she indicated we could top above the built in 20% they added since we were a party of six. Um,... no!"

            "review": "The one thing that I can't tolerate about restaurants that charge more than $40 per entree is BAD SERVICE.\n\nWe waited an hour before our server, let's call her \"B\", came back so that we could order drinks.  She never came back to ask us how our entrees were.  And we never received any of the complimentary sweets that everyone on Yelp has raved about.  All of this would have been fine except that we left her a \"mandatory\" $80+ tip. I think that the bad service on our server's part can be partially attributed to automatic tip and partially because we came towards the end of the night.  \n\nRealizing that servers and busboys make most of their livelihood from tips, we decided pay the 20% tip and not punish the busboys, who were very prompt and polite, never letting our water glasses go below half empty.  I did go talk to the manager to let him know that the service at his restaurant was less than perfect.   When I did, he shrugged and said, \"Thanks for telling us.\"  He didn't offer us any kind of compensation OR even note which table we were sitting at and who our server was.  With management like that, it is no wonder that the so many people have criticized the service as lackluster.\n\nThe food was pretty good--the pappardelle bolognese was delicious, but the pasta was a little too al dente, and the veal chop was juicy, flavorful, and all-around amazing.  The gnocchi tasted like an overly firm polenta.  \n\nOverall, I think the food is pretty good, but I would tell people not to go to B&B because of the bad service."

We were very much looking forward to it, until I started reading the Yelp reviews.  We had pretty much decided against it, until we just said, screw it, let's go.  So happy we did.  We both got the Pasta Tasting Menu of Mario's Classics with the wine pairing.  It was incredible.  Our waiter took the time to explain the wine and dishes with absolute care.  The meal was paced exceedingly well, and when there was a bit of a lull, our waiter was sure to see if we needed anything and often refilled our wine glasses.  This was the best meal of each of our lives.  Every course was fantastic - Jose's Pyramids and the gnocchi with oxtail sauce our favorites.  And that is not to say that the Riccotta with Asparagus was lacking or the delicate balanced taste of the Lamb's brains ravioli.  I ate brains, and I loved it.  The desert of the Fried Date was simply fantastic, and the other equally as good.  \n\nThe setting was very nice, and although I was expecting Led Zeppelin to be blasting, it was not (which kinda disappointed my husband).  The staff was very attentive, and I can't believe that the service has been complained about.  \n\nAll in all, very happy I did not listen to the previous reviews - maybe yelp has become more of a place to complain than praise.  But I am praising B&B Ristorante, and I hope that the negative reviews below do not dissuade you from what could potentially be the best meal of your life, as was the case with me and my husband.  \n\nThanks B&B."

The waiters take their time to explain the nuances in the menu, and also to explain Chef Batali's philoshophy on different menu items.\n\nThe bellinis are absolutely to die for. The peach nectar is alwasy at the peak of freshness, and I honestly have never had a better bellini. Anywhere.\n\nWe always get a bottle of Kerner, and start with a few pastas. My absolute favorite in the papardelle bolognese. Everything is made from scratch, and the bolognese is creamy and rich without feeling too heavy. The mint love letters and black spaghetti are two of their best sellers, and neither will disappoint.\n\nThe last time I was here, I branched out and tried the quail. The mascarpone polenta was out-of-this world, and our waiter did not let me down when he raved about this dish. I love the branzino; it's always an excellent choice, and my friend raves about all of the beef dishes, especially the short ribs. I have never had a sub-par here. Never.\n\nThe thing I love about Vegas is that sub-par restaurants simply don't make it (in general). There are so many food options, and the competition in such a small radius makes it quite difficult for mediocre restuarants to be successful.\n\nWe're generally too stuffed at this point to do dessert, but I'm sure the desserts are fabulous as well. Now I am craving B&B for my next trip to Vegas! I should look at flights right now."

The hostess is very nice and pretty too :) I gave them 4 stars because we were seated in a very tiny area where people sits very close to each other.

They were very nice to asked us if we wanted to have it fillet. The fish has lots of bones so its a good idea to have it fillet. It was very good too.

But me and my buddy really enjoyed it.  It's the only reason why I gave this place 2 stars instead of one.\n\nMy main course just stunk!  It was homemade orecchiette with sausage and broccolni.  It tasted like Ragu from a jar!!  After that dish we decided to skip dessert.  We even skipped coffee.  Never ever again.  There are much better places to spend your money."

From start to finish we had such a great overall experience. Our server made it extra special. Now, I started to overlook the other reviews and I noticed people said the servers were pretentious. I could see why people would think that. I'm reality the servers are just very passionate about their food and restaurant which I love and appreciate. Onto the food.\n\nGrilled octopus: I hate octopus until now. It was so tender that it melted in mouth. It was amazing!\n\nSardines: absolutely tangy and fresh \n\nFoie gras ravioli: delicious  \n\nAll their pasta dishes are perplexed and differ on everyone's taste buds"

I booked a reservation for six online just one day in advance for a Monday night.   The hostess greeted us and sat us immediately.  The waiter came by quickly greeted us and then sent over the sommelier.  The staff was very knowledgeable about each of the dishes and our waiters recommendations were perfect.  We did quite a bit of sampling but some of the highlights for the antipasti would be the grilled octopus, the caramelized fig salad and the caprese salad.  As for the primi and secondi I recommend the beef cheek ravioli, gnocchi with lamb ragu and mint and the short rib.\n\nThe bottom line...as someone who frequently travels North America and dines out regularly, this restaurant is easily in my top 5 and has made its way into my list of restaurants I must go to on all future Las Vegas trips.  I highly recommend it."

I was in town for a business meeting and was given the obligation to select a restaurant. I have always heard great things about the  Batali restaurants and thought this would be a great place to take clients and potential business. UNTIL, we sat for two hours waiting to be served, while their entire staff stood at the hostess stand conversing. After a potential client we have been working on for years suggested he would say his goodbyes and go have dinner with another group, I knew I had to share the experience. \n\nFYI.... We sat done for dinner at 8:45 and were served after numerous complaints at 11:02. We were also the only people in the restaurant, so they may still have a few good reviews and the food was good. But there had to be some underlined reason why no one else was in there."

We loved Mario Batali's Del Posto in NYC so decided that B&B it is.  We had a great trip in Vegas so far, eating at places like Raku, Michael Mina's, Bouchon, and Public House.. all of which were good, not great.  B&B is the only restaurant I decided to yelp due to the fact that it was our best eating experience in Vegas because of our bartender that night - Eric. First off, the manhattans were the best we have ever had.  Eric's hobby is to make bitters.. who does that?! But the guy is serious about his drinks and it shows.  The manhattans were perfectly balanced and just damn delicious. Secondly, Eric recommended a few items for us to order.  The food was unique, rich, to die for!  Must haves on the food menu - octopus appetizer, bone marrow ravioli, beef cheek ravioli. DO NOT SIT AT THE TABLE if you go to B&B.. go and look for Eric."

The restaurant had only a few tables of guests at the time, however they told us a reservation was required and if we were to just order appetizers they don't allow seating in the restaurant but they offered seating in front which has about 8 small round tables.  We said no problem and sat in front.  I was surprised when our server was the hostess not at full waiter or waitress like they have if we were allowed to sit in the restaurant.\n\nThe \"waitress\" told us we were not allowed to order off the dinner menu but order off a special non-dinner menu which had a fraction of the appetizers available.  She took forever giving us water and for some reason brought out two different types of wine glasses for similar types of wine.  The appetizers finally came, but because it was a few of them for three people they had to join another round table hence this is why we wanted to sit inside.  Oh and we had to ask for napkins and silverware as they forgot that too.\n\nThis is very expensive restaurant for being treated like 2nd class citizens.  By the way, we are staying at The Palazzo."

The crispy rabbit leg was very good too, perfectly battered and fried, flesh was tender and juicy. The proscuitto was melt in you mouth, by dipping the toast that came with the dish in the house olive oil made the dish sublime.  My husband pasta with wild mushroom was so good I almost took his dish over.  The lobster pasta had very generous large pieces. The pasta was perfect the saucing was on the spot. The main course of rabbit was great too. Dessert was Myer's lemon pudding was everything I liked in s dessert, crunchy topping, light lemon chiffon cake floating on the lemony tart pudding.

Service was good at our table, wanted for nothing and never had to ask for anything.  The menu is extremely hard to understand with almost no vegetarian selections.  I had to ask the server for an explanation of each item I considered ordering.  \n\nAppetizer - Ordered a salad for an appetizer.  Appetizer my tail, there may have been a tablespoon of greens on the plate with a few mushrooms and at $15 or so, can I say ridiculous?!  \n\nEntree - After much debate over what to eat since I try to stay vegetarian unless the options are limited, I decided on Spaghettini with Lobster.  Received a 6 oz serving, with the lobster already diced and included with pasta.  The pasta was extremely under cooked and the flavor was poor at best.  I've had better pasta sauce by opening a jar of Ragu from the grocery store!!  For the most part the lobster was rubbery, except for the occasional undercooked pieces.  This is no doubt why I'm sitting in bed feeling disgusting right now!  A friend ordered the Ravioli - the look of disappointment on his face with the plate arrived was priceless.  Took John only 3 minutes to finish his serving.  \n\nDessert - I'm sorry, maybe I'm too Texan, but dessert should be sweets...not cheeses.  But with that said, we ordered the cheeses and coffee.  I have to admit some of the selections were very good, but the coffee was thick and gross!\n\nWine - They were out of the first selection, but the second selection was nice - a Pinot Noir - don't remember what selection, but it was nice.\n\n3 people + 3 1/2 hours = $560 (before gratuity!)"

It had been high on our list of must-visit restaurants, and I'm sorry to say, it was very disappointing. \n\nFirst of all, they messed up our reservation, which I'd made on Open Table months before our arrival. Once that was untangled, we were seated near a bachelor party that was incredibly loud and rowdy- at one point, one man was dragging another around the dining room in his chair. We asked to be moved and while this request was accommodated, it was done so with much huffing and sighing by the staff. \n\nEventually, we were seated appropriately and able to order food. It was perfectly adequate for a steakhouse. But if I'm going to travel over 2,000 miles to visit a restaurant owned by a world famous chef, I believe the food should be more than simply adequate. We dined at 7-8 restaurants over the course of our 3 day weekend and I documented each meal exhaustively. The fact that it wasn't until dessert that it occurred to me to take a photograph shows just how...meh...the food at B&B was. \n\nThe icing on the cake was the poor service. At one point, our server came at sat down at the table next to ours to visit with a friend who was dining. We had to wait through their 5-10 minute long conversation before we were able to receive the attention we needed. That was frustrating, to say the least, when one considers the price of the meal. A mediocre meal can be saved by fabulous service. Unfortunately, we experienced neither at B&B. \n\nThe best thing I can say for it is that my spouse loved the fact that the background music included Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails, and that he discovered a new favorite beer while we were there. Was it awful? No. Would we return, or recommend it to others? Also no. \n\nSorry Mario. Maybe we'll have a better experience when we try Carnevino next time?"

We decided to try B & B for a couple of reasons: 1.) we wanted tasty Italian food, 2.) the owner/chef Mario Batali is well known, and 3.) it's in the Venetian and we had tickets for Phantom. \n\nMy first impressions: dark, wood, classic, brown, fine-dining, lots and lots of staff running around. Like another reviewer stated, they almost hovered around you at times. The menu is set up in a traditional Italian style--appetizer, first course, second course. The main courses are eclectic to say the least--rabbit, quail, something called white-shrimp. My gf played it safe and ordered the pork chop, but I decided to be a bit adventurous and get the quail. But before that, let's talk appetizers and first courses.\n\nThe server recommended the buffalo mozzarella appetizer and we were going to pass (you can't come here and not expect to spend at least $100), but it sounded amazing and--it was! It came out drenched in olive oil, topped with red onions and seasoned with a generous amount of salt (apparently Batali is not afraid to use the white stuff). The mozzarella was so soft and fresh--it literally melted in your  mouth. Now, for the first course--we were starving when we got here and really wanted some pasta-action, but when we saw our neighbor's small portions, we thought: we better get entrees too.  Anyway, Christina ordered \"lune\" ravioli filled with sweet potatoes. Mmmmmm...very sweet and savory. I tried the homemade orecchiete with a sausage ragu. The pasta was authentic and the sausage ragu was spicy and satisfying. \n\nSo far, you're probably wondering why I only gave this restaurant 3 stars. Well, it's all about the entrees. The pork chop was cooked well, juicy and the vidalia onions gave it a tangy flavor, but it was just a pork chop. I tried the quail and it was so salty, I barely tasted anything else. Like most fine dining places, everything is ala carte, so they came with nothing! All in all, $178  later (we did get a half a carafe) of wine, and I only felt  mildly satisfied. If we return, we'll create our own pasta-tasting menu with four pasta dishes along with a couple of appetizers and we'll skip the main courses."

Though I was craving pasta, he touted the veal chop to the point where I couldn't resist, and I had no regrets; it was the best veal chop I have ever had.

We loved the lamb tongue on tomato and three minute egg over it. Rich and flavorful with a little vinegar. Lovely. The arugula was great and the chanterelle cut down the gaminess I'd the lamb tongue. I wasn't sure about the tongue but it was dqo flavorful. \n\nThe octopus was incredible. The sweet lemon sauce added s nice touch SBS the octopus itself was so well grilled. Terrific Broe bean made it so nicely Eich. I've never had such tender yet well grilled polpi\n\nThe amuse Bouche was lovely beans with a nice finish\n\nThe felone bread is terrific. Made by a local Vegas bakery and really nice and crunchy. Perfect for mopping up your plate. We learned that is called fare la scarpetta which sounds way better to me. \n\nThe chitarra was terrific. Really fresh tomato sauce and anchovy shavings. They remind me what al dente is. I over cook my pasta!\n\nThe kale with smoked pork and onions was equally good. \n\nSo it may be a vehicle for famous chefs and it may Las Vegas but they did a great job!"

It's good! \n\nThis is not your \"we import everything from Italy so we are an Italian restaurant\", nor is it \"I use my mamma's recipes and she was Italian so this is authentic\".  B&B creates classic Italian flavors using what is available seasonally, in the area.  From fresh herbs and produce to house cured salumi, it all goes into creating outstanding authentic food.\n\nAntipasti features a simple but perfect braised tripe alla Romana.  Tender, with no off smell.  Vibrant acidity from the tomatoes add a nice foil to the mildly flavored tripe.  Perfect.  The grilled octopus, heaven.  Toothsome with a charred bitter edge that contrast well with the sweet, spicy, sour limoncello vinaigrette.  The lemony perfume is heady.  Sensory overload on a single plate.\n\nPrima focuses around perfectly cooked, authentic pastas.  The bucatini all'Amatriciana is near Roman perfect.  Fatty, porky goodness of guanchale, bright acidity from pur\u00e9ed tomatoes, a zing of acidity from some wine, lightly spiced and finished with pecorino cheese.  If that's too simple, the bone marrow ravioli is to die for.  Rich unctuous goodness surrounded by thin pasta bathed in a veal shank ragu that must have simmered all day.\n\nSecondi proteins are different (lamb, rabbit, quail).  Experiment.  The deep fried sweetbreads, Win.   Crisp on the outside, pillowy on the inside; they pair perfectly with the sweet sour balsamic glazed cippolinis and the sweet bitterness of charred corn.  Don't think about what you're eating and you should be OK.\n\nMassive Italian centric wine list representing DOC / DOCG throughout the country.  Good vintage depth for super Tuscans.  Vegas resort prices.\n\nTrue Italian service, friendly with great pride taken in what they do."

            "review": "I've thought about this for a bit now, and I've raved about two of the items I had at B&B enough that it has to be 5 star. Two buddies and I dined here during our last trip to Vegas, and I fulfilled a desire to eat here that was left over from my last stay at the Venetian.\n\nFirst, the grilled octopus in limoncello vinaigrette. Great, great octopus. Amazing, firm, meaty texture without being too squeaky rubbery or unchewable. Add to that some great grilled flavor in that perfect dressing, with great citrus flavor...I'm hooked. The serving wasn't just tiny tentacles too - these were big meaty slices of octopus, pieces maybe an inch in diameter and several inches long, meaning you got a real taste of the meat. Amazing.\n\nWe started with the gnocchi with lamb and mint. I think this is what I want to eat just before I die. The gnocchi are I think the best I have ever had. Clearly handmade, perfectly tender with a slightly al dente center, with a rich tomato sauce, absolutely melt in your mouth braised lamb, and fresh mint leaves that were an unexpected but perfect compliment to the heavily savory lamb and broth. Simply and utterly fantastic.\n\nAfter those two things, I feel like the meal could only head downhill, and so it did. But not very far. My last course was the slow roasted lamb shoulder, which was delicious - also extremely tender, fall off the bone with good flavor, but the cannellini beans were a bit under done. This was very good, but when you put it next to those antipasti and primi courses, I don't think anything could really have held its own.\n\nWe skipped dessert, as nothing really jumped out at us, but were treated to a fun little complimentary sweet course. One thing I forgot to mention was a little chick pea bruschetta to start the meal, which was very good.\n\nI will say that this place can get expensive fast. Lots of good stuff on the menu and portions that are on the smaller side means the bill can add up quick. Is it worth it? Yeah, the meal I had totally was. But just, fair warning. Did we leave full? Yes, we did, but not stuffed. That's probably a good thing. All I know is, if I ever find myself back at the Venetian, I will not miss a chance to come back and repeat those opening courses. Holy cow."

The white wine I ordered was also REALLY good. The service was also top notch! \n\nI had the grilled octopus and short rib. Grilled octopus is one of my favorite dishes and this one did not disappoint! The octopus wasn't chewy at all and was grilled nicely. I had a bite of the calamari and that was also delicious! The orecchiette was very flavorful, but a tad heavy IMO. The pork agrodolce was a little too salty, but still very good. My short ribs were the best thing I ate that night! They had a good selection of gelati and sorbetti and that made it very difficult to choose what I wanted. I forgot what flavor I settled on, I think vanilla (?). I remember it being ok. We also had the panna cotta, which was forgettable and not that great. They gave us a tray of sweet goodies at the end from the pastry chef and that was a great way to finish off our dinner! \n\nWe didn't have a difficult time securing a reservation so that was a plus.

We were able to splurge and enjoy a full range of antipasti, primi, secondi, contorni & wine. Our bill for seven people came out to $1180, which did include $400+ in wine, so not horrible for a Michelin-caliber restaurant.\n\nWhat's funny is when you walk up to B+B in the Venetian/Palazzo Restaurant Row, the 'Beer & Burgers' aspect of the name stands out, as the facade appears to be little more than a 'nice bar.' We were a bit apprehensive as the host had us wait a few minutes - wait, are we really taking these important clients to a burger bar? - but once we walked inside the restaurant, it had the feel of a upscale comfort venue. Cozy, dark wood set the mood, offset by the white cloth linens and an upbeat serving crew, which included an in-house sommelier. We basically let the service run the show, and they treated us well where we had the best grilled octopus I've tried (absolutely tender; barely charred and so luscious), crispy pork trotter, calimari & seppie fritti, gnocchi, capellacci, country style pate, short rib \"al barolo,\" veal chop & spaghetti with freshly shaved white truffle. For dessert, the marscarpone/blood orange & tiramisu were both standouts. \n\nAbsolutely delicious meal, good service and nice decor. Very solid meal and highly recommended - especially if you're not footing the bill."

The appetizers stole the show, which is a shame because the main courses should be the star.  The menu design was great, however the execution left alot to be desired.  \n\nStaff was incredibly attentive and helpful in navigating the a-la-carte and tasting menu.  We opted for family style on the a-la-carte menu and they were very accommodating.\n\nLentil Bruschetta Amuse Bouche:  A+\nReally savory.  Simple dish but was a nice opener. \n\nGrilled Octopus Antipasti:  A\nGlorious.  Enjoyed the smoky flavor.  Octopus was cooked perfectly.  Not overdone or rubbery at all, and the olive oil sauce was delicate.\n\nBeef Tripe Stew Antipasti:  A\nReally heart beef flavor.  Tripe again, was cooked and seasoned to perfection!  May not be for everyone's tastes though, since the broth was quite gamey.  \n\nClam and Panchetta Linguine:  B\nThe pasta was cooked al dente.  However, the sauce was significantly overseasoned.  Not sure anyone tasted this before it was put up to the pass.  Generous serving of clams.  \n\nSirloin Filet:  A\nPerfect medium rare.  Fantastic taste and seasoning.  Great execution.\n\nRoasted Lamb Shoulder:  B\nWay too overdone.  Was also significantly overseasoned.  The meat itself was overdone to the extent that it was crispy and dry.  We agreed that this would have been an incredible dish if the lamb were a bit more succulent and if the chef didn't have such a heavy hand when seasoning.\n\nChocolate Souffle:  A+\nTexture was just right.  Souffle was not lopsided.  Filling was not too sweet.  Absolute deliciousness.  \n\nVanilla Marscapone:  A+\nShards of dried apple chips, pistachios, and an incredibly creamy marscapone.  Really balanced dessert with great flavors.  Erred on the sweeter side but still a pleasant finish to the meal.\n\nPROTIP:  The souffle is on the seasonal menu so YMMV."

            "review": "My buddy and I ate at B&B yesterday Saturday night, getting there around 9:45 on our last night in Vegas hoping to have extraordinary Italian food.  We each got one of the tasting menus and were overall disappointed. I had a glass of the Morellino di Scansano I Perazzi La Mozza 2007 Toscana and enjoyed this glass and a half pour with a mini decanter very much.  Very smooth, no acid, no tannins, not great fruit, but just enough. \n\nFor starters both tasting menus start off with 3 courses of raviolis.  Its just raviolis after raviolis.  For example, for the Pasta tasting menu, you get a ricotta ravioli in butter sauce, lambs brain ravioli in butter sauce with sage, a green pasta with a light meat sauce, and then another ravioli filled with short ribs. I mean enough with the raviolis. The next course Gnocchi was a real disappointment.  The gnocchi was really super firm, bordering on hard, obviously not hand made, and definitely not light.  and again with a braised oxtail which tasted like beef brisket. The highlight of this meal was the 2 dessert courses.  The Zabaglione with grapefruit was absolutely light, sublime, transcending, magical.  It reminded my friend of some delicious Japanese dessert crapes he had in Seattle with strawberries, whipped cream and Zabaglione in a crape cone.  The final dessert was an Italian Flan with crunchy cocoa nibs which was very good. Overall a C+.  Portions very small.  5-8 ravioli per plate. All the ravioli were hand made.\n\nThe Lombardia Veal Tasting Menu was not much better. The first course was a thin deli like slice of cooked veal over a mayonnaise sauce with some capers.  Next was a very creamy Tallegio cheese ravioli which tasted liked warm brie inside ravioli, melt in your mouth good.  The next bone marrow ravioli was not memorable at all. My friend liked the next course best, a pounded thin slice of veal, breaded with like panko and deep fried very crispy and topped with arugula and a lemon wedge.  I liked it, but nothing to write home about.  I've had very good country fried steak which were better and more tender. Next was a very slender piece of medium gorgonzola cheese with some candied fruit, a very small and delicate cheese plate.  The desserts for this tasting menu were awful.  Toasted panttone with apricot jam was a joke.  Cinnamon, honeyed butter toast would have been better. And the fried Italian donuts were dense like dense cake, not light like a good beignet, not worth the calories or effort to eat the whole thing. \n\nThey also raised the price from 100 to $120 on Thursday March 10, 2011 and raised the wine paring from 70 to 75.  They comped my wine because of the confusion, but that was still not enough to erase a disappointing Italian meal.  All my buddy and I could do was to recall better meals we had in our lives.  \n\nI can't speak for the rest of the menu.  if this was their best foot forward, then I would spend my money elsewhere."

Our server suggested the grilled octopus, and it was good, and so was the calamari.  Their pork loin was also tasty.  But the pasta...\n\nMy bucatini was super salty!  Their bolognese sauce was also salty, misis said the pappardelle helped neutralize it.  Our server did say their pasta items are salty, and the bucatini was the saltiest from the guanciale and the salty pasta water.  I may have wimpy taste buds, but then again, guanciale & pancetta pasta dishes from other places were not this salty.  The last time I had it this salty was when I added salt cooking carbonara and all'amatriciana at home, and yah, meat was salty and pasta water was salted.  Then again, I really can't argue Mario Batali's experience now, can I?\n\nLast note:  we're really grateful for our awesome server who didn't let us leave without some dessert, gave us house sweets.

Most of the dishes were spectacular, but there were quality issues that I thought were below the standards that a Batali and Bastianich restaurant would have.\n\nThe bread was terrible. It tasted like it had been frozen or it was straight out of the walk in. The crust was hard and rubbery, and the middle was barely thawed. It wasn't a good first impression. \n\nThe chic pea brushcetta was passable. It was seasoned well, It tasted fine, but for an amuse bouche, it was boring.\n\nThe octopus appetizer was where things started to look up. It was incredible. The intense colors of the sauce on the plate made the octopus stand out. It was grilled to a perfect crisp, without a hint of rubbery-ness. It is the best octopus dish I have ever tasted.\n\nMy gf had the goat cheese tortellini and it did not disappoint. The pasta was silky and the combination of citrus and fennel contrasted the rich goat cheese perfectly. It was divine. \n\nI had the short ribs served with a creamy polenta and freshly grated horseradish. The flavors were all there but the short rib was dry, which was odd considering it was braised in barolo. \n\nI wanted to give B&B 3.5 stars, I rounded up."

Not so last night. \nLet me start by saying the service was excellent.  Our server and almost all the supporting service team are the only ones who deserve a star in this review.\nI really expected much more from Batali and Bastianich.. and their executive chef. To see Joe Bastianich on Master Chef (e.g. spitting out substandard food and chastising the guilty chef), you would think he would expect a higher standard from the chefs at the restaurant with HIS name on it... especially with the priciness of the menu items (I won't even comment on the wine since I expect a 2x-3x mark up in Las Vegas.)\nHere's where things went wrong:\n1) The Heritage pork bruschetta (open-faced pork pastrami sandwich) came on soggy bread; it was meant to serve a few of us but came as one long bruschetta and when asked for a serrated knife, the sommelier huffed, and proceeded to mutilate our bruschetta with a spoon and a butter knife\n2) A friend just wanted chicken.. it was on the menu.  They ran out of chicken.  How does a restaurant run out of chicken?  That's always the last to go.  I'm guessing they ran out because the guests who ordered the pork chops (describe below) ended up returning their meals as I did and ordered the chicken instead\n3) One of the recommended dishes was the grilled pork chops.  I should have known not to order when the server said it was brined for a long period.. I was trusting Batali's and Bastianich's reputations.  The server came with my chop and said that the chef recommendation is to finish the pork chop with a balsamic vinaigrette.  I wanted to taste the flavor of the meat so I couldn't understand why so I asked for some on only half of the chop and then perhaps a side dish.  After my first bite, I understood why.  The pork chop was inedible... I  love salt, but it was well OVER-seasoned. The vinaigrette and peach served with the pork were meant to cut the saltiness from over-brining. Even if that had worked, I would still have consumed more salt than I would in a week.. the cut of the pork was excellent, the flavor would have been nice too, but for the over-seasoning\n4)  Pass on the desserts.  We sampled four (chocolate torte, blueberry crepe, not tiramisu \"tiramisu\" and fig crostada (puff pastry with salty mascarpone filling)... by the way, both the desserts with mascarpone had salty mascarpone..)\nThe night was made enjoyable because of the company of old friends... but we could have taken our business elsewhere and had both great company and (most likely) much better food."

We ordered the spaghetti with lobster for our \"primo\" portion and I like my pasta al dente but this was so raw it was crunchy and the lobster was very tough and chewy. For our \"secondi\" portion I ordered the veal chop and my girlfriend ordered the NY Strip. We ordered medium rare as per the \"chef's\" suggestion but what we were served was so rare that our plates were practically mooing! Sent the meat back to be cooked a little longer and I believe all they did was take a hand held blow torch to our meals because the meat came back with very odd color that normally wouldn't be caused by a regular broiler. The servers were very accommodating and we did appreciate their efforts to try to make our meal experience better. But definitely not worth the $260.00 that the meal cost."

Had the special pork shank and it was really under cooked and still tuff. Really an amatuer mistake for 100 dollar plate. Try aquanox instead same price and better food. Great beet salad on the positive notes.  Maybe try the normal meals and stay away from any specials. Octobus was also one of the better dishes."

They tell you that the norm for 2 people is 2 appetizers, 1 pasta, and 2 main dishes.  We weren't starved, so we decided to split one of each.  Good move here.  We started with the Steamed Clams in a spicy broth, with extra bread to dip into the delicious broth.  Next we split the Beef Cheek Ravioli with crushed duck liver.  Rich and delcicious.  And then on the main meat.  We split the lamb chops.  As is the case at nice restaurants, we were expecting a small portion of lamb chops.  Imagine my surprise when 8 lamb chops came out!  They were delicious.  \n\nI was on the lookout for the issue with the salt that other reviewers have mentioned.  The only thing that could have used less salt was the eggplant underneath the lamb chops, but it did not affect the actual meat at all.  Perhaps they have worked towards solving the problem of oversalting.\n\nThe service was great, ambience great, the wine was good and surprisingly reasonable for the 1/4 liters, and the gelato AND vanilla semi-freddo for dessert were delicious.  The gelato was a treat from the pastry chef for my birthday.  \n\nGreat experience, I will go back next time I'm in Vegas, and I will visit Babbo when I'm in NYC, as I am now a Batali convert."

Thanks Mario :o)\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was a bit more bistro-like than restaurant-like, which was fine with me but I did find it a bit surprising.  I will say that really liked the cute little wine room in the back which housed their large selection of wine!\n\nI was pleased with the service -- our server and her apprentice really dealt with our slightly inebriated group & random, border-line obnoxious questions well.  We definitely had a playful banter sort of relationship going on with our servers, which made the experience a bit less formal (which I liked).  For those of you that would prefer a more formal experience, our's may have been that way due to the fact that our group was all in our mid-twenties :o)  Other than that, our water glasses were never more than half empty and the man who passed out the bread deserves extra props for dealing with our group :o)\n\nAll of the food that I tried was delicious!  I ordered the Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles & Duck Liver which was A-MAZING.  I would definitely order it again.  The pasta was perfectly al dente with a nice bite & flavor to it.  I also had the Brasato al Barolo which was extremely tender and flavorful -- just thinking about it makes my mouth water!  I tried a bite of the Lamb's tongue antipasti, which was an interesting bite to say the least.  The Stinging Nettle Pappardelle tasted fantastic as well, and if I ever return to B&B I would definitely order that dish! \n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at B&B.  If it weren't for the plethora of other restaurant options that Vegas provides, I would guarantee my return sooner rather than later :o)"

Yes, I may have had a better meal, but from making the reservations to paying the bill, B&B is one of the best. \n\nWe arrived to B&B about 10 minutes early of 5pm since we had a 7pm show to make. We sat at the bar and enjoyed a craft made \"Smoked Potato and Rosemary\" Martini that was like an amuse on its own. A perfect starter prepared by a very knowledgeable bartender. \n\nWe were seated at 5pm, with our waiter already informed of our time line. He started with a great introduction and briskly informed us of the best choices that we could manage. Any questions were answered with detail and a reassurance that you were making the correct decision. He also noticed that my wife was pregnant and offered a custom \"Mocktail\" for her. \n\nANTIPASTI: \nWarm Lamb's Tongue with Chanterelles and a 3-Minute Egg $17 - a great balance of pickling, tender, and savory bites that come to life the second you break that egg yolk. \n\nPRIMI: \nBeef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver $26 - a classic Batali dish that emphasizes texture and the control of flavor. The mixture of duck liver was and beef cheek was fantastic, with the liver just adding that necessary mineral, woodsy accent. \n\nGoat Cheese Tortelloni with Dried Orange and Wild Fennel Pollen $25 - Just an awesome dish. The goat cheese filling was so creamy and smooth. Again, no single ingredient over shadowed the other, the all play together perfectly, exciting your palate with every bite. \n\nSECONDI: \nCrispy Polenta Sweetbreads with Favas, Oyster Mushrooms and Spring Garlic \"Fonduta\" $36 - A great dish executed with a delicate touch. The sweetbreads where simply creamy inside their crispy thin crust. The favas, mushrooms, and \"fonduta\" simply created a lovely sauce coating eat morsel. Paired with a recommended glass of red wine that I wish I could remember, perfect. \n\nWe had to skip desert, but the choice was difficult. \n\nPS - Love the 80's music playing in the background. It does make it seem so uptight and snooty. Someone gets it; great food, proper attire, in a relaxed atmosphere works wonders. \n\n$$$$ if you are a proper patron."

My wife's sweet potato pasta was again good, but no great.   My sausage with broccoli rape was so salty it made me sick (nausea and heartburn).

I could not eat anything because my stomach was so upset and I explained this to them.  The manager was so smugg and couldn't muster even an apology, just said the chef tried it and it was a bit salty.... A BIT I WAS SICK!

            "review": "Being a Foodnetwork nerd, I was really excited to try B&B. I told my friends about how much I enjoyed watching Mario Batali on tv and how without hesitation we should try this restaurant. After dinner I walked away with my tail between my legs, as I had committed a social felony recommending this restaurant!\n\nWine by the glass selection is limited, and we weren't sure what red to order, so the staff wine expert came to our table and helped us pick out the perfect bottle. We really appreciated that and very much enjoyed the wine (which is clear, because I can't remember which bottle of wine we tried)! \n\nThe decor is white tablecloth, surrounded by warm tones---we heard them playing Jane's Addiction in the background which my friends and I really appreciated. We enjoyed the contrast of rock music to elegant dining. Now onto the food...the reason I'm only giving this restaurant 2 out of 5 stars...\n\nWe had eaten shortly before, so two of my friends were tempted to split one plate of Goat Cheese Tortelloni (instead of ordering two). The waitress (who in my opinion was unfriendly) said \"We don't have large portions of pasta here\" and with her hands showed us how small they are. Well, yes, the pasta portion was not large like at a typical Olive Garden, but the richness of the goat cheese was PLENTY filling from one plate. My friends didn't even touch their second serving they had ordered. So in short--I wasn't impressed with the service. Our waitress was totally unfriendly and impatient. We had excellent olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the table for dipping, but the waitress didn't even bother to check to see if our bread was warm. It was cold as if it had been recently thawed out.\n\nThe filling of the Goat Cheese Tortelloni is rich, but the texture is light. The pasta was al dente--which was fine. This was probably the best dish we tried at B&B even though it was a bit salty. OVER-SALTED is the theme for our experience at B&B. The duck I ordered was beautifully presented, but it was over-cooked and SALTY. The Field Greens with Trebbiano Vinaigrette was too salty, and so was the unconventional Calamari and Seppie Fritti appetizer. I imagined the chef, sous chef and kitchen staff all taking turns that night pretentiously sprinkling salt on each dish, one after the other, behind each other's backs. \n\nI'm sure the quality of ingredients at B&B is superior, but you wouldn't know it underneath all that salt. More than spending that kind of money for a bad meal, I hated feeling embarrassed that I had so strongly convinced my friends (on our last night in Vegas) to try this restaurant. I had put alot of faith in Mario Batali's name and that was a mistake. Just because his name's on the sign doesn't mean he's running the kitchen. With all of the food that Las Vegas has to offer, I felt we had wasted a meal's worth of time visiting this place. \n\nSo, if you insist on eating at B&B Ristorante, you can have faith that the wine and the Goat Cheese Tortelloni are a hit. I worked in restaurants in Houston for several years, and I know that sometimes the success of a meal can rest solely on who the kitchen manager is and how he dictates the show behind the scenes. Maybe we were just the unlucky bunch that ate there on a bad night. Even taking that into consideration I probably would not try B&B again."

We wanted to order the pork chop as we had heard it was very good and we were told they ran out of it by 7pm on a Saturday night......really???? \nWe had just been told from the bartender that the servers tell the guests that they do not have the pork chop to increase the sale of the pork special they were offering right now. When in fact they have plenty of pork chops in the kitchen.  We called over the general manager to speak to him about it and let me tell you this guy should not be in the position he is in running this type of high end restaurant. The GM was very rude and actually made the situation worse. We had already ordered wine so we ended up staying.  Once our alternate food selections arrived, the portions were very small and tasteless.\n I would not say walk or run from this place but sprint very fast as overall it is a huge waste of money. \nSo to sum it up, it was my last night in Vegas, I was really looking forward to a nice and expensive dinner. I left B&B and went to Grand Lux as I was so hungry from the small portions and horrible food. Mario.....you better get back to your restaurant for some major improvement. \nRight now It SUCKS!!!!"

I had no clue what half of the menu items were, and there was nothing on the menu to decode it for me.  I ordered the black spaghetti with sausage in pesto.   The sausage was in tiny flakes about the size of large grains of salt - literally.   And the price of this 7-oz portion of plain pasta with about a gram of meat (if that) was $26.  And it was too spicy-hot to eat, although the waiter did warn me that this was a spicy entree.  Now the dessert:  Figuring it was a nice seasonal specialty,    I ordered pumpkin & cream.   In all fairness, the menu didn't say anything more than that; I just had no idea that any restaurant would make a dessert that so literally matches the name:  it was a slab of pumpkin, carved right out of the gourd, perhaps baked for a few minutes, and served over some cream.  Looked like a big slice of cantaloupe on the plate, and had the firmness of - well, a slab of pumpkin carved right out of the gourd.  \n\nSo:  slow service, indecipherable menu items, deceptive ingredient descriptions, and bizarre concoctions.

I ordered the pork chop and was told it would be prepared med. rare.  I wanted it more medium ...which again led to an argument with the waiter (argument is too strong a word..but he did say that it was better to which I pointed out that a skilled chef ought to to able to cook this even through and yet leave it juicy...which is what I have actually had in Italy!)  This chop which was quite an expensive cut of pork came out quite dry though the mostarda went quite a long way and given the paucity of time, I tried my best to choke down as much as possible, skipped dessert and went out to the cheap noodle place for a roast pork dish which was 1/5th the price and much better IMHO.\n\nFor me, this place is a total avoid.  Its kinda funny to see Mr. Bastianich on MasterChef with a purile expression on his face throwing away food from home cooks when a branded restaurant cant do better than a home cook.  Just sayin' I do like his wines though."

B&B was across from where Wayne Brady was performing -- and they could seat us immediately (just two).  The waiter was well informed about both the food and the wine.  He offered me a taste of the two wines by the glass I was considering.  He also steered us correctly regarding our dessert options.  We'd heard about the oatmeal gelato -- but it wasn't available.  Have no fear, the honey infused polenta was great!  The supervisor from the Platinum hotel was also on the mark with the lobster spaghetti and we found the beef cheek ravioli on our own.  \n\nPerfect food, perfect service, perfect location.  Yum!"

The chickpeas were very moist and had great olive oil on them\n\nThe Lonza (a type of salumi) with fresh peaches and arugula was great! Nice combination of salty, sweet, and overall fresh.\n\nOrecchiette with Spicy Lamb Sausage: So good! Pasta is clearly homemade and cooked properly. Nicely finished with fresh Pecorino cheese.\n\nSpecial of the day was a Roasted Pork dish; I didn't love it. It was cooked nicely and had fresh flavors, but it wasn't for me.\n\nAdam made me a delicious Espresso Martini to end the meal perfectly.\n\nGrab a seat at the bar and enjoy your time there!

As my friend and I were rushing to the restaurant in the Venetian, we were star struck, as we saw Heather Lockler walking behind us. But to the more important things, as we rushed around the Venetian, we couldn't find the restaurant.   Note to all, it is all the down the restaurant row, past the Blue Man theater ticket office.\n\nAfter we got seated, our waiter was very helpful in explaining the dishes and how they are prepared.  Reviewing the menu online, which is actually has the same items from the Babbo restaurant, I knew what I wanted to order.   \n\nFirst up came the \"Warm Lamb's Tongue Vinaigrette with Chanterelles and a 3-Minute Egg\" and \"Grilled Octopus\".  Both appetizers were very good.  The lambs tongue has a texture like beef, so it was nice and firm. The octopus was just darn good.\n\nNext came the \"Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver\"  and \"Spaghettini with Spicy Budding Chives, Sweet Garlic and a One Pound Lobster\".  I like the spaghettinie over the beef cheek ravioli, due to the spicy sauce.  The beef cheek ravioli was to rich and buttery for me.\n\nThis was followed by the \"Fennel Dusted Sweetbreads with Sweet and Sour Onions, Duck Bacon\" and \"Veal Chop with Sauteed Porcini and Braised Escarole\".   As it was my first time eating sweetbreads, which are not brains but the thymus glands, it was tasty. Coated with the fennel mixture it is deep fried, tasting almost like a chicken nugget. The veal was tasty but on the well side, as it was supposed to be medium rare. \n\nThe wine list is extensive and quite pricey, more than what I would have expected for the restaurant.\n\nOverall, it was a great evening. As the restaurant opened 2 weeks ago, services was a little disorganized.  Hopefully they get the bugs out."

I wouldn't say B&B is a BAD experience, and I don't regret going, but I won't be back. \n\nThe good: \n-Grilled octopus totally deserves the positive reviews it receives. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. \n-Lamb's tongue was also stellar. I loved the combination of rich egg and earthy mushrooms to go with the meatiness of the lamb. \n-Good wine selection, and our server was very generous with tasting pours and letting us try many options before we decided on what we wanted to drink. \n-Service is very prompt and attentive. \n\nThe bad/weird/meh: \n-Our server was just... strange. He was very knowledgable about the menu but his method of delivery was just over the top and came across as forced. Every time we ordered something he immediately began to rattle off an obviously-memorized spiel about the dish, with a very fast robotic tone lacking any sort of emotional connection. Even if we didn't ask for any information! It was pretty disruptive, although admittedly kind of hilarious after-the-fact. \n-The pasta dishes were all SO meat-and sauce heavy, making the pasta seem like an afterthought. \n-I like al dente pasta but I felt that the spaghetti we had was just a little too firm for my tastes. Maybe a personal preference? \n-The olive oil fried quail was good but nothing special, really. We only ordered it out of desperation because we were trying to find a main course that would be more interesting than steak/fish/pork. I can get grilled pork chops, trout and ribeye anywhere, people!"

I was unprepared, psychologically, for just how great it was going to be. \n\nWe started with an appetizer of Grilled Octopus with \"Fagioli Marinati\" and Spicy Limoncello Vinaigrette. The octopus was meaty; salty, and played perfectly with the vinaigrette. It was, by far, the best part of an exceptional meal. I've never had octopus so tender and delicious. \n\nNext came the primi platters. I had the Bone Marrow Ravioli with Osso Bucco Rag\u00f9. While delicious, the portion on it was unconscionably small. I understand that this is gourmet, fine dining, but, for $32, I wanted more than twelve ravioli, each the size of a quarter. \n\nMy co-worker Gnocchi with Lamb Rag\u00f9 and Mint - I'd love to tell you how that tasted, but judging from the way he growled at me and threatened me with a knife when I asked for a bite, I'm guessing it was excellent. \n\nMy secondi was the Short Rib \"al Barolo\" with Anson Mills Polenta and Horseradish. From what I gather, as far as short rib goes, it was the best ever made. It turns out I don't like short ribs, it seems. Such is life. My co-worker enjoyed that, while I stole the rest of his Crispy Fried Sweetbreads with Italian Butternut Squash and Wickson Apples. I've never had sweetbreads before; I MUST have them again. Those were excellent. \n\nFinally, because we're gluttonous, I got the Vanilla Mascarpone Bruciato\nwith Fresh Huckleberries, which was heavenly, and he got the Apple Crostata\nwith Vanilla Bean Gelato. Both top-notch. \n\nAll in all, worth the trip if you're taking a client out to dinner on an expense account, or you're extremely wealthy on your own."

It's expensive, but totally worth it.\n\nI went with a group of 11 people and we were treated like kings and queens by our extremely articulate waiter and the sommelier. Our waiter said most groups order a few Antipasti dishes, a few pastas to share family style, and an individual entree... we decided to go \"all in\" and followed his instructions. \n\nAntipasti;\nTripe: delicious. Tripe might not be everyone's cup of tea, but people who don't like it are missing out on quite the amazing cup of tea.\n\nRamp: This was a vegetable I'd never had, but it's a lot like a green onion. Served with delicious, fresh mozzarella. Very fresh and tasty.\n\nCrispy Pork Trotter: These are basically Crab Cakes, but made with Pork instead of Crab. And they are as awesome as that sounds.\n\nBeet Salad: Even this was incredible.\n\nGrilled Octopus: The restaurant's signature antipasti, this was completely epic.\n\nPastas:\n\nSpaghetti: Made with a full pound of Lobster, the sauce is made from the reduced juices. So good.\n\nBlack Spaghetti: Dyed with squid ink and Sicilian Pesto, this was subtle but delightful.\n\nBone Marrow Ravioli/ Calf's Brain Ravioli: These both had extremely different textures and flavors, but they are also both Raviolis stuffed with meats that make some people balk. Don't balk, these were both amazing.\n\nMint Love Letters: Stuffed with Lamb and Sausage crumbles, these probably won the award for best of the pastas.\n\nEntree:\n\nI went with the Lamb Chop. Served on the bone with grilled Peppers and Romsco sauce and cooked Medium Rare. Unbelievably tender.\n\nI also tried my friend's Taglietta, served with Salsa Verde, which was perfect.\n\nThe Persecco and Red Wine we ordered were absolutely amazing as well. We had no room for desserts so we just ordered Espressos at the end of the meal, but our server still brought us a complimentary cookie platter since we were there to celebrate a couple birthdays for the meal. Nice of them, though our meal did come out to over $1200 so I'm pretty sure they didn't lose much by bringing us cookies.\n\nAll of the food was amazing, and our very enthusiastic server took us through every item step by step, explaining what was great about all of it. He used the words \"awesome\" and \"spectacular\" a lot, but he wasn't wrong... the entire B and B experience was incredibly awesome and spectacular. That Mario Batali just might know what he's doing."

Since we were staying in The Venetian, I had been eyeing B&B Ristorante being that we are all huge fans of Mario Batali. Overall, the experience was so poor that it will be memorable. Since my sister was the only one ordering food (my other sister and I had eaten earlier in the evening), we decided to sit at the bar. The restaurant hostess refused to seat us at one of the small tables at the entrance which were all vacant. So we sat at the bar, were handed menus, and then left to wait...a very long time...without being acknowledged by the bartender who managed to acknowledge and take orders from all of the men who sat at the bar after us. Led Zeppelin's greatest hits were BLARING ( I kid you not!), and after we were finally able to order my sister's entree and our drinks, we were left to wait for probably at least a good 30 minutes before our Blood Orange Cosmos appeared with the glass of wine that my sister ordered to go with her Bolognese Paparadelle. This should have been our cue to walk out, but being to tired from a day of trudging around the strip we were all to exhausted to take action and get fired up. When our tiny Cosmos finally arrived, they were indeed delicious. However, when my sister's thin slice of a flute baguette topped with chick peas showed up on a small side plate that dwarfed it, we are agreed it was indeed an \"amuse bouche\". Very funny...joke's on us! At some length, the Bolognese Paparadelle showed up. Again, a huge white plate with a serving of pasta that looked more like an appetizer. No bread, no nothing. All this for a mere $28. Finally, a slice of bread (really!) was brought to her when she was half way through the pasta. Her plate from her \"appetizer\" was never removed. I joked with my sister that because there was a tiny speck of sauce left on the plate that the restaurant staff thought there was still a serving left. My sister left hungry, and we all felt assaulted by the music and insulted by the lousy service. The microscopic portions of food were good (I would hope so...it is Mario Batali's restaurant).\nI tried to send this feedback directly to B&B, but there is not email contact provided. Needless to say, won't be back, and I certainly do not feel compelled to visit other Batali locations."

I contacted the restaurant about doing a custom pasta tasting because there were certain pastas I wanted to try and my wish was there command and even offered to do a custom wine pairing for it as well, which I didn't take advantage of. While I didn't really like the ambiance of the restaurant, just felt like I was eating in a mall for some reason...idk weird feeling, but I did love the food. The amuse was Bruscetta w/chickpeas & olives which was alright but nothing that impressed me. The first pasta dish was the Sweet Potato \"Lune\" with Sage and Amaretti. As said before I'm a huge sweet potato fan so of course I loved this dish. It has a strong sweet potato taste filling inside a small flat ravioli and a sweet amaretti cream sauce that almost made the dish to sweet but I still loved it!\n\nPasta dish two was the Lamb's Brain \"Francobolli\" with Lemon and Sage! Call me Hannibal but this dish is what I was looking forward to the most during my trip. It was surprisingly very good. Tasted slightly like ground beef with a much smoother texture. It was filled in small raviolis covered in a lemon sauce that added a nice lightness to the dish that was simply delish and had me almost licking my plate! I am now a Lamb's Brain lover and which is why I like Mario Batali because he isn't afraid to try something crazy like this.\n\nPasta dish three was the there pasta of the evening which to be honest I don't remember because I didn't like it so I will skip that one and go straight to the last pasta dish which was the Pici with Lamb Ragu. Tasted and looks just like spaghetti but with a little kick which I liked and had little bits of lamb that tasted much like sausage. Great dish!\n\nFor my deserts I went with the sorbet of the evening which was coconut and a special pumpkin torte that they had. The sorbet was very refreshing after having all those rich dishes and had a light sweetness to it that made it feel like I was eating a nice refreshing piece of fruit over some sugar enriched sorbet. The pumpkin torte on the other had was WAY to rich and had to stop after two bites. Tasted just like pumpkin pie but found it to be much more richer.\n\nOverall I loved this place. Even though I didn't like the ambiance, the food made up for it. I love Italian food and I think Mario Batali's strong points are in his pasta's. While I've seen many bad reviews of this place, most of the people who had something negative to say was geared towards his entrees or Secondi's he calls them. When I go to a Italian restaurant I go for one thing and one thing only, PASTA! I experienced no over saltiness at all but did experience pasta that was flavored just beautifully. Service was top class through the whole meal. I can't wait to return and to try his restaurant in NY!"

Amazing octopus appetizer.\n\nB and b restaurant is a amazing fine dine dining choice inbetween the palzzo and the venetian in restaurant corner..its easy to find and reservations are easy via opentable.\n\nUpon seating, the booths are very comfortable. But i found the tables slightly high for comfort. It was not a problem at all but it was indeed not the most comfortable choice.\n\nOnce seated, our server was very friendly and courteous. He went through the menu extensively and explained what was popular and even went through the tasting menus. \n\nUpon ordering there was almost no wait for appetizers to be served. The house provided a chickpea brushetta. Which was a great vegetarian dish that was surprisinly unique.  It is definetly an acquired taste but the flavours of olive oils and the crispy bruschetta matched well. I typically dont like chickpeas. But this pairing tasted pretty good. They also served a great crusty bread with a californian olive oil and an italian balsamic vinegrette. Yummy! \n\nWe started with the highly rated octopus dish. This is highly rated for good reason. They have turned a normally rubbery tough dish to the most tender juicy piece of seafood that is soft and delicious. The sauces accompanied with it gave the dish the tang to keep the dish super flavourful without overwhelming it. It was balanced and every bite was divine. I have to say its the best octopus ive ever had. Even better than live octopus from nobu!!! Whatever their secret is i definetly will order this every time i come to vegas. Dear god dont miss out. Its sooooooo delicious!\n\nNext off we decided on the pasta tasting which was an amazing 6 course meal with dessert. The first course was a corzetti with a pesto genovese. It was light and the mint gave the pesto a great touch. Delicious. My tip. Sop up all that pesto with some of the provided bread. It was delicious! Lol. The second course was the goat cheese tortolinni. Tender and melt in your mouth it was superb. The dish was drenched in oil but was surprisingly light. Third course was the summer squash agnolotti. This was my favourite dish. It was savoury but tasted like the vegtables were enhanced by the sweetness of the zucchini. It was tender and the radishes on top added a perfect crunch to the dish. If you are ordering a la carte... id have to highly recomend the vegtable pasta dishes. They are amazing and bring vegetarian options to a new level. My son who doesnt care for them said the veggies were sweet and savoury at the same time and really enjoyed them. \n\nNext we had the meat courses which were great but not as amazing as the pasta vegetarian dishes. But were still flavourful and hearty. Albertos pyramids was great. A tender pasta with a rose sauce was sweet and satisfying. It had the unique italian flavour that sends you back to rome. The tomatoes sweet and the pasta that melts in your mouth. This was my second favourite dish on the pasta tasting menu. The second meat dish was the beef cheek ravioli with truffles and duck liver. This was good. The texture a bit off but the flavours were great. The meat was off only bc it was the consistentcy of pulled pork in a pasta. Which was kinda weird. But the truffles gave it that little kick of flavour to make you wonder how these combinations even meddle great together. Who would of known...beef with truffles and duck liver. Wow thats unique. Its something ive never had before and is quite inventive. Which i appreaciate. It really made me feel like this meal was a special night out! So live a little and have another glass of wine. Thats what i did and it was totally worth it.\n\nBtw...the wine list is extensive and intimidating for an amateur like me. But the waiter suggested an amazing wine which is poured into a serving glass which equates to two full glasses of wine. For the glass i tried. $15 a glass was a great deal! Cheaper than beer! Score!\n\nLastly we finished with a chocolate chip canoli. It was great. Not overly sweet. But still satisfied the sweet tooth. With the americano it was a perfect ending to my meal. Surprisingly it was lighter than i expected! \n\nI must rave about the Impeccable timing for service. Dishes were cleared quickly and dishes paced adequatly. The servers cleared dishes and ensured everything was provided for before they left. Honestly id give them 6 stars for service. It was anticipated, everything i wanted even before asking. They were that good. Wine poured when needed. Water refilled. Plates cleared. Cutlery provided quickly. Even extra plates for every meal were provided since i was sharing with my son. For every course!!!! Without asking. They treat kids superb. And make the night out more special for the kiddos by making them feel welcome during our entire meal. No pretentious servers here!\n\nI will be back. The service and food exceeded my expectations. And it will be on my to return list when i come back again!"

Normally, the $50/plate kind of restaurants are incredibly pretentious and as a college student who can't afford these kind of meals as often as the rest of the people dining there, it really sucks when you can't have fun with your friends and talk during your meal.  Last time I went to a nice restaurant, my friend and I were almost whispering but at B&B, they had the Beatles playing in the background, the waiters were coming by to chitchat, and we even got complimentary samples from the chefs.  We didn't feel out of place at all and the 5 of us girls had a really good time.  \n\nThe food was amazing.  The octopus appetizer which all the waiters recommended was delicious.  I never knew octopus could be prepared so well.  We ended up getting 2 pastas to split as a first course and then we each got 2nd courses.  It was ridiculously filling. The pastas were amazing - whenever I see homemade pasta or homemade noodles anywhere on a menu, I have to get it.  I also had rabbit for my first time, kind of felt bad due to the cuteness factor of rabbits but damn, if I ever have rabbit, it would only be at B&B.  It was prepared in 4 different ways and served on one plate and it was so good!!  \n\nHowever, what really gave this place that fifth star was the service and the atmosphere.  I'm in love with Mario Batalli, you are awesome!"

When I pointed out it was a booth and not a table I was asked, \"What's the difference?\"\nThen I asked for the manager, when he came he still tried to get is to sit at the booth and offered to bring a chair for me to sit in because I can't get in and out of booths, when I sat in the chair I was given the table in the booth hit the top of my shins. I told them this is not going to work and I wanted a table like I asked for in the beginning. \nAt this point I was lead to a table for four with an extra chair pushed in at the end when I pointed this out to the waitress she well this was the best they had at her station and there was a big round table at the other side, but then she wouldn't be our waitress. She said this in a flirty way that really made a little sick to my stomach, I told her that sounded good to me. Unfortunately the manager had all ready had the member of my party with the most trouble moving seated in one of the chairs, so by the end of dinner I could barely walk from having to keep my legs under my chair, again because we where never seated at a table for five. \n\nWhen I called back to tell the manager he had people that didn't know a table from a booth I was literally told,  \"Go F**k Yourself\"\n\nI know I have stepped foot in my last restaurant that is owned by this company."

            "review": "What does it say about a meal for which you, by yourself, have paid $215 (after gratuity) when the most exciting part was the discovery of a new hand-drying technology? While I cannot recommend the actual restaurant, should you accidentally visit B&B Ristorante in Las Vegas, you really MUST try the amazing Veltia hand-drying machine in the bathroom. \n\nTo say I was disappointed with the food is like saying you were disappointed when you walked in on your mom and me trying to conceive your new baby sister (surprise!). Yes, the emotions under discussion are roughly analogous, but they're not really comparable. In my historic review of Lupa I said Mr. Batali was a wizard because that restaurant and Babbo, two of Batali's New York joints, are made not of brick and mortar but of the Platonic ideal of Italian restaurants coalesced into tangible shape and form. Considering how much I love those places I had to find a way to reconcile the crappy impression left on me by B&B. And I did. Here's my theory:\n\nIn 2006 a disgraced, leprous chef approached Mario Batali after spiking the chubby ginger Gandalf's drink and  stabbing him with a heroin syringe. \n\n\"Mr. Batali, I have a business proposition for you,\" our villain said as the drugs raced through Batali's veins. \n\n\"I'm one with the universe! Time has no meaning!\" Batali said. Special note for kids: intravenous drugs act with almost instantaneous speed. You're welcome. \n\nSensing an opportunity, the asshole wannabe chef said, \"This is the Lord, Mr. Batali, and I have a business proposition.\"\n\n\"Give unto God what is God's, unto Caesar what is Caesar's! What would you have me do, Lord, on this my road to Damascus!\" \n\nHeroin. What a drug.\n\nThe antagonist continued, \"I want to make a restaurant with mediocre food, but it's prepared elaborately and attached to an exorbitant fee, so people won't know any better!\"\n\n\"Lord, I made Otto and Lupa and Babbo,\" Batali said. \"My 'strants kick ass as a rule, I really wouldn't feel comfortable--\"\n\n\"THOU WILT DO AS THY GOD COMMANDS!\" said the son of a bitch. \n\nAnd so B&B Ristorante was born, the child of blasphemy and lies. I had no way of knowing this when I walked into that den of woe one fateful Sunday night. \n\n\"Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate,\" the waitress said as we took our seats. \n\nThere would be no debate over the menu. I looked my different tasting menu options and ordered the \"regional\" list with the attached wine pairing in order to have the widest range of savory experiences.\n\nThe first layer of our meal was the Georgia White Shrimp Spiedino. Shrimp arrive on wooden skewers over a mat of veggies. The shrimp was tasty but laden with salt. The texture was ideal, and I liked that the arthropodic flesh had a flavor that subtly changed as it passed over the palate. Still, too salty is too salty.\n\nThe Cavatelli with Rabbit all'Ischitana tasted like store bought pasta with shredded chicken. Boring. Ditto the Maccarona with Ragu Napolitana. Things were getting ominous. Then the entertainment arrived when the Braciole del Portinaio with Eggplant \"Marinara\" numbed the mouths of two of our party members. Right. Just so you know the reason \"marinara\" is in quotes is because they make it with lidocaine (not a traditional ingredient in a marinara). At least the mad harlequin calling the shots in the kitchen was consistent: the braciole was way too salty. \n\nI don't remember the Calcagno a Crosta Liscia, so I guess it was made of yawns. The calcagno was followed by a micro serving of Chocolate Salumi with House Canned Apricots. I really liked the apricot bit. I scarfed it down and lamented that it had been served with hard cheese and adorable apple slices. No matter how cute your apple slices are, if any part of my meal resembles something my mom would put in my lunchbox as a six-year-old, you need to return to the kitchen and a.) light yourself on fire, Buddhist monk style b.) apologize to me and c.) revise your menu. Not necessarily in that order. \n\nI want to take time out of my black fuming to mention the wine that was served with the Salumi. The Cascina Ca'Rossa \"Birbet\" was a delight thing to consume . I think one of my dinner mates said it best: \"If I met a girl and she smelled like this I would marry her.\" \n\nApparently the B&B staff heard my request for an apology because the next bit, the Honey Semifreddo with Huckleberries was a dessert masterpiece. No word on whether there's a smoldering corpse in the kitchen, but it was a noble attempt at an apology. The Semifreddo had a delicate sweetness that perfectly matched the tartness of the huckleberries adorning it.\n\nN.b. the above passages are not all negative. This meal had high points, and besides the braciole none of my food was bad so much as mediocre. Fuck that noise. When I drop two bills the dead better walk and Amaterasu herself better serve my meal. Between the price and the attachment of Mario Batali's name there is no excuse for the meal I ate at B&B Ristorante."

            "review": "Mario...what a huge disappointment.  I was with my boss and another colleague on business and decided on your restorante over many other establishments in the Venetian primarily because I have always respected your cooking on TV but never had the chance to experience it.  After hearing the waiter provide the review of our options, I persuaded the others at the table to go with the Pasta Tasting dishes so we could get a feel of more than one thing.  Not only was everything too salty, but it took at least 45mins to get the 1st dish which was basically a portion so tiny, it took me 2 mouthfuls to eat.  It smelled like bleach, and the plating was very beige and white with nothing high class like I would expect for the price.  45 mins later out next course came out, smaller than the first, looking the same and tasting the same...salty.  After another 20 mins or so for our next course, I was so embarrassed about it all that I felt bad my boss would be paying for it.  He actually said something to the waiter that we had an early morning and could he speed it up.  Another 30mins passed, with 2 more dishes of equally tiny portions, mine being one amount, and the others at the table have either was more, or way less, with the last black spaghetti being the only plate with any real flavor that was worth it.  Only problem was there was barely any there to eat.  How can you justify the price for an amount that is equal to maybe half a dinner plate if it all came out together?  I just don't get it.  The only saving grace was the dessert, but even that looked like the same bland beige looking meal, that was about 3 mouthfuls to finish.  \n\nIt took 3 hours for us to complete our meal, and if it wasn't for the 5 pieces of bread I ate, I would have probably gone to McDonalds to at least get something substantial in my stomach before I went to bed.  After experiencing this, I have a whole other impression of Mario Batali, and it isn't good.  The servers should have been embarassed to serve what they did, and so should you."

Sounds like death, right?\n\nBut it sooo wasn't.  Unless death = heaven (see comment above).  This was my first Mario Batali experience, and honestly, it only came about because my girlfriends + I had made reservations at Nob Hill Tavern, and they ended up remaining closed through Christmas.  So one of the girls said she'd had good experiences before with Mario, and off we went, after making a reservation for that night.  Um, and then proceeding to change the reservation about half an hour before we were due.  Um, and *then* proceeding to be somewhere between half an hour and 45 mins late for that one.  Hey, we're working girls, and something came up requiring some expertise!  (And if you knew our occupations, that's be much less dirty.)  But the hostess and staff were still good to us, despite our tardiness - maybe because it was 2 nights before Christmas, and either the night was slow or they were feeling charitable.\n\nBUT: we skim the menu, and I am overwhelmed.  Personally, I've always gone to Italian restaurants with high expectations, and then, even if I love the food, inevitably think, \"Well, I could have made this.\"\n\nBut none of this I could have made.  Which is *perfection* for me -- I never realize how high maintenance I must be when it comes to food, but ho.ly.cow, I've never been this blown away. I mean, still, and we had dinner on 12/23.\n\nThe pasta tasting menu is seasonal, and this time of year, featured game fowl. Or however that makes sense.  6 \"main\" dishes + two dessert dishes (not pasta, surprise!), which we had been assured would satisfy a healthy appetite, but not put someone in a coma. (Okay, that was paraphrased, but I was concerned because I really can't eat too much with the bebe, she gets unhappy with me.)  Each pasta was like eating air, I've never had pasta so good.  And I mean the pasta.  The sauces -- I think I had one outstanding fave, and a couple I loved, and the rest I enjoyed.  One of my friends asked what we could do about the duck liver ravioli, bc I'm not supposed to eat liver --- our server said he'd check with the chef, AND THE CHEF SAID I COULD SUB OUT FOR WHATEVER DISH I WANTED!  Talk about overwhelmed! Luckily, the server had a rec already planned -- boar ragout? done.  And my fave, by far.\n\nOkay, no one can possibly still be reading, but I'll have to say thanks for these next possible treats: a guy dropped by in a fancy suit to clear a little of our table away, and had some dead-pan, real-guy charm -- not the snooty stuff, not the shmoozy stuff, just real.  Basically commented on the tacky tacky shirts I made the birthday celebrants wear (who doesn't love rhinestones?), and asked what we were in town for + celebrating.  The girls are shy and had only agreed to these outfits if we'd lie + say I was getting married -- and with our cream velour outerwear, it was possible. And I heart weddings, so no prob.  But with the guy -- I came clean and said we were actually celebrating birthdays, plural.  Simple enough conversation.  BUT THEN, before our 7th course (or maybe 8th), our server came by with glasses of the *best* bubbly I have ever sipped (bc I only had a sip) -- Moscato d'Asti, and -- noting I wasn't having any wine -- also a glass of a mango-strawberry frozen concoction.  AND the last dessert had \"Happy Birthday\" written on *all* of the plates in chocolate sauce - I love that attention.  Even though I was the only one not really celebrating anything :D  Whatevs.\n\nLoved it: food, service, attention to detail.  Most extravagant meal I have paid for in my life, but I can totally justify it.\n\nAnd this is terrible of me to throw in at the end, but I can't figure out where to insert it: we were also \"allowed' to add an extra dish to our tasting menu, meaning we got to split it 3-ways: the white alba truffle pasta.  We asked the server to ask the chef how to squeeze it in, and we were surprised it came first.  But what a fantastic, delectable way to start.  Airy.  Truffle-melty.  My only experience with truffle, but it.was.amazing."

Like Osteria Mozza you played WEIRD music. I mean, really, I love Zeppelin, and I REALLY love modest mouse, but when I'm paying as much as I am for a meal, with good company, I want to be able to listen to my dinner companions, not your rockin' iPod. \n\nI started with a simple (albeit expensive) salad... and had the sweet potato ravioli. Which, in all honesty, tasted like butternut squash ravioli.. but whatever. It was good. It wasn't blow my mind good... but it was good. I'm disappointed again, by the complete disregard for vegetarians. More options here than at Osteria Mozza, but still, very very lacking. Still no vegetarian main course, so I always feel cheap when not ordering one.. and then silly when I have to watch other people eat their main course when I don't have one.\n\nOur server was goofy and made inappropriate jokes... which -- hmm... I would expect some professionalism. I make inappropriate jokes too -- but not to my clients. \n\nJust... ookaaayyy... and it SHOULDN'T be just oookaaayyy.. it should be great. and... it just ISN'T."

            "review": "When my sister said that we would be dining at B & B Ristorante in Las Vegas I was really excited. As a big fan of Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich, having dined at Babbo, Osteria Mozza and Pizzaria Mozza many times, my expectations were high. What a huge disappointment. \n\nWe were 4 and we each started off with the Field Greens, a very nice, nothing fancy salad. We then ordered two pastas to share; the Stracchino Ravioli with Leak Ragu and Breadcrumbs and the Homemade Orecchiette with Spicy Lamb Sausage and Rapini. The ravioli was over cooked and under-seasoned and the orecchiette was so salty it was hard to eat. Then the entrees came. My husband and I ordered the ribeye for two. The waiter brought it to the table to show my husband then took it away to slice. My brother-in-law ordered the veal chop and my sister the Short Rib \"al Barolo.\" After slicing the steak (it seem to take forever) they brought all the entrees and NONE of them were hot, not even warm, like they had been sitting. They kindly offered to heat them so 2 of us accepted, but the second time around they weren't much hotter. You can only reheat meat so much without ruining it. Still some of the steak pieces were so raw, fat not rendered, we didn't eat them. The flavors in the entrees were all good, just not hot! For a steak priced at $120 I would expect the cook to be perfect. \n\nThe service was not much better. Our waiter was a fine enough waiter, but was a little on the pushy side telling us how we should order. When my brother-in-law wanted to order a bottle of wine to drink some while we were having Proseco, the waiter told him to wait until he put our order in. The server (waiter assistant?) was officious and pretentious. When the manager came over to ask about our meal she really didn't want to hear that it was cold and offered a half-hearted apology. We just assumed that they thought we were tourist and didn't care that we would not be back. There are so many great restaurants in Las Vegas I highly recommend you pick another."

            "review": "As Las Vegas locals, it's not often we find ourselves going down to the crowded and overpriced hotels on the strip but when we do it's usually for a restaurant.  We never intended on eating at B&B and it ended up being a pretty good experience, however not one that I would do more than once.  My wife and I went down to the Venetian to meet someone who was staying at the hotel for a drink.  We initially set out on a hunt for a bar with a good vibe and possibly some appetizers.  After walking around for a bit we didn't see anything that caught our eye and we were getting hungrier so we ended up at B&B based off of the looks of the place from the outside.  I wouldn't say it was anything special but it looked like a decently nice place that would certainly suffice for what we were after.  We were sat immediately (6:30pm on a Monday) and upon looking at the menu we realized we had picked a pricey restaurant. Here's the quick pros and cons...\n\nPros:\n- Service staff was very friendly and informative.  We all have gluten sensitivities and they were very accommodating.  Not to mention there is quite a bit to choose from that is gluten-free and they offer a gluten-free pasta that they can substitute if you decide you want a pasta dish.\n\n- Wine list was excellent, but pricey.  The wine list was completely in Italian with only Italian wines from what I could tell.  We fancy a Super Tuscan and the cheapest bottle on the list was $135, however even the cheapest bottle is a high end excellent wine.\n\n- The food was very good, no complaints in the taste department.  We started with the salami plate which they charger per person.  We ordered it for 2 people and it was more than enough for all 3 of us.  For the entree two of us got the grilled pork chop and one went with the rabbit.  The portions were decent size, perfect in my opinion, but may be considered small by some standards.  We all had gelato for desert and some flavors, like the lemon, were a little disappointing.  The espresso flavor was excellent though.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of less expensive options on the wine list.  I didn't look at the entire wine list in great detail (it's huge), but from what I saw there wasn't a bottle under $125.  They had a very limited selection of wines by the glass as well and I think most of those, if not all, were North of $15 each.\n\n- The meats section of the entrees was a...unique selection of proteins.  Rabbit, quail, veal, lamb, etc. If you're like me you loved the variety of things you don't see on a menu often but if you're like my two less adventurous companions you're stuck defaulting to the pork chop.\n\n- Price price price.  Our bill came out to around $100 per person not including the bottle of wine we bought or tip. We each had a salad, we all shared an appetizer (salami plate for 2), an a la carte entree, and a gelato dessert.  It was a decent amount of food but if you're really hungry it wont be enough.  And although the food was well done, it wasn't mind blowing.  There are dozens of other restaurants in Vegas with better ambiance, equal food, great wine lists, and much lower prices.\n\nConclusion:\nYou will enjoy a great meal but you will pay too much for it.  The only time I would suggest this restaurant to someone is if they were staying in the Venetian/Palazzo, didn't want to leave the hotel, wanted a nice Italian dinner, and money is no object. Aside from that exact scenario there are much better choices in Vegas."

Unwaivering professionalism,  unobtrusive (yet always there), a knowledge-level of all menu items like I have never experienced. Vegas is mostly fluff and bullshit, B&B isn't.

I was completely disappointed with the experience!\n\nThe Good:\nWe were greeted and seated promptly.\nThe food when eventually served was yummy!\n(Blue crab ravioli, the Americano, and the spicy lamb ragu.)\n\nThe Awful:\nOur waiter Jeffery was unbelievably rude! My aunt and mother requested more detail about the dishes before selecting their main courses and he acted like it was completely beneath him to describe the 3 they were debating between. Once our order was placed he disappeared completely. \n\nJeffery NEVER inquired how our food was or if we needed to add anything to our order.  I had to repeatedly ask our \"water girl\" for refills on drinks and a cocktail menu. At one point I requested an additional glass of wine and it never came. I had to order it 2 more times before it eventually came. \n\nOnce I made it clear how disappointed I was with the service, Jeffery still didn't apologize or offer any explanation for his rude behavior. As someone who works in the customer service industry I'm appalled by our experience at  B&B and embarrassed that I took my Mother there.  For an over $200 meal I really expected more.  Needless to say I won't be making a return visit or recommending this place to anyone!"

Not out of this world good,, and not worth the price good. As for the last course LAMB CHOPS!! it was pretty delicious, but it wasn't mind blowing like I would have loved it to be :( (if it were at the keg it would have blown my socks off but not at mario batali's restaurant ) all in all I wished I had gone to aureole or guy savoy like I intended, but the reservations that accommodated my party didn't accommodate my time :( whatever, over and done with.... \n\nNOT RECOMMENDED FOR FOODIES, AND GREAT FOR TOURISTS!"

            "review": "My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary over the weekend and wanted to find something different since we usually lean towards steakhouses. We enjoyed Carnevino a few months ago and thought we'd try another Mario Batali's restaurant. The overall rating almost turned me off, but I'm glad we took a chance on B & B.\n\nI made a reservation on Open Table for 6:00 on Saturday, but I don't think it was necessary. The restaurant didn't start getting busy until we were finishing up with our dinner. We were seated inside the restaurant at a small table. The seating inside is a little tight, but it wasn't too bad for us since the restaurant wasn't busy at the time we were there.\n\nOur service was friendly, attentive, and unpretentious. Our waitress gave us a nice overview of the menu, tasting menus, wine menu, and specials. She gave us a good idea of what was available without being pushy in any way. Sharing is even encouraged since this is a popular dining style in Italy we were told. Our waitress and her assistant were constantly refilling water, offering bread, clearing plates, and checking on us. They did so without being obtrusive. \n\nTo start the meal we were brought a Chickpea Bruschetta. The crunchy bread with the tapenade and the chickpeas worked together so well. I was surprised how much the flavors popped in this starter. We were also brought fresh bread and oil (hold the balsamic for my picky eater). The bread was warm and crusty, the oil was a quality oil with bold olive flavor.\n\nI went for the Pre Fixe Menu since I knew I wanted to try several items on the menu. The Pre Fixe Menu servings are smaller than the a la carte portions. All courses together it still ended up being more than enough food for me. \n\nThe Butter Lettuce Salad was earthy and the bitter greens on top were almost overwhelming to the other flavors. Almost overwhelming, but the lemon vinaigrette dressing was refreshing and the paste under the butter lettuce was delicious. The Orecchiette was delicious and perfectly al dente. The spicy pork sausage sauce was delicious and had the perfect amount of spice. Our waitress confirmed that most of the pastas are made in house which was evident in the taste. Next up was the Steak Tagliata which was well worth the upcharge. The well seasoned, perfectly charred steak was generously portioned. It wasn't the most tender steak I've had, but the flavor won me over. My husband kept stealing bites of the edges with that perfect char. Lastly, the Pistachio Chocolate Chip Cannoli. I was surprised that this came with two cannoli. The shell was crispy and the filling was light with a nice pistachio flavor.\n\nMy husband started with Garganelli Bolognese which had the most tender, flavorful noodles. This was the dish that tipped me off to the homemade pasta. The Bolognese on top was delicious and meaty. His main entr\u00e9e was the Rabbit Porchetta. This was flavorful with the perfect ratio of meat to fat. I don't eat rabbit and I'm glad that my husband made me try it. Wow! This entr\u00e9e was also a nice portion with six pieces of the porchetta. The dessert of choice for him was Gelato which was creamy and a light sweet to end the meal.\n\nAs if al of the other food wasn't great enough the meal ended with a plate of small sweets. Sweet indeed. Great food and great service!"

By some accounts, some of Mario Batali's kitchens are flagging a skosh in their quality.... that was most assuredly *not* the case when I dined at B&B.\n\nThe meal was a progression of flavors and textures unlike few I have ever enjoyed, yet at its core there remained a solid 'Italian' foundation.  Service was outstanding (something that I've found to be the exception rather than the rule at many of the Vegas outposts of celebrity chef's empires), and the sommelier gracious and helpful.\n\nBeef cheek ravioli, sweetbreads, rabbit.... and those exquisite veal chops!\n\nB&B is, along with the newer Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles, very much 'Babbo West' in its style and execution.

At first the service was very prompt... taking our drink orders,  bringing bread to the table along with a complimentary appetizer.  We ordered the beet salad to share and two pasta dishes as our entrees.  The salad was delicious considering I'd never eaten a beet a day in my life.  Then it happened, the turn for the worst.  We sat and sat and sat some more.  About 45 minutes from the time our salad was finished to the time the pasta's were brought to our table.

For the price of food you would expect better service for a nice tip.

Ok, back to the bread. Instead of leaving a bread basket at your table, there is a lady who comes by (once) and doles out one measly piece of bread to each diner. Considering how long we had to wait for our meal, it would have been nice to at least have a choice to indulge in seconds on bread. 4. The food was disappointing beyond words. My pasta was under-cooked (not al dente, but undercooked) and the lobster that was part of my entr\u00e9e had a rubbery texture and no flavor.  5. The service was lacking. When our waiter asked how our meal was and we told politely told him it was disappointing, he didn't ask any questions or try to find out what was lacking. Instead, he said \"Sorry to hear that\" and quickly left the bill and dashed. B&B Ristorante missed the mark on every level for me. I really feel like this restaurant doesn't care about its patrons having a good and memorable experience; instead, it just preys on the fact that the majority of people who dine there are tourists and they aren't invested in their satisfaction or in them coming back. For a town with so many good restaurants, my advice is to go elsewhere if you want a truly memorable dining experience (I highly recommend Mesa Grill)."

The hostess gave us a very nice quiet table. The server was very familiar with the menu  and provided several good suggestions. The octopus appetizer was the best octopus I have ever had. Next  I had  the goat cheese ravioli ,while my wife had the beef cheek ravioli . It s amazing how well the pasta is cooked at every Batali /Bastianich  restaurant.  For my entree I had the lamb for two ( which could have fed 4 easily). The lamb was succulent ,and grilled root vegetables terrific. For dessert I had the date Napoleon. I love the traditional Napoleon but  this was the best I have ever had.\nMario is a true Master Chef,and culinary genius.  If you are in Vegas and looking for a great place ,try B&B."

They tried to be as attentive as possible. \n\nOne of our party ordered lamb medium rare and it came out medium well which left him waiting for his entree well after we were finished eating. In  the meantime they brought out multiple \"we're sorry about that\" small dishes to him, but in the end it was a disruptive gaffe. \n\nOther dishes were equally underwhelming coming out bland and uninspiring. \n\nI would highly recommend two dishes if you end up here though. One being the grilled octopus. Large portion, perfectly cooked and worth every penny. The other, the bucatini dish was a great plate of pasta. \n\nIn the end I feel that B&B is priced well above it's value. I feel that having  Mario Batali's name attached to it draws more stars than the end result. That being said, it wasn't awful either. The dinner as a whole had some great moments and some bad ones. Either way, it wasn't worth the bloated bill we got at the end of the night."

The name escapes me but I think that there was some pork feet in it. Super tasty and came accompanied with a mesclun salad that had the perfect tangy vinaigrette. I loved my app, so we thought we were off to a great start. For the entree, I ordered the black spaghetti with Njuda and sicilian pesto (the waiter had told me that it was spicy, but this spaghetti was REALLY spicy).  It was so spicy that my mouth was on fire and it completely took away from the rest of the dish which was pretty tasty, I think.  My husband ordered the beef cheek ravioli and although it was very tasty, it was not as exciting as it sounds.  Overall I wouldn't eat here again as there are so many tasty restaurants in Vegas.  Sorry Mario...I'm still a fan of your other restaurants."

They encourage you to buy five courses for each person to really get the full experience but this wasn't the French Laundry, and we weren't about to blow $500 on anything less.  We each got three courses (even though the waiter was trying to bully us into ordering more) and spent close to $300 after tip.  All in all, I'd say that the food was good, but the price was outrageous, especially for what it was.  I've had better food at Jack's La Jolla for half the cost.  Bouchon cost less and it has a Michelin Star.  If you want fine dining, go to French Laundry, don't waste your time and money here.  If you want fine dining in Las Vegas, check out any of the Michelin Star restaurants for a much better dining experience.  If you need to brag to your friends about a famous restaurant you went to in Vegas, check out L'Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon.

Overall the service was excellent, we let them know we only had 2 hours to eat and they got us out right on time. In addition our water glasses never ran out & they folded our napkins every time someone went to the bathroom etc. The server was extremely helpful when we were trying to decide between ordering a la carte and the tasting menu. \n\nWe decided on the below: \n\nStarters: \nGrilled Octopus (amazing, slightly over salty for me) \nGrilled Porcini Mushroom w/ Spicy roasted corn (A must order, a fantastic combo perfectly cooked and seasoned) \nLambs tongue w/ chanterelles (earthy and delicious) \n\nFirst course \nBeef cheek and mushroom ravioli (hearty, very intense meat flavor, not my favorite of the dishes although still quite good) \nSpaghettini aka Spaghetti w/lobster (slightly spicy, very light and fresh tasting, pasta perfectly al dente, lobster also perfectly cooked. Not exactly the most inventive dish but absolutely perfectly executed) \nOxtail Gnocchi (another very hearty dish, very meaty, well executed, but not my favorite as it was a little too rich for my taste) \n\nSecond course \nSteak with spicy greens (forget the cut, my friend really made us look like amateurs when he ordered it, he kept on saying to the waiter to make it charred, the waiter offered to have it extra well cooked, but then my friend said to make it medium but extra charred on the outside and waiter rightfully had some questionable look on his face. The steak came med to med rare, it was quite good, I really prefer mine more rare so hard to say more. Also was a very large portion.) \n\nDuck (came as med rare roasted breast over a stewed leg, huge portion, especially for the price ($32), very good but wasn't blown away either) \n\nVeal Chop (EXCELLENT, you must order this entree. I don't have enough great words to describe it. We got it med-rare, it was perfectly cooked and came with some sort of creamy herby sauce stuff. It was the best meat I've ever had. By a huge margin. It's also a large portion of meat (approx 10-14 oz I'm guessing) served on the bone. Again, just in case I didn't make the point clearly enough before, if you are in Las Vegas, and you eat meat, you must at least come here and order this dish.) \n\nDessert: \nWe had a berry Napoleon something, it was the berriest thing I've ever had. Served with some cold lemon ricotta, I highly recommend this dessert. \n\nAlso, a vanilla flan like dessert with some caramel sauce. It was good but cannot compare to the berry dessert. \n\nCappuccinos here are excellent. \n\nJust a note on the table size, I did not find it too large, but we did order a good portion of food and I was not trying to play footsie under the table. \n\nI would have given it four stars if we had not gotten the veal and the berry dessert."

If you want your mouth to feel like it's in prison, go for it.\n\nThe staff was phenomenal, attentive, and personable. They situated me next to a couple that were marvelous foodies.

Had no choice but to order pre-fixed menu.  The skirt steak was the saltiest dish I've ever had.  It was so salty we could not eat it.  So we asked the waiter to either remake it or change to some other dish.  The waiter got all defensive and reluctantly said ok.  We had to wait over 30 minutes for our food in the first place, but second time around, we had to wait even longer!!!  And when it came out for the second time, it was still too salty and this time the meat was overcooked.  Some of us who opted for quail instead, still had to deal with overcooked meat.  The manager nor waiter never came by to see if we needed anything...they did not even apologize for our inconvenience.  Dessert came so much faster than our coffee...and the biscottis came after we were done with the coffee.  To top it all off, our bill was overcharged by $150!!!!  After the meal, manager (ANDREW) finally came since he had to due to their incompetant math skills, he was unapologetic and gave excuses to every comment we made.  We explained that food being salty can happen but we were more upset about the service, he walked away from us while we were STILL talking!!!  What kind of manager treats their unhappy customers this way.  It was unbelievably immature behavior coming especially from a MANAGER of a professional restaurant...who was supposedl train to oversee the customer to have the best dining experience?  mario batali should be ashamed of such horrible management of his restaurant.

He complained that the cork was too long.... Yes it is a long cork it was a 250.00 bottle of wine that he was destroying.  Next the came out with bread.. one piece per person, cold and no butter, oil or balsamic.  staving we ate the bread.... about 20 min latter the waiter took my order, my wife wanted to have the Pasta sampler, but it said that all people at the table had to have the sampler, so i agreed, I also ordered my dinner of Sweetbreads dusted in cornmeal. After a half hour the first of the pasta arrived, it was supposed to be heirloom tomato spaghetti pasta, don't no...  It was beyond al dente, cold and absent of sauce, must have been a one 1/2 ounce portion per plate, so we figured we were at the french laundry, high price little food, but should be exquisite... nope.... after another 20 min  another spaghetti dish arrived, and this one tasted like ramen noodles, fishy, salty and luke warm. we both just looked at each other and place the plates at the edge, we then we waited.... and waited, I fell asleep... somewhere in my half hour nap, no I wasn't drunk,,, just tired of waiting, a waiter came over, hay I got one more piece of bread out of the guy, it was midnight now and we were the one patrons, I asked id I could have my entree, He told me that he would ask the chef if it was alright to sever the dish out of line,,,, I told him who I was and told him to fire it, service improved a little,  Next out was octopus something pasta, ohhh soooo fishy, they didn't rinse it, and must have been a week old.    My dish came out, it was the only one that was garnished above a Dennys sprig of parsley raviolis came out good but not enough to save this review. My Sweetbreads were deep fried hard in a thick corn meal, sort of like oysters. I ate them because there was nothing else. Then the dessert came, wow I wish the pasty chef was running the kitchen, they were good and came out in a reasonable time.   We ate at the Venician a few times more but stayed away from the Bertalli restaurants, (I was going to try them all but If I want to gamble I STAY IN THE POKER ROOM) I sadly found the food in the food courts to be far superior of  the the food at B&B  Mario... change the staff and food....."

We're both Batali lovers so we were really surprised at how unspecial the food was at B&B.  Very sad, definitely wouldn't go back."

It was super tender and flavorful. \n- Every pasta dish we had was fantastic!  Wonderful flavors and pasta that were cooked just right.\n\nIn addition to the flawless food, we received wonderful service at B&B. We alerted our waiter to our time constraint to catch a flight and he controlled the pace of our dinner to perfection; we even had time for dessert.

So basically its a truffle tasting menu, without truffles $105 or $180 with truffles.....puzzled.\n\nAnyway the none of the dishes were memorable and the only dish i really enjoyed was the pork loin which was so tender and flavorful.  \n\nYou should pass on this one....."

Biting my tongue until it was brining in the sodium caked dog food they call ravioli, hamburger helper they call homemade orecchiette, smear of grits they call polenta, and the shreds of chicken thigh they call rabbit ragu. The only dish that I tasted to be decent at best was the spaghetti and one pound lobster, at least cooked to satisfaction in a balanced sauce. There was lacking of honesty in the dishes that left me questioning how they could get away with it.  Presentation was uninspired, a blop of food on a flat white plate. The ambiance was dreary with low lights in a room heavily decorated with woods and repeated wine bottles. \nI have no qualms to pay for dishes prepared for finer dining with quality ingredients and to taste that amazes me. This fell so disappointingly short.  Worse part was that I felt really sorry for the staff to have to deal with such wishy-washy foods. They tried to accommodate. So sorry it didn't work out... and NO, it is not an acquired taste, it was just awful."

The most shameful part. We were suggested a red wine from Italy, a blend which was absolutely delicious. $22 a glass, which by restaurant standards should make the bottle about $60-$70 retail.

However, I can tell you that the  complimentary bread given to each and every table is terrible (burnt purposefully),  the goose liver ravioli with balsamic vinegar and brown butter was very good and the 6th and 7th courses, the two desert courses, left much to be desired.\n\nThe casual but elegant dining and service were very much to my liking, including the Queen music playing at B&B's adjacent bar.  And, the service was exceptional, as I had expected it to be.\n\nUnfortunately for me, my meal didn't  hit the spot, but it's not the fault of the restaurant.

They have the same thing at Carnevino and it was delicious at B and B as well. It was cooked very tender, and the lemon sauce complimented the octopus very well. This item is a must. I highly recommend it. \n\nThen we went with two of the suggested pastas - Orecchiette with spicy lamb sausage and rapini and the Spaghetti with sweet garlic, chives and lobster. When I had the Orecchiette at Carnevino, it was one of my favorite plates even though it's more of a steak place. I knew B and B's Orecchiette wasn't the same dish but I still wanted to try it. The pasta itself wasn't cooked as well, where it felt more mushy than chewy. The flavor was just fine but nothing memorable. The Lobster Spaghetti was more of a disappointment. The noodles were a bit under cooked, and the chives and parsley completely overpowered the flavors. I was left feeling I could make something better at home and that's not the experience I want if we are spending $30 per plate. The portions of the pasta plates were fair, if not a bit on the small side. You'll definitely need an appetizer. \n\nWe winded down with some cheese for me and espresso for the BF. I'm not a goat cheese fan but most of their selection is goat cheese, so I opted for the Tre Latte which was a blend of goat, cow, and sheep's milk. It was very good. They give you a complimentary box of mini desserts at the end so keep that in mind. \n\nIn the end, everything about the meal and service was good except for the main entrees. Sad to say as a pasta lover but B and B's pasta did not impress me. I left me wishing we went to Carnevino instead."

Service was awful - unacceptable at this price point. Our waiter disappeared several times during the night. Another person had to pick up our table. He was arrogant and rude. The wine recommendation we were given by the sommelier really missed the mark.  The wine was drinking really tight - just the opposite how it was described.

Our server, Kelly, asked us a few questions and got our drink order before leaving us to check the menu and make our choices.  \n\nWhen we ordered, we said we were sharing everything and asked for plates for the splitting.  No problem at all.\n\nWe started with an amuse-bouche of chick peas on lightly toasted bread.  A very nice starter to get the meal off to a tasty start.\n\nFirst up were two starters--warm tripe \"alla\"Romana and country style pat\u00e9.  Both were excellent.  The tripe was cut in small strips that were very tender and the tomato sauce was mild and complimented the tripe perfectly. There was freshly grated cheese on top.   The pat\u00e9, made with pork, was served with blackberry conserve, greens, and cotica.  The pat\u00e9 was very good.  Two nice starters to begin the meal.\n\nFor the pasta course, we got the pork trotter ravioli and the beef cheek ravioli.  They allowed us to order off the tasting menu for the beef cheek ravioli.  For the pork trotter, there was freshly grated cheese.  The beef cheek ravioli was in a sauce of black truffles and crushed duck liver.  Both dishes were superb!  The beef cheek had a hearty flavor of truffle and liver.  The pork trotter had pieces of chive and their blossoms.  The textures in the pork trotter ravioli were great.  Two winners for the pasta course.\n\nFor main courses, we got rabbit porchetta and roasted lamb shoulder.  The rabbit was accompanied by a carrot sformato, sunflower sprouts and crispy confit.  The flavors were excellent and the rabbit was very tasty.  The lamb shoulder was cooked medium rare and served with cannellini beans and some greens.  Both main courses wer outstanding!  Very flavorful, simple yet elegant dishes.  \n\nFor dessert, M ordered the chocolate budino and I ordered a special--peaches and cream.  M's budino was made more like a souffl\u00e9 and the chocolate could have been richer.  The top was pierced and some melted chocolate poured on the top.  The peaches and cream were fantastic!  The dish consisted of lightly grilled peach slices on a bed of mascarpone and a peach sorbet.  A very simple dish executed so nicely.\n\nAfter dinner, we were brought a box with 7 mignardises.  A tasty selection of little bites to end our meal.  \n\nService was outstanding during our meal.  Plates were cleared quickly, new silverware and dishes were brought for each course, and the explanations of the dishes was great!\n\nAfter walking by B&B so many times and looking at the menu, it was really good to try the place.  Eating with a friend also gave me the chance to taste double the amount of items without eating double the amount of food."

The entrees were the Beef Cheek Ravioli and Whole Grilled Branzino. These were polar opposites, and wonderfully complimentary as well. The ravioli was exquisitely rich, with a truffle sauce that was so layered with flavor. The Branzino was grilled whole, presented, and then filleted. It was wonderfully light and simple, and perfectly done. Sampling between the two was a real delight. Dessert was the Bruciato Marscapone, and Dark Chocolate Torta. Also a Yin/Yang combination. The Bruciato light and delicate, and the Torta deeply rich. Our server was both knowledgeable about the food and the menu, patient with our less than sophisticated knowledge of Italian, and truly seemed to love good food. He was most helpful in helping us make our selections, and was right on with all his recommendations. It was a truly great evening. I've always eaten at Bouchon, but this place puts it to shame."

When we arrived, we were immediately seated at a table for two in the back corner.  I was not thrilled with the location but it ended up a good spot where you could see the action of the restaurant and the bar.  Honestly, service started a little slow but picked up and was great by the end.  The pacing was a little off, for instance we received our appetizer prior to receiving our bottle of wine.  And, we ordered a bottle of wine (they only have Italian wines) and the sommilier came over to ask us about our preferences after we ordered.  Unfortunately, what we picked out was not what we would typically order but he kindly suggested a wine in the same price range that suited our tastes...he did not try and upsell.  However, he probably should have been there from the beginning so we would have our wine prior to any of our food.  That is my only complaint.\n\nOn to the food, we received mini chickpea bruchettas on the house and we ordered the grilled octopus to share and it was fantastic.  It was surprisingly tender and the lemon flavor balanced the dish perfectly.  For pastas, we shared the mint love letters with spicy lamb sausage and the beef cheek raviolis.  Honestly, I cannot tell you which one I loved more.  The beef cheek was extremely rich and I was glad to be sharing because I could not have had the entire plate without feeling overwhelmed.  The mint love letters were incredibly unique with a nice mint flavor and a spiciness that merged perfectly.  \n\nFor entrees, I ordered the sweetbreads and my husband had the pork chop.  My sweetbreads were rich (kind of a theme) and delicious and the pork chop was good, but nothing to get too excited about.  We sort of wished we would have just split one more pasta instead of ordering entrees because they were so incredible.  We declined dessert but had the nice tray of petit fours offered at the end of the meal.  Oh, and the wine was fabulous.  We asked them to write the name down for us, but instead they took off the label and put a laminate sheet over it for us to take home.  We thought that was a nice touch.\n\nWe did not even notice the music, so maybe they have that taken care of or maybe it just doesn't bother us.  The servers were very friendly and the manager was helpful when applying our comps to the tab.  We appreciated new silver for every dish and the wooden box they brought it in and the silver tray they used when taking away our glasses.  Our water was always full and we never felt rushed.  All in all, we had a great dining experience and I would not hesitate to return."

I'm slightly picky with food, especially meat, so I had the beet salad and the goat cheese raviolini.  The menu is pretty diverse so be sure to ask a lot of questions.  Our server was really attentive and able to answer our many questions.  \n\nThe layout of the restaurant is simple and elegant.  Lots of dark wood, a huge wall of wine bottles, nice lighting.  My food was pretty good but because it's one of Mario Batali's restaurants, I expected to be blown away.  I can't say that I was, but I also wasn't feeling my absolute best and probably would have enjoyed it a lot more if I was."

            "review": "I heard such rave reviews about B&B from my colleagues back when we came for CES.  I decided that I should give the restaurant a try since we had been gambling at the Venetian.  There was about a ten minute wait, so we decided to grab some drinks at the bar.   At the bar, they have some fantastic, spicy breadsticks that you have to try if you end up going there.  They have a nice kick.\n\nWe decided on the following dishes for dinner (I have attached pictures):\n\nPork trotter on top of greens- I wasn't sure what pork \"trotter\" was and I didn't want to find out.  I was assuming it was feet but I was willing to give it a try.  I really didn't like this dish.  It was breaded on the outside and it seemed like it was filled with potatoes and pork fat. Bleh.  Don't get this.\n\nSpaghettini with Spicy Budding Chives, Sweet Garlic and One-Pound Lobster $31-  For $31, I expected there to be a lot more lobster on the plate.  Where did the one-pound go?  The spaghettini was perfectly cooked al dente, but that's all I can say about it.  \n\nHomemade Orecchiette with Sweet Sausage and Rapini $23-  This is the dish I ordered.  Half of the table liked it, but I found it to be extremely salty and average.  \n\nLinguine with Clams, Pancetta and Hot Chiles $26- Average.  This dish was salty too...guess they forgot that the pancetta would make it salty as well. \n\nGrilled Pork Chop with Cipolline, Artichokes and Vin Cotto $34- The pork chop was very good, probably the best dish we ordered.\n\nI really wanted to like this restaurant, but it didn't do anything for me.  The prices were expensive and the portions were small.  The taste was off in my opinion as well.   There are much better choices for dinner in Vegas."

            "review": "On vacation over Xmas break, and our local friends really recommended this restaurant.\nMy wife and I went with high expectations....we've been to many highend restaurants and I'd consider us very adventurous and open eaters.\n\nWe were very DISAPPOINTED!\n\nMost of the tasting menus that I have tried at other highend restaurants are actually tasting menus that included many dishes that are also available from the a la carte menu.\nThe dishes from these tasting menus are totally different that what is offered on their a la carte menu.\n\nI didn't think much about this disrepancy at the time, and especially because the waitress really recommended the tasting menus, that was what we ordered. They had 2 options, both 7 course dinners for $99.  The first was the pasta tasting menu, which my wife ordered; the 2nd was the regional tasting menu, which i ordered.  Thus we were able to share and taste both tasting menus.\n\nThe pasta tasting menu, to say the least, was GROSS!\nIt started off decently....lamb's brain ravioli, a squid ink pasta; however the main course was totally DISGUSTING!  Duck testicles and liver and cocks combs in a simple pasta.  I am generally very good about eating all sorts of organs and animal parts, however, the stink of the meat was just too much for me.  Usually, a great dish that involves some very stinky meat will try to mask or downgrade the stink of the meat.  This dish, however, really accentuated the stink of the meat to the point that I needed to drink more wine to wash down and get the stinky taste out of my mouth!\nMy wife almost puked at the odor of it after just one bite!\nThe next course wasn't any better....liver ravioli drenched in so much basalmic vinegar that i started coughing as soon as i put it towards my mouth!!\n\nThe regional tasting menu was very similar....a decent first 2 courses which included a simple egg yolk truffle pasta and a rabbit ravioli.  Again, it was the main course that really bordered on inedible....\nI was expecting a nice piece of veal, but what I got was a long strip of veal (really fatty, almost like bacon) which was rolled with chestnuts and anchovies.  It seemed like a great idea, however, it was more fat than veal.  Each bite was pretty much a soggy bite of grease to the point where i just couldn't eat it anymore after 2-3 bites....\n\nTo say the least, my wife and I barely made it through 3-4 courses, and just couldn't take anymore of it....\n\nThe waitress basically directed any concerns immediately to the manager who basically said that it was our fault for ordering something that we either didn't understand or simply didn't enjoy....especially after speaking with the pretentious manager (I believe her name was Melinda), my wife almost left the restaurant in tears.  My wife was so disappointed in our meals, and the manager just didn't seem to care enough to do anything about our unsatisfying experience at the restaurant.  The manager basically insisted that although our meal was totally unsatisfying and borderline GROSS, we had to pay the full price, so for about $300+ for the 2 tasting menus and a bottle of wine, we had one of the most horrible experiences ever at a restaurant.\n\nBottom line:  AVOID THE TASTING MENUS even though the waitress really pushed it.\nAnd if you run into any problems or issues, don't expect a satisfying result because the very pretentious and stubborn manager doesn't believe in satisfying unsatisfied guests.  And the entire situation could end up ruining your vacation as one of the most horrible dining experiences EVER!!!\n\nA restaurant is considered great because of its great service and always consistent quality of food.\nVegas has so many great restaurants....unfortunately, this one just doesn't keep up with them...."

I decided to go with the strichetti special which was spinach infused bow tie.  Started with a house salad which was fairly large and delicious.\n\nStrichetti was served with a pork ragu that was delicious.  No bread with dinner - what gives?  Strichetti was great - you could tell it was fresh.  Nice chunks of pork left me wanting more.\n\nMy gripe above that almost led me to leave 3 stars were the price of drinks.  Food was a little pricey but not bad considering the quality.  Drinks were overpriced and lacking quality.  I started with an Italian beer that was blah and \"ok\" priced for about $10 - which is normal for Las Vegas.  Where I was most disappointed was the wine I had with dinner.  Not many choices by the glass.  I was by myself so was not going to order a bottle.  The red I had was not good - and the price I paid for the glass was more than the price of the bottle if you probably bought it somewhere else.  I expect to have a nice glass or two win a good Italian meal.  Would think Mario could do better here."

She was gracious about it but honestly it was nothing special. I cannot remember what we even had.   The kicker was the wine menu.   No prices on anything,  we didn't want to be cheap so asked our waitress for a glass of red wine each.  She told us about a great little dry red so we each ordered a glass.  Imagine our shock when we got the bill and the wine about $30 per glass!!!!  We're not poor so we didn't have to wash dishes but cmon', when someone orders a glass of wine, you don't expect to pay that much.   We split a salad, an entree and the two glasses of wine.

All I can tell you is I had a really good experience.\nThe waiter we had \"Anthony\" was the most Knowledgeable waiter I have ever had anywhere hands down. He knew everything about the food and all the Green practices of the restaurant. He was a little stiff at the beginning but after engaging him in conversation he brightened up.\nHad the Burrata and Heirloom tomato appetizer w fresh pesto, Delicious. Also combined that with the meat selection for one, pretty good, not spectacular but decent, maybe ordering it for 2,3,4 is better. But one thing about it the pickled vegetable on it were horrible. Ok onto main courses....\nHad the Papparadelle Bolognese, I thought it was great. Fresh wide ribbons dressed with a delicious meat sauce and freshly grated Reggiano Parmegiano . It wasn't piled on meat sauce like in american italian restaurants, the pasta was dressed in meat sauce like you would get in Italy. with a glass of red wine perfect. Next had a pork loin special with fingerling potatoes and arugula salad with a pan reduction sauce. It was too much food but very good, the sauce excellent and the potatoes crispy salty and delicious. Cappuccino excellent, Biscotti terrible. \nBut its interesting that people don't like B&B because I went to Mario's causal place in the Venetian and it was the worst pizza I ever had."

            "review": "Long story short, I ended up going here two days in a row.\n\nNight 1 - Went with a large group. Waitress was spot on and service as a whole was solid. In fact it was borderline invasive at times, but that's ok. The waitress told us that the octopus appetizer would be the best thing we ever ate. None of us felt that way after eating it. It was definitely good, but not even close to the best thing any of us ever ate. I wish she didn't oversell it because I would have preferred ordering something else. We also got the calamari as an app and that too was good not great. Best thing about it was the cauliflower. The waitress also brought out some bruschetta  with a chickpea spread. The spread was meh and the bruschetta was so hard it would have cracked a tooth or cut up my mouth so I did not eat it. For my main course I ordered the black spaghetti. Again, good but not great. Of the 7 people at my table (a couple being foodies) no one was overly impressed by the food. As for dessert, that was an abject failure. Nearly everything on the menu was made with blood oranges. Maybe some people like those, but I am repulsed by the taste. No dessert for me.\n\nNight 2 - For an app I had the gnocchi w/ wild boar ragu. This was pretty good. I got the braised short rib. Definitely decent, but it tasted no better than a neighborhood restaurant in my home town. I'd have expected more from a place with two accomplished restauranteurs. \n\nOne major sore point for me was on both nights, each server pushed me to drink. The waitress on the first night did so in a funny and passive aggressive way and that didn't bother me much. However, on the second night the waiter we had acted coldly towards us when no one ordered alcohol. What a turn off. \n\nBottom line, I've been to much better restaurants with a whole lot less pretentiousness  and that were much cheaper. Granted, the ingredients at B&B were top quality and the experience is on par with any fine dinning experience, but the most important thing, the food, was short of impressive."

She was very well behaved and patient throughout the entire meal.\n\nWe ordered a mixed green salad to start and it was simple and delicious.

When we asked for plain pasta, we were again informed that the chef would not serve it that way.\n\nNote:  The server never asked the chef ... he just let us know that there would not be any accommodations or special orders.\n\nSo I ordered the beef cheek ravioli with truffle sauce.  \n\nMy meal was the the color of poo when they put it in front of me.  The ravioli turned the color of the sauce and it did not look good. I was not impressed and I was not inclined to eat much of it once I tasted it. Yuck. \n\nMy husband and my daughter had the goat cheese ravioli and that was much better.  I was wishing I had that instead.  But the waiter never came back to check on us and eventually someone came to clear the plates away.  Bye Bye crap. No one even noticed that I did not eat any of it ... they just took it away without a second thought.\n\nWhen the waiter did finally come back, we asked for the check. We asked if we could charge it to our room, and the waiter said that it would take 10 minutes to get the manager to approve it.  We pulled out a credit card instead of waiting since we were looking forward to getting out of there.  Just like other Yelpers said, it was disappointing, expensive and pretentious.

We came in on a Sunday night after being at Nascar all day, we had reservations for 7pm for a table of 5.  We get there at 7, and they say we are going to have to wait... so we wait...and wait... then about 15 minutes later the hostess takes us to our table and starts putting down the menus... but I say that \"there are 5 of us, and this table is for 4\" and she says \"oh it was suppose to be set for 5\" this is CLEARLY a 4 top, there is NO WAY 5 people could sit at this table, so then she parades us through the restaurant (really embarrassing it is a tiny restaurant) and we have to go stand outside again to wait for another table, then we parade back in to be seated at a huge table for like 8 people.  Whatever, so we start to order and the Sommelier  immediately comes over, before we have even looked at the menu or thought about what we are going to eat, further I am not sure if he was even old enough to drink.  And he only suggested bottles that were over $200 (for a Sunday night?  Puhhhleese), we told him to give us a break and we would figure it out!  Food was great (Italian but do not expect spaghetti and meatballs, we had squid ink pasta and rabbit, the rabbit was really good, as well as the beef cheeks), but the music, which seems to be a pretty common complaint, was a bit of a distraction after I realized it was coming from inside the restaurant not in the Casino.  If you like 70/80s rock you will be in Heaven!   We tried it, we wont be going back..."

The menu seemed similar to Babbo in NYC (which requires very advanced reservation) so I was excited to try B&B and was able to make the reservation the day of.  \n\nThe amuse with chickpeas was nice but nothing special. \n\nWe started with the special of the day app, which were the fried squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese.  I usually don't see this on most restaurant menus so I was excited that this item was on the special menu. They light and I loved the sauce they were on.  I think it was around $18 or so for 4 blossoms.  Ouch.\n\nWe went with the seafood theme so we both ordered the lobster pasta.  I was not impressed.  The sauce was just ok, it didn't taste very fresh to me.   There are several Italian places in NYC that I think would make a better version. \n\nFor the main, we shared the grilled branzino.  It's simply grilled fish, nothing special.  What really shined and was memorable was the herb salad that accompanied the fish.  Unfortunately, there was only about a tablespoon of it.\n\nPerhaps they're better with meat items but considering that we paid about $200 (without wine, and 1 dessert) for 2, I expected more.  If the price was lower then I would have given 3 starts but the price doesn't justify the quality.\n\nPerhaps they're catering to tourists and not local repeat customers which explains the quality but I guess I'll have to make that reservation at Babbo to find out.\n\nOverall, the experience was utterly mediocre for the price."

Being the pasta fiend, we ordered 4 pasta dishes to share instead of any appetizers or entrees. It was hard to pick since there were about 15 different pasta dishes that all sounded awesome. I really loved the mint love letters - very different from what you would typically see at any normal Italian joint. The best way to describe it would be a ravioli filled with mint pesto. It was fantastic. The other dish that was very original and I can't totally recommend it is the squid ink pasta. It was super tasty but it was hotter than hell. I could not believe you could get food this hot at an Italian restaurant. And this coming from a girl who loves spicy food and has eaten thai chilli peppers raw and unadorned means it was fiercely spicy. Funny because the waiter warned us but usually when people say that its still not spicy for me. Boy was I wrong.\n\nGreat wine list also. Mario always puts on a nice spread for his guests."

Service was impressive with armies of servers marching through with plates and the coordinated delivery of all plates at once, but our lead server lacked the in depth knowledge of the menu I might have liked. Sound levels were fine. Ambience was a little \"street cafe\" like due to its open side on the Venetian walkway.

My better half and I landed in Vegas at 10pm on the Sunday after Thanksgiving and headed straight to our late night reservation. Given the timing of our dinner and the holiday weekend, rounding up seems fair.\n\nI am a big fan of Batali's LA outpost Mozza, so I was excited to try this vegas incarnation. The menus are quite similar, but the atmosphere at B&B is a little lacking. I was surprised that the space was as small as it is and that most tables were right on the \"main drag\" of the admittedly beautiful Venetian hotel. That being said, it kinda creates an effect of eating at an upscale mall in the OC. And the space just isn't as nice as Mozza.\n\nThe food is awesome! Even without the cheese bar. Some of the dishes seemed quite similar, though, to dishes at Mozza. They had an amazing regional and seasonal tasting menu (Piemonte), but given the late hour we opted on a few courses from the main menu. We shared our first two courses and ordered individual secondi, but the server misunderstood and split one between us. It was quail which we both love, so it worked out. I would have been harder on them if I were not completely stuffed. It was, afterall, the end of Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nOverall, again I am positively alotting four stars for my first experience at B&B. I had the notion that we would walk in and leave Vegas behind, but it felt very Vegas from an ambience (guys in ball caps) standpoint. The server was nice and earnest but did misunderstand us and seemed like she was trained to talk to tourists, \"...with pancetta, or Italian bacon.\" A lot of unnecessary translations, but it was kinda cute. The bread offerings were good and we received comlimentary sweets at the end. Food stellar, but overall not what I expected compared to Mozza."

Than split the Gorgonzola tortoloni, which was a nice refreshment course of lighter flavors after the intense flavors of the ribs. We than had the best bolognaise I have probably ever had, and followed that with an incredibly tender melt in your mouth short rib served with polenta. Our desert was phenomenal as well as very light. The apple fritters tasted delicious.\n\nThe food, incredible, the service was also phenomenal. Our waiter was extremely knowledgable, no doubt an expert in the business that is probably a career here in Vegas. He timed our courses appropriately, though some might consider it slow in our fast paced lives, this is how people eat elsewhere.\n\nI don't understand the poor reviews.

Our server checked to make sure we liked spicy, and he was absolutely correct.  The black spaghetti was very, very spicy and so, so good!  Our friend couldn't finish it, and we took it home hoping to enjoy it the next day.

Had a nice meal here, but was disappointing at several levels.\n\nTo start off, I was presented with a chickpea amusee, which tasted nice, but was kind of earthen in flavor and didn't really awaken the palate. \n\nI had the Beef Cheeks Ravioli to start. It was a decent dish, the beef cheeks and liver was tasty, and though I saw 2 mini slivers of truffle, I couldn't detect any of its perfume - they might as well not have been there. It was a little heavy but was over all a decent dish. Though in hind sight I should have ordered the tripe, the ravioli was nice but not exciting. The flavor profile was kind of monotoned throughout -- if only it had more umame, perhaps I was supposed to add on 5g of truffle at $15/g? \n\nI followed that with the Crispy polenta sweetbreads. Sounded nice on paper, but the polenta coating on the sweetbreads turned up hard and unappealing. The sweetbreads were well cooked though and were nice and moist, however, to my surprise, it was completely under seasoned. I don't mean that they didn't put enough salt, I think they forgot to salt it completely. I think the polenta coating might have a little bit of salt, either that or the salting was uneven. The mushrooms and sweetpotato (?I think?) puree was completely unseasoned. I wanted to ask for a bit of salt, but didn't want to seem like one of those annoying dicks that terrorize the wait staff at restaurants. \n\nFor desert, I was recommended a mascapone based desert - it was made like a creme brulee, and was delicious. \n\nThe service was good, perhaps even above average for las vegas.\n\nSo 3 stars because the chick peas amusee wasn't very amusing and the sweetbreads were under seasoned. Decent restaurant, but I wouldn't rave about it."

See my other reviews on what I think about his NYC places.\n\nHave an agency who wants to buy me a meal, so I said how about that while walking by.   Let me start by saying, it does not equal Babbo or Lupa in NYC, but everything we had was really, really good.  \n\nSome of the items\nA N T I P A S T I:\nThe Three Goat Cheese Truffles were good, but not overwhelming.  The Octopus with soy ginger was perfectly cooked.\nA pork trotter pancake thing - yum!  Fatty meat rolled in panko, smashed flat and fried.\n\nPrimi:\nEveryone's favorite pasta was the one I ordered - Stinging Nettle Pappardelle with Wild Boar Ragu. I have been wanting to make a stinging nettle pasta (we see it often in the spring where we go mushroom hunting) and am even more inspired now.  It has such a nice, light, but complex vegetal flavor.  And boar - need I say more pig lovers.\n\nSecondi:\nThere was a quail honey roast that was insane. Absolutely hands down one of the best pieces of white bird meat I have put in my mouth. \nI decided to go a bit crazy as I was not paying for dinner and ordered - Fennel Dusted Sweetbreads with Sweet and Sour Onions, Duck Bacon and Membrillo Vinegar.  It was amazing!  They were like the lightest, sweetest chicken-like nuggets with sweet ducky back - WOW!  I want more thinking about it.\n\nWine:\nI like how they offer Quartinos - .25 of a liter - of wine - basically 1.5 glasses. We were able to order a variety of these to try amongst the 5 of us which was fun to contrast with the bottles of wine we also consumed.  Which lead us back to my new love -  the General Mgr - Lori.  She came by to check on us and we started talking about food and wine at the beginning of the meal and she was able to make some great pairing recommendations based on her past life as a Som in NYC.  Very, very friendly and a total foodie.  We ended up shutting the place down because she kept recommending different course and wines to try.  None of us wanted to leave.\n\nThey had a chef's menu and pasta menu for the night with pairings, but I am sure it would not have come close to just letting Lori offer some suggestions.\n\nJust make it easy on yourself in this Mario does desert living place and ask for Lori to make food and wine recommendations.\n\nSide note - she actually joined us for a drink the next night to talk more food and wine."

Who doesn't love this guy and his orange crocs!!\n\nSo you are in Vegas and you're thinking okay this is going to be amazing considering his reputation. I was set on trying there Gnocchi, it was such a waste of 30 dollars. I mean there was about 15 gnocchi on the dish in a sauce with no flavor supposed to be a butter sauce but that was flavorless. It had beans and the beans were good it just didnt go with the gnocchi. They gave me one slice of bread with my meal and one complimentary small bruschetta that was bland and had a bunch of cold chickpeas on top. I mean the gnocchi had beans and  ham hock it was just so wrong. The \"Ham Hock\" was chewy and rough, and tasted like a chorizo gone wrong! I was so upset because I watch all his shows I watch him on food network and I love his cooking. I'm not sure why the food is of such poor quality. Specifically the Gnocchi but, if that was bad I don't want anything else. \n\nThe service was exceptional the waiters/waitress can read the menu upside down backwards there so competent but its the food that is not worth it.\n\nDO NOT GO, SERIOUSLY. TAKE YOUR MONEY THROW IT INTO THE BELLAGIO FOUNTAINS IT WILL PROBABLY GO TO BETTER USE. \n\nIf you go back, go back for the complimentary dessert squares at the end that you need a  magnifying glass to see, its like 5 pieces some are tasty others just so gross."

The food was all fantastic and they really let us take our time and enjoy each course slowly, which I enjoyed (they had asked if we had any later commitments, like any shows we were seeing....I assume they would have sped things up if we had said yes, but we enjoyed taking our time here). Fantastic food, great service, but it's definitely pricey!

Let me tell you the restaurant did not let us down.  From the appetizers to desserts everything was excellent.  Appetizers included Warm Lamb's Tongue with Chanterelles and a 3-Minute Egg, Grilled Octopus with 'Fagioli Marinati' and Spicy Limoncello Vinaigrette, Bone Marrow Ravioli with Osso Bucco Ragu.  My main entree was the Grilled Pork Chop with Rhubarb Mostarda and Mustard Greens, THE juiciest pork chop I or you will ever have.  The restaurant butchers their own pork chops in house and according to our waiter, they leave more of the pork fat on the chop than they now do in other source of pork do.  Other entrees ordered included: Rabbit Porchetta with Chianti Braised Carrots, Winter Roots Salad and Walnut Vinaigrette, Grilled Pork Belly with Wickson Apples and Caramelized Onion Jam, Grilled Sweetbreads with Leeks, Apples, and Mustard Veal Jus, Squab \"al Mattone\" with Truffled Crema Fritta and Chanterelle Ragu. The Sommelier had good suggestions to pair with our entrees.  They even made an off menu item for my niece who doesn't like anything other than Alfredo pasta."

If I only  came to eat just that, then my trip to this restaurant would be fulfilled.  I typically never eat octopus, unless someone else orders for me or to be shared in a group.  My wife and I were influenced by our waiter who highly recommended this appetizer.  However a warning, that this octopus is not your typical rubbery texture, if that is what you are expecting do not order this fine, exquisite dish of enjoyment.  \n\nGnocchi with Braised Oxtail was fantastic and was reminiscent of the flavors we experienced in Sienna Italy.  If you have had oxtail before I would highly recommend this dish.  If you have never had oxtail, then step out of your comfort zone and try this dish.  Oxtail is dish that I would typically only order in Italy, however this homemade gnocchi with perfectly chunks of shredded braised oxtail encased with a strong pungent flavored  sauce.  The gnocchi was obviously homemade and perfectly prepared.  \n\nWild Alaskan King Salmon with Agretti and Almonds was way too salty for my tastes, however it was not over cooked.  \n\nMy FAVS:\n1. Grilled Octopus with 'Borlotti Marinati' and Spicy Limoncello Vinaigrette - a must order!  Pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-hUvO0C0A-pGZdiSKvjoFw?select=5ATc2lLZ-fg0ljIgLvjrlw \nthis dish is served at other Mario Batali restaurants - Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles CA & Babbo Ristorante e Enoteca in New York NY.  \n2. Gnocchi with Braised Oxtail - I would order this anytime!\n3. Dessert: Chocolate Strawberry Torta with Strawberry Sorbetto - great for chocolate lovers. The B\u00f4net with Lavender Flowers I heard is terrific. \n4. Cappuccino - was so terrific, I had to order 2. It was hard to find a decent cap in Vegas.\n\nService was excellent, we asked to be re-seated in another area and it was not problem.  I recommend a cozy booth/table.  We sat next to a wonderful group of people that turned out were from a neighboring town back home.  They enjoyed the B\u00f4net with Lavender Flowers - dessert.  \n\nRecommendations: If you love wine, get a reservation and have them decant your favorite wine ahead of time.  A wonderful selection of Brunello De Montalcino, obviously any from 97 \"year of the gods\", or a 99, or 01.  On a budget, order the Morellino di Scansano, Perazzi La Mozza 2006 Toscana which I think is from one of Mario's vineyard in Tuscany.  \n\n$$$ to $$$$\nIf you are ordering wine and dessert, it is more so $$$$."

(the other was Gordon Ramsay's \"Steak\").  we thought another Batali joint was a no brainer, until i read some of the reviews here.  i generally ignore the comments left by cheap asses like, \"oh, how dare they charge us for coffee!\"  (see below.)  but comments about the flavoring of the dishes i pay attention to.  that's why i was shocked at all the comments about how salty the food was.  perhaps the restaurant took note and changed things up; perhaps those reviewers have a phobia of flavor.  who knows bc our experience was phenomenal and only solidified our fanboy/girl status for the heavyset, croc wearin italian.\n\nservice was perfect.  our server was enthusiastic, extremely knowledgeable, and attentive, albeit his moustache was a little creepy.  i tried the beef cheek ravioli w/ truffle and duck liver.  delish.  uber rich w/ its velvety meat filling w/ a hint of mineral-y liver goodness.  YUM.\n\nmy wife had the bolognese.  she loved it.  i loved it.  it was freaking tasty.  the flavor was delicate, simple and complex at the same time.  the base tomato sauce tasted very close to the ox tail pasta dish at osteria, which was both adore.\n\ni then tried the pork belly.  it was served w/ arugula, heirloom tomatoes, and drizzled w/ that famous 20something year old balsamic.  i was blown away.  the generously sized log-o-meat was fatty, moist, and robust in porky goodness.  highly recommended.  the hints of that sweet and tangy balsamic, the bitter arugula, and juicy sweet warm tomato slices on the bottom, perfectly balanced out the richness of the belly.\n\nwe finished the meal off w/ some gelati and sorbetto.  espresso, peach and strawberry.  gawddamn!  probably the best we've ever had.  we were also served an amuse bouche (chickpea bruschetta) at the beginning of the meal and an additional dessert medley at the end, complimentary.  the perfect meal!"

            "review": "My wife and I had dinner here a few weeks ago.  We're big fans of Babbo in NYC, and B&B is basically Babbo transplated to Vegas.  Great food, great service, and an all around good experience.\n\nThe service here is excellent.  They pace the courses so that you have plenty of time to enjoy your food and wine.  For some, that may be a bit too slow, as you're waiting between courses.  But that is the pace that my wife and I really enjoy, so we can have some drinks and talk.  Overall, it's about two hours for the whole meal.  The waitress was very knowledgeable and very helpful, and the overall service is attentive but unobtrusive.  \n\nThe wine list is 100% italian wines, which my wife and I know very little about.  So we took advantage of the sommelier who picked a really good wine for us.  The nice thing about this sommellier is that he asked us for our preferences and familiarity, then proceeded to recommend a range of wines.  Some leaning towards my preferences, some towards my wifes, and some he identified as good compromise wines.  He also picked a wide range of price points, which was also nice.  The one we ended up picking from his recommendations was excellent.\n\nThe setting is nice, but it's along a fairly busy area of the casino.  So even though the lights are dim and they play nice music in the restaurant, you occasionally get a lot of noise coming from the outside.  This might be nice if you want to people-watch, I guess.  It's not nearly as quaint as the townhouse Babbo is in, but it is a nice setting overall.\n\nThe food is great.  They do a full three course meal here (four if you get desert, five if you count the complimentary appetizer).  The menu also has sides that you can order, so if you wanted to just get one dish and some sides you can do that too.\n\nBetween my wife and I, we had:\n-Complimentary appetizer.  This is too big to be an amuse bouche.  It's basically a crostini with garbanzo beans and some kind of dressing/paste on it.  Very good, but the beans were really cold, as if they'd just been taken out of the a fridge or off ice.  It still tasted good but the coldness was a bit off-putting.\n-Grilled octopus in limoncello vinaigrette.  Amazing dish, the octopus was very tender and the dressing was excellent.  You basically get the whole octopus too; I was surprised at how much was on that plate.  This was probably the best dish we had all night, although the rest of the food was great too.\n-Rabbit Confit crostone.  This was a grilled piece of bread with a salad and rabbit confit on top.  I thought they skimped a bit on the rabbit but it was still excellent.\n-Beef cheek ravioli with truffle sauce.  I was surprised by this dish; it was extremely beefy and unusually creamy.  It had really big bits of shaved truffle on it.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I think the texture might throw other people off.  \n-Squash lune with amaretti cookie.  We've had a very similar dish at Babbo, and this was just as good.  It's basically a squash ravioli with an almond cookie shaved on top.  It sounds odd, but it's very good.\n-Orange duck.  This was very good, but they serve it with the skin on so it's quite fatty.  I don't know what they do, but the duck is really infused with orange.  Very good, but I had to stop eating because the fatty duck was a bit too much for me.\n-Grilled halibut.  They manage to make the skin on it super-crispy.  Like potato-chip crispy.  It was served with some type of cherry tomatoes that were very potent in flavor.  Again, a great dish.\n\nOne tip is that their limoncello is house-made and excellent, but not always on the menu.  So be sure to ask for it if you enjoy limoncello."

I expected more people there because it's a Mario Batali/Joe Bastianich restaurant, and we were in Vegas, and so I made reservations. Turns out, they were completely unnecessary.\n\nFirst thing that came to our table: chickpea bruchetta.\nThis was amazeballs. It was so good. Seasoned and perfectly cooked chickpeas with basil on toasted bread. I was surprised at how good it was because I'm usually not a fan of chickpeas. \n\nI got the lamb and rapini (broccoli rabe) oricchette. I found it to be a little salty, but nothing I couldn't overcome. Of course I took the \"chef recommendations\" and added whatever they told me to. \n\nFor dessert, I got the lemon budino. It's basically a lemon souffle, for anyone who doesn't know what a budino is. I had to google it before I ordered. I didn't think it was very good.. It was too tart for me, and the honey didn't really help. Maybe I was already overstuffed from all the deliciousness that I had been eating previously. Dessert also came with a complementary nine bites. Unfortunately, due to my chocolate allergy, half of them were inedible, and the other half I assumed were contaminated by just being in the same bowl or storage unit as all the others. \n\nEven though dessert seemed disappointing, I'm not deducting a star. Why? Because the service was completely amazing. Everyone working was so helpful, so kind, and so attentive. My fiance dropped his napkin on the floor while heading to the bathroom, and by the time he came back it was replaced. We ordered a bottle of wine, and the sommelier was very knowledgeable about the wine we got, and attentive enough to notice that we weren't there to spend more than $50 on a bottle. I've tried to find the wine we got there, just to have in our wine rack as a commemorative bottle or two, but unfortunately I've been unable to find it at our local Specs. \n\nThe next time I'm in Vegas, I'll either make it a point to come to this restaurant again, or at least show up to a different B&B restaurant. Such as Carnevino. But this was so good that I might be back without any questions. Maybe I'll just go to both."

Wow -- what a surprise.  \n\nWe also had the Lamb's tongue, the duck egg, the parm reg sformato, the pork trotter and the salumi.  Of this bunch, I could have taken a bath in the Sformato.  It was divine. \n\nPastas:  we had the corzetti with rabbit, mint love letters, pappardelle with wild boar ragu and the lingune with crab and jalapeno and the chef sent us from his tasting menu the uni ravioli.  \n\nAmazingly, my husband ordered more...the rabbit and sweetbreads -- I was officially done, although I had to try the cardoons (never had them before and it was making me crazy).\n\nAll I wanted at this point -- because we had reservations to go to Love after this (and I really just wanted to lie on the floor...) was a very large espresso and a limoncello...but noooo, dessert came -- salted caramel gelato, grappa poached pears, cheese, chocolate... \n\nFood coma is an understatement -- but every bite was truly delicious -- even though I couldn't eat for two days afterwards...I can't wait to go back -- and am planning to take my Mother again this weekend (we saw two cozy seats at the bar that looked perfect for an easy supper...)\n\nI just wish I could deal with the drama of the strip (and had a larger bank account), I'd probably be much more of a regular.  \n\nWe watched them work every table -- we love their team service.  Yes, the bathrooms were lovely.  \n\nThe dining room decor was surprising to us -- how the designers can turn such an impossible space into a charming, romantic, intimate restaurant that feels \"real\" and not staged -- and like it's been there forever is amazing to me -- the magic of Vegas -- the heart of Rob Goldstein -- and eyes (and stomachs) of Mario and the Bastianich family and the wallet of Sheldon Adelson get my fondest congratulations and thanks!"

Even loved the modern music they played for ambience. But the food didn't hold a candle to Carnevino.\nWe started with a few specialty cocktails which were very good. We noticed a few similar items that both restaurants share. We wanted to try some different dishes. \nBefore our meal we were presented with a Chickpea Bruschetta compliments of the chef...I'm not a big fan of chickpeas, but it was delicious. \nTo start we decided to share the Housemade Ricotta with Olivestri Olio Nuovo and Tuscan Kale, accompanied by nice crusty bread,  the ricotta was so light and the oil and kale was so flavorful, they complimented each other perfectly.\nWe had Bucatini 'all'Amatriciana at Carnevino and it was so good, we decided to get it again and compare the two. It was not as good, but it did seem to have more bacon. We also got Jose's Pyramids, which are a sort of ravioli stuffed with short rib beef. The pasta was nice, the meat was a bit dry and bland and I didn't care for the sauce, I felt like it was missing something. So when I dipped one in the sauce from the Bucatini al'Amatriciana, it was so much better, they need to hire me.\nWe quit there and decided on some dessert, we shared one of the nights specials which was a Apple Crostini with Vanilla bean Gelato. The gelato was perfect, the apple crostini was good, but the sauce it was served with was a bit strong and overpowered the dish. We were presented with a complimentary dessert sampler of multiple tiny bites, I liked the Meringue and the Pistachio Chew. My husband liked the Chocolate cake.  \nNot worth the money like Carnevino."

I'm really sad to see the negative reviews for this place. I've been here 5 times and it is always consistently good. Sometimes we sit at the bar and sometimes inside. Service has always been wonderful and the food has always been top notch. \n\nIf you want more laid back and there aren't a lot of you, I highly suggest sitting at the bar. Jason the bartender is great and remembers when you when you return. Even the other one I've seen there is great but just don't see him as often. You order off the regular menu. \n\nFirst off, the grilled octopus antipasto to start off with is great. Don't bother sharing. You'll want this one all to yourself. It's not a lot if you look at the pics. It is so tender. The grilling is excellent. I just can't say enough about it. Just get it. Ive never had octopus like that and probably won't. It's unique. \n\nNext off is their gelato. OMG!!!  So much better than anything I had in Italy and I ate A LOT of gelato in Italy. The only thing that beat b&b's was the homemade white peach gelato I had on a wine/olive oil tour. Flavors change seasonally at B&B so you'll always get to try new ones. \n\nTheir primis (1st course pasta dishes) have never let me down. So far we've tried 4 of them an have always been pleased. The bavette, gnocchi with summer veggies, linguini with clams, and one more that I can't remember the name of are all good. Because they are only meant as a primi, potions aren't the normal huge size. Like the Italians, they keep the portions manageable. \n\nI can't say enough about how great this place is. The service is always good and the food is excellent. Some say the prices are high but I think they match the high quality food and experience you get. It's worth it. I rarely give 5 stars to a place. B&B deserves every one of those stars."

But, you can still have an outstanding meal with a pretty good market value without feeling abused.  A romantic laidback place with music from Stevie Ray Vaughn then Prince makes for a comfy place.\n\nWe were hungry but split everything, as we often do. You know the portions are gonna be ample, and this way, you can try more things to sample. And though their policy is not split stuff, just ask, it's no big deal. They'll be happy to do it.\n\nThe Spaghettini with Spicy Budding Chives, Sweet Garlic and One Pound Lobster was simple yet soo good. Imagine a light arribiatta sauce, yet when I mentioned as much to our server, well, she had never heard of arrabiatta. Oh well. In fact, our server was fine, but we loved the teamwork provided by (what musta been) the manager, who kept the momentum of our meal and seemed to offer good information when asked.\n\nWe also had the Branzino, which I see 50% of the Yelpers also enjoyed. 'Nuff said. We loved it, and it was plenty big to share. We also enjoyed the side of squash---normally not a squash fan--and it sounds better than just 'squash'.  And it was perfect. \n\nEnded with the warm chocolate budino, a nice way to go. Their coffees were great; wine was divine, and their martini was made to order and a better deal than the same in L.A.  The whole place was as tasty and laidback as a Hatfields. When we're in Vegas again, we'd go back to B&B in a flash."

This place may be slipping as evidenced by the light crowd on a Saturday night.  There was some good, the grilled octopus was great and we also enjoyed the spicy two minute calamari.  But the pasta was very disappointing, especially the linguini with clams.  There was a celery flavor that was so strong it was almost hard to eat.  The bolognese was watery and scarce.  These pasta dishes just didn't taste very good.\n\nThe experience was made worse by the service.  After getting our initial order, our server never once checked in on us again.  Bread was dropped off with no butter or oil. We had to ask for utensils. And its not as if the place was too busy to keep up.  There was an attentive sommelier that ended up bringing us butter, water, etc. when our server was missing.\n\nThere are so many good places in Vegas to try, I don't believe we will return."

(Note that everyone at the table has to do the tasting menu if one person does.)\n\nThe two of us opted for three antipasti and three pastas. The menu was covered in lamb, which makes sense seasonally, but meant I sort of struggled to figure out how to order without lamb in multiple dishes; perhaps part of why we opted out of a meat dish.\n\nThe best dish was the grilled octopus: deliciously charred and flavorful. Thanks to our waiter for recommending it!  I might order two when we come back. The beet salad was the weakest dish; it was missing something: needed some balsamic or lemon or something to kick it up a notch from simply roasted beets. The house made speck (similar to prosciutto) with pluots (hello stone fruit season!) was tasty: the speck was soft and melt in your mouth.\n\nFor pasta, we ordered the orecchiette with lamb sausage, and it was delicious, but slightly over salted. That didn't stop me from cleaning the plate! The linguine with clams was the best we have had in a long time: the pasta was boldly al dente, which we liked, and had a taste of the sea (sea salty?): interesting that this one didn't seem \"over salty\" compared to the orecchiette. The final pasta was a tagliatelle with sweet corn, a tasty, buttery but somehow not too heavy or rich dish, and I was impressed that somehow the pasta seemed to infused with corn flavor, even when taking bites without the corn.\n\nCouldn't give five stars due to the plain beets and oversalting, but will definitely be back."

Burnt food, over salty food. I just never had a bad meal and thought maybe those that revied it might have been too picky. That was until I ate there on Friday. Some of the food was so bad we did not eat it. My favorite dish has been the Gnocchi since my first time at B&B. This time it was so salty you could not finish eating it. The mint love letters where also gross this time around. Nothing like my past visits. Even the bread was different and served cold. There was five of us. Our server talked down to us like we where stupid morons. I had asked if we could eat our pasta family style so we could all share. We had orded 5 pasta dishes. Mario has always said food is to be sharred. Even the article about B&B on the Venetians site talks about passing plates. Our server would not give us extra plates or a serving spoon so we could all have a taste. I guess the Los Angles Times people are morons too and they should take that article off the site. I was embarrased that I recomended the restaurant. What pisses me off the most is we were forced to tip for rude bad service. I normal always tip everyone and more than 20% but he made the whole night ruined. I never knew 5 was a big party that forced a tip. Maybe that is why he did not care if we had good service or not. I most likely will not be back to what was a favorite place."

B & B is the latest restaurant venture from Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich of Babbo, Otto, and Lupa fame. \n\nIf you've eaten at any other of Batali's restaurants you'll have high expections of top notch authentic and creative Italian food. Batali and co. have done Vegas right by creating a cool joint that is classy and does the near impossible by making you feel transported out of the the desert mayhem that is Las Vegas. The dark walnut walls, crisp white linens, and of course Batali rocks the Zeppelin. You gotta love someone who has the balls to match Zeppelin with fine dining and make it seem effortless and obvious. Of course we're gonna rock fine dining! \n\nFor the primo, I had the Baby Red Oak Leaf salad. I was actually expecting Mario to have concocted some crazy way to prepare oak leaves, thankfully it was a varietal of lettuce that was like no lettuce I ever tried, rich and flavorful. \n\nFor the secondi, I tried a few items starting with the Stinging Nettle papardelle with Wild Boar Ragu. This was spectacular, rich and well balanced, the nettle doesn't really impart much flavor, but is a nice counterpoint to the boar which provides most of the earthy flavor.  \nNext up the Beef Cheek Ravioli with Crushed Squab Liver and Black Truffles. Oh my God, yes this was a spiritual experience. * without any hyperbole, this was hands down the best pasta I've ever eaten, better than anything I tried in Tuscany *  And that's not the hangover talking. Two or three other well travelled guests agreed. I think it might have been the squab liver that put it over the top. \n\nFor the secondi, the Brasato al Barolo, essentially bone-off short ribs on polenta with fresh horseradish. As you can imagine, rich and decadent, melts away with every bite and the horseradish provided a nice sharp counterpoint to the richness. \nNext up the Fennel Dusted Sweetbreads which made me feel smarter immediately. At least smarter for trying them. Crisp on the outside, tender on the inside. Possibly Mario's tribute to the chicken nugget. Unbelievable, who knew brains could taste so damn good. \n\nFor dessert,  being in the desert, I felt like some thing rich but also refreshing, and the warm chocolate cake with mint gelato did not disappoint. I could have eaten twelve of these if given the opportunity. The housemade caramel gelato was also pure decadence.\n\nThe wine we had was \"house\" wine, and by that I mean Bastianch's Italian wine company and Mario's personal Italian label. Not a bad glass among the bunch. All exceptional.   \n\nStarting off with raspberry bellini's, the wine was paired by their som to match our choices for the 4 courses. Each wine was excellent. I thought for my shortribs, I could have used a slightly bigger wine with more acid to cut it, however the sangiovese blend was still excellent. \nWe went through probably 8 to 10  bottles of wine. From prosecco to Rose, to the final Moscato and inbetween, all matched up great with our food.  \n\nOverall, B&B is going into the Vegas rotation, fun, cool, classy, incredible Batali food, incredible wine and I don't need to fly to NY. \n\nNow I just need to send word that San Francisco needs Mario too."

Service was superb and speedy. \n\n- Complimentary Chickpea Bruschetta: Seasoned chickpeas topped on toast-- good but not as good as what we were about to feast on!\n\n- Minestrine di Torrellini: A nice start to the meal, super flavorful broth! (paired with a 2009 La Mozza)\n\n- Pizzoccheri with Roasted Pork Shank: Flat and wide squid ink pasta with a light sauce-- the pieces of pork shank were super tender and succulent. (Paired with a 2008 Sicilian wine - Etna Piosso)\n\n- Pork Raviollini with Roasted Flamme Tomato Passato: The tomato sauce was bursting with flavor! I could tell that the sauce was made with super ripe and fresh tomatoes and tasted great with the tender pork.  (Paired with a 2007 Monti Garbi)\n\n- Fettuccine with Norcinio Ragu Pork: A lighter, opaque sauce and fettuccine with pieces of the pork's kidney, liver, and heart. You really do get to taste various parts of the pig-- I couldn't tell what each piece was but they were all tasty. (Paired with a 2008 Rubbjano).\n\n** I was already pretty full and buzzed at this point, so don't let the small servings fool you! **\n\n- Black Spaghetti with 'Nduja and Sicilian Pesto: 'Nduja is a spicy, spreadable sausage that is made of different parts of the pig (shoulder, belly, jowl, tripe, spice mixture). The pasta was a little too spicy for me but still killed it (silician pesto contains red pepper). I love the texture of the squid ink pasta because it adds a different, more firm texture. (Paired with a 2007 Cannonau di Sardegna)\n\n- Pear Sorbetto: OMG the best pear sorbet I've ever had! My first bite tasted like I took a bite out of the sweetest, ripest, asian pear! Super light and refreshing, which was amazing after having the spicy spaghetti prior. (Paired with a 2010 Dindarello)\n\n- Chocolate Budino with Huckleberry Sauce: It kind of looks like a souffle but it's actually a creamy custard/pudding. Super moist, fluffy, and not too sweet! The huckleberry sauce tasted amazing with the dessert.  \n\n** Literally felt like I was going to explode at this point **\n\n- Then the server brings out a complimentary assortment of mini dessert cookies along with a shot of a super sweet dessert liquor. A bit too sweet for my liking, but we appreciated it! \n\nOverall, a wonderful dining experience with great service! I gotta come back here to try items on the regular menu."

Bad idea. Let me tell you... B&B isn't near to the same class as Osteria Mozza. \n\nThe ambiance was nice. Comfortable. Had a familiar feel.\n\nThe service was... Lacking. I guess the question should be, was there service? Minimal. \n\nHomemade Orecchiette with spicy lamb sausage and rapini was fair, not what I would have expected from a Batali and Bastianich restaurant.\nBone Marrow Ravioli with osso bucco ragu was a little better... But still nowhere near mind blowing.\nWhole Grilled Branzino with herb and fennel salad was HORRIBLE. The fish did not taste fresh and was a compete waste. Just plain bad.\nVeal Chop with pancetta, spinach, and torpedo onions was actually the best item I tried during this visit. It it was just okay. Actually it saved them from a one star rating.\n\nUsually, If I have a bad experience at a restaurant, I will give them a second chance. But this wasn't a minor issue, or one item that wasn't good. It was everything. From the moment I walked in the door. To leaving and heading back to Table 10 to eat a good meal.\nI tried it once, but don't think I will again."

However, we did not catch this mistake until we left since we were in such a rush to make it to the show. Tackiest move to say the least.\n\nI thought the whole experience was not worth a cent that we paid. It was infuriating.\n\nUPDATE:\nI also emailed the manager about the situation upon my return from vacation. His response was sent within 10 hours of my email. I was very impressed with his quick response and apologies for the experience. I have changed my star-rating to compensate for the professional way he handled the situation. He assured me that they train the staff to be mindful of guests' allergies or time schedules for shows and other events.\n5 stars to Matthew T. @ B&B"

I made our reservation two weeks in advance and we were so excited that we ended up getting there a half hour early. That wasn't an issue and they sat us right away.\n\nOur waiter was absolutely amazing (I can't quite remember his name, but I think it was Mark). We wanted to have the full experience and we had the time, so we did the tasting menu with the wine pairings. They are seven course meals and each dish was better than the last. The explanations of the dishes and their origins and the reason why each wine was paired with that dish was not only helpful, but enhanced our experience as well.\n\nMy favorite dish was the Squab \"al Mattone\" with Truffled Crema Fritta and Black Trumpet Ragu paired with Masi \"Costasera\" Amarone 2007. Any time you fry a sweetened cream infused with black truffle, you can't go wrong.\n\nMy husband's favorite was actually his dessert. It was Honey Budino with Honey-Orange Vanilla Syrup paired with Donnafugata, \"Ben Rye\" Passito di Pantelleria 2009. It was, as he put it, the nectar of the gods."

It was just the right amount of salty and lightly but complexly flavored.\n\n2) Goat cheese tortellini with fried orange and wild fennel pollen: OH MY GOODNESS. So savory. Exactly what it sounds like. Could have eaten a pound of this one.\n\n3) Tagliatelle with parsnips, guanciale and chili: This was ribbon pasta in a butter sauce with the stuff above. It was very good but of all the courses I might have skipped this one if I had to choose one to skip.\n\n4) Alberto's Pyramids: PHENOMENAL. \"This will ruin beef ravioli for you forever.\" That's what the waitress told us and she was right. Perfect pasta surrounding delicious braised beef in a tangy tomato based sauce. Also could've eaten a whole plate of these.\n\n5) Beef cheek ravioli with black truffles and crushed duck liver: RICH RICH RICH. This one was delicious but oh-so-rich to the point where I couldn't finish my little portion. \n\n6) Chocolate chip cannoli: Far from the usual over sweetened version of cannoli, B&B did it just right. It was lightly sweet but also had some nice bitter notes that went well with coffee.\n\nOverall, would come back to this restaurant in an instant, but not if I have somewhere to be within 3 hours."

Probably the best dish of the night. The octopus was tender.\n\nBeet salad: Also pretty good. Very colorful. \n\nLinguine with clams: disappointment! My noodles were not only undercooked, but dry. They said it's bc it's al dente. I like al dente, but this was beyond. Many of the noodles were stuck together and they were pretty hard. So I sent it back. They made a new dish for me. Noodles were perfect. However, it was so salty, I couldn't finish it. And I really tried, too. Salt lick. \n\nWe got a few other pasta dishes. My gf had to send hers back bc the noodles were also undercooked. My other gf 's pasta dish wasn't appetizing, so she didn't finish hers. Another gf of mine got the short ribs, and she enjoyed her dish. It tasted pretty good. Salty, though. \n\nIf you love salt, you'll love this place. :)"

Our server was pretty kick-ass looking too, with his ear plug and shaved head. You would've thought that he played in a rock band on the weekends or something similar. But anyways, they were extremely helpful in accommodating my vegetarian diet, giving me suggestions on what I could order on the menu and whatnot. \n\nSo I had some sort of mushroom dish (4 kinds of mushrooms?) and whoaaaaa I still salivate over the thought of those mushrooms today. Completely simple and in their natural flavor... the pasta was hand-made/hand-cranked also! Very delicious. My partner had some sort of penne dish I can't remember the vegetable but the penne was damn good. It was hand-rolled and paper thin.... I still salivate over that as well. \n\nI think the desserts were so-so, not very memorable; the presentation of all the food was beautiful (of course) and we had a delicious glass of Muscato accompanying our dessert. \n\nI would definitely go back if I were to stop in Vegas again .. and if I had money and they had vegan options, just because the service was so top-notch. What I mean is, the server (or any server) paid attention to you, but not in the annoying salesperson sort of way.\n\nHowever the location of this restaurant is a bit weird. It's located in a mall. So as nicely dressed up as you are, you.... look out and see a bunch of tourists... in their usual tourist garb."

The price point was fair, ambiance was casually elegant, and it's a Mario Batali establishment... so what could go wrong?\n\nWell problem was, we left still starving.  It was mainly my fault, I should have known better.  At a nice casino restaurant mid twenty's to thirty dollar dishes gets you nothing.  Pasta portion was small, and the protein in the dishes were meager.\n\nWe cut to the chase and ordered only entrees.  My Spaghettini came w/ chives, garlic and a One-Pound Lobster for $32.  Wow, what a deal right?  Imagine my surprise when I got a fistful of spaghetti and a few bites of tail and claw.  I swear, this does not look like it came from a one pound lobster.  I do have to admit it was titillating to the palette.  The pasta was cooked perfectly.  The spiciness of the chives, the sweetness of lobster and garlic, combined with the savoriness of the sauce was gratifying.  I wished I had more of it.\n\nMy brother's gnocchi w/ braised oxtail didn't give him the same response.  It was $25, seemed like there were more of the oxtail ragu than actual gnocchi.  He did state that they were soft like pillows.  Just the ragu was not to his liking.\n\nOh, we did get an Amuse Bouche: bruscetta w/ chickpeas & olives.  Which was good and finely salted.\n\nWe made it to our show, barely.  Didn't enjoy it much because I was hungry again 30 minutes into the show.

By no means am I saying it was unhealthy or a huge portion or anything, just didn't feel quite as healthy eating it by myself.\n\nFriend 1 got the black spaghetti (squid ink) which I thought was fantastic, but she said it was a little too spicy. When the server came over to ask how everything was and she said it was too spicy, you could tell he had this awkward mental turmoil in his head where he could have said what was appropriate for such a fancy establishment, something along the lines of: \"did you want me to get you something else?\" but he probably didn't want to so instead he said \"it's good for you!\" ................ .... .... ........ ........LOL. \n\nFriend 2 got the 2 minute spicy calamari which she liked a lot more. Unfort I'm allergic so I couldn't try haha. \n\nOther awkward thing was the bread guy gave us bread and no butter or olive oil or vinegar so we just sat there, starving from the show, trying to politely get somebody's attention for a good 10 minutes so we could eat the dryass bread lol. \n\nI get it, you know? All the people that work in Vegas are super jaded and always expect tips for everything. I'm sorry we're Asian girls watching our figures (we are eating at 10pm after all) and didn't order a primi and secondi each, subsequently lowering your tip, I'm sorry. \n\nThe tasting menu ($99) is probably the best deal out of everything on the menu and I would have tried that if it wasn't for the early flight the next day. I would have looked forward to trying that the next time I'm in town but thanks to the awkward reception from the staff I probably won't return.

The server and his staff were very knowledgable not only about the meals themselves but of some of the history of where the originated.\n\nFirst course was the tortellini minestrone.  It came in a small amount of broth.  Nothing too filling and tasted great.\n\nSecond course was tagliatelle, sweet corn and crispy pancetta.  Awesome, the flavors and texture really worked well together.\n\nThird was my wife's favorite, raviolini.  They are ravioli but quarter size and filled with a very tasty braised pork shoulder. This came with a small amount but very powerful heirloom tomato sauce.\n\nFourth was a ragu with a variety of stuff .... Pork, hearts, liver, etc...I am not normally a big fan of the hearts and livers but actually found this to be the most flavorful and tasty dish of them all.\n\nFifth and final of the main dishes was black (squid ink) spaghetti with a moderately spicy sausage which somehow reminded me of chorizo.  It was good as well but we are getting full.\n\nFinally, their were 2 deserts.  A strawberry sorbet and chocolate souffle.  Both were awesome.  The chocolate souffle was extremely fluffy.\n\nThe wine pairing was excellent and well chosen.  All red wines which we enjoy very much.\n\nOne final note, we have ventured here on a prior occasion where it was an extremely slow night (I cannot imagine they have to many).  We simply asked for the chef to prepare us something off the menu and were very satisfied.  This can make for a very enjoyable experience at any restaurant willing to make the effort to please, which they are."

YUM.  fine. done. what he failed to tell us and what we found when it was delivered that it was like about a 4-inch wide 1-foot log of heavy goodness.  thanks for the recommendation but he should have warned us two ladies that we probably couldn't eat it all or even half of it.  so i definitely recommend this if you're a party of 4, or a party of 2 with an appetite for a heavy, rich dessert!\n\noverall, i would never go back.  sounds like this place is a hit or miss, and a good restaurant is always a hit.  i posted pictures of all the dishes mentioned above for the curious!"

I had the bone marrow ravioli which the waiter recommended. It had a funny taste to it and I didn't like it. Maybe it's an acquired taste? Moved on to my pasta. I ordered the black pasta, since the waiter said it is the same thing as squid ink pasta. I've had the authentic thing in Venice, Italy and this was definitely not it! For one it tasted like regular pasta. The one in Venice had a slightly briny seafood taste to it which made it unique compared to regular pasta, and B&B's did not. Also, I couldn't believe how salty and spicy the pasta was. Is squid ink pasta supposed to leave a burning sensation in your mouth? I don't think I'll be coming back here."

            "review": "***Mario Batali's B&B Ristorante looks and feels like his restaurant Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles, but it is nowhere near as good as that restaurant***\n\nLas Vegas is filled with high-priced restaurants backed by celebrity chefs.  Unfortunately, most of them are very expensive and simply not that good.  They tend to feature menus that do not change that often and the food quality is just mediocre at best.  There are some exceptions.  MGM Grand's L'atelier de Joel Robuchon features exceptionally creative and modern French cuisine that embraces French flavors and techniques while losing the richness and heaviness to deliver more vibrant and lighter cuisine. And Mario Batali's Carnevino (in the Palazzo) serves very good and thick cuts of beef though the sides, (most of their) pastas and desserts underwhelm.\n\nBatali's other high-end Las Vegas restaurant (B&B Ristorante) is also located in The Palazzo / Venetian, but it focuses on Italian starters, pastas and entrees and not the steakhouse fare of Carnevino.  B&B Ristorante immediately reminds me of Batali's Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles.  The menus look the same (and some of the dishes even seem very similar).  A pasta tasting menu is offered at both spots.  And the decor at both places are similar--lots of dark wood (dark lighting too).\n\nThe food though is just not as good.  Starting with the amuse of crostini topped with garbanzo beans.  It was perfectly fine, but it lacked the punch of the similar amuse crostini at Osteria Mozza, which features creamy and freshly made ricotta as well as fragrant and fresh basil.\n\nB&B's burrata starter was a simple preparation with cracked pepper, olive oil and good and grilled bruschetta-like toasts.  The burrata starter was fine, but it was something I would expect to find at Batali's more casual and much less pricey Pizzeria Mozza than a supposedly high-end spot like B&B.  Osteria, on the other hand, showcases much more creative burrata dishes with great flavor combinations and ingredients.\n\nB&B's octopus was garnished with a mix of Italian white beans and a limoncello vinaigrette.  The octopus was big yet soft and the overall flavor was good though I think the octopus at Osteria Mozza is much more focused and thus more intense and distinct.\n\nThe beef cheek ravioli with black truffles and crushed duck liver is a popular pasta option here, but I found it very underwhelming.  While the flavor was fine, the truffle flavor was not there.  The pasta itself was okay, but the beef cheek filling was very puree like.  I would have preferred a more braised beef-like filling.\n\nThe crispy sweetbreads entree was served atop a butternut squash puree and with a side of frisee salad garnished with crisp apples.  The frisee salad was fine, but the sweetbreads had a very unattractive color.  They looked like karaage not fried at a high enough temperature.  There was not much crispiness on the exterior (not much flavor either).  The inside was okay (not too fatty), but it lacked the hot and juicy center of really nicely prepared sweetbreads.\n\nFor dessert, the warm chocolate torta was the all-too-common chocolate molten lava cake, but it was still satisfying with a good cake-like exterior and a rich and warm chocolate center (it came with olive oil gelato).  The tiramisu was kind of like a modern take on tiramisu with a cake topped with mascarpone cream and then garnished with a chocolate sauce and an espresso gelato.  It was an okay dessert, but it lacked the great strong flavor of tiramisu.\n\nThe apple crostata with vanilla bean gelato was not good.  The apples were not that caramelized and the pastry was a little greasy.  It was too soft--not crispy enough like a great crostata or puff pastry.\n\nService was okay--pleasant enough but ordering and getting the bill took too long.  Service was just not as attentive as it should have been.\n\nAs mentioned, B&B features a mostly dark interior so it does not have that memorable of a look.  The restaurant gets loud.\n\nPrices are very high, but that is to be expected given that the restaurant comes from Batali and it is in Vegas.  The pasta tasting menu seems like an okay value if all of the pasta courses are satisfying.\n\nB&B Ristorante is, unfortunately, a lot like many of the other upscale Las Vegas restaurants--it feels the part and comes from a big name, but the food is simply too expensive and nowhere near the same standard of similar restaurants in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York.\n\nThe Palazzo / Venetian, like all the other major hotels and casinos on The Strip, offers complimentary self and valet parking."

Thank goodness the portion was very small because more would have been an insult. The tablespoon of polenta under the meat was tasteless.\n\nThe octopus appetizer is equally bad. While the octopus was cooked correctly, the sauce was too strong. I'm not sure if it was too much balsamic or too much salt, but it was a disaster. \n\nI enjoyed the wine, and the coffee was outstanding. \n\nThe service is good, but they should offer more than one small piece of bread per person without having to ask for more.

            "review": "Such an inedible and expensive disappointment. My husband and I ordered one of each tasting menu to share - pasta and traditional. \n\nMy husband wanted wine with his dinner, but not the wine pairing, so the waitress sent over the sommelier. He asked what he could do to help us, then just stood there silently staring at us. After an awkward silence, my husband explained that he was having the tasting menu and wanted three glasses of wine total - one glass for every two dishes. The guy kind of shrugged his shoulders and asked what my husband likes, and answer which we both find infuriating. This went back and forth for awhile, getting nowhere, and finally we sent him away. My husband ended up asking the waitress to select wine for us, which she did, and did a good job.\n\nIn fact the service was pretty good other than the sommelier. Server was very nice, bussers were friendly, and they carefully asked us how everything was after each dish. However, they do this odd thing where they ostentatiously cover spills on your table with a napkin, accompanied by a lot of hand flourishes. This happened twice. It only draws attention to your table and I found it really unnecessary, but whatever. Otherwise good service.\n\nThe music, while good, is way too loud. We could not hear each other all night, and just ended up making gross-out faces at each other across the table, by which we communicated our disappointment in the meal.\n\nWe were served one piece of dry bread each with no dips or spreads or anything else at all to go with it.\n\nAs for the dinner:\n\nFirst course:\nPasta - Tagliatelle. Bland. It needed more spices and flavor, though the fresh herbs were nice. The mushrooms were really good. It was not great, but promising.\nTraditional - Veal. I liked this for the most part, though it was overly salted.\n\nSecond Course:\nPasta: Tortelloni. This was pretty good, though oddly sour overall with the goat cheese and citrus combo. At this point, I'm thinking this is not really that impressive, but maybe they are ramping up to hit us with the really good stuff.\nTraditional: Tortellini in Brodo. This was the worst dish of the night. I have never been served such weird, inedible pasta or such a sour, mushy sauce. It tasted like ground up canned artichokes. This was so bad and bizarre that I actually thought it must actually be amazing - like it was the most beloved dish on the planet to little Italian grandmothers in Piedmonte - and I was just too ignorant to understand it.\n\nThird Course:\nPasta Pyramids: The Tortellini aside, this is where things started going noticeably and undeniably downhill. The pasta was gummy, the beef cheek center was gritty and pasty, and the marinara sauce tasted just like Chef Boyardee. For some reason, I was still holding out hope. This is the famous Mario Batali, right?\n\nFourth Course:\nPasta: Beef Cheek Ravioli. Presented to me with the proud declaration that this is the dish that made Mario famous. I think, finally!, and dig in. Holy SALTY! I do not believe for one second that this dish made anyone famous, anywhere, ever. They are clearly butchering this man's food in the kitchen.\n\nFifth Course:\nPasta: Foie Gras Ravioli. I actually kind of liked the ravioli, but the balsamic sauce was overwhelming and ruined it.\nTraditional: The salt level of this dish made the beef cheek ravioli look like bland baby food in comparison. Utterly inedible, dry as a bone, and greasy. My husband said they are trying to salt cure their clients from the inside like salami.\n\nSixth Course:\nPasta: Sfoglia. The best thing we ate. Quite tasty.\nTraditional: Semifreddo. Boring. Odd texture.\n\nSeventh Course: \nPasta: Budino. Good, but let's be honest, its just your average lava cake.\nTraditional: Panetone. A dry piece of crumbly bread with honey on top. So bad that it almost turned the night around since at this point we just started laughing.\n\nI really do not understand the high ratings this place gets. The worst meal I've ever had in Vegas, and one of the most expensive. Like another reviewer said, I just can't even look at Mario Batali's face now without feeling bitter and disappointed."

Yet I found myself here on a regular night after an evening at The Smith Center. And you know what? Totally worth the splurge. \n\nB&B is the creation of chefs Mario Batalli and Joe Bastianich, which is irrelevant except that now when I watch Master Chef and Joe says something is worthy of his restaurant, I appreciate it more. Regardless of that, this place is awesome. \n\nThe atmosphere here is amazing. I mean, from the moment I approached this restaurant from the Palazzo side to the moment I was greeted by the lady at the front, it's a win. The hostess was great about looking up our reservation and getting is seated in no time. Walking into the place, you're greeted by an atmosphere that is modern Italian (does that make sense?). Our waiter approached us and told us a little bit about the restaurant and took our drink orders -- we each ordered an Italian beer ($14/beer, I believe) but I forget their names. Both beers were great, but not great enough I'd like another one for $14. We each ordered entrees (again, not remembering their names) and both were delicious and well worth their price tag. The food did not take too long to come out, which was great. We were finally treated to a cheesecake-type dessert with berries. It was pretty damn amazing. \n\nWe met one of the managers after dinner and told him how much we loved the place. He informed us of something we had taken note of: real Italian food in the eyes of the chef-owners should not be swimming in cheese and sauce like at some other Italian places. The food should be good, simple, and clean. That was certainly the case!\n\nAll in all, this place was awesome. I paid $160 total for our meal, including our tip. I'm generally opposed to any dinner for two that's more than $80, but this place was worth me spending a few extra dimes. \n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a really nice, elegant, and delicious Italian restaurant on the strip."

You know that story about the human body being incapable of drinking an entire gallon of whole milk in an hour?  I'm fairly certain that if you replace \"whole milk\" with \"pasta\" then this tasting menu falls a fraction of an inch below that quantity.\n\nI only remember a few dishes but they were all spectacular.  One had crispy turnips and fried guanciale.  One was beef cheek ravioli.  There was a goat cheese tortellini and there was something with duck liver and black truffle.  Oh the black truffle.  Even the pre-dessert was a pasta course.  Yes, you read that right; the dessert before the dessert.\n\nEverything was wonderful.  Some dishes were better than others but when each course features handmade pasta you can't really go wrong.  All in all it was a fantastic tasting menu that you should definitely try.\n\nAlso, the chocolate budino is a must have.  Seriously.  If you think of a rain cloud that is just about to burst and make that all made out of chocolate, that's the budino.  It's a fluffy creamy light chocolate flavor that is drenched with a dark chocolate ganache.  You wonder how you can possibly eat another bite when it's placed in front of you.  And then you wonder how you finished it all.\n\nOn top of the delightful food the service was impeccable.  Plates are set down and removed in unison.  Server was super friendly and knowledgeable.  Attentive, of course.  Just a really great dining experience overall.  Obviously the price point is high since it's a celebrity chef restaurant on the strip.  It's worth it though."

Expectations were high given the name behind this spot and the usually high standards of the Venetian. The Beet salad appetizer started great - simple, refreshing and excellent flavors. However main courses were mediocre at best. Sirloin steak was dry, came with Arugula and about as much balsamic as fits on the tip of your finger. Absolutely no taste to this dish. My friend's Quail was over cooked and overall plate was just poorly combined. Our other companions Linguine was deemed very good. The biscotti plate and Americano coffee were the best part of the meal.\n\nService was well below what we are used to from the Venetian businesses. Waiter was friendly enough but didn't hide the fact that he didn't give a shit about anything. Pinot Grigio was served after the appetizers arrived and his reaching over our plates to pick up a thing or two through out the meal made me want to slap his wrist.\n\nOverall I feel this place is poorly managed and overblown.

It was made perfectly and totally decadent and delicious.\n\nI ordered a side of roasted brussel sprouts with pancetta.

As mentioned before, the oatmeal cookie was as if it was made with salt and a whole lot of baking powder of some sort - it was definitely a mistake.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my main entree - the pasta - at this restaurant.

I started off with the warm goat tongue with truffle shavings and porcini mushrooms, which was superb. The tongue was very tender and the greens + mushrooms provided a nice contrast...add in a poached egg on top, which you are instructed to cut into and mix the yolk into the dish and I was in heaven. A rich, complex dish with flavors that piqued your imagination at every bite. The truffle shavings were quarter-sized and although maybe it could have been considered too much, I enjoyed every last bite of this dish.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the beef cheek ravioli, which was recommended by our server. Again, a truly wonderful dish, wich beautiful texture, and a rich sauce. The homemade ravioli was not over stuffed, and displayed a brillant balance. I also had the pleasure of tasting the pork chop, which was also phenomenal. I typically shy away from ordering pork chops because I find many restaurants, even higher end ones will frequently over cook pork chops, but B&B delivered an outstanding, perfectly cooked pork chop bursting with juices and flavor. I really don't think I've ever had a better pork chop!\n\nMy only complaint about B&B was the sommelier. I thought she was a bit pretentious and tried to steer us to more expensive bottles without asking questions to see what our budget was and what qualities we wanted in our wine. She didn't seem as knowledgeable as I would expect, and was not able to describe some of the wines in as much detail as I would have liked. I do understand that the wine list is huge and would be practically impossible to memorize every wine, but she seemed to be more interested in pushing the higher priced wine than finding the right wine for our budget.\n\nAll in all we had a fantastic dinner and I would almost certainly return. I just hope the goat tongue is still on the menu on my next visit!"

The star was the food with its simple ease that makes good cooking seem like no work at all.  The cured meats plate was delicious with a variety of different kinds of pork, each different but complimentary to the warm bread puffs. The hand made pasta was a little too rich and buttery but that may be what others would love about it.  The pork chop was perfectly juicy and cooked precisely as asked. Unlike other high end places in Vegas, it wasn't intimidating or discouraging.  (see my review for le cirque if curious.)  Would definitely go back next time in Vegas."

Went last night with a couple friends, we just wanted a quiet place for a drink. We are three well travelled people who were staying at Palazzo.... one would assume that we would be good customers.  Went in and ordered a bottle of wine for the three of us. When we asked for a piece of bread or something for the table was told that they had nothing for us, not even a bread stick due it being 11pm.  Then they started playing Van Halen music really loud. When we asked the waiter if he could turn it down or at least to something italian, he said look.... i have a lot to do here. Basically like we were bothering them. We asked when we came in if we had time to share a bottle of wine between three people and they said yes.  They took the order for the wine (which was not cheap mind you), then proceeded to treat us like they were doing us a favor.  What a  horrid place. I would never ever go back again and it puts a black mark on Mario Battali for me. I am an italian citizen and know good food and service. I always liked Battali for his honest approach. He needs to go in there and clean house of the horrid people who work there.  Beyond bad."

            "review": "Before checking this place out, I diligently did my research on yelp to see what people had to say about B&B. It really surprises me how on the mark the overall rating tends to reflect my general rating of the place. \n\nI was reluctant to come to B and B, because the reviews were hit or miss. Either someone had a great experience, or it was terrible. I didn't come in with high expectations, but I also did not come with low ones either...\n\nIn a nutshell, I was disappointed in the food. The service was very good, and the restaurant was nice and dark. My only qualm about the ambiance was that the background music was a bit loud and I'm pretty sure it was Nirvana playing in the background....It didn't really go with the dark setting and mahogany tables. Ok enough jibber jabber...onto the food.\n\nWe started with a pasta to start, and two pastas for the entree. \n\nSpaghettini with Spicy Budding Chives, Sweet Garlic and One-Pound Lobster $32\n\nThis was highly recommended by the server, and he also suggested that we started off with this dish since it was lighter than the other two pasta dishes we selected.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, but I couldnt help but wish that they had used fresh pasta. It would have completely elevated the dish, and the fresh pasta would have absorbed the sauce a lot better. The lobster was perfectly cooked, and the chives  added a bite and freshness to the dish. Sounds all good right? Almost.\n\nThe dish was extremely salty. I was a little disappointed since the saltiness took away from the sweetness of the lobster. I tried to ignore it, but it was enough to annoy me. It had the potential to be a really amazing dish. Just needed a few more notches...\n\nNext, our two entrees...\n\nBeef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver $26 \n\nI was really really excited about this dish. Beef cheek? GOOD. Truffles? GOOD. Duck liver...AMAZING.Right???? Wrong. This dish was a bit of a fail. The highlights of the dish were definitely the beef cheek ravioli. The pasta was fresh, and the filling was succulent and delicious. My complaint stems with the truffle and the crushed duck liver (the server called it foie gras...). . Although it was not foie, you think of a smooth and buttery fatness to liver. The duck liver was extremely gritty and had a very strong flavor that overpowered the delicateness of the pasta. Quite the opposite reaction I was expecting. The truffle flavor did not come through at all, and it seemed like sort of an afterthought. Also, there was two measly shavings of the truffle which appeared come out of a jar. I guess I was really excited for this dish, and when it did not deliver- it just killed it for me. I was pretty much over it after eating two raviolis. \n\nGnocchi with Braised Oxtail $27\n\nThe server told us that the gnocchi was house made. I pray that he was wrong because it resembled something similar to the Trader Joes version. I love gnocchi. When prepared right, those soft pillows of pasta can really create a euphoric experience. The gnocchi here were extremely dense, and did not at all seem homemade by any means. The dish's saving grace was the braised oxtail. There was a lot of beautifully braised meat, and the flavors were rich in flavor. If only they had served the braised oxtail with another pasta...I would have been much happier.\n\nOk...so you're probably saying...come on Michelle... give Batali a break. I say NO. Look, if you're gonna charge about $30/dish... and you're a highly rated chef... you should really be paying attention to detail. Make your own pastas, don't over-season a potentially amazing dish, and don't charge an arm and a leg for it. My other complaint was that the portions were rather small. I'm not a huge eater (although i love to eat), but the dishes were around 6 oz. of pasta for a person. \n\nWould I come here again? It would be hard to  justify it when there are so many other great places in Vegas. I would undoubtedly go back if someone picked up the tab though =)\n\n3 stars for the service, the ambiance, and the food."

My colleagues also enjoyed their meals which were: short ribs, fish and bolognese.  My caprese salad was amazing.  My bolognese was perfect - small portion, perfect sauce.  The wine sommelier was also helpful as we tried in vein to find a decent wine under $70.  We ended up ordering something in the $80+ range.  Our waiter was superb, friendly, knew the entire menu and later I found out is a veteran.  He was outstanding to our dining experience.  Thank you!\n\nSide note, I returned the next night, sat at the bar as my colleagues had returned home.  I arrived late, started talking with the bartender who was one of the best bar tenders I have met in a long time - showed me the difference in flavor between using citrus in a drink vs. slightly singeing citrus peel before you put it in a drink.  Very nice.  He talked about his upcoming tour to Italy that he had won from a bartending contest and was very excited to go.  I stayed after closing to chat further and met the Chef d'Cuisine who was a charming fellow foodie and whom further educated me on a few new flavors. Thank you so much - great experience.  I will be back on my next trip!"

For the primi, I ordered the bolognese which I thought was pretty good and my husband ordered the orechiette which was not that great.

That said, I'd rather eat it in Tuscany than in Las Vegas because the portions here are small and unsatisfying and more expensive -we paid $35 for each pasta dish and granted one was the one with 1 lb. of lobster, the other (which just had chanterelles and charred corn) did not have any expensive ingredient and was even smaller than mine. Portion size aside,  the flavors were just not that inventive or perfected, as you would expect from Batali. The \"Paglia e Fieno\" was really salty (the main flavor) and my spaghettini was rather bland. The calamari appetizer was delicious and leads me to believe there are other star dishes on the menu but when I go to a restaurant like B&B I don't want to have to hunt for what's good - it should all be impressive. Maybe asking too much, but who else to ask that from but Batali & Bastianich? I think I paid more for their names than their actual influence on the restaurant."

So, I called the hostess and requested a table for 7 people at 9pm on Sat.  When we arrived, we were escorted into a private back room (where they store the wine).  The ambiance of the room was fantastic!\n\nAt the table, we had the following dishes that I found particularly memorable and delicious:\nGilled Octopus - Best octopus I've ever had\nBucatini 'all'Amatriciana' - This was so good that I got it again at Enoteca San Marco (Batali's other restaurant in the Venetian) 2 days later.  The pasta noodles are nicely al dente.\nJose's Pyramids - We got this as an appetizer.  Delicious!\nSteak \"Tagliata\" - The gem butter lettuce accompaniment was really good.  The steak comes sliced (so it's best to order it a bit rarer than you normally would) and is encrusted with delicious peppery-salty goodness.\nHarry's Berries Strawberries\n\nMy friends also enjoyed:\nWarm Lamb's Tongue\nGoat Cheese Tortelloni\nWarm Peach Crostata\n\nFor wine, we had some of the ones from the Batali/Bastianich winery: a bottle of the \"Aragone\" La Mozza 2006 and I had an additional glass of the Morellino di Scansano.  Both were excellent.\n\nWhen I was here in January, they had a great \"mint love letters\" dish (pesto-stuffed envelope pasta in lamb sauce) that unfortunately wasn't on the menu any more."

Clearly influenced by his famous space on Waverly Place, both in design and in offerings, but differing slightly in vibe as a dimly lit room with R.E.M. playing gently overhead was complimented by lovely service from a young woman named Kelly our meal began with the staple-amuse of tender, spiced chickpeas on crisp bread and with proper bread service replenished frequently thereafter not a single bite of the food that followed would prove short of exemplary.  Eschewing lighter 'spring' flavors in favor of signatures until later in the meal our first course arrived with creamy pate of pork delivering plenty of spice and sapor while tender tripe compensated for its small portion with textbook texture and complex aromatics - a trend carried over to each $26 plate of pasta; the raviolis averaging approximately $4 each but so delicate, stuffed, and well sauced that it hardly seemed to matter until the plate was wiped spotless with plans to return for the pasta tasting menu swirling my mind.  Transitioning smoothly to things more substantial it would be an exercise in futility to determine whether the rich, caramelized-yet-rare spring lamb over smoky artichoke puree or the nutty roulade of rabbit with flan of carrots was a superior secondi and finishing with dessert both the simple peach presentation and an atypical souffl\u00e9-style budino showed the pastry kitchen's prowess - a Babboesque box of petit fours and a double espresso sending us to theater with full bellies and broad smiles.\n\nObviously prone to complaints of discrepancy in price-to-portion ratio for \"Italian food\" that many claim to be offered at a better value from their local mom n' pop joint a meal at B&B Ristorante is better taken as a \"Fine dining\" event rather than any regional cuisine - not only does the sourcing, preparation, and presentation deserve it but so does the service.  Certainly not a cheap meal as the average diner is unlikely to exit for less than a Benjamin suffice it to say that for a 'celebrity chef' meal on The Strip B&B delivers where many mail it in, a similar sentiment applicable to Palazzo's Carnevino, though the latter is ever so slightly a better 'experience.'"

Started with drinks at V Bar (happy hour until 7 - well drinks $6) almost next door to B&B and I was glad I did because reviewing the mark up of approximately 300% of wine at B&B I decided against wine with dinner. This was by no means an easy decision as Italian food begs for wine to accompany it but nonetheless I just didn't want to pay $20 a glass. Although had I been in a different mood I probably would have.  \n\nAs to the ambiance - it was more casual than other Batali restaurants I have been to. We were sat next to an open window overlooking the thoroughfare outside the restaurants where tourists walked to and fro. I would have preferred something a little more intimate and well in my experience these type of spots out in the open are generally reserved for people without reservations.  The restaurant was about 1/3-1/2 full. The acoustics made it so it was louder than I would have liked. They were playing AC/DC while we ate. While I appreciate rock music I would have preferred a more Sinatra experience. We were dressed up however there were a number of people wearing jeans. \n\nWe ordered two appetizers - the straciatella, which I always adore. I was recently told by Due Forni that they were the only place in town that imported and served this but maybe they meant the only non-strip restaurant? Either way the straciatella was $16 and came with two pieces of bread, we asked for more. The cheese is creamy and has a mild almost nutty flavor to me. We also ordered the calamari, it was grilled and was delicious although it was approx. $20 and only had three larger tentacle pieces.  We then ordered the bone marrow ravioli, they brought it out on two plates for sharing. While it was good, I don't think I would order it again - the bone marrow must have melted upon cooking it because there really wasn't any within the raviolis although there was a taste of bone marrow. Again around the $20 range. For the secondi I ordered the veal saltimbocca with arugula salad.  The arugula had a light vinaigrette on it and as plentiful and the veal also came with two larger pieces, although the veal was a little tough. We think it would have been better if we just ordered a few appetizers to share. \n\nThe service was not impeccable. We were sat at a two top. They let the menus and wine list pile up and brought out plates before they took the order and brought out the amuse bouche of bruschetta (which was two small toasts with a chickpea compote on top). Instead of taking our orders and taking the menus they sat the menus next to me on the booth side of the table. Also, we had to ask for drink refills.  They didn't place the napkin on my lap (yes I realize that is knit picky but that is what reviews are for right). I also overhead the waitress, our waitress, tell another table that a slow roasted meat was tougher because it was cooked longer - really?! Obviously untrue and I couldn't believe she said that and that they patrons believed it but I restrained myself and didn't interject. I asked for bread with olive oil/vinegar - the waiter forgot the olive oil and I had to ask a second time.  Also, waited forever to bring the check and then forever once we gave her money for the change. I watched the waitress walk around the restaurant and take two more table's orders prior to retrieving our change.  We were even more ancy as service was slow and the chairs were not the most comfortable and we were anxious to leave. \n\nAlso, I found the Mario Batali cookbooks lining the bar area to be obnoxious - like a cheap advertising ploy. So I think next time I will pick another Batali venue. We still love Carnavino and I would go back there over B&B."

My husband and I went with Mario's Classic Pasta tasting menu.  It was a 7 course tasting menu, 5 courses of pasta and 2 courses of dessert.  Our service was impeccable!  Our waiter was knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, informative, and funny.  The assistant waiter was awesome.  He was in charge of making sure our water was full, we always had bread, we always had new silverware for each course, general chit chat and just to make sure we were completely taken care of.  They made you feel \"important\" and very well taken care of. \n\nAs we were presented every course we were given a detailed explanation of what we were about to eat.  Additionally, if we had questions about the course they were happy to discuss more details with us.  The staff was extremely knowledgeable about each and every dish and were extremely friendly.  I can honestly say that each and every course we were served was unique and delicious.  The dishes were served from a lighter sauce to a heavier sauce which I thought was a great service method.  \n\nMy favorite pasta course was the Goat Cheese Tortelloni with Dried Orange and Wild Fennel Pollen.  It is truly hard to explain just how incredible this dish was.  The pasta was so tender, the goat cheese filling was light yet extremely flavorful.  However, it was the orange that made this dish.  The hint of orange paired so beautifully with the goat cheese.  It was truly special.  \n\nMy second favorite course was the Handrolled Pasta Sfoglia with Sage Pastry Cream.  When I saw this on the menu I wasn't quite sure about the Sage Pastry Cream.  WOW!!  It was spectacular.  I have never enjoyed a cream more.  Our waiter called it a pre-dessert as it starts getting your palate ready for a sweat dessert.  It was perfect.  \n\nThe dessert was a chocolate budino that was absolutely heavenly.  It was light, airy and oh so chocolately.  But, I have to say what I thought was really nice was the post-dessert box of mini goodies that we were presented with.  It was a pleasant surprise.  A box filled with tiny bites of goodness.  Treats such as a flourless cake, an oatmeal cookie, a peanut butter cookie and 4 other mini-yummy bites.  \n\nWas this evening expensive - yes.  Did I feel like it was worth the cost - YES, it was worth every single penny.  The combination of fantastic service and spectacular food made for an extremely memorable and enjoyable evening."

FAIL. \nMy dad got the beef cheek ravioli which was actually delicious. Too bad it wasn't MY order.\nMy sister got orchiette with sausage and brocollini (can't remember the real name, this was all translated from the fancy italian they actually use on the menu) which was decent I suppose... for $29 bucks...\n\nOur waiter was meh, he was pushy and forgot my dad's side order of potatoes. Didn't really even apologize. It's okay, we didn't want $10 potatoes that were prob just plain potatoes in olive oil and rosemary. Minus a star.The bus boys were prompt and funny though. Maybe they should trade places with our waiter... \n\nBasically everything is above $25 and for small portions. Our waiter said \"typically\" a person orders an appetizer, first course (pasta), second course and then dessert. But total that would be over $100 a person guarantee and we weren't feeling it. \n\nOVERALL: not worth it. Splurge at a different place. Sorry, Mario. Maybe you and your crocs should roll up to this restaurant to change it up.\n\nI will say that their Bellini (peach puree + prosecco) was yummy and maybe the best thing I had at dinner. But that was a $12 cocktail. SAD."

The waitstaff was professional, helpful and efficient.  The meal was impeccable.  The Ribeye for two was unreal.  The lamb was amazing, avoiding any game-iness.  B&B really is the best that the franchising of celebrity chefs has to offer.  \n\nAs an added bonus, there was an issue with the check and the manager was remarkably helpful; she remedied the problem in record time."

I wanted to start off w/a glass of their house merlot but was informed that they did not serve merlot by the glass...wha? The waiter, Kevin suggested an alternative but casually mentioned that it was the cheapest red house wine that they served by the glass. I wonder why he did that? Started w/Calamari and finished w/Veal Chops and broccoli. The meal was very good along w/the service that was Kevin and his group.

When we arrived at B&B last week, Ian made us the most fabulous drinks ever - blood orange cosmo for me and old fashioned for my husband.  If only Ian could have been our server, the experience would have been so much better.  Ian told us about B&B whole animal program and a fabulous angus beef special.\n\nWhen we were seated, our server David didn't tell us about the angus beef special that Ian had.  We asked about it, and David said since he was new, he just didn't know about it.  I'm glad Ian mentioned it because it was the best part of the dinner.  We also ordered the mozzarella and ramp appetizer, which was good but not great.  The ramps were super chewey and difficult to eat.  \n\nFor the pasta course, I ordered the mint love letters, and my husband ordered the bone marrow ravioli.  Both were really good, although I liked his a little better than mine.  For our entrees, my husband ordered lamb, and I ordered 2 minute spicey calamari.  I didn't want anything heavy, so David suggested the calamari and told me that it wasn't spicey really.  WRONG - it was very spicey and chewy.  So disappointing.  I would have mentioned this to David had he ever showed up again after we got our dinner.\n\nHe mentioned that Shania Twain was eating there somewhere, so maybe he was waiting on her too.  All I know is that we told David we had a show to go see 2 1/2 hours after our reservation, and he was not very attentive.  My husband's lamb was good, but the calamari was not very good.  We would have liked to order dessert, but we ended up having another waiter go to find David becuase we had to pay to leave, and unfortunately nobody came to the table for a long time.  \n\nI will probably get the pasta tasting next time I go back, but I certainly hope the last service isn't indicative of what I can expect in the future."

Our server was also very nice, knowledgeable, and attentive.  \n\nWe started our meal with the cured meat plate and the fresh, homemade mozzarella appetizer served with toasted baguette slices and ramps.  That fresh mozzarella appetizer was absolutely amazing!!! We then moved on to our pasta courses, where we shared both the Spaghettini with Spicy Budding Chives, Sweet Garlic and One-Pound Lobster and the Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver.  The Spaghettini was cooked perfectly al-dente.  The lobster was also tender and the flavors of the tomatoes and herbs in the pasta were so fresh and tasty!  My boyfriend was a huge fan of the Beef Cheek Raviolis.  For our main course, we shared the Duck with Grilled Plums and Bitter Almond- Yummy! The duck was tender with a nice, crispy skin and the crispy confit leg was perfect! For dessert we had the lemon and marscapone pudding with a thin layer of cake on the bottom and topped with a crunchy pine nut brittle.  The pudding was so creamy, and the perfect balance of sweet and tart.  \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this place and even though there are tons of restaurants I would love to try in Vegas, I will definitely  be coming back here when I return."

For $24 heirloom tomatoes salad, $21 a plate for buffalo mozzarela and $14 a plate for beet salad,  I would expect all these dishes to be amazing, but in the end, they were just dressed up salads.    \n\nPasta Course: We order six diff pastas to share.  We had to have \"refills\" on two of them  because it was THAT GOOD - 1) beef cheek ravioli with black truffles and crushed duck liver and 2) Bolognese pappardelle.  I LOVE pasta and I am extremely picky when it comes to pasta (maybe it's the Asian in me...from the school of Marco Polo brought pasta back to western world from China...LOL)  I must say, these two dishes were flavorful, unique and what a delight to taste something like the bolognese kicked up 100 notches at B&B.  The wild boar ragu was alright, did not \"wow\" me.  The clam linguine was poor at best - TOO spicy, nothing special, and not flavorful aside from the dramatic heat - it was disappointing. \n\nEntrees: We each ordered an entree and pretty much everyone ordered something different.  I was honored to eat off of everyone's plate.  \n\nI ordered the rabbit.  The Rabbit was AMAZING.  It was done a few different ways - braised, confit, deep fried leg, and pan seared.  It was flavorful, tender, juicy, and well seasoned.  It had a wonderful balance of flavors - gentle but with a punch.  (my second choice for entree would have been the sweetbreads)\n\nBBQ skirt steak - it was just ok.  It wasn't excellent, it wasn't bad, it was just middle of the road.  Not my favorite cut to begin with, but most of all, it seemed to have been marinated with a lot of salt...too salty for me.\n\nWhole grilled Branzino was quite good.  The fish is very mild and the dish was well seasoned overall.  I love whole fish (once again the Asian in me) - makes the meat so much more juicy.  \n\nGrilled rib eye was shared between two sisters.  I liked the rib eye a lot albeit I only had two little bites.  I mean, it's hard to go wrong with a rib eye, but hey, you'd be surprised...\n\nDessert: ordered several to share with everyone at the table.  Nothing totally memorable.  The small bites biscuit/cookies they brought out with our coffee were even better than the desserts we ordered (very similar experience at Del Posto...)\n\nI love Mr. Batali and have so much respect for him.  I love the two pasta dishes mentioned above and the rabbit and branzino were truly delightful.  I will definitely come back, throw money at this place and try the tasting menu next time I am in town..."

That was very nice.\nWe got our bill and yes, it is expensive ($120 for the ribeye only) but if you are looking to get a great meal, it is definitely worth it.\nPortions are small so don't go there if you are starving.\nI would definitely go back to B&B.\nWhy not 5 stars? Because the service was not consistant. Kevin was great but I felt the rest of the staff did not deliver the same service."

We actually arrived closer to 25 minutes late but the hostess was very gracious and told us that it was not a problem. We were seated immediately and our waitress was right over to take our drink orders. Before perusing the menu, our waitress let us know that we could ask her any questions we had about any of the plates as their menu is not very descriptive. We ordered two appetizers, Burrata (and I can't remember the other one), the Burrata was outstanding! \n\nAfter that we chose our pasta dishes, I had the Gnocchi with lamb ragu.

But this room has only 3 tables, surrounded by wine racks (fells like dining inside the safe at Fort Knox, surrounded by treasure). It's absolutely great. You feel like you are in a private enclave, away from the crowds. Loved the place! Found a great wine under $50 (not easy).\nService was good, knowledgeable and straight, no frills, no BS.  \nFood, bread was good, but would have been better if accompanied by something (olive oil, tepenade...something). The must commented upon Beef Cheek Ravioli is good (in my estimation, though my wife hated it), but it should be a little more clearly described as a liver sauce, liver tasting dish. The liver is overpowering and it's all you taste. Good, if liver is what you like and want, but disappointing if beef cheeks is what you are going for. My advise is to ask plenty of questions so you know what you get.\nThe prices are, as you would expect, close to the value of the food weight in silver, and the portions are small. I had sweetbreads. If you like that stuff, you are going to like the dish.\nI find $120 for pasta tasting to be a bit much, and I guess if you don't spring for two dishes you are likely to leave hungry.\nAll and all, it is Mario, and there are a few other items on the menu that sound good.

            "review": "Named after owner and chef Mario Batali, and co-owner and winemaker Joseph Bastianich, B&B Ristorante is a fairly new restaurant in The Venetian Hotel. Part of Batali's New York based empire,  B&B is the more formal of his two Las Vegas restaurants (Enoteca San Marco is the other).\n\n\n**The Menu\nAnyone who has eaten at Babbo in New York will recognize most of the entries on the menu. In addition to more usual meats and seafood, there are a number of dishes featuring offal or less usual meats. Pasta is of course featured as well.\n\nThe meal is organized in the traditional Italian manner. The meal starts with an appetizer (antipasto), followed by a primo (which is often, but not necessarily, a pasta), then a secondo, along with side dishes (contorni). Of course, let us not forget dessert. I thought the servings were generous but not huge. However, if you're a modest eater, you may wish to order either a primo or secondo, but not both. \n\n\n**The Atmosphere\nThere is a lot of wood, both light and dark. Lighting is low.Tables are simply adorned, including a plain white table cloth. With so many hard surfaces, the room is noisy when full. However, I didn't find the music nearly as loud as I had expected, given the number of reviews emphasizing this.\n\nService started out a little slow. The server delivered a menu, explained it, then disappeared for an overly long time. However, he was very pleasant, and the meal itself was timed well. Overall, good service.\n\n\n**The Meal\nThe meal started with an amuse bouche of chickpeas and olive oil on crisp rounds of bread. Maybe I was hungry, but I thought it had very good flavor. The chickpeas were soft but not mushy, and the bread's crunchiness was a pleasing contrast.\n\nMy first course was warm lamb's tongue with chanterelle mushrooms and a poached egg. I was a little hesitant to order this, as my only exposure to tongue has been delicatessen style cow's tongue, of which I'm not too fond. However, this dish was excellent. The lamb's tongue was fine grained, with a very rich meaty flavor. A marinade added just the right amount of sourness. Sweet tomato and wonderful chanterelles added to the dish, and the three minute egg added rich liquid to the dish. I used the crusty, slightly charred bread to sop it up.\n\nFor my primo, the server recommend orecchiette with sweet sausage and rapini. Good recommendation. Orecchiette translates to something like \"little ear\", and is a lot like what U.S. supermarkets sell as macaroni shells. The pasta was cooked perfectly - very firm but still cooked through - and the flavors went well together. This dish wasn't quite as good as the lamb's tongue, but it was still very good indeed.\n\nMy secondo was fennel dusted sweetbreads. If you've never tried sweetbreads, or have tried them but aren't sure you like them, this is the place to order them. Served with sweet and sour onions and duck bacon, the very crispy outside contrasted with the smooth but firm insides. Some sort of mushroom juice was poured into the bottom of the bowl. Its moisture and its flavor were just right. Another very good dish, perhaps just a hair behind the lamb's tongue.\n\nAt this point, it's worth commenting on a point I've heard made by some other reviewers - that Batali has too heavy a hand on the salt shaker.  At home I tend to use little salt, yet I didn't find Batali's use of salt objectionable - more than I'd use, but not objectionable. However, I did end up drinking a lot of water throughout the meal, especially during the pasta course, so your mileage may vary.\n\nFinally, dessert: warm chocolate budino with peppermint gelato. It was, fortunately, a very small portion: rich chocolate cake with dense chocolate ganache, served warm. The gelato was wonderful! Make sure to order gelato in some form or other. If you can't arrange a visit here, go to the more casual Enoteca San Marco, where you can sit at the bar and just order gelato; it seems to be the same as at B&B.\n\n\n**Summary\nI've read a number of very complimentary reviews - and some not so complimentary reviews. Based on one meal, I side with the very complimentary camp. However, my choices were on the more unusual side, so it's hard to say what this means with respect to more normal dishes. Nonetheless, this restaurant is definitely on my repeat list.\n\n\n**The Bill\nThe meal was $80, plus drinks, tax and tip."

I didn't expect THINLY shaved Porcini mushrooms and arugula salad with THINLY shaved parmesan tossed in EVOO and aged balsamic vinegar.  Such a plain jane appetizer, it's really not worth the $17 price tag for salad.\n\nHowever, the grilled octopus with borlotti marinati in a spicy limoncello vinaigrette was too good to be true!  Especially after the disappointing salad starter, it was great to have this dish to savor over. \n\nThe pasta dishes were good, although not quite solid.  My beef cheek ravioli with black truffles and crushed duck liver was exactly what the doctor ordered! (not THAT doctor, I'm talking about the doctor for the soul! ha!)  I love foie and I love black truffles so it wasn't a surprise that I was going to LOVE this dish. The bf's pacherri with clams, mussels and shrimp cooked in a tangy tomato sauce was great, although the pasta wasn't cooked through. I like al dente but some pieces were still raw. \n\nService definitely needs improvement, while our busser kept up with the refilling of water, delivering dishes, etc.  I would like to see our actual server pass by more than one time and a \"is everything perfect?\"  question tossed our way.\n\nWhile the grilled octopus appetizer is a must try here, there are other Italian restos at the Venetian that are more worth your money."

I could tell from this it was going to be a good night.\n\n    Main Course - We ordered the seven course pasta meal.  For me, my two favorite dishes were the first two courses.

I could of ate this dish all night. \n\n    Dessert - Our seven course meal was nine when all said and done.

I was so stuffed at this point I could not even finish mine.  Wait there was more dessert, compliments of the pastry chef, several little samples.  Oh my I need a wheel barrel.\n\nService - Truly this what you come here for.  Okay the chef's amazing cooking.  So both chefs and servers work hand and hand.  After getting our drinks our waiter wanted to understand our time constraints which I thought was great.  We had none as this was our focus tonight.  We had two plus hours of fabulous service.  My wife pointed out; watch them bring the food to the large group.  Every plate went down at the same in unison.\n\nFuture - Well this was a very special treat.  Love to go back but this not a daily meal or experience for me."

My wife and I were invited to a friend's event in Las Vegas and we had considerable time to explore different restaurants. This place was one of our favorite stops for dinner. The service was excellent but the food was exceptional. \n\nWe started with the Roasted Kabocha Squash and Grilled Octopus. I can see why some may not be blown away by the squash dish - it's flavors are more delicate and I would describe it as an elegant dish. If you've grown accustomed to overly spiced or salted foods, this may not wow you, but I really enjoyed this app. The Grilled Octopus, however, was hands-down the best I've ever had. It had the most tender consistency, almost like swordfish and rather unlike the rubbery fare I sometimes encounter, even at highly regarded places. \n\nThe Pork Trotter Ravioli was very good and my wife only let me steal a little, but I was happy to get what she shared. \n\nMy dinner included an order of the Orecchiette and the Short Rib \"al Barolo\". Our server assured me the short rib would be so tender it could be cut with a spoon. He was not exaggerating. It was every bit as good as my mother's, which I have never been able to duplicate in the kitchen myself. \n\nOur dessert included an order of Spiced Bruciato and Limone di Torte, which was a fabulous end to a fabulous dinner. Worth. Every. Penny."

I was on a date and we wanted to eat light so we did not order as he suggested and from that point, had very little attention.

            "review": "As with other Mario Batali restaurants in Las Vegas no expense was spared to make B&B look like an elegant fine dining establishment. There is plenty of dark wood, dim lighting, and wine racks full of some of the finest wine on the strip. Unfortunately, being located in a high-traffic area of the Venetian, near the connector to the Palazzo, means they get a lot of walk-ins. Those walk-ins usually mean drunk, yard-glass consuming tourists in shorts and t-shirts, not the typical clientele of fine-dining restaurants seen in other cities.\n\nDuring my visit to B&B I got to experience first-hand some of the random drunks that stumble into this restaurant. Two guys were seated next to us who were slurring in broken English, but were able to articulate the occasional \"Fuck you, you son of a bitch!\" into their conversation. These fine gents sent back a bottle of wine for no reason, complained about everything from the second they sat down, and when they wanted to ask their server something one of the guys got up and chased him down from across the room while shouting, \"Excuse me, waiter!\" repeatedly at the top of his lungs. Half way through our meal we had to ask to be seated elsewhere because their antics turned from slightly amusing to obnoxious.\n\nLuckily, the food at B&B made up for the ambiance, or lack thereof. Both pasta dishes we ordered were excellent. The beef cheek ravioli was pure buttery, savory, saltiness goodness. The tagliatelle with charred sweet corn and truffles was some of the finest hand-made pasta we've had in town.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the duck and brasato al barolo. The duck is prepared two ways and served with cherry agrodolce and bitter greens. Both preparations of the duck were excellent, especially the duck confit which was so rich and tender. The brasato al barolo is a beef short rib that was fork-tender and very flavorful.\n\nFor dessert we got the dark chocolate torta -- a delicious bitter/sweet offering served with mixed berries. We also tried the house-made mint chocolate chip gelato -- smooth, rich and creamy and a perfect way to end the meal. The manager brought over two glasses of a dessert wine that they said would pair perfectly with the dark chocolate torta. They did not disappoint.\n\nTheir beer list is limited, but the Sella del Diavolo brown ale that I tried was excellent. Their wines by the glass are reasonably priced, for Vegas standards, and the one red we tried (Maculan) was very good. A single glass of wine is a generous pour, served in a decanter then poured in a glass.\n\nPrices are fairly steep but they do offer locals 20% off. Portions aren't large, but that's mainly because your supposed to order 3-4 courses as your dinner. The pace is slow, but our waiter was kind enough to let us know right after being seated and asked us if we had any time constraints. The service was good but not as finely-tuned as other \"fancy\" restaurants. Although our server seemed to have a lot of tables which would explain why he didn't stop by too frequently.\n\nSo, despite the obnoxious drunks (who happened to walk out without paying half way through their meal) it was a very good experience. Their menus are large and I'd love to go back to try several other dishes."

It was not. Had dinner with the wife and another married couple. We like most people on here had tickets to a 7pm show, so we were kind of on a time constraint. \n\nThe decor was elegant and had nice dark wood throughout. The menu to me read as this \"foo foo poo poo w/ a side of fennel something or other\". It was kind of tough to figure out what most of the stuff was on the menu. This is not their fault. It is mine for not speaking Italian. One could translate on their smart-phone if need be. I, instead was sketchy and chose something that might taste good. When the food arrived, it was great.\n\nThe waitress was knowledgeable about the wines and made us feel at ease for not knowing what a lot of the items were. She answered our questions without the attitude of \"omg, how do these ruffians not know what these dishes are?!\" That was a great feeling. \n\nI would come back to this restaurant again. I only took one star off for the amount of money we had to spend for food. Wife and I shared a meal, one salad, two cups of coffee, and one small dessert and it costs us just under $100 with tip."

We started with the grilled octopus which was OK, well cooked but on the salty side and otherwise devoid of flavor complexity. The most successful dish of the night was a goat cheese tortellini which had very fresh hand made pasta, subtle delicious flavors and rich soft goat cheese inside.  My main entree was the branzino which was well cooked but lacked in presentation and flavor profile. My company had the short rib which was extremely salty and could not be eaten. Overall if you are in Vegas and craving Italian you can pretty much skip this restaurant."

Service was fine (if a little too chummy/chatty for my personal taste). The amuse bouche of chickpea bruschetta was well seasoned and tasty enough. And our appetizer of grilled octopus really was delicious -- best thing we ate here by far.\n\nThen it all went downhill with the entrees. When we were ordering, we were warned by our server that the black spaghetti was very salty and to reconsider ordering it if we weren't into that. When we asked if it was possible to make it less salty, he said no. That's fine, I can understand chefs not wanting to change their dishes and cater to their diners' whims. So we ordered other things, figuring better safe than sorry...\n\nHoly salt lick, Batman! Every single one of our 5 entrees (spaghetti with garlic and lobster, orecchiette, bucatini all'Amatriciana, bone marrow ravioli, and lamb chops) was oversalted, ranging from that's-pretty-salty to almost inedible. So I can't even begin to imagine how salty the black spaghetti would've been...\n\nLiving in NYC, we get to eat a lot of amazing Italian, from homey and rustic to modern and upscale. So we had prepared ourselves to eat mediocre yet pricey Italian in Vegas, but this failed to meet even our very low expectations. Don't know how there can be so many good reviews of this place -- maybe they're more attentive with the tasting menus (which they did try hard to sell us on, but we just weren't that hungry). But after this experience, we def won't be back, and I doubt we'll be checking out one of their other joints any time soon."

Garlic tempered with dulcet tones of basil and fresh bean. \n\nThe antipasti dish is served by the person and varies depending on the night. They have a big storage area for cured meats. Four of us tipped in and we got six types of salami. Simple food but extraordinary tastes. The prosciutto was buttery, soppressata brought the heat, the sage spices dominated and then we discovered the chewy bologna. But best of all? It comes with a bag of steaming savory sopapillas. Tiny little pillows of heaven. \n\nI got the octopus appetizer, which was thick as a good steak but tender, no chew at all. They served it with a pungent pepper chutney and some thinly sliced radish. Tasted very spanish, paired with some house cured olives and peppers. \n\nAnything with fresh produce or herbs was a hit. They've got an exclusive herb grower, Paula Pudwell, who provides them with all the main herbs as well as some lesser known types, like mint lovage. Apparently they grow well in the arid Vegas soil. We had no complaints, especially when the mint straciatelli gelato hit the table. They've also got an exclusive forager, Kerry Clasby, who travels throughout California to track down their produce. They say that its driven out each night to arrive fresh each morning. Quick tangent. Apparently they've organized a local farmers market on wednesdays for these products. It used to just draw cooks but now it draws the larger community or so they say. \n\nMy two minute sicilian lifeguard squid was tasty but next time I'd go for a chop entree or the pasta bolognese. Perhaps more boring but so comforting. I did enjoy the beef cheek ravioli with duck liver. \n\nMy highlight was the yogurt semifreddo. House made yogurt served semi-frozen with an almond dough base topped with candied dates and honey. I was stuffed but then they brought out tiny desserts, a triangle of apple gelee and a petite orange cornmeal biscotti."

A little large for an amuse bouche requiring three bites and follow up by fork for beans that ran astray.  It was functional but not particularly creative.\n\nAppetizer:  I opted for the plate of salumi which included mortadella, lonza (stagionata), salami, pickled ramps, and olives.  The ramps were really delicious, and the olives were of great quality.  I liked the salami and its inherent spiciness.  The lonza could have been better.  Why not use San Daniele prosciutto instead?  The mortadella was surprisingly bland and nothing at all like what I had in Bologna.  Overall this dish was good, but I certainly have had better.\n\nEntree:  I selected the brasato al barolo with horseradish gremolata.  This was a very good dish, but it could have been great.  While braised the brasato was actually a touch dry, and there was no hint of the underlying Barolo whatsoever.  Perhaps more liberal use of the wine in the preparation and a longer cooking time could have made this divine.  The bed of polenta, and the accompanying salad were especially good.  I only wish their portion sizes were larger relative to the very large brasato.  And while the horseradish was freshly shaved before me, I failed to really pick up the taste of it in the dish, strangely.  My glass of Monica wine paired very well with this dish.\n\nDessert:  I chose two gelati, the peppermint and the ricotta cheese.  The infusion of peppermint worked very well, and I rather enjoyed this selection.  The ricotta was decent too.  This gelato falls considerably short of what can be found in Italy, but for the U.S., it is decent.  \n\nMignardises:  a tiny biscotti, and two slightly larger candies.  A thrifty selection compared to other Batali establishments, but, again, functional.\n\nOverall at this price point, I was expecting haute cuisine.  Instead, I found good Italian food at inflated prices.  The ambience was atypically boring as well.  At Lupa, Babbo, and even Otto in NY there is a hip vibe, an animated scene, and the restaurants are interesting to be in.  Not here.  This was a cookie cutter formal dining room with no flare at all.  Presentable, yet soulless like the food.\n\n\n3 stars"

            "review": "First off, how this place does not have a 5 star rating on yelp is mind-blowing. My wife and I stumbled in here one Sunday eve (on the eve our one year anniversary), and we now feel we discovered gold. After all, it is the wild west....\n\nLet's start with the service. A \"10.\". Nothing else to say. Kevin (with the cool mustache) was - besides being amazingly friendly - one of the most knowledgable staff members of anyplace we have been. And to be honest, we eat very well, all the time - whether it's home in Hollywood or in NYC, SF, Boston, Miami - whatever.  We consider ourselves well-versed and qualified to rate any place on the planet. However, personally, I enjoy most those places that are over the top special, but still straightforward - and not too, too formal. After all, we want to be comfortable. That is what B&B is.  While the room is nothing special, certainly for vegas, the Seasonal menu is not short of perfect. \n\nThe must haves:  any type of burrata salad (they change monthly, depending on their purveyor, yes, there is one person who Batalli employs for his empire who sources goods); bone marrow ravioli is like nothing you have had, the osso buco on top is just even more amazing; it was fig season, so a fig salad and a type of fig burrata br\u00fbl\u00e9e was off the charts. Also, remember, no one does burrata like Batalli. Or for that matter, meat and cheese. The lobster spaghettini just amazing.  And of course, a top 5 dish ever for me, the grilled octopus.  Everything has its own special type of vinegrette prepared for the dish. To give an example of the talent and ingredients here, one was made with the \"last press\" of olives for the season, when they \"clean\" the presses with the citrus from the same farms in italy, so the olive oil has this amazing fresh bite from the process. That's how involved and thoughtful this menu and kitchen is.  \n\nAnd that's about half of what we ordered, all with the help of Kevin, who made us feel like you are truly taking a trip through Tuscany with his knowledge and his own love for the menu and food.  You just cannot stop ordering. Yes, it's that good. My wife made me stop. \n\nTo all who say the portions are too small:  it's not the cheesecake factory.  You obviously don't eat out much.  And yes, it's not priced like it either. But what do you expect, it's in Las Vegas. But I will say, these prices would hold up in LA (as they do at Mozza in LA) because great experiences that involve expensive ingredients are not cheap. \n\nIf you are in LV anytime, you would be remiss in not going to B&B. Even  if you are solo, their bar area looks like a great place to experience this menu. The only drawback is that Kevin is not the bartender, and I think he is a giant part of that experience.  My wife even convinced me to get started on a mustache the next day, which didn't get past a week. (not for me)\n\nMy wife and I are thinking of flying in for the night just to eat here again (and maybe an hour or two of craps wouldn't hurt....)\n\nUPDATE:\n\nJust went again this past week while in town for a couple of nights. This time, with a friend from the east coast. Once again, it didn't disappoint and of course, Kevin was on his game. I am telling you, if you go there, you have to request to be in his area. It's a completely different experience there when you have someone so passionate about the ingredients and dishes there. But there are other very friendly folks working there, the bartender that night was another. \n\nYes, the bill was insane for a random tues night with an old buddy in town, but we loved it and it's worth the premium. They played the entire Queen Greatest Hits album the whole night, which is one of my favs...as I know some here on yelp think that it should be more Sinatra than classic glam rock, but they don't get it. This is not about the expected. It should have that NY/ Village energy.  Still don't get how these reviewers are killing this place."

Apparently don't tell your waiter you have no time constraints.  I was hoping to get a second glass of wine with dinner, but given the amount of time it took to get my first glass I was going to have to shotgun it in order to fit a second glass in.  The waiter never checked in or asked us how our meals were through out any of our courses.  The servers presenting and clearing the plates were more attentive.\n\nWe were looking at ordering a bottle of wine, but the price points on the wine list kept us away from doing that.  I know I'm going to pay a mark up, but I struggle with paying 3x the bottle price at any restaurant.  \n\nThe food was OK, but nothing that would bring me back.  We shared the octopus, which was good.  It was cooked perfectly and the flavors were great.  For the primi course, my boyfriend had the beef cheek ravioli and I had the linguine with clams.  The beef cheek ravioli was good, but the linguine with clams was way too salty and gritty.  I could get past the grit, but the salt level made the dish inedible.  The one thing I got out of that dish was feeling better about my own imperfect linguine w/clams.  For our main course we both had the short rib.  It was very tender, but half way through the meal it started to get dry.  I didn't care for the greens that they served on top.  They didn't seem to stand up to the heat of the dish and just got warm soggy\n\nI really wanted to enjoy this dinner, but it was just average."

How you can make a seafood linguine for $29 dollars is beyond me.  I'm guessing their clams are clammier than your normal clam.  Or found in some distant, unknown cove in the Sea of Tranquility.  If so, I couldn't tell.  Seemed like a normal seafood linguine to me.  As for my beef cheek ravioli, I'm sure Mr. Batali's idea for creating this dish was \"Let's stuff everything that's tasty into a small pouch.  Texturally, it felt like I was eating baby food.  And it was too rich.  Every bite felt like eating a pillowcase of butter.\n\nBut!  Though the food is lacking, the service is impeccable.\n\nYou stay classy Las Vegas!"

Then our salads came out and again they were way over salted, it was almost all we could taste was the salt. Then they brought my fish to the table to show me it was cooked whole and stated they would be back with it after they de-boned it. They carried my fish around the restaurant as they stopped at other tables. Next they took my fish over to the hostess at the little wine bar and she began picking the bones out of my fish with one knife and her fingers. Other servers came by and leaned their noses over my fish to take a smell. They finally brought my half mutilated fish to me which was now cold and once again extremely over salted. I was very disappointed that the server didn't explain to the chef that after our first course the food was way to salty it could have at least allowed us to enjoy the rest of our meal. Maybe he did tell the chef and he didn't care. It was just a shame because we could tell if it wasn't for the extreme salt overload the food would have been delicious. It almost seemed like a joke someone was playing on us, we will make the most delicious food and then dump a mound of salt on it just to piss you off.  Then we received a $350 dollar bill for a dinner we didn't even eat and left hungry.  What a shame!!!!!"

It was a small but well orchestrated dish. Very fresh and crisp taste with some hints of citrus elements. There is a light dressing that accents the fresh crisp taste of the dish.\n\nI got the pork chop for my entree. This was VERY good. Very thick cut which was heavily seasoned (which I prefer). Overall a savory taste. Had a nice crust on outside, and very moist tasty inside. The dish was covered in a sweet glaze that I believe was derived from dates. It had some fresh greens on top which added a nice earthy contrast. I think this plate was in the $40-50 range.\n\nA vodka tonic I think ran around $14-16/drink. \n\nGreat meal, but still doesn't match the price.

The sommelier was also very knowlegeable and helped us choose a very nice Italian Sauvignon Blanc to go with our dinner choices.  The prices are appropriate for the quality of the food and the preparation that goes into it.  This is fine Italian dining by a world class chef and worth every cent.

His off the wall food parings and usage of offals and uncommon ingredients are a pleasant surprise from the everyday fair of chicken breast pasta or linguini and clams.\n  You must be a true foodie to really enjoy the techniques and matchings that Batali uses in his dishes. \n  We ordered the Warm Tripe A'la Parmegana, Baby Octopus with Lemonchillo vinaigrette, Rabbit with leeks and brussel sprouts, Beef Cheek Ravioli with black truffles and crused duck liver, and the mint love lamb ravioli (strange name).\n   Warm Tripe was probably the best tripe that i have every had.  It was in a nicely spiced tomato sauce with a parmesan cheese gratan and served with two rustic pieces of country style bread.  The tripe melted in my  mouth and had no gamey or off taste at all.  The bread was burnt.... :( \n   The Baby Octopus was also a great dish.  The octopus had a lovely smooth texture very similar to squid.  We could really taste the nice grilled flavor on the octopus.  The lemonchillo vinagrette added a nice tangy zip to the dish and left your mouth with a very clean feel.    \n   Beef Cheek Ravioli with black truffle and crushed duck liver sauce was a very rich dish.  Definately get this dish as a share item for the table even.  A ture foodies will really appreciate this dish.  The ultra smooth texture of the beef cheeks with a very meaty flavor held up beautifully with the very rich sauce.  The sauce was like eatting foie gras black truffle pate, thinned with a bit of cream and pasted all over the ravioli.  Very decadent.  The only down fall with this dish, and i think with all of his pasta dishes, is that there is no throught of platting this dish nicely.  It look as if the chefs went from pan to plate.  NO ARRANGEMENT what so ever in any of the pasta dishes I saw....but then again that could be Batali's thing, purposly not plating pastas to make them look rustic...\n   Rabbit with leeks and Brussel sprouts.  Rabbit was cooked perfectly maintaining all of its moisture through out the loin and the leg meat.  This was a very simple dish but done excellently.  I wish there was more brussel sprouts though...i love them.\n   OK...the mint love lamb ravioli...again presentation sucked.  Flavors were a very interesting play on lamb with mint jelly.  I thought that the mint was a bit overpowering for the dish but the lamb flavor really did hold its own.  \n\n   Atmosphere was very bistro-ish...with a fell of Japaneses accents.  Dark wooded frames/boxes, bottles and bottles of wine line the walls and the bar.  Dress was very casual, some very nicely dressed...some in shorts...hey, its vegas.\n\n   Service was very pleasant, but over the top.  We had our server, a bread server, a water server.  New silverware came with every course and I loved the cool little wooden box that they carried the silverware in.  Our water glasses were never empty.   Our server connected with our table very well and was very personable to us.  None of that stuffiness you might expect going into a nicer restaurant.   \n  \n  We had to skip dessert to see a show but overall this restaurant was what I expected from Mario Batali.   You really must understand the type of cuisine that Mario Batali likes to cook in order to truly enjoy this restaurant.\n\n   If your more into a meat a potatoes place, try Mario Batali's Carnevino in the new Palazzo Hotel."

The heirloom tomatoes were busting with fresh tomato flavor and the burrata was good enough to sing about. \n\nOn to the Bucatini 'all'Amatriciana' (with Guanciale, Hot Pepper and Pecorino). We first fell in love with Bucatini 'all'Amatriciana in Rome, and order it whenever we find it on a menu. This one did not disappoint - the salty/savory/spicy combination in the sauce was sublime. \n\nNext up, Batali's interpretation on calamari: Spicy Two Minute Calamari \"Sicilian Lifeguard Style\". We inquired about the whole \"Sicilian Lifeguard Style\" thing and our server explained that Batali put himself into the mind of your average Sicilian lifeguard and then asked himself \"what would I like to eat?\" And thus his Two Minute Calamari was born. The calamari came in a spicy tomato broth with several large caper berries, some Israeli couscous and a sweet fruity bit (currant, maybe?) that actually seemed a bit at odds with the rest of the flavors. And as it turns out, two minutes for calamari is just perfect. \n\nWe also ordered a side of charred corn, but this never arrived at the table. Which turned out okay, as we were stuffed by the time we saw the bottom of the bowl of calamari."

The grilled octopus with fagioli marinati and spicy limoncello vinaigrette appetizer is very lemony with nice char and smoke.  \n\nThe gnocchi with lamb ragu and mint is okay but the evenly ribbed texture alerts me to this being a packaged gnocchi versus one made fresh.  It's been my experience that when you see one with a smooth texture it looks and tastes like it was made by someone's hand and when you see the even ribbed texture it looks and tastes like it was made by a machine.  \n\nBella has the gnocchi with escarole, prosciutto cotto and smoked ricotta which she said was \"very Chinese\" in the way it was prepared.  The grilled brussel sprouts with Lardo and lemon and Di Cecco broccoli with peperoncino and garlic sides were solid.  \n\nBoth of us went \"gah gah\" over the Affogato with vanilla bean gelato.  This dessert is ready to consume once our waiter finishes pouring slightly warm espresso into the martini glass containing the gelato.  We immediately order a second due to our love for this simple yet tasty dessert.  \n\nMy advice would be to select Batali's LA or NYC restaurants over this one.  The food and the service were noticeably better in those other establishments."

We were greeted by a server and asked for our drink order.  Two of the guests ordered a cocktail and the server came back with the wrong order.  He took the two drinks back and came back with the wrong drinks again. One of the guests offered to drink it anyway so it wouldn't go to waste but the server told them that if he left it there, he would have to charge for the drink.  For getting the order wrong twice, he should have given the drinks for free!  The other three (including me) ordered a bottle of wine and the server brought only one glass for the wine.  I know it was loud in there but I clearly told him that \"the three of us are going to have wine with our veal chop and rib eye.\" He even recommended the wine to drink with our meals. Not sure where his mind was. He was very nice but just couldn't get the order right.  \nThe garbanzo bruschetta that was brought to us in the beginning was a nice touch.  We ordered the octopus as an appetizer and it was very delicious. It was the most tender octopus I have ever had. They also brought us a slice of cold bread for each. It was a little hard and did not offer to bring more.\nThe meals took a long time to come out. Th server explained to us that the rib eye for two took longer because it was so big. He quoted us 15 more minutes but it seemed longer than that. Maybe the chef was too busy in the kitchen.  Once the food came out, I struggled with my veal chop.  It was not tender and it was difficult to wrangle. I asked for a steak knife but they did not have one. The veal was very tasty but it had too much fat for me and it was not tender enough.  The rib eye that my friends has was better. It melted in your mouth! The other two guests were also happy with their meals.  We shared two desserts: the trio of gelatos and the flourless chocolate cake.  They were both really good but the gelato lacked presentation. The three scoops were piled on top of each other in a small metal dish.   \nI would have given it a 4 but I was not ok with the mistakes that the server made. I saw a man in a suit walking around the restaurant (I assumed the manager) and never came to our table to see how everything was. There was table with some celebrities next to ours and a lot of focus was given to them.  But everyone should be treated equally in a high end establishment such as that.  If I were a server and made three mistakes with the order, I would have told the manager to visit the table.  For being an expensive restaurant, I expect better and more attentive service."

I ordered that here and for 22 dollars, I felt that it was not any better than my Costco mozzarella I get.  The 2 week old olive oil was excellent on it, but I was not impressed.  My companion had the grilled octopus which he said was the best he has ever had at 18 dollars.  He has had some experience with grilled octopus with spending time sailing around the Aegean sea.  I had a chestnut pasta (I'm vegetarian) which was good, but was very small.  I doubt if there were 15 pieces of small stuffed pasta.  My companion had the Barramundi which was filleted at the table which he stated was very good.  I had a citrus fruit desert that was light and delicious.  Service was attentive."

So many years idolizing you and trying to get reservations to your restaurant in New York Babbo but to no avail so I was so excited in trying your Italian cuisine. First the seating was horrible. I sat on the booth side and there is a definite flaw in the design. The seat is too low and the table to high making it uncomfortable to eat.  I was not the only person to comment on it. Another party sat beside us and they quickly commented how odd the seating was and asked to move.  The seating was just the beginning, the service was not great.  The waitress forgot the side dish altogether and didn't even let us know about the chocolate budino (souffl\u00e9) which usually takes 20 minutes and is customary to ask if you would be wanting so they could prepare beforehand. We ordered the orecchiette with lamb sausage and rapini. The dish was good, but nothing out of this world. The octopus was the only dish we had that I considered to be worthy of a four and five star restaurant.  I had the rabbit porchetta which was different, but wouldn't order again. We also had the Veal Chop which was  good. Not even the dessert was pulled off.  We ordered the chocolate cake served with a peanut butter shake. The chocolate cake was hard as if it was frozen, on the other hand the milk shake was phenomenal. The seating, service and dishes that were average contributed my 3.5 stars. I am disappointed since I have been a fan of Mario Batali for many years and I refuse to believe this is all there is so I will be going to Lunch at his other restaurant Otto. Hopefully this will help restore my vision of him as a master of Italian cuisine."

My dining companion and I stuck to the appetizers and pastas per the smarmy but likable barkeep's exhortations (we sat at the bar). To our delight, every dish was fairly exquisite, the octopus salad and mint love letters filled with lamb were especially notable. Expensive, but worth every penny.\n\nMy second time I relied on the trusty barkeep's wisdom once again, ordering mostly apps and pastas, but was severely disappointed. Dishes whose flavors had popped off the tongue on my first visit were either bland or pathetically exaggerated on my second. \n\nI'm still struggling to figure out what happened...did the restaurant just have a bad night? Doubt it -- kitchens can fuck up a dish or two on any given night, but not an entire meal amongst 4 diners. Did my fleeting Mario Batali man-crush cloud my judgment during my first visit? Maybe. As much as I love flowing red locks atop a greasy Italian belly wearing clogs (I don't), my taste buds have been through enough heartache to know not to be swindled by infatuation. Maybe I was too shell-shocked from all the silicone and awful dye-jobs to taste the food my first time. Most likely I got stuck with the backup chef my second time. But any restaurant worth its salt shouldn't vascillate that dramatically with its second stringer behind the pans. Cuz if that's the gamble I have to take when I walk through the door, I'm taking my shit elsewhere. \n\nSo a measly 2 stars for your Vegas joint, Mario. Not Michelin stars, Yelp stars. Consistency matters.\n\np.s. it's also irritating as shit to walk into a half-empty dining room to be told that they're \"completely booked,\" and we'd have to sit at the bar while your gamboholic comps gum it up at the craps table, flanked by some plastic flusies. but that's vegas, and what's to be expected when dining on the strip. which is why i try to avoid it."

I think what bothered me the most was the waiter was told we were sharing a burger yet he did not advise it was a 3 ounce patty that was smashed to a very thin size. We told him we wanted to share a burger but he did not suggest something else which seems to indicate he did not care whether we were pleased with the food or the service. If I were the waiter, I would've suggested a larger burger to share. Nonetheless, the whole place was a disappointment as was the service. We also had to wait a long time to get our burger and we were the only ones in the restaurant."

If you have the time do one of their seasonal tasting menus, which constantly change. One is a pasta tasting menu and the other changes, this month it is a truffle tasting menu, the lady next to me at the bar had it and it looked really good.\n\nI had housemade mortadella today and that was delish. Chestnut and Mascarpone agnolotti was also amazing. The octopus salad with spicy limocello vinaigrette is also another must. If you can catch it this month, the mascarpone loose cheesecake with a sugar crust and cara cara oranges is to die for! And the hazelnut and salted caramel gelato too!\n\nMontenegro amaro is a must to end your meal."

I sort of want to give it a 4-star review, but given the prices and the supposed \"master chef\" expectations, I guess it doesn't deserve it.\n\nThere were a bunch of us at the table and I won't go into details of everything we ordered, but there was just about everything from the menu put on the table and we shared a lot of it.  I probably tried 10 different dishes including rabbit, fish, veggies, lobster, etc.  The food was solid, but I was a bit disappointed because everything I tried was decent or just good.  Nothing blew me away.  My main dish was the whole striped bass which was quite good, but unfortunately had to be eaten with the skin on, which is not my preference (for possible health concerns of eating fish skin - the taste is great though).\n\nIn the end, my wife asked me if it was worth the price (since it is pretty darn expensive) and the answer is no.  Would I go back?  No - unfortunately.  It's not that it didn't taste good, it's that you can pay the same overpriced rate elsewhere and get a better meal.  So in that case, it must be less than 4 stars."

I voted for B&B because I like Mario Batali and his little orange shoes. \n\nWe sat down and were asked if we were on a time crunch or had any shows to attend. We didn't, but later thought maybe we should have lied. Service could have been perceived as slow but I sort of liked the pace. I didn't feel rushed to shove food down my throat. \n\nMost of us had two courses instead of the four on the menu. I started with the artichoke salad. My first bite was super tart (thanks lemon!), but the parmigiano was a fantastic contrast. I ate the whole salad, and honestly would have been fine with just that. \n\nMy main course was the rabbit porchetta. My friends selected other items: blue crab ravioli, Jose's Pyramids and the short rib. \n\nThe rabbit porchetta seemed like the largest portion. The rabbit was a tad salty but perhaps that was for the best. I really enjoyed the dish. It was served on a bed of peas and lima beans. This may have been the only time in my life that I enjoyed lima beans.\n\nThe blue crab ravioli (from the bite I took) was very rich and the 8 or so raviolis seemed almost like too much. For anyone saying there were too few, well, we must have very different preferences. \n\nMy two other friends (with the short ribs and Jose's Pyramids) were really happy with their selections as well.\n\nI honestly felt the service was really good. They ensured we had full waters, refilled wine glasses and bread between courses. We received complementary chick peas bruschetta at the beginning and some collection of tiny desserts at the end. It looks like other reviewers weren't impressed with the chickpeas bruschetta. It was a little oily, I suppose, but I thought it was so tasty, it just didn't matter!\n\n\nThe bathrooms are nice too. I'm a huge fan of the Dyson Airblade. Nice choice, guys!"

This was probably the most disappointing dinner we have ever had.  We started with the octopus and calamari. The octopus was far too salty and inedible.  The calamari was chewy and bland.  The main courses we had were the lamb and linguine with clams.  The rack of lamb was composed of about half fat.  My wife had the linguine and the noodles were hard and chewy.  When she asked about the chewiness of the noodles they took the plate back and said they would prepare a new one.  They brought the same plate back just hotter (probably in the microwave).

Managed to snag a last-minute reservation on a whim, but by the time we left I was almost irritated with the overall experience.\nThe appetizers we selected were awesome, the pasta we shared was terrific, but everything after that was extremely underwhelming. Best advice is to sit at the bar, order apps and some pastas to share, or do the tasting menu. \n\nStarted with a complimentary CHICKPEA BRUSCHETTA that was interesting but not something I'd suggest they add to the menu any time soon.\nPORK TROTTER ALLA MILANESE with Roasted Tomato and Cannellini Bean Vinaigrette (BF's favorite) and WARM LAMB'S TONGUE with Chanterelle Mushrooms and a 3-Minute Egg (my favorite)- both really good, would get again.\n\nShared the HOMEMADE ORECCHETTE with Spicy Lamb Sausage and Rapini, which was very nice. The pasta was perfectly fresh and chewy, the lamb and rapini paired well together, and the sauce didn't overwhelm the other ingredients.  Made me wish I'd just ordered different pasta dishes instead of meat-based entrees.\n\nRABBIT PORCHETTA with Peperonata, Sunflower Sprouts and Crispy Confit was underwhelming and slightly overcooked. Wasn't wowed by this at all.\nGRILLED PORK CHOP with Kuri Kuri Squash, Apples in \"Agrodolce\" and Green Walnut: I'm not a fan of pork chops and apple sauce, but this upscale version worked. The chop was flavorful, fatty, and salty but the squash and apples mellowed it out well. Wouldn't get this again, though, this isn't really what I'm coming to a Batali restaurant for.\n\nLastly, we ended with the TIRAMISU with espresso gelato: BF's pick as I didn't want dessert at all. We received the plate with the gelato already mostly melted, forming a puddle of soup. I would have taken a picture of the travesty, but wanted to get at least a single bite. Not impressed at all.\nReceived a complimentary dessert sampler of bite-size goodies like meringue and biscotti: these nibbles were better than the dessert we actually ordered, which somehow just made me more irritated about spending $14 on melted gelato.\n\nADDITIONAL DETAILS: I suggest sitting at the bar because the dining room tables are so close together and the majority of the smaller tables for couples are alongside the open wall by the walkway. The passing traffic was so noisy that I couldn't comfortably carry on conversation even before parties were seated on either side of us. After that? Forget it, everything had to be repeated several times.\nThe service, while knowledgeable, was not personable. Whatever.\nEverything ordered after the pasta was mediocre, and the fact that half of my dessert was melted when it reached me is an oversight I don't expect when dining at a restaurant of this caliber."

It was an expensive and bland disappointment.  First off, the wine menu is all Italian and overly priced. We spent over $300 for two bottles of mediocre wine.  \n\nOur server although pleasant, seem bored and uneducated with the menu.  I can see why.  Our table decided to do the pasta tasting menu. What a disappointment!  From the bland, first course tagliatelle through the ending of the undercooked budino, I was underwhelmed.\n\nThe tortellini was medicinal, the pyramids and beef cheek ravioli tasted extremely similar, and we didn't get the foie gras ravioli. Instead we got a super spicy squid ink spaghetti.  This actually was my favorite course because I adore very spicy dishes. But only two people at our table of eight could eat it because of the spiciness and it pretty much killed my palate for the rest of the night.\n\nNow for the last two courses, which were dessert (not pasta of any type), it was a steep downhill.  I really thought the chef could've been more creative and incorporated some type of pasta in both of these desserts to stick with the theme.  But instead there were two completely uneventful and downright disgusting desserts.  The first one consisted of what tasted like store-bought pastry and a toothpaste consistency of lemon spread on top.  After everyone took one bite, no one finished it at our table.  And the budino, as stated before, was an undercooked mess.\n\nOur entire table was so disappointed and I felt I was to blame since I wanted to go here.  Never again and I will not recommend it to anyone.  With a restaurant named after two well-known chefs, I expected more talent and taste over the hype."

            "review": "Yet another one of Batali's projects. His picture is all over the Venetian in order to promote it. It is where all the other restaurants are, but tucked away in a corner, with a little flag to hail you.\n\nThe recent Batali restaurant I ate at was Mozza, which didn't quite suit my taste and so I had some biased expectations. But a look at the menu cast all those skepticisms aside, as it was filled with things that aren't what you see in a conventional place, such as tripe, tongue, and brain. That fascinated me and I remembered reading Tony Bourdain's words that chefs are now able to explore a bit more by putting such things on their menus, and people are starting to accept them more. \n\nYou are greeted by Batali's books at the door, but they are not shoved in your face as Bobby Flay's face is when you enter Mesa Grill. And in fact, once you step into the dining room you can easily forget about them. A very cozy place with a wall full of wine bottles. Simple dark near-black wood theme with clean white tables, and a center table for the workers, which also is a clever interior design job. The center table is where all the waiters put the finishing touches of your dishes, all the little garnishes and de-boning of the fish are done in the center of the dining room. Its center piece is a giant but slim vase with tall sunflowers (real!) that just touch the ceiling, which shortens the ceiling to the eyes and hence gives the place a more intimate and cozier feeling (even though it is standard ceiling height). And there are many servers that come in and out of the kitchen and mingle at the center table, giving the whole dining room a very live and bright feeling, without unnecessary flashy colors that I've seen way too may restaurants have.\n\nThe hostess offered me and my date a small table, then asked us if we preferred to sit side by side, and proceeded to turn the table sideways for us just so we could sit closer. Is this fine dining service? I've *never* had this offered to me before, and she even rotated the silverware for us. \n\nA little gift from the chef to start the meal, chick pea bruschetta on tiny little toasts. Very simple, yet curiously good. I swear I tasted olives but I have no idea where they were. The appetizer we ordered was three goat cheese truffles, little balls of goat cheese rolled around in spices. We first had the pimenton, or smoked paprika, which gave my mouth a nice little tingle with a bit of tang, a sign of very good paprika. Then the fennel seed powder was more bitter, and to my delight it brought out a whole new part of goat cheese's flavor. Next was poppy seeds, which again was a different experience, and that was when we also explored the roasted bell peppers, which was very fresh and very well prepared, and together with the goat cheese it was a different world.\n\nWe decided to try two different raviolis that interested me, one with lamb brains and the other with beef cheek meat. The lamb brain was incredibly smooth, the sauce for the \"postage-stamp-sized\" ravioli was nothing but butter with a bit of lemon and sage, very rich but you don't notice it until you leave. The beef-cheek ravioli was the opposite personality, big and meaty with very intense beef flavor. The crushed duck liver and truffles made it very savory. \n\nBombolonis were shared for dessert, essentially donut holes that were served with melted dark chocolate. They give you plenty of chocolate too, that went down in spoonfuls. The waiter came to check on how we were doing and all the food was gone.\n\nAll the staff was young but mature and warm. It was a pleasure to talk to them, the entire atmosphere is laid back. I especially appreciate its location as it is away around a corner, unlike Mesa Grill where you are staring right at the slot machines as you eat. Quite easily you can forget that you are in a casino in the chaos that is Vegas, it has a mood of its own that suits me very well. Casual, with no pretension, all it is about is enjoying food.\n\nMozza might not have suited me so much but seeing this place and seeing the difference and the direction of Batali's passion for various aspects of food makes me respect him highly as a celebrity chef, and look forward to what his next adventure will be."

The waiter Jered added much to the overall dining experience, as he elaborately described the history/culture surrounding each dish and described the wine notes and rationale for each pairing. The wines were excellently paired with each dish and portions were reasonable. Courses came at a very leisure pace, which we enjoyed - dinner lasted 2 hours. Price of dinner was just under $400 for the two of us (tip not included)...yes, pricey but quite honestly, the best fine dining experience we've ever had, and for that, the dinner was well worth it! I wouldn't recommend this for the casual diner or even those looking for only a romantic setting, but for true foodies that love wine pairings at its finest, I definitely recommend B&B Ristorante!"

People should be shot for trying to order anything else.\n\n5 courses of pasta perfection, in a whirlwind of flavors and textures.  From the pungent gorgonzola nudi, to the creamy and decadent goose liver ravioli, it's an experience like no other.\n\n4-stars because the pasta tasting menu at B&B is $30 more than than the same menu in NYC for no good reason at all.\n\nDidn't think I'd catch that, eh Batali!!??!\nIf your food weren't so damn good, I'd have to bitch-slap that Italian face of yours for price gouging me like that, pisano!"

One of my favorite things in the world is Bucatini alla'Amatriciana and I adore Chef Mario Batali's recipe for this amazing dish, so I was very excited to see it on the menu.  The pasta tasting also sounded amazing so we were very excited.  \n\nWe were greeted with very exceptional service.  Specials were explained, questions were listened to attentively, and special requests were honored with grace.  Almost all of us decided to get some type of Prixe Fix menu.  \nThe cocktails were amazing, including the Italiano Mule (Blood Orange).  \n\nThey allowed me to try my favorite Amatricana as a replacement for the pasta course, but charged me an extra ten dollars for this replacement (they charge the same replacement fee for the LOBSTER pasta).  I was a little surprised as Amatricana is only about four ingredients and is relatively inexpensive to make.  Were they just charging for the inconvenience of having to make something off of the prixe fix? \nWhen the pasta came I was disappointed to see a large amount of whole parsley leaves.  Parsley is never and ingredient in this dish and it completely overpowered the delicate flavor of the guanciale.  It was not everything I had built it up to be.  \nThe short ribs were also disappointing, not enough sauce and served over very boring polenta.  I could not taste the horseradish at all.  \n\nOur friends that got the pasta tasting had some exceptional pastas that were beautifully prepared and tasted delicious.  The octopus appetizer was quite lovely as well.\n\nThey very kindly brought me panna cotta with a Happy Birthday Message but unfotunately the panna cotta was absolutely awful.  It was not sweet at all and had the consistency of hardened paste.  \n\nThe food overall was well cooked, almost everything tasted good and the service was very fine, but for the price and considering who owns the restaurant, I was expecting perfection."

It was literally inedible.  Back to the great customer service, above - the cost was removed from our tab. But, we came expecting perfection....\n\nMy meal was a seafood pasta, which was good however the pasta was a much too al dente for my tastes, it was very chewy and difficult to eat.  \n\nThe two stars on the review are for the Octopus and the Service.  if you are in the Venetian, stop by for a mixed drink and enjoy that appetizer with a cocktail.

Our waiter was so knowledgable about the menu which helped guide our ordering. But one thing he wasn't helpful with was how much to order. He suggested that each person order 1 appetizer/salad, 1 primi (pasta dish) and 1 secondi (meat/fish dish). We did this and whoaaa way too mucho food. After the primi, we were sufficiently full. When the secondi's arrived, we were all overwhelmed with the amount of food to eat. The food was good though-grilled octopus delicious, beef cheek ravioli & bucatini really great & I liked the branzino & pork chop (we all shared). My best advice would be just to order a starter & a primi or a secondi (not both). Unless you want leftovers, which is hard to do when you're in Vegas and most likely do not want to lug the food back to your room and then you have no way to heat it up (unless you're staying at an extended stay type room)."

The antipasti were good, although executed with an overly complex blend of flavors to our taste. I found the pasta to be bland. The hanger steak was very good, the short ribs good, the pork chop not good at all, extremely under cooked in one part, over done in the other. The potatoes a bit dried out, broccoli was actually fried broccolini. Service was excellent. For a high end restaurant, the culinary experience was very disapointing.

Of course, I share this letter with the world, because I also want the world to know what an amazing team you have at B&B, most notably Terra!\n\nMy experience began with a group of 11 in the private \"Grotto\" wine cellar room. From start to finish, not only was the cuisine Iron Chef worthy, it was Terra and her team who made it truly memorable. Balancing the varying palates and experience levels of so many people, Terra made it easy, fun and adventurous for all of us to try so many first and second courses from which we might otherwise have shied away. I lost count of how many different dishes we tried, but I can tell you that every dish was relished by every one of us!\n\nTerra made such an impression on me that I asked if it would be possible to request a dinner reservation with her again the very next night. I considered this a longshot, since the \"next night\" was a Friday, but without hesitation Terra assured me that she'd get me a table and with her as our  server. To be honest, there were several other very tempting fine dining restaurant choices available without even having to leave the Palazzo or Venetian, but none of those other venues had Terra. While your kitchen crew deserves all due credit for providing fabulous cuisine, your team on the floor made it an absolutely perfect experience.\n\nThank you!"

For the entree, we split the pappardelle bolognese and the pasta was cooked perfectly; the sauce was delicious and well seasoned....BUT....the overall dish was too salty for my taste.  Apparently they cook the pasta in water that is supposed to taste of the sea....which individually was divine; but together with the sauce the whole dish was salt overload.  However, the cocktails that we were served were the most unique and eclectic drinks we had EVER had....no joke.  My fiance is a gourmet chef and I was a bartender that fiddled with mixology.  The whole experience was refreshing and enjoying considering its hard to go out to eat without finding something wrong with the place.

However, if you talk to my fiance, and he will tell you a different story. \n\nI first came here when it was fairly new. I remember waiting for a bit to get seated, even though we had reservations. But I didn't mind; the white wine I had kept me preoccupied. Actually, I must say, their wine selection is what seriously stood out more than the food itself. I was able to enjoy a bottle of a white and a red wine which totaled more than $400.\n\nI recall that during my first time, the pasta entree my fiance bought was a bit too \"al dente.\" The server offered to have it prepared less al dente but we just sent it back without asking for an another dish. Instead, I shared my gnocchi with him, which was decent, but nothing extraordinary.\n\nDid I mention, this place has THE BEST calimari I've ever had the pleasure of munching on?! The squid was so tender, the spices and citrus flavors were very well balanced, the breading was perfect and the bits of cauliflower was a nice touch. At 18/19 bucks it better damn well be the best! :P\n\nAnyway, my second visit was...anti-climactic. I was hoping I'd have a very similar time as my first visit but something was missing. The service was subpar and my salmon was...OK for 40 bucks. I felt like I was being served by someone at TGI Fridays at some points, which is not a big deal if you're trying to make a classy restaurant have a more casual atmosphere. I also thought the salmon wasn't as fresh tasting as I would expect and wasn't the best quality I had. At least the herbs, spices and citrus flavors along with it being grilled brought the salmon together nicely; it just would have been nice if the salmon itself was of better quality.  My fiance's lamb was superb and of course, the calamari did not disappoint. \n\nOverall, I think I'd go again...only if someone pays and their calmari does not run out or experiences a change."

My goodness, they were amazing!!! I was really amazed at how good they were! They were like chicken nuggets, but more crunchy and flavorful!!\n\nI had a special of pork ragu and penne pasta. I was really disappointed. It was too salty and lacked flavor. This is why they are getting 4 stars instead of 5. Ragu and pasta should be pretty easy for an Italian restaurant to get right....\n\nAlso, be sure to ask for tap water and not bottled....they charge 7 dollars per bottle of water! But you can get free water...if you want. \n\nSeveral other reviewers have discussed the bread and how disappointed they were in it. I found the bread to be very good and very Italian. I felt like I was back in Italy when I bit into it. Good Italian bread has a hard crust and chewy interior. While it was served cold, it tasted very fresh and authentic. \n\nAll in all, our tab was about 150 dollars (before tip) which was about what we expected. \n\nWill I go back? Probably not because there are so many different places to try! But, I am really glad I went."

I had the pasta with lobster and found the dish to be a bit greasy and lobster undercooked.  The wines by the glass were limited and quite expensive, even with paying a Las Vega premium.  What really ruined the evening was the whole doggy bag situation. Rather than just wrapping our food, they wrap it then give you a ticket so you can pick it up at the hostess stand.  We ended up with three bags.  I took my ticket and retrieved the bags. I then went back to the bar to retrieve my dining companion.   Out of nowhere a suited man comes after me as said \"ma'am, I need to see your ticket.\"  I told him I didn't have a ticket because I gave it to the hostess.  He then asked to look in my bags.  I asked if he was accusing me of stealing doggie bags and noted that if I were doing so why would I come back into the restaurant.  I never got a real apology.  Just an explanation that 3 doggie bags was unusual (as though I packed them!).  I suggested that it might be nice to give us a free dessert or knock a glass of wine off the bill.  They didn't see the point. The whole think was ridiculous and put a damper on the evening. Over a doggie bag!! We spent a lot of money at B&B.  I didn't expect to be treated like that. I will not be returning."

There were two standouts, though everything was excellent: the polenta pasta (cresc'tajat) with truffles was simple and beautiful and the fettuccine with Norcino ragu had beautifully married flavors. With respect to the fettuccine, Adam told me that the ragu takes over 8 hours to prepare. It shows and is well worth the time. Lovely.\n\nAm I effusing? Yes. But, it was really that good. I love excellent food and really appreciate great service. I found both at B & B. Please, don't miss it."

We went only for drinks, and didn't try any of the food. \n\nThe bartender was making custom cocktails for the group, based on each person's preferences. In some instances he was modifying a popular drink to make it more to their liking, and in other cases just creating a drink that didn't exist. He'd ask what you favorite liquor is and then a little bit about the types of flavors you like, and he'd whip something up. One by one I heard people oohing and aahing and saying how perfect their drinks were. I was a little skeptical, and I knew the drinks were pricey. However, the coworker nearest me relayed what I had told her earlier about my preferences, and the bartender started mixing something up for me. And it was fantastic! It was so good I ordered a second one, despite the fact that it was almost $20 a drink, and I knew I'd be drinking for free at the blackjack table later. \n\nThe ambience was fantastic and the service even better.

It was a tight rush but we arrived at B&B with 1 minute to spare (literally) straight from our check-in at the MGM. The hostess seated us right away.\n\nI ordered my mom a glass of Moscato di' Asti which is very sweet (usually served as a dessert wine) and slightly sparkling. I got a glass of the Barolo Lecinquevigne Damilano 2004 from Piemonte. If you like sweeter drinks then I would definitely recommend the Moscato. Its the highest quality that I have ever had. It tasted like they were crushing the Muscat grapes in my mouth. The Barolo was nice but I think I was hoping it would be a little bolder. \n\nWe got the Grilled Octopus with Limoncello vinaigrette for our starter. The best! I thought it was going to be like a salad with octopus but the octopus is really the feature of this dish (and you get alot of it). They serve the octopus on top of a flagolet beans + pickled red onions. The sweetness of the red onion (candied a little?) contrasts really well against the tartness of the limoncello. But the smokiness of the Octopus (cooked perfectly by the way) is what really makes this dish shine.\n\nFor my main I ordered the Beef Cheek Ravioli with Duck Liver in a brown butter sauce. Obviously this dish isn't for the faint of heart (no pun intended). The butter sauce has alot of goodies from the ravioli's so its a very rich dish through and through. If was good but if I went back for a 2nd time I would probably get the bucatini or the branzini. My mom ordered the black spaghetti with nduja and sicilian pesto. She really liked it (me not so much) but she's a spicy person. The waiter warned that theres some type of red pepper that is used when they make the sausage used in the dish and that is why it is so hot. \n\nWe ordered the chocolate torte with candied hazelnuts and salted caramel gelato for the birthday girl. My mom is a \"death by chocolate\" sort of girl. She loved this dessert but I can't do desserts this sweet. So I ordered a cappucino and it was really good. \n\nAll in all a good experience. Only slight negatives of the night were the cold slices of bread they give you (pre meal) and are waiter was a newby. You could definitely tell he hadn't spent any time working his way up from buser to server. Sommelier made good wine recommendations and the bus boys were on it."

For 6 of us, we ordered a number of appetizers and pastas to split amongst the table.  For entrees, we got the aged rib eyes, which while good, were not as amazing as the waiter described.  I would probably go for something else next time.   \n\nGreat way to start the night.  Go to XS or Marquee after dinner here to have an amazing night."

            "review": "Restaurant Week Dinner menu 2015 review. \n\nThe Skinny: delicious pastas,  subpar secondi(3.5) service: very attentive (4) value: expensive for the level of cuisine (3).\n\nI wanted to try B&B's 4 course restaurant week tasting menu for $50 which is a great deal considering what they normally charge to eat here. \n\nThey started us off with an amuse bouche of chickpeas/cumin/basil bruschetta.  This wasn't anything to write home about (a little bland) and the way it was served made it difficult to eat with all the chickpeas falling off the croustini. \n\nA wonderful crusty loaf with EVOO and balsamic was provided for their bread service. It wasn't warm but the crunch/perfectly dense texture of the bread hit the spot and we both consumed two thick slices each by the end of the evening. \n\nWe both got the salad course which was a mixture of field green served with some parmesan cheese. This was an okay dish for me.  The salad was overly dressed and slightly wilting from the dressing. \n\nThe primi dishes offered were the pork trotter ravioli with cherry tomatoes and the garganelli with summer squash. Both pasta dishes were exquisite in terms of flavor and execution. The ravioli filling tasted like a porky bone marrow and the tomatoes provide just that right amount of sweetness and acidity to cut through the richness. The garganelli was a surprisingly simplistic dish which highlighted the freshness of the ingredients and also executed extremely well. \n\nWe chose the pork loin with wax beans/arugula/fennel and the short rib with polenta. \n\nThe pork loin dish was more of a riff on a lighter version of a bacon and bean dish. The issues I had with the dish were largely the uneven seasoning of the dish itself. The various beans and mildly smokey pork loin were a bit heavy on the salt. The sauce underneath the dish was great and mellowed it out somewhat. Arugula and fennel added a bit of lightness to an otherwise heavier dish. The portion size on the pork loin was small (two very thin slices) for a secondi. \n\nShort rib with polenta was a disappointment. The short rib was quite tender but was surprisingly bland. The polenta texture was a bit thin while the vegetables (large celery flavored) were rather one note. Portion size was okay but the taste overall just wasn't there. Pass on this dish. \n\nDessert was a nice light gelati. The blackberry was stellar while the chocolate was only okay for me as it had a mild grainy texture to it. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the pasta and completely skip the entr\u00e9es and appetizers. Given the experience I had,  the food gets a 3.5 only because of the delicious pasta dishes. The other courses left me feeling unimpressed. When you factor in cost, this joint leaves me ambivalent about returning as there are other better high end Italian restaurants in the city that provide more bang for your buck. (3 stars)"

We ordered a bottle of wine and when we told the waiter we only had about an hour, he said to us in a most unprofessional way, \"you can't just have an appetizer!\"  We explained that some of us were having our own appetizers and my husband ordered a burger.  Now, the restaurant was practically empty so we weren't taking up space and we are good tippers!  The waiter came with our wine and poured it and we never saw him again until he brought the check.  Our bill for taking up 1 hour of their time was well over $100.  Needless to say, that waiter did not benefit from a particularly generous tip!"

            "review": "I am actually kind of shocked to see the rating of B&B Ristorante, but I do agree with some of the reviews in that I think what your expectations are before you go has a lot to do with what type of experience you are going to get. I have been here a few times before and I think it might come down what type of experience you are looking for.\n\nI had reservations this past weekend and I think along with the review for this day, it might help others to also compare it to my previous visit a few months earlier as both experiences were significantly different (but for me, equally enjoyable).\n\nOn my visit in Sept (my second time here), I ended up getting the pasta tasting menu. As noted by other the tasting menu is about 7 dishes. The tasting menu entailed the following at the time (attached a pic of the card they place there when you get the tasting menu):\n1) Garganelli Pomodoro with Paula's Basil - Yummy\n2) Black Spaghetti with Ricci di Mare - Super/Uber yummy! If you like spicy, you will love this!!! It is a completely different type of spicy!\n3) Ricotta Cavatelli with Canestrino Tomato, Flageolet and Ham Hock - Very good\n4) Jose's Pyramids with Purple Cherkoee \"Sugo Finto\" - Very good as well.\n5) Goose Liver Ravioli with Basamic Vinegar and Brown Sugar - Kinda of bitter from the Vinegar and sweet from the brown sugar. Might be an acquired taste for some but for me very good!\n6) Frutta Fresca - Not bad for a palate cleanser!\n7) Roasted Canestrin Tomato with Sweet Corn Gelato - the desert was awesome!\n\nIf you do try the tasting menu, definitely be prepared to spend at least 3-4 hours on this meal. If you cannot dedicate that much time to the meal, skip the pasta tasting menu and get individual dishes.\n\nI think the the reason why some like B&B is they are expecting the food to compete with excellent cut of beef, pork, or etc with some intricate sauce made by the masters from the mountains of Odo and forged from the blood, sweat and tears of the people of the land and then passed down from generation to generation on the backs by the grandmas of the world. FORGET IT! I hate to break it to you... but its pasta. You need to think about comparing apples to apples and oranges to oranges. The pasta tasting menu has to be some of the best tasting and prepared pasta I have ever had. all hand made that day and all very fresh! This place puts your standard concrete, flashy sign, chain restaurant in the suburbs to shame. If you are looking for flavor up the wazoo that you can compare to a steak house or other fine dining establishment, then read on and forget everything you just read.\n\nOn my most recent visit, we ended up going the appetizer, two \"main\" dishes (they call a \"primi\" and \"secondi\") and desert. A lot of the waiters recommend going this route if you aren't interested in the pasta tasting (others call it  prix fixe) menu. You get a wide variety of things (not just pasta) and you can choose food than interests you. For this recent visit, I ended up ordering:\n1) Calamari and Seppie Fritti - sorry Bobby Flay... in my opinion, Batali's Calamari tops yours easily. although others in my party might disagree with me.\n2) Gnocchi with Braised Oxtail - this is simply amazing. I have never tasted anything that good before!! Its got your \"pasta\" and your meat. Hook me up with this again!\n3) Duck with Baby Green Cabbage and Speck - Yummy!\n4) Desert (forget the name of it) - I ended up asking them to bring what they would recommend for desert.\n\nTo sum this all up, I think if you are looking to be WOW'ed and want compare it to other restaurants for the same type of money you are spending, you want to individual select items for your dining experience and get an appetizer, two \"main\" entries, and a desert. Going this route you can get a little more meat/seafood with your meal. Trust me you will enjoy it more. However, if you are looking for tasting simple (with few ingredients) yet unbelievably good and equally complex food, get the pasta tasting menu. Hopefully this will steer some people in the direction food that is better suited for yourself."

They also let you each get one and share - which is awesome!  Most restaurants won't let you split the table.  \n\nOur waiter Kevin was awesome and he did manage to upsell us to this option, but it was totally worth it.  We declined the wine pairings though, as they were very pricey.  Instead, they sell wine by the liter here, which is nice because you can try several or get some white and some read to spread out over the meal.  We really enjoyed it!  \n\nEach course was brought out and explained thorougly.  We are pretty adventurous eaters, but the calf's brain ravioli did give us a bit of pause.  However, it was awesome and did not taste bizarre in any way.  The tomato sauce was the best tomato I've ever tasted.  We thorougly enjoyed this meal and I cannot say enough about the service and taste of the food.  We would certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great dining experience."

We started with the garbanzo bruschetta and duck egg salad. Both were excellent.\nNext we had the goat cheese ravioli and sweet potato lune which were recommendations made by the hostess. These two pastas were my absolute favorite of the night. The filling was delicious and nothing beats homemade pasta. Then we had the king salmon and lambchops. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the lamb chops were so tasty. For dessert we had grapefruit sorbet. It was a nice finish to an excellent meal. I would recommend any of these dishes to anyone who tries this restaurant. Also we had a bottle of wine which we probably could've done without.\n\nThe service was excellent, they were very attentive. The ambience is nice, a little dark, more for an intimate dinner I suppose.\n\nYes it is a little pricey...but really you won't get food this good in an olive garden or maggianos.

One of the guys even asked for the recipe and our server had the cook write down the entire thing with instructions on a recipe card! I didn't personally try it - But my husband practically had a foodgasm over it.\n\nI had the beet salad and some sort of pasta dish. The pasta was average but I absolutely LOVED the beet salad. Mmmmm.\n\nThe service was extraordinary. Our server knew every little nuance of the menu and was extremely patient and friendly about all our questions. Also, the bartender was incredible at making drinks. He has a signiture drink called, \"The Green Monk.\" It MUST be tried. He also makes a killer mojito. Seems simple, but you'd be surprised!\n\nThe atmosphere was comfortable and classy. Everytime someone left the table for the restroom, a staff member would fold their napkin nicely. I enjoyed the little things.\n\nTo be honest, this is not the best place for a vegetarian. But it is still lovely and I would go again. I would give 3.5 stars if I could.. but since I have to choose, I will go with 4 because our server rocked it."

Similar to what another Yelp reviewer noted with their pasta dish, the pasta was UNDER cooked.  Believe me, we love a la dente pasta!   However, this was not al a dente, but simply undercooked.  When you bit in the pasta, there was still a hard, uncooked \"core.\"  It  needed a few more minutes of cooking time.  This was the only disappointment, in otherwise a terrific meal.   \n\nIf we are ever back in Las Vegas, we are sure to come back here!"

This was an enjoyable dish and pasta was cooked nicely.  The sauce was not as packed with flavor as I would have expected and overall it was a little salty.  I forgot to mention I started with mixed greens salad where I think every leaf of lettuce underwent an individual seasoning exercise.  The salad was nice and crunchy and fresh but again a little too salty.  My wife started with baby octopus which she said was cooked absolutely perfectly but was a little salty.  She then finished with linguine with clams which were very nice but also salty.\n\nI have to say fellow yelpers nailed this place when they said 80's rock and roll which was very inappropriate music was the norm and this place is very pricey and dishes are over-salted.  All in all I am still giving it a 4 even though it should be 3.5 because it was too salty and did not knock my socks off.

My  companions and I loved this place when it first opened and had returned because we thought the chefs involved would ensure its consistent quality.  On the evening of May 24th, we ordered the prix fixe pasta lamb menu.  \n\nThe first dish, I can only compare perhaps to ramen noodles. Really?  This is what  a top chef has created?  Next up, lamb brains ravioli.  The ravioli was tasteless and chewy and we could not find any discernible filling.  Where did those lamb brains go? \n\nThen we had penne w/ lamb pancetta.  Salty, tough lamb with overcooked pasta.   Next up, pasta w/lamb sausage.   I couldn't even finish the three bites they gave me.  I have eaten and enjoyed lamb my whole life.  Mario Batali committed  a crime against lamb and humanity with that dish.     \n\n Now on top of the major disappointment in the food, just imagine that you are waiting 20-25 minutes between courses.  When I spoke to the waitress about the course timing she was defensive and insisted that this is their standard procedure.\n\nOn top of a lousy meal now I have a waitress who wants to fight.  And believe me, I don't want to fight with a waitress.  I know what's at stake here.  This is an investment.    I really want this evening to work. So I told her all I want to do is try to salvage what is left of this $600 spaghetti evening, and one way to do that is to try get some food out here before the whole table falls asleep.  \n\nBy the time dessert arrived everyone at the table was numb.   Over two hours had passed since we sat down.   Oh, I think I found the missing ravioli lamb brains.  The lamb brains were between my ears for paying $600 for the worst tasting meal and the worst service in Las Vegas. \n\nWhat is promised to be one of the finest dining experiences in fact goes down as the worst dining experience ever.  \n\nApparently we weren't alone in that thought as the  table of Italian Americans sitting next to us were equally as unsatisfied it seems and ranted about all their pasta dishes. \n\nWhat a shame that these celebrity chefs like Mario Batali draw us in and leave without ensuring their product is worthy of the hype and cost.\n\nWe can assume the following.  Either Batali sucks as a chef. Or Batali has abandoned this restaurant and it just carries his name.  Either way, you are a chump for giving in to the hype of this place.  I'll never dine at a Batali restaurant again.\n\nI spoke to the manager before I left.  Don't think he gave a crap one way or the other.  He said he was sorry.  Me too.\n\nStay away from this joint.   I am not joking.  This is the worst."

The spiced cake was also a bit dry and lacking- nothing like a sticky toffee.\n\nOverall it just wasn't worth the price.  There was some inconsistency throughout dishes, which I'm sure would have been better if the fat man was there himself.  I think I'll try another place next time.  \n\nI guess it was that the tasting menu felt a bit thrown together.  A little more cohesion would have been nice."

It was outstanding, but I think it was $16/ person, so ended up being a bit pricy for a large group starter. I also really enjoyed the beef cheek ravioli which was nice and saucy. The pork belly was great, but a little too fatty for my taste.\n\nThe second time I really enjoyed the whole sea bass- it was market price, so I don't remember how much it was.\n\nThe third time was a complete miss. I got the short rib and it was tougher than short rib should be. The waitress also recommended the gnocchi as a side dish which just made the whole thing too heavy of a meal. The brussels sprouts were really awesome though. \n\nOverall, I had a good experience the first couple of times, but the last visit was very average."

We order the pre-fixed menu w/ lobster spaghetti , few appetizers and 2 black spaghetti. Appetizers is okay, but lobster spaghetti came undercooked that it's still hard and you can tasted the starch so we sent it back. They heated up for us without remaking the whole dish (microwaved???) Because it came back on the same plate and left over food size (me and 2 others all took a bite) and the spaghetti is still a little undercooked.\n\nBlack spaghetti is soooooo salty and over spiced (it is not because its spicy because we can both eat really spicy food) which my friend and I both can't even take a 2nd bite even we told them to make everything with less salt. We don't even want to send it back since we already sent back the uncooked lobster spaghetti. So we kind of just left 3 plates of spaghetti there and asked for check.\n\nTheir service is really good but so sad the food is not as good as before. Will not go back again...."

            "review": "I was very much looking forward to dining at B&B Ristorante, and I am sorry to say that I was quite disappointed.   Our appetizers were decent (grilled octopus and baby artichoke salad), but our entrees were extremely disappointing.  My husband's brasato was dry and stringy; it had almost no sauce at all.  My Texas red fish and roasted cauliflower  were so salty that they were inedible (and trust me, I love salt).  I sent back the fish dish, and the waitress returned to confirm that the chef had tasted it and agreed that it was \"way overseasoned.\"  No apology -- just informed me that another one would be made and brought out.  That did, in fact, happen, and it was much better, but my husband had finished eating before my entree arrived, so I just ate a few bites.  \n\nThe decor is quite nice, but there are few things that are \"off.\"  The restaurant is dark, intimate, and cozy, but one side of the room is open to a hallway in the Venetian.  I could understand if it were a cool view, but it's not.  So, one person gets a nice view of the restaurant, and the other person gets a view of the harshly lit hallway.  The other incongruity is the music.  It is apparently music from Mario's iPod, including Beastie Boys, etc.  -- not exactly romantic Italian restaurant music.  I'm sure it's supposed to be cool that it's Mario's favorite music, but I found it distracting and out of place.  I actually like a lot of the music, but it would be more appropriate in a different venue.\n\nService was adequate.  The sommelier was good.  Our waitress was OK.  She forgot to tell us about the day's specials, and we didn't think to ask.  We later heard her reciting the specials to the people at the next table over.  And, again, I really felt that she should have handled the inedible entree issue more graciously.\n\nOverall, I expected way better from this restaurant.  We had an absolutely wonderful meal two nights earlier at Bouchon, and they were approximately the same price."

            "review": "Huge disappointment. My husband's uncle treated us and my husband's parents here the night before our wedding. It was our first time to Las Vegas and we were so excited since we love Mario. We opted for the classic tasting menu to get the true experience. The first and second courses were great, but then it went downhill from there. Instead of each course building upon one another, it was as if the flavors were overpowering each other. This menu would have been better if it wasn't pasta after pasta after pasta. There was so much more that could have been done. For example, start with a single meatball, Then move onto a caprese salad for course two and build from there. The courses were too heavy. The beef in the pyramids of the third course was dry. The foie gras and truffles were both strong flavors competing with to beef cheek ravioli to be the star of the fourth course. The balsamic reduction on the foie gras ravioli was too much for us as well. Had the reduction been drizzled on the plate instead of my ravioli dunked in the sauce with more sauce poured on top, it may have been tasty. If that course was what made Mario Batali famous, he would be very disappointed on the execution of it. The best course was dessert and even that was nothing to brag about. Kudos to the chef for layering 1600 sheets of dough, but my pastry was too hard. The raspberry sauce was great and the pastry filling was silky. The last course we were served was a souffl\u00e9 of sorts. Mine was not cooked in the middle. If I had turned it upside down it would have ran onto the plate like soup.  The experience I had here almost made me cancel other reservations at a different celebrity chef restaurant. Thank goodness I didn't because the other restaurant was perfection. All in all the service here was great, but the chef needs to go back to culinary school. Do not waste your money here unless you choose to try something other than the tasting menu."

The grilled octopus was very good and probably the highlight.  The bread was ok, the waiter explained it aas being twice baked.  They offer you ciabatta and lard as a special appetizer you can buy, but last time I was in town you could that at Carne Vino for free.\n\nBeef cheek ravioli was ok but a bit heavy and honestly could have been stuffed with anything because there wasn't really a lot of filling to be able to tell what it was.  I got the seared duck breast with the cherry and wine reduction.  The duck wasn't anything special.  There was no crisp to the sear, it was all pretty soggy and HEAVY on the salt.  A co-diner had the veal which he said was really salty.  They did offer to bring something else which was nice but we opted for a comped side of unseasoned veggies to help ease the saltiness.\n\nI didn't have dessert but did have an americano.  Italian espresso is the way to go.  Others got the gelatto something else I can't remember.  They did bring out some little house made cookies/candies which I thought was nice.\n\nThe service was top notch but that's expected.  For the overall experience thought I'd go 2.5 stars but rounding up to 3 wouldn't feel right."

The waiter was amazing and very knowledgeable and helpful.  The salad, goodness when that arrived I was hoping it would be worth the price, my friend and I split the entire dinner and desert.  The greens were so fresh I complimented to the waiter and he explained to me that Mr Mario Batili is so particular on his greens and was dissatisfied what he was receiving that now he grows his own right in Vegas and sells off the \"rejects\" to other local restaurants.  This keeping many employed and I am telling you it was the best salad I ever ate.   \nPricy yes but if you want perfect ambiance and fabulous food and service, this is the place to go.  \n\nThank You!"

Calamari was ok but no sauce and large portion, while the aged meats plate was decent. \n\nThen ordered the lobster pasta and the sweet sausage pasta. The lobster pasta had very little sauce and when asked for more sauce we were denied by the chef, also not allowed to have drawn butter apparently! Not worth 32 dollars and was not offered parmesan or crushed red peppers! The sweet sausage pasta was good though, again no condiments allowed. \n\nOur final course was the veal which was expensive and ver marbelized, to the point of being work to find the meat, but the parts that were edible were very good! \n\n Oh by the way, be ready to order all of your courses at the same time bc that's the rules.\n\n Waiter also ignored shawna even though it wad my b day dinner and she picked up the bill, which was way overpriced; and also was charged for our comped desert which was awarded to us bc of poor service. Desert wad bland chocolate w berries, coffee was also lame. \n\nAVOID THIS PLACE bc there are so many other great places that will treat you right and also serve amazing food for less than what we spent. Waste of money, time, and food. Poor form Mario Batali.....\n\nBest part about Batali is on iron chef, booya!\n\n\n(go to La Cirque or Mon Ami Gabi, they are worth it!)"

It failed on many levels.....the food being the biggest failure!    It was so frustrating to receive one sub-par dish after another. We had failures that ran the gamut... burnt items, flavorless items, under-seasoned items...and so on.   Even more frustrating was the diminished level of service. Here is my honest opinion...because I want YOU to have a great meal in Vegas.... don't choose B&B. Mario is my favorite chef, but he doesn't run this restaurant. I'm sure if he lived in LV this place would deliver at a much higher level.   We did the tasting menu.  It was not very good.   Food = 2 stars.  Service = 1 star.  Ambiance = 1 star.   Overall = 1 star."

Our meal was pretty dazzling.\n\nWe picked this restaurant (they have 3 in this location) for it's more adventurous and unique menu.  We were not disappointed. In fact, I was sent into full-on crave mode, and the next day we lunched at Canaletto. Pasta, just please give me more of his pasta. I went from virgin to addict overnight. \n\nAnyhoo, the order - house made salumi, prosciutto with perfect pears and charred bread (both mouthwatering), green salad (basic but lovely - get it to achieve balance), pasta bolognese and pasta with lobster (both outstanding). Top quality ingredients, simply done and perfectly cooked.  The amuse of chick pea bruschetta rocked. It was a toss up whether to get dessert or cheese - and the ricotta and fruit dessert fulfilled both desires in a well portioned, not over sweet way.  \n\nThe room is dark yet open, masculine and shiny - with walls and walls of glass doored wine displays. Flowers and rustic wood touches warm it nicely.  \n\nService was top notch - how often do you actually want to converse at length with the staff? They were incredibly knowledgeable, and both the waiter and female sommelier could have joined us for dinner and we would have been perfectly happy.\n\nI'll have to go back the next time I'm in town."
