I had fried okra as my side and it was pretty greasy - nothing spectacular.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to stop by here again, but it's worth giving a shot."

            "review": "If review was based on taste alone - 5 stars\n\nBut they lose a star for no indoor seating and for the staff being kind of blah. By kind of blah I mean they weren't necessarily bad but they weren't great either. I understand its a small place to not have indoor seating but if you are going to only have outdoor seating you need to have a drive-thru too in my opinion. I went on a pretty chilly day and had to stand outside to wait for my cheesesteak. Worth the wait for sure but they would probably do more business if you could sit or even order indoors. I don't know about you but I don't exactly enjoy standing outside when its 30 degrees in winter or 120 in summer. And when its windy and you are trying to eat outside everything is blowing all over the place. They aren't something you really want to eat in your car either (can be messy). \n\nThe Philly Steaks are by far the closest I have had to Philly out here. I'm from the Northeast and these are pretty close if not right on the money (its been a while since I've been to Philly). \n\nOverall - looking forward to my next visit but I will make sure its a nice day out."

I got the cheese whiz fries with a cheesesteak with onions,mushrooms, peppers and cheese whiz. The cheese whiz fries were so yummy the cheese steak eh it was ok. I was hoping to taste the best cheesesteak ever, but unfortunately it didn't happen tonight. The cheesesteak was good sized and it was filled up it just lacked flavor. The meat was bland and the hoagie was salty and stale. I'm not sure if it was fresh being as it took less than 5 mins for the guy to call my name. Anywho I'm saddened it wasn't an amazing cheese steak as I was really craving one, but hey at least I tried this place once."

Meat was cooked just right that it wasn't chewy and first time ever trying Cheese Wiz on a Philly.  The cheese wiz was actually one hell of a good idea, tasted really good with the sandwich and different from what I expected if I would have just chosen the common cheeses such as provolone.\n\nThe only difference from what my friend told me that would have made this equal to Pat's or Ginos was the bun used.  The bun in Pops was not that great in my opinion as well.  I have never tasted Ginos nor Pats so I can only go by from what he says.\n\nI do recommend this place however. Still the best Philly u can get in Vegas from what others I have tried so far.  Next time I'm going to try their breakfast sandwich.\n\n.....I have never said Philly this much in my whole entire life."

The bread is authentic philly cheese steak bread! the chew on the bread is perfect, and with all the meat, cheese and veggies it's able to hold all the yummie ingredients and not get soggy. The meat is tender and seasoned perfect, the green peppers, onions and mushrooms are sauteed to perfection and and so full of that steak flavor. The best way to get a philly is to get the WIZ! they put the perfect balance of meat, cheese and veggies, i really have no bad things to say about the place, i have been here many times and have never been disappointed in my selections, they are consistant in their food and the customer service is great."

Now no east coast guy so have no basis just local boy from the islands. I do know is lot of east coast peeps one was visiting from the islands. Always told me the key is cheese whiz if its  not very good then just not real deal philly. It been years since I came here just cause out of the way from my house. Years go by but somethings never change. Yay!!\n\nI had the works with mushrooms. onions, and without question get me some cheese whiz. The meat perfect thinly sliced, cooked perfect, moist, hot, and top it with saute mushrooms/onions. The icing on the cake or this case philly. Cheese whiz. Hot! Cheesy, and enough whiz that it never ending cheese whiz down till your last bite. Not only last bite but know good cheese whiz all over your hands. The bread has nice crust on the outside, moist, and fresh baked bread feel. Put it all together nothing better too soak up long night of drinking at 3am Vegas style. Reasonable price for late night or anytime grubbing. Philly true Philly no room for sides. They have lot of different sides too choose from and not only steak can choose too make Philly. Really is there any other way then steak?? Think not.\n\nThe atmosphere without doubt not only adds so much too Pops with no true seating just open patio area and ideal place too hang out talk stories with friends. It open late at night. It perfect spot after long night drinking, hang out open area one that no need worry about shout over people have conversation with friends, and bonus get best Philly desert every seen!!!!"

I had the Philly with cheez whiz, mushrooms and onions. The roll was soft and fresh, the steak was sliced thin and very tender, the sauteed mushrooms and onions buried under all that cheese! It had all the flavors coming together in that first bite to make me raise an eyebrow. I would recommend this to everyone who loves a good Philly cheese steak."

Looking for another place to hit up after work for some late night grubbin I was feeling for a cheesesteak sandwich. I ordered a Mushroom, pepper, and provalone cheesesteak. It was very delicious and the topping were piled high almost falling out of the hoagie roll. Open 24/7 it works with my work schedule very well. A little pricey compared to some places but it makes up for it in a packed sandwich."

POPS is open 24 hours and the sandwiches and sides here are just so yummy!!!!\n\nThe sandwiches are made to order, and are great! I usually get the chili fries or deep fried okra as a side to go with my sandwich. \n\nIt's an outdoor walk-up orders type kind of place. Open outdoor seating. It's in a convenient location near Meadows Mall, right on Decatur. Easy to drive pass this place, but I'm sure you won't miss the huge POPS writing on the roof! \n\nParking lot is small, but there always a spot you can get since they are super fast with getting orders made. \n\nDon't worry for those who are not really into philly cheese steak sandwiches, they have salads and chicken and other options as well. So there's always something that everyone can order. \n\nThis is a place that i highly recommend!!! Well worth your $10-15!"

I ate a full cheese steak, an entire order of fried mushrooms, and then half an order of their fried banana bites (oh man, how I dream of those golden mouthfuls of deliciousness). Everything was absolutely killer, so much so that despite being stuffed, I was tempted to go back for another sandwich, you know, \"for later.\" I was in love.\n\nOne housebound night several weeks later, I was hit with a cheese steak craving. I ordered in from the highest rated delivery place I could find and was promptly let down.  Don't get me wrong, it was okay, but nothing more. Since then I've tried half a dozen sandwiches from as many restaurants and as it turns out, I don't crave cheese steaks; I crave Pop's. They set the bar high and ruined me for other places.\n\nBeyond the food quality, the atmosphere is great. Open outdoor seating makes a great place to bring a casual date or good friends. It's fun and comfortable, with great service.\n\nThe only negative I can think of is that once a line forms, it doesn't let up. But I can't fault the place for doing good business. If anything, it's a testament to just how good Pop's is."

The cheese whiz is really cheesy and good, but a bit too salty for me, 6/10. It can get messy because of the cheese. \nCheese whiz fries were bomb dot com!! 10/10\n\nAfter paying, if you like hot sauce, make sure to ask the cashier for hot sauce because that stuff is amazing. I have a feeling it could be a hot sauce from a bottled sauce we know, but cant pinpoint which one. Either way, taste great in the cheesesteak & with the fries! \n:-)"

Both times we went and ordered our food they screwed up our sandwiches. Mine was a philly with mushrooms and peppers. NO ONION.  I went up and told them there was a mistake so being that it was 11pm and pretty cold. My boyfriend was eating his food and I had to watch.  Okay well he tells me it was really flavorless.  How do you kill the flavor of the meat?   I had to completely agree when my order was ready 7 minutes later... I went for a bite and expected there to be gooey cheese on it and SOME seasoning. Nope.  It was so bland I couldn't eat the rest of it and decided the second try was the  LAST TRY.  I don't get it, we came at all the way out from our side of town to try it.  We even went as late like everybody's recommended. Still awful service. Not to mention the two guys working were miserable.\n\nI rather spend the money and go to Green Valley's Buffet and have them make me a Philly COOK TO ORDER.  At least there the meat was juicy, flavorful and I could SEE what the hell they're up to in the kitchen."

I can see why the reviews are so mixed. The flavors of the sandwich is delicious, but does it warrant the price? Yes and no. \n\nThe pros: The bread is soft and spongy with a toothy bite to it. The filling is cooked on a well seasoned griddle which picks up more flavor as the day goes on. The Cheese Whiz is plentiful. The fried zucchini were some of the best I have had. They are not freshly made, but the batter holds firm. \n\nThe cons: The meat and fixings was on the skimpy side. Some of the sides are worth the $3.95, but items such as the pretzel costing that much is ridiculous. Especially since they are so cheap to produce. \n\nOne item I am tempted to go back for is their breakfast philly. From 7am-10am, or something close to that, they run a special where it is only $5.

My bacon philly and a bottle of water came out to twelve bucks; for the price I expected more. The philly was surprisingly dry and lacking flavor. Normally adding bacon to any dish is an improvement but here it just added a rubbery textured ingredient to otherwise soft sandwich.

When you receive your food, it's warm and ready to be devoured. Another great aspect of this place is the amount of meat that you get for the price. The Philly steak's is between $6-10 and I believe is properly priced. Another positive aspect is that this place is 24hrs. After a long night at Vegas and there is a need for cheap grub, this is a good place to check out.\n\nNow for the things I didn't like about this place. For one thing, I enjoy my Philly steaks with a little kick of hot sauce. There is a small charge for hot sauce. Yeah I know $.50 is not expensive, but come on now, a charge for hot sauce. Secondly, side orders are extra. Who gets Philly steaks without fries or something? These negative is very minor, bit it did disturb me a little bit.\n\nOverall, I would rate this place a 3 1/2 star but because I don't have that option it gets 4 stars.

I swear i couldnt choke that stringy clumpy meat and stale bread down. I ordered an Italian hoagie to go also, just took a look at it and I saw sliced pickle on it.Im keeping my expectations low.

Jimmy on south street ...Tony lukes.... so I know a thing or two about a good cheesesteak. First of all you have to have good bread and pops gets there bread flown in from Philadelphia Amoroso bakery in Philly is the best bread around that area.. pops uses the best bread in town. The meat on a scale of 1 to 10 is a 6.\n.they don't use fresh rib eye meat. They give a generous portion. They could put more cheese on there steak sandwiches... All in all its a decent philly chesesteak.  The grill isn't to clean and I often worry about how long the meat is kept warm in that pan...they cook the meat in advance and it lays in a pan of hot water for who knows how long. The employees are friendly. One time they forgot to give me my receit and according to there sign that posted right by the window where u pay 4 your food if they don't give u your receit you get your food for free... What I told the person at the cast hurts if they forgot to give me my receipt at first he tried to give me the receipt but i said said no its too late so he had to give me a free sandwich he wasn't too happy....."

My sweet friend Sergio I noticed often has a very large appetite on the nights we hang out. Pop's is close to his house so it makes a stop very convenient late at night since they are always open.\n\nThe staff is friendly and they make good solid food so this review will be sweet and simple. I have had a variety of their cheesesteaks in the past and they have always been good with quality ingredients. I must say that I really enjoy their sweet potato fries that come with a yummy coconut dipping sauce. Their regular French fries are great as well and are fresh cut.\n\nService is great, food is great and they are open 24/7. My only tip to you is that this is not a place to come to if you are low on cash, you better save those coins for the dollar menu somewhere else if you are on a budget! lol\n\nTake out is your best option as it is a free standing store with a few patio chairs and tables to sit at outside. It is on a busy street so it may not be as comfortable relaxing to eat with cars whizzing by plus the crazy wind.\n\nCheck Pop's Philly Steaks out!"

Heck, I even hit it up on Christmas Day night after being over the whole turkey and ham thing.  24/7, they never close.

So, that may have been the past, but it's not true now. This was also at 10 PM on a Sunday night. The roll was soft, the meat was juicy and tender, and the whiz, the whiz was the whiz.

Fat and stringy beef, just like the ones in the East Coast when I was a child. When you chew your bites, the meat sort of falls apart and melts in your mouth. I have spent years trying to find the \"right cheesesteak\" in Nevada and California for ages. \n\nThe problem I noticed when it comes to ordering a cheesesteak in any place is not Philidelphia is that the establishment can't get the ingredients right. They usually love to bastardize the recipe with their \"lean, organic, and fat free\" ingredients that fuck up every aspect of the experience, the taste, texture, and even the look. I couldn't believe how many people can bungle a SIMPLE recipe of melt-in-your-mouth CHEESE... and steak. \n\nA proper cheesesteak is a sloppy and messy one. Sort of like a Sloppy Joe, but cheesy. Its where the wrapping paper still has bits of that \"cheese paper\" still encrusted and stuck to the sides after you are done and you feel like you want to lick it off your fingers and the trash. Cheesesteaks should have a pungent, cheesy, and greasy odor that alerts the entire block within the vicinity of your possession of a good cheesesteak. \n\nAnd many restaurants couldn't even get the basic concept of it right. I was about to give up in frustration until I looked online and found this place on Yelp. My first impression was, \"You guys are full of shit\", but I had extra money on me so I ordered a classic cheesesteak with fried okra. \n\nAfter the first bite, I went into a epileptic seizure where I relived my best moments as a 6 year old, experiencing authentic Philly Cheesesteak for the first time as a kid. From what I was told by the hospital staff, the cooks found me lying on the sidewalk with yellow cheesy saliva foaming on the edges of my mouth, and paramedics picked me up to drop me off at Sunrise Hospital. \n\nMy diabetic stroke was worth it!"

I've tried a couple and have loved them all.  My faves are the 3 cheese steak and the Mushroom and cheese steak.  Delish!\n\n2. Choices on top of choices! Steak or chicken, then 3 types of cheese, add in all sorts of veggies, and you have a lot of variety. You never get tired of the menu. \n\n3. They have Tastykakes!\n\n4. Lots of tasty sides like Cheez Whiz fries, Fried green beans, chips, etc.  Gotta love the sides.\n\n5. The grill man.  I've been lots of times and it always seems the same guy is working. He is super friendly and knows how to cook.  He's just cool and deserves his own line. \n\nPop's has been on this corner for as long as I remember.  The food is consistently good, the staff is friendly, and you will always leave with a full belly.  What could be better than that?!?!"

So this review is for you transplants who may want to consider eating here. \n\nIf you grew up in or around philly (im from lower bucks), you know how a cheesesteaks supposed to be made. \nThe guys are supposed to take your order,  grill up the meat, grill the onions& peppers alongside the meat, add the cheese and hash it all together with a spatula. Then its supposed to be served on a foot long (aka 18\") hoagie roll. \n\nPops did it a bit differently. The meat & veggies were precooked and sitting to the side of the grill. The cook took a scoop of each and put them on the grill, stirred them up a bit, and added my cheese. Then he took a roll, opened it and put it on top, scooping it up so that the cheese was only on the bottom of the roll. \n\nThe taste was still pretty authentic, but i wish id gotten mine fresh. \n\nThe \"restaurant\" itself was similar in feel to an old-time drive in restaurant, except it did have a covered patio with 6 or 7 tables. Very dive-y. I liked it. \n\nIn conclusion, this was a perfect spot for a post-drive in movie date (10 minutes away on rancho), fun, and a decent cheesesteak, at least for vegas. \n\nIll be back for sure. A solid 4 stars."

I love how it's 24/7 and the staffers are friendly. I usually get a #4, #6, #34 and I have yet to try # 32. If you want an awesomely tasting cheese steak but without the added sodium (salt) then I would highly recommend POP's.\n\nSometimes I get the Chilli Cheese fries with pastrami which is also good but can make you kinda heavy.\n\nSome say the cheese steak is bland but that's because there isn't as much salt like other places which can really alter the flavor/taste of the cheesesteak., so if your lookin out to have more foods with less salt then I recommend this place.\n\nI don't think the drive through actually works to get your order, I mean I went to POP's like 33 times and it doesn't look like they actually take orders in the drive through, if they did, i'd probably give POP's another star."

I would avoid the sides though, not only are they prepackaged items like zucchini sticks, mozzerella sticks, mushrooms, etc, but they are all fried in the same oil.

The provolone cheese melts to a gooey goodness and covers every bit. The Amoroso bread is wonderful. It has a sturdy crust on the outside, light and airy on the inside.

Be conscious that its is all outdoors so keep weather in mind, but absolutely worth it. Yeah, its pricey but the flavors are more than enough to satisfy that craving.They make the food right in front of you and they do it quickly. Their menu expands past  Philly cheese steaks and fries, I really love their Italian sub its phenomenal!!!!! And dont forget to order the sweet potato fries, they are served with an apple cinamon sauce that makes them over the top!"

            "review": "Some background: I have lived in and around Philly for 29 years, and just moved to Las Vegas in July. I used to live down Passyunk from Pat's and Geno's, and for the last 4 years I lived near the Dalessandro's (the real king of Philly steaks). Soooo I think I am fairly qualified to give this review.\n\nAfter finding out that Pop's was a short drive from my office, I decided to head down there to devour thousands of delicious calories in one sitting. I wish I saved those calories for something better. What a disappointment!! \n\nI asked for my go-to, a cheesesteak hoagie (typically it's steak, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion). He told me mayo was included, and I told him no mayo please. After waiting 5 minutes for my steak, I get it in a paper bowl thing with a fork stuck on top. Never saw that before... Sat down, pulled apart my steak to put ketchup in there, and I realized the thing is slathered in mayo. NASTY. Brought my steak back to the counter, told the woman at the register about the mistake, and they made me another. I had to get this to go since I needed to be back at work. Back at my office, I take a bite of my steak and there is some kind of vinegar flavoring in the hoagie. I don't know if the onions were cooked in it or if the guy thought this would be good or if was just suffering from temporary insanity.... Ugh. I ate it, but only because I paid $14 with a drink and chips. \n\nFirst, the prices were a little much for what you're getting. My cheesesteak hoagie was $10. I used to pay $8 at Dalessandro's. It's $6.50 at Dalessandro's for a plain steak and it's $8 at Pop's. The quality was a 2 star compared to Dalessandro's 5 star, so confused on the mark up of price. Maybe because the rolls are shipped from Amaroso's? \n\nIf you've never had a Philly steak, I can see why you might like these. If you have experienced the best of the best, you will walk away disappointed. Between the price, flavor, and authenticity, I won't be returning."

Another five or so minutes passed then the woman next to me apologized for them taking her before me and even asked if I could just get an Italian Ice to which the guy at the grill gave an annoyed look and said the other guy would get it. I waited another 5 minutes of nothing with no line besides the woman who was orginally behind me before deciding to just leave.

Well, all this anticipation contributed to the big let down.  \n\nI love anything authentic.  And supposedly all of the ingredients (rolls, cheese, meat) are flown in directly from Philly itself. I ordered the provolone mushroom cheesesteak, and it was just OK.  Maybe I needed to order the cheese whiz to make it more authentic, but I just can't bring myself to eat something that artificially bright yellow. \n\nThe roll was definitely piled high with the tender meat.  I only ate half because it was so filling.  But it wasn't as seasoned or flavorful as I was expecting it to be.  The mushrooms added some flavor, but that was it.  Perhaps I am just not a phillycheesesteak type of girl. \n\nThere were 2 people ahead of me in line, so there was a bit of a wait. I am just grateful I went in the spring and not in the middle of summer.  I doubt i will have any cheesesteak cravings any time soon, but it is comforting to know that if I do have one, they are open 24 hours.\n\n*Yelp 100 Challenge: Review 26/100*"

I absolutely love their sandwiches and never really had bad service or a complaint for that matter.\n\nI was craving a Philly Cheese Steak last night, but couldn't get one until my check hit. So I really really really wanted a Philly Cheese Steak tonight. \n\nIt was a bit chilly out and there was a couple on the side, I was told they already ordered. So I placed my order a #32 and a #6 both with bacon. The previous two times prior they were pretty sparse with the meat and bacon compared to what I'm used to, I figured it was just the Grill Master. This time was no different, he put a lot of onions for one sandwich and barely any for the other, I didn't say anything because I don't like to complain. He made my sandwiches, then cut them wrapped them and put them aside. I figured he was waiting for the cashier to come ring me up, so I patiently waited. He began assisting the couple that had already ordered. (It appeared they were waiting for wings) I figured it would be just a minute or two and I would get my food, however that was not the case. I ended up waiting for over 7 minutes, the couples card declined 3 times. I decided I wasn't going to pay $25+ for two cold sandwiches that have been sitting there for about 10 minutes. \n\nMoney is tight so I haven't been able to indulge as much as I would like and I was really looking forward to a Hot Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. I think the employees really dropped the ball this time. If I'm paying around $12 a sandwich I want it hot. If you're helping someone else, that's fine I'll wait. I want my food hot off the grill.\n\nI want the old Grill Master back. The Philly was stuffed to the rim and there was bacon in every bite. I never once got cold food."

There are many more places to get a great cheese steak in the valley, and unless I'm in the area, I don't see a need to come back here.\n\nI got the Bacon and Swiss Cheese steak.  Everything should be better with bacon, right?  Not in this case, the bacon didn't add much flavor, and the swiss was definitely a mistake.  A good cheese steak always comes with whiz.  Provolone is acceptable but if you really want the flavor, the whiz is where it's at.  The steak itself was sliced perfectly and was melt in your mouth, except it lacked a flavor.  The sandwiches were nice sized for what you pay, but overall for someone who is just a Philly Steak place, it was a bit of a letdown.  \n\nThey have a lot of sides, and I can't comment on their flavors.  If you find yourself in the northern part of the west side, this place will more than meet your need for cheese steak at all hours of the night.\n\nThey do have a nice seating area, and they have misters for the heat."

I was looking forward to trying Pops, as many people have said they're the most authentic in the city.\n\nWell, they tried too, but unfortunately, it wasn't the experience I'm used to from Philly. The meat wasn't browned enough. The roll was somehow too soft, which is weird because they use the same Amoroso rolls that are used in Philly. And then the whiz.... they poured it on top of the meat. Travesty, I tell you. In Philly, they mix it in with the meat so that you have an equal bite of cheese to meat. I honestly didn't think it'd make much of a difference, but i had a ton of cheese in the bites I took from the top of the sandwich, and no cheese on the bottom of the sandwich. \n\nThey did have tastykakes though. That made me pretty happy. I also like how they're open 24 hours a day. I'll have to try one of their breakfast hoagies (incorrectly named by Pops as \"Breakfast Phillys\".... honestly, if you go into a sandwich shop in philly and ask for anything called  \"philly\", they will not know what you're talking about).\n\nSo why the three star review if I was dissatisfied? Well, I hate giving low reviews to perfectly good businesses. I'm sure what I ate was a great sandwich. For people from Vegas who want a good cheesesteak, this is a great option. For people from Philly who've had the real deal however, you may be a little disappointed that it doesn't taste like it's from back home."

And of course, middle of the night dining options are always good. However, the phillys aren't quite as tasty as their predecessor's. It seems like maybe they really love oregano. A lot. Like, really a lot. That appears to be the main flavoring that they use to distinguish themselves from other philly joints. Chicken phillys are better, not so over seasoned. I really want to love the cheese fries, but at least when I go there in the evenings the old, old fries are just thrown back in the fryer for you. Now I know that some places double-fry their fries. However, if you double-fry really old fries, you just get nasty over cooked & over greased fries. It's a consistent thing here. Perhaps during the daytime I'd have better luck w/ the fries. \nAlso, I've witnessed several times where people will go from money handling to directly touching food. Not a cool thing. Soo, yeah.

It's the only cheese steak establishment I've ever seen in sin city so I thought I'd give it a try and I'm sure glad I did.\n\nIt's just a really good cheese steak.  That's all there is to it.  The bread is soft but not too soft.  The steak is cooked just like it would be in Philly and the toppings are plentiful and tasty.  There's also many different variations to choose from like the cheese, peppers, onions, and what kind of sauces you want on it.  I always go steak 'wit' provolone, peppers and onions.  Writing this review right now makes me want one.  I guess I'll have to settle for Philly's Best tonight, but that's another review."

Three distinct flavors that should all be tasted in a good philly, and everything tasted like the meat juice. I asked for American cheese and I think I was given provolone, on account that it was especially stringy for whatever reason. There was so much bread in comparison to the meat, onion, and mushrooms that was in the sandwich. \n\nThe frier was broke or being cleaned, so I couldn't get any fries or other side items to go with my sandwich.\n\nI always hear positive praise for this place, but for all the years I have occasionally bought food here, I have yet to have a good meal here that would make me understand the hype."

They are also open 24 hours.  \n\nPlenty of cheese steaks on the menu, made a variety of ways.  We tried the cheese whiz steak, provolone, american, the hoagie, 3 cheese and chili, the chicken steak, and the bbq pork grinder.  \n\nI personally liked the bbq pork grinder the most.  The bbq sauce was addicting.  Then the 3 cheese and chili cheese steak since it had so much flavor.  About 10 dollars per cheese steak so not the cheapest you can find but definitely worth the trip out here and cost."

I was there one day when the UPS guy showed up with the boxes of rolls from Amaroso's Bakery in Philadelphia.  My complaints are no indoor seating, which is a problem during the miserable Las Vegas Summers.  From May to September, you basically have to get it to go.  And it's not as good unless it's hot and fresh.  The person taking the order doesn't always get it right. Double check your orders before you leave.  And it is very pricey.  You'll pay over $15 for a sandwich, fries, and a drink.  But I guess you pay extra for the Philly imported ingredients.  The taste is good though and it is the best cheesesteak I've had outside of Philly.  I do like the fact that they are 24/7/365!"

So flavorful and make you want to come back for more. They're kinda pricy for what they are (4+$ for fries) but they make the meal. It's worth your time for a quick philly grab. \n\nPS: no indoor seating, there's a roof cover but if it's cold, you'll freeze and if it's extremely hot, you'll roast."

Maybe we just went on a bad day I don't know, I would try it one more time but as of right now I was not impressed. They do not offer any sort of kid friendly menu such as hotdogs or something like that that was a downside for us as well.\n\nUPDATE:  after reading a message from someone at this establishment who was unhappy with my review, I likely WON'T give it a second try. Seriously, for you to say your demographic isn't children which is why you don't serve any kid friendly food is ridiculous! You are not a bar or a club, if you were I'd totally understand and would not have even mentioned lack of kids menu. This is a freakin sub shop... and FYI there are tons of families in the area and having a few simple items on the menu MIGHT boost your business!  Funny I saw high chairs at your restaurant ... WHY? you don't serve kid friendly food! Oh well.  Lesson learned."

What I really got was a grill master who was just gruff and apparently couldn't hear my order, because when I got my cheese steak home, there were no onions on it at all!   \n\nOk, the cheese steak itself:  the meat was not fatty or greasy, but slightly bland.  I enjoyed the cheese whiz and the bread was very good.  I think if they had included the onions, things would have been tastier.  Also, in the hours since eating the steak, I have been a bit 'indisposed', but this in and of itself has never been an index of whether I would return to a place if the food tastes good.

I can now come here whenever I want for some steak!\n\nI probably would have given a 4 star if I had just stuck with their mantra...any of their famous steak sandwiches.  Possibly some fries.  We kinda did a detour by ordering things you wouldn't ordinarily get at a Philly cheese steak place so that took it down a notch.\n\nCame here on a late night (probably the best times for one of these) and wouldn't you know, Pop's was hoppin'.  Parking lot was full!  We had no problem waiting in line though, goes pretty quick.  Wifey and I ordered:\n\n*#4 - Provolone Cheese Steak ($9.99)\n*#35 - Pork Bar-B-Que ($9.99)\n*Fried Okra ($3.95)\n\nBut of course, best thing we had was the Provolone Cheese Steak!  Roll was light but still fresh tasting, there was a lot of meat & cheese in this sucker!  Oiliness galore!  Just like it probably should be.  Fat = FLAVOR!  Meat was seasoned well and was the focus of the sandwich.  Basically meat, cheese, bread.  Pretty damn delicious cheese steak.\n\nTook away a star though for the rest of our order.  The Pork Bar-B-Que sandwich they said is an award winner but I just didn't like it that much.  The pork was overly stringy, but the sauce?  It was wayyyyy too sweet!  Like almost sickly sweet!  I was looking for more tang or bite to the sauce.  But the sweet was just too overpowering.  Really not on my want list.\n\nThe fried okra was OK, it was just really fried okra.  A little bland but fried fresh, could have used a bit more seasoning.  Plus it didn't really go well with our sandwiches so it was kind of forgettable.\n\nPrices are fairly reasonable, but man paying nearly $10 for a sandwich gets to me for some reason - I guess it's because we have so much cheap food in town.  I mean come on, I can go downtown to get a prime rib dinner with sides, salad bar & dessert for the same price!  But thankfully Pop's cheese steak is tasty.\n\nI'll be a regular at Pop's especially during my lunch days at work.  But I'll just go for a steak sandwich from now on!\n\n#sweetmeat"

Not here.  Being a native Pennsylvanian and growing up on REAL Philly Cheesesteaks, this was a big disappointment.  Meat was not cooked to order on the grill, instead, probably cooked the night before( or worse) , put in a big pot and then simply re-heated on the grill when orders placed.  This process allows meat to sit in its own juice making the bread extra soggy.  So soggy that you can't pick up the sandwich with your hands.  He gives you a fork to eat it.  WHAT??  The meat had absolutely no flavor, very bland and chewy.  There is a reason that people stand in line in Philly to get a real sandwich and they don't mind the long wait because they know it will be the real deal.  Pulling meat out of a pot is not acceptable to call yourself a Philly Cheesesteak.  For all those leaving good reviews, well, I guess if you haven't had a real one, you just don't know any better."

But the sweet potatoe fries were soggy and mostly just batter (might be the way they wrapped a paper around it, and steam was trapped).\n\nGreat for the phillys, not so much on the fries, and a downer for me to not have indoor air conditioned seating (we are in the desert people)"

Seriously.. it's an off the strip joint that has high top tables and stools reminiscent of the the 50's .. you can hear and feel the whipping air of cars and tour buses flying down the street.. walk up to the window, order from a board and watch your scrumptious creation being made before your eyes.  Talk about Mouthgasm at first and Last bite.. I said to Michael.. $9.95 for a Steak and Cheese?  I hope it's good.. I couldn't finish Half of mine.. the meat was piled High and so tender and well seasoned.. I had mine with the original cheez whiz!   Michael, who considers himself to be a Steak and cheese snob.. couldn't stop raving.. and believe me.. it's well worth the trip.. top it off with Fries that were nom nom nommy and Root beer.. well it was a couple of happy New Las Vegans  lololol   Vegans in name only ~!!!"

Off course it was almost triple digits outside and the thought of eating in the swelter of the day was out of the question.  My order was pretty basic.  It consisted of steak, chez wiz, mushrooms and a pretty tasty bun.  It was a treat so I did not have to pay.  All in all, it was decent sandwich but nothing I would seek out during the dog days of August OR at 3:30AM on the corner of Decatur and Alta."

Sides are expensive too at $4 for an In-N-Out sized paper tray! =/\n\nThe did have variety on sides you can get cheez wheels, deep fried zucchini and deep fried okra. The side of sweet potato fries I ate wasn't bad at all, had good crunch (the number one thing I look for in a fry) and natural sweet potato flavor. The flavor was enhanced even further with this syrup dipping sauce that had a hint of cinnamon. =) \n\nI don't get how people can eat Cheez Whiz it's so processed it can't even be called cheese! I just didn't grow up with it, but apparently it's THE topping to get for Philly Cheesesteaks. You can even get a side of fries slathered with it here. \n\nThis location was most likely converted from a Wienerschnitzel since it had the signature triangle roofline and drive-thru. The covered seating provided sheltered for our group when we experienced a spontaneous downpour during lunch. I enjoyed the mural of Benjamin Franklin affably holding a Philly Cheesesteak, just drives the point home that what is in his hand is indeed a Philly Cheesesteak and if you don't order one here you are un-patriotic! =p"

Gather around kids and let Uncle Rex tell you a story...when Rex was a small child he spent many a month on the East Coast. It was a magical time.  My father, who beat young Rex mercilessly if Rex called him anything but \"The Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora\", was originally from the Northeast.  My father was an odd man, a brutal man, a man with big dreams and small child like hands.  On my fifth birthday he brought Rex with him as he knocked over a 7-11.  As Rex helped him tie up the store clerk he let me pick any one thing Rex wanted in the store.  Young Rex wandered around the store, trying very hard to not step in the pools of blood, Rex saw the object he wanted...Rex turned and said \"Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora can Rex have THAT?\"  He nodded.  Rex kicked the 87 year old man laying on some of it...and picked it up. It was a bag with a delicious cheesesteak in it.  Rex danced. Rex smiled. Rex took the wallet of a crying soccer dad.  Rex was happy.  Rex and Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora drove down the street, the sound of sirens in the distance fading...the smell of the cheesesteak wafting into Rex's young nasal passages.  A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.\n\nPops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!  It is ABSOLUTLEY 100% NOT ALLOWED IN ANY PLACE IN PHILADELPHIA!! Even if asked they WILL NOT DO IT!  So, first and foremost this is NOT A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK PLACE!!! IT IS NOT! END OF STORY!\n\nApologies. Rex passed out and needed a shot of \"Happy Serum\" to get up right again...what is \"Happy Serum\" you ask...heathen...it is 1 part gasoline, 1 part peach schnapps, 1 part wiper fluid. \n\nAnyway, now that we have established this is not a Philly cheesesteak, let's talk about it from a cheesesteak on it's own merits.  First, the rolls are good, the sad part is you can tell the bread is shipped frozen or frozen after it gets to Pops.  Big mistake. It really messes with the bread. It isn't bad, but again it isn't East Coast good.  Cheese...never enough. Never. If you get provolone instead of whiz it is almost non-existent. Shame on you for skimping on the cheese.  The Whiz isn't bad sometimes but more often than not there isn't enough.  The meat isn't bad. It is done well, with one BIG problem...it is often dry. Not enough oil or cooked and then recooked, whatever the reason it is not great.  If you get to Pops on the right day and get lucky, and order correctly, it isn't bad...but the overall consistency is not there.\n\nLastly...the \"Philly\" part of the menu...the Tastycakes, the birch beer, the rest of it...all WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! At Glaziers Market you can get all the stuff for 1/5th of the price.  \n\nHere is my biggest problem...Pop's plays on East Coast memories and locals who don't know any better. That is the biggest crime. It isn't Philly. It isn't a great cheesesteak. It is over priced. It is inconsistent. It just isn't right. It just isn't good.  Most of you will never know better unless you go back east (and my next review for Pizza will tell you how to find GREAT east coast food), and they KNOW you don't know. Pop's has been a place I have tried off and on for almost 8 years.  Rex wants to love it. Rex needs to keep trying every 2 years or so...but much like when his father turned him into the cops at the tender age of 5...Rex is always hurt by Pops. Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora and Pops...shame on you...you know better. Rex knows better. Rex deserves better. So does everyone else."

I thought what a good deal for a sandwich only 6 bucks n i could get a nice breakfast snack, but all i ended up getting was an attitude from some guy who for some reason decided to fight with me. I went to inquire about said sanwich and was quickly cut off by him saying \"we dont have no 6 dollar phillies, not ever.\" (Noting that the sign  specifically reads breakfast phillies, steak, bacon, or ham phillies.) To wit I replied, \"no I'm talking about your sandwiches on the sign\" at which point the Genius behind the counter puts his brain in high gear and repeats \"We dont got any phillies for 6 bucks.\" its like no sh!t Sherlock! Thank you so much for explaining to me that you only have a slight grasp of this thing called communication, how enlightened I am now to the fact that you do not sell 6 buck phillies, and thank you ever so much for the attitude of treating me like I was a 5 year old instead of using commen sense and telling me about the sandwiches I was inquiring about. I left with nothing other then anger, fustration, and a bad taste in my mouth from your customer service skills. Perhaps look elsewheres for your morning meal or you may have to fight with him as well!\n\nupdate: tried them out again for the first time in a year and got a totally f#d up case of food poisoning ughhh they used to be so good..."

The meat is cooked and sitting in jus,  after u order cook puts meat on flat top w your toppings then put in bread they bring in from Philly . The meat is juicy and tasty, bread is soft and chewy. Liked the cheez whizz , onion and mushroom combination . The sandwich was extremely hot had to wait a couple mins to let it cool. We also ordered fries and fried okra. Fries and okra were made to order , the okra was the frozen stuff served with ranch, it was good not great same as the fries. I think I like capriottis cheese steaks a little better, but would come here because they serve fries :) and have more sides then just chips.   Our two phillys , fries and okra came out to $25, which is not cheap  , I'm glad I read the reviews on yelp , which said it was a little spendy, that's y we stopped by 7 eleven and bought a double big gulp for a couple bucks, saved a little there , I think I'll make it a quick tip . They also have hoagies  .  I will back to try the other menu items. I luv a sandwich shop that serves fries."

There's been a lot of hype recently over Pop's Philly Steaks--especially now that they have a food truck running (I see them parked in front of LVAC and downtown for Vegas StrEats.) \n\nA few of my friends went down to their free-standing restaurant to eat and said the food was awesome! They're 24-hrs which totally works with my hectic schedule. So I made it a point to stop by. \n\nI went around 10 or 11pm. No crowd, little wait, quick service. The food is cooked right there in front of us and they prepare everything \"to-go.\" I ordered a Philly with onions and provolone and a heaping portion of fried okra luxuriously served in a large paper bag. My meal cost approx $15 w/o a drink.\n\nI think Pop's is simply a hot sandwich. Not particularly flavorful or delicious. It's alright food, I would just rather spend my $15 elsewhere. I might give them another shot in the future. I've heard this place is hott on the cheese whiz. But overall it was a mediocre meal. Not bad food, just maybe not my kinda food. \n\nThe seating is entirely outdoors (not so great for the hot summer days or cold winter nights)--make sure you dress appropriately."

Unfortunately, the last 2 times I've eaten here the food has been complete slop.  Granted, both times have been late night excursions, but being a 24 hour business that shouldn't make a difference.   Few weeks  back I grabbed an Italian sausage sandwich with peppers and it was an abomination.  The entire sandwich was drenched in something resembling marinara sauce but it had very little flavor and was so messy you couldn't even really call it a sandwich anymore.  Tonight, I got a philly (their claim to fame) and once again it was just complete slop.  The bread doesn't taste toasted, the meat has very little flavor, very few peppers and slimy canned mushrooms.  Worse, they just dump a ton of Cheez Whiz on it and expect that to make up for the utter lack of taste.  Pretty sure this will be my last time, but I will give them props for variety and business hours.  I hope they bring back some quality soon, because this stuff is like food you cobble together yourself out of the fridge when you come home from a night out drinking."

Seriously, this place had a piece of dry whatever bread which a bunch of overly greasy crap in it. No special flavor, delightful texture, wonderful aroma, extra special something..NADA. The only reason this place is getting two stars is because the fries were decent and well done( which I like) but still average.

I was always curious about it, and 20 something years later I finally made the trip to explore my curiousity. \n\nLike I said, Pop's is a stand-alone restaurant, with only outdoor seating. It's an order at the window kind of place where you can take food to-go or eat at one of the tables in their outdoor patio area. We arrived around 8pm on a Sunday night and chose to eat outside while the food was fresh and hot.  One downfall of outdoor only seating is bugs, so next time we'll probably get it to-go.\n\nThese are the items we ordered:\n\n#32 Philly Cheesesteak with Peppers and Mushrooms - we chose provolone, but you can get cheese whiz, swiss, or american cheese too. I really enjoyed the roll. It was fresh and chewy, just the way I like it. The steak, mushrooms, and peppers were just okay. I like Capriottis cheesesteak a lot more. For $10.99 I was hoping for a loaded sandwich with lots of meat and cheese. Make sure you get lots of napkins, because it's greasy, naturally. 3/5\n\nFried Okra - probably would not order these again. They absorbed a lot ot the grease from cooking and left a gross film in mouth after eating them. However, they were crispy, so they get credit for that. These come with a side of ranch.  2/5\n\nSweet Potato Fries - nice and crispy and really delicious. These were served with a side of sugary dipping sauce that I didn't care for. 5/5\n\nFranks Ginger Ale - would have been refreshing if it was cold. Served in a can, it was lukewarm. I saw the employee take it out of a fridge too. I asked for a cup of ice and my problem was solved. 3/5\n\nI'll probably visit again after exploring more of the city's options in the cheesesteak category. They've been in that same location for more than 20 years, so it's probable that they have loyal customers. The folks working in the stand were nice and smiley and that'll win a return visit more often than not! Maybe I'll try a grinder next time!"

First time was by stumbling onto it on accidents while trying to find another Philly cheese place I had a coupon for. They have a walk up window where you watch the grill master make your sandwiches.\n\nBoth times I got the mushroom, pepper and onion philly.Juicey, cheesy and big! Room mate got the pastrami both times as well. Another big juicy sandwich. I normally don't like pastrami minus a place in Cali name The Hat! Stole a bite to try it and may actually get it next time. We have had the fried green beans , yummy with a thick ranch sauce. The sweet potato fries with some sort of coconut dipping sauce. They should be considered a sin. So sweet and yummy. Whole reason I went back a second time was to have my friend try them with a to go order.\n\nAlso had the banana fosters bites. First one was yummy second one was ok, third one I only had the half of before I stopped eating it. Tasted like warm banana pudding with a soggy graham cracker crust and deep fried with a thin batter. Think they were store bought  rather then made on location. A good thing to try in a group but I won't be ordering them again for just me.  \n\nPrices are good for the amount of food you get. Main and pretty much only draw back I can think of is no indoor seating. Definitely going back more in the summer . Right on the street and fun to watch passing traffic but in the winter its a bit to cold. We wolfed down our food as quickly as we could the first time, and wised up the second time with a to go order.

Add in that this place is about a mile from home for me, and that it's 24 hours, and it's pretty much kismet that I would finally come here and actually really like it.\n\nFirst off, its a bit  pricier than expected: spent $25 on dinner for me and the BF.\nAs others have said though, the sandwiches are beyond huge enough to share.  We got the #32 peppers and onions cheesesteak with provolone ($11), added on sides of chili cheese fries ($4) and an order of wings (10 for $8), and a Franks black cherry soda ($2).  For the price, the sandwich and wings were good portions. I didn't think the same thing about the soda or fries though- but then again, I'm not a soda person in the first place, though I understand this brand is apparently something special.\n\nThe sandwich itself, in addition to being huge, was stuffed full of meat and veggies. The cheese was a little light for my liking, and it was slightly on the dry side toward the ends of the sandwich, but it was good. In the future, I'd probably stick to the mushroom one though.\nThe chili cheese fries were fairly standard and a smaller portion than I expected but we still devoured them in record time. The wings, though, were a surprise. I ordered the mild ones rather than hot, and still found these to be surprisingly spicy. I'd definitely hesitate before ordering their \"flamin'\" style, I can't imagine how much hotter they must get. Portion was good for the price, wings were an average size without being too small or overly fried or breaded. Huge portion of ranch for dipping. I liked how easily the meat came off the bone, too. A little less messy than usual. \n\nWe ate at the patio area, and it was noisy and difficult to carry on conversation, as others have said. However, it wasn't a total turn off and in fact kind of added to the experience. I'll have to come back and try the sweet potato fries...and the breakfast sandwiches... maybe I'll add the Whiz next time, too."

And while the now-defunct Triple Play was better (and cheaper), this is the place to go if you're craving a cheesesteak.\n\nWe ordered one provolone and one Cheez Whiz, both with onions. At $10 a pop (plus an extra $5 for fries and tip), this was a pricey lunch! But we don't eat there often (and no one should probably be making a cheesesteak part of their daily diet), so the splurge was worth it. Plenty of meat, nice chewy bread, and a healthy (or not) helping of cheese on each. The fries were kind of mushy, but they served their purpose. Next time we'll try the fried okra. (They also have fried mushrooms, sweet potato fries, and a few other sides that didn't appeal to me.)\n\nIf you take a trip to the A-frame building, know your protocol before stepping up to the window: Order on the left, watch the guy make your food, then pay on the right. There's a small outdoor dining area if you want to breathe in the smells of fried onions and exhaust fumes from passing cars. Otherwise, do what we do: Take your cheesesteaks home, where you can enjoy them with a nice cold beverage of your choosing."

To date, I have never failed to finish a cheesesteak. I guess there's a first time for everything. To add insult to injury, I had way too many impromptu visits to the porcelain thrown after my visit, I won't be back.\n\nIf you insist on eating here, get it to go.

The reaction I get from other customers is always interesting as I tell the cook I'm a vegetarian, HOWEVER it turns out that one of the cooks that's there often is actually a vegetarian too, and note to some of you tough-guys: just because some of us vegetarians care enough about other animals to not eat them, it does not imply we don't mind fighting & hurting some dumb human who decides he needs to offer his opinion on vegetarians if he overhears our order.\n\n\n  The bread is very fresh, and of course it & the rest of the gooey, heart-attack-calling mess tastes great.    I used to get a side of fries, but they weren't anything special, and even 200+lb glutton me doesn't need to fries if I'm planning on eating the whole sandwich then & there.\n\n  I can & will continue to try other cheesesteak joints.   I know this will disgust some of you carnivores, but some cheese-steak places actually have a fake meat item (called seitan) that they'll use to create a vegetarian cheesesteak that looks and YES, once you add the cheeses, onions, sauces, etc. TASTES very similar to a real cheesesteak, so I am still looking for places that do that (Pop's doesn't).     However, the product I eat at Pop's is great, and another wonderful thing about it is that it's open 24/7.\n\n It's shaded but otherwise outdoor seating, right along the race-track/circus show that is Decatur Blvd near Arizona Charlie's -- NOT a place to be for the faint of heart, so either get it to go & get the hell out of that area, or strap-up your gat & go sit there at 2AM & enjoy your food & the 'entertainment' the street & Pop's provide."

The roll didn't even taste all the fresh at all.\n\nNow I get to go through the rest of the day feeling like I have a bowling ball in my stomach.  I guess that's what I get for not eating greasy food all that often...\n\nI'll pass, thank you.  Those who like it can keep on going, but I will go elsewhere."

Like the city itself this place is open 24/7. \n\nThe last time I was here grabbed a Philly with pepper and onions, provolone and cheese wiz. The was so good it was worth the extra weight and the guilty feeling about not being true to the good ole diet. On the few occasions I have been lucky enough to eat here they do not disappoint. The only thing that puts this as a 4 instread of a 5 is the location. Though I have never had any issues here, I also don't feel it is the safest part of town. Since I am usally in and out of here I will risk it. Like I said nothing has ever happened(knock on wood). \n\nIf you are craving great eats anytime of the day I would stop into POP's. The Philly Cheese Steaks are awesome."

Why the 4 stars you ask, well for one thing I really didn't like their pastrami fries and yes it was enough to bump it down one star. For one thing I strongly believe that if a business/restaurant deserves 5 stars, you better believe that everything they serve and their customer service is top notch. And I failed to believe everything on the menu was good, but you better believe that their philly cheese steaks are probably the best I've tried in LV and in the Bay Area.\n\nThe first time I was here I ordered the philly cheese steak with bacon and swiss #9. It was just as good as advertised and just as good as it looked while the cook was making it. I also ordered the cheese whiz fries and boy was that also yummy. I also ordered fried 'shrooms, and those little mouth watering bites were simply just awesome. It was the first time I tried anything mushroom fried in batter, and I was damn glad this place was my first. The second time I ate here I ordered the pizza philly cheese steak.....mmmmm, was that yummy it was like ordering on of my two favorite things and smashing it into one nice juicy hoagie. I also ordered cheese whiz fries again, but this time I had the master cook add some bacon in it, man was that good.\n\nIf I really had more time to spend in Las Vegas, I sure would come here a few more times and try more off the menu. I also love the fact that this place is open 24 hours. With me being on Vegas party time and coming home about 3 or 4 in the morning after the casino, this place just becomes a savior.\n\nThank goodness for Pops Philly Steaks open 24 hours and its yummy juicyness of flavorful cheeeeeeese steaks. Keep up the good work guys, when I'm back in town you better believe I'll be back for more! It's like philly cheese steaks from heaven. YUM!"

            "review": "Meh... it certainly it not BOO's Philly Cheesesteaks in Los Angeles, but I guess if you want something this does fine... I'm picky about flavor and their cheesesteaks lacked flavor, it was it's just too salty. Star snatched. Salt doesn't equate flavor. The meat tasted like \"steakums\" not fresh to me. Fresh meat has a texture to it that is tender and you don't have the chomp down on a cheesesteak... it should practically melt in your mouth, regardless of the toppings selected. Star snatched. I ordered the mushroom steak and asked for bell peppers as well... get home they aren't even in the sandwich- and no they weren't busy enough to excuse it. Star snatched. On top of all of that...The provolone cheese wasn't even melted... everything was \"extra\" and I've never been anywhere that charges \"Per topping\" it's usually whatever steak-combination you choose and you can say if you do or do not want grilled onions and/or bell peppers... not that it is an extra charge unless you actually want EXTRA. no grilled onions just a sad excuse for a Philly cheesesteak IMHO, but alas this is Vegas. My search for a cheesesteak home out here continues. The plus I guess is is it's open 24/7... but the only people who would care about that is those who believe this food to be good. Soooo yeah- no. I'll leave it at 2 stars for decent service. I however, won't be back... I can't risk paying $20 again for over-salted food that will not be how I truly like it."

And it was really really slimy inside. Yes I know it's okra... But when they are fried well... The sliminess goes away and sadly this was not the case for them.  So sad as I love love me some fried okra. Flavor (2/5)\n\nI also got the fries and they were just fries. Not really crispy.... Kinda sad soggy fries. My bf liked the fact that they gave ranch with it.... But eh... Flavor (2/5)....I would've given it 1 star but since my bf loved the ranch I gave then another star for the ranch. :/\n\nFor the main course I got the #6... The Philly with mushrooms and cheese.... OK... The bread was freaking awesome! Perfect chew and softness... Just perfect. BUT the meat... Mushrooms and onions were really really under seasoned. It was very blah. I mean the Philly cheese steak at subway tasted better then this. :( very disappointing since this is what they are known for. (2/5)... And that is being generous. \n\nService was OK... Nothing mind blowing....(2/5)\n\nAmbiance was.... It's a mom and pop type store.... So it was kind of ghetto.... Without the cutesy stuff that u normally see in a mom and pop... And no bathroom at all either (1/5)\n\nWill I be returning.... Most likely no.... One it is too far and for the price there are other things that I would rather eat.  The prices for the sandwiches ranged from $10 and up and the Specialty sides were $4.... And as nothing that I had made me want to have another bite....I don't think I'll be returning. :("

They have many different sandwiches but I ordered a classic philly cheese steak, as I was leaving the front window I see the cook pull meat out of a pan that had been pre cooked already, right then and there I was disappointed. Sandwich was okay and a little greasey. I haven't been here in awhile and maybe they have changed their ways of cooking a fresh philly, at least I hope so."
