It was a really huge disappointment. \n\nThey didn't seem to have a hostess for about 5 minutes until one appeared from the kitchen and sat us. \n\nOrdered a Cesar salad - wilted brown lettuce. \nOrdered a margarita flatbread - basically an open faced quesadilla with salsa Fresca on top and it tasted like the tap water - dirty & old. \nOrdered mozzarella sticks - tolerable because the marinara sauce was great  \n\nWe sent back to flat bread and the waitress gave us major attitude."

They're also open late night, so when you're done gambling and headed back to your room and wanna grab a late night bite to eat, head over there. \n\nTheir servers are really nice and friendly, which makes everything even better. They also have their own beers - try them, they're really good. \n\nOverall, I really like it here. I definitely suggest making this a stop if you're staying Downtown - and even if you're not. :)"

The restaurant/bar is a pretty good size with high ceilings, multiple TV's, a good crowd and a long bar. They're usually always busy but the food doesn't very long to come out. I've only had appetizers here; the nachos were awesome but I was really disappointed in the deep fried mushrooms. They tasted like dirt so I know they weren't rinsed well. \n\nThe customer service wasn't bad and watching the Giants win the World Series made my experience at Triple 7 even sweeter. It's a good place for groups and I'd consider returning if I'm looking for a few drinks and bar food at a great price. Most appetizers were an average of $8. Hard to beat that!"

And I can say, it's still just as good as I remembered. \n\nThe first time I came here I ordered a simple beer (very veryyyy cheap) and a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich, and let me tell you.. Mmm Mmm Mmm!! So yumms!\n\nOn my recent trip, I ordered 6 oysters on the half shell (comes with horseradish & cocktail sauce) and fish n' chips. The oysters we're very fresh & my family & I took one each & cheered to being in Vegas. The fish & chips we're pretty good as well. The fish meat was very soft, yet flaky, and the batter wasn't too thick, but not too thin. One thing I would recommend is the philly cheesesteak & an iced cold brewski! But Triple 7 hasn't disappointed yet, so feel free to try anything on their menu with a beer, & you should be good to go!"

Not only are their (seasonally-changing) home brews cheap & impressive, their food menu is pretty killer as well. From 11 PM until 2 AM, they run an awesome deal where you get a 16 oz. beer and a 10\" pizza for $5. Yes, I repeat: BEER AND A WHOLE PIZZA FOR ONLY $5.00! One of the best, late-night deals downtown in my opinion. Plus, their pizza is good as hell. Screw that $4+ per slice sh*t elsewhere!\n\nOne extra shout-out to my usual bartender, Richard, for being awesome! :-)"

Oh yeah, with and awkward sushi bar in the back. Your typical depressing downtown vegas crowd.\nFood was pretty gross. I may not ever eat shrimp again because of this place. It looked like shrimp, but it tasted kinda look rotten overcooked chicken. \nThe portobello mushroom was very stringy and also tasted as if it had just been microwaved after being frozen since the ice age."

Anytime sushi option with the meals make this joint unique I'm food choice variety. \n\nI'm really not a beer person but I guess people here come for the best of that too'\nLove the atmosphere and service is fast considering the variety of dishes the kitchen needs to prepare. \n\nFood for the mood...you can be sure that if you're feeling light there's great salads and appetizers, fresh oysters, edamame, artichoke dips, sliders, and every traditional favs. Or if you're feeling hearty try king size prime rib, meatloaf, Alfredo with garlic bread, many more!!!\n\nFood has always tasted grand, I don't know what the bad reviews were eating but I haven't had anything I didn't like. So give them a try...a full house and lines out the door during mealtime don't happen at joints with food that suck!"

This bar is really awesome. Great service, fast food and great specials. After 11 they have a beer and a pizza for $5. How much better can it get?? \n\nWe always come after 11 for the special but we usually order more food than just the special. My boyfriend always gets the pizza and I usually get the jalape\u00f1o poppers with a few other things. Those jalape\u00f1o poppers are AMAZING. This time around I got wings and garlic fries. Honestly they were meh. But everything else I've had here was really great, from the margerhita pizza to the prime rib.\n\nAgain though, I can't stress how awesome Ron and Richard are!! I only come when they're here. They're always on top of it with new beers (my boyfriend drinks them EXTREMELY FAST) and with anything we need with our food. They're super personable and friendly. This has been our late night spot since we moved downtown and it's just great. \n\nThanks Ron and Richard!!!"

I don't think it is the kitchen so much as they do not have enough servers for the number of tables. Refills are nearly impossible to get. The food arrives and you often don't see the waitress again until it is time for the check. \n\nThis place would be the best choice for its segment downtown if they could get the service aspect down."

The sushi was poor and the sandwich I had was bad. I heard the oxtail soup was good but I didn't try it. The cheeseburger was burnt and unseasoned. The fries were cold. My friend John Tip. liked his Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich. The service was the worst when the place was empty. I tried the steak special and I was very disappointed. The steak tasted like it was cooked frozen. The eggs were cooked well. The drinks were good except for the water. Beer and Ale are the Key."

It's served in a cheese tortilla bowl, with ice burg lettuce, some crumbled bacon, diced tomato and eggs and your choice of salad dressing.   I got the vinaigrette.\n\nThe salad was a decent size, however, the \"cheese bowl\" it was served in was a little stale, and the vinaigrette was too strong.  Service was good, I love the large glass they use for their beverages, no refill was needed it was so big."

During this trip, we visited the restaurant twice.  \n\nWith the first visit, we ordered burgers (mom got the cheeseburger and I got the mushroom burger).  She opted for sweet potato fries and I got regular fries.  The burgers came out quickly and they were cooked the way we wanted.  Nothing too spectacular...\n\nBut on the second visit, we ordered their BBQ chicken pizza and an order of potstickers.  The potstickers were okay and came with a tasty sauce.  The pizza was awesome!  It was a bit bigger than one from CPK and was enough for the two of us to share.  There was just the right amount of chicken, onions, and barbecue sauce on each piece.  \n\nThe atmosphere is somewhat noisy and it was hard to have a real conversation without yelling across the table.  There are various sports shows going on around the bar.  \n\nI know that we'll return the next time we come to Vegas.  I'll just order another pizza to try."

Given a very small per diem, I was looking for a nice steak dinner without the strip prices. My fellow Yelpers recommended the 777 Brewery, and I'm glad they did!\n\nWe started with drinks, a Black Chip Porter and Sis had a mojito. Both were tasty. The porter was a bit mild, but had a light, smooth, nutty taste. Sis said her mojito was very good. Next, we had the pot sticker app and it was awesome, one of the best I've had. I then had a \"side salad\" that was the size of a meal, so we split that. Finally, our 16 oz rib eyes came out. They were delicious! Sis had a perfect rare and mine was a perfect med rare. Baked potato was awesome, the side veg was the only meh part of the meal. I was so full, it didn't matter. My only disappointment was I couldn't take my leftovers home.\n\nOur total bill was $56!\n\nAfter dinner, we walked the two blocks back to Fremont Street for more fun.

I read yelpers review of this place and couldn't believe it was less expensive and higher rated than the Country Club at Wynns (one of my personal favorites).\n\nWell it is good but it is no CC.  They shouldn't even be in the same category (American traditional).  But the truth is, it is way better than most places I have been to in Vegas.  The Nachos were crazy yummy and paired perfectly with their Pale Ale.  I'm a bit of a microbrew snob but their Pale Ale was very flavorful and hearty.  It is inside Main St Casino which is not a bad place although I decided to drive over to the Nugget from there instead of walk even though it was just about 3 blocks.  \n\nThe food is above average.  The service slightly above average but for some reason they were very slow on bringing me the check.  In their defense, they were getting busier really quickly.  \n\nThis would be a good place to catch the game and hang with friends.  All the amenities of a heavily TV'd sports bar but with real food.  I think the Country Club is substantially better this Triple 7 is far better than most places in Vegas.  Very nice!"

That was actually surprising that there was pretty much no wait time compared to when we came here last year.

We came here last year and tried it out, and have decided to come back every time we visit.  It's pretty rare to come across fresh fish, let alone, fresh and tasty POKE, and... in vegas!? If you're looking for something meaty, try the 1lb t-bone steak.  It was good and cooked perfectly to our liking.  While you're waiting, try the hot crab and artichoke dip that comes with garlic bread and chips to spread or dip it in.  It's all kinds of cream, crab and buttery goodness.  If you're watching your cholesterol, I would say stay away from it, it's VERY rich, but if it's something you only have a couple times a year, I say go for it.

            "review": "We decided to stop by here for lunch recently.  I had the Portobello Burger, which has a giant portobello in place of a hamburger.  It was quite nice actually, and if you like mushrooms, I highly recommend it!  My friends had some dishes that they didn't quite like though, including the personal pizzas, which were not unlike most generic casino pizzas, and the fish tacos.\n\nThe dining area is very large, and can accommodate the largest parties.  The walls are lined with various awards that they have received for their beers.  The brewery itself is clearly visible through the glass walls.  We watched a brewer do some house cleaning while we enjoyed our beers.  \n\nSpeaking of beer, the reason to come to the Triple 7 is the microbrewery.  I ordered the porter, which was a nice stout.  It was very smooth and tasty.  It paired well with my burger.  I also ordered a sampler of the other beers.  The Stout IPA they had specially for this season was also a really good beer.  I wouldn't say its the best stout that I have had, but the extra hoppy bite that it had was quite nice.  I wasn't impressed with the other brews, however.  The red ale was more of a light beer with a red ale tint to it.  The blackcherry stout was a sweet, cough syrup thing.  Non-beer drinkers might like that one.  The other light beers aren't really worth mentioning.  \n\nAny brewer who experiments with craft beers in Vegas deserves a good review though. In my opinion, the food was good enough to come back for the beer.  Stick to the stouts though, as that seems to be the Triple 7's specialty."

With its greasy, cheesy goodness, each bite is delish!\n\nHubby ordered the pepperoni pizza, which was just as tasty as the cheese bread but with pepperoni on top. I ordered their 1/2 lb prime rib, which was cooked to perfection. The 1/2 lb prime rib is a steal! For only about $8.99, you get the 1/2 lb prime rib, vegetables and a choice of a baked potato, rice or fries. I opted for the baked potato. Just thinking of how it was makes my mouth water.

Over the course of the night, the waitstaff was really friendly and very helpful. For drinks, my self and my cousin ordered a couple micros. I had my traditional Red (the Royal Red Lager) and he had the brewmaster's special (an IPA).

I had the roasted veggie sandwich, and the wife got the veggie sushi. My family had burgers and chicken fingers. My sandwich was very good, a little messy by the veggies were roasted quite nicely and the fries were pretty amazing. It was like having 2 sandwiches, which is why the wife and I shared. The veggie sushi (avocado, carrot, red pepper) was very tasty as well. \n\nOn to the important part, the beer. The Royal Red was pretty light (similar to a Killian's). It was malty, but not too strong. It went down smooth, but not the best local red I've had. I also had the sampler. Overall the beer quality was pretty average. The pale ale had a nice wheat aftertaste, and was pretty smooth. The IPA was hoppy, but more earthy than anything else. Admittedly, I usually don't like IPA's, but this one I disliked for the earthy flavor, not the hoppiness. \n\nOverall, this was a good choice. We would definitely return for the food.

No, Triple 7 let's the whole restaurant partake in this goodness. They have a limited HH food menu that consists of quesadillas, wings, calamari, and maybe two other items for 4.50. We ended up splitting an order of the calamari. The squid were lightly battered and flash fried. The tenderness of the meat is not toughened in the process and still came out crispy.

Upon being quickly seated we waited. \n\nAnd waited and then waited, waited some more and after listening to four songs, I sarcastically asking the hostess that seated us is if there was wait service or whether something had changed.  \n\nShe didn't apologize, just questioned that no one had come to even drop off water and went towards the back muttering. \n\nTwo songs later, we admitted defeat and just left. \n\nThis was at 11pm. The place was barely 1/3 full. Could it of been that we were Asian and none of the staff was?  At a hotel that caters to Hawaii?  We didn't get a chance to be asses since we never were approached with any type of service other than being seated. \n\nI personally have eaten here 25+ times before with no issues like this. It'll be a while before I think about going back. There is nothing that special about the food here, then there's the service.   Meh."

It's my home bar away from home. It's so great here, I wished I live closer. I have been coming here about once every 4-6 months for the last ten years.  Here is why.\n\nCome here for happy hour. I believe it's weekdays from 3-6. I was lucky enough to make it down here despite the weekend traffic and stopping by Mirage for a quick conference this past Friday. Once here, if you were by yourself like I was, you will be fortunate enough to just hop to the bar, watch the NBA playoffs on the flat screens, have a beer in hand, and converse with the locals.\n\nWhat do you order here during happy hour? \n\nTHE BREWMASTER SPECIAL.-I had a porter this time, which I might add, is something I usually do not drink. Folks, it was only $2 for a 16 oz. of handcrafter goodness and it was sweet and easy going down. Yes, I had more than one and note, you cannot get this flavor at the tables while you're playing.  I usually get the pale ale here, that is my favorite! \n\nAn order of hotwings-These aren't the best I've had but it's pretty damn good for sharing or if you're a pig like me, just eat it yourself and it'll set you back only $4.25. \n\nAn order of oysters-They are your normal oysters, nothing too special, though they are sweet and it is cleaned through well. 6 pcs are only $7.50. Comes with the cocktail sauce and horseradish. \n\nThese prices reflect only during happy hour. I have to say, this past Friday, I was really happy in less than an hour."

Main St. can always be depended on for the best pale ale in town.  Only 2 bucks each during happy hour or after midnight!  They also have great pub snacks... like garlic fries, wild mushroom pizza, veggie (or regular) burgers and a full sushi bar.  The only drawback is the TVs, which are constantly tuned to either World Series of Poker or Ultimate Fighting Championship.  Also the \"brewmaster special\" beer selections have been known to be pretty weird & unappetizing... like Raspberry Creme Ale.  Sounds like sweet chick beer to me... gimme real beer!  But as long as the very hoppy Pale Ale is available this is not a real problem!  This place can also get very crowded on Friday/Saturday nights, and so occasionally feels like some sort of feeding lot."

I had read several reviews giving this eating establishment high marks.  The restaurant was very busy (about 7pm), but we were seated immediately without any delay.  There are long bars on each side of the room with seating in between.  Our server came right away, delivered menus, and took our drink orders.  They offer a sampler of 5 or 6 different micro-brews you can get for $5.50.  Two of us ordered this sampler.  I enjoyed all the varieties, but I think I like the \"Royal Red\" brew the best.  \n\nThe menu was quite varied.  I ordered the pale ale ribeye, medium well.  Sides were baked potato and green beans.  I also ordered an appetizer of fried calamari.  The calamari was some of the best I've ever had.  Generous portion, very crispy and light.  My steak came out more on the medium rare side instead of medium well.  I almost sent it back, but I don't really like to complain so I went ahead and ate all but the very center.  The sides were just okay.  \n\nOverall, the food wasn't bad, the drinks were great, and we enjoyed the lively atmosphere and the casino/hotel itself as well.  Will be going back again next year."

Sushi and beer during happy hour does justice to the term here. \n\nFor the regular menu, they charge $1.00 for sharing a extra plate when sharing an entree, but that's well worth it because a lot of their entrees, you can easily share. For instance, their hamburgers start off as a half pound patty - that's two quarter-pounders at McDonalds. They also have a half pound hot dog, which two can easily share, especially if you add chili to it. \n\nHowever, quantity doesn't always mean quality. I find the taste of the entrees here to be disappointing. They look pleasing to the eye, but when you bite into the food, the flavor is missing. It's like you need a beer to enhance your taste buds. Without the beer, the food just doesn't cut it. \n\nBesides the nature of Happy Hour, the beer is the best thing about this place. Like any other Microbrewery, the beer stands out from the standard fare, maybe because it's more fresh, if that makes sense. \n\nAll in all, though, it's really the only casually priced sit-down/wait service place in the Main Street/California Casino complex, and if you are in the mood for this type of dining and don't want to go outside, Triple 7 is an adequate choice. Beer and Sushi during Happy Hour, this would be a very good choice."

He had only like 3 bites left of the burger anyway :D. \nAnyways, I love their chicken nugget appetizer! Though I'm not big fan of any wing sauces..The sauce was very powerful and tasty. Just not my type of things though. Their garlic fries as delicious! Their pizza is hand made when you order. I saw the chef working on it and spreading cheese and then in the oven it goes! All to go orders are additional $2. But HEY, that was the tip money anyway if I was going to eat there you know? \nWhats unique about this place is that they have great burgers, YET they have a personal sushi chef making sushi till 12am! Now that is amazing!! I loved the unagi sushi that I ordered. The chef even shaped my wasabi into a leaf! \n\nOh and for you beer drinkers out there...This location actually brews their own beer. You can see the machinery in my photos. They have a 5 beer sampler on the menu that is only $5.99 and any other beer you order is just as cheap and delightful! \n\nA must dine restaurant :) We will be coming back soon!"

The atmosphere is always good, service is usually pretty good - though some of the ladies are better than others (I've never had a male server there).\n\nIt's mere blocks from where I work, so it tends to be someplace we fall back on, but in the past few months, I haven't had great experience when branching out on the menu.  Nearly everyone has a favorite food and doesn't eat much else.  We like the salads, pizza, grilled chicken, sushi and most of the appetizers. \n\nWe keep going back because it's close, the drinks (at the Casino bar next to the buffet) are cheap and the service is pretty good.  They don't fret when 8 people come in all of a sudden and want a table.  If the food was better, they'd probably get 4 stars, but as it is, they get 2.\n\nSo... based on my experience - Do's and Don'ts\n\nDo:\nStop at the Casino bar before coming in - the drinks are cheaper (.99 Margaritas, $1.25 beer)\nTry the sushi - it's probably my favorite thing on the menu.  I've tried a variety of it and while the selection isn't huge, it is good.\nHave a salad or something else that you know the kitchen has to make.  Much of the food is frozen, but the fresh things are good.\n\nDon't:\nEat the burgers - they are frozen, premade patties that never taste good.\nMake it complicated - the kitchen doesn't take change well\nTry to get split checks - just come with cash if you're in a group."

Service was slow, but they were really crowded and our waitress always made the effort to get things to us quickly as possible. Best of all, our meal was cheap. Like really cheap. That made the meal all the better. \n\nI'll definitely be back when I'm in the area!"

A little sweet for the beer pounder, but excellent taste.  As for food, we had the BBQ chicken pizza - excellent; and the Mushroom pizza - pretty decent.  Would have given the place 5/5 if the mushroom pizza had a little more umph.   6 beers; 2 pizzas - 30 bucks.  Can't beat that in Vegas, baby!  Great waitstaff."

I couldn't think of a luckier  place to write about for the landmark Yelp review 777 than 777 Microbrewery and Restaurant in the downtown Las Vegas.\n\n   Where Yelp review #777 appears once in my lifetime, the Triple 7 Microbrewery appears often. The surface parking lot at Main Street Station is my parking place of choice when I visit the Fremont Street Experience. The deal is that you have to buy $5 worth of food or drinks to validate the $5 to use the parking lot. Usually I make a beeline to the Triple 7 for a lucky cold one or two before a night on Fremont Street. The problem is that the beer is so inexpensive causing me to buy two to cover the validation. For example, currently draft beer is $2 during football. That was the case yesterday when I drank a large draft strawberry beer that came out to  $2.16 after tax. \n\n   Triple 7 is an upbeat spot to enjoy a couple of Lucky cold ones. The atmosphere is rock & roll music, professional sports, bar talk, and the 1800s railroad station motif that permeates Main Street Station. Yesterday I'd take in U2's \"With or Without You\" between glances of a soccer and baseball game. Triple 7 is a cavernous bar and restaurant with high ceilings bordered by two large bars and a microbrewery. The large space in between is filled with tables. From past experience, the bar on the right is the quiet bar that is frequently closed where the bar on the left is the party bar. Regardless of where you sit, a lucky strawberry or any microbrewery beer tastes good.\n\n   Yesterday, I took my Triple 7 experience to the next level by returning for dinner. Besides being a microbrewery, it is the unofficial cafe of Main Street Station unless you count the cafe in its sister property The California. After spending time in the Fremont Street Experience, I returned for dinner. Let me say that I was impressed. I ordered the meatloaf which included a vegetable of choice and mixed vegetables for $8.99. My choice of vegetable of the day was a baked potato. I added soup of the day for an additional  $1.99. Complimenting the food, I passed over a beer for Pepsi. The chicken gumbo soup with saltine crackers was of the same high quality as their beer. But the meatloaf was the bomb. The quality and quantity satisfied my expectations. The tasty mushroom gravy with genuine mushrooms brought the meatloaf to a level that exceeded my expectations for a microbrewery restaurant. The baked potato that included butter and Land O Lakes sour cream was  mutant. I don't recall eating a baked potato this large. Ultimately the soda glass was huge. All this came out to around $15.25.\n\n    Throughout dinner, the waitress was attentive and friendly. Additionally she did not make the error of serving the soup too close to the entree or rush me.\n\n  When I drink a cold one in Triple 7, it is \"Cheers \" to good luck. In conclusion Review 777 is an Internet toast \"to good luck and good times.\""

I had one of their blueberry based beers, and it was like drinking a dessert.  Their microbrewery is huge, and is housed in an even larger room.  The layout is very, very classy, and best of all, no smoking, so I was able to enjoy my drinks even more.\n\nThe real winner for me was the crab and artichoke dip served with chips and garlic bread.  I'm a fan of both seafood AND dips, and this particular combination had me scraping the bowl for every last attainable morsel. \n\nThe service was also great.  The guy was on top of things, never obtrusive, but always around for a refill.  And when I looked at my final tab, the price was ridiculously cheap for what I ordered.  Quality foodstuffs for a really workable price.\n\nMake no mistake, I was pretty comfortable by the time I strolled out of the place.  The beverages kicked in as we were leaving, and honestly, it was more the relaxed buzz variety than the staggering out, \"please hold me up\" type.  I attest that to the overall quality and flavor of the drinks.\n\nI don't hear a lot of people talking about this place, and I don't know why.  It's certainly something to check out while adventuring on Fremont Street."

Now for the most important part, the food and brew. I ordered the Korean tacos and two brews. The tacos were excellent with an amazing spicy kick typical of great Korean food, the brews were off the hook, they had a great batch of hefeweizen and an awesome triple bock named after our waitress (who was awesome). All in all the microbrew is top notch and the food and ambiance is 5 star, why this place isn't packed to the ceiling is simply location. People when on Freemont st expand your horizons there is more in life than tasteless food from Tony Roma's and gimmick diners like the Heart Attack grill!!!...use Google map it's 3min off Freemont and well worth the walk! I love this place and will be back with my family next year!"

There is a weekday Happy Hour, but we just missed it.  Also, don't depend on the website for prices, as they were slightly higher when I looked at the current menu. \n\nThere was quite a crowd- it's a popular spot. We went to the bar, and the hostess said she'd get us a table as they opened up, because nothing was open. So we went to the bar, which was about 75% capacity, when we arrived. And about 20 minutes later, it was full. My friend had a soda, and I had a glass of merlot (not bad)- for both drinks, it was less than $6. There was only one bartender- and he was busy. He was nice, though; he gave us the receipt so we could show it to the server, for a free refill on the soda. \n\nSo our friend got there and she got us a table (??? not sure but I think that the hostess forgot about us, because people kept coming inside, and getting tables). Our server was busy too. So we ordered 6 rolls (spicy tuna, california roll, caterpillar & philadelphia) and split them. The bill was $51- which between 3 people, plus tip, was $20 each- that wasn't bad. \n\nI like that the restaurant space is very wide open and not dark at all- with a view of the brewery too. If you don't wanna wait, I suggest you get there early, especially on a Friday night. Lunch & Dinner menu has appetizers, salads, soups/chili, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, brewmasters favorites, dinner specials, & desserts. I don't drink beer so I can't tell you anything about it, except that the prices seem reasonable. The last time I was here (my previous relationship), I had the peel and shrimp bucket deal (it's pretty big). The casino itself is pretty smoky, FYI."

With plenty of tables available, the hostess was absent for more than 5 minutes and no one offered to seat us, although servers DID pass us by. When finally seated, it took nearly 10 more minutes for a server to acknowledge our presence, then no water for another 5 minutes. \n\nIt was at that point, we left, went upstairs to Aloha Specialties, located on the California Hotel & Casino's mezzanine, to have a delicious meal. \n\nMy advice...sleep at the Main Street Station Hotel, gamble here, enjoy the bar, but pass on all food choices at this hotel. YOU HAVE CHOICES!"

Not a lot, but we venture out a lot and aren't usually in the Casino's until later in the evenings.  One of the must haves for me is their oyster shooters.  Nothing really special about them but they're a great price.  Plus they usually have 2 oysters per glass, better deal.  Oh, yah, don't forget the beer too.  If you have a meal book from the hotel they even cover some of the items they sell.\n\nWe went for happy hour one day when we were unloading all our shopping back at the room.  We decided to have some drinks and pupu.  We ordered their new flat bread pizza, deep fried calamari, spicy tuna maki roll, and their oyster shooters.  I had a Blackchip porter and my wife had a mojito.\n\nThe flat bread pizza was supposedly a new menu item.  It had good flavor but being a pizza lover I wished it had a more crispy crust.  Still, a good pizza.  Their deep fried calamari is really good.  Their batter is very light and very crispy.  Goes perfectly with their dipping sauce.  The spicy tuna roll was better than you'd expect from a bar in Vegas.  I've had better, but I'va also had worse.  The oyster were just as I remembered.  If you want to kick it up a notch you can also get it with a shot in each glass.  I passed.  I spiced it with a little of the calamari \"cocktail\" sauce, lemon, and tabasco.  I wished I had some Hawaiian chili pepper water from back home.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive.\n\nThe second visit was later at night--about 2 am.  They were still bustling.  I got their Red Ale this time.  I ordered the 24oz and the waitress told me she'd get me a 16oz as it was on special for $2.  That's good customer service.  We also got the calamari again and  their artichoke dip.  The artichoke dip was good.  Had a layer of cheese on it.  It was thinner than I was used to having but it came with chips and garlic bread.  It was really good spread on the bread.  The calamari wasn't as good this time.  The peices were bigger and their was a puddle of oil on the bottom of the basket.  A turn off for my wife.  Other than that, it was overall a really good experience still.  I kind of wish I got more oysters but it was only our late night snack before bed.\n\nNext time I'm back in Vegas, soon hopefully, you can be sure I'll be back here again.  Happy Eats!"

It tasted like right (must have been an old batch before the new guy came).  \nI ordered a burger and ate it at the bar and also ordered some korean tacos to-go. A few minutes went by and I noticed that the bartender quickly swap out my bill with a new one. I looked at it and he was charging me $2 because I was taking some food to-go. WTF? The bartender said he can't do anything about it and said he can get the manager. Yes, do that I requested.\nThe manager came out and I told him that I have been coming to 777 for 15 years and and this place has fell to $hit. I told him the food prices went up considerably and the quality has never got better. I also mentioned that the beer is not the same. He said its a different color but should taste the same. What?? This guy is clueless. Get a clue and rename your beers something else, and not try to pass off $hit as diamonds to your customers. \nI finally mentioned to him about nickel and dimeing me for $2 because I wanted to take an order home.

This particular travel, it was just me and my mister, so we were excited to give this place a try finally.\n\nWe visited the restaurant everyday during our stay at a near-by hotel.  Items we ordered during our many visits included, sushi, cheese burger w/blue cheese, chicken wings, a creamy chicken pasta dish, garlic bread, pepperoni pizza, strawberry short cake, and the main reason for our repeat visit is the root beer float!  \n\nMy mister and I did not like any of the foods, none of it! the creamy chicken pasta looked good, but it was sooo bland!, I gagged after my third scoop.  The pasta noodles was way over cooked, the sauce tasted like thick cream with no taste, hardly any chicken but they did give a lot which I wasted 90% of.   I've had better frozen pepperoni pizza and didn't care to the leftovers with us. The strawberry shortcake was huge, how can you go wrong with a ssc? Well, sadly, we didn't care for this either.  The cake portion tasted kind of weird, almost like a corn bread texture and look, but a bit sweeter.  I can't recall if the strawberry's were fresh or frozen?  Hardly ate any of it.   My mister ordered the sushi, and had a bad craving for sushi, ate a couple, and said he tasted better from Costco, pre-made sushi, sitting in the refrigerator.   Good thing we were using our meal coupons, so it didn't bother me too much.   BUT!!!, let me tell you! The ROOT BEER FLOAT, is the best I have ever tasted.  The vanilla ice cream is served in a chilled frosty tall mug, and the Henry Weinhard root beer is left in the bottle.  One serving of this delicious RBF is enough for both of us.  This is usually the only item that we have to pay for.  So refreshing, and satisfying, even on a cold winter night haha."

Not the usual \"lots of unnecessary lettuce filler with a small portion of steak.\"  Steak was delicious and a good size portion surrounded by freshly grilled vegetables on top of fresh greens.  The other selections in our group were a burger & fries, prime rib, stuffed pork chop, 2 beers and a glass if wine.  Satisfied customers all around."

The food was good considering the BBQ bacon cheese burger I ordered. It came with sweet potato fries and a special sauce (recommend) \n\nService was really fast and I wouldn't mind coming back!"

Many items on their menu are absolutely delicious and not only the prices are reasonable but they also are very generous with the portions of food.

When we arrived around 4:30 PM there were empty tables and open spots at the bar, yet the hostess was moving so slowly seating people that a line had built up at the entrance. The people in line waiting weren't even told that the bar was open seating so they could bypass the line if they chose to. Empty tables = lost sales; no excuse for that situation.\nOne of the reasons I chose this restaurant was the on site brewery, but when I opened the menu to the beer to see what local micro brews were available, I was told that they were out of three of their six options. The one I ordered tasted more like the ubiquitous coors lite than a craft brew.\nThe food came fast, and was about on par with the price; I will not be returning."

I don't recall the Happy Hour times, but that's when we try to go. Beer is brewed on site and cheap - although you can get it even cheaper at the casino bar (but they don't always have all of the varieties). CHEESY GARLIC BREAD is awesome and $4 or $5. Meatball sliders, and Honey Dijon wings are also great. I vaguely remember getting a sandwich once and I think it was good....darn microbrews.

So be prepared to wait a few minutes. \n\nThis place looks like someone built a brewery around a sports bar that happens to have a sushi station in it. Really need looking. Large televisions with sports or ESPN playing and giant beer tanks. Tons of tables and tons of noise. \n\nI ordered the chicken strip meal $10.99 and a water. Omg the water and soda cups are huge!!! I felt like I had just ordered a big gulp. Amazingly enough i ordered another water. The heat makes you thirsty. The chicken strips are huge you get three big strips that are about the size of half a chicken breast each. They are so juicy. I ordered ranch and honey mustard to dip. Stay away from the honey mustard it has a reddish-orange color and doesn't taste right. The ranch is good though! Also comes with fries, carrot and celery, and cole slaw. I thought the cole slaw was bland not enough dressing. The fries were perfect. All and all I would ask for extra ranch. So much food between the 8 of us!!! \n\nGood to order: chicken strip meal, fried calamari, bucket of shrimp, cheese bread. \n\nSteer clear of: Asian chicken salad! Salad lacks flavor."

The menu is a little ridiculous in that they have a large selection. It's safe to say that more is not always better when it comes to menu items. I think it takes away from the quality when there are so many items on hand. Narrow it down and you can focus on quality. example.... I had half dozen oysters on the half shell. They were large, didn't taste fresh and looked funky actually! Safe to say I didn't eat them all. Just didn't look or taste right. The burgers they had looked good.

If you're not in the mood for steaks or deep fried twinkies, this is probably your best bet! \n\nI came during happy hour and found the drink prices to be a steal ($2 for wine, well drinks, or a pint of their microbrewed stuff). The food stuff on happy hour is pretty weak. Most things are literally .50 off their regular price, and some only .25 off ! \n\nI tried the black cherry stout on my last visit . I adore fruit beers that are subtle and this one was awesome. Just that perfect amount of black cherry.. yumm! I paired my beer with some happy hour wings ($4.50), and found them to be just OK. I guess 12 wings for $4.50 is a decent price, but the wings weren't anything special. My friends got burgers and seemed relatively happy with them, but again, nothing special. \n\nI think what this place lacks in quality they at least make up for in variety. Everything from sushi to pizza to meatloaf... no wonder all the food is just mediocre!! \n\nI hate to say it, but if I had to compare this place to BJ's, I'd have to give BJ's the win. The food is better and the service is far better. That being said, when friends want to meet up for a dinner downtown, this is one of my favorite spots.

Kinda of a Gordin Biersch type of feel.  Huge breweries on one side and kitchen on the other.\n\nService:\nFor the most part the 6 times I've eaten here went problem free.

Beware of the weird hours.\n\nCost:\nPrices will run you around 7-11$ per person but overall its pretty cheap.  If you're getting sushi(in which I never have) each item will run you about 3-4$ which can easily get pricey. During happy hour(3-6pm M-F) they have a decent happy hour of $5 appetizers and better yet $2 beer & wines.  If you happen to be from Hawaii and are here with \"Vacations Hawaii\" then this restaurant participates in the food voucher program but your selection is kind of limited to mostly burgers and appetizers.\n\nFood:\nSo I've been here 6 times and for the most part I haven't been impressed.

In fact my last visit I ordered the meat loaf which was just plain horrible. The meat loaf came out as a white pre made patty(which I assume was frozen) and has the texture of tofu made product.  The gravy was your typical packaged powered gravy that you would buy for $0.75 in the store.  If you go here stick with a simple burger or the pizzas have looked good\n\nConclusion:\nTriple 7 looks the part of a good brewery restaurant but just doesn't cut it on the food end. I'm pretty sure they have the same chefs as the big buffet next door because the food seem to be mass produced and on the cheaper end.  If you need a place to watch a game or go for after hour then it's not bad but don't get your hopes up."

            "review": "I was really disappointed with our latest visit to Triple 7.  It had become a staple on our annual Vegas excursions, thanks to its casual atmosphere, friendly service, and good food for the price.  Unfortunately, our latest experience left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe food was a mixed review.  I thought the smothered potato chips were awesome (even though my bf didn't care for the white cheese sauce on them).  I can't believe that the Angus sliders were actually Angus -- they tasted like the meat from my grade school cafeteria, kind of spongy and weird.  Plus, it was odd that they only gave us toppings for two burgers (two pickle slices, two tomato slices, etc.) when there were three burgers.  The cup of chili was so tiny that we thought they brought us corn chips and dip by mistake, but to their credit, the chili was very tasty.  (We'd had the bowl of chili before -- it's a much better value for only a couple bucks more.)  The entrees tasted great and were plentiful servings, but my only gripe was that the ahi salad only had one small piece of avocado in the whole thing.\n\nThe main problem was the service.  We were seated promptly, but our server was obviously overwhelmed.  She was apologetic at first, and having worked in food service, I am generally sympathetic, but at points, our server was nowhere to be found.  Drinks came 15 minutes after our appetizers.  Tables around us turned over twice by the time it took to get our entrees.  We requested to-go containers at the time we got our entrees, having waited so long that we'd lost our appetites, and we waited another 15 minutes before I walked over to another server's station and asked for some.  I ended up walking up to someone who I think was the manager (who was dealing with another customer who had waited endlessly to order) to get the check.  Just inexcusably slow -- about 1.5 hours for just appetizers and entrees when we already knew what we wanted to order.\n\nI've had much better experiences here before, so I hope the most recent one was just the exception and not a trend.  I'd still give Triple 7 another shot the next time I'm in Vegas."

Let me tell you, it was an incredible dog, the meat was so smooth and rich, like a veal sausage and the chili had big pieces of steak in it.  The beer was also top notch.  They are a microbrewery and they know their stuff.  I have been a few times and have always gotten the beer sampler flight which is a good deal for the price and the amount of beer.  The High Roller beer that I had tasted almost of butterscotch, very unique and good.  On the other had the cherry beer tasted of cough syrup which was not so good.  The only thing keeping this place from getting a 5th star is that the service is not great and the food took quite some time to get to us.  However, for the quality and the price, this place is hard to beat in downtown Las Vegas."

Then there are other times you get a moody/bitchy server who seems to be having the worst day of her life. \n\nFOOD \nPhilly Cheese Steak? Meh. Flavor was non-existent\nChicken Breast Marsala? Chicken cooked with Marsala wine sauce. Meh.\nMonterey Chicken Sandwich? Chicken topped with Pepper jack cheese and avocado. Meh.\nFish and Chips? Seems to be the popular item here. Tartar sauce on the side was good but fish was so dry. Meh.\n\nI felt like leaving this place with all the disappointing food but then their old fashioned root beer float called my name. \n\nIt's a vanilla ice cream with Henry Weinhard's Old School Root Beer. Oh My God.  It's a simple, lovely delight. I've never been a fan of root beer float but wow. Where have you been all my life?

You know...the one where there is cheap shrimp cocktail, decent drinks, and service that makes you feel you are at a diner, yet not? Well those same emotions came to light at Triple 7 where I found the food comfortable, service just a tad lacking, and prices rather cheap.\n\nThe menu features an eclectic fare of American classics, sushi, and of course shellfish. Never thought I could get a prime rib at the same place I could get a California roll? In either case, the food wasn't bad but at the same time not great. It was decent. Nothing special. I found the oysters a tad gritty while the shrimp were on the smaller side. \n\nService was a little lacking. It took us awhile to get service once we were seated and while the food didn't take long to come, drinks went empty and it took awhile for water to refill. \n\nAmbiance is comfortable with a town tavern type of feel. Seating can be a little tight so you might not want to have what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas conversations. Prices are very reasonable with entrees being in the $10-15 range and they offer some cheap drink options including evening $2-5 beers.\n\nAll in all, it is decent. Nothing truly great, however at the same time didn't disappoint."

The restaurant itself is updated but still maintains a cozy feel with tall ceilings and a lot of wood and brick.\n\nThe micro brews are surprisingly good. I don't mean to hate on Vegas beers, but when a restaurant offers a flight of five 5 oz pours for $5.99, you prepare for the worst. My flight came in a wooden holster and contained four of the regular beers and one seasonal flavor. I can honestly say that they were all very good.\n\nThe food is typical bar fare with a lot of burgers in the $7 to $8 range. Nothing is great but the prices are fantastic, so I'm not complaining. \n\nAs you might expect, the main draw of Triple 7 is the craft beer. If you go, definitely focus on the drinks and limit the amount of food."

Brad is an awesome bartender and I really commend his patience dealing with the people he gets at late night hours. \n\nBut I do have a few problems with the joint. First off, I've been charged 3 different prices for the same 16 oz beers, which makes recommending this place difficult. I was telling my friend Main Street has $1.75 beers, because I was charged that before. The next time was 2-something and the next time was $3.50 a piece. Very confusing. \n\nAlso, being a restaurant that is in a hotel and doesn't offer room service, I find it very ridiculous they charge 2 dollars for every to go order. Since I know this, I usually order my food, eat a morsel and immediately ask for a box. Seems less efficient for them, considering now they have to clean my plates, and my seating area just because I was avoiding a $2 charge. It's not that I don't want to pay 2 bucks, but I think whoever is serving me deserves that $2 tip, not the restaurant. \n\n Also, they will not take an order over the phone so you can pick it up. Not even for hotel guests, not even with the $2 charge. It is inconvenient and I'm sure has lost them plenty of money, as they just lost my business for dinner this afternoon."

The last thing we need in our quest to get rid of our beer guts is a place that serves great beer and good food 24 hours a day. I've noticed some comment that the beer here is watery, but I've noticed that about all the Las Vegas micro brews I've had. I guess when you're in the desert, you just aren't in the mood for a heavy, particle filled beer. \n\nThe bartender was really friendly and was patient with my friends who could not decide what they wanted. I went with the mango cream ale since I had heard a few people say it was really good. My friends both gave up trying to decide and went with samplers. I didn't know the samplers also included their seasonal brew (the mango cream ale) or else I would have gotten one as well. I enjoyed the ale a lot. The mango cream flavors were subtle. My friends both really like the Royal Red. One little quirk about the bar (or maybe it was just our bartender), but they could not take the tips while we were still there. He just left them on the bar even after we told him the money was for him.\n\nThere are no gaming machines at the bar, a rarity for a casino bar. If you'd like to get comp beers for playing, there is a bar in the casino that has all their beers on tap. You can also order their beers from any cocktail waitresses. That works out great since I do enjoy gaming, but I do still like to go into the brewpub once in awhile and pay for my beer (it is less than $4 for the large) so I can take in the atmosphere. The old school wooden bar is a nice place to hang out with friends. There is also a sushi and oyster bar during certain hours."

This place has a large, open, airy atmosphere with glassed in areas so you can see the brewery. Their prices are much better than the typical gouging you get on the strip.\n\nThe Good:\nI loved their sirloin and black bean chili. The meat was tender, flavorful, and a refreshing change from the typical ground beef you find in chili. I like chili and this is one of the better versions of this dish I've had.\n   The Grilled Orange Roughy was nicely seasoned, without detracting from the flavor of the fish. The portion was good if not overly generous.\n   I'm a bit of a cheesecake snob so I wasn't sure about trying their deep fried cheesecake. Fortunately I decided to give it a shot. This was surprisingly good! They take a slice and cover it with a sugar tempura batter, then fry it. I suspect the cheesecake is either frozen or partially frozen before they fry it since the center was VERY cold, although not quite frozen. The crust is crisp and crunchy, giving the cheesecake a very different texture than I'm accustomed to. The flavor of the cheesecake itself was very good too, rich, smooth, and creamy.\n   I also tired the beer sampler which was a great way to try all the micro brews they had available. You get 5 5oz glasses for $6. All the beers were solid offerings, good and nicely balanced flavors. Despite this, there were no unique standouts that made me sit up and say wow. If you like your IPA's SUPER hoppy you'll be disappointed. Instead they went for a more tempered, balanced approach, which I certainly appreciated since I'm not an IPA fan.\n\nThe Bad:\nOne of the sides I got with the orange roughy was rice and that's all it was, just white rice. They made no attempt to season it or do anything to it, just a pile of white rice. With all the other flavors going on everywhere else I thought this was a glaring omission. It was also something I didn't order, but I'll get to that next.\n\nThe Indifferent:\nThe service was pretty good overall. Most of the time my waitress checked back regularly but there were a couple times where she seemed to disappear for a while (and they weren't particularly busy). The main reason I'm putting the service here is because she got my order wrong. The fish was supposed to come with the vegetable of the day and choice of potato. I chose mashed potato and got plain white rice. If the overall service had been just a little poorer I would have put it in the bad instead of indifferent."

Greedy me hopes that not too many people find out about this place....horrible I am!!! D=\n\nFirst off, the parking can't get any better. This restaurant is located inside Main Street Station Casino and the Main Street parking structure is never overcrowded, and it's like 20 yards from the casino entrance. No hassle parking always makes for a happy camper, especially with how Vegas has become so commercialized and BIG. You can't go anywhere without parking a million miles away from where you are trying to get to.\n\nNext, they have tons of beers that are actually brewed here, so you can get some very chilled, fresh brewed beer. I suggest that you start off with a super tall beer before you order. Most are pretty potent so you will be fairly lit before your food comes.\n\nThe food is great and the variety is quite interesting. They have sashimi and assorted sushi which has been really fresh and well prepared every time I have ordered it, and the prices are very reasonable. The sandwiches, burgers, and other entrees are also good and consistently prepared. I haven't had anything that I didn't like here, let's put it that way.\n\nOh yeah and have another beer with your food...don't forget about that. Why get half intoxicated when you can go all the way!!!\n\nThe service is excellent with a super friendly staff, and normally there isn't much of a wait, if at all. When you are done, there is a skywalk across to California Casino, and Binions and Fremont are just across the street. Golden Nugget is barely a block away. Good spots for some action wtihout all the hassle of the Strip....well unless you like the hassle. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't, but it's nice to have a choice.\n\nIf you play enough at Main Street you'll get comped here at 777, so even better, your beers and meal will be free-e-e-e-e!!!! So hit the tables and the machines next time you are here and then grub down on some great food!!!"

This time was no different, but our wait was only about 20 minutes. \n\nThe menu is quite large with a wide range of items ranging from fish and chips, to a wide range of sandwiches including reuben, philly cheese steaks and even pizza. I went with a reuben, well because it is my favorite sandwich in the world. It was quite a let down. The meat itself was still a little cold, and everything else was pretty dry. Nothing to rave about, but I've had worst reubens.\n\nOthers in my group had chicken tenders, pizza and fish and chips. It is pretty hard to ruin any of those dishes so everything was alright. I did not get an opportunity to try any of their micro brews, but will do if I ever find myself back at Triple 7."

We didn't have any beer, so this review is just for the food and service. \n\nNothing really special about it, except the dessert... the deep fried cheesecake. \n\nIt was good, but not good enough to plan an exciting adventure to this dessert, (check out some of my other reviews, I've had a few adventures ;) ) \n\nService was ok.  Food was bleh-ok. So-so. \n\nThe waitress we had seemed to be waiting on ALL the other tables on our side of the restaurant. It wasn't packed, but it wasn't empty. There were two waitresses working during a Saturday lunch time. I can see why it wasn't packed. We didn't get any rude service, but didn't get any great service. She didn't check on us enough to be qualified as great-excellent service. Other than taking our order & giving us the check, she checked on us maybe... twice. She seemed like she was just there. Just there for work. Sorry, that won't score you a good tip. \n\nWe ordered calamari, the fries, a few dishes, some sushi, and the cheesecake. All of it was okay so-so. \n\nNothing great about the calamari or fries, fries came with a few dipping sauces. The seasoning on the fries seem to separate from the fries. That doesn't make the fries tasty. The calamari was so-so as well.\n\nNo one at our table really liked the dish they got. It was all just okay. Nothing bad. Just so-so quality. I got the fried sushi roll, there was nothing tasty about it. I've had fried rolls before (at breweries/bar type places) and they were delicious. So I was disappointed with this one. I've been to other non-Japanese or non-Asian breweries and bar type places that have good sushi. \n\nOther dishes we ordered were philly cheesesteak it was okay. My brother barely ate half of it. My other brother ordered fish and vegetables, he said it was bland. He only took a few bites and didn't eat the rest. And they usually eat a lot! \n\nWe ordered the caterpillar roll, but the waitress gave us a california roll and charged us for caterpillar roll. (it's a few dollars more than a california roll.) \n\nShe apologized for it, and changed our bill, but again... she just seemed like she didn't care to serve us (or maybe be at that job.) Who knows... \n\nThe fried cheesecake was good, my first time trying it, so I'm glad that was more than okay. But it was just good, not great. Maybe that's also because of the disappointing service and all the other food we had while there. \n\nNo one really enjoyed their food, so we probably won't be here again. \n\nIf I ever go there again, I'm gonna have to try the mango brew.  They didn't offer us any beer menus so how was I suppose to know?"

So when a bartender at a brewery kiosk in the Planet Hollywood mall referred us here, it stuck out, and we decided to pile in the car and make the trip; while we could expense crappy food all we needed, deep down, it wasn't what we were craving.\n\nNaturally, particularly for my colleagues not so experienced in Vegas, the step off the strip into downtown is a fun one.  You get the proper desperate-folks-in-a-smoky-hole vibe that is so missed these days.  Main Street Station, where the Triple 7 is located, is no exception.\n\nThe brewpub is by far the nicest part of it.  Old-fashioned looking without looking yellowed.  Enough plasma screens to remind you that the 80's have long passed.  Clean, but comfortable and lived-in.\n\nThe beers are solid, with the pale ale truly outstanding--they have GABF banners on the walls from years past and it's not a stretch to see why.  The waitstaff knows enough about the food and the beer, to boot.\n\nThere's the cheap-steak option which i'm told was pretty good, but i went for beer-battered chicken fingers with beer barbecue, which was awesome.  It's all very plainly made with some care, and delicious.\n\nIf you don't mind marinating in some extra-thick smoke to get there, it is absolutely worth the short drive to downtown to get some real food and real beer."

We just crossed a bridge that connected to Main Street Station hotel -- very convenient because it was too hot to walk or drive outside.  \n\nThis place has a bar and grill type feel to it.  In fact, you can see the microbrewery in the restaurant.  My brother claims that their beer has slightly more alcohol than regular beer.  He got their beer sampler for $5.99, which got him surprisingly buzzed, along with an order of nachos.  I ordered a teriyaki burger and the crab & artichoke dip.  My sister-in-law ordered buffalo wings and an italian sausage pizza.  My sister-in-law's cousin ordered the philly cheesesteak.  \n\nLittle by little, the food came out and I was surprised at how big the portions were.  I truly didn't expect it from the prices whatsoever.  It was to the point where we contemplated on switching to a bigger table to have more space for all the plates.  The service was okay, though our server wasn't anywhere to be found when we needed her, but she was nice.  \n\nThe crab & artichoke dip was great.  I didn't really taste the crab but it was super cheesy and it came with chips and garlic bread.  The buffalo wings were decent.  The italian sausage pizza was pretty decent also.  I love that they don't skimp on the cheese, whether it be on the nachos, my dip, or the pizza!  The teriyaki burger was nothing special.  I told the waitress I wanted it medium well but it seemed like I got it well done because it was dry.  \n\nOverall, this is a great place to hit up for appetizers and beer.

The pizza and pizza crust is great, but stay away from the 4 cheese pizza ONLY because it has WAY too much cheese.  If you're into that, then it might be pure ecstasy.

The stout and porter tasted generic, and the red was just okay, but the Double IPA and the Pale Ale were quite nice and tasted as good as any other mass-produced brand.  It was hoppy, bitter, and tasty.\n\nThe prices are ridiculous as well.  For $4 you get a 16oz pour, or for $4.50 you get a 22oz.  Or, you can get a 5, 5oz sampler for $6.  Then to match they have a Happy Hour to knock those prices down even further.\n\nIt's located right downtown and is within walking distance to the Fremont strip.

To top it off I had to wait 10+ minutes staring down the barkeep to close out the check. I get that he's busy and not his fault but it just added to the frustration. Anyhow never thought spending 10 bucks plus tax would make me feel so ripped off but it did."

Fries were ordered for the table. They were delicious, both the sweet potato and regular fries were golden, crispy and hot. I tasted someone's onion rings which were very good. \n\nOne of the dipping sauces served with the fries was a sweet sauce that is a cross between BBQ sauce and ketchup. It was the best part of my meal! Some in our party ordered cups of chili. Their cup size is very large.\n\nI ordered the fish tacos. Big mistake!  The fish was on a nondescript, limp flour tortilla, on a few pieces of shredded, wilted lettuce. I wonder who told the chef that wasabi should go on fish tacos? The fish, although battered and fried adequately, was unseasoned. I thought maybe they didn't season it because it was on a fish taco so I tried someone's fish from their fish and chips order. That fish was also unseasoned and tasteless. \n\nAlso the staff seemed to be having problems taking our orders in a timely manner. There were 8 in our party and it was a bit difficult flagging down waitresses and getting our drinks. They weren't even very busy that day. Prices are reasonable."

I've eaten at the Main Street Station buffet many times and found it be one of the better budget friendly buffets out there. Unfortunately my experience at this venue was a far cry from it's dining counterpart at the Main Street Station.\n\nWe had a big party, 7 people, all hungry. It was Friday, so we expected a wait and were surprised when we were able to get a table quickly. The waitress was great. It took a little time to get our initial drink order, after that the service was flawless. Refills given before your mouth felt like the Sahara Desert, plates cleared quickly, and a friendly smile to go along with the prompt service. Too bad for her, the food the kitchen was putting out was sub-par.\n\nSo I ordered their classic cheeseburger, added avocado, and substituted onion rings for french fries. When the food came out the onion rings were barely above room temperature. They were soggy and literally had no flavor. Having had the misfortune in my youth of working as a dish washer at a restaurant I know a little about frying foods. This consistency only happens when something is fried, cooled, then fried again. No bueno. After a complaint to the waitress she brought a big stack of new onion rings to the table as several of us had ordered them. These were fresh and crispy. The burger itself was ordinary. Cooked okay, no great flavor, definitely expect more from a brewery. Everyone at the table at their meal, but no rave reviews. Prices are okay, definitely lower than the strip.\n\nFortunately this place is located near Fremont Street where I can drink my sorrows away and get some $1 fried twinkies."

I already had my order planned and ready before I arrived.\n\nGuacamole Burger with Sweet Potato Fries- 3.5-stars- I ordered this one cooked to medium. At first, I couldn't find the guacamole, but it was under the cheese packed in tight. So it wasn't as gooey or squishy as I had first anticipated. The burger itself was quite juicy, and had a hint of salt which stood out. There is also a lot of olives between the meat and cheese as well. Between the tomato and lettuce was some surprisingly fresh red onions--it definitely hits you fast. I'm usually a fan of caramelized onions on my burgers. The sweet potato fries were average, yet crispy and delicious, as fries should be.\n\nCrab and Artichoke Dip- 3.5-stars- The crab flavor hits immediately, and you can tell this is soaked with crab. The amount of oil was a bit off-putting for me, since it made me feel sluggish and tired. Little balls I thought were potatoes, my mother confirmed was indeed artichoke hearts. This is served with tortilla chips and flat bread. I would go with the bread to slather on the dip. Otherwise, your chips will crack under the hefty weight!\n\nLoco Moco- 3-stars- I ended my trip the way I started, at the Triple Seven Microbrewery, as I waited for our shuttle to arrive. I ordered it medium rare, as I like to have some blood in the morning--I also hear, I sparkle in the sunlight. Either way, this one comes with a thick brown gravy, which seemed a good fit, but the flavor was overpowering. A mix of salty and robust, it overwhelmed the other ingredients. The egg, I ordered sunny-side-up. The burger was just a burger at this rate. Served hot enough, my tongue was a little singed for a day. The plate was definitely filling, but not too exciting over-all.\n\nBlackchip Porter- 4.5-stars- I'm a lover of dark beers. I love the deep woodsy flavor which washes around in your mouth. This porter also has an earthy, chocolate flavor when you drink it. Served with a thick lather of froth on top. Definitely a beer worth trying.\n\nAtmosphere- They really keep the look of the train station here. Huge glass windows show off their giant microbrewery, housing all their different beers. The wide open-space takes away from the look of a bar, which would be great for a place like this, and makes way for an almost family dining environment. Tons of tables and seats, rarely filled--since the next-door Garden Court attracts the big eaters. There is a lot which could be done with this place, and it's not out of reach either.\n\nService- Service is decently fast, with a touch of Aloha--since this is a very local hotel the way it's run. The meals were delivered quickly, and there are television screens all around to watch the games and sports-reels.\n\nConclusion- A good place when you're not feeling the buffet. The hours are pretty generous from 11 a.m. to 7 a.m., definitely a place to stop when you want a drink and something to eat after long hours of 20x odds on craps, slots, or blackjack tables. Also, it's so close to the wifi zone, you can get good reception while you eat and drink. The Downtown area of Vegas has a different feel to it, and this place fits right in."

Overall, bland...I wouldn't suggest ordering it.  However, if you do...it tasted better on the garlic bread so skip the tortilla chips.  We also split the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It was okay but I think it needed to be cooked a little longer.  If it would've had a nice crisp, browning to the cheese and crust it would've been 5 stars.  However, it came out looking a little undercooked so I would only give it about a 2-3 stars.\n\nWe ordered the 5 beer sampler.

I drink water with my meal and not once while eating did a server come by to refill my water.  I also could have used more butter for my baked potato but overall the waitress seemed to be a bit overloaded with work.\n\nI ordered the NY Strip with a baked potato.  The baked potato was as generic as can be and I don't think there is any point in going deeper into that (you receive a sour cream packet to squeeze onto the potato).  The NY Strip was fine.  I had no issues with it really.  The price is nice and the quality was similar to what one should expect when buying a steak under $20.  My friend ordered a t-bone, medium-rare (same as mine) and his came out very under-cooked.  The outside looked normal but the inside of his t-bone was VERY red and bloody.

Last time I ordered the nachos which were awesome. And they have countless TVs, so catching a game here while sipping a microbrew is ideal."

Saw an ad in the paper stating happy hour 3-6 pm with $2 beers and wine and 1/2 price appetizers so we were skeptic but it turned out to be for real.  Great tasting micro beers to start and then we had 2 glasses of wine with our appetizers. We got there at 5:15 so we had to rush our drinking and appetizer ordering but our waitress was cool and worked with us to make sure we got our orders in by 6 pm.  1/2 price appetizers includes a bucket of peel/eat shrimp, large basket of calamari, cheesy garlic bread (looked like a pizza), large quesadilla and dozen chicken wings (w/Thai sauce).  Service was great and the atmosphere was relaxing.  Our bill for 4 with 4 beers, 8 glasses of wine and all the above appetizers, came to $40.  UNREAL!...and the food was quality, not high volume fast food stuff.  I will definitely go back (next time at 3 pm) and recommend this to anyone going to Vegas."

A huge delay in getting a seated and you could see the servers were clearly overwhelmed and which I do understand but it's not really our problem they refused to hire extra staff.  Upon getting seated it was at least another 15 just to get an order in. When we finally got our food vegetables had clearly been frozen and were  still almost cold,  meat was not cooked correctly and just all-around a dismal experience. Go else where."

It's like a pub meets sushi bar meets, well, Vegas. Brick walls, plenty of seating, big tall ceilings and yes, a sushi bar with a big neon sign behind it. \n\nIf you're coming in for the first time, order a tour of microbrews, the sampler is only $5.99. \nDo you like mango? Try the mango hefeweizen. Light in flavour, it goes down easily... too easily. You'll want more! For something a little different, the King's Kolsch is a lemongrass beer surprise! It seems to be an up and coming flavour in everything from beers to vodkas. I'd ask for a sample sip before you order... just to make sure you can handle an entire pint of it.\n\nIf you're hungry, might I suggest the Korean short ribs and Korean tacos? I know, weird to have a Korean influence in a microbrewery right? Not any more odd than a sushi and oyster bar. Anyway, both are delicious and both come with a side order of cucumber kimchi. The short ribs were saucy and delightful, though my server, Monique had a description that gave them way more justice than I ever could. The tacos came in a half soft, half crunchy shell and had that same bite. After those and my tour of beer, I was so very full!\n\nTip: If you're going to order some sushi, you won't be able to do it right from the sushi bar. You'll still need to go through your server! Just roll with it... \n\nBonus: No smoking allowed inside the pub. You can escape the smell!"

However if you are ok with sitting at the bar you don't have to wait & can still order from the regular menu.\n\nFood quality is pretty good. Ahi salad is a nice, light option if you don't want to feel stuffed. The Mediterranean chicken Salad is one of my favorites. Light, tasty & just the right amount of tartness in the dressing. My boyfriend loves their burgers, all of them. Burger fans should give it a try. Can't go wrong with the Flat bread pizzas & regular pizzas. Crust is thin & crunchy, perfect pairing with beer.\n\nThey offer take out orders but be aware that they charge a $2 service fee & the order must be placed at the restaurant; no phone orders.\n\nLast tip, if you are a Boyd Rewards member & have a ton of points on your card, you can use the points to pay for your meals here! Just ask your server to check. If you use points they don't charge tax, either. It's a nice feeling to be fed for free after dropping too much money in the casino, haha."

Some of them were quite bland, but the black mud was a kick in the pants -- the kind of kick you want to start off your Fremont Street Experience.\n\nIf you are a fan of glorified yellow water (Bud/Miller/Coors), go home.  If you care about calories, you wouldn't be drinking beer in the first place (a 50 calorie beer is... well... water).  If you prefer taste and quality, grab yourself a Black Mud.

Triple 7 took two of my favorite styles and made a memorable brew with a perfectly balanced level of tartness. And their other seasonal, a hoppy wheat brew, was also excellent.\n\nOn my last visit I heard great things about their sushi. You wouldn't expect sushi from a casino to be good, but the downtown casinos have a high volume of Hawaiian and Asian patrons, especially Triple 7 and the adjoining California. So this time I ordered a nigiri sampler and it was beautiful. The hamachi and ahi were outstanding, and all of the pieces were HUGE. \n\nI can't imagine a future Vegas vacation without a stop at Triple 7.

Things were looking good so far as my friend and I made our way past the low limit tables and surly old gamblers toward the brewery. We were there on a Saturday night and the place wasn't all that busy. We decided to sit at the bar for dinner; easier access to the brews was my logic.\n\nThe selection is what you expect from any brew pub...a blonde, a brunette, a red head; yes I'm talking beer still. The entrees are subpar to say the least. The steak was not seasoned and the pork chop was very thin and tough; sawing through that was quite a feat. \n\nBartender service; and I use that term very loosely:  very poor. 3 bartenders, 8 patrons at the bar including us. It took 10+ mins to be greeted and when we were it was not friendly at all. The bartender had to go back and forth between us and his POS for each item we ordered.  Really, you can't remember 2 simple orders for gods sake? How about a pen and paper to make up for your lack of memory or listening skills?  They never once checked on us during our meal. Was it because they knew the repsonse already? They never once offered us another beer.  Let's do some basic math for those following along; usually the higher the bill the higher the tip, no?  Finally, we are presented with the bill...finally we can leave and forget about the poor excuse for a bartender. Have you ever seen this?  Now he hovers in front of us waiting for us to tip/total and sign. Haha the joke is on you; you can stare us down all you want. You see, we don't like math either and the bill total plus ZERO tip is easy math. Get a clue...or better yet, a job that doesn't require customer interaction, common sense or the listening skills that even a 6 year old can handle.  One day, I'm going to see this guy standing on Fremont begging for money...yes, I will chuckle to myself, maybe a little out loud too. \n\n100% service fail leads to 1 star; your mediocre food and decent atmosphere is worth 2 stars but your staff brings you down to the lowest rating allowed by Yelp. I don't make the rules here; if I did you'd receive 0 stars."

Darn it.   We decided to head over to the Triple 7 inside of the Main Street Station because the word was they had dessert.  \n\nWhen we arrived the hostess seemed put out by our party of 10 and said she would have to look for a table.  We glanced to our left and saw a long table with 12 seats and asked if we could sit there.  She said we could but if there were ten of us we'd have to all be on one check.  It seriously felt like she wanted us to leave.  We sat.\n\nA server finally came by and got our drink orders and then after a while another server came by and told us she was back from break and could take our food orders.... drinks had yet to arrive.  I was very thirsty and asked if I could get a glass of water (which I had already ordered).  She told me the other server was placing that order. Soon after, the drinks did get delivered by server number two, however she started at the opposite end from me even though I was the one who asked.\n\nA little longer wait and then the food arrived.  I had decided to get mozzarella sticks instead of dessert as nothing on the dessert menu sounded like all that.  When she delivered mine, I realized there were no set ups on the table, so I asked if I could get some napkins.  The server told me she'd get us silverware once she was done delivering food.  She finished delivering, went and got silverware and passed out one roll to each person... me last.  Then she walked away and came back with extra napkins which she dropped off at the other end of the table.  I was totally feeling invisible.\n\nThe mozarrella sticks were not that great.  hard and rubbery instead of melty and I shared them...  when I aksed for the bill, she dropped it off at the other end of the table, too.  So bizarre.\n\nOverall, I had a good time with good company, but that was despite the service."

I very rarely go for traditional dinner in Vegas, so trips to The Chart House, Vic & Anthony's or Hugo's Cellar kind of go out the window.  Aside from that, I just don't want to spend a fortune on a meal when I'm going to spend the balance of my evening gambling, drinking, and wandering around Fremont St.  \n\nI usually wander over to the Triple 7 between 12 AM to 3 AM, and no matter what I've ordered, I've never had a bad meal there.  That's telling for me, because usually a place will have a few duds, and you just have to learn what not to order.  Trust me when I say the Triple 7 always delivers good food.  I read other reviews refer to this place as a gem, and they are correct.  It's what you want when you look to a meal you can enjoy at any hour.\n\nSome of my \"Must Try\" recommendations are the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich, Triple 7 Wings (when you're taking down a few of their Triple 7 Brews), Monterey Chicken Sandwich, Fish & Chips, or my drunken go to: Baked Italian Sub.  \n\nLook, I could go on and on, if you're looking for a solid meal and you're downtown, this is by far the best place to eat at. Give it a shot...."

I am not a drinker in the slightest sense (even though I do occasionally 'Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol') but Triple 7's award winning brews are top notch!  Some of the best hand crafted beers you'll find in all of Las Vegas!  Seriously!  Yes...in lil' old Main Street Station casino!  Haaaawaaaiian!  Cheeeeee Pono!  And yes, yes my friends...you will see many island people in the middle of winter dressed in t-shirt, shorts, and rubber slippers.  Tips:  \"Howzit brah\" means 'hello', and \"Brok' da mouth ONO\" means 'yummy'.  Local speak!\n\nWant to experience good drink and food on the cheap-cheap?  Go to Triple 7 during their popular HAPPY HOUR!  Going from 3 PM - 6 PM M-F (except holidays and Monday Night Football) you can get wine and well drinks for $2.00, or a 16 oz. microbrew beer for $2.00 too!  That's a lot of brew for a little buck!  It is a great time to try each of their five or six brews they have on tap.  My favs are:\n\n-High Roller Gold (their flagship wheat beer)\n-Marker Pale Ale (light and bitter with a clean finish)\n-Black Cherry Stout (seasonal, with hints of chocolate and cherry)\n\nBut trust me, each of their beers are phenomenal and go great with their menu.  On the Happy Hour menu for $4.50 you can have your choice of items that include a dozen chicken wings, 20 peel-n-eat shrimp, fried calamari, and a California Roll.  So cheap and so good!\n\nAnd don't forget their regular lunch and dinner menu!  Triple 7's Legendary Garlic Fries ($3.95) are very good, and so are their Nachos Grande w/ Chicken ($8.95).  Share with some friends!  They also do soups, salads, pizzas, sandwiches, and burgers.  I really enjoy their Teriyaki Burger ($7.95) and their Mushroom Burger ($7.95).  For you non meat eaters, with their burgers you can substitute a grilled chicken breast for no extra charge!  \n\nTriple 7 also has Brewmaster's Favorites and Dinner Specials on their menu.  The Fish and Chips ($9.95) are battered in their own Marker Pale Ale then deep fried.  Excellent with a brew to wash it down.  Also popular is their 1/2 pound Prime Rib dinner ($8.95) with veggies and a baked potato.  Go meat!\n\nSo if you're down on your luck at the craps table or that slot machine (Damn you Wizard of Oz!  Damn you!), that leftover scratch you got will get you a cool brew and some warm eats to drown away those sorrows.  Lost Wages, anyone?  Get down to the Triple 7 to get your pub grub on!"

I got a half dozen oysters on the half shell while I waited for 3 PM.  The bartender was awesome.  The oysters were huge!\n\nA little before 3, he hooked me up with a 16 oz mango hef and told me he would add it on the bill at 3 for the $2.  Normal prices are 16 oz for $3.26 and 23 oz for $3.95, so during HH you can get 32 oz for $4, a good deal.  Lots of brewmaster's specials, but I only wanted the mango and one was enough to get me a bit tipsy.  To counter that, I ordered the Thai chili wings (1 dozen for $4.50 during HH) and chatted up a random Vegas-defect who was at the bar.  The wings were crispy, hot, and delicious.  \n\nThe restaurant is really large and the bar area is too.  The TVs are large and flatscreen.

Left VERY happy and VERY satisfied (and drrrrunk!) customers!\n\nBrother and I managed to try a few beers:\nThe guest brew -- mango cream ale.  Surprisingly refreshing, not sweet at all like you would think.\nThe brewmaster's special -- Weisenbock (sp?).  STRONG!  Quite good and got even better when it warmed up a bit...  Just a bit.\nThe red.  A lot less...  reddish? than I expected.  I liked it a lot but it was a bit anticlimactic after the Weisenbock.  Good 'tweener though (between strong beers).\nThe pale.  AWESOME!!!  Definitely would be my go-to beer if I hung out here more (and believe me, both my brother and I for sure will be back)!\n\nThe food was delicious and came out piping hot for every order we got.  Cheesy bread was great -- a number of different cheeses make their way onto that goodness.  Garlic fries were crunchy on the outside, nice and fry-esque on the inside, LOTS of garlic = LOTS of delicious!  My brother ordered the oysters topped with the crab and artichoke dip...  Oh.  My.  SOOOOO GOOD!!!  Dip wasn't overwhelming or overly rich, and whatever brine the oysters are in accentuates them perfectly.  Plus there was a soft toasted garlic bread that sopped all this amazingness up!\n\nBut the crowning jewel in our visit here was my order:  OYSTER SHOOTERS (with vodka -- you get a choice of vodka or tequila).  Just an explosion, literally, of flavors in your mouth...  We like to put Tabasco and a lil dash of black pepper in ours, and it tastes absolutely yummy.  I don't even like Bloody Marys that much...  But these came out SO GOOD and SO CHEAP at that!!!\n\nFriends, Yelpers, beer lovers -- lend me your stomachs (and livers).  DROP BY TRIPLE 7!!!  Prices are right, grub is great, alcohol is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  Everyone will find something they love here, I guarantee it :)"

The sirloin steak I ordered was delicious and cooked perfectly. It came with very good green beans and a baked potato. It was also a good size for $15.99. \n\nWe also ordered raw oysters on the half shell that were pretty good (not as flavorful as the oysters in the South) and came with the usual horseradish, lemons, hot sauce, etc on the side. Six oysters for $9.99. =)\n\nOur waitress didn't see us seated in her section for quite a while, which was getting frustrating, but we were seated in the corner out of view. Once she noticed us, she immediately made up for it with a very friendly personality and she made sure to get our food out to us very quickly, despite a packed restaurant.

Well I finally made it and after I tried some of their food and beer, I wanted to stay longer and try more beer if I didn't have a previous appointment to make.  The bartender and staff were pretty friendly albeit in the afternoon hours, it was pretty dead in there.  They have happy hour specials but the prices here are pretty cheap for beers and food alike.  I got an order of potstickers and a big 24 oz beer for under $10!  I mean, that's at regular price so happy hour will even be lower than that!\n\nThis place isn't the prettiest or newest place to drink beer in the town but the value can't be beat.  Main St Station seems to be getting the shaft compared to the California across the street is super full of people in their restaurants.  I love Hawaiian food but I love beer more!!\n\nIf I'm walking by this area of Fremont and Main again, then I'll make sure to stop by in here for a blonde ale!"

There are around 10 flat screens around the entire resto which means that you can watch your favorite sports game from any spot. Secondly, they have a flight of their signature beers ( Five 5 oz glasses) for $5.99!\n\nI've come here many times and have tried the following: triple 7 wings (honey-dijon), caesars salad, cheezy garlic bread, black angus sliders, fried calamari, hot crab and artichoke dip, french onion soup, chicken ciabatta sandwich, korean tacos, blackened salmon, bbq ribs, ribeye steak, prime rib, and....yeah i think thats it.\n\nMy go to dish is the blackened salmon served with a pineapple chutney, fresh veges, and rice. I love the spicy and sweet combination of the dish. My wife loves their honey dijon chicken wings. I always bring visitors here bc the food here is a good mix of american comfort food with some asian influence. The only things I would say that are not so good is that the crab and artichoke dip had imitation crab and the chicken ciabatta sandwich had a little too much bell pepper. They have lunch specials of which their rotisserie chicken was moist and tasted way better than the chicken you buy in sam's club. Love this place....oh ya, did i mention that you can use your aloha coupon book here and they have happy hour specials too?"

Though Sin City might indeed be the creator of many sinful provocations and temptations, \"humble\" isn't a word that comes to mind readily. However, visiting the little brother of The Strip and spending time in Downtown Las Vegas had the benefit of finding a nook, a corner to sit in where the smoke of cigarettes and waves of slot machines faded to a hum. Brick walls and copper colored beer vats instead took place and slowly, it's easy to phase into a history mixed with old speakeasies and modern day breweries like BJ's. Triple 7 Restaurant & Microbrewery welcomed everyone back to the brewing days.\n\nDeco: 4 stars\n\nThe interior is surprisingly large. Although located inside Main Street Casino, walking in felt like you were inside one half of a giant brewery, waiting to be explored like an adult in Willy Wonka's beer factory. Large copper vats can be seen and old saloon ceiling fans churned the atmosphere. Flat screen TVs showcased the latest in sports and a huge open dining floor with no partitions to be seen showcased the large space available for accommodation. There is no glitz and glamour of a showgirl here. Simply the girl-next-door humble look we all learn to love one day at a time.\n\nService: 3 stars\n\nThe service was friendly, almost down right Southern. The server was pleasant, introducing the different specials of the day as well as the selection of beers that are brewed within the very walls you find yourself. However, as tantalizing as the descriptions for food and drink might have been, it was a bit slow. Hopefully you are in no hurry.\n\nFood & Drink: 4 stars\n\nThe great thing about a simple place is they give you simple, delicious food in large quantity. Sure, this isn't Bouchon or Mesa Grill but it doesn't have to be. There is no need for comparison because the food tastes great for what it is: traditional American cuisine made with good ingredients and lots of generosity in portion sizes. The burgers are juicy with crunchy, savory breads. The fries are crisp with a texture perfect for sauces. The salads are huge and filling for vegetarian and omnivores alike. Come hungry and you'll leave full. Come famished and you'll leave satisfied.\n\nAnd because they brew and create their own hoppy libations on site, you as a diner have the pleasure to sample and indulge on truly unique beers you can only find here. The porter was delicious with that oaky, smokey, caramel aftertaste after each sip. The amber ale was as golden as a Swede's hair in summer. Plus like every brewery, there are flights to be had and spirits to enjoy. If for nothing else, you should come for the beer.\n\nPrice: 4 stars\n\nThe price might not be the cheapest in the land, hovering around the same price you would pay at a Hoff's Hut or BJ's, but you get so much for your money. It never feels like you've been cheated out of your money or you made a gamble by coming here, which is a great feeling considering all the dangerous that your wallet will face before or after dining here. Instead, just like the food, you feel satisfied.\n\nConclusion\n\nMany people won't know about this wonderful brewery. Even more people will find it hard to believe you. But once you come here and truly experience what a gem this place really is, you'll be wondering why you never came before. From the artisan beers to the tranquility within the storm of chaos all around, Triple 7 Restaurant is truly unique and worth experiencing. You'll make a lot of bad choices during your stay in Sin City. You should at least try to make a good one by dining here."

During happy hour I believe the beers cost $2.50. I think I paid about $4.00 dollars. What the heck? That is super cheap for a craft beer! \n\nThe food is good; we tried the sweet potatoes fries, garlic fries and Buffalo wings. Everything was super tasty, particularly the garlic fries and the wings. It is bar food though, so I would stick with burgers and appetizers. \n\nI will be back real soon and will make the most of the happy hour. \nOn a side note, the casino is rather charming, in an old, western kind of way."

Gotta give props for the Mango Hef of course since this is a brewery at heart. Burger looked normal and steak sandwich seemed quite fatty and the 4th person ordered a ribeye, which looked like she was struggling to find some meat on the steak at times. All of those dishes were forgetable, but my $8.99 pepperoni pizza was the best of the bunch. Eight very large slices (I only finsihed half) so this is shareable. They do use two kinds of cheeses, so if your a purist, then maybe just ask for mozzarella. But the crust was excellent and this qualifies as a safe choice if you find yourself eating here. Would go back for pizza and beer anytime."

This time around we had a great server one night that was attentive and caring even though she had a ton of tables. We received plenty of refills and our burgers were delicious as always. The micro brews are still we'll priced and delicious. Here's where they lost two stars...We also visited late one night during our trip and it was an awful experience. Our server only came by once and never refilled our drinks. My wife ordered Alfredo pasta, when it came the chicken was rubbery and inedible. The server was bothered by my wife's request to send it back, only after waiting 15 minutes for her to come back to tell her the chicken was bad. I noticed that there are a lot more loud and annoying yuppies that frequent this place now, not as fun as when I started dining here 4 years ago. Lets get more Hawaiians in here again, they are always friendly and respectful. If I wasn't loyal to Boyd I probably wouldn't return after this bad experience."

Then I ate and drank to my heart's content and paid pocket change for the experience.\n\nThe space is rather large and there are two bars flanking either side of the dining room.  The brewing equipment is prominently positioned on two levels along the back of the restaurant.  It's a nice, open space and I felt very comfortable.\n\nThe bartender/server who attended to me was efficient if a bit abrupt.  That's okay--he's a bartender, not a waiter.  I prefer brusqueness to plodding service at the bar.  He wasn't chatty but he answered all of my questions and was quick with the refills.\n\nThe beer was fantastic and cheap.  I especially enjoyed the porter and the seasonal Oktoberfest.  Each style was well represented, which in my experience is rare in brewpubs.  There was a high level of consistency.  Plus, you could drink here all night and pay the tab with whatever's leftover from your taxi fare downtown.\n\nFor dinner I ordered a burger and fries, and they were acceptable.  The burger was cooked a bit longer than I would have liked but it tasted just fine.  I noticed that they also had a sushi bar adjacent to the regular bar.  That was unexpected and seemed a bit out of place in a brewpub, but hey!  Maybe some people like sushi with their microbrews and fried mozzarella sticks.  I didn't try any.\n\nI left about an hour and a half later having consumed a burger, fries and four beers.  The total tab was less than $20.  What a great value.  If this place were located near my home I'd rarely eat or drink anywhere else."

I'm playing blackjack.\" Well, one day the blackjack dollars ran out a bit too quickly, so off to Triple 7 we went. And we were pretty famished (and sober) when we arrived, so we went to town on that menu...Meatball sliders, garlic fries, nachos grande, Prime Rib ($10!!), and, of course the microbrew sampler - you get five 5oz pours for $5. Can't beat that!\n\nWhen the food starting arriving all six of us got a look of dread in our eyes, thinking, \"Dear lord, what have we done?\" If Vegas is about excess, than we sure as hell were doing something right, because this was a MASSIVE amount of food...and mostly pretty damn cheap and amazingly tasty too. \n\nThe beer? Ah, the beer. It's so good when it hits your lips. It really is. The Porter was my fave, but the night we went there was also a brewmaster's special that had upwards of 9% abv...I think that was the one that really did me in.

The Meatball Sliders are amazing. 3 sliders on a warm bun, smothered in a rich and tangy sauce and dripping with melted cheesy goodness. The fries are crispy and salty the way a fry should be. The wings are awesome. I prefer them extra well done. Nothing worse then biting a wing and the damn thing is bloody. We been there so many times, i can go on and on about the food. The beer is incredible. They take time and pride in their batches. Barleys Beer is ok but pales in consideration. Chicago Brewing company comes in 2nd to Triple 7 Brew. They have their signature beers and tend to add 1-3 new flavors monthly-Bi Monthly. The Black Cherry Cream is awesome. You can taste the Cherry and so smooth. The higher content beers like Monique can put a spin to your dome when you drink a couple lol. When your done grubbing, head over to the bar in the casino. You can get a pint of Micro Brew for $1.75.

Some of you probably can guess why one was chosen if you have been reading my reviews of the past month. That though is only half the story and I will tell the full spectrum of that story at a later time.\nWe chose Triple 7 simply because they had a good overall score here on Yelp! They also had brews that I haven't heard of before. Like a Watermelon Hefeweizen! Well by the time we got there they didn't have the Watermelon Hefe anymore but they did have a Mango Hefe which I immediately ordered! This unusual Hefe went down smooth and tasted awesome. But only one beer allowed for this bird!\nThe food at Triple 7 I could have take it or leave it. It is funny. Many people often say how good casino food is and how cheap it is. On this trip at least not so much. The food is mid priced I would say and often times is sub par to a regular restaurant outside The Strip. \nI ordered a Taco Salad here and it tasted fresh enough but also seemed uninspired and didn't really have the TLC needed to make it a good dish. The guacamole also tasted a bit odd. \nIf Triple 7 didn't have such good beer I would not have been so generous on the star giving. The food didn't impress me and was one of my least favorite meals. But not the beer. Ho no!"

If you're a beer person, it should be on your short list of places to visit when in Vegas. What better excuse to drink than \"you can only have it here\"? \n\nI sampled the strongly recommended black cherry stout, and it was complex with some coffee notes. Nothing weak about it, and you can definitely taste the cherry. Deliciously intoxicating. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how clean and non-smoky the entire Main Street Casino was, and Triple 7 is spacious with super tall ceilings, which is such a refreshing change from the dark cavernous video poker establishments that dot every corner. \n\nService was fine. The food was average, plenty of fried, meaty items. I had the grilled vegetable sandwich, and it was acceptable. Their salad was a below average iceberg creation, so it's not really worth the extra bucks. Just accept you're going to be eating french fries if you head this way. Remember: you're going for the beer."

The food was pretty good we had burgers and a philly cheese steak sandwich.But the thing that brought me back was the DEEP FRIED MUSHROOMS... That was ono (good) it came with ranch dressing. Perfect fior a group of 3 or 4 to share. A lot of shrooms.....The waitress are friendly and attentive."

But the drinks and food are AWESOME so don't let the crappy service get in the way of an AWESOME experience.\n\nI came here 3 times in the 5 days that I was staying in Vegas.  (Ya, it's that good)  I was a little disappointed that the garlic fries no longer use fresh garlic, but like a bottled costco type of minced garlic.  The fried mushroom app is another tasty one.  And how can you go wrong with 40 pieces of peel-and-eat shrimp cocktail for 12.95$!!!!  I ate the filet mignon steak sandwich and added jalapenos to it.  YUM SCRUM!!!  I also tried the nachos which is like an entree itself not an appetizer, and the wild mushroom pizza is also gooood.\n\nAnother awesome thing about 777 is that they brew their own beer.  I had a beer sampler (five 5-oz samples of all their microbrews: gold, pale, special, red, dark)  The gold and red beers were awesome!  Definite yummy.  \n\nI didn't bother to try the sushi so I can't really say anything about that."

I was tired of spending so much money on watered down alcohol, that I decided to go to Downtown Las Vegas! \n\nBy the end of the night, I got 6 drinks that totaled up to $35 with tip included. Wait, wait? It's true. With drinks only about $5 a pop, there's no way you can say no to them. And they're not your small drinks either. They're regular sized drinks that you can similarly enjoy at the Strip. No, I didn't drink all of it! Of course, this was all dispersed at my party. \n\nSit at the bar, and the host doesn't need to tend you. When we went that Sunday night, it was pretty empty so we were served very quickly. The staff's service was average, but there was some highlighting points where they made us laugh. I wish we had stayed longer, but we had tourists with us that wanted to take advantage of the glittering lights outside. \n\nThis is a must try guys! And I heard it was even cheaper during happy hour so make sure to take advantage of that too!"

He ordered a larger cut, so it was like ~$14 maybe (?) and scarfed it down.  I tried a bite and agreed that it was very tender and juicy.  Worth it.\n\nI had the mahi dish.  Unfortunately the vegetable side is just one kind of veggie, and it happened to be grean beans.  I only like green beans if they are really fresh and these seemed a little wilted, so I didn't eat many.  Also, it came with a huge serving of white rice (seriously like two gigantic ice cream scoop-sized mounds), most of which I didn't eat either.  So I felt a little badly wasting the food.  If I'd known, I would have requested less rice and a side salad instead, or something.  Anyway.  Then the fish itself was overcooked and kind of dry.  I don't mind it being on the more well done side of things, but overcooked is going too far.  The only redeeming quality of the meal was the amazing pineapple salsa chutney sauce...I just slathered every bite of fish with the sauce and it made everything better!  Delish.\n\nWe loved the beer sampler (6 samples for $5.50!!  so cheap!).  I enjoyed the mango beer (although bf thought it was too sweet).  I also really liked the porter.  Bf liked the red and the pale ale.  So it was a perfect balance for the meal.\n\nThe atmosphere was like any brewery/restaurant..think Gordon Biersch.  But it was pleasant inside, lots of TVs, and the service was pretty good.\n\nWe'd definitely go back, and I would just order something different...probably sticking with the more traditional \"bar food\" or just getting a prime rib of my own. :)"

There are a lot of TV screens set up for sports and I was placed perfectly to watch two NBA playoffs games simultaneously. I thought it was interesting that there was a sushi bar in a section of the brewpub. I guess Main Street Station is trying to make the most use of its space. \n\nIf you're into craft beers and/or are looking for an alternative to sportsbook seating, I think you'll find the Triple 7 Brewpub to be a good choice while downtown."

Had read about 777 and decided to try it since the west tower where I was staying at the California is about a 3 minute walk away. I enjoyed the bar so much that I ate every meal during my stay there. Yeah, sounds lame but I don't give a shit, the place was nice and it was too damn hot to be strolling around. The microbrews were about a 3/5. The two I was looking forward to were out but oh well. They had a pale ale called Marker that I settled in on. While in vegas I only eat during happy hour(s) which is 3p-6p and  after midnight. The beers are $2 during HH. The food was 4.5/5..I had (not all at once) wings, nacho supreme, meatlovers flatbread pizza, broiled chicken sandwhich and a pepper crusted ribeye (medium). Man, that damn ribeye was delicious, came with a baked potato and greens for $15.99. When I stayed on the strip last year with friends, I payed $50 for a Ribeye at some place in Ceasars that couldn't touch this one. All in all this place was real chill, the bartenders were by in large real cool, some came off strange ( and stressed) but that's common, and I never had a problem getting a bar stool during HH. I think California Hotel and 777 will be my new set when in vegas solo for fights."

The menu is expansive and I think that the kitchen is running by the \"Jack of all trades, master of none\" mantra. I decided the San Fransisco Burger was the safest bet after some considerable consideration. \n\nA Beef Patty is Charbroiled and then mated with Swiss, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Lettuce, a house sauce and toasted Sourdough. They nailed the temperature and all of the ingredients were of good if not great quality. With that said, it was a little boring if not an all out yawn. A mediocre burger in a fun environment nets a 3 star review all day, everyday."

When it was our turn, party of 7, triple 7 said the same thing. Our tables were next to each other but still didn't allow it us to put the tables together or closer to each other.  There are bar top seating also that should accommodate large groups if open.\n\nThey brew some really good beer which gives them some originality. There's also a sushi bar, weird because it gives you that typical bar feel but with sushi. Haven't tried the sushi, can't imagine it being any good but I wont know until I try them.\n\nFood wasn't that bad but it didn't stand out as amazing. There was a chicken caesar salad which had too much cilantro. The prime rib plate came with choice of sides.  The prime rib was big but not the best cut of prime rib I've had.  There was a bunch of tough fatty pieces that was chewy. The bake potato was small and not so attractive and only came with packet sour cream and butter.\n\nThey also had a BBQ chicken breast and half rack of ribs combo.  Very delicious only suggestion is having the BBQ sauce on the side because it was spicy instead of sweet which they didn't mention.\n\nI had their beers a long time ago. Can't judge them on it cause it was a long time ago and forget how it was. But local so that's a plus.\n\nLarge dining area, lots of seats and tv around so it doesn't fill crammed.

We hung out at the bar and spilled into the high top area. Within about 30 minutes we were scolded by Loetta that we need to close our tab at the bar and open one with the server if we wanted to sit at the empty high-top tables near the bar. While she said this, 4 of us at the table had empty beers. We waited 15 minutes for a server to come to ask us for our order, never did. \n\nSo I found Loetta and said we were all waiting for the server to come. She said 'you have to close your tab at the bar before you can order with us.\" I told her the bar tab was my bosses, we'll open another. She rolled her eyes and said she would send over a sever. The server did not seem happy to be serving us, despite demanding to serve us. Not very much later, Loetta told our group to move our bags that were taking up a table (please keep in mind there were about 10 empty tables in the surrounding area, probably 20 empty in the restaurant). In addition, multiple people from our party made different comments about how rude she was. \n\nThe only reason I give this place two stars was because not all of the servers were rude, and the food/beer was not bad. It's just a shame how one person can poison a whole experience and ruin surrounding attitudes. I will not go back if I can help it."
