This is our second time here and it's the best we've had here in Las Vegas so far.  \n\nMy wife, bro in law and myself got here about half hour early and they received us with open arms.  They made us feel like old friends.  I had the Eggplant DiAmore, bro in law Shrimp Fetuccini and my wife, good grief, turkey dinner.  And all was delish.  Bottle of red wine, raviolis and mini Osso Bucco.  Molto buona!  Topped off with a canoli and coffee.   Not kidding, this has to be one of the best places to have dinner.  It was our 22nd wedding anniversary and they had the gentleman singing during dinner sing for us.  And guess what?   He sang our wedding song!  What a fabulous evening.  \n\nCasa Di Amore, you are on top of our list in Las Vegas.  Congrats to you and your fabulous staff."

I've heard so many great things about the place, so I was super excited!\n\nWe were seated & served immediately by a super charming man (whose name currently slips my mind, sorry!) and the food was fantastic! I highly recommend their calamari & the jumbo ravioli entree."

I ordered the Lobster Ravioli which was quite nice and my friend ordered a steak, which he raved about.  The live music adds just the right mood, with the swooning sounds of Sinatra and a couple bottles of Chianti, who wouldn't feel amorous at the House of Love?"

            "review": "A hidden gem off the Vegas strip. First off, the service is incredible! Everyone was super friendly and appeared to be helping each other out to serve food, refill drinks and clear tables. Even with that, it was still clear who our waitress was and she was super attentive to our needs and was very knowledgeable about the menu and daily specials. I believe her name was Joanne, so kudos to her! She's awesome! The food is here is amazing! I tried the ravioli, but based on the menu, I don't think you can order something \"not good\" here. The cocktails are also well-made and they certainly don't short you on the liquor. Even the pre-dinner bread is good! :) The manager was present the entire evening and was talking with folks as well as stopping at tables to check on people. He was very nice and welcoming. The live music is also a great bonus to this place! I will absolutely be back here and rant and rave to anyone traveling to Vegas to dine here. As another reviewer said, it is worth the drive from the strip (I believe they also do transportation, but call ahead!) and you should not leave Vegas without dining here. I second that!"

She was very helpful, professional, and accomodating to last minute changes.  They sent two limos to pick us up.  This was really nice!  The drivers were very friendly.\nThe restaurant is very old school east coast Italian. There was a singer...and he made the restaurant feel very intimate. \nThe food was great! The antipasti was really delicious and I was very pleased with the veal piccata. The service was especially wonderful! The wine was flowing...we didn't need to ask for anything!  They were so on top of it!  Brad was especially great!!!  He took extra steps to make sure we were all happy!\nThanks for such a great experience...we will come back on our next trip to Vegas!  We will recommend this place to our friends and family."

The ravioli's reminded me of the ones we used to have in Brooklyn - the sauce was fresh, fantastic and not sweet...which is how most American's mess it up.  The baked clams reminded me of the ones we used to have on Christmas Eve and the chicken special my boyfriend ordered with a pesto cream on top was to die for. Old-school, Vegas atmosphere as great as the food.  Will definitely be back with family and friends for many years to come!"

My steak was absolutely phenomenal - perfectly prepared and served with a delicious peppery sauce. My fiance's linguine and clams was also very good. We had the tiramisu for dessert - delicious. Adding to the great food was the attentive service, unique atmosphere and very enjoyable live music. I would absolutely go back here on our next trip to Vegas and highly recommend it for anyone looking to get off the strip and enjoy a more local dining experience."

The food (dinner AND dessert) and the prices didn't put me over the moon, but the service and ambiance were awesome!  Old style Vegas with live music (we were there too early to enjoy the live entertainment; it started shortly before we left).  Our reservation was for 5pm and we walked up to the door to find it locked at 4:55pm.  They should open a little bit earlier for their first reservations.  We would have enjoyed a drink before going to our table.  Everyone raves about the free limo ride, which we passed up because we live in Henderson.  Overall it was a nice experience, but one that I'll only have once as a local."

            "review": "When Ruben and I get together with one of our group of friends (dubbed the \"Eight-some\"), someone else always plans the dinner, so we are just along for the ride. We came here last Friday night and definitely needed that reservation. The restaurant is small and there's practically no waiting area/lobby, so the hostess stand is very crowded. Our table was in the middle of the restaurant, right next to the bar, kitchen, and two-man band. Luckily, the booth seat is tall, so our view of the bar and kitchen were blocked.\n\nEveryone enjoyed the complimentary bread and particularly the garlic butter that accompanied it. Ruben and I shared the Fried Calamari ($16) served with marinara and a side Caesar Salad ($3 with entree). Ruben ordered Pasta Alla Forno ($30) created with penne, chicken, shrimp, broccoli, and mushrooms in a light pink sauce, then baked in the oven with fresh mozzarella. While I had their Baked Lasagna ($21) filled with marinara, fresh ricotta, ground beef, Italian seasonings, and melted mozzarella. The calamari was good (didn't make my top 5 though) and I liked their marinara. The Pasta Alla Forno was very delicious! Great flavor and the shrimp was especially good. Although, very expensive for a dish of pasta. The lasagna was all right, borderline meh.  Way too much cheese and not enough sauce. It was really difficult for me to eat (I ate less than half). One of our friends ordered Tiramisu and I thought it was decent.\n\nThe band was really great! Very talented gentleman and I loved the music they played. The only thing was that with our big group, we couldn't talk to each other much since one end of the table was directly next to the band. Service was really great. Everyone was great, nice, and attentive. The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere and exemplifies \"Old School Vegas.\" It's definitely a cool spot to check out. As far as Italian food goes, it was just okay and not worth the cost.\n\nFYI: Great for families - we had an 8-month old with us and it wasn't too loud or rowdy for her. Also, the automatic gratuity is 20% for groups of 6 or more."

First they offer free limo service from your hotel you just have to call ahead of time and reserve it, then when you walk into the place it is like stepping back in time The service was great and the food was tremendous. I got the Scallops Florentine, One of my sons got the twin fillet mignon, and my other son got steak flamb\u00e9. We all got the Caesar salad to go with that and everybody loved their meals. To top it off they have live entertainment with just a variety of old music and it appears they take requests. We figured this restaurant had been around since the 60s but found out it's only been around for about 13 years you wouldn't know it and it was just like old Vegas."

We took a cab (didn't know about the complimentary limo service!) and I started to wonder where the hell we were going- it was a 20.00 cab ride from the strip.  When we finally got there, the cabbie said we shouldn't have a problem getting back because the machine gun range next door was very popular with the tourists...\n\nWe walked in and were promptly seated by the hostess, who told us that the musician was taking a break but would be back soon (singing keyboard player who interacted w/willing dinner guests). Our server was extremely helpful and luckily, we were there on 1/2 priced wine night (Sun and Mon) so we got an excellent Chianti.  \n\nWe started off w/the calamari, which was wonderful and there was a ton of it!  It was very crisp and had a lovely marinara sauce.  I had the 'grandma's' soup, which was delicious- chicken noodle-y and very flavorful.  I was in the mood for red sauce, so the server recommended a sausage pasta dish that was normally served w/a pink sauce, but said he'd make it w/red (amazing!!!)  My husband had a strip steak which was served w/a twice baked potato and veggie...all good. \n\nWhen it was time for desert, we declined- but our server said we had to try the cannoli and we'd get a t-shirt...I'm a sucker for a free t, so we got it to go.  \nThe server told us about the limo service and said that the driver was off because nothing had been scheduled- but that his manager was more than happy to take us to our hotel.  We took him up on the offer and rode back to the strip in style. \n \nI'd recommend this restaurant to anyone, in fact, I gave away the card our server gave us w/his name on it (Christopher?) to another trade show attendee.  Sorry that I can't give his name, because he was great!\n\nLater, while walking down the strip, we passed a particularly hungry looking homeless guy.  I asked if he was hungry, he said he was starving...I offered him our leftovers.  He happily took them and was very grateful.  About 3 minutes later, I realized I'd given away my souvenir t-shirt, but I bet he needed it more than I did."

The crowd was very loud and boisterous, enhancing the old italian family dining experience.

I don't understand; it was bizarre). I took a bite and called them back. There was very little sauce so I at first asked for more sauce, thinking maybe that would help. NO.

And charge $22.50... What????? The server and the manager dealt with the situation professionally and promptly so this review is not for them. They gave me a spaghetti meatball instead and gave me a canolli on the house. The canolli was great, but the dish they gave me was also sub par (waay too salt and i'm a salt addict)... not what you expect for $22.50 LOL!!! This review is for the cook: you need to re learn proper food handling/ safety because the 2 bites of your dogfood spagetti meatsauce MADE ME SICK. I will spare you the details. I cannot even wrap my mind around the ridiculous $22.50 price. How long was that sitting there???? Was that an old dish that was sitting there that you tried to get rid of? How old was the sauce and was it kept at the proper temp? There's no way. Would you serve that to your friends or family???? Would you pay $22.50 for that dish???? How would you feel if you were sick from eating it? Would you be pissed enough to write a one star Yelp review? Seriously, relearn proper food handling/ safety skills. If the health department came in there and saw you serving that, you would be shut down."

The limo driver even asked if we would like to come earlier and was waiting outside the hotel for us. When we arrived, the place was packed, there was a singer and a Sax player, both very good. Our waiter was the best and even took our picture for us. I ordered the mojito, super good and not overpowering. I had the penne a la vodka in a giant bowl. I couldn't eat even half of it. Halfway into our dinner, everyone was singing \"That's Amore\" with the singer. I love this place because it isn't pretentious like the restaurants you find on the strip. I even got a shirt that says \"We have medical marinara\" I'm really happy we chose this place for our anniversary dinner!"

The atmosphere is perfect off-strip Vegas: it simulates some other time & place, but does it so authentically that you'd almost think that this is what a Northeast Corridor Italian restaurant is still like. Which is to say: the locals nay not even fully realize how impossible it is to find a joint like this in the rest of the US anymore. Mostly, it's the most enjoyable restaurant experience I've ever had in Las Vegas."

            "review": "This is a great restaurant in a random location. Hint: You can request free limo service from anywhere on the Strip. It's quite small, so definitely make a reservation.\n\nThe ambiance and decor are the true draw of this spot. It's very old school Vegas. There are old school pictures of Vegas and various celebrities all around the restaurant and bar.\n\nAt the rear of the restaurant is the bar. There's video poker, of course. Hint: If waiting at the bar for a table to be ready, they cannot transfer your drink bill to your table, so you must pay the bartender before being seated at your table. There are several cocktails and a few wines by the glass. The wine menu was a little underwhelming.\n\nDespite trying to be more upscale and fancy-ish, this is a rather casual spot. There were kids running around and lots of folks in jeans and sweatshirts.\n\nThe live music is a great touch and adds to the ambiance and decor. However, it also escalates the noise level. Between the band and the patrons, we couldn't even hear each other - and we were at a tiny two person table. Hint: Request a booth on the far side from the band. There's some seriously awful acoustics in this place. The noise level and the inability to carry on a conversation with your date really kills the romance.\n\nFor food, we opted for a side caesar salad, the bone-in ribeye steak flambe and the gypsy pasta. The food portions are pretty generous. The salad was nothing of note. Hint: While there's free bread, they don't give you olive oil and balsamic vinegar, just butter. The steak was tasty, but not mouthwatering or crave-worthy. The gypsy pasta was crazy spicy - and I love spicy. It was almost too much it was so spicy. And the pastas are 1 lb, so it was a significantly large portion.\n\nThe service was nice and friendly. Our waters were never empty, we were checked on, etc., etc.\n\nAll in all, I like the concept, which is what gives it the 4 stars. And I'd be willing to come back, perhaps on a less busy night, and try some other menu items. But I didn't love what we ordered and the noise level seriously dampened our experience. While a good spot if you're looking for a vintage Vegas vibe, If you're looking for a nice, romantic restaurant, this is not that spot. But totally good for experiencing that old school Vegas feel."

Wine glasses were never empty, his menu selections were spot on, and we felt like we were family. The bus boy was like a thief in the night.... We never knew he was there but somehow our water was always filled and our empty plates mysteriously disappeared from the table. Food was delicious. Calamari was lightly breaded and crispy. My eggplant was stuffed with cheese and spinach and still managed to stay firm. Hubby had cannelloni with ground veal that melted in your mouth. A word to the wise, they are closed on Tuesdays and MAKE A RESERVATION! We happened to walk in on a Monday night and there was one open table. ONE! There is a small bar area with a few open  2 person booths. Just goes to show how amazing this place is that a Monday is standing room only."

Our waitress was a quick-wristed, Italian woman called Guiseppe. Masoli organized the dinner, so he put a lot of pressure on everyone at the table to order foods that rhyme with his name. Unfortunately, this limited us to ravioli and cannolis. The live music was incredible, although some of the lyrics were a little bit different from what I remembered (e.g. \"when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie that's Masoli\"). The women there were much nicer than most women. Instead of getting angry when I asked them questions on their way to the bathroom, they just ignored me. Guiseppe gave me a cannoli even though I didn't order one. In Italy, this means a woman is in love with you. \"Cannoli\" literally translates to \"little tube\". The suggestion was obvious; she wanted a little tube in return. I decided I couldn't reciprocate the gesture when I saw Guiseppe offering cannolis to literally everyone. Casa di Amore:  Masoli, ravioli, cannoli"

But after we were seated, boy was I charmed by this place.\n\nThere's live entertainment on the weekends (not sure about other times) and that man can sing! He knows how to work up the crowd and get people dancing. It's just a feel good environment and everyone makes you feel like family in there. \n\nFirst time I came, there were 3 of us and we decided to share everything we ordered: the antipasto sampler, eggplant di amore, gnocchi alla prosciutto, and their special of the night which was a herb chicken with pasta. The food was nothing short of amazing, except for the gnocci. It was too rich for my liking. Cheese sauce plus the gnocchi, which are just potato dumplings, was just too much. But other than that, food was pretty great.\n\nSecond time, my bf and I started off with their fabulous garlic loaf. When they say fabulous, they mean FABULOUS. It was stuffed with garlicky cheese and just hot out of the oven. Delizioso! Then we had the twice wrapped prawns which had a tasty sweet walnut sauce. It was pretty good but I'd say it could use less filo dough and more prosciutto and cheese. Still not bad though. Lastly, we had the fettuccine alla pappasito and that was excellent. The sausage was spiced perfectly and there was a large helping of them. Also, usually if you split an entree, they'll charge $5, but our waiter just brought out an extra plate for us to split it at the table so the $5 charge was waived. Super nice of him!\n\nThis place has been fun times each time I came and I think there will be many more visits here. Good food, live entertainment, great restaurant!"

About 30 minutes later they called us to a table, which seemed quite reasonable given the crowd.\n\nOur server was friendly and prompt, and the food was great. We all thought the live music was a plus - more interesting than canned music, but at a volume where we could still talk.

And boy, did Casa di Amore deliver! It looked & felt like old Vegas, during the Rat Pack days.  The d\u00e9cor, the entertainment, the 'feel'; it has it all.  An added bonus was it was half-price wine Monday.  ALL bottled wines are half price!  \n\nThe service was above & beyond from our waitress, Lynn.  She let us taste a couple of wines before buying. (She also let me try the gnocchi before I ordered but asked me not to tell so this is our little secret.)  Hubby had the rib eye with cabernet demi-glaze & peppercorn sauce. It was cooked to perfection. I had the gnocchi florentine with prosciutto in a white wine cream sauce. Lynn said we can request any ingredients be added or removed so I added saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.  M-M-M!  Desert was a wonderful tiramisu.\n\nThe live entertainment was a two-man combo, keyboard & drums. They looked like they could have played the Sands or the Stardust way back when.

Atmosphere is very old school with posters of Vegas as it used to be. The dining room feels a bit cramped and service can be slow. The bar at the back diminishes the place a little, because its appearance and the crowd it attracts remind one of a sleazy dive from the 70's. \n\nSinger/keyboard player Doug and 83-year-old violinist Bill entertained on Sunday night and were excellent - both very talented guys and not too loud.\n\nThe biggest drawback for tourists is that it is located a good long way from the Strip.

It's a little loud with the music so not ideal for a quiet dinner but you can get a table further away from the stage if you make a reservation."

The food is very good, the place is loud, talking is very hard,  They have some great live music, so just be prepared to have some good food and very little conversation.  The only disappointment was the 'Fabulous Garlic Loaf', man, my mother could kick the crap out of that.  I was expecting this great Italian bread loaded with garlic and butter and baked to perfection, what I got was a hot loaf of bread and some garlic butter...really, for $5?  You guys should re-think this.  But, the place is always full and the food is good and the staff is AWESOME!  I will be back."

Is there something shameful about a veal parm? Not in my book, and not in Bourdain's either.\n\nOld school, dark walls, candles on the table. I also had the pleasure of watching the Godfather on AMC's mob week before I went here, so it was awesome seeing pictures of old Vegas like the Sands with Dino and Frankie on the marquee. They send a limo to pick you up, and all you have to do is tip the driver. \n\nOnto the food! Well first the wine. Their wine list was surprisingly pricey, but the cheap 30 dollar chianti was a solid pick. The bread was uninspired, the butter clearly pre-frozen. I ordered the pork chop saltimbucca, half order, because TWO 8oz pork chops is a little too much. It was pretty good, a little salty. My friends ordered lasagna, fettuccine, eggplant parm. I tried all of them, and while it's nice to have these italian american classics around, I could have made these at home for half the price, easy. However, it's a solid place and I liked that it was off the strip and not touristy as hell."

Make sure that you ask for the complimentary limo service when you call to make your reservations.  The limo picked us up from our hotel and took us to a non-descript brick building.  The moment the big heavy door opened for us to walk into the restaurant, you could smell the delicious Italian food and hear the sounds of a two-man band singing classic Italian love songs.  We were in love from the get-go!  There were old photos of the original hotels on the strip and infamous Vegas icons on the walls.  The food was good, not necessarily outstanding, but good.  It was worth the price.  They also had their wines at 50% off for the bottle, which made it totally worth it.  Afterwards, our limo driver actually took us downtown to Fremont Street so that we could enjoy that experience and then we cabbed it back to our hotel on the strip.  It was a good time."

He was early and it was perfect because we were hungry, free limo ride was awesome.  The place is cute, decor was inviting and i liked the setup. Four of us came her to check out the place (first timer's) was thinking of maybe booking it for a dinner reception after our wedding next year. We all shared two entree's (cus it was pretty late to be eating Italian food) and two side salads and bread. The lasagna was really yummy, we ordered some chicken dish i cant remember the name but none of us cared for it the chicken was a little dry, but the pasta it was served with was good.  The entertainment was alright not as exiting as all the other yelp'ers made it come across. Maybe we came too late?? Anyways we will be back, but i don't think we will be booking our dinner reception here afterall, only because it is away from the Strip and i think i would prefer more of a banquet hall facility."

So I'm just going to discuss it point by point:\n\nThe limo to the restaurant is awesome! The really nice driver picked us up in front of TI and drove us to the restaurant and back. He was really patient. At the end of the night, he had another party to pick up but was really nice about getting us to make up our minds whether we wanted to go or wait until he came back.\n\nThe server was awesome! He was super sweet and really helpful when my sister and I couldn't figure out what wine we wanted. I also kept running to the bar area to watch the SC game at one point after ordering a new bottle and he brought my glass to me at the bar. Sweet! :o)\n\nThe bar area has the standard bar/pub feel. TVs everywhere you turn. The bartender is really nice even though she was a fan of either Ohio or Oregon, I forget. Well, either way, she was not a fan of SC. :oP\n\nThere is a guy who plays piano and sings all songs Dean Martin/Frank Sinatra-esque. Gives the entire place an old school Vegas feel.\n\nAll in all, I had an awesome time there. The antipasti were delicious. The wine was fabulous. The game was SHWEET (though unrelated to the restaurant but it just added to my terrific experience because SC won WOOHOO!!!) :o)"

I didn't realize I never wrote you a review until my mother-in-law talked about how she's coming back and I had to look you guys up again.\n\nOn to my review...\n\nI am anti-weddings or should I say I'm anti the weddings *I've* attended. The weddings I've been to in the last few years have been kinda mehh. The consistent theme that I've noticed is that the food is never really that wonderful, which sucks because that's the most costly part. When it came down to planning my whole shebang, I didn't want to throw a $20,000 wedding for 175 people with crappy food. Plus ever since Britney Spears got married in Vegas, I've always had this crazy idea in my head that I should get married there too. So, that's what we did. Our plan: to have a 15 minute ceremony that would have the best damn wedding food and greatest party you've ever experienced. Casa di Amore helped make my big night absolutely flawless. \n\nWe had originally planned for a Brazilian steakhouse that our chapel could package with our overall wedding. The chapel screwed up and forgot to make the reservation with the steakhouse. By the time they noticed their error, they told me the place was booked up. The problem with having your wedding on a hella cool date like 9-10-11 is that everyone  ELSE wants that hella cool date too. We called a bunch of different places on the strip including Maggianos and no dice. My mom, of all people, actually found Casa di Amore and told me to call them. Immediately after speaking with Kathleen, I knew that this was going to be a perfect fit for my wedding. She was absolutely one of the best people that I dealt with throughout my wedding process. She gave me their traditional catering menus but said if we saw something else on the menu we liked, they could change it and edit it. \n\nThe food: we had 30 guests and everyone raved about the food (my dad's review is even on here...look for Russ C.) My husband's family is all 100% Italian, so I was hoping this would live up to their expectation and it did. They all were so impressed by the antipasto platter that we had served as an appetizer and said \"Wow, this place is authentic.\"\n\nAnd yeah, I'm pretty darn competitive so to hear my dad and step-mom tell me the food was WAY better at our wedding than at my step-brothers, well that was one of my proudest moments of 2011. \n\nThe service: our waiters were great, very attentive and personable. They were happy to make wine and champagne suggestions but didn't try to push anything extra on us.\n\nThe $$$: Kathleen only made us pay a small deposit of $100 to reserve the space for us. She followed up with us throughout the whole process but sent us another follow-up email the day before just to make sure we were still good to go and that we didn't want to change anything. We thought the prices were extremely fair in comparison to how much food and how amazing it was.\n\nAmbiance: so fun! There was a lounge singer there that night and my guests loved it. We got a free show while we ate.\n\nIf anyone is thinking of doing a dinner here, I would highly recommend it. The process is easy and Kathleen will put your mind at ease. OR if you've been there, done that on the whole wedding thing and are just thinking about a nice date, doooo it! It's great to get away from the strip and experience a little old Vegas. They also have limos that will come pick you up as long as you make a reservation and call in advance."

(And it's in Vegas!!!)\n\nWhen you first find the place, it's sandwiched between a Dutch Bro's coffee house and a gun shop/range (very quaint location). Then when you walk in, you are transformed back in time, probably in New York around the 1960s or 1970s. A time where live music was happening, and the service was very personable. \n\nI went there with my boyfriend and his stepmom. We arrived around 6:30 pm or so and was seated immediately. Our waiter did some small talk with us, then got our drink order. I couldn't decide what to order so I did some more chatting with the waiter and asked for his recommendations. \n\nMy bf stepmom ordered the Shrimp Scampi which she enjoyed very much. My boyfriend ordered their famous Baked Lasagna which was really delicious. The plus side of ordering the lasagna was that they gave more meat marinara sauce if you wanted more of it. (So all you meat marinara lovers have at it!) As for me, I got the Linguine Luciano which was so delicious! Their portion was huge! and I wanted to finish every bite of it but didn't have enough room in my stomach for it. I guess I shouldn't have gotten a cup of their Grandma's Famous Chicken Soup prior to my meal. However the soup was so good how could you not want to finish that???\n\nSince it was my boyfriend's birthday weekend, the band played Happy Birthday for him and we got a Cannoli! Which was really good! \n\nOverall experience: service, setting, and food... 5 stars!!!\nTotally will come back when I'm in Vegas and recommend anyone to come and eat there. Oh yeah... if you happen to be in town and you wanted to get to this place but don't have a car or don't want to drive. You could make a reservation prior to your visit and get complimentary limo service from them. (Something to think about.)\n\nHappy Eating Everybody!"

I am so glad that I did...This dish blew my mind, I would rate this is as one of my all time best Risotto dishes. I have had quite a few especially as I did part of my Chef Training in Genova, this rates right up there with some of the best. My friend ordered the Cioppino and this was so rich and flavor full, the sauce was divine...\n\nI have to say as a restauranteur I am amazed that the labor turnover is so low, this shows one thing that the team members want to be here to work, most have been there over a decade...\n\nWhen visiting Las Vegas this is a must visit place I know it not on the strip but a 15 minute jaunt off the strip is totally worth it...They can even send a limo...we got one back to the Hotel...\nThis is a secret that the locals all visit....YOU NEED TO VISIT THIS PLACE...DONT LEAVE VEGAS WITHOUT DINNING HERE"

Soup and salad does not come with the entree, and I would not recommend spending the extra money--the entree itself was very filling and we had split it!

They also don't seem to have serving sections, so it would have been hard to grab his attention. Luckily the manager(?) walked by and heard us talking about it so he ran the check for us.

As a gluten intolerant customer, I figured I'd have little to no options at an Italian restaurant. Not only did they have several options, but Michael was quick to navigate me through the menu. The scallops were delicious and my fianc\u00e9 said that his gypsy pasta was a wonderful spicy dish. If we lived here, we'd be back in a heartbeat. When we come back to Vegas, we'll be sure to come again. \"Just remember, leave the gun, take the cannoli\""

Wine bottles are 1/2 off on Sundays and Mondays. \n\nSo we started with the special appetizer.  Crostinis with buffalo mozz and prosciutto topped with roasted red peppers... MMMMM!!! \n\nFor my dinner I ordered the Osso Buco.  Holy crap.  I had never had it before.  The best meal that I have ever eaten.  And I eat a lot!\n\nThis was the best experience I've ever had in Vegas.  If I ever go back out, I'll definitely be hitting this place again. \n\nWith appetizer, 2 dinners, dessert and a half price bottle of wine it was about $110 without the tip. Little pricey, but definately worth it.  Plus the limo ride to and from was free! (I did tip the driver though)"

I came across Casa Di Amore while reading some other reviews. \n\nIt started out great with their limo picking us up at our hotel (Aria). If you call them far enough in advance, they may have their limo pick you up and take you back to a strip hotel. There is no charge but make sure you tip the diver. He was great and picked up and dropped us off in style. \n\nThe atmosphere is fun in the style of \"Old Vegas\" meaning pictures of Sinatra on the wall and live music every night. It is very lively and loud. The dress is casual.\n \nI am a New Yorker born, raised and currently living. Good Italian restaurants are the norm in NY but I couldn't wait to try some of their dishes after some of the rave reviews. Well, The 6 of us had some starters and 6 different mains. The chicken parm., chicken florentine and the other standards were all fine. But just fine-not more. \n\nThe service also was fine-but not more. And yes-the desserts were fine-but not more.\nI will say the wine list was above average.\n \nIt can also be a pricey evening depending upon what you order.\n\nI would still recommend Casa Di Amore if you want to get off the strip for a meal and experience a little \"Old Vegas.\" It's a good change from some of the more upscale restaurants on strip. If you are in Vegas for 3 nights or more, make this one of your dinner stops and enjoy the limo ride!"

We arrived slightly early, but we were seated immediately. I can't remember our waiter's name, but he was fantastic. You could tell he was vastly experienced, as I believe he mentioned he had been working there for 10 years! He got a feel for how much time we had to dine that night (we had around three hours before our show) so he slowed everything down for us so we could enjoy each other's company and the wonderful live music, as well as the overall ambiance of the restaurant. \n\nWe munched on the tasty bread and butter that were provided and decided to order some bruschetta to share. The bruschetta was delicious! It's strange how something so simple can taste that good. After a long while we decided to make our entree orders, which were the Gypsy Pasta and the Chicken Marsala. When I told our waiter I wanted the Gypsy Pasta he warned me about how spicy it was and that it was usually not very enjoyable for most people that ordered it. This brought to mind the question of why it was even on the menu, but before I could ask he told me it was because actual gypsies (there were two groups of them dining there at the time) would come in and order it and just love it. In the end, our waiter brought me some of the sauce to sample and, my goodness, it was hot. I promptly ordered some linguini and meatballs with a slightly less spicy sauce!\n\nOur meals were delicious, and my pasta bowl was huge. We had to get boxes to go. It was a great experience. I feel like if I had told someone we had just gotten engaged we probably would have gotten a cannoli or something because there were lots of other people getting them for their birthdays and weddings!\n\nAlso, we had the cheesecake with strawberry sauce and it was very good.\n\nTo top off the impeccable service, when we first arrived I asked our waiter if it would be possible to use the complimentary limo service to get a ride to the Bellagio where we were going to see \"O\" after dinner. He said he couldn't make any promises, but that it would probably work out. Turns out he procured us a ride, so we got to show up to the Bellagio in a limo. The limo driver was fantastic. He was playing Star Wars music, so we had a nice chat about the new movie."

I loved the warm cozy atmosphere and the music was a nice touch however it was drafty in the restaurant and very busy.  The food is over priced and the drinks were very expensive.  I got sick after eating the chicken parm.  I am from the east coast and I that's what I was expecting however sadly disappointed.  Chicago joes is better food and less expensive"

Spicy lovers, do the Gypsy sauce if you can handle it.\nThey have delicious veggie meatballs.....but you have to pay extra for them......only sometimes.\nBar specials after midnight\nOpen 5pm. to 5am\nClosed on Tuesdays"

There is a lounge singer who sings the classics loud enough to hear, but soft enough to not intrude. We came hear with two out of town friends. We got the bruschetta and calamari for appetizers. The bruschetta was delicious, with sweet, ripe tomatoes. The calamari though was the star, very lightly breaded and flash fried, it was the best calamari I've ever had. We all shared  a bottle of wine, which was reasonably prices and tasty, a Malbec. For our entrees we ordered fettuccine with shrimp, linguini with clams in white sauce, chicken Parmesan, and gnocchi with prosciutto and spinach is a four cheese sauce. Everyone raved about their entrees. I had the gnocchi and the gnocchi were pillow soft. The sauce was rich and elegant. We ordered molten lava chocolate cake and passion fruit bomb for dessert. The cake was good, exactly what you would expect. The passion fruit bomb was divine, the sorbet inside tart mixing well with the outside, sweet chocolate shell. Altogether the meal was $208, a fair price for an exquisite dinner with excellent service.\n\nA tip for the next time we go... Bottles of wine are 1/2 off on Mondays."

It also was quite loud because there was a large party in there of about 25 people and they also have live music playing through dinner. I loved the music I thought it was a nice touch to have some entertainment so you could take your time and eat dinner. The pasta was very good but the bread that most yelpers recommended was not anything to rave about. It actually reminded me of breadsticks from Pizza Hut so I guess if you're in to those..then try it. I actually did not take any pictures because I was too excited to eat that the pics were an after thought! Sorry :) but I would recommend the fettuccine Alfredo and a side of the meatballs! I didn't have room for dessert because I started with a house salad which was also very good. One of the best things about this place is they have a shuttle that will transport you to and from your local hotel but you have to book in advance because it fills up quick! The prices were not much cheaper than anything you can get on the strip but it was still nice to venture out and check out what the rest of Vegas has to offer."

            "review": "I joined Susan and a few others for my first Yelp event : an evening (roundtrip) limo ride to Casa di Amore.  The restaurant sends its own branded red limo to pick up customers on the Strip- more fun than a plain old taxi ride. The limo isn't all that big but I'd never been in one before so it was kind of cool playing with the buttons for the \"mood lighting\" and the A/C (and laughing as Susan accidentally found one that suddenly separated us from the driver with a metal partition!). :-)   \n\nThe restaurant definitely has an old school Vegas feel.  Photographs of Vegas line the walls of the dining room in a chronology, starting with Old Vegas and ending with modern, color photos of the Vegas we see today: gaudy, colorful and sparking! A lounge singer plays the piano and sings old hits such as \"Copacabana\" (he even had backup singers for that one- don't know where the background sound came from!)  \n\nSome in our group had a vested interest in a football game. A section towards the back of the restaurant sports lounge seating and widescreen TVs showing at least a couple of football games, so they could easily walk back there for a closer look at the game from time to time.  \n\nAs a vegetarian/vegan (depends on my mood right now) I was surprised at the paltry salad offerings- I had hoped for a nice big salad for my dinner. Instead, I opted for the small, plain house salad that comes with your order. I chose the penne with greens as my entree (escarole cooked in olive oil). It was very tasty and a bit rich- made me wonder if there was a touch of cheese in it, but I forgot to ask.\n\nAnyway, I had a good time with the charming and funny Yelp crew  (Myke, you are a blast) and enjoyed a nice meal as well."

The lack of organization and service soured our experience enough that we won't be returning. We waited 90 minutes for our food due to another party's food coming up around the same time. For a business that has been around this long I would've thought they'd have figured out how to handle that.  That was a poor excuse for letting us wait 30 minutes past when they were \"plating\" our food for us to actually get it, without giving us the courtesy of checking in to let us know some mistake had been made. The place was swarming with servers, if ours had been overloaded we'd be able to be a little more understanding. \n\nBy the way the crispy salmon is a solid choice. The Alfredo with sausage was good as well. Our sons ravioli seemed like it used the gypsy sauce instead of a standard marinara and our little guy couldn't quite take it."

Most of them have great food and many of them try to show off their connections to the days of old, pretending to be something they never were and never could be.\n\nCasa di Amore is one of those establishments that has a real connection to Vegas' past, but lacks the pretention of those other joints. Everyone here, from staff to management to the customers who make Casa di Amore their regular stop, is genuinely low key and laid back. They're far more interested in making sure you enjoy yourself with some old-time Vegas than trying to pretend they are some big shot from the glory days.\n\nThe food is exactly as good as you expect and never let's you down. The price point is extremely reasonable, especially on half price wine bottle night. \n\nStop in and you'll be made to fell at home - with a great meal and a fabulous experience."

My friend drank the broth like it was soup!\n\nAlso ordered the meatballs as an appetizer.  Wow.  $4 for 2 large meatballs - just slightly smaller than a tennis ball.  I asked for extra sauce to dip that yummy house bread in after my friend drank all my clam broth :/\n\nWe ordered the osso buco $42 which is always a hit.  Comes with risotto.  Can get a side salad or soup for an extra $3.  The Caesar had just the right amount of dressing.  Only thing missing was the anchovies.  Special soup today was Boston clam chowder.  My other friend used his finger to clean the cup clean.  What's with my friends and soup?!  I digress.\n\nI ordered the penne pesto (garlic, pine nuts, basil, parmigiano-reggiano with heavy cream $22) I failed to see the page description of ONE POUND PASTA BOWL and ordered grilled chicken as an add on.  I was shocked to be warned that it was a $10 add on but wanted some protein to go with my oh-so needed carb craving so I agreed to it.  Later I found out that you can add chicken to the fettuccine alfredo for only $3 which made no sense but I didn't bring it up.  It did turn my 5 star experience to a 4 star.\n\nMy other friends ordered the linguini and clams (oth chopped and shelled clams $24.  Half the size of my penne but he could finish his pasta and I took mine home) and the rigatoni.  Server commented \"excellent choice\" to the rigatoni order and not to the other 3.  Didn't get the price but he ate it all.  Was on the one pound menu (emoticon with the big eyes)  I tried to look it up on their online menu but it wasn't there but I did notice that several items on their physical menu were not listed.  They also have daily specials.  Today was a grilled chicken and filet tips - both sounded fantastic.

Casa Di Amore is about 10 minutes away from the strip so it's not something you are going to just come across on the strip but do make an effort to come here when you are in Las Vegas. One of the main reasons this was a planned visit, was due to the great reviews. I will tell you that I was not disappointed at all. The spaghetti was absolutely fantastic, it was perfectly cooked with gigantic meatballs. The spaghetti was very fresh & hot. \n\nI do wish they would have had a smaller portion as 1 pound was too much for just myself but I tried my best to still finish it because it was that good. It was a smaller place with a great feel to it and the spaghetti was better than I would have imagined it to be. \n\nThe staff was very friendly including our server and food arrived in a timely fashion. As a nice bonus, the server set us up with a shuttle from the restaurant back to the strip at no charge! I thought this was a nice gesture as again it's about 10 minutes outside of the strip where I wanted to get back to anyway. The shuttle was newer, clean & air conditioned. The driver was courteous and our party did tip him which you should do the same as after all it is a free ride. \n\nIf you like Italian food, don't forgot to make reservations when you are booking your trip to Vegas! I will certainly be returning on future trips to Las Vegas."

Currently it no longer operates 24/7.\n\nSince returning and then checking yelp for reviews, I was stunned that nobody mentioned the table situation since the renovations, because it is bad enough to ruin your dining experience.  One of the unique features about this restaurant is that it has booths to accommodate up to 6 people.  Since the renovation, the owner opted not to replace the tables that fit the booth!  Instead he opted to put TWO  2-top tables together turned sideways!  So these spacious booths now have two very narrow tables, side by side resulting with two people  eating where the two tables meet.  What was he thinking!  In addition, these tables have huge cafe stands which limit your leg and foot room.  The tables also are not balanced to the floor which means you need to be very aware of your plates at all times because they  tilt and swerve.  Who does this?  All the booths in this restaurant now have this impractical table setup.  Michael get the correct tables for your booths.\n\nAnother annoying feature about the renovations would be the extremely bright (pink) spot lights on each table.  It is like being in a room with over the top  pink fluorescent lighting in your face.  There is nothing warm about the lighting anymore in this restaurant unless you sit in the bar.  A lighting designer would never use this configuration.  \n\nThe food.  The beauty of Casa Di Amore in its day was the quality and value.  The current prices at Casa Di Amore are very  inflated for the quality.  As in Sinatra pricing at the Encore minus the high quality food.  The food presentations are what my Sicilian grandmother would call \"half-hearted\".  Their signature wedding soup is now loaded with salt, missing the greens (that it use to have) and the broth that years ago you could tell took hours to make fresh, now tastes like it is out of a carton.    Our pasta dishes were delivered to the table unfinished.  As in, someone dumped penne into a bowl and then poured a tiny bit of sauce in the dead center.  Naked pasta is better left for a buffet line.  It was also grossly over cooked.  \n\nOne good thing is that Casa Di Amore still has really good entertainment.   Sadly, we won't be returning to this restaurant again.  We will drive the extra few miles to get better quality food, correct tables and elegant dining atmosphere at Allegro, Sinatra or Capos."

I made reservations a couple of weeks before our visit since we would be in town for a few days. This was no ordinary day for us, we were renewing our vows after 25 years and didn't want to go to just any restaurant. We wanted to go somewhere special. Casa Di Amore was definitely that. We arrived still dressed from the big day. We were greeted by multiple members of the staff and congratulated over and over. Even many of the locals (we knew they were locals because you could tell this was their local place to go to eat) stopped by to talk with us. \n\nWe were seated near the entertainment and had a great view of them playing and singing. The food was AMAZING. I had the salmon and it was probably one of the best salmon dishes that I have ever had. My husband had the chicken marsala and he finished the dish and loved it. \n\nThe staff went out of their way to ensure we were having a good time and that we were recognized for our special night. So much so that they had the band announce our names and why were there (to which the rest of the restaurant gave a round of applause and their congratulations, some even stopping by the table) and the band played a song just for us. \n\nI cannot say enough good things about this place. Please do yourself a favor and get off of the strip, eat at a local place and have an amazing time. We will definitely be back the next time we are in town."

The shrimp cocktail was a old Vegas favorite, too. \n\nSo I stop in on a Wednesday after a long trade show at 9:30. Barely found a spot to park and the place was packed! Only in Vegas. Brad still hamming it up at each of his tables as I ate at the bar - no option! \n\nThe menu has changed, but the same flavors and presentation. I'll miss my old favorites, but grow up fat boy and suck it up! Try something different. This trip I ordered the Chicken Parmesan....this partially due to Peyton Manning and all of the \"hammered in your head\" commercials on Sunday football. Dang Nationwide Insurance. Class's was no slouch - full of flavor and worth every bite. \n\nService is fantastic and I'm sure they make a huge tip base as when people are happy - many go 25%+. Brad is that type of server. \n\nAnyways - this is just another one of their huge base of Yelp reviews. A true 5 star rating - Enjoy and always win big."

The most I knew of this place was that the former Frank Sinatra sound-alike that used to be at the Brown Derby at the MGM Grand (now Craftsteak) performed there.  Well, I'll tell you that this is some of the best Italian food I've had here in Las Vegas.  Yes, the place is small, but the atmosphere is wonderful, especially the live music during dinner.  I liked the fact that the singer came from table to table shaking hands and singing.  Also that people felt free enough to dance and to toast each other.  I had the Pomodoro Fresco, which is the pasta with garlic butter and tomatoes.  Yummy!  And for dessert, I had their cannoli, which was absolutely fabulous!  Reminded me of cannoli from the late, great Albina's bakery and also from back east in Buffalo at Ilio DiPaolo's restaurant.  Also, because I got the cannoli, I got a free T-Shirt with the restaurant logo on the front and the immortal line \"Leave the gun, take the cannoli\" on the back!  So cool!  Will definitely be going back there!"

I had the stuffed pork chopped which were really good, just too much to eat and my wife had the chicken angelo which she also really enjoyed.  We had a restaurant.com certificate that kept our bill under $60 for the meal.  Our waitress, host and gentleman who was singing on stage were all super friendly and superb at their jobs.  The only reason for leaving off one star was the seating was a bit uncomfortable and we both found the lack of lighting to be somewhat awkward.

The tomatoes looked like they were winter tomatoes (pale!!!) not summer tomatoes (red!!!). Not sure why since we came in the middle of June and this place is in Vegas.\n\nThe lasagna was 100% mushy in each layer and was unappetizing. We had to send this back sadly. Also disappointing since this is a very popular dish and we would expect for it to be spot on!\n\nAtmosphere here is divey, dark, and a little tacky with colorful lights near the bar.

I've never given anything two stars (you can check my record), and it's hard for me to even write this, but honestly I can't understand the positive reviews.  The only thing this place has going for it is a vintage ambience, but the food was exorbitantly priced for such mediocrity.  My boyfriend and I started with the fried calamari, which had no seasoning and no calamari.  Then he got the chicken special and I got ravioli.  For what little chicken was on his plate over linquine completely drowned in congealed cream sauce, it was remarkably average and needed to be doctored up.  My ravioli, while large, was the same.  We both were looking for someone to come around and shave some fresh parmesan over our meals, but all they offer is the shake can on the table.  None of this would be horrible if our plates were $10 or $12 dollars a piece, but his was TWENTY-EIGHT dollars (always ask how much the specials are first) and mine was $20--shocking (shocking!), to quote Joan Cusack.  For three small plates (the fried calamari, the chicken, and my ravioli), and just two small glasses of wine, the bill was $100.  Worst $100 ever spent on food.  In every other city, we can get two very well-put together and flavorful meals for the price of one forgettable piece of chicken at Casa Di Amore.  So . . .two stars because the food isn't completely inedible.  Just  underwhelming and a terrible bang for your buck."

We wanted to try something authentic and off the strip and I looked at Yelp and found this place.  Since I had never been in a limo I was quite excited that they provide free limo service to and from their restaurant.\n\nWe were picked up promptly at 6 at the MGM for our reservation at 6:15.  We were sat immediately and greeted by a very pleasant server (Lynn?) She was very attentive at first but as the restaurant filled up we saw her less and less and seemed like were an annoyance when we asked for something.  \n\nDrinks were very good, so was the bread. My gnocchi pancetta was TOOOO good.  Amazing really. I have had a lot of gnocchi and this was obviously made fresh.  Husband had fettucine and said \"meh\".\n\nCouple with us had lobster ravioli, he said the sauce overpowered the lobster but that it was still good. They also had steak and it was the best steak i have ever tasted. It actually melted in your mouth. Thankfully it was big enough for her to share :)\n\nWe had canole and creme brule for desert.  I have had much better creme brule.  I wasnt impressed.  The canole was pretty tasty tho.\n\nThe ambiance is really great. It has the feel of old 50' s mobster style Vegas. Red paint and bricks. Just cool. The live band was awesome and really set the tone singing Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.\n\nSo where does the star fall off of a 5 star rating?  When we went to pay the bill I had a restaurant.com gift certificate (which by the way is a rip - dont use them....lots of hidden fees and rules - pain in the butt).  I gave it tand my credit card for the remaining balance to the server and she disappeared. She brought back a receipt and our friends bill which they paid.  I was confused that I didnt have a receipt for my credit card and tracked her down because she was not coming back to our table. I asked if the bill was settled and she said it was and said goodbye.  The limo driver then drove us to the strip. Half way there we were basking in the great meal and mood of being in a limo and satiated.  When the phone rang. I could hear the limo driver talking about an unpaid bill.  He asked me if  we had paid and I assured him that we had.  He argued with someone on the phone and then handed me his cell phone.  The guy on the other end asked if we had paid and I told him what had happened and said the server confirmed we had paid.  He said for some reason she didnt run our card and therefore I gave him the card info again over the phone.\n\nI did not appreciate the insinuation that we were dining and dashing, especially since we were obviously taking THEIR limo back to the strip.  WTH?  I also didnt appreciate the server not taking responsibility for her mistake and then putting the issue on us while we were trying to enjoy our limo ride back to the strip. I spent 5 of the 10 minutes on the phone with the staff working out payment.\n\nI think they need more servers because our server was fantastic and then when it got busy we barely saw her and this mistake occurred, surely because she was busy.  Still obnoxious.\n\nAll told, we would go back but I really was pissed about the payment issue."

We chose Casa Di Amore based on reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor.  \n\nWhat really sealed the deal for us to go here was the free \"limo\" ride.  The limo is technically a limo, but it basically had seating for 4 comfortably or 6 a little tighter.  Either way, it saved about $40 in cabs so it was very welcome.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a strip mall on Tropicana and shares space with a gun store.  It felt like a real locals joint.  \n\nThe atmosphere wasn't anything special.  There were old Las Vegas pictures and paintings on the wall and a keyboard player was singing Christmas tunes.  I usually hate music when I'm eating, but it was not obnoxious and added to the night.\n\nEverything tasted as if it was made by a friends mother.  For my main course I shared a fantastic Chicken Piccata and Gnocci Bolognese.  Sharing is not only fun, but it's a good way to sample the flavors and not to overeat - something that happens a bit too often.\n\nCasa Di Amore was a very home style type dinner.  It's another nice off the beaten path Italian restaurant in Vegas.  The last time I went a little out of the way for Italian was to Nora's, which was phenomenal.  Nora's is pretty popular and crowded since it's been featured on the Travel Channel.\n\nIf you've been there and done that and want another local Italian joint Casa Di Amore is another good option.  The food was very good, but not the best ever.  The decor was nothing fancy, but everything was good and fun.  I'd rate this above average but not great."

What I found, was Casa di Amore.\n\nFirst, let me say that I wasn't expecting very prompt or excellent service given the time and day, but within a minute of walking in I was seated, and very shortly there after had a glass of wine. :D Clearly I was happy with the service.\n\nThe menu was quite expansive and the wine selection was very good. After ordering, the wait for the food was relatively short given the time. around 20 min if I remember right. ... WOW! the food ... damn it was good!\n\nThe atmosphere was relaxed, not too loud, and quite comfortable all around. The background music wasn't the typical Italian joint 10 song album on repeat, it had quite a bit of variation, still lounge music but at least unique, in a way.\n\nI'll definitely be going back, likely many times. I gave it 4 stars, would have preferred 4.5 though. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 was the price of the food. It seemed everything started at $20 a plate BUT it was worth it."

They only had one of three limos operating that night so we didn't have any options other than a cab.  We had reservations for 6:45pm.  It wasn't until 8pm that we were finally being seated at our table.  What's the point of a reservation?\n\nThe prices are way too expensive for the quality of food.  The pastas aren't even made in house.  The sauces were bland.  I found adding copious amounts of salt gave the food some flavor.  \n\nOne other good thing was our server though.  Very friendly and took the time to answer all questions we had.  Was it all worth the far trip and the long wait....no."

I never  realized they closed at 5am! The entrance is in the back and so is the parking. I always thought it looked dead but after driving behind, this place had a nice little  crowd going for midweek 2am! The full menu is also  offered throughout entire business hours.\nTo start off they bring you a nice warm loaf of bread with olive oil and balsamic. Yum!\nThe fettucine alla papasito had a delicious, rich, creamy sauce with little sausage meatballs. Very homey, cozy taste. Some people might say it has a little spicyness due to the sausage so if you order a -5 on the 1-10 spicy scale, this one isn't for you lol.\nMy boyfriend got the chicken parmigiana. He replaced the typical spaghetti w/ marinara for spaghetti w/ alfredo sauce just because that's what he was craving. I was actually really surprised. Their chicken parmigiana is on point! And it's not a thin, flattened out half a chicken breast either. It looked like a full chicken breast butterflied and lightly breaded. Really good! On the picture I took it looks smaller than it actually was. He was even a little surprised and said it was better than Magianno's (he works there).  \nIt's a little on the pricier side for what they offer, a little more than cheesecake factory but I don't mind. I just love that they're opened so late! Our server, who was also the bartender made sure to keep checking up on us even though the bar was full of people. Good customer service and really friendly also. He didn't make us feel uncomfortable for ordering food or anything that late at night. Will definitely be back!"

I can't imagine going on a night without the live entertainment which made the experience.  \n\nThe night we went it was one older black guy and one older white guy singing mostly 70s easy rock and R&B covers. They should call themselves \"Grey\".  \"Hi, I'm white\" \"And I'm black\", \"And together we're Grey\".\n\nSERVICE:  Great, but it's the kind of place that gets super busy, so we ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees all at the same time just in case.  \n\nDRINKS:  Not weak. And the bar has video poker/keno/blackjack. And if you want to eat in the bar, they will give you something that looks like a cutting board with high heel clogs.\n\nLIMO/VAN:  You better reserve that in advance.

The meatballs (a side for $4) were perfect.  I made the mistake of ordering the gypsy sauce even though I was told that on a scale from 1 to 10 in spiciness it was a 15.

Didn't have high hopes because of the name (seemed a little cheesy), but figured it was worth a shot. There is some sort of inner-dimensional time shifting porthole just outside the front door, because as soon as you step in the restaurant you transported to Brooklyn circa 1978. \n\nThe place was packed, and I mean wall to wall. Grabbed a seat in the bar and just fell in \"like\" with the place. I can only describe the whole event as surreal. There was even a guy at the bar that looks like he was cast out of \"Goodfellas.\" I still think he was paid by the restaurant to be there. \n\nService was good, ambiance was outstanding, food was 4/5 stars. Had stuffed ravioli, the cheese was great, but pasta was not great. Salad was very good with a house made dressing. Also ordered spaghetti with Gypsy sauce. They will warn you that it is spicy. Let me warn you, IT IS SPICY. I had to dilute it with marinara. Very good though, and the meat balls were great. \n\nWould have given 5 stars but I thought it was a little pricey for both location and quality of food. Also, I am pretty sure my Johnny Walker Black was a Red. Might have been a mistake on the order from the noise of the festivities, but I got charged for a Black. \n\nI would go back, mostly for the ambiance and that Gypsy sauce. I recommend it, but stay away from drinks or your bill will be high, high, high. And make sure you stroll through the bar to see if they have the \"Goodfellas\" guy there, he made my night just by his presence alone."

Seating is congested and you need to get accustomed to the general noise level which includes the live music and  chatter of waiters and customers\n\nSurprisingly, I was the only one of our group to order a regular meal off the menu.  I chose the Chicken Alfredo which I found to be a nice size, tasty and fairly priced.  The others in my group elected to try various side dishes for their meals including a tasty meatball and various pasta options.  Overall, most of our group felt the portion sizes were larger then they wanted to eat and were happy with the smaller plate options.\n\nService was attentive, prices were fair and the noise level was higher then we would prefer. ."

We didn't even realize it was Saturday night at prime time (6:00 p.m.) until we walked inside and the place was PACKED. There was a wedding reception being held as well as regular dining reservations. We didn't have a reservation, but the manager came over and said, \"You can have this booth but you guys have to be done by 7:30, and that should give you plenty of time. Does that work?\"\n\nOF COURSE IT WORKS. \n\nWe got the garlic bread loaf (heavenly) and I got a Caesar Salad to start. Yum! I love their dressing!!!!! I ordered the special for the evening - Lobster ravioli (tossed in Vodka sauce) and it was perfect. It came with NINE HUGE ravioli stuffed to the brim with deliciously fresh lobster meat. The sauce tasted great too, and I know my vodka sauce - trust me! ;)\n\nMy gf got the chicken parm and she almost finished the whole thing. That's how you know something is good! I had a few bites and really liked that the chicken was moist but not too thick! Our friend got the fettuccine alfredo with chicken and she barely even looked up from her plate before she finished eating. So, I'm assuming it was perfect. \n\nOverall, I give the food a 4.5 (it's not THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD IN THE WORLD but it is VERY GOOD) but the service gets a 5++++ star rating. Brad, our server, was on his toes all night. He had recommendations, explained the menu, was friendly, never let any of our drinks get even close to empty, and had things taken care of before we even needed to ask. Thanks, Brad. \n\nI like that this place is away from the strip and I really love how dark it is inside. There's usually live music in the form of a 50's era style crooner and the decorations are flawless. Stone brick wall - PERFECTION. \n\nCheck it out!!"

So yeah, place your bets if that's your thing too. Super crowd spanning all ages. Those 12 foot screens with a sound system to match makes this event as close to being there as possible. This is one Super bowl party that is hard to beat. It's their 7th year so they must be doing something right."

We walked into the restaurant and man was this place packed, but not a touristy, crazy, I gotta get outta here packed. It literally felt like I walked into a scene from \"The Casino\". Family and friends were sitting at tightly packed tables chatting and laughing, a live two man band was against the wall belting tunes and the walls reflected old school Vegas pics. MY KINDA PLACE, I WAS AT HOME!\n\nThe bad...My three person party walked in for our RESERVATION, told it would be a few minutes, so made our way to the bar. The first 45 minutes of waiting was not too bad, but as our wait dragged into over and hour it was clear that people were just not leaving their tables (and why would they when the wine is flowing and fun is being had). The bar and walls around the bar were packed with other parties waiting....waiting......waiting. After a couple of advances to the hostess station and getting the \"15 minutes\" \"15 minutes\" line, we were finally sat after about an hour and a half wait. The worst of the worst was when the waitress came to the table and commented to us as if we had multiple heads \"So, you guys have been waiting a long time\", no apologies. \n\nThe average....The food and the service. Nothing much to wait an hour and a half for. \n\nThoughts...If you have a big party or can get in without a long wait, the ambiance is worth it."

On my first visit, my thought was, \"it's pretty pricey for a small portion of macaroni.\"  Macaroni is cheap, except for here.  But we enjoyed the authentic Italian, homey atmosphere and most especially the live music. We chalked up the (too) high price to the added ambiance.  The food is good as in decent but nothing extraordinary.  And it certainly isn't great enough for the price.  Last night we ordered the sea bass special.  We both love sea bass and have had great sea bass in town.  We got a VERY small steak-like piece of sea bass, twice baked potato that was very small, a few broccoli florets and a few julienne pieces of roasted peppers (I believe).  The plate was $40.  I order the sea bass at Don Vito's which is more than twice that size, possibly 3 times, it is luscious (light, buttery like sea bass is) for $38.  The sea bass last night was much more dense and firm like halibut.  It was tasty but had I seen the plate before I ordered, I would have never ordered it.  Before I arrived there and knew of the special, I was kind of set on the Pasta Alla Forno (penne with chicken, shrimp, broc, mushrooms in a light pink sauce baked with mozz).  Sounds yummy, eh?  I imagine it could have been.  The sea bass wasn't much so I ordered still the Alla Forno to take home, thought I would have it for the next couple days lunches.  At $30 for the plate of macaroni, I expected a good size portion.  I was stunned when I got home and opened the plastic bag.  There was so little macaroni that I could see the bottom of the silver tin they package to go items in. No two lunches there.  When I got ready to eat it today, I literally dissected the dish to search for the shrimp - 4 tiny pcs maybe the size of my thumb nail, count the broccoli florets- 1 sm floret and 2 fragments and the penne - 50.(I do have pictures of all that I will post.)  \n\nHere is the bottom line:  the food is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced.  If paying a lot for the food is worth it for the ambiance, then I think you will find the food decent and love the music.  The ambiance is the ONLY reason we will go there on rare occasion.  If you could careless about the music and just want some good food for a decent price, this is NOT your place.  Since the closing of Tivoli Gardens, Nora's would be my favorite.  My favorite dish there is $20 (which I still think is overpriced) and in ways similar to the All Forno.  But I definitely get two meals out of it, way tastier and you don't have to hunt for the shrimp.  Full size shrimp."

But the experience I had at Casa Di Amore was so exceptional I couldn't help but to spread the word. This place is a must for anyone and everyone in Vegas. \n\nThis restaurant has managed to hit all the hallmarks of a Classic Italian American eatery. The staff was amazingly accommodating, the food was outstanding, the vibe is that of old Vegas with pictures of retro casinos adorning the walls and the music made me think I was listening to Frank Sanatra himself. \n\nStarting with the staff, you can tell they truly care about the place they work and that customers have an enjoyable experience. Next, I had a couple different appetizers. They were all good but the star of the show was a fresh baguette topped with FRESH mozzarella and prosciutto, just wow. This establishment can handle tables of 16+ seamlessly and the owner Michael made sure to stop by every table to ensure we had a great experience. \n\nAs a result I will now be going to this restaurant EVERY TIME I come to town. Also, I found out they offer a limo service that will take you out there conveniently which is a huge plus. I made sure to take a stack of business cards and hand them out to anyone who wanted a one of a kind experience. Again, I can't begin to bolster how great this place is."

They use to rep the NY Giants during football season, but I don't remember seeing the flag out this past year. \nWhen people ask me my favorite Italian food in Vegas, unless I know they are looking for a fancy strip environment, I recommend Casa Di Amore. Once you walk through the doors, you forget you just walked in a small restaurant off Tropicana. Dim lighting, attentive staff, and classic Italian food that reminds me of my grandmother on the east coast. \nSome of my favorite dishes include linguine and clams, eggplant di amore, chicken picatta, and the appetizer of a mini osso bucco with risotto. The risotto is always cooked to perfection. I always add a house salad because their home made dressing is to die for. If I can't make up my mind, I stick with a basic spaghetti and meatballs. Perfect, classic comfort dish. \nThey have a bar, but right now it is under construction so they are only serving beer and wine. I can't wait to come see the newly remodeled lounge area once they are done. \nI love the feeling I get when I am here. Everything is exactly how an Italian restaurant should be.

Once inside, there's a bar area and then a restaurant right past it. The walls are decorated with photos of old Vegas's hey day, with Frank Sinatra, the Flamingo, the Sands and other old locales pictured. It's pretty cool, and during their earlier hours they have live entertainment performing.\n\nAfter midnight they have a special on their bar menu, 1/2 off on all the food. It's basic appetizers and sandwiches, like wings, chicken fingers, sandwiches and pizza. They also have 1/2 off wine on Sundays and Mondays, which we took advantage of while we were there. Their full restaurant menu is also available, so it's worth checking out.  \n\nWe started out with a half price bottle of wine that was suggested by our server. It was a good choice, with low-acidity and a robust, smooth fruity flavor that beautifully compliments a variety of meals. We enjoyed it, savouring a glass each throughout our meal and bringing the rest home. It's a really nice deal! Worth going on a slow day to take advantage of that fact. \n\nMatt, our server, was pleasant and performed a polite demonstration of table service with our wine. He handled the front of house aspect very well considering how busy he was, going back and forth from the restaurant area and the bar. \n\nOur meal started with a bread basket with butter and then the caprese salad. The bread had a crisp exterior with a softer interior and was good with the butter. Not baked on premises, I'm guessing- more likely from the Great Buns bakery down the street, because we were given a loaf later and it was completely identical to the first, a signature of mass manufacturing. I didn't eat too much of it, though, because I didn't want to fill up on starch. As far as the caprese, the tomatoes were mushy and largely flavorless; mealy and obviously refrigerated. I understand the necessity of doing so, but in a dish like caprese salad, comprised solely of the tomatoes, mozzarella, basil & olive oil, it's imperative that the ingredients be truely flavorful. It was mild & a bit mediocre. We ate it, but it wasn't really worth getting excited over.\n\nWe then had the Osso Bucco, or slow-roasted veal shank in a tomato based sauce, with a side of risotto. I immediately noticed that the risotto was REALLY dry and crumbly. Because of the sauciness of the osso bucco, it worked out well enough for me to eat a small portion of the meal, but I wasn't particularly impressed. On the menu they brag that the meat is so tender a knife isn't needed, but I used one. There are tendon pieces, or tougher ligaments that need it on the outer portion of the meat but the interior it IS indeed very tender. \n\nThis is a restaurant with potential, though it failed to meet my expectations. My boyfriend and I shared our meal and we had enough leftover for our lunches today. \n\nI may come back to enjoy their half priced wine and chicken wings. It seemed the bar had a very boisterous clientele, so maybe that's the place to be at the time of night we were being served.\n\nWe took most of our meal to go. I asked about how dry the risotto was, so the server promised it would be rehydrated for me to take home. Upon reheating for lunch it was still crumbly and dry, though perhaps slightly better. Our server gave us a loaf of free bread to take home with our leftovers, which was a nice touch."

The driver was right on time! The drive over to the restaurant was a little longer than anticipated (I had mapped it out at only 3 miles from the hotel) but apparently there was major construction underway on Trop so he had to go an alternative route to avoid that. He gave us a heads up before we arrived that they were in the process of remodeling the restaurant - oh ok. \n\nAs we walked in, there were a few tables already occupied but, upon being seated for a few minutes, we realized it was DEAD quiet. Strangely no music (I had envisioned old Blue Eyes crooning in the background as we were sipping our wine and looking at the historic Vegas photos on the walls). Our server informed us that because of the construction, their music system was disconnected. That definitely reduced the \"ambiance\" factor, but about 15 or 20 minutes in, their live music duo started to play oldies. I enjoyed it, but my BF thought it was cheesy LOL.\n\nAnyway, on to the menu - many choices from chicken to meat to pasta! We ended up ordering bruschetta and a simple salad to start, the mussels appetizer, and 1 lb. of spaghetti (yes a whole pound - we've never seen that anywhere!) with pomodoro. The bruschetta was awesome, the spaghetti was pretty decent, and the mussels dish was nice as well (mostly because of the yummy sauce) although they were the big green lip - I prefer the smaller ones.\n\nWe were pretty full so decided to pass on dessert (didn't want to be falling asleep at the concert). By the time we finished, we were right on time to get with our driver again for the drive back to Hard Rock. Smooth sailing, tipped driver and bid him farewell.\n\nOverall, it was an enjoyable meal but we definitely came at an awkward time because of the remodeling. I think I'd like to return to this off-the-beaten-path restaurant after the expansion is complete to get a more accurate experience. I actually may return next month when my Mom and I will be there for a 2-night getaway. Saluti!"

I'm not sure if they have more parking in the rear but we both thought the front looked like a ghost town when we pulled in for our 7 PM reservation on a Saturday night.\n\nRemember the abandoned restaurant the Fratelli's were hanging at in The Goonies?  Similar.\n\nAnyway, glad we went in.  The food was superb, the atmosphere was perfect and the service was fantastic.  The entertainment...well, he sounded JUST like Frank Sinatra...but he looked like Ronnie from Jersey Shore.  Still great.\n\nPricing was pretty moderate.  I was full and happy when we left."

We spent a pretty penny here but worth it in every way. not expensive or over priced but we did drink and feast and hey that's what you do in Vegas!"

It was ok, but nothing to write home about (just yelp about!). \n\nWe started off with the bruschetta, and it was probably one of the best that I've ever had. It's not super hard to make this, but it was still delicious. For the main course I got the osso bucco which is supposed to be a favorite, but I wasn't thrilled. The risotto was overcooked and didn't have any flavor. Even adding salt did nothing for it. The meat wasn't even as tender as I've had before. The tomato sauce was good, but then again, it's tomato sauce. If you're messing that up, then you should be making Italian food. My friend got the eggplant parmesan, and she really enjoyed it. Again, she said it wasn't the best, but not bad either. \n\nThe dessert was weird. We got the dream bomba, which was SUPPOSED to be peanut butter ice cream, with a caramel center. Well, there was no caramel center, so we just ended up with peanut butter ice cream. Again, it was fine, but it wasn't as described, and it was just ice cream, nothing special. I wouldn't come back here, and I probably would recommend this to a friend. I can think of 5 other Italian restaurants I'd rather spend my money at."

You will literally have to SCREAM at the person next to you in order to have a chat. I'm good with locals places, not every nice restaurant has to be in a casino or be stuffy but if I am going to pay roughly 100.00 for a dinner for 2 I'd like to not sit 2.5 feet away from a white guy with dreadlocks and his date + hear them scream at each other trying to converse for an hour. Sorry, I'm not cool with sitting in the middle of a loud room in a small 2 seater table for these prices (8 bucks for a beer!!!?? in a restaurant off Trop and Mcloud???). Now if it was 3 bucks a beer and slash about 40% of food prices I can roll with it.\n\nThe service was rushed and not great, we saw the waitress twice the whole time (she was busy in her defense). Again for these prices and a spot that calls itself the house of love I was really surprised at the lack of attentiveness. \n\nThe food was not great, the calamari was squishy, mealy, flavorless and the kind you are bummed out when you get (anybody who orders it often knows what I mean). The dishes were very average and not large in portion. I had the linguine and clams and like I said it was ok. Can't recommend it though.\n\n I'm going to take Piero's over this place 100 times out of a 100. At least I get great service and a nice atmosphere for my expensive meal. \n\nIn a nutshell:\n not a place I would take a date because its loud as f and not really intimate (small but not intimate)\nExpensive as a strip casino for drinks so that rules out swinging by and hanging at bar to listen to the band (which you can barley hear with all the diners yelling at each other)\nFood on my visit is average at best and the portions were smallish. (in fact a few hours later we went up to Metro Pizza to share some food since we were still hungry).\nI'd venture to say many people that give overwhelmingly positive reviews did not pay the bill. \nIn addition I see a lot of reviews that say this spot is \"so old school Vegas\", I mean I guess if by old school means they threw up a bunch of vintage Vegas pictures they found online and blew up. This place hasn't been around THAT long and WTH is old school Vegas about charging 10+ for a cocktail in a local restaurant? The more correct term would be it's Old School/Rat Pack (whatever) Vegas for those that have no clue what that actually means."

My wife had the pasta with ham in a cream sauce that was over loaded with salt. Fresh bread was good, the live music was maybe the highlight but not worth the trip.

I wasn't thrilled about that. Nor was I thrilled with the noise level. When I say it was loud, I mean it was LOUD! This is an old school restaurant in an even older building. The walls are solid brick and while that adds character, there is literally nothing to absorb any sound. The space is small and they cram a lot of people inside and all their talking just bounces back at you. Add to that a talented singer/keyboard player and you get one very loud restaurant. I would actually venture to say it was the loudest restaurant I have ever been in.\n\nFrom here on though everything gets better. For an appetizer we ordered the twice wrapped prawns which were incredible. Shrimp wrapped with prosciutto and cheese and then baked in dough, served with a sweet sauce that complimented everything nicely. I loved them and will definitely get them again. We also ordered the \"famous garlic loaf\" which was so good after we finished it we had to order another!\n\nAfter a nice house salad I received my entree of Chicken Marsala. Two good sized pieces of chicken sauteed with mushrooms and a Marsala wine sauce that was as good as I have ever had. It came with a side of pasta. I upgraded the regular marinara sauce to meat sauce and was glad I did.\n\nFor dessert if you order a canoli or creme brulee you get a free t-shirt. I wanted the t-shirt but I wanted the tiramisu more, and it was an excellent choice.\n\nThe service was good, but not exceptional. Most of the waiters do look like they have worked there forever and ours was very knowledgeable about the menu. The host was very nice even though it did take longer than I would liked to get my table.\n\nOverall it was a very good experience. Because of the noise level I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic date unless you really don't want to be able to hear your date very well. We've all had those dates, right?\n\nI do recommend Casa di Amore though and will definitely be back."

            "review": "My wife is a cookbook author and food critic / blogger - so we eat out at fancy restaurants at least once or twice a week, and are very critical of the places we go.  As we are always eating out and looking for another hidden gem for her to write about, we tend not to frequent any restaurant unless it is way better than average.\n\nI proposed to my wife at this restaurant almost 5 years ago, and it is incredibly rare if we are at Casa less than once or twice in a month.  The drinks are good, the wine list is acceptable (with half price bottles on Sunday and Monday), the food is SPECTACULAR, and the service is impeccable.  We have never had a bad meal here.\n\nWe have dubbed this place \"The Mob Joint,\" as the atmosphere is very \"Old Vegas.\"  The decor is straight out of 1960's Vegas, and the brick walls are lined with pictures from the days of Frank and Sammy.  The booths and tables (lined in white linen) are dimly lit, with a romantic ambiance, and the place is just fabulous.  Their nightly entertainment is usually George, who sounds a lot like a young Frank Sinatra, and does a lot of fabulous old crooner tunes, interspersed with some comedy, some show tunes and some Billy Joel.  He is amazing.\n\nThe twice wrapped prawns that everyone here seems to be complaining about are great, wrapped in cheese and then baked in a puff pastry dough.  I think that the salty of the shrimp and cheese mixed with the slight tangy of the dough plays really, really well against the super-sweet of the caramel sauce.  (and we save the caramel sauce to drizzle over the ice cream at the end of the meal)  I like this dish quite a bit, though we don't order it every time.  What we DO order every time is their cheese garlic loaf and a side dish of Alfredo sauce for dipping.....Oh My GOD there is nothing quite so sinful.  You simply MUST try it.\n\nTheir steaks and stuffed pork chops are what we usually order, and they are beyond superb.  Their Osso Bucco is the best I've ever had.  It is so tender it literally falls from the bone.  The Vodka Shrimp is incredible as well.  Over the years, we've had most of the pasta dishes on the menu and have never been disappointed. \n\nTheir prices are on the high side, but nothing that I wouldn't expect to pay at any of the restaurants of this caliber in Vegas.  For us, with a (half price) bottle of wine, the bread loaf, an appetizer to share, side Caesar salads, our meals, and a shared ice cream treat, our bill usually runs about $125 - $150, which is what we generally spend any time we go out for a really nice dinner - and with their portions, we always have some left over for lunch the following day.\n\nMy only minor complaint about this place is that their desserts are less than spectacular, as they are currently pre-made off-site. I do love that the waitstaff are all willing to be honest about the desserts they like, and which to avoid (my wife ordered a creme brulee once, and our waiter leaned down and said with a meaningful look, \"I would really recommend the Chocolate-Peanut-Butter Bomba...The creme bruleee is, well, not what you would expect.\"). \n\nFortunately, the last time we were there the Maitre D' mentioned that they were bringing on a pastry chef in the very near future, so now the only problem will be saving ROOM for dessert!\n\nOverall, if you are looking for that perfect little hole in the wall, that will give you the true old Vegas kind of experience, Casa Di' Amore will deliver in a big way.  Oh, and if you call in advance, They even offer complimentary limo service from/to any of the hotels on The Strip!"

There were quite a few birthdays/anniversaries that were being celebrated.\n\nI would highly recommend it and will make it a point to go back when I return.\n\nOne last thing - there was a lieutenant in the air force who was being deployed next week there with his family.  The restaurant must have been notified about it b/c they announced it and everyone clapped for him.  They comped his dinner which was extremely classy in my book!"

I've seen this restaurant more times than I can count, and never, not once even considered stopping in to check it out. I'm not a fan of Italian food so it never even occurred to me to see what they were offering inside CDA. That was a huge mistake.\n\nI feel like I've been looking for this place for years. And didn't even know it. I don't trust anyone who doesn't dig their old-school decor and energy. And the service is outstanding. Lynn, the music coordinator helped  turn a simple birthday gathering into a real celebration. The band sang a special birthday song for everyone that requested it.\n\nFrom what I can tell, this is a go-to birthday spot for many people. How do I know? I heard Happy Birthday at least 4 times. But who cares? There was certainly an air of celebration in the place. \n\nThe food was solid--the insalata di amore, calamari, and cioppino were all tasty. The cioppino was (rightly) the standout of the night. And the atmosphere is pure retro-Vegas charm. I am such a fan."

Off we go to this highly reccomended place where locals go to feel old style Vegas with pictures of the rat pack everywhere and a two piece jazz combo play nightly songs from the days gone by.  \n\nArrive and don't know what I was expecting as far as ambiance but it is really nothing much as far as esthetics go here.   Seated a long table and can see this is a problem as the normal tables for 2 persons they have 3 tables for 8 of us having 1/2 the guys on table corners and all squished together.  After a little prodding and the fact we were ready to leave we are moved to a table / booth large enough to accommodate us. Not a good start.   A lot of Vegas locals and kids? At 8PM on a Thursday night.  From gym shorts to nice outfits is the motiff while the majority of the place looks like they just left LA Fitness.  Nice restaurant put on a pair of jeans and get rid of the cutoff sleeveless shirt for god sake. \n\nWine list is in short Awful. No Value whatsoever, no variety of any substance, what is there has no vintages and anything worth wild is completely overpriced.  Order some wine which takes forever to arrive as hot fresh bread with garlic butter is provided. \n\nMenu is large, diverse and very good looking hope the food makes up for the other issues.  On we go to the food. \n\nSalads Cold Antipasto for 2 $20.00 good, with some meats and cheeses but no top shelf cold cuts here.  For $20.00 you some Procuitto would be nice. \n\nCesar was pedestrian \n\n$11.00 Stuffed Pepper with meat and cheese, marinara and rice was absolutely Fantastic best meal on the table. \n\n$5.00 sausage and peppers side as an appetizer was delicious \n\n$14.00 shrimp wrapped in Procuitto then baked in filo dough was a don't order again appetizer. \n\n$18.00 Lobster Raviloli were good. \n\n$11.00 Spinach Salad with Honey dressing as good as it gets. \n\nEntrees: \n\nVeal Osso Bucco $43.00 over Risotto with sauce was truly a work of art. (3 of those were consumed) \n\nBasic Chicken Parm was good certainly better options on this menu. \n\nVeal Marsala was fresh tender and tasty as was the Veal Francais. \n\nSeafood Frutte di Marre in White sauce was fantastic, fresh and full of taste. \n\nStuffed Pork Chops with Procuitto and mozerella were good but not great though the brandy cream Sauce on top was delicious. \n\nNote both bottles of wine were absolutely awful. \n\nService was OK nothing spectacular while the little band did entertain us with music during our 2 hour meal. \n\nAll and all not pricey and food was good to very good. Service was average and atmosphere in my opinion was a little lacking.   \n\nAll and all a good experience, and certainly may visit again if local, but for 8 guys used to the finer things in life, I certainly believe we can find better venues."

This will now be a resturant we stop at every vegas trip. \n\nFirst, the atmosphere is fun and a nice change from the Strip. \nSecond, the food was really good! We actually shared a 1lb pasta bowl, I personally am a huge pasta fan (favorite food) and this pasta was delicious. We got the Spaghetti and Meatballs with meat sauce. The meat was full of flavor and the pasta tasted so fresh. \nThird, the live music was AWESOME! Unfortunately I don't recall the name of these two guys, but one played piano while the other drummed. They seemed to know any song, and we even requested a Frank Sinatra song and was not disappointed. They really sounded amazing and if I was local I would definitely book them for a party. \nFourth, the service was a bit slow, but with the music and nice atmosphere we didn't mind. The dessert was not up to par and they immediately took it off the bill and asked if we wanted another, altho we were too full, the consideration was very thoughtful and overall the service was very friendly. \n\nDefinitely a must try if you're looking for Italian and fun night!"

The only bad part about the night was we had a reservation and it took them 45 minutes to seat us so maybe they overbook or don't plan well for how long people will linger.\n\nIt was half price night for wine so you could get a bottle of wine for the cost of 3 glasses of wine so we said why not! It was very much the east coast style Italian restaurant. Small, dark, intimate with a real lounge style singer covering all the classics. It was a two person band and they did a pretty decent job of everything they did.\n\nBe prepared to be a part of the act. We were there mid week and during our 2-3 hours of being there they sang happy birthday 6 times and the whole restaurant joins in!! It was great!\n\nNow how about the food? I was expecting to be unimpressed but it was pretty darn good. Don't be looking for Italy style Italian food but instead think heavy New York Italian and you will be bursting at the seems and very happy. For the older crowd I am sorry to say they do not have spumoni. My Mom was with me and she was really hopeful that a place like this would but everything we got was great. I had chicken parmesan and she had a pasta dish. \n\nIf/when I go back to Las Vegas I will get off the strip one night and eat here again."

We ate here on a Wednesday night and it was pretty full.  The service was good but the singer was not very good.  I felt embarrassed for him a couple of times as he kept hitting the wrong notes.  The music was a little louder than I liked and it made it difficult to have a conversation.  The food was very tasty, the portions just right, but the prices were a little steep for the location.  $22 for a plate of gnocchi was a bit too much for this old building.  I say that if you drive a 78 Cadillac and think slicked back hair is cool then this place is for you."

You can tell mobsters use to dine here. \n\nHere's my quick notes:\n\nOsso Bucco - this is a very rich dish and it came with the bone marrow. Quite impressive.  \n\nCioppino - best fisherman stew ever. The only thing missing was pasta. \n\nGnocchi - soft pillow but a bit salty with the prosciutto. \n\nBruchetta - has a very fresh tomato taste to it. \n\nBellisima Bellini - best I've ever had. \n\nLive music - Frank Sinatra reincarnated. No joke. \n\nBottom line -  very cool place."

We tried almost all they pastas and weren't bad. They started making their pasta portion really small and since it isn't handmade fresh pasta and cost most of them over 20$ or  30$ if you order it with sea food, so for me is not ok. Think that a good brand of Italian pasta cost them less than a dollar. The service on the other end is one of the best you could ever get in Las Vegas and that's why of the 3 star."

My favorite part of the experience, place a reservation in advance for free limo service! Whaaat?!  Does this place know their audience or what?!  How smart is that marketing?!\n\nI adored it.  It was not fancy, it wasn't run down, it was perfect for celebrating and enjoying with loved ones.  There are lots of pictures and Godfather references throughout the restaurant.  I love the kitsch of the d\u00e9cor, it works.  \n\nTheir wine menu is lean, which is fine it offered enough for variety without being overwhelming.  We stuck with Prosecco.  It was good, one option, a little sweet for me, but fine for a special occasion.\n\nThey offer gluten free pasta which is great!  We swapped it for the greens pasta on the menu and it was delicious. We also shared salads (Caesar), chicken parmesan, and cioppino.  The only disappointing dish was the cioppino.  To be fair, SF is in my backyard and we are the ringers for that dish, so it is hard to compare.  It was a decent dish, but if going back I wouldn't order it again.  We should have known better.\n\nI took a scandalous (for me) bite of the chicken parmesan since it used to be one of my favorite dishes and it was perfect! It was lightly breaded, crispy, with melty cheese and a delicious sauce.  My stomach is rumbling just thinking about it.\n\nOur service was amazing for the whole experience; the restaurant brought dessert over to the birthday girl and a free t-shirt for her.  \n\nI think if you are going to LV, take a chance and step off the strip for this little gem.  Live music, free limo rides, and good food - how can you go wrong?"

Being Vegas natives we really appreciated the atmosphere- odes to old Vegas Strip scenery and pop culture/entertainers. The noise level is a little on the loud side, but we actually enjoyed being able to carry on a conversation without worrying about being overheard or being too noisy. Everybody is too busy having a great time. And as busy as they were tonight, we were still seated within 10 minutes. Score.\nNo need for us to order any appetizers, as gratis fresh hot baked bread and butter was provided. Oh my yum. Who doesn't love a hot bread roll fresh out of the oven? So tasty, nonetheless. We helped ourself to another as soon as the first quickly disappeared from the table.\nThe gnocchi alla prosciutto was to die for. The cheesy sauce was light didn't overpower the taste of the prosciutto. A delicate touch of spinach was a perfect inclusion. And a perfectly sized portion for a hungry tummy! Boyfriend had the chicken parm with a side of meatballs, which were wonderfully tender and juicy. We finished our meal with a cannoli. It was baked just the way a cannoli should be done- toasted outside (not soft!), rich and thick cream on the inside. \nStaff was all incredibly friendly. Our meal was concluded with a visit from the manager who made sure our experience was to our liking and shook both our hands. I wish we could remember our server's name, he was awesome! Thank you all for such a great evening! We will definitely be back soon!"

I found this place and thought it would be fun with the live music, limo ride, and an escape from the touristy strip. Well, about 30 mins before we were supposed to be picked up I get a phone call indicating that the limo had broken down and we would have to catch a cab for which we would be reimbursed when we got there. This ruined the surprise and was barely apologized for and, if it wasn't already 8:45 on a friday night, I would've tried to get in somewhere else. After a very long and roundabout cab ride, we arrived and were told our table was not ready yet. 15 minutes later we were still waiting and very unhappy, so we told them we were leaving and they called a cab that they would be paying for. \n\nWhile sitting outside, the manager walked up and apologized for the inconvenience and the unapologetic rudeness of the extremely unprofessional hostess. He told us, \"I don't want you to leave...not like this\" in his best Pauly Cicero voice. He offered to take half off of our bill if we stayed, so we did. \n\nWe ordered the hot antipasto sampler ($18) for two which was huge. There was plenty of fried mozarella, ravioli, shrimp and calamari. all of which were good, especially the ravioli! and the marinara, was like nothing I've had since being back in NY. I got the Dei Frutti Di Mare ($26) which was very good. The broth was pretty thin, as it should be, but had great flavor. I really enjoyed this one, lots of seafood. The wifey got the Pasta al Forno ($26), which I bitterly admitted was a little better than my dish, but whatever, they were both very good. \n\nThe atmosphere is kind of old, Italian American, somewhat of a stale, used-to-be-filled-with-cigarette-smoke kinda smell. But, honestly if it was really bad, the wifey would not have stayed as she is very, very picky. It was very dark and the music was alright. It was old, Sinatra/rat packish covers from a mildly entertaining fellow that seemed to enjoy his job. It was alright. \n\nThe best part was that the manager also slipped us a free entree gift card for a future visit and then they managed to get the limo up and running for our ride back. We did have to share with another couple, but only for the first half of the trip and they were very nice and friendly. the limo was very small and seemed like somewhat of a party limo type of thing, but it was still a nice touch. We might go back, but would make back-up plans in case the limos breaks down again. It is kinda off in the cut in a shadier area."

He claimed he was stuffed, but kept dipping bread into the soup.\n\nDad also ordered a side of meatballs, which I heard were pretty good, too.

SO, I'd have to say that I'm really glad we had a $20 off coupon to eat here.  \n\nThe food itself is deserving of 2 stars but I gave the place 3 stars because it's cute inside and Brad, our server, was really nice.  My hope for him is that he will someday wait tables at a place that actually serves decent food.\n\nSo, on to the actual food..\n\nWe started out with fried calamari, which was pretty good.  The sauce that came with was actually decent as well. No issues here.\n\nI ordered Eggplant Parm and my husband is a Chicken Parm fan.. For the money they charge for the entrees, $19 and $24 respectively, I would have hoped for more food.  Italian food is all about portions, and of course flavor, but you won't get rave reviews from me unless you actually FEED ME... Casa di amore didn't do this well.\n\nMy husbands chicken came with a steak knife, which, most people eating chicken parm would need.. My dinner also came with a steak knife.. first thoughts were \"Why the hell would I need a steak knife for eggplant? I should be able to eat this with just a fork, no problem.\" BOY WAS I WRONG. Holy crap I could barely cut with it the steak knife it was so hard. With the time it took for them to actually COOK the meal, it should have been mush on the plate. Definitely NOT impressed with this at all.\n\nI'm starting to think that the reason why there are no good Italian places in Vegas is because all of the REAL Italians stayed in the Tri-State area."

Instead of introducing herself, the manger stood right behind the hostess and had her repeat over and over that they can't serve me. Hey if you're the boss, learn to approach a customer head on and see how you could help instead of putting your bitch face on and standing there like a statue."

The seating was ridiculous.  my wife and I were sitting so close to other guests, that we could've eaten off of their plates.  I had hopes in the \"homemade\" noodles only to be let down.  Couldn't tell the difference between that and store bought.  Not to mention, I ordered chicken alfredo, right?  I could have literally held the amount that they served me in the palm of my hand.  I had like 5 or 6 cubes of chicken in my pasta. It was pathetic and didn't taste any better than the $1 crap I could've bought in the wal-mart frozen food section.  I paid over $20 for a $2 dish.  The italian ristorante to the west or the sicilian ristorante to the east beats this place by leaps and bounds, no question, and they don't treat you like cattle.  Let this be a lesson to you casa di amore, stop screwing your customers."

However do not take the Limo.... The driver was RUDE... There was apparently a mix up of some kind and we were suppose to share the limo... Taking customers out we declined to \"share\" being late and not wanting to be a shuttle with multiple drop off's... The driver was rude and lectured us on our decision not to share... He argued with us... I still tipped him well for a 5min drive but in hindsight I would not have tipped him at all."

            "review": "This place is awesome for a date night! ;)  \n\nI stumbled across a review for Casa di Amore reviewed by another yelper Karlie G-and decided to try Casa. I had a wickedly wonderful female coming to visit me from LA that I adore visiting me last weekend, and wanted a place to take her that was romantic and cozy-and not on the strip. \n\nChecked  the website after reading the review-free complimentary limo ride if you have a reservation for dinner?!?! Yes PLEASE! Called the number on the website (you can't get the limo through normal website reservations) with the only requirement being you have have to be picked up from a hotel. Perrrfect!  I could drink with my date!\n\nThe person I talked to-Phil, Paul? I can't remember was super cool, had a pleasant demeanor, had me scheduled in no time flat to be picked up from palace station 15 mins before our reservation, thanked me for choosing casa and even put in a request in my request for a booth. \n\nOur limo driver Byron picked us up right on time He introduced himself, was pleasant, opened our doors for we were on our way!\n \nArrived around 7 at Casa Di Amore, and was wondering what to do with my wine glasses and my other bottle of wine we hadn't finished. Byron took anything I didn't want to carry and put it in his trunk and we proceeded right inside-carrying our wine glasses from earlier straight in with us. \n\nGreeted by a super cute, and courteous door girl, I didn't catch her name she was keeping the circus in check around her and doing a great job. She smiled as soon as we came in, and I think she even knew my name as soon as I walked in even though I had never been there before based on the time I walked in and my party size! Nice! What a pro! \n\nWalk in and the atmosphere blew me away!\n\nThe place is not huge by any means, but it just big enough to have an organzied chaos and frenzy of laughter, the smell of italian food, servers zipping about-the kind of place that makes you feel cozy and warm. \n\nOur seats were not ready yet, so they politely asked us to wait in the lounge area near the bar and Byron took led us to the back. We were still drinking our wine, not a thing said by anyone carrying in our own wine glass-double Nice!\n\nA really good lounge singer was belting out some classics and originals and a keyboard player was right in sync with him-he was working hard for the money on the intimate little stage right in the middle of the place. It was just the right loudness to fill the room, without drowning out the conversations people were having. \n\nWe sat for 10-15 minutes, I lost track due to the wine and a little buzzed, but the atmosphere was so enjoyable we didn't even notice. .\n\nA few minutes later we were seated. Our server showed up right away with water's with lemons in them nice and chilly. We got a HUGE 6-8 person booth I requested for the just the two of us-even though the place was packed on a Saturday night-Kudos Casa!\n\nOur server, who was a really nice blonde, asked us about appetizers, but we skipped that figuring we'd get bread and I had read the portions were large. \n\nI ordered the Lobster Ravioli without looking as the rest of the menu, my date ordered the triple cheese pasta and we ordered a bottle of Cabernet. Everything on the menu was priced reasonably as were the bottles of wine. \n\nI'm almost out tryping room, so I'll wrap it up.  I agree with Karlie G-The food was an excellent 4 stars-but the service was 5! -the ambiance a& atmosphere-outstanding. I'd tell you more about the night... but we finished the second bottle...and its a lil fuzzy-aint gonna lie. Never ending Bread basket, 2 Caeser Salads and 2 Entrees and a bottle of wine with tip about $100-not too shabby at all- Everything else melted away staring into the eyes of my companion...and it's the perfect place to do so- Ill be back for sure. ; ) Thanks Casa!"

The food is old school Italian, which I very much enjoy. The front of the house staff is second to none. Plus, the whole place is like traveling back in time! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because of our waitress. We had a large party, and had warned her we would be splitting the tab... She said, \"no problem, I'll print multiple receipts so everyone can circle what they had.\" So we do this, and she cops major attitude because we gave her 5 cards (NOTE: I know this is annoying for a server, but she said it was fine when asked about it). We proceeded to wait for a full 30 MINUTES for our checks to sign! The night had been perfect for me up to that point, and I'm sad it ended on a crappier note. None-the-less, you (review reader) should DEFINITELY go here! Especially if you like nostalgia; this place is very much for you ;)."

I called a week ahead of time to reserve our table. Another awesome perk of this place is that they provide free transportation from the strip in their limos. I had already known about the limos which is why I called so early to reserve them. We were all able to meet at the main valet of our casino and ride together to dinner. We got to the restaurant and our tables were ready. The food was quick to come out and was delicious. The waiter even offered to take pictures for the whole group. Everything was perfect."

I tip according to the food and server. I usually do tip that amount, but being told I had to really irks me! And spending $500 for mediocre food was ludicrous! Won't go back.

They have live bands playing and they do fun songs that you can really get into, they sung some Sinatra and it was awesome. The band members come by and talk to you on their breaks and you all become family. Atmosphere is darker, more \"Romantic\" \"relaxing\" type of setting.. definitely old school Vegas with pictures of celebrities  all over the restaurant. \n\nthe food is PERFETTO! My favorite dish is the  Gnocchi Alla Prosciutto. I get it every time! Great wine and drink list. Service is fantastic even when they're crazy busy. You HAVE to get the cannoli's! FANTASTIC! (You even get a free shirt with it.) \n\nIf you're staying on the strip ride in their complimentary limo! Very clean and did I mention... COMPLITMENTARY?? No nasty expensive cab ride, and it's nice to get off the Strip for a bit. \nI do recommend making reservations (at least for the weekend) because they get crowded fast for dinner time (Hint: make reservations online for easy and fast booking..but if you want a limo you do have to call).\n\nAs far as attire goes, you can either dress up or dress casual (I always go for some type of special occasion so I'm dressed up, and no you won't feel out of place.) Great for a date night with your special other half, or for a family get together graduation, bday, or even bridal shower celebrations!"

There was great live music playing motown and a lot of Frank Sinatra. \n\nWe initially had a bad experience with service here. I made a reservation for four for 8pm, and we were not seated until 8:30p.m. The manager did not really acknowledge the fact that we were waiting so long. After our meal, the manager asked us how our experience was and I complained about the wait at the beginning. The manager gave us free desert, which to me made up for our initial bad experienced.\n\nI am coming from NYC so I know good Italian food and am used to NYC prices. The prices here are around $25-30 per plate which is the typical NYC mid-range restaurant price. I ordered the Veal marsala and it was delicious. My father ordered the Veal francese and he found it to be very good. My mother and girlfriend had different scallop dishes and really enjoyed them.\n\nOne cool thing I learned is you can be picked up and dropped off by a limo for free from anywhere on the strip (obviously tipping the driver though) but you have to book in advance. \n\nOverall I would say this is a very fun place to go, good food, good atmosphere and fair prices."

Other than the whole table issue everything else was pretty much okay the atmosphere was really nice the food was okay not the best I've ever had but it was good.  I think this place is more interested in catering to larger parties  then a small bill for two people which is understandable that they going to make more money on a larger party then they are two people I get it but still we are paying customers so we should be just as important.  Um I'm not sure I'll come back maybe I will but at least I can scratch this one off my bucket list.

But if you want good, honest food that is the a product of the evolution of Italian immigrants making  American ingredients their own, then you gotta try Casa di Amore.

Slow night so we were seated as soon as we arrived. Small place but great decor and the live music during dinner is just great ambiance. \nGreat server\nGreat drinks\nExcellent food ( had the veal )\nFree ride \nPricing is normal for Vegas, but I expect to pay 30-50 a piece for dinner. The difference here was the service if you treat people with respect in turn great service. We all loved it will be back every time in Vegas."

Open until 5am, live music during early dining hours to set the tone, half off pizzas after midnight, friendly informative service from Stephan(I hope I spelt this correct), and to top it amazing food that really has that \"grandmas recipe\" taste. We started with fresh bread , garlic butter. Sold! Lobster ravioli and shrimp scampi... I cleaned both plates with my second basket of bread. I had the steak flamb\u00e9 (NY strip) with a peppercorn sauce that was just right to not take away from the steak. Saut\u00e9ed broccoli, twice baked potato, and roasted peppers. He had the chicken parmigiana with and extra side of that amazing marinara sauce. Both dishes clean and cleared. Just bummed we didn't save room for dessert. Next Monday cannoli here we come! Also on Mondays they have half off wine bottles!"

The bartenders are super friendly and our server was top notch!\n\nBut the food is overpriced and pretty average. There just wasn't anything special about any of the meals we ordered. For the price we were paying, we expected better. I've had tastier meals at Carabbas and Maggiano's (and paid a lot less). \n\nLike I said, the atmosphere and service is unbeatable.

It has a somewhat over the top Rat Pack era Vegas thing going on, which was great. There was a live singer the Saturday night we went. I half expected the ghost of Dean Martin to breeze in the door any second. This restaurant is relatively far off the Strip down East Tropicana but they will purportedly send a limo to pick you up. I didn't see this limo but if it is anything like the decor in this place, you'll most certainly turn a few heads as it picks you up in front of the Bellagio. \n\nThe food is traditional Italian. Lots of pasta dishes that you'll probably be very familiar with. Service was very good. Our waiter was attentive and the items we ordered came fast. They ran out of Cannelloni that we ordered and threw in a free desert because of it. Nice. Old school service.\n\nThe lasagna they did have was nicely done. Plenty of meat in meat sauce, and cheese in the product. Well seasoned and flavor. It was served at the right temperature - not scalding hot like many lasagna dishes you get. \n\nThe eggplant was pan fried and then served with red sauce, cheeses and a side of pasta. It too was very good. Portions are not ridiculously large like they can be in some traditional Italian restaurants like this, which is good because if you're staying in a hotel, you obviously can't take anything home. \n\nIf you're staying on the Strip, a trip to the Casa will be a nice way to get away from the tourist throngs for a few hours. A definite thumbs up!"

It is an older limo but has character and sure beats a dull cab ride any time!  We had just come from seeing Jersey Boys so this added to the theme of the evening. Now you have to reserve in advance for the limo and tip the driver but totally worth it. \nThe restaurant is very old Vegas decor and you would expect  Sinatra to walk in any minute. So charming. And there are a few older gentlemen crooning live which adds  to the ambience. \nOur waiter Brad was very knowledgeable with our food selections and had a wonderful, playful personality. Everyone in our party ordered a different entree and all agreed the food was delicious. \n Our limo was waiting promptly after we dined to take us back to our hotel. I  recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants delicious Italian cuisine and an unforgettable experience."

Tight quarters to say the least. Our server was Toni from Brooklyn and she was FABULOUS!! Made us feel like we were part of her family. It was loud to begin with and to top it off there was a server ( male ) tall guy that was extremely loud with his table next to us and he took about a dozen pictures constantly bumping us. At the end of the dinner, an African American man came over and asked us how everything was. We still don't know who he was as he never identified himself. Very creepy!! Kept staring at us.

I hate to say this about a place that I use to just love and thought that not only the food but the atmosphere was first rate.  Tonight ended my love affair with Casa.  This was the 3rd time over the past year that I was really disappointed with the food .  Granted the atmosphere still has people flocking to it but there are just to many fabulous restaurants in Vegas to go to and the quality in my opinion has really been compromised.  What did it.  To start with was the salad. In my opinion they must have prepared it well ahead of time and then refrigerated it.  Why, because the cheese and salami that make part of the base were basically frozen to the plate.  Yes, stuck and hard to peel away from the plate and finally when biting into it you could tell it was frozen.  Finally, the steak my wife ordered was way overcooked.  The waitress apologized but didn't make an effort to ask whether she wanted another.  Well, finally the service was slow as if they were understaffed.  We didn't complain about anything because we both knew that this was the end of an era.  I don't know whether ownership or management has changed but the quality has gone down hill and I haven't even mentioned my order."

Soothing songs and easy listening. George, the piano playing singer was quite talented and sang songs from the Rat Pack era. He took requests and sang them perfectly.  Families with young children were there and dancing to the music. It was a cute sight.  But the noise level is high and the wait for tables can be long though.  \nThey offer a large menu selection of traditional Italian dishes. Food portions were very good and the service was great. The stuff is very friendly and attentive. The cocktails were excellent. We ordered cocktails which were great and a bottle of prosecco which was cheaper than some wines in other restaurants.  Our main dishes included cioppino and scallops. The bread and garlic butter were great and we had appetisers of a tomato and mozzarella salad and calamari. Both were excellent and large portions. Dessert was outstanding as well: we enjoyed the exotic bombas. We highly recommend this special experience."

It was crazy how great the service was. I honestly wouldn't have even expected anyone to see that he had finished his drink since they had literally just brought it to us. \n\nWe ordered a wide variety of meals from lasagna to chicken parmesan to chicken marsala. Every single one of us LOVED the taste/quality of our meal. It was by far the best Italian food I have ever eaten.\n\nThe atmosphere was great. It's a small restaurant so there aren't an overwhleming amount of people and it has a very classy feel to it. There is live music playing old school songs (Sinatra for example) and the entire ambiance is very comforting.\n\nLastly, we ordered cannolis for dessert. These were also very delicious. Not to mention, the great service stated earlier was maintained throughout dinner.\n\nThis place was perfect.

We were dropped off by one of the hubbies and were going to have the staff call us a cab- but low and behold- they have a limo!!! We asked if they could take us the the strip after dinner and they could!  It was really fun AND the food was so good.  We had a few bottles of wine and the bill was still under $40 a person.  Plus, they gave us each a rose AND there was a lounge singer.  We felt like we were in a movie (Swingers was mentioned more than once).  What more could a group of hot mamas ask for?  I recommend this place if you are looking for something away from the crowds where you and your group can have a nice meal for a reasonable price."

            "review": "We like \"old school\" restaurants, especially in that old school town Las Vegas. The atmosphere here didn't disappoint, with the decor, the bar and the 2-piece music combo. The classic Italian food didn't disappoint either. It was excellent, hot and well-proportioned, just like everything in Vegas should be. However, we were within seconds of walking out at the beginning. Although we had a reservation, our table wasn't ready. We were asked to wait at the bar, where we were ignored for a long time. When I went up front to ask about our table, the hostess played dumb & said she thought we sat down to eat at the bar (we stood the whole time, are tall, and could easily be seen across the room). We were then told that a big birthday party was taking up a lot of tables and resources. Well too bad. You don't overbook your restaurant & shut out people with reservations. \n\nI was literally waving my car key in front of the hostess when we were finally seated. The Maitre d' then proceeded to shake my hand about 10 times to apologize, which I don't love if I plan to eat bread. He did give us free drinks & dessert as I recall. Still, it's better to get it right than to have to apologize for getting it wrong."

            "review": "Decided to go here based on reviews on Trip Advisor (instead of my original choice of Batista's Hole In The Wall), plus the Restaurant.com certificate, plus the fact they pick you up in a limo if you make reservations over the phone far enough in advance was what helped us make the decision to eat at Casa Di Amore. \n\nI arranged to have the limo pick us up at the Rio after \"The Rat Pack Is Back\" show (after the meal, he returned us to the hotel we were staying at, the Flamingo). Neither my mom or I had ever had a limo ride, so this was a good treat. The driver was nice and very chatty.\n\nWhen we got inside Casa Di Amore, the hostess took my name but acted like I hadn't made a reservation. Although it was Mother's Day, it was a Sunday night, at 10pm, and it was not busy, several tables were empty, but we still had to wait about 10 minutes. The entertainment was just packing up, so we missed that completely :-/\n\nOur waiter (I think his name was Bradley) was not very nice, in fact, he was a bit of a jerk. He was really short with us the entire time, and made several rude remarks to me.I think he saw my Restaurant.com certificate, and every restaurant we went to on this trip and used one of these, we got poor service from the waitstaff (which is ironic since they are guaranteed a bigger tip with one of these certificates)\n\nI have a lot of indigestion issues, and basil doesn't agree with me, so when at Italian restaurants I always order regular spaghetti w/ marinara sauce. I've never had an issue. But, this sauce had large strands of basil, as well as small chopped pieces of it. Also, the portion was puny, maybe about 1 cup of cooked noodles.\n\nMy mom got spaghetti w/ meat sauce and meatballs. Her plate had a HEAPING portion of food. I know she had meat sauce and meatballs, but there really shouldn't have been that big of a difference between our portion sizes. \n\nAnyway, I notice all the basil on my food and immediately start the long process of picking it out with my fork. I haven't even taken a bite when the waiter noticed and asks how our meal is, my mom asks him if they have a sauce w/o so much basil, even asks for the sauce from the kids menu, but he tells us this is their plainest sauce. He then tells me that he can swap it out for something else, but what else is there if this is their plainest sauce? \n\nI go on, and try to eat my spaghetti. I take a bite, and follow it with several gulps of water. My mouth HURTS. In the next 15 minutes I go on to take 3 more bites, but each one is more excruciating than the next. I feel like my lips are on fire. Waiter comes up to us again and asks how everything is, and I tell him I just cannot eat the food in front of me. \n\nHe tells me, \"you should have said something when I asked earlier.\" He pointed to my food, which originally was just about 1 cup of cooked noodles and I had only eat 4 small bites, and went on to say, \"its obvious you ate most the meal. What do you expect me to do? I can get my manager out, and I KNOW what he will say.\"\n\nI argue that I only ate 4 small bites, and my mom steps in asking if I could just get a small side order of plain noodles, then I chime in that I want no sauce that I'll just put a little parmesan on top. He says he can do that, but I'll be charged for it. What else can I do, I'm hungry. \n\nHe brought it, and I ate it just the way I said I would. It was fine, but I was still hungry, so I ordered Creme Brulee (& which comes with a free t-shirt). The Creme Brulee was good, still warm so I waited a minute or two or else the top wouldn't break just right. \n\nWhen he brought the check he pointed out my original meal's costs, then the side of noodle's cost, then he pointed out that he took off the cost of the noodle side, saying \"Because I'm just a nice guy\". Listen, when someone -- especially a waiter -- tells me that he's a nice guy because he's doing something that just basic customer service, you know they are just another jerk. Then he goes on to say, again, \"if I had told any of this to my manager, he would have charged you for that side. But, I'm saving you the trouble. I'm just nice like that.\"\n\nThe funny thing is, as I was paying the bill, my mom was outside smoking with the manager, and she said he was really nice. There's no way he would have charged me for that little side when I barely touched my meal.\n\nThe only time our waiter was truly nice to use was right before we left, when he saw me taking photos of the canvases of old Vegas, and he offered to take a couple of pictures of me & my mom. And when he brought my free t-shirt out, he brought several sizes so I could compare. That was the nicest he was the entire time we were there.\n\nI would go there again, for the limo ride and the atmosphere -- but not the food -- I'd go there for drinks and dessert, and watch my friends or family enjoy their meal, then I'd grab a bite at my hotel afterwards..."

The wner is entertaining, he plays instruments, sings to everyone and keeps the atmosphere very upbeat and fun.  We came with a big group from work and we were all apprehensive about the appearance and the location, but were we surprised.  The waiters were terrific, the place was filled with locals and the decor is that old school rat pack, Vegas as it used to be style, its really nicely done.\n\nI had the veal. Tammy the linguine & clams, we both shared and the food was great, portions were huge and the rest of the people we were with all had the same compliments.  The drinks were healthy and the wine list, although limited, was sufficient and well thought out.\n\nThis is the type of fun place, that the owner should be proud to own and as a patron, i was glad we were lucky enough to go in here.  I will definitely be back again and again and if we laugh 1/2 as much next time as we did last time, then it will be 2wice as much as we would have expected anywhere else.\n\nI could go on and on about this place, the food, the music, the fun, the people, the service, the friendliness and spirit - were a perfect combination and even as i finish this review, i wish i were there."

There was a tasty gluten free penne for one of us (she ate every bite!).  Another ordered the baked mostaccioli and it was also tasty and filling.  I wanted the Linguini with Clams but chose the Frutti Di Mare instead.  It was excellent.  Others in my party agreed it was the best choice at our table, although everything we ordered was flavorful.\n\nBefore dinner, we enjoyed the calamari appetizer with marinara sauce.  Simply awesome!\n\nComplimentary table bread was never offered, which is odd for an authentic Italian restaurant.  So we ordered garlic bread but didn't know it is made with melted cheese on it.  It tastes really good, but one of us could not eat cheese so we needed to order a second one minus the cheese. \n\nOur reservations were at 5:15pm, just after opening, so the restaurant was fairly empty.  They accommodated us to sit in a booth where we could watch the LA Kings play in the NHL finals during dinner.  Our server \"Toni\" was fun and attentive. \n\nThe restaurant is quite a distance from the Strip so they offer a pick-up service, which is convenient if you don't have your own vehicle.  The driver was right on schedule picking us up and \"Sig\" drove us to/from safely.  The wait to leave by limo was longer than expected, but we still made it to a show at the MGM on time.  Don't expect top of the line limousines.  For a driver gratuity of $3-5 per person, it is better than a taxi ride!\n\nIf craving good, authentic Italian food, we would eat there again while visiting Las Vegas."

What a great experience - felt like we stepped back in time to what Vegas was like (before we were of legal age to experience). Stephen (our server) was excellent and engaged us in conversation from the get go which is so key to experiencing great customer service today. The food was incredible. Music was amazing and made us feel like dancing - terrific singer/musicians playing old Vegas tunes. We started with calamari with the marina sauce (yummy) and an Opollo Zin wine together with the bread/evoo-vinegar. The Pasta allo Fordo was amazing, penne arbiatta the best spicy ness, and the kids has homemade chicken soup (Gma's recipe to die for), spaghetti/meatballs and fettuccine which were all great. The cannoli - lets just say this rivals a a famous baker who's jersey roots has a shop here in LV. Direct your orders here vs there!! Thanks Stephen."

With it being only about ten minutes from the strip and they have complimentary shuttle service it makes it a great option for people looking to dine off the strip. It is a predominately a locals spot, however, a great place for anyone. The decor here reminds of a place straight out of the rat pack era/ old Vegas era which is an awesome sight to see, as Vegas has changed so much since then. We generally choose to sit at the bar as they have video poker games. The bartenders and the rest of the staff are friendly we especially like Roshy. Our most recent time there were shared the mini osso bucco which was served on top of risotto. This dish was absolutely fantastic, and loved every single bite. We waited a little bit before ordering our entrees but when we did we split the veal francaise which was served with a side of pasta. This dish was one of the best plates of Italian food I have ever had. The veal was perfect and tender the lemon butter was delicious. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce that we chose for our pasta which was Alfredo was amazing. After gambling and drinking a couple more drinks they arranged for a shuttle to take us back to the hotel, and the driver was friendly and talkative. This is a must go place for great Italian food whether you reside in Vegas or just visiting make sure this place is on your list."

I made reservations with their complimentary limo service a little over two weeks in advance, just to be safe, but I think you could get away with reserving it the week of your visit. Our driver arrived promptly and was very friendly on the short trip to and from the hotel. Upon arrival at the restaurant, we were seated promptly and treated to exceptional service from our waiter, Stephen. He was very professional and extremely helpful, but also very personable and friendly -- he earned one or two stars on his own. (I had no idea about the pint chug challenge at the Aria, but thanks to Stephen, I'll be trying that on my next Vegas trip.)\n\nThe food was nothing short of delicious. I ordered the Chicken Caprese at Stephen's suggestion and my girlfriend ordered the house specialty, the Osso Bucco. Both dishes were tender, flavorful, and came in very large servings. Neither of us had room for dessert, though there were many tempting options on the menu. (It was challenging enough finishing our bottle of wine after all that food.)\n\nGreat ambiance. The live music was entertaining, the decor hearkened back to old school Vegas, and every staff member we encountered was wonderful. Could not have asked for anything more in this area.\n\nOne more note: while this place gets the $$$ by Yelp standards (upwards of $30 per person), it's fairly priced for a delicious Italian meal in a very fun environment.  Throw in the free limousine service, the discounts on wine bottles on Sun/Mon, and the exceptional waitstaff and it's unlikely that you'll be disappointed in your dining experience.\n\nWe'll definitely be bringing friends back with us on our next weekend in Vegas."

Go back in time with old fashioned homestyle red sauce Italian cuisine in huge portions, with a crooner singing Frank Sinatra songs on a PA system, and pictures of the 1960's strip as atmosphere. This is not modern Italian cuisine. However, prices are not 1960's.  $11 for one small canole - but, as the waited points out, you get a free T-shirt with a quote from the Godfather on the back (even if you don't want it).

I didn't feel like our server was trying to get money out of us, he truly seemed passionate about the food and was quick to offer recommendations without being pushy, which is a HUGE plus in my book. We shared the calamari appetizer, my boyfriend had the Linguine Luciano (warning VERY spicy) and I had Fettucine Alla Pappasito. Both were superb. This was a real treat, and I can't wait to come back! Not at all what I expected to find tucked off of Tropicana. Perfect date night location or place to bring the whole family. EXCELLENT!"

This cute little place was highly ranked among the rest.  It's located in a neighborhood a few minutes away from the strip.  My first impression of the restaurant was that it was very charming and the fact that it was away from the strip was great because it was a small venue but they were still able to accommodate is with no reservation.  The wait time was less than three minutes and everyone from the hostess, to the waiter, to the live band was amazing.  Everyone asked where we were from and they loved the fact that we were representing Hawaii.  The band even played a special song for us to help bring a little island comfort to the scene.\n\nI ordered the Pasta Alla Forno which is penne pasta tossed with chicken, shrimp, broccoli and mushrooms in a light pink sauce baked in the oven with fresh mozzarella, this dish was very delicious.  It's something that the waiter and I have never seen in any Italian Restaurant, I finished the entire plate! My hubby had his all time favorite, the Chicken Parmigiana.  He thought it was descent but felt it wasn't up to par with the other versions he's had.  He honestly felt that Olive Garden mastered that fish better than this place... My little sister had the Spaghetti with Meatballs.  It was amazing! The meatballs were so soft and juicy.  Both the Chicken Parmigiana and Spaghetti with Meatballs were both one pound plates! The two couldn't finish it... lol.  My mom had the Linguini & Clams which was fresh clams, both chopped and whole in your choice of either a red or white sauce over linguini.  She enjoyed this dish as well with no complaints.  My dad got one of the Specials that they were featuring that night, a Trio Sampler which had the Lobster Ravioli (GREAT dish), Shrimp (It was okay), and the Gnocchi which was homemade potato dumplings served with your choice of meat sauce (he ate every bite).  For dessert I had one cannoli, which was the first cannoli I've ever had in my life! IT WAS DELICIOUS! It even comes with a free shirt :) \n\nAll in all I have to say I would give this place five stars but because not everyone enjoyed there food as much as I did, I gave the overall venue four stars.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone that LOVES PASTA and isn't afraid to try something new.  I love trying different things and if you're one, this place is a MUST GO TO!!!"

I love the fact that they send a limo to pick you up at your hotel which is a big help if you do not have a rental car. You have to set it up in advance, but it is worth it since all you do is tip limo driver and saves you from paying cab both ways. I definitely recommend doing this. Upon arriving at the restaurant, we were shown promptly to our seats.\n\nWe went on Monday night which is 1/2 price bottles of wine. We chose a Risota Muscat d' Asti which was a great wine. We decided to try the garlic loaf on this visit as appetizer and it was great. Good Italian bread with rich buttery garlic sauce and melted cheese. Very tasty and something I would get again. The wife and I both added a Caesar salad to our entree which is only a $3 addition. What a steal. They make a very good Caesar here and you must get it when you dine. For entree I chose the linguine and clams with red sauce and my wife had the eggplant Parmesan. Both were really good and generous portions. For dessert we shared a creme brulee and it was pretty good. Nothing terrific, but tasty. Good thing is you get a free T-Shirt when you order a creme brulee or cannoli for dessert. \n\nService here is top notch. Waiters are very courteous and come by often to check on you. They pour the wine and fill you glass as needed. This is an old school place that is classy. There is a lounge singer and saxophone player there that provide entertainment while you dine. The place looks and feels like an old classy location.\nWe love coming here and it will probably be on our list to visit every time we come to town. If you are able to come and check it out, you will not be disappointed."

We had one night where we were going to splurge on dinner, so we wanted the second night to be more low key and less expensive.  I did a search on Yelp and found Casa di Amore and decided to try it.  As someone who grew up in Vegas, I really don't expect much of places that are \"off the Strip\", but I will definitely be going back here!\n\nFirst of all, the fact they have FREE limo service (although they do suggest you tip $5 per person per way) to and from the restaurant is awesome.  Granted, the limos look like they stepped out of 1992.... do they even make maroon limos anymore???  Our driver was really nice though, and impressed us at his ability to maneuver the traffic even though he was, shall we say, a mature old chap. :)  \n\nThe restaurant is this cute little brick building and seems a bit out of place on the street.  Inside, it is reminiscent of something you would find out of \"The Godfather\" (minus the guns and shooting).  \n\nAhhh,.... the food was SOOOO good.  We had to place a second order of the bruschetta - it was the best I've ever had.  We decided to order family style since there were five of us, and I'm glad we did because the portions were huge.  We got three dishes - the clam linguine, eggplant parmesan and I can't remember the third... but all were amazing.  Seriously - I highly recommend trying this place out.\n\nIt is a small joint so definitely make reservations before hand.  Also, allow plenty of time if you decide to use the limo.  We had tickets to see a show afterward and our limo driver ended up leaving to take someone else back to their hotel... we had to wait for twenty minutes for him to come back and barely made it to our show in time.  But our tummies were happy so we didn't complain too much. ;)\n\nThis place is definitely old Vegas in a good way, and worth a trip to try it out!"

It was so loud that it gave me a headache before we ordered the food.The prices are stupid high for what you get. $25 for a bowl of spaghetti with some crappy sauce & some red pepper flakes thrown in (no meat). Add $10 for 5 small Vandecamp style fried shrimps & $5 for a small & I mean small loaf of cheese bread.. I think this place is for stupid tourists that don't know any better. Any steak house at any Station Casino blows this hole out of the water.My wife & I went because our friend gave us a gift certificate. When the waiter realized that we were not impressed & we paid $80.00 of $100 gift certificate including a large tip, He through a $20 bill at us & said \"Lets call it  good\". I don't think they care about locals, they just want the big spending tourists."

Ever.  \n\nOk.. in a long time at least... and I'm sure they are cheaper to operate to draw the tourists in than it would be to have built that place on the strip and pay the strip rent premiums.  Pretty genius...   I still scoped reviews  to make sure I wouldn't regret giving up my holiday time to a restaurant with a limo if it wasn't worth it.  Needless to say the reviews were glowing and we booked our limo/reservation.\n\nLimo ride was fun.  Obviously retired by a regular limo company and bought by the restaurant as it's a little run down and not the height of luxury anymore... but it's still a sweet ride and we felt quiet VIP on a trip over the to restaurant.   Obviously the limo isn't REALLY free - you'll have to tip but it's still got to be less than a cab and way more awesome and a cheap way to have the limo experience in vegas. \n\nThe restaurant has some great atmosphere to it - very mobster and old vegas.  There was live music playing and it felt very romantic.  Everyone is very nice and service was top notch. \n\nI settled on garlic bread and the 1lb spagetti with meatless balls (yes... a whole pound... you'll need to share or take a doggie bag).  ZOMG - it was delicious!   I eat a lot of pasta and frankly the food is usually consumed and as quickly forgotten but this stuff was so good and completely stands out as great pasta.  Meatless balls were great - even my meat loving sweetie enjoyed them.  I wished I could have teleported the contents of my stomach out (or subsequently gone back in time 30 minutes while maintaining my memories) just to eat a second helping of both the bread and pasta. I ate way more than I should have and I'm not sure how I found room for dessert but I'm glad I did.   The cannoli was to die for (maybe not literally... can't tempt a mobster right?).  I've since read you get a t-shirt for ordering the cannoli but that wasn't offered to me that night so i'm not sure what the deal with that is :(.  The night we were there they had 50% off bottles of wine which was very good since the bottles were all reasonably priced to begin with and needless to say we left a little giddy for a couple reasons.   \n\nPrices are decent but not inexpensive and more than worth it.  You'll be able to find a couple promos and coupons around for these guys but you can't stack those on top of special pricing like discounted bottles of wine so I'd find a couple coupons and do some math to figure out the best promo for you on the day you go as sometimes the in restaurant deal might trump the coupons available.   With tips we still did better cost wise than a couple dinner buffets and drinks on the strip and had more fun and enjoyed the food much more. \n\nThe limo was ready almost immediately after we paid... everything was amazing and I can't wait to return next trip down there and tell all my vegas bound friends back home about this little gem."

This is an old school joint with large red booths where vintage Vegas posters and photos of Sinatra dress the walls. \n\nWarm bread got us started, an order of calamari ($13) followed. I love calamari when it's done right. When it's bad, it's BAD. There's nothing worse than deep fried rubber bands. No need to worry here, this calamari was tender and lightly breaded. The marinara sauce on the side was fantastic - well seasoned, not too acidic. I rarely find this to be the case. Needless to say, we devoured it so quickly I never snapped a photo. \n\nMoving on to entrees, we ordered two orders of Eggplant di Amore ($24). And the house specialty, Osso Buco ($35). I couldn't tell you which is better. They are wildly different, but equally delicious.  Eggplant di Amore has slices of eggplant layered  like lasagna with ricotta cheese, mushrooms, spinach and sundried tomatoes. It is served with a side of spaghetti.\n\nOsso Buco is classic Italian. They roast the veal shank to perfection, it falls off the bone. It's served with what I believe is an aged sharp cheddar risotto. It is unexpected and mighty scrumptious.\n\nI was much too full for dessert, but a canoli and tiramisu were ordered. The canoli is filled to order so the shell remains crisp and the filling is rich and not overly sweet. It was a surprise to learn a free T-shirt comes with any canoli order. Service was steady and pleasant throughout. Not a single complaint could be made. Casa di Amore is a winner."

Don't get me wrong the food isn't bad but for a salad it's $12 and a 1 pound pasta dish is $22. Not to mention my girlfriends and I split the 1 pound pasta dish thinking it would be plenty but it was teeny. We are hungry young ladies who EAT! We ordered the cannoli and tiramisu for dessert. Final verdict; it's average and the prices are high. For late night I encourage happy hour in which they have but only for pizzas."

The host and waiters treat customers like VIPs, reminding me of Vegas when I came here 25 years ago. Nice wine list too. And they serve food until 5am!\nThe biggest surprise was the food! I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and a caesar salad. I don't know what they do differently, but that caesar salad was amazing. Really, really great! I'm pretty sure I tasted more parmesan than I usually do, but there were some other seasonings in there too subtle for me to identify. Fantastic!\nThe single serving of spaghetti and meatballs was enough to feed a family of four, unnecessarily large. But despite that, and I can't believe I'm saying this, this was truly the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever tasted in my life! And I've had some of the best. I used to live i NY & NJ and I've travelled all over Italy. I certainly never expected I'd one day say the best spaghetti and meatballs I ever tasted was in Las Vegas.\nI wish I could afford to eat here often.

Added to that the fellow singing and playing the keyboard and his drummer kept getting louder and louder.  It was  impossible to have a conversation there.  I realize that the restaurant is not to blame (other than the singer/drummer), but it certainly made for a very unpleasant evening.  Food was good, but certainly nothing that special.

I'll do bad (maybe the good will make up for the negative). We made reservations 2 months in advanced at the time they had a limo service they offered to pick you up from your hotel to the resturant. (Hello bonus!) I loved this thought because it is quite difficult to get from one place to another one block in Vegas is very different from a normal city block. Anyway, we waited and limo never came (7:00) we called and they told us the limo broke down (a while ago) and that we will just have to catch a cab and they will pay for it (I was very understanding). Oh little side note we have been in Vegas a week now and this is the third place we've booked in Vegas that has called telling us their car or bus has broken down. So we got to the resturant around 7:20 they said they would sit us immediately (they didn't) we didn't get seated until 8:10 (reservations were at 7:10). Now this is we're I will stop and say that there was a huge factor in this they had a 46 (or some ridiculous number) of singing women (annoying as crap they were all drunk old women who claimed they sing in a group which I personally thought that was just a college sorority thing) party. Their reservation was 7:30 (we overheard). They got seated right away. Now I also learned the bus (they lost their limo a while back) had to pick some of these women up. Myself I have never worked in a resturant but I do have many many friends that do or have. I decided to text these friends while there (during my very long wait) and they all agreed that the party of 46 should've reserved the entire resturant (it was a pretty small place maybe 8 or 10 tables not taken over by these women) or the manger/boss/whoever should've personally reserved the resturant just for this party and not allowed any other parties in that night. Now the good news the food was great the service was amazing and I say this not because they had us wait so long and didn't pick us up but because I truly believe they have amazing service every other night. Personally if the party of 46 was not there that night it would've been a perfect night with great food and my review would be a tad shorter and five stars. The staff was very nice and wonderful people so I do not really blame anyone for what has happened tonight except for the group of 46. So in conclusion (cause I've basically wrote an essay hahaha) it was a terrific resturant very good atmosphere but for any groups of 46 please request the place to yourself for the night and for any mangers please allow them. Overall I would recommend to a friend and this review got good stars for the fact that tonight was not the restaurants fault (fully) but just bad timing and planning."

It was extremely loud and there wasn't even a band playing (yet). The place was PACKED. I mean packed, back to back, like a can of sardines. It was hard to maneuver oneself to even get up to go to the bathroom. It is a lively atmosphere though, if that is what you are looking for. However this is not a favorable choice to go to when meeting someone's parents for the first time to share a great meal with conversation. We had to yell across the table at one another. Funny stuff.\n\nNow onto the most important part. The \"cuisine:\"\n\nOk, I get it. We live in America where American Italian cuisine is heavily prevalent and this is Vegas so why not mix the two together? Casa Di Amore blends classic Italian American dishes with an old Vegas mob-style vibe to their restaurant. Dishes such as eggplant parmigiana, veal marsala, chicken marsala, baked lasagna, osso buco and the good 'ole spaghetti and meatballs are to be expected. \n\nFrankie, Dino and Sammie would be shaking their heads in disappointment at this place.\n\nWhen a customer sits down to a table, it is expected to have a waitress/waiter greet them  timely and get acquainted with the place. After we all sat down, it took anyone to come over to our table to order drinks, a good 15 minutes before we could order a couple bottles of their house wine. We were not served bread or anything.\n\nI eventually ordered the Eggplant Di Amore. I could not believe how DRY this dish was. It was intensely dry. Being that there was spinach, mushrooms and sundried tomatoes and umm...EGGPLANT...in a tomato sauce? This should not be so dry. As I cut into it, it was like cutting into a brick. \"Where are the mushrooms?..the spinach?...that sundried tomato flavor?...where is it?\" I was excited to try a twist on the classic dish but was severely disappointed. Not only was the eggplant parm dry but it was room temperature, overly salty to compensate for the lack of flavor. All I tasted was mozzarella that seemed like it was sitting there for a while and a solid hunk of nothing.\nMy mother had the Pork Chops With Vinegar & Peppers. She was excited since she grew up with this dish. At first bite, the pork chop was so tough I couldn't tear it off with my teeth from the fork! The weirdest part was that the pork had an extreme fishy taste to it! It was unbearable! \nMy mother's husband ordered a piece of chicken with a potato and veggies on the side...hardly memorable.\nMy sister ordered the Gnocchi Alla Prosciutto, which was one of the better dishes at our table. There was hardly any prosciutto in it and the spinach was \"missing\" again. I don't know if they make their own four cheese sauce but this one was especially bland.\nMy sister's boyfriend ordered the Veal Marsala. Ok I love marsala dishes. I even prepare in my own kitchen from time to time. The veal at Casa Di Amore was overly dry and not the tender suppleness that a great veal dish should be. The marsala sauce tasted nothing like a good marsala wine was used. I was actually disgusted.\nHis mother ordered the same and was greatly disappointed.\nWe also received our bread when we received our entrees! blasphemy!\n\nOn the ride home, we hopped back into the limo. The limo driver was a nice woman but we weren't told that we would share our ride with a couple of other parties. There was absolutely no lighting in that limo so we were neck in neck in the darkness with strangers. We had to wait to go home because the limo driver thought it would be fit to drop those people off first. It was about an hour wait to go home when we only live a couple streets over. The limo is complimentary, but still.\n\nOverall, the food here is not worth a second try.The classic marinara sauce in a place like this should be a signature. It is not here. For the price you are paying, the food is completely not worth it. I can find better quality for half the price, elsewhere. I am at a dismay at the hype of this place, but I suppose it is a good place to go to if your just subconsciously craving a pseudo-Italian American dish at the last minute....desperately. Ya know...that. \"I'm starving, I'll eat anything!!...let's go to 711 and get some nachos,\" mentality. The food was so bland, dry, too salty and their combination of flavors had no flavor at all. I've had a lot better experiences in Vegas with this type of cuisine. (Can I mention Buon Gustos? Thee Best!! Seriously, try it!)\n\nCasa Di Amore needs to be toned down a little. Maybe it's too busy for themselves to handle? Maybe they would put more effort and love into their food and serve fresh food otherwise. Suffice to say, we will not be returning here."

I've heard good things about this place and was sure to make reservations as it was a Saturday night. As we walked in, the host informed us they were running 10 minutes behind. It was a nice night so we decided to wait outside. After waiting 30 minutes, we went inside to check and were told there was one party in front of us. After waiting another 15 minutes, we went in to check again and the hostess told us that she had accidentally cancelled our reservation. No apologies were made for the miscommunication at which point we promptly left. I was extremely disappointed by this first impression and living in a town with so many great restaurants, I doubt I will give them a second look."

We agreed to take the available 545p seating, when we arrived, we were asked to wait at the bar until our table was ready which is never a problem for us.  As soon as we took a seat at the bar, a young girl approached me and handed me a rose and small box of chocolate which was a nice, cute little touch.  Before we could even order a drink our table was ready.  We were seated in front of the stage where live music was playing classic lounge tunes.  Our server, Robert came by and asked us if it was our first time visiting.  We told him it was and he responded with, \"this will be your new favorite restaurant\"  He told us about some of the specialties and took our drink orders.  While we were waiting for our appetizer, fresh sourdough bread came to the table served with butter and a shaker of parmesean cheese.  The bread was warm and delicious.  Our calamari came next and the calamari was good but what really made it was the marinara sauce that it came with, we could've eaten the marinara by the spoonful.  I ordered a cup of pasta fagioli which was full of flavor and so comforting :)  Entrees came out soon afterwards, I ordered the frutti de mare pasta with red sauce and my boyfriend ordered the lobster/shrimp ravioli special.  I finished every last bite of my dish.  We saved room for dessert and ordered the cannoli (with complimentary t shirt) and had a vodka martini and baileys coffee while we waited for dessert.  The vodka martini was so good, nice and dirty, I would've ordered another but was starting to get a little tipsy so decided to make martini's at home instead.  What we got out of this dinner, was a great Valentines Day Dinner date, a feeling of old Las Vegas, great ambience, excellent food and service and a new favorite restaurant, I guess that's why their motto is, \"Vegas, the way it used to be!  Leave the gun...take the cannoli\""

The Oso Bucco was perfect, tender, and packed with flavor. The risotto was very good, and the smoked sausage dish my wife had was great. We finished off with a creme brulee and a canolli, both were just as wonderful as the rest of the dinner. \n\nPerfect date night spot, or party celebration. Staff was very friendly.

We discovered this hidden jewel about 5 years ago on one of our many trips to Vegas and now a trip to Vegas is not complete without a visit to Casa Di Amore!! Not only is the food AMAZING, but the staff is as well.  We always get the limo and the limo drivers are great.  We have had just about every server they have there and they are all fantastic! Even though we only go twice a year (being out of towners), they remember us!!! That alone is amazing, that they can remember us out of all of the customers they serve. I love the fact that the ambience hasn't changed since the Rat Pack ate there.  That's what makes this place so special, the highbacked maroon leather booths, the wood paneling with all of the pictures of Old Vegas, my only regret is that the Rat Pack is not still alive to join us for dinner.  Someone else reviewed that this place smelled of smoke even though it's a no smoking restaurant. I don't know what they are talking about because I have never smelled smoke in this restaurant and I am very sensitive to cigarette smoke.  The food of course is the most important part and all I can say is FABULOUS!!! We have NEVER been disappointed in anything we've ordered.  Can't say enough good things about Casa Di Amore, this place is the BEST!!!"

The gentleman who does the entertainment/singing/piano is quite a character, he has a lovely voice and we enjoyed his music and spirit.  One of the highlights was him pulling his old friend, an actor/performer, on stage for an impromptu performance, very neat.  \nOur waiter, Tony (of course), truly made our evening; the wine recommendation from Cakebread Cellars was bang on - and because it was Sunday (& Mondays too) all wine bottles were 50% off, wow!  \nThe lobster ravioli special was incredible as was the pomodoro fresco.  The bruschetta was good, but we wouldn't order that one again.  Desserts were excellent, made in house and imported from Italy.\nThe ambiance, entertainment, service, food and wine were fantastic; we thoroughly enjoyed this fun, cozy and romantic evening; for that, we thought the prices were reasonable.  It cost us $24 for a cab from the strip to here, but they do offer a complimentary limousine that we may take advantage of next time - oh yes, there will definitely be a next time.\nA nice break from the high priced, fake, stuffy places on the strip."

Upon approaching the building, a man dressed nicely in a suit opened the door for my boyfriend and I. The moment we stepped inside, we were transported into a world of live music, Italian food, and great company. \n\nThe restaurant was definitely crowded, I mean come on it was a Friday night, luckily there was an empty table to we were seated right away. Our server Brad came right away to our table just to introduce himself and let us know he was already getting some bread ready for our table. Brad was very helpful through the night in helping us decide which meal would satisfy our taste buds.I opted to get the Frutti Di Mare with a cup of soup. My boyfriend chose the Veal Piccata with a cup of soup. \n\nThe Breakdown:\n\nThe soup was an Italian take on chicken noodle. The noodles were tiny little pasta balls served in a hot chicken broth with chicken chunks, carrots, and celery. \n\nThe Frutti Di Mare was the best I have had in a while. It came with huge mussels, clams, scallops, calamari,  and ginormous shrimp! The shrimp and mussels were definitely my favorite part of the dish. I have never eaten shrimp so tasty or huge before. All of this seafood goodness was served on a bed of linguine with your choice of red or white sauce. The server knew I wanted something a little spicy, so he offered to have the kitchen make the red sauce with some spice. My gosh that was the best decision of my life. It definitely made the dish perfect!\n\nThe Veal Piccata came served in a sauce with lemon, mushrooms, basil, and a hint of wine. In addition to that, it came with a small bowl of penne pasta in a marinara sauce. My boyfriend enjoyed the dish, but felt that it was a little too small for him (he eats A LOT, so it's perfect for those who want a normal sized portion). \n\nThe night was wonderful and the atmosphere made me smile the whole night. Hearing the live music made me feel like I was transported back in time. This is definitely a great date spot, so definitely try it out! They offer a limo service as well, so if you give them a call earlier in the day they can pick you and your date up! Definitely a way to impress your significant other! It's free of charge, but obviously leave a good tip!"

We were seated at a table in front of the band that plays soft, easy listening music.  There was a large table near us and they looked like they are from The Sopranos -- awesome!  The waiter was friendly and attentive.  We ordered the calamari to start - The waiter gave us bruschetta on the house because we waited slightly longer for our calamari but the wait was worth it. Calamari cooked perfectly and was lightly battered ..we have not had it like this since we lived in NYC.  The home-made marinara sauce was perfect!  I had the shrimp fra diavolo - delish!  My bf had spaghetti with meatballs and the marinara sauce - he finished it dry with the bread.

The staff was so friendly, the waiters and waitresses were extremely accommodating to our large group, the food was amazing. THE SINGERS! They sang some Chicago songs specifically for us as we are from Chicago and even let one of us get up there and sing a song too! Definitely some of the best service we have received. Would recommend to anyone!"

It was one of those places that kept getting skipped over, usually for somewhere newer or fancier.  Boy was I was missing out.  This is totally my type of place.  You walk in the door and are instantly transported to Old Vegas.  I had a drink at the bar while waiting for my friend.  They were playing Motown, the bartender was friendly and my drink (lemon drop) was great.  I could have hung out there all night.  I seriously want to become a regular here.  Eventually my friend arrived and we were seated in a large booth.  We started with a couple drinks, Chocolate Martini for me, Italian Gatorade for her.  Both were delicious.  For our mains we ordered the Famous Garlic Loaf, Penne Pesto and Baked Mostaccioli.  Food was fantastic.  I've been craving it ever since.  Service was good and before we left live music started playing.  This might be my new favorite restaurant."

It is very old school Italian, people even get up and sing along to the choruses of various popular songs when the singing duo comes out! The pasta was homemade and fresh. It was super busy but the waitress I had (Rochelle? Rebecca?) and the manager do everything they can to make you feel special and like you're the only one there! I truly loved the old school Italian ambiance however and all the Italian spirits and liquors. It's a great singles scene too, especially for the ladies as for once the men outnumbered the ladies by far!! My only regret is that I came here on the last night of my trip instead of the first!! Will be back again on my next trip to Vegas!!"

            "review": "So I thought long and hard about this review as I really wanted this to be one of the high lights of my trip. Tour guide suggested this as a local spot with home cooked food. Online they offered free limo service for the strip hotels so I booked about 2 months in advance. My pickup time was 7pm with dinner at 7:10-7:15 (this is what the girl on the phone stated when I booked).  The day of the reservation we got out side about 6:50 and at 7:05 when no one came I called the restaurant. They stated that they were trying to call me all day and that they had a party of 46 that they gave our table to to accommodate them. I stated that I never received a call and I gave them my phone number. The guy on the phone said that the number was written down incorrectly. That should of been the clue to not go but I had a gift certificate and the guy on the phone after several apologies stated that if I got a cab the restaurant would pay and they would seat us as soon as we got there. So ok we got there and could tell the dinning room was small and filled!!  The hostess seamed new and I gave our name several times as she was trying to add us to the 46 party. A guy came over greeted and apologized for the mixup, took my receipt for the cab and said we would be seated shortly. We walked over to the bar and ended up waiting about 45 min. At that point we moved back to the hostess station as I felt we were forgotten. About 15 min later and more headache we were seated.  The waiter was the best part of the dinner he was friendly and engaged.  The (I guess) manager came over apologized again for the mix up and offered us dessert.   Now if that wasn't enough there was a 2 man band playing that was also very good and I could of sat there for hours drinking wine and listening to them however at one point the restaurant let the organizer of the 46 sing and than speak to their group. At that point all the other tables were told by their tables that we had to be quiet and constantly heard (sssh) (sssh).  We got our food and it was ok.   But at the end of the day with everything else that happened here did not live up to my expectations.  I get it was 46 people and they didn't want to loose that bill but they should of just closed the restaurant for a private party especially since they literally took over the restaurant!!  With that experience I wouldn't go back."

Always fantastic food, a great bar, live entertainment with crooner singing the staples from old Las Vegas, and deserts that are made fresh and  make you wish you hadn't eaten so much of the fantastic Italian cuisine prior.\nIf there's a wait, no worries, just walk next door and shoot at the range for a while.\n\nAll in all the best Italian in Las Vegas."

Tony was our waiter. Very friendly and knows everything on the menu. He provided Exceptional servive. Ill probably ask for his section the next time im in there. He told us about the !/2 price wine bottles.. We ordered a penot noir form oregon that wsa great. He told us about the specials and one of them jumped right out for me. Tenderloins with gnocchi in a white gorganzola sauce. I odered that and my girlfriend ordered a penne and veggie dish adding sausage to he. Both dishes had great flavor to them. we started off with the \"prawns\". Never tasted shrimp like that. perfectly baked. The sauce is a little on the sweet side but still worth adding on. The mussels in marinera were so good we were dipping our bread in to eat like a soup. Having eaten a whole lot didnt have much for desert. but when Tony informed me that its shipped from italy and light, I had to try the cherry bomba. He was on the money again. Full and happy we hung out for a few and listened to music. not once did it feel like they were trying to get us out the door. perfect setting. Even better service. I highly recommend this place. You wont be dissapointed!!!!!"

Nice way to start the evening. $$$\n\nReally, this place is awesome.  From the drinks, the food, the live music, and service.  I had the Veal Parmesan.  It was terrific.  GF had the Lobster Ravioli, #2 Daughter had the Cioppino.  We shared the Fried Calamari and a Antipasto Salad.  There was so much food!\n\nPerfect old Vegas style without being cheesy.  Take the one you love to Casa Di Amore.  It's a classy move.  We'd go back in a minute.  Loved this place!"

The waiters have always been what seem to be handsome Italian men and the most fun servers. This place reminds me of a venue that would be in a mob movie. Has live talented music. \nThe food is some of the best I have tasted. The Garlic Loaf is to die for! Alfredo is my favorite. And the limo ride to and from the restaurant is complimentary with a tip to the driver.\nFOOD ALLERGY- I was planning a small party here and they offered to get special ingredients so all who had food allergies could enjoy the food."

The Ceasar Salad was good. I could taste the anchovy's in the dressing. The entree was Veal Marsala. This was to die for.  Thin slices of perfectly cooked veal in this mushroom gravy.

My drink never ran empty, dishes were cleared promptly and the server was gracious. \n\nThe live music was a nice touch. I arrived around 6pm and the place was pretty empty but by 7:30pm the place was packed. It was quite loud which made for a good atmosphere and since I was by myself it didn't really bother me but it might be hard for people trying to have conversation. \n\nThe lobster ravioli and Caesar salad were good, as was the warm bread. The exotic bomba, which is tropical sorbet in a white chocolate shell was quite delicious. \n\nThe reason I gave four stars instead of five was the shrimp scampi. It was just ok. I love shrimp scampi and this just didn't hit the spot. Maybe next time I would stick to a standard pasta and sauce dish. Based on the service and all the other items I would recommend it and would go again."

We got a tip from a shoe salesman at the Outlet Mall. He suggested Casa Di Amore on Tropicana. \n\nIt was beyond our expectations! The place was full of Old School ambiance and charm. Yet it was a place that was comfortable for families with young children and other people  \"dressed to the nines.\" Oh, did I mention that there was a musical combo there, too? George, who played the key board, to me favored Sinatra when he sang, and Paul who played the drums and also sang added a real personal touch by making friends with all guests in attendance during the breaks. At the end of the first set, we were all friends.\n\nBut let's not forget the food and service. Tony was our waiter and helped us navigate the menu and drinks list. There was nothing rote about his service. He allowed my wife to sample two wines so she could decide what to order (she is not a drinker) and modify her dinner salad as she does not like certain lettuce types. The entrees we fantastic. I had the Linguini and Clams, and my wife had the special Lobster Ravioli. Both I recommend. We had coffee drinks instead of deserts.\n\nI can understand why there were a number of \"regulars\" there this Sunday night not just enjoying the food and music, but engage the whole restaurant staff as well. If I lived in Las Vegas I'd be a regular, too."
