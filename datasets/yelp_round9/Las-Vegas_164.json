The steaks were amazing with the chimichurri sauce they marinate them in...everything was great, really enjoyed it. For those of you who don't know, Botero is a Colombian artist (painter, sculptor) and he opened this restaurant. i was expecting a little more Colombian flare to it, but he managed to put just enough and make it a really nice experience. i'd definitely go back again."

            "review": "My business associate and I visited Botero on the last night of our 3 night stay at the Encore. We had a great meal at SW and decided to try what we were told was the best restaurant at the hotel. We were impressed by the atmoshere and prompt attention by the hostess. We were seated within 5 minutes of our arrival and greeted promptly by  Jen, our waitress. I chose the caprese salad and the petite filet with a side of marshmellow yams. My associate chose the bone in ribeye preceeded by himachi and the sauteed mushrooms. In one word....awesome! Everthing was prepared perfectly delivered promptly and the presentation was impressive. The dessert topped off a fantastic meal. The chocolate candy bar was a chocoholic's dream. Highly recommended"

            "review": "The ambiance is great, the drinks are AWESOME, the service is decent, and the food is way overpriced but nicely presented.  It's not as pretty as Gordon Ramsey.  It's not as tasty as David Burke's.  It's just another nice place to eat in another nice casino.  We got the filet mignon which was a little undercooked, the rib eye which was really fatty, the best mashed potatoes I have ever eaten and then topped it off with a scoop of ice cream that came with 5 toppings - marshmallow, brandied cherries, caramel and pecans, Valrhona chocolate balls, and soggy strawberries.  The dessert presentation was beautiful but I swear the ice cream at Baskin Robbins is 100 times better and only a fraction of the cost.  So 2 meals, one side, one dessert and one drink came out to $170 - not majorly expensive, but not worth it either."

We started with their amazing house bread basket with a ricotta and lemon infused olive oil spread - absolutely delicious! We ordered the chilled prawns (well worth the $6 per prawn), crudo sampler (the tuna and salmon were my favorite), 2 lb lobster stuffed with shredded crab meat (loved even more with some fresh lemon), seasonal mushrooms, and Yukon gold whipped potatoes (this is heaven in a mini skillet).  As far as portion size, between three girls, we weren't able to finish all of this food! What a top notch experience! I can't wait to go back again when I return to Vegas!"

As they say, third time is the charm. \n\nNeeded a late dinner spot this past Thursday night and options were limited so we ended up at Botero. Wow....something here has changed and all for the better. \n\nAtmosphere - I've always loved the feel of this place. Contemporary, warm and slightly elegant, but still casual. \n\nService was spot on. Our server and the wine manager were helpful and attentive and both made some excellent recommendations. \n\nThe food was pure gluttony. This was the line-up...\n\nStarters were all great...\n\nBone Marrow\nWagyu Tartare\nSeared Foie Gras\nCaesar\n\n2nd Course\n\n6 onces of certified A5 Kobe, sliced thin for the table to share. F#*k!ng amazing. \n\nBone in rib eye, Argentina style - I usually love a traditional preparation, but this was ridiculously good. \n\nGreat wine selection. Enjoyed a 2001 Bryant and 2006 Scarecrow. Wow...big wines to go with an over the top dinner. \n\nDefinitly back on the Vegas short list..."

            "review": "Located in the Encore, Botero, named after the Colombian artist Fernando Botero, houses much of his beautiful artwork, complete with a sculpture of a voluptuous woman in the middle of the restaurant.  We luckily got a great table right by the statute and facing the grand Encore Beach Club pool.  \n\nWe trekked all the way from the Golden Nugget (we went to see one of Gallagher's last watermelon smashing shows), so we were starving and were going for any appetizers.  I got the petite filet, 8 ounces, with the chimichurri preparation.  The BF got the Bone-In Ribeye which came with a trio of sauces.  The filet was cooked perfectly, but I did not care for the chimichurri sauce.  The sauce was not flavorful at all, it was more of a dry-rub.  I have had better chimichurri at a backyard BBQ.  The BF's ribeye was much tastier than my filet and the three sauces were an interesting touch.  For our side, we got the truffle mac and cheese, which was good, but not as decedent as I expected. \n\nThe ambience and of course, my company, was amazing.  However, for being the Encore, I was just not impressed.  It is definitely not something to write home to mom about."

Beef carpaccio was very good but could have done without the sweet sauce over it.  Beef marrow was tasty and rich, served with tasty toast.  Grilled octopus was a bit overcooked which made it a tad chewy but overall very good.  Steak was very good but not excellent, a bit chewy and salty for my taste."

Ambiance is meh..\n\nI am a Botero fan, having been to his museum in Bogata and really appreciating his take on human size.\n\nWe shared one appetizer, one salad,one entree and two sides. \n\nThe stuffed calamari, which was poached (I think), and was tasty and well done.  The salad was probably the freshest I have had,.the wedges were super crispy, and the blue cheese and pork belly were a great addition.\n\nThe new York strip was huge, and perfectly cooked.\nThe Mac and cheese and broccoli sides were ok, nothing fabulous.\n\nThe bread was unique, with a basket of cranberry bread, pretzles and mini baguettes.\n\nI had a blueberry cosmo which was perfectly done, and way too easy to drink."

Verified with the Hostess at 8pm that they would still be open after the 9:30 Le Reve show lets out.  Hostess confirmed that they would be able to accommodate us even at such a late hour and they did!  \n\nOrdered drinks from a IPAD list.  Bread, especially liked the buttery pretzel bread, and a Watermelon Palette cleanser brought to the table.  Nice...\n\nSig other had two starters.. Crudo Plate and Grilled Octopus as she wanted to eat light.  Both excellent.  I had Foie Gras as a starter and the Branzino for entree.  Both well prepared.  We were quite impressed although I wanted to try the Summer Tasting Menu for more variety.  The tasting menu is not available after 10pm.  Too bad..,,still elegant dining with excellent service.\n\nWe closed with Cappuccino and a Latte with complimentary Petit Fours.  Last table of the night...thanks for accommodating us!"

We were with a big group so it was not romantic but it was still a great time. We all shared a couple of bottles of the Pinot Noir (can't recall the name) and loved it.  Food wise we ordered for appetizers the crab ravioli, the octopus, broccolini, tater tots and the tuna tartar. We thought all of it was delicious (even the tots). For dinner my husband had the Halibut and I had the Waygu Short Rib. Both were very flavorful and filling. This place also has a vegan menu that sounds incredible too. I hope to return to this place and actually try the steak that they are known for. Our visit here was a bit last minute. We really enjoyed our experience here and look forward to returning again!"

            "review": "This is my first review and it honestly took a horrible experience for me to post this. We went to Encore this weekend for my friend's 30th birthday party. They called the hotel and were told that Botero was the BEST restaurant at the hotel, so they booked us dinner there. We arrived at 8:15 for our 8:30 reservation and were told by the 4 hostesses that our table would not be ready until 8:30. As we looked around, there had to be 5 tables open that would have seated the 8 of us. At 8:30, they finally sat us at our table. We were put at the table and nobody came to greet us with menus for at least 5 minutes. Finally our waiter came to bring us a menu and ask for drink orders. We then waited at least 20 minutes for him to show up with drinks and offer us the specials. We finally placed our order and I could not wait to eat. I ordered the Short Rib with Potato puree. My husband ordered the Petite Fillet and Truffle Mac and Cheese. We also ordered the Botero Fries. I ordered a glass of wine with dinner. When dinner arrived 30 minutes later, the waiter never came back to check on us. I was waiting for someone to check on us and we were passed up by the manager at least 4 times and he ignored us and sped on by to the kitchen. Needless to say, my wine NEVER arrived. Finally we flagged down a manager who really did not seem very interested in getting me anything at all. We all were pretty much wanting to move on to XS at this point so we asked for the check. Did I tell you we TOLD them it was our friend's 30th Birthday? No birthday dessert. I saw many other tables get this mini ice cream cone desert, but apparently they forgot ours? I guess he was glad the 20% was added to our bill automatically or he probably would not have been given a tip. We will never return here."

She was helpful but not intrusive, led us to a great wine selection with ease, and served several tables yet made us feel like we were her only guests. I also appreciated that she didn't have an ounce of pretentiousness like I've experienced at other strip steakhouses. My steak was seasoned and cooked to absolute perfection. We also enjoyed the truffle Mac and cheese and corn br\u00fbl\u00e9e - both were rich and delicious.\n\nMinus 1 star for appetizer and cocktail selections. I wasn't tempted by any of the selections here."

If we did this well with just apps, imagine what the meal would have been like if we ordered the full on?!  Shrimp and chips w/ mango, dungeness crab agnolotti with artichokes and lemon emulsion (could have EASILY ordered another order!), baby beet salad with warm goat cheese, and the jalapeno glazed carrots (which tasted like they were dipped in maple syrup-yum!).  The dining room was beautiful and had great energy, as it is next to XS and overlook the gorgeous pool.  A meal here is a guaranteed fun night out!"

It was well worth the price; their prices are decent and you will definitely get what you pay for. Dessert was delicious; I got surprised with Milk Chocolate Bon Bon Lollipops with \"happy birthday\" written out in chocolate fudge! Yum!

It melts in your mouth and reminded me of the Kobe beef I had in Kobe, Japan.  The size of this slab of meat is humongous considering I don't eat a lot in one sitting.  This is definitely a plate to share to get a taste of perfection.\n\nCRUDO TASTING\nIf you like sashimi, you'll enjoy this 9-piece appetizer.  Expect 3 slices of tuna, and 2 slices of all the other varieties each garnished with sauces.\n\nDUNGENESS CRAB AGNOLOTTI\nIf you love crab, order it!  There are two crab cakes in this appetizer.\n\nNow on to recommendations for sides (LARGE portions to share):\n\nTRUFFLE MACARONI & CHEESE\nAlthough I'm not big on cheese, everyone else in our party loved this side.\n\nWILD MUSHROOMS\nLOVED these wild mushrooms!

Being Botero one of the most renowned Colombian artists it was obvious we were going to have our special dinner in Las Vegas at this place. The art (Botero's) and the ambiance of the restaurant are exquisite and so is the food. Our waiter was helpful and charming during most of our dining experience. However, when I requested Colombian coffee he was quick to answer that they did not offer it because \"Italian coffee is better\". Well, I had told him about my connection to Colombia and about the reasons why we had chosen the restaurant. However, he did not apologize for his poor comment. He also added that \"they\" don't believe in Yelp. I hope \"they\" review customers' comments and become believers."

I understand why these steaks come with 3 different sauces. The meat was just to dry and rough. No juices flow after cutting and I really had the dip the sucker for taste, but I did like the middle spicy sauce.

First of all, the service was impeccable. Menu items were well explained and they were very accommodating, as they should be for those prices.\nThe food was amazing. We ordered chateaubriand and it was done perfectly and very flavorful. The rest of the food was equally delicious. I drank a cosmopolitan, which was perfectly done, and then an espresso martini with dessert. If I hadn't been stuffed full I could have drank several of the martinis. Dessert was a treat in and of itself.\n\nOh, and the paintings of men in the women's bathroom were just funny. Hubby says there were similar pictures of women in the men's bathroom."

I came here for my aniversary with my bf, and when I called to make reservations they asked if it was a special occasion. The ambiance to this place is beautiful. We started off with the hamachi tartare ( which was soso). I should of stuck to what I usually get, the tuna tartare  which the table next to us did and it looked much tastier than the hamachi one. For the entree we shared the Chateubriand for 2, and it turned out to be a lot of food. For sides, we got the truffle mac and cheese, which I thought was too much of a truffle taste. We also ordered the tator tots which were really good. \n\nWe got the bread pudding for dessert, and we both finished it down to the last drop because it was so yummy. They had so many cool looking desserts like cupcakes and ice cream sandwhiches but they each came with like 5 each, and since it was just us 2, we didnt want to overdo it. After dessert, they brought out a plate that read 'happy aniversary' in chocolate and 2 chocolate covered strawberries. I think that was my favorite part to this meal since it was a personal touch to a nice celebration."

I was optimistic about the food, but it just did not deliver.  This may be because we were ordering off the Supper Club menu, but it just wan't very good.  We dined tapas style with french fries and homemade ketchup, pork belly sliders, kobe beef sliders, and other forgettable dishes.  None of the dishes were bad, but then again none of them were really good either.\n\nI wouldn't do it again.  It was a comped dinner and I still wouldn't do it again.

We ordered the strawberry shortcake for dessert and they sent us these complimentary vanilla bean ice cream pops with hazel nut chocolate for our anniversary.  Both were amazing!  The service was good and the decor of the restaurant's really nice.  My only complaint is that when I called to make a reservation they said the only time available was 6pm and I wanted to dine at 8pm.

My husband had the salmon which was good, but we both agreed the steak was the showstopper of the evening. \n\nWe ordered two sides: whipped potatoes and whipped sweet potato topped with marshmallow and infused with vanilla flavor.

We ordered wine all night and ran up a huge bill, including a steak for two (as I remember, it was the special, some sort of a bone in ribeye with special seasoning and crab? -- this was a year ago) that I shared with my friend.  First of all, the food took forever to come out.  Like over an hour, during which time we could have been at the club.  Got there about 8, ate around 10.  When it did come out, the steak was well done (ordered medium rare).  The thing was like 120 bucks.  It tasted like something you could cook in your oven for 15 bucks from Ralph's.  Just awful.  Sending the thing back was not an option because the group was going to the club and was already into their meals.  We ate a few bites, and asked them to comp it.  The waiter said they would.  Check comes out (keep in mind this check was well over 1000 dollars) and they didn't comp.  Complained to the manager, he said that they wouldn't comp it but that they could make another one (once the whole group was done eating and it was obvious this wasn't an option for us).  Flat out refused to comp or even discount the steak, and didn't provide free desert, or anything else.  Worse, when the first manager was explaining the situation, another douchebag came out and started yelling \"what's the problem here\" embarrasing us in front of the entire group. Obviously this place thrives on one time visitors - tourists - and doesn't care if you come back or not.  Total scam - stay far away from this place."

When you enter Botero look at the bar to your right, in the back on the wall and covering part of the ceiling are different sized clear bottles with different colors in each making an awesome piece of art you wouldn't expect. The restaurant seating area is one large circular room with windows all around overlooking the outdoor pool area of the hotel. It's one of the most functional restaurants I've ever seen. With all the lush tableclothes, big quilted looking pillars, funky artwork, and comfy white chairs with hints of black, the decor is still polished and romantic. \nThe hostesses were very welcoming and nice when we arrived. The lady who took us to our table was also very courteous, using our last name and pulled out our chairs for us.\nOur waitress was super sweet and very knowledgable on all items of the menu. The busser was also very attentive to our needs and was on top of everything from clearing plates to never letting our glasses go empty, etc. \nOn to the food..well they first bring you a basket filled with bread. At most restaurants I feel like the bread they serve beforehand isn't worth the calories, but this was delicious bread. There was white rolls, rolls with olives, and my favorite rolls with cranberries-sooo great. I shared a caprese salad next which they split onto two plates and it was the perfect size to keep me from filling up too much before my actual dinner came out. Then for my entree I had the dayboat scallops with wild mushrooms and polenta tortellini. The scallops were slightly breaded and cooked to perfection with a wonderful, wonderful brown sauce all around. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!\nIt was an excellent meal in an excellent and beautiful restaurant. I love the Encore restaurants!"

(Yes, they have a vegan menu)\nAmazing ambiance, love the art, great food, and really good drinks! Definitely on the pricey side, but oh so worth it. \nI will be back for more!"

            "review": "The choices in Vegas made it quite daunting but we decided to eat my birthday dinner at Botero before seeing Cirque du Soleil Love.  Our waitress was great, helpful and present but not overbearing.  \n\nFirst out of the kitchen was a trio of breads: cranberry, olive, and plain.  Mmm the cranberry was delish with a little of their herb/olive oil butter.  The olive was also tasty even though I'm not an olive fan.\n\nMy date had the rack of lamb which we both thought wasn't all the fantastic.  The meat had a mushy texture quite unlike anything I had every tasted.  His sides were verts (standard) and white beans (he liked these).  I decided on a pepper cooked filet that came with 3 dipping sauces: a jalapeno sauce, peppercorn sauce, and tomato-y sauce.  The first two were great and I alternated between them, the third not so much for my taste.  I also ordered a side of loaded potato gratin.  best decision!  I love me some scalloped potatoes (as anyone who's been to a superbowl party at our house knows) and these were just like the waitress said, each bite had a flavor of everything you put on a loaded potato, sour cream, chives, butter, and even some extras like cheese and onions.  mmm mmm good.  \n\nThen came dessert, we had told them that it was my birthday but I wasn't even thinking about them giving me a birthday dessert when I saw ice cream cupcakes on the menu and was intrigued.  They did bring out a plate with Happy Birthday written in chocolate and a very small piece of one of their desserts but I was glad I ordered my own because they were a skimpy with the free dessert!  My date got the brownie with iced mint milk (simply mint ice cream).  He was very satisfied, I did not even try it because I had enough on my plate with the cupcakes.  The menu said \"childhood favorites\" for the flavors so I was expecting vanilla, chocolate, strawberry but in fact I received 5, or was it 6 different cupcakes each cake a different flavor with small wedges of flavored ice cream, a dollop of some sort of whipped topping.  They were quite filling and I would recommend sharing them and wish the waitress had suggested it.  The flavors seemed to be banana, strawberry, lemon, orange, spearmint/chocolate.  I was excited for the one that looked like mint/chocolate flavor but was quite disappointed when it tasted like doublemint gum.  It just wasn't what I wanted and was overpowering.  I appreciate the pastry chef was trying to be different but it didn't work for me like a classic mint would have.  \nMinus a star for the poor rack of lamb texture and the flavor of the spearmint cupcake.  I would not go back here with so many other places to try and choose from in Vegas but overall a nice meal and I left quite stuffed and happy"

Since it was lunch time, we got to sit outside, near the Encore pool. \n\nThe covered patio is nice: I liked being able to eat outdoors in Las Vegas without sweating my buns off. \n\nThe guy ordered the Kobe burger, which I thought was absolutely delicious. My turkey panini, on the other hand, was lacking in flavor and in texture. The bread was a bit to chewy and dry, so it was hard to swallow without gagging a little bit. I think the sandwich could have used the help of some cheese or something saucier than their aioli. \n\nMaybe their dinner is better than their lunch, but I don't think I would go out of my way to come back to Botero... okay, maybe for their burger."

We enjoyed the outdoor seating the 1st time, we decided to bring some friends on this trip and treat them to this fabulous dining experience.\n\nI was disappointed that we did not get to sit outside for our dinner.  the hostess said they \"are not opening the patio tonight\".  I wish i had known that in advance so I could have made other arrangements for a different restaurant.  I had made our outdoor reservations a month in advance.  Sitting outside meant everything to the ambiance of our evening event and although I tried, the hostess wasn't budging.  \n\nHowever, they made up for it by giving us VIP seating.  Our table is where Steve Wynn sits every other week.  It is his table which made us feel special.  Of course we told the server, if Mr. Wynn should come in to have him sit with us and we would treat him to a wonderful meal.  =)\n\nThe food of course was magnificent.  Steaks tender and family style sides complement the meal very well.  I would expect no less than a fabulous place from the Encore.  The cocktails were so-so, but they did not have B&B.  The staff actually went out to get B&B for one of the members in our party.  now THAT is good customer service.  \n\nKnocked off a star just for missing out on our outdoor seating,  having average cocktails and high priced.  \n\nOther than that, I would definately be back again."

            "review": "Ambiance, yeah it's got lots of that to make up for the mediocre steaks.  My wife and I went with two other couples expecting a 4-5 star restaurant quality steak.  My friend was especially exited on trying their wagyu beef, which he has had before at other steak restaurants.  Overall I believe everyone was a bit disappointed in the quality of the steak.  We had a late reservation, 9:30 PM, so we could dine after a show.  I ordered the bone in rib-eye which is my go-to steak of choice at any fine steakhouse.  I ordered it medium-rare with the Pepper-Style dipping sauces...because they sounded interesting (not that a steak should ever need sauce); the steak arrived about 1/2\" thick and cooked all the way through...I would say medium-well.  No one came by to see if our steaks were prepared correctly, the lighting was dark and there was no offering of a small flashlight to see...so I used my phone to double check an it was cooked all the way through for sure...no pink.  This was unacceptable so I told the waiter.  The waiter then brought the manager over, she was very unapologetic and said that that is how medium-rare should look.  This was funny to me...there was no sear on the steak, it looked like it was baked in the oven or something (everyone at the table said I should send it back because of the lack of sear).  Anyhow, she finally agrees to get me another steak...I promptly say to make sure that it's seared on the outside like everyone else's.  She actually agrees with me.  A few minutes later she arrives very sorry to say that this is the last rib-eye they have.  At this point everyone is almost done and I didn't want to bother as it took way to long to get the steaks to the table in the first place.  \n\nI believe that steak was the last one for a reason...it was tough and thin and had a bunch of connective tissue running through it...not like any prime steak I have ever had.  My wife had the filet mignon, she liked it with the Chimichurri preparation...I tried some and agreed it was a good filet and the prep had a good flavor, another person had the filet prepared \"Simply Grilled\" and they said it was only OK.  Both filets were prepared as asked.  My buddy ordered the Snake River Farms Gold Grade Special Cut, which was advertised as an \"American Wagyu Beef\", now my friend has had the real thing from Japan and it's quite rich, and has had, and actually preferred, an Austrailan Wagyu to the Japaneses style that he had had in the past...It came out and was jsut ok like the other steaks...nothing special at all.\n\nThe best thing we had was the Ahi Tuna Tartare and the Wild Salmon Ceviche...both of these starters were fantastic.  The sides that came with the main course were lame, the mushrooms had no flavor and the Tater Tots were uninteresting...Everyone like the Twice Baked Potato...I did not try it.\n\nOverall the service was 2 stars, the Ambiance was 4 stars, the food was 2.5 stars.\n\nStick to SW Steakhouse if your are at the Wynn."

Upon arrival, we were seated at a beautiful table in the outdoor patio area -great for people watching because it's located right outside of XS Nightclub (so you get quite a bit of foot traffic) yet it still feels very intimate & romantic at the same time. \nWe started out with the Shellfish Tower Appetizer which was an absolute delight. The presentation was incredible, from the Chilled Prawns to the Maine Lobster, King Crab Legs & Oysters...Eyerything was fresh & delicious, served with delicious dipping sauces. What an incredible way to start the evening! Next we tried the Kobe Short Rib Ravioli...WOW...SO Delicious! The savory richness of the kobe beef paired with the freshly rolled pasta & shaved parmesan cheese was outstanding & really hit the spot. We also shared the Brussel Sprout Salad with Crispy pork belly, marcona almonds & parmesan cheese. Everything we ordered was SO YUMMY!!!\nInstead of a main course we decided to save room for dessert, and opted for the \"Baked Alaska\" with Lemon Semifreddo, Madeline Cake, Orange Marmalade and Grapefruit Foam. Almost too pretty to eat...but not quite. - See more at: http://thesuiteworld.com/dining/botero-restaurant-las-vegas-lasvegas-dining-wynn-encore-dining/#sthash.tp8mcg9t.dpuf"

Lol. It was really cute because we all had tiaras waiting for us as we sat at our table. I was just there for the food because the whole princess thing is so not me, but I thought it was fun nonetheless.\n\nThe promotional dinner included a whole list of appetizers and a huge fish bowl of this delicious drink for all ten of us to share. It wasn't a very potent drink but it was really good. I have to find out what they put in it and try to make my own version at home.\n\nThe appetizers we tried included some sushi rolls, meatball and Kobe sliders, salad, fries and a few other things. The food was not bad, it was just okay. My favorite were the Kobe sliders, cooked perfectly with a pink center topped with cheese and caramelized onion on a sweet roll.\n\nThe service was excellent, they did a great job of making us ladies feel special and we all received a rose at the end of our dinner. It was kind of like one big bachelorette party. The whole restaurant was filled with ladies all decked out in their clubbing attire. I guess they do this on Wednesday nights and they take the girls to Surrender nightclub for some after dinner drinking and dancing. I'm not sure how they make money from these things but hey, I get to enjoy it so I don't think about it too much. Maybe its because of the fact that guys will show up anywhere theres a lot of hot young women.\n\nAll in all, everybody had a wonderful time. The restaurant is very beautiful and elegant with a lot of Botero's artwork throughout. To be honest with you, I didn't know anything about the namesake of the restaurant until I Yelped about it. Turns out I took a picture in front of a Botero piece once before, at the FS Hotel in Miami. I thought the sculpture in the middle of this restaurant looked familiar. Sculptures of plump, nekked women is definitely a Botero thing."

It was the best dining experience I had in a five day trip to Vegas. Although not a steak eater, I'd chosen this restaurant due to the variety of other options and was very pleased. The service was also very good.\n\nI dined there with a friend on a Monday evening in early February before a show. We had a reservation and were promptly greeted by an extremely friendly assistant GM and hostess and taken to a table with a nice pool view.\n\nThey have a decent cocktail menu, which I appreciate. For my meal, I started with the grilled octopus at our server's suggestion, and it was fantastic.The octopus was prepared perfectly - not at all chewy - and the romesco sauce was tasty but didn't overpower the other flavors. I could have eaten my whole meal off of the appetizer list there were so many tempting options of all kinds - beet salads, ahi tuna, crudo tastings, soups...My friend had the half East / half West oysters and thought they were fresh and prepared well.\n\nFor my entree, I had a seasonal fish dish that was fantastic. The fish was flaky but moist and fresh. If you like steaks, there are probably tons of options to tantalize you with lots of cuts, four different preparation options, and five or six add-ons, plus a great selection of sides. There are also menu options for Vegans that are actually desirable.\n\nThe dessert we shared tempted me with peanut butter promises, but there wasn't much peanut butter flavor. The little pieces of caramel corn were tasty, and some sort of chocolate chunk on the side (which I think was supposed to comprise a brownie element?) was the best part but small. I think they could stand to have a different pastry chef, but it wasn't bad. \n\nOverall, very friendly and prompt but not pushy service and really fantastic food. I will definitely eat here again on my next trip to Vegas."

I ordered the two soups (french onion and some veggie one).  The french onion was amazing.  I did order it without cheese, so i was able to savour the flavors without having to deal with cheese.  The veggie soup (too bad i forgot which one) was good too....but i didn't finish it.  Do i regret not finishing it?  Not so much.  I then ordered the potato gnocchi.  It was in a tomato basil sauce.  I asked for no cheese on this too.  It was good, but i'm not really a gnocchi fan.  It was really POTATOEY.  I had like 3 or 4 gnocchi's and I was done.  I did try my cousin's macaroni and cheese (side) and it was DIVINE.  The macaroni and cheese alone gave this place an extra star!!!\n\nI'm a really good sport about steakhouses even though i dont eat meat.

The line was so long and they were so full we couldn't get a table. Since that date we were sad about not going so when we made our trip back in March 2011 we made it a point to make a reservation and go. It was totally worth the wait.\n\nWe started out with the short rib ravioli and creaser salad. Both were amazing and pretty good sized portions. The steak tartar was good so I'm told (I didn't want to eat the raw meat and I don't like eggs let alone quail eggs but it was scarfed down). It was served with the most amazing french fries I've EVER had - perfectly crispy outside and soft inside and some baguette bread. I got the 8oz steak  which came with an interesting shortbread sandwich cookie that had blue cheese and fig inside it which was amazing! We also got two of their side dishes, we got the \"fondue\" mashed potatoes which had mozzarella cheese infused into them somehow they were fantastic we also got the truffle mac and cheese which had panko type bread crumbs on top - it was just amazing there are not words to say how good it was.  \n\nWe were pretty full as the food was quite plentiful on each plate but we'd seen the reviews and saw that they had a s'more dessert. Small donuts covered in graham cracker crumbs you could dip in chocolate or vanilla sauce and was served with marshmallows which was amazing the reviews were right they tasted amazing and rounded out this amazing dinner.\n\nThe price tag was HEFTY but for a once in a while thing it was totally worth it!"

Not terribly expensive, its Vegas so you should expect to drop a little coin and this place was totally worth it.  We ordered  1 of almost everything and two of the veggie lasagna.  Loved it all!"

I always get let down.  Vegas restaurants are typically over conceived and left behind after their launch.  \n\nThat being said, Botero was an incredible meal.\n\nWe had grilled octopus, ahi tar tar, sashimi, et cetera to start.  On top of that we also enjoyed a number of really solid wine choices.\n\nThe group ordered ribeye which was the right choice.  It was sided with a chimichurri sauce of sorts which was light and well matched.\n\nI'll be back."

My steak was overcooked and dry. I was extremely disappointed. Three of our steaks were very noticeably overcooked and the manager agreed. He offered to replace them but we had waited OVER AN HOUR to be served the first time and did not want to wait any longer. We choked down the dry meat... paid our $120 each and moved on. If you want a steak in Vegas, go to Del Friscos."

You seriously can't go wrong coming here if it's either a intimate date or a group thing.\n\nSo the dishes. The truffle macaroni and cheese. I personally have a love hate relationship with truffle mac since sometimes it's amazing and sometimes it's terrible. This time, it was pretty good. It wasn't mind blowing, but it wasn't disappointing either. The grilled octopus was fantastic. This was my first time having octopus, and it was pretty damn tasty. It was rich and had a full flavor. For the steak, we had the bone-in ribeye. Now, comparing it to Delmonico, I think Delmonico had the better steak, but to take anything away from Botero's steak would be wrong. This steak was fantastc. The medium rare was spot on, the tenderness was there and the juice oozed out.\n\nBotero was definitely somewhere worth coming to."

These were probably the best part of the meal. Between the group, we probably tried most cuts of the meat. My steak was ok but I asked for it medium rare and it def. came medium which is a big no no in my book. I added the foie gras on top - again decent but slightly overcooked. The sides were yummy, esp the yams with marshmellow. The desserts were so so. The souffle was easily forgettable and i've had better cupcakes at bakeries in san francisco. My biggest complaints though, which dropped this place from 3 to 2 stars for me - They charged us for an extra bottle of wine and it was a pain to have it dealt with, esp. with room charges and credits. We were never offered coffee/expresso at the end of the meal which again is a big no no in my book if you are going to a nice restaurant. When someone in the group asked for a latte, we were told that another party needed to be seated at the table and so if we wanted cofee, we could move to the bar. what?!\nDef. was not a cheap meal, food was ok, and service was terrible. Why go back when you've got cut, sw, delmonico, ... endless other steakhouse options in vegas all within 5 -10 minutes.  Maybe they'll get their act together over time, but for right now, would not recommend it to anyone."

            "review": "Soo, hello again.  As you may recognize from previous reviews, I like to Vegas... a lot.  Vegas may be a borderline addiction for me ( I do go through Vegas withdrawals).  So on many visits to Vegas, I do go to XS at Encore to club and what not, and while in line, I always see Botero.  I was always curious and asked around and only one person I knew had eaten there and really recommended it (picky ass foodie/cook cousin of mine).\n\nSo, after many many visits, I happened to be in Vegas with my little brother celebrating a birthday at the same time my parents decided to go to a convention and they wanted to meet up for one meal when we were sober (which didn't really happen much that trip).  They asked me, who is the semi-resident, for a spot and I suggested Botero since they offered to pay.  So, with a reservation in hand, we went.\n\nSo the ambiance of Botero is very anti-Vegas because it is subdued, quiet and very tranquil.  The hosts and waiters are awesome and attentive, and it is a very relaxing atmosphere to unwind and breathe.\n\nOkay.. so on to the food!  When I eat with my family, we all order what we want but end up eating family style so everyone gets a bite.  What we ordered: Broccoli cheddar soup, onion portobello soup, ricotta ravioli, chateaubriand, arctic char, truffle mac n' cheese, roasted bone marrow, S'mores brioche donuts, and the frozen chocolate candy bar.\n\nI can not begin to rant and rave about this place.  Everything we tasted was amazing.  The soups were both savory and delicious.  The ricotta ravioli was melt in your mouth good.  The chateaubriand was medium rare perfection.  The desserts.... oh my god the desserts were rich, dense, amazing and orgasmic.  Lastly, were the sides.  The truffle mac n' cheese disappeared... FAST.  We could not get enough of it.  \n\nAnd my personal favorite dish of the night was the bone marrow with onion jam.  This is not for the faint of heart (or those with high blood pressure).  The bone marrow was melt-in-your-mouth texture with rich, beefy flavor.  Combined with the onion jam and the toast points.. DROOLLLL.  An amazing ethereal experience.\n\nOkay, so enough of this long winded review but damn, Botero is something else."

The restaurant is phenomenal, outdoor seating overlooks the pool and the decor is beautiful (I was captivated by the jars of colored liquid that ran up the bar and across the ceiling).  This place is all about presentation which made for a great experience!\n\nWe had reservations and were quickly seated, the sommelier immediately came up to our table and recommended 2 fabulous bottles of wine.  Our waiter, Anthony, had a great personality and made the entire experience fun, not stuffy.  We ordered a half dozen apps which were all fantastic - my favorite was the Hamatchi Tartar, which featured cooked rice cake with the small service tool baked into it.  We also had the potato gnocchi (ok) and the kobe steak tartar (I can die happy!).   Everyone ordered steak as their entrees and were incredibly happy with them... but.... I had to be a girl and order fish.  At a steakhouse.  Results?  A bit disappointing.  I ordered the Sea Bass and hardly ate any of it.  It wasn't very exciting and just tasted heavy.  Lots of sauce and potatoes.  For sides we had the truffle mac & cheese (the truffle flavor was a bit overwhelming for me), broccoli, potato gratin, and roasted bone marrow.  \n\nDesert had the dishes with the most whimsy (yes, we ordered desert...by the time we left we felt like the subject of a Botero painting)  We ordered the cupcakes and ice cream sandwiches.  They were good, but the best part was that there were 5 of each flavor, and they were small (not much room left in the stomach by that time).\n\nAll in all  had a blast at Botero - several wine glasses were broken and lots of amazing food was eaten."

We arrived on Superbowl Sunday just around the end of the game so the place was still pretty empty. We were greeted warmly and shown to our seats. They gave us the option of sitting on the patio but we chose to sit inside instead.\n\nOnce seated, our waiter quickly took our water orders and let us peruse the menu for a little bit before returning for our drink and food order. I had been doing my homework so knew exactly what I wanted already. We started with the dungeness crab agnolotti and grilled octopus. The server mentioned that these were two of his favorite dishes, so I already knew we were on the right track. My fella went with the bone-in ribeye with rosemary prawns and I ordered the bone-in filet with foie gras. I just couldn't resist. To round our our order we decided on the brussel sprouts with pork belly and truffle mac n cheese for our sides. I was already worried we ordered too much, but we forged ahead. \n\nOur appetizers came out quickly and they smelled heavenly. My favorite was the dungeness crab, but the octopus was prepared well as well. I enjoyed the gnocchi, they were like heavenly little pillows. Just as we finished our appetizers our steaks and sides were delivered. They were enormous and smelled fantastic. I couldn't wait to take the first bite. Both steaks were perfectly cooked and we were so happy with our choices. The truffle mac n cheese and brussel sprouts were good. Not the best brussel sprouts I've ever had, but they were still delicious. I probably would have preferred them without the pork belly, crazy I know. \n\nWe savored every bite but still couldn't finish everything, so we had quite a bit to take home for a midnight snack later. Despite not finishing all our food, we couldn't resist trying their famous smore beignets. I'll admit I wasn't blown away by these, but that's mostly because I'm not a huge fan of smores or any combination of these flavors. The dessert was amazing nevertheless, but I would be more interested in the key lime dessert next time around. \n\nThis is a great location for large parties, they have quite a number of tables that can accommodate large groups before heading to the nearby clubs and they have an eclectic variety of music playing in the restaurant to get everyone pumped up. Overall, we had an amazing date night experience and I look forward to returning again!"

The sea bass tasted better then the halibut, but still wasn't something to rave about. The mac and cheese side was GREAT.

But, our wonderful waiter was very concerned, took the fish back and the chef asked if I wanted something else. Since my throat was in some pain from the bone (the bone dislodged but it had scratched my throat) I declined another entree.So, the chef sent out different types of sorbets to numb and ease the pain, plus other desserts. My fab waiter took almost EVERYTHING off our bill. We got our 4 glasses of cocktails taken off, our bottle of wine, my entree and the 6 different desserts were free. All in all, bill should have been close to $300, but we only paid $100, for my husband's entree, 2 appetizers and tax.

It was one of very few restaurants that could book 12 without going to a private room.  The ambiance of a lot of Vegas Restaurants I think still relies on the dining room and the atmosphere.  \n\nWith a lot of different tastes sitting at the table, a lot of diverse items were explored.  A few had the Tasting of soup to start.  All of they felt that one of them was way too salty, almost too salty to eat. I believe it was the mushroom and proscuitto.  \n\nI started with the Tasting of Ham and Cheese.  Title sounded funny, but was awesome. Iberico ham is fantastic and if cured meats is your thing, try it when it's available.  The serving size was almost too big though as I was starting to feel full when I finished.\n\nMost people had steak and they do it very well. They offer 3 choices for preparation.  Peppersteak, Chimichurri, and traditional.  If you love a great steak, stick with traditional.  If you like exploring new flavors, chimichurri is my favorite.  \n\nWe were all so full, only one had dessert.  I'm glad she was sitting next to me, as I got to try her pick. \n\nI've visited as a party of 2 and a party of 12, service was good all the time.

Since I work mainly on the phone, years passed since I'd seen him.

Here I was all dressed up in a little black dress with high heels and this mile-long shoe strap dangling like a serpent off my foot as I walked through the gorgeous lobby!  It was worse since there were so many people and I could see women staring at my foot.  OMG please ground open up and swallow me now!  This is when I wish I would have bought those red soled shoes!  \n\nSo when we arrived at Botero there was a bar and a few cocktail tables.  And you know by this time I was ready for a double vodka martini.  We sat and waited and no service:( and no bartender to be seen:(   No bueno!  So again, I look like a fool assuming we would get bar service at the \"lounge\".  Botero, you let me down.\n\nOur reservations were at 7 p.m. and we decided to grab the table early.  The hostess was very friendly and prior to getting seated I asked a waiter passing by if he had scissors. He quickly found some and I was able to snip of my dangling shoe strap. So that was a life saving moment.\n\nOur waiter was fabulous.  Polite, friendly not overly stuffy.  I ordered a cocktail called the \"Dream\" which was ironic since I was actually in a nightmare. I'm not sure of the ingredients but I saw the pretty picture on the menu and pointed to it.  PIctures on menus are a good idea especially when you're head is in a spiral and you can't think or talk straight.  It had champagne and a hibiscus flower and it was just what I needed (in addition to a double of something really strong).\n\nNext came out a tower of breads...wonderful!  I'm sure they were but I needed to cut back on carbs remember I just busted out of a shoe.  The squash soup was very good but presentation-wise fell a bit short. A dollop of cream and some chives or pomagranite seeds, or pumpkin seeds, shredded apple...some garnish would have been a nice touch.\n\nI ordered the salmon and asked for it to be a bit well done-the waiter did warn me that it can come out looking a bit undercooked so I ordered it probably too overly done and it was a bit dry but the rest of the vegetables that were served with it were heavenly.\n\nThe beautiful restaurant was buzzing with lots of the conference attendees.  One of which who happened to be my client's customer none other than Eugene Cernan-Yes, the famous astronaut who was the last man to walk on the moon!  I was very excited to meet him and after my disastrous evening it came to a delightful ending.\n\nI would love to come back and appreciate the paintings and more offerings. The menu looked incredible with so many choices.  I just wish the service at the bar was in existance because I really needed that Tini!"

It is located at the Encore right next to XS the night club. \nThe vibe and energy of this resturant is really young, hip and fresh. We ordered many dishes but the stand out pieced were the truffle mac and cheese (mouth watering), the filet, the botero fries and the donuts with ice cream. \n\nThey have a great drink menu with many inventive drinks. If I had to dine in one resturant in Las Vegas first would be SW steakhouse at the Wynn then Botero!!!\n\nThanks Steve Wynn!"

I am an Open Table VIP and have never given 1 star.  \nMy parents retired to Henderson and were excited about treating us for thanksgiving. We travelled from Miami , San Francisco, and NJ.  For the 6 of us, the meal bill was $700.  We paid the wine separately.  The experience was not worth it.  It started with the inability to find our reservation, a dirty coffee cup, and debris floating in a water glass.  The waiter was not graceful.  The appetizers were good, but the turkey entree was dry and tasteless.  There was a small piece of white meat on top of shredded dark meat surrounded by dry stuffing and vegetables.  It needed to be smothered in gravy.  The apple dessert was delicious.  The pumpkin dessert was not.   \nSo as not to ruin the night, my parents expressed their disappointment to the general manager Chris Jurchenko the following week and were offered, if they pay $100 for 2 additional entrees, free appetizers, drinks, and dessert.  This was supposed to be a thankful occasion, but was far from it.  If Botero were not in the Wynn Hotel, it would not last."

We came here by chance due to a mix-up in reservations at another steakhouse and they were able to accomodate our large group (although they did have to put us outside - it was a warm summer night and we had to deal with some of the noise from the XS nightclub). \n\nOverall, I was impressed with the steaks, service and overall quality of Botero. I hadn't heard too much about Botero, but was glad that we had a chance to try the place. Since there was a mix-up at the other restaurant, we did get a few freebies courtesy of the other manager and my host. Service was great, especially since we had a large group, and they did accomodate our large group.\n\nSteaks and sides - had the bone-in rib eye which was done very well and everyone else that ordered different steaks were happy with what they ordered. The one must have in terms of sides is the truffle mac and cheese. It must be the truffle, but it is one of the best mac and cheese sides that I have had. \n\nAnother good steakhouse option in Las Vegas if you are looking for a higher end restaurant."

I am a middle age guy who was eaten his share of fine cuisine and i don't appreciate being lectured on steak by a 22 year old waiter.  Worse than the long wait was the waiters absence after the long delay.  He made no attempt to rectify the situation or apologize in any way  It was dissapointing coming from a hotel that is suppose to be the pinnacle of hospitality in las vegas.

I've had a lot of great steaks here in Vegas so I wouldn't say this is \"best steak of my life\" material, but it certainly didn't disappoint.

Don't eat here and not get these. A homemade donut, coated in graham cracker with gooey marshmallow inside with dark chocolate dipping sauce.

They're the only reason I'm giving this restaurant two stars instead of one.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nI'll get right to the point; after the starters, 4 out of 6 of us ordered steak, we returned 2 of the steaks because they were overcooked, one of them was dry. The steaks they brought out afterwards were undercooked. A thick cut filet, ordered medium rare, was fridge cold in the center, and the rib-eye, ordered medium, was just seared. We asked for our waiter but instead we were greeted by an arrogant manager named Josh. He was really rude to us and insisted that the steaks were cooked properly, but when asked, he offered no explanation in regards to proper cooking of the steak! All he repeated, in an borderline insulting tone, was that the steaks were cooked correctly. Needless to say, his attitude was really upsetting and two of our party still didn't have their entrees. \n\nOne of our party was so upset that he lost his appetite and didn't want his steak back. The manager's answer to this was \"don't worry I won't make you pay for it\" in a really rude and arrogant tone.  At this point all we wanted to do was pay the check and leave. Our sommelier offered us complimentary deserts so we would stay but nobody accepted them. \n\nWe were there to have a nice family dinner at one of our preferred restaurants in Vegas, but it was ruined by this character along with our high opinion of this restaurant. The only thing salvageable from this otherwise horrible experience was the poise and attitude from our waiter and sommelier, and we appreciate their invitation to come back so they can make amends. \n\nI sent a link to this review to the hotel manager so that he might know what we went through. Needles to say, we will not be dining at Botero again anytime soon."

            "review": "We dined at Botero on January 26. I made reservations a few weeks before hand, shortly after I had booked Encore. I mentioned it was my friends birthday hoping they would do something and they did. \nWe arrived at 7:30 and they were ready to seat us, but at a round larger table, there were 4 of us and I believe it was a 6 top. We opted to wait a few minutes and had drinks at the bar. The Lychee Martini was yummy to say the least. Friend had the Sangria which was great, her hubby had a Grape Crush thing that tasted just like grape soda, it was very good. Hubby had Knob Creek. I should mention that there was nothing wrong with the first table the hostess wanted to seat us at, we just wanted a smaller table which was available moments after we ordered our drinks. We went to the hostess stand when we were ready and she carried our drinks to the table for us. \nService was very good throughout the meal. We started with two apps, the Crudo Tasting and the Gnochhi. Both were very good, the Gnocchi were probably the best I have ever tasted. Definately made in house and fluffy as can be. The sauce was perfect on them. I would go back and order just those. We split the large portion for Gnocchi between three of us, I could have eaten the whole thing myself but then there would be no room for steak.\nFor steaks, I had the petite filet, Linda had a ribeye, the guys both had the bone in strip. My steak was overcooked, I ordered it medium but felt it was closer to medium well. Hubby's steak was overcooked on half of it, the thickness was not the same throughout his and that is where the problem came in. Linda and her hubby's steaks were done perfectly. Which is where they loose a star, not getting our steaks right is a biggie in a steak restaurant. For sides we split the whipped potatoes and the potatoe gratin? I can't remember what the guys had. We could have ordered one more side but the two we had were fine. \nDessert came they brought Linda a plate with Happy Birthday on it and I think they sang. I notice other plates going out like this that had mini cupcakes on it, so not sure if that is the norm or not, hers didn't but we ordered the mini cupcakes as a dessert so possibly they didn't put one her plate due to that. The cupcakes were great. 5 different flavors with a little tiny patty of ice cream on it. The strawberry was my favorite and I tried 3 of them!! \nI would go back to Botero but honestly it would be for the Gnocchi and cupcakes. I wouldn't need a steak if I ordered the large portion of the pasta. I still dream about it! Like I said service was fantastic, not intrusive but they were always there when you needed them. Water glasses were kept full and they seemed to know what you needed at all times. Very impressive. Everyone in the restaurant from the hostess to the bartender to the servers to the Managers were on top of things. I was very impressed considering they were only open a little over a month when we went. The timing between courses was absolutely perfect, the only time we had a problem was when we were missing the spoons for our sides which as soon as I looked around our waiter appeared with some!!  Our total Bill was $413 plus tip so $500 total for 4. That included the steaks, the sides, apps, atleast 6 drinks, and dessert. I realize we didn't order as much food as many do at steakhouses but we left very full and happy."

There is a gorgeous water fall in the middle of the restaurant and Botero paintings on the walls. The atmosphere is dark and intimate, very romantic.

We decided that one night we would go to a nice restaurant for a decent meal. Can't spend all my money on alcohol and gambling. We randomly went with this place and I am glad we did. \n\nThere were three of us and we got two appetizer and two dishes to split and it was more than enough food. The waiter was really accommodating and helpful. He was also super nice. That is always a plus. \n\nIf you're in Vegas and looking for a nice meal, I definitely recommend Botero!"

I think the theme was fat women or something, because I noticed a few painting of plump women, and in the middle of the restaurant was this giant sculpture of a giant woman (it was like a cross between jaba the hut and budah).  But they do make the place look like a happening dining area.\n\nWaiter was really nice and attentive.  The bar tender screwed up and made too many drinks and he gave them to us for free.\n\nI had the NY Strip, which was good, but for the price, there are plenty of better steak houses  to go to in Vegas (i.e. Del Frisco).\n\nMy wife had the fillet, which was good, and a pretty large portion as well.  But again, not amazing, but definitely decent.\n\nSides, we had brussel sprouts, which were pretty tasty, and it had some fried pork belly, which of course makes everything taste better.  We also had the mac n cheese (which I am on quest to find the best), and that was awesome.  It had flakes of black truffles, it was hot, and it was cooked perfectly.  If anything, I'd come back and just order this.\n\nOthers at the table had the lamb and chicken, which they all enjoyed.\n\nI thought the bread was also pretty good.\n\nSo, in the end, food was decent and decor/atmosphere was cool, but if you are looking for an awesome steak, I'd recommend some other places."

Can it even taste better than it sounds?  HELL YEAH.  Three generous sized ravioli stuffed with rich short rib meat.  Does it get any better?  Well, depends.  Hubby had the wild mushroom tart with gruyere cheese... that was amazingly delicious as well.\n\nFor entrees, I decided after three meals of meat, I went with the salmon done two ways.  Basically it was two pieces of salmon grilled to absolute perfection, one served over a squash puree with carmelized onions, and the other was served over a mix of quince and potato wedges.   Hubby had the bone-in rib eye steak - with three sauces.  A jalapeno hollandaise, a red pepper sauce, and a pepper and herbs sauce. \n\nEverything was fantastic, but I do have to say - the stars were the side dishes we ordered.  Creamed spinach with a fried egg on top - I mean, literally fried into a ball with a crispy coating.  And the polenta with mushrooms and truffle oil.  OMG.  Just order these.

I was so looking forward to a wonderful meal. It started out bad from the first course the wild mushroom tart was cold and soggy so few mushrooms I had to send in a research team to look! My husband had the beet salad w/ goats cheese , he enjoyed it. Our waiter came to us when we sat down took our order for food and wine and never came back till the end of the meal. Our first courses arrived fast and we still did not get our wine? We tried to get someones attention but they were to busy with the bigger tables. Finally we received the wine almost 5 minutes before our entree (not good) . Our entree arrived semi-warm we both ordered the petite filet mine med rare his rare! Well that's not what we got. We got med well and med!!!And to top it off they were not warm nor was the sauce we ordered on the side. Very bad my husband ordered foie -gras on his steak it came cold! Our waiter miraculously showed up at the end did not ask how our meal was just if we wanted dessert! Our bill was over $350.00 not worth it even if we got our room compt !!!!Will never go back horrible service!!!"

Unfortunately it was closed - because of wind possibly.  Nonetheless, the ONLY complaint I have abou the restaurant is the lighting.  The service was excellent.  The food from the appetizer, entree, to dessert, was unbelievable.   Wish I would have tried the crab cake, but got the special - Lobster ravioli - as appetizer instead.  Was delicious.  Entree was braised short rib for me, Bone in filet pepper style for my partner in crime.  The jalapeno hollandaise sauce was amazing!

After reading about it we took the plunge and WOW it was worth it.  Spendy for us but a few times a year a $350 dinner is fun and this one was yummy.  \n\nWe had great soups to start then a good wedge salad then some of the best steak and seafood.  We got excellent service because we went in there late.  I like to eat late in Vegas because the places are not so crazy and we can hear ourselves talk.  The inside of this place is really pretty cozy and not Vegas gaudy.  A great dark fountain in the inside and the pool outside XS for patio dining.  The night we ate there XS was closed so we could not hear the boom boom boom.  Great place try it."

The food was delicious, the decor was sumptuous, the service was gracious.\n\nTo start, we had the ricotta gnocchi, the beet salad with goat cheese, and the short rib ravioli (special for the day). Each one was delicious. The presentation was, as you would expect, thoughtful and elegant. I had the kobe short rib as the entree. It was one of those fall-off-the-bone type meats, tender and tasty. The wine list was comprehensive. We had the chocolate torte and the doughnuts with marshmallows for dessert. Both were good, though the doughnuts were the winner of the night in our opinion. \n\nI would have given this dinner five stars, for sure. Except one of my friends had to run to the bathroom immediately afterwards. To be exact, he jumped out of the cab while we were on the Las Vegas Strip, telling us that he needed to find a bathroom, ASAP. Made the driver chuckle. Maybe this could have been a Bridesmaids moment? For his sake, I couldn't give Botero five stars."

The wine was served at the perfect temperature and complimented our food well (Duckhorn Merlot).\n\nThe desserts only added to an excellent evening and our ever growing waistlines. I would tell anyone that Botero is a great place to dine and has a flair that can only be found in Vegas. Heed my advice and have a wonderful time. Just try to get some exercise in afterward.

Someone had recommended Botero because of the atomosphere and the quality steaks.  I decided to go on a whim and to my delight it was pretty good.  \n\nTheir decor is very cosmopolitan and it's poolside.  Great location for a great meeting, shower, or just plain old dinner.  Service is great and the staff will be more than happy to tell you what their favorites are on the menu.  \n\nTo start I ordered the Seafood Tower and for my main course I ordered the bone in Filet.  Now there's also a bone in Rib Eye but for 10 bucks more I wanted the melt in your mouth cut.  LOL.  It was perfectly carmelized on the outside seared to perfection.  I got it Chimmychurri style.  I HIGHLY recommend it.  The flavors were robust and not overwhelming either.  We paired it up with Truffle Mac and Cheese and also a side of their almond crusted asparagus.  Here's what I loved and didn't love about our meal.  \n\n*The Seafood Tower was not impressive.  Considering I had great seafood towers at Maestro in Costa Mesa this one didn't compare.  \n\n*Bone in Filet was ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY DELISH.  As mentioned before perfectly marbeled and carmelized.  Lick your plate good!\n\n*Truffle Mac and Cheese was great, it isn't the kraft mac and cheese creamy that I normally like but this gourmet mac and cheese is a must have if you love cheese!\n\n*Almond crusted asparagus is not my favorite.  I rather had mine with plain olive oil with salt and pepper but if you like your asparagus deep fried go for it.  \n\n*Banana Foster Creme Brule was good.  I think I like classic creme brule.  This one was good but again I'm a traditionalist when it comes to my creme brule.  \n\n*Donut holes were awesome, I would highly recommend this with a side of ice cream.\n\nOverall it was worth EVERY PENNY.  It's a tad on the expensive side but jus remember, their portions are large enough to share.  Their side dishes can definitely feed about 2-3 people easily.  \n\nMUST TRY when you're staying at Encore or Wynn."

I don't know if it was the wine we had at the Eastside Lounge, or the fact that I'm leaving Vegas and feel the need to eat the whole city before I go, but we decided to throw caution to the wind, and order the caviar with some champagne. Well, it was obviously delicious- it was Osetra, and quite reasonably priced for 15g at $105. Other restaurants on the strip serve the exact same thing for twice the price! The real standout star was the Poblano Chile and Corn Creme Brulee. I don't want to be inappropriate here.. But it was like sex served up hot in a cast iron skillet. 100% on my list of top 5 best things I've ever eaten.  \n\nWe had some tastings of the heirloom tomato salad which was elevated with the addition of a kalamata olive, and the beet salad was great as well. If you have a chance to go in before it closes- ask for Mora as your server!"

Each and every restaurant at the casinos there has a complete and separate vegan menu!\n\nWe have eaten at several places there, but I singled out Botero, because it has the more unusual veggie fare of the bunch. We bought a bunch of smaller items and did a lot of sharing and everything was wonderful.\n\nAnd for the locals, don't forget about the Wynn Resorts for your special ocassions... It's such a relief to find a veggie friendly place where you can show up in dressy attire and have candlelight and romance."

            "review": "So...\n\nI just got back from a weekend in Vegas, which finished off with Le Reve and dinner at Botero. My boyfriend and I were celebrating our one-year anniversary, which I had noted in the reservation, and I had originally wanted to go to Alex, which seems to be THE place at the Encore, but they were closed for two weeks for the yearly deep cleaning or something. Since we had show tickets right there in the Wynn I didn't want to have to try to fight the ridiculous Vegas foot traffic (or the HEAT!) so  Botero it was. Part of me wishes it wasn't...\n\nAMBIENCE:\nThe restaurant is beautiful. See other reviews for descriptions, including the fat-woman theme which somehow works for them (I think all the art is by the artist the restaurant is named after). It's a very romantic place, but not necessarily spectacular.\n\nSERVICE:\nOur server was adequate and unobtrusive, but bland as can be. He blandly wished us a happy anniversary (maybe he was just really uncomfortable with the fact that it was two men *GASP!*), blandly told us about some options, and blandly went through all the motions of a fine-dining server. But the motions were there nonetheless, so gotta give him credit for that. Plus he did recommend a half-bottle of possibly the best Pinot Noir I've ever had (although he blandly described it too!). It was a 2006 Flying Goat Pinot and was so smooth and yummy. Along with dessert (see below) it probably saved the night. Worth the $50 for the half bottle.\n\nThere were maybe up to 5 people bringing food, wine, etc. during the meal, and all were very professional and prompt.\n\nFOOD:\nUltimately food is the reason your at a friggin restaurant so it HAS to be amazing to earn 5 stars. But it got 3. Probably only 2 for the halibut, and 3.5 for the rack of lamb. I don't have enough money to eat fine dining very often, so when I do I expect it to be amazing, but I've had better lamb for $25 at Il Postino in San Diego and it's next door to me (seriously if you are ever in North Park TRY IT!!). The cut was excellent, and it was cooked very well but the flavors were just lacking. The fig goat cheese and eggplant lasagna that came with it sounded like it would be phenomenal--but it just wasn't. It was interesting and tasty but nothing I dreamed about later (hey, it's happened!).\n\nThe BF got halibut, which I wish I'd remembered what these reviews said about it because it really was NOT great at all. Edible at most. And the veggies that it came with were really garlicky (emphasis on the, um, icky).\n\nWe had the risotto-stuffed fried zuccini blossoms for an appetizer but they basically just tasted like fried batter with cream sauce. Blah.\n\nI was planning to have steak but after two days in the sun and two nights of drinking it just wasn't appetizing. I know, I know, it's a steak restaurant and neither of us had STEAK, but it just wasn't the night.\n\nWe did eat enough to be get full but on a one-year anniversary you GOTTA have dessert! So we ordered the creme brulee. Best decision of the night. It has an amazing vanilla flavor with real vanilla beans in it and came with a mascarpone cream with fruit on the side. Both were so smooth and tasty and went really well with the wine that we'd managed to resist gulping down already. They also brought out a cute plate with 'Happy Anniversary' in chocolate sauce and two ice cream lollipops that were good. I had absolutely no room for one but somehow it still found a little cranny in my stomach... So the wine and dessert really saved an otherwise gastronomical disappointment. \n\nSHEESH! What a long review. We had a great time, which is hard not to do with such an amazing guy, but I really doubt we'll ever go back. Well maybe for dessert..."

Generally known for their steak but Chef Lorusso is actually great with seafood. \nToday was my 3rd time eating there so here are a few highlights that are must haves:\n\nAppetizers:\n~Short Rib Ravioli- My oh my so rich and flavorful where you don't want to share. Drool worthy but be aware that there is only 3 pieces \n~ Crudo tasting- if you love sashimi and or raw fish prepared different ways then this is amazing. Loved experiencing the different preparations \n~Ahi tuna tartare- I could eat a whole vat of this if I could. Fresh fish + mango+ avocado= heaven in my mouth.  \n\nEntree: \n~Can go wrong with any steak here but they prepare it 3 different ways. I recommended the pepper ways first cause it also has a variety of sauces and then  chimichurri second. \n~Short rib- fall off the bone kind of meat sitting on a bed of amazing potato pur\u00e9e with the oh so delightful red wine sauce. \n\nSides:\n~Tater Tots- no seriously....they are a whole new level of tater tots. (Cheese in the middle- you're welcome) \n\nI honestly could go on and on about this place. Modern decor and received its name because it showcases work from artist, Fernando Botero. Overlooks poolside view and if you want to go clubbing afterwards it is next to the popular club, XS. \n\nHighly recommend if you're looking for good food and good vibes. The service was impeccable and staff was extremely friendly. You will definitely spend a little because it's is fine dining but you will enjoy the experience."

Salmon is a restaurant staple for me and I've never had one like this one.\n\nOnly con is that sides are not served for less than an additional twenty dollars per side, but honestly, the entree servings are huge and that was hard to finish!\n\nReally glad I experienced this restaurant."

Wait until my next review to see where we REALLY splurged because this is so not the place to do it.\n\nWe had a Friday night restaurant, sitting by the window, facing Encore Beach Club's European pool (nope, didn't see any boobies). The menu focuses on steaks and seafood. We were going to get the shellfish tower $65.00 but when our server said it was simply 2 of each (oysters, clams, lobster tails, etc), we passed, thinking it was too much food along with the appetizers we were going to get. Sooo not worth the price either.\n\nInstead we ordered frog legs, hamachi tartare and crab agnolotti for our appetizers and steak tartare and dayboat scallops for our entrees. We also ordered a half bottle of sancerre to start.\n\nWhile we waited, servers came by and placed cocktail and tartar sauce on our table. I thought, wait, did we ordered the shellfish tower? And then I saw it coming to our table: that damn shellfish tower!\n\nThere seemed to be some miscommunication but after they took the tower away, I thought, wait. He thought we ordered 3 appetizers and a shellfish tower. He should have spoke up and mentioned it might have been a bit too much food. Mistake #1.\n\nOur appetizers came out and all were good but nothing great.\n\n- Frog legs: I didn't really like the frog legs and not because they were frog legs but because it just had no flavor. Came with a bubbly buttery garlic sauce but I passed. BF ended up adding salt to this dish. The side salad was good though.\n\n- Hamachi Tartare: Good but overrated. NOT your typical tartare. They placed them on top of crispy (stale tasting) rice. Why?! It was too sweet for my taste too.\n\n- Crab Agnolotti: Very, very, very good. Creamy and plenty of crab! Yummy artichokes too :)\n\n- Scallops: 4 big scallops with a sweet sauce. Not something my bf anticipated and he got sick of this dish quick. I would say it was not something we would order again. BF ended up adding salt to this dish.\n\n- Steak tartare: I was going to get this as an appetizer but none of the entrees impressed me so I got this. Pretty good. Not the tastiest I've ever had. Egg yolk (quail) was small. Needed some dijon mustard on the side and maybe some more salt. Actually, my bf finished this dish for me and added salt.\n\n- Birthday dessert: I only ate the top portion since the bottom was caramel (grossss).\n\nThe wine was good but they brought out the wrong one (mistake #2). We were comped a bottle though, that was awesome (and necessary).\n\nOur bill was about $210, minus tip. I shivered not because it was expensive but because I felt like the food was not worth it. But what in Vegas isn't expensive?!\n\nOh yea, our bill had the shellfish tower on it still (mistake #3) so you might want to carefully check it."

We went there because we were seeing Garth Brooks, so the evening was already starting off on a high note!!  The bread was ok at best, and then I got to the cranberry bread which broke my tooth!  Literally bitting into this piece of BREAD broke my tooth.  Fortunately it didn't hurt and there was nothing that was going to keep me from that concert, so we kept pushing.  The Tuna Tartar came out and it was so spicy, myy tongue was now burnt for the rest of the meal.  My husband said his salad was good, but I know him and if it was good, the plate would have been wiped clean and there was a lot left.\n\nAs for the main dish, I ordered the Black Bass, given fish is my favorite thing and bass is at the top of the list... It had NO taste!  I could have continued eating it, it was edible, but what was the point when there was no taste!  As a side I ordered the pistachio crusted asparagus which was different and the only thing that peaked my interest enough to eat.  My husband ordered the filet, he said his was \"not bad\" but next time he would get it \"without all the salt around it\".  He also got the mac & cheese, which I tried and was good, but for the price of this meal, I was REALLY GOOD!!\n\nTo top the meal off I had chosen the s'mores donuts... 2 of my favorite things in the world, what could possibly be wrong with these???  Bleh!  Again, no taste and while the concept is great, they failed on delivery!\n\nMy husband and I love a good steakhouse and do not mind spending the money when we walk away satisfiied...  If it were up to me I would eat at Mastro's Ocean Club every night, but with all the options in this town, it can't hurt to branch out....  Well in this case it did \"hurt\" and a broken tooth from bread should have been an omen to stop right there!  :)\n\nOn a positive note, Garth Brooks was phenominal!!"

There were 4 of us in total and we were starving but we also had booked Le Reve at 9:30pm on a Friday night. It was already 8pm and every place Amber called was booked solid or was full with a one hour wait. She discovered that Botero had 4 spaces open at the bar at Botero which also served the full menu. By the time we walked over the bar was full. We proceeded to talk to the host and told them our situation and they were able to squeeze us in immediately and notified our waiter that we were on a time crunch in order to make it to our show on time. \n\nAmber had told us that Botero was \"casual\", when we walked in we were surprised at how hip and awesome this place was. The decor was very modern and they played music we could bop along and sing along to. As we looked through the menu there was a good variety of all different meats. I was tempted to go with the salmon, but my eyes were drawn to the 40 ounce porterhouse steak for two. I originally laughed at how ridiculous that sounded and ask the waiter if they were serious. He told us that it's his favourite dish on the menu and that he highly recommended it. I then figured if it was a porterhouse steak then there would be a big bone which comes with the serving and is what would make up a good portion of the 40 ounce weight. I talked my friend into sharing it with me as I was curious to know why it was so good. After all, it's only a piece of meat.  I ordered it with chimichurri marinade and medium rare, and I also ordered a side of broccoli with sun-dried tomatoes (gotta have your veggies!). When the steak came out it was served on a hot plate and it was pre-sliced. I'm glad it did because it would have been daunting to have to pick through a huge piece of meat. The waiter explained to us that on one side of the bone, it was actually a filet mignon cut and on the other side it was where the New York strip would normally be taken from. I was quite thrilled to be able to try two different steaks in one go.\n\nThe steak was phenomenal! I had never had such an awesome steak in my life. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now. I'm not a big steak eater too and I would normally feel ill halfway through having a steak, but this steak was made to such perfection. It melted in your mouth. The red wine we ordered also complemented the steak beautifully and the broccoli side was delicious!  We thoroughly enjoyed the steak and felt just right when we finished and not overstuffed. I also wanted to mention the bread they served while we were waiting for our order was amazing. There were two varieties, one with cranberries in it and the other was plain white rolls...for something so simple, it was truly delectable! \n\nI highly recommend this place and give two big thumbs up!! Definitely try this place if you are looking to have a nice dinner in Vegas. I'll definitely go back and can't wait!"

What made Botero so special was not only a great piece of cow, but even moreso all of the supporting cast.  \n\nThe Crudo sampler was amazing, better than many seafood restaurants.  The Hamachi 'tartar' was basically spicy tuna crispy rice but with Hamachi, but really well done.  Dungeness agnolotti was really solid, althought the crab didn't shine through.  Sides were out of this world with pork belly + lentils, yams that tasted like candy, etc.  \n\nMy NY strip chimichurri style was perfect, a great cut if you like your steak with some spice.  Service was great as well."

You can either sit outside where XS is (I wouldn't advise this if your reservation is late and the club is starting up..) or inside where you can look towards it. \nStaff is super nice and apologetic (they dropped my butter knife on me 2x. it's all good! shit happens!).\nReally liked my food..Had the Hudson Valley Foie Gras w/ a pineapple financier. The pineapple financier was weak and forgettable but I love foie gras and it was seared beautifully. \nThe bone in rib eye w/ chimichurri was very tender and tasty..\nMy dayboat scallops were also delicious but the potato cake underneath just tasted like a tiny hash brown. \n\nStill, it's an excellent steakhouse inside of Encore. So if you're craving protein while staying at Encore, make a rezzie for Botero!"

We were searching around the Wynn/Encore before the Garth Brooks Show on Saturday night with a party of 6 and were able to get a nice table on the patio that overlooked the pool. We had been down to La Cave and the hostesses they were so rude. So glad we didnt give them our business.\n\nWe had not done our research and had no idea what to order, but a quick look at Yelp on the Smartphone and we knew a couple of appetizers to order. The Crab Ravioli (it's some fancy name) and the platter of sashimi. Along with the bread basket, was so delish.\n\nWe ordered a petit filet to split and my dad and bf split the huge porterhouse. I loved the sauces that came with the peppersteak style! I am such a \"sauce\" person so this was perfect. Everyone raved about the steak and this family is from Texas.\n\nThe truffle mac and cheese was delsih - didn't care much for the artichoke side my dad ordered.\n\nThey served 2 chocolate ice cream lollipops for my Mom's bday!.\n\nGreat wine list and the cocktails were good.\n\nWe ate and walked 2 feet down to Encore Theater. Perfect place to eat  before the show."

We decided to eat at the nice restaurant inside of this hotel. \n\nWe were gambling at the tables and the pit boss was able to call in our reservation for a group of 14 with a table on the patio.  Great service to start!\n\nWhen we arrived, we were greeted by the hostess, which was probably the hottest girl we met on the whole trip.  Our table was laid out perfectly with a nice view of the pool that is part of club XS.\n\nThe pool had some nice eye candy to watch during dinner.  As we were dining, they were wrapping up the pool and setting up for the club, it was cool seeing what all went into setting up the club we were just at the night before. \n\nOn to the food.  I started out with the soup sampler.  It came with 2 soups, one was some artichoke soup which was average and the other was a mushroom soup which was amazing.\n\nOn to the steak.  I had the ribeye under the recommendation of the server.  I had it served \"pepper steak\" style which came with 3 dipping sauces.  My steak was a bit overcooked.  I ordered medium and it was more medium well, others who ordered medium rare it came medium, so I would recommend just under ordering your steak.  Out of the three sauces the brown sauce was the best. \n\nWe had a bunch of people so we had a wide variety of sides.  My favorite was the creamed spinach with fried egg.  The mac and cheese was hyped but did not live up to it.  I only got to try one spear of the fried aspargus and it was after it had cooled down but that was still excellent.  My friend didn't finish his filet so I had a few bites out of that.  The filet was much better than the prime rib.\n\nOverall, this place was elegant and the food was good.  Honestly, if you pick the right things this place could be a 5 star joint.  I just did not like the recommendations by the waiter. \n\nSo here goes my recommendations:\nGet the filet, order it 1 level less cooked than you actually want it, get it pepper steak style, get the creamed spinach, and sit on the patio by the pool."

The staff becomes an extension of this feeling with their pleasant and welcoming attitude.  Then comes the food!\n\nFor starters, I always go with the Australian Waygu Beef Steak Tartare!  It's a MUST!  It's four jalapeno hollandaise crostini with a decent sized portion of steak tartare with Parmesan.  One crostini is good for one person to eat for an appetizer, but you'll want it all to yourself!  Another great starter dish is the Hudson Valley Foie Gras!  It's the perfect blend of savory and sweet served with a blueberry waffle with lemon butter!  This is definitely a shareable portion. So no matter what you decided to order for the rest of your meal, rest assure those are key starters you won't want to miss out on.\n\nFor my main course, I have gotten many different things in the past that are delicious, but on this last trip, I got a dish that definitely deserves recognition.  I ordered the special, which was a 16 oz. Gold Grade NY Strip from Snake River Farms!  Extremely tender and FULL of flavor!  The marbling of this steak kept it so juicy and it was cooked to perfection.  Mouthwatering!  I usually like my steaks prepared there Chimichurri style, but with this steak I had it prepared simply grilled with sea salt and cracked pepper.  I got the Chimichurri on the side, just in case, and I didn't need it at all. \n\nAs for my sides, like we typically do, we all ordered a few sides that peeks our interest to share with the table.  My personal favorites are the Tater Tots with Aged Cheddar in the middle and the Truffle Mac and Cheese!!!\n\nTo finish, we were comped desserts and were served about 5 different desserts, which we ALL amazing.  I loved the mixed basket of Beignets and Cronuts.  WOW were those amazing!\n\nAll in all, you can't go wrong here.  Between the staff, the ambiance, and the food, it's no wonder it's hard to get a reservation here on busy weekends. Book your reservation early!"

We moved and the next table was in fact illuminated perfectly and provided that nice privacy while being part of a dining experience.\n\nFor our entree we went with a bone in Ribeye which we shared. The waiter had it split for us and at Medium Rare it was perfect. We ordered it prepared chimichurri style and it was nice. I would probably go with something else next time, but it was flavorful. We split the truffle maccaroni and the pickled onions and marrow jelly (amazing if you are a marrow fan!)\n\nWe will definitely go back on our next visit to the Wynn. Make reservations even it it is the same day and just a few hours before you desire them. I probably do not have to mention it, but the art is superb as well. My wife loved her cocktail as well.\n\nHave I mentioned that if you have ever enjoyed marrow, order the pickled onions and marrow jelly with your meat. Amazing!"

It is more of a new age steakhouse I feel like. Their scallops are perfectly cooked over a wonderful prosciutto and melon risotto that is cooked to perfection. The steak options are probably my favorite. They give you three different options to prepare your steak: traditionally, Chimichurri sauce (the Argentinian way), and pepper steak which cooks them over these tiny flavorful pepper and gives you three different types of sauces to taste with my two favorites are the peppercorn brandy sauce and the jalape\u00f1o hollandaise. Also have great desserts like their dousants. Must try in Vegas very underrated. Great atmosphere and decor. Service is good."

With a pole and flashing lights inside) and arrived at the Encore, Wynn Hotel, for dinner at Botero.\n\nSince we were a large party, the chef had created a pre-fix dinner. Our menus were printed with the birthday girl's name on it--saying \"Happy Birthday.\" Cute.\n\nFor my first course I chose the Ahi Tartare. Fantastic. It was absolutely perfect, presented beautifully, and the Ahi fresh.\n\nOur second course was the caesar salad, nicely presented with a breaded and fried anchovy (yummy!). It was slightly over-dressed, however I like light dressing, so I may be the exception, not the rule.\n\nThe only issue was the second course was presented before our first course had been cleared and our table had not been pre-set for the salad. Otherwise, all was good. We were in a little time-crunch, as we didn't want to lose our reservation at XS.\n\nFor the main course, we were given a choice of steak, Mediterranean Seabass, or Chicken. I wanted the steak--especially since this was a steak house...of sorts. But I also wanted us to try other things. So we shared the steak (DELICIOUS!!!!) and the Seabass. I was disappointed. I should have stuck to my guns and ordered the steak. \n\nSo, my message to you is this: If you eat red meat, and you like red meat, DO NOT PASS IT UP!\n\nDessert was another success. Brioche filled with preserves, and chocolate, and banana something-or-other (which was de-lish!)\n\nOverall, a pleasant experience with good food and (nearly perfect) proper service."

This was my first time trying bone marrow and it was interesting - kinda gooey, but it was good! \n\nThe portions were pretty big (20oz rib-eye!) that we all were not able to finish our steaks, so needless to say we did not order dessert.

I felt like they weren't that happy to accommodate my food allergies but then again they weren't rude about it either. However, I could feel that when the chef came out to discuss the allergies, he def wasn't too happy. I told him that my food allergies aren't that severe and that as long as the food is not made with the allergens that it's fine. And they did try to work around it but it was not 100% - the tuna tartare definitely had chili peppers which I'm allergic to and they accidentally served me broccoli even though we had swapped it out for asparagus. Still, I think it was a great experience and I would highly recommend this place to people without food allergies, maybe not so much to those with."

I have a thing about ordering Tuna Tartare at every restaurant that offers it.  So far, Wolfgang Puck at MGM Grand is my favorite.  However, Botero's Tuna Tartare comes in a very close second.\n\nThe steak was just as delicious as I remembered it to be from a year ago.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye to be split with a friend, covered in chimichurri sauce.  The bone-in ribeye taste like any other bone-in, however, it's the chimichurri sauce that makes the steak taste so fantastic!!  The husband ordered the NY Steak and the brother-in-law ordered the Filet Mignon.  Both got the chimichurri sauce.  \n\nI've been to many steakhouses in Vegas and this is probably one of my favorite places to go.  I would definitely come back."

That was easily forgiven after I ordered the best sangria ever. This place is fancy with the drink menu on an iPad with detailed descriptions of every drink when you click on the picture.  This place not only has the best sangria, but the best  fall-off-the-bone kind of Kobe Short Ribs (worth the $40). Those itself deserved a five star rating, but their Poached Wild Salmon ($39) and signature Ahi Tuna Tartare($19) was just mediocre for the price. In addition to the great food, I loved the fine art by Fernando Botero that was peppered all over the restaurant and ladies restroom."

Dark colors, servers definitely at your service, cool circular open dining room and outdoor patio, it just screams LUXURIOUS!  \n\nOf course, if you want to feel like a million bucks your are going to feel like you spent a million bucks, but it's worth every penny.  From the gorgeous hostess, chic food runners, to chivalrous and hilarious servers, this is top customer service.\n\nI started off with the recommended ahi tuna.  They somewhat marinate it in something but it was so fresh and cold with bits of avocado and mango.  It melted in your mouth with great explosions of sweet and salty bits (that's what she said).  \n\nMy divas and I had either the New york Strip or Filet Mignon.  The NY Strip had no fat, they removed it for you and still completed at 8oz!  I had the Filet Mignon with Chimichurri sauce.  WOW!  Cooked at Medium rare, juicy and the not so overpowering sauce complemented the peppered steak.  \n\nFor sides, we had the broccoli which was tender and buttery along with the loaded potato gratin.  Let me tell you, it was like a layered lasagna but with thin slices of potatoes.  I would recommend this side.\n\nThen to end it all we asked our server, who was right with everything and we tried the frozen chocolate candy bar.  Literally, a candy bar filled with layers of caramel, delicate wafer, chocolate ice cream, peanut butter then hugged with dark chocolate.  \n\nWhat a way to end the night!"

Steak was prepared to perfection... sides were delectable, and desserts were both original and delicious, giving you a sample of something a little different than what you come to expect from the Vegas steakhouse.\n\nYou can tell chef Mark LoRusso has the ability to balance standard favorites with new age flare to create a memorable meal.\n\nIf you eat one place the next time you're in Vegas, make it Botero."

            "review": "In five star vegas hotels, you expect everything to be marked up. However, Botero is not as overpriced as one might expect. I came for a nice steak dinner on a Friday night - - it was halloween night. I anticipated a crowd, but the restaurant was very large, spacious and dark, so the atmosphere was great for a nice date. Here is a list of items I ordered:\n\nRibeye Steak: I am a sucker for ribeye steaks, and Botero really hit the spot. As a steak-lover, that ultimate sear on a steak that I cannot do at home is what i pay the extra cost for (and the higher quality meat). The steak was juicy, tender, medium-rare, flavorful (it was fatter than expected, which contributed to the nice flavor), and beautifully seared. Even at slightly above the cost of a ribeye steak in nice LA restaurants, the money was well-worth it.\n\nSeafood Platter: I had a mix of oysters, alaskan crab legs, and prawns. Other than the Alaskan crab legs, which I don't eat as often, the oysters and prawns were average. Seafood is generally expensive, so don't expect otherwise.\n\nBone Marrow: I have had bone marrow at many many places, and this is comparable to CUT. Because bone marrow has a fat and oily texture, the crispy bread and sweet caramelized onion really complements and reduces the fatness. This was very well done, and was delicious. \n\nMac n Cheese: it is very difficult to make a bad mac n cheese, but it is also hard to make an amazing mac n cheese. This one was serviceable when I ate at Botero, but for whatever reason as leftovers, this was amazing.\n\nMilk bonbon Lollipops: My girlfriend really wanted a picture of the lollipops, so we ordered 2. At 3.50 a pop, it was not too expensive, and was actually quite good. After a full meal, the popsicle was a nice finishing touch and was not overwhelming because each popsicle does not come with much ice cream."

They had great service and food was good. We had the shellfish tower for the appetizer. It came with oysters, gulf prawns, Maine lobster, and crabs. I'm not a big fan of oyster, but I tried it just for the heck of it. It was amazingly good. I ended up have two of them and wished I could eat the whole entire rack. All the other seafood on the tower were also so fresh and the cocktail sauce was so good. For the entree, I had the bone in filet (16 oz.) with the Chimichurri sauce on top. It was good, but it was way too much taste for one girl to handle. The whole table shared sides of truffle macaroni & cheese, mild mushrooms, and creamed spinach. OMG... all of us were having food coma. To end our dinner, we had mini ice cream sandwiches. They were so cute and we had all different flavors. It was good and different than regular ice cream sandwiches. I personally prefer the regular ice cream sandwiches (chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream)  than the special ones the pastry chef made here. Overall, I had a great experience."

Mr. Wynn has not only created a fantastic environment with his resorts which elevates high end hospitality well beyond the traditional beige + gold = 'fancy' equation, but he has opened his property up to near exclusivity with Vegans and Vegetarians. I end up at the Wynn or Encore every single time I am in Vegas because of this. We always have a mixed group of carnivores and vegans, and we know that we can go to ANY establishment in the Wynn and everyone will be thrilled with their food and Botero was no exception. The vegan menu is not just a compromise of what the chef can do, but a full menu with several choices for each course. None of this \"vegetable stack\" or \"we can do marinara with no meatballs\" stuff either, but well thought out and beautifully executed dishes. I had the potato risotto to start [the sauce was divine], the Vegan Chicken Pot Pie [Amazing!] and the penultimate, Vegan Churros for dessert. I can never have another vegan donut, fritter or churro again, because these things were so immensely good that I am now going to be forced to come here every time I am in Vegas, and all other attempts pale in comparison. Thank you Botero and Mr. Wynn for acknowledging a population who revels in both good, healthy and ethical food as well as high end hospitality."

Note that if you ask for your steak to be cooked medium well, this restaurant in particular will butterfly your meat, so keep that in mind.\n\nWe informed the waitstaff beforehand that our dinner was for a bachelorette party, and when they brought out the dessert, they had presented it beautifully with candles (which we provided in advance) spelling out the bride-to-be's name. They were super accommodating about this.\n\nI would warn that if you plan on going with a group that has the tendency to get a bit loud (and who wouldn't after a few drinks when you're in Vegas!?), you may want to take your party elsewhere. We unfortunately were told to keep our volume down because someone had complained, and that put a bit of a damper on our celebratory mood.

But it does take a something more than a properly cooked, well seasoned steak, accompanied by great service to stand out to me."

            "review": "I almost missed out on Botero because of the mixed Yelp reviews.  Goes to show that it pays to dine outside the box from time to time.\n\nService was swell and the atmosphere excellent, trendy but not obnoxiously so, with lovely Boteros hanging all over the walls.  There's a special kind of welcome in those paintings, an invitation to eat that can only be extended by adorable toonish fat people.  Perhaps this explains why I stuffed myself to miserable excess.\n\nIt started with the bread tray, which came with three types of bread.  I didn't try the sourdough, but the olive was great and the cranberry was absolutely fantastic.  The bar was set, and it was high.\n\nI came with a party of seven consisting of my very best friends who I've shared germs with since middle school, so this dinner was about as close to family style as you can get at a nice restaurant.  I had a fork in every pot, and there were many, many pots.  Everything was washed down with swills of a mellow pinot noir.\n\nA shellfish tower kicked us off with fresh bites of select oysters, gulf prawns, Maine lobster, crab, and raw scallops in tangy sauce.  I found the lobster to be the least enjoyable tier of that particular tower.  The oysters and scallops were excellent.\n\nFor my meal, I ordered the olive oil poached halibut with haricot verts, fingerling potatoes, and warm balsamic vinaigrette.  This was a lovely piece of fish.  We split a variety of sides, which were great.  The asparagus and mushrooms were solid, and the truffled mac and cheese was a knock-out, smooth, rich, and aromatic.  The bone marrow with onion jam was a treat in that I'd never had bone marrow before, but I found it a little disappointing, with less flavor than I'd hoped for.\n\nBites from the buffet that is my friends' plates revealed a whole range of yumminess.  My favorite of the bunch was the \"pinwheel of wild salmon,\" which was salmon prepared two ways, both delicious.  One involved a butternut squash and apple risotto, and the other a roasted cauliflower puree and lemon caper emulsion.  The salmon was nicely cooked and the accompanying flavors were a good interesting mix of sweet, salty, and yum.  Ahi tuna tartare with mango, avocado, and crispy ginger was also a notable dish.  The organic roasted chicken and the prime rib were good, but not particularly moving.  Ditto for the potato gnocchi with roasted tomato and parmesan - decent gnocchi but mildly boring.\n\nDessert was excellent.  By the time the menus came around most of our party felt too stuffed to order and we ended up splitting two desserts (that's me eating 70%, the other six people eating 30%, as I am not a normal, socially acceptable human being).  The warm banana bread pudding with homemade banana ice cream was just dazzling.  The mini ice cream sandwiches (chocolate with vanilla, chocolate with mint, strawberry cheesecake, and rocky road) came in an adorable rack and tasted great, my favorite being the rocky road.\n\nAll in all, this was a fabulous meal in a pleasant environment.  I was very happy that I had chosen to wear a rather billowy dress to dinner, because underneath those skirts, my belly was straight out of a Botero."

It was a generous portion.  I enjoyed it until I got to the strongly flavored olives that lent a pickled flavor to the vegetable layer under my fish.  Which also gets me to the question of why did our waiter keep asking if we were ordering a vegetable side.  To appease him, we ordered the Brussel sprouts.  They were barely touched.  Probably because we had large portions and there was nothing special about them.  BTW there was also nothing special about the calamari appetizer either.  I probably would have given Botero 3 stars if it wasn't for the delicious Kobe beef short ribs and the steak."

The food arrived before the drinks, which was annoying, since we had to remind him about our drink order a couple times. The quality of food was so-so. Definitely not what i expected for a pricey restaurant at Wynn/Encore. We got the beef tartare (too fatty and heavy) tuna tartare (ok but not remarkably flavorful) crudo tasting (scallops tasted funky, the rest was ok) grilled calamari (also not the best i've tasted). We had no desire to order any entrees after that, especially since the waiter seemed to loose the track of time from time to time. We asked for the desert menu, in about 10 minutes of waiting we had to ASK AGAIN this time another waiter (ours disappeared completely:). So we left with a slightly bitter experience of a failed dinner. The 2 stars of my review go to interior designers of the place (always astonishing and impressive at Wynn/Encore)."

I didn't order any sides because my dish came with vegetables, I just ate that. Aside from paying pretty much $100 per person, I'd say this steakhouse is one of the best in las Vegas. Not to mention the decor. It has a relaxed feel and you have the option of dining poolside, which is nice if you want a bit of fresh air. The staff is nice too, attending when necessary. Overall this restaurant is worth going to over and over again even if it means selling one of my kidneys."

The oysters were great but the knock out were the prawns,  in Bloody Mary marinade and cilantro! Yummy!  As my salad I went for the arugula burrata salad.  Some may question spending this much on a salad that consists mostly of a tomato but in today's world, tomatoes taste nothing like they once did or supposed to taste. This tomato on the other hand was pure perfection. It reminded me of eating my grandparents tomatoes they would bring back from Florida in the early 90's.  They were red, juicy and non acidic, almost sweet!  If I could recommend anything here it would be the domestic lamb. It was cooked so perfectly, medium rare, exactly as ordered and was by far the most succulent lamb I've eaten in a while. The side of beans were memorable as well. The duck would have been better if that was cooked further than rare,( we ordered medium) but the sauce was also tangier and overpowering than I prefer, but I still devoured it. The Mac n cheese was unbelievably great, and HUGE, a side to feed many kings or queens.  I left more on the plate than anything else!"

We dined here years ago when it first opened and while I remember it being good then, this time was really quite spectacular and memorable. We met up with friends making us a group of 8 and sat at a table in the bar area. We made our way to the main dining room and were presented with such an extensive list of wine and cocktails, it took us some time to decide. \n\nI enjoyed a glass of French white wine which paired beautifully with the crudo tasting appetizer which I ate as my main meal. The side of spicy chili and garlic broccoli rabe served in a small black cast iron skillet was a real star that night. Others enjoyed the truffle Mac and cheese, filet steaks, olive oil poached halibut and some raw bar items. To top it off, we shared the bone marrow which was so gigantic and rich that it nearly sedated our group! I didn't partake but the guys in our group seemed to enjoy. Portions here are ample and while it isn't inexpensive, you definitely feel satiated after dining here. We skipped dessert in favor of some additional cocktails. \n\nThe vibe here is sophisticated but cool. The space is large, modern and looks out on the large Encore pool. Service was friendly and attentive. Perhaps the best part of Botero is the variety on the menu. Whether you're in the mood for a steak, some raw bar, or a piece of fish, Botero has something for everyone and it all seems to be cooked to perfection, beautifully plated and served by knowledgeable staff. We thoroughly enjoyed and I would definitely recommend."

But the restaurant  just didn't impress. \n\nWe received average  service-we were seated shortly after arriving at our reservation time. Our table was ok-super noisy in the restaurant, but it's pretty. \nOur server was unenthused and nonchalant about the food and our selections. We each ordered a drink, steak as well as creamed spinach (superb), whipped potatoes(excellent) and the \"famed\" french fries (ehhh-don't get the hype). \nI was excited that they had remembered it was my mom's bday (told them at reservation time) and they brought out a beautiful plate with a small ice cream cupcake and \"Happy birthday\" written out. Nice! But not spectacular. \nBill came-drink prices were crazy ( I realize it's vegas-but $25/glass of Cab?!) We all left feeling deflated. We were really looking forward to a 5* dining experience. We had a better server and a better time the next day at the good ol' Cheesecake Factory. \nwould not recommend Botero!"

She couldn't stop raving about it so I decided to have my birthday dinner here with my 2 best girlfriends before dancing off the calories at XS! (Right next door, btw)\n\nAmbience: Interesting & unique! At the bar, there is a shelf full of bottles on the ceiling & a swanky bar top.  My Jameson & Ginger went down particularly smoothly! While we were getting escorted to our table, a statue of a voluptuous lady rested in the middle of the restaurant. The lighting is dim and the tables are generously spread apart for an intimate meal with your date or guests.\n\nMeal: To start off our dinner, we ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartare for the table. It was surprisingly good. Then we all shared a bowl of Truffle Macaroni & Cheese. Personally, it was probably the best Mac&Cheese I've ever had. (My guilty pleasure) And for our entree, we all got the Petite Filets. My girlfriends really like it, but I wasn't too impressed. I asked for medium rare, but it was closer to medium.. medium well. So it was a little dry for my taste. It was good but maybe I should've gone in with less of an expectation! I asked for steak sauce and they brought over an array of them. It definitely helped!\n\nService: This is where Botero lost a star! I wish our server was more attentive. We even had to flag her down to order. (Our menus were closed and sitting in front of us for quite some time) We had more interaction and assistance from the food runners and bussers. Maybe our server was a little shy and soft spoken by nature? I understand she had other tables too, but I expected a little more from a fabulous restaurant like Botero. But all in all, she was very nice and pretty. (:\n\nMust go back for the Mac&Cheese! Maybe I'll try the seafood the next time around."

What did he expect from a bunch of girls who just want to have a good time in Vegas for a bachlorette party. He could have politely ASK me to remove the piece, but all he said was \"you need to take that off!\" I clearly remember his words because he was not nice about it. As I'm in the service industry myself, he should have said it in a more polite way. All I have to say is Brian was extremely rude! \n\nHowever, the event mgr and our server were Awesome!

My boyfriends cardinal rule is \"I judge fine dining restaurants by the filet\", so he ordered his rare, as usual. I decided the times I've come before that I fill up and enjoy the sides more than ordering a single entr\u00e9e. We went nuts ordering sides, I highly recommend all of these: truffle mac and cheese, tater tots, wild mushrooms, creamed spinach with fried egg, whipped potatoes, and Botero fries... YES, we ordered every single one of these in one sitting... belt busters but so good."

I took my wife out for our anniversary and decided to try something other than my favorite at SW. Botero disappointed badly. We had the filet and the lobster. \n\nI asked for a bone-in fillet. I got a bone-in rib eye. Not a big deal, but the waiter made the situation awkward by showing me his notes and telling me i was wrong. Ok, maybe.  I apologized and said if its not a big hassle could I get the fillet.  \n\nIt came 15 min later and it was completely raw, and i mean it was beyond rare. I asked the waiter to see in his notes if i asked for rare or med-rare, and he said med-rare. I asked him to take a look at our steaks. He looked at it and said, \"is it too much or not enough?\"  I looked at him in disbelief and said would you mind cooking this a little more?\n\nLater, the manager came over and asked us if everything was taken care of.  He had heard about what had happened.  I explained to him that i wasnt upset about human error, but that snappy comment from the waiter was uncalled for. He said he saw the cut and agreed it was very rare. He offered to give us dessert but i had lost my appetite and declined. After a bit he came back and said he took the steak off our check. I thanked him for his generosity, said the meal was comped anyways.  He was very nice, and for that i added a star.  \n\nTruthfully, there are a million better places to spend $250 for 2 than Botero. Even free, i would prob not return.\n\nOh, and the chimichurri is not really a classic chimichurri.  It's olive oil and herbs.  And the ceasars that i read about below how great it was. It was better at the buffet. The ahi tartare was decent."

I cannot stress enough how good this restaurant is, and despite the high price point (expect to pay atleast 100 / person leaving, with no drinks!) it is sooo worth it.  The best value and taste are the scallops.  I swear these scallops were the size of my fist (though i have small hands), and the broth was amazing!!  The extras that go with the dishes are quite delectable as well.  My crave-worthy must try recommendations: The polenta cake and mushroom, truffle macaroni and cheese (though i couldn't have more than a bite due to my dairy allergies), the Bone Marrow and the french fries.  Although it's a steakhouse, this restaurant packs so many tasty goodies, in fact I think it's the one restaurant I would fly back to Vegas just to eat at.  It helps to that it's directly across from Hermes, so you can get some shopping done while waiting for your table."

Try and ignore the huge Fernando Botero statue in the middle of the dining room. It's difficult, but you'll enjoy your meal more if you're not distracted. This is made easier because the dining room is \"upscale dark\". However, the views of the pool outside are nice, it looks like the patio might be really nice as well. \n\nI have only had the Chateaubriand here along with various sides. It's fantastic. The whipped potaoes, asparagus, and other sides are good. The brussels sprouts (if they have them)  are pretty much worth it all by themselves. One interesting thing about the food is that the \"pepper steak\" preparation listed on the menu isn't a black pepper rub. They cut jalapeno peppers with the steak and leave serve them on the plate.\n\nAt the end of the night, the bill will be high (not higher than other Vegas Strip steakhouses) but the food is excellent."

They were.\n\nOn this visit, my dining partner and I ordered the same dish - the petite fillet mignon.  I ordered the scallop pairing with my dish.  Now, like I've said before, its hard to mess up quality meat.  But, what made this dish extraordinary, which many steak places seemed to be swaying away from is the sauces.  Our steaks came with three very different yet all equally delicious sauces.  In all honesty this was the key to an amazing steak dinner.  But, not only did those sauces pair wonderfully with the meat, they paired great with the seafood.\n\nIn LV rarely do you go back to a place to eat, there is just so much to discover.

We tried making reservations everywhere on a Saturday night and unsurprisingly got nowhere, until we called Botero. They had seating on the patio and though we were hesitant about it (90 degree Vegas summer weather, even at 8 pm) we went ahead. I am so glad we did! \n\nTo start with, the ambiance on the patio was perfect. Intimate, cool, classy. The music was good (a lot of Norah Jones and the like) and it just had a good feel overall. The interior is very dark and sexy, the patio better lit and intimate. The servers were great (water and wine always filled), knowledgeable about the food (I'd say a little less confident about the wine), and didn't hover. \n\nThe food was amazing here. I've had scallops at my fair share of restaurants but Botero's scallops blew them out of the water. No competition. They were cooked just right- not too soft, not too chewy- with the perfect amount of flavoring. The presentation was great, the taste even better. Their truffle mac n cheese and broccoli sides were also divine, and it seemed to be the general consensus that the food at Botero's is up there with the best that we've all ever experienced. My friend got the salmon which she loved, and one of the guys got the surf & turf while my boyfriend got some prime rib (which I had a bite of- perfectly seasoned). \n\nI wish we had room for dessert but after all of that we were ready to gamble and dance. I'd definitely recommend Botero for a nice dinner out. It is pricier, but the quality of the restaurant is great. My only gripe is that the bathroom is tiny - 2 stalls and 1 sink- but not enough to stop me from going back."

We love to try new places, and as long as the meal and the experience is awesome, we're fine shelling out the money occasionally. We were sat on the patio which was absolutely perfect and peaceful. The pool was closed at that point, so it was picture perfect. \n\nWe both got the fillet with the lobster tail add on and shared the truffle mac & cheese. I'm sure we got an appetizer, but I think the steak was so memorable I can't remember if we got salads to start. Let me tell you about this steak, the knife practically melted right through it. It was the kind of first bite where you close your eyes and go straight to a food orgasm. We also split a bottle of red wine and had a post dinner dessert wine. I took a picture of the receipt because it was the most (and probably will remain the most) money I spent on a meal, around $550 once tip was included. To be fair, about $100-$150 of it was on a bottle of wine and the single dessert wines. You can look at their pricing online, so it won't be some huge surprise. \n\nIf you're looking to splurge on an amazing steak, this is the place to go. We move around a lot due to my husband's job, so we've already agreed that Botero will be our last meal in Vegas when that time comes. Although, when you have one of the best meals ever, maybe it's best just to do a one and done."

Who needs Charmin when you can have the elegance of Botero?\n\nAt $65 for a 5 course tasting menu, it wasn't too bad of a deal. Since we like trying new things together, we ordered the Curried Carrot Stuffed Squash and the Gardein Chicken entrees instead of getting another tasting menu of the same thing.\n\nI don't think we've ever done a full on tasting menu. I was under the ASSumption that the portions for each course would be tiny. Boy, was certainly mistaken! The dishes that comprised the tasting menu could easily have fed us both. Add the squash and chicken, you can easily see how I ended up having to be rolled outta here.\n\nThe food was fantastic as I have come to expect from all of the fine restaurants in Uncle Steve's collection. I loved the stuffed squash, even though it was a relatively simple dish. Often times these restaunts fall back on using Gardein all too much. However, you can easily see why since their chefs are able to craft amazing food utilizing it.\n\nOne note, don't stuff yourself so silly that you don't have room for dessert. I wanted to order all of their tantalizing desserts, yet there was no more room as my dessert stomach was being overfilled from my main tank. Order everything if you must, just be prepared to take a doggie bag back to your hotel.\n\nThe Vegan menu must be quite popular as a gentleman to our left was enjoying his own tasting menu as well as half of the couple further over. Seems the word is out that The Wynn is the place to be in Vegas if you're Vegan and have a little bit (make that a lot!) of extra cash to spend.\n\nThe tasting menu will change seasonally yet one constant will remain. The excellent service. It's a bit off putting to me to be waited on hand and foot. Chair pulled out, napkin unfolded for me, silverware and plates constantly getting replaced, etc. However, you quickly get used to this life and never want to go back to casual dining again."

They were surprised to see it paired like an apple pie - the apple tart & ice cream pairings were unique & surprising & they actually ended up liking the pairing\n\nEntrees for both meaty party-goers included steak & each was perfectly cooked, very tender & delish.  Buddy #1 got the regular mashed potatoes & Buddy #2 got the Lobster Mashed Potatoes.  Again - huge eye rolls over the lobster & Buddy #1 secretly wished she had ordered these\n\nVeggie crew got the Pumpkin Soup followed by Crispy Tofu & Quinoa Pasta\n\nPumpkin Soup was very savory & no hint of cream.  This soup reminded me of a pumpkin soup we had in Napa a while back & while it was pumpkinny, it was not the usual pumpkin soup you'd expect to find - nice change from the norm\n\nThe Crispy Tofu tasted like a big plate of fish sticks w/ a heap of spinach - not my taste at all & I was SO glad I hadn't ordered it but those that did each liked their dishes okay.\n\nThe Quinoa Pasta was like short pieces of spaghetti in a ton of sauce (less sauce might have been better) w/ lots of porcini mushrooms.  The shrooms were tender & flavorful - the sauce had a lemonny kick in the beginning bite & I thought this was going to ruin the dish for me as I do not like citrus in my food but the taste went away as the bite mellowed & there was no lemonny aftertaste so I ended up liking the dish\n\nSis chose the Mocha Pot de Creme for dessert & said it was thick, rich & creamy.  BF & I got the Pumpkin Martini & OMG you *have* to get this drink!  It was like a slice of pumpkin pie in a glass!  Everyone was totally jealous they had chosen other drinkys instead of this martini & rightly so!\n\nRandom people in costume walking around the restaurant - like an Angel who would extinguish your candle, make a little speech about lighting a candle for a wish, then lighting your candle again; a Devil walking around, promoting their \"Firewater\" cocktail; 2 people walking around w/ a big frame & an instant camera to take your picture.....made for an interesting experience\n\nSo have to say, overall we were fans of Botero & would definitely come back"

The chips are crispy without being too greasy, and the guacamole is flavorful and the perfect consistency. Perfect. 5/5 stars. I ordered the crab rolls, which were pretty good. The rolls they came in were excellent. The crab was fresh but too much mayo, and could have used a bit more flavor.  Boyfriend got the turkey club which he said was very good."

My husband ordered the filet (medium, peppercorn style) which came with three dipping sauces that were amazing! We ordered half an order of Botero fries and half an order of the whipped potatoes. \n\nThe steak literally melts in your mouth. It was so delicious. There was literally nothing wrong with our food. Everything was perfection. We had no room for desert, so we will have to come back. \n\nThe only hiccup we had was when our server had to leave and turned us over to another server (Monya?? Mona?) who never even came to check on us. We had a table next to us ordering more \"high price\" items (wine bottles) so she completely ignored us. We could have walked out and she wouldn't have noticed. Finally we got her attention and we paid. \n\nLuckily this didn't ruin our experience. Overall I highly recommend this place. Hands down!"

My buddy and I ordered two glasses of pinot noir, and ate from a great variety of bread. The chef gave us a complementary cookie with sweet jam on top, which was very tasty. We ordered rib eye steak, which was huge and well prepared. We also ordered grilled mushrooms on the side, which came in plenty and served on a medium bowl.

The bar up front is great fun and the staff seems to enjoy coming up with customized cocktails. Tell them what you like and they'll create something for you. [Mine turned out to be a Martini with pear vodka and elderflower liqueur, which was terrific.] The room is basically circular with a tremendous black Botero statue at the center, counterpointed by lighter-color floors and furniture. It overlooks the European pool and has outdoor seating. It was slam-full the night we were there and quite loud, so just know before you go that this is a high-energy night out, not a quiet, relaxing dinner. \n\nThe food was the strongest element for us. Each dish we had was sensational, with the appetizers being creative, tasty, and served in pretty substantial portions. The duo of crab and the salmon with Meyer lemon [!] were standouts. The bone-in New York Strip was really something special--juicy and flavorful but with an absolute minimum of fat. It was a nice thick cut and perfectly, simply seasoned plus cooked exactly to order. It's hard for me to imagine a steak ever being actually worth $52, but this one came as close as anything. The sides seem to be sort of the trademark of the restaurant. They came in little skillets and were big enough to share. We had the creamed spinach, grilled asparagus, and truffled corn pudding. All were sensational, but I'm still dreaming about that truffled corn pudding. The desserts weren't quite up to the standard of the first two courses for me--they're more whimsical than anything. Things like childhood-flavors cupcakes and a sort of be-your-own-Coldstone-Creamery where they bring a scoop of ice cream on a palette with various mix-ins along the edge. If you're looking for more traditional desserts, you won't find them here. \n\nAs I wrote earlier, it was absolutely packed. That did not affect the quality of the food at all, but the service was a touch slow. Courses came out of the kitchen quickly once ordered, but there was a bit of a delay to place the order, to get the dessert menus, and to get the check at the end.\n\nWe sampled most every restaurant at the Encore [except Switch] during our stay and this was the overall favorite. It's certainly not cheap, but nothing at Encore is. It's also a distinctive-enough experience to be memorable. If you're wanting a more low-key bar stop and dinner, you might try Sinatra."

The ambience was sexy yet classy and upscale with decor by the restaurant's namesake - a Columbian artist named Botero.  It was so nice that one of the girls joked that it was a place guys would bring you to pop the question not a place to have your final fling.  All of the service providers were friendly and polite from the hostess to our waiter to the busboys.  As part of our extremely reasonable prix fixe meal they threw in beautiful champagne cocktails in pink sugar rimmed glasses.  The olive bread and cheese crackers with airy house-made ricotta were amazing.  The prix fixe appetisers - giant prawns with assorted dipping sauces, caprese salad, and these hamachi rice crisp things blew us away.  All of the entrees were great and came with sides.  I had incredibly moist roast chicken and I loved the broccolini side.  The Botero fries I found just OK, but I am not much of a fry girl so take that with a grain of salt.  For dessert, they brought out a beautifully plated dessert buffet with a huge assortment of ice cream pops, cake pops, coconut marshmallows, and churros.  They also took the time to write a congratulatory message to the bride-to-be on the plate in chocolate script, none of which I had expected and all of which I got mad props for as the organiser!! :)  Thanks Botero for making this bachelorette night out memorable and making me look like a top notch bridesmaid/party planner!"

Highly recommend this for the great price and amount of food. We had Tino for our waiter and he was very attentive and fun. This place would have gotten 5 stars from us, but they had allowed a child under 5 yrs be there, who was loud (their policy is no children under 5). Anyway, great romantic/fun/delicious place for carnivores and vegans. Thanks to Steve Wynn again for a delightful vegan option!"

            "review": "Went here as part of a group of 12 for Valentine's Day dinner.  The ambiance and decor is beautiful, not that I expected any less.  We were seated at a large round table in the front of the restaurant, which was perfect for our group.  Service was slower than I expected from an establishment of this caliber, but they kept telling us it was the \"busiest night of the year\" so we let it slide.  Our group started off with different appetizers, none of which I tried because I was saving myself for the steak.  But the appetizers all looked good: oysters, caesar salad, soup, tuna tartare.\n\nFor the steaks, they offer 3 different methods of preparation.  Chimichurri sauce, peppercorn and traditional.  Not sure why anyone would go to a steakhouse and ruin their wonderful steak with sauce, but I guess to each his own.  Of course, I got my petite filet traditional style.  My fiance had the rib eye, aalso traditional style.  Both cuts of meat were cooked PEREFECTLY, very tender, and  flavorful.   We also shared the garlic brocolli, which was very good.  You can add lobster to your steak for just $20, which most people at our table did, and it looked very delicious.  I was here for the steak and the steak only, and that's why I didn't really bother with much else (except a few Grey Goose martinis).     \n\nOverall, I give the steak 5 stars.  The service, 4 stars."

Great service, appetizers like the octopus and tartare were amazing. \n\nThe sides: tater tots, Mac and cheese, sprouts, all top notch.\n\nAs for the steak, for the price you pay, it's mediocre in terms of tenderness!  Although the porterhouse was cooked to perfection, it still lacked a bit of flavor and sophistication for a $130 piece of meat.  Each bite would start in a magical place, then turn dry and chewy as you prepare to swallow.  Very strange actually, even the fattier parts were no match for the Vegas desert! \n\nWill give it another try in hopes of upgrading this review..."

The inside is trendy and there are obviously a number of artworks by Botero. The reception desk was less then welcoming and friendly but that was the only hitch. Once seated (we opted for the outside as the temperature was perfect). From that point on the service was impeccable. A visit from the sommelier proved helpful. They have a very large and nicely chosen wine list with a couple of hidden gems in the more modest price ranges (sub $120). Thank you. \n\nWe tried the Iberian pork appetizer which was amazing. Served with cold asparagus, toast, grilled red peppers and a cheese flan. A wonderful item to share. For dinner I chose the crusted fish with truffle dumplings and white asparagus. This was nicely executed and tasted great...but didn't wow me. My dining cohort, on the other hand, had a foodgasam with her choice of lamb chops. I managed to get a taste and can vouch that this was a strong choice. Also, need to mention the breadbasket...very nice assortment of breads and they were prepared with love. Definitely not an afterthought.\n\nOnly thing I found a bit odd was their music choice..I believe it was European club techno pop or if that's not a real category you get the idea. Seems like a demographic mismatch from who their clientele appeared to be. \n\nWe were too satisfied to try dessert or coffee. Overall, a great experience with memorable food."

However, the only thing I really didn't appreciate - was how our waiter kept trying to make us order more food!  We had to be firm with not adding extra side dishes - and then when we said we did NOT want any more dessert - he'd come back and ask again...and again...which became really annoying!

            "review": "Looking for a steakhouse without the pretentious and stuffy vibes? Go to Botero, located in the Esplanade (fancy word for walking area) at the Encore. With modern decor- black and white details, sleek furniture, cushioned pillars and a giant black Botero statue sitting atop a fountain in the middle of the circular dining room- Botero is a feast for the eyes as well as for one's stomach. \n\nWe got a table perfect for two right next to the giant Botero statue. And while my dining partner got a lovely view of the statue's derriere, I got a fantastic view of the pool area outside. \n\nAnyways, on to the food- the best part about Botero. \n\nThe bread basket came with two types of bread- mini cranberry baguettes and a fun-shaped plain french roll- and a yummy cube of herb butter. The bread was warm, but the butter was cold (I assume to keep it's perfect cube shape), which made it difficult to scrape without worrying about it flying off the plate. \n\nI ordered the Organic Roasted Chicken- quartered pieces of moist chicken (bone-in) roasted to perfection swimming in natural jus and topped off with a light frisee salad that had sweet roasted onions and shavings of roasted red tomatoes (or peppers) in it. Each component of the dish worked well together, balancing perfectly with one another to create a flavorful, savory & satisfying entree. \n\nWe also ordered a side of Broccoli with very small pieces of sun dried tomatoes and lots of garlic. The broccoli was fresh and green, and cooked well with still a bite to it. The sauce the broccoli was in was light and garlicky. Overall, a good choice.\n\nI also tried a few pieces of the Bone-In Rib Eye 20 oz Chimichurri-style cooked medium plus (between medium and medium-well apparently). The Chimichurri crust was a bit too salty, but the meat itself was tender and flavorful. \n\nNormally at fancy restaurants with high prices, you don't expect large portions. Well, expect large portions here. We were both surprised at the portion sizes, especially the chicken dish (20 oz steak is \"to be expected\" a lot of food). Needless to say, we were both full.\n\nThe service wonderful, the food delicious and the design playful and beautiful- What's not to like?"

I felt it didn't match the overall experience... (They played 80's top 40). I happen to LOVE 80's music, but didn't feel it lent anything to the atmosphere... The restaurant itself is named after Fernando Botero, a columbian artist. I felt they should have played something a little more low key. Otherwise, I thought it was a really beautiful place."

            "review": "Second night of our Honeymoon we decided to try Botero after some drinks at the lobby bar which is on the Encore side of the property.  After a quick 3 minute walk we were on the Esplanade entering Botero.  We got there around 10pm and were seated immediately.  \n     \n     The service here was impeccable.  I can't go into the details, because there were too many of them, but one thing that really stuck out was when the sommelier came over and asked for our first drink selection.  Having already had cocktails at the Lobby bar, we were ready for some champagne.  At this point I was a little flustered.  I hadn't yet opened the menu to order the appetizers, and I didn't really know what champagne to order, or whether or not I wanted a half or a whole bottle.  Half heartedly, I ordered a small bottle for around $65, and then proceeded to look at the food menu.  Our waiter Mike came and we placed our order of the hamachi tartare, the kobe beef tartare,  and the bone in 12 oz filet with a half lobster tail.  After that another sommelier, Blair, came to our table with two sparkling glasses of Rose' champagne.  \"We understand that you are on your honeymoon.\"\n\n\"Why yes, yes we are.\"\n\n     \"Well we want this dinner to be special for you, so these two glasses are on us.  When you are ready to choose a red for your entree, we'll come back to help you with your selection.\"  Like I said, impeccable.\n\n     The rest of the evening consisted of talking with our waiter Mike, and finding out that he is a Thai, and that he has 3 kids, and when they vacation they like to go to Hawaii to get away.     We also got more in-depth with our Sommelier Blair, who recommended a great Flying Goat Pinot, and told us a story about how the wine got its name, something to do with goats jumping over a fence to graze on grapes.  He's 28 and has been working at the restaurant since it opened.  It was interesting that in such a high end establishment, everyone showed such a human and friendly side.  And oh yeah, the food...or should I say porn... the Hamachi tartare was served on a bite sized  bed of fried rice cake and had a teriyaki inspired flavor.  The kobe beef tartare was finely minced and ruby red served with micro greens and crostini.   Another little detail was when we ran out of crostini; Blair brought us another couple to finish off the appetizer. SERVICE!  \n\n     The steak and lobster combo was so good I chewed the bone, risking the embarrassment of being looked at like a heathen by the staff, and getting steak juice all over my new Michael Kors suit.  To end the evening, they brought us out a mini ice cream candy bar and two glasses of Sheri that had nuances of orange peel, honey, and grape.  That on the house  as well... a little good luck send off, and thanks for dining with them on our honeymoon.  If you watch the in room Wynn Television, the song playing when they highlight Bottero is \"Be Our Guest\" a fitting song from a Disney fairy tale.  Last night, they definitely satisfied the Beast in me, and did it with a lot of beauty as well."

Our server was thoughtful enough to ask if we had any time constraints- which we did, 9:30pm Le Reve show tickets- he planned our course presentation accordingly.\n\nIt was just the 2 of us.

And a shared entree: the short ribs with an added brussel sprout & pork belly side.\n\nThe beet salad was tasty, but something easily duplicated at home. The Crab Agnolotti (i.e. ravioli), however, we both agreed, was excellent- an app that is worth considering ordering as an entree. I could eat those little bad boys all night long. The mushroom tart was just OK, not something I would ever crave again. I didn't try the soup tasting as I was getting full & the entree hadn't event come out yet (DAMN BREAD!!!). The short ribs were good, but unremarkable. The combo of brussel sprouts and crispy pork-belly was unique & delicious and likely something I would return & have again.\n\nOverall, thoughtful, professional service. Beautiful atmosphere.

Same bread as every other steakhouse.  Tuna Tartare was decent.  Asparagus and burrata salad was mediocre and the asparagus was overcooked.  The mac & cheese was average.

Not everyone has money to splurge on dinners like this so if you're one of those people that would consider here for a \"special dinner\"- I'd recommend one of the MANY other steakhouses in Vegas.  (Del Friscos being my suggestion.)\n\nI got the 16 oz New York strip.  I typically get filet mignon when I'm out but when I cook, New York strips are my favorite cut. I made a mistake because the strip was so bad.  I just searched reviews on here and it looks like other people had good experiences with the cut.  In fact people keep mentioning something that simply did not hold true for me- there was so much fat on it.  There was a full, thick row of fat on the side of meat and it was the first thing I bit into.  It was also burnt.  I get my steak medium-rare and I appreciate having a crispy exterior with a soft inside but this was not the case.  What's odd is the pink inside was on par with medium-rare but the texture was so dry and tough.  If I had paid 66$ (pre-tax!) for that steak I would have sent it back and been pissed.  \n\nI tried a lot of the sides and I think the mac-and-cheese was the best.  The mashed potatoes were really standard, as well as all the veggies (creamed spinach/asparagus/mushrooms).  I have had side dishes stand out before at steakhouses but they were very run of the mill here.\n\nAside from the entree, everything else was great.  The service was very professional, helpful, and prompt.  We had quite a few seafood appetizers and they were very good.  The dessert... the doughnut one with peanut butter... was super good.  That was my favorite dish haha.\n\nThere are too many steakhouses in Vegas for me to ever recommend this one.  The quality of the steak just isn't what I'm used to at steakhouses of this caliber."

The Mushroom Creme Brulee, Artichoke hearts, Salad, Shrimp Cocktail, and a $14 Ice cream sandwich. I would complain about the money but this probably one of the best restaurants I have ate at at in Las Vegas. I will be definitely coming back..."

I'm not much of a surf & turf kinda girl anyway and thus lack sufficient appreciation for such menus...\n\nMy review is mostly about the service & the interior, which I thought Botero did so well that it makes it a great group-dinner spot, regardless of the food! The waiters were very nice and not-pushy & the ambiance is particularly fantastic - beautiful restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating that faintly plays electronic dance music in the background, at least in the outdoor section where we were seated. I thought that was a fun, unexpected twist for this kind of place. A good spot for 20-somethings to drink&dine before the night out in Vegas - sets the mood for a night of excess (which happens to be the name of the club - xs- next door) and dancing!"

It was a bit surprising, however, that the sommelier asked us if we wanted to let it breathe before we drank it - of all people, it should have been clear to him that this bottle needed to breathe.  Next, we ordered the crudo tasting which was delicious (especially the hamachi).  Would recommend.  We split the 28-day aged NY strip steak which was a beautiful cut, seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Yums!  We then finished it all off with the signature dessert - milk chocolate bon bon lollipops!  A cute, delicious, whimsical way to end the meal.  NOM!  Will come back for the food and the memories!   Beware though, Botero is NOT cheap."

There was nothing wrong with it but it didn't stand out.  I had the Halibut which I think was supposed to be parmesean encrusted, but it wasn't.  It was cooked to death- literally and figuratively- and tasteless.  Beyond that, it seemed very uninspring as a fine dining establishment.  It seemed like a restaurant in search of a personality.  I'm glad other people had better experiences."

            "review": "(Best read with the accompaniment of film noir music and a crisp city inflection)\n\nIt was hot.  muggy like a coffee holder hot.  I had picked a bad week to quit the smokes but business had dried up and I hadn't seen a case since an advertisement for lunch boxes slipped out of my copy for the evening times.  \n\nI shouldn't have been surprised when she walked into my room, looking like sex and trouble, hell, she was staying with me for crying out loud, but the lady was a specimen in short hemlines and legs that needed their own mile-markers.  \n\nShe had told me she had a proposition for me and no sooner had the words escaped past her lipstick I had flung my two button blazer over my shoulder and offered her the suddenly lonely inner crook of my elbow.  \n\nThe lady had needs, and unfortunately for me they all revolved around food.  Thankfully I always keep running reservations at two or three spots around town for just such a need so we strolled out of the room towards sustenance.  \n\nI kept my roscoe in my other coat because something told me this night would have more to do with fending off the looks of local roustabouts than plugging some unlucky sucker between the eyeballs, and if it came down to it, I'd gladly come to fisticuffs with some palooka in order to get things back on the straight and easy.  \n\nWe moseyed into Botero around a half after six less than twelve and I told the Dolls at the desk that the Dame I was with needed to have her rump sat at a table that'd fit the bill, and then to make my case I slipped them each a sawbuck and winked like a one-eyed man.  \n\nThey looked out at the empty restaurant and then asked me why I was talking like that and I told them lip would only get them an overbite so they took the bait and led us to what I no doubt believe was the best seat in the joint.  \n\nThis Botero fellow was a Columbian and my last run-in with them had left me two-slugs light and a pocket full of spinach, but I decided to curb that story and pulled out the Roundheels' chair.  We were seated at the center of attention, the best spot in the house, right behind the eight foot ass crack of the centerpiece statue.  \n\nThe stool-pigeon at the table next to us recommended the Ahi Tuna Tartare so we called for that with some of the Graacher Himmelreich because hey, the wars been over for a couple of years and I'm not the only GI who's gone too long without having a good German wine.  It smelled like bubblegum and tasted like the sweetness she was dishing me with eyelashes that looked more like tiny come-hither fingers.  Problem is, my name's not Hither.  \n\nThe sommelier was a real flash in the pan if you ask me, nice guy with all the right answers, for the questions I asked.  But was I asking the right questions?  We split the Caprese salad because everything Italian has moxie and the burrata cheese forced me to look this prize horse in the mouth, we considered each other for a couple of seconds before continuing on.  For dinner she fileted the Mignon petitely and I scalloped from day boats with the chef gerrymandering my dish and turning it into a real tomato.  \n\nThe man with the vino smarts spun a tale on meritage and the lady went French and we ate like Helen Keller sang...with our hands.  \n\nIt's a good thing the vitis vinifera worked cuz if it hadn't I might've had to squirt some metal (always keep the midget in my sock).  \n\nOverall this dump is a real snazzy joint and I'm glad this Jasper Botero chose to open it from the grave.  Don't indulge on too much hooch over near the bar, whoever designed it ran of room and decided to get all hanky panky with the ceiling, which would be fine, if ceiling was a misspelling of Celine, some cocktail doll with too much time on her hands, but unfortunately that ain't the case.  \n\nWe sauntered out on our getaway sticks trying not to appear hinky.  She was a looker and I was a gumshoe and we were in the thick of our food comas, thoroughly satiated. \n\nWe took it on the heel and toe, but not before she kissed me like her tongue had a message from a snitch.  \n\nI guess that's what I get for making reservations like Indiana Jones...choosing wisely."

Of course, my husband and I had steak (he had the Australian one, and I had a petite filet, which was not so petite). It is a stunningly beautiful restaurant with superb service, truly a unique experience that we will never forget. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the restaurant was very loud, it was fully packed and the tables are quite close to each other, acoustics may also contribute to the \"crowd\" sound. BTW don't miss taking a trip to the restroom, the entire place was truly a work of art."

We enjoyed the Wedge salad with pork belly (shared) and both got a filet with shrimp, filet with crab, with a side of whipped potatoes. Each steak came with 3 dipping sauces that were great. My steak was a little well done, asked for medium rare. However, my bf gladly traded with me.

Don't forget to add the foie gras!\n\nFor desert, be sure to try the cupcakes which comes in a set of 5 different flavors with ice cream pairings. The blood orange sorbet is delicious as well. \n\nGreat atmosphere, excellent service, food was out of control (in a good way). \n\nAdvisory: \n\nFour of us ate for $570, tip not included.

However before coming to Vegas I usually have a list of places I want to conquer but somehow....I end up here and what's great about  Botero is that it does not disappoint and I don't regret not going to the other places!! \n\nBotero is located in the Wynn, in between Wynn and Encore. \n\nUpon entering the restaurant, you are greeted by the hosts and their bar. The bar itself is small with a traditional bar setting and a few tables with oversized chairs to sit in while sipping your favorite drink before they call to seat you. \n\nThe restaurant is set to a sexy low dim light level with the help of a fountain in the middle. You can see the nightclub Surrender from almost every angle when sitting down. \n\nI am always greeted promptly and served with their selection of amazing breads. On the last few occasions that I've gone, their selection of bread were always different. It is served with a lemon infused ricotta cheese spread and it is flavorful. I don't think I ever want butter on my bread ever again. It is light with a hint of lemon taste to it. \n\nFor starters, we've ordered the crudo tasting and although small, it is one of my favorite. You get to sample a little bit of everything. The fish are sliced perfectly. Delicate yet still deliver big on flavor. It is fresh and melt in your mouth. The selection of fish on the plate are easy on the palate for a starter. \n\nOn one other occasion, the special of the night was a tomahawk steak. Not only was this beefy awesome to goodness amazing but it was huge. All of our mouth dropped open when we saw the size of it. Two guys gobbled down on it and there was still meat left. The tomahawk was the highlight of their meal. It was cooked to perfection. Perfectly pink in the center and tender. The flavor of the meat was marinated perfectly. No condiments were required. \n\nOn my most recent trip, I ordered the brioche crusted salmon. I thought it was weird at first but after the first bite, I was sold. The buttery flavor from the brioche crust on the salmon played very well into the flavor of the salmon. The salmon was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I ate it happily and finished it without stopping. \n\nFeeling already bad....we ordered the truffle Mac and cheese to add more onto our mouth. Yes, it is creamy, cheesy, dense, and rich. You get a good taste of the cheese and then the truffle plays in the background without overwhelming anything else. I can honestly sit and eat the entire Mac and cheese. \n\nThe desserts here fills me with delight!! There is something about simple desserts that satisfy the soul after having a fulfilling meal. The selections are seasonal and I always feel like it compliments the entire experience. Some desserts are very rich (dark chocolate) and some are light (seasonal sorbets). \n\nThe service is pretty attentive and the waiters and waitress ensure that our fluids are topped off and clean plates are always there.\n\nThere was only a single time when service lacked attention and the food took longer than their usual wait time but other than that one misfortune, service and quality of our meals have been great."

I'm not going to yelp about the other highlights, so I'll concentrate on Botero. \n\nWe made late reservations for 9pm (I suggest you make reservations well before you arrive to Vegas) and got seated after ten minutes or so. The decor was nice and everyone around seemed to be pretty baller. We sat next to the huge Buddha with a view of the pool and young ladies with older men. \n\nI shared the Chateaubriand for two with my friend (for $110) and he got an extra Maine lobster tail\nMy other friend got the Petit Filet for $44\nMy two other friends got the Japanese Kobe 7oz for $175 each. My jaw dropped when I heard them order, but I'll get to that later.\nWe also ordered some foie gras, whipped potatoes and wild mushrooms.\n\nMy Chateaubriand was huge and even though it was for two, we couldn't completely finish it. The wine reduction gave it some excellent flavor as well.\n\nMy friends who got the Japanese Kobe also ordered lobster tails and they wanted me to try it out (since I probably would never order a $175 steak). I did and it was the best I've put in my mouth (fighting. urge. to. say. \"that's. what. she.....\") okay. best thing ever. You could see all the marbling, it melted in your mouth and there was a party in my mouth of tastes. The only thing was it was a bit too salty and both of them got tired of it before they finished (and it's only 7oz). Those two bites were good enough for me though - it's nice to just know what real Japanese Kobe tastes like (those kobe burgers or sliders or whatever they have at chain restaurants? yeah, no....not even close to being in the same family as this steak). \n\nSince we had a late dinner, we finished at almost 11pm and we had a good view of the club XS. We walked on by because bottle service there is even more ridiculous than the price of Japanese Kobe. All in all a great experience - just four stars because of the ridiculous price, but what do you expect from Vegas?"

It's just confusing the customer.\n\nAnyway, a friend and I shared the Porterhouse for 2 with the pepper-style sauce/topping on the side. The porterhouse was cooked a beautiful medium rare. The only gripe is that the portion of strip to filet mignon wasn't as great as I expected...only had like 3 uneven cuts of filet mignon...However the steak was cooked beautifully and it tasted great. The sauces were not necessary.\n\nAnother group of friends shared the double cut ribeye for 2 and had the coffee rub on it. It was cooked a beautiful med rare too.

And I'm usually not a fan of hamachi) also not too fishy tasting for people who aren't keen on raw fish.\n\nI ordered the petite filet (8 oz) and bf ordered the 12 oz filet both in traditional and medium rare. The meat was cooked more like medium but was still very tender and juicy. It was also thick and at least 2 inches high. It came with a fig cookie which I thought was a very nice touch to add to the flavor of the meal. \n\nWe also ordered the truffle Mac and cheese. This was the best part of the meal. Not overwhelming in cheesiness and had a crispy layer on top. It came in a flat claypot type of dish.\n\nFor dessert, we got the ice cream cupcakes, and to be honest, we weren't expecting so many cupcakes. There were 6 total, all diff flavors. The cake part was a bit dry but I suspect it's because they were refrigerated to keep the ice cream from melting. \n\nWe were happy with our meal except for our drinks.

            "review": "Lets get the pet peeves out of the way (they were small and don't merit a star reduction): Basically just the music. At a fine dining experience I just don't expect to hear Lady Gaga or that stupid \"your amazing\" song. Other than that I guess the greaters could have been more professional - we came early (before dinner service started) and she just said they weren't ready for us... no mention that we could have a drink at the bar that was right in front of her face but I know I am nit picking.\n\nWith that out of the way everything was perfect, really.  The service and food was fantastic.  We ordered the Vegan tasting menu which we loved. Out of 5 dishes, 4 were perfect and one was too salty.  When the server saw we didn't finish the salty dish he insisted on bringing us out another one which was great (I wouldn't of sent it back - if its my personal taste I don't bother, only if there is something they screwed up).  Vegan bread and butter was great. Also for the extra sensitive vegans out there I would say there is little risk of them mistakenly giving you something not vegan because they were smart and set up protocols so all the servers know you are vegan. For example they bring the vegan butter out in a bowl (but regular butter on a plate) so even the bussers that you didn't talk to know to replace with vegan butter even without talking to you or your server.\n\nVegans of las vegas, stop patronizing restaurants that don't have a vegan line up and stick with the Wynn and Encore that have great vegan options in EVERY SINGLE restaurant!!!"

            "review": "We were looking for a special place to splurge for our 15th anniversary and decided on Botero - and I'm so glad we did.  I'm newly vegan-ish and was really looking forward to trying some of the vegan options at Wynn and Encore - I've been obsessed with elevated vegan dining.  I had the vegan tasting menu - and I can honestly say from the staff to the food was probably the best dining experience I've ever had. \n\nStarting with a breadbasket filled with yummy rolls and breads - my favorite being the soft pretzel roll served with vegan butter.  Next up was a gorgeous, lush and creamy Cauliflower soup made with soymilk and almonds - just stellar.  \n\nThe Panzenella Salad, microgreens with  tiny slivers of pear and apple served on a wood plank and perfectly dressed with a vinaigrette, was pretty great.  The pear and apple slivers were like tiny flavor explosions in my mouth.  Nice and balanced against the creaminess of the soup.\n\nQuinoa Pasta with cashew cream was delish as well, although maybe not as memorable now that I'm writing this review 2 months after we dined.  I'm not a huge eater and was already getting fairly full at this point - but I took a deep breath and plowed onward.  \n\nNext up Roasted Acorn Squash with toasted tofu - topped with toasted pepitas which added some crunch.  Now, to be honest, I kind of think that roasted squash is kind of a vegan cop-out in a way, fairly obvious and not too out of the box.  That said it was really well done with clear squash flavors that bordered on buttery.  \n\nI'm not much of a sweets person, but the Pear Crumble for dessert was quite good.  The staff recognized our anniversary with a couple of complimentary grape sorbet canels to split which were a perfect pick-me-up after having so much stellar food. \n\nThe service was friendly and welcoming, something I personally enjoy in a high-end restaurant. \n\nExpensive? YES!  But worth it!"

            "review": "I visited Botero this past weekend and had an amazing meal and fantastic service.  The restaurant was beautiful with both indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating is right by the pool, so it's a great view if you prefer al fresco dining.  \n\nI had a reservation, so the hostess promptly escorted me to my table next to the window looking out at the pool.  I chose to sit indoors, but I was offered my choice of either.\n\nMy server quickly came over and I asked for the vegan menu.  He went over the options with me and pointed out some of his favorites.  Per his suggestion, I decided to go for the vegan tasting menu.  \n\nVegan bread and butter was brought out for me and it was delicious.  I ate the whole basket even though I had four courses AND dessert still to come!\n\nEvery single course was fantastic (photos included in my review).  I will tell you a little about each course:\n\nArtichoke soup with vegan ricotta: delicious and presented very well.  Ricotta and cashews in the bowl and the server poured the broth on top\n\nRoasted hearts of palm \"bone marrow\": This sounds weird for someone who doesn't eat animal products, but it was amazing!!!  The grilled country bread and onion jam with it were perfect.\n\nAncient grains penne and morel mushrooms:  This was delicious!!  One of my favorite courses.  It was tossed in fava bean pesto and was seriously paradise for my tastebuds.\n\nPortobello steaks and kale polenta: I was so full by the time this came along, but it was fantastic.  I was severely impressed and pleased by this dish.  Cooked perfectly, presented perfectly.\n\nStrawberry rhubarb pie:  Usually the tasting menu comes with a chocolate dessert, but I don't like chocolate.  I asked for this one instead.  It was delicious!!  Strawberry almond ice cream and almond brittle on top of the delicious pie.  \n\nThe food was delicious and the service was impeccable.  The timing of the courses was right on as well.  Just so you know, I am 5'6\" and 110 pounds and I ate ALL of this food, every last bite.  It was that amazing!  Well done Botero, well done."

            "review": "Oh, where to begin with this spectacular fine dining establishment within Encore? I have now been privileged enough to dine here four times in the past 15 months or so. I remember our first experience being underwhelming... but the last three? 5 stars in every facet of each experience. These last three times: January, March, & June-- just this past weekend. \n\nTIP: Call days ahead for reservations to secure a decent time for your party. They can get rather busy and it's no fun to be stuck with a 10:00 pm reservation time.\n\nThe restaurant itself is quite intriguingly designed. Everything is \"plus-sized\" (to be at the very least euphemistic)-- the chairs, pictures, pillars, windows, etc. It can be very dark inside but this complements the upscale and classy atmosphere. The tables, however, are perfectly lit; details on your dining mates' faces are crystal clear (but wait until the Mango Fuego hits you). They play an EDM/electronic mix in the background and it had fantastic song selection. \n\n\nSpeaking of Mango Fuego, they have some semi-inspiring house cocktails. My favorite, if you couldn't already tell, is the Mango Fuego; it is essentially a habanero & mango infused margarita. Just the right amount of spicy-sweet ratio makes this a true winner. At $15 a piece, though, be careful on ordering more than one of these delights. \n\nOur last three experiences have offered spectacular service from the wait staff. Water glasses always full, the table always tidied up, and frequent visits from your main waiter equate to a more pleasant meal and a rising price tag for the tip. \n\nI guess I should get started on the food...it's kind of important, no? \n\n--Mushroom Tart ($16): Made with several different mushrooms and gruy\u00e8re cheese, this is one of my favorite appetizers in all of Vegas. It is rather small, however-- so, I suggest that no more than two people split it. \n\n--Heirloom Tomato Caprese Salad ($18): Let me preface my review for this item with the fact that my family and I are suckers for a good Caprese. This is one of the best we can remember. Although this last time they were out of burrata cheese and used mozzarella, it was still a winner. Ask for more of the balsamic reduction! \n\n--Truffle Mac & Cheese ($12): The last decade has shown Las Vegas' infatuation with serving macaroni & cheese-- a rather simple dish in and of itself-- in every opportunity possible. Botero nails theirs. Extremely rich, but I kept reaching for more to further enhance my main meal.\n\nMAIN DISHES\n\n--Kobe Short Rib ($40): If you're looking for something richer than Bill Gates himself, then this dish will be sure to satisfy your palette. Served with potato puree, it can be too much for a single guest. That didn't stop my sister's boyfriend from devouring the whole thing in 2.5 seconds, though. I had a bite and it was scrumptious, per the usual.\n\n--Black Bass: I'm typically not a fish fan, but I will order it every once in a while. My mom loves fish and ordered this dish, just to give it a trial. (Oh, count me in on rhyming during this review, too).  It had thin circles of shaved potato crusted on (view my picture I uploaded). It also came garnished with a few mini pieces of pork belly. Now, I had never tried this as anything with the name \"belly\" should never be consumed at a restaurant like this. Buuuut, wait. This was like intense bacon. I wanted more as I am kind of a bacon fanatic. I'll stop rambling about my bacon obsession for now.\n\n--Brioche Crusted Rack of Colorado Lamb ($49): This has forever cemented itself in my mind as the best lamb I could possibly have. I typically don't order lamb, as I think it's sad (just imagine their 'baaaaaahhhhh'ing in the back of your mind)...but this was downright phenomenal. I'll definitely be back even if I just get this dish. \nIt came garnished with a house made fettuccine tossed with some lamb shoulder and caramelized carrots (big plus, this was amazing). \n\n--Strawberry Shortcake: My family loved this. I wasn't a fan, and I could eat strawberries and cream every day of my life. I just didn't like the actual shortbread, perhaps. \n\nOh, Botero. You're quickly climbing the ranks as my favorite Vegas restaurant. You may just eclipse my beloved SW Steakhouse next time around!"

We ordered an appetizer called \"a tasting of crab\", the actual crab was good, but the macaroni was turffled and was too too rich for my taste, and it seemed to have \"too much\" going on in one plate (like in top chef\". I ordered a Bone-In ribeye medium rare, when it came out it was wayyyy too rare (less than 1 mm from the outside of the steak turned blood red), when I asked them to cook it for a little longer it took them 15 minutes for them to bring it back to me. We also had a friend that ordered a petite filet, it had a side of keish which when we looked at it had a bug larger than a lady bug on it (I dont know what kind of bug it was), the wawitress took it away and proceeded to get the manager, he toldd her \"there was some lettuce there that wasn't washed properly\", I smell BS. He then told her that they would correct the ordeal yet when we received the bill, they ONLY took off 50% of her portion of the bill which her part of the bill then came out to $58 (an average amount a person pays here is between $80-110 per person if you purchase an appetizer, salad, and main course). EVERY OTHER restaurante I have ever been too that made a mistake has given us a better deal than this and this is supposedly an \"upscale\" establishment. I have never given a 1 star here on Yelp so this is the first. BTW, their Japanese Kobe costs $175 for the main course only FYI."

What distinguished Botero for us (in the context of a steakhouse) was that the side dishes, wine, and dessert were also top notch.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice -- we could converse and enjoy looking at the art or the mosaic floor.  Service was attentive and their attention to detail on allergy awareness is amazing.  I'm removing a star for the price.  We are up into very high end dining price range and that's a bit extreme for a steakhouse."

            "review": "Ah, Vegas. The life of excess. And, holy shit, did Encore do it right. Everything about this casino is amazing, from the smell pumped in through the vents, even to the cocktail napkins - which are by far the best cocktail napkins I've ever seen at a casino. That's why it's so fitting that their steakhouse is named after Botero, an artist whose signature is very, very rotund people in his paintings and sculptures.\n\nYes - I gave the shrimp cocktail place in Vegas five stars, I even gave the OC Fair five stars. So why only four at Botero? Well, because I also gave five stars to Del Frisco's in Vegas, and the steak and experience here just didn't match it.\n\nI must say though, the decor of the restaurant is pretty damn cool though. With all the tables set up around one of Botero's largest sculptures or one of the largest ladies. We ended up seated right next to her ass, which made me feel better about myself with every bite of my calorie overloaded steak. Even the silverware is custom made to have that plump, Botero-esque feel.\n\nNow, let's get down to the food and drinks. I had the ribeye with chimichurri on it, which was...pretty good. But you know what, I really should have gone without the chimichurri it didn't add anything good to the steak. What was absolutely delicious though was the mac n' cheese. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this was the absolute best mac n' cheese I've ever had in my life. I doubt this is the sort of establishment where you could just go in and order the mac n' cheese, but if you could....this would be on my list of stops in Vegas every time.\n\nThe desserts all seemed to focus on presentation more than taste. But it's actually kind of fun eating a bon bon lollipop after a schmancy dinner. (Just don't remind yourself that you paid $22 for a few bon bons.)\n\nWorth the $300 pricetag for a dinner for two? Sure, you're in Vegas. You're damn right it's worth it.\n\nThumbs Up:\n-Fab art from Botero as far as the eye can see.\n-Your self esteem will skyrocket if you're seated next to the fat lady sculpture.\n-Mac N' Cheese. Holy mother of god. Amazing.\n-Of course, amazing service. You're at a Wynn property. Duh.\n\nThumbs Down:\n-You know, it's really not bad, just as far as Vegas steakhouses go - it's not as good as Del Frisco's."

Sure the dishes looked stunning and totally appetizing, but as all things in Vegas, looks can be deceiving. It was probably the worst steak dining experience I'd had in awhile. The crudo sampler was not fresh, and instead had an unpleasant fishiness. The creamed spinach was overpoweringly creamy. The scallops and prime ribeye tasted like something that was cooked at home by amateurs. It was the first time I took two bites of a huge steak and left the rest for the dogs. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is the impeccable service. This experience could have been so much worse if it wasn't for the helpful and apologetic staff. Professionalism definitely goes a long way, and I am very appreciative.\n\nWith that said, I hope that Botero will step up their game.

Not one for the entire restaurant but section.\n\nokay now to the food.....................\n\nordered the seafood tower for 70 bucks:\n\nCame with 1 lobster tail, 3 shrimps, 2 crab legs, I believe there was 4 oysters, 2 mussels and 2 clams. The oysters so yummy......well everything on there was yummy but i dont know if I would order again for that price.\n\nordered the 20 ounze bone ribeye.... so good and flavorful\n\nSides were 12 bucks each and we ordered the salad- eh its salad to go with the meal nothing great. We ordered the cream spinach which is really good and went along with our mashed potatoes.\n\nI wanted to try the desserts but honestly with this meal and two glasses of wine I didn't have any room left. \n\nWe just ordered too much for two people. \n\nI would definetely be back but wouldn't order so much. \n\nIf its just two of you I highly recommend to share the steak and maybe 2 sides to go with that but that night our eyes were bigger than our stomachs."

I wished they had a wider selection on their menu, and I wished they had smaller options for entrees.   Their smallest piece of meat was 8oz - 10oz.  Most fine establishments offer 6oz, which is perfect for a petite person.\n\nThe ambiance is quite nice, they have a giant size buddha in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nI would rather try one of many other million restaurant choices in Vegas then to return back here."

            "review": "For a restaurant that supposedly caters to those interested in fine-dining, my family and I were quite disappointed at our dining experience here. We made reservations for dinner at 8:30pm, arrived 10 minutes early, and still found ourselves having to wait almost 40 minutes to be seated (and 10 more minutes once we sat down). The decorations and feel of the restaurant are quite impressive...it is unfortunate the food and service are not up to par. We spent almost 400$ between five of us, and the experience was no better than eating at a nice restaurant for less than 100$. I ordered the Australian grass-fed New York Steak, medium I may add...and it was totally overcooked. Though the center was still pink, the outside was almost even a little burnt. The quality of the meat also was not impressive. I have had 25$ steaks before that were much much better than this one. We also had the octopus plate, which was okay, as well as one of their soups. My sisters had vegetarian options (these were the highlight from what we ordered). For sides, I had one of their potato dishes, which was average, and the grilled broccolini. This broccolini was absolutely amazing and if you do go here you need to get it. In addition, we ordered a ~120$ bottle of wine, which we have bought before for ~20$. To note we saw a bottle of Catena reserve 2010 on the wine list that cost ~310 that we have previously also bought for much less (~25-30$). Not only was everything grossly overpriced, but you'd expect for the money you're paying you'd get fantastic service. Unfortunately this was also not the case. The service was quite slow. Overall, definitely not a place I would ever recommend to anyone, unless $$ and time are not an issue. Maybe if we had been charged 80$ total it may have been worth it."

            "review": "My husband and I chose Botero after reviewing other restaurants in the Wynn/Encore complex. We were staying at Encore and seeing Garth Brooks at the Wynn, so we wanted to stay close while eating. I chose Botero because of the menu and also the description of the atmosphere as lounge-like, something a bit different than other restaurants.\n\nI definitely chose well! We had eaten an early lunch at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill (another great eat) and wondered how Botero could compete at dinner. Botero not only competed but is a place we would eat again for fine dining. The atmosphere wasn't exactly lounge-like to me, but definitely hip with the tables arranged in radiating circles around a large statue, and the weather was too cool to have any outside experience.\n\nBut to the food - oh, the food! I had the Crudo Tasting appetizer and it was very light with amazing taste. A great way to start the meal so that you don't fill up too quickly. My husband had the Caesar wedge and he enjoyed that. He chose to stick with the meat options and ordered the Kobe short rib - it was melt in your mouth deliciousness. I ordered the Duet of Pacific Fish and really enjoyed the salmon. I was getting so full that I couldn't even get into the artic char. We had asked our waiter what the better sides were, since they all sounded divine. When he said the tater tots were very popular we were surprised, but compelled to try them after he described them. Wonderful, with a nice surprise of a cheese bit inside. Our other side was the lightly battered asparagus with a great dipping sauce. Neither of these are on the online menu, so they must change up the sides. I'm guessing that any one you chose would be fine.\n\nAnd now to the dessert. In the reviews I had read before our trip it was emphasized that you must try the S'mores Brioche Doughnuts. We did and were not disappointed. Four battered and lightly fried marshmallows rolled in crushed graham crackers. Served with a warm chocolate ganache and a cool vanilla creme. Oh my! What a wonderful ending to a wonderful meal.\n\nThe service was good. We had two different waiters taking care of us and even the staff that comes around to fill glasses were friendly and readily agreed to take our picture. This is an atmosphere that could go towards the romantic or to a larger group of fun. We saw both there. The couple next to us was celebrating their anniversary and were brought a plate with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate and some sort of dessert \"popsicles\" (not ice cream) on the side.\n\nI don't believe you would be disappointed if you eat here. Enjoy!"

They were both good.\n\nThe best parts were the truffle mac and cheese we shared.  I could have ate 5 plates of that alone!  We also shared the donut s'mores and they were amazing!  I wish I had more room because the whole dessert menu looked delicious. \n\nService was nice and pretty, modern decor."

            "review": "Botero I hate to see you go! I am so sad that I won't be able to eat here more than once! I had an amazing experience this past week! I decided to book this place because I heard they were closing! Upon arriving we were warmly greeted by the two hostess at the front. Seated promptly which is always a plus for me at fine dining restaurants! The ambiance is beyond amazing inside this place and the mood isn't the typical stiff fine dining atmosphere you would normally expect. We were placed in a great area of the restaurant by the pool. Very romantic type of feel. Our waiter was excellent! Very informative and knowledgeable about the menu! The only reason I can't quite give them a full five stars is because the food took FOREVER to come out and when it came down to getting our bill that took another 15 minutes. We explained prior to all this that we had a show to catch. However I have to mention how great the steak's were. The Bone-In Ribeye is the absolute best steak they have! Thanks for the great experience BOTERO."

I did have a couple of tears rolling down my cheeks...(blush)... But the food cheered my up right away!!! I had the filet mignon (4.5 stars) and my sweetheart had the Kobe ribs ( 6.5 stars on a five star scale!!!) Wild mushrooms on the side and easily the most delicious glass of Pinot noir I have ever had... Swanky quiet and just so beautiful...worth every penny!"

We had no idea what was coming next...which made it so fun! We started off with a crispy shrimp ball, followed by ahi tuna. Next was the Kobe beef ravioli, which was out of this world! We ended with NY strip steak served with truffle Mac & Cheese and broccoli served on cute skillets. It was the best Mac and cheese I have ever had! Of course we ended with some dosants (aka cronuts), and a variety of rich desserts. I can not thank you enough for the amazing service and food. Thank you, Joe, for the excellent service!"

            "review": "This restaurant was a disappointment. They don't allow shorts in the dining room and they make you sit in the patio area outside if you wear shorts. It's also 114 degrees today. I asked to speak to restaurant manager and hotel manager and was told that there's nothing they can do. It's a pretentious restaurant that doesn't care about accommodating its customers. To me it simply doesn't deserve your money."
