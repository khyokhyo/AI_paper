            "review": "When we saw this so close to our hotel we got very excited and couldn't wait to try it.  We were hoping for a memorable meal and some yummy tequila.  The place was mobbed when we arrived for lunch but we were able to sit at a high top inside right away.  We asked the waitress for some recommendations on which tequila to try first and (of course) she suggested the Cabo Wabo.  OK, we both got margeritas. \n\nI inquired about gluten free and she brought me a gluten free menu which, to my surprise, was rather small considering a lot of mexican food is gluten free.  I ended up ordering the Shrimp Fajitas.  FAJITAS....as in comes with soft corn tortillas?  NOPE.  My meal came and no tortillas.  I asked and the waitress told that they had gluten in them.  Uh, ok.....shouldn't the menu state they DON'T come with them?  I mean, fajitas are fajitas.  \n\nNext order of business was to get some silverware so we could actually eat our meals.  We asked and then waited, and waited and waited.  I finally got up and took silverware off an empty table.  Hubby asked for some hot sauce, which was never delivered either.  Service sucked, flat out.  Our waitress acted as if we were an annoyance to her.  The food was mediocre at best and EXTREMELY overpriced.  I'm sorry Sammy.....I really had high hopes for this place but we will not be back."

Prepared to be full when you leave here because between the drinks, the chips and the food with large portions, you will not leave here feeling light. \n\nIt is a fun atmosphere, touristy, but still fun. I love the coconut margarita! They come around and take your photo while you eat (the touristy part I was talking about) and then you can choose to purchase it, or just take the free post card photo. \n\nI have been here 3 times over the past few years and always have had good service. My friends and I split the veggie fajitas. We split the portion for one, but with chips and guac we were still stuffed. \n\nMake sure you have some margaritas, they are yummy!"

We walked around 10- almost 11pm & one of our friends pointed this place out. I asked if we can keep walking to find a better place but we were too famished we just had to stop. Very depressing it had to be this place. If you're hungry & walk by, keep going. There are better places to eat and drink in this desert. Drinks were decent, service was terrible, food was worse. We all took a few bites & left the food at the table. For the price you pay, this place needs to be ashamed. Don't even think about it, just skip this dump!!!"

My gripe is a hidden \"CNF\" charge you find on your bill. This is a \"franchise fee\" equal to 3-4% of your total bill. I think it's totally wrong to charge this after the fact. Then just add that amount to each menu item. Just seems shady if you ask me. \n\nSteak fajitas 5 stars\nJack and coke ribs 1.5 stars\n\nPS another in our group nearly choked to death (yes really) on a chicken bone that was close in size to a tooth pick. This was in a dish that was comprised of some type of pulled chicken. The waitress witnessed him choking.  The manager came out and tried to compensate him for the life threatening incident with a shot of booze from the bar!!?!?"

At least at Cabo Wabo, you can sit outside and people watch while you eat and drink.  The tacos are fairly good and the drinks don't have to be sweet if you ask for them to be that way.  Service was pretty good and I'll definitely be back."

But that's where the good ends. \n\nWe were not actually sat by the hostess just pointed toward the tables. No menus, so I'm assuming the frat boy waiter assumed we didn't want service. When I asked for menus he looked at me like I was nuts. Then 5 seconds after getting the menus he asked us, \"so are you gonna order something?\" Really?\n\nHe never asked us if wanted drinks, I went up to the Bar to get mine. For a weak 8 oz margarita it was TWENTY DOLLARS!!!! For a pre-made Slurpee with house alcohol!!   \n\nI would never go back there again. They treated us like trash and we did nothing to deserve it. \n\nAnd to top it off I accidentally left an expensive souvenir behind, when I returned they didn't have a lost n found they said \"we just throw it away\". I tried to express the whole experience to the manager, his response was \"oh well\". \n\nWOW - worst service EVER!"

            "review": "We went on a Monday night late so it wasn't too busy.  We were seated right way in the balcony area.  Restaurant is located outside of the Planet Hollywood Hotel and the Miracle Mile Shopping area, so it's the perfect spot for people watching and the views of the nearby hotels were great.  Our server had a few tables going, but made it a point to greet us right way to get in our drink orders (most important).  We didn't have to wait too long for your entr\u00e9e to arrive, all piping hot!  I had a chicken burrito, enchilada style and the others have the fish tacos, 3 huge tacos!  All very yummy!\n\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE:  Fun atmosphere!  Food is tasty and plenty.  Would've liked to hear more of Sammy Haggar's music playing.  Priced moderately.\n\nWhen in Cabo, Mexico, check out the restaurant there.  Good food, authentic.  The d\u00e9cor is awesome.  There is a hugh wrestling ring right in the center of the restaurant for Saturday nights Nacho Libre matches!  Now how cool is that!"

We could tell it was super busy inside and we expected to wait a little bit, but once we came up to the hostess they sat us RIGHT AWAY! Not even 5 mins later our waitress came up and took our drink orders and had them out right away. The same waitress came back and took our food order and I was just so impressed on her professionalism and how great the food tasted. I felt like the food was reasonably priced. For just my girlfriend and I the bill came out to $30, but that included a huge breakfast and Bloody Mary's with fruit bowls. I am definitely coming back here for girls night out!"

Finally one of them said \"You wanna eat?\".  No, we randomly walk up to hostess stations all over the city without the intention of eating there.  I was ready to go but my friend had a groupon so he wanted to try it. \n\nWe were then sent to the outside hostess station to be ignored by *4* more employees.  Seriously - how many employees do you need to stand around chatting with each other??  One girl even had her leg sprawled across the narrow entranceway to the outside seating.  The hostess went to seat us but didn't tell her to move her leg so she continued to chitchat and block the entrance while we waited.  I don't know who manages this place but he/she needs to get on the ball.\n\nAfter being seated we were greated by our waiter (something Kennedy?) who was very nice but seemed to want to rush us.  \n\nThe drinks were served in plastic cups but I have to admit my drink was good (their version of a Long Island Iced Tea).  The prices are not that great (which we expected on the strip) and the food sucked.  It looked like it was going to be tasty but couldn't have been more bland.  There were no condiments offered and there was NOTHING on the table, even salt.\n\nI would never go here again.  Its typical drunk-touron crap.  Bad food, bad employees, bad pricing."

We ate outside on the patio. The water show at the Bellagio was going on through out our dining experience so that was pretty amazing! The Margaritas were pretty good. We love rock and roll music so had a great time of enjoying the moment. The service was pretty good, could have been a little better, but realistically, on a Saturday night in Vegas when the house seems to be rocking, we have eaten at much worse places! One thing we liked is that our waiter asked if it was our first time dining here. Because we said yes, he went over menu and we listened to his recommendations. The guacamole and Sampler were awesome. \nWhen we left, the managers and hostesses said good bye(that is rare these days!).\nWe will be back next month, or next big boys night out!!!!!"

Then we waited for 1 hour and 15 minutes for our food!!  They food runners twice tried to deliver other tables' food to us.  Then the server and the manager came over to apologize.  The manager claimed the food was being made hot and would be \"out in just a minute.\"  The manager also offered us free Cabo Wabo margaritas even though we still had over half of our original yard margaritas. We accepted the free drinks but waited another 25 minutes. The margaritas were disgusting and undrinkable.  I love margaritas, but these were terrible. Then the manager came to the table with the wrong food order.  When we informed him this was the wrong order, he looked flustered and darted away without saying a word.  10 minutes later we got our correct food order.  No apology from the manager and no discounts other than the terrible margaritas.   Other than the female bartenders dancing on the bar, this was a very forgettable dining experience.  Never again."

A nice place to go if you want to grab some drinks and a bite without paying an exorbitant amount.\n\nWe dropped by here the first night of our Vegas trip to grab some drinks. We were mainly here to try their drinks but I was hungry so I also ordered some guacamole. The guac was really good and came with in a decent portion. It cost around $9 and there was enough to share with the group.\n\nWe only ordered one drink here, the cocorita, and it was delicious! The drink itself was pretty good, but the honey coated coconut crusted onto the rim of the glass was the best part. It was so good, the drink is definitely worth getting just for that coconut crust.\n\nWe also tried some of the drinks and snacks that the rest of our table ordered. The Salsa was a good price for a pretty generous portion. It had a little bit of a Chipotle flavor in it which I wasn't that into. The rest of the drinks were all just ok, I don't think I tried enough of them to know if I liked or disliked them."

We really enjoyed our time with him.  \n\nWe each ordered a chicken and a beef taco.  The flavor of the tacos was good and it was great to see a place claiming to serve Mexican food ACTUALLY USE MEXICAN CHEESE!   But $13 for two tacos was a little steep, regardless of how good they are.\n\nOverall, my experience seems to be better than some on here...but YES it is a tourist trap.  And if I could offer a suggestion - when in Vegas - try your hardest to avoid female servers/waitresses/bartenders.  They are all so sick of drunk tourist and/or businessmen hitting on them non-stop that they all have a chip on their shoulder.  Avoid them."

They have two separate host stations, one for outside seating and one for inside seating. The patio was going to take about a half hour wait so we decided to dine indoors. The had us wait for a few minutes to get our table set up. Once we were sat, we were greeted by a very friendly server, I believe her name was Sarah. Sarah was helpful, patient, and kind. She offered us suggestions and was very attentive. Sarah is exceptional.\n\nOne of Sarah's suggestions for a beverage was the MARGARITA VERDE [Cabo Wabo tequila, lime, freshly minced cucumber & cilantro, served on the rocks]. We ordered a pitcher $44 which serves about four full glasses; delicious and refreshing! For my dinner, I decided on the GRILLED PORTABELLA MUSHROOM FAJITAS [fajitas vegetable, guacamole, pico do gallo, sour cream & flour tortillas] $25.95 (for one); I had it served over melted cheeses skillet add $3.00 and a side of rice. The food was flavorful and well presented. My only negative critique is, not enough tortillas; you only receive three but an additional two would be better but that's a personal preference.\n\nThe music was really loud. it was hard to converse with my family or listen to Sarah, our server. Over all, my experience was exceptional and I definitely recommend dining at Cabo Wabo the next time you're in Las Vegas!"

It was much better than we expected being a chain and after reading all of the negative reviews. It really exceeded our expectations. \n\nWe started with the house margarita and they were delicious and strong. Probably better than any margarita I've had. I went with the shrimp tacos and they were really good, they also came with rice and beans. The whole meal was really filling. The pork tacos are also worth a mention if swine is your thing. If you're gonna try one thing, try the chimichangas. They were on the 'specials' menu that day and had beef and queso cheese, I'm craving these right now! \n\nThe service left a little to be desired and I wish that chips and salsa were complimentary (they are $3). \n\nAll in all I would definitely check this place out if you love tequila, Mexican, or Sammy Haggar. You also have a great view of the Bellagio fountains if you sit on the patio."

Went to the side of the restaurant that's actually in the Miracle Miles shop and there were two girls taking drinks order. We requested the drinks in the guitar, but couldn't decide on the flavor. She gave us samples of the ones we wanted to try. Finally we decided on the drink that tastes like mango..I forgot what it's called. She puts it in a guitar and turns the guitar on which was pretty cool. The drink was $50. Now I'm not much of a drinker so I don't know if 100 oz of alcohol is worth that price...is it?

Anywhere else and this would be a taco plate appetizer.  Grabbed some shots of tequila that were $11 dollars as well.

Ok,...$9 bucks for a beer is high, however it's the Vegas Strip so that was expected.  \n\nWhat wasn't expected was when we got the bill, he was charged $18.00 for his $9.00 beer.  We asked about it and the waiter told us the beer is $9.00 and the \"commemorative\" Cabo Wabo glass was an additional $9.00.  WTF!  $18.00 bucks for a 22oz beer?  Needless to say the $9.00 surcharge was reflected in the waiters tip, since he didn't warn us about that.\n\nBuyer Beware!  This is a scam and a rip-off!  Also, you're stuck with an unwanted glass that you have to carry around with your when you're walking the Strip."

Has a chance....Based on my recent visit I would have tell anyone thinking of trying this place to think twice and try something else.  There are a lot of choices when it comes to eating and drinking on the strip.  The fact that Sammy Hagar has his name attached to this place will put people in the seats, but I won't be back.\n\nService was poor.  Our server was much more interested in the water gun fight going on with his co-workers than he was in any of the tables.  It's Vegas you should have a good time, but the patrons should have a better time.  Everyone that was seated around us was also frustrated.\n\nThe food was a little bit below average.  For the money I was not impressed.  We had ordered some nachos, chicken enchiladas, and a Jack and Coke burger. \n\nThe real tragedy here were the drinks.  Until the day that I ate here I had never not finished a drink.  It was so sweet that it might have actually ruined my meal.  For $10 dollars or more this was the worst margarita that I have ever had, and I have had hundreds in my life.  Nobody at the table was able to finish their margaritas, and we all had a different flavor.  I said something to our server and he said \"I don't know what to tell you.\"  Something tells me they get that all of the time.\n\nIf I remember right there is a Fat Tuesdays down the hall inside of Planet Hollywood.  Stop there and enjoy the buzz."

I think they forgot that I asked for double rice. I'm kind of glad they did because the rice was dry and unflavorful. I literally had to drown it in salt and pepper. The tacos were good. They were the beef ones without any dairy, added avocado and cilantro. \n\nWe got the bill and we were charged some odd fee.

Some friends ordered steak Fajitas for 2 and they raved about how delicious the steak is. However they all got charged extra for rice and beans which they received but didn't order. But was later removed after we brought it up to the manager. When paying our $300 bill, I asked about an odd additional \"tax\" they charged which was close to $13.

It was one of those icy, mixed cocktails from the slurpee-looking machines in the front of the establishment. And let me tell you, it was far from terrible. In fact, if the alcohol didn't pack such a punch, I might have ordered two. The drink is a mixture of raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry flavoring. It was light, fruity, and very refreshing on a Vegas summer night. \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the Chicken Enchilada Combo, which includes rice and beans. And if you just look at the picture I've supplied, you can already tell that it was amazing. I loved the verde sauce on top of the enchiladas themselves. The chicken was succulent and full of flavor. The rice had a good amount of spice and the beans were fresh. The cheese was also yummy; thoroughly melted and mixed. \n\nWe also had several servings of chips and salsa before our meal. The fact that we kept asking for another heaping has more to do with the fact that the chips and salsa were both crisp and fresh, rather than because we were starving. \n\nFinally, the food is heavy. In other words, be prepared to pack a to-go box. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my experience at Cabo Wabo. And I look forward to my next visit.\n\nHappy feasting!"

He gives it a 7/10. We both left satisfied. The price is what it is...you're on the strip. Service was great on the patio. We will continue to return. \nAlso, live music on a Tuesday night at 8:30 just as we were finishing. He was entertaining."

It was very crowded, but not just with people, the tables are way too close together it is a very unpleasent atmosphere.  It was also way too loud in there, you had to shout to be heard by the people you were sitting with.  It was dinner time, not night club time, there was just no reason to have to music so loud at that time of day.   Atmosphere aside, the food was just down right bad.  I had the fish and chips and spent the rest of the evening trying not to vomit as I walked the strip.  It actually made me queezie. \nLastly, this place is expensive, a beer....one 12 ounce bottle of beer was $8.00.  Eight dollars for 1 bottle of Coors Light!   There are many places to eat on the Vegas Strip, I for one will never go back to this place."

One of the barbacks, Chris(?), was phenomenal. He took care of us from start to finish. \n\nThe signature margarita was good, but the coconut one was the best. It is similar to a daiquiri. \n\nThe food teetered on okay to good. The bacon wrapped shrimp was delicious, but it is hard not to love goat cheese stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon and then fried. The rice needs a little work. Not much flavor there. The tuna ceviche is closer to a tartar. It borderlines on the sweet side. The spicy shrimp with garlic chips was one of the better dishes. It had a balance of flavors and not just overtly spice levels.\n\nJason, the GM, came by to talk to us and was very friendly. It is refreshing to see management touch the tables and actually care about the guest's experience. Adam, another manager came around to introduce himself as well. It was a fun service experience. I would like to come back when I have more free time to check out their tequila selection."

I ordered the fish & chip (16.95) & my companion ordered the chicken enchiladas (15.95).  The waiter asked if we want sour cream, & we said yes. The food was pretty good, but when the check came, they charged us $1 for the sour cream (you'd think it's free because it's a little dish of sour cream). On top of that, they charged a fee of CNF (2.15) which he explained it's a franchise fee. I've never heard of such a fee. So do you pay for a franchise fee at McDonald ? I don't think so. Also I understand they were busy, (but really not that busy; it's a Tuesday night) the service was really slow. Although it's not much money, I think the restaurant is really cheap to charge for sour cream & the CNF fees is ridiculous. Anyone here can explain what this CNF is???"

We saw cabo wabo, though margaritas would be good, and stopped.\n\nThis is a good place for what it is - chain restaurant type of Mexican food.  But the location is superb.  We sat on the patio at the railing and had a great view of Bellagio, Caesar's up the block, and the people walking along the strip.  So it's a great place for just that - relaxing on the strip in the sun to people watch.\n\nThey also have skinny margaritas, and good ones too.  We're both a bit health conscious (though you couldn't tell by the giant nachos we ordered), and try to avoid drowning drinks in sour mix.  It wasn't too pricey for Vegas - $10/margarita, $15 for the nachos - so we got yards of skinny ritas and nachos and had a really nice afternoon.  \n\nI wouldn't come here for a nice dinner or anything, but if you want a patio on the strip, this is a good place to come."

Well, Cabo Wabo does it! \n\nI ordered the fish tacos...but they were out of them!  So then I ordered the shrimp tacos....and again they were out of them!  But somehow they had the shrimp quesadillas, so that's what I went with.  What I got were these WET triangle things, that had no shrimp and basically just alot of wet cheese.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't eat it....and I eat anything Tex Mex.  \n\nIF you come to Cabo Wabo (and I would really think hard about it) my advice is to just sit at the bar and have a couple margaritas.  Thankfully they don't screw that up.  Don't eat here though.  Eat your Mexican at Dos Caminos at Palazzo or Pink Taco at Hard Rock."

The beef was tender and very flavorful. It's more like a tex mex I'd say. How people rate it so poorly I don't know. Service was awesome. Make sure to try the salsa. It's out of the world good.

Horrible. \n\nLet's start from the beginning. Our party of four was crammed at a tiny table with tons of foot traffic. Some girl came over to take our order... not sure who she was, as she made it a point to tell us she was NOT our server but was going to be taking our order. Clearly she wasn't happy at being told to help out our actual server, as she was rude, surly, uninterested and completely unhelpful. \n\nWhen ordering, I said to her, \"How are the short rib enchiladas?\" I got a blank stare and she replied, \"they're good\" in such a way that I began to question my order and said, \"I'm not hearing any enthusiasm... should I order something else?\" She robotically replied with a sigh and said that she's never had them, but they are popular there. Um ok. \n\nThen, my friend who is a vegetarian, was told by the people at the front that almost everything on the menu could be modified into a vegetarian dish. (I mean, it's really not that difficult. Take any freaking dish and omit the meat and voila!) Rude girl taking our order: \"WHO told you that?!!\" and rolled her eyes and put her hands defiantly on her hips. Then she added, \"The ONLY vegetarian options are a cheese quesadilla or a salad!\" After being told what was said at the front, my friend asked if she could order cheese enchiladas with avocado and was told \"Oh, I guess you could do that.\" When our food came, no cheese enchiladas... but instead, a cheese quesadilla. ((SIGH)). The food runner was just as rude. My friend made the comment that it wasn't what she ordered but she'd eat it anyway. The runner insisted on getting the enchiladas as she barked, \"BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY!\" Lol.\n\nAnd during the long period of time we were waiting for our food, I flagged down a server and asked for some chips and salsa. And as if this place didn't suck already, I was told they CHARGE for chips and salsa! What?!! Come again?? Never, ever in my life have I been to a Mexican restaurant (and I've been in a LOT in my time) and been charged for chips and salsa. I mean, I know we are in the price gouging capital of the world, Las Vegas, where dumb tourists will fork out any kind of money not knowing any better, but it will be a cold day in hell before I pay $5 bucks for chips and salsa. One week later, I'm still shaking my head as I write this.\n\nOther than that, we never saw our server again... never checked on us, refilled water, nothing. The food was unremarkable. Average, at best. The mango picante margarita was pretty decent... took forever to arrive but tasted good. I was about 85% thru my meal when someone over my shoulder tried to take my plate away (wtf). And then for the remainder of our meal, there was a staff member table stalking us to fill our table the second we stood up, which was uncomfortable and we felt rushed (even though the service on their end was slow). \n\nSummary: Disappointed."

I had a pint of Dos Equis Lager. We ordered the chicken strips and fries. Within 15 mins, i had a terrible stomach ache and ran to the bathroom to puke. It could have been something in the food or alcohol. But its one incident and it could have happened to anyone.\n\nWhy the 2 stars? I asked for another beer and it never came...but it was noted on our final bill. The half-yard came out to be $36!! when you order the same drink at the walk-through counter inside the mall, its only $17!! I tried arguing with the server but was so sick and nauseous that i couldnt. She did remove the extra beer charge and the bill was still $60!! \n\ni would not come back to this place to eat or drink.

One of my friends and I went to Vegas right before Thanksgiving. We took some cameras and a video camera with us to shoot during our trip. \n\n\"The meat had marks on it from where the Jockey was hitting it\" (Rodney Dangerfield Quote from Caddyshack). \n\nWe stopped at Cabo Wabo because I'd been to the one in Cabo and this one has a nice patio overlooking the strip. We thought we could get some drinks, watch the people, and roll our camera a bit overlooking the strip. We sat on the Patio of this horrible restaurant for 15 minutes while 3-4 waiters walked by without even acknowledging us. \n\nFirst person to visit us was the manager dressed in a hoodie and jeans with a radio earpiece in his ear like he was protecting the president or something. Really, this guy is in charge? He came over before asking us if we wanted a drink, welcome/greeting, etc. and started asking us questions about our cameras and scolding us that we cannot use them on the property. Only still pictures. I explained to him that we were there to spend money buy drinks and eat dinner and he was still very rude. I also told him that we had been there for 15 minutes without a greeting while his waitstaff walked by and that we were planning on eating there. He asked us more questions about our cameras then gave us a lecture about 9/11 and that one of the buildings on the strip next to them was threatened in 2001. In a city where most of the population are tourists with cell phones that have cameras and also carry leisure cameras he then accused us of \"Potentially Being Terrorists because we had cameras and were filming the site on the strip\". I explained to him that we were Americans from Texas. His reply was \"And Timothy Mcveigh was also an American\". This manager is beyond Douche-Bag at this point. We took still pics and we also used a camera that looked like a still pic camera and we still recorded video. He couldn't tell the difference even though he sat back 20 yards from us by the front door and watched us the entire time like we were criminals.  We were told NO video but we could take all of the still pics we wanted. Not sure how that will discourage terrorism. \n\nFinally, our waiter \"Juan\" came by. And let me tell you \"Juan\" was NO SPEEDY GONZALEZ. Turtles and Snails were driving by this guy like the Indy 500 he was so slow. So we order some beers. Juan told us that their carbonation and water was bad and that the beer was flat. And yes, he was right, I had the worst dos equis beer ever and my friends beer was nasty too. Tasted like day old beer. It was warm and flat and tasted like two day old beer fermenting in a glass on a table and it was very flat, no bubbles. Worst beer I've had since I was in high school. Next I ordered a margarita and I tried to get a top shelf that was frozen. Juan explained to me that \"You don't drink frozen margaritas with top shelf liquor\". Really, I'm from Texas Biotch and if I want Herradura or something better in my margarita, I'll order it. I'm the customer. \"Have you ever heard of a TOP SHELF Margarita Biotch?\"\n\nBesides I'm from Texas I drink Margaritas daily and I live in a place where we know our margaritas. I'll have to say, the margarita (that was not top shelf and just well liquor) was pretty crappy for a Mexican restaurant. I've had better margaritas in Wisconsin and Minnesota and those people don't know what the hell a margarita is. So we ordered some food . \n\n\"the meat had marks on it from where the Jockey was hitting it\" (Rodney Dangerfield Quote from Caddyshack). \n\nReally for $17 I could have gotten a better meal at Mcdonalds. The guy I was with ordered Nachos which were just a pile of cheese on chips not much for variety or flavor. They were flat and looked crappy too. Oh yeah, the manager followed my friend to the restroom and sat back about 20 yards from us to watch us the entire time. I guess he felt he was going to prevent a terror attack by stopping our filming of the Las Vegas strip. Typically I tip 20% or more but here I left him a 10% tip and even felt bad. So if you want low quality mexican food, watered down flat beers, and watered down \"well\" margaritas you should check out Cabo Wabo. The only positive about this place is that the view off the patio on the strip is cool and you can see the Bellagio fountains. I hope the health department prevents this factory of food poisoning to continue to serve food and sicken the world and the ultimate sin of messing up a great patio that could be much better if they actually had drinks that tasted good and couldn't mess up \"beer\" from a Keg. A few hours later we both got stomach aches from the food and felt very sick to our stomachs. We now know what happens to the horses at the track that don't make 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. Tip for the day: Don't bet or order horse #5"

I went in there to grab some dinner and have few beers on my way to do a little gambling.. The place overlooks the strip so I thought it would be fun to sit outside and watch the action from the overlook. The bar was only about 60% full so I felt lucky to have beat the dinner rush. What Rush? you ask.. Exactly.... there was no rushing anywhere. The waiter took 20 minutes to acknowledge me. When he finally did I ordered a beer and the Cadillac nachos.. I sat there for another 10 minutes before the guy brought back the beer. He apologized for the wait and said he was just busy, but the truth is the whole bar was not busy and I watched him talking to other people doing whatever... and it was him that was not busy at all.. That by itself would not be enough to piss me off, but I waited another 25 minutes for the nachos and when they arrived they were the most pathetic greasy and poorly executed terribleness I have ever seen.. They were some kind of stuffed tortilla concoction with a dollop of sour cream and some guacamole. A real disappointing dish.. To make it worse I was out of beer. I tried a couple of the nachos but they were so shitty I just decided to cut my losses and leave. I paid the bill, $21.62 by the way for shit nachos and a beer and left.. If it was not bad enough that the food sucked and the service sucked. I had to endure an hour and a half of Sammy Hagar music.. For a Vegas strip venue this place does NOT Rock in any way shape or form. Cabo Wabo is a just skip it and go on to Hard Rock Cafe for me.."

I'm not one of those people who wants to pay $20 for a drink in a souvenir cup (that I'll break or lose) so $5 for a drink sounds much better to me than $20. Of course the $5 drink special was only available for one flavour (mango), but I like mango, and it was a good deal. $5 for a boozey slushie to combat some of that Vegas heat? Yes, please."

If you want to charge more for you food, fine, go ahead and post it on the menu, don't try and hide it with some lame hidden fee.  Cabo Wabo deserves a full boycot for this sleezy tactic.

Cabo Wabo was closest and decided to wait in line for it, myself included since I can partake in a frozen daiquiri from time to time. The bartender tried to sucker my friends into larger drinks than they wanted, and then poured in an extra shot of rum into their drinks without really getting confirmation. The spiel of the extra shot is that you get to spin a magic wheel with prizes on it--hats, free drinks, the like. The catch, which comes after the bartender pours her extra shot is that there is only one spin per group. I'm gonna throw the bullshit flag there. After my friend won a \"Cabo shot\" the bartender said \"the bigger the tip, the bigger the show\" at which point I said point blank to her face, \"so basically it's a pyramid scheme so you guys get more money.\" She looked at my like I was a) right and b) a witch with a \"b.\" \n\nThis whole experience left me incredibly frustrated as a hostess and makes me dislike management and company policy for something so ridiculous."

We sat outside and the place had a really great, lively atmosphere (but I guess you get that everywhere in Vegas). Great place for people watching, not only at the bar, but also the people along the strip. Decent playlist of music too! \n\nWe ordered a pitcher of the house margaritas, which is premade. The waitress informed us it was premade before ordering and tried to convince us to upgrade to the margaritas that were made from scratch. We didn't listen, but we should have. The premade mix lacked tequila and was a little heavy on the sour mix. Our next pitcher, we switched to frozen (also premade) but found this one much, much better. If you don't want to pay the additional $10 for the \"from scratch\" margaritas, definitely get them frozen.\n\nFor food, we shared the queso dip and added chicken to it. This also came with free chips and salsa. The queso was pretty standard, but was disappointed that it wasn't the traditional white queso they serve at most restaurants - kind of looked like it was melted velveeta (which it wasn't). Was disappointed by the lack of chicken that was included in the queso, since we paid additional for it - definitely not worth the upcharge, as we only got a few pieces in it. The chips themselves were great and were warm when served. I personally liked the salsa that came with it, but my friend did not like it at all. It is definitely not a traditional salsa, but am unsure which ingredient made it a little different. \n\nWe also shared the chicken taquitos, which were amazing. They were served immediately after being cooked, so they were nice and warm. The chicken inside was moist and not overcooked, as most meat in taquitos tend to be. The outside was crunchy. It also came with a good helping of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gaillo which was nice to dip into. \n\nOverall, would definitely go back for the atmosphere and frozen margaritas and would be willing to try some different food."

We went here for lunch one Saturday, after finding an hour long wait at our first choice restaurant. Their patio was packed, but they had seating available inside.\n\nIt is located right on the strip between planet hollywood and paris. The location is great since you don't really need to walk inside a casino or actually look for this place. It overlooks the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio.\n\nThe place is well setup in mexican decor. I think it's also a sports bar, so they have plenty of TVs lined along the wall. An bar runs along an entire wall, which is pretty big. They also have an outdoor patio, which is great for people watching, and if you're lucky, you can see the Bellagio fountains as well. Even though we were inside, our table was just by the open patio, so we had plenty of direct light. The service is pretty decent, but not prompt or too friendly.\n\nWe started off with a pitcher of bahama mama, which was excellent. I'd recommend getting this here. We later had a pitcher of the maui rocker, which was too sweet and syrupy. I didn't enjoy that one.\n\nThe food was just meh. We got a queso to share, which we great, but it went downhill from there. We got a burrito, a steak fajita, a chicken sabana, and a cilantro japaleno chicken, none of which are worth a mention. They were fine, but just fine.\n\nThe prices are definitely on the higher side, but the location, decor and ambiance justifies it. Our check was $250 for two pitchers, one appetizer, and four entrees.\n\nI would not really go back here for a meal. However, this would be a great place to get a drink on the patio on a warm evening, and try some appetizers."

One of the best people watching areas in the country!  Combine that with awesome service, solid food and great drinks and you've got yourself a great time!\n\nOur most recent visit was on 10/20/14.  We were pleasantly greeted and opted for a table right on the rail so we could enjoy the sights.  I will say that they now pump in music...and my previous choice of the bar style seating is now less desirable because the music would be a bit loud there (wait, did I just say that?  music is NEVER too loud..but you get what I mean).\n\nOur server, Ashley, was very nice, kept our drinks filled and provided great service....consistent with every single time we've visited Cabo Wabo! 4 or 5 times there and we've always been very well taken care of.\n\nI tried a few different drinks...a cucumber based margarita...a 'sangarita' (their twist on a sangria, it's pinot noir and tequila) which was better than I anticipated but probably wouldn't get it again, and the standard ol' Waborita, which is my ultimate favorite.\n\nThe food is consistently good.  You DO have to pay for chips and salsa (only a couple bucks though) and the salsa is worth it..very tasty.  I used to get the tequila shrimp, but they've removed it from the menu so this time I had the fish tacos (with chipotle crema), while my date had the carne asada tacos (which looked and were delicious..and included avacado!).  It's not 5 star food, but it's way better than normal bar food.\n\nUltimately it's the combination of location, atmosphere, service, drinks and food that makes Cabo Wabo a winner.  Grab a seat on the rail, a Waborita and enjoy the sights and sounds of the Vegas strip!"

She also let us try every drink before we made our decision, AND she color coordinated the straws to match the drink. (nice touch).\n\nWe got the Dreamsicle and the Vida Loca (taste like blue otter pop). Both were delicious. Creepers too. You don't taste any alcohol for a little while, then you feel a little flushed. Great combo! And great drink to have while you're strolling the strip."

Well the hostess said that Cabo Wabo was the perfect place for a family friendly dinner.  I didn't think that was probably the case since the word \"Cantina\" and alcohol mixing machines that flank the front of the restaurant don't exactly spell family friendly....HOWEVER, we were too hungry to care at that minute.  \n\nAmbiance - We sat inside (strictly for the a/c)...we found out real quick that we couldn't hear each other talking since the music was so loud.  I normally don't mind that if I'm with the girls drinking, but I was with my family and it was just annoying.  We ended up having a meal that the conversation consisted of \"what?!\", \"what?!\", \"can't hear you!\", \"never mind, tell you when we leave.\"  We ate in silence after that.  \n\nFood - The food was good.  We got cheese quesidillas that had tons of cheese in them.  Yay for the portobello fajitas!  Always nice for a vegetarian to see these on a tex-mex or mexican food menu.  They were very good.   We also ordered beans and rice which were good and a mojito that was very tasty, but had a few brown mint leaves in it which I took out before drinking.\n\nService - Service was friendly and the food came out quickly.  It slowed down a bit when we were trying to get a box and the bill, but that was since it had become very crowded and our waitress was slammed.\n\nI would have given 3 stars, but since the music inside is so loud to where you can't have a conversation without shouting I gave it a 2 star rating."

We were excited when the bowls arrived with the tortilla shards, avocados and other add-ins in the center of an empty bowl. The soup was in a pitcher which the server poured around the add-ins.  We thought was a fun and unique way to serve it. The soup itself was very thick and brown - which wasn't at all what we expected, but we kept an open mind. It wasn't good. My sister doctored hers with sour cream and was able to eat about 1/2 of it. I had probably ten spoonfuls and couldn't eat any more. Ick.\nThe meat (beef) on the nachos had a weird flavor and was very strong. Neither of us liked it. The cheese was a runny queso-esque  concoction. The serving was generous, but we barely made a dent in them because they were not tasty.  The highlight of our visit was our adorable, friendly and attentive waitress Sarah Ma.  She was fantastic. If you want to get drunk and then eat, you most likely won't care that the food isn't good. If you want to party and drink, then this place would be great."

Our waiter actually bought a round of shots for us and the table of cute girls next to us, telling them it was from us. Food had big portions and was delicious.

There were kids there and they seemed to been well accommodated.\n\nThe food was okay but forgettable. We like Mexican food, but we had a hard time finding menu items that appealed to us. We split a salad and our friend got something else. Our salad had too much dressing but was tasty. We had this problem on the strip at many restaurants. It's hard to find health-conscious food."

This chain has made their name by offering mexican food along with strong margaritas.\n\nThis is good place to do Taco tuesday at or any other day in the week. Due to its location its ncie to just sit down and have a casual meal without any commitment. You can decide to either go here for a whole meal or just a drink before continuing to another waterhole in vegas. \n\nIt can get pretty crowded so if you are a big company, you should probably be early. If you are just a few and feeling lucky, you can always try to sneak in later. In that case i would also suggest you grab one of the bar seats towards the strip. Here you can easily spend an hour or two crowd spotting without even reflecting about it.\n\nThis place is definitely worth a try due to its prime location, and you can either go for a quick drink or an unpretentious meal."

If you've ever done that you probably know that wait staff tend to look at you wierd as they'd rather serve a table of two and get a bigger tip rather than seat a single person in a booth for two.  That said, I felt that a bit at Cabo Wabo, but overall my waitress was very good and considerate of my needs.\n\nNote - unlike most mexican restaurants you may be familiar with, you pay extra here for chips and salsa.  Even if you want salsa to dress your chopped salad you pay $1 for it. I guess that is the nature of eating on the strip though ... almost nothing's cheap. \n\nThat said I ordered a chopped vegetarian southwest salad an it was EXCELLENT.  Seriously one of the best salads I can remember in a long time and I'm a vegetarian so I eat a lot of salads.  I'd gladly eat there again.\n\nMy only regret is I checked into yelp late and missed their check in offer for a free house margarita with an entree.  I ordered an upgraded margarita instead but saved the offer in case I go back.  I'd happily go back and enjoy that salad again.\n\nDon't forget to check in before you order."

I think I was in my bikini with some small cover up and I didnt feel out of place.

We ordered the ceviche and a combo that had a cheese enchilada and I think a beef taco, with rice and beans. \n\nI really did not expect that caliber of mexican food when I walked into this place so I give them their props. \n\nAlso, the location is really great- right off the strip and next to alot of shopping (Sephora is right next door) \n\nAnyway, seems like alot of mixed reviews of this place but my husband and I truly enjoyed their food; maybe it depends on what you order."

We enjoyed people watching, some in their costumes collecting tips for a pic. Some were very creative like Olaf whom looked like a Cholaf, a Mickey Mouse regect, 2 minions and a couple Egyptian guys. \n\nOur server comes by and takes our order. I ordered the carne asada plate and my friend orders the carnitas burritos. While waiting we're snap chatting away and I check in on YELP --- 1 FREE MARGARITA woot woot!\nThen 2 old men get seated next to us - and they were the same old men that wanted to take photos with us when we were at Bellagio. LOL it was funny... we should have gotten a tip for pic.\n\nAny ways, our food arrives and we killed it!! Not cz we were super  hungry cz it was delicious!!! Yummm... the rice, beans and carne asada (3) were just perfect. I've started to appreciate avocados and my carne asada tacos had a slice on each one... made me super happy!\n\nThey had a live band playing behind us (more like a solo band). He was really good. He played his guitar maybe it was a Ukele and he was singing live robin thicke, Bruno mars, flo-rida, etc. He sang his version of the songs added a hint of Hawaiian island beat to it. I loved it! \n\nOur server was ok ((less the one star)) She was nice to my friend and I but rude to the old guys sitting next to us. They would call her and say \"excuse me, excuse me\" she looks at them and keeps walking. RUDE! I felt so bad cz all he wanted was a cup of coffee. - Maybe cz he was smoking in the patio and no smoking was allowed. He probably didn't know, there wasn't a sign or anything. \n\nWell this place is good for entertainment, food was good, vibe was great!"

The second level seems to be a banquet/rental area and this is where our event was held. I had a margarita and while it was decent it was way too sweet and syrup-y for my tastes. A friend ordered a vodka soda and we were both shocked to find out the tiny little 8oz cup w/one shot costs $14!!! I have paid less at a nightclub! That's where the place lost two stars, I understand you're a strip bar but come on! $10 would even be an insult. \n\nI tried a piece of pizza and some taquitos, they were pretty good but I didn't sample the actual menu.

However, when I know that I'm not stepping into one of those real Mexican spots that are peppered throughout the valley, I re-calibrate my expectations. That said, my brain and tastebuds were set for a good American influenced joint, a nice menu with depth in selection and good quality food to match the higher prices- common for the Strip. That's exactly what I got. I always see a lot of people on their patio, so I was excited to try Cabo Wabo Cantina for myself. The goal was to spend $100 because I had a gift certificate. The waitstaff was cordial and accommodating. Our waiter knew the menu very well and had no problem expounding on what was offered. I milled over the selections and finally ordered the sampler as an appetizer which gave us a selection of 4 or 5 items. It was tasty. Next was the main course. The portions were sizable and it was apparent that we wouldn't be able to finish. I barely made a dent in it! This could be partly due to the particularly weak Margaritas that we ordered in the interim. Although the drinks were the biggest disappointment, it was probably my saving grace because I had work the next day. I still would've liked the choice to be risky or not. For dessert, I ordered the brownie and vanilla ice cream to share. It did the trick in size but I did expect more from the brownie. Lastly, I reached and exceeded my initial spending goal and took advantage of the Yelp Check-In for a free margarita. The entrees we're extremely good and made for good leftovers to warm up the next morning! A-OK!"

Last nights visit was a result of a Groupon purchased in November 2014 with a Xmas Eve expiry.  Cabo Wabo may be a hit elsewhere but in Vegas I'd have to say its an epic fail. Located at Planet Hollywood this place is H U GE! \n\nMulti level; huge outside seating area with a great views of the Bellagio Fountains. The restaurant itself occupies the ground floor. There is a stage, lots of tables with limited room to walk around. There is a lift and stairs to take you to the levels above. What is up there I don't know. I suspect a club and/or private rooms. Not exactly sure. What I am sure if is people were constantly on the move, up/down the stairs, causing quite the fuss. \n\nThe music here is loud. Really loud for a restaurant. We were yelling at each other to be heard, as were other diners & staff. The restaurant & outdoor bar weren't busy so I'm not sure why our server Victoria took forever to greet & take our drink order. She was very nice though.  Lots or servers to be seen but none to be found. Food coming from the kitchen was ridiculously slow. \n\nI had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger & my friend had the Cilantro jalape\u00f1o chicken breast. Hers was served with onion rings. Sadly, upon biting into one she immediately pulled a chicken bone from within the ring. Fortunately her temp crown from a root canal wasn't damaged. We still can't figure out how this happened. \n\nI order my burger med-well. Since it took forever for our food to come out I was hopeful the burger was properly cooked bSadly it arrived cooked LESS THAN medium. It was gross. The fries tasted like fish. It took a good 15-20 minutes to get our server. Why I don't know. Numerous servers walked by our table & never stopped to ask if there was a problem. It was obvious there was...both plates pushed away from us, untouched. \n\nEventually Victoria arrived, along with a manager. He was quite gracious. Free margaritas & a redo on our food. Fortunately they both arrived properly done. \n\nDare I mention there were other diners standing on the tables dancing?  Security guards putting on their own dance act, sitting down, hanging out with friends or trying to pick up girls. \n\nThis place is a joke. Ok food not worth the wait or pricing. Irritatingly loud music. TONS of empty tables, inside & out. Bathrooms were disgusting: water & used towels everywhere. Servers galore but of no use. \n\nNot my sort of place. Not what I expect to see or experience when I go to dinner. No wonder they ran a Groupon. This place is awful.  If you're a local like me, there are better places off strip to go. If you're a young, classless, dumb tourist wanting to do nothing but show your ass, spit, & get drunk...then this place is great for you.  FAMILIES STRONGLY DISCOURAGED."

Looking over the menu, I decided to have a Coors Lt. draft from the bar after seeing most beers on draught were $8 and then ordered my hamburger as I wasn't in the mood for what you would normally get at a Mexican restaurant. My daughter and her friend had water to drink and we also ordered queso and chips as an appetizer.\n\nIt was an unusually cool night dining outside, but I knew they had heaters outside and didn't think twice about it. We asked if they could turn on the heaters and wouldn't you know, all the heaters around us came on except the ones directly above us. We were later given an explanation of they were shorted out. Really? Don't know about others, but it made me want to leave as quickly as possible. (Props to our server who did move us to a warmer area, but it was still lacking and the only reason this review is not a one-star review).\n\nWhen my beer did arrive, it came in an unusually large hurricane glass. When the bill did come, my $8 Coors Lt draft was now $18. Our party of 3 w/ 1 alcoholic drink and 2 waters was over $90. Again, I know eating on the strip isn't going to be extra cheap, but damn that's just gouging to be gouging to make $$$.\n\nIt was the last time I will pay to eat there."

Now my Husband is more of a David Lee Roth kind of guy but we decided to check the place out. \nWe sat outside but there were no misters where we sat down at so we decided to move in because we were already too hot. Soo we asked the host if its ok we move inside. She walked us in and put us at our new table... WELL this is where it all started our server was SO bad. He had no personality it was like talking to the wall... We sat there for over 8 minutes before he even came to the table. There was only 3 other tables inside at the time so it's not like they were busy.  This guy didn't even ask us if we wanted refills and let me tell you we can drink some tequila.\n\n We ordered our food which i asked for no pico because it's nasty and i hate it and well of course it had it on there. But i am not the one to complain so i pushed it off to the side and ate what i could. The one drink we had was good and the food was good but the service was not good at all. Right as we r done eating the busser came and cleaned out plates which he was so sweet he should have been our server. \nBefore we are about to leave we are looking around at the table, this place as so much Sammy stuff to look at. A lady came over to the table and asked us how we were doing and if we enjoyed everything now i didn't tell her that our service SUCKED but i did tell her that our food had Pico and etc. She was so nice and tried to get us something else to eat because i barley ate my food. We asked about the upstairs and she took us up there to look around which i might say the view is amazing. She showed us around the rest of the cantina and told us a lot about Sammy that we didn't know. She brought us to the retail store which we had no idea there was on and was not sure if we were going to get anything again my hubby likes David. She gave us her card and said next time we come in to say hi. She made us feel like we were VIP. But every one there was SO nice but this guy with the red hat SUCKS. I can't remember his name i think it was Jason but who know i guess it's not important. Ask for Kristen when you stop by she will make u feel at home there.. So for her, the busser and the ONE good drink we had i will give his place 4 stars"

Went for memorial weekend and while waiting two drunk idiots were causing a scene so one of the waiters was trying to get him out and screamed for them to leave numerous times as they were not leaving. Once the idiots were out he apologized that we had to see that which i totally appreciated. After we got seated he was so nice to bring me and my friend a shot of a yummy drink and again he apologized that we had to witness the idiots being kicked out. Definately made my day and i really appreciated it! Thank you for the amazing service!!"

Well, I finally caved in one day because I was starving for food and service attention especially after my dinner disaster at HEXX. \n\nFrom the hostesses, to the waitress to the busboys, everything was excellent. The staff members here are full of energy and provided our table with great service. I ordered the Cotija cheese crusted quesadilla w/ chicken and requested 2x rice, instead of the beans. I was surprised by how good it tasted. There was plenty of chicken and filling inside the quesadillas. The tortillas were grilled perfectly, with a great crispy texture. For the $15.95 price tag, it was a great deal considering we are in Vegas. My buddy ordered the burrito and enjoyed his food too. The only qualm I had was with the fountain Coca-Cola beverage I ordered. It was extremely watered down and lacked carbonation. \n\nCabo Wabo Cantina, you did not disappoint me!"

(thanks again guys for going above and beyond)\n\nI personally didn't order anything off the menu (liquid dinner FTW), the few things I sampled were really good.\n\nMy only major complaint was that the misters on one of the umbrellas was broken so only about 1/4 of the group had misters, but that is about the only complaint I have.\n\nI would recommend the place, the food is decent, the drinks are good (bonus we got free Cabo Wabo shots at the bar during a Hagar Song), and the staff will go the extra mile, on the strip you can easily do worse, but it's hard to find better"

            "review": "The Cabo Wabo Cantina is another one of those tourist traps along the Strip...but then again, isn't Vegas one big tourist trap?  Come here if you're interested in some mediocre-to-average Mexican food and some good tequila cocktails - unless you have a strong aversion to very bad service and an unprofessional wait staff.  In my opinion: YMMV depending on your expectations and the mood of the waitperson.\n\nPros:\nParty atmosphere\nPeople watching\nStrip location\nGood tequila cocktails\nFree shots for outgoing-types\n\nCons:\nQuality of ingredients and taste of food\nWait staff\nWasted time (long wait for everything)\n\nLet's start with the good: nice Strip location with a lot of foot traffic, which means you'll have plenty of people watching opportunities.  If you are the type to \"do anything\" and cut loose, then you might get a free shot, drink, or shirt - they have games or tequila lines throughout the day/night.  During dinner and throughout the evening, it does get pretty loud and party-like so be advised.  This place definitely isn't for families with kids, seniors, or those with limited mobility.\n\nI went in with a party of 5 - 4 adults and 1 child.  The place is too loud for young children and the outdoor seating has you very close to the tables next to you - good luck trying to squeeze through with a stroller or going with somebody using a cane.  I spent about $100 (including tip) on just food - not bad for a casual bite on the Strip.  You get some decent sized portions for your money and the bartenders aren't shy about making stiff drinks, so it's not that bad if you can tolerate the wait staff and don't expect much from the food.\n\nOur table ordered a few things, including: chicken fajitas, shrimp burrito, nachos, an order of tacos, and of course, drinks.  The food was ok, kind of bland and lacked any excitement despite the loud music blaring throughout the restaurant.  I thought the shrimp was actually good, both the way it was cooked and the marinade, which was a stark contrast to the rest of the items we ordered.  The food isn't up to par with Chevy's but the food is better than Diablo's Cantina; I think both places (Diablo's Cantina and Cabo Wabo) offer a party type atmosphere on the Strip with poor service.  \n\nIf you haven't guessed by now, I concur with the other reviews: Cabo Wabo has terrible service.  They have a young and unprofessional staff that couldn't care less about doing their job let alone paying any attention to the customer's needs.  Maybe they'll come by for more drink orders, maybe they'll come by to bring you the check, maybe they'll come back with your credit card - the whole experience makes you feel as if you're gambling.  Either the folks who work here have never eaten at a restaurant or they pick and choose their moments based on personal preferences/prejudices.  Management is obviously not looking for repeat customers - they are a one and done outfit.  \n\nI think it is odd that most of the \"hip\" joints on the Strip have suspect service and less than average food tied to a decent atmosphere (because of the customers and nothing to do with the actual place).  When compared to similar outfits, the Cabo Wabo is \"ok\" in terms of food, but you really have to check your service expectations at the door.  This place would be a totally different experience with a competent crew, but as it is, I cannot recommend this place to anyone looking for a stress-free meal.  Unfortunately, the Cabo Wabo is completely YMMV based on the whims of your server."

This Vegas magic performance is not a good thing. Chicken and Steak take time to cook!!!  I can tell you, from the taste, that this was not cooked to order.....

The waitress never came back to ask us how our food was, nor did anyone for that matter.  **Ramsey alert, I think this place is a canidate for Kitchen Nightmares!!\n\nIf you want a cool patio view and a drink of some sort, this is your spot, otherwise, RUN, not WALK, somewhere else.

He said they were really popular. I like fish tacos so I went with his recommendation. When I got my plate, there was a huge side of disgusting goopy fried beans (I had asked if they were black beans), oddly dry and favourless fried rice, and 2 very sad looking fish tacos. The tacos consisted of a thin strip of cold dry fish jerky with some shreds of lettuce and tomatoes. I managed to eat one taco and a few scoops of rice because I was hungry and left everything else on my place. The server took my plate away and didn't even ask about my meal.

After Yelp filters some reviews its up to us to decipher  the reviews that are left.  I've noticed several bad reviews recently for Cabo Wabo's & I must say I am surprised.  \n\nWe arrived on a Thursday night & knew we would probably have to kill some time drinking while we waited for a seat, tough life I know.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were sat immediately at the outdoor bar over looking the strip with a clear view of the fountains shooting off across the street @ Bellagio.  When the wind blew just right we could feel  the mist from the fountains, which felt so good in the dry Vegas heat.  Cabo Wabo's was crazy packed but the bar back grabbed us some menus & took initiative getting us our first round of drinks (frozen margaritas & red bull vodkas) while we waited for our server to machete her way threw the weeds she was knee deep in.  It was a gorgeous night to catch up with my Pops & his wife who live here in Las Vegas & we could not have had a better time.   \n\nI can't stress enough how if you go into a restaurant with a chip on your shoulder anticipating bad service your gonna have a shitty experience.  You live in and or you are visiting a great city to party and have fun.   Raise your glass, have a drink, do a shot.... and chill out!  I thought the the food came out in a reasonable time and had no complaints with my service.   The guacamole & chips were money, the chicken chimichangas were as good as it gets (especially after kicking back several margaritas).   I thought my fish tacos with beans & rice were the bomb & devoured every bite.   I was so happy I got my dad to to eat some Mexican fare that night it could not have gotten any better.  This was one bill I had no problem picking up & we will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.\n\nI know the reviews are mixed but I would roll the dice & check it out!"

Probably the worst margarita I've had lately. Then, we ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer. Again, awful. The chips were really hard and tasted stale. We got some type of quesadilla that was pretty good. Overall the service and food was pretty decent. I'm a pretty harsh critic.

The outside portion of the restaurant was crowded and loud and we were initially reluctant to try it out but once we peeked inside it looked pretty sedate. So we decided to give it a shot.\n\nWe ordered the Grilled Top Sirloin Fajitas for two with beans and rice on the side. The food was really good. I enjoyed it a lot. I wish that they would bring more tortillas though. The waiter only brought three for each of us. We breezed through those pretty quick and had to ask for some more because there was still a lot of meat and veggies that we hadn't finished that we needed to wrap up. The waiter apparently expected that we would need more from the beginning because when he brought the food he told us to let him know when we needed more. Why wouldn't he have just given us more at the start? They should bring five tortillas per order, not three.\n\nFor a drink I had the Sammy's Toasted Colada which was a bit fruity for my taste. It was okay but I wouldn't order it again. I was a little bit disappointed with the drink menu. With the amount of sweet, fruity drinks they specialize in one would think that they might cater exclusively to Mexican Bachelorette parties. Everything seems to be rum (oh wait - Sammy's Beach Bar Rum), pineapple juice, coconut, and various fruity fillings. Not the manliest drinks.\n\nI liked the quiet atmosphere (judging by previous reviews this seems to be a rarity here) and the food was good. Expensive, but good. There's no sense complaining about expense when you're in a place founded by a celebrity and it's on the Las Vegas Strip. Ni modo, as\u00ed es la vida."

            "review": "First of all, my friends and I are locals. We knew about this place and we were hoping they might have some Cinco de Mayo specials or at least some good Mexican festive music. Nope, the joint was blasting their tinny-sounding MP3 music on impressive looking speakers. (waste of good speakers)\n\nSo we went out of our way to get here and park so might as well stay a while. I had a feeling our bill was going to be outrageous in the end, but it *IS* the strip so what do you expect. Sort of wish we went to Casa Don Juan but I was overruled. The service we received was actually pretty decent, especially considering how busy it was on a Sunday late afternoon on Cinco de Drinko. Our server was Ashley and she was really sweet, very on top of things so I have no complaints about service. \n\nWe had a party of 5, and we only had to wait maybe 10 or 15 minutes to get seated inside. I ordered a margarita verde which had some cucumbers in it and it was pretty decent, even if it was an overpriced $12, again, it's the Strip. My bf had a couple of regular margaritas, and my friend ordered the \"special\" margarita which was $20 and you kept the glass. It was a frozen drink and was a pretty big size. She said it was good but on the sweet side. \n\nMy boyfriend and i shared some nacho platter (no meat) and we thought they were really delicious, I was quite surprised especially after seeing such bad reviews on the food. The nacho sauce was really good... and it had plenty of super *hot* jalapenos. We ate it all, it was an enormous portion but I was satisfied with paying $15 for it. My friend ordered an avocado burger which she liked. I think our other friends got shrimp ceviche and beef taquitos. No one complained, and we had been there for at least 2 1/2 or 3 hours. \n\nI had two margaritas and the bf had 3 margaritas, plus the nachos, and our total came to a whopping $82!!!!! HOLY. COW. The kicker though....  they sneak in this \"CNF\" charge which was I think 3.5% of the bill. It was around $2.70 on ours anyway. We questioned the fee and the waitress said she \"didn't know what CNF stood for, but it was something the casino or the mall made them pay because they had to pay for rental space there??!!!\" WHAAAAAA...? It wasn't a very good explanation. Since when does something like that get absorbed by the customers, isn't that the cost of doing business on the miracle mile? Just another Strip ripoff. We didn't make a big deal out of it with her but we weren't very happy with the extra charge. Probably not coming back here anytime soon. The reason for the stars rating is because of the prices and the ripoff CNF charge, come on, management, really!?"

Our servers were quick and payed great attention to us, considering we were a table of 25 it was good. Some of their margaritas are very syrup based and tasted way too sugary, but the cucumber jalape\u00f1o one was delicious. (However, it was $26 for a regular size). Cabo Wabo was a fun environment for our large party but the pricing was so expensive. My $16 plate of fajitas did not come with rice and beans (added rice for 1.50).\n\nHad to take off one star because the bathroom was a scary scene. Looks like nobody got to cleaning after someone threw up on the floor in one stall and spilled a slushie in another. The third and final stall was out of order."

My buddy and I wanted to chill and have a couple drinks, so we gave it another try for drinks and appetizers. \n\nWe asked to sit on the outdoor deck overlooking the strip, and it was all good this time.  Our server was very attentive and fun.  The margaritas were good.  The chips and salsa were good.  The \"Mexiyaki\" chicken wings were great.  We had a great time and ended up having \"more than couple\" margaritas along the way.   \n\nPricing seemed fine for drinks and appetizers in Vegas.  I think the tab with tax for chips and salsa, chicken wings, and about 8 margaritas was about $100.00  \n\nAll in all, I'd say Cabo Wabo is great for drinks and appetizers if you want casual and if you want to sit outside.  They have indoor seating, but I can't speak to that.  For me at least, one the main draws is the outdoor deck overlooking the strip."

She told him that we were fine, not waiting on anything. 15 minutes later\nwhen we finished our drinks he came over to our table and asked how we were\ndoing. I said our food was taking really long and he said he would go find out\nwhat was going on. He talked to our old female server and she said 'oh sh*t' \nand then asked what we had to order again.

I told my boyfriend if I said\nanything I was going to get really upset because we had not even been \napologized to at this point in time.

We flagged him down and\nexplained that we had waited so long and it was ridiculous not to have anything\ndone to our bill.

Cant wait to come back when the weather os a little warmer."

We wanted to grab a few last cocktails on The Strip before catching our flight home. \nWe went to the bar; the counter seats were full, but not one of the 30+ tables had a guest seated. We let the hostess know we'd like a table since the bar was full. She asked us if we would be having lunch there as well; we just ate and were not interested in dining, we just wanted drinks. Both of the hostesses that were there informed us that they could not seat us at a table if we only wanted drinks. I MIGHT understand this if there was a high demand for tables, but keep inmind that NO ONE was seated at the tables. They couldn't spare one table and serve us drinks?!?!\nWe asked \"you're really going to turn down paying customers because we don't want food?!\".....her response \"it's our policy; we can't seat you if you're not ordering food too.\"\n\nWe went a few doors down to La Salsa Cantina, and had a couple of delicious margaritas & food was not mandatory. \n\nWhy in the world would you turn down a paying customer?"

So while we were at CinemaCon this year we stopped in for dinner. We were very disappointed. I would have given it 3 stars for food. 1 star for service. To start with it was not busy, We were seated under a heat lamp on a rather warm night and had to move, I felt like I was getting a sun burn. Unfortunately no one came to check on us for some time. We almost walked out but right then we found a table not under a heat lamp and the bus boy helped us move to that table. Finally we met our waitress, she was very rude right off the bat. \"what do you want to drink?\", I told her I was hoping to see a drink menu. I was informed they were out. \"If you come back next week you can see one.\" Yes she really said that. WOW! So I just got a boring margarita. Turns out it tasted like almost every other margarita I ever had. I had been feeling festive and wanted to try something new but oh well.  At this point we changed our plans and decided just to have our first drink and finish our dinner and find someplace else to have a few fun drinks and desert. Too bad because we had permission to use the company credit card for a night out. Cabo Wabo could have made more than a few bucks off of us sucker tourists. Haha. Well, When the waitress would condescend to stop by, she never once smiled. Made me feel like we were bothering her by coming in. Food was pretty good. I was just shocked at the attitude of the waitstaff we encountered. Also on a side note, I slipped on spilled ice when going to the restroom (womans restroom was a mess). The employees did not even help me up, a couple customers did. Luckily I was not hurt just turns out high heels and ice dont mix well, but the girl working inside, who was about 20 feet away when I fell,  could have asked me if I was okay nor did anyone seem concerned there was ice on the floor.\n\nIf I had to sum up our visit in one word: BUMMER"

When we finally met them we were on the brink of starvation so decided to go to Cabo Wabo (we were staying at PH). It couldn't be that bad, right? Alas, we fell into the age old trap of being starving on vacation, picking the first place you see instead of pushing on to find something better, and eating somewhere crappy.\n\nWe sat inside for the A/C. It is LOUD in there. There were only four of us but we were practically screaming at each other. We didn't want to order $14 margaritas, so we got a round of Blue Moon beers. They don't have a drink menu, so we found out when we got the bill that these were $8.50 each. Rip off. My friend ordered chips and salsa. The salsa was pretty decent. I got two chicken soft tacos. They were ok. A really huge portion, I could barely finish one of them. My husband got some kind of burrito smothered in cheese that looked disgusting. He said it was alright. \n\nWe were seated next to an annoying stagette with a bride who thought it was awesome to stand on the table in her bikini bottoms singing along (badly) to Don't Stop Believing (eye roll). Props to the staff member who stood by her to make sure she didn't fall on her head. \n\nNo atmosphere, expensive drinks, and bland, overpriced food. The only saving grace was that our waiter was a super hunk."

I had an early lunch around 11:30 am on a Wednesday and sat outside to watch people walk by on the Strip.\n\nI had a pretty good experience at Cabo Wabo. The Cactus Pear Margarita was surprisingly tasty, and I'm not always a big fan of margs. I had the guacamole (not as great as some were saying, but pretty decent) and the jalapeno cilantro chicken. Nothing was spectacular, but nothing was terrible either.\n\nTo me, the big downer on Cabo Wabo is the price. But come on, it's right on the Las Vegas Strip - what do you expect? My drink, guac, and entree came to $34, so I used up my Groupon and then some. Between the price of the Groupon and the amount I paid in tax/tip, the whole experience ran me around $26. Without the Groupon it would have been $41, which seems awfully high for one person. However, Cabo Wabo does have a happy hour from 4-7 pm with half-price drinks and appetizers. I'd imagine that would be worth your time - if you can get a seat."

They have a really cool patio where you can look out over the strip and people watch. The patio gets busy so you need to get a spot early or hold onto it once you have it.. \n\nThey have a mix of live music, karaoke and jam sessions with famous musicians including Sammy when he is in town. Bonus if your lucky enough to be around when this happens. The bands are very loud in the evening so not a place to have a quiet conversation.\n\nThey specialize in Sammy's own tequila - Cabo Wabo. I'm not a tequila expert by any means but this stuff is strong! You can have it straight up, in a mixed drink or in a frozen drink blend. I switched to Beer after the first tequila, unfortunately they had a limited selection.\n\nFood is average. We had the nachos and home made Guac. which was both good and refreshing (lot's of cilantro). The fish tacos were good as was the burrito.  \n\nService was good, we were given a table quickly and received our drinks within minutes. Not sure if we had a new survey on my last visit but they were not overly familiar with the menu details. The server also gave us some recommendations for various bars to visit later in the evening.    \n\nPrices were on the higher end for what you get which is why I rated Cabo 2.5 stars. I would go back depending on the live music in the evening but would grab dinner elsewhere before arriving. Stick with drinks and appetizers given all the food options in Vegas."

Back when I was single I actually owned and decorated my apartment with nick-nacks of lighthouses. I am married now, with kids, and yes a resident of Las Vegas. Lighthouses, actual and my have become extinct.\n\nHere Cabo Wabo, the food was good. For an appetizer we ordered some good old fashioned chips and salsa, which were fine, although a few of our chips were stale. I ate fajitas (steak and chicken combo) and they were fine. The tortillas, three of them, were served wrapped in paper. two of the three tortillas needed to be peeled apart. I don't know, that just didn't seem right to me. My wife ordered a burrito and says it tasted fine. \n\nShe also ordered a side of guacamole which cost $9.00. I ordered some french fries which cost $5.00. Seems to me these two side orders should have cost the same. I don't know, maybe that's just me. \n\nSeating, I don't know, I like having some elbowroom myself. But it's non-existant here. Tables are very close together. I noticed severs having to \"squeeze it in\" more than once while walking between tables. If there were an emergency situation. Or something loud like a car backfiring near-by, this crowded patio could become a problem.\n\nWhen we arrived at Cabo Wabo we were inside The Miracle Mile shops. So we stopped at the host stand inside. We were told to go outside to the outside host stand. Now, I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if I were the host I would have said something to the effect of \"We have a host stand just outside as well, follow me, let me take you there.\" I don't know just sounds a little more professional to me.\n\nAs the wife and I were departing, we passed by the Lighthouse to go inside and return to the Miracle Mile Shops. My wife mentioned that the inside of the place was quite empty (it was about 1:00pm) and was surprised the hostess didn't just seat us or walk us through like earlier mentioned. I don't know. I really want to like Cabo Wabo. My wife really enjoyed the experience. I'll wait to read her review and maybe rethink the whole persoal experience."

One waitress walked by and glared at us, giving me a look like \"what the fuck are you doing here and why are you making my life miserable?\" So we waited a few more minutes and left. \n\nWhat I observed while waiting was that the ritas are served in plastic cups, which tells me that they are not going to be good.

However Chris told us about some specials and I love hanging with my group of Yelpies so I came along. \n\nThe staff is awesome at this place!\n\nFirstly, they went above the notch in honoring a drink special that was only for the 4th but we mistakenly thought was ongoing. Thank you to the manager, Roland, who was very nice in doing this for us and for checking in on us a few times in the night. \n\nOur server was spot on. Seriously- we were checked on often, water cups never empty, chips and salsa never empty until we friggin' were so stuffed and saying \"no more!!!\". Some of the best service I've had in a long time so a shoutout to Donnie. \n\nSometime in the night they put on the \"Mas Tequila\" song and were giving out free shots at the bar. No glass here, the dancing ladies poured it into your mouth and poured as much as your mouth can handle. I dont know how often this happens.\n\nI had a 2 for 1 frozen margarita (this is from a coupon) and got a regular margarita and a pina colada though there were a few other flavors to choose from (strawberry daquiri, orange creme and peach I think). It was hot on the patio and hey, I'm at a place called Cabo Wabo so might as well drink something beach-y. They weren't very strong, I probably wouldn't buzz if I didn't get the big shot of Tequila at the bar. They were refreshing none the less so for $10, it was not bad at all.\n\nI wasn't feeling like eating something heavy (I was waiting for my BF to have dinner with) so I was just drinking and noshing on chips, but I took a bite of my buddy Nins chicken taquitos and dipped them in a cheese sauce. They were actually decent and the chicken was juicy. I think most of the food seems ok. I wouldnt go as a local out of my way to drive down there, but you're in the area, it might be fine. \n\nIf you like Tex- Mex food, Sammy Hagar/classic rock blasting and a unpretentious atmosphere, a patio to people watch (and watch the Bellagio fountains) this might be a place for you.\n\nI wasn't expecting to have a good night based on the negative reviews of service, but I am pleasantly surprised."

When the chips and salsa and drinks came we were so hungry we dove right in. The salsa tasted like burnt cigarettes, and the margaritas were the worst I have ever had. Too sour and soooo watered down. Mind you pitchers were $45 so we were expecting something much better. We decided we didn't even want to give the food a chance (I had previously heard a table behind us talking about how horrible the food was.) We asked to cash out and got out of there as fast as we could. I\nwill compliment the manager for only making us pay $30 for a $100 bill. Yes $100 for horrible chips/salsa and margaritas.

I did them a solid and told them to avoid this place at all costs.\n\nMy main motivation for choosing this spot was that it is directly across the street from my hotel (Cosmopolitan). While the service and atmosphere were fairly pleasant, the food was a downright letdown. My sister and I ordered two cappuccinos, carne asada tacos, and guacamole. Everything was at most mediocre in taste with the exception of the carne asada tacos. Those came with a side of rice and beans which were absolutely disgusting to the point where I couldn't get myself to finish them. The beans were stale and lacking in flavor. They literally tasted as if they had been left out sitting for an hour or so. Gross! The rice tasted as if it had come directly from a box and soaked in tomato sauce. This may fly for unsuspecting patrons whom have never had the distinct pleasure of having a solid plate of rice and beans, but no sir, not me. It was pitiful. Not only that, but I really do believe I got food poisoning from that disgusting food. What an absolute disappointment. Not only did this restaurant shaft me with their overpriced, subpar food, but they also caused me to have severe stomach pains (I'll spare you the details) for the rest of my trip.

They do have a nice location right on the strip but slightly elevated. I looked at the menu and order the Shrimp Taco's. The waiter decided that I would like the Sammy Shrimp better. When he brought it out, I asked him where my taco's were. He said, \"I thought you might like this better.\"\nEveryone else had their food and we had a flight to catch so I said \"whatever\". It wasn't that good but it was food. \nWhen I got the bill, he charged me for Shrimp and not the tacos. The Shrimp is the most expensive plate on the menu. I said no way, I didn't order that. I said bill me for what I ordered. \nHe went to check with the manager and came back and said she said no. He then trys to play the guilt trip on me by saying he will take it out of his own pocket. That may work on some people. I said I will talk to the manager. He stopped me and said he would ask again. He came back and offered to take $5 off. I know this is a scam that they use to increase average bill. They may even get bonuses for selling the most expensive items. Sad."

I was skeptical at first because I figured these guys focus their efforts hocking 3' tall slushy drinks on the miracle mile. I was wrong.\nWe sat at the bar and ordered a round of mojitos. Before I knew it we were 2 mojitos down and the bartenders started pouring shots of fireball on the house while grilling us on our favorite nfl teams. It was basically nfl trivia; get a question right, get a shot, get a question wrong, get shot with a water pistol (I got shot a lot). We laughed with these guys for a solid hour while drinking some of the best mojitos I've ever had and laughing about sports.\nIf you get the chance to sit down at Cabo Wabo I highly recommend sitting at the bar because these guys know how to have a good time."

So, when I got the chance to go to one of his signature joints, it was a no brainer.  \n\nFirst the drinks.  I had the Waborita.  Three of them actually.  They were, as expected, really good.  I've had Cabo Wabo tequila before and it's a good tequila.  These drinks were large and packed a punch.  Not to mention, they tasted good.\n\nSecond, the food.  The food was also good.  The portions were large.  Not super large.  But not small.  The food tasted good and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The salsa, which they claimed was XXX spicy, was not what I expected as XXX spicy.  It was hot though and tasted good.  \n\nNext, the service.  Service was prompt.  The waitress was attentive to our needs and friendly.  Really couldn't ask for much more!\n\nThe price.  It's a bit on the high side.  But then again, you are in Las Vegas.  If you are looking for cheap Mexican-ish food, there are plenty of Chipotles and Taco Bells floating around.  The quality here is better.  Expect to pay more.  \n\nLastly, the atmosphere.  This is where I have my only real complaint about this place.  It felt like Jay Z, Pitbull, and Drake were on loop play, with the occasional rock song thrown in.  I know there are people that like that crap, but come on!  This is Sammy Hagar's place.  Play some damn Rock and Roll!\n\nAll in all, I recommend it.  Just be prepared to spend a bit above average and to hear some crappy hip hop pop junk music."

I knew it was a tourist trap but even with that I was surprised how bad the service and food was.  Had to beg for our (mediocre) chips and salsa.  After 20 minutes of not getting our drinks this time I called for a manager.  He told us that our server got tied up with a large group.  I guess our group of 7 was not large enough.  Finally after asking him for our drinks he went and got them.  Having ordered a $7 draft Coors Light he brings that back 3/4 full *sigh*.  \n\nAt this point, we just want to get our food and hope it's at least decent for the outrageous prices they charge.  Nope...wrong.  I ordered a steak soft taco and steak enchilada.  If you like the $2 steak tacos at Taco Bell then you would like these.  Seriously, I couldn't taste the difference.  Out of 7 dishes, only 1 person said their food was actually good.\n\nContinuing on with the bad service after waiting to get our check, we all added up our totals.  We were in the process of leaving our bad tip (sorry I usually tip well but this was terrible, un-apologetic, bad service) when a different (new) server comes out and asks if she can see the check because she believes she needed to add something to our bill.  Yeah right...\n\nI know the patio has a nice people/fountain view but avoid this place if you can.  I love Sammy Hagar but he failed especially with this place."

We decided it was a better value to get the pitcher.  The margaritas where delicious, and had a good about of tequila in them.  If you decide to visit the restaurant, I would only come for the margaritas.  The server was also very friendly and attentive.\n\nThe food items were very expensive, and the portion size was very small.  I have seen more rice and beans on children's plates at other restaurants.  On the plus side the small portions you do get taste good and are freshly made.\n\nSome of the negatives:\n\nI have never been to a Mexican restaurant where they didn't toss a basket of chips and salsa on your table when you sat down.  Here it's a $6 charge if you want chips and salsa.\n\nMost of the items do not come with beans and rice, that will cost you and additional $7 on top of the cost of the entree dish.\n\nCheck your bill before paying.  I noticed a $8 \"CNF\" charge on my bill.  When I asked what that was I was told it was a concession fee because the Planet Hollywood charges them for being on the property.  Basically, Cabo Wabo wants to charge me outrages food prices and then on top of that help pay their rent.  I informed the server I wanted to speak to the manager because I was not going to pay this additional fee.  She returned with different bill with the CNF fee removed.  I can't imagine how many people pay that fee without asking a question as to why. \n\nAlthough the margaritas were delicious, and the food good, albeit small in portion, I would not come back here because of the very expensive prices and because of them trying to add on additional charges to my tab without informing me."

She doesn't smile, isn't pleasant one bit and asks, well, are you going to be eating?  Um, what do you think we came here to just sit at lunchtime?  She stands there looking puzzled for about 20 seconds, then finally took us to the seats without saying anything.  The waiter was cool but man, the food sucked - I had burrito and hubby had combo plate.  He asks for spicier salsa... we charge extra for that... jalapenos?  we charge extra for that.... really? You're charging 14 bucks for a burrito and you can't throw us some lousy jalapenos??  Never coming here again that's for sure... terrible hostess, terrible food at high prices."

However, when the four of us entered this restaurant, we were seated and serviced quickly. The food was awesome! Customer service was good, but wasn't excellent. However, no one was rude. They did what they were supposed to, but wasn't exactly working for tips as it relates to service with a smile.. That is the only reason I didn't give this establishment a 5 star rating.

We headed out from our hotel, Aria, and Cabo Wabo's patio fit the bill.  The second floor patio provided nice views of the Bellagio lake,and the misters under the umbrellas were an added bonus!\n\nWe started with some guacamole and queso which came with two huge baskets of corn chips.  The guacamole was ok, the cheese was really runny, and the chips were in tiny pieces which make dipping a challenge.\n\nFor mains, between us we had the Baja fish tacos, the jalapeno chicken, and the southwest cobb salad.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry, but the overall flavour was good and spicy.  The fish tacos featured grilled fish which was also a bit try, and they definitely weren't the best I'd ever had.  The salad looked great, and was a huge portion.\n\nThere definitely wasn't any food that would be worth returning for.  The prices were a bit expensive for what we got, particularly the $15 banana mama drink that was not that tasty.  The waiter was attentive, but was well versed in upselling, however not in a pushy way.\n\nI wouldn't return, there are other restaurants in Vegas with equally decent patios that I would try first."

Cabo Wabo has a good view of the strip so it's no surprise the prices are high, but the unnecessarily high prices will always knock off a star in my book.  We ordered appetizers, including chips, fajitas, quesadillas, and other sampler dishes for our party.  The food was actually very subpar - it seemed almost microwaved or cooked in a large batch.  If I were to spend a lot of money on food, I would want it cooked for me in particular, not just placed on my plate.\n\nIf you want a drink, come to Cabo Wabo.

However the food was terrible, nothing at all like the Cabo Wabo in Mexico.  I was really hoping for at least something similar, but it was some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The menu was completely different too, and the only similarity was the name on the sign.  So, if you're going for a drink and simple appetizer, you will love the atmosphere.

It was incorrect.. it looked unappealing.. but hey, I gave it a chance. Sufficed to say, I won't be going back for that particular menu item. (I did mention to the server that it was incorrect... he claimed they sent the wrong one, and I said I would deal with it.. but on the bill, it was listed as BEEF Fajita Burrito..as in.. he ordered the wrong item and lied to me about it.) Mistakes happen.. I get it... I'm just sayin.\n\nThe 2 friends I was with, both decided it was pretty bad service as there were missing utensils, drinks for the 3 of us were coming one at a time.. and there really seemed to be no excuse for the lack in service, because they were not at all busy.   We all agreed that the drinks weren't bad.. and the outdoor patio is a nice attraction to ''people watch' from .. but other than that.. I will not be eating any of their \"signature\" dishes again...ever. They had chicken tenders with fries on the menu, and if I ever visit this spot again to have drinks.. and decide that I am hungry (and very lazy, because there are 10 better choices less than 50 feet away, ) I will be having those. \n\nI don't recommend the food at all.

Go go go.\" In a really hush and angry voice, and the other waiter were off before we had a chance to follow her. \n\nWe were all in some sort of chock; we have never experienced anything like this before.

I like Sammy Hagar, I like patios and I like tequila, but there is nothing to like about this place.  Okay, maybe the patio for the simple fact that the people watching is great and it's a great location on the strip.  \n\nI love food and I'm not ashamed of the fact that I like to get my grub on.  So, for me to leave a restaurant and NOT EAT MY FOOD really says something.  That is exactly what happened at this establishment.\n\nA server took our drink order.  Ten minutes later, we got our water and beer.  Then, over 25 minutes went by before he came back for our food order.  No exaggeration.  All of this could have been overlooked had the server been nice (he wasn't) and/or the food been good (it wasn't).  It took an hour for us to get our order of nachos and fish tacos.  I ordered nachos because I thought, \"how do you screw up nachos?\"  Well, Cabo Wabo has found a way.  The nachos consisted of about 12 individual tortilla chips and each chip had this meat cheese crustiness.  The overall effect was dog food.  My nachos looked like dog food.  They had a really weird taste too.  And the fish tacos looked better but tasted equally bad.  We literally got our check and left without eating our food.  And left a 10% tip due to the bad service, even though it killed me to do it.\n\nI enjoy a good tourist spot.  They're overpriced and a little cheesy, but sometimes I dig it.  If you want a good tourist trap, visit Margaritaville.  I've never had bad food or bad service there and that place is incredibly busy.  Oh, Sammy.  Why????"

We opted to enter from inside and asked to be seated indoors which only had about 7 tables occupied.  Our server came promptly to get our drink orders.  I had checked in on Yelp which offered a free margarita ($10) value but I also had a coupon for 20% off (it's in the Miracle Mile coupon book).  I opted to get the free drink but after, I should have used the coupon, as the drink was too strong for me and I drank less than half.  My husband happily finished it for me though.\n\nI focused on the tacos and fajitas on the menu.  The fajitas come for 1 or 2.  We shared the grilled sirloin fajitas and for $3 more we got beans and rice.  The food came out quick and the platter had lots of cut up beef and grilled peppers on it.  We each received 3 warm small tortillas wrapped in paper.  We devoured them pretty quick and asked for more.\n\nService was more attentive at the beginning of our meal and then died off.  It still wasn't very busy inside so it wasn't that the server was so busy.  The food was good, but I'm not sure if it was worth $42 for 2.  The drinks are about $14 each so it can add up.\n\nThere was a little stage set up when you first walk in but I don't know when bands play.  It seems more popular to sit outside, listen to music, and enjoy the Strip views."

The first thing I waiter did was pull an old waiter tip trick -- putting coaster under a \"wiggly\" table. The table wasn't even slightly off kilter. Whatever. I asked for water and Dr. Pepper to drink. He brought waters for everyone and 2 sodas and 2 beers. While we were looking over the menu we had questions. My mom and I don't eat beef or seafood, and their menu is very heavy with both of those things. We asked the waiter if we could switch the meat in the beef tacos to chicken. The answer was no. We asked if we could have chicken tacos in hard shells instead of soft corn. The answer was no. We finally settled on chicken taquitos which is technically an appetizer, but the only thing on the menu we MIGHT eat. It didn't come with anything so we both added beans and rice. My brother got some kind of beef taco in a soft corn tortilla and his friend got some kind of beef burrito. When they brought out the food, I had 4 taquitos on my plate, and my mom only had 3, so she asked, and they brought her another one. I ate exactly ONE taquito. The chicken inside was tough and bland. The rice was tasteless as were the beans. \n\nThe waiter brought our check and it was $100 for four dinners, two of which weren't even eaten. We ended up boxing it up and giving it to a homeless man on the strip. \n\nDon't expect chips and salsa either. That's an extra $3.95, where I come from chips and salsa is always complimentary. \n\nHonestly, we had a hole in wall down the street that was SOOOO much better. \n\nOur waiter was rude, never once smiled, and seemed legitimately agitated. \n\nMy brother and his friend liked it, so if you eat beef or shrimp, you might too, but if you are chicken eater like me and mom I wouldn't recommend this place."

While walking thru the shops, we decided to share a yard margarita.  (If we wanted to play tourists, we had to look the part!)  Fat Tuesdays had a line down the hall and around the corner!  So we thought we'd see what else was in the shops.  We thought we were lucky because just as we were about to walk out of the shops, Cabo Wabo Cantina appears with a margarita/daiquiri stand.  We end up getting the  1/2 yard with a strawberry margarita.  The first couple sips, neither of us said anything.  I didn't care for the drink so I stopped drinking it.  About 2 minutes later, my husband looks at me and says \"Doesn't this taste a little funny?\"   Yes!  It tasted like a watered down slushie/virgin margarita!  We decided to salvage the drink...went to ABC Store, bought Bacardi's Cherry flavor and poured a couple shots in there.  It tasted much better after that.  All and all...the drink cost over $30 (between the cost of the  1/2 yard at Cabo Wabo, tip, and ABC liquor purchase).  Will we go back?  Heck NO!  I'll wait in line at Fat Tuesdays or skip the drink next time.\n\nPS:  This struck me as very strange....Our server at Cabo Wabo was counting her tips.  And not just quickly going thru the cash and then waiting on us.  She was pretending to be interested in us while she was counting out her money.  We told her our drink order and she gave us the \"deer in the headlights\" look with a blank smile!  She wasn't paying attention to one word we said!  We repeated our order, she recounted her money then got us our drink.  Not sure why it was so important to count her money so intensely but it was kinda weird!"

The whole experience sounds great right?\n\nWell it was until I got the bill. 160 pre-tip. The lesson we learned was not to let someone else pick our tequila shots for us lest we pay 14 dollars per shot.\n\nPar for the course in Vegas I guess. Still, I would go back looking for Mexicanesque food, just that I might fill up on chips and beer buckets."

We turned around from the Bellagio fountains and saw Cabo Wabo and decided to check out the prices.  On a Monday evening around 6pm the place was pretty empty and we sat inside.  The service was excellent and overall we had a very enjoyable dinner experience and I will return to eat here.  Now, the food is a bit overpriced for casual mexican-fare - but this is a Strip-facing restaurant and overpriced food is just normal.  If you live here, you know this well and can't exactly fault the place for it.  If the prices are too much for you, go find a mexican restaurant inside a not-so-popular hotel.  \n\nWe started with the fresh guacamole and it was simply wonderful and fantastic and worth the splurge if more than one person will eat it.  I had two margaritas ($12.00 each) - both of which were very good and large.  I ordered the shrimp tacos ($16.00) and each taco had 5-6 wonderfully breaded shrimp.  They were excellent!!   My brother in law had the Mahi Mahi tacos ($16.00) and he LOVED them!!   We also order off the kids menu for our toddler - which is often ridiculous of us because she doesn't eat that much - but we did.  The kids menu is very diverse with many options and the serving side was almost like an adult portion.  What she didn't eat, my brother in law finished off - so it didn't go to waste!  \n\nAll in all this was a great dining experience - and great for families with kids.

The fajitas were shared between two people and with a side of rice and beans provided enough food for two.  \n\nPros: lots of chips; friendly waitress, tender chicken\nCons: no onions in the fajitas (huh?!), had to ask for water refills, service was slow bringing extra plates, loud background music.\n\nOn the subject of the background music, when we came in the music was loud but not so loud as to prevent conversation.  We saw the head waiter/boss/manager-guy turn the music up to something that was too loud, and then at one point he turned it up even louder so that some waitress girls could dance on the bar top for (presumably) the entertainment of the diners.  The music unfortunately didn't make a descent down from the jet-engine level it had been set at for the amusement.  We saw one lady with her elderly mother get up, speak to the manager guy while gesticulating wildly, and then march out.  We couldn't hear anything of what they said because the music was too loud, but presumably they weren't pleased at the conversation-stopping level either.  \n\nThe location is convenient but if my memory serves me there is another cantina place in the same mall where one could go to eat and  communicate with fellow diners."

Bottom line, food was really pretty good, no complaints amongst the group and I liked my Carne Asada Burrito well enough.  It's Vegas and on the strip so it's overpriced and all, but that's to be expected.  What one shouldn't have to settle for is poor or slow service.  Lunch took well over an hour, about 2/3 of which passed after our food arrived; the waiter just disappeared.   Additionally, they seated us at the table in front of the door to the deck, which would've been find except that remember we sat INSIDE becasue of the wind.  So every time they opened the door, it would slam back against the wall and the rush of wind would blow everything off the table, Took 3-4 instances of this and a few parties complaining before they figured out not to use that door and divert to a door closer to the bar.  Better values and equally good food to be had in the Miracle Mile if you find yourself at PH.\n\nAlso, although I am not a drinker, I did use the free Maragarita with a Yelp check in to score a drink for my buddy.  This seemed to confuse both the server and the manager ( the Yelp coupon, not the Margarita). Seems like it would be a good idea to  make sure your employees know your offers on social media!"

I wouldn't mind so much the expense if it was good, but it was bad.  Just bad.\n\nWhen my partner and I arrived, we were seated by the hostess pretty quickly -- it was late on a week night.  We chose to sit outside, perfect spot for people watching.  We were informed that our waitress would be with us shortly.  \"She was in the bathroom\"!?  We waited and waited, and then waited.  Finally after she finished up in the bathroom , she arrived to take our order with indifference.  Apparently, we interrupted her potty time.\n\nA long time later, some other guy brought us our food.  I ordered the combo plate --  2 taquitos and a tamale.  The taquitos were approximately 3 inches long each.  Finger food.. the kind you get in the frozen section at your grocery store.  The tamale was approximately half the size of the typical tamale you get at any other Mexican food restaurant, and about as good as a Swanson frozen dinner selection.  My partners fajitas smelled, and looked much better.  I wished I had ordered them.  He later informed me they were rather bland.  Not even on par with Chili's or any other chain restaurant.\n\nOk the drinks.... we both ordered the margaritas.  $10 for a small plastic cup!!  These were the kind you can get down on Fremont Street for a buck, and maybe not as good.  \n\nAdvice if you must go here --  Drink soda, sit on the patio for prime people watching, and don't order a combo plate.  Don't expect good food, so have some nachos or something.   Surely they can't screw those up, but I can't attest to it.  I didn't order those."

The food and drinks were okay, definitely overpriced, but it's the location that you're really paying for. It located on Planet Hollywood's property.\n\nMy biggest complaint has to be the hidden CNF fee. When we received our bill I noticed the tax and another line that said CNF fee. I inquired about the CNF line and the bartender said she really didn't know what it was or why they charged it. She thinks it's a fee that Planet Hollywood imposes on them, so they pass it down to the consumers. I can't even remember what the percentage was, but the issue is that extra fees should be posted somewhere for everyone to see. I asked to see the menu again and it was not posted anywhere there. I asked them if this fee is posted anywhere and she said she didn't think so. You can't surprise consumers with extra fees on the bill!!! She did offer to bring a manager over to explain the fee to me, but I didn't feel like waiting. \n\nIt's a 3 star place, minus 1 for hidden fees."

They do have misters' on a warm Vegas day to cool you off on the patio.  The breakfast here is good too.  The fish tacos and shrimp tacos are both great.  The chorizo queso is excellent, and the chips and salsa are also great.  The drink prices are kind of high, but you get an awesome view of the strip.  If you want some tasty food or a good drink go here and try to sit on the patio."

I thought it was way too early to drink so I didnt get to taste the drinks but the girls said they were strong and good. I don't recall the name of what I had for breakfast but do remember finishing the whole plate and it was just what i needed. In fact, all the girls devoured most of their food. We were at the outdoors seating and it was nice for people watching, and to plan our next adventure. I would return here on MY future bachelorette weekend !!"

Actually, greasy is the wrong word... It was oily. Very oily. Ew. \n\nWe had basic eggs, bacon, toast and hashbrowns which I thought was hard to screw up but somehow they went above and beyond. Took an entire napkin to soak up the oil from my easy over eggs. My friend had the scrambled eggs which were clearly scooped from a bucket of pre-made, and gooey, eggs. Makes me shudder to think of it.\n\nThe service was brutal. She forgot to bring us knives and forks, then forgot salt and pepper, and the ketchup and then she sat in the corner giggling with the rest of the staff until we finally asked someone else. What a joke.\n\nAvoid at all costs."

Then we go on and I asked for a green salsa and his reply was \"you can have whatever you want\" not to mention he was going to tag me with additional $9.00 for Guacamole dip, well I asked for green Salsa not a dip. We go on without any complaints as we all felt the situation was weird. The food comes in, I ordered the fish of the day, Scottish Salmon, good plate presentation until the plate tasted like all SALT, went on and tried to eat as we were all starving, it got to the point where I could not continue.

They play current pop music but then could have a band one night and then a solo artist the next. The patio area is open and has a pretty good view of the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan.  \n\nI was there with a small group of 5 and we only had to wait about 15 minutes on a Saturday night. Not bad. There is no complimentary chips and salsa but we ordered some anyway along with guacamole. The chips were above average and I would buy a bag if they sold them. The salsa wasn't bad either. Once everyone at the table realized the guacamole I ordered was $9, they stopped and let me eat it. I also ordered a bloody mary. One thing I have found recently is that mexican joints have some of the best bloody marys. This proved to be true once again.\n\nI had the chicken sabana which was like nothing I've ever experienced at a mexican restaurant. My wife had the carnitas tacos which she could not finish. Not because they give you a lot but there was a strange taste that did not agree with her. I tried a piece and was glad I ordered what I did. \n\nWith that said, if I'm in the area and looking for a cool atmosphere with decently priced food, I would try them again."

The appetizer sampler was alright, but at $24 nothing special, just the usual items.  I would not have been able to tell the difference between it and your usual rinky dinky Mexican restaurants back home.  Now the real reason I went was for Sammy's Cabo Wabo tequila, I ordered one on the rocks ($14).  Who knows if they used the real stuff, but it tasted like cheap tequila, or was extremely watered down already.  My other half had a house frozen margarita ($10), and I swear there wasn't a drop of alcohol in it, just mix and ice.  Total bill for 2 drinks and appetizer with tax, tip and some CNF charge(?)= $60.  So disappointed in Sammy, wish he would make sure the quality stays competitive."

I'm accustomed to the concept of overpriced food on the Strip, so I couldn't totally fault this place for being any different in that respect.

We ordered the churros afterwards, and again, just good.  They had nice flavor, but were a bit on the overcooked side.  When the waitress finally brought the check around, though, we were appalled to see that a standard sized bottle of Corona was $9 and the small plastic cup of house margarita was $11!  Seriously?  The larger \"specialty\" margaritas that the table next to us ordered were only a couple dollars more and looked to be at least twice the size!  I was glad that we declined the refills she offered.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't go back or recommend to friends.  The service was slow (with the exception of the free chips and salsa), and our server was inattentive bordering on rude.  The food was average for the most part.

            "review": "Was looking fw to coming here as my BF is a Sammy Hagar fan. We were seated in a booth after I requested it. Our server Adam was not very professional. We showed him the yelp check in free margarita and\nasked for light ice. He brought the margarita it wasn't light ice and I said I asked for light ice... he shrugged his shoulders. Really??? My BF while dipping chips into the salsa discovered a long hair literally buried in the salsa that was served with the greasy tortilla chips. Omg how disgusting. At this point we were Leary and my BF wanted to leave so I asked for the manager. She came over and said we threw out that batch of salsa and we told her about the margarita with the ice issue. She got me a new margarita with light ice. Also we told her that we're off to a bad start and were Leary about ordering anymore food. She assured us she would make sure that our order was checked by herself personally before coming out and she would come back to check in. Well that never happened. My BF asked her which steak platter to get and she recommended the NY strip. So trusting her recommendations that we decided to order. I ordered a salad with carne assda aka there version is (sirloin steak) and my BF ordered the NY strip. Omg my salad had no carne asada. It was chopped up pieces of bacon and my BF NY strip steak was all grizzle. We both sent back our entrees. They remade my salad with slices of carne assda which was very chewy and he got the carne asada (sirloin steak). My salad was meh it was thrown together very quickly and his carne assda again was extremely chewy uneatable and tasteless. Reluctantly we ate the meal. Adam brought the bill and they tried to make it look like a discount. But it wasn't much especially for all the issues we had. So we again asked for the manager and my BF noticed our waiter was whispering to another server and both looking at us. Wow....how tacky and unprofessional. The same manager came back along with a guy which was never introduced to us and she said I was dealing with a party but she did walk past are area several times but never stopped by us during are entrees as promised to us so my BF told her that his gut feeling was he wanted to leave after the hair in the salsa and that he sent back the NY strip and he showed her the uneatable carne asada (sirlion steak) as proof and said this wasn't the experience he was looking for and was extremely disappointed.  She paused and her body language wanted to do nothing. The guy with her said remove the carne asada. Wow really??? Thanks....so my BF went to wash up and the manager came back with the adjusted bill and I told her this was overall a horrible experience and my salad was meh. She said finally I'm taking care of the bill. Please come back.\n\nLOL had you not avoided us and been more attentive when are entrees came out and also didn't come back after we both sent back are entrees. We arm wrestled with them to get the entire meal compted in itself is just bad customer service period. My BF gut feeling was correct. He wanted to go to the Border Grill after the salsa incident but I wanted to give them a chance. HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!"

This place does have a few great things going for it- they took our reservation of 14 (tough to find on the strip without a set menu), there is a beautiful patio located in the middle of the strip (with a view of the Bellagio fountains), it's a fun atmosphere with music, and the price point is low. Sold!\n\nSo why only 3 stars? We should have been assigned our own server with a group our size, but we weren't. It took forever to get chips/salsa (which they charge for!), I got my drink after my meal though I ordered it long before, and a couple of the orders were wrong. I asked for no onions or sour cream on my tostada and it had both. Also, one of the girl's tostadas was missing the tostada (no tortillas)! Not sure who else's order was screwed up.\n\nThe food was actually really good, no complaints there. But my big complaint was when the checks came (we had 7 checks) I left to go deal with our transportation at this point... I got back 20 minutes later and checks were still sitting there with our cash/credit cards. As you can imagine our hummer limo waited for an extra 30 minutes for us and I paid about $40 more because of it. Not happy with the service here at Cabo Wabo."

It's a Mexican/Cantina type of restaurant with some great dining options.\n\nAs we approached my birthday, my boyfriend asked where I wanted to have my birthday dinner. Without hesitation I said,\" Cabo Wabo!\"  Lucky for us, they have another Groupon going for $15 for $30 worth of food and drinks!\n\nLast time we went we shared a 3-Choice Fajita. It's a bit pricy for $45 but it is well worth it! Both times we selected the sirloin, chicken and shrimp. Both times they were fantastic!! There is the perfect amount of food for two people where you leave full and satisfied. \n\nDuring our first visit I went with a margarita on the rocks which was soooo yummy!! This time we went with the buck of beer, 5/ $21. It was a bit frustrating when we walked in to the hostess and they have a little bar with a sign for $5 beers but when you go inside to dine, they bump those same beers up to $6-7 each. Not that it's much of a difference, it's more of the principal. I guess they try to get the tourist as they leave the resort with the $5 beer? \n\nMoral of this post: Eat at Cabo Wabo's but get your beer at their bar near the host area."

Our server, Dione, was friendly and fast. Fast service is almost impossible to find on The Strip, so that deserves more credit than maybe it does in other parts of the country. It's also worth noting that the manager came around to check on us, too, which is a nice touch to make sure we were taken care of. The food was better than expected, and the prices are pretty reasonable when compared to the other restaurants in the area. Some of the folks on here complain about the music being too loud, which is funny because I commented while we were eating the volume was perfect for enjoying the music while still being able to hold a conversation. Personally, I think it's a bit silly to complain about music volume when \"cantina\" is in the name and you can hear the music as you're walking in."

Still a bit chilly in the shade, but they had heat lamps. Bonus: there was a decent view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nIt may be a Mexican food chain, but I thought the food was fine. The service was great too. Friendly and attentive. Even though there were vegetarian options on the menu, we stuck to appetizers. The salsa had a smoky flavor, and the guacamole was good. We also shared a cheese crisp, which was similar to a cheese quesadilla. Overall, not the cheapest spot for food and drinks, but it is Vegas after all."

I found them surfing at a cove in Mexico, chased him up a mountain side to the edge of a cliff where he jumped, turned in the air, flipped me off while smiling, pulled a ripcord and base jumped. He cut the cord in the air, tucked and rolled, yelled and took off in an awaiting jeep.\n\nUm... yeah.

VERY Pricey. We ordered Beef Fajita Nachos to start-The Carne Asada Entree & a 3 item combo with Hard & Soft shell tacos and a cheese enchilada. Ice Water all around. NO drinks this time:) \n\n(However they did pour FREE shots of tequila when the band played \"Mas' Tequila\") \n\nThe service was a little slow it took nearly 30 minutes before we saw the appetizers and we spent most of the night chewing on ice. \n\nThe nachos were very underwhelming-10-12 soggy chips covered in cheap shredded cheese and sparse bits of beef fajita meat. 4 melonballer size scoops of (lettuce,pico,sour cream & guac) NO seasoning, no spice, no flavor just cheese. The complimentary chips & salsa are a much better choice. \n\nNEXT, the entrees came out- The carne asada plate covered w/cheese, onions and jalapenos. a couple tortillas and a plate with (lettuce,pico,sour cream & guac). NO salsa!! Again with the cheap shredded cheese and the jalapenos were not even cooked just sliced and covered in cheese. \n\nThe fajita onions & peppers were way too much compared to the skimpy 8oz carne asada steak. The steak like the nachos had NO seasoning or flavor. FOR $20 at a bar I was really expecting something phenomenal. \n\nThe 3 item combo of beef tacos and cheese enchilada was alright except for the cheese enchilada which again used the cheap shredded cheese which didnt melt well at all and was tasteless. \n\n\nThe lack of seasoning for a mexican resataurant is really unacceptable and NO salsa with entrees no beans with the chips appetizer. :( \n\n\nFor 2 people to have an appetizer and 2 entrees-drink ice water and get slow service for $65 pretty disappointing to say the least:("

I happened to notice that they charged me $1.00 more on each of our entrees than the price listed on the menus.  When I talked to the manager about it, he said it wasn't a mistake.  He said that the prices changed, but they didn't have the new menus printed yet.  Apparently he saw absolutely no problem with charging all of his patrons more than what they thought they'd pay.  When I mentioned to him that this is clearly unethical, he just said that he'll make it up to me by giving me $25 off my next meal.  In other words, \"shut up about it, and I'll make it worth your while.\"  I told him I didn't want his coupon, and that he should just do the right thing and either lower his prices to reflect what's on the menu, or tell his patrons about the increase when they order.  I don't think he listened to me.  Just think of the thousands of people who paid more than the menu price.  Can I hear \"Class Action Lawsuit\"?"

I'm more inclined to say that there is a bit of a timing issue with the food/drink preparation as we had some lengthy waits for drinks and for chips (after getting our guacamole). \n\nI can overlook service hiccups at Cabo because the food is DELICIOUS. The chips, salsa, and guacamole alone make this place worth a stop. I also can say only good things about my chicken enchiladas, as can my friend regarding her carne asada tacos. The rice side here is special as it's not just red slop...almost more like a paella sans proteins! \n\nOf note, my Mango Picante margarita was not particularly strong, but it was pretty and tasty."

After passing Cabo Wabo a few times, i thought that this would be an appropriate place to quench my thirst.  There was a slight wait to get into the cantina, but the outdoor elevated patio was worth the wait.  Upon being seated our server told us that they were out of menus, so we just asked for a margarita and a mojito.  We started with some chips and salsa.  The salsa had a really smokey background, but not that much flavour.  Shortly after our drinks came, after taking one sip, we both realized that these were very water downed drinks.  We were both very unsatisfied with the drinks, mine literally tasted like just a lime slushie, no alcohol.  We basically just wrote off the night as a poor restaurant pick, but then our bill came.  My drink was $10 and my sisters was $14, i have never felt so ripped off.  I think that is why Cabo currently has a low Yelp rating, because people are feeling ripped off. \nOverall, i would not come back here, because i believe it is a tourist trap.

Looking at the menu's Cabo offered a great variety and decent 'on the strip\" prices. We went there, not too busy and sat outside. The staff was attentive and courteous and the food was really good!\n\nI had the Machaca Omelete with potatoes and toast and my wife had the French Toast. The omelette was very tasty, and the nice thing it was a perfect size not too small but not crazy large. The French Toast was really good as well, with the flavors on there my wife did not even need syrup, it was sweet and moist enough. She also got a banana nut bread which was good as well.\n \nThis has been one of the highlights of my trip this week, started off Sunday on a positive note."

I found this place for my stay in Las Vegas, on the strip at Cabo Wabo Cantina. Upon arrival, what better way to gear up for a week in sunny Las Vegas that enjoying some great music, in perfect view of the southern portion of the strip, with a Margarita on the rocks with a salted rim. The outside music is played through some really nice sounding, full range sounding speakers and the genre is mainly that of classic rock. \nTwo Margaritas with a caddie and I was off, knowing I would soon return.\nUnlike more hostesses at many dining establishments on the strip, I had come to the unfortunate realization that most are disinterested or too busy gabbing with a coworker. Addressing the party properly and getting them seated promptly in the dining area seems to play second fiddle, these girls did just that.\n\nThe three juice Mojito which is not on the menu, but a quickly thought concoction of pineapple, strawberry and something, the juice was a puree I thought to try something different.\n\nStraight forward menu of traditional Mexican dishes, nothing too dangerous or risky. The Carnitas platter once served looked like a skimpy little nothing plate for one, once we began to dig in the pork showed its density. Seven hand rolled flour tacos later and two people were nicely filled,  if you add in the chips. No up charge for a few additional tortillas. The Macho Salsa will really clear your sinuses as it was the hottest item I had all week and I order everything hot. \n\nGreat service by our server Ron, who kept the drinks coming and did whatever it took to make our wisit to Cabo Wabo an above average dinner experience, he deserves special mention."

Come here so you can sit outside on the large deck, otherwise it's not worth seeking out.\n\nDespite the proudly featured margarita ads and the house tequila being top-shelf Cabo Wabo, they had no drink list, and minimally described only 3 tequila-based drinks (which are available frozen, mentioned first).  They seemed much more interested in selling us beer.\n\nTortilla soup was decently spiced, but a little too salty and a little too thick.\n\nService was attentive to a fault (checking in with us every 5ish minutes).\n\nThe location, however, is quite awesome-- at a major crosswalk, across the street from new Aria, with a view of the booming fountains at Bellagio.  Good for taking in the strip while having a drink, if you sit outside.  They have some gas heaters on the deck for the winter, but this sort doesn't seem to give off much heat.  Doesn't seem like there'd be a view from inside.\n\nI've been to the original Cabo Wabo Cantina in Los Cabos, which has better pricing, drink specials, and much much more atmosphere, if much less of a view."

I ate inside at the bar and the bartender, Nikki, made me a Waborita.  What was special about that, was that it wasn't on the drink menu.  Luckily I was wearing a shirt with the ingredients/recipe on the back.  It was fantastic.  I ordered the split Ceviche and although it looked like small portions, It actually filled me up.  A group of English tourists came in and asked about the Waborita and soon the were drinking them too.  I guess the point is that the bartender was very willing to accommodate a non-menu item in the middle of a busy day.  My guess is that she won't ever forget how to make them.  \n\nThe reason I'm writing this review is because I have been to the Cabo Wabo Cantina in Cabo San Lucas, MX.  I came in expecting a certain vibe and wasn't disappointed.  I wasn't there too long before an authentic Mexican Mariachi band showed up and the place got a little more lively.  All of the servers seemed to be having fun and from my perspective at the bar, the patrons were all having a great time too.  I can't comment on food I didn't eat, but I didn't see anyone complaining or sending items back.  It is a fun place to go if you have some time!"

We were able to sit on the patio rail which is the best dining seat aside from Bubba Gumps Patio seat so far in Vegas.... ( on the Strip I haven't had the pleasure of too many balcony Seat's thus far,  Still to come)  The patio is right across the street from the Belagio hence you get to check out the Water show (which is awesome) every 1/2 hour.  Also it's kinda the heart of the strip so People watching is pretty cool as well.  We were sat and waited on in plenty good time.  Everyone was very nice but quick.  I ordered Queso Fondido Con Chorizo and no alcohol since we don't drink although that part of the place looked like it did exceptionally well.  The Queso was super donkey good.... I loved that more than anything.  I would go back for that alone... even above the Patio Rail seating.  We ordered the Combo 2 (Gulf Shrimp & Grilled Top Sirloin) Fajita's.  They were good not the best but the accoutrements (grilled onions, peppers, cheese, Sour Cream & Such)  were awesome that were with them... The steak was just a tad tough and since the Shrimp while large were Jumbo Gulf Shrimp they were not plentiful however, all the same it was an above average Fajita dish.  All in All after touring the rest of the restaurant (A.K.A visit to the local johns and the Big Red Wall of hanging Photo's of Sammy and Friends) I thought it was an awesome place to eat and hang... I will return and not soon enough most likely.  I will however most likely get Taco's next time since those are my favorite Mex food. Oh, and as to why I gave it 4 Stars instead of 5 the music was very loud and I play and sing rock music (so, that is to say I love loud music) and the music here was super loud almost too much to even hear the sever.   ~Vegas Rob!"

Speaking of which, their tequila flight is reasonably priced (for Vegas) and worth it if you are looking to start your day off on that foot. Service was just ok the first time but the second time I was with a large group and service was excellent. Bathrooms are kinda weird, when you walk in you'll know what I mean. Misters on the patio in the summer which some people love. Not a bad place but not a Vegas destination by any means."

When we arrived I got a great glimpse at the hostess breasts. I am about to eat, WITH my husband now that is just disgusting! She was wearing half of a WHITE tank top, I could see her boobs completely except fro her nipple truly. It was just extremely unpleasant to begin with, at that moment we should have left, but we did not. A male hostess sat us, ignored me the whole time walked to the stable but had a full conversation with my husband, OK. We sat down, our waiter came by 5 minutes later, we asked for water and my husband ordered a Toasted Colada ($14), he said was ok. 75% ice. We also ordered our food, my husband got some Ceviche appetizer and I got Hot & Spicy Wings which I did not know came with a side of potato. The food was good, the service sucked. Besides taking our order, brining us our food, and our check we got NO SERVICE outside from that. Even if the food had been great, it was OK and the drink amazing, it was not. We would still never ever return to this place, and now when we return to Vegas we never will. The service was by far the worst I have ever gotten in Vegas. Super disappointed. The waiter had the audacity to circle the receipt what we should tip her. HAHA, seriously? My Tip was \"Check on your tables\". ! That's the BEST tip I am sure she has ever gotten. Recommend, NO Way! Go somewhere else!"

They sprinkle on cojita cheese which should be mandatory for all nachos.   I had a alcoholic version of an Arnold Palmer which had fresh mint, which was refreshing, along with a new berry based drink which was also great.  The topper was the fried ice cream.  They put a coat of frosted flakes on it, and it was easily one of the best desserts I ever had.\n\nService:  The waitresses/bartenders were friendly, and on top of everything.   Being the strip you would hope app servers had this down.\n\nPrice:  Slightly pricey.  You do pay for the location and name recognition, but certainly not exorbitantly priced.\n\nOverall:  Great experience, excellent drinks, solid service, good food.

My friend and I ordered waters and she got a soda, but the server went on and on about the margaritas for what seemed like a few minutes when we had already established that neither of us was going to be drinking. It was pretty busy but it took quite a while for us to get our water. \n\nMy friend ordered the tortilla soup and when they brought it out there was no spoon, so she politely asked for one. The food runner who brought out the soup and our server kept asking, \"Are you sure it's not on the side of your bowl?\" and frantically looking all over our table as if they've recently had a mass amount of spoon thieves? Weird. \n\nThe price of the food was as expected for being on the Las Vegas Strip. But $9 for some guacamole? Beat it! I should have brought my own avocados.\n\nWhen the check came, Homero had no shame in handing it to us while very bluntly POINTING to the tip section and said, \"Here you go, ladies.

Fortunately/unfortunately, that \"something new\" ended up being Cabo Wabo...which always seemed like more of a drinking spot than as a place to eat at.  Now I know why!\n\nAlthough Cabo Wabo isn't a mainstream type of chain restaurant, it's still pretty much a chain, and the food really reflected that.  I kept expectations to a minimum for my CARNITAS TACOS, and what I got was pretty mediocre...and overpriced.  Two tacos, Spanish rice, and beans for $15?  I know it's The Strip and all, but damn (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#J9PUAWgzOp0UnrzmnXG4bg).  The taste of the carnitas was driven heavily by their generic sauce rather than the savory, seasoned flavors you'd get from something authentic, but at least the tacos were fairly full...so yay?\n\nAs far as our drinks went, my friends seemed mostly satisfied with what they had.  I ordered the CHUPA CHUPA cocktail, which was kind of fun to drink but not particularly amazing.  Essentially, they flip a mini Corona into a regular margarita at your table, and you have to quickly drink it before it all overflows (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#RV-cRSWcsgg5ITs4n6OcAQ).  Creative and unique, but pricey considering it wasn't that heavy on the alcohol.\n \nAmazingly though, what hurt more than overpaying for generic and medicore food was my lack of reception stopping me from checking in on Yelp when we first sat down.  As petty and trivial as that sounds, I would have seen the \"Free margarita with the purchase of an entr\u00e9e\" deal before I ordered, and I could have saved myself $12 on that Chupa Chupa!

So to avoid having constant traffic brushing passed me, I turned to face the pillar. The chicken tostada salad was good. I will say that. My bf burrito looked very pathetic. Came with a handful of scorched tortilla chips. We both tried the \"Can't Drive 55\". It was so sickeningly sweet, we didn't even finish them. We both regret that we didn't power through our hunger until we reached the south end of Las Vegas Blvd., where there are better dining choices. Very disappointing."

The meat fell apart and everything tasted fresh.  My husband also really enjoyed his chicken enchiladas, and the drinks were great.  I will say that the chips and salsa were not what we expected; the salsa is not really a traditional salsa, and tastes very much like chipotle chiles. \n\nThe service was good, though the prices were a bit high (what isn't in Vegas?)

            "review": "CONTEXT: Recently graduated college dudes stop by Cabo Wabo at the tail end of a weekend, because it has the unbeatable combination of queso and 97 televisions.\n\nTHE REVIEW: Jesus Herbert Christ.  We went into this not caring that it had a 2ish star review, and expecting it to be standard sub-par Tex Mex.  What we got were plates of butt vomit, mildly unique from each other, served in convenient thirty minute intervals.\n\nI guess I should mention positive aspects of the experience first.  The hostess was very, very attractive, as were many of the kind, smart, and important ladyfolk on the waitstaff.  We must have been assigned the one legacy bid, but that wasn't much of a big deal (side note - there were about 150 waitresses, all coming from upstairs or the kitchen, at all times.  There were twenty patrons.  Who are you serving?  What the hell is upstairs!?  Irrelevant.  I apologize).  When ordering, the waitress let us know that salsa came with the queso, and it would be a waste of money to order the chips and salsa.  That's groovy, in my book.  She did that once or twice again when we were ordering our meals, and probably saved us about ten dollars by letting us know random things our hangovers weren't allowing us to pick up on by ourselves.  Lastly, there was a TV in every corner, and they were all on the Sunday night NFL game.  No nonsense from ESPN8: The Ocho or garbage political newsfeeds.  Bueno.\n\nThe one reason we stopped here, above all others, was cheese dip.  It is a staple of our recovery rubric.  It is a communion cracker of sorts, after a bingy, gambly wreck of a weekend in Las Vegas.  The queso at Cabo Wabo was of decent consistency, with pico de gallo sprinkled on top.  It never filmed, it wasn't powdered-cheese-turn-queso.  It was physically acceptable.  It tasted, however, like government cheese with a hint of dirt or motor oil from the ungloved hand that had handled it prior to putting it into a bowl and melting it.  Did we eat it?  Shit yes.  Should we have?  I don't know, but it still feels like the demon sauce is painted onto my esophagus.  It came with thick chips that probably would have been tasty, had they been heated or lightly salted before arriving.  The salsa is a thick roasted pepper (chipotle?) salsa that was on the edible side of questionable.\n\nI had been craving fajitas all weekend, mostly because my phone auto-corrected a slur I had written in a text to the word \"fajitas\" on the night of our arrival.  Karma for my ignorant textual intention greeted me fist-to-face when I received my hamburger steak fajitas, which arrived with a fajita sizzlesmell that literally caused people at the table to cough.  If your lungs bark at the smell of a food, you're probably experiencing the triggering of some sort of evolutionary warning system.  I ignored it.  My meatloaf fajita was served very well done, over a bed of 90% onions and 10% red peppers.  The fajita complements were all satisfactory, and by the end of the meal, I was making soft tacos with just the guac, sour cream, refried beans, and shredded cheese.\n\nMy friends ordered the jalapeno chicken burrito thing, the fish tacos, and the kids' menu chicken fingers.  No one liked their food, save for the manchild who ordered from the kids' menu.  I think the chicken fingers would have been difficult to sabotage, though, given the effort in doing so to the other dishes.  Of note - four chicken strips were twelve dollars.  The fish tacos were particularly no good.  It seemed like someone had forgotten to deep fry them, or had intentionally *shrug* *middle finger to no one in particular* *microwave*'d them.\n\nOur bill came out to about 25 dollars a person.  That may be an inaccurate number, though, because I don't know if it garnered interest while we waited for our waitress to pop out of her coma and acknowledge us.  The booth at which we were seated was a backseat pulled from a 1983 Ford Tempo, and our cups of pond water may have had mosquitoes camping out on them.  I can't recall.  Notwithstanding our miserable experience, the $4.00 plastic cup of Coke I ordered was delicious...\n\nOH!  Afterthought!  We were denied outdoor seating, despite the 8-10 empty tables we noticed on the patio.  It was probably for the best, as the daystar would have ruined us worse than Cabo Wabo did on its own.  I wish I had more hands, so I could give Sammy's place four thumbs down.  As a connoisseur of substandard Mexican food, I implore you to avoid this place.  The Megan Fox lookalikes out front are Sirens, I promise."

            "review": "First off I'll be discussing their Margarita bar that faces the mall, and then the actual dining experience.\n\nA friend of mine offered to buy all of us a Margarita. They had the usual sizes, and then some of the ridiculous huge weird ways of drinking. You can get the large long one that you see people walking around or a guitar. Honestly the smallest size they offered was more than enough. It was actually made really well, because usually most places I get them, they taste disgusting. I just had the original flavored one which was great. The person who served us had a well... uhmm huge rack :)\n\nNow as for the food. Our other friend suggested that we try their ridiculous 8lb nacho platter challenge. Only up to 4 people can be involved, with no bathroom breaks, and a 55 minute time limit. If you should complete it, you get the meal for free. Otherwise it's 55 bux. Now I thought... well we just need to each eat 2 lbs, and I have ate 2 lbs of food before. So it's possible.\n\nI was completely wrong. As soon as our waiter dropped it off, I already saw a wall of defeat immediately. It was ridiculously huge and had a ton of sour cream and guacamole. It was delicious to eat for 10 minutes, then the mental breakdown began. Staring at the food did not help, and we ended up quitting after 30 minutes in. We ate a good 70% of it. Now if there wasn't a challenge or hurry, I would have fully (no pun intended) enjoy it. It had shrimp, beef, and chicken in the mix. It was by far one of the best nacho's I have enjoyed.\n\nThings I disliked: The chairs. Some of them or low and some of them are high. They don't give you the best support and are extremely heavy and uncomfortable.\n\nThe service was good, and he would regularly check in and check our status."

Yes, that is the name. Kinda clever and kinda not. The margaritas were decent, decent amount of alcohol, and a decent lime mixer was used. Not too bad for a trendy touristy joint like this.\n\nWe just landed in town and we were looking for munchies, so we got the following appetizers:\n* Lobster Taquitos - I actually like these a lot. A little too much. I would definitely order it again next time.\n* Some Grilled Shrimp in Butter Sauce Dish (forgot the name of it) - This was excellent as well. The only negative was there wasn't more of it on the plate.\n\nOverall, Cabo Wabo Cantina has good food and decent drinks. I can definitely see myself hanging out on the deck outside, getting smashed drinking margaritas, and eating good food. The only negatives to the place is the wait staff can be a little slow at times and our waitress would hide out so it was difficult getting another drink. All things considered, I give Cabo Wabo Catina 4 stars."

When the manager came up to me he seemed shocked that there was hair and repeatedly told me that all his cooks are in hair nets and properly groomed. He then offered me a free drink and asked if I wanted another order of nachos. I said no thank you to the food but I'll take the drink.

Kudos!!!!\n\nDefinite stop if your ever in the Las Vegas strip."

Not the servers mind you the manager.  I reported this to Groupon and got a full refund for the terrible experience.\n\nAnd to top it off the food is not worth the prices, it's good for about half as much money.\n\nI say again DO NOT GO HERE!!!

The place was pretty empty at midnight and we got seated immediately. \n\nThey have a bunch of options for their margaritas. I tried the cocorita which is their coconut flavored margarita on the rocks. I prefer them frozen but this one was surprisingly good!\n\nThey rim the glass with a coat of honey and roasted coconut slivers. It doesn't fall off easily so you need to gnaw it off. It's a great supplement to the drink. \n\nWhen we asked for the check, the waiter was able to split it even though we asked after the fact. Easy and done."

Our service was polite and frequent, Brian was very responsive to our needs which is always good in a large group including a baby. The food was delicious and came out not long after we ordered which is awesome because they were starting to get busy and had a band playing.. Summer the Manager was also polite and attentive.

Additionally, there was literally only one vegetarian option on the whole menu which is surprising for a Mexican joint..where were the cheese enchiladas on the menu?! Anyway, maybe I'm spoiled by good Mexican food in Texas, but cabo wabo needs to step up their game!"

We were typical sightseers and as we were walking down the Strip, we saw the inviting patio of Cabo Wabo and thought that would be a great place to eat lunch. We had a short 5-10 minute wait (extremely great in Vegas) before we were seated under a huge red umbrella by a very friendly staff. Our waitress, Tammy, was the best! She was extremely friendly, helpful, and she did a great job of giving us ideas of what would be good to eat and drink. She was totally on target with the Cabo Rockin' Iced Tea - it may have been the most refreshing drink I've EVER had. She continued to give us ideas of what to order and we probably stayed there and ate and drank longer than we would have because she made our visit so pleasant. Our food was great, service wonderful, fantastic experience. We all highly recommend this place as one of your stops in Vegas!"

I apparently included \"personal attacks\" by naming names at this God awful restaurant. I still, however want to put in my 2 cents about it. \n\nWe had a $60 groupon that was apparently only able to be used by a party of 4 or more. This was written in the tiny print online only-nowhere printed on the groupon. The \"manager\" on duty was an ass. He immediately said he was going up to his office in order to print something out to prove us wrong. He was VERY condescending, attacking and just an all around awful person. The GM, who was not much better, cam down to us and finally agreed to take the $30 off that we paid for the groupon. The waitress was great and. Feel bad that she has to work for these nimrods. She had no clue that there was a per party requirement either, which again speaks to the (lack of) skill of these brilliant managers. \n\nI threw a fit with Groupon and got my money back. The chick on the phone did not sound surprised. Also-there were other tables having similar issues with their Groupons. \n\nRegardless-I'll never ever go back."

The outdoor patio is great but the service was pretty bad and the food was nothing special.  There was a sign by the hostess stand that said pitchers of beer for $15 - a steal in Vegas for sure!  We asked our waiter what beers qualified and he listed off a few decent Mexican beers so we took him up on the offer and ordered a pitcher of Dos XX Lager.  About 5 minutes later he came back and told us they were out of that one so we ordered the Tecate instead.  5 minutes more he came back and said all they had was Coors Light, WTF?? How do you advertise a special and not carry anything that's supposed to be on the special??  Someone must be terrible at ordering product or they just don't give a crap, not sure which.  Our waiter was really nice about it though and he was embarrassed as well so I can't place all of the blame on him.  We decided to go with margaritas and then some bottled Mexican beers to follow and when we got our check, we really wished that $15 beer special would have been available, such a rip off!  The chips and salsa were pretty lame and the taquitos were ok but my friend said her tacos were bad.  Overall, come for the beers specials and that's it...but make sure they're available first!!"

The drinks were very good and strong just like I like it! \n\nI seen people eating but didnt pay to much attention to it since my main mission was to drink and have a good time.\n\nThe next day I woke up and all I could think about was Cabo Wabo! I was trying to find good Groupon deals and spotted Cabo Wabo had a $15 for $30 worth of food. I was like two tears in a bucket, f*** it! We're going to Cabo Wabo!\n\nIt's walking distance from the Caesars Palace. Once I got there we were seated immediately outside near the heaters as it was very cold outside. I liked sitting outside on the patio because your able to see the water show from where your seating and eating. \n\nThe nice attractive server Stephanie asked us if we wanted to start off with a beverage and i instantly said margarita please! ;). Dont forget to check in to get your free margarita! \n\nEverything on the menu looked good especially after looking at the pictures on Yelp. I ordered the appetizer of chips and salsa which was not expensive at all $3.95 you can not beat that especially for the amount that you get!\n\nFor my entree, I decided on the shrimp tacos and double rice since I'm not into the beans. I was very hesitant in ordering the chicken enchiladas because it looked very good as well but after talking to the server Stephanie she let me know that the shrimp tacos was a better choice. \n\nBabe ordered a burrito which came with nacho chips on the side which were very good! The cheese that they use for their nachos were a plus!\n\nI also liked that the drinks were very strong and tasty! They know exactly what to do to get you to buy more than one lol.\n\n I would definitely recommend this if you're in the area of the miracle mile shop and looking for something to eat. They had many different things on their menu with a lot of good varieties you will not be disappointed!"

I didn't bother to check Yelp because I assumed that all expensive restaurants on the Strip are equally good.  The bottom line here is that while the food is good, I'm not quite sure it's worth the price even with the Strip mark-up.  We split a margarita pitcher for $36, which was very tasty, although again I felt it was a little pricy. \n\nThe chips and salsa are AMAZING.  They're cut thicker than regular tortilla chips and fried perfectly.  The salsa has a wonderful tang.  You should definitely pass on the guacamole, as it doesn't have nearly enough lime or cilantro and is bland.\n\nI got the chicken burrito enchilada-style, aka covered in cheese.  It was tasty if slightly bland.  I'd recommend it as one of the cheaper things on the menu at around $16.  My brother got the fish tacos, which he said were amazing but wasn't able to finish because he ate so many chips.\n\nService was good, not super attentive but not bad as others have mentioned.  I sat outside and it was thunderously loud but that's the strip for you.  The waitresses appeared to be having fun and dancing to the music.  Overall it was a nice ambience, overlooking the strip with a direct view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\nBottom line: I'd recommend this place for the food but for the price point you could probably find better or more interesting food of another genre elsewhere on the strip."

We popped in around 12:30 PM, and it was already a difficulty just to find someone to seat us. There was no waitress around to seat us, so the hostess had us wait at the podium for a few minutes, and then she finally sat us herself. At this point, it was no biggie.\n\nWe sat down, and a waitress came up and took our drink order pretty quick...very friendly girl. She brought us some chips and salsa, which were pretty good.\n\nI ordered the 4-item combo plate with a Carne Asada soft taco, a Chicken soft taco, a beef enchilada, and a chicken enchilada ($19) . Dad ordered Chicken nachos ($13). Let me just say, this is HIGHLY overpriced food. \n\nThe food was brought out, and we marvelled at how little was actually on our plates. Dad's nachos consisted of eight chips with chicken and cheese centered around a scoop of guacamole. To make matters worse, they were extremely bland.\n\nMy food was more of the same disappointment. I had asked for my soft tacos with just meat and cheese only, and they were PILED with stuff. When I finally wiped everything off, the meat didn't even taste great at all. It was all extremely bland. The rice was okay, but the enchiladas were HORRIFIC. I've never tasted worse green sauce in my entire life.\n\nThroughout the meal, there was this annoying bus boy who hovered around our table. Whenever we would pause in eating, he would run up to our table and ask if he could take our plate. He did this three or four times, and every time he seemed to get cockier. Let us eat our mediocre food in peace!!\n\nAfter all was said and done, I'm glad we had a Groupon...though I wished I hadn't even spent the time eating there. Avoid!"

They also had a decent Pinot Grigio available vs. their 2 chardonnays which I won't touch ever - so that was the saving grace for me. It is odd that they offer you a 9 oz or a 6 oz pour and literally measure it right in front of you - I am sure this is management's orders, but not so customer friendly.
