            "review": "On a Wednesday evening, we had 2 AYCE dinners for ~60. \n\n- Accommodative. They changed the channel for the olympics for us :)\n- Get the oysters. small but packed with flavor. beware! rocks with the oysters? too fresh :/. LOL\n- Calamari was a bit too oily. no flavor\n- Get the baked green mussels. they even cut it in half for you :)\n- big pieces of yellow tail and salmon for the nigiri :)\n- The monster roll is deceiving. it's not all soft shell crab. sad that they only use the legs. Ends are shrimp tempura.  \n- LOVED the salmon skin roll. more skin than salmon means more crunchy :)\n- the NYI roll barely has soft shell crab. even smaller legs!!! :(\n- Nuclear roll had a bit too much cream cheese. :/\n- Yellow tail trio was a bit too tangy. small pieces of yellow tail\n- you only get ONE DESSERT! FAIL...\n- Mango mochi was average. they put a toothpick in it with the plastic on. LOL\n- Parfait was delicious. but needs more granola. i think the berries and strawberry pieces are frozen.\n- Although it may sound picky, overall it was pretty delicious or OISHI :)"

            "review": "Went in with my girl for lunch and had a HORRIBLE dining experience.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for over 7 years and it has been awhile since I had such horrible service/food.  \n\nWhen we walked in, there was no host/hostess to greet/seat us.  After waiting for 2 minutes, we decided to seat ourselves at the sushi bar.  The restaurant was not packed but had a decent lunch crowd for a sunday.  Numerous servers passed by us and pretty much ignored us.  On top of that, there were 4 sushi chefs behind the counter who did not acknowledge us at all.  Probably after 5 minutes, the manager came by and asked us if we would like something to drink.  It took him probably at least another 5 minutes to grab us our waters.  After placing our order with him, it took another 15-20 minutes to get any of the sushi we ordered.  Talking from a server perspective, how hard is it to make sushi??? There is no cooking involved!  When we finally got our order, I was very disappointed.  The quality of the fish is very subpar and the portions are very small for the price. \n\nAll in all, the restaurant itself is nice and has a nice ambiance, but the customer service quality of the servers and sushi chefs are waaaaayy below average.  I would not recommend going here!!"

            "review": "Thanks Neal V-G for recommending this place!! Great place to eat before a bachelor party.\n\n5 Star rating for sure, here's why:\nCame here after a 3 hour trip from Los Angeles. Arrived around 4pm, with a group of 12. Was seated promptly in the back private room. Drinks were served quickly, left us with a large jug of ice water= awesome. Waiter was very polite and patient with our large group of guys. We all ordered different rolls and shared them. Each roll was delicious. Presentation, taste and size of content to each roll was perfect. I remember getting the Rattle snake, Heart attack, Lobster fare,  shrimp tempura, miso soup, fried scallops, warm saki and calamari. Absolutely no complaints of any item ordered.  Best, made to eat, all you can eat eat (AYCE) sushi joint ever. \n\nCaution: Do not over order!! Take your time and enjoy each item is my advice. After your first roll you will want to go berzerk and order everything on the menu, trust me just enjoy and order what you can finish. You may feel pressured by the two hour time limit, but don't worry you will have plenty of time and the food is served pretty quickly."

            "review": "Competition in the Las Vegas AYCE (All You Can Eat) scene is fierce, one of the most recent causalities is Sushi On Rainbow on the Westside of Chinatown.  It's somewhat hard to standout in such a crowded field.  Generally, I like to categorize them in which part of town they are in.\n\nOne of my \"must go\" places have been added in the Southwest section in Las Vegas.\n\nOyshi Sushi won't have the premium quality sushi, expect the fish to be previously frozen but still is not bad, the rice to fish ratio is more fish than rice, the rolls are not too over sauced, the salmon roe and flying fish eggs to be plentiful.\n\nCustomer service is excellent and attentive, they will stop by frequently to check if you want more orders.  Several notes:\n\nThey charge for green tea, so don't be surprised to tacked on a few more dollars for this.  The prices are in line with other AYCE restaurants, just a few dollars above $20 for lunch and around $26 for dinner.  Pass on the green tea creme brulee and green tea ice cream, barely any hints of green tea at all."

Sitting at the bar is fine, but a couple of times finding your waiter\\waitress when you're sitting at a table is ridiculous.\n\nWith that said, AYCE sushi is not as amazing as \"regular\" sushi places (i.e. Sushi Fever, I love Sushi, Sushi Loca, etc) but Oyshi is always consistent when it comes to quality and quantity. Definitely worth a trip if you're looking for good AYCE sushi."

            "review": "Ever since I can remember, Sushi-Mon (the one on silverado ranch/maryland pkwy) has been my favorite go-to spot. Words couldn't describe how good it is. But I decided to try something new. This place had 270 reviews with an average of four stars. So they must be doing something right.\n\nAfter one minute of walking the wrong way..we finally got into the entrance..by Following THE ARROWS...\n\nDecor was really nice, bigger than the usual sushi bars. Great Location too. The VIP room and Lounge room was a nice touch. It was slow mind you, during lunch when I walked in with my \"friend\" Karlee. We started off with, my favorite Ahi Poke and Miso Soup. Karlee had the soup as well and Gyoza. Ahi Poke was ok, but not better than sushi mon, the flavor wasn't just there. Miso was good, not fantastic. Karlee loved the Gyoza, she said it was better than the other Sushi place she goes that serves it. \n\nI had the J&b roll, baked, with salmon and cream cheese. It was good, juicy, hand a hint of soy sauce. hats off to the sushi chef because it was awesome. I had a cucumber roll, asian strip steak and this deep fried california roll, with hot mustard and albacore tuna. All was great but the J&b roll was the highlight. karlee had 2 orders of the shrimp tempura roll, apparently it was good, I couldn't have any because I am allergic to shrimp. She tried to Force Feed it to me, knowing I was allergic, I think she tried to kill me, because I tried to make fun of her Sirarcha/Hot mayo sauce that she custom made..oh and She had chicken teriyaki and I think another order of Gyoza, apparently she loves that stuff.\n\n The service was a little slow, especially when they weren't busy. This was all you can eat, and what I was shocked about how they did not serve Half rolls!! I was like WTF? how could I possibly try more than 3 types. Other than that The waitress seemed puzzled and brought us the wrong dishes a couple of times. No big deal. The Food was great, service was so-so, and It is a place I would come back to again. I also ate too much, because I regret not getting desert (no one really gets more than one desert, but why would they limit you to JUST one, its all you can eat!!!), being that it was one of the reasons I came here for, Green Tea Tiramisu, I'm Coming back for you!"

I especially love a good late night happy hour, but here it's only with the sake, not the food. \nGreat service, the chefs were really friendly and always checking to make sure if we needed anything. But the food (in terms of good sushi and authentic Japanese) was mediocre. It's one of those Americanized places where spicy tuna, fried California roll, and yum yum sauce are dominant on the menu and where most of the cut rolls taste the same because its all different variations of the same ingredients. I ordered their white tuna sushi and sunomono salad as well. White tuna was decent and sunomono was something errr else...cucumber was shredded thin, not sliced thin and they put a sesame peanut sauce on it instead of the usual rice vinegar. Let's just say I didn't finish it and I'm one not to waste food unless it's truly unappetizing."

The salmon sushi is just about the closest thing to edible heaven.\n\nThe venue is open and airy. The music is upbeat (don't expect some slow, romantic songs).

It's my first time just now because I had heard bad things about it a long time ago (quality of fish mostly). \n\nThere's nothing special, in my opinion, but my friend wanted to come to try one of their desserts (IKR?). \n\nThey only allow you to pick one dessert item (not including unlimited ice cream, though). Another friend stated when they came before they didn't have this restriction. Well, looks like it was just mochi ice cream for me then, which comes only in strawberry, by the way. \n\nThey have some daily specials so check out that list on the way to your table. Fish wasn't as shabby as anticipated so that was a plus. I love salmon nigiri but theirs wasn't too good, actually. So I definitely ate less than usual in that department. \n\nIn terms of hot tea, they charge you $2.50 for the pot at the table so I'm thankful it wasn't $2.50 per person :). \n\nOverall, it's pretty much a just as expected / average place for me. In this area, it's not my to-go place for ayce sushi but hey, this visit just means I won't say no if another friend wants to eat here. :0)"

Fish was always fresh and service was always good, but ever since they got popular, everything has down-graded. \n\nI tried to give them second chances because I used to love this place so much! But lately, their customer service has been way too slow. I get that they're busy, which IMO they need to hire more staffs. My last visit, it took them at least 10 mins to realize that we were standing there waiting to be seated. Then, it took 30 mins for the server to bring us water and miso soup. The owner walks by and doesn't acknowledge us at all. You've got to be fast and efficient, especially a busy place like this, you've got to have more staffs. I will never come back again, even if it's a block away from my house. \n\nDespite my horrible experience, I still love their Love Affair roll, it's the only roll that doesn't fail to satisfy me."

Some of the sushi have options of preparing. ie. you can have your albacore regular, seared, seared with garlic, etc. Same goes for the salmon and yellowtail and a few other fish on the menu. \n\nI really like the yakitori, baked mussels, sushi options and desserts. \n\nThis location is way off the strip.

Bigger than most, this place is usually busy at night but very chill during earlier hours like  most places.  But when it's busy, it's really busy which leads to service sucking!  But overall the atmosphere inside is pretty good and seats up large group of people which is good for birthday dinners or just a bunch of friends coming from out of town.\n\nAll you can eat I believe was $25 for dinner.  I'm just gonna point out what I like and usually order. Baked mussels, dynamite roll, volcano roll, nigiri is not as tasty here, oysters are the best I've had in Vegas but unfortunately only 4 per person so get your friends to order it as well even if they don't eat it so you can have it, surf and turf (highly recommended), and for dessert the fruit parfait. \n\nThis is not a quiet place for dinner so bad idea for a date if you plan on having a meal with a quiet conversation.  People come here often with their kids and big groups of people, which shouldn't surprise you are very loud.  This place is a hit or miss but fortunately I'm patient when it comes to bad service when it's excusable because of how busy this place can be at times."

Unfortunately nothing really stood out for me or remember wow factor so took longer time too come back. Nowadays in Vegas AYCE sushi is so competitive and dime dozen that it really hard too stand out unless really good. My opinion the sushi is good but not great or definitely no Wow factor for me. The menu has a nice diversity too it between the appetizers (oyster on the half shell by far my favorite), nigiri, and speciality rolls (i had some kind of spicy tuna roll; sorry forget the name but was really good)  too choose from sure find something like. Whenever I go AYCE more all about the nigiri style because feel that the true barometer of quality of the fish. I felt like compare too other places especially my top spot sushi house goyemon not in the same class. The irony was originally went too sushi hour goyemon but the wait was ridiculous. Me and Roy was hunger so decided too check out something new. Thankfully on this night Oyshi Sushi not packed went right in and sat down went sushi crazy!! \n\nThe restaurant is lot more open then most AYCE so usually not lot of waiting too sit down. They do have private rooms for big parties. Not sure if charge extra but nice option too know if party of eight or more. The sushi bar is decent size with two too three sushi chefs going at time. Most part even on say that night half packed we were getting our sushi in timely manner. The server was great keep up on everything and even nice enough towards the end we ordered one too many speciality rolls (thanks Roy) she like no worries no forcing not going too charge us for waste! Think that was really cool! \n\nI like that the restaurant is open because you can have conversations without screaming with other person sitting next or across from you. Oyshi Sushi is place that come back too again but with so many other ones and not that high on my list. Not sure when next time will be but if in the area and out of options good choice."

The only bad thing about this place is the sushi takes 30 to 40 minutes to come out. I ended up staying here for 2 and half hours because the food took so long to come out. I would rather go to other location which gives better service and food. \n\nThey had already did auto gratuity which I don't mind but they could at least did a better job on taking care of us."

All time favorite side dish has to be surf and terf which consist of fried steak and shrimp handed it to you still sizzling! One of the best sushi rolls is the love affair because tt has some lobster in it ;). \n\nTheir alcohol prices are reasonable for the portions they serve you. It can be slow at times when its busy, but definitely worth the wait. Every time i go they, it seems like i'm in a club since they play house or clubbing music lol. A great place to go but not in a large group. \n\nGreat place overall :-(D"

The service was WAY off, although the food was still excellent. They recently opened a new location on Sahara, so I'm hoping that this was just a matter of a bunch of trainees not knowing what they were doing (everyone looked new and got orders wrong, not providing place settings until after food was already served, not knowing which tables ordered what food, etc.).\n\nHere's hoping that's all it was.

Now like all the all you can eat places in Vegas you can order sashimi but only as sushi and they make you eat everything.  Still at 25 dollars a person and 20 for kids it was well worth what we paid.\n\nIf there was one negative it was that at such a small place they still added 18% gratuity onto the bill. I would have tipped much more than that if they didn't add it.\n\nWe really loved the Lobster Fair and the Las Vegas Roll. Especially the Las Vegas since it didn't have any rice.\n\nI do think that the staff needs better training. Although they were sweet and charming they did mess up a couple of times on the order.

WTF??? i ordered my dessert paid my check, gave them a 20% tip for the food and promise i will never come back even if it was for free. \n\ni was hoping this was going to be a great experience because once i tasted the food, i fell in love with the freshness. nonetheless, i am loyal customer anywhere i step foot in and it would have been sooo convenient. no matter how great the food, if you don't have customer satisfaction, you will never have them coming back!"

The sushi is big enough for you to actually taste it, but at a size where you don't get full quickly. My staples at any AYCE sushi joints are eel and avocado handrolls and nigiri. I'm not a big fan of rolls and this place does it for me. They also have additional appetizers that you won't find at typical sushi restaurants. I really like their seaweed salad, which is quite the generous portion. Seaweed salad is expensive and this place does not skimp out. The albacore is especially good at this restaurant. They have these sizzling plates which comes out on fajita wooden plates. I have tried the surf and turf which is really delicious. I would recommend getting one to share with a few friends. The appetizer portions are small, but they do fill you up. Try sharing the appetizers so you can save room for the real stuff. With this said, the best part truly is the dessert. This place by far has the best tasting Creme Brulee I have ever had. The only bad thing is that dessert is not all you can eat, it's only one per person. Make sure you leave room for dessert because you do not want to miss out. I have been here twice and will definitely come back the next time I'm in town. The service has been great during both of my visits. The food is usually out at the right time and you never have to wait too long for your orders. The waiters are also really sweet.

(They close at 2am) We were told they were closing early because they were slow and they took last call at 12:45am. I questioned the guy and mentioned that their hours say 2am. My friends drove 45 minutes specifically to go to Oyshi! He said they decided to close early and we couldn't eat. I even mentioned that we knew exactly what we wanted, since their \"last call\" was 5 minutes earlier. He was not very friendly! \n\nDuring the time we were standing outside deciding where to go, more people came and got very upset. That's at least 9 people they turned away! If your hours are until 2am, you should be open until 2am. From what I saw, they lost enough business to make it worth being open until the normal time. Next time we are going to eat, Oyshi will not even be an option unless it's early in the evening. When businesses aren't reliable, you're not gonna go out of your way to visit! Or tell others to visit at all! My review went from 5 stars down to 2. This isn't the first issue I've had at this location! Customer service is everything. \n\nAs far as the food...\n\nMy friend told me about this place and their All You Can Eat sushi but I wasn't too sure about going because I only like one kind of roll. When we decided to go, I asked her if they had a regular menu because I wouldn't be able to eat that much sushi to justify All You Can Eat. When we arrived I was shocked that their all you can eat menu included appetizers, sushi, and dessert! This was perfect!\n\nMy friend and I both ordered the Love Affair roll which is shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes and masago on top. (no eel sauce for me) It was delicious!!! We also ordered....\n\nGyoza- nothing special but yummy!\n\nSurf & Turf Platter- all the platters are small, so you can easily order two. The steak is pretty good and the shrimp was amazing. (I am very picky when it comes to shrimp)\n\nEbi- the best I've ever had. \n\nTeriyaki chicken- yummy\n\nI absolutely love this place!

Then came a group of 11 who came and were seated right away. I don't know if they had reservation but we just felt ignored the whole time. So I asked the receptionist that why is it taking too long? And she said that we are a big group blah blah blah. My dad was really upset and confronted the manager and the manager \"Kevin\" said if you continue to complain then the more you are going to wait. That made me really furious because nobody should disrespect anyone no matter what. So I told him to cancel it and the manager said \"Good!\" \n\nI don't know if this manager had restaurant etiquette but even if people had high praise about your food but the service sucks it doesn't make you of a good place! I'm not sure if he owns the place but if there is a bigger boss he should not be working in a restaurant since he doesn't respect the customers and honestly we felt discriminated. \n\nI've never felt so bad like this because it involved my family and it was suppose to be a nice dinner to wrap up our vacation in Vegas.

This is gonna get ugly fast, real fast. We get there and it's packed. A nice waiter greeted us and told us it might be a while. 20 minutes. Shit, thats it? His reaction made it seem like an hour or 2. Dude! We'll wait. \n\nThe restaurant is nicely designed with modern furnishings. Its set to look very relaxing like a lounge. Like Gerald S pointed out, it's not set up well if there's large groups. The good side is that it doesn't feel overcrowded. \n\nThe AYCE is probably the best and only way to go here. There are so many items to choose from and the quality was not as bad as I thought it would be. They do limit the expensive stuff like uni, amaebi, and raw oysters, but it was well worth it. The sushi was very well made and fresh. Their sushi cuts are very generous. They hardly give any rice, so it was perfect. Everything was awesome, from the salmon, tempura, ribeye, and unlimited green tea or vanilla ice cream!!! \n\nLike hawks, we swooped down and attacked everything. Nothing was safe. We washed it all down with hot house sake ($7). For $25, I would do it over, and over, and over, and over, *deep breath*, and over again. The food came out slow, it was expected because they  had a full house. The service was simply awesome. If it's a Friday or Saturday, give them a call to make reservations. We left hurting and sat in our car like beached whales. \n\nYou may have defeated us Oyshi, but we'll be back. Back with bigger and hungrier guys. *waives fist*"

            "review": "This place was initially introduced and highly recommended to us by a friendly bartender from the Silverton Casino.  He informed us that this place was a spin-off of Sushi Factory (in Las Vegas).  It's a bit out of the way from \"The Strip\", but if you have the time it's well worth it.  Anyway, after a horrible experience at Sushi Factory (see my review) several months ago, my buddies and I decided to give Oyshi a go.  We couldn't have been any happier with our visit to Oyshi.  Our server (Justin) was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  As for the food, the sashimi was fresh, the rolls were tasty, the ambiance was comfortable, simple and modern.  By the way, the Ama ebi (sweet shrimp) and Uni (sea urchin) were both very fresh and delicious.  However, I was bummed that each customer was limited to one order of Ama ebi and Uni per customer.  But being that both are very expensive items, one can understand.  If you're looking for a great, affordable sushi dinner in the Las Vegas area, look no further than Oyshi.  I hope they keep up the good service, and not falter like that of Sushi Factory."

My favorite appetizer is the surf and turf.  My favorite rolls consist of the Red Rock, Volcano, and Rainbow.  You can order half portions here, so that way you can choose to sample several rolls, or just stick to a couple full rolls.  There is almost always a wait, but it's well worth it.  The staff is super friendly and I have never dealt with poor customer service any of the times I have dined there.  The couple times I have sat at the bar have been great experiences too - the chefs are all nice.\n\nIt's in a great location, but I have driven past it a couple times without realizing it. Really, I have nothing but positive things to say!"

We have given this place multiple chances thinking something would change, but it just keeps getting worse. Unless you speak the language there, they don't care about your service. It's so frustrating to be sitting there for 30min, with nothing but a drink, and seeing so many others (who even come in after you) get served their food. Never again is this place worth our time or money. Definitely DO NOT recommend Oyshi if you're looking for good food or even relatively descent service"

Some of my favorite items are the Love Affair and Japanese Lasagna rolls as well as the beef wrapped asparagus and sizzling ribeye. The quality and creativity of their menu items deserves praise. For example, the cucumber salad isn't the typical you would get at another sushi spot, they have a peanuty sauce laid on top that really individualizes it from the standard version of the dish. All that being said, I still would not say that dinner there should be several dollars higher than other ayce sushi places. \n\nFirst of all, the service at Oyshi stinks, to put it plainly. Don't get me wrong, the staff is pleasant and at times can even be friendly. However, the food just comes out way too slowly. Other sushi restaurants really leave Oyshi crying in the dust when it comes to this. On top of that, they definitely pull the \"always filling up your drink\" technique to get us full. This just doesn't give your party a lot of room to appreciate all of the items they offer simply because your appetite duration can only hold out for so long.\n\nSecondly, the dessert choices are outstanding, BUT you are limited to one special dessert! Their desserts are the best I've seen so far at a sushi place, but oh my goodness, for $26 dinners, I personally think we should be allowed to try them all one time each, at the very least! I am in love with the green tea tiramisu and the green tea cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The fruit parfait is also very tasty, anything but disappointing.\n\nFor these reasons, I award Oyshi three stars. Their food makes them a great establishment, but I strongly feel they need cater better to the customers."

The fish is very fresh and flavorful, except the oysters, which I thought were a little bland.  Lately we've had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated, so this place is definitely gaining in popularity.  The menu has changed somewhat in the past year and now they have more appetizers and dessert, which is definitely a plus!  However you can only order one of the special desserts but you can have all the ice cream you want.  The rolls are solid and the uni has been fresh every time we've visited."

Like I said we have been here quite a few times and the service was never amongst the best but this night was especially unfortunate. The service was extremly slow, it took about 30 minutes to get our second round of sushi and we had to keep asking our runner/busser to find our server.

If there's an AYCE option at a sushi restaurant, I always order it because the price equals 2-3 specialty rolls. It just doesn't make sense any other way. Besides specialty rolls, I like hand rolls (tuna, salmon, yellowtail) and certain appetizers depending on my mood. I wasn't impressed with their hand rolls and although their specialty rolls are good, they're not amazing either (I've had better counterparts at other AYCE restaurants). I really like their DOUBLE SCREAMING ROLL (without cream cheese) because the special sauce makes it unique. Their desserts are really good too. I like that they offer a PARFAIT that features ice cream, fresh assorted berries, and granola. Very good. On my most recent trip, I found out I could get Green Tea ice cream rather than Vanilla and it was even more amazing. The service is good and the food is usually quick. The only thing I really hate is the restaurant's lack of appropriate venting, so you end up leaving the place smelling like the inside of a fryer."

I thought about it, but then then it might backfire and the place closes down. Therefore...\n\nYes, I am a big fan. I'm not the biggest sushi lover as some people are, but when it's good, it's good. I do believe I've had a wide enough sample of restaurants to know the difference. This place is definitely a place I would recommend. \n\nThe place is cool, kind of a drive from the strip, middle of nowhere strip mall with tumble weed crossings, inside is not TOO fancy, and not TOO much the other kind. But really you don't need to care much, as long as it's clean.\n\nThe place is all you can eat, not all you can pay for. More like... You can eat all, for one set price (within two hours). Three of the four pages of the menu are all included for that price. And let me tell you, they had every roll I've ever seen or heard of along with many many more that I haven't. But there are also all the wonderful appetizers like the Rib Eye and Shrimp called \"Surf and Turf\" tucked all the way on the last page at the very end. Ya we ordered about 8 of those. That alone, would probably be worth the price. \n\nBetween the seven of us we ordered more sushi than I could ever imagine. But it wasn't so much about the quantity but the quality was just as impressive. Of the different rolls I did try. I had, not one complaint. They were as good as I've had at any other Sushi restaurant. I'd go into the names and ingredients of the rolls but if you love sushi, and even if you don't just imagine the ones you like and it's probably on the menu.\n\nService was pretty good considering how many people were eating all you can eat sushi in the restaurant. I really did expect the sushi to come out one every half hour. But I didn't even notice any wait between drinks, appetizers, sushi, more sushi, more appetizers and finally dessert. In fact, upon ordering an extra Miso soup, It seemed like it got to the table before I finished ordering it. They were that fast.\n\nEating good food releases endorphins in your brain. A good sign that you just had a good meal with good friends is how much everyone is laughing at the end. And there was plenty of that to be had for everyone. The only reason Its not 5 stars, is because I've had some really good Sushi, but I can't order it here because it's usually a Chef Special at the other places.\n\nBy the way, this place sucks."

The sign \"All You Can Eat\" really lured us in. As we walked in, we immediately noticed the decor and thought it was so modern and clean. The place looked very inviting and the hip \"ultra lounge\" type music was cool, too. We sat at the sushi bar and opted for the all you can eat for $26 each. The menu had several good choices and all the food items, excluding sashimi, was included on the all you can eat. The quality and portions were pretty good too. We made sure we got our money's worth..and we did!  And they serve redbean ice cream as one of the dessert options. I would totally recommend this place if you want to try a new sushi restaurant in the Southwest part of Las Vegas. Great date night place, hint..hint to all you guys wanting to impress a girl."

I was shocked at how much the service has changed since we last came. The hubby and I came for ayce dinner and were seated right away since we came at a good time. That was about all that was good about our time there. After being seated the waiter took our drink order and brought us our drinks. We then placed our order for 3 sushi rolls. 30 min later we left without getting any of the rolls. This is why. The table across from us who came in about 10 min received a ton of food both sushi and cooked food from the kitchen promptly after ordering while we received nothing. Our waiter kept on telling us our food was coming over and over again but NOTHING EVER CAME!! Sad really! Never coming back to this location again and DO NOT recommend this place at all!! Service is horrible and can not even tell you if the food here is still good. Really wish I could just give this location no stars!"

Much better than other AYCE (all-you-can-eat) places in town. Though I do argue with my friend about what's better between Oyshi and Sushi-mon so I'd call it a coin flip.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give Oyshi 5 starts is because of the service. Every once in a while you'll find yourself wanting to order sushi for 10 minutes or more because you haven't seen your server. Simple solution for this is to sit at the sushi bar. Nothing I would knock it down to 3 stars for because overall is still great sushi and a good experience!"

When I first discovered this place, I was so enamored by their flavor and service, that I told every single person looking for a good place to eat, local or tourist, that they HAVE to go to Oyshi Sushi and get AYCE!\n\nI'm a big fan of nigiri and I highly recommend their nigiri because the ratio of fish to rice is 80-20. The fish they use is very fresh and they use a huge slice! OMG! My top list of nigiri: Cajun albacore, salmon, and eel! Have to have it every time.  Also highly recommended: Love Affair, Salmon Lover, Sunrise, and Red Dragon.  Their appetizers are awesome as well, but the ones that stick out the most that some sushi bars don't have are: Surf & Turf, Potato Croquette, grilled beef asparagus, and the Unagi (eel) bowl! Mmmmm!\n\nThey also do dinner reservations if you have a large party coming. They have VIP rooms that can accommodate large parties if you call ahead.  I've sat in their VIP rooms and their chairs are extra comfortable. The dining area near the entrance has a huge mural that gives this place it's feel and vibe. If you speak to the sushi chefs, they're pretty funny too! And if you're cool with waiting a little bit to be seated, get your Oyshi on!"

Market price on sushi can add up so this all you can eat deal is the best deal you can get so I would suggest not getting ala carte if you're a big eater on sushi. Two rolls will already set you above the all you can eat price so you might as well get the AYCE deal! I've tried several of their signature rolls such as Oh my heart, Pink lady roll, Dynamite roll and Rock & Roll. All good! Be sure you don't order with you eyes because there's a policy that you have to eat everything. Always best when shared with others, don't all order the same thing. Try a little bit of everything. I always make my money's worth it with orders of shrimp tempura. It's a must whenever I come here. You also get a free dessert with your meal as well. I love the creme brulee, soooo delish!

The Gyoza n shrimp tempura were good bc you can't mess up fried stuff. The ribeye app was tasteless n not even sizzling when it came out. The sushi was sooo disappointing. Not fresh at all.....The sushi rice was obviously pre-made (main inside rolls w/ the crab n sushi rice that comes under the fish) meaning that they mass produce the main parts of the sushi- refrigerate it and then just added the fish and toppings after the fact. The rice was sooo cold that when you were eating it, it felt like you were eating ice cream with warm sushi toppings. I know this place is busy but when a place moves in that direction to get people in n out not good;( \nVery sad that this restaurant is cutting corners like that, especially with sushi.

There was quite a line of people but we got seated within 20 minutes, which was great.\n\nFirst of all, walking inside the restaurant, there was a strong scent of frying oil. I assume the ventilation inside is not strong enough. I've been to KFC and Popeyes without smelling that much oil frying.\n\nWe told the hostess our party had 4 people, when she walked us to the table, she took away a setting and set the table for 3, I didn't understand why she did that. So we asked a server to get us another setting, I'm not sure if he didn't hear us or if he was confused because we had to point out what a \"table setting\" was before he went to get it.\n\nWe didn't do the AYCE, just a few menu items:\nUnagi & Avocado Roll:\nThe sushi roll was made badly, the rice was falling apart and there was a lot of avocado, barely any eel and smothered in way too much sauce.\nDonburi:\nDonburi is a combo of thin sliced beef (that is NOT all lean meat), egg, onions over rice with sauce in it. The one we got was dry, barely any sauce until you hit way bottom. The beef used was all lean and definitely not thinly sliced.\nKids Popcorn Chicken & Teriyaki Chicken meals:\nThe popcorn chicken was overcooked. They definitely fried it for too long. It was dry and some pieces had a burnt taste. My son ate a few pieces and said he didn't like it. The Teriyaki chicken was also overcooked. The chicken was hard to chew.\n\nService:\nWe saw a lot of servers walking around, but it didn't look like they were doing anything productive. Only the manager (we assume, he was well dressed not in server type uniform) came by multiple times to see if our table was doing OK. Otherwise, the server would come by drop off food and disappear before we can even ask for anything.\n\nMaybe, we'll give it another try in the future, but for now, it was not the dinner we expected to have."

One server came in and told me that he would clear out the dirty dishes before coming out with the cake which he didn't do. I had to get up and ask for extra dishes and forks from the hostess desk. They brought out the cake without lighting the candles that were provided and the cake still in the box. The food quality was not very good.

Kind of funny as It felt we were sat at the table with no server or porter assigned to it.  I ordered miso soup 3 times before it finally came out.  Our water and drinks were never refilled.  Sushi took too long and they just mediocre.  It was just one thing after another making it a very unpleasant dining experience.  \n\nOnly thing i have positive to say about this place is that eel sauce is extra sweet without the heaviness and they offer dessert you normally wont see at other AYCE: green tea tiramasu and creme brulee. \n\nMy friends and I just finished eating sushi here since one of them recently reside in the area and he'd mention that we should have gone to Koji sushi just down the street instead.

Mixed in with the diced crab stick, it is difficult to taste the natural sweetness of the lobster. I am not a huge mayo fan either, but did not dislike any of the dishes because of it. The fact that it was not mixed with half a jar made it bearable.\n\nThe rice is the most important part of the sushi. Even though we were there early, the rice was cooked off early enough to let it properly cool. There is nothing worse than warm fish and rice that falls apart when picked up. \n\nThe nigiri list is smaller than some of the other sushi joints, but the items we got were all fresh."

I don't quite remember what I had the first time coming into this restaurant, but I do remember having their blueberry parfait, and that alone deserved 5 stars! My second visit to Oyshi was for dinner, and I ordered the Ahi poki salad, the Love Affair sushi roll, and a parfait of course! The salad and the sushi roll were excellent, the best part was probably the Love Affair sushi roll.. probably the best roll I had in a while, from what I remember, it had lobster and crab meat, it was awesome! So here it goes, if so excellent, why the 4 stars you ask.. \n\nWell.. the parfait. It was so much bigger and tastier the first time around.. from what I recall, it was served in a taller glass the last time, more ice cream and more toppings.. This time, it was skimped down to a smaller glass, and yes, smaller glass means smaller parfait. It also lacked the toppings I once remembered it had. Therefore, I conclude this review by saying Oyshi is an awesome restaurant, but they need to overcome this economic slump by serving MORE not less! =)"

            "review": "Came in here for the first time on a Sunday 2pm, off peak lunch hour. There were about 4 other groups eating there with 5 sushi chefs working. Our initial order took quite a while - it did not all come out at once which is understandable, but I've definitely eaten at other places that don't have as many chefs that was much faster. \n\nAnyway, the first round was all nigiri - the first half came out great! Fish was fresh, rice portions under them were very reasonable. When the second half of the nigiri order came out.. The ENTIRE PLATE was drowned in ponzu sauce.. Gross. This is a big no-no, the rice was so drenched in this sauce that it couldn't even be picked up without the rice falling apart. For this I am docking a star.\n\nI then decided to order some of their appetizer fresh oysters (to wash the disgusting ponzu sauce out of my mouth). They came out promptly and we're definitely fresh. They came out with a little bit of a pico de gallo type salsa on them and already had hot sauce on it.  The oysters were very clean and shucked properly - an observation I did have was that the oyster itself was almost tasteless - as in, no Oceany taste - perhaps they were farmed oysters if that's a thing.  (We paid dinner price to get in on these and the uni/sweet shrimp during lunch hour, definitely worth the extra $5pp if you eat these)\n\nAlso tried the lobster fair and spider roll - the spider roll was kind of bland and the lobster fair was a California roll with crab salad burnt on top - I would not order either one of those again. \n\nThe wife got green tea tiramisu and green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I sampled both and they were quite delicious.\n\nService was ok, our waitress must have ended her shift while we were half way through eating but the other servers were all willing to help.\n\nIn summary, not a bad AYCE sushi joint - but make sure you tell them to hold that ponzu sauce if it's not your thing.  Also choose your rolls carefully if you order any - I won't order rolls from there anymore but would definitely eat there again."

Our server was friendly and extremely prompt without being pushy at all!  She never let our drinks get completely empty and always made sure our plates were full!  My friend and I shared the Spicy Tuna Crunch and I devoured the Japanese Lasagna and the lobster/crab roll alone as he isn't a big fan of any warm sushi.  We also shared some Gyoza and the popcorn scallops (my favorite appetizer!) As always, everything was fresh and extremely tasty.  I can't wait for my next visit!!"

Their heart rolls and volcano rolls were strong in flavor with soft textures.\n\nHowever... their nigiri is only so-so.  I'd come here if you just want to go wild on ROLLS.\n\nThat being said, the service here was excellent.  They really try hard to satisfy your needs here.  The atmosphere/decor was nice too."

The waiters are snobbish and rude and the manager has no backbone to stand up to them. On top of that, they super pack the rolls and sushi with rice and if you can't eat it all, they'll charge you for it. Our waiter was a fat dick (not the good kind, fat and an a$$hole) from the start of the night. He barely acknowledged us the whole night. Anytime we signaled him to order, he looked annoyed and wouldn't come over until ten minutes later. Again with the rice, the douche bag wanted to charge us $14 for not eating all the rice. WTF man, all the rice we didn't eat didn't even equal a bowl of rice they normally charge you $1 for. When we asked the manager about it, he was useless and just said, \"You don't have to tip the waiter. He doesn't expect a tip.\" After arguing about fairness and how the establishment has gone to crap, we walked out of there paying $4 extra for rice... You can have your $4 worth of rice along with the out of business sign Oyshi. Rude, snobby employees coupled with declining quality of food ain't keeping you in business much longer."

Now you would expect low quality from somewhere like this, but it is actually pretty decent in some respects.  However, it is also lacking in areas.\n\nPros: The price was the norm for this type of establishment.  The food is good.  I'm not a big time roll eater as I'd rather eat nigiri over some American take on sushi.  The nigiri was of decent quality, not outstanding, but hey, it is the desert after all. The appetizers are great!  Yes you can make a meal out of the appetizers.  The sauce on the surf and turf was outstanding.  The tempura dipping sauce was also great.\n\nCons:  First of all, this place has gotten very busy.  I used to be able to walk right in, now it can be up to a 45 minute wait.  Once you get in you get the feel that this place is understaffed.  (Update!!!  Staff seems to have increased, speed of orders has improved....some.  Still a packed house.)  The servers come around, yet your order does not.  I came with a group of 7 big time eaters and we put in big orders at a time.  Not only did our orders take forever to come out, but it felt like the manager was watching us to see if we were really eating all that food.  It got to a point that they stopped taking our order.  It says all you can eat on the door buddy.  (Update:  Management does not do that to us anymore, are they reading this?  Great job if they are!)  They didn't even bring out our oysters and claimed that they did and we could not have any more.  I had to explain to the manager that we are not asking for more, we never got any to begin with.  They figured out that our oysters were taken to the wrong table.  Lucky them.  We ended up paying the bill and leaving having not received everything we ordered. They couldn't even take the time to fill a drink.\n\nUPDATE:  The last few times we went we got better service, the rotation of fish is fast, so the flavor has improved.  Still not the fastest, and still a wait to get in, but it's a slamming busy place now.  I have found one big dislike that is totally not the restaurant's fault.  Every time I go there now, there always seems to be the loudest, most obnoxious, cussing, group of trendy punks sitting right next to me.  It's like man, if you've got all this money that you seem to need to yell about so everyone can hear you, why are you at an AYCE sushi place.  Go eat at some rich place where everyone else is yelling about their car and their money.  I don't want to hear you, I want to hear the person sitting next to me."

It's also pretty big and open which is nice because you don't feel too packed in. \n\nI really enjoy all their different rolls but my favorites are the Rock n Roll and the crunchy scallop roll. The scallop roll has these little popcorn scallop pieces that are just so tasty. \n\nFor dessert I always get the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. If you get ayce, you only get one, but if you order a la carte the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is served with three flavors (vanilla, green tea, and chocolate) but the vanilla is the best. \n\nThe downside to this restaurant is the wait to get seated which can sometimes be a good hour or more because it's popular. The second downside is the service. Sometimes they are pretty unattentive due to the fact that they are so busy."

My wife and I order all you can eat sushi, we told the waiter which rolls we wanted to eat first that order took twenty minutes to arrive at my table. When we finished that order we had to ask a bus person to hunt down are waiters to place another order of sushi. We ended up spending over two hours eating sushi not because we ate so much but because it took for ever to place orders and to receive it.

They had us sit in a private area because we were a party of 15, and I don't know if it was due to that fact but the total experience was dampen by their lack of organization when it came to ordering and getting our food. \n\nWe all got the AYCE, so that right there was already less of a headache or so I thought. We even helped out by writing our orders on the napkins. That part was a cinch but when it came to actually receiving our orders, it was a mess. First, the dishes came out one at a time and then later on we were told that they were putting orders together in one plate: the tempura for example, which had we known, wouldn't have been a problem and could've just passed it around. Instead, people were waiting for their orders to arrive only to find out it was already given to the end of the table. We didn't want to keep ordering as we weren't aware if they were just backed up or totally forgotten. We were finally told towards the middle of the meal what they were doing, when half of the party was agitated already. Don't mess with hungry Filipinos LOL.   \n\nThe food is just OK, quality is nowhere as good as some of our preferred sushi places, it's AYCE I know, but I've been to other AYCE places where their nigiri's taste so much better and fresher. Now their green tea cr\u00e8me brulee is in a league of its own, I could eat about 5 of those suckers lol, it might be the only reason for me to come back hahaha oh and the unlimited ice cream."

The restaurant is an upscale environment with room for large parties. \n\n - The restaurant offers a huge menu of both sushi and hot kitchen items (e.g., sushi, koma, Hamachi, sizzling hot plates of steak and seafood, tempura, oysters, soups/salads, and desserts). \n\n-  There is usually a wait to be seated. The wait is sometimes as long as an hour during peek dinner times. You can drop in to be put on the list, and they will text you when they are ready to seat you. They take reservations. \n\n- They offer an all you can eat sushi menu for about $25 that includes one desert (e.g., green tea ice cream, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Moche ice cream).\n\n- My favorites are the yellowtail koma, double salmon roll, surf and turf sizzling hot plate, spicy tuna hand roll, fresh sashimi red snapper and halibut, Red Rock sushi roll, and the vanilla creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with green tea ice-cream. \n\nI've been to this location over a dozen times in just the last four months - my most frequent visit being last week for lunch. I generally ask for my favorite sushi chef and server, and I am willing to wait for them. Vincent is the best server!  This restaurant generally wants the server to tell the sushi chef your order even as you sit at the bar. At first I wasn't fond of this process, but it works well and there isn't a lag in service. The sushi chef still hands you your order -it just prevents you from yelling out at a busy chef. Vincent offers exceptional service that includes getting your beverages, kitchen items, and sushi bar order. He is exceptional. \n\nThe sushi chefs are all awesome, but my favorite is Ivan. When the restaurant isn't too busy, he will inquiry if you want anything. If you request, he will also make creations for you based on what he notices you like. He is efficient, creative, and humorous."

The fish wasn't super fresh, some of the cuts of fish were thin and cut poorly, falling apart.  Most of the rolls had the same notes of lots of imitation crab meat mixture, so they all tasted the same.  \n\nAppetizers-\nI'm a fanatic for raw oysters, they had small Pacific oysters that were a bit on the warm side and very bland tasting, flavorless even with the siracha sauce they dotted on it.  It tasted as though it was about to go bad and they rinsed it with tap water, even the shell the oyster was served in lacked oyster liquor, which isn't a good sign.  Needless to say, I was only able to eat 1 of 4 that I ordered and it was a struggle to keep it down.  I've eaten raw oysters from a jar and the raw oysters here came pretty close to that.  I told the wait staff that the oysters were a bit off and she replied, \"that's odd they're usually not like that\".  The manager was attentive and came to our table to see if we wanted more oysters, stating that there wasn't enough sauce on our previous order as to why they tasted that way. If the oysters are fresh, why would you need to drown it in \"sauce\"?\n\nThe sweet shrimp with side of fried heads, amaebi, were not so sweet, which means they weren't so fresh.  The shrimp heads weren't prepared properly, (not fried well) and so it was tough to bite through it.\n\nAfter having the oyster and amaebi, we passed on the uni, because if you can't get the other 2 right, there's no way we were going to try the uni as it needs to be super fresh.\n\nThey were pretty busy for a Tuesday night, so maybe I just have high expectations for sushi, or maybe we just got the Sushi chef in training, but if your like me and your jonesing for some great sushi, this place isn't for you."

However, we had to wait 35 minutes until even just our appettizer of the small surf and turf came out. After that it seemed like we were invisible to the waiters before we even got one to awknowledge that they were having staffing problems and that we should wait another 15 minutes for our sushi to come out. When we finally got the sushi it was horribly made and cold (we ordered a baked sushi). I happened to order calamari for my 2nd selection after finishing the 1st. That never came. After being ignored for a few more minutes another waitress came by to see if we would like anything, I was already super pissed by that time so I just ordered a dessert and asked for the check. The $26 for a dinner all you can eat sushi was not worth it. So sad that this place did not meet up to my expectations"

The food is so good, you need to try the dynamite appetizer probably the best one in Vegas that I've found thus far from living here for about a little over a year. The atmosphere is great. They have private rooms for party's and they play some really good music. If I had to choose between sumo sushi 2 and Oyshi, for some AYCE sushi on this side of town, it would be Oyshi!! Lol anyway we will be coming back for sure!"

After our meals they also had parfait, mochi, and tiramisu for dessert..I would definitely be coming back..Only downer is that it is pretty far from the strip if you don't have a car, its about a $30 cab ride, but if you split it, its not so bad.  After 2 hours of stuffing our faces and many bottles of sake, we left stuffed and satisfied and it only came out to $40 a person! We were expecting way more!"

I've been to Vegas many times and always thought the best sushi would be at some swank place on The Strip, but Yelp claimed otherwise.\n\nThe good: The food was, overall, fine. We didn't do All You Can Eat because my wife wanted two orders of sashimi (salmon and hamachi). Both were excellent. Nice large meaty pieces, well trimmed, nicely presented. We had two rolls each, which were fine but nothing special. I also had two orders of nigiri.\n\nThe bad: We arrived around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was MAYBE half full. It more than half hour before our first piece of food came out. It was 40 minutes before I saw any of my order. The (nice) server came by at 30 minutes and offered us free miso soup to help pass the time. Meanwhile we watched every other table in the place get multiple orders of sushi delivered. Completely unimpressed, and cost them several stars.\n\nOther issues: I asked if they had aji bones they could deep fry, and the server went off to find out but never came back to tell me yes or no. My aji nigiri had the tiniest pieces of aji I've ever eaten on top. It tasted fine, but they amounted to table scraps, not at all like the beautiful pieces of sashimi my wife got."

Thankfully, Oyshi Sushi has opened my eyes to the other side of AYCE.\n\nEven though this was my first real experience with AYCE, I still ordered off the menu, LOL! Should have and would have tried it, but the BF begged me to bring him left overs, the AYCE rules require you to finish eating everything you order. Nuts! Next time the BF can get his own sushi, I'm going big or going home!\n\nOur server was so nice! He made several recommendations of really good rolls, I like mine spicy and he knew which were hot and which were too hot. He even told me one roll to stay away from. He was attentive and made sure we always had food in front of us and our water glasses stayed full. Khatherine was a pro at this, she didn't even have to look at the menu, she knew everything she wanted and ordered each time he came back to the table. She knew how to keep the sushi coming, and everything that came to the table looked delicious!\n\nThe sushi was good, not amazing, but good. I tried the Monster Roll (it was so big I had a hard time fitting it in my mouth!), the Rainbow Roll (by BF's request), and the Red Dragon. The Red Dragon was by far my favorite!! My order actually ended up being more expensive than the AYCE, but at least I could bring leftovers home. Now I need to plan date night with the Beau so that we can come back and try the AYCE together."

We went here for dinner after house hunting around the area and decided to go with the all you can eat option for about $25.  The all you can eat feature allows you to order anything off the menu (rolls, hot japanese items, soup, tofu, nigiri sushi, and a selection of a few desserts including mochi).  The only exception is sashimi.  Each of the rolls off the menu ranges from $12-15/per roll so I think the all you can eat is worth it if you've worked up an appetite.  The rolls are pretty good and made to order which is different from a typical Japanese buffet in which the rolls are sitting out there for who knows how long.  Service is pretty good and the decor of the restaurant is modern and clean.  \n\nI enjoyed coming to this sushi place and for $25, the food and service can't be beat.  Thanks Oyshi for a great meal."

We ordered two rolls that were non-traditional, and we found that to be a very bad idea. On the other hand, tuna and salmon were not fresh the day we went (salmon was more fresh, but still...). It worried me. \n\nMy favorite thing on the menu that night were the ama ebi (sweet raw shrimp). They were probably one of the freshest items on the menu.

The trick, however, is that all their rolls have some sort of cream cheese or mayonnaise in it and make them so heavy and sweet tasting that you can't eat more than a few rolls.  If you like an extra helping of creamy toppings on your sushi than this place is for you.  If you prefer fresh sushi rolls the way they are supposed to be made than stay away!"

            "review": "I decided that I wanted AYCE sushi last night (Saturday) so I headed over to Oyshi.  I checked in with the host at about 8:30pm and was informed that it would be about 20 minutes for a table.  It was a nice night, so I just grabbed a chair on the sidewalk in front and waited for the other half of my party to arrive.  There were probably four or five other small groups of people milling about waiting for tables too.\n\nWe were seated at the bar just after 9:00pm.  The place seemed pretty busy...  some uncleared tables, a couple large parties (one with kids) occupied the \"VIP\" rooms behind us.  It was on the noisy side, especially with the techno/house/electronica music pumping from the ceiling speakers above the four chef's stations.\n\nAfter a few minutes we were greeted by a friendly server who confirmed our AYCE preference, took our drinks and asked if we were ready to put in our first round of orders.  We were.  I started with miso soup, an assortment of nigiri style items, an \"ahi poke\" and an order of four oysters (limit 1).  Note:  I thought it was interesting that even though we were seated at the bar, our sushi requests were made with the server.  I guess the server was attempting to queue the orders for the very busy chefs.\n\nThe nigiri items on first order arrived quickly and we were told be the chef in front of us that the oysters would be out in a \"little while\".  The nigiri items were nicely presented and of good quality.  The ahi poke was just a small clump of chopped tuna on top of a mix of seaweed salad and sprinkled with sesame seed (not exactly what I think of when I think poke, but I'm not trying to get techincal up in here son).\n\nThe oysters came out a few minutes later.  They were covered in green onion, a bit of masago and a squirt of sriracha.  I can only assume that the toppings were meant to cover up the tasteless, been sitting in a fresh-water tank, half-dollar sized oysters.  Engh, I figured I'd keep moving forward, after all this was AYCE...\n\nRound two:  More nigiri (including surf clam, tamago, masago, quail egg, tako, and scallop), something called \"oyshi scallop\", and a spider roll.  We also ordered the chicken, beef and shrimp yakitori, which were all paired with asparagus and came sitting in a sweet teriyaki sauce.  Again the nigiri items were of nice quality.  I'm not sure we ever got the \"oyshi scallop\".  There were two items in the order that looked like a krab salad (the california roll stuff) that I was sure we didn't order.  The spider roll was basically a California roll with one meager soft-shell crab in it, and it had been covered in the same bbq sauce they put on the eel.\n\nSince I was disappointed with the Spider roll and I love soft-shell crab, I put in an order for a Monster roll, which was also supposed to have soft-shell crab in it.  What came out was something similar to the Spider (covered in the same eel sauce) only with the addition of a few slivers of eel and a refrigerator cold tempura shrimp stuffed into it.  Slow down on that eel sauce dawg.\n\nAt this point, I was pretty full and done trying...  The sushi chef in front of us was closing down his station, giving it a quick wash down with a wet rag and mumbling something about this night being his \"early out\".  By this time the dining room was starting to clear out too, but the party with the kids were still in our audible vicinity.\n\nI finished up my second pot of hot tea (which was a nice quality loose leaf green) and enjoyed a green tea ice cream mochi ball.  Both of these items were good.\n\nAfter tipping out the chefs, server and taking care of the bill, I had spent about $75 for the two of us.  I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon, but I made the best of it while I was there."

So when I was invited last minute for a sushi dinner, I knew it was going to be fun.  We settled on a place one of us raved about.  I've been to Soyo restaurant many times but never Oyshi.  Time to Yelp!\n\nThe only down side of this place is the location.  I live across town from here.  Oyshi is in a really cool strip mall in my opinion.  First, you have one of my favorite Korean joints.  Now you have my favorite fried rice joint, Rice Trax.  This location, although far, will be frequented a lot.  Although the wait was super long, the restaurant is pretty cool.  Love the concrete floors, the wood accents in the front and the half table chairs, half booth options for seating.  Our service was pretty good.  Multiple servers came by our table at most times.  It was enjoyable. \n\nFor dinner at a sushi joint in Vegas, the ONLY way to go is to get the AYCE special (All You Can Eat).  This place charges a $26 price tag.  The one thing that threw me for a loop were the rules involved.  I've never seen a place have all their rules listed on their menu.  With this dinner, you can literally order anything off the menu.  Granted, there are a few items that limit one per person, but you have access to everything.  My recommendations to get the most out of your AYCE is to stick to non-rice dishes.  I know, I know, it's a sushi joint, but trust me.  You can eat so much more if you stick to the protein.  For dinner, here's what I got, grouped in categories:\n\nThings I loved: Seaweed Salad (with sesame seeds), Fresh Oysters (with ponzu sauce, green onions and hot sauce), Baked Mussels (topped with yum yum sauce and ponzu), Miso Soup (always a hit), Shrimp Tempura (lightly breaded), chicken yakitori (2 skewers with dark meat chicken and yakitori sauce), \n\nThings I liked but kind of disappointed with: Ahi Poke - Bowl filled with seaweed salad, shredded cucumbers and onions on the top, was small chunks of tuna with a little sesame seeds.  Kind of a disappointment.  I understand that tuna is expensive, but the dish was 75% salad and 25% tuna, which should have been the star of the show. \n\nThings that were questionable:  Yellowtail or hamachi nigiri - If there's any rice dish I get, it's nigiri because of the small portions. The yellowtail is usually my favorite fish, however, this specific yellowtail was a little discolored and questionable to me.  I took a bite and ended up finishing the dish but it didn't taste like what I'm used to.  Make sure it's fresh!\n\nAll in all, this place is actually good.  I'm definitely coming back for another AYCE session.  The place is still convenient and the staff is nice.  If you're looking for a good sushi joint on the SW side of Vegas, for sure check them out!"

The food was okay and I have had much better, but this review is strictly based off of service. I've worked in the restaurant industry so I know that when an incomplete party of 8 show up at 10pm, it could be annoying, however, you don't let the customer know. Well, thats what the male busser with spiked black hair and glasses made clear last night. Every question I asked him about our table he would give a short answer and then turn his back on me immediately (Keep in mind, I worked as a hostess in Vegas for 6+ years, I know how to passive aggressively tell a customer F* you and this kid did it.) Next my friend and I asked if we could wait at the bar and grab a drink and wait for the rest of the party to show, then the hostess says,\"If you don't plan on buying anything.\" I get it, they don't want to transfer the bill or whatever, so fine, we wait. Our party arrives and then we are seated and our server, a lady, I don't know her name because she never introduced herself and made it clear we were annoying her. We ordered a lot of food and tons of sushi and when the sushi came out, the staff didn't even know the names of the rolls, so when we would send it back because we did recognize the names, she would immediately come back and act as if it was our fault and stated the correct names (wow). Towards dessert she lightened up a bit. We aren't a difficult crowd, we all work(ed) in the industry and understand the difficulties of customer service (I'm not saying we're saints because we work in the industry, but we are more courteous than most that don't).\n I don't recommend this place for service, the sushi was alright. We ordered gyoza, rib eye (which they didn't ask which temperature and we were lucky to get beef jerky), miso soup, calamari, shrimp tempura, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, mochi, and different flavor ice cream. It was all O.K. All you can eat was the best part of our experience."

The food tastes fresh, the presentation lovely, and the delivery onto the plate quite speedy.  My only complaint about the food was that the rolls are packed very tightly...loose rolls aren't awesome.  I can understand how an AYCE would require trading speed for firmness but would rather have the firmness especially via ala carte ordering. \n\nAll in all it was a pleasant experience and I will likely return.

I think I have given it so many chances because it's so close by my house. \n\nOyshi problem is waiting too damn Long for  our order.  we get there at 1:45pm, didn't order til about 2pm. our food order came at 2:40pm. talk about annoying & getting super impatient. I feel like the waiters talk so much more with co workers that they don't even care that there are so many hungry people there. & to top it off they never ask for drink refills. never once I got my cup of coke refilled. ridiculous I tell you. I usually can stuff myself with a good amount of sushi, but buy waiting & waiting, my hunger just went away. \n\nsushi wise, it's alright!! it's not the greatest fish I've tasted. it could be better . only thing good I have to say about oyshi is there ice cream parfait & creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. \n\nI will never go back again. unless my dinner gets paid for!!! otherwise it's just another disappointment."

They have a vast selection of rolls, which is great for that type of sushi lover...I prefer a wider variety of nigiri sushi and other items.\n\nOur most recent visit here was a group of 8 and it was terrible. Our server was slow in taking our orders, and also kept messing up. Our orders were either incorrect in terms of quantity and selection, or they didn't arrive at all. The quality of the sushi was average. They didn't have enough teapots (we ordered hot green tea) so we had to WAIT for one to become available. Really.\n\nThey added on the automatic group tip that is typical with parties of 8+. What was suprising was that it was for 20% of the bill. We were so anxious to be done with that place, we didn't even bother bringing it up. And just to put things in perspective, our bill listed we ordered 12 items for a group of 8.  So that should tell you we were in no way high maintenance. I cannot stress how terrible the service was. This should not be acceptable, especially in a town that has a ton of sushi restaurants.\n\nI would never go back here again, especially in a large group situation. So disappointing."

It annoyed me that the seemingly easy to make sushi, nigiri, took the longest to be served. The rolls came like clockwork but I had to remind the waitress several times that my sake, hamachi and unagi nigiri hadn't come yet. By the way the unagi was cold and didn't taste fresh.\n\nLiving in the Bay Area, this place was a pleasant surprise in terms of quality and price. I will try again before heading back...perhaps a second chance at 4 stars. I'm assuming that there are 5 star sushi places in Vegas, but I would probably pay double the price for less food."

The food was amazing and the staff was super friendly and upbeat.  \n\nTun was the chef making most of our rolls and he even introduced us to the supervisor Nye who offered us some complimentary Sake which we turned down because we were already on our second bottle.  They have a happy hour from 11pm-2am with buy one get one Sake or Beer.  They also had just launched ladies night which knocked down the price for the lovely lady on the All-You-Can-Eat to $21.\n\nWe started with the Seaweed Salad before we moved on to the fabulous rolls.  We had the Monster, Japanese Garlic Lasagna, Dragon, Vegas, and Oyshi rolls.  We wish we could have tried more but we were stuffed.  We sat around chatting with the friendly staff and drinking Sake until we had a little more room in our tummies for dessert.\n\nI highly recommend this place for the great food, fun atmosphere, and they play House music."

It obviously hasn't been that long ago and it has already taken my interest and satisfies my cravings! I love their Ayce pricing ($21 lunch/$26 dinner) and of course the all-you-can-eat selections! I highly suggest their yellowtail with pico de gallo, seaweed salad, fresh oysters, and shrimp tempura as starters to prepare you for this sushi selection like Kami Kaze, Dragon, Rock N' Roll, Catepillar, Treasure and etc. Seriously though, this place is amazingly delicious. My only complaint as to why I gave this place a four star instead of a five because customer service can take you a long way and two out of the three times I've been here was a little below fair. It took them almost 20 mins in order to finally give us some attention and take our second order, they didn't refill our drinks unless asked and our wait for our entree was quite some time. Asides that, the food is heavenly mouth-watering and the AYCE pricing is good!"

After hearing my coworker praising it, I finally hit up the place with a few Meetup folks from Las Vegas and SoCal.  It is the sister restaurant to Soyo Barestaurant in the same plaza, so yes, this is another Korean owned sushi restaurant with some items that has a more Korean flare/flavor.\n\nThe restaurant itself is well-lit and trendily decorated, and attracts a diverse crowd of patrons looking for good AYCE sushi at a reasonable price.\n\nThe AYCE menu is practically the entire menu (mostly nigiri and rolls), except the sashimi and if I remembered correctly some salads.  They also have expanded their menu, and the new items are printed on the paper place mats, so don't forget to check those out too.  Plus the numerous options available in the appetizer section is more than adequate to round out the sushi dining experience.  There are three special items (uni, ama ebi and raw oysters) that is limited to one order/pp with AYCE, and the restaurant reserves the right to charge you for the food you don't finish to minimize unnecessary waste (standard rules of the AYCE realm).\n\nI Enjoyed:\nSibuya No Rice Roll\nNew Moon Roll\nVegas No Rice Roll\nYumYum Scallop\nAma Ebi and the fried shrimp heads\nSurf n Turf\nPopcorn Scallops\n\nI Didn't Care For:\nJapanese Lasagna (topped with way too much mayo that it overwhelmed and masked the flavor profile of the rolls underneath)\nAsian Style Flank Steak (basically a not so good version of the traditional Korean Bulgogi served on a sizzling plate)\nGreen Tea Tiramisu\n\nService was good, especially considering that Ted, was our only waiter, and he was looking after our party of 7 plus his other tables.\n\nWe were seated in one of the side rooms with really comfortable seats, so it was extra relaxing.\n\nAmbiance: 5/5  Great vibes.\nService: 4/5  For a busy night, our service was still great.\nFood: 4/5  Overall, I think it is pretty good for AYCE.\nPrice: 4.5/5  Very reasonable.\nParking: 5/5  Never been a problem finding a parking space when I come to this plaza.\n\n4 Stars!"

I was in town visiting some friends and family and went to this place with a large group.  i read the reviews here and thought this would be a great place to try. Especially with the $21 all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch.\n\nThe servers were prompt with taking our orders.  Our table was the second to place orders so I thought we would get great service...NOT!  I ordered a cucumber salad for an appetizer and three sushi rolls (rattlesnake roll, crunchy scallop and yellowtail trio).  Well,  it took OVER 30 minutes for my cucumber salad to arrive.  And I had to say something TWICE to the server before it came out.  By the time I got my appetizer just about everyone else in our group had already received and eaten their sushi rolls.  Why did my little cucumber salad take so long to arrive? Did they have to plant the seed and grow the cucumber?  My brother-in-law sitting next to me even got his sushi roll before I got my appetizer.  That was strike one!\n\nNow for strike two - I had to remind the server that I hadn't received my sushi rolls.  This was after everyone else was pretty much finished their rolls.  So even after I reminded him it still took another 25 minutes to get my rolls to me (Yes I was timing everything).\n\nStrike three - I get my sushi rolls. Luckily I wasn't dying of starvation because some others in our group were able to share their rolls so I was able to eat a few pieces while waiting for mine. One thing I noticed was that most of these specialty rolls had this stupid sweet chef's sauce drizzled all over. I don't mind this sauce as its great on dragon rolls.  But this caused everything to taste the EXACT same.  And this sauce was TOO SWEET.  It really killed the individual flavors of the fresh ingredients inside each roll.  My brother couldn't stomach it.  And when I finally got my rolls two of the rolls (crunchy scallop and rattlesnake) were DRENCHED with the sweet sauce.  And the yellowtail trio roll was nasty. It tasted sour like they marinated the fish in vinegar or something!\n\nIf you like sweet sushi rolls then this is the place for you.  However I will never set foot in this place again!"

One of my friends was really upset because he ordered 5 things from the menu in the beginning and it took 45 minutes for them to bring out just one! Like I said, the food was still great but having to wait what seems forever for your plates ruins the whole experience. They state you have a 2 hour limit, but what's the point if you are waiting for your food for more than half that time?\n\nOn a plus side, they did add new items to their AYCE menu; more rolls, salads, and rice bowls.

Huge selection of rolls and side menus so if you like non traditional Japanese sushi/food, by all means, go and stuff your face! I went there for traditional nigiri, so it was disappointing because of the selection and quality. I know they would charge me for not eating what I ordered, so I literally had to shove the last piece of mackerel: it smelled so fishy, I almost puked."

Limited to certain order amounts on certain items. Rib eye was a overlooked and tough. Order it rare to medium rare. They didn't ask so I guess that's my fault. Extra charge for tea. Worth a try but I probably won't be back. Our server Toni was great."

            "review": "If it wasn't for a stubborn friend, we would have gotten here earlier and avoided a \"long\" wait.  This friend said take the 95, take the 95, blah blah blah.  Even after the waiter said take the 215, my friend INSISTED on taking the 95.  The waiter probably said: \"whatever, dude, get lost and then wait longer and have your friends kick your ass before you eat our delicious buffet\".  After another friend looked Oyshi Sushi himself, we found out that we should take the 215 and did so after I got all frustrated driving in the 15 fwy traffic.\n\nIn any case, after waiting and getting seated at our table, we went straight to ordering our all-you-can-eat, which includes 2 uni (sea urchin) pieces, 2 amaebi (raw, sweet shrimp) pieces & 4 raw oysters.  Yep, there's a limit on those but you must understand that there aren't that many other places that would even give you these premium sushi pieces.  Just a note on the uni - slightly less fresh than I've had before.  In any case, you get these in addition to their fresh & delicious sushi.  Their salmon, yellowtail, albacore, halibut sushis are great, plus they don't give you as much rice in their sushi as other places.  Their rib-eye teriyaki is also an excellent dish to have.  Their tempura is also very good.  As for the dessert, we all had the strawberry mochi ice cream, which was very good.  All for $25 per person.  Not bad at all.\n\nI only have to mention a couple of cons: there is a 1 dessert limit for each person.  However, you can have all the ice cream you want since this is not considered one of the dessert items.  Plus, I find it just strange that the place is so huge and yet they waste so much space & put tiny little tables in the center when you can get bigger tables there to accommodate more people.  Last con... service.  A bit slow.  It was a really busy night, but I'm still surprised that they took more than 15 mins to take out raw food.  There was a 2-hr limit, but I don't think they pushed this limit all too much."

(Last call is usually 1:30am).. anyways, the reason why my friends and I went there is because one of us had a birthday. But the birthday boy was running late. He arrived after 1am, (past the 1am last call for that day) but they still took his order which I thought was kind of them to do. We didn't finish our food, but we only had to pay for two rolls extra. Again, that was a nice surprise. I was expecting to pay WAY more for the leftovers. I was highly expecting them to be mad or to show sings of irritation because they ended up not closing early and instead closed at the regular time of 2am. We were one of the last two groups there.. They were very accommodating throughout the whole time. Our server, Tony/Toni, was very friendly. She was very nice and always smiled throughout the whole dining experience. I think she was the one that recommended the 'love affair' which was really good!!! Anyways, during dessert, one of my friends joked around saying they were going to bring the birthday boy cake, but said it only as a joke. He said 'just kidding' and mentioned it was our friends bday which is why he said that. Tony/Toni asked if it really was our friends bday and later she came out with a green tea looking cake. I was very happy with the service !! The food was really good, but for me, service is important.. If a restaurant has good food, but really bad service, I would most likely not go back. Well Oyshi had good food AND great service! I am sold. I will be going back here soon! :)"

Also at the same time I had a baked roll with shrimp w/crab and lobster on top. The crab was super fishy smelling and just didn't taste right. I should have sent it back but our waitress was never at our table.

The menu is pretty big but there are a lot of items on the menu that is not included in their AYCE meal. On top of that, you are only allowed to get one dessert. One thing that I like about this place is the fact that they don't make their rolls as if it was for 3 people. This gives you room in your tummy to try more items. Service was above average. They never fail to give you the wrong order at least once while you are dining with them. If you're looking to try a new AYCE sushi spot, try this place."

Unfortunately there is like one or two servers who are freaking awesome as hell with there customer service and always brings food out really quick. I can't really say for the other staff members. It seems most of them got a attitude problem or something when you order and are hella slow. It which is kinda sad.

I had a bad experience here in 2011 so this was their second chance. Boy have they been delivering! We had one of the VIP rooms all to ourselves for his birthday because we were part of such a huge party. They did a great job of accommodating our big group and even brought in more tables as well as chairs so that we could all be included.\n\nBe prepared to wait! If you plan on bringing a large group, have someone.. or a few someones come early so that you can put your name on the list. Just make sure the majority of your party is there to be seated. I want to say that all 3x I have came (during dinner time), the wait has been about 20 mins - 35 mins.\n\nI love doing AYCE because as long as you eat about 3 rolls, you're getting your money's worth. Plus, it is fun to share delicious food! Make sure you're only sharing with those in your group that are getting AYCE or else they will get charged the AYCE price as well. They have an extensive rules/information outline on their menu.\n\nI think that the service here is really great for them being busy ALL of the time. They were always coming back to check up on us and asked if we wanted to put in more orders. Our tables were never cluttered because different people would swing by and grab our empty plates, plus everyone was more than helpful when we needed anything.\n\nMy go-to rolls: MONSTER ROLL: ORDER IT, JUST ORDER IT! Pink Lady Roll. Spider Roll. Dragon Roll. Japanese Lasagna Roll. I need to try even more of their specialty rolls, I am guilt of sticking to my favorites! For appetizers, order the baked green mussels, they're amazing here. Only a few sushi joints can get it right, trust me.\n\nIf you know me, then you know that I LOVE white tuna nigiri/sushi. The first time I had it here, it was amazing. The second time was decent. Haha, hopefully it just keeps getting better because I order a lot of those wherever I go for sushi. \n\nFor dessert, order the Green Tea Tiramisu with vanilla ice cream on the side. Your mouth will thank me, lol.\n\nI will definitely be back!"

The one table next to us seemed to be about midway into their meal which seemed like hours between dishes.  They get one dish, finish it, then wait for another 5 minutes for the server to bring their next order. They looked irritated. And so about 20 minutes of watching 4 or 5 chefs looking busy, we get our first order.  After we finish through our first order we order maybe 4 more orders of nigiri. (Which shouldn't take more than 3 minutes) And by then all tables were gone and about 5 people at the bar. So I expected it to come quick. Nope...20 minutes later we get our last order and by then I was fed up with everything. \nThere were about 6 servers(why??) and they seemed more excited about talking to each other than even looking to see if the customers were okay.  \nNigiri was like 80% rice 20% fish which you can expect from a Korean run sushi restaurant.  And of course they charge you if you leave rice.  How else would they make money? Not by quality, that's for sure.  \nOverall, the worst experience at an AYCE sushi restaurant.  \nIf you want quality food and service, I'd recommend xtreme sushi.

This is a key at the AYCE places as I think that they will automatically \"pace\" you with the limited staff and service. However, here, we had numerous people helping, providing us food, taking orders for additions and even the manager or owner (didn't get his name) came out to help.  Very, very nice.\n\n2.  Ambiance - 5 Stars - I was kinda irritated as to why my pals were asking to meet way out here in the middle of where, and it was not a disappointment at all. The table set up is great, nice waiting area, very comfortable flow.  I felt very, very relaxed here and not rushed at all.....\n\n3.  Food Quality - We ordered some real sushi like Amai Ebi with the fried shrimp heads and they were tasty. The Uni or sea Urchin was very flavorful and the texture was spot on.  Then, we had a bunch of westernized sushi that my pals ordered and while I cannot tell you what was in them and the conglomeration of sauces that hid the fish taste, I can tell you that as a food group, this stuff was pretty darn good. I wouldn't call it sushi, I would call it \"chop suey sushi\".  I give the food quality 4 stars.\n\n4.  Pricing - For AYCE, the price is not bad 21 / 26 per person depending on lunch or dinner.  Many of my favorites don't qualify for AYCE, so I will be going back to clarify this as I did not pay this bill, and so I am not 100% positive. However, in reading the bill, the more traditional and higher quality stuff was not included.  I will check this as I may be wrong.  For now, I give this 4 star.\n\nGK says, check it out!"

Service is very slow, and orders come when the chef decides to prepare them, not when you ordered it.  Orders have been forgotten and errors made repeatedly. Because its all-you-can-eat maybe there's a sense that mistakes don't matter if you accept the dish, since it's all the same price.  \n\nThose complaints aside, the food is done well and isn't oversized and sloppy like some AYCE places. You can tell the chefs care about presentation. I can't think of any food of poor quality there.  \n\nMy tips for this place would be to:\n1) come with a list\n2) order a variety of items at once. When they arrive, order the next batch. \n3) make sure everyone at the table agrees to order in batches, otherwise everyone  will be sitting around waiting for ages until your next lonely order arrives- and that second order could take 30 minutes or more!\n4) save room for the tiny dessert. It comes with the AYCE."

There was no one in line and they only had a few people in the restaurant. Then all around our service was bad. Our waitress took a long time to take our orders and once we were done with a dish multiple waiters and bussers would walk by and they still wouldn't take away our dirty plates.. Eventually the dishes just piled up. Even when they brought new rolls out they wouldn't take our plates away.. Then to top off a bad experience the sushi was subpar if that. We could tell the fish was previously frozen so it took away the flavor of the fish. I was very disappointed.. The whole experience was bad."

Everything that we ordered was completely delicious. I really appreciated that the sashimi slices for their nigiri were generously thick. The fish to rice ratio of the nigiri was perfect. Not too much rice.\n\nOnly reason why I gave it a 4 is because the service was kind of eh. And I really didn't like how my 3-year-old was $16 for AYCE. My daughter doesn't even eat much sushi at all. I like sushi places that have children 5 & under free.

There were quite a bit of families there also. 26 dollars ! All you can eat.

It's unbelievable that you can get all this and still have great quality. The only negative thing I can say about this place is that on Friday and Saturday nights it gets busy so you may have to wait a while for them to come back and get your 2nd orders.

Super selection-The yellowtail and garlic tuna are amazing!  Fresh everytime  and melts in your mouth.  Top 5  favorite rolls - I think what makes these so good is the eel sauce (slightly sweet):\n\n1) Atomic bomb (kind of a sad name for a japanese roll but I digress) - spicy jalapeno on top and siracha\n2) Monster roll - huge but has all the goodies \n3) Simply shrimp- light and sweet\n4) Red dragon- spicy tuna roll sweet and spicy yum!\n5) Tiger roll - similar to red dragon buy with shrimp tempura added\n\nJust tried their hand roll last night - They have a killer shrimp and avocado one. Not on the menu but they'll make it for you. \n\nAppetizers:\nSeaweed salad\nExcellent tempura-always fresh and hot never oily\nSurf and turf-steak and shrimp appetizer. One order enough for two people to share\n\nDesserts (all you can eat is one dessert per person)\nMochi of course!!\nYogurt parfait is big, especially after a large meal, but very tasty\n\nSome negatives:\n\nOyshi can get really busy.  They do take reservations and have two private rooms available.  Also, not a big fan of the \"baked sushi\" although the california crunchy roll is pretty good if you like baked.\n\nAll in all, this is my favorite sushi place in town and really hard to beat.  This place is a \"must\" for any yelper!"

            "review": "I am still in love with this place!! Since it was just me and a friend, we opted for first available seating Nd that ended up being at the bar. It's a while new environment when you sit at the bar! If it's just you and a friend, I recommend sitting at the bar. If it's you and your family or a large group, stick to a table. But I do recommend experiencing the bar when you can. \n\nBy sitting at the bar, you are face to face with the sushi chefs. You may order your rolls directly from them and if you are daring, you can just have them make rolls for you without necessarily going off the menu (AYCE guests only, I'm guessing). Since it was the first time sitting at the bar for both of us, we didn't know that was possible until we had already ordered the world and we were just about bursting at the seams. We did try a fatty tuna sushi though which was basically made with tuna belly. It was sooooooo good!! \n\nWe also had a bottle of lychee sake. It came in a wine sized bottle, but we decided to take shots of it. It was so yum and it basically tasted like juice. Which is dangerous because it had the same alc vol as wine, and my friend and I finished the bottle like it was nothing! \n\nHere are a few things that I think would be great to keep in mind while you're here: \n-if you and a friend are looking to hang out, enjoy great food, and be social, definitely sit at the bar and have the chefs make you whatever your heart desires \n-it's all you can eat, so definitely come here with an empty stomach and be prepared to eat the world! BUT...on busy nights, the wait can be awhile and if you come here super hungry, once you're seated, you'll want to order everything at once! This may not be a good thing, cuz if you're anything like us, you'll stuff your face and be done within 30 minutes. \n-if you're paying with multiple cards, make sure the person taking your payment knows what exactly is going on what card. Although  we thought that we were clear in our instructions, she still managed to charge the wrong amount! (I'm not sure if this girl just wasn't paying attention or just wasn't having it because it was so busy, but I remember she was also being a bit rude when she was calling people for their tables)"

I really like their sushi bar it's really big. The tables in the restaurants are nicely spaced so you're not rubbing elbows with your neighbors. I'm not used to Japanese Restaurants that can accommodate several large parties. They had two private rooms and we were in another area that was semi-private. There were 9 of us and we sat comfortably. I really like the painting they had against the wall in our semi private area. It was actually the only painting I saw throughout the restaurant. \n\nI have never eaten at an AYCE sushi in Las Vegas away from the strip so I was super excited. I ordered their Agedashi tofu and it was so Salty! Stay away, ha ha. I was disappointed but quickly got over it when I tasted their poke salad. I remember ordering the Kimono Roll, Yellow Trio and dessert. I had more than that, but I was so amazed how refreshing everything tasted I was too excited to remember to write it down. When I ordered I stayed away from tempura or anything baked. I was not going to get full off that, I wanted fish. Their sushi was fresh and I especially remember the salmon handroll, it was perfect. I really enjoyed their food, although the oyster was okay and their uni really looked like it needed a makeover. \n\nTheir Service was super duper good, although for some reason I was the last one to receive my order. That made me the last one to eat the desserts everyone was done while I was still waiting. Ha ha. Do not pass up on ordering their Mochi Ice Cream. Doesn't matter if you're full and your fly is about to pop, still order their dessert.\n\nSo overall, next time I will definitely come here for their AYCE! Their selection of rolls for their AYCE is plenty, not like other places its mainly filled with baked and tempura stuff. This one had plenty of raw fish in their rolls. Just the way I like it! \n\nDon't be a fool and miss out on this wonderful meal.."

The raw oysters were strangely bitter.  We let the kind manager/owner know about this and he apologized and took the plate away immediately.  The uni that came out had an off yellowish-brownish color.  I've had plenty of uni to know how it supposed to look, but this was slightly different. \n\nThe star of the night was the agedashi tofu.  Yum yum yum.  Was quite tasty.  Another highlight of this AYCE meal is the fact that you can still chose a scoop of icecream along with whatever dessert you want.  I chose the green tea icecream and the creme brulee.  Was yummy.\n\nThe chefs, staff, manager/owner are all super friendly and the service is quick.  Food however...aight."

Every dining experience has been excellent - the service is always friendly and attentive and food perfectly cooked/prepared.   We did a few ala cartes but most of the time it's always AYCE, both lunch and dinner.  Heck if they had breakfast I would do that too.  \n\nMost sushi places have a few items that are exceptional and a few not so great, but everything here range from good to phenomenal.  \n\nLet me talk a bit about their sashimi items.  I love sashimis and this place has some of the best sashimis i've ever eaten.  Their Seared Albacore with crispy onion in ginger sauce is oh so heavenly.  The only  problem is their sashimis are not included with the AYCE menu and that's understandable because the sashimis are pricier.  Another one is the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce.  OMG this melts in your mouth and it should be called screaming orgasm for your mouth!  amazing stuff!  How about this \"Tuna sashimi with shaved daikon in a chef special sauce\"? Everytime i finish this plate I want to lick the sauce off the plate but there's always people around me.  \n\nNow for their rolls.  They make the typical rolls like Rainbow, Dragon, Spider, Dynamite and Catepillar taste amazing.  Flavor explosion with every bite.  They have a few rolls that are wrapped in thin soy paper sheet that are not as filling as the ones with rice.  Some days I do low carb and i would order a bunch of these.  Pink Lady and Oh My Heart are my favorites.  If you like scallop make sure you order the Volcano, baked scallop with yum yum sauce.  \n\nSide dishes and appetizers are very small when you order with AYCE and that's a good thing cuz you just want to taste the variety of stuff.  Finish off with some mochi's and you can die happy."

All the sushi was good for ayce style, and the rice was in the nigiri wasn't hard and didn't fall apart like other ayce places. The negative aspects was that the service was a little slow for me, and they brought me one piece of yellow tail that looked like it had been sun bathing out back for the afternoon. Otherwise this place is great, and I'll be returning soon."

If you've ever been eating sushi and thought to yourself, this would be so much better with some Tiesto playing, this is your spot!\n\nFirst off, don't be discouraged by the wait. They're busy and you should be happy for them. It's usually no more than 15 minutes and you can occupy yourself by practicing new dance moves. We always sit at the sushi bar and the service is friendly and fast. I once saw no less than 6 sushi chefs hustling in that narrow space so you'll be well taken care of. \n\nOn to the tasty stuff. What I like most about this joint is if you like deep fried, baked, raw, hot, mild, funky they've got you covered. I hate places that are all cooked or all raw, you've gotta people please!  From the freshness of the fish, to the sauces they're paired with it's all a win. Their all you can eat knows almost no bounds so if you're not busting at the end you've done something wrong. To top it all off the strawberry ice cream they serve is surprisingly top notch, little strawberry swirl through it and everything. \n\nThey also have 2 private rooms for large parties and I know this because I spied on them when I was there like a creeper. Try this place out next time you're in the southwest. We were happy to find it on our side of town and not have to venture to Sushi Blvd aka Eastern."

Yes, ahh thinking about it just makes my mouth drool, they top it off with ponzu sauce and it couldn't get any better than that.\n\nTheir appetizer list is ongoing and you have so many choices, that's what I like about their AYCE, you have many options to choose from. The calamari is nice and crispy on the outside and a little chewy when you bite into it. The surf and turf is awesome and they just have new meats to pick from that come in a griddle plate (is that what it's called?) it comes steaming hot and on a bed of cabbage and onions YUMMMM! They have a good ahi poke bowl that comes with cucumber slices and seaweed salad underneath, amazing. I could go on, but you really just have to get your butt over there and try it for yourself!

The good news is Oyshi is always busy allowing them to offer fresh sushi every night of the week.  There are 2 private rooms, a large dining room and extended sushi bar with a lot of seating.  I highly recommend this sushi bar!"

            "review": "Yeah, the Husband and I are sushi snobs - at least we're upfront about it.  But when you're living in Vegas, the only way to go is to do AYCE, right?  After getting tons of recommendations for this place, we finally got around to seeing what the hype is all about.\n\nAll-you-can-eat dinner is $26/pp.  It was pretty busy on a Sunday night with a steady stream of customers (and large groups) coming in all night long.\n\nLike Ned M. mentioned, the sushi rice is only okay...it could be better.  Perhaps that's what put us off already...we had to eat the rice and we weren't digging it.\n\nWe ordered lots of nigiri and found the fish to be okay too, some of it was mushy though.  As one friend mentioned, she wished the fish was a bit 'colder'.  Maybe we came on a bad night - but everyone is raving about the fish.  I'm also not too fond of 'sauce' added to my nigiri, and they added 'sauce' to a lot of my nigiri choices.  \n\nThey do offer a wider selection of side items like Asian style skirt steak, ribeye steak teriyaki, etc.  And for this reason, one friend prefers coming here over other AYCE places.  I do like their version of agadashi tofu though.\n\nLimitations on their menu include:\n* one order of uni and amaebi per person\n* limit one order of oysters on the half shell (4 pieces) per person\n* limit one order on desserts of creme brulee, mochi ice cream, berry parfait or green tea tiramisu (regular ice cream is AYCE though - plum, green tea, vanilla, and coffee)\n\nSitting at the sushi bar, service was pretty good.  The manager seemed like he was our main waiter and he was quite attentive.  We thought we were supposed to order our sushi from the sushi chef, but he asked the manager to take our sushi order instead.  He continued to take our orders throughout the night and refilled our beverages too.  There was a gap at one point where our tempura order was forgotten, had to be reordered again, and then had to be followed up on again before we got it.\n\nI can see why this place is popular - there's definitely a mixed crowd and separate rooms for private parties.  The staff are busy and attentive and they definitely recognize the regulars.  They have a lot of rolls to choose from, something that we usually avoid.  Overall, we found Oyshi Sushi to be an average place for AYCE sushi."

I wish the prices dropped to be more comparable to other sushi spots in the area but all one can do is hope. AYCE is the safest bet for a dinner out with a table for two or more. You ensure no one will need to wash dishes in the back if they get carried away with indulging. We all have those dinner friends who have the mindset of caviar budgets but the reality of dollar-value-menu wallets. \n\nService is usually a hit or miss. I've gotten service that has made me not want to leave. On the other hand I've experienced servers at this establishment that made me want to request take-out. (which they do offer). \n\nThe draw back for this place is they don't do half orders like other spots. It's also nowhere near the strip. Which is a catch-22. The wait can be timely depending on the day of the week. If it were closer to the strip it would be an endless wait.\n\nMussels, Love Affair, Lobster Fair, Oyshi Roll, and the Japanese Lasagna are my favorites!"

I'll start off by saying I read a few reviews below and have to agree with something many have said and that is that you tend to have to wait a bit to get your orders in and then get served due to how busy the place is. My advice come early or come late ;) there open until 2 am Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nWe both got the AYCE deal; I think the bill came out to $64 for that and the two cokes. The sushi was fresh and very flavorful. The sauces were amazing. We had the simply shrimp roll (my favorite of the night), a deep fried spicy tuna roll and a few others. I tried something new for me and that was a tuna roll with scallions, which was a more fatty part of the tuna, more subtle and slightly fishier flavor that she did not enjoy, but I did. We finished off with a roll that had garlic sauce and wow that was seriously garlic flavored, so if you are not that into garlic, stay away from anything with garlic sauce. lol\n\nThe wait staff was nice, but again it was so busy they were all over the place and we tended to wait longer then I feel we or the other customers should have.\n\nThe place was ok and worth checking out if, you are in the area, but if you live across town like me it may not be worth the trip."

For $25ish, its a steal of a deal just based on the cost basis of California style sushi at any other restaurant. \nAnd that my friends, is all we came here for.  If you have read any of my other Japanese restaurant reviews, you know that this is not my cup of tea so please don't unfollow me; the lady wanted to eat Cali style sushi so what the lady wants, the lady gets. \n\nHere is the fat skinny on this place: if you stick to just the sushi rolls, you will be satisfied. Lets do the math: the average price for a Cali style roll at any given sushi joint will run you about $10 so assuming you eat at least 2 rolls, then you will eat your money's worth. \nThe rolls were decent but nothing spectacular. As mentioned previously I prefer the purist motherland style sushi. \n\nNotable misses for this place:\n1. They charge extra for sashimi\n2. Most of the cooked food is not very good. The steak did not taste good and the sizzling platter was loaded with onions as fluff. \n\n\nThe gf was happy she got her Japanese lasagna and spider rolls so all in all an -ok dining experience I guess..."

Only thing I was ehhh about for dessert was the green tea tiramisu cause it tasted like a heavier creamed cake with a very buttery taste. \n\nOverall I thought it was a nice location with nice atmosphere.

The quality was still there but the service was terrible. We felt forgotten being so far away and it took a long time to get our first order.

We left full from the tasty sushi, but disappointed with the service. \n\nThis last time we went was for the AYCE lunch. We sat close to the sushi bar, but it didn't matter. We ordered Miso and Edamame to start. The miso was brought very quickly, but we waited easily 30 minutes for our edamame. The waitress came back during our waiting to take our order for sushi. We placed our order and also asked about or edamame. She clearly forgot judging by her reaction.\n\nThe sushi came before our edamame and the quality was poor. The albacore was mangled on the rice and didn't taste fresh. Same with the Salmon. \n\nThe worst part about the last experience is that during our time waiting for edamame and sushi, we saw our waitress through the curtain in the kitchen eating food.

Comfortable seats everywhere, very nice lounge with its own TV, huge counters at the bar. One of the largest interiors I've seen. The only weird thing is how low the armchairs in the lounge are. Luckily, we didn't have to deal with that since we didn't fill the table.\n\nService: consistent pacing throughout the night. Could be because we were the lounge table, but I'll take that versus sometimes being forgotten.\n\nPicks:\n\nNigiri: everything was delicious through and through, even the tuna. The spicy tuna was a bit overwhelming for my sensitive palate. Smoked salmon special here is superior to Goyemon's special. Uni is the best quality other than when I tried Kaze's AYCE sashimi lunch. There were some issues with seaweed wrappers from different pieces sticking to each other though.\nOysters: no real off flavors and haven't gotten sick yet, so that's a win for me\nBaked mussels: solid\nFried calamari: fine\nLasagna roll: didn't notice much difference with the inclusion of avocado, and good quality\nParfait: really, really good. Fruits and crunchy granola made me really happy. Glad I made this my limit-one-dessert-that-isn't-ice-cream-scoops choice.\n\nPassable:\n\nDynamite: pretty good, but the sesame threw me off.\nSurf n Turf sizzling plate: beef strips and shrimp on a bed of onions and cabbage. Not bad, but not great.\nHot sake: average, I suppose. Best part was that it was a Mon/Tues 2-for-1 special.\n\nPans:\n\nPopcorn scallop: pretty useless.\nAmaebi head: brain drained. I feel like they did this as a restaurant-wide strategy to appeal to a more mainstream palate (you can tell by how they let you order yum yum sauce on the side). Would've liked all off the flavors to be there.\nIce cream: while the green tea was pretty good, the vanilla was not that impressive and the texture of both had noticeable ice crystals\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the meal with a few notable exceptions. It's worth the drive if you want a change from your normal sushi spot. I'd probably come back to explore the rolls since we didn't really plumb the depths of that extensive part of the menu."

The atmosphere was nice, the presentations were creative, and  great variety of rolls as well as decent prices. They have an all you can eat sushi menu that is perfection!  The only downside for me is that they only used imitation crab meat instead of real crab meat."

I came with a party of 9, and our server was so attentive and accommodating that he came by our table a number of times to make sure if everything was ok or if we needed more food; even the host came by to check up on us, now that's good service. \n\nNot only that but the food came out extra fast, usually at the AYCE sushi spots that I go to in the LA/OC area the food kinda lags, maybe because they want you to get full and not order more? Just an assumption :P\n\nAll the items that came out were good quality food: \n\n- Oysters (limit one order (4 pieces) per person during dinner only)\n- Appetizers\n- Sushi\n- Hand Rolls\n- Speciality Rolls\n- Dessert (limit one per person)\n\nAnd the selection is pretty extensive! And if you're a roll person, then you're in luck because the rolls are pretty small so that means you get to have more variety by ordering other different rolls."

Though it's off strip, I'm lucky my best friend lives close enough so we can make a trip every time I'm there. \n\nMy last visit was the first time I've done their All You Can Eat deal, and for $26, it was WELL WORTH IT! The only things it DOESN'T include are the Chef's Special Sashimi, so all your appetizers, salads, specialty rolls and desserts are included. My friends and I went all out and ordered several to share of every course. Oysters were delicious and baked mussels (while too much mayo sauce) was to die for. Tempura dishes are nice and crispy and not too soggy or heavy. My favorite salad is their ahi poke on top of seaweed salad - YUM! We shared 6 specialty rolls that were all delicious in their own ways. Again their specialty \"yum yum\" sauce is \"yum yum\", but in small amounts. The mochi ice cream is like the type you buy at the store, but again, it's all part of the deal so might as well indulge! We also got a bottle of lychee flavored cold sake that was decently priced and balanced the sweet:alcohol ratio perfectly.\n\nService is good: unless its super busy, the wait staff always comes up to check on your group, make sure your water is filled, etc. As with any sushi place, baked rolls will take longer, so be patient! They did forget one of our orders at one point, but since we were eating so much, it gave us time to digest.\n\nIf you can make the trip out with a group who enjoys sharing specialty rolls and can throw down in eating, Oyshi is the place to go!"

We also tried the RockN' Roll, the Atomic Bomb, Salmon Lover, Yellowtail Trio, Hawaiian  and other specialty rolls.  \n\nAfter eating at a different AYCE near Summerlin I had a fresh comparison.  I found what we had was all very fresh and tasty, prepared to order.  We also had seaweed salsa, rib eye appetizer, ahi poke,  and desert was included, too.  I had strawberry mochi ice cream and tasted the green tiramisu.\n\nThomas was our waiter and was very attentive in locating each of us with our orders.  He was very good.

As I've posted before, I'm not really into rolls because its usually covered in sauce, with very little filling.  I guess it's what Americans love though... Sauce on everything.  I'm guilty as well, just not on my sushi.\n\nAnyway, the fish was really poor quality.  After my initial order, I couldn't bring myself to order any more.  I love my fish to taste like fish (if that even makes sense).  The fish here had no taste whatsoever.  All I could taste was the vinegar from the rice.\n\nI thought it was cool they served oysters, but it was pretty blah.  There was no flavor at all.  It tasted like water.  It did not have that \"taste like the sea\" quality.  I don't know.  It just didn't taste like anything.  The baked mussels were not very good. Overcooked. No flavor.  Too chewy.\n\nTofu was ok, but too much sauce, and it was overly sweet.  Desserts were boring.  No green tea ice cream. Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was ok.  Ice cream parfait was ok.\n\nSeriously, this place is lacking all types of flavors.\n\nI like the fact that they serve \"fresh\" scallops, other places usually have the baby scallops drenched in yum yum sauce.  \n\nServer was friendly.  \n\nI'd pass on this place and go for Goymen, Sushi Komo, or even Kaya."

They had a wide variety of quality rolls, great tasting food, consistent service, and a really nice atmosphere that made for a great spot to have pre-game Friday night dinner. \n\nAlthough the sushi is still pretty good, the service and management has gone off the deep end and because of this, I don't think I'll ever eat at Oyshi again.  There are too many quality sushi restaurants in Las Vegas to justify returning to Oyshi where the last few visits, all I seem to get are orders that never show up, drinks that never get filled, waiters that refuse to come to our table or our spot at the bar (even though it's obvious that you've seen me flag you down), and servers/staff that are increasingly bitter and unfriendly.  \n\nThis stuff matters. Oddly enough, it's also the stuff that is easiest to fix. When you've already got quality menu items, quality sushi chefs, and quality sushi rolls that people rave about - why are you letting your terrible servers and management ruin your restaurant?\n\nIf I'm sitting at the sushi bar and I'm trying to order more beer and sake, why are people refusing to help me out? If I want to give you my money in exchange for some-what overpriced alcohol, why does it take more than 20 minutes for someone to take my drink order and then another 20 to bring me a couple of beers and sake? This should never be an issue with a sushi restaurant.  Never. Sure, AYCE places get really busy and I totally understand that. But, if you can't handle the heat - hire more servers. \n\nI shouldn't have to wait more than 45 minutes for my order. And when my order does come out, half of it shouldn't be missing. It also shouldn't take you another 30 minutes to bring out the pieces missing from my order. And you shouldn't have an attitude with customers just because they are asking for the items they originally ordered that are missing because you either forgot to put the orders in or there was a mix up in the kitchen. I am never rude to waiters or management and this last experience at Oyshi was no exception. I was pleasant and more than patient and if I still can't get someone to so much as offer an apology for missing orders/missing drinks and for treating me like I was more of a burden than a customer bringing a lot of business to the establishment, then I will happily take my business elsewhere. \n\nSorry, Oyshi, it was good while it lasted!"

Since Oyshi was just across the street from Blockbuster, we stopped in for a quick sushi fix. I've been to Oyshi many times in the past, but this visit will be my last. Service at Oyshi in the past sucked, but tonight's service was just plain unacceptable. \nBeing a server myself, I strive to be polite, easy, PATIENT, understanding, and tip well. When my son and I walked in, we waited a good 5 mins as the manager and servers walked passed us and no one even cared to seat us. I finally flagged down a server to seat us. If the establishment was busy, that's a different story, but this was at 10pm on a Thursday with only three other tables.\nThe girl that sat us gave us menus and asked if we were doing AYCE and I responded, \"No\"(I didn't want to stuff myself this late at night). I ordered water and told her I was ready to order, but she said she's not my server. 5 mins passed and our server came to take our drink order, and I told her I was ready to order. I ordered two waters, a miso soup, and 2 simple rolls. The waters and soup came in a timely manner, but I had to flag down a server for a spoon, straws, settings, and soy sauce. \nWe waited, waited, and waited(@ least 30 mins), saw other customers get their food-while thinking...did they forget our rolls??? I lost patience and called the server over & told her if they haven't yet made our rolls, I wanted to cancel. She glared at me then went over to tell the sushi chef, and he miraculously & immediately passed her a plate with our rolls! What the heck?? While we were waiting forever for our rolls, the sushi chef had them.\nWe never even got an apology for the delay. Not once were we asked if we were ok or needed anything or even got a refill. As soon as we got our rolls, we gulped them down, asked for the check, paid, and bounced!! The rolls were mediocre. Being a good tipper, I left absolutely nothing for such horrible service(from the beginning to the end) :-/."

I think a few of our friends had heard or were recommended to try this joint since they knew our group and how we can grub. The last place we went to before left a bad taste in my mouth and another a little ill from the meal, we were happy to try a completely different place. \n\nThe atmosphere, ambience, are very inviting yet dark for those intimate encounters due to the dark wood finish everywhere. TVs around for those ackward silent moments if you're on a date or deep conversation in a larger group. I do like the mural on the back wall which was really impressive.\n\nNow, down to the food, you can order anything on the menu but just watch for any restrictions such as only 1 order of uni for example. I do like the sound of appetizers you can order such as rib-eye steak which is really less than tapas on a sizzling plate and a bed of cabbage and onions. Another beef plate was the same which tasted good but I feel like I would have to order 5 of these to really make a good size order to be called an appetizer. \n\nThe rolls are inventive and decorative which is a refreshing change from the other sushi places. My recommendation is to stick to the \"designer\" rolls rather than the sushi. I must strongly advise against ordering the uni which it could be me and an off night. I always try to be brave and order it knowing it could be really good or it could be really really bad. In fact, I didn't eat the second piece because the first one I ate tasted like iodine for some reason. Definitely may explain for my stomach pains on the way back to our place. Nausea may be another descriptive word for this feeling as well. The rolls taste great and presentation looks great but I may have to say no to sushi so far away from the coastline especially in the middle of the dessert. If you have reviewed or about to review this place and give it 5 stars, you may have to check yourself as your taste buds are a bit off for what great sushi really should be in quality."

Today was no different. \n\nI have been here on numerous occasions because this is where my friends want to go; ok, whatever.  We always come for AYCE dinner and the wait is always really long even with reservations. \n\nOnce we are seated, it usually takes them a couple minutes to get our drinks and then a while long for our orders. We are so aware of their efficiency, or lack thereof, we would write down on a piece of paper of what we want and then just hand it to them. Kudos to us! \n\nThe food would always take forever to arrive and the hot dishes are always what come out first. I never understand that since raw fish simply needs to be sliced and plated... Unless they wanna fill us up with the cheap stuff first...? Hmmmmmmm. \n\nAnd once the food arrives, they are always subpar or mediocre. Nothing ever wows my husband and I. \n\nOverall, service is extremely slow. This should be a french japanese fusion restaurant in the sense that it's gonna be a three hour meal eating japanese food. The food is mediocre. The price is not spectacular. I would never come back if I can help it. \n\nOh, it's the same slowness at lunch, by the way. Most items on the menu is around $10-$12. The non sushi dishes came out first for my group today and halfway through their meal, my sushi bowl came out - mediocre yet again. \n\nThat was my last straw; I am going somewhere else."

Not only is it in \"my neck of the woods\"--SW Las Vegas, but it serves wonderful sushi and hot meals, has incredible service and inviting, fun atmosphere. Oyshi does not disappoint, and I have been to most sushi places in town. The fish is always incredibly fresh and delicisous and hot foods and rolls are creative and very tasty. The presentation is top notch too, especially for the price. That's right, the price is on the low side for \"all you can eat\" sushi as compared to other neighborhood sushi places in town; Big flat screen televisions, always running mini fountains and modern decor add to the wonderful, fun, yet inviting atmosphere. Servers all speak English and are knoweledgeable about all of the dishes and make great recommendations!!! I love this sushi restaurant and have frequented it about twice a month, if not more often. Oyshi in Japanese means \"delicious\" and this restaurant surely lives up to its name in every sense of the word. Highly recommended."

How the restaurant looks.\n2. Selection of sushi\n3. How the restaurant makes me feel.\n\nRight off the bat, you're welcomed with high end decor that depicts Japanese culture. Oyshi is nothing short of class. I'm a very limited sushi order. Ironically, I'm allergic to fish (I know, right?). However, I am able to eat shell fish, and that is good enough for me to fall in love with this new craze. They have fresh selections and a whole section of shell fish sushi. \n\nAnd what I love the most about Oyshi sushi, is that it's not some hole in the wall, dirty little restaurant. It's classy, sophisticated, and it's a spot you can bring your valued company. I actually refuse to bring dates here because I don't want them to tarnish this place for me. Highly recommended. They'll remember your name because they remember mine. But it doesn't help that I'm there every week."

The first time I was picking up my food, the total was something like $19.20 and I gave the very polite man a $20 bill. He didn't bring me any change, but asked me if I wanted something to drink while I waited. I though maybe when he brought me my food, he would give me my change but he didn't. I was going to tip him but since he never even mentioned my change, I let that be his \"tip\". \n\nThe next and last time I went I got to go food again. It was the same guy and he took my order and the total was $43.50. I have him $45. So this is actual paper money now so I thought he would totally bring me my money back this time. Again, very polite, asked me if I wanted something to drink.....and never mentioned my change again! It's not the money that bothered me, it's the assumption that really irritates me. Now you may ask, why didn't I just ask for my change. Well it's kinda simple, why should i have to! He lost a customer and a word of mouth review for $1.50. \n\nI was almost tempted to try this theory again and pay for something with a $100 and see what the result would be. Does he only keep a certain amount of money, would something over $20, $40 $50 be pushing his luck....\n\nSo in short, the food is pretty good, the thieving man is very polite but I don't like when someone just assumes that my change is his tip."

It could serve well as a date spot or a family dinner outing, based on the groups of people I spotted. While we waited for our take-out order, the host offered us beverages, which was a very nice touch.\n\nI tend to judge restaurants based on how vegetarian- and vegan-friendly they are, and this place definitely passed. There are at least 10 or 12 vegetarian rolls to choose from. I ordered the asparagus and avocado roll, vegetable tempura and miso soup. All of them were very good.

The miso soup and the tempura veggies are delicious. overall this is some of the best sushi we've had. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review is because the shrimp aren't fried to order for the rolls. The tiger roll is usually one of my favs but not when the shrimp are soggy."

I don't even think sashimi is served. All the rolls are heavily seasoned/ sauced-up and majority of them are stuffed with imitation crab (basically different variations of the california roll). I tried a spicy tuna handroll and the fish was not fresh so I had to return it (since you're charged for not eating everything that's ordered from the \"all you can eat\").\n\nI stick with non-sushi items such as the udon or this teriyaki beef rice bowl. I do like the ninja meal (veggie and shrimp tempura, California roll, and teriyaki chicken) but I can only order it if my nephew comes along (for kids only-and they're really strict about it).  In fact they're so strict that my nephew ordered it and he drank a bottle of milk so he was too full to eat. They wouldn't even let us bring the kids meal home. We had to pay for it but we couldn't pack to go!"

Mind you that I didn't have any fancy jeezus phone or other interwebz navigating phone on me so I had to depend on my simple, yet reliable and dependable intuition... and lifelines. ;D  As I walked the strip during lunch hour sunshine I was rudely awakened to the fact after epic fail after epic fail that sushi apparently only open during dinner hours. FML!!!! \n\nI end up calling my cousin to yelp it... bare in mind he doesn't know how to use the ever HOLY YELP but does what he can for me off his interwebz capable cell. He forwards me a list and after several returned calls of being open hours later one of them responds that they are currently open. I tell the cabbie who then proceeds to drive my ass half an hour into the desert. Who knew????\n\nWTF??\n\nWell, I get there to this strip mall in the middle of no where and proceed to order and drink, drink and eat, and eat and drink some more. I dock them one star for the uni.. it wasn't as good as I would have expected but then again we are in the desert and I suppose should be grateful for anything shell fish. After ordering countless orders of sashimi and sushi I realize that they offer a all-you-can-eat sushi. \n\nOh well!\n\nIt appears that a lot of people come here for this. I had no idea what to order so I flagged the closest waiter for assistance. The helpful and over zealous staff suggested a number of oddly named rolls which we humored them by ordering. Well, I can at least tell you that their menu offerings were pretty damned good. I wish I could remember the named of the lobster covered roll that I ordered because it was indulgent. So other than the uni I had no complaints about traveling the better part of an hour to get here. \n\nnow how do i get back to the strip?\no_0"

The service is decent but the sushi is just not as delicious as it used to be. My last to go order, the rolls were very heavily overloaded with rice, over cooked rice, so much that both rolls were falling apart as soon as I opened the to go box. I'm a sushi addict and I know that some places that offer AYCE overload the rolls with rice to fill you up but it's very disappointing when you are paying al a carte prices at $30 for 2 rolls and you have to pull so much rice off it and still can't enjoy it. I order to go from other places like Sawa, Ojah, Goyemon and Kyara and have never had this problem with them. Also, the shrimp tempura was mushy, the tuna didn't taste fresh... I could go on and on. Sadly wouldn't recommend Oyshi, plenty of other places to eat at."

I gave this place three strikes before I decided I won't come here again. The first time I came with a group of 4 friends. Waitresses were always slow to come to our table to order more sushi leaving us with nothing to eat multiple times. At the end of the day two of us got food poisoning the next day. Second time I came with my girlfriend. Again, waitresses don't check up on our table enough. Third time I came with a group of 8 friends. We waited over 30 minutes for our server to take our second order for ayce. We complained to the manager about our server and it seemed like he didn't care or address our concern. When our server did come we already lost our appetite and just wanted to leave. The food is amazing but the service needs an overhaul.\n\nI'll be return every once in awhile but, previous experiences has kept Oyshi from being my #1 AYCE sushi."

We didn't mind the wait, we were pretty excited to try somewhere new. Our waiter immediately took our drink orders, and then asked if we'd like to order. All three of us got all you can eat, so we could try a bunch of stuff together. We got edemame, chicken yakitori, muscles, raw oysters, gyoza, yellowtail nigiri, miso soup, and a few rolls. The raw oysters were outstanding. Soooo fresh and good! The chicken was tasty, the muscles were fresh and not too much sauce,  the edemame was steamed perfectly. The nigiri was a little different, but tasted okay. The tiger roll and the screaming roll were only okay. An OVERLOAD of rice, it was almost astonishing. Like holy shit, that's a lot of rice, bro. The hawiaan and whatever rolls my friend got were pretty tasty. Overall, it's worth it just for the appetizers. I'll come back to try different rolls\n\nBy the way, when my friend got a refill on her sprite, he came back and she said that the syrup was all out, it just tasted like soda water. He was confused. Did she want another one? Uhm. Yeah. So he went into the kitchen, literally stood there for a few seconds, and came back and gave her the SAME glass. Oh boy. \nOther than that weird mishap, service was pretty good."

And I can safely say I left knowing full well that Gluttony is very satisfied (there's got to be some sort of ironic word play here, but goodness I can never figure it out). Oyshi Sushi has definitely raised the bar for the SoCal AYCE sushi restaurants. I might even say it is comparable to the delicious and the very-missed Kami (RIP)\n\nThe SKINNY:\nI came with a group of 12. I was one of the last to show up, and I was very surprised at the fact that it could seat 12 people. The usual AYCE sushi ordering paradigm (...i barreled through 4 seasons of The Big Bang Theory) is a check list that is given to the waitress, which will be dropped off at the chef, and eventually you'll be nom-noming your way through delectable bite size raw fish goodness. But here, there is no checklist, you order directly to the waitress. But amazingly almost all orders made by the 12 people were satisfied! This place has amazing service with a very patient staff, and a variety of Nigiri and Rolls that i so deeply yearn for here in california. It's 26 dollars well spent my friends. \n\nThe Food:\nOkay so originally we were suppose to go to Sushi Mon, but one thing led to another and we ended up at Oyshi. \"they have a better variety of rolls, and most of our group prefers rolls....\" Hearing it breaks my heart, but the need of the many outweighs the need of the few, so I had to comply. But! hot dam, this place got some unique selections for just the simple nigiri. Spanish Mackerel? Garlic Tuna? Halibut? Seriously, the Koreans owning our local southern california ayce sushi joints needs to take a page of the koreans owning Nevada's ayce sushi joints. I have to say, they were all amazing (with the exception of the cajun albacore. that was just good. But it's still better than bad)\nI have to point out the fact that they offer a free order of Amaebi and Uni, AND 4 pcs of raw oysters per customer. Being that most of the people I went with was apprehensive to raw food, I ate more than enough free orders. My goodness, my raw oyster cravings won't start up for at least another month (seriously, it's like a menstrual cycle. I know, i'm disgusting). \nEverybody speaks of how great their rolls are, and sure they are pretty good. But honestly, I can't remember them for the life of me. So maybe they were more forgettable than spectacular. But who cares, give me another 4 pieces of raw oysters dammit! That's what's important here.\n\nThe Service: \nOh poor poor waitress. She had to go through so much...good thing we tipped her generously (and this is coming from a Chiense man). The service is actually spot on, given that there were some dead times where our food arrived a bit slow, but its a minor issue. Afterall, there were probably 5 sushi chefs taking care of a whole restaurant, INCLUDING a party of 12. \n\nThis place is a bit off the Vegas Strip, but who cares, it's all you can eat SUSHI. and It's good! The only reason why you wouldnt come out here is if you said \"Oh i ate too much at the Wynn Buffet already.\" And that's barely an excuse."

If you're hungry, these plates aren't shareable, but most of the time they are.  The asian skirt steak has a hint of sweetness to it.

Very tender steak, and the shrimp was grilled to perfection.  \n\nI like to get nigiris: salmon, garlic tuna, and yellowtail.  All the fish tastes fresh.

I found a couple rolls that were interesting and spicy.  Enjoyed them both thoroughly.  My colleagues raved about their selections also.  The sushi chefs were very courteous, and the waitress was quick to assist with questions and recommendations.  \n\nI will definitely keep this on my lunch list, and may have to make an evening visit, when you really decide on that last star at a local sushi spot!  \"Kanpai!\""

Basically everything on the menu minus the sashimi's on the menu are obtainable for the AYCE deal just make sure you can finish everything you order, or pay the price.\nI liked the fact that the fish was actually cold to the touch when I was eating the rolls and what not...it gives me the false sense that it's fresher.\nLike most AYCE if you have a big appetite it becomes a better deal for you but if you can only stomach two rolls max, might be better off ordering off the menu and skipping on the deal."

The atomic bomb was the only roll I thought was pretty good, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. The Sunrise roll I did not care for at all. It tasted like it was soaked in a garlic soy sauce. The Iris Special roll was very difficult to eat. The sauce tasted very similar to the sauce in the Sunrise roll, but it was a completely different sauce.

If this is smaller order, I'm afraid to ask what their regular size would be. These two rolls came out near the end of our meals and we were kinda full by that time already, so trying to stuff those two rolls down was a challenge. Next time, I won't order this roll unless I have 2 or 3 people to split it with. Anyway, the reason I reduced one star on this trip is that the sushi wasn't as fresh as my previous trip there. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional fresh either. I heard from some review, not sure if it's for Oyshi or Kobe, that it might be due to the fact that fish delivery comes on Tue, Thu and Sat."

Sushi is not the only thing part of the buffet menu, there are the small appetizer sushi's as well as tempura vegetables.  The best part are the specialty rolls, they are so freakin delicious.

We made our first round of orders and waited, waited some more and waited.  It was a good 25 minutes before we got our first round.  We didn't receive our complete order, I just said eh never mind. We ordered some more, and I ordered some Uni and oysters for our group. Again we waited, and waited again. We got the rest of our FIRST order and got some of the second but no uni or oysters. So I ordered some nigiri to hold me over until the uni and oysters came. My nigiri came but not the other items, finally the oysters came but no uni, i asked our server where is the uni and i she tells me 'oh, we ran out'. I was like WTF! Shouldn't you know that information before I ordered it or at least kept me updated. At this point some of my party was clearly upset and just ordered dessert but guess what? They were OUT of some the dessert items too! \n\nThis last visit was VERY bad, I hope they improve cause I like this place a lot because they offer different items from other AYCE.\n\nFYI: The table next to us, got up and left and never paid, I think it was due to the poor service they got.\n\nI'll be back, MAYBE"

I don't think I've ever waited for 20mins for a table. The food is always good. Everything I've ever had their is yummy! They added a sizzling plate which I really enjoyed. They have a couple ppl that walk around just to clear your table which is awesome. Your table is never cluttered."

It's definitely the best sushi in Vegas - I always bring my friends so we can try a new roll or just really have a good time. \nI would give them 5, 6, 10 stars a couple years ago but the last time I was there I felt the quality of their food went down! The rolls didn't look fresh, the size of the salmon cuts or anything really are half now! I got very disappointed when I left the place, It use to be my favorite must go place in Vegas. \nThe one good thing about them is I already complained about the service once and they took very good care of me, so I'm assuming if they figure it out the service went down considerably they will definitely take care and made it tool as good as before."

This was the first AYCE sushi place I've been to here in the valley and it's not in my top 3 places. To sum it up, Oyshi is so hit or miss that it's almost a risk to come here. Yes, you'll come here see that there's a long wait and expect it to be great but the last few times I've been here and given chance after chance, I've left disappointed. \n\nFirst of all, I used to work in a restaurant. Server's know when it's busy, trust me, and as a customer I expect you to acknowledge that. The times that I've waited for a decent amount of time, I've never been apologized to about the wait or been given an explanation when the rolls I've ordered don't come out when it seems like people who just sat down are getting there's before me. \n\nI'm not that selfish, but I just feel like the service here is poorly conducted. I've felt that it takes a group of us to look around constantly before someone comes and asks if we need anything. The rolls are always very good, but the amount of time that it takes most times I'm there is not average to the sushi places I've been to. \n\nI will admit I do love their Salmon Nigiri and the Love Affair roll but a lot of the other rolls often feel like there is just too much going on. I don't like to complain, but the service isn't up to my standards and my standards aren't extremely high. I just expect my water to be refilled within a decent time and asked if I'd like to order more without having to ask to order more. \n\nI am very forgiving and I will come here, I just don't have the expectations that I once did. The sushi is usually very fresh and the options aside from the sushi are great. I always order the calamari and the surf-n-turf appetizers when I come here. I would recommend this place to a friend, I think I would just advise them to be go-getters with their servers and make it known when they want something. All in all, if someone said they were coming here tomorrow, I'd probably join them. Cheers!"

Just no.  I want to shout this at the top of my lungs to the owner/manager/whatever of this place.  The sushi here was the WORST ever that Ive tasted.  They boast an impressive menu but too bad they do not know how to properly make each roll.  The fish was SLIMY and gross.  Sushi rolls should not slide down your throat, you should be able to chew them and relish in all the amazing flavors.  I couldn't distinguish any of the rolls apart and the WORST one was the Hawaiian roll.  It completely ruined my entire appetite and I couldnt eat any more sushi.  Like literally too disgusted.\n\nSecondly, NO.  The service needed some help.  They were friendly but when they got busy they couldn't keep up.  There were 4 sushi chefs and 3 waitresses with the restaurant being full.  It took forever to get us seated (the hostess has to waitress just to keep up), forever to get our sushi rolls, and forever to get a refill and we went there when it was NOT busy.  \n\nLastly, my boyfriend and I both immediately felt sick to our stomachs when we left.  Like nauseous, clutch your stomach, take tiny sips of water and moan sick.\n\nSo why one star?  Why bother to give one?  Because the staff WAS friendly whenever they did talk to us.  \n\nAlso there were several flies in the restaurant.  DEE-SGUSTING\n\nHarumph!"

Two of the rolls were ok, not delicious, but good. What this place needs to step up in is on service. Staff friendly but not as attentive as they could've been. I never received my Sapporo and was billed for it (I didn't pay for it).I imagine the trick is ordering the AYCE. The table next to us had it and received regular service, in fact, their water glasses were filled while ours were left empty. Place is not worth the lengthy drive from the strip."

My opinions on this restaurant has been consistent within these several years. I love this place. I eat here few times a month because I can't get enough of the food! Some reviewers may complain about the service, with a few exceptions, their service to us has been amazing. The thing I admire most about this restaurant is that the service isn't limited to just the servers, but the owner is running around serving people as well. I've been going here for so long, the owner recognizes us each time! \n\nFood: I am obsessed with their Ian's Special Roll. It has multiple layers of flavor goodness! \n\nThings to Try: Snow Mountain roll, Salmon Lover, Tiger Roll, Surf and Turf (appetizer), Ahi poke, Baked Mussels, Grilled Asparagus and Shrimp, and all the sushi fish you desire. Their Vanilla Parfait for dessert is pretty amazing too. \n\nI usually look forward to the Uni and the Oysters, but the reason why it's 4 stars and not 5 is because there have been times where it is not available. And it really puts a damper on my entire meal. Who doesn't want to get their money's worth! \n\nOverall, great experience! When anyone comes into town, this is the first place I take them, and they all love it as much as I do! It's pretty amazing! I've tried so many sushi restaurants here and out of state, and none compares to the sushi place here in Vegas!"

This includes everything on the menu except sashimi. Some of our favs were the Hawaiian Ahi Poke, Nigiri, Tiger Roll, and for dessert, Green Tea Ice Cream. It's about a 10 minute drive off the strip. Great for large parties, but make reservations. We went on a Monday night, and though we were able to get seats right away at 5:45pm, the place was pretty busy by the time we left.

The only down side to Oyshi is the time it takes to bring out your food. Other sushi places in town are very quick to get orders to the table. I went a second time hoping it was just an off night in the kitchen but the service was still incredibly slow. We were at our table for 10 minutes before anyone came to greet us, which is annoying but the food here is worth the wait I suppose."

We did the AYCE deal and after I finished a roll it would be like, 15 minutes before anyone asked for our next order. A few times we had to pester the bus boys to get our server because they were the only staff that was coming around. I saw the server at the table next to us check on them twice before anyone came to us even once. I understand if it's crazy busy and people are ordering sushi like it's going out of style, but I kept looking up at the servers standing around at the bar doing nothing but looking confused. Maybe they didn't know who had our table, I don't know. After we were done with our dessert we just sat there for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our check. Again, we had to literally get up out of our seats to find someone.\n\nAny time I've done AYCE at other places, even busier places like Goyemon, the service has been fine.

Disappointed that we couldn't order half rolls, only full rolls. So we couldn't try a variety of sushi because we got full fast. It's ok, the sushi all seemed the same. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was good, most memorable part of the experience. The green tea tiramisu someone got was ok. Didn't like how you can only order one dessert but unlimited ice cream. Got too full to try the ice cream. Their rules are weak compared to sushi mon or Yama sushi. Would not come back. I didn't think it was worth it."

            "review": "If you are a sushi snob, hit back on your browser and get a plane ticket to LA at least if not Tokyo. Las Vegas as far as I have seen as two sushi options... Buffet and the type of place you are subsidizing comped high rollers. \n\nOyshi is the buffet type. $21 for lunch. $26 for dinner. I did not notice anything different between the two menus. The $5 vig is likely pure the night vig. \n\nYour options include sushi, rolls and hot dishes. Each is worth a paragraph. \n\nSushi. Most AYCE places save $$$ by not offering albacore, ikura, scallops, uni and other such high end items. This is not the case for Oyshi, which makes me wonder where they cut corners. That being said, I believe the sushi is the highlight of the menu. Though the rice is not prepared to sushi standards, the rice portion is fairly small compared to the fish, so this does not take away too much from the bite. The actual fish itself is pretty good considering it is AYCE. Note that each order is a fairly small two pieces, so don't be shy about ordering a lot. Do eat the rice as well, though, as you will be penalized for going no-carbs. \n\nRolls. Of the spider, bonsai, ebi ebi and volcano, I only liked the last two. I think the issue here is the sauces are pretty hit and miss. I think that AYCE places try to make their rolls filling, salty and sweet to induce satiation or in the case of bonsai nausea. That roll actually made me heave a little. Don't order too many rolls. It is sort of like how most of the menu is rolls like casinos mostly place slot machines on the casino floor. It's the most profitable. \n\nLast and definitely least is the appetizer menu. All the meat items suck. The beefs are stringy and sweet sauced up to disguise their cheapness and the chicken is dry. Don't waste gut space. If you wanted a nice surf and turf combo, you should be at a fine steakhouse. I was disappointed, but having a good appetizer menu at an AYCE sushi place would just be a bonus. I think some of the non-meat stuff is fairly safe, such as the miso soup (though don't expect the world). \n\nDrinks. Didn't sample the alcohol, but you have your usual assortment of sake and beer. Since I was there for lunch and was still tired from the previous night's drive, I passed. Tea is $2.50 in case you wanted to know and is pretty good to share since it is a flat fee for one pot with free hot water refills. \n\nThough Oyshi is in a strip mall on a nondescript corner of the Vegas suburbs, it wants you to think that you are in Caesar's Palace. Not necessarily a bad thing. \n\nThere are two back rooms to accommodate large groups. Lunch is fairly quiet. I would expect dinner to be loud with the drinking and the karaoke. \n\nServices is good during lunch. Attentive and even proactive about making sure you order a lot. Nice. \n\nOverall, it is a good value at $21. This continually justifies my urge to stay away from the Strip for dining. Just don't expect tsukiji quality or anything and enjoy the relatively cheap eats."

Now this is beyond me 5 minutes went by before my friends sprite hit the table and another 5 minutes for my coke. Why on earth they didnt come at the same time is beyond me and why it would 10 ten minutes pisses me off even more. We ordered a couple roles and some salads. The salads came and we ate them and then sat there and sat there for about 15 minutes before we could even get someones attention to say hey whats happened??  They must have known how shitty they were with out me even complaining becase when the rolls finally did come they told us the salads would be complimentary due to the lack of service. That is only reason they get 2 stars instead of one. Regardless after two shitty service experiences I have no interest in returning."

This place is a nice size restaurant with a large sushi bar-, which is a super plus. The wait staff was nice and the sushi chefs were super friendly. They were super helpful as well (not to mention one that was super cute lol.) I ordered two rolls, both spicy. One had a spicy chili such and was deep friend. The other had Cajun albacore on the top - SO AMAZING. I would go there and order everything with that on top of it. The flavor was nice with a subtle kick in the back. I also had the cr\u00e8me brulee trio- also called the trilogy (by the cite sushi chef) The green tea wasn't good at all- way too strong but the other two, vanilla and chocolate were excellent. The chocolate was absolutely fantastic and I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cr\u00e8me brulee. Also the fact that they're all you can eat was only 26.95 is a super plus. They have a variety of specialty salads and appetizers you can ad onto that that looked amazing. Unfortunately I didn't have enough room for that but Ill be back! Probably next week with a friend."

Knowing this, I would just get to go orders and never had any problems with that. \n\nFast forward about 1 year... I was excited to eat here because I was sure they would have their sh*t together by now. Boy was I wrong... Our first round took FOREVER AND A DAY and our server forgot a couple things I had ordered so I ordered once again. I swear saw her scribbling on her notepad while I was telling her what I would like to eat next.  It is quite possible that she was just jotting things down for the grocery store after her shift. We decided to order dessert from the waitress at the next table so that we could have it right after the rest of the sushi came. So, dessert came and we decided to let the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e sit there on our table until the rest of our sushi came. To our surprise the sushi and our waitress was nowhere to be found!!! A long while later I asked another waitress if she could check on our other sushi orders and she informed is that there were none and she could take our order if we wanted more. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAPPENED IN ONE VISIT!!! I tried to give this place another chance and I just feel silly for expecting something better from a place that can't offer anything better than horribly slow service. They deserve NO stars but the sushi that actually made it to the table was okay.  Don't waste your time going here... Drive to Goyemon, SushiMon, or Sushi Twister. I promise, even though the drive is further it'll take even longer to wait around for sushi here."

The first few speed bumps which caught my eye were some ground rules listed in the menu:\n\n1. No sashimi, only one order of oysters (4 pieces), uni, and sweet shrimp allowed...fair enough\n\n2. No excess rice shall be allowed to remain uneaten on the plate, otherwise that order will be counted as extra on the final bill....have people been discarding their rice into a large pile assembling a massive sculptured mountain of rice?  The rice that was used to prepare the sushi was highly variable in quality  (too soft, too firm, or mixed) throughout the various rounds of ordering so it only motivated us to concoct creative methods for disposing the rice (hiding it in the tea jar, breaking it into tiny grains and scattering it across the plate so as to create the illusion of a clean plate, and to borrow a technique from a friend who disliked rice during her early childhood, placing said rice into mouth and going to bathroom to dispose in toilet/trash).  Of course none of this was done, but it was tempting nonetheless.\n\n3.  Any orders which are unfinished in general will be counted as extra orders on the final bill...this was adhered yet strangely enough after receiving our final round of food (a modest 2-3 rolls) the server waited when we were rubbing our bellies and chimes in \"you have two more rolls coming!\" and none of us had any idea where these phantom rolls were coming from and she then replies with a snarky shrug  \"I'll take them off your order\" as if she was doing us a favor....pure shenanigans\n\n4. The jalapeno poppers on the appetizer menu were not allowed to be included amongst the AYCE orders....what kind of crazy logic is this?  Wouldn't it be good strategy to fill your customers with heartburn due to fatty spicy cream cheese richness to slow down their intake of much much more expensive items?  Either these are the greatest jalapeno poppers in the history of appetizers or a missed business opportunity.   I don't even like jalapeno poppers but I almost was willing  to eat one just because this condition existed.\n\nTHE MEAL\n\nThe appetizers  (ahi poke, spicy sashimi salad, and miso soup)  The poke might as well have been unseasoned sashimi, whereas the sashimi salad was overdressed nearly drowning in the chili vinaigrette, and the miso soup was surprisingly not overly salty as I anticipated but ended up being the surprise highlight of the meal.\n\nThe \"big three\" (uni, raw oysters, and sweet shrimp)...not exceedingly fresh but no risk of possible food poisoning either, although the oysters had a watered down quality to them....only tasted good since they were not specifically paid for.\n\nThe nigiri:  I sampled the surfer clam, spanish mackerel, japanese yellowtail, and a few other standards....there was definitely something I couldn't put my finger on but the level of freshness just seemed 1 level below what you would expect if you ordered these same items at a regular reputable sushi bar.  I'm thinking perhaps they were precut in mass production and by the time they arrived they were partially dried out from the external surface area of each piece of fish being exposed for a prolonged period of time.\n\nThe rolls:  Perhaps I've had enough sushi experiences to have progressed beyond rolls since they are drenched in so much sauce (seriously, what is the obsession with orgasm sauce in this town?), crispy shavings of empty calories, or packed with so many types of fish that I couldn't really differentiate any of them out of a sushi roll lineup much like the Seinfeld episode where George tries to catch the Twix bar candy thief (\"It's a SETUP! They're all Caterpillar rolls!!\")  I would try to limit your roll intake and focus on the other items to keep your palate from being overwhelmed(and to avoid the server from pulling that phantom roll maneuver as previously discussed)\n\nLast but not least, we figured we had successfully navigated through the labyrinth of extra charges until we received the final bill which charged us for the hot tea...are you serious???  So you're telling me I could have drank an entire gallon of miso soup instead of one measly cup of hot green tea which cost you pennies to brew?  Perhaps these were some tea leaves taken from the Emperor's garden, but I would appreciate a warning next time.  \n\n3 stars only because we definitely still got our money's worth, but I'm leaving a few more stars to be earned since my friends reassured me Goyemon is better."

Ive come here about 2-3 times a month for the past 2yrs plus. Always do AYCE. The main thing that got me as a repeat customer is their service(at least in my experiences) is considerably better than most sushi places Ive visited. I counted and cant even believe Ive tried 12 different AYCE sushi spots in Vegas to date. Im not a big fan of the traditional sushi, more into the creative and many rolls that these places sell. I like to say Im more into the 'americanized' type of sushi and have been able to convince friends who dont even eat raw fish to try it with me and most liked it. So you can take what you want from my review based on that. This place does get very busy at dinner with sometimes long waits to be seated so I try to frequent at lunch. Service can take longer at times. I typically like to sit at the bar when I sushi. I have experienced faster service that way usually, so now I lean towards sitting at the bar. The ambiance, decor and music targets the more younger demographic.\nSome items I favor are the seared salmon nigiri, cajun albacore nigiri, tiger roll, double screaming orgasm, heart attack, ian special, chung hua, kamikaze & surf n turf roll. At every AYCE I go for green tea ice cream and hamachi kama(not on AYCE here) if its available. They do also have brulees, mochi ice cream and parfaits for dessert. All desserts are limited to 1 per cept for ice cream. Dinner AYCE limits are 1 uni, 1 ama ebi and 2 raw oysters which is similar to most AYCEs. Theres a list of appetizers which I will order from ocassionally but I concentrate more on the sushi and green tea ice cream. :)\nIs it the freshest and highest quality seafood? No. Its decent. It does say theres a time limit of, 90min I believe? Dont remember exactly atm since its never come into play. Ive never been rushed even tho I know I have passed the time limit before, or things like being reminded repeatedly on leftover charges. I realize this may not be everybodys cup of tea but for food and service Ive gotten here, I think you definitely get your moneys worth."

            "review": "I was coming through vegas on my move across country, and great friend said he wanted to take me out for sushi.  This was a special occasion for several occasions:  we were meeting after knowing each other online for ten years, it was a few days before my birthday and most importantly, I'd never eaten sushi before. I told him to pick somewhere really special and where I could try several different things because I wasn't sure what I'd like.  He said that Oyshi was all you can eat, which meant I could sample just about anything I wanted.\n\nWe ordered everything. This little guy put away about 18 pieces of yellowtail.  I tried it and it was ok, though the rolls were definitely the star.  The fried calimari was amazing.  We ordered fantasy roll, sexy roll, love affair, and dragon roll.  It was all amazing! if I had to pick my favorite, it was the love affair.  We also got seaweed salad, sweet shrimp, and fried scallops. The only thing I didn't care for was octopus, but it was a personal preference.  it was amazingly good, all of it, and they were so nice! Service was excellent and since 2 people in our party were almost an hour and a half late, they even let us stay longer than the two hours allowed.  It was the best first experience having sushi that I could've had!"

The fish is not at its freshest/finest compared to other places, most of their rolls are stuffed full of imitation crab, and the rice is pretty inconsistent across chefs, getting bigger with the more you order. \n\nTheir deserts are more unique than other places and pretty good.

We tried to order all of the rolls that sounded spicy because that's our thing. Everything we tried was really good, just not quite spicy enough for me.  My favorite roll was the Volcano roll.

They had a spacious seating arrangement, colorful decor, Xgames and the Laker's Game on TV, and Techno music playing in the background (not really what I had expected in a Sushi joint).  We came for the AYCE @ about $22.00 for dinner.  It's decently priced for AYCE.  The price does not include a drink.  The selection of food on the menu was pretty good.  They had a good assortment of appetizers, specialty rolls, and traditional Nigiri (not to mention hand cut Maki rolls).  I am a big fan of Sashimi, but like 99% of the time, the Sashimi is not included in the AYCE.  I did however stock up on the Sake (raw Salmon) Nigiri.  Being my favorite Nigiri, I found their Sake Nigiri to be very very fresh.  It was super bright orange and tasted incredible!  For dessert, they have a few different flavors of Mochi, but you can only get one.  If I remember correctly, the flavors are as follows: Green Tea, Mango, and Red Bean.  I opted for the Mango and wish I could have had a second since they were pretty small in size.  Anyhow, the Sake Nigiri alone would have gotten Oyshi 4 stars, but unfortunately the service was extremely slow.  On top of that, the only soup available was the Miso Soup.  How do you not have Udon on the AYCE menu?  Seriously?? They also did not have low-sodium soy sauce (I know it still has like 800mg per tbsp , but that's better than 1000mg).  Overall, I'd come here again... I just hope my server can keep my water cup filled."

I found the service of our waitress to be pretty bad. My drink was only refilled once and she was very inattentive. Quality of fish is always good and have never had a problem besides how full I leave. The other options are also very good, I always order the seaweed salad and seared ribeye steak which comes on a sizzling hot pan with cabbage and onions and is a great option on the AYCE menu for those that love a surf and turf. I say the food is great for the price, and the place is only getting 4 for the value I got which is something I look for. But the service was lacking. Still worth a trip!"

The Uni being the worst - was very brown and I had to send it back . The waitress even made a comment about it....\nThe tuna and salmon on our rolls were off colored - not the normal vibrant red and orange fresh versions should be. \n\nThe nigiri pieces came out better - super white tuna was the best, salmon belly, and garlic tuna. \nYellowtail was off perhaps I should've asked for a different cut . Oh and they put double rice to fish ratio which is annoying and takes away from the enjoyment of the fish \n\nAll in all I was very disappointed in Oyshi's decline in quality and I won't be returning .

We were seated at the sushi bar but the sushi chefs seem to engrossed with their work that we had to wait to catch their eye so we can put more orders in.  Good thing there was some kind of shift change and the newer chef at least asked us once if we wanted to order more.  \n\nAs for the food, we started off with nigiri sushi, then moved on with the specialty rolls.  I quickly realized that their fish wasn't 100% fresh when it was laying simple and bare as nigiri sushi.  However, they do concoct good sauces and compose interesting rolls (maybe to compensate for the lesser quality of the fish).\n\nThe weird thing I noticed when we ordered unagi... In all other sushi bars I've been to, unagi is broiled for a few minutes before making it into sushi to give it nice caramelization.  Here, they skip it, and while the unagi seems slightly warm, it was not crispy and the flavor was a bit muted (I think broiling intensifies the flavor).  I guess next time I will ask them to make it \"extra crispy\"."

First off I should have known better to eat there when I realized me and my friend were the only Asians in the restaraunt. If you are a Expert Sushi eater you would do well to stay away from Oyshi. The Sushi Rice was horrid. It was not cooked all the way and they pack the rice way too tight. I never got three things I ordered by the time I left which was such a turn off.  Some of the Nigiri was decent however some of it tasted not so fresh. The back of my throat was itching from their fish as I am very sensitive to bad fish. The server was super sweet however she was not attentive what so ever. \n\n    My child ordered the Teryaki kids meal and the first thing she said when I asked her how is it was my chicken is dry with no flavor so I had them take it back. \n\n   They do not understand how to make rolls there. I ordered the spicy tuna which was the worse spicy tuna. They had no cucumber in any rolls which that texture was missing from every roll. I do not think they understand the proper way to make sushi. \n\n  Discouraged from the sushi I tried to order some apps to get my moneys worth.... Bad idea the salad ...bad! The Calamri was the same frozen tiny dried over cooked calamari served at other pizza bistros. The sizzling rib eye was over cooked and dry and flavorless. The mussels had a garlic soy mayo sauce which was super salty and made the mussels super rich. \n\n   This place seems to be more for those who really do not know what good sushi is. If you were raised eating sushi then I would stay far away from Oyshi.  They seem concerned when they notice a customer is unhappy yet management or the servers do nothing to ammend the situation. \n\n  I ordered Sea Urchin, sunrise roll, white tuna, salmon, garlic tuna and a few other rolls and Nigiri. The only thing I liked or enjoyed was my water with lemon. \n\n  Now all I am thinking about is the money I wasted there. I have never been so displeased ergo why I tweeted to my 16 Thousand Followers that they should never eat at Oyshi .. HORRIBLE"

At this point we offered to sit at the bar  which only had more than 10 avail seats, and we were told the issue was the staff was backed up and we could not be seated there either. We waited approx 20 min before we were sat at a table that had more soy sauce on the menus than were in the soy sauce pots. We placed our order, half our party received their rolls within an acceptable 15 min (We took a soy sauce pot from another table that had been empty the entire time and that one was also empty) while the other half did not receive anything until 45 min had gone by and the other half of the table had eaten their entire order. After 1 hour the person next me and I had received 2 of the 3 rolls we initially ordered and we canceled the remaining order. The server took off our drinks and did not charge us the remaining rolls even though one of the elusive rolls showed up the min we tried to leave. Food was good/average for a sushi place in this price bracket waiter was prompt and courteous. The one star is for the food and the waiter otherwise I would select none.  Restaurant was just poorly staffed/operated. One last thing the was the restroom looked like it was hit by hurricane Sandy and the host really did not seem to care about anything. Who understaffs a restaurant on a Saturday night?"

This is my go to place for sushi with my husband and his co workers\n\nThe wait can be long, so get here early. The longest we've ever waited is max 20 mins\n\nAYCE for lunch is 21 and dinner is 26 bucks, not bad. Which includes a large amount of appetizers and desserts\n\nFavorite rolls: spicy tuna crunch, tiger roll, snow mountains. \n\nThe desserts are delicious. The biggest hits being green tea mochi ice cream and the green tea tiramisu.  \n\nThe service is excellent, the rolls take a while to come out but it's worth the wait because you can taste the freshness. \n\nLike all sushi places, they charge you if you waste food. One bite or two isn't a big deal but don't waste an entire roll.\n\nThe restaurant looks like a high ended sushi house, that's well decorated. Very clean and open. \n\nCan't wait to take my out of town friends here."

As I'm from San Francisco, I was a bit cautious and not too optimistic about the quality and freshness of the fish, however I was quickly impressed with the large variety of rolls, fish as well as other main entr\u00e9es and appetizers on the menu.\nI started with the simple seaweed salad and edamame, both which were well seasoned and served at the perfect temperature.\nTypically I am a fancy, combo roll fan but I will have to say that the quality of fish made the simple rolls one of my favorites of the night. The spicy yellowtail roll was very good as was the salmon avocado.\nTo finish off, the all-you-can-eat menu there is a choice of dessert. I'm always a fan of the green tea ice cream and in this instant the ice cream was superb. \nWill def go back the next time I am in Vegas."

From the moment we walked in the door the staff was rude and acted like we were bothering them from coming in. There were a few people helping us and not one of them were attentive. It took forever to refill waters and order more food. The staff was very standoffish and everyone from the management to servers to the sushi chefs looked miserable to be working there. I didn't like the atmosphere for an afternoon they were playing party music. Their quality of fish was low and didn't seem fresh. I was very disappointed with this place considering all of the reviews. I have to drive a little bit father for an AYCE sushi place now but it is well worth it, so everyone go to Sushi Koma instead!!

The imitation crab was mushy and sweet. The rolls were 7 day-old grocery store quality. I'm talking about Albertson's quality. The rolls at Whole Foods are way better than Oyshi's. Also, the rolls were loaded with way too much rice. I know that ayce places love to fill you up with rice, but this was ridiculous. Why have rolls called the yum yum scallop that contains one tiny sliver of scallop, or a lobster fair roll that has no lobster in it?  This was a waste of $72 for two people."

Trust me, Goymon or I love sushi has WAY BETTER SUSHI. so the night went like this...... I had guests all the way from KOREA. they are the ones who saw the review of this place and told me they want to go. I told them they are not that great (since I have been here several times) but regardless to my opinion, we went. We waited for 30 mins to be seated which is not a big deal. I understand sushi restaurants get busy for dinners.... We sat down and ordered a few nigiris.... THEY brounght 4 pcs every 20 minutes. Once again, I have been to other sushi restaurants and I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT NO MATTER HOW BUSY THE RESTURANT IS, nigiri never takes that long.. so as a result, within an hour... we ate 6 pcs between 3 people. I asked for a manager and told them the situation, and he said THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO. (NOT EVEN SORRY) so we said we want to leave and THEY CHARGED US FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF 3ppl's ALL YOU CAN EAT. I am telling you right now, if you want to ruin our dinner with AWFUL FOOD and IRRESPONSIBLE and RUDE staffs, this is the place to be. NEVER EVER AGAIN. THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER."

I tend to have slow moments so it wasn't until the end of the meal that realized that, with the exception of a few items, the whole darn menu (appetizers, soups, rolls, nigiri, tapas, and dessert) was included in one price! Lunch was less than $20 per adult, which I felt was a steal. The restaurant isn't on the strip but it's worth it for anyone visiting to venture off the beaten path for this great dining experience. Plus, it gives you the opportunity to see the residential side of things. This is now, without a doubt, one of my \"must-visit\" places when I come to Vegas."

I have been going here for years and have seen it change over time physically, however the food is consistent - and that's why I go back! \n\nIt's located on Rainbow and Windmill which is literally less than a two minute drive from where I live. It's super convenient - the southwest area is developing like crazy so make sure to call ahead and make sure there's a table for you if you have a big group. Sometimes you have a wait a bit to get seated even for 2 people on a high volume day, but if call ahead it shouldn't be a problem. They've been improving seating people right away I have noticed the past few times. Prices are affordable and they also offer all you can eat. They have a private parking lot too. \n\nAlso, during the weekdays they have an awesome lunch special. I ordered their chicken teriyaki which was a generous serving with a California roll, miso soup, vegetable/shrimp tempura, and a house salad all for $12!!!! Who wouldn't be stoked about that? \n\nOverall, this place is great. I recommend to anyon"

No sweet shrimp or uni (sea urchin) for lunch buffet (dinner only)\n2. Dynamite roll had wayyyy too much mayo which was gross\n3. No all you can eat dessert!? Wanted some more of that strawberry mochi!\n\nRecommendations: I'd choose the skirt steak over the other steaks. Yellow halibut is awesome (don't get the baby halibut as it is bland). Any of their rolls is decent but nothing really stood out to me in particular.\n\nDefinitely worth coming back for the lunch special"

            "review": "We came here at the recommendation of a friend who lives in Vegas after mentioning wanting to go to Nobu for dinner. (I'm from NY and like the Nobu location there). The decor is adequate, but the music was really odd for a restaurant: one of the first songs we heard was about eating pussy and there were many songs with the n word. I expect that while I'm at the club, but while I'm eating? Completely tasteless! \n\nThe service was lacking but not the worst I've seen. At one point the waitress came over to check the amount of wine left in the bottle, then set it down and walked away even though two of our glasses were empty! The food came out very slowly, but that's typical of an all-you-can-eat place, where they want you to fill up in between courses and order less. \n\nThe food itself was extremely disappointing. Most of the rolls had ingredients that are never in real sushi: cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and other odd things. They were presented attractively but were drenched in cream sauces and the ones that were fried were disgustingly greasy. The fish was fresh enough but not even close to the quality I'm used to. \n\nI guess if you've never had really high quality sushi you might enjoy this place (judging from other reviewers) but if you appreciate only the best sushi, you'll probably want to skip Oyshi. I definitely won't go back!"

            "review": "I am a big fan of sushi.  We were apartment hunting and one of the leasing agents told us about Oyshi Sushi.  We were glad we did.  It was a very refreshing change from our normal haunting place here in Silverado Ranch.  Oyshi is very nice.  Most of their patrons are young adults and they have pop music in the background.  We really liked the ambiance of the restaurant.  The best part was the food, for an AYCE dinner, it is somewhat on the pricey side but we wanted to try their extensive sushis.  They have hand rolls, cut sushi, baked, deep fried, fusion, vegetarian, specialty, and sashimi (this isn't included in the AYCE price though).  You can also have some appetizers and various salads, rice bowls, and dessert with the AYCE price.  For the two of us with regular drinks, we spent $61 ($71 with tip), so as you can see, it can get pricey.  \n\nNow, for the review of the food.  We ordered AYCE and we ate our fill of sushi.\n\nMy order:\n1) Deep fried Philly - loved it!  It was cooked well and not dried up.  The sauce on it is enough that it doesn't require soy sauce to enjoy.\n2) Rainbow Roll - so fresh and tasty.\n3) Tiger Roll - it was so beautiful and enjoyed it immensely.\n4)  Double Salmon - I enjoy salmon so this was a no brainer.\n\nMy partner:\n1)  Supreme Vegetarian -  he liked it but it was wrapped in soy paper.  He liked the veggies that were rolled in the \"sushi.\"\n2)  Hawaiian Roll - this is a definite thing to order!\n3)  California Roll - they were done well as they should be.  It is a staple in any sushi place.\n4)  Japanese Lasagna - this one is baked.  He wasn't a fan of cooked sushi.\n\nThen, the heavenly bites of dessert came.  My partner had the Strawberry Mochi and I had the Creme Brule.  I have to say, the Creme Brule was a taste of heaven.  I was so glad we got this for sure.\n\nTo end my LONGEST review(so far), this sushi place is definitely a go to place for us.  The ambiance was awesome, the food were tasty, and over all, its a definite place to try out.  Just be sure your wallet can afford the bill."

The reason I only gave a 4 star is because the quality of service has dropped. Largely due to the fact that it has gotten so much busier. There are more waiters but they do not tend to the customers fast enough. The food is great, but for an all-you-can-eat spot, you will enjoy the large menu they offer. The food is always fresh because of the amount of traffic they had. You can find your favorite server and request them to serve you.. Usually requesting anyone to serve you in particular will encourage them to serve you better. I am sure everyone was expecting my 4 star rating to be all positive but I've gone to Oyshi since it opened and I understand the restaurant has grown from what it originally was. The service has dropped a little but they still offer you great food for a great price."

We have always gone if we are craving sushi and they have an AYCE option. We've never had the problem of getting seated right away which other people have mentioned, but I don't blame them because their staff and customer service is plain out horrible.\n\nThe first time my girlfriend took my to Oyshi she had an issue with the customer service that the waitress was giving her. She did not clarify the oysters which was a part of the AYCE and after she was very rude. After taking our order we saw her twice and then thereafter other waitresses had to take our order and deliver our food.\n\nOur second time going to Oyshi it was fine. We were seated in a timely manner and received our orders of AYCE sushi without any issues.\n\nThe third time we went to Oyshi is WHY IM WRITING THIS REVIEW and have joined YELP and is also why I'm NOT GOING BACK THERE. We were seated in a timely manner and our order was taken in a timely manner as well, but after the waitress (Pinky) took our order of AYCE we never saw her again. That's when everything fell apart. Our food took at least 20 mins to come out and it wasn't even busy. Not only that, we always order baked mussels with our order  and that never came out to the point where we order a second round. We had to call over the host or the manager or whoever the guy that was dressed up with a tie was. When Pinky never came back a young waiter started to follow up on us. This waiter was \"AWESOME!\" NOT!!! The guy would only look at my girlfriend and never acknowledged me at all. I had to flag the guy down to get a refill on my drink because he would just ask my GF and leave. After waiting and losing our appetites we didn't even ask for dessert which is a part of the AYCE. We were so disgusted with the service that we just asked for the bill.\n\nLastly, THIS IS WHY I GAVE THEM A ONE STAR...\n\nMy bill came out to be $61.62 and because of the wait and the horrible customer service I DID NOT TIP THEM.

The All You Can Eat menu also includes other dishes besides sushi, such as Calamari or Asian Skirt Steak. The food here is pretty darn great.\n\nHowever.... the service here is horrible. I've been here about 6 times and it's a bad experience most of the time. I wait for up to 30 minutes for my food. One time my server forgot to put in anything that I ordered so I didn't get my food for a whole 45 minutes.\n\nI also had to wait to be seated for 20 minutes when I could clearly see that there were about a dozen free tables.\n\nAlso, one time I went there and the server recognized me from a week before. She remembered that I didn't tip so generously the last time I was there, so when we sat down, she told us \"I hope you tip more this time\". I believe that was extremely rude. It ruined my appetite for the rest of the meal."

I have only had the all-you-can-eat here, so my 4-star rating is based on quality for an AYCE setting. \n\nOf all the AYCE places I've been to, Oyshi is definitely the best. Their variety of rolls, sushi, and appetizers is the largest. The fish is fresh and the appetizers are quite creative. I highly recommend the Red Rock Roll and Screaming Roll. For appetizers, the Ahi Poke and Agedashi Tofu is always very good. A welcomed difference from many other AYCE sushi places is that Oyshi is a very nice restaurant. It was built to be a sushi restaurant and has the ambiance of one. \n\nEver since I found Oyshi a few years ago, I have not gone anywhere else in town for AYCE sushi. However, it has really caught on and their business seems to be booming, especially during the peak hours. Because of that, the last couple of time I've gone there, the service has been very, very slow. I actually tried a new place recently, because I didn't want to be there for 2+hours. Outside of that, it's definitely the best AYCE place in town."

The people who have worked there longer seem to be comfortable, whereas those who are newer work a little harder to ensure better service. Sometimes it takes a while for a waiter or waitress to come back and check on you, and sometimes they're always there. Sometimes the food comes timely, and sometimes not so quickly, even on the slower days. Again, hit or miss. \n\nThis is a great place to bring company, as it is decently and comparably priced, clean, and modern. But we've also had better food at more hole-in-the wall places; the only thing is that it is not as presentable as Oyshi. I guess it depends on what you're looking for -- pretty decent food with a modern feel, or excellent food with a less presentable atmosphere."

All the fish are fresh and for me, perfectly sliced. Sushi at other places are too bug for a mouthfull, but here its perfect. The eel is by far my favorite and the tuna and yellowfin are also top notch. The restaurant is charming and the staff are attentive. Pricing here us pretty standard so no suprises there. You can easily go here on a date or with your family. This place is my number one on my list of sushi restaurants."

It's just SO SAD how they only give you 1 dessert when you order AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi.

I suggest reserving this room for a special occasion or if you have a large party. \n\nWe all had the all-you-can-eat sushi and for $26 it's a steal! There are a few catches though..only a 4 oyster limit per person and you have to eat the rice that comes with your sushi or they threaten to charge you for it . \n\nI think we ordered everything on the menu but a few dishes that stood out were: rib eye steak teriyaki (not over cooked at all), calamari (I didn't get a chance to try this but other people at our table kept ordering more of this) J&B roll (soooo good with the baked scallops on top). I thought the baked rolls were a lot larger than the other sushi rolls so be careful not to order too much (like we did). \n\nOur waiter was pretty attentive and even offered to take our picture for us. The owner was really nice. I think I talked to him about making the reservations and when he heard it was for a b-day he gave us the private room even though our party wasn't that big.

Why not isn't everything fried best? \nThe rib eye steak was ok but some of it was just too well done so it was tough.  \nThe surf and turf is better with the rib eye and two shrimps.

Most sushi places have this rule as a safety cushion for those rude customers who don't know any better and camp out in the restaurant for hours as if it were their last meal.\n\nThe decor is industrial Asian with exposed pipes, bricks, dim lighting, and colorful murals. It's a snazzy place in an unassuming location, but I'd totally take a date here.\n\nWith tip and tax, it came out to around $65 for two and that's including drinks and after devouring half the Pacific Ocean.

One of my most enjoyed rolls the rainbow roll consisted of no avocado, loads of crab, and poorly sliced pieces. \n\nThis is my third time here and I'll say that every experience here has been a gradual decrease of pleasure.

Many of the rolls where they say soft shell crab mix, only means 95% imitation crab mixed with 5% soft shell crab.  Was horrible.  Anyway I'm pretty sure if your not a sushi advocate then this place will be just as good for you, but I'm use eating good, real good so I'll give it an average rating of 3. The server was on point though.  Had to end it off with something nice i suppose."

We used that place as a crutch and were afraid to try a new place (for fear it would not live up to the old place standards). \n\nI had passed Oyshi many times running errands and after driving back to the Southwest area of town, broken hearted about the closure of our \"comfort zone\" sushi venue, we decided to go to Oyshi and give it a try. \n\nI am happy to report that we were very satisfied and have been back MANY times. \n\nRecommendations \n1. Do the AYCE. We've calculated MANY times what our meal would have cost with out AYCE and we always come up winners. \n2. Don't go on Friday or Saturday nights if you are starving and just can't wait. It's busy, and that should say quite a bit about the quality. I don't mind the crowd or the wait, but sometimes my stomach wishes we had gotten there a little earlier. \n\nLikes \n1. House music in the background \n2. TVs behind the sushi bar for the sports fans. \n3. Ample bar seating - we ALWAYS sit at the bar\n4. Extensive menu\n5. Chef willing to let you make up your own rolls :)\n\nWe try to hit up Oyshi once a month or more if the Sushi cravings are just to hard to resist. I highly recommend. Yum (salivating as I write this)"

They can accommodate large groups if you plan to throw a get together. Some menu highlights - they have AWESOME selections of sizzling iron plates of Steak Teriyaki, Chicken Teriyaki, and Grilled Salmon. (Unlimited too!) Annnd there Calamari and Popcorn Scallops are so yummy!\n\nCons: NO HALF-ROLLS available except if you eat at the sushi bar. Getting your sushi orders takes a long time! We waited for over a half an hour after putting our order for sushi, so I recommend that you know what you want and putting in a large order."

I think Alice W was more angry about the service and used the F.P. card. I've never heard of a whole family getting food poisoning so take that review with a grain of salt. \n\n My first time was good, I just did not write about it. Today I went for lunch and had a great experience. They have a few new rolls and I tried 3 of them. They were all beautifully executed and tasted great. \n\nI'm usually not a fan of ponzu sauce but the Iris roll**** off the new menu was so good I had 2 of them. It had  Spicy albacore with cucumber, wrapped with avocado, and seared tuna. My eating partner in crime loved it. \n\nScreaming Roll****shrimp tempura roll wrapped with yum-yum cajun albacore and avocado with garlic ponzu sauce. Flavor of cajun albacore was awesome. \n\nLove Affair roll ***shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes and masago on top. This was good, but came in last of all the other rolls. \n\nAsian skirt steak*** is served teriaki style on a sizzling mini skillet. It was a nice addition to sushi.\n\nService was better than average. I always sit at the sushi bar. Here you order from a waiter instead of directly from sushi chefs. My waiter was attentive, I had enough H2O to drink and never had to wait on food or ordering more of it. \n\nThe AYCE is $21.00 per person and well worth it. I wish they offered fried rice but there are lots of items offered on their menu.\n\nI will return to Oyshi as it is the best sushi that is close to my house."

Try to go for lunch, there isn't a lot different in dinner except for a higher price. Service could be improved! 8/10 times I visit, I get wonderful servers! But then theres a few times I get a server who never refills drinks, slow on taking orders, not being very attentive. Other than that I love this place! The rolls are delicious! I reccomend the Love Affair (crab and crunchy flakes) or the Crunchy Roll (popcorn shrimp and yum yum sauce) or basically everything else on the menu. You get delicious food for a reasonable price, only wish servers were a little more welcoming but other than that, this is the place!!"

Took them 20 mins to bring water and coke, by the way, never get the refill within 1 1/2 hour stayed. The worst dishes was the one I ordered \"gyo don\" it supposed to come with really thin and tender beef with stir fried onion and half cooked sukiyaki soup based eggs. But disapointedly I recieved a mexivan style beef bawl. lots of green paper and sunny side up egg. Nothing like gyo don. \nSushi was okay, until we got home, all 4 of us start feeling the stomach pain.went into quick care the next following day. \nOne last thing to mntion is the lady waitress, she was really not professional. We asked her to clean up our dishes before the cakes come, she picked up 2 dishes then never come back. We have to ask anoyher waiter to clean up the rest of empty dishes. \nWe live across st from thos restaurant, but we will nevrer come back again."

It appears the Sahara location will have other menu options which is odd since they are owned by the same owner, but it may that they have different nightly specials. \n\nI really liked the quail egg sushi. It is a raw egg, but it tastes sunny side up egg which is perfect since I love egg yolk! I have heard that this place has horrible sushi, but it wasn't bad at all. I did not like their special of the day which was negotori (I'm not sure if that's correctly). When we looked it up, it said it was fatty tuna. When it did arrive, it was not solid and the rice tasted heavily of sesame oil. They did have white tuna, \n\nI do love that they also have a other options like their steak, surf and turf, spicy pork. I usually like to order a ton of appetizers and non sushi. Their tempera batter was okay. It wasn't as crispy and crunchy as I would have liked. It was the same thing with the calamari.  \n\nI did not like the green tea tiramisu. It was very very wet.

Nice clean interior (they actually have a VIP room, guess that's a normal thing in Vegas to have everywhere though, eh?), friendly staff and an amazing deal for all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi.  \n\nThey do AYCE where you actually just order whatever you want off the regular menu and they make and deliver it to you.  My friends Andrea, Annie and James all chowed and put away an impressive amount of sushi.  Since Annie and Andrea are bodybuilders they usually can't get full but we were all about to burst as we waddled out of Oyshi.\n\nThe nigiri are pretty decently sized and the fish is quite good.  As far as AYCE, it's the best fish I've had.  They have a ton of crazy rolls and while I am not usually a roll guy for AYCE it's fun to try out so many options.\n\nWe went for lunch and it was $21 which we definitely got our money's worth.  It's also nice to get away from the Strip as we are here covering a bodybuilding show and the pace is less flashy and frenetic which is great.\n\nDefinitely make it out to Oyshi!"

Waited 30min for my app: gyoza. The chefs never said hi or even looked at my direction with care or happiness. \"I have been always greeted at a bar/sushi bar\", it is the least they can do. One of the chef made a silly comment as soon as I arrived at the bar, after that I knew I was at the wrong place. From 4 different kind of rolls I would only came back for 1 (maniac roll) it was the only one spice with no sweet sauce or fake crabmeat. Everything else was just blah blah blah. The service was polite but slow nd confused. I never had a refill on my water. Their (management/sushi chef) seems like to kiss the good looking/well dressed ppl ass. Everyone else were mistreated including myself. This was the worse place I have ever been. I would never come back here once I won't put my best clothes just to someone treat me with respect. Besides for 1 single good roll??? Forget it. I would prefer to drive to 808 sushi that' is not fancy but better quality sushi and a way better service. . The first roll I had was the monster (every single piece of it fell apart when trying to eat it. every single roll were ugly and tasteless except for the super sweet sauce and super sweet crabmeat combination they put on everything.\nMy experience at this place lasted around 1 1/2hour bc it would take between 25-35 min for every order.

I waited to post a review after our second visit because often the first time may not be enough of an experience to grade a restaurant properly. Excellent quality all around, good atmosphere and most importantly the food is prepared consistently which is the main flaw with most restaurants, not just sushi places. Service is very good and everyone seems to help each other deliver orders to the tables. We really like the fact that the fish inside the rolls are actually cool in temperature and not warm like most places we've tried. The sauces are light in flavor and not over powering, which can overwhelm and kill the fish flavor of good quality sushi rolls. My only negative remark would be that for some reason, after our initial order the second order (often our final order) which is probably 1 or 2 rolls it seems to take a while to come out. Also today my wife wore white pants and it seems there was some soy sauce spilled on the seat of the booth and it stained her pants which I noticed when we went shopping afterwards, but no big deal since it would be hard to see that soy sauce was spilled on a black booth cushion. \"We ain't mad at ya\", we will be back for more. We hardly tried the extensive offerings this menu features. The best All You Can Eat sushi in town!"

The restaurant was nice, plenty of open space with good music playing.\n\nWe went there for the \"all you can eat\" menu and we were not disappointed. There are only a few sections on the menu that were not included in the all you can eat price, but other than that the majority of the menu was free range. From appetizers to desserts, countless rolls and entrees this place really was a feast for the eyes and stomach.\n\nBut the only downside, there's only so much sushi you can eat before it just gets gross. After a few appetizers and 3 or 4 different rolls, we were ready to call it a night. From experiences at other sushi restaurants, this place was mediocre. The fish could have been fresher, but I'm guessing with the \"All You Can Eat\" staple on their menu, they get whatever fish they can and throw it in a roll.\n\nThis place was cool, but the long drive and mediocre cuisine left me wanting more from a sushi restaurant than just looks. I'd go back, I just wouldn't get the all you can eat offering again."

The difference between lunch and dinner is that lunch excludes oysters and something else they list on the front of the menu. Aside from that, you can indulge in any roll or hot item. Sashimi's off limits. \n\nKeep in mind that the rolls, regular priced, run for about $13 each so you might as well pay the $26 the ayce option and sample as much as you feel like... unless you're one of those freaks that can eat ONE roll and be satisfied... \n\nThe catch to the rolls was as I suspected- tons of rice. One roll was so loaded that I felt my body refusing to chew any more of it. The sushi was another story- the amount of rice was fair. Oh, and sidenote, you're charged regular price for anything you remove or fail to consume the rice from. \n\nIt seems that the best way to fill up without tapping out too early is to focus on the hot items and sushi- fill up on surf and turf, calamari, and ahi poke salad and pick maybe one or two rolls that sound too good to deny yourself of them. Or, you could be me and go roll crazy and have to fight yourself to chew. \n\nThere are very tempting dessert options, of which you're limited to one (sad!) Bring friends and share all four. The mochi (mango or raspberry) was tiny, but I can imagine it was a refreshing treat. I had the creme brulee and my friend had the green tiramisu. Both were absolutely wonderful. The green tiramisu was a first for me and it was so exciting to eat. Creamy, yet subtle, yet sweet. \n\nThe only qualm I have with my experience was that we were there on a day when the sushi kitchen was hopelessly backed up. All of our hot food came out quickly, but the sushi took what felt like forever to appear. It became an issue for friends who didn't order hot food and waited well over an hour to eat anything. \n\nLuckily the two-hour ordering limit was not applied to us or else this would be a fishy deal!"

So a few days later (visit 3 in less then 10 days) we went again. This time my friend who intro the place made it. When we were done we asked for Kevin again the five of us ate ayces. My two boys both under 3 did not eat. Again we were in VIP room.  Kevin came up and we reminded him of our wrong roll order and the 22 buck credit we had. He said what rolls would you like to take home? We said none the guy we ordered them for is here and we ate enough fish tonight. He said well I'm not taking off check next time you do want rolls to go I will take care of you. Then the check came 18% gratuity for 5 people....... We paid it cause it was 24 dollars but the server actually screwed himself out of a bigger tip.  The service also sucked.. Hour for our first round of rolls to show to the table.

Their one manager who has been working the last couple times I've gone is amazing. He's very attentive and talks to the tables and makes sure everyone has what they need. If he is not there.. it's not the same. The service is below average. If they are the slightest bit busy.. you have to wait sometimes 20 minutes before the server will even remember she has you at her table to put another order in. This can sometimes be good because if it's AYCE, you're completely hungry after waiting 20 mins between each roll... we also paid with cash once.. 12 over.. and never got our change. and the service was terrible that time. so really? you're just gonna assume the rest is your tip? mmm no. and then she never returned to the table even though we sat there and waited for quite awhile. oh well.. the food itself though is usually amazing. I've never really ordered anything that I didn't like. Except the mochi for dessert. everywhere else I go they cut it into quarters for you and sometimes even decorate it with chocolate sauce (sushi wa on eastern.. recommend there waaay over this place) .. but not this place.. you just gotta bite right into it and man does that hurt my sensitive teeth. But again, the food is good, and if you go on a less busy night the food comes out somewhat fast. \n\nAlso, it can get pretty cramped. Last time I was there they sat a larger table next to us and put a chair on the end. I literally could have rested my head on the guys shoulder who say there. Really? I understand about wanting to accommodate every guest that comes in.. but what about the comfort ability of the other guests already there? mmmm not my favorite place yet I keep returning so it'll get 3 stars."

The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri sushi was really good.\n\nService was another story.  We waited around 45 mins or more for our first round to come out....even the oyster apps.  Go figure why thier AYCE time limit is 2hrs, not the usually 1hr.  Our server wasn't the greatest, but she did follow up on us when she could.  I noticed she was busing several tables, which is probably why she never followed up with the food and why she was tired.  I have done that, so I know the feeling.  the facility needs to either have the host bus, or have someone to."

When the owner is not around, the place goes haywire. I will say the quality of food is usually pretty good and when the heavier gentleman is behind the sushi bar, we are treated phenomenally. This is where it ends. There is zero consistency. This evening we arrived around 11:30 PM. There were 6-8 tables seated as well as about 6 people at the sushi bar. We opted to sit at the bar. There were 2 sushi chefs for the entire restaurant so we already assumed the wait time on food would be a bit slow but being that it was so late at night this wasn't a problem. What was a problem was the HORRIBLE service we received. There was a group of what seemed to be off duty employees sitting in the back portion of the bar drinking. The chefs were going over to that side at least every 5 minutes, taking shots and conversing, as tickets sat in front of them. At one point one of the servers had to go through the kitchen and behind the bar to ask a chef for extra sauce. The woman who took our order came back once after 10 minutes and once more after about 25. We placed our order with another server who did not write anything down and alas, forgot 3 of the 4 items we ordered. At this point, visibly bothered, one of the chefs told us to order any sushi through him, which we did. That too was forgotten. We could not even enjoy the $60 dinner we paid for and rushed out of there as to flee a very uncomfortable situation. Unfortunately I think it is time to find a new neighborhood sushi spot as this place clearly allows their employees to run the show which shows in their service."

Oyshi is great, $21 AYCE lunch with a huge selection to choose from. We sat at the bar and had almost impeccable service. We did to request plates (they did not bring them out with the wasabi) but everyone that helped us was so pleasant and upbeat, and our drinks were refilled without us ever having to flag someone down. Our check was also brought out before we requested it, which I always appreciate when I am on my lunch break. \n\nWe started out with some edamame, which is serves warm with a sprinkling of salt. We also tried the beef wrapped asparagus because a reviewer recommended it. It was ok, but I was there to eat fish not beef... so it was on to the rolls. We tried the Red Rock, a new roll called the Sexy something-or-other, Baked Philadelphia Roll and the Japanese Lasagna. All were very tasty. Some people may be turned off by the amount of sauce put on the rolls but I personally liked it. Rolls that come with sauces on top say so on the menu so if that's not your style, just ask the sushi chef to leave it off! \n\nFor desert we had the green tea tiramisu and the berry parfait. The blueberries on the parfait were still crunchy from being frozen, and the tiramisu wasn't really as good as I had hoped. But I was so stuffed from the sushi it's probably better for my figure that the deserts weren't to die for! \n\nI will certainly be revisiting Oyshi on another lunch break in the near future."

Pretty good deal, especially for how extensive their menu is.\n\nI wasn't really feeling like rolls, so I ordered and ate mostly nigiri -- so my 3 stars is based mostly on that. The pieces of fish were on the smaller side, and (obviously) the fish isn't the freshest you're going to find at a sushi joint (some of the uni looked a tad bit iffy, but I'm also on the paranoid side when eating raw stuff).

The AYCE price is equivalent to what I paid for my a la carte meal (as described below).\n\nAs for my experience, I ordered: miso soup with clams; a California roll; tuna sushi, salmon sushi, Cajun tuna sushi, and halibut sushi.

I was introduced to this sushi place by a friend of mines and went for the first time a couple of months ago. I have to say their appetizer menu is, by far, superior to all AYCE sushi places. Their surf and turf has this sweet and tangy sauce, it is served over a bed of shredded greens with steak and shrimp on a hot plate that is sizzling as it arrives. Their oysters are fairly good served with a bit of chili sauce and you can have max of 4. I have gone back to Oyshi about 3 times and this review is a collective of all the times I dined there. The first time I dined I ordered some salmon, tuna, yellowtail, nigiri. I was very very impressed with the quality and ratio of rice to fish. I asked the waiter what he would recommend as it was my first time dining there and he immediately chirped \"love affair\" you must have it. It was very very good. I do have to say it took them over 20 minutes to bring out my order of nigiri and even longer for the love affair roll. There were probably 10 people dining there. I was kind of confused as a couple that came after us got their roll first. I am normally a service junkie and if I don't get it I usually don't ever step back into the restaurant. This restaurant seemed like a place that deserved a second chance. I went another time with a group of 9 and were sat in a semi private area where the wall had a huge mural that seemed hand painted. We were seated and they took our orders. The wait wasn't as painful this time as they brought out the food fairly quickly. Once again, the love affair roll and my classic salmon, tuna and yellowtail nigiri were wonderful. The third time I went was pretty similar to the first time I dined here. The service was subpar and their food seemed to lack flavor. I have to say if their service was at par with how their decor is I would probably have given a higher rating, but without good service the clients will never return. Maybe they deserve another chance? I have to wait and see."

Some will say that service of the sushi is a tad slow but hey you get two hours. Who likes to be rushed when eating anyways? I enjoy food so I would like to enjoy it at a nice pace thank you.\nIf your with great company that gives some extra time for some intellectual exchange of words (conversation). Plus the two hours give enough time to let the rice settle a bit and enough time to try a good portion of the menu.\n\nThe service might be a tad slow but the workers are always pleasant. I actually feel like I'm wanted there.. not like that other Asian restaurants..\nThey also are very knowledgeable with the menu which leads to great sushi suggestions.\n\nThe sushi at Oyshi I say is the best I've had in Las Vegas! \nI would like to suggest the RED ROCK ROLL due to the fact that it contains \"Orgasm Sauce.\"  The sauce is rightfully named this because it will climax your taste buds into ecstasy!\n\nConclusion.. YES!"

We would come at least once a month and hang out at the bar with David. Fast forward about a year...we finally went back to the place that brought us together. \n\nWe got here on a Saturday around 6 pm. Fairly busy but not packed. A lot of new faces, but David remembered us as well as the manager that runs the floor (not sure of his name). It felt pretty good to be remembered and it made the meal better! I cannot eat sushi right now, but everything looked fresh. My husband said it was good, but he didn't want to rub it in my face that I cannot eat raw sushi. Oyshi has always been on par with their fish and it definitely seemed that way on Saturday. \n\nI was able to order items from the kitchen luckily since they have a wide variety of cooked items. Calamari is good with their 2 different dipping sauces and as was their gyozas. I can't remember what else I ordered, but everything was fairly good. \n\nI will be back when I can get some real sushi into me again! Service has always been attentive and that hasn't changed. Oyshi is a winner!"

Tons of premium rolls, tons and tons of appetizer items (seaweed salad, asparagus tips), you can customize your own sushi, hand roll list is extensive.

            "review": "This place has changed a lot since I first went there. \nUni- I know not to expect too much from ayce uni, but the uni came out grey and slimy. \nOysters- the oysters were nice and big. They tasted fresh, and not overpowered with sauce. Probably the best dish. \nSurf & turf - bland and flavorless. The shrimp was super rubbery due to being over cooked.\nAGEDASHI TOFU- fried to a crisp, so when you cut into it.. the entire batter falls off. It should be light and easy to swallow.\nNIGIRI- fish quality was decent, but filled with a lot of rice. The amaebi tasted ok, but there is a part of the shrimp head that they don't clean off and discard. This makes it very difficult to enjoy, and sharp on the gums. \nAsparagus Beef- asparagus wasn't shaved down enough at roots, so you get the bad stringy part stuck in your teeth if it's possible to even bite off. \nBeef and asparagus, shrimp skewers - very dry, overcooked, flavorless. ( a waste of stomach space )\n\nOverall, really nothing special anymore. They don't allow half rolls which is unusual at an ayce spot. They seem to have cut the ayce app menu down a bit too. The service was good, and attentive. However, I would rather stick to umiya for ayce. They have a larger selection with much better quality."

It had good reviews so I had to plan to go the next time I was in Vegas. We went during lunch AYCE sushi which is not much different from dinners AYCE. I must say that the quality of the food deserves five stars. They offer a lot of interesting styles of rolls and also offer specials of the day that are included in AYCE. My test for all sushi restaurants I go to is the Salmon Skin Handroll. Oyshi passed with flying colors. The salmon skin was crispy. The seaweed was crunchy and not soggy from getting drenched with eel sauce to add flavor. Salmon skin roll is a simple roll but can easily be ruined if not done correctly. Since that turned out well, I was really looking forward to trying the wide selections of rolls that they offered on the menu. You pretty much have the whole menu to choose from including appetizers, salads and desserts for the AYCE. So if it's not just sushi you're craving, the AYCE is still an excellent choice. We will definitely go back to try the many different sushi & rolls we were to full to try."

An order to make it unique and enjoyable is by starting with the staff members on how to provide good customer service and take pride of what they representing. I am pretty sure the owner doesn't care as well because if he does he would take ownership and control of his restaurant sence this issue is been the same for majority the time this restaurant is been opened. Very disappointed long time waiting for appetizers and extremely slow service and lack of knowledge and skills from staff members as a whole restaurant aspect."

It's in my rotation for when I'm craving AYCE sushi but not in my top favorites I do prefer others a lot more. It's All You Can Eat sushi and you can really eat all you can eat that's at least until they cut you off. It's your typical AYCE sushi, they all are sushi grade and they make your typical sushi dishes everyone is doing. Not many items wowing me but still many items satisfying.\n\nThe bad about Oyshi is their spicy tuna, imitation crab usage, and kind of little nigiri and sushi rolls which is fine if you did AYCE cause you can just order more but not cool if you weren't. They have a lot of items you want to order but aren't available with AYCE. They seem to have a lot of rules.\n\nThe good about Oyshi is just about everything else. It's a place to go people watch late nights. Did I already mention their green tea cr\u00e8me brulee. I've been there just for it without ordering anything else and when I do AYCE, I'll make sure there's always room for it at the end. They serve some of their entrees on a sizzling hotplate, I do like the steaks and chicken. \n\nThey have a lunch special which includes a soup, salad, and your item of choice from various plates, there's a sushi plate, tempera plate, sashimi plate, and sizzle plate. It's not bad if your not wanting AYCE during lunch.\n\nThey offer all my favorites that I must have. They have oysters and uni but they're limited. They have shrimp tempera. They have poke, which like everyone else stretched out with other items. They have a good variety of specialty, tempera, baked, and fried rolls.\n\nDon't mine the clubbing music that's usually playing, even during lunch."

Everything was brought out on time and made well. Our waitress was nice and took our orders as quickly as possible and made sure each person got their orders right. My husband and I decided to try this place in the near future just the three of us when we can.\n\nformer review from 3 years ago:\n2 Stars\nHow this place ever got a vote for best sushi place in Las Vegas is beyond stupid. I know going there on father's day might have been a bad idea for AYCE. So 6 of us went in at 2pm. It was pretty full but people were starting to leave.\n Yes we were seated immediately ( Which explains 1 star) and our first order of rolls and appetizers came out quick enough ( 1 more star) but they didn't even bring out ALL the first orders. I ordered a pink lady and it didn't even come out until 40 minutes  and it was my 1/2 of my FIRST ROLL. Then when it came out it looked like a 6 yr. old just grabbed mayonnaise and some seafood and loosely rolled it in soy paper. It was so big it fell apart. They might as well have just jammed the thing in a rice bowl and given me a spoon.It also tasted like the seafood part was sitting out.\n  At least the waitress that helped us was apologetic. I'm not returning here ever and if I was invited to come here I would just decline. I still rather go to Sushi Bay off warm springs for their faster service and better variety of sushi"

It took another fifteen minutes on top of that for the waitress to take our order and another twenty minutes for us to get our sushi. I have heard of oyshi being one of the best sushi places in town, and while the sushi is good and tasty, in order for a restaurant (in my opinion) to have five worthy deserving stars the service needs to be as good as the food. That's minus star number one.\n\n And!.... You would think for an 'all you can eat' everything in the all you can eat section is all you can eat, right? Including the dessert? Well, I think not (not here at oyshi at least.) The dessert here is one per person only. Which technically isn't all you can eat. So it's basically all you can eat sushi, but not dessert. Haha. That would minus star number two. \n\nNow, on to the three yummy stars! When the sushi finally came, it was yum-O! With a capital last letter screaming O! The cajun albacore (thanks to a friend who recommended it at another sushi place) has become one of my favorites next to unagi. It's really full of flavor and I love how the center of attention goes to the fish, not the rice at the bottom. That gives plus one star.\n\nThe atmosphere in this restaurant is laid back. Both my boyfriend and I are laid back so the mood of the place set the mood for a relaxing time which is always much needed after a long busy week. Even their cutesy plate mats had designs of cutesy fonts and cutesy flowers. Haha. Guess what? Yes! You guessed it, another star for oyshi.\n\nFreshness in sushi is another thing I look for. And boy oh boy does oyshi serve it fresh. As fresh as the prince of bel-air. We had the 'love affair' which everyone kept yelping about. It's the kind of affair that makes you feel guilty because you think you are cheating on your significant other. Oh yea, it's that's good! Total of three stars for this modern looking sushi spot.\n\nI don't know if I'd come back though partly because of the service and partly because of my ever so longing for eating a lot of desserts. Well, I wouldn't say I don't know but maybe. Maybe the service is better than what we experienced in a different time or day. Maybe. A-ok review by me, but read other peoples reviews of this place. You may have a change of heart unlike me. =P"

Other than that, meh.\n\nThe service is the worst here. Good luck trying to just order for take out, they will look past you for 20 minutes until you ask them for help and even when they finally do, they will still ignore you because they have short attention spans.

Lol. I have tried other sushi places, but Oyshi is by far my favorite. I love their baked rolls and appetizers. My favorites are the hot tamale roll, the Japanese lasagna, spicy tuna crunch, potato croquette, egg rolls, Yellowstone, and quite a few others. The sushi chefs behind the bar are very nice. I rave about this place to basically everyone I know. Lol. It gets really busy during the normal dinner hours...which we typically try to avoid because it takes longer for each order to come out. The only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service is a hit or miss. Sometimes we get a really great server who is very attentive to us, but other times we sit there forever before a server finally notices us. Or they take forever to refill your drinks...or they take your first order and forget you're there. It is a little pricey, but so worth it! If you want to eat or try a lot of stuff, definitely go for the all you can eat!"

Not Oyshi!\nThankfully, this place stays open until 2AM (last call at 1:30 AM) and is perfect for folks working in the entertainment industry in Vegas.\n\nThe All-You-Can-Eat option is $27 at this place, and it is worth it! Though not as great as other AYCE places I have dined in, it still boasts a wide selection of rolls and hot food. \n\nI think my favorite roll was the Yellowstone Roll, which was an interesting Spicy Tune and Whitefish concoction that was topped with yum-yum sauce, jalapeno and CHEDDAR CHEESE. I haven't ever been to a place with cheddar cheese as a sushi topping.\n\nI do wish that the dessert was all you can eat as well, because I would have like two mochi balls instead of 1, but that's a small gripe.\n\nThe alcohol did seem relatively expensive. My buddy had a Sapporo and it was $7 or $8. That almost seems obscene.\n\nOn a positive note, Dad is not a huge sushi fan, so he opted for the Teriyaki Chicken Dinner. For $11, hhe had a Miso Soup, a Salad, a bowl of white rice and a HUGE steaming hot plate FULL of chicken teriyaki with hardly any vegetables. It was a fantastic deal!"

            "review": "So, after doing much research, hoping to find a great alternative to my usual spot for AYCE sushi, I decided on Oyshi, solely because of the great reviews I saw here on Yelp. \n\nI looked up the website, called and asked about prices, and finally my boyfriend and I decided to make the trip out. \n\nWe arrived at about 8:30pm, and it was a Friday night, so I expected it to be bustling. During our wait to be seated,  I scoped out the crowd, and noticed the usual. Mostly those under the age of 30, large groups of them in fact, and figured this must be their spot before they hit the clubs, considering their attire. Well, it was either that or the fact that the music in the restaurant sounded as if you were already in a night club. It must be set on Pandora or something. Anyway, it was only about a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all. \n\nSo, besides my observations of the restaurant ambiance and demographic, we finally were able to look at the menu. My boyfriend usually orders the nigiri, so we got the usual garlic tuna, albacore, cajun albacore, and decided to try the Oyshi scallops. As for the rolls, I decided on the Sibuya No Rice, Coco, and a Bonsai. I also decided to get the agedashi tofu, grilled beef asparagus, baked mussels and seaweed salad. This was only the first round after all.\n\nWe were excited to eat until the food arrived on our table. First the nigiri, the presentation was obviously not of any importance, but you can't judge a book by its cover, so we took a few bites anyway. \n\nVerdict, \n\nthe garlic tuna was DISGUSTING. It smelled and tasted like spoiled blood. I've had garlic tuna many times at many other restaurants, and this one had to be the worst. It even looked slimy, not because of the sauce, just itself.\n\nthe albacore was seared, and also tasted old. It had the same garlic sauce poured over it as the garlic tuna, and it was mushy.\n\nthe Oyshi scallops I thought were going to be \"OISHI\" but, definitely not. They mixed it with crab meat, and very light mayo, and it fell apart immediately as I tried to pick it up. \n\nthe cajun albacore had TOO MUCH cajun seasoning! I usually love cajun albacore, and this was too much for my palate, on top of that it was DRY.\n\nmy boyfriend got his usual spicy tuna hand rolls as well, and the spicy tuna looked a little spoiled. \n\non to the rolls,\n\nthe Bonsai, had the cajun albacore on it as well, but I had to bear it to see if the spicy tuna in the center was at least average. The roll as a whole was not to my liking.\n\nthe Coco, was probably the most decent roll on table, probably because each of the ingredients in it were fully cooked.\n\nthe Sibuya No Rice, again with the spicy tuna... eh.\n\nthe appetizers,\n\nthe agedashi tofu is usually my favorite appetizer!!! It came out looking as if it were just fried up, and I commend the presentation on this one, but the center was cold, the sauce was not tasty, and I hate that it is not \"bite-size\" as most Japanese cuisine is known to be. \n\nthe seaweed salad was not a bright green and although it was crispy, it had an ugly after taste, I've had better, let's just leave it at that.\n\nthe grilled beef asparagus was drizzled in teriyaki sauce. The asparagus was perfect, but the beef wrapped around it was dry somehow.\n\nthe baked mussels were not baked enough, and the yumyum sauce was pretty tasteless. \n\nI was disappointed already, but decided to take another round of appetizers, since I knew the sushi wasn't going to be very enjoyable. I settled for calamari, shrimp/veg tempura, edamame, asian style skirt steak, and some other things that were just not memorable enough.\n\nI knew it was bad when I was scarfing down edamame and tempura. The calamari looked good, but the dipping sauces  (ranch and a mayo/mustard mix) could have been more \"asian\" I guess? My boyfriend ate the skirt steak (aka Korean bulgogi, in my opinion). He even commented \"I'm eating beef, which is probably the last thing I would expect to eat at a Sushi restaurant.\"\n\nWith that said, it smelled as if something was burning the entire night we were there! \n\nHm, it was overall a disappointing experience.  We have both gone to many sushi restaurants, with my list including restaurants in Hawaii and San Francisco, California, and I wanted to seriously give this place a chance. Unfortunately, Oyshi just did not live up to the hype!\n\nOn a side note though, my waitress was very helpful, and service was mediocre, but that's about it."

I do not usually post reviews but this was by far the worst experience I had to say something. From the start our server was not very forth coming. Just him asking for our drinks was a bother to him. He could not even get through the entire table of 10 before he had to excuse himself and said he will be right back. We all looked at each other like wtf just happened?? Then when he finally took all of our drink orders he ended up forgetting one and it took forever to get him to bring that drink. \n\nWe figured we better get our order in right away since we were already afraid of what was to come. So our food started coming out and the runners that were delivering the food literally had no idea what each roll was. They came to the table and had the list of what was on their tray but didn't know which was which. So they just basically put the food on the ends of our table for us to figure out what each roll was for ourselves. This happened with each person that brought anything out to our table. It ended up A couple of us didn't even receive all of our rolls and we received a couple extra rolls that didn't even order. \n\nThis was about an hour into us being there and do you think we have received any refills on our drinks by now? One of our friends actually went to the bar and asked for a pitcher of water. Literally baffled at this point. \n\nNeedless to say at the end of the evening we asked to speak to a manager and the lady that was walking by at the moment that actually paid attention to us claimed to be the manager. We told her our concerns of the service and lack there of and how they did not know any of the food they were serving. She seemed like she had heard it before but was not willing to compensate us for our troubles. Only to offer us more dessert.

However, my experience at the Sahara location is so bad I was impelled to write this review! Tho the ambiance was nicer than the rainbow location, the customer service here is HORRIBLE! They are so slow! To make it much worse the male manager gives you a rude vibe. Boy, he needs some serious customer service training. I was gonna just ignore it thinking he might just be having a bad day, but the next few times our family came back he couldn't be more ruder(if there's such a word) \n\nAnyway, I promised myself  I will never set foot in that location again! I love Oyshi so I will be loyal to the rainbow location only! \n\nThey just lost my business!"

I was surprised that although their menu selection had a vast array, their portion is very tiny as if feeding children. Service was fair, but the overall impression for me was the size of the sushi. I was very surprised that it was only 1/3 the size of what I normally order here in Hawaii. You're eating in Vegas therefore, you'd expect their size to be at least normal, but that's what you get when they want to be cinchy, frugal, or should I say tight . Now I wonder if their fish was actually fresh or previously frozen!"

But I tried this place, and I have JUST NOW recovered physically enough from the worst food poisoning I've ever heard of to write this review.\n\nWe got the all you can eat for a late dinner.  The sushi was fine, as far as I can remember.  I ordered oysters, two of them came in a little plate.  I slurped down the first one, and it tasted like a corpse soaked in brine.  Since I shoot raw oysters, it was already in, and I figured, what are the odds the second one will taste like that too?  MISTAKE.  I told my dining companions, \"Wow these taste like they've been dead for a while...\"  I forgot about it and moved on.\n\nThat night, my friend (who didn't have oysters) woke up around 1 or 2 am and puked.  She said she was fine the next day.  I was totally fine and figured her puny weakling stomach must've just not been able to handle the onslaught of all you can eat sushi.  I went about my day like a naive, unsuspecting fool.\n\nWednesday, around 4:00 pm.  In my office.  The rumblings of gastric distress started to bubble.  I had cooked my usual breakfast, and gotten a sandwich from my usual place.  I thought maybe the sandwich wasn't sitting right.  Within 20 minutes or so my vision started hazing, and my stomach started blowing up like that blueberry chick from willy wanka.  I felt nauseous.  Made it to my car and sped home, feeling sicker and sicker.\n\nI bolted to my toilet and JUST made it in time as a violent torrent of vomit erupted from my face like a hurricane.  Violent wretching for several mintues, and then I slumped into my bed, exhausted.  However, there would be little sleep over the next 12 hours.  Every 10 to 15 minutes I would have explosive, violent, searing diaherrea like a poop volcano.\n\nIt started to feel dangerous after a full day of this, so I got myself to a hospital. I was diagnosed with a deadly food bacteria present in dirty seafood and prescribed antibiotics. As I got in my car to drive home I projectile vommitted in my car. I had to call a friend to take me home and pick up my meds. I was unable to get out of bed for a full 6 days, except to crawl on hands and knees to destroy my toilet every half hour or so.\n\nNeedless to say I will never eat here again.  I also can't see myself eating oysters ever again. Feeling thankful for modern medicine because this is the ish people die from.\n\nNEVER FORGET. NEVER AGAIN."

I loved the modern, spacious atmosphere inside. Our waiter (Ray) was very courteous and overall service was nothing to complain about. I went for the AYCE and was not disappointed. For nigiri I got several orders of salmon and halibut. I can't describe how fresh it all tasted. The sashimi just melted in my mouth which I can't say has happened before so I knew this place was the real deal. I also got the salmon avocado hand roll which was also quite good. The last thing I got was the Yellowtail Trio roll which also tasted very fresh and flavorful. Of course I couldn't leave without dessert so I got the green tea creme brulee.

The deep variety of choices on their menu provides both cooked and raw choices for a varied crowd of people to be able to come together and share a Japanese style menu even though some guests don't indulge in eating raw seafood.\n\nTheir traditional sushi is so skillfully prepared that their yellow tail at times seems to just melt in your mouth.  They have so many varieties of rolls that a first time visitor could spend quite a while choosing from their assortment.\n\nAfter years of coming here I can recommend some of my favorites.\n\nThe Rainbow Roll is a traditional California roll topped with a variety of seafood (tuna, salmon, yellow tail) in a mouth watering colorful display.\n\nFor a spicy roll, I enjoy the Red Rock.  It's a roll filled with spicy chopped salmon, served with a spicy mayo type topping. It's not the I have to drink water type of heat, but it has just enough heat not to blow out you taste buds.\n\nIf you're a soft shell crab lover, I highly recommend the Spider Roll.  The Spider roll contains fried soft shell crab parts layered in a crab mixture, placed in a roll.  It's slightly warm, extremely tasty, and the crunch from the soft shelled crab provides a delicious mild crunch to a roll that you just cant get enough of.\n\nThe all you can eat selection also includes tempura selections as well as rib eye steak served sliced in smaller pieces, with onions on a sizzl'n hot metal based plate. If you are still able to handle dessert, they offer a sunday or moche with the all you can eat option.\n\nBeer, Cocktails, assorted beverages and hot tea (at additional prices) are available.\n\nTheir all you can eat lunch price is slightly lower than their dinner price, so you can expect to pay approximately 25 per person for lunch and 30 per person for dinner. Of course you could purchase off the menu for lighter appetites."

Somewhere after two orders it took 35mins to get someone's attention to make another order and another 20 for someone to tell us they're making it. Our server never came back after he initially got lost, but came back to tell us \"sorry that's the way it works.\" Bullshit. Tried to be understanding seeing as they were shorthanded, but then again the restaurant was only half full and 2 servers and 2 runners walking around. Not our fault they were understaffed. The other sad thing is not everyone in the service industry is taught customer service and it clearly showed here today. Obviously won't be returning even though one of the servers(not ours) tried to repair the situation as much as he could. Too bad because the food was decent albeit it got sloppy as the meal went on."

Both times we have had a great meal, and it has been a lot of fun!!\n\nThe first time was for lunch, we did not partake in the All-You-Can-Eat option, rather just ordered a few rolls and apps. The waiter was so friendly and enthusiastic we decided to bring a few people who were visiting back for Dinner.\n\nNow for dinner, hell yes we all did the All-You-Can-Eat! It was $27 bucks each, awesome. We were committed to taking them down! One roll at a time! OK, so we did not end of doing that, but we has a super fun night with lots of great food!\n\nOur waiter Kenny was a rock star! We were goofing and laughing with him all night! And we had a lot to laugh at, because apparently the new food runners had not quite figured out the table numbers and kept delivering our food to other tables, and vice-a-versa. I know this sounds annoying, but oddly enough it became part of the entertainment of the night. Kenny kept checking in to see what we were still waiting for, and making sure it came. We were never missing sushi on the table or going hungry, he just had to order a couple specific rolls 2-3 times before they finally made there way to us. We had a blast!\n\nInsider tips....\n-They do take reservations, but the only way to make them is to actually speak to a hostess. The girl at the front desk admitted to me they never check the answering machine. \n\n-They have an awesome large room if you want to have an AYCE shushi party! It is separated from the Dining Room and looks super cozy!\n\n-Last tip, AYCE is less during lunch. Only $22, as opposed to dinner time when it is $27"

Each of the chefs here are magicians in their own right, Sam and Leo are great, but Ed is by far our go to guy!

My 6 year old daughter loves sushi and our sever made her smile and enjoy her visit especially when he brought her out a ice cream sundae after asking me if it was okay for him to bring her sweets . Visit was great what I'm about to say aren't really complaints just opinions \n\n-the twist on this place is modern and hip to were I'm more use to \"traditional\" sushi , not a negative thing just saying my opinion and a tip to people who aren't use to places that have a modern twist . \n\n-the ice cream was yummy but I personally enjoy my green tea ice cream plain no chocolate syrup whipped cream or granola necessary . So for people who don't want all that on it just request none of that . \n\n-THE CHEF I want to say his name was Nacho , charming and very nice and good imagination with rolls . Whole time I was just eating what ever he was creating because menu was a little overwhelming (not a bad thing) but I was inpatient and starving from the gym lol so I just wanted any food in front of me and I felt a little daring so I decided to put my trust in my sushi rolls to him lol everything was yummy !! but ONLY tip would be make smaller portions so I can try all your inventions next time I'll mention it :) \n\nWill be returning soon :)"

I thought I'd try it out again but it still didn't impress me. Their selection of sushi wasn't the best. Although the fish was fresh, I still had a hard time picking which rolls to order. I'm not a fan of spice or complex rolls and their rolls were mostly spicy and rolls that included ingredients that I am not a fan of. I wish I had gone some place else especially for the price I paid."

It's been a month since I paid over $100 for an all-you-can-eat for 2 and looking back, it taught me a few things.\n\nMy friend and I are currently on the hunt for great sushi places in town and this being the closest to our homes, we made it our first stop. I have fond memories of the previous sushi place that took up this space and for some reason, I was expecting the same quality food and service. \n\nAfter having waited about 10-15 minutes for a seat in a half empty restaurant, we approached the hostesses in haste when we saw more recent customers led to a table before us. We had a young female server that busy Friday night. Famished from work, we were ready to go on a devouring spree which started with a plate of edamame. The fun began with their specialty rolls such as the red rock, red dragon, and surf 'n' turf - my favorite. The surf 'n' turf consisted of a thin slice of rib eye steak placed above the roll and a shrimp tempura tucked inside. Great combination topped with eel sauce, if I remember well.\n\nThings went downhill from there. We should've just eaten all the sushi we wanted before getting dessert. Back then, I didn't know if 1 dessert per person was the rule of thumb for all sushi buffets but it certainly shocked us when our server gave us our check after cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. We gave over half in cash and said to charge the rest on my card but the whole amount was charged on my card and the cash was also taken in. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought it might have been a flimsy mistake. After getting in touch with the manager, our cash was refunded, but only after much hassle to the restaurant and ourselves. \n\nThe food quality was good but some improvement could be made to service. Might come back again."

I had to keep drinking water as I ate because their sushi would make my mouth dry and the rice would stick. The fish and rice ratio was way off. The fish is cut thin with a thick compressed dry rice underneath. All I eat is nigiri so it's sad that I didn't reorder nigiri for my second round. \n\nThe options here are a little limited compared to other AYCE sushi spots. \n\nThe inside is very clean and spacey which I really liked. The service was great. They were fast and always came by to ask if we wanted to order more. \n\nMaybe I came on a off day but I didn't like this second visit here!"

Not sure what was going on but the hostess was not having it, she was not friendly and seemed annoyed having to seat us. She also helped ran food to our table and same attitude, grumpy and not happy, made us feel uncomfortable. \n\nOur server was very nice, made recommendations and our drinks were constantly re-filled throughout our meal. \n\nThey have nice variety of rolls, lot of appetizers and other dishes you can order as part of your AYCE which is great. Rolls were pretty good, some better than others but overall I had a satisfied meal. \n\nI have been to other places where the dinner price was lower and it comes with oysters, uni and sweet shrimp. $27 is pretty expensive for AYCE, especially since there are so many other AYCE places that offer similar options. \n\nOverall, it was nice to try the place since my friend comes here all the time and she wanted me to try it out, but it wasn't as great of an experience for me. The hostess was the first turn off, and although the food was good I can go elsewhere for similar items but a little cheaper."

The hostess seated our party of three quickly and our waitress took great care of us.\n\nDid the AYCE option (and upgraded to the dinner option) since it was cheat day for one of our friends so we could ordered items only available for the dinner AYCE price. So we ordered all the dinner only items and the assorted nigiri that we often ordered. Every thing was great. Service from the sushi bar was quick and before long we were almost too stuffed to ordered desserts.\n\nThe one thing I have to constantly remember to do when dining at most Korean-operated sushi restaurants is to ask the chef to go easy on the sauce or serve it on the side for all of the specialty rolls. But that is completely a personal preference thing.\n\nBaked Mussels were a good appetizer to start our meal.\n\nSeared Salmon Nigri - yum\n\nSalmon Skin + Fresh Salmon and Ikura Handroll - make sure they put all the ingredients in one hand roll and not make three different ones.\n\nUnagi Nigiri - good, but even better if slightly more caramelized.\n\n A la carte options, Lunch Specials are also available for anyone not in the mood for AYCE."

Upon entering the place was fairly quiet with the exception of a screaming child, no big deal, and the normal chatter of customers. We came in around 1 on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. We put in an order for the AYCE almost immediately and began waiting. It was nearly 25 minutes before we received our first things, we were told the kitchen was backed up, yet when we got our food the calamari was cold, flavorless, and rubbery. My baked roll was cold. When I asked the server if it was supposed to be at least warm, I was given the run around and he finally said it had been sitting while waiting for the other things to finish and that he could get me a new one but it'd be another 20 minutes! I agree and when 20 minutes came it was just as cold as the first time. The manager didn't seem to care and almost everyone else was getting their food in a timely manner except for us. In total we ordered 5 rolls and 1 appetizer (3 of the rolls and the appetizer being ordered in the first 5 minutes of being there) and that was in the span of an hour and a half. even after all that we were given a half ass sorry from the manager and still paid full price. This place is completely over rated and I will stick with a different sushi restaurant that is more reliable and friendly. Too bad because the place was nicely decorated but that's about as far as it went."

Service here is sometimes a hit or miss, personally I prefer when girls serve me because they're more attentive and provide better customer service than when I have a male server. I've been here many times that sometimes I'm greeted with \"welcome back!\" I normally recommend this place to friends or old co workers, and that says A LOT since I used to be a server at another sushi restaurant and I preferred this place over my old work. Keep in mind that I would get half off on everything at my old work but I would rather pay full price for better quality sushi over at Oyshi. \nTip: check out their daily specials by the sushi bar!~"

So you feel like you're in some cavernous spot, and when it's bright & sunny out it kinda feels weird. However, if you like that sort of thing, then have at it.\nOur Server, Rey, was pretty awesome! His energy & enthusiasm was the light in this cave. We ordered a few things then based off his suggestion, we ordered a different roll. Nice one too! \nThe Food Runner, I found myself helping him out. Like when we delivered the edamame, rather than attempting to place it in the middle of the table, he placed it off to my side, because there were a few things in the way. In my experience, yes I have worked in restaurants, when that happens, you set the dish down, make room, then place the dish in the center. However, that was his kind of thing, literally, just bring the food out. Didn't add to the experience, was just there.\nOh but wait! The food! Yes, we did eat here. The sushi wasn't bad. For being our first time, and we only ordered 4 out of the tons of options! Again, I've had my share of sushi and the staple of a roll is the consistency of the rice. It has to be sticky. It has to hold it all together with the help of the seaweed. Well, flavor wise, the rolls were good. Like seriously. The rice was just meh. It wasn't terribly sticky. Some parts were a little brittle & dry. No, not the worst thing, just not the best.\nNow here's the AWESOME part. The have all you can sushi for $20! Yup! $20!! I can do and be experiencing this little feature for sure! Of course I'll be trying more sushi options for sure! Plus, what other way can you experience a spot with an all you can option??? It's on!"

Hehe) Let me start off by saying that I've never been to the other Oyshi location so I'm not here to compare or anything like that.\n\nSo, the interior is just GORGEOUS! High ceilings, beautiful decor, bold, gorgeous color. The tables, benches and chairs are comfortable and spacious. Our hostess greeted us with a smile and our server Kyle, was just as delightful. He was so sweet and nice and accommodated us very well. Always checked up on us, with a smile every time. \n\nNow on to the food. Divine! I've had a lot of sushi and Japanese food, in general and this place is one of the best I've ever been to. Food quality is amazing. The fish was so fresh and sushi never broke apart (Sadly, I've been to a lot that does & it's not pleasant). Hot foods came to us really hot so we knew they were freshly cooked. I loved it!\n\nOh & the best part would have to be the price. AYCE lunch was $21.95. For the classiest, yummiest, Japanese food, that is inexpensive! Sushi items seemed endless so you'll have a variety on top of the kitchen items. And please, please, please, try the Green Tea Creme Brulee & Green Tiramisu. Eating them was.. love at first bite!"

The fish was fresh enough, but when the rice is twice the size of any AYCE sushi out there, it seems to not be worth it. I ate mainly nigiri. The waiter was apologetic enough, though he forgot many orders. Service was painfully slow, and I started to think it was a tactic strategy so i will eat less since there were 15 minute gaps. Plus only one dessert? I normally have 2, which I always eat since portions are usually small. Needless to say, I will not be coming back even if it is 2 blocks away."

I'm very picky about quality when it comes to sushi, it's not like a burger where you can deal with it being mediocre. I started coming to this place about three years ago when it was operating under another name, but it's always had the same great quality and taste. \n One thing I will say I did not like before was the service. It seemed like they didn't assign a server to your table, so you would just have all these confused servers asking you what you wanted, or needed, and having your order come out with occasional mistakes, and the constant interruption of people not knowing when you were last checked on. It's gotten much better over the years and I can see business has picked up a lot. \n  I always tell my friends from out of town to try this place instead of somewhere on the strip which costs 3x as much. \n  To whom it may concern: keep up the great work in the kitchen, and focus on a more personalized floor experience. We don't want to have 5 servers for our table, just one really good one. Thanks for all the great food, we'll be seeing you."

The salmon avocado had minimal to no avocado in it.. And the tuna was regular not seared Some of the pieces you couldn't even see the avocado in it.  We sent it back and witnessed one of the sushi chefs argue with his manager insisting he wouldn't remake it.. After like 5 more minutes of arguing with his manager in front of customers he reluctantly remade the roll but then proceeded to stare me and my date down from behind the counter.  Naturally I had had enough and summoned the manager.  Manager seemed more bothered than actually concerned on making it right and made no effort. He pretty much stood up for the chef that had previously been arguing with him.  He said that managers arguing with their employees is \"typical restaurant environment\" This is a complete disappointment as we are regular oyshi 1 customers, the other location and service and food is great."

Considering every place we went in Vegas was wonderful and the service incredibly good, it was quite a contrast that the service at Oyshi was so poor.  I didn't like the server because his language and behavior was like high school kid.  I understand a $50 meal for two isn't luxury, but it isn't cheap.  Also we tried to wave at him 3-4 times and he wouldn't acknowledge we were there.  It takes the fun out of going to a buffet.  I wonder if management does this on purpose so people don't eat too much.  We eventually changed servers, but I felt like they didn't care that much.  In my whole life, I've never felt angry at a restaurant.  Honestly, I get more polite and better service at McDonald's.  At times the server was just talking to his friends, the cook about girls.  We felt uncomfortable at this place and just left after a few dishes.  It was a waste of money and no one likes to do that.  Food is fine for this kind of thing so no complaints there.  But it's important for customer to feel comfortable at a restaurant.  Do not go here.  Literally every other worker and server and person in Vegas we met was awesome, had a wonderful time.  But this restaurant was a bad experience."

But this must be said: I love Oyshi Sushi on Sahara. \n\nIF you come here often, you learn the pace and the chefs will learn your taste and it's like chocolate and peanut butter: magic will happen.\n\nIf you come here thinking you've got the most sophisticated sushi palate on the planet, take your stuck-up self somewhere else. Because this AYCE is not about how much uni or conch or surf clam you can talk them into giving you. It's about sitting at the sushi bar and biting into creative hand rolls that are handed to you by hand - enjoying the crackle of the toasted nori cone and having a cool time with a team of what are probably the coolest sushi chef personalities in the city. It's about enjoying the game on the generously-sized HDTVs while experiencing awesome service. My water cup / green tea cup is NEVER empty here - that is a rare thing, especially at an AYCE sushi spot!\n\nMy favorite kitchen item is their deliciously tender and flavorful 'Asian Skirt Steak' served sizzling on a bed of onions and cabbage (included in AYCE), solid apps and skewers (also included) as well as appealing gyoza (steamed or fried) and other standard \"Midwestern\" Japanese kitchen items are all included.\n\nNot a fan of the species of oysters they serve (and I love oysters) - weird texture - so I just don't order them anymore. There are plenty of other things I like ordering. Fresh scallop sushi (better than Sushi Koma's), the 'Monster' hand roll (soft shell crab, eel, spicy crab, avocado) and a few other secret items that I'm not going to disclose because I don't want them to be out of them the next time I go, which is currently once-a-week whenever possible.\n\nThis place is the jam.

As for sides the ginger didn't taste fresh at all or the wasabi. The service was very spotty, the server forgot to refill my water quite a few times and the Resturant wasn't even that busy. The ambience is decent and nice. Not to ostentatious or to subtle but a nice complement to setting the mood right for a memorable night out. \n\nAll in all the place is average at best in terms of price and service. The plus point and a huge reason to return is the roll have a new fresh take on them and many of sound good to try, there is too many to try by yourself. Bring 7 people with you on your quest for something new and exciting. Some rolls will be forgettable kind of like their service but others will leave you lost in a sea mind numbing, thought altering perception. Definite place to try if you are up for something new."

Our server's name was Junua, and I wish I could say one good thing about him. He was emotionless, unhelpful & scarce majority of our stay... to order or get refills from him was so difficult. It started with asking for more Splenda since all of the ones given were crunchy from being wet previously & dried. All downhill from there. The place wasn't even busy with only 4 other tables. No excuse honestly.\n\nWe ordered our usuals. I don't think it's bias, but the chefs here are just not as good as the rainbow Oyshi location. The ASIAN SKIRT STEAK was dry, the LOVE AFFAIR had not as much lobster & crab but excessive crunch flakes, and the AHI POKE was bland. The GREEN TEA PARFAIT had rock hard granola & was drenched with strawberry syrup. I couldn't even enjoy it. In terms of what was decent? The MONSTER ROLL, SPICY TUNA & SALMON NIGIRI were good.\n\nOh, they no longer have white tuna on their menu... and apparently there is a one order limit on their baked mussels and they have crossed out the \"multiple orders allowed\" on their ice cream? I thought this was all-you-can-eat? Lol. I think we are officially done with this place. Aside from the extremely cute decor and fun playlist, it's no wonder this place isn't busy on a Saturday.\n\n*SIDENOTE: He had no name tag on (young black guy), but shoutout to the sweet busser who was friendly and far more accommodating than our server Junua ever was. Get that boy a raise! Our busser honestly is responsible for this being a 2 star rating instead of just 1! We appreciate you, sir."

I wasn't sure whether I order sushi or rice.  \n\nThen we ordered 2 kinds of rolls and another seaweed salad during eating it. As you can see in other people's reviews, this place's services sometimes very slow. I expected that seaweed salad can be served right a way because they do not have to cook. We called our server and he just said it will be coming so no rush. Then the seaweed salad came out when we are almost done. You know, seaweed salad is just salad and probably most people eat seaweed salad with other main dishes. That time, we were almost finished so we couldn't finish our seaweed salad. \n\nAnd finally, we asked for check and told our server that we are all finished. Then he said that he has to charge for leftovers which were 2 peices of roll and seaweed salad. And it will be the normal price, $8, which is regular price for the roll and $5 for seaweed salad. I knew there are leftover charges but I didn't know that they will charge the normal prices. Isn't that means we can take out leftovers when we charge normal prices? But it was also fine. I knew I have to pay for the leftovers because it is AYCE so I said okay we will pay. And he brought check with only extra $5 for seaweed salad. Okay I appreciate with it.\n\nWe were disappointed with sushi, slow service, and leftover charge. Then we pay the tip only $1. I know it is kinda rude, but today, I didn't really want to tip them. Then we came out from OYSHI SUSHI. \n\nTHE REAL PROBLEM IS THIS. GUESS WHAT. \nOUR SERVER FOLLOWED US AND STARTED TO YELL AT US AND SAID F**KING A** HOLE, F**K YOU AND KEEP SWEAR AT US\n\nBefore that, we thought today was not really good so we should come again and enjoy our meal but once we hear that the server yelling and swear at us, I thought  tip him $1 was execellent choice. \n\nI know it is not really manner put $1 for tip. But what kind of manner is that? Even though he was upset with us that we put a dollar for tip, that does not mean that he should say FU*K YOU AT CUSTOMERS. MC.DONALD'S WILL HAVE BETTER SERVICE THAN THAT!!!!!!!!!\nMay be he wants too, I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK THERE WITH PAYING 26-27 DOLLARS TO GET THE WORD FU*K."

The servers and wait staff make you feel welcome and they don't act like they are doing you a favor when taking your order and delivering the good. Our favs were spicy tuna, ika with shiso, and unagi. The ambiance in this restaurant is comfortable- high ceilings, subtly decorated, and very spacious. This place beats Goyemon hands down. The only downside is that you are limited to one dessert per customer. If I have a craving for AYCE sushi, this will be my go to place."

The amaebi was literally spoiled and the oysters cannot even be classified as oysters. I understand if the food is not good, it is not the servers' fault. But lack of service when the place is not really busy is their own thing. My sister in law's soda glass was literally empty for a good 15 minutes. No servers are walking around, checking on us. We had to practically beg for the attention of the servers. We feel sick due to the food, but the service was just literally lagging. I will not come again. Sorry, Oyshi."

The place was slow due to the day of the week I suppose but the staff was wonderful. I recently started eating sushi so struggled what to order and Nacho, Pertro, Andy, and Roberto were more than accommodating to helping me with my decisions. My waitress Kim was quite assertive and checked in often to make sure we were pleased. Here perky personality made me smile. \nTanya was not our waitress but still checked in on us. It isn't often you find a place that the staff is friendly and keeps you laughing your entire stay. Found my new sushi addiction!! Must also add the staff is very easy on the eyes......

On a Wednesday night we did AYCE we were here for over 2 1/2 hours because of absolutely awful service(I actually took a 15-20min nap at the table and still nothing had changed)! Multiple times we waited over an hour for food, the times we got food it was the food runner throwing random stuff we didn't want or order and she would ignore us and run off before we could say anything. Table was never cleared until almost 2 hours in. Had to get up at times and get someone to help us so we could get refills on water or put in an order for more food we would have to wait forever for. Then after all this the manager didn't even care! Just said sorry very unapologetically and had to almost argue to get a discount on the meal that we most definitely deserved. Very disappointing. I had always liked this place and now I don't know if I will ever eat here again because of this experience which sucks because the food is always good :/"

We could of gone to our favorite place Naked Fish but they don't have AYCE and I wanted to take my sister to a place she never been.\n\nGet there around 7pm.... Its not busy so I figure PERFECT even better don't have to wait for table or probably wait long for our food.... WRONG!!!!!!!  They sat us down but we wanted a lil more quiet area so we can catch up.  Asked to sit at the table where I always sit with my family.  That corner table was like a fridge!!!!  My sis asked to see if they can turn off vents above us or do something, the woman server said its just the fan only and will have it lowered.   .... Said we will both have AYCE and that it was my sisters 1st time here so she showed her menu and what was not part of the AYCE.  We ordered 3 order of shrimp tempura n poke and other items.  Got the items but no poke n tempura... Place our 2nd round order and questioned where is the surf n turf, tempura n poke.....\" Oh its coming \"..... Asked Manager for another beer with 2 cold glasses n again stated we waiting on 2 surf n turf.... Finally he brings it out NOT SIZZLING n not hot!!  While other table in corner has there's coming out sizzling n smoking??!!!!!  My sis looked at me like WTF??!!!!  ALL DURING THIS TIME ITS STILL COLD AS F**K AND OUR FOOD WAS GETTING COLD BY THE SECOND!!!!!  Ask server in jokingly way if there's a jacket or blanket since its still cold.... She said I'll tell them to lower the fan.  Ummmm weren't u suppose to do that when we 1st sat down????  ..... Placed 3rd round, asked BTW we still waiting on our shrimp tempura and poke!!...... FINALLY GOT IT but only 2 orders of shrimp tempura!  At this time we were cold AF so stepped out to warm up.  Came back in and server said we turned off the fan for you.  ????.... After fact we sat here over an hour?????  So we order dessert vanilla creme brul\u00e9 which was good but we were still cold AF!!  Fan stop but a/c still felt like it was blasting only on us??!!!  NEVER have I ate there in that same spot and was that cold nor felt any type of draft on me!!!  .... By this time I was furious since we had to ask numerous times for our food plus while placing our order there was a long period of time to receive our food and let me remind you IT'S SLOOOOOOW!!!!!!   It been busier before and I had better service!  ......\n\n Wrote a note on my receipt and HAND DELIVERED TO THE MANAGER!  NOW LET ME SAY THIS, I'VE DEALT WITH HIM TWICE PRIOR TO THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND HE WAS NICE AND VERY SOCIAL MAKING SURE WE WERE HAPPY WITH OUR EXPERIENCE THERE.  \"THIS TIME\" HE HAD AN ATTITUDE OF A DEBBIE DOWNER IDGAF ATTITUDE!!  NEVER ONCE SMILED OR ASK HOW'S THINGS GOING..... WHEN I PERSONALLY GAVE HIM MY TAB AND SAID THERE'S A NOTE IN IT ALL I GOT WAS A \"OK\"?!!!!  WHAT A POOR SORRY UNPROFESSIONAL MANAGER TO HAVE AT A RESTAURANT!  WHERE'S YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS????  NEVER BOTHERED TO ASK A QUESTION OR TRY TO RECTIFY THE HORRIBLE EMBARRASSING SERVICE WE RECEIVE AND IN FACT THAT I RAVED ABOUT THIS PLACE ON THE WAY THERE TO MY SISTER TO ONLY BE ASHAMED I TOOK HER THERE!!!  .....

They also have an extensive menu and even offer uncommon items like Natt\u014d (fermented soybeans).

The scallops were okay and it came with two sauces; some kinda mustard and I believe ranch.  Otherwise the fried scallops alone didn't have too much flavor or spice like wasabi batter or something.  Didn't meet my expectations but I dealt with it.  Eating it took me a while, but it gave me enough time to chat with Kat and her hubs about the restaurant ambience :P\n\nThis is the 3rd restaurant that I've found to have AYCE.  Nice foldable menu and good basic selections.  Salmon belly nigiri was good.  I found their fish to be on the dry side for the other nigiris as served.  Cool thing is their portions are bite size.  For my main roll I ordered the Love Affair... oooouuuu SO NOT sexyyyy either.  It looked like a mound of imitation crab mixed with crispies and lobster bits dumped on top of the cut rolls, hiding beneath the chaos.  But the flavor was good.\n\nNice that the restaurant has space for larger groups and separate dining areas.  The tall ceilings, creative wood designs, lighting, and paint art captured my attention the most.  Just to note too, walking into any Japanese restaurant I'm used to being greeted by the chefs or workers.  Here they have it modernly designed on the entrance wall - no joyous welcoming shouts...\n\nOur waiter had a tiny misunderstanding with our separate tabs.  Also took a couple reminders for drink refills.  I shall end my review with a fair nod.  I might come back however it will not be my first choice for AYCE.  I wanted to have a taste of their green tea creme brulee.  Mission accomplished and I will say that their green tea creme brulee by itself is deserving of 5 stars."

They had both chair and tables and half booths with chairs too. The bar is pretty small and seats around 8-10. \n\nService:  It was very slow when we arrived, and it seems when restaurants are really slow, they tend to forget to check on their guests. They were friendly and helped when you asked, but I felt I had to flag them down too many times from their little congregation at the hostess booth. I'd give the service a 3 star rating.  \n\nFood:  the food was good. The $22 AYCE lunch does not include the sashimi, so that was a disappointment. They also don't serve oysters, uni or sweet shrimp for lunch. We ordered calamari, veggie tempura, spicy tuna roll, gyoza, seaweed salad, mussels, Cali salmon roll, snow mountain, a few other rolls they ordered I don't remember. \nA special shout out to the dynamite, which actually had a teriyaki flavor, the Tempura shrimp, the atomic bomb roll, and this fabulous cucumber salad called sumomono, which was a nice palate cleanser. \n\nOverall:  this was a pretty good lunch. Not my fav AYCE sushi place, but nice enough where I would come back with friends again."

He should probably give up serving and be a sushi chef because the service was terrible. His excuse at the end was that he was training two other new servers. The craziest part was there was NO manager in the whole place to correct any of the issues we had! You bet he added gratuity to the check at the end though! We all happen to work in the industry, most of us down on the strip and this wouldn't fly where we work. We all sat down and ordered all you can eat around 7:30 pm. The gap between drink service and ordering was pretty long. Ok so we can handle that I guess. When we finally were able to order food came out and half of it was missing throughout this long dragged out dinner. We were missing rolls, appetizers and soup. We mentioned it a few times but we never got it. By 9:23 we were so annoyed we asked for separate checks. Now we had told him this from the beginning. I know I'm use to producing and running up to 20 separate checks at a time and it takes me about 8 min to separate them and then another 8 to process payments. We timed it and literally did not get our check back till 10pm when we all started to head up to the front of the restaurant just so we could get out of there. No apologies, no compensation and 18% added to the checks. Food was average for what we were able to try because half of it didn't come out. Stay away from this location. They just take your money and waste your time!"

It seemingly looks good, but upon further inspection, it's clear that something isn't right -- dirty plates, strange Saran wrapped bottles at the bar.\n\nFOOD\nThe quality of fish is definitely low-brow. I believe we saw signs for all-you-can eat-options, so it's expected I suppose, but just don't get your hopes up. \n\nSHOUT OUT\nThe Volcano Roll comes Honey-boo-boo style.\n\nSERVICE\nHorrible. The waiter always came to our table apologizing when he didn't do anything and that's when he actually came to our table. Please invest in training your staff, or continue to see these reviews about your service. \n\nAFTERMATH\nIt's probably best you go somewhere else if you know what I mean."

The ambience was agreeable- it's spacious unlike other places with an open floor for general seating. Along the side were tables to accommodate larger groups and booths for added comfort. I was impressed with their design for the outer tables. They were more secluded but not completely shut off from then general population for privacy.\nFor this review, I will based if off the last time I went for my younger brothers birthday. We had about 15 people. It was easy to make reservations and they had given us their largest table in the back which was a more intimate setting which I liked given the size of our group. The service was on point. Our server (who I forgot his name) would check up on us from time to time where I didn't need to go looking for him. I appreciate that. He did have two others who assisted him with out addition orders/refills. They were very accommodating to our group, given I bought a cake and they provided us with all that we needed. \nThe quality of the food was great both the sushi and meat. AYCE sushi and all types of steak? Hell yea! \nThe only thing I need to address is the quality of one of their desserts that originally when the company opened up was to die for at least for me. Their parfait dessert is ridiculous now. It needs to either be taken off the menu or don't call it a parfait at all. Majority of it is ice cream then there's a few pieces of fruit which I can count, syrup and whip cream. It would be great if they brought back how they originally made it.\nMy family and I love eating here and we will be coming back when the cravings take over. Overall, Oyshi is one of my family and I's top sushi places to go to! A must try!"

The sushi chef that helped us at the bar was very friendly and conversational.  Since we're new to Vegas, he even suggested some good places to go check out for recreational purposes.  We'd recommend this restaurant and will likely return, but will probably check out other places in town (since there are soooooo many options).  If you're nearby, I'd definitely say it's worth the stop.  Here's the rundown on food:\n\nThings we tried that I'd recommend:\nRattlesnake Roll - good stuff, great combo of flavors\nOyshi Roll - the signature roll lives up to it's role - a must-have\nGyoza - order it pan-friend (even though they only list deep fried & steamed)\nChung Hua - Probably my favorite roll of the night\nNuclear Bomb - chef made this when we requested one of his choices - not for the weak tongued.  This one's very spicy and tasty!\nYellowstone - really great baked roll\nAhi Poke Salad - I really enjoyed this - well rounded flavor, fresh and tasty - wife thought it was too seaweed-y\nShrimp Tempura - the kiddo loves this stuff\n\nItems you could skip:\nBaked Mussels - rather bland, prefer 'em creamier and with more zip\nCalamari - very basic, dipping sauces are okay, nothing special, needed salt\nHeart Attack - it's good, but have the Nuclear Bomb instead\nTreasure - wife said she liked it, I didn't think it really stood out much;"

I love the nigiri here - perfect portion size. The ahi poke bowl is great, and I love that they've got it on the all you can eat menu, whereas most places will only permit one per person. We always get a ton of nigiri and a few of the skirt steaks, cuz they are a sizzling plate of yum that can't be resisted. \n\nChef Daniel was our absolute favorite, so you could count on us occupying a large booth in the back every Friday night. Since he has moved on, we hit this place up at least once per month - as some things have changed, which is a bummer - but it's overall still a great spot. \n\nRoom for improvement here would be the hot tea. They give you an entire pot (which is rad!) but because the tea leaves are left to steep, it's oftentimes incredibly bitter by the middle/end of the pot, which makes me sad. \n\nYou know we'll be back.

I'm seriously so impressed! \n\nSushi: great quality seafood. The fish to rice ratio is fair and not as generous as Sushi Neko, but the quality makes up for it. I tried the salmon, tuna, fresh scallop (A MUST), sweet shrimp, uni, oysters, and eel. Their appetizers are the best I've ever had at an AYCE sushi restaurant. I had ahi poke, shrimp tempura (crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside), and mussels. The mussels were the worse because it wasn't creamy or flavorful enough. \n\nDesserts: AMAZING! They have more than your usual ice creams and mochi ice creams, like a variety of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9es, tiramisu, etc. The green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was more like a flavored whip cream in my opinion; I like mine more thick and creamy but still sweet and good nonetheless. \n\nService: Kenny was our server and he was fantastic. It was super busy when we came in, but he still found time to be attentive and catered to us. He made conversation, suggestions when we were hesitant and deciding on what to order, and my favorite items were from his recommendations. Thanks for not judging me when I ordered like 10 items as my first order lol. \n\nOverall: Oyshi is on my top 5 AYCE sushi restaurants. I can't complain with great service and quality fish. I'll definitely be back!"

Tried to go to Sushi Goymon first but there was a 2 hour wait, so decided to venture over to Oyshi Sushi.  \n\nWhen we arrived the place was half full, but still seemed overwhelmed, dirty dishes piled on empty tables with hostess clearing tables, waited about 5 minutes before she was able to seat us.  Not a big problem, but should've taken it as a sign of things to come.  \n\nWe ordered some hot tea which came luke warm which got us off to a bad start.  The sushi, dragon rolls, caterpillar roll, tuna, were all fine, but took about 20 minutes to arrive.  We also ordered salads which came AFTER yes after the sushi about 30 minutes later.  When I mentioned this to the waiter, he simply said that we have two different kitchens and we bring things when they are ready.  \n\nOverall, it sushi was ok, probably 3 stars, but service was lacking so minus a star.  Probably would not go back."

There was a party ahead of us so we waited but asked a passing waiter if we could just head to the sushi bar and sit down. We were told to wait for the waitress to seat us. So we patiently stood around for about 10 minutes to be seated at the bar, at which there were four open seats. The waitress eventually came and seated the party ahead so we stood at the front desk for a bit. Behind us a couple came in, headed to the bar while indicating to that waitress, who waved back to go ahead, sitting in the two middle of the remaining available seats.  My husband and I looked at each other, then the waitress who then indicated they were a party of three and could not move a seat over to let us sit at the bar as well. \n\nWe stood there kind of shocked while the waitress then told us we could either sit at a table ( wouldn't be able to do half rolls which as just two people allows us to enjoy more different rolls) or sit at the separate alcohol bar (no bartender, away from the sushi chefs, kind of dark) or wait for one of the other couples to finish at the bar. We felt pretty slighted. We had stood there politely and waited our turn to be seated, only to have the remaining pairs of seats be taken by an INCOMPLETE party with no apology at all from the waitress. Just a kind of oh well you can wait or sit elsewhere.  It was pretty upsetting to have this happen, especially considering we came for my husbands birthday and wanted to do something nice.   We left. Had come before and enjoyed the food, which brought us back, but don't know if we will be returning for awhile. Seriously if I was able to give 0 star I could!"

It's just that simple.\n\nThere aren't many good ayce establishments in Las Vegas,  however Oyshi on Sahara stands out as a rarity. The fish is unusually fresh for ayce, the fusion rolls extremely creative, and the sushi chefs - starring Chefs Daniel, Pedro, and Curtis - are awesome guys that know what they're doing (they also have a sense of humor). Additonally, the servers have all been very friendly and everyone makes you feel really welcome.\n\nThis is the only ayce sushi restaurant I go to in Las Vegas. Give 'em a try.

No comparison to Yama Sushi or a couple of other places that we often frequent. Would not recommend the all you can eat as with opinion is not a good value at this restaurant. Perhaps if sitting at the Sushi bar the service would be better.  Might add; have had the pleasure of enjoying Sushi around the world, not just various locations in the US and VEGAS in particular. Doesn't make me an expert by any means, but perhaps a little more adept on determining what I expect. Whether it be Japan, Korea, Europe, Guam, Hawaii, Taiwan, or here in the US, service is service and quality is the same expectation regardless. If a restaurant wants to be great, they have to be consistent."

Very modern and comfortable. There are private rooms for larger parties. We were seated in a private room which was perfect since there were kids with us.\n\nAYCE = $21 for lunch, $26 for dinner. You pay the dinner price at lunch if you want oysters, ebi and uni.\n\nOur first round consisted of mostly appetizers.\nStand out apps:\npotato croquette - very nice fried, good flavor\nbaked mussels - plump and covered with creamy sauce that has masago in it\nshrimp & veggie tempura - good batter and slightly sweeter than normal tempura sauce\nahi poke - not a whole lot of fish, but great seasoning on a bed of greens\n\nAppetizers that didn't really wow me: dynamite, spicy sashimi salad, fried calamari\n\nFood came out in a very timely manner and the wait staff were attentive and quick.\n\nSushi:\nSALMON BELLY received much praise\nSPANISH MACKEREL was good but cut sloppily\nYELLOWTAIL was not buttery but still tasted fresh\nRED SNAPPER great texture and sweetness\nUNI TOPPED WITH QUAIL EGG was a bit discolored which concerned me and didn't have too much sea butteriness to it but still enjoyable\nEBI I passed on because I don't like raw shrimp but seemed okay. I tried to eat the brains but they were very shrimpy\n\nOYSTERS plump and very white. I could've used more lemon or some sort of mignonette though\n\nAs for the rolls, they all started to taste the same. Lots of rolls are filled with krab, and topped with fish. The eel & avocado roll was very disappointing because there was too much of the teriyaki type sauce and the avocado was not ripe. Presentation was good, but the actual handiwork of the cuts wasn't that great. The salmon lover and sexy rolls had some sort of buttery yellow sauce drizzled on top that almost made me gag because there was a faint hint of banana to the sauce. I am not a banana fan. Especially not on my sushi.\n\nFreshness: 3/5\nService: 5/5\nWould I return? Yes."

We had a really large party here, so we reserved a separate dining room to accommodate for all of us. Their service was really great. Food came out pretty fast and the waiters are friendly and are very attentive to your needs. \n\nThe quality of the nigiri was just OK. It wasn't horrible, but it didn't particular stand out. The proportion or rice to fish is average. They give you more rice than some better places I've been to, which tends to fill you up. Also the quality of the fish wasn't great either. It was fresh, but with certain cuts of fish, you can generally taste a difference in quality from the texture. The rolls were pretty good, but they generally are at any AYCE place. None of it seems to stand out, but I rarely see that anyways. \n\nOne of things I got that usually well judges the quality of a place was the uni and a salmon skin roll. The uni was ok. Usually a good piece of uni will have that buttery texture, which this one didn't. This one also had more of a soapy taste, which is generally from uni that isn't as fresh or good quality. The salmon skin hand roll: a good one will have nice, crispy, crunchy pieces of salmon skin. But the ones I ordered here were crunchy and moist, meaning that they didn't toast it long enough to get that right texture.\n\nOverall, it was ok. It was about $26 a person for dinner, which is pretty typical. I've already found some other better AYCE sushi places in Vegas, so I probably wouldn't come back here unless someone really wanted to."

Came to the Sahara location tonight with some friends visiting from Hawaii. One of them dropped their $1k casino chip on the ground. He didnt even realize it until i got a call later from Kevin, the manager, saying one of his workers turned it in to him. Thats just the great type of people who work here. Another good reason to come to Oyshi. Not that i needed it lol. But our visit tonight is definitely worth mentioning."

What I love about this place is the menu isn't limited to a certain AYCE menu. You can order anything off the menu with the exception of sashimi but that's about it. You can tell the seafood is super fresh/prepared perfectly. You can have one dessert per person per AYCE so we tried the green tea berry parfait & the green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Absolute heaven. \n\nService was on point with no complaints at all. \n\nEvery item we tried was delicious & we will definitely be back M-F between 3:30 - 5:30pm for 20% off AYCE Happy Hour!"

            "review": "Solid 4 stars for our first outing at Oyshi Sushi!\n\nFor a Holiday lunch in December, my family and some friends dined at the newer Oyshi Sushi on Sahara.  Our initial choice was Makino's (which isn't THAT bad) but we figure, \"What the Hell?  Let's go try something new!\"  Off to Oyshi it was!\n\nOn our weekend lunch the place wasn't overly busy thankfully.  Our party of 11 was seated in their more private party room towards the back of the restaurant.  Lovely d\u00e9cor!  Except when we looked at the HUGE mural in the party room and put it all together...it's a Japanese dude...somewhat naked!  Ha Ha Ha, but hey, at least it didn't faze us from some awesome eats.\n\nBecause we couldn't decide what to order from Oyshi's menu, the adults just ended up getting the all-you-can-eat.  And at $21 per person for lunch...it's a FRIGGIN' steal!  I mean, if you're gonna order more than one roll (which can average over $10 each easy) then this option is the way to go.  Also, if you're a sushi piggy like me it's the ONLY option!  You can guarantee each of the rolls I chose to try were in the upper price vicinity, probably around $12 per roll.  \n\nWith Oyshi Sushi's all-you-can-eat menu you ALMOST get free range of the entire menu.  Most of the hot items and signature sushi rolls are available for you to order.  Only thing not on the all-you-can-eat?  Sashimi and sashimi with rice...of course.  But that's OK because there is so much to eat.\n\nAnd eat we did!  I felt so bad for these folks because I just kept on ordering sushi roll after sushi roll.  With just the four folks in my family, we EASILY ordered at least 12 signature rolls!  Oinkers!  And that's not including the hot dishes we ordered of the menu!  You can see how getting the all-you-can-eat saves you a bunch of $ when you are an avid sushi eater.  I estimated our total without the all-you-can-eat option - I would have spent over $175, not including tax & tip!  Yowza!\n\nOK, so this is just to show you some of the things we ordered off of the menu (and to show you how Fatty McGee we really are when it comes to sushi):\n\n-Tiger Roll ($12)\n-Oyshi Roll ($13)\n-Love Affair ($13)\n-Dynamite Roll ($11)\n-Volcano ($10)\n-Lobster Fair ($13)\n-Rainbow Roll ($11)\n-Spider Roll ($9)\n-Red Dragon ($11)\n-Monster Roll ($14)\n-Premium Spider Roll ($12)\n-Ahi Poke ($7)\n-Tempura Shrimp ($7)\n-Yakitori Beef ($4)\n-Edamame ($5)\n-Potato Croquette ($4)\n-Gyoza ($5)\n\nSee what I mean??  We ordered all that (for just FOUR of us), and it doesn't include multiple orders of the same sushi roll!  Add that up right there and see the savings!  Save some money AND eat well!  How can you get any better than that!?\n\nQuality = Good!  Sushi rolls were all made to order so they were cut fresh for us.  The fish was fresh that day, no fishy smells.  The sauces were kept on the light side which I appreciate because after a while everything starts tasting like eel sauce if you're not careful.  Sushi rolls were of a nice size as well, definitely bite size but not tiny at all in order to save them money.  Rice to fish ratio was on point and very generous.  \n\nAt the end of the meal (which literally took us over TWO hours) you also get your choice of one dessert.  Only ONE you say?  Yep, and I have no problem with that.  By then you are most likely stuffed like a turkey after all that rice you've consumed.  So ending the meal with something light, like a Mochi Ice Cream, or a slice of Green Tiramisu?  No problem.  I'm already feeling bad since I think my family alone ripped you guys off!\n\nService for our party was great considering our party of 11 was taking up space and time.  Luckily our poor little Japanese server was up to the task of our large ordering shootout.  As a mention, parties of SIX or more are automatically charged 18% gratuity.  Boy did she earn it!  We actually tipped extra over the 18% to show how much we appreciated little her serving our entire party (seriously this dainty girl was no taller than 4 feet 11 inches).  We were eaters for sure!  Combining the other folks in our group, we easily ordered at the very least 25 sushi rolls.   \n\nWill I be back here again?  Yes, yes I will.  Oyshi!"

Also gone is the performance stage. The rest of the decor looks half finished. Luckily, their food is much better. A sampling of tuna, albacore, halibut, and yellowtail nigiri showed that their sushi is better than your average AYCE spot. An order of pork belly was good despite drowning in sauce. Rolls were fairly well crafter with minimal rice and ample fish. Each AYCE meal comes with one dessert. I opted for the velvety smooth chocolate creme brulee with its thick sugary crust.\n\nA kid's menu is available. My kid's order of popcorn chicken filled a large bowl. As an a la carte item, it was an inexpensive deal that easily would have fed four kids. He ended his meal with a ice cream parfait made with vanilla ice cream, granola and chocolate and strawberry syrup.\n\n3.5 Stars"

Me and my wife both like the fact that they had specialty cuts of fish such as konch shell fish, salmon belly, halibut fin, and even scallop raw. Our server was very helpful and guiding us through the menu and even helping us learn how to drink a sake bomb. We sat at the bar and cook was very helpful. Recommending cuts of fish that he thought we might enjoy. And even stearing us in the right direction for dessert. The price was only a few dollars more than where we used to go as regulars, but here we felt that we were treated nicer and also got fresher fish for our money. If you make a trek to this location, be sure to sit next to Pete at the bar. The guy knows his way around the sushi bar and is very entertaining with his blow torch when he is searing items. Definitely worth the extra dollars if you're going to spend the money on sushi anyways.\n\n***edit***\n\nAfter multiple trips and somewheres in 100's of lbs of fish consumed we are still incredibly happy with this establishment."

They must be doing really well to open a second location. \n\nThis location is huge compared to the other. They have both very distinct styles and decorations that coincide perfectly. In the rainbow oyshi I sometimes feel cloister phobic when I walk in and have to sit in a jamm packed restaurant. But this location is ginormous. Twice as many customers can fit inside and they have quite a few private rooms and areas. Love that there are four tvs. Two at the bar and two at the sushi bar area. The waitress told us they're trying to put up a projection tv on the wall so all customers inside can see a game, show, or whatever. When they're able to do that it'll be even more awesome. \n\nThe children's menu is pretty good and if your child wants to do the ayce sushi they can too for a discounted price. \n\nDon't get confused about the menu. It's very different looking and organized differently from the other location. The only thing not included in it is the sashimi, which is the 5th page. \n\nI found that this location has more of a variety of rolls and desserts too. Such as the rainbow one has creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but this one has chocolate and green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Which I should add that green tea one looks like infant poop, in color and consistency. BUT is absolutely delicious! If baby poop was that delicious I would eat it everyday. Even my husband was a little afraid to eat it, and was pleasantly surprised at how great tasting it was. He thought it tasted like the green tea ice cream just in custard form. \n\nThe usual sushi I get. Tiger, spicy tuna crunch, lobster and screaming were just as top notch as they usually are. It came out super fast and fresh. I thought it may have tasted a little fresher.. Which our waitress says she heard a lot but doesn't know how since both locations get their delivers each morning fresh. Must Be in our minds? I also got my usual calamari, grilled asparagus and egg rolls.\n\nLike always I left plump and happy. This will definitely be our new location since it's larger and closer to our house. Go oyshi!"

Each employee I spoke to was extraordinarily consistent with their description of the restaurant, the food, the service and everything within.

I hope you are in your vehicle driving to one of their two locations and have a wonderful evening."

This place really knows how to give the illusion of a good fish to rice ratio by giving lengthy fish slices, but underneath you meet your doom of impending rice. They compacted the rice so it was thick like a rock.\n\nThe menu selection is not great for AYCE, you have many limits on what and where you can order from. No sashimi, no soft shell crab (only in rolls), no half rolls, all the rolls are large standard size -mostly 8 pieces with the exception of some that are 5 pieces (still the same large size as the 8 pieces, just cut differently.) Not a great place if you want to try a bunch of different rolls. Even the nigiri selection was limited and overall pretty unimpressive.\n\nDon't even think about ordering the ahi poke, seafood salad, salmon skin salad, or any of their salads for that matter. They were crazy weak in flavor/ fish/ execution. I wasn't happy with them. At all. \n\nThe only redeeming dishes were:\n1. Dynamite appetizer \n2. Salmon belly nigiri\n3. Baked mussels \n4. Green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e\nAnd that's it...\n\nThe service we received was below average. They weren't even busy! There were 2 other tables dining besides us. We had to ask multiple times to different servers to grab us wasabi and hot sauce. Our waitress was missing, most of our dinner.\n\nIn the end, we left feeling uncomfortably stuffed due to the dense rice expanding. To top it off, it was hot and stuffy in there, and the music made my ears bleed. I agree the interior design was new, modern, beautiful, and spacious, but the overall night club vibe of the restaurant was highly disconcerting. \n\nIn a city that loves a good AYCE sushi joint, this is not the place to go. I would recommend another Korean ran spot that does a better job: Sakana. \n\nNow, with a belly busted from rice, I bid you good luck and good evening."

We were seated in the far corner of the restaurant, in a private nook.  It was a really nice section.  I like the look of this location better than the other one...to me, its brighter, and seems a little less run down.\n\nThe server we had, I want to say he said that his name was Kenny?  I think it said \"Golden\" on his nametag..., anyway, he was spectacular.   Funny, friendly, triple checked on our orders.  He was really on it.  \n\nWe were given a couple of \"specialties\" after we let Kenny know we were all having AYCE.  They brought out a ceviche, which I sadly, could not eat. (Avocado Allergy) Everyone else said it was delicious though.  They also brought out a Super White sashimi with a fried jalepeno on it, with an orgasm sauce (not sure if that's what they call it here, but that's what it was.).  This was really tasty. Super white is my favorite anyway, and the jalepeno was sweet with a nice kick.  \n\nAs always, my husband and I ordered nigiri.  \nMost of what we ordered was pretty standard, but there were a couple standouts for me:\n\n1.  The squid.  I've never eaten raw squid before; only grilled or fried.  I was anticipating a firm texture, like tako (octopus), but it was tender and delicious.  This was served with a piece of mint under the fish.  The flavor combination was out of this world.  A definite must have.\n\n2. The Super White.  Tender.  Buttery.  Delicate...\nPro tip:  Order the fresh wasabi and put some on this. (put some on everything you eat, but this one especially.)  HOLY flavor punch, Batman!\n\n3. The halibut.  Incredible.  I've had halibut a few times, but this one was exceptional.\n\nWe really had a good experience here.  The reasons I'm only giving three stars are:\n\n1.  They missed a few pieces of our orders.  Not a huge deal...but I REALLY wanted those oysters, and we didn't really have the opportunity to ask for them, since we ordered those towards the end of the meal, and our server was trying to get a bunch of separate checks organized. \n2.  They charge for fresh wasabi.  One of my favorite spots does not charge extra for it, so this was a bummer.  We still got it, because a friend ordered it for us.  Its kind of a bummer to have your dinner budgeted and realize something you really love costs extra, when it doesn't at other places. Now that I know, if we return, we'll be better prepared. \n3.  Their hot sake is bloody expensive.  $8 for a large hot house sake?  I'm used to paying $3-5 for a large bottle.  \n4.  At the end of the night, 3 drinks were brought out and only given to the front half of the table.  First of all...if you're only bringing 3 for us to share (since we didn't ask for them and were not charged for them)...you should probably do one for each section of the table so everyone can share a little bit of one.  Also, the drink was not made well.  It was a Moscow Mule, which is one of my favorites, and it was just not good.  WAY too much mint, not enough lime.  \n5.  My creme brulee was given to someone at the head of the table instead of me, so I got a half eaten creme brulee at the end of my meal.  (yes, part of that was the fault of the people I dined with, for not asking who ordered it...but if you wrote it down correctly, you should have just brought it to me.)  \n\nSo...a good experience.  Service was MUCH better than the other location.  Other than the creme brulee thing, and missing my oysters, our server was really good.  People make mistakes, I'm not mad about it...but it does need to be stated.  \n\nThe food was standard, but again...better than the other location.  \n\nI'd definitely come back.  It won't be my first choice, but I won't avoid it either."

But I do get to Vegas quite a bit. And now every time u do get out this way I will be eating here. \n\nI was finishing up a business meeting about 2 miles away and looked on yelp for a sushi place with a good rating. They fit the bill so I drove over there knowing nothing other than they got a great rating on yelp.\n\nWhen u drove up I was immediately impressed with the outside as it was very attractive and was obviously part of a new shopping center. Then I saw their sign that they had an all you can eat dinner and I got really excited!\n\nAnybody that knows me knows that I can eat. And if your offering me all you can eat im going to be there for a whole. And since I hadn't eaten all day I was ready. I sat at the sushi bar where they told me everything on the menu was available on the all you can eat with the exception of the sashimi. \n\nThere were 5 people behind the counter at the sushi bar and they cranked out the food really fast. But it didn't taste rushed and it certainly didn't taste like all you can eat. In fact it might of been true bast sushi I've ever had. \n\nThere was one sushi chef that took care of me almost entirely. I'm sorry I didn't get his name because he have me great service as did everyone else I came on contact with. \n\nSo to sum it up if you live in Vegas or are visiting (it's only about 10-15 minutes from the strip) you must try it. If you line sushi you will love this place."

From the appetizer section, to the desserts, everything we had was pretty tastey. \n\nSome highlights were their surf and turf roll, fried gyoza, sweet shrimp nigiri and fried heads, eel nigiri, tamago nigiri, salmon belly nigiri, cajun albacore nigiri, and their baked mussels.\n\nThe only real low points with the food was that the super white tuna wasn't that good, and each person could only have two orders of their awesome baked mussels. \n\nThe service from the staff was top notch. While it took awhile to get our food a couple of times when the restaurant got full and busy, the servers and what we assumed was the floor manager always made sure to check on our orders and help get stuff to our table. The floor manager even took our order a couple of times, cleared our table, and refilled our drinks on more than one occasion. The staff there was firing on all cylinders and was really attentive. \n\nThis was my second time coming here, and I really enjoyed the food and service again.

Located in a plaza on Sahara off of Teneya, this spot had a clean look to it. Plenty of parking. Walked inside and almost felt as if I was under dressed. This place is Fancy. Greeted as we entered, we were shown to our table in record timing. Well, for a sushi restaurant. Very spacious, great modern decor, and plenty of seating. Well lit, with just the right amount of volume on the music. \n\nOur server was great and gave us the full run through of the menu and drinks. No empty glasses here baby. Food came as fast as we ordered them. Well, at least from what I remember. Here's the rundown of what we ordered.\n\nWhat ordered:\nMiso soup\nAhi poke\nCalamari\nBaked mussel \nShrimp tempura\nSizzling beef\nBeef asparagus \n\nNigiri:\nTuna \nGarlic Tuna\nSalmon\nAlbacore\nGarlic albacore\nYellowtail\nIkura\nUzura - quail egg\nMasago - smelt egg\nTamago - sweet egg\n\nKnow what? We cleaned our plates. Yes we did. The fish is fresh. A bit light on flavor for the mussels, but amazing taste for the sizzling beef. Since I'm accessing long term memory and my   hippocampus isn't cooperating, I'll have to keep it short. (Note to self, write review within a week of visiting business).\n\nThis place is well worth the drive. Perfect for that elegant date, without the outrageous prices and AYCE bustle.

We called ahead and were told there was no wait. On arrival the wait was 20 minutes. Forgivingly, we decided to sit at the bar to kill time. \n\nLow and behold: they did not have a bartender. Not only was this made noted to us, but we were told by a server  that drinks would have to be ordered when we sat down; completely fine, they seemed busy.\n\nSo we were seated in one of their private rooms. We sat  down and the menus were not spread amongst the table and placed for us to distribute amongst ourselves. In retrospect, it was a small complaint compared to the 30 total minutes we waited for our beers. Which, on delivery, the server mentioned he would be back for our order  after he brought the 22oz Sapporo bottle he forgot.\n\nSo upon his delayed return and 10 additional minutes for this bottle of beer, he attempted to again avoid taking our order. I quickly asked if we could order starters, in which he responded quickly: IF we were ready he could actually take our whole order.\n\n We started to fire off items for our party. At this point we were just happy to be ordering. Things appeared slowly but we had to ask for the ginger and wasabi for the table after about three nigiri plates were served. It's traditional that AYCE sushi establishments either bring this with the first plate or serve it immediately after the first order is placed; this was not the case. \n\nIt was a slope from here. We had to ask a runner every time we had something missing from the table. The server wouldn't observe or offer the entire party if they needed anything else, for example: refills on beers. (Which, in my experience as a server, is key to making a great tips!) and to top it all off we were service charged as a party of 7, although their menu explicitly states 8. Luckily, it was 18% and by the end of our meal, we opted to save ourselves more time by letting it go.\n\nThey probably knew we would not be back, as on our way out the server's attempt to allay any concern was that \"(he) would redeem himself the next time.\"\n\nThat phrase in itself made me write this review. Not only did you subliminally acknowledge the subpar service you provided but you were unwilling to listen and communicate with your diners, whilst imposing a service charge that was unwarranted. This is not only a poor reflection of service standards but the unimportance the staff perceives with poor guest experiences.\n\nI don't recommend visiting this establishment to anyone looking for anticipatory service."

The service was very friendly but we waited over 25 minutes for our first round of AYCE. The food quality was ok but nothing to get too excited about. Prices were average. My biggest gripes were the layout- crowded floor and you have to walk through a wait station in front of the kitchen and not run into any servers to get to the restrooms...and the music. It was nightclub music- ok whatever- but it was as loud as a nightclub. The group consensus is that we probably won't go back. It wasn't a comfortable atmosphere and not worth that for the sushi."

This is the second location in town and it's a very nice spot. The layout, decor and fun seating arrangements are the best part of this place. The food is ok, good but not fantastic.\n\nVegas has so many incredible sushi spots so having as many options as we do oyshi should offer half rolls and a few sashimi options. Most sushi places do and the ultimate giveaway is the rice to fish ratio. This place is big on rice. They also didn't carry super white. WTF? \n\nSo we came in a big group and ate our hearts out but I didn't have any unbelievable moments. Some things were better then the others and my favorites from this place were the iris roll, unagi and Spanish mackerel. But again nothing was a wow. Lots of rice and a 1 hour limit. \n\nThe company was great so overall we had fun but with so many sushi options this isn't at the top of my list."

Without diverting too much from the food, I would just like to say that there are a few unhappy people employed here, and it shows. It was pretty apparent that there is a lot of internal politics going on at this place. It made me feel very uncomfortable as a patron.... Aside from that, this place has decent food, a great selection of rolls, sushi and sashimi.\n\n    I counted forty signature rolls on there menu. My friend who visits the place frequently, suggested the \"High Roller.\" It did not disappoint. The screaming sauce had a small bite to it. The \"Nuclear Bomb\" was my favorite of the night. The crunch flakes (I think it was coconut) gave the roll a great taste! I was feeling a little brave so I also ordered the Sea urchin with quail egg. It didn't look very appealing, but it wasn't gross either. Come to think of it, it didn't have much flavor at all. It tasted like a sunny side up egg with some cold fish inside. \n\n   The service was okay. It started off pretty shaky, but the waiter opened up to us later in the night. I think he was having a bad day. The place is pretty clean and modern. They have plenty of adult drinks to choose from, along with a small bar near the entrance."

The selection is large, with several sides and apps, as well as grilled dishes, to supplement the nigiri and (massive list of) sushi rolls.\n\nDefinitely ask about the daily specials to ensure you are trying their freshest fish available: the scallop, smoked salmon, conch, and mackerel on my visit were all incredible. Nigiri portions are generous with thick-cut large pieces. \n\nFavorite rolls are the CHUNG HUA (salmon tempura and garlic yum yum spicy tuna inside topped with white fish and avocado, spicy ponzu and sesame oil sauces): it's spicy and has a great mix of flavors without being too heavy, really liked the sauces. This roll is nicely balanced out by the YELLOWTAIL TRIO (yellowtail chunks, cucumber, gobo, kaiwari topped with yellowtail sashimi dressed in ginger sauce), which is a lighter roll with the fish and fresh cucumber as the stars. \n\nStandout apps include the sashimi salad, the vegetable tempura, and the miso soup (generous portion, lots of seaweed, and a savory-not-salty broth). The must-get orders for us include the Chung Hua roll above, a selection of nigiri, and incredible MACKEREL SPECIAL HANDROLLS, with gobo, kiwari, and cucumber.\n\nExtra star for great service: Jesus is my favorite server f(rom another restaurant) and his attention to detail is unsurpassed. If you've never had a server recognize you across town and greet you by name, you might not understand. Jesus is the best, request him specifically if you are going for a special occasion or as a large group."

Were we greeted with a smile and told there was a wait. Then after we were seated the illusion were off an the nightmare started. Service was less to be desired an often times i was interupted with audible weird sound?? Feeling quite awkward I proceeded to order few sushi rolls and appetizers.\n\nThe shrimp tempura was not light and flaky. It tasted more like it coated with a heavy batter an was served not pipin hot but luke warm?\nThe pink lady sushi roll look like my nephew (5yrs old) learned how to make sushi for the first time\n\nThe Pokie has three pieces of light colored Ahi Tuna with seaweed and abundance of white onion on the bottom.  \nThen to make matter worse 5 piece roll, coco roll, an mango roll all over sized pieces that could even fit in your mouth. The fish quality was very poor. Also tasted either salty or extremly sweet.\n\nSo i started to look around an noticed that the staff at the sushi bar; food runner who brought the food was just not in a pleasent mood.  They all seemed to give off a tired overworked type of mood. Waiter/waitress haphazardly put the plates anywhere and not clearing the table first of any dishes. My friend ordered the desert. She being brave (lol) ordered the green tea ice cream and that was overspun. \n\nInconclusion i had high hopes of this place especailly how inviting it seemed on the outside. Alas very disappointed and won't be dinning here anymore.\nGave it 2 stars for hostess who greeted us promplty with a smile."

This is not a buffet restaurant,  you order when you want more which makes the food fresh and hot.  My favs are the lobster lover, pork belly, salmon hand roll.  \nOyshi is definitely a must try if you're ever in the area."

I like coming for lunch because it's slower, this place gets pretty busy on the weekends. We like sitting at the sushi bar because you can order faster and the guys are super cool. Plus you can get half rolls. I love the house salad and they have an awesome sake martini :)"

The food was great and so was the interior of the restaurant! It's decorated so beautifully!! Also the fact that pretty much the whole menu is AYCE, including appetizers is just incredible! Steak and sushi? Count me in"

My husband ate 8 rolls!  The food was fresh and came out at a nice pace - which gave us more time to relax and talk with each other.  We were not rushed and there was no time limit, like there are at AYCE places.  I don't eat fish - or seaweed - and was surprised that there were so many choices for me to do the AYCE as well - terriyaki chicken, gyoza, egg rolls, miso soup, salads, vegetarian rolls (with soy wraps), and beef plates.  I highly recommend the Grilled Beef Asparagus - thinly sliced beef wrapped around an asparagus spear and grilled with a light, sweet sauce on top.  Each AYCE lunch comes with 1 dessert - I had the chocolate creme brulee - absolutely fantastic!  Service was good.  Vangie, our waitress, worked at our pace.  She gave us time to look over the menu in full, made some very tasty suggestions, and was able to answer all our questions about ingredients and what was included.  Any time we accidentally veered off the included choices, Vangie let us know and suggested a similar item from the included choices.  She was very patient with us and really kept the food coming out while giving us our space.  If you go - ask for her.  I read some reviews where the server just didn't come back after awhile, not Vangie!  As she saw our plates emptying, she returned to ask if we wanted more, clear off used dishes, and refill beverages.  Oyshi is definately going onto our list of places to return - often and soon!"

Looking forward to uni with quail egg, we were disappointed they were out. It was incredibly cold (I know this has nothing to do with the service). \n\nDriving by today we decided to stop again. Got seated right away which was nice. Our server asked our drink order but by that time we were ready to order. She did not want to take our order since another customer was waiting for something. So we got our waters and waited. She came back to take our order and things already went wrong. We ordered beef tataki but got beef wrapped asparagus. Ordered another beef wrapped asparagus but got nothing. Ordered uni but they were out... again. Ordered three orders of gyoza but got two. Ordered three seaweed salads but got two. Ordered a dynamite roll and a lobster affair roll but got two lobster affair rolls. Ordered three pork belly and got one. Ordered a red dragon roll and got a regular dragon roll. The salmon nigiri was warm and did not taste fresh. We ordered the Oyshi scallops which had crab also, but when we got the order there was no scallop. I called over a food runner and sent it back. The server came back and aggressively asked us if we had ordered cooked scallops. It's like she couldn't remember anything even though she wrote it down. We said there were no scallops and she said they were chopped and mixed with the crab. It was a lie. I looked through it. Besides, no one minces scallops. \n\nIt is unreasonable to pay more for dinner prices when they are out of items only offered for dinner, like uni. This is the third time we have been to this location and all three times they did not have uni. I will never come back."

When my friends and I went yesterday for the second time, the service was below average. Although the servers were really friendly, they constantly forgot about our food. We had to remind them at least 5 times. I could look over it, but it wasn't really busy which irritated me. It was such a let down. Going to have to reconsider coming here again."

The waiters name is Kenny, he was really understanding after the over servers brought out the wrong food, and forgot to bring out some of the rolls we ordered. He was willing to not include it on the bill on his behalf, with no questions or hassle making us feel really relieved that we didn't have to try and finish these extra rolls that we didn't like nor order. Don't get me wrong the food is amazing, but there are some things I'm not interested in but every time I come I'm never disappointed in what I order."
