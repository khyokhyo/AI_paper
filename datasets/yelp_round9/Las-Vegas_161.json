            "review": "This is by far my favorite sushi place in the world.  I don't why it's so good and so dead. It must be because Planet Hollywood is not yet the cool place to party in town.  Koi is located next to the Stomp Out Loud theater.  I ordered all of these dishes and LOVED every single one of them:  Crispy Rice with spicy tuna, tuna sashimi with jalapenos and garlic chips, hamachi fusion, spicy seared albacore with crispy onions, yellowtail carpaccio, tuna tartare with avocado on crispy wontons, vegetable tempura and fried bananas for desert.  The dessert was just ok, but the fish here just melts in your mouth. Everything was so fresh and tasty and I wish I could eat her every single day.  That would make me so happy."

Also got the cucumber martini which was quite good. Be ready to spend because nothing is cheap here and portions are small, but quality is on point."

            "review": "I came here for my bday dinner (a bit of a splurge, but worth it). We had the...\n\ncucumber sunomono - very tasty pickled cucumber salad (and pretty!)\ncrispy rice topped with spicy tuna - very different with the crispy rice, but I thought the textures were cool and the tuna was just right\nhamachi fusion - the soy-citrus was a nice touch to sashimi\nmiso bronzed black cod - no crispy skin, but the flavor was awesome and the fish was nice and moist\ngrilled skirt steak with crispy onions and sesame sauce - nice and tender and the sauce was great\nmolten chocolate cake - gotta love chocolate desserts :)\n\nThe portion sizes were actually pretty good for a fancy restaurant (I can't comment on the sushi since I didn't have any, but why go to a place that seems to specialize in Japanese fusion for standard rolls that you could probably get elsewhere for much cheaper?). Splitting the meal between two people, we both left satisfied. \n\nService was very very quick.... maybe almost too quick (our main dishes came before we finished our appetizers). However, they were very courteous and friendly.\n\nThe ambiance was classy-cool, with modern designs and a dark palette. As for noise level... it didn't bother me to have the chatter of other diners in the background, but I suppose if you wanted to hold a serious conversation with someone a couple seats down, then it would be a bit loud.\n\nI would definitely go again!"

One of my friends had been here last year and a bit of a mishap happened, so they comp'd our whole meal this time. I had the Toban Yaki - Kobe Filet Minon... it does NOT get better than this. The filet MELTED in my mouth. The baked lobster rolls were delicious - and got my sister now to enjoy sushi as she never has before. The asparagus and mushrooms were amazing. The service was fantastic. I will definitely be returning to Koi next Vegas trip."

I tried the kobe surf & turf rolls and garlic mash for my meal...both were solid.  I also had their strawberry cobbler for dessert and that was quite tasty too.  Was it the best sushi in history - no.  But when I take into account the total experience while at Koi, put it this way:  when I visit Vegas again I'll go back to Koi.  And the only place where I can ever make that emphatic of a statement in Vegas is a casino.  If I had to give it a small dig, I would say it was a lil too dark inside.  But that's minor; as I come for the food and good service.  \n\nBy the way - all of the negative reviews you see (of the 1 to 2 star variety) are for the lounge/club that opens up later in the evening.  I have no insight into how that works."

            "review": "Pretty decent Japanese inspired cuisine with a Hollywood decor flare. Situated on the mezzanine level of Planet Hollywood (PH) next to Strip House (steak restaurant) and Brittney Spears' main theater, Koi is essentially at the top of the upscale eatery options at PH.  The restaurant opens for dinner (and dinner only) around 5:30pm and closes around 10:30pm to then transform into the Koi nightclub portion - I believe this is PH's main nighclub hotspot too.  Downstairs on the main casino floor you'll find employee's handing out wristbands for the nightclub.  Typically it's a $20 deal for entry along with drink deals (different or men vs. women), and pretty sure it's well drinks only that are offered with these deals.  The club area is at the front of the restaurant, and isn't very big compared to most of the larger venues like, Bank, Light, Hyde, Marquee, Tao, LAX, and many others.  In the club you'll find a single, decently large bar area, plenty of bench-style seating (although this will all be reserved for bottle service on busy nights), and Top 40 dance music playing at the standard nightclub (moderately loud) level.  The restaurant area is farther back past the club, and is much larger, and amenable to a greater number of patrons.  Koi's director of entertainment, Patrick, tells me that the restaurant area is sometimes opened up to be an extension of the club, provided the event is substantial (like New Years Eve for example).  One thing I do like is that there is an on-site restroom located near the front which is nice as some resort venues make you leave the restaurant to use the main casino facilities which can be a little awkward and time consuming.\n\nI dined at the Sushi Bar, and my chef, Bui, was a terrific host who was very knowledgeable in the seafood arena.  After an edamame appetizer, two drinks, two sushi rolls, and a dessert, the bill was $81 (throw in the tip and I dropped an even $100).  There's not much of an outdoor view from inside the restaurant unless your sitting in the Fountain Room, which is at the back most portion of the restaurant.  There you'll find a good view of the Strip from their floor-to-ceiling windows.  They also have a decent sized outdoor terrace you can walk outside to for a terrific view of City Center and part of Bellagio and the fountains.  There's also a small indoor terrace next to the club portion that overlooks the main casino floor.\n\nOverall, I recommend this venue for an upscale, dressy dinner/drinks outing.  Didn't stay for the nightclub portion, but wasn't happy with the size of the club portion.  If they opened up the whole restaurant (including the Fountain Room) then there'd be some room to roam around."

We were still a little hungry after that so we ordered yellowtail, halibut, and uni nigiri and it was all melt in your mouth delicious.  Service was also really good, as soon as my water was a little low they came and filled it immediately. Great place, definitely coming back!"

            "review": "I have already reviewed the Los Angeles incarnation so I came to Koi Vegas with high expectations.  I wanted to see if their magic could translate on the Strip because so many restaurants come to mind where thats not the case (Canter's, Joe's Stone Crab etc...).  I think Koi nailed it...and given a few tweaks can be even better.\n\nFirst thing I noticed about the Las Vegas space is its giant compared to the one in LA.  The lounge I think is the same size of the whole LA restaurant.  Its a little bit of the beaten path being upstairs at Planet Hollywood but where that might impact their foot traffic it more than makes up for in the FABULOUS strip view they have in one part of the restaurant.  If its a special occasion, make sure you put in a request for this view.  \n\nThe menu is almost a complete clone of the LA version as well.  On this particular visit I ordered a couple new items I had tried before.  First up was the Salmon Carpaccio with truffle oil which was outstanding.  I had a similar dish but with beef in LA and can recommend both, but for my money I'll take the salmon.  Next up was a Yellowtail covered in crispy onions.  Again, a wonderful favor combination where the crisp of the onions blends sublimely with the the smooth flavor of the yellowtail.  My only suggestion here would be to maybe offer more yellowtail on the plate.  It appeared the plate was overwhelmed by the crispy onions and you had to dig to find the fish. I always have to get a roll so I ordered a hand roll soft shell crab which was good and satiated my craving for that type of sushi.  Finally I split with my friend the skirt steak and ordered a side of their asparagus/mushroom combination.  The meat was tasty and the glaze a nice compliment, but nothing that will blow your mind.  It was  a safe pick and next time I might opt for more seafood.  However, I must say the asparagus & mushroom side was one of the finest side dishes I have ever had.  The chop the asparagus and mushrooms down to small pieces and blend them in a savor glaze.  I kid you not when I say I could order a full plate of this as a meal and be satisfied. \nI ended with an order of their chocolate cake which is always a nice little treat.  Nothing fancy, but nice if your finishing some sake or wish to get a desert wine or coffee.\n\nAll in all, Im a big fan of the Vegas location after being kind of skeptical heading in.  Its a big space and good for larger groups but the it also can be intimate if need be, especially by those windows where you can see the whole strip.  \n\nI think next time I may save time and do cocktails after dinner there too because it looked as if they brought in a dj and shifted into a lounge feel later in the evening.  Ahh, but this is Vegas...where do we find time for it all???"

The girl showing me to my table was chatty and nice, the waitress took my drink order within a minute of sitting down and as I had already checked the menu before coming here I was ready to order when she returned with my drink. Food came promptly and my water was refilled whenever needed. My waitress stopped by now and then to check that everything was OK and to see if I needed something else.\n\nBut the food... Well. While OK I would not consider it on par with the price-tag.\n\nEspecially not the sashimi. The slices were so thin that I could almost see through them and they fell apart when I lifted them off the tray. That is not how sashimi should be! It should be about a quarter of an inch thick and firm enough that you can lift it by a corner without the piece falling apart! The quality of the fish was OK but not great.\n\nThe main course (I had the Togarashi Crusted Salmon) was good, the spices well balanced and the fish cooked right. But for $25 I believe I can find better fish in this town...\n\nOn top of this the music was just too loud for this type of setting. I was there early in the evening (8pm) and the music was cranked up to \"dance and shut up\" volume. Not a pleasant experience."

It truly is a beautiful dining room. We were lead to a seating area near the front of the hotel that had a window view of the strip. We sat on couches (slightly worn and stained) and it was great. The service (although nice enough) was slow and spotty. The food was good but I can easily think of 10 Asian restaurants in San Francisco that are better and cheaper. It felt like there wasn't alot of soul put into the food although it seemed creative enough. I'm afraid to say that this place is definitely more of a has been then anything else."

Koi had a very sophisticated  ambiance in Las Vegas and we got lucky to sit right by the window and watched the Bellagio waterworks while we had dinner.  I don't know why I just now reviewed Koi but I feel like I fell short on telling you my experience there. Service was spot on and we did not have to wait too long to get sat or too long for the food to arrive either which to me are all service points of the evening.  We had the Kobe Style Filet Mignon \"Toban-Yaki\" Asparagus and Mushrooms. It was really amazing from the cut of the beef and the presentation. Koi was pricey in a way that the quality of food, ambiance and experiance were all great but it also wasn't breaking the bank or a surprise bill. We did not have the experience of seeing the true night life that unfolded at Koi because we went for an early dinner. I think it's worth seeing why people are rating Koi at a pretty high 4 to 5 stars. Next time I'm back in Vegas, I'm going to hit the happy hour and maybe even stay there until the night life starts. The ambiance, dinner and every thing in between was amazing. It was quite a good date night for us."

I couldn't taste the tiny chopped up foie gras so a little disappointed there but the seared tuna was good if you are ok with truffles.  I guess I should have gotten the steak with foie gras but why order steak at a sushi restaurant. I also had toro sashimi which was very good. The lobster taco with avocado sauce was very tasty.  I thought the sushi rolls were ok, but my party enjoyed their entrees.  The service on the other hand was excellent! They were very attentive and brought refills before the drinks were even done.  We were done with dinner 20 minutes before our show and they asked if we wanted dessert.  The server said he would make it happen. We got the empress dessert plate that came with everything except the bread pudding.  I love molten lava cake and it was very good. We left at 655 for our show just outside the restaurant. So 5 stars for service and 4 stars for food."

I do feel the recession in Vegas because we got a table for 7:30pm for New Year's Eve and we only made the reservation at 3pm.\n\nUpon arrival, we were told by the host that there is no table and asked us to wait at the bar.  After 30 mins and 2 drinks later, it was 8pm and we were tired of waiting so we were ready to walk out and tell them to cancel our table.  As soon as we walked to the host table, they told us that our table is ready.  I believe it's a marketing trick they use to make you spend more money at the restaurant.  When we walked into the dinning room, we noticed tons of empty tables.  While we were waiting for our table, we did not see a lot of people walking out of the dining room.  Of course we were pissed about that.\n\nAs far as food goes, definitely not worth the money we were paying.  Most of the rolls are between $12 - 25.  Here is what we ordered:\n\n1.  Dragon Roll:  it has  alot of those crispy thing on top and I can not taste what is actually in the roll.  All I ate was rice and the roll is like $19  or something like that.\n\n2.  Rainbow roll:  the typical rainbow roll you can get at the regular sushi place and again, we paid way too much for it.\n\n3.  Salmon sashimi:  the fish is actually ok.\n\n4.  Surf and Turf:  I think it's like $40 ish?  very small plate thu.  \n\n5.  Tuna dinner:  it was ok,. just over priced\n\nThe cocktails and sake selections are actually pretty good.\n\nSo after $300 later, i had food poisoning afterward.  I would say that I will never go back to Koi again,\n\nI have to say, the coolest thing at the restaurant is that you can see the water show at the Ballogio's."

            "review": "This Koi was a disappointment compared to the Koi in West Hollywood.  But then again, the first is always going to be the best, right? (Except in Nobu's case-all Nobus are fab).\n\nWhat stood out to me the most about my experience at Koi Vegas was how the staff did not have their shit together in the least bit, and there were numerous mistakes with our orders.  I asked our server how long they had been open expecting him to reply with a short amount of time, but they opened back in November so there really is no excuse for the poor, jumbled service.  Our server was very sweet and polite, but I felt like there was a large gap in communication with the other staff members, and he could have been a lot more knowledgeable about the food.  There was more than one question he did not know the answer to regarding the menu; what the dishes were comprised of ect...\n\nWhen the food did come out, some of it was great but most of it was ho hum.  The sushi rolls were pretty good, and the edamame was cooked and seasoned perfectly with salt (although I had to remind our waiter that we had ordered it) but my entree was lackluster.  I ordered the miso cod- big shocker, I know- and it was nowhere near as good as Nobu's, or as good as the cod at Koi in Hollywood.  The skin had all the flavor- the actual meat of the fish was kind of dry.  Definitely not moist and tender like its supposed to be.  If it were'nt for the flavorful skin, I would'nt have eaten the filet itself.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is nice...its very large and has a huge window that gives you a great view of the Bellagio fountains across the street.  The restaurant was quite empty on a Saturday night, although Ms. Lindsay Lohan made an appearence while we were eating so I guess it is somewhat of a \"hot spot\" if you care about that aspect.  \n\nI'll stick with Nobu in the future for solid amazing Japanese fare."

I wanted to choose them all but unfortunately I couldn't but what I was able to try, I absolutely loved. \n\nThe service from the moment we walked in was just wonderful. Everyone greeted us with a warm smile and treated us like royalty. Plus I love the ambience of the place. Beautiful decor and fun music playing overhead. I get why all the celebrities love this place. What's not to love? \n\nNow the food. Let's talk about the amazing food. We started with hamachi sashimi. Great flavor! Don't be scared of the jalape\u00f1o it gives it such a great flavor. Oh and my favorite part was the fresh grated wasabi. You cannot find this just anywhere perhaps because 1 plant costs about $160 (we looked it up online). But wow, you just have to try it. Place some on your sashimi or sushi and it just compliments it so well. It also helps that the fish they use here is super fresh. I'm particular about my sushi because I've had some of the best in Japan and when I say their fish is good. I mean it. \n\nI'd recommend this place to any and everyone. I'm glad I gave it a try despite some mediocre reviews. People just don't know good sushi it seems."

Short line and it was \"ladies night\" so I got in for $20 and all the drinks I wanted. \n\nMy free drinks were pretty good. Husband had to pay for drinks, and they were pricey, but a lot cheaper than other clubs.\n\nIt was pretty crowded thanks to the long weekend and the songs were pretty good. The floor was sticky - that was gross.\n\nI like the little balcony area where you can get some air and get a cool view of the casino floor. I'm positive there are better places on the Strip, but all-in-all, not a bad experience."

But everything else was pretty tasty. Waiter service was good. But I'm not sure how organized the kitchen is. My friend ordered the Lobster tail, our waiter came back and said they were all out of lobster. She ordered a hot dish with prawns. he came back again and said they were out of prawns as well. Huh?\nAn upscale Las Vegas restaurant out of prawns and lobster? okay.. whatever.She ended up ordering sushi. What was next. Out of rice?\nThe drinks are good and strong. Blood Orange Sunset cosmo had a kick.The food is pretty good, setting is way too dark, unprepared inventory of ingredients, we took our drinks out of the restaurant and the overly smiley front desk girls asked for the martini glasses back.  I think a couple glasses worth a couple bucks is no biggie, considering we racked up a 400 dollar dinner bill. Come on. We stayed at Bellagio and ate real late the night before at Bellagio's cafe, which is ideal for a quick bite. And I actually rate the cafe 4 stars compared to 3 stars for Koi."

            "review": "Koi Las Vegas has some major hype going on around it!  Kim Kardashian, Kevin Spacey, David Spade......if you flip on the Extra channel in the new Planet Hollywood Hotel, it seems like all the celebrities have something nice to say about Koi.  The original Koi is in Los Angeles, and frequently gets celebrities hopping in and out of that restaurant.  \n\nFood-wise, this place is no match for Matsuhisa in Los Angeles, but it is a nice place to have dinner if you're on the Strip.  Koi Las Vegas is on the Mezzanine level in the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino.  Three jolly buddhas are positioned in front of the restaurant, and then you walk around the circular lounge, and into the dimly lit restaurant flanked by modern grey/green booths and glossy brown tables. It's very dark in the restaurant, with just the sushi/sashimi chefs lit up under recessed lighting near the sushi bar.   Lots of businessmen at this restaurant....those darn companies pick up the pricey tab when dinner is all over.  Wish I could have a company expense!  Some people were there for dates.  The dress code is dressy casual, but they will let you in if you look semi-decent (ie no flip flops or T-shirts, but everything else, they'll let you in.)\n\nLike many other fusion Japanese restaurants, Koi Las Vegas has a signature crispy rice spicy tuna appetizer.  4 pieces of spicy tuna with a hint of jalepeno slice, over a crunchy, chewy fried piece of rice.  Expensive, yes, at $15 for only four pieces, but it was pretty good.  The crunchy, chewy rice was warm and complemented the cold spicy tuna on top.  The slice of jalepeno gave the dish a nice kick in the end.  Lots of customers were getting this dish!\n\nThe salmon carpaccio with black truffle was not bad, but I think I\"ve had better.  The salmon was ultra thin, and I expected the carpaccio to be chunks of salmon together in a black truffle oil sauce, but to me, this dish was underwhelming.  The truffle was chopped up and placed on the salmon slices, and it was okay.  I think this dish could be better if there was more originality to the presentation.  For the price, this dish could have been better.\n\nThe miso crusted black cod was delicious, and they gave a hearty portion to the dish.  It was laced with some baby carrots, and some asparagus on the side.  The cod was light, flaky and the miso sauce had just the right amount of flavor to compliment the dish.  If you come to Koi, get this dish, because you'll be happy with your choice.  Light, yet flavorful, this dish is appealing to all seafood lovers.  Original, no---because you can find this dish at just about any other Asian fusion restaurant out there, and it tastes just as good at any other restaurant (ie think Roy's).  \n\nThe chilean sea bass was very very light, as it was steamed with ginger and scallion.  It is placed on a bed of shitake mushrooms and you can really enjoy the flavor of the sea bass.  Very fresh.  \n\nFor dessert, do not get the molten chocolate cake, because it is nothing like Roy's, and you do not get the hot, lava flowing chocolate from the inside of the cake.  \n\nI only gave Koi Las Vegas 3 stars because it is not a stand out restaurant, and the dishes were not spectacular like at other places.  At Roy's, there's more originality, and you feel like you're getting a good deal for the price you pay.  Here at Koi, they rely a bit too much on the celebrity hype, so the food suffers.  The place is nothing like the Los Angeles Koi---it's not cozy, and you can't really appreciate the decor since it so dark inside.  There's a small view of the Las Vegas Strip, but most tables don't have a view because only a small portion of the tables are facing that direction.\n\nExpensive meal, but not really worth it in my opinion."

It's located on the second floor inside Planet Hollywood. \n\nDecor: This is definitely a winner. I feel like this is the only thing keeping this place alive because the decor is a pretty sweet deal. Good for dates or girl's night out or just a group hangout. \n\nFood: During happy hour, you can get some items at 50% off. That being said, the drinks are worth a try if you come during happy hour because at $8, it's pretty strong and it's not bad. We ordered the tuna tar tar and the california roll. Okay let me just say, I thought the tuna tar tar tasted pretty good. Let me also say, that for $8 during happy hour ($16 during normal), having 2 pieces of chips with tuna tar tar sitting on top of it, is NOT worth it. What the hell. Who the hell would pay $8 for one bite? It's not even a big portion. This is why you fail Koi. The California Roll was your average run-of-the-mill roll. Why the hell do they charge you $10 for it? It literally looks like the CA roll that you can find at your cheap sushi place down the street. Tastes like it too. \n\nService: This wasn't great but it wasn't bad. I think the girl was just doing her job. She wasn't friendly but she wasn't mean either. I can't really complain about her because she was still doing her job.\n\nPrice: is the ultimate fail. Really, I think you're just paying for the decor (which is pretty sweet) but other than that, I don't think it's worth getting dinner here at all. I'm not trying to be cheap here; I would happily pay more if the food was quality or the portions were bigger. What I'm basically trying to say is, I want to get my money's worth. \n\nAll in all, maybe if this place made the prices proportionate to the size and quality of their food, I think I would give this place a better rating. However, they really fail at doing that and this is why I say, come here ONLY during happy hour, if you even decide to come at all."

We were early. It seems that they were missing the arm bands. I think we waited about 30 minutes before they found the person that ran off with them.\n\nWhen we got inside we found that the main bar was packed. It took sometime to get drinks. But hey, drinks were free because of the package deal. After walking around we found out that there were multiple bars. No one really knew that there were bars in the other parts of the club. The bartenders were very cool. We chatted up a couple of them while grabbing drinks.\n\nThe restrooms, well what can I say about them. Not enough stalls for this venue. The lines were so long that I ran down stairs to use the casino restrooms on the other side of the building. When I got there, there was another huge line. At that point I wasn't sure if I was better off staying in the club or not.\n\nUpon leaving the club after having a good time despite all of the pit falls, I encountered another problem with coat check. I don't know what happened but this is where the night went to hell. The staff was calling out random numbers looking for people to pick up their coats instead of properly taking each person as they come. There was a line. Not sure for what, but there was one.\n\nAfter watching the employees calling random numbers, letting people cut the line and saying it was okay. A bunch of us started voicing our opinions. They told us that to move outside and form another line.  Everyone packed outside the door waiting. Not even five minutes went by before another line formed inside and they just gave us the, I don't know, shrug for everyone outside. Seriously what is going on here.\n\nWell after a bunch of back and forth, hollering and asking to talk to somebody in charge, we finally got our coats. I wasted an hour and twenty minutes of my life. Seriously, I am never coming back to this place. It felt like this was the largest group they've ever had. They just couldn't handle it. There were so many people working the door but nothing got done right. Sorry guys, if you get it together I am sure this place will do well."

But, I've also had the same great meal (albeit without the same ambiance and famous name) at a local sushi place down the street from where I live for under $25. \n\nIt's your call as to how much the bragging rights are worth to you if you decide to eat at Koi."

He was able to answer all of our questions, give great recommendations, and made sure we enjoyed our food without being overbearing.  We had the a few of the rolls (which were delicious) and last but not least, the sundae for desert.  The chocolate sauce they provide with the sundae is ridiculously good (wish we could have had another bowlful).  It was a perfect end to our meal.\n\nOverall our experience was impressive and will come back here soon!"

When we arrived at Planet Hollywood I stopped to ask directions to Koi and the casino assistant handed me two free cocktail vouchers!  Our table at Koi was fabulous, overlooking the Bellagio fountains across the street through awesome floor to ceiling windows.  The booth was more like a plush sofa and comfortably sat the six of us.  The ambiance was beautiful, low lighting and cozy booths and candlelit tables.\n\nAndy was our server and was extremely pleasant and helpful.  He gave honest and good advice on cocktails and also provided guidance on how to choose our food options.  My friends adored the Kobe beef pot stickers and lamb chops, I loved the duck and the tofu options and I know we all savored the buttered cod.  Really, there wasn't a bad choice on our table and we finished every plate!  The dessert platter was gorgeous and not too heavy.  The servers kept our water glasses full and the food arrived promptly.\n\nWe all wanted to do sake bombs and Andy advised us to head to the Koi lounge, we couldn't go all out with chopsticks and all, but they were happy to oblige the six of us and only charged $14 total with our voucher!  Overall we had a delightful experience at Koi and it was indeed a great start to a night we'll all remember!"

You really have to take your time eating it and savor every bite. The kobe beef is a little on the pricey side -- $55 for cutlets -- but it will rock your socks off. \n\nServer was absolutely fantastic and, upon finding out it was my birthday, added some complimentary sake and mochi dessert :-) \n\nI really didn't go headlong into the sushi this visit, but have heard the sushi is amazing, so I will concentrate on the sushi next time. \n\nOh yeah, the ambiance is cool --  modern Japanese decor, cool lighting, spacious, open, comfortable seating, sleek bar area and candles throughout."

The restaurant is too dark, which makes it hard to see the nice decor. The thing that impressed me the most was the creative drink menu. But lets face it, you don't go to a nice sushi restaurant to order a fruity martini. Everything on the menu you have had before. There was nothing new or creative that sparked my interest. You might be saying to yourself, \"that's fine, I like the basics.\" Well, if you do you can find a cheaper place to eat that is probably just as nice. The portions sizes were not worth the prices we were charged. I left there still feeling hungry. We went on a Friday night around 7:00 and there were a lot of empty tables, maybe that is a sign that the place isn't all that it's cracked up to be. There were a lot of large groups at the restaurant. So if your main issue is finding a restaurant that can seat you and 10 of your friends and you aren't really worried about the quality of food then this would be a good place. I have no problem spending a lot of money on dinner. I love to go out to eat, try new things, places, etc. But if I do I want my moneys worth and I didn't get it here."

I still don't know what it was, but it may have been the best specialty roll I've ever had.  So, if you remember - order a roll that is chef's selection. Yum!  The drinks are strong too. And when you come here you get free admission to the club attached.  Sweet deal."

Don't act like you don't!\n\nWe thought 8pm reservations on a Saturday night would mean a full restaurant, trendy vibe, and the restaurant's best servers. You know, 30th birthday-worthy treatment. Nope. If there were other people dining at Koi, they were nowhere near us. The lighting felt like being at the bar at 2AM when the fluorescents are kicked on to scoot everyone out. And our waiter had no clue what was on the menu. He tried describing the sashimi the way a freshly-pimpled teen might try to describe wine. \"There's like notes of flowers... and the texture is like, raw...\" Just stop.\n\nThe sushi was also underwhelming. We did the larger chef's selection and a few specialty rolls. The pieces on the chef's selection were really fresh tasting and worth the order. However we all felt pretty disappointed by the specialty rolls. Not a ton of flavor, but a lot of mayos and crunchies. Like what you get at the supermarket. Or Walgreens. \n\nFortunately the cocktails were strong and smoothed over the meal and service; but for over $100/person I needed more. Yes 'need'. It was my 30th birthday and I NEEDED that top notch celebration. \n\nSkip the namesake of Koi and try another sushi restaurant on the Strip."

My friend had to arrive during the afternoon to reserve our table. The first table they tried to give us had no actual table, the second was squished with no room for people to sit and we finally ended up with a table in the back, behind a curtain, nowhere near the action. Turns out bottle service was for off brand vodka only.. if you wanted a bottle of something you'd actually heard of, you were still paying $350 a bottle on top $100's we'd already paid for the table... wowza. We felt duped.\n\nMy second experience was for a girl's night out, 6 of us came for dinner. We were seated at a table near the back of the restaurant where we ordered drinks and appetizers. The drinks came out onsie twosies instead of all at once which was weird, and we waited forever for our first appetizer. We finally placed our dinner orders when a fight broke out between two groups seated in the booths behind us. It started with a few people raising their voices, then the manager came over to break it up. Before we know it some chick socks some guy smack in the face, and it's on! We were within inches of the action, literally; I had to duck to avoid getting hit myself. People were being pushed, a server ended up on the floor, tables were over turned and dishes broken while an all out brawl ensued. We grabbed our purses and got the hell out of the way! We went to the front and told them we were leaving and to please tell our waiter to cancel our orders. It was their one chance to offer us something to save face, free meals, free drinks, a return visit, something... but they didn't even apologize, they just looked dumb founded and let a table of 6 hot girls walk out the door. Sure the fight wasn't their fault, but they still have a reputation to protect and ultimately they lost our business permanently."

Cool lookin restaurant with a great view of the bellagio fountain if you get a good table.\n\nService was good, ambiance nice, but the food was extremely average. For $25 rolls you would expect them to be made with a high quality product and an amazing presentation, Just wasn't the case. Ive had much better sushi at places that are half the price. I don't mind spending top doallar on a quality product, but this place is living off the name and riding the coat tails of its other locations.\n\nAgain, the restaurant has a cool vibe and the food is Okay, but if your lookin for sushi in Vegas, there are much better spots"

We sat the lounge area and it was perfect for 10 people. Koi is beautiful, very spacious and chic. The waitress was a young beautiful asian wearing a beautiful dress and she was very attentive and friendly. She  came to check on our table several times. The Creamy Rock Shrimp Tempura was out of this world! I also tried Tuna Tartare on Crispy Wontons, Baked crab roll, Koi Crispy Rice topped with Spicy Tuna and Yellowtail Tartare. For drinks -Lemon Drop, Berry Bliss was good but not strong and Hot Sake is a better choice. The happy hour is from 5-7pm half off appetizers and drinks. If you keep your dinner receipt you can stay for the nightclub without cover charge. We did not stay for the nightclub so cannot comment on that. I usually go to places with 5stars. I was surprised to see 3&half stars but the reviews were mostly for the nightclub. The desert/birthday cake sundae was so cute! We had a blast!"

The free drinks that they were giving to ladies were sugary, sugary two sips and you are sick to your stomach sweet.  The nice thing about this club is that if you want to get some air there is a little balcony type area overlooking the Planet Hollywood casino that you can slip out to enjoy.\n\nMaybe I would have had a more enjoyable evening if all of the men who hit on me that evening weren't married!

            "review": "Okay so I was really excited to go to this place for my hubby's big birthday dinner and made reservations like 2 months in advance requesting the lounge room with the huge windows overlooking the Las Vegas strip, but of course they couldn't guarantee those spots. When the actual night comes, we were lucky enough to get that lounge table. Was it as amazing as the pictures? nope, but was it nice and left us feeling a tad exclusive? sure. We were even able to see parts of the Bellagio fountains from that view so we were happy about that.\n\nThe service was really good, the lady didn't mess up anyone's orders as there were 8 of us, and everyone pretty much enjoyed their food. We had sangria, it was good and strong but definitely not the best I've had. The food was also a okay in my opinion, since we are kind of sushi snobs and expect the best out of pricey establishments such as Koi, but then again, I kinda knew we were coming mostly for the view and good seats. The sushi was below par in my opinion, it was tasty but definitely not enough fish in the rolls, they were a tad heavy on the rice. However, our friends liked their non sushi items and their martinis that they kept on ordering. They preferred the ones with the rose petal btw. \n\nSo overall, we had a great time, had a yummy dinner, tasty drinks, and a great view. Maybe I had bigger expectations in my head, but what else is new, but my hubby left happy so I was happy that his birthday dinner was a success. However, would I do a repeat, probably not, as we probably would go to Tao next time."

The reason the BF and I along with the friends came here was because Planet Hollywood gave us a dinner credit here for being hotel guests.\n\nThe ambiance was nice for being Vegas and the service wasn't too shabby, but the food was seriously lacking for the amount we spent.  The 6 of us spent over $100 each including the dinner credit we received.  If i knew the less than yummy meal would cost this much, I would have gotten the spa credit instead.\n\nWe ordered the kobe beef roll and it was quite disappointing.  I don't think it was real kobe or wagu beef at all.  It wasn't tender and didn't have the melt in your mouth effect.  Their special crispy tuna was not crispy at all.  Sweet shrimp was more like baby sweet shrimp.  It's half the size of what we can get back home and at least 3 times cheaper.  They don't prepare the heads fried either.  Not to mention the $12 for 3 little cubes of adashi tofu.  The ice cubes in my ice water were bigger than the size of the tofu.  The rainbow roll was just like home if you go to any Korean owned Japanese sushi places but again 3 times more expensive at Koi.  They are very skimpy on the uni and small portions.  As a matter affect, everything here is tiny little portions designed for babies that cost at least $30 a pop.\n\nBy all means, if you have the money to blow, then I guess you can come eat here but the food isn't orgasmic."

Luckily, after our first afternoon outing, we went back to our hotel room at Planet Hollywood and found a discount coupon for 15% off dinner at Koi sitting on top our pillow. I bet it was strategically placed there by housekeeping, but nonetheless a great idea. I immediately made reservations for 6 PM through Open Table to take advantage of accumulating dining points and to make sure we had a table. No problems there.\n\nThe restaurant is located upstairs next to Holly Madison's Peepshow. A couple of tables and sofas were placed before the hostess check-in booth. When we arrived for our reservations, the restaurant was dimly lit. The host walked us through the restaurant and sat us in a booth. At 6 PM, there were only two other couples and a handful of people at the sushi bar, but I figured people were still sleeping or getting ready for their evening events.\n\nThe waiter was very polite and courteous, answered all our questions, and made suggestions after we asked what was good. After reviewing their extensive menu, we ordered:\nSeafood Miso Soup $8, Miso soup with bits of clam, squid, tofu.\nCrispy Rice(Tuna) $16, Uniquely made, these Tar tare styled tuna over a crispy rice sushi were a hit with us. The rice was crispy outside and chewy inside.\nFresh Oysters on a Half Shell(6) $24, 6 flavorful fresh oysters over a bed of ice garnished with lemon slice and dipping sauce.\nEdamame $5 Lightly Sea Salted.\nGrilled skirt steak $28, Piled high like a log cabin, the succulent slices were stacked 3x3, garnished with Alfalfa and paddling in a tangy reduction sauce.\nBowl of white rice $3, Got rice?\nTotal Bill = $77.18 before tip. Priceless.\n\nEach appetizer and entr\u00e9e plate was nicely decorated and simply beautiful. Pictures are proof, but tasting is believing. Therefore, I must encourage you to visit Koi at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. My first experience here demands a return visit the next time around."

An awesome view.  Our server was VERY informative and helpful.  \n\nDRINK:  He recommended the most AMAZING bottle of unfilered sake.  It was to die for.  And I love unfiltered sake.  This was a new one that I haven't tried.  It was smooth, silky.... i wish i had a bottle of it right now.  \n\nBITES:  He also started us out with edemame.  Which was basic...basically yummy and healthy.  Did we have miso soup?  Can't remember.... was the sake that good that i don't remember if i had miso soup?  \n\nSUSHI and SASHIMI:  We had a few rolls.  2 or 3.  Again, why do i not remember them...maybe the sake WAS that good.  Anywhoo, I also had the salmon sashimi.  Or was that a different night.  I'm killing myself.  We also had a scallop dish that was good.  But my favorite of the night was sashimi tuna (i think it was tuna) finished with foie gras.  OMG this was divine.  Okay, the sashimi and foie gras PLUS the sake...i wish it was in front of me right now.  \n\nDESSERT:  So we were gonna go.  But our wonderful server (whom I forgot his name...darn) had 2 desserts sent over on the house and some more sake.  And if you know me.........i do NOT turn down sake.  The desserts were yummy...but the sake was warm and made my tummy feel warm and fuzzy.  \n\nWould i go here again?  Hell yes!  for Sashimi foie gras and unfiltered sake."

Actually soggy and soaked in the oil it was deep fried in.  The tuna on top was hardly spicy and had very little flavor.  At the very least, it was fresh.  Definitely NOT worth $16 and if this is one of their signature dishes, they may want to brush up on it.  \n\nFeel the Heat roll:\nSpicy scallop, crab, avocado rolled up with seared tuna and spicy mayo sauce on top.  Very fresh ingredients, great flavors and lovely spicy kick.  By far, the best of the 3.  But you know, it's just a roll, and a $22 one at that. \n\nLike most Vegas venues that somehow turn into clubs/lounges after 10pm, it has very dim lighting and dark corners.  \n\nService was great - friendly and prompt, but it was a Monday night."

Service was excellent - water refilled regularly, waitress was friendly and helpful, and the food was very good quality.\n\nI would echo the recommendation for the Bento Box sampler. While a bit pricey(as everything on the Strip in Vegas) it was probably the best thing we had here.\n\nKoi only falls short in a few points. It is hard to get around the high prices of dining at a Strip location - just can't call it 5 stars given the price to value ratio. Also, the ambiance was a bit strange. The modern furniture led to some weird seating - tables for 2 are setup for side-by-side seating with a couch/bench and artificial plants behind. A branch was poking me and I needed to rearrange it a bit.\nThe noise level is a bit too high for our taste. \n\nI suspect most of the low reviews are related to the bar (which we did not use) or are responses to price 'sticker shock'. If you can get over the prices the experience can be quite enjoyable - at least it was for us."

No apologies, no nothing from the server- really?\n\nI ordered the spicy seared albacore with onions which were not bad- also had a baked scallop roll which i found just ok. Friends ordered a variety of the fish, signatures, and rolls and thought that it was mediocre.\n\nFor the food, would give a 3. Felt that the prices were reasonable for what it is. Its a nice trendy looking space- looks like a power lunch spot, similar vibe to katsuya over here.

However, the next day I asked a friend if they received the drink and dessert. She said that the bachelorette did receive it, BUT, the waiter told them it was \"complimentary on the house.\" I asked a few of the girls to make sure it was not a misunderstanding but they all confirmed that my name was never mentioned and they were told it was on the house. I reached out to the manager. I was upset that the restaurant took credit for something I paid for. He was adamant that the waiter told them it was from me. I think I believe four of my friends over a random waiter who was probably scared to tell his manager that he messed up. Regardless, the manager kept telling me that what I was told by my friends is not true (essentially alluding to the fact that they were lying). I don't believe this was handled in a professional way and it definitely was not worth the added gratuity. I would recommend in the future that management handle these situations more professionally.\n\nQuick update: The general manager reached out to me a few days after to apologize for how this was all handled. He offered to refund me for everything and was very apologetic. I thought it was very professional of him to do that. Therefore, because of that I am giving the place 2 stars instead of 1."

I couldn't believe I was eating a slice of fatty tuna- it really Yates like a5 wagyu!! The rolls were good too, the koi crispy rice was very flavorful though I wish thee was less rice and more spicy tuna. But maybe because the tuna was spicier than average that's why they ratioed the rice and tuna that way. Also try the hamachi fusion with truffles and citrus oil.

            "review": "On my latest stint to Vegas I decided to go back to Koi as my Mom was visiting and I feel disappointed with all the hype I gave it as this go 'round Koi unfortunately let me down.\n\nI still have to say the staff once again was both accommodating and not the general fake friendly you get in most places. We did manage to get the same waiter as before and that ultimately at least saved the meal (for me anyways). He laughed when my wife yelled \"HEY WE HAD HIM LAST TIME\". Only in Vegas?!? Ha-ha. \n\nThe food itself looked to have gone through a complete overhaul since we had been there before. The portions were smaller and the presentation lacked from before, but the price certainly didn't change which for what we got vs. what was paid for well I'll leave that up to your imagination of where I planned to go with that.\n\nOnce again we definitely indulged in the menu and held nothing back that night. e collectively shared the Baked Scallop Roll, the Baked Lobster Roll, the Kobe Surf and Turf Roll, the Spicy Tuna Roll, and another one with Shrimp that I did not catch the name of (it was a \"secret\" one not offered on the menu that was suggested).\n\nThe Baked Scallop Roll and Lobster Roll were missing the sushi sauce and flakes that it had been presented with during my first visit which I was really bummed about. However I will not discount the taste because it still ranks up as one of the best I've had to date. The Surf and Turf roll I really recommend because this hands down was the best of the night. I think the man in me says it was the Kobe Beef that partnered with the sushi part of it just sky rockets into taste oblivion. \n\nAll in all, I wonder what brought on the change to the presentation of the food, but it still by far is one of the better sushi locations I've inhabited. I can't say I'll never be back because I'm sure I will, but I'm not exactly having an itch to return after seeing the overhaul to my loved establishment. BRING BACK THE SAUCE AND THE BIGGER PORTIONS KOI, PLEASE!"

            "review": "We dined at Koi for my birthday recently and I was rather impressed after reading the so-so reviews on here. I must mention first that the service was top notch, our waiter was very friendly and helpful. I do admit there were a few times when he wasn't on top of refilling our sake glasses, but they are pretty small glasses so at least it made the bottle last a bit longer!\n\nWe had a couple of appetizers, Hamachi Fusion & Spicy Seared Albacore, both of which we really enjoyed! The truffle essence was a nice touch to the Hamachi Fusion as my husband and I are both huge fans of truffled anything! For sushi, we had the Baked Crab Roll, Dragon Roll, Rainbow Roll and my husband had some Uni (I'm not a fan!). We LOVED the Dragon Roll, it was excellent! I felt that the crab roll had a little too much rice and not enough substance, but the flavor was great without being too overwhelmingly saucy as some baked rolls can be. My husband enjoyed the Uni, although he said it wasn't the best he's ever had, but it wasn't at all bad. Everything was very fresh, very flavorful and exceeded our expectations. \n\nFor dessert, I already had my heart set on the creme brulee when our waiter brought me out some birthday mochi, it was mango flavored and SO yummy! It was a small serving, so we still ordered the creme brulee. I'm a creme brulee fanatic and bake it a lot myself, so I'm pretty picky with the stuff and this one was perfect! The consistency was right  on and the sugar was perfectly caramelized on top, not too crunchy and not too soft. \n\nI'm docking 1 star off of my review mostly for the lack of a chef's tasting menu. They did have a chef's platter which we only knew of by asking, but we really enjoy tasting menus at sushi restaurants where you can also sample their best salads, appetizers, entrees AND sushi all in one meal without buying full servings of each. A great example of this is at Katana in LA! All in all a great meal nonetheless, and we would definitely go back!"

I got there alittle early and the contestants from Miss USA were there and having drinks and I was happy and in heaven.  \n\nMy friend finally arrived late as always after the beauties had left and we had the Chilean Sea Bass, soft shell crab, Ca roll with baked scallop, and a dragon roll.\n\nThe Bass was good.  the crab tasted the same as every other place i've been.  The CA roll was weird looking but tasted real good it had a large piece of baked scallop on top. the dragon roll had all these flakes on it-tons of it as a matter of fact.\n\nThe entrance to the restaurant had 3 buddhas in the formation of the hear no evil, speak no evil and see no evil which was kinda funny until you realize its Buddha.  Is that bad luck to do that to Buddha?\n\n4 stars but they get five for the beauties from the Miss USA pageant!!!!!!!"

I got the wasabi braised short ribs which melted in my mouth and were just falling off the bone...\n\nOverall it was a wonderful dining experience. The food was top notch and the service was great.  I would recommend Koi to anyone."

The atmosphere was dull, the food ranged from OK to yuck (we tried to send one dish back, but they weren't interested), service was OK but not great, and they close early. Very disappointing. The best part of the experience was spinning the prayer wheels near the entrance, hopefully to spare our party from food poisoning."

But since I was here with my co-workers for a work dinner we got to expense it (woo-hoo!). \n\nWe were here on a Sunday night for dinner and sat in the main dining area. There's a section that's very loungy with couches that overlooks the Bellagio...great view but the couches seem like they would be uncomfortable to eat an entire meal on. \n\nI got a bottle of the Star Rabbit sparkling sake- my ultimate favorite drink! I never find it anywhere and I was so excited they had it here. \nWe started with the Cucumber Sunomono- a light pickled cucumber salad. I thought it was a great refereshing way to start the meal. Then we got the Vegetable Tempura which had asparagus, onions, shiitake mushrooms, eggplant, green beans and yams. I thought it was delicious. We also started with the Tuna Sashimi which was to die for. It came served on top of the most amazing sauce with jalapeno and garlic chips. One of my co-workers also ordered the kobe beef potstickers which he said were fabulous.\nFor our entree I shared the Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Tempura and Vegetable rolls which were all great. The spicy tuna was my favorite. A little random but we also shared a side of the Shishito Mashed Potatoes which were so creamy and delectable. \n\nDessert had to be the most amazing part of the meal. We ordered the dessert platter which consisted of Molten Chocolate Cake, Koi's Signature Cheesecake (white chocolate with raspberries....YUM), Berry Cobbler w/ice cream, and Vanilla Creme Brulee. Oh. My. GOD. \nIt was so incredible. Between 6 people we devoured the entire thing. \n\nOur service was a little slow at times but our waiter was still attentive and very nice. \nAll in all a fabulous experience."

Don't get me wrong, but the lobster was also very delicious.

My biggest concerns were on portion size and the quality (lack of quality) of ingredients.  We ordered the Kobe beef potstickers and for $20, we received 5 shriveled up gyozas that were not presented well.  At $4 a pop, definitely not worth it.  We also ordered a supposed king crab roll that had the tiniest bit of king crab and was filled with mostly imitation crab - yuck.  Also, I could tell they used cheap rice for the sushi.  \n\nTrust me, for the same price, you can get a much better meal at Shibuya (mgm grand), blue ribbon (cosmopolitan), yellowtail (bellagio), or Tao (palazzo).  \n\nAlso, the ambiance sucks here,  the restaurant was pretty empty."

I'm not a fan of dessert but oh wow....THAT DESSERT is amazing!!!!!!!! We got the banana bread pudding topped with vanilla ice cream, drizzled in caramel sauce and around it, were fresh slices of bananas. I would seriously come back to Koi JUST for this dessert!!!! \n\nI recommend this place for a light,  quick bite to eat before heading out for the night on the town.

So chic and sexy.  \n\nI can grub, these are the favorites:  Tiger prawns, Lamb Chops, Softshell Crab, Hamachi Fusion.  But everything is pretty much really good.\n\nService at both is pretty normal for this level of restaurant, but what I really appreciated about Vegas...we were waiting in the lounge having a drink waiting to be seated and I minorly slipped on an unseen patch of water, and spilled my entire full martini glass.  I wouldn't have been surprised if it was due to my own clumsiness, but they saw the mini puddle right away (the floor is really shiny and glittery and could only be viewed from a certain angle) and apologized profusely, replacing my martini immediately, and giving me another comped one on top of that.  Small thing; but actions like that speak to a place's character."

My Fiance and I went here to celebrate Valentines Day this year (2009) and thought we'd try out this restaurant since we've never been. The portions of the food was very small (My Fiance ordered the Grilled Skirt Steak and I ordered the Dragon Roll). The Skirt Steak was too salty and it was served to us in small cut pieces, which I though was odd. My Dragon Roll was okay, but I've tasted better back in my hometown of San Diego. Overall, for the price (which was expensive) I would have been happier if they served bigger portions, and better tasting food. I porbably will not go back to this restaurant. Nicely decorated restaurant though. Very hip and trendy!"

I didnt get to try a lot of the other dishes, so this is based solely off the sushi rolls, but to counter that, the rest of the menu was just not eye catching. \n\nBeing said, I probably won't go back here. They wouldnt let us take our scotch glasses even out of the restaraunt and I am talking about 18 year old Macallan  that they charged us a crapload for.

The menu says clams, shrimp, and bay scallops.  There was one clam which was very good.  The shrimp was fine and the bay scallops were good, too.\n\nFor the main course, I got the sesame encrusted lobster tail.  The plating was artfully done.  The lobster was OK.  I had two issues.  One, encrusted means one thing to me and another to Koi.  I imagined more sesame but there was merely a sprinkling.  Second, the lobster tail didn't have a very distinctive lobster flavor.  It was rather bland.  The kitchen helps you out by cutting under the meat and along the sides and then across the meat.  You're able to eat it easily without having the whole tail removed from its shell.  With the lobster, you get baby bok choy.\n\nFor dessert, I chose the flourless molten chocolate cake.  It comes with some berries and vanilla ice cream with butterscotch sauce.  This was excellent!\n\nService was very good.  My iced tea glass was replaced with a fresh one as I neared the end of each one--no need to ask for a refill.  \n\nThis place just lacked the 4 star experience I'd hoped for.

Spicy garlic edamame was so good and warm with a hint of spiciness; tuna tartare was very good as well with a hint of spiciness; rainbow roll and dragon rolls were also very good. Cocktail didn't have much alcohol in it though. And the butterscotch eggs pair well with a cup of hot green tea. Prices were reasonable as well. Would come again. We went on a Sunday night about 8pm."

            "review": "Came here a couple weeks ago for dinner, and pretty much everything we tried was delicious! For appetizers, I really liked the salmon carpaccio, it was fresh and the sauce was on point. The lobster tacos were a bit on the small side, but we're good. For rolls, the surf and turf roll was great with the kobe beef on top and the shrimp tempura inside. For entrees, I got the Kobe sirloin med well, and it was kinda tough. I still liked it, since I don't like my meat red, but for $50, I wished it wasn't so tough. Although I did really enjoy the food, it is pretty expensive for what you get. Our bill for 5 people was a little over $400, and we had only ordered a total of 4 cocktails. If you're on the strip, and want some delicious Japanese food, and have some money to burn, then this is definitely the place you should go to. \n\nI'm deducting a star for service, which was not as great as you'd expect for such a high end place. I was really turned off when they were bringing us a roll that we didn't order and when we said we didn't order it, the table nearby said it was theirs, then the server picked up a roll at their table and gave it to us. I didn't feel comfortable saying anything at the time, but I thought it was super weird that they'd give us a roll that had been sitting at another table for who knows how long, particularly for such an expensive place when we're spending so much to dine. I also felt like they kept trying to clear our table, when we were trying to take our time. \n\nThe ambiance was super modern and trendy. It was kinda dark and romantic. You feel like you're cool, just by sitting in this restaurant. \n\nI wouldn't mind coming back here for a special occasion, hopefully service will be better."

I think we had a party of 12 or something, they made reservations for 9pm, but we called, they said we could come in early. \n\nAppetizers for the entire table: edamame & Veggie Tempura! Both super yummy... \n\nI then had the Miso Soup & the Cucumber Sunomono! It was the best. I love cucumber salad, and the cucumbers were sliced thinly and marinated well. \n\nThen I had the skirt steak... Which was great, and much more serving than i expected.  Since I cant eat most shellfish,  i tend to avoid sushi, but even that looked mouthwatering. The guy sitting next to me ordered a few pieces and it looked delish! Being that we were a large group, and we all ordered something different, I was able to \"sample\" everything the menu had to offer basically. I didn't have one thing that was bad! Just a few things I tried: \n\nChilean Sea Bass, \nMiso Bronzed Black Cod \nand some short ribs \n\nEverything was accompanied by Sake... warm sake, cold sake... any kind of sake. Everything was good! \n\nI will go back next time I'm in Vegas... Another bonus of the night George Costanza was sitting right behind me (Jason Alexander for those of you who dont know)"

Our server was awesome and very knowledagble about the menu. We shared everything, including our creative and delicious cocktails. We had some sort of siracha margarita and a lychee mojito. Delicious! We shared halibut sashimi (it was ok), and 2 delicious other appetizers of yellowtail roll and edamame dumplings (my favorite thing of the evening). We also shared 2 entrees of black cod and the red snapper. I couldn't decide which one I liked more because they were both amazing. The only 2 reasons this resaurant did not get the full 5 stars is because of an edamame incident, and their desserts were so blase that we passed on dessert. Dessert choices were things like strawberry shortcake and banana split sundaes. Not worthy of such a great restaurant.The edamame thing was our server asked if we wanted to start with edamame, we said no, they showed up on the table anyway, we sent them back, and then they ended up on our bill. Our server immediately took them off and was very apologetic about the whole thing. Other that those 2 minor things, I would absolutely go back to Koi in a heartbeat!"

Made no difference.\n\nWe broke one of our cardinal Vegas rules: hot chicks never pay cover. Yes, we caved and paid $10 each to get inside Koi.  They cut off her green wristband and charged us the same price each. Nice buddha theme with comfy couches once inside, but just an average dj and a tiny dance floor.\n\nThe cool thing about Koi is that it has a balcony that looks down on the casino floor right at a major pedestrian intersection of escalators, pole dancers, and card tables.  The uncool thing about Koi is that the bartenders don't know how to make classic drinks. An Old Fashioned? Not a chance.  Free drinks for chicks? Not exactly. The booze is free but they wanted to charge us for the Red Bulls.\n\nWe were bored within 5 minutes so we ditched ph for the view at Level 107 on top of the Stratosphere.\n\nI could go back to Koi, but really...it's not got much working for it.

When we get there the place was dead, upon entering it was like a western film when they show tumbleweed blowing by.\n\n Later on it did get busier though. This was very frustrating because they had only two bartenders and had a \"strict policy\" on one drink person despite everyone being all you can drink within the place (part of their normal promotion). I put their strict policy in quotations because it only applied to people the bartenders weren't friends with. We later saw a guy give some multi stage handshake with a guest and he walked away quad fisting drinks. We asked the bartender about this and he said that he \"saw him earlier with 3 other people \" and that he wasn't given double drinks. \n\nLong story short. Stay away from this place in LV.

My husband and I were staying at Planet Hollywood to see the Britney Spears concert (Britney!!!!) and made reservations for dinner at Koi to eat before the show. We arrived at 6:30 and were seated right away. The girls at the hostess stand were super rude and led us to our table in total silence. \n\nAfter we were seated, we were greeted by a super friendly waitress and our drink orders were taken. Drinks were brought out quickly and we ordered our food. We weren't too hungry so we just shared the spicy tuna crispy rice, glazed green beans, edamame and the lobster roll. \n\nSo here's a breakdown of the food:\nSpicy tuna crispy rice ($16)- Meh. Nothing special and not very spicy. Wasn't good or bad. \nLobster Roll ($20)- Gross. It was a slimy cut roll with an insane amount of mayo on top. The only thing you could taste on this was mayonnaise. It was so bad, that my husband and I each tried a piece (after removing the big glob of mayo on top) and couldn't eat any more. Probably one of the most unappetizing sushi experiences I have ever had. \nEdamame ($6)- It was fine. But really, how can you screw this dish up? \nString Beans ($10)- The string beans were okay, but tasted like something I could easily make at home.\n\nOur bill ended up being well over $100 (including drinks). We expected to pay this much, but were bummed out that the food was so disappointing. \n\nAn extra star for our waitress, who was very very friendly and fun to chat with. Also, the decor is nice.\n\nAfter the Britney concert, we randomly ended up back here because apparently this place turns into a \"club\" late night and we didn't feel like leaving our hotel to go somewhere else. It was okay. Drinks were overpriced and the dance floor was tiny. We still have fun though."

Why, with a delicious meal, of course!\n\nKoi is a beautiful space in a beautiful casino.  I love the atmosphere and the way they decorated the interior.  It was lush, luxurious, understated and made me feel like a million bucks.  As big as it is, you still feel really cozy tucked away in your booth.  They did a great job in designing the seating.\n\nThe Ginger Kiss cocktail was pretty good.  I wish it had more of ginger taste and less ginger ale but still tasty.  I liked that it wasn't overly sweet.  \n\nThe grade of fish was pretty good too.  My uni literally melted in my mouth.  I ended up eating 4 pieces because I'm a piggy.  The saba was also delicious!  I had 4 pieces of those too.\n\nThe roast duck and shishito peppers weren't bad but weren't my favorite.  The duck was cooked perfectly but the flavors just didn't....meld well for me.  \n\nThe ahi and foie gras was, hands down, my favorite.  It was citrusy from the ponzu but earthy from the foie.  It melted in my mouth and I savored every last bite.  Talk about sex for my tastebuds.\n\nThe Koi crispy rice with spicy tuna was pretty good too.  It's basically spicy tuna served nigiri style but the rice is toasted.  If you've never had it here (or anywhere else, for that matter), give it a try.  I've had something just like this at another sushi spot in Los Angeles and this held it's own against it.  \n\nWe ended the night with CHOCOLATE Creme brulee.  It.  Was.  Awesome.  I don't know which chef got drunk and decided to mix in some chocolate to the standard creme brulee but I'm really glad they did.  I'm not a big dessert person but I found myself wishing I got one of these for myself so that I wouldn't have to share with my friend.\n\nBy the time our 2 hour dinner was over, we were both looking for wheelbarrows to cart us out of there."

Everything was as good as I remember it from LA with the exception of the crispy rice with tuna.

That one was not... but YMMV.  It is a signature dish so on another day it may be better.  \n\nStill love the kobe carpaccio and the shrimp rolls.  The seared tuna with red onion could use a few more slices of tuna.  They're really stingy on that one.   It's a nice combination, but I've had it twice now and I don't think I'd order it again.\n\nWe also tried the kobe pot stickers and they were good but not great. Tasty enough, and I particularly liked the little bit of heat that the dipping sauce had on the finish.. but just not mind blowing overall.  I wouldn't turn one away but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to order it again either.  \n\nKoi is expensive ... so all things considered you might be wiser to spend your money at a restaurant where the atmosphere is more upscale and  service is more attentive.   I'm glad I got to experience this location but next time I won't make it a destination."

Was in Vegas with girlfriends staying at Bellagio and wanted a break from the endless carbs we'd been consuming so looked for nearby sushi spot that could take us a time that wouldn't interfere with our evening prefacing before hitting the scene. (10pm)\n\n\nKoi was quiet (read: we were one of 4 tables) but it was 10 pm and this place tends to switch to a club scene around 11. Sushi was great. Price was cheap!! 8 rolls for the price of what you usually get 6 for here in DC. Waiter was kind lame, but whatever- this place served its purpose. We seriously debated going there again the next night but our plans didn't work to fit it in. Great sushi overall!"

I get what they're trying to do here - young, fun asian fusion atmosphere - but the food just doesn't cut it. \n\nHere's what we ordered:\n- Cucumber Sunomono: whatever\n- Salmon Carpaccio: While this dish wasn't awful you could def taste the fishiness of the salmon...somewhere where you're paying this type of money and with it's reputation should not have fishy salmon. I've also had this dish at another restaurant and it was waaaaaay better. \n- Tuna Tartare: this dish was pretty good\n- Vegetable Tempura: tasty\n- Sea Scallop Special: Although the scallops were the biggest things I've ever seen the flavor was blah. The black rice was SO salty I couldn't eat this dish and I lOVE love love scallops. \n- Dragon Roll: this was good and covered in tempura...drowning in it actually. \n- Lobster Tail: I wish they had more veggies on it\n- Miso Black Cod: pretty good\n\nThe drinks were good but nothing special but especially pricey. \n\nThe food came out way too fast and almost all at the same time. They had no interest in letting us enjoy our dinner or conversation. Also the waiter spilled a glass of water and watched it continuing to spill all over the table and was not even apologetic. Good thing the busboys were on top of their game and took care of the problem. \n\nOverall - total disappointment."

A guy was handing out wristbands downstairs and said the place was poppin so we paid the $20 cover for \"open bar\" and when we got in there we could not move AT ALL and people were starting to fight! We didn't get any drinks because we couldn't even get close to the bar. Also my friend was groped and it was so crowded she couldn't see who it was. DISGUSTING.

Because all my trips here are centered around eating, I hold Vegas eateries to a much higher standard than home. \n\nOn our first night of restaurant hopping we decided to try Koi in Planet Hollywood. It just so happens we went on the premier night of Justin Timberlake's and Ben Affleck's new movie, Runner Runner, so it was a little challenging gaining access to the restaurant. Once we got in, we were seated immediately and offered our choice of table away from the chaos. \n\nAs with everywhere else, we asked the waiter to make some recommendations. I started with the blueberry bunny sake which was very girly and light. We then shared several small plates: \n-Crispy rice spicy tuna: yumm! I'm not a   spicy tuna fan but this had great flavor and just the right heat level. \n-Togarashi blackened scallops on brown sugar and butter saut\u00e9ed bok choi: amazing! I love scallops and these were seared to perfection!\n-Lobster tacos: better than Fix! (Which is my go-to for lobster tacos). I think the yuzu infused guacamole made this dish. \n\nThe service was great and the food delish! We would definitely revisit Koi on our next trip!"

I think my friend who ordered the lamb looked like he had the best serving size, but then again it was more fat than meat.  Not one person in our party was full after having dinner here.  \n\nThe service was good, and it's really pretty here, but this place didn't leave a good enough impression to come back."

Like its other locations in LA and NY, the interior of the gorgeous restaurant is zen-chic. The floor to ceiling windows provided an amazing view of Bellagio Lake. We asked if we could be seated in the lounge facing out to the lake because there were several tables inside - and all unoccupied, but unfortunately they were \"reserved for friends of the owner.\" Disappointing. Our booth was pretty nice though, and we were able to get a glimpse of the water show every now and then. \n\nThe food was pretty tasty, although nothing was mind-blowing. It may have been because we stuck with ordering rolls, and not the signature dishes like miso black cod or Kobe beef filet mignon. Our friendly server suggested his favorites to us. We had the scallop roll, dragon roll, baked lobster roll and crispy rice topped with spicy tuna. The baked lobster roll with cream sauce melted in our mouths and was hands down our favorite. The crispy rice with spicy tuna was supposed to be their most popular dish, but the texture of the spicy tuna was odd. We weren't quite sure why it was so popular. It was super spicy though! We ended our simple meal with a simple dessert - mango mochi ice cream with blackberries. \n\nI'm sure Koi is hot and happening on Friday and Saturday though, so get your fabulous self over there on those nights! They totally have the potential of being 4+ star worthy."

The pot stickers tasted store-bought; we had much, much better ones at Todd English PUB by the Aria lobby.\n\nJudging by the menu, it seems Koi is pared down to basics familiar to people with only a causal interest with sushi or Japanese food.\n\nThe staff were very friendly if not a little too eager.  A bunch of different people stopped by every few minutes to top off water, ask if we are okay, or take dishes away.\n\nSorry to say we liked this place years ago, but I don't think we'll be coming back, because there are just many better options in Vegas."

Our table shared the veggie tempura, the large bento box and a few sushi rolls. Everything melted in my mouth!! My favorite was the rock shrimp-to die for. I also ordered this cucumber martini which was so refreshing and almost a palate cleanser with my food. \n\nAlthough this restaurant is pricey, the food was enough to keep me full. I'd say the quality was well worth the price. If you're staying at Planet Hollywood or coming here to spend time in the casino/watch a show, I highly recommend this place.

To an empty club.

I had called a month in advance to reserve a table for this size group, and had no problems doing so. Upon arrival on Saturday night, we were escorted to the back where we saw THREE round booths, which meant our party of 12 had to split up. This was a bit disappointing as it totally defeated the purpose of me reserving a table for a party of 12. How was I supposed to choose one booth to sit at when all of my friends were there because of me? I was a bit more disappointed at the fact that this was never mentioned to me and I had called this restaurant at least 3 times regarding this reservation.\n\nThe service was incredibly slow...and our food was coming out at all different times (even the food we ordered at the same booth). Another sign of poor service, our water cups remained empty for over 20 minutes while servers passed our area at least 3 times. We finally had to call one over and mention to him that we need more water. I would expect more of a restaurant with such hefty prices.\n\nWhile the sushi and other entrees were decent, it's not enough to get us back anytime soon. There are way too many options in Vegas, and unfortunately this was just a big miss for us."

Imagine nigiri, but the rice is CRISPY and some fiery fresh tuna atop.  \n-Yellowtail & Scallion roll $15, 8 maki pieces, asked for spicy, & they zig zagged some sriracha sauce on the plate, not my idea of spicy, but  it was surprisingly good, some pieces were lacking in quantity of fish.\n-Hamachi Fusion $22, sliced hamachi w/slices of jalapeno & a light sauce, wonderfully buttery.  I think I can safely say this is as good as Nobu's, or better, b/c it's got MORE heat.\n-Baked Lobster Roll $22, 6 maki pieces, the bf liked this, it's a little heavy for my taste, pieces of lobster in the middle of the roll, with creamy sauce atop, tasted like warm sour cream & onion flavor.  \n-Miso Black Cod $27, fairly big piece of cod, the miso glaze reminded me of hoisin sauce, I thought it was a bit too thick.  The fish quality was not compromised and I liked the grilled veggies.\n\nDrink: 4oz glass of Nanbushi Sake, nice smooth finish, went well with all of the dishes.  $12\n\nPictures are on their way!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review 11/12/07:\n\nOfficial opening on 11/9/07.  \n\nThe strip's newest Japanese Fusion restaurant @ Planet Hollywood. \n\nViews are enviable: facing Bellagio's acclaimed fountains. \n\nSignature hot dishes: Miso glazed cod, Kobe beef filet mignon & soft shell crab w/ponzu sauce.  \n\nAnd YES this is another COPY from the LA and NY locations.\n\nCalled tonight for reservations, but it seems they are DARK on Mondays, at least after a BIG opening weekend.\n\nI'm looking forward to another sushi option on the strip."

The glaze is just so addicting and goes well with the crispy breading.\n\nSpicy Crunchy Yellowtail Tartare- Tender fish full of flavor. It's typically what you would expect in a Yellowtail Tartare at other places.\n\nKoi Crispy Rice- famous dish. If you decide to come definitely try this. I chose to top it with the spicy tuna which went really well with the dish. The fish is also tender which goes nicely with the crispy rice. HOWEVER, it comes in a small portion with only a few pieces so expect your satisfaction on this menu item to be cut short.\n\nExpect it to be a bit pricey when it comes to the food, and the only money worth spending here is on the drink specials during happy hour."

When our 2 pcs of spicy tuna on crispy rice came, it looked like such a small serving, we joked to our waiter about it.

Then our shrimp entree came and we were pleasantly surprised that it was such a healthy serving. We joked once again with our server, only to be told that we \"accidentally\" received the full price menu size and it actually should have been half that size since we used Groupon. He said \"it's too late now, what am I going to do, ask the chef to remove half?\" Wow, we were floored. If we had paid $140 for that meal, I would have been disappointed.

The view was nice able to see part of the bellagio water show.\n\nI brought my mom and although the sushi was a bit disappointing, the overall experience made up for it.  Although, if you bring seniors..make sure it's before 10pm.  Otherwise, they start playing really loud hip hop music and it's hard to hear across the table.\n\n1) Service: Impeccable, and had one guy take the order, one guy delivering the drinks, and another delivering the food.  It wasn't busy yet so perhaps they were working the tip angle.  \n\n2) Seating: If possible, try to use opentable (not only can you score points, but you can request the window area to sit with at least a view).  The inside area was more bamboo like but the tables seemed quite close to each other so I was glad to sit near the window.  The sofas were quite comfy but a bit too deep (had to stuff 2 pillows behind me so that I could sit up straight).  You can however practically take a nap on those sofas but definitely different feel.  The inside area reminds me of the KOI location in los angeles.\n\n3) Food:  Down to the nitty gritty the sushi wasn't all bad but the portion size of typical sushi restaurants were definitely small.  We ordered the seared kobi on top of the roll and what we got was uncooked beef.  We had to send back the order for the meat to be cooked all the way through.  I guess I'm not the pro sushi eater however I do like my meat cooked.  We ordered another different kobi dish but it was just strips of kobe beef with some sauce and mushrooms.  All I had to ask was WHERE WERE THE MUSHROOMS?  Perhaps they were shredded but the restaurant was too dark to really notice anyways.  There went another $22 bucks...haha.  The dessert was really good.  I ordered the creme brulee which had a vanilla like taste to it and it wasn't too sweet inside nor on top (burnt crust) which was nice.  We ordered the eel and avocado but there was another roll that was similar but more expensive.  So make sure you know the specifics of the names of the rolls so you don't end up ordering two of the same thing.\n\nI would go back for the ambiance if there weren't other sushi places to go to, but will venture out to others on my next trip to vegas."

Indians are technically Asians too.\"  \nT S: \".................  Oh you are right Indians are I guess Asian.  I see your point.\"  \n\n(I wasn't talking to him with a funky tone and he was smiling... )\n\n\nI liked their special cocktails but they were priced at $15-22.  I prefer non-mixed, on the rock kind of drinks anyways. I didn't like their food.  It was just OK... nothing special.\nHow can I take the restaurant seriously as a Japanese restaurant if they have low sodium soy sauce on the each table? When I saw that, I lost all the hopes for their sushi...  \nSo I ordered non traditional dishes.\n\n1. Crispy Rice Topped with Spicy Tuna. $15 - Too much going on.  If you like \"American\" sushi such as Dragon roll or Philadelphia roll you may get it.  I didn't.  The rice was too crispy tasted like butter and Spicy Tuna was seasoned overwhelmingly that you couldn't taste the tuna.  I guess if you don't like raw fish, you may like it.  What is the point of eating sushi then...\n2. Sirloin Kobe Style Shishito Mashed Potatoes, Truffle Sauce. $42 - I was happy that they at least stated Kobe \"style\" since it was NOT real Kobe beef. (I always talk about the difference between \"real\" Kobe beef and American Kobe style beef.  I talked about Kobe beef more in this review   http://www.yelp.com/biz/lucky-devils-los-angeles#hrid:9DsfdTEIdKVD9LciRxT7Lw ) The beef was not marbled by fat and it was on the chewy side.  I was very disappointed with the stake but the mashed potatoes were tasty.\n3. Grilled Japanese Eggplant $8 - It was just ok.  The sauce was on the sweet side.  I like clean sauce such as ponzu sauce on the grilled eggplant better.\n\n        \nFYI, 88% of the item in their menu was not traditional Japanese cuisine.  I am ok with that.  I don't mind Japanese fusion dishes if they are tasty.\n\nI give 0 star for their food, 1 star for nice friendly staff / service and 1 star for the decor / view.\n\n\nVideo of Koi sushi chef: http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2008/02/koi.php\n-Note for the video- you cannot say Rainbow Roll and Traditional in the same sentence!"

Tempura was crispy without being greasy.\n\nKobe carpaccio: wow. So tender! Sauce was not overpowering and the candied mushrooms were sweet, crispy and awesome.  I hate mushrooms but I could eat these every day.\n\nAlbacore onion:  another winner! Great sauce and nice crispy onion stringy things to complement the fish.\n\nKobe potstickers: ok, added these to the rotation this last trip and they were not my fav.  Just okay.  With so many other choices these will probably not be ordered again.\n\nWe love this food because it also is not very heavy.  We get to try tons of stuff and don't leave feeling like it.

            "review": "Having heard a lot about Koi restaurant (located on the second floor of the infamous Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino) from such television shows as \"Celebrity Hot Spots\" on VH1, I was eager to wine and dine at this establishment on a resent jaunt to Las Vegas. Koi possesses a Japanese-inspired, Hollywood energy sort of vibe featuring a variety of savory cooked dishes, traditional sushi and sashimi, as well as creative rolls. The d\u00e9cor located within this establishment is absolutely amazing; a seductive harmony of Asian design elements makes this a great atmosphere for romance. This, however, is where my positive review ends.\n     Upon arrival I was greeted by a charming hostess who promptly escorted my boyfriend and me to our cozy little booth in the back of the restaurant. Glancing over the menu, which featured an average of twenty-something dollar items, we decided to share five or six dishes between us. My first negative remark: an establishment that features such remarkable ambiance and rather pricey menu items should not have paper wrapped wooden chopsticks, I laughed, thinking to myself that Koi had spent so much money on the d\u00e9cor they fell a few dollars short when it came to the utensils. Koi also allows patrons to enter this high end establishment in shorts in flip-flops, which I feel drastically diminishes the appearance of the place. It also became evident after waiting twenty minutes for any kind of service whatsoever, that this establishment was extremely under staffed. The drink menu was that of any standard high end Japanese restaurant so I decided to be a rebel and order an Asahi from their extensive beer menu; they possessed almost all of the Thai/Japanese beers I knew! Unfortunately, the waitress was so busy she ran by our table, dropped my boyfriend and my beer on the table with a chilled glass without a word and scurried off to assist another table. I'm not trying to be a snob, but shouldn't she have at least assisted in pouring my beer for me?! At my local watering hole sushi spot they always pour my beer for me, oh well. After another twenty something minute wait we finally gave our order, let me walk you through the items I chose to indulge!\n\n     Miso Soup, $5: I like the quality of the Miso Soup better at my local sushi spot in San Francisco. I felt like Koi's version was seriously lacking salt, and somewhat bland. \n     Edamame, $6: Awesome! Freshly steamed and hot with just the right amount of salt! I feel like Edamame can get soggy rather quickly but to my pleasant surprise, no soggy factor!\n     Tuna Tartare, $15: This was by far my favorite dish of the evening. In hindsight, I would have ordered five of this dish and called it a day! One order includes two silver dollar sized portions, rather small for how scrumptious this dish was. They serve the tuna with avocado on top of a deliciously crispy wonton, fabulous!\n     Yellow Tail Carpaccio, $20: Not impressed with this dish at all! I love yellow tail/Hamachi, but the quality of this fish was not fresh by any means. Again, I prefer the quality of fish at my local spot (maybe I should write a review for my local spot...) The yellow tail was thinly cut (like any carpaccio should be), dressed in Grapeseed oil, Ponzu, and Wasabi-Tobiko, which seemed rather oily and lacking any wasabi kick which I was craving.\n     Kope Beef Potstickers $23: These had an excellent flavor, although it seemed like they had been sitting under a heating lamp for a while due to the lacking wait staff. Served with a Ponzu dipping sause, I gobbled these down quickly. I'm convinced if these were served immediately after preparation had been completed I would have had absolutely no complaints whatsoever.\n     Baked Crab Roll, $12: Great roll, nice and creamy crab with a pleasant crunch on the exterior. Included wasabi and un-dyed ginger which was refreshing.\n     Veggi Tempura, $18: I loved the selection of vegetables they included in this dish; Asparagus, Green Beans, Yams, Onions, Shitakes, Eggplant and Carrots. Nice and crispy yet not over battered like tempura can be at times. I would have preferred a traditional dipping sauce however, the side sauce Koi paired with the dish was rather greasy, causing me after a few bites to simply shove it aside.\n\n     After completion of our meal, my boyfriend and I mutually decided to dine elsewhere for desert. I was not pleased with the service I received here, nor the quality of food in which was served. I would rather dine at Tao (located within the Venetian) or Nobu (Hard Rock) where I receive fabulous service that actually suits the high priced menu items. The atmosphere was by far the highlight of this venue; it is after all an extremely romantic setting, but that's where the glamour ends. Skip this venue and stick to your local watering hole sushi spot and/or the other two venues I suggested above; you will save a few bucks and receive the quality and service in which you are accustomed."

He got the chocolate espresso martini, which he swears was exceptional (I wouldn't know, due to a hatred of all things chocolate) and I got the red dragon sangria, which was exceptional.\n\nThe sushi was perfectly done, beautifully presented, and perfectly tasty. Despite the 120$ (pre-tip) price tag on the meal, we really felt we got our money's worth, and when we go back to Las Vegas next year, plan on heading back to Koi again."

The second time I brought a huge bachelorette party of 10+ girls. The last time I was and will ever go there was just with my boyfriend for a romantic dinner.\n\nEach time I've been, the service has been unfriendly, impersonal and slow. Having worked at an upscale restaurant before, I'm really surprised they operate this way on a regular basis. I feel their lack of service is pretty offensive to their high-paying customers. Doesn't matter if you're here on a weekend (the first two times I came here), in the middle of the week (the last time I was here), with a big group or just one other person. The service was consistently bad under every imaginable circumstance.\n\nThe sushi isn't great. During my last dining experience, the rice was actually undercooked in a rainbow roll I ordered-- for three times the price I'd normally pay, a crunchy rainbow roll was not what I was expecting. I also ordered albacore nigiri. It was so small and plain-- not even any garnish. Very sad looking. For the money, I was extremely disappointed. The only dish I did and have consistently enjoyed each time was their crunchy spicy tuna appetizer.\n\nThe desert-- the lava cake-- was underwhelming in flavor. The waiter didn't ask us how our food was or anything about our experience. Maybe they figure you're a tourist and won't be back? Not an attitude I'd think a place like this would adopt. The atmosphere is nice... but thus is the case with a lot of restaurants in Vegas, on the strip. As I recall from the first two times I was there, the drinks are nice-- but again, who has trouble finding a nice drink in Vegas? I wanted some great sushi and a nice dinner with good service in an upscale restaurant! I just couldn't find that here.\n\nI always tip well, but I won't return. After our meal, my boyfriend turned to me and said \"Let's not come back here again\"\n\nI definitely agreed. Enough is enough-- three strikes and you're out!"

I know it from hearing about the West Hollywood location (popular celeb hangout, good food, etc.). We went here on a Saturday night and it wasn't all that busy (dinner was at 8 p.m.) Everything started out fine until we were waiting for our food and one of our guests spotted something interesting behind our booth, which was up against one of the walls of the restaurant. WTF??? Why was there a MASSIVE RAT TRAP behind our booth? (Picture to come) Is this place hiding something we don't know? That is absolutely disgusting. To top it off, our MINIATURE SIZED entree's came. Wow, this place is more of a rip off. My friend had the chicken yakitori (pint size chicken skewers). Wow $16! I had the hamachi ($22). Don't get me wrong, the food was pretty good but the price of the food certainly does not match the service of the place. Our waitress was at times horrible. My friend asked for a bottle of wine, which she was quoted as saying was between $29 and $35. She never came back to confirm that price and then she had the audacity to charge $48 for that bottle. She also added one too many orders of a bottle of sake. This place is just all wrong. I wouldn't bother wasting your money there."

Might as well save yourself some cash because though the food is flavorful, the portions are small. The same goes for the hot sake carafe and Sapporo. Half off hot sake and Sapporo...I'm all for it!!!\n\nNow for the plates. There isn't any specific order I'll go in because everything pretty much came all at once. The sushi, the kobe beef potstickers, the tuna tacos, the calamari, and the skewers were all great. The big highlights though were the Mochiko fried chicken, the creamy tempura shrimp, the short rib dumplings and the roasted shishito peppers. These plates were eaten the fastest and were well worth ordering a couple of more rounds for (which we did of course). The shishito peppers were the best I've had by far and the short rib in the dumplings were awesome. I only wish there could have been more on the plate. \n\nBesides possibly still being hungry once you've finished depending on how much you've ordered, I have no complaints. The food was delicious, the atmosphere is nice and the Happy Hour is well worth giving a shot. \n\nDinner 12/13/2015"

I suppose it was our fault for deciding to eat sushi in vegas of all things.  The crispy rice with tuna was very good but way overpriced.  $16 for 4 small pieces - no thanks.  We tried the apple sake that the server practically convinced us to order and it was pretty terrible.  It was reminiscent of a smirnoff green apple drink which means it was too sweet and had a weird artificial after taste. \n\nThe sashimi was fresh but was only 4 small pieces for $26 dollars.  I can't review the restaurant on the sashimi because it's about the quality of the fish really which was high. \n\nNeedless to say a $100 check later and we were still starving after splitting basically 12 pieces of fish. The water was rude and pushy and when I paid in cash - he closed out or bill and threw away the receipt.  After asking him for the receipt since it was a business trip he gave me attitude about cash bill being closed out and that's just what they do throw the receipt away. I'm sorry but this was a transaction and I shouldn't have had to haggle over my receipt.  The server explained how he was way too busy but if we wanted to wait maybe he could find the time to dig in the trash and find our receipt. 15 min later he emerged with a wrinkled dirty receipt.  \n\nI could have spent the same amount of money, walked away full and satisfied and enjoyed better service somewhere else. \n\nDon't waste your money or your time.

I'm not sure how special these dishes actually are though, as Robin had every dish and all it's ingredients memorized, and boredly pushed through the list of dished forcefully without pausing for breath- or any questions. Upon being ask for my order, i told the waitress that i wanted the Seared Tuna with Jalapeno and Garlic Chips (listed under \"Koi Signature dishes\"), which she promptly and condescendingly told me was an appetizer. A bit taken aback, i asked her to go around the table for everyone else's order before coming back to me. After debating my options for a minute, my sister convinced me to just get it because appetizer portions are usually somewhat larger and we could share it(- plus, who gives a shit what the waitress thinks). I looked up and the waitress was nowhere to be seen...she returned ten minutes later, only after my sister flagged her down and pointed out that she forgot to take my order before prancing off. Finally having wrangled her, i asked what the portion size was for the Seared Tuna and made a point of saying that i was going to split it as my main course. She hummed and hawed, but was not very specific or attentive to what i was asking: She basically said \"yeah, fine\", wrote the order down and left. \n      Waiting around for the food, i enjoyed the atmosphere and music. The place is really nice and very classy. glancing around, I look toward the sushi bar and notice a waitress trying to unplug a bottle of Sriracha and squirt it onto a plate. Now, i love me some Sriracha but i would not say that it is an especially gourmet chili sauce, and found it somewhat disheartening to witness it being squirted all over a dish they charge $30 for. In retrospect i think this scene basically sums up my experience and Koi LV. \n      The food arrives, and Robin the waitress hands me my plate- It is sparingly covered by 5 or 6 tiny thin pieces of tuna, each with one chunk of raw jalapeno and a few flakes of what was apparently dried garlic. To recap: The dish i ordered was called Seared Tuna with Jalapeno and Garlic Chips. Having ordered seared tuna in several restaurants before, and being a regular sushi eater, i was expecting sashimi-sized chunks of fish with a good sear on each side. These pieces of fish were basically 1x2 inch slices of deli meat style tuna...it was so thin it was see through. As a result, the fish did not retain any kind of sear or the typically steak-y taste and texture of traditionally seared tuna. The fish itself was of mediocre quality and the only dominant flavor in the dish was the jalapeno, which would have been more successful had it been diced and evenly distributed on the fish rather than in a chunk right in the middle. Furthermore, the exceedingly small portion was not large enough for one person to eat as a meal, let alone for two people to share like we asked, and certainly not worth the $16+ we were charged for it...I. was. pissed. - and apparently it was written on my face because the waitress hurriedly asked if i needed something, to which i replied that i felt extremely misled by the information she gave us about the dish.   She tried to argue that all sashimi came in ultra-thin deli slices like that(!), but i was not having it. She then tried to push me to order something else until i told her that i did not intend to spend any more money for shitty service and tiny amounts of mediocre food. \n      At this point i think i should mention that with parties of 8 or more they charge a 19% gratuity fee. I feel this is extremely relevant to my experience, and the experience of the other people in my party because it was very much one of those cases where, knowing that the gratuity fee is there, the person waiting on you does a totally lame job because they don't have to work for their tip. Very uncool. We all agreed that our server was pushy, condescending, and basically did a half assed job the entire time...and she still left with a $90 tip- wtf\n      I should also point out that my dish was not the only one that was determined by my party to be of inadequate portion size and quality-especially in relation to the price we were paying for it. \n      Also, several people said they thought it was weird that they used crappy wasabi paste rather than the real/good stuff. \n      Of the things i tried and liked, I'd recommend the Creamy rock shrimp tempura, Tiger roll, Chicken Yakitori, and Tempura Shrimp Roll- All of which were of good or exceptional quality and portion size. \n\nFinal thoughts: Head to Koi if you love lame sushi and hate your money."

I could have scarfed them down in a short minute if I hadn't been trying to sample some of the other rolls we had ordered.

The fried rice with spicy tuna is always a crowd favorite, and they have the best baked crab roll (definitely order multiple of these as an appetizer!). I recommend ordering an assortment of dishes for the table so you're able to try much of the menu, because everything is worth trying. The only thing I didn't find extremely fresh was the UNI, but that could be a personal preference because it's not really my favorite fish anyway... (Little salty)\n\nThe lobster roll is one of my favorites; but it is rich because of the cream so you may want to share it or don't order much else if you do end up getting this roll. The cod was also one of the best tasting things we ordered... the texture was like butter and it just melts in your mouth.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the service was very friendly. The waitress let me charge my phone behind the bar (which some complain about doing). The wine selection isn't that great... but they have a decent selection of cocktails and sake.

As we sat down the bartender broke a wine glass by the ice and didn't change the ice bin. I'm not a bartender, but I'm pretty sure rule #1 protect your ice. \nSo we decided no mixed cocktails (bummer I wanted a vodka soda).

I was hoping they could re-save the first impression. \nThey did, but unfortunately the Sushi chef's were not good enough to carry the rest of the terrible service. \nOur waiter forgot our drinks in the bar, never asked us if we wanted another round, walked past us twice when we tried to flag him down for the check. Then when we felt so compelled to complain to the GM he was totally oblivious to his customers needs and walked passed us. \nLittle to say this was a total crash and burn - even if it was the best sushi we have ever had the experience was horrendous. \n\nSorry guys - need better trained staff. Customer service should be over the top here considering the mixed sashimi plate was $100.00.

The Rainbow Roll was a fail due to the salmon having a fishy taste and smell which is never a good thing.  My wife was immediately turned off by the taste.  The Tuna Tartare was a little too spicy for my tastes which indicates they overdid it slightly.  \n\nIt wasn't bad, it wasn't great.  I enjoyed a good Oregon Pinot Gris and my wife tried two of their sparkling sake drinks.

I was with a group of 7 and we all enjoyed it.

Terrible to the point of I probably won't go back to Koi. We ordered our first dishes and it took quite a while to come. When they did come out, one order was completely forgotten and another dish was wrong. We had asked for yellowtail on crispy rice. The dish was clearly spicy tuna and the waiter told us that no, it was yellowtail. One of my friends had already put some on the plate and the waitress attempted to take the food off his plate and bring it back to the kitchen. The food's getting thrown out, he was going to eat it, let him eat it. Besides, isn't it against the health code to bring food back to the kitchen? Anyway, they brought out a replacement dish and said it was yellowtail, it may have been, but it sure as hell wasn't yellowtail on crispy rice. Screwed up the same order twice.\nThe service the rest of the night was just as terrible. Food was mediocre at best, oftentimes with far, far too much salt added. I didn't eat any of the entrees because they came a full 45 minutes after we finished with the appetizer. \n\nI guess it's Vegas, you're taking a gamble when you go here.

I've been to the lounge for a few events that had passed apps but decided to get the pre-fixe meal for our dinner date here.\n\nAPPETIZERS: Edamame, miso soup, and shishito peppers. Standard dishes, nothing unusual. The shishito peppers were better than expected, but could have used more of the sweet soy sauce.\nSIGNATURE PLATES: The Hamachi Fusion was the same as the hamachi carpaccio with jalapeno dish that is popular elsewhere. The signature Koi Crispy Rice is a favorite of mine, but BF found the rice to be dense and gummy. I was disappointed that there were only two pieces in the order. The Creamy Shrimp Tempura was a surprise, lightly fried and lightly sauced instead of covered in mayo as I had feared. Light flavor, large portion.\nSIGNATURE ROLLS: Baked Crab Roll could also be called the basic crab roll but at least it was fresh. The Geleno roll (spicy tuna, spicy albacore, jalapeno, crispy onion, spinach chips) sounded like it would be nicely spicy but it was pretty tame, and lacked the texture I had anticipated from the onion and spinach. The Sunfire Roll (lobster, snow crab, cucumber, cilantro, mango, avocado) was light and refreshing but could have used a sauce to pump it up a bit more. \nWe also added on the salmon carpaccio dish with black truffles and citrus- it was probably the best dish of the night despite the heavy-handed use of truffle oil. The sashimi was nicely fatty but very thinly cut, the microgreens added texture, but the dish overall needed more citrus and less oil. \nDESSERT: The Koi Cheesecake was very cheesy, as in not sweet as a dessert is typically expected. The white chocolate walls, whipped cream, and fruit used in the plating were necessary to make the cake itself palatable. \n\nOverall, we were let down by the food. The atmosphere is nice and staff were attentive and polite, but the dishes just didn't impress. While their fish quality may be high, I didn't notice enough of an upgrade to compensate for the lack of flavor- I've had more interesting rolls at off-Strip AYCE spots.The signature dishes were okay, we just expected better."

This place is nice and fancy and pricey and that's about it.\n\nThe food is expensive with small portions. The sushi rolls were okay, had to order a lot just to feel semi full. The only thing that was good was the lobster roll and the sparkling sake that our waiter suggested we try.\n\nSushi in Vegas in general is a big rip off in my opinon, at least on The Strip."

Like the most horrendous service I have ever received. This is unacceptable for a restaurant that charges a lot of money for the little tiny portions of food they serve. Regardless, price wasn't the issue with me. If their food had been expensive but scrumptious and service one of quality, believe me, I would have give them at least 3 stars. \nBut no. They kept bringing us the wrong plates of food, and literally at least an hour after we first ordered it.. our waitress was gone more than 90 percent of the time we were there and at the end, wanted to keep a 50 dollar tip!\nI ordered the lobster roll. I thought it would be hard to mess up Lobster but my roll was greasy.. it was basically just a california roll with some white salty sauce on top.. Although I will say their raspberry mojito was quite good. But would have been better if they didn't take 30 minutes to get them to us.\nAlso, walking in I slipped on a wet floor with no warning sign posted or anyone cleaning it up. My lawyer-in-training brain totally acknowledge the fact that I could've sued.. but I let it go. And still have a huge purple bruise on my knee to show for it.\nI really wish I had better things to say about this place... but I am definitely never wasting my time or money with Koi again."

My favorite decorative touch from the restaurant was the HUGE boulder they had in the main dinning area, and the cute buddhas they had as you entered the restaurant! \n\nIf you want GREAT Japanese/Seafood when your in Vegas, go to Koi! \n\nAND get a bottle of their HOT SAKI!"

There was only three other parties there and a few on the bar side, in the whole restaurant.  I really liked Koi.  The food was good.  I like how it's decorated.  I had the kobe bites... It was good but missing something!  Literally...tiny steak bites and nothing on the side.  The waiter asked if we wanted mashed potatoes.  Weird...cuz I thought Koi was Japanese.  That's a first!  My friends had the salmon and sea bass (?) and the other had scallops.  Scallops were delish also!  I read it was supposed to be happy hour...umm..no!  So was not.  The servers were nice.  A couple of them were trying to help us get into other clubs around town.  \n\nWhen we first walked into Planet Hollywood casino, a guy in a suit gave us wristbands for \"Ultra Lounge\" which was the lounge/club of Koi.  Supposed to have been free cuz we had dinner but we left to go back to our room; it was still early and UL was empty!  One of the servers told us that it does get really crowded cuz the venue is small.   We came back to UL around 130am and it was really crowded!!!  We had to wait in line.  Then we had to pay $20 to get in.  I thought we were free...but of course they said if we had our receipt, we would be able to.  Anyway, paid $20 and got the notorious PINK cup for Ladies Night.  Ladies drink free; only house liquor though.  House Liquor = Not worth it!  The one plus of UL...the music!!  I don't know who was DJing but music was good ALL night, even at dinner.  Hip hop and R&B.  Only had one cup of house liquor and was done for the night.  The vodka burned!  I wanted to dump the liquor to get to the ice.  Overall, my stars are for the food and the music!  I'd go back."

After the complimentary bottle of champagne gifted to us by Planet Hollywood and a gaze at the amazing view of The Strip from our hotel room we decided it was time to get dressed up and go out. We only had to venture down the lift.\n\nI had heard of Koi only as a restaurant frequented by celebrities, and consequently had certain expectations. Koi definitely met them. From the minute we stepped inside we were given some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. The wait staff were welcoming, attentive, knowledgeable and efficient. It definitely felt classy and you were made to feel special.\n\nKoi is a great place for an intimate gathering. The seating is comfortable and spaced out enough for a private conversation. You also don't have to worry about interruptions from nearby patrons because you can't hear them. The ambiance is great, and the lighting just dim enough.\n\nWe tried almost everything we could on the menu. The cocktails, hand rolls, edamame and creme brulee were my favourites. We did rack up a large bill for a sushi restaurant, at least $160. However it was the perfect place for the first night in Vegas and I remember the experience fondly.\n\nUnfortunately there were no celebrity sightings because they make good use of curtained areas and the back door exit. That's okay though, I'm happy for Nicole Richie and others to graze in peace."

Most uncomfortable meal I've ever had in a restaurant.

Koi Vegas delivered, they do a good job of replicating the menu, same great taste and unique cuisine. The ambiance is also unique with Asian decor and influence. \n\nAs you would expect in Vegas, a quality experience is going to cost you...so don't be surprised! If you drink (alcohol) and eat a hearty meal (multiple menu items), you will spend $60-80/person...but you will find the experience worth it. For specific food recommendations, read my review of the Los Angeles Koi location."

They were able to accommodate and get us out in time. I do recommend a reservation because it was busy when we got there. Many were waiting.\n\nI ordered the seasonal salad and filet. The filet was very tender and had an amazing sauce on it. Mashed potatoes came with it that we nice. My husband hit an assortment of sushi. I don't eat sushi so I didn't taste it but he said it was very fresh and delicious. \n\nFor desert I had the chocolate one. Sorry  I forget the name but it was totally worth the calories!  My husband had the bread pudding. It was just ok. I wouldn't get it again. Not enough flavor for us.  \n\nThe reason I gave it one less star than perfect?  I ordered a Cabernet and it wasn't very good. Perhaps they need to get more options of wine by the glass because the one I had was awful. My husband got their lychee martini and we both really liked it. Next time I will order that instead!"

They gave us free miso soup which tasted very ordinary actually. I have tasted the same quality soup from local NYC sushi take out spots. Everyone else had mixed reviews of their dishes, and nothing blew us away.

The miso cod entree I ordered was, well, a piece of cod with a few carrots and asparagus--decently executed, but uninspired. And at $50+ per person, no thanks."

The only saving grace was that the drinks were strong and the staff were all to eager to give away cocktails for free as compensation for their ineptitude and/ or indifference. For such an empty restaurant, one might expect reasonable service and fresh food. However, our oysters smelled rancid and steaks were unrested with blood mixing into the sauce all over our plates. Eeeeewwwwww! \n  Our server was inattentive and our attempts to have our issues addressed by the arrogant asian manager walking around casually were abandoned when someone from our party finally caught a glimpse of him, sitting by himself at a table in the dining room and staring at his iphone for no less than 15 minutes. Pathetic! While we stared at inedible food he never made it over to ours or anyone else's table to check on their experience... At least we all got a good laugh, after our free drinks, at how little anyone really seemed to care that we were there to exchange our hard earned money for a meal... what a unique concept-\n  Ultimately we wrote the experience off as a total loss and won't be back to Koi any time soon. Hopefully they get their S#@! together and remember they are in the service industry. Times are tough and you aren't exactly exceeding anyones expectations.

After we sat down our waitress was very rude and impatient that we didn't know what we wanted to drink. We were told by the PH rep that if we got a drink we would get a ticket to the movie.   After we got our drinks our waitress took our money returned with the change, and no mention of the movie tickets. It wasn't until after we tipped her that her attitude changed and she offered the movie tickets. We then left and I left my cell phone there. I called Koi and they informed me that someone had turned it in, but that they didn't hold lost and found and that hotel security would have it. I went to Hotel security who didn't have it, i return to Koi and the manager of Koi tells me that it was up to the guest who tried to turn in my phone responsibility to turn it into security and not the restaurants.  After many years of going to Koi in Los Angeles, I will never return to any of their locations based on this experience."

It's amazing how often you will come across unqualified, incompetent, or rude event managers (read my review of The Chandelier). However, this story has a happy ending:)\n\nMelody Pender and her staff are amazing! Even though I only gave her less than a week, she was quick to respond, offered thoughtful suggestions and insights, and made this entire event easy and seamless to plan. She tackled everything from room set up, optimizing our open bar, designating staff to our event, handling the guest list, and food orders like a champ. \n\nDay of the event she was able to accomodate last minute changes for the room set up even though we dropped in unannounced just a few hours before hand. During our party, she was almost always readily available and the few rare times she was not, each one of her team members knew exactly what was going on and how to handle the situation so I never had to explain or repeat myself.\n\nI'll have to admit I did have lower expectation for food quality based on the reviews here, but they were surprisingly good. We ordered edamame, creamy rock shrimp (my fave!), the crab roll (best I've had before), kobe beef potstickers, and vegetable tempura.\n\n5 stars for beyond excellent service and I hope to work with them again."

The experience really does begin from the time you're greeted to the moment you leave Koi. Koi is appealing to all of the senses. You can't help but gaze out into the fabulous view or scan the subtle details of the room itself. The service provided to us was exceptional; we truly felt taken care of. Nathan, our server, and his support staff were intuitive, talkative, humorous, kind, attentive, and, I feel, went above and beyond.  For example, my friend, Carol, asked where she could find the ladies room and one of the Koi staff walked her all the way to the entrance of the ladies room. The food was unforgettable, succulent, and adventurous. I suggest the Hamachi Fusion, the Miso Bronzed Black Cod, the Grilled Skirt Steak, the Spicy Rock Shrimp Tempura Hand Roll (this one really made an impression on us), the Coconut Rice Pudding Brulee for dessert, and the Asian Pear for cocktails. I look forward to the next time I am able to dine at Koi; it is a gem within a city of many gems."

However there was an appetizer that was not on the menu that we ordered (a kobe beef topping on a fried wonton with chives and spicy mayo) and it was a tasty treat being the chef made without us knowing exactly what was in it and from a picture. \n\nI'd come here again with a group because it was fun, but I think I'd look off strip for a cheaper experience.

I don't remember exactly what we ordered, but it was just a couple rolls.  I believe one of them was like a BSCR and spicy tuna.  There may have been a couple sashimi plates.\n\nAnyhow, the food was ok.  As some yelpers have mentioned, you can get better in Vegas off the strip and a better price.  Being that it's in a hotel, on the strip, you sort of do let that slide a little.  \n\nWe went here just out of convenience since we were there to watch Peepshow."

            "review": "This place was surprisingly dead on thursday night after Peepshow.  The saketini was pretty strong and went well with the spicy tuna with crispy rice, which was comparable to Katsuya, Katana, etc.  I also got the agedashi tofu which was really good--crispy fried on the outside with soft tofu in the middle.  Not so good was the eggplant side dish and my dads Kobe Sirloin.  He said it was the worst steak hes ever had.  I had higher hopes for this place and I wouldn't go back."

            "review": "Sin-u-Rita and Who's Your Daddy are just two of the uniquely named cocktails served at Koi in Las Vegas. Both were quite tasty. The Sin-u-Rita was a patron cocktail mixed with grand marnier, ginger, and pomegranate puree and fresh lime juice. I sucked down three of those and was feeling a bit tipsy. My friend tried the Who's Your Daddy served with an energy shot. \n\nMoving from cocktails to food we ordered the crispy rice topped with spicy tuna appetizer. A little small, but super flavorful. The crunchy rice really added a unique texture to the dish. We also ordered the tuna sashimi with jalapeno and garlic chips. Excellent, but small portion. We then tried the spicy yellowtail albacore with crispy red onions. This was amazing. Lots of texture and flavor and the crispy onions were a perfect accompaniment. We then tried the the kobe beef potstickers which were good, but if it didn't say Kobe beef, I wouldn't know otherwise so we basically paid for the name. Lastly we tried the creamy rock shrimp tempura and the baked lobster roll with creamy sauce. Both were perfectly prepared. I wanted more of the lobster because the portion was so small. \n\nA note on the service -- I was supremely happy with our service for the first hour and then suddenly our waitress (Melody) disappeared for about 30 minutes and forgot about our drink order. I'm not sure what happened to her. When she came back to check on us, we had finished all of our food, all of our cocktails, all of our water and expected a cocktail (which we had ordered). She had 100% forgotten. So we took the check and left. There's nothing that makes me more pissy than crappy service. I might consider going back to Koi again next time I am in Las Vegas because their food is very inventive and interesting, but I would probably sit at the bar next time to avoid the disappearing waitress routine."

            "review": "I came here for my birthday dinner, and I was sorely disappointed. My fianc\u00e9 and I ordered the seared albacore, the dragon roll, seafood tempura, and a raspberry maple for me. We paid 70 dollars (because of the added 18% gratuity for our large party) and I really feel like we wasted our money. \n\nThe dragon roll only had 6 pieces, and the seared albacore I would say only had about 5-6 slices. We left hungry because somehow our waiter forgot our seafood tempura order. All of my friends ordered 1-2 rolls, ranging from 9-20 dollars apiece. My mom split some creamy shrimp and a roll with my sister, and ordered a coke and she somehow ended up paying 60 bucks. A part of me feels like it's wrong to pay over 50 dollars for two people and leave hungry. \n\nI think what you pay for here is the atmosphere. There is no doubt that the restaurant is beautiful. The quality of the sushi was mediocre at best; the food was neither memorable nor mind blowing. What made me the most angry about this meal was that my mom had driven 4 hours to see me for dinner and drove back home after spending 60 dollars on one roll and one appetizer and left hungry. On the plus side, I did get a free mochi dessert for my birthday.\n\nThis place might be where you want to be for a casual drink, and I know they offer open bar late night (20 for ladies, 30 for men), but I will never recommend this restaurant for food service. I wish I could get my money back."

            "review": "This is unusual for me to write a negative review.  I keep a positive outlook and want to say only good things about local businesses.  But this place did me wrong tonight and I'm not letting them get away with it without saying something.\n\nI pulled up a chair at the sushi bar.  I ordered my favorite sake, Junmai Daijingo.  I asked the man behind the sushi counter to hook me up with his specialty dish.  I told him no exotics; I like rolls, tuna and salmon.  I've done this before at other sushi bars.  They usually give me one dish at a time.  If I want more, I order more.  I'm one person, and a petite woman.\n\nHe slides over 2 full rolls and 3 different tuna sashimi pieces on this huge plate.  I thought nothing of it.  I only was able to eat half of it.  It was good, not blow-me-away fabulous, by any means.  \n\nWhen I asked for the check, I was stunned.  Not fair to assume I'm a dumb tourist who is willing to spend whatever.  I was the only person sitting at the sushi bar and I feel he took advantage of me.\n\nI've played out this same scenario at Nobu at the Hard Rock and had a completely opposite experience.  That sushi chef gave me incredible dishes one at a time as I asked for them.  The bill at Nobu was half what it was at Koi.\n\nI say skip it and go to Nobu instead.   A word for the sushi chefs at Koi: the next time you assume a customer is a tourist who doesn't know better, you'd better think twice before deciding to take advantage of that customer.  \n\nCome on, managers, train your employees to deliver better service."

            "review": "For our last night in Vegas we wanted to do something a tad fancier than burgers, and found out that Koi offers a half price happy hour menu. \n\nMost of the things we ordered were very delicious. \n\n- tuna tartare on rice crisps - yum. My boyfriend's favorite thing.\n- fried rice balls with spicy tuna on top - I love these and used to order them in NYC. Maybe my favorite thing.\n- rock shrimp tempura - good, but nothing special. \n- edamame dumplings - I think these are probably a straight copy attempt off of buddakan in NYC, and that's fine by me. Broth and flavors were great, but the dumpling wrappers were much thicker than buddakan's dainty little things. \n- baked crab rolls - yummy also!\n- banana bread pudding - we actually ordered this specifically because of a yelp review we read. We were not disappointed, it was delicious.\n\nCriticisms:\nFood was great for happy hour prices. My biggest criticism is more of the layout of the lounge/happy hour area. The actual restaurant is way cooler looking and the lounge layout is kind of awkward. Our waitress also had to stoop really far to get down to our table which seemed uncomfortable especially since she was wearing six inch heels."

The girls in our group had free drinks all night, and the music was really good.  My group of friends are from the bay, and this place slapped bay music hard the night we went.  If you are looking for a chill place to go, where the people are a little older (late 20s to early 30s) then go to Koi."

There was nothing too memorable about Koi, besides the surprise I had when they said they only serve Asahi and Sapporo as the Japanese Beers.   I would think that a place like this would have a few of the rare Japanese beers, but alas, they did not.\n\nWould I return?  Only if I was staying at Planet Hollywood, and traveling for business.  The prices were a bit high for the size and quality that was served."

Eventually it was delicious but not a '10'.\n\nThe service was great. Our waiter was young, funny and accommodating. We kept ordering drinks after food after drinks etc. We also had plenty of questions for our \"pain in the ass\" friends.\n\nThe other food we ordered - hamachi, beef carpaccio, crispy rice w/ tuna, rock shrimp etc. It was good no doubt but in the end after spending $110 each we were not full and the food was not spectacular."

I actually might have a better VIP area. LOL -\nWay too many people for the amount of room. There were girls there with flipflops and t-shirts. Guys with running shoes and polo's. From the facade in front you can be led to believe this is an upscale place. It's more like a local bar with a decent DJ in a pretty box. \n\nTook the girls 15 mins to get drinks, then I had to go over to the other side of their small bar to clash with the restroom go-ers to get my 8-dollar beer. \n\nGo somewhere else. Maybe BANK or TRYST"
