            "review": "Went there with my toddler on Sunday to have a lunch and sweets.  Ordered one lunch set with a la carte desert.  Chose Mt. Fuji for this.  Also ordered prix fixe with Stella.  \n\nThe soup that came with the lunch set was so good.  Green salad with potato salad was also my favorite.  Japanese potato salad tastes different from home to home but the one served at Raku Sweets was made exactly the way I love!  I'm not a huge fun of onion slices in it, but they were well treated and prepared.  Not overwhelming taste of onions.  Just gave the right taste to it.  \n\nThe sandwich I chose was with bacon and cheese.  I didn't think my baby would eat salmon.  The croissant was crispy and buttery.  Pieces of basil and sun-dried tomatoes added good accent and some acidity.  That being said, the combination of bacon, cheese, and croissant was a bit too greasy for my taste.  \n\nMt. Fuji was good but not the best Mont Blanc cake I've ever had. I prefer stronger taste of chestnut in the cream.  I loved the strawberry cream on the side of Stella the most.  Refreshing yet sweet.  I wasn't too much fun of the base of Stella.  Had nice caramel taste but was too heavy for the light cream for me.\n\nMango sorbet was very good with strong mango taste.  The puff was crispy but by that time I wasn't too interested in sweets.  \n\nMy toddler enjoyed the whole experience, especially eating the menu.  Her expression was certainly worth a million. \n\nI recommend the lunch set on Sunday.  They may also have it on Saturday.  The set with a la carte desert is only $20.  Well worth it!"

            "review": "I do enjoy coming here. The space is minimal and refreshing. Perhaps the elaborate presentation of the desserts warrants the steep price but the taste falls a bit short. They are never not good, but also never mind blowing, at least not at $12 per item.  Our party of three ordered the fixed price $15 pairing with another item off the ala carte menu, being not hungry and only wanting a little bit of sweets, but apparently there is a minimum limit per person, and we had to order more stuff. It's not a bad place to come at least once to try, but keep in mind that parking in that tiny strip mall (which is shared by a few pretty popular establishments) has gotten nearly impossible lately. Get prepared to circle the lot multiple times only to park on a \"no parking allowed\" side street."

I came here because I've heard so much about it and had to check it out.  first, the place is not very big. it had two tables and majority of seats are at the bar which is nice because they make all the desserts right in front of you. I had the fixed menu which is three courses (one of which you pick). I chose the hazelnut dish which looks like soba noodles. I have to admit that it looks pretty awesome. I thought it was ice cream but it's not which was a bit disappointing. it's really cool to see how they make it and I think that's part of what makes this place special... It feels quite intimate but it's really not.  the dishes aren't spectacular or memorable. would I recommend it? I would if they were really into desserts. would I go back in my own? probably not.  the staff is friendly and the place is super clean. the bathroom is an experience in itself, but if you've been to raku you'd know what I'm talking about."

            "review": "This is my dining highlight of the past five years, and I am a food snob. Serendipity brought me here and I'll be talking about it for the rest of my life. Superb staff, their desserts are heavenly, the ambiance was perfect, the bathroom had me giddy with laughter, and you have to just applaud how they have taken a suburban parking-lot mall storefront and made you completely forget where you are by the artistic and lovely way they separate you from the outside world by a transparent wall of nice wines (including some Opus One). My dessert was not on the menu - they made is especially for me upon request because I had just come from dinner at Raku and was told that the dessert I ordered following dinner had been discontinued for some time but that if I came to Sweets Raku and asked them to make it they would know what I was asking for and might be able to accommodate. They did, and what a delight! To make this even better, since I am a coffee snob, I can report that the Americano they served me was excellent. The staff were all cute, perfectly dressed, and intimately knowledgeable about every ingredient that is part of their intricate dessert compositions. I reached a level of happiness while dining there - let's call it elation - that I carried with me well into the next morning. In my experience, that's rare and good cause for a five-star rating!"

If the line is to the door (and I'm talking like 8 or 10 people) it will take you an hour to be seated and another 30 minutes to get your food.\n\nDoes the food itself save the Raku experience?  No, it was mediocre at best.  Not worth the price tag at all.  The coffee jelly \"tastes like tiramisu\" was just bland and tasted only slightly like tiramisu.  I would have infinitely preferred real tiramisu.  I ordered the souffle, which did have some tasty cream but that's it, the rest of it was mediocre.\n\nIn short Raku is an expensive dessert place with a long wait and mediocre desserts.  It is very cute and pretty though.  A good date place if there is like 2 or 4 people ahead of you.  Even on a first date waiting an hour standing in a tiny line would be a mood killer.  15 or 30 minutes though is OK."

            "review": "It's been almost 2 years since I've been back here. I appreciated the art, but wasn't too impressed with the flavors of the cake last time, so came back here for dessert. They stopped providing the edible menus (which was part of the cool experience before) and now only offer it on special occasions. I imagine valentines or christmas or something like that. \n\nI tried two different cakes this time, and though it was good, it was not extraordinary for me. The price is a bit steep for what you get. \n\nHowever, I wouldn't knock out their food items next time around. A couple sitting close by was eating some food along with their AYCD wine, which was quite affordable. I can't recall how much, but it was really not bad at all if you're going to be drinking a ton of it on your own."

This was my second time dining here and will definitely be returning! \n\nIm sure you guys already know, the menus are edible. Their price point is a little bit on the indulgent side (2 for $15 though!). But you really can't argue with the presentation and quality. I can't help but salivate when I'm watching the souffl\u00e9s rise in the oven. All their sugars are tasteful(no pun intended) and well put together. Lots of prep I would imagine. They also offer wine and beer. Their service is on not neglectful in the least. No reservations available--walk-in only. Worth the drive from the strip I might add if you're visiting. The place is very minimalist asian pop culture--kinda made me wanna bust out some pig tails and colored contacts. Haha! But seriously though, $32 and some change for 4 desserts with tax, I'm good."

From the outside, it looks like a wine bar because of the rows of wine displayed. Once inside, it feels clean, modern and the deco was very interesting both at the entrance and the walls of the dining room and bathroom. Not a big menu and I believe they changed the item from time to time. You can either choose the dessert set which includes a main dessert and sorbet of the day and add a wine pairing or you can order a la carte. We ordered the solia, Mt. Fuji, Carib. All 3 was beautiful and tasted wonderful. This is a place where people show how passionate they are about the food. They made it an art ! They opened till midnight for most days EXCEPT Sunday."

Not sure when this change occurred, but I'm sad to have missed it.\n\nChef's Special Appetizer ($9): Strawberry Raspberry Tart, Macaron w/ Raspberry Sorbet, and Dark Chocolate Ganache. The tart was fantastic. Prefect crust and custard under the fresh fruits. The macaron had a wonderful chewiness, but the sorbet was awkward and it was a race to eat it before it vacated the cookie. Also, the sorbet was extremely tart, borderline unpleasant. The ganache was wonderful - I loved the texture and the semi-sweet flavor.\n\nMount Exotic ($12): Mango-flavored Mont Blanc w/ Mango Sauce. Beautiful dessert (obviously). Delicate cake topped with whipped cream, mango cream, lime zest, and fresh mango. Raspberry sauce and thin pieces of chocolate complement the dish. Every element was great and I loved the lightness.\n\nSoleil ($12): Orange-flavored ice cream, mascarpone, and Piquant Cassis mousse. Besides being really delicious, this dessert made to look like an orange with an edible \"stick\" and leaf. This was my favorite dessert of the bunch.\n\nPrix Fixe ($15)\n1. Coconut Sorbet w/ Gel\u00e9e. Fluffy sorbet, gel\u00e9e tasted like sweet wine. Fun treat in an espresso cup.\n2. Carib: Coconut Panna Cotta, tropical fruit medley, hot mango sauce poured over tropical mousse and cantaloupe sherbet. The wine glass is carefully filled with all the components and covered with a disc. Upon arrival at your table, hot mango sauce is poured on the disc causing it to melt and break into the scape below. Very fun!"

Definitely insta-worthy as they would say hahah \n\nThe place itself has a beautiful interior, but very small, they have tables which seat around 15 people and the bar area (where you can see for yourself the desserts being made, which is awesome!) maybe 10. It's a very popular place and I have read that they run out of desserts after a certain time. Fearing this, my girlfriend and I immediately went straight to Sweets Raku after we landed and dropped off our things. It was a 2pm on a Saturday and surprisingly there was no wait! We were seated right away at the bar. Thank goodness because after we left an enormous group of 15 or so came in. \n\nMars: amazing to look at it being flambeed, but not my cup of tea, only because I don't like alcohol. I didn't think the alcohol taste would be so apparent, but you can definitely taste it, especially at the bottom. Good thing my girlfriend likes alcohol so it wasn't a waste hahah I was able to take a spoonful to try and besides the alcohol taste, the inside contents were pretty okay, nothing memorable or grand. SO DEFINITELY DON'T GET THIS FOR YOUR KID\n\nPrimavera: probably their most popular dessert and even cooler to see the raspberry sauce crack through the thin layer of white chocolate. A must get if you come here. I definitely liked this one a lot more, great balance of flavors between sweet and fruity. Although it tasted great, similar to the mars, it wasn't amazing or mesmerizing. \n\nPRICE: Price-to-portion wise it's expensive ($12 a la cart or $15 for one specialty dessert + sorbet), but here you're essentially paying for the experience, which is just as great! Which is why I believe it's a place you should try at least once! \n\nSERVICE: amazing! The workers were very kind and attentive, checking back often to see how everything was. \n\nPARKING: plaza lot"

It was a chocolate sponge cake with raspberry mouse. \n\nThis time around I wanted to take my boyfriend for an anniversary treat. I had called ahead and asked if they had anything specific for a a special occasion and the lady on the phone said there was nothing specific but they would gladly from a nice message on one of the plates. Fine with me because the whole experience was already a treat. I didn't tell my boyfriend where we were going. So I made sure we had a small meal we shared together. \n\nOn an early Sunday afternoon, the place is not busy at all, and only 1 other couple seated. PERFECT! An opportunity to let my boyfriend see all the dishes as he orders and not observing someone elses. I HIGHLY suggest to come in on an odd hour for better seating. As we walked up, he was so confused since there is no sign advertising the name of the location. We walk in and he's surprised at how this little spot could make such an impression! We sit down and our server greets us. We can barely understand her but she tries and we appreciate her kindness. Our edible menu's are served and I tell my boyfriend to take a look and then a bite of the menu. He's loving it!\n\nWe decide to let him order the Prix Fixe 3 course serving, and I would do one dessert. We are definitely are wine people and we added the wine pairing for his prix fixe and I would have the \"Wine Flight\" Here's what we ordered:\n\nHis Prix fixe ($17)\nCourse 1: Mango mandarin sorbet with raspberry jelly. \nCourse 2: \"Stella\" Strawberry Tiramisu \nCourse 3: Creme Puff with chocolate ice cream and raspberry currant. \nPaired Wine ($7 extra): A small glass of Semi Sweet Rose 'N Blum Red Wine\n\nAla Carte ($12): \"Red Rock\" Raspberry lava cake with pistachio ice cream and spun sugar. \nWine Flight ($7): 3 iced tubes of wine samples: white wine, red wine, dessert wine. Served with a small dish of 2 cheese samples and a sun-dried tomato\n\nTasting the Wine Flight where we discovered a new wine we love!-\"Tokaj Classic Asz\u00fa 6 Puttonyos (2000)\" I know this is a dessert wine, but it was perfection...\n\nThe entire experience was worth it. This is a great location for a handful of people or a one-on-one date. What add's to my interest about Sweets Raku is that they constantly change their menu. They keep their menu so limited that they can do this. And it has me wanting MORE. I wouldn't come here often, but definitely like to come here for a nice treat."

The gourmet deserts were just OK, and after having that, I realize I prefer old-fashioned deserts such as cobbler, cake, strawberry shortcake, etc. The place is tiny, and as a result, you're sitting so close to other people. I didn't care for that. I also didn't care for the fact that they don't wear gloves or the person who made my desert didn't. I saw the other one person wearing gloves. Why the inconsistency in being sanitary? Yes, the deserts looked beautiful, but it wasn't worth it and the tight quarters and long lines although we got in at the right time. Also, average desserts were very pricey. To make things worse, they have this rude policy of not holding the seat for more than 5 minutes. My friend was out there trying to find a space in the super crowded tiny parking lot. The waitress kept pressuring me about the seat and that I was going to lose it soon. How rude, and this is the main reason I'm giving them 1 star."

But the minimum charge per person is 12.00  There's a lot to choose from, and i wished i did the pairings, but i was still too full off Raku.\n\nI finally decided on the Mont Blanc cake, which they called the Mt. Fuji.   My friend got the Sunset which looked very pretty.   My Mt. Fuji that came out, was absolutely beautiful.  It's so hard to find this cake in the bay area.  Very few people make it and when they do they don't make it good.  There were chunks of chestnut in my cake.. If you are a chestnut lover,  you will fall in love with this cake!.   \n\nI love this place the service is great.  Just be advise that they don't do to go orders. so eat up!"

It is not cheap and it's not for someone who doesnt want to try new things. It's surprisingly high-end on the interior with careful preparation of the food, excellent service, clean/sleek interior and great flavors. If you are in Chinatown and want a memorable dessert experience, try Sweets Raku! \n\nYou have to look hard for it though. It's \"hidden\" with no actual signage. I assume they do that on purpose."

But I accidentally came to this restaurant looking for their Raku dining restaurant and ended up in the sweets/ dessert restaurant. All I can say is Wow! Great concept! Beautiful elegant chef inspired kitchen dining makes you feel like you are being served by your own private chef and eating at their kitchen bar. The menu is a bit pricey but has homemade treats from all over the world anywhere from macaroons to green tea ice cream! Great place for a first date after dinner treat.\n\n It's pretty small and cozy inside so I would not suggest it for a large group setting but perfect for a quick bite to make an evening even more special. I could see myself coming here for a pick me up after a bad day at work!"

The menu comes paired with a delicious raspberry sauce! Amazing. \nMy boyfriend and I went with the three course dessert option and it was fantastic. The first course is a delicious mango sorbet with mint jelly. Incredible. The second course is entirely up to you. Mine was the Mt. Fuji and while it was a large serving size, I could not bring myself to put my fork down. It was so good. The cream that comes on top is something I wish I could keep in my pantry and eat all of the time. My boyfriend got the marriage and it was a twist on strawberry shortcake. The cake was moist and the berries were very fresh and juicy. Finally, the last course is a fresh baked chocolate cake with a liquid chocolate center. YUM! It comes with raspberry and passionfruit marshmallows and they were the more fantastic marshmallows I have ever had. I would go back just for those. \nAll in all, this place is the most unique and wonderful restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. It will certainly become a place I frequently visit. \nPs, the staff are so sweet and friendly. I felt so welcomed and it was a great atmosphere to enjoy some of the most delicious desserts I have ever had."

Next thing I noticed the whole team of Raku was singing happy birthday!\nThis place offers everything you can imagine; service, deliciousness and the full experience all at a very reasonable cost.  must I add, it's that perfect date spot."

I haven't had any of their savory stuff but their desserts are top notch and the service is about as attentive as you can get without being overly intrusive.\n\nCame here with a local friend who said I should check it out.  We had the Dessert Prix Fixe and an A La Carte dessert (they charge a little more if you split a Prix Fixe) and he also had a Prix Fixe.  When you receive the actual menu, it comes rolled up in a ring (ours was a sort of pretzel ring).  They gave us a plate of some sort of apple sauce and then game the fun part.  You dip the menu into the sauce and eat it!  Yes this is possibly very gimmicky and yes it's still AWESOME!\n\nOur Prix Fixe started with a pear sherbet dollop that was crisp and refreshing.  The actual main was the Stella which is some sort of fantastic strawberry confection.  It was plated beautifully and had just the right amount of sweetness as well as a little bit of gold flake.  For the third course it was our choice of cream puff and it was just the right size with, again, the right amount of sweetness and sauce.  \n\nFor the A La Carte dessert, I ordered the Carib which was a mixture of cinnamon, fruit, cream, sherbet, and custard in a wine glass.  They place a thin circle of white chocolate over the top and pour a sauce on top which melts away the chocolate, dripping onto the contents of the glass.  The flavors melded well and in my opinion it was the star of the show.\n\nAfterward we inquired about some blue sparkling wine some other guests were having and our server poured us some complimentary glasses with a couple blueberries as garnish!\n\nI would say I was definitely blown away by the experience and actually quite upset I have not found something like it back home in SF.  \n\nThis is absolutely a gem off the Strip and I will make it a point to stop by whenever I am in town."

Sweets Raku is specifically located right next door to Trattoria Nakamura-Ya with a large spoon right next to the front door. \n\nMy husband and I arrived around 8:45 pm last Friday. There were 2 seats available at the bar, where I wanted to sit (after reading the reviews, I wanted to sit here so I can see the chef assembling my order). The chef behind the bar just stared at us but did not bother to acknowledge us and offer us a seat or ask if we would like to sit down... it was just an odd moment for us. Then a female sever came out and I asked her if we could just sit there. She hesitated at first and said we could... not sure why it was a big deal for us to sit there.\n\nBut anyways, sitting at the bar was rather cramped. The woman sitting on my right hand side had a undesirable odor that was rather off putting during our time here. My husband and I both had some trouble getting in and out of our seats as well just because of the lack of room. \n\nIt took some time for someone to bring us the menu after we sat down, as the first female employee who eventually let us sit at the bar did not bring us menus and the chef behind the counter just kept on ignoring us (what a great first impression). Eventually a male server came out and brought us menus and told us about the special $15 dessert set that comes with raspberry sorbet and my choice of one dessert. But if I just want to purchase a dessert on it's own, then it would be $12. Then he left and came back with 2 plates with their edible menu. The menu itself has no taste but you are supposed to dip it in the sauce they bring you. On our visit, we had apricot sauce. \n\nAfter we looked over the menu, we ended up ordering:\n\nDessert set, $15 prior to tax: As mentioned earlier, this came with raspberry sorbet. The sorbet was refreshing. This reminded me of the sorbet that tea rooms serve between courses to cleanse the palate. The dessert I picked was the Stella which is a  strawberry tiramisu. This dessert are artfully plated, which you can tell that someone with the right craft truly perfected it's display. This dessert was pretty good, but I am not sure if it worth $12 (on it's own or $15 as part of their dessert set). \n\nLiver Pate, $7 prior to tax- My husband wanted to get something savory and decided to get this. The liver pate was really good but the 6 pieces of bread is not enough. And although the bread was warmed and perhaps toasted (as we saw the chef place it in the oven in front of us), it didn't taste like it was. And when we asked the male server if we could have more, the couple next to us (who also ordered liver pate) got the extra bread instead of us. They didn't even bother to ask for more. And as soon as the chef gave it to them, the male server came to us right away and said he told her we wanted that bread. My husband got the chef's attention to get some more bread, which we eventually got. \n-------------------------\n(Total= $23.78, includes tax)\n\nAlthough we did like the food, the service was nearly nonexistent. In this little place (12 seats available at the bar and 4 small tables) there were 3 servers on the floor and one or two employees in the kitchen and one chef. Two female servers were just chatting away among some of the restaurant patrons (which I assume must be regulars). The male server was really the only one working and serving others, taking orders down and removing plates. So since he really was the only one really doing his job, this may be the reason why he wasn't very attentive for us. But when we asked for the check, the servers were just so quick to move.\n\nEven with beautifully plated and good food, it can't save this place for a good rating. Service is a HUGE part of the dining experience and can truly make or break your night. And since I was here to celebrate my birthday early, I truly was disappointed with how we were treated. This place is overly hyped and overly priced. And with that, my overall rating for this place stands at 2 stars. \n\nBy the way, they have one unisex restroom. Although other previous yelpers may mention how cool it is, I felt a bit confused when I went in. I literally thought to myself 'I'm confused, I just want to pee' (honestly, I really thought that). I also did not like the sink, as water just splashes all over the floor (must be a pain to clean the floor and walls). \n\nAnd also the ovens facing the bar doesn't do anything except heat things because everything is already cooked. All the chef really does is place items in these ovens to warm them (but even then, items don't come out warm/ hot by the time they get to you) and assemble your dish (especially if you order a dessert). It is all more just for show and nothing else."

Two of my friends who came with us were weaklings and afterwards we de-friended them from Facebook and fed them to the wolves. My other friends who made the brave choice of ordering the pre-fixe however were rewarded with a crown of diamonds and three bags full of gold. I mean, come on people, it's just dessert! Do some air squats and suck it up!\n\nFor our first course I got an amazing orange sorbet and watched as the pretty Japanese pastry chef lovingly made each dish right in front of our eyes! Momentarily I turned into a piglet and went weee weee weee all the way to heaven! Just look at the photos, they were all beautiful works of art! I felt like I just ate a Picasso except I think Sweets Raku tastes much better than an old painting.\n\nWord to the wise, be careful or Sweets Raku will spin its way around your heart and you'll be caught in its web of sugar spun ecstasy.

You can tell that they put a lot of thought into everything, and I love little details like the curved glasses, their utensil holders and that they made a spoon rest out spare wall tiles.\n\nServers are incredibly attentive and friendly - she actually remembered me from the day before when I popped in since John Curtas (mistakenly) said they were unofficially open and serving from the 5th. \n\nThey got their liquor license quicker than expected, so they don't have wine available yet (assume that's coming soon), but they do offer yummy Illy coffee and some tempting tea selections. I went with just an iced latte $4.50, and the coffee ice cubes inside were a nice surprise since the drinks stays cold without getting watered down. \n\nFor now, your only option is to do the three course $19 prix fixe menu w/ an amuse, choice of 3 main desserts, and petits fours. FYI maybe this will change, but it's currently an additional $12 to share - you do get a 2nd amuse and petits fours with a shared dessert. Instead of sharing, I'd suggest just paying the extra $7 so you get another main dessert as well. \n\nThe menu is entirely edible - printed on rice paper and served with a raspberry sauce for dipping. Even the holder ring is made of pretty pulled sugar. Honestly, it wasn't particularly delish, but it's a cool concept to be able to eat your menu. \n\nAmuse came out quickly - it was a really refreshing mango sorbet with mint jelly. It was smooth and basically like eating a fresh mango. The jelly was minty enough that you could taste it, but not overwhelming. \n\nMy neighbors had the strawberry/banana dessert and loved it, but I can't resist chocolate, so I went with Apollo for my main - chocolate and framboise (raspberry) mousse. The desserts are assembled to order before your eyes surprisingly quickly.   \n\nThe signature for Japanese desserts seems to be that they're never too sweet - it may end up being bland to some people, but I really like that you can focus on the flavor vs just tasting the sweetness of sugar. I love mousses, but they usually seem so heavy and rich that you feel like crap after having them. This was somehow really light with the chocolate and raspberry perfectly balanced. I kind felt like there was too much going on w/ all the other components, but it made for a beautiful dish - almost too pretty to eat. \n\nThe petits fours was a mini chocolate lava cake w/ little raspberry and passion fruit marshmellows on the side, and some random raisins too. It's pretty small, about 2\" diameter but it's a petits fours, so you should kind of expect that. Don't expect your typical lava cake, because again, they go light on the sugar so it seemed super chocolatey to me. Kind of like a good quality dark chocolate vs a cheap hershey bar. It was a great way to end the meal. The timing of that last course was a little off - it took a while to arrive since they had to bake it, but she did mention up front that it would take time.\n\nI actually went by myself because nobody wanted to spend $20 on dessert, but it wasn't awkward since everything came out relatively fast and sitting at the counter has kind of a more communal feel. So I did end up chatting with strangers a bit. It was overall a fun and fancy dessert experience without being the least bit pretentious. \n\nI can't really say these were mind blowing desserts, and if you prefer really sweet things, this may not be the place for you. But for the service level, and the fact that they're basically making art before your eyes, I think it's worth the $19 price. It's about the experience, and it's definitely a great date spot. The server even chased me down in the parking lot to give me an opening day giftbag with a chocolate cake, mini madelines and an almond cookie. She was too cute.  \n\nI don't know that this is really a negative, but I was a little surprised that there was really nothing asian about any of the desserts - I kind of expected more Japanese influenced flavors like matcha and yuzu. But the menu is supposed to constantly change, so  who knows for the future"

            "review": "We dined at Herbs & Rye and made it a point NOT to get dessert there. That's usually very out of the question, but on this particular occasion, an anticipated three course dessert was reason enough.\n\nThree courses of dessert?! Yup.  I had only imagined the concept in my fondest of thoughts.  My girl friend had been here before and was excited to bring me. I think I was really way more excited than she was. \n\nWe came in and got lucky there was a spot for two at the bar open. The place itself, it's very clinical and contemporary with its stark white walls and decor. The ladies manning the fort were friendly and kept up with the diners' oohs and aahs. Oh and endless photo-taking. \n\nWe each opted for the three or maybe four course dessert which came with dessert wine. Even the menu was edible. I surely loved that little touch! Each course was meticulously prepared and artfully presented. \n\nNow these aren't your fattening, carbloady desserts. Surprisingly each course was light, airy, but still satisfying that sweet tooth.  Each course was a curious surprise waiting to unravel. \n\nWe both had an amazing time and I can't wait for a similar concept to be brought to CA."

Just a heads up because first time I ever went I was confused if the GPS took me to the right place and couldn't find it immediately.  Ok now that is done, this place is such a wonderful experience! They don't just have desserts, but also have appetizers, quiches, and sandwiches.  I have had the crab quiche and the salmon croissant, I prefer the flavors of the croissant I had the best.   The salmon is cooked perfect and has a great sauce, nice greens, and ikura!  Both came with a soup and dessert.  I got the lobster tomato soup each time, it's served in a tiny cup and so yummy.  Salad is greens in a light citrus dressing and potato salad.  The desserts are wonderful to watch being made, and if it's someone's birthday they will malwnit extra special.  I have had the red tiramisu, and the Carib served in the big wine class.  My favorite was the carib it had so many flavors and textures that meld together into something amazing!  The foi gra pate is also amazing and I highly recommend it.  Their bathroom is pretty cool, but I do wish there was a purse hook, and while the sink is cool it kinda splashes every where.  The restaurant itself is super clean, modern, and fresh.  I can't wait to got again!  Oh and heads up if you bring someone who doesn't plan to order, regardless if they share food, there is a 5 dollar plate sharing fee. Probably to cover the edible menu at the beginning."

A friend recommended this place to me and said it was a must visit, and was he right.\n\nWhen you first walk up, wine racks are on display in the front window. Walking in, the place is stark white with marble countertops and tables. Try to get a seat at the bar if you can so you can watch Chef Mio in all her glory, plating up your dessert.\n\nWe opted for the 2 course menu ($15). It included an amuse (for us it was either coconut sorbet or blueberry champagne sorbet) and one of 5 main desserts. The desserts are pretty large, definitely big enough to share after a large meal. I chose the caribe (melon sorbet, br\u00fbl\u00e9ed banana, coconut panna cotta, mango, kiwi and some pastry stick. It was presented in a wine glass and when she set it down, there was a chocolate wafer set on top. She pours a liquid (mango) on top and it melts the wafer and falls into the glass. \n\nMy friends got the apple pie with honey ice cream and a whipped cream filled blown sugar apple. And the other got a chocolate souffl\u00e9 that the chef injected creme anglaise into right upon presentation. All completely blew me away. The presentation, execution and service were on point. Americanos were delicious. \n\nThey do also have a savory section for those that don't have a sweet tooth. \n\nDefinitely recommending this to anyone heading to Vegas!"

I can appreciate a nice presentation (I'm the first one at the table usually to complain about food aesthetics), but at the end of the day the food needs to taste as good as it looks and in this case it was not there.

SR is located West of the 15 on Spring Mountain Rd.\n\nAs the name indicates, SR specializes in desserts.  However, they do have savory items on the menu like foie gras torchon ($18) & caviar ($30).  We shared the three course Prix Fixe that comes w/ an amuse (mango gelato), your choice of one of the desserts of the day:  We chose the baton (chocolate rolled dough) filled w/ pistachio & chocolate mousse, and a cream puff filled w/ chocolate cream.  The price is normally $17, but because we shared it was $24 (O_o).  In addition, we ordered 5 macarons for $9 to go.  The meal starts whimsically, because the menu is edible and they give you a raspberry sauce to dip it in.  Unfortunately, the menu reminded me of a communion wafer, and was apros pos for the remainder of the prix fixe.\n\nThe amuse tasted good:  The mango flavor really stood out.  But it wasn't worth the average of $8 for the 3 course prix fixe:  2 Stars.  On the other hand, the second course tasted very good (especially the baton).  The baton had several layers and the fillings were very flavorful:  4 Stars.  Lastly, the third course was pretty bad.  There wasn't much too it, and the portion was tiny for the $8 average price:  2 Stars.\n\nBTW, we tried the macarons the next day, and they were OK.  They were not as good as Bottega Louie's, and definitely not better than Bouchon's:  3 Stars.\n\nOur waitress Yuta was super nice.  However, the courses came out very slowly.  Additionally, we noticed several guests were turned away because of a wait vs putting them on a waiting list and asking them to return:  3 Stars.  The ambiance is pretty cool.  There is an interesting spoon out front, there are tins of tea on the wall, and wine bottles in a dope display case.  However, this place is very cramped.  Its best to sit at the bar to see your creations being made:  3 Stars.\n\nIMHO, this place is overhyped and appeals primarily to females - Including my yf Dani S.  But she didn't notice me cos she was on a date.  In any case, my date looked better than her, so Dani would have been mad!  - LOL!!!  In reality, there was only two guys on a Sat nite, and the place was packed).  Nonetheless, I won't be coming back.  I am not sure what raku means, but they are running a \"rakut\" here w/ the high prices for mediocre food.  I would have rated this place Two Stars if the service wasn't good."

We struggled to finish this dish. \n\nPRIMAVERA - Okay I really just got this cause the chocolate melting looks amazing BUT it also taste AMAZING. Seriously all the flavours blend in so well and it's just delicious and the right amount. \n\nSweets Raku is def worth the wait and a stop you should make if you're ever visiting Vegas. :)"

            "review": "Oh my goodness, I've never had dessert so fancy! I would expect nothing less though, from a Japanese dessert house.\n\nFOOD\nThere's a minimum order of $12/person so be prepared to buy something if you come here. It doesn't have to be dessert as they have some wine and savory foods as well. All of the desserts are $12 each, but you can order a combo for $15 that includes a main dessert and a scoop of sorbet. The menu rotates all the time so this review is for the November 2015 menu.\n\nRingo: Basically apple pie turned into art. The pastry was super flaky and the apple compote was perfect. It's served with a scoop of honey sorbet topped with cinnamon and a sugar apple filled with whipped cream and honey. AMAZEBALLS. This one is a must-try.\n\nCarib: Panna cotta served in a wine glass with fruit. This one was the least worth it due to the small portion. It was still pretty cool served in a wine glass which is covered with a thin piece of chocolate. They pour this warm sauce through the chocolate which melts it and is fun to watch. The fruits are very fresh and the textures in this dessert are nice and varied.\n\nMt. Fuji: Chestnut cream cake. Very light and not too sweet. This was the least interesting due to the flavor. I would not get this again.\n\nSunset: I was under the impression that this was supposed to be a 'pie' but it was more slush. The peach moscato flavor was very strong which was a turn off for this dessert. It was also slightly stressful to eat this one as it melted quickly. Other than that, the pastry was good.\n\nAMBIANCE\nThe shop is small with about 4-5 tables and bar seating. By the time we left, there was a wait. Everything was white and super clean. I loved the wine display case in the entrance and the cool wall art. I felt pretty fancy eating here LOL. Even water was served in fragile glass tumblers with fancy coasters.\n  Even the bathroom was visually interesting! The sink looks like a well complete with rocks, twigs and a porcelain frog. The toilet is Japanese and has those butt washing buttons.\n\nSERVICE\nThe servers are all Japanese with Japanese hospitality. Quietly polite. Checked up on us often and our waters were never empty.\n\nOVERALL\nI was pretty sad that they didn't have the edible menu when I came, but hopefully they'll bring it back again. The parking lot is small and cramped so account for time to find parking."

That was a while ago and so we finally made it here. Place is pretty awesome. You get a 3 course dessert menu! And the menu is on rice paper so they then serve you a sauce you dip your menu in and eat it! Yeah, kinda crazy and cool. Only thing was the macaron we had was actually kinda terrible. Weird when everything else is really amazing. Would definitely go back though."

It's a small place but it feels very cozy. There is a bar on the right side with a small kitchen counter right in front. All the kitchenware are very cute and classy. One thing I would like to give feedback on is the noise... Right now there is a line inside the store but because the shop is so small the noise sounds very loud. It somewhat ruins the classy, sweet, relaxed atmosphere the store originally has. If they can have the line be outside then it would enhance the tone of the shop. \n\nTheir bathroom is fancy! Japanese butt washing/massaging toilet. They also have a stone like cylinder as their sink.\n\nFood:\nExcellent! Being an Asian with a semi sweet tooth, it is hard to find dessert that I can enjoy eating without it being too sweet. A lot of American desserts are hard to enjoy simply because the sweetness is so strong that I can't even finish it. The sweetness level at Sweet Raku is perfect. Sweet enough for you to enjoy every level of the dish. It is not overwhelming at all. The decorations are just beautiful. It is simple yet it holds a story.\n\nPrice:\nVery reasonable. Could be charging more if you ask me. Just the kitchenware and the presentation alone says \"high class dessert\". I ordered a 2 course dessert meal which includes a mini shot glass tiramisu for appetizer and a coconut/raspberry parfait all for $15 (tax not included)\n\nService: \nMost of the workers here are sweet and very polite. Some smile more than there's but overall the experience receives a thumbs up."

            "review": "I've been wanting to try Sweets Raku ever since I saw a video of their cool desserts on Facebook, but there's always a crazy line outside. Luckily, we came on a Sunday right when they opened and snagged the last 3 seats at the bar. Caution: this place is TINY. \n\nNo doubt that all their desserts looked awesome, but surprisingly, their savory items sound delicious too. Even having just eaten lunch, we couldn't resist ordering a set meal to share.\n\nSalmon Croissant Sandwich - MUST GET. Grilled salmon and salmon roe (for a pop of salt) on buttery croissant. Comes with a mini cup of hearty tomato soup (wish I could get a full bowl of this) and green salad (with a mini side of potato salad too!). \n\nAfter that, we each got the 2 course dessert, which all come with a mini tiramisu \"sorbet\" with coffee jelly, foam, and cereal puffs. This 1st course changes from time to time. The 2nd course, we decided to each get something different so we can try as many as possible.\n\nMars - White chocolate half ball dome painted in red to look like the planet Mars. Within the dome are fresh fruits. The staff will light a shot of Hennessy on fire and pour it over so you can watch it melt and crumble in. The Hennessy will leave a slight bitter taste but the fruits balance it out.\n\nMount Charleston - A sponge cake covered in a mountain of flambeed meringue. The middle layer had a weird taste to it, but everything else was good, including the fruits, chocolate sorbet, and more cereal puffs for crunch.\n\nPrimavera - Pretty presentation in a giant wine glass with lots of fruit and panna cotta in the middle. Topped with a thin layer of chocolate, which melts into the glass when the staff pours warm chocolate over it. The dominant taste is strawberries / raspberries.\n\nIn additional to all this, one of us did the wine pairing, and I did a separate wine taster, which had 3 different wines served in test tubes and came with a mini cheese platter. So cute!"

            "review": "I have been waiting for sweets raku to be opened since a year ago. I visited this place with my husband on the second week after grand opening. We came here with full stomach and high expectation after dinner. I have to say it was worth the wait! We shared the pre-fixed menu ($19) and ordered momo (peach) and champagne rose tea ($6). (FYI, they charge $5 additional for sharing pre-fixed menu and $7 extra for dessert wine pairing !) We had seating at the desert bar and got to see how the magic happened. It was quite a show to see how pastry chef assembled all the pastries into art. \n\nAmuse - Mango sorbet with mint jelly and leaf\nI never had mango with mint together before. I was surprised how well these two flavors went together, Sorbet had a thick texture, and I felt like I had real mango in my mouth. Mint jelly kinda refresh my palate in the end.\n\nMarriage - sponge cake with banana cream and strawberries\nI liked this dish a lot! Sponge cake tasted really moist and soft. Banana cream has just right amount of sweetness. \n\nApollo - Chocolate and framboise mousse cake\nI loved the earl grey ice cream on top of the this chocolate mousse cake. It was definitely the highlight of this dish. Also, the strawberry rice stick was very airy and delish!\n\nPetits Fours - mini lava cake\nlava cake was super chocolatey and went very well with raisins and passion fruit marshmallows. \n\nOur waitress told me that we have the option to order a la carte and it would be $12 each dish. It would definitely be a good option for people just want to have little sweet ending after a full meal from other restaurants. She also told me that sweets raku is gonna change their menu next week. (new items like apple pie and chestnut cream cake... and maybe foie gras dishes) I got really excited after hearing that!! Everyone knows me knows how much I love foie gras hahaaa!! Next time, I will come back to try their cheese plate with dessert wine pairing (illiskillin ice wine) and maybe foie gras dishes!!!!"

It's been a long time and I should go back for a 2nd try, but I'm having trouble bringing myself back when there are so many other delicious options in Las Vegas for desserts. \n\nFor me, it boils down to this:  a little overpriced, but The desserts are very good and the concept is cool (U can eat your menu!)...if you're looking for a unique experience and want to feel like you're in a sweets shop in another country with delicious options and a different atmosphere, then I think you will really like Sweets Raku."

            "review": "Sweets Raku is the brainchild of Mitsuo Endo of the Abriya Raku fame (a 3-time James Beard Award nominee). The concept of this restaurant is a dessert bar, where you come in, order off a prefix menu, or order the desserts \u00e0 la carte. Being a dessert bar, you will be served desserts only (but I've heard that they also have a cheese plate). After hearing some interesting comments about this dessert bar, I went with a buddy after my SnowFlake Shavery fix to get some dessert.\n\nSR is located in the Seoul Plaza on Spring Mountain Road and Jones. It actually sits across the same building complex as Raku. Walking inside, you'll notice an amazing display of bottles of water and other refreshments built into a see-through wall. The clean, modern, and white interior give you a sense that the people who created this restaurant really wanted to give you an unforgettable experience. There is an open kitchen, and around it sits a bar with around 15 seats where you can watch all the desserts being made right in front of your eyes! There are also tables, but if you have the opportunity, sit at the bar and enjoy the show.\n\nThe pastry chef is Mio who is in charge of the kitchen. She's been a pastry chef for over a decade in Japan, but you would never guess due to her youthful appearance. The server dropped off a menu that was rolled up in a sugar ribbon ring. After ordering our drinks and the prix fix menu, we waited for Mio to start. The menu is also edible, and I thought that was a real neat and fun idea to be able to eat a menu!  It didn't have a taste at all, which is good because I would have gagged if it tasted like paper. The server then brought us our drinks.\n\n- Americano coffee: They use the Illy brand coffee, and it was bold and well made.\n\nThe Amuse/First course came up first:\n\n- Strawberry and Mint: A strawberry sorbet with mint jelly, with a fresh sprig of micromint. The strawberry sorbet had a nice strawberry flavor. The texture was sort of weird for me, it wasn't icy... but I guess it wasn't as smooth as I would have liked.  It's hard to describe. On the other hand, the texture of the mint jelly was well done, but I couldn't really taste the mint flavor that much.\n\nThe main entrees then arrived:\n\n- Mt. Fuji: This was a play on the classic French dessert, the Mont Blanc. This was my favorite dessert of the night. The chestnut cream was amazingly light and had a smooth chestnut flavor. The cake was moist, and the chestnut glace complimented the whole dish. The presentation was also pretty cool.\n\n- Apollo: Chocolate and raspberry mousse on top of chocolate cake, Earl grey tea ice cream, raspberry meringue, chocolate bases, and raspberry sauce. I thought the mousse's were all well made and so was the chocolate cake. The chocolate squares around the plate and the Earl Grey Tea ice cream were my favorite part of the dish. The ice cream tasted exceptionally well with the pink peppercorns that were ground on top. I thought the meringue and raspberry sauce were O.K. This was my least favorite dessert, I thought, flavor wise... it was just too safe.\n\nThe petit fours/Last Courses arrived:\n\n- Parmesan cheesecake with oranges: I loved the concept of this dish. It is like eating two different courses in one dish. By itself, the cheesecake is very savory, and I thought that this would make a nice appetizer on a restaurant menu. But then, after eating the cheesecake together with the oranges, it complimented the savoriness of the cheesecake perfectly, and it became a dessert again! I found this to be absolutely fascinating.\n\n- Chocolate Fondant with marshmallows: The warm chocolate molten cake was well executed with a cakey outer shell, and a warm molten interior. It was a well balanced cake. My favorite accompaniment of the night had to go to the lemon marshmallows. They had a bright, strong,  lemon flavor, and they tasted just like a lemon curd! I thought the raspberry marshmallows were lacking in raspberry flavor, but the texture was good.\n\nThe service throughout the night was top notch. The server knew when we needed drinks refilled, and cleared our plates at the right time. She was super friendly and knowledgeable and engaged with us enough, but not overly smothering.\n\nDining at Sweets Raku brought an old smile to my face. It brought me back to those pre-\"Great Recession\" days. I remembered when the properties on the Strip were in competition with each other... not money-wise like they are now...but quality wise. Back then, F&B programs were trying to think of ways to create unforgettable experiences to their guests. Now, it's all about the bottom line, which is why we only see now burger joints, bars, and steak houses popping up, with inconsistent service everywhere. There are some flubs in this place, but you can find flaws at Raku, Joel Robuchon, The French Laundry, etc. But, this place deserves 5 stars, because.. it's the thought that counts. \n\nKudos to Chef Endo and Chef Mio, true artisans of their profession!!!"

Either way you still have to wait since the place is really small. It's worth the wait for a bar seat though, where you can see them creating magic in front of your eyes! They use everything from cakes, fruits, fire, liquid chocolates, to even jellies!\n\nThey start you off with some beverages and they come around putting spoons for right handers on your right. If you're left handed you'll need to let them know so they can switch them.\n\nWe did the 2 course dessert for $15. During this month, they had tiramisu coffee mini cup which was a soft gooey tiramisu top with powder, and delicious coffee jello at the bottom. Good for a good bittersweet start before your sweet course.\n\nThen we shared a Mars, Fuji, and Primavera amongst ourselves! The Mars was a cake of fruits with a dome of chocolate on top that they flamb\u00e9ed with vodka (which means they set the vodka on fire and poured it over the chocolate)! The dome was red so it felt super Christmas~y! The vodka made the cake not so sweet so it was good! The Fuji was a fluffy dessert of yummy and that was really fun to watch them make it!\n\nMy favorite was the Primavera, which kind of looks like ice cream or dessert in a cup! A mix of yummy coconut panna cotta with fruits, and raspberry syrup poured over a white chocolate lid that melts! Oh my gosh, it was so yummy! This one was super sweet and tasty with so many complex flavors!\n\nThe only thing I felt like they could change are the alcoholic drinks. We had some champagne sake and they had added a sweet jello in the drinks. It turned the drink into an alcoholic dessert but it was thick and not liquid~y. Made it a little hard to quench our thirst with the thickness. I eventually ordered water, had some of my friend's tea, and gave my friend the champagne! The taste and flavor was good though, just maybe not for me!\n\nHowever, I would definitely come back to try every single dessert on the menu!"

We were fortunate enough to run into Cathy C. (maybe you recognize her form her S.R. ROTD fame--the duchess herself).  Cathy offered some suggestions and we were on our way to a blissful experience.\n\nSweets Raku is as much about the experience as it is the dessert.  The food is presented masterfully with an eye for composition.  Most of the seating is at the bar--allowing not only for a pure, open feel, but also for a wonderful look into the art of plate presentation...a Vegas show worth checking out!   The ambiance is angelic.  I was waiting to hear Morgan Freeman or James Earl Jones' voice welcome me through the back door of heaven...instead the door at the back leads to one of the cooler bathrooms in Vegas...and yes, this is still part of the experience, so be sure to check out the bathroom while you're here.\n\nThe desserts are well above average, but play on the clean/delicate side as opposed to the ooey gooey/decadent side of tasty treats.  While quite nice, the short of it is that I would not give out 5 stars on the desserts alone.  When paired with the preceding paragraph, I am all-in!\n\nSweets Raku also has one of the better selections of dessert wines...dessert wines are not my cup of tea...err...glass of vino, but I did enjoy the dessert wine pairings...they're worth a shot to those moderately open to the idea.  They also have a few nice Reds and Whites...so you're safe if you despise dessert wines...in fact they offer a couple pinot noirs that are mellow enough to pair with many of the the deserts.   Speaking of pinoits, they offer a few savory items including a cheese plate that is asking to be paired with a glass of pinot or balanced red wine.\n\nStay away if you are afraid for paying a little more $$$ for a little less in dessert quantity, but put Sweets Raku at the top of dessert list if you are looking for great experience and a break from the norm."

I sat at the counter and had a great view of how they prepared the desserts. They literally make everything as it's ordered so it does take some time to get your food. I got the 2 course and one a la carte.\n\nCoffee jelly tiramisu: This one came with the 2 course dessert and had layers. This is where you dig through the milk foam and some kind of mousse to get to the coffee jelly. If you don't, tastes like frothy milk. Once I tried everything together, the coffee flavor was pretty prominent and the cream chilled it out. \n\nThe carib: This one was made beautifully in a wine glass and had a piece of white chocolate on top. Some kind of sauce was poured over it, causing it to melt in the dessert. This was a mix of fruits, sorbet, and creams for a refreshing melon tasting dessert! This was by far my favorite one. \n\nForgot what the last one was called but it was a purplish sponge cake that they injected cream into. Make sure you get every layer because we didn't notice that there was a berry compote on the bottom until the end. This cake was pretty good as it was super fluffy and had a hint of what tasted like taro. The compote sent it over the top with it it's sweetness!\n\nOverall, great date or girls night place, but I wouldn't bring that many people because it only seats 30 and you literally just line up to wait."

The African American gentleman with glasses. He definitely had a stick up his butt or something. He treated us like we were poor and couldn't afford anything on the menu.... He didn't even give us water! We were the only two at the bar with no water. He was also no where to be seen. Uh bro we spent 80$ on a wine flight, 2 drinks and 2 desserts.... Obviously I can afford luxury desserts. It doesn't help that the chefs behind the counter don't know any English... I had asked one girl a few questions and she couldn't communicate with me :(\n\nThe inside of the place is super small but cute! We got the apple, and the Mars dessert which were both delicious! Our glasses of wine were delicious too... We had the port. However the wine flight was a rip off.... It was literally a baby test tube filled to the top... It was equivalent to the size of 1/4 of a shot"

The experience here is definitely worth it. It's dessert made picture worthy. They make it in front of you. You know these pastry chefs didn't just learn to make dessert in the kitchen at home. They had to have gone to some culinary arts school of some sort. \n\nFOOD CONSUMPTION:\n\nEDIBLE MENU: What!?!  Yes, I said it...the menu is edible. It's not delicious though. It reminds me of the communion bread you get at Catholic churhes. Yet, it's still interesting. (1 star)\n\nAMUSE: Part of the Prix Fixe menu. It's a pineapple sorbet with white jelly. It was ok. (3 stars)\n\nBATON: I forget exactly what was in this, but I think I liked this one the best of all of them. Probably because there was chocolate and I love chcolate. (4 stars)\n\nSTRAWBERRY TIRAMISU: 3.5 stars\n\nCARIB: 4 stars\n\nPETIT FOUR: 3 stars\n\nSorry for the lack of description in the items. It's been a few months since I visited and I forget my exact feelings on each one. See Marvy S's review. She has a more descriptive review as to the ingredients involved in each of these. \n\nLOCATION:\nThe place is rather small. There are a couple of tables placed away from the kitchen, but for the experience it's better to sit at the dessert bar so you can watch them in action. It's really clean and modern inside. The bathroom is quite an experience as well. Sort of zen like. It's worth a visit. \n\nIn a nutshell, I'm glad I was able to visit this place. You get picture worthy desserts and the flavor isn't all that bad. It's not mouth wateringly delicious though. Probably good for a guy to take his date if she likes desserts."

When I saw the video of the food, it was hard for me to believe the food was served at a small shop at a dark parking lot. There was two raku in the plaza but the one in the back is closed or something. Raku sweets is the one on the side with a red carpet and big spoon.\n\nInterior: cute but small. Cute candy box on the wall and a wine glass. The store is really small though so the wait for it is kinda long. There was only 4 family in front that were either actually a family or just couples yet it took almost 40 minutes. So expect a small line yet long wait.\n\nService : really nice and friendly servers. They try their best to make the food come out as fast as possible but it still takes a while. The water refill is a bit slow. The friendly smiles you get makes up for it though. \n\nFood: I love it the desserts there. But I was super disappointed when they ran out of the ringo though (the apple dessert that you have to break open). So instead, I ordered Mars and the carib. Mars was unique. The heat brandy and light it while pouring it down to the dessert which melts the chocolate on top. The mousse was good but the brandy was strong. The carib dessert was the best. I wasn't expecting much because I dislike cinnamon but I didn't even taste it. After eating Mars which had a strong taste, the cup dessert was light and refreshing. The fruits and mousse went well with the sorbet melon balls. The mango sauce that melted the chocolate on top was a perfect match to the dessert overall. The carib dessert is a must try.\n\nOverall, I really love the dessert and wished I could have tried Ringo too. Really good service and in my opinion, worth the wait."

Although the menu selection isn't huge, it will never get old to sit down at the bar and watch the skilled artists here create people's desserts. I got the Fuji Mountain because I'm a sucker for chocolate, while my brother and my mom enjoyed their Caribs. I've tried all four main dishes that were offered here in the past, and they were all absolutely delightful. For some dishes, the dessert chef may even allow customers to put the finishing touches on their own dessert!\n\nThe servers are young, sweet, attentive, and more than willing to answer customers' questions.  \n\n$12 for a dessert may seem pricey at first glance, but it really isn't, considering how much effort and attention to detail goes into each of these creations. I also see that they have added some new items to the menu, so I will definitely be back! \n\nIf you haven't already, make sure you check this gem out."

The MENU!\n\nTID BITS: \n1) Sweets Raku is located in Chinatown in the same parking lot as Raku (japanese grill restaurant).  Next to a massage place. The sign is super small. \n2) $19 for a 3 course prie fixe (you get to pick 1 dessert. The other 2 are the amuse and a petit four, which is already set for the day).  $7 for one glass of wine for pairing.  $12 for ala carte desserts.  \n3)  Kid friendly, however it's a small place with a quiet atmosphere.  \n\nWith a cute open kitchen, Mio Ogasawara (2013's Pastry Chef of the Year) and her assistant created our beautiful sweets right in front of our eyes.  A truly talented  team.  \n\nThe experience and surprises that Sweets Raku brings to the table is an adventure in itself.  AND I'm sure every visit is different. I won't reveal too much, so you too can be WOWed like us. \n\nHere are a few SNEAK PEEKS: \n1)  CARIB (coconut panna cotta). This dessert is NEW for the summer. It's SO refreshing, light and filled with tropical ingredients (papaya, kiwi, banana flamb\u00e9).  A show in itself.  MY FAVE.  I'm still drooling over the melon cream. It's DELIGHTFUL. \n\n2) BATON (chocolate & pistachio mousse).  Did you know chocolate could be spread  thinly and baked?  You need to check out the construction of this!  \nBold chocolate flavors with a very mild pistachio mousse. Hidden surprises inside. Hubby enjoyed this dish...for the chocolate lovers!\n\n3)  CREAM PUFFS (our petit four for the day).  Sounded boring at first. But, pretty darn good.  We got to choose our cream and jam.  Puffs were airy and crisp. Creams were light (not sweet); I liked the strawberry.  You can taste the fresh fruit extracted to make the jams.   \n\n-PRESENTATION AND EXPERIENCE: 6 stars!\n-TASTE: 4.5 stars.  Desserts were not  too rich or heavy (which is a good thing).  Was hoping the petit four would be more  unique. \n-SERVICE: Friendly! Make sure you hang onto your dish until you are completely done.  One gal had a tendency to take the dish away too soon.  She actually took away my menu, when I wasn't done yet.  She brought me another one without question  (to eat!!). \n \nYOU GOTTA CHECK OUT THE BATHROOM.  I laughed and stayed giddy the entire time in there.  It's quite the experience.   \n\nHave fun!  This place is a MUST TRY."

It's remotely analogous to integrating the wonders of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the classiness of the cocktail bar, the novelty of Benihana, and the comfort of the breakfast at your kitchen's bar stools.\n\nNote that there is a minimum order of one dessert per customer, so come with a prepared wallet and stomach. Desserts are $12 each, with the option to upgrade to an extra course of the ice cream/sorbet daily special for $15. (There are also $5 cream puffs, and I'm not sure if it counts for the minimum order)\n\nMy MOUNT FUJI was a heavenly mountain of chestnut cream covering a snow-capped top of whipped cream and a fluffy sponge cake base with bits of candied chestnut in between. The exterior was garnished with angular pieces of crispy crepes (similar to Gavotte cookies) and chocolate with the name of the store, with a dusting of cocoa for good measure. The various textures and fragrant chestnut prepared two ways made a memorable and photogenic dessert. I found it too sweet, but I'm the type of person who avoids anything over 30% sugar milk tea like the plague; I think it suits the taste of most people. \n\nThe boo liked the MARS for its incorporation of alcohol. I disliked it because the server torched and melted the shell before I could take a satisfying picture of the exterior. (First world problems...) The yuzu mousse and chocolate cream with hazelnut and blackberry, covered with brandy-flamb\u00e9ed white chocolate did feature an excellent blend of citrus, nutty, fruity, sweet, and alcoholic, rendered even more complex by the torching. The smooth dome with Mars-like crimson swirls was beautiful and melted with poise, though afterwards it looked like an amorphous mush reminiscent of anatomy lab. My slight disappointment with the interior is compensated by the unique preparation of the plate with a yellow gradient from a wizardly magical candy spray-paint spout. \n\nThe heavy smell of sugar and baking is in the air to entice those with a sweet tooth. Decor was minimalist yet bouge, with white marble counters. Even the water cups are modern with a tulip glass shape and a slip-proof mat that looks like lego.\n\nPro tip: The ideal time to visit is when there's still seating at the bar, but with other visitors having placed orders so you can watch more desserts being made. We went after lunch around 1:30pm on a weekend and it was perfect."

They used the minimum amount of sugar which is how most Japanese desserts are, but I prefer my desserts to be alot sweeter. \n\nThe presentation of the desserts is what makes this place so popular , the interior of the restaurant is beautiful, stark white and clean, but has warm accents especially with the oven right in the middle.

You can spend the whole day here!!\n\nIt's a small intimate restaurant, I don't know if I can even call it that but I will for now. It's mostly bar seating with a few tables, but personally I think everyone would rather sit at the bar. You get to watch them make everything! Well most of everything at least. \n\nSo first off the edible menu....it's basically rice paper, which was awesome by itself but they gave us an apricot dipping sauce when we went. It changes from what the server told me, so it was currently apricot, which is one of my favorite fruits! Score! \n\nI got the three course dessert, prix fixe which isn't too badly priced honestly. Although I wouldn't spend $19 on dessert normally all the time, but once in a while and if you go to any upscale restaurant then it's really honestly not bad at all. \n\nStarted off with a raspberry sorbert which was presented perfectly on a plate, it was fun to watch them plate everything and the techniques they use. Typical Japanese sorbert, at least for me (again I grew up in Japan) it wasn't too sweet basically perfect amount of sweetness! \n\nThe Stella was almost too pretty to eat. I mean it was stunning to look at and I really just would have been satisfied staring at it, but alas you gotta eat it at some point!! The creme they use wasn't overpowering and didn't take away from the fruits. The tiramisu with the strawberries was delicious. I think it might be one of their popular dishes and well I could tell why just by the presentation of it and with the taste matching that of the presentation just shows you how the craftsmanship of this was top of the line!\n\nAnd finally a creme puff, it was alright, nothing too superb as the bread part was too hard for my tastes. I like it when it's soft, but the creme inside was pretty good as it wasn't super sweet. The gelatin cubes were cute!! Reminded me of the candy I always used to get called cube while I was growing up in Japan. \n\nThe servers are mostly Japanese that speak your typical FOB English, but it isn't too bad. And I'm sure they wouldn't mind if you wanted to try practicing your Japanese with them."

We had to wait for about 30 minutes before being seated, but it was well worth it. The attention to detail is extraordinary, and it is not made in vain. We ordered the desserts a la carte, rather than as a course with the sorbet, and did not regret our decision. They also had an extensive tea collection - I enjoyed an oolong variety. \n\nI'd recommend coming as a couple or small group, larger groups may take a while to accommodate."

It's a small, hidden restaurant in the middle of a shopping complex. The seating is limited and it's first come, first serve. The menu is simple; 3-course prix fixe dessert experience. They'll start you off with a light desert appetizer, \"main dessert\", and small \"dessert, dessert\". When we went, we sampled fresh fruit sorbet with white wine jelly; a chocolate banana souffle; and finished with a custom favored cream puff. \n\nAll desserts are prepared fresh and assembled to order. Just look at the pictures - the desserts are work of arts. \n\nDefinitely will be back."

When we first pulled up the line was literally out the door, but in the short amount of time for us to park the line was reduced to half. (This is such false advertisement.) Once inside you realize that you are in it for a long wait. The decor is clean and simple with the counter displaying the pasty artists at work. After waiting for about an hour and half, we got a seat at the counter and our show started.\n\nHe ordered the Puffy Cup and I got the Ringo.\nThe Puffy Cup is a berry souffle and it was interesting to watch it rise in the oven before our eyes. While that was baking the 2 chefs were busy at work making a handful of dishes. I saw my candy apples being made in front of my eyes and my apple pie pasty baking up. During this time I saw a couple of the Caribs made for some other customers.\n\nThe Puffy Cup was light as air and not overly sweet. The vanilla cream filling was just enough but not heavy on the cream. The best part was the little mango jelly on the side.\nThe Ringo was beautiful.  The apple pie was delicious and the crest was a flaky, buttery delight. The honey ice cream on the side complimented the pie perfectly with the dash of cinnamon. The candy apple was too pretty to eat but I eventually cracked it open. Inside was whipped cream and caramel.\n\nAll in all, a lovely experience and the desserts were very yummy. Would I come again? No, the wait was not worth it. Glad I had the experience, but the desserts did not change my world."

We decided to share the course since we have already had big meal. Later, same waitress came back and said we had to order one more desert because they charge per seat. Seriously!!!! You charge for my daughter to sit at the bar??? Anyway, we end up order 1 more desert to go as they REQUEST. Overall it was a good experience, desert was delicious. But seem to be over price.

With a 2013 Pastry Chef of the Year award by Desert Companion, and a tie for best desserts(with Art of Flavors) by Mr. Eating Las Vegas, Chef Mio is ON FIYAH!!!! While Chika Tilman at Chikalicious in NYC may have started this concept, Sweets Raku has definitely elevated it...\n\nWe arrived at about 8pm to an already PACKED house and endured a 45 minute wait which was perfect because the spots that cleared up for our party of four were dead center at the bar, so we could see all the action! There have been some changes lately...a couple of pastry cooks have been added to assist Chef Mio and her assistant behind the scenes, especially during crunch time. The menu has undergone some changes too. The Marriage and Mt. Fuji desserts are still there...gone are the Apollo, Veil, and Ringo Desserts. They have been replaced by:\n\nTHE ANGEL CREAM-Fromage and Pear with white chocolate wings and a pulled sugar halo\n\nTHE BATON-Chocolate tuile cylinder filled with  chocolate cake, passionfruit gelee, chocolate and pistachio mousses and a pulled sugar ribbon.\n\nRED ROCK(The newest dessert)-Raspberry and white chocolate fondant(or lava cake, whichever you prefer ;) with streusel, vanilla and pistachio ice cream, yuzu marshmallow, and vanilla tuile garnished with spun sugar.\n\nWe decided to share the Baton and Red Rock Desserts since at that time, they were out of the Angel Cream dessert,( which was back on the menu by the time we were finished). Again, we enjoyed both desserts which were artistically presented with great flavors and textures while not being tooth achingly sweet. I also enjoyed my Iced Latte which never tasted watered down thanks to a genius idea of a coffee ice cube! \n\nFinishing out our sweet journey, the Chocolate Fondant has also been replaced by a crisp warm cream puff made to order with your choice of vanilla or chocolate cream flavored with your choice of ganache, black currant, or strawberry filling.\nI will repeat again that this is a DESSERT EXPERIENCE, and if your idea of dessert is off a dollar menu, or \"$20 can feed the whole family\" at places like Mickey D's, Wendy's, Jack in the Crack, or Sonic, don't even bother coming here, and step aside for those who seek this type of adventure.

As for the tea, we tried Tokio (sweet berries green tea) and Sakurambo (Japanese cherry black tea) with our dessert prix fixe. I have officially tried all their desserts, yay!\n\nAmuse:\nMango sorbet with mint jelly.  The mango sorbet was a little bit tangy but very delicious with the mint jelly. I had the strawberry sorbet the first time. Both flavors are very good since they're two of my favorite fruits. 5/5\n\nMt. Fuji:\nSpongecake, chestnuts with chestnut cream, chestnut tuile, chestnut and chocolate. I grew up liking chestnuts and chestnuts in dessert isn't common in Western cuisine so, this was a no-brainer.  5/5\n\nRingo:\nApple pie with honey ice cream, white chocolate dusted with cinnamon. There's a sugar candy shaped like an apple that has cream inside. An American classic got exciting again. Break the candy apple with your spoon for cream to put on your apple pie. The apple pie itself isn't sweet so eat it with honey ice cream. 5/5 \n\nVeil:\nStuffed custard pie is what i says on the edible menu so it doesn't sound so interesting. I really was hesitant to order this because how exciting is custard pie? But I must say, I saved the best for last. What you get is flaky pastry with custard on top and in the middle...on top of berry cream swimming in compote all wrapped in a web made of sugar. The Apollo (chocolate and raspberry mousse) is a safe and obvious choice for chocoholics like me but I stepped out of my comfort zone and I'm glad I did. This is the best item they have on their menu. Confetti and glitter! 5/5\n\nExcellent service as usual and our server, Kazue remembered me from my first visit. I'm still in love with this place. It makes me feel like a kid again. Genius! I think I might be addicted to this place now. The best way to end my birth month. Remember to join their e-mailing list.  Sit at the bar (if it's available) so you can watch the action and talk to the chefs. It's $19 for the prix fixe menu (sorbet + your choice of dessert + petit four) or $12 for just dessert (Apollo, Marriage, Veil, Mt. Fuji or Ringo). If you get Apollo wit your prix fixe, you'll get cheesecake instead of the lava cake. For descriptions of the other dessert items, read my previous review.\n\n*Please do not copy and paste any parts of my review - write your own. Kthnxbye!"

Me and my bf each got the combo. I recommend everything I got. Check out my videos for how the dessert looks like. \n\nMars - white chocolate half ball dome paint in red to look like planet Mars. Within the white chocolate dome is fresh fruits. The staff will light a shot of Hennessy on fire and pour it over the dessert where you can watch it melt and crumble in. The Hennessy will leave a slight bitter taste but the fruits will balance it out. \n\nCoffee sorbet - flavorful and comes with coffee jelly. Served in a small espresso shot cup\n\nPrimavera - must get. Coconut panna cotta with fruits served in wine glass covered with a chocolate sheet. Staff will pour a raspberry sauce over the sheet and you can watch it melt into your dish. \n\nRaspberry sorbet - flavorful and refreshing. \n\nIf you have a sweet tooth, make sure you check this place out."

(omg is my oenophile side showing?)\n\ncons:\n- small! it's literally a bar, with a few seats to watch them assemble your desserts, and i think 2?3? 4top tables. so, not a place to bring 9 friends for dessert. but if your date has a sweet tooth, this place will definitely wow her\n- pricey... ??? i guess? i mean our set menu, which came with a starter and delightful dessert was $15. not cheap, but considering the quality and the type of dessert you get, pretty spot on. i would not be afraid to pay $15 for just the pear pie i had at a regular restaurant. \n- small and delicate. if you're expecting giant american sized desserts, this is the antithesis of that. don't expect a slice of cake that you can share with your 9 friends. \n\nwould i come again? sure!"

Another con the place is TINY... There are 3 4-tops against the wall and about 12 seats at the counter. Very crowded seatings!! There is usually always a wait... I have been there when the line goes all the way out the door... Definitely try to go right when they open or later. Another con is that they no longer have the edible menu that they had when they first opened :(\n\nEven though the parking and the line situation sucks... I would definitely go through it for this place. Great service, the ladies are so nice, offered water right when you are seated and we were greeted warmly. If you sit at the bar you can see the ladies put dessert together and it's such a piece of art. The desserts look good and tastes good! \n\nThe ladies are also very nice, whenever they pour sauce over a dessert or set something on fire, they let you know and count to 3 so you can take pictures or videos. Very considerate of us foodies who want to take pictures of everything. \n\nI have been here twice now and would definitely keep coming back since their desserts change from time to time."

Well, now I might just bypass the buffet, and eat somewhere else and hit up Raku for dessert when I'm in Vegas.\n\nA friend of mine posted a video they had online of the bonkers dessert presentations that they have here, and I was about to head to Vegas, so I figured I'd give it a shot. We came in around lunch time, because nobody in the group was actually hungry yet, but figured since it was just dessert, we could go roam afterwards if we weren't full.\n\nRight around the crack of noon we show up. From the outside, it seems like you're in the wrong place. Especially since there's another building in the area with the name Raku. It's got a big plate glass door and rows of wine bottles, so it seems like more of a restaurant, but it's the right spot. It's located in between a massage parlor, and the excellent Kabuto sushi restaurant.\n\nJust about 10 minutes after we get seated, the place fills up. And there's not a lot of room inside. Pretty quickly, there's a line has formed and it's almost out the door, so if you're dying to check this place out...either come solo or in a group of 2, or come early.\n\nI ordered the sandwich and dessert set. This consists of one of their sandwiches of your choice, whatever seasonal sorbet they want to serve that day, and a dessert of your choice. The sandwich also comes with a cup of soup and a salad.\n\nThe soup was some kind of tomato seafood bisque, and it was very rich and flavorful. The sandwich seemed like it might be a bit odd, but the salt and richness of the roe works great in the croissant with the salmon.I would have been happy with a meal just consisting of that.\n\nThen came the dessert. I ordered the Mars, but after hearing a bunch of people talking about how the Ringo was the thing to get, I switched my order over. One of my friends go their panna cotta (Primavera?), and the other got their version of a Mont Blanc (Spring Mountain). Everyone loved their desserts, and even though, I think the Mars has a more grandiose presentation, I'm certainly not going to complain about the Ringo. It all tasted great. My friends loved their desserts as well, though they were disappointed with the Iberico bacon sandwich.\n\nSadly, they don't do much in the way of take out, so if you want to hook up a friend who wasn't able to join you, all you can do is bring back some cookies. While they are damn fine cookies, they're just not quite as great as a full dessert would be. Though, I can't really blame them for not wanting to let people take delicate dessert home into the Vegas desert.\n\nThis will definitely be on my list of places to hit up if I'm in town. They were even offering all-you-can-drink sangria while we were there for $12, and that was tough to turn down."

The d\u00e9cor here is simple, clean looking, modern, and bright. One of my sidekicks loves coming here so I've been here a few times.\n\nThe dessert bar seats only a number of people, less than 10. Upon seating, they'll provide you a menu as well as a pre-fix menu. What's interesting a bout the pre-fix menu is that the ring is hard candy and the menu itself is edible. Similar to unleavened church bread. \n \nThe dessert here is good. Didn't think it was great. Subtle, simple, and not overpowering. Presentation is like artwork. Drink menu is full of dessert cocktails and dessert wines. The Red Rock which is a raspberry fondant with gelato is unique, colorful, and quite good. Another dessert that is very good is the Carib which is a coconut panna cotta. What's interesting about this dish is watching them make it. it's served in a wine glass with a printed top layer of white chocolate and warm mango sauce poured over.  \n\nAlso check out the cool sink and toilet/bidet in the restroom At first, it thought it was a radio. Watch out if you press the wrong button standing up, you'll get water squirted in your face. Not my experience. Just saying. \n\nDefinitely a unique experience."

Main Course, I chose Mt. Fuji, a light chestnut cake. It was just heavenly. Last, a molten lava cake with marshmallow and another raspberry mousse on the side. Angel Creme is also very good!! \n\nit was like a light sweet dessert-dinner, and I loved it.

I highly recommend the prix fixe menu.\n\nUPDATE: No more edible menu. A lot of stuff are premade and they just assemble it anywhere on the counter (usually towards the kitchen), no longer making it specifically in front of you. It'll still take them about 1.5 - 2 hours to make you your food b/c they're making other people's food and you're just waiting. It's still very pretty desserts for the most part. Try the Mars dessert. They light it on fire."

This is definitely a place for dessert fans. \n\nThe decor is very clean, white and modern. There's an impressive wine shelf covering most of the front of the store. My friends and I got in at the last minute before they closed and were able to sit at the bar. I wish I had a better memory of this, but I think most of us got the prix fixe menu which is basically an appetizer dessert and your full-sized dessert. \n\nI had the Jack in a Cup which is a chocolate souffle with a hot, creamy banana concoction underneath. There were various jelly-mousse things decorating my plate. Nearly all their dessert dishes are beautiful and sitting at the counter, you get to watch them make it in front of you.\n\nI also had a Cherry Blossom tea. When we walked in, I kind of gushed seeing the familiar Lupicia tea brand. They make awesome fruit-infused teas, so I was anxious to try one that I never had before. The tea went well with the dessert. I just wish we had more time to hang out there even though we pretty much stayed there past closing time. \n\nIf I ever come back to Vegas, I'd definitely want to come back to do the Raku and/or Sweets Raku."

Sweets Raku is a perfect little getaway.\n\nI was lucky enough to have found out about this place via a Facebook video.\n\nFor a weekend, the wait wasn't the worse I've experienced. It was probably a good hour wait. Seating is limited to about 4 tables and 13 bar seats. Whatever you do, it's totally worth it to sit by the bar. The bar offers the whole experience of watching the chefs do their magic. Videos and pictures sweetly welcomed. \n\nIn addition to sweets, they also have some snacks and lunch. But who comes for those?! \n\nLots of drinks offered. Tea, coffee, wine and beer. I opted for a Momoko Iced Tea. They carried the brand, Lupicia, and it comes in many different varities. \n\nFor desserts my boyfriend and I shared:\n\nMy Favorite, Mars: \"Creamy Yuzu mousse with hazelnuts & milk chocolate crisp mix deliciously trapped inside the red chocolate dome and flamb\u00e9ed with brandy.\"\n\nHis Favorite, Primavera: \"Sorbet & Mousse paired with fresh raspberry and strawberry in a cup.\"\n\nPresentation definitely wins. I mean, who doesn't like to see things melt? The flavors work well together and it's not too sweet. Sweet Raku is a pretty nifty treat. Perfect for a date or a day to splurge yourself. For $12 a dessert, I thought it was reasonable."

I guess because its not high season for Vegas and its already been opened a while, there was practically no line. 2 parties before us and we got seated within 30 minutes (the place is small. 3 tables and an L shaped bar only). It was about 9pm. \n\nThey were out of foie gras so we got some Pate, which was very flavorful, and had a layer of caramelized sugar on top that added a hint of sweetness to play off the savory. For dessert, we got the Ringo (deconstructed apple pie) and the Primavera (panna cotta and sorbet)\n\nThe Ringo was delicious. After seeing many reviews on how items don't taste as good as they look, I wasn't expecting it to be this good! the candy apple was much smaller than I imagined but it was light, playful, and delicate with caramel inside. The pastry under the apple compote thing was SUPER flaky. I ate that part last because i assumed it'd be typical and difficult to eat but the flavor of the apple mix was amazing and the tender flakiness of the pastry took it to another level. \n\nThe Primavera was ordered mostly for its interactive presentation purposes but it was DELICIOUS! Again, I was probably not expecting much in taste so I was surprised at how tender and delicate the panna cotta was. I also LOVE berries and fruity sauces any day and watching it melt the creamy chocolate all over everything was just the icing on the cake. \n\nIts not cheap but its good. Will definitely go back and try other menu items, hopefully the foie gras."

Yeah seriously I think you are just paying for the experience.  All the things they do in the open air kitchen is jaw dropping, which makes you think the dessert that will be served to you will be phenomenal. I came on a Saturday night with a friend and we waited about 45 minutes to be seated. We had dinner prior to coming, so we opted for the Ala Cart but we did consider getting the full course since you get more of your money's worth I guess. Thankfully we didn't because the desserts were nothing spectacular and to be honest they were average at it's best. I had the baton while my friend had the marriage. The baton basically tasted like whipped pistachio with a chocolate shell. No flavors really stuck out. My friend described the marriage as those cake rolls with sliced up strawberry and banana, also another dessert that was a let down. Yes, the ambiance is pretty amazing and sitting at the bar watching the open air kitchen is like a show in itself. Other than the desserts, they have everything going for them. I did hear the apple pie was pretty delicious, but unfortunately is no longer on the menu. Price is justifiable for overall experience and quality of desert, but I don't think I'll be coming back considering I can get pastries at a bakery that are better tasting and for cheaper too. I'm just glad to get this sucker off my bookmark list and say I've been here to check out what the hype was all about."

It has the flawlessly sterile cleanliness of a prestigious hospital expertly mixed with the delicate coziness of some passionate cook's home kitchen. More succinctly, i felt like i walked into a murikami short story about what japanese heaven looks like.. And tastes like!\n\nNow, with the scene set (although you will actually have to go yourself to either understand or believe it) i can tell you about the experience...\n\nSo what we did was we opted for the pre fixe menu ($15 dollar two course dessert tasting) which consists of (course 1) a seasonal sorbet which is made with such care and still that it not only seamlessly melts in your mouth, but melts your heart , and (course 2) a dessert of your choice from five options on the menu. \n\nNow i was lucky enough to go with 3 other people so we all got to taste a little bit of everything so i can tell you that you honestly cannot go wrong in what you pick. You will be satisfied. You will be amazed. \n\nSo then, after they give you a tour of the menu (one of which is printed on edible rice paper and served with a fruit puree to dip it in! Yes, Seriously!!), and you order a cup of the peach mo mo tea (which you should), then they proceed to make your desserts fresh, one at a time, right in front of you! It takes longer than at most restaurants, but if you don't have the patience for true craftsmanship, then you probably wouldn't appreciate it anyway. \n\nAnyway i wont ramble on much longer because, as i said, it is not an experience that words can do justice... But i will finish by saying that they have the best bathroom that i have ever had the privilege of using so make sure you take the time to tour it. \n\nSeriously, a 5-star doesn't even seem to come close to describing the outstanding service and experience i received here. \n\nTake the time, enjoy the adventure, and never look at dessert the same way again. And that is a promise."

After sticking my head in the door and asking if this was Sweet Raku, was only then that I was at the right place. Heck, I even took a pic of the giant shiny aluminum spoon to the right of the entrance door so I can remember where they are. What really stands out are the many bottles of different water with ph levels I assume? I forgot to ask them about it but you cant miss it. The place is small, I would say good for about 20 people? \n\nNow for the menu. You get it rolled secured with a bracelet type ring. Your server comes around, pulls the menu out, unrolls it, pours some type of raspberry sauce on your plate, and says you can eat the menu and the holder with dipping it in the sauce as an option. \n\nAt the time of this review, it was a pre set price of 19 dollars for a set appetizer, choice of a main course, and then another set dessert. Our server said you couldn't share unless you added another main course for 12 dollars more. Can we say, ripoff?\n\nSo we went with the Apollo and the Marriage. I would have loved to describe all what we had but I am kind of shocked at the amount of money we had to pay just to have dessert. It was decent but nothing to be excited about.\n\nThe total of our bill came up to 33 dollars and some change. All for just dessert? Our original plan was just to share the already ridiculous price of 19 but was forced to order another main entr\u00e9e for another 12 bucks? Sure the d\u00e9cor and the bathroom was nice but overpriced dessert was definitely not our thing. I don't think we'll be coming back any time soon."

They could do better of explaining what will happen during the experience. I didn't know exactly how things were going to go and I ate most of the edible menu before the sauce came out because no one told me not to eat it. The pastry chefs make all the desserts in front of you, which is really cool. Everything we had was plated beautifully and not your standard looking desserts. All the desserts were very light tasting and not too sweet, which is what I prefer. We all ordered one of the basic tasting menus and tried to order a variety of desserts. This worked out well in that we passed our desserts along to each other across the bar, so that we could all taste everything. I recommend coming with several people that you don't mind sharing with if you want to try a lot of items on the menu otherwise it could get really pricy here. Overall, I don't think Sweets Raku is a place I would frequent on a regular basis because it can get kind of pricy with just two people.

Although it's not that tasty, it still makes for a nice photo op!\n\nOnto other things...\n\nMy boyfriend and I shared the prixe fixe menu. We ordered Mt. Fuji for the main dessert. The first course was some sort of green tea custard, which had a nice light flavor. It was a very small portion, but just right. Second course was the main dessert, Mt. Fuji (chestnut cream cake). It was awesome to watch them make this one. The texture was so soft, hence the \"cream cake\" description. It almost tasted like a tiramisu, but better. It came with a few chips stabbed into it, which was nice for dipping into the outer layer and eating. The third course was a mini lava cake dessert with homemade marshmallows and alcohol infused raisins on the side. It was soo rich and soo good. The perfect ending. \n\nPros: \n-the place is spotless\n-service is great. They are very attentive and even open the door for you on your way out \n-dinner and a show: you get to watch your dessert being made right before your eyes! Of course, most of it is already premade, but you get to see it being put together in a very artistic fashion. \n-the bathroom is incredible!! It's something you have to see for yourself\n-you can share the prixe fixe menu at an extra cost, which I highly suggest (I don't think I could've finished everything on my own)\n-I don't know what kind of milk they use, but its sweet and delicious! \n\nCons:\n-the bathroom door doesn't close all the way unless you give it an extra pull. Someone actually walked in on me. Luckily I was already done with my business!\n-the waitress took my coat, but forgot to give it to me on my way out. I almost forgot about it completely\n\nAll in all, I think this is a great place for dessert, especially if you're trying to go somewhere different with a great ambiance."

I am definitely more of a savory foods person and typically only take a small bite or two of dessert just to try it since I find 95% of desserts too artificial, heavy, sugary/sweet and simply not worth the calories (even on cheat day! I could indulge in a sushi buffet for the calories that are in some desserts! but I digress...)\n\nThis place does dessert right...dare I say, perfect even? Everything we tried was absolutely delicious. You can definitely tell how much care was put into every plate. Everything tasted like it was made from scratch, nothing tasted the least bit artificial and everything was perfectly sweet--just enough and not too much. \n\nI absolutely love the perfect contrast of tarte/sweet in the Strawberry Tiramisu and the last course (not sure what it is called) but it is essentially a little custard filled pastry (you can choose vanilla or chocolate + strawberry, raspberry, or black currant).\n\nFor a 5-star quality three course dessert, $19 per person for the prefixe is not too shabby. Yes, it is a bit of a splurge for dessert but still an amazing value given the quality of the final product, the ingredients and care/precision that go into each plate, and the attentive and friendly service.\n\nI will definitely be back and bring all my friends who visit from out of town! :)"

My friend and I got the Chef's Special and the two course set (Carib and sorbet). I love Japanese desserts because their not too sweet and have a bunch of fruits! The presentation of the desserts were too pretty to eat but made my tummy absolutely happy. Definitely going again and trying something new with wine."

Or you can get the main course dessert for $12, which is what we all did.\n\nThe desserts were wonderful. Very pretty and appealing to the eyes. They were also delicious. I particularly liked how the desserts weren't overly sweet.\n\nThe staff working that night were also very nice and courteous, from seating us to explaining the menu to us. A cherry on top for this wonderful visit.\n\nWill definitely start bringing people here."

To be honest i don't remember what each of them was called. They prepared both in front of us from. It was fun to watch too. \nThe decor was clean and modern. The only catch? There's a $12 minimum order per person. Mine was worth every penny. \nIf you are Vegas, this is a must try. Cheers!"

There are many things I love about food. One is the \"fun\" factor of food. \n\nFast forward to planning our Vegas trip and doing my yelp research. I came across this place and remembered seeing the videos and made it a point to make it here on our trip. \n\nI know that popular places like this can be hectic and that affects the service and experience. Due to this, I read a lot of the reviews and took notes of the little tips. We made sure to come right when it opened at 6 pm. I already knew what we were going to order. Alittle obsessive? Maybe. I like to think of it as good planning.\n\nWe sat at the bar. This was cool because we watched the pastry chefs at work.\n\nWe ordered the Ringo and Primavera. The Primavera had some entertainment factor as the fruit gel is poured over the white chocolate. \n\nThe Ringo was warm had the effect of comfort food. This was a fancy comfort food. The Primavera was very refreshing. It was a bit chilly outside so the Ringo hit the spot. Every and I mean every ingredient tasted fresh. I watched the pastry chefs construct our desserts. They really took their time as each piece was added. The sweets are indeed works of art.\n\nThe girls next to us ordered the Mars. It had a great wow entertainment factor with the blow torch. I had read that it had a strong alcohol taste so I decided not to get that one.\n\nSweets Raku was a restaurant that will stay vivid in my mind. So memorable. I absolutely love places like this. I hope it maintains the quality I experienced!"

I had the souffl\u00e9 (I can't remember the name) with the berry mousse. It was pretty good. As you can see from the photo, mine didn't puff up. It was injected by the server, but basically nothing happened. No big deal. I liked the mango jam part of the dessert the best. My niece had the ringo which we all liked. My son had the Mars. None of us liked it. The desserts were beautiful & it was fun to go to Sweets Raku for a new and different experience. I thought it was expensive ($38 for three desserts) & I don't like the way they list tips at the bottom of the receipt. That's quite presumptive. The service was mediocre.

I loved this. What a break from the typical!\n\nThe waitress in Raku proper hinted that they change up the menu offerings frequently, so don't expect to see the same a few months after this review. \n\nOther pieces that make visiting Sweets Raku pleasing are the environment. The servers are friendly and perky, in a nice way, and greet and say good bye to customers in Japanese. \n\nThere are many \"gems\" within the restaurant awaiting your notice and enjoyment. My favorite is the artwork of planet Earth with illustrated idiosyncrasies of each country. Fun to look at and acknowledge what was called out for each. Raku and Las Vegas are clearly called out on the art! I also loved looking around the kitchen and seeing all of their tools, and collection of All-Clad pots, and utensils. Can you spy the taste-finger spatula??\n\nI won't write about the bathroom too much, but make sure you step in. It's a serendipitous experience in and of itself. \"I think I'm turning Japanese. I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so.\"\n\nThey also offer teas and cocktails. I ventured into a green tea, Tokio, which was very nice and had a sweet aroma.

It was about a 30 minute wait for our party of two.  We were already invested, and decided to hold out...especially if we were going to be seated at the counter.  (This is the place you want to be seated at, by the way.)\n\nThe menu is prix fixe at $19 - you get an Amuse, a Choice of Dessert, and a Petit Four.  You can only share with another person by adding either another entree (Choice of Dessert) or an Amuse and a Petit Four.  We opted for another Choice of Dessert.  An additional $7 if you would like to do a dessert wine pairing.\n\nOne of the things I love is the attention to detail and care.  Even before we were seated, the staff are certain to make sure everything is in place before they will allow you to sit down.  The hostess was bent down on the floor sweeping with a dustpan even!\n\nBesides the obvious water bottle display as soon as you walk through the door, it's actually a wine cellar if you can believe it!  They didn't expect to get their liquor license in time, so they filled it up with the different color labeled bottles of water in the meantime.  But ultimately, it's supposed to be displaying wine. \n\nThe waitress hands us a menu wrapped up in a ring and you can immediately tell there's something different about the menu.  It's edible rice paper and a ring made from pulled sugar.  This isn't your average dessert joint.  They pour raspberry sauce for you to dip your paper in to enjoy, so don't start chomping on the paper just yet.  (We even got a new menu and ring to take home.)  Even the cutlery and water pitcher is something to take notice of.\n\n* Amuse: Mango Sorbet with Mint Jelly - Our first thought about mint jelly was rack of lamb and we were a bit concerned about that.  This was far from the case.  The mint was very subtle and the mango was full of flavor.  A nice way to start our little journey.\n\n* Choice of Dessert: Marriage \"Strawberry & Banana\" - Looking at the little masterpiece in front of you, it's as if have a miniature candy showpiece has appeared.  Delicious white chocolate, flecks of gold, fresh berries, banana cream, strawberry sorbet...it's just pretty and yummy to eat.\n\n* Choice of Dessert: Apollo \"Chocolate & Raspberry Mousse\" - Another showpiece before your eyes, this time with this wonderful Earl Grey ice cream that rests on top (Oh how I wish I could order a huge bowl of that!).  Little accents like the meringue and the chocolate rice cookie squares were among my faves of the dish.\n\n* Petit Four - Chocolate molten cake with marshmallows made from passion fruit and raspberry.  I enjoyed this dessert but this third part was not the favorite of the Husband's.  He really enjoyed the other courses more.\n\nOne of the best parts about sitting at the counter is watching the actual pastry chef up front and center.  Yes, she's one of the young girls working so hard to make every dessert look absolutely beautiful.  She's straight from Japan, having only arrived in the States a couple of months ago and apparently she's been trained by some of the best.\n\nWe asked how often they plan on rotating the menu and ultimately, they said they hope to do every week.  But for now, we'll see.  They also hope to have five entrees to choose from in the Choice of Dessert section.\n\nWe also got a goodie bag with yummy desserts to take home during their opening week, so I got to enjoy Raku all week long at home.\n\nWe're liking Sweets Raku and it'll be one of those places we recommend and take out-of-town guests.  This kind of experience isn't for everyone as it's quite drawn out and there's a reason they ask, \"How was your experience?\".  (Be sure to experience the restroom too!)  If you aren't into desserts, especially ones that take time and detail, this isn't your place.  They get busy in the later evenings but are slow when they first open in the afternoon.  So come early if you don't want to wait since this place only holds about 20+ diners at a time."

I heard about it by word of mouth (recommended by our babysitter, actually!) and decided to try it out while some friends were visiting from out of town.\n\nFirst off, parking was a bit tricky. We were there at roughly 10pm, and the small square's parking lot was FULL. We circled around for a few minutes before spotting someone who was leaving. There is street parking as well.\n\nUpon entering, you line up on the interior side of the entrance, where a floor to ceiling glass wall with wines elegantly displayed separates those waiting from those dining. We were in line waiting behind two other groups, but fortunately our smaller party of three got us seated ahead of one.  \n\nThere are roughly 3-4 tables along the side wall, and the remaining 12 or so seats are all counter - which is probably where you want to be. But I'll digress on that later. The ambiance is very trendy; not necessarily casual, but not elegant either. The counter and most of the prep surfaces are a white marble, with white tiles along the kitchen walls. The menus are already waiting for you, open and ready to explore, even before you sit down at the table/counter. The servers are attentive and professional, and the chefs are just magical with what they do.\n\nNow why the counter? They counter gives you a full view of the kitchen ovens and prep areas, as the chefs create these magnificent and beautiful dessert plates. We watched one chef make candy apples by heating and blowing candy into shape. Another chef was busy scooping ice cream, plating creme puffs, and so much more. The ovens that have your food are right there, so you can watch your blueberry souffl\u00e9 rising right before your eyes!\n\nOf the courses my friends and I shared:\nApple Pie: Beautifully presented. The candy apple was visually stunning and delicious, filled with two types of creme. The puffs were light and airy, and the apple filling, unfortunately, reminded me more of an applesauce than a traditional apple pie filling. \n\nAnother dessert of custard came with a white chocolate dome, which was melted and caved in via a blowtorch-heated cognac poured as soon as it was served. Sadly I forgot the name of it. The alcohol was a delightful 'kick' to the lighter, sweeter custard, and the crunchy bits hidden under the dome, along with the white chocolate, provided a diversity in textures.\n\nPuffy: a mildly standard but wonderfully airy souffl\u00e9, with a beautiful soft blue color, with blueberries hidden beneath. The blueberries were a nice mix of sweet and tart, a good finish to the light, soft flavor of the souffl\u00e9. They inject it with a vanilla creme as it is served, and you watch the souffl\u00e9 rise to accommodate the creme. There was an additional side of mango with jelly, which to me was just insanely delicious, and I could've eaten more of that as a standalone dessert.\n\nOverall, no single dish was overly filling, as it is more an experience in visual appeal as well as flavor and texture. I am excited to return to try the other dishes on the menu. These chefs know what they are doing and their precision and attention to detail are evident in every aspect of each dish."

            "review": "I was torn on how many stars I should be giving to Sweets Raku. In the end, I decided on a 3 star rating.\n\nA total of 4 of us decided to go to Sweets Raku for dessert. I've been dying to try this place and because there were a lot of us that went, we got to try a good portion of their menu! Sweets Raku does a prix fixe menu for $19 and it has a total of 3 courses. The first course and the third course is the same for everyone (kind of) while the second course, you get to choose one from a list of five choices. So let's get started!\n\nMenu: Yes, yes, the menu is edible. When they first bring you the menu, it's rolled up and secured with a ring. The paper is edible and so is the ring. Was it good? The ring was. The menu, itself, was like a sheet of styrofoam almost. There was no taste to it and the texture was not pleasant for me. Of course, later on, they give you some raspberry syrup to dip it in and even then, I still did not like it. The ring, on the other hand, was fine. It's just sugar after all. \n\nFirst course. Amuse. It was a mango sorbet with mint jelly and decorated with a piece of mint. I liked the mango sorbet because it had a strong taste of mango. It tasted like real mango ... with a tinge of tangyness to it. It was refreshing to the senses. \n\nFor the second course, we ordered 4 different types of dessert and was able to share it all.\n\nBaton. Chocolate and pistachio mousse. HOW DO YOU EAT THIS THING? It was a chocolate cake bottom with pistachio mousse wrapped with chocolate wafer and decorated with candy on top. Yeah, can't say that I tasted pistachio in that. I actually didn't remember what it was made out of except for chocolate so pistachio never crossed my mind that night. I think my favorite part of this dessert was the chocolate wafer surrounding it. \n\nMarriage. Strawberry and banana. This dessert, to me, was one of the better ones. It was light and fruity. Can I taste the strawberry? Yes but that's probably because I ate the strawberries. Can I taste the banana? No. I still liked it because it was light and fruity. It wasn't dense or heavy. But it's not great enough to write anything home about. \n\nMt. Fuji. Chestnut cream cake. This was, by far, one of the favorites among everyone. I love chestnut and I love a chestnut dessert done right. However, this may have been a favorite but I feel that there may have been somethings that could've been executed better in this dessert. Compared to the other desserts we had that night, Mt. Fuji ran a flat line for me and it held no range. There was nothing particularly different about it. I could buy a chestnut dessert at Suzuya and it could be potentially better except smaller in size. It would've been better if they had a harder crust like bottom, like they do in fruit tarts. Speaking of the bottom, the bottom of this dessert was odd. Half of the bottom was cake and the other half was something else -- I forgot. I would be eating one side, talking bout how good the chestnut bits were and my friend, who was on the other side, would look at me like, \"Where are you finding this?\" In the end...good, but can be better. \n\nRingo. Apple pie. This dish is very interesting because they have a piece of apple pie on one side. Then next to it is an apple shaped candy with cream filling. Then next to the apple is a honey ice cream. If the apple pie was replaced by something else, this particular dessert would've won it all for me. However, I'm not an apple pie person and I understand that apple pie fits the theme to this dish. The candy apple and honey ice cream was great. The sweetness of the candy mixes well with the cream inside of it. The honey ice cream was not too sweet. It had a hint of sweetness but it goes so well with anything and everything. \n\nNow the third course is a petite four. It's typically a lava cake but if you had ordered the Baton, you get a cheesecake instead. The lava cake is decorated by fruity marshmallows and alcoholic raisins. Funny thing .. my friend tried the raisin and said it was good so I popped one in my mouth. Hilarity ensues. My face scrunches up and I automatically look for a napkin to spit in. No, just no and WHY? The lava cake is ... a lava cake. You know, when it comes to Japanese made desserts, I expect it to be light and fluffy. Nope, not the case. The lava cake was dense and so very rich in chocolate. No go for me. \n\nNow the cheesecake version..it was decorated by pieces of grapefruit, which I'm VERY thankful for. I like grapefruit and I know they did not soak it in alcohol first. The cheesecake? Dense and heavy. It was like eating a block of cheese -- no joke.\n\nWas it a good experience? Indeed it was. This is the first time I've done a prix fixe menu for DESSERTS. Did I have a good time? Absolutely. My friends were there with me every step of the way. Would I go to Sweets Raku again? Most likely not. I absolutely cannot justify the price tag of $19 for 3 desserts that I didn't fall in love with. I don't even miss it."

            "review": "Saw a video for this place online and I couldn't wait to go try it out! This place is amazing and definitely good to experience at least once! The wait is definitely long to get in because the restaurant is pretty small. It's mostly bar seating with a few small tables. I definitely recommend getting bar seating because that's where you can see all the desserts being made, which is the best part! Overall, we waited about 45 minutes (an extra 15 min because we wanted to wait for a seat at the bar and not sit at the table).\n\nThe desserts are super unique! We got the Ringo and the primavera and made each one a combo. The combo is $15 with your choice of a main dessert (ringo, primavera, etc.) and sorbet. The sorbet was mango with mint toppings on the day that we went. It was really good and fresh. The primavera is somewhat like a parfait with tons of layers of creams, cake, and toppings. When they present it to you, they cover the cup with a wafer of chocolate and they pour a cream sauce on top and it makes a nice visual display as the chocolate melts into the cup. You can definitely taste the richness in all the flavors and it was more tart than too sweet. My absolute favorite though was the ringo. This dessert consists of a flaky croissant topped with an apple pie filling, honey ice cream on the side, and a candy apple that's filled with cream and caramel sauce. It was amazing!!!! The pasty was fluffy and warm and so good. All of the elements melded well together so that the dessert wasn't overly sweet and overpowering. We also got the apple tea which wasn't sweet, so it helped balance out all the flavors.\n\nDefinitely worth the wait!"

I asked for the apple pie to go with the sorbet and molten lava cake. While everything was good, I find the items to be rather typical dessert items that one can get in a bakery anywhere. The three-spoonful sorbet was good but really, it's just sorbet. Nice and unique take on the apple pie, that I have to give it to Sweets Raku. Finally, the molten chocolate cupcake, really? I can make that at home using my microwave in less than 5 minutes. How disappointing. \n\nJust a note on the utensils: I know the knife and fork look very eclectic but they definitely were not easy to use. I could barely cut my apple pie with the knife and the fork was so awkward to handle I think it gave me finger cramps. \n\nAs for the service, the waitress serving us had such a strong accent I could barely make out what she said. She was really sweet and nice but if I couldn't understand what the heck she was saying. \n\n At $27 including tips, this was a \"meh\" experience. \n\nOne time was enough. I'm not planning on coming back."

Honestly, any dessert place on the strip will knock this place out of the map when it came to taste.  The funniest thing is that almost every review of this place only talks about how the desserts look and how they are prepared, barely any of the review tells you how the food actually TASTES.  And if you're going to put ANY sort of food in your mouth, TASTE is pretty damn important. (DUH!)\n\nThe GOOD:\nThe ambiance and the posh-ness of the whole place (very IKEA-ish). I think the BATHROOM takes the cake for me (pun intended).  It was the most exciting part of the whole thing. AND the preparation/presentation of the food was pretty cool.  \n\nTHE BAD:\nAll smokes and mirrors in this place.  When it came to taste, it wasn't even up to par with basic desserts you can make yourself.  HONESTLY, the only thing this place has going for it, is that THEY MAKE THE FOOD LOOK GOOD. So, if you want to impress your friends on Instragram or Pintrest or your social medias, by all means, $25 + tip is not too much, I guess.  But if you want to satisfy your cravings for sweets and dessert, THIS PLACE IS NOT IT.  \n\nETC:\nThe flavor, texture and the complex of their menu items is very bland and I felt like I was eating a bunch of flavored fondant, except they left out the sweetness and delectable aspects of a dessert. There's no comfort in it.  No warmth in the dessert.  It was just plain and simple, OKAY."

I decided to try Raku Sweets with my parents while my brother hung out with his team. \n\nFirst of all, it's a really lowkey place off the strip in the middle of Chinatown. There's a private lot, so finding parking is easy. Walking in, there's a ceiling to floor wine display. After going around it, I saw very few seating, maybe 20 spots. We sat at the counter to watch the pastry chefs assemble the dessert. \n\nI thought they had an edible menu, but we received a regular menu. Water was served immediately on a red, rubber, lego coaster. I ordered the $15 dessert set which came with a mushed Jell-O shot/cream/sorbet starter (I don't remember the French names) and one main dessert (I ordered the soleil. The starter was perfect - sorbet was tart, cream was smooth and subtle, and the jello was fun! The Soleil was beautiful! Watching them assemble it was an experience. It was filled with Mascarpone and sorbet, outer gelato shaped like an apple, and complete with sugar stem and leaf with a flower and raspberry decorations. \n\nMy parents ordered a cappuccino (which came with rock candy), chefs choice (chocolate truffle, macaron with sorbet filling, and a strawberry tart), and wine flight (2 reds 1 white, served with cheese). \n\nOverall, the experience was amazing and almost visited the next day. Definitely a must every time we stop by in Vegas! Bill was about $40"

If $20-ish for a three course dessert meal doesn't make your wallet/purse cry, then you should definitely go and have an enjoyable time.\n\nOn the other hand. If you've experienced other high concept \"dessert bars\" like Chickalicious in New York (let's not kid anyone, Sweets is nearly a direct emulation of Chickalicious down to the amuse bouche and the white walls) then you might find yourself a bit underwhelmed at the end like me.\n\nBut all in all, Sweets is a fantastic addition to our town's growing oeuvre of culinary experiences.

Sadly, this was as disappointing as going to see Phantom of the Opera to find out that Crawford and Brightman are ill, and their stand-ins are Willie Nelson and Roseanne Barr.\n\nThis place is in a strip mall with a glass front that shows the wine selection.  Behind the wine selection are uncomfortable chairs at the tables and very uncomfortable stools at the countertop.  Sterile white walls and floors do their best to un-impress as you wait in a long line for one of 24 seats in the entire place.  Despite it's undeserved popularity, they have not expanded, so you will wait for about 40 minutes if you're lucky.\n\nLet's get to the dessert - which is their \"specialty\".  We had the Mars, their most popular dessert, which involves lighting on fi-- wait, no we didn't, they ran out on Friday night.  I meant to say we ordered the Ringo, which was a mock apple pie.  The apple pie is in a puff pastry of sorts, with forgettable ice cream and an edible ornament fallen off your Christmas tree that is shiny and stuffed with whipped cream and a hint of caramel.  For $12, I'd recommend you buy 2 Costco pies.\n\nThen we had a $12 parfait that they pour sauce into, and that's supposed to be amazing or something.  It wasn't - it was no better than McDonald's parfait.\n\nThen they ran out of the Ringo, too, arguably a runner up to the Mars plate - remember, this was a Friday night when they should have expected to be busy.  If you study the staff, you'd quickly see that nobody appears to have worked in a restaurant before.  They are not sure when to seat guests, when to wipe down tables, when to run credit cards, how to serve everyone in the party at the same time, though they are genuinely sweet (even if their desserts are not).\n\nIt's a novelty - it's so shameful that they had a good idea once and didn't expand on it, didn't develop themselves as a company.  This fad will die if they don't figure out how the food industry works - mediocrity kills business.  $12 desserts need to be amazing, and these are not.\n\nSweets Raku - overblown, just like their souffl\u00e9."

The flavor was super strong with a hint of sourness. \n-Jack in a cup-a chocolate souffle with a choice of vanilla or chocolate creme filling which is injected in front of you using a cool pipe-looking gadget and a half ring of nuts, fruity marshmallow squares, and popcorn I believe? This specific dessert was a little too sweet/rich for my liking so I only ate half..\n-cream puff- crispy puff with a light semi-sweet raspberry filling.\n\nFrom the a la carte menu $12 we ordered:\n-Stella ( strawberry tiramisu)- probably the most beautiful presentation of all with a small strip of fresh fruits and light airy cream but I didn't try the actual bread portion.\n-carib? MY FAVORITE! A wine glass filled with kiwi, banana, pudding, then topped with a thin lid which is melted as hot fruit puree is poured on top creating a cascading effect.\n\nAll in all it was well worth the wait and a unique experience, but the desserts are slightly overrated.

The place is expensive & you hate to let go even a drop. So if you have diabetes avoid. I loved their place desert were good. But the only issue I had was with their policy where 12$ per person was ridiculous. I would have appreciated if they would have let go their policy as I had to throw 3 out of 4 deserts  as we were family of 4 & my mom & dad are old enough to not have it full dishes & they forced us to get desserts for all of us. I tried to eat a lot but wasn't able to finish so was upset. Be ready to wait for at least 1hr on weekday if you're reaching the place around  & after 7pm."

Customer service is great, the menus are edible, and the food is tasty. The treats weren't something I'd obsess about (too much confectionary sugar for me), which is why I'm giving it four stars instead of five.

The place is very tiny, with very few seats, so be prepared to wait during weekday nights and weekends. We opted to share the $20 3 course menu and sit at the bar to watch the ladies prepare the desserts. I'm a huge fan of open kitchens and I do want to mention how white and clean this whole restaurant is.\n\nWe got our 3 courses and the presentation is very beautiful, the combination is very creative, but the taste leaves more to be desired. The syrups used were not very tasty unfortunately. Service was also a bit lacking, and we felt like it was cafeteria style instead of a restaurant dining experience. \n\nParking was ok as that's a very busy plaza with Monta Ramen, Raku and a few other restaurants."

I was going to be in vegas for the weekend so what better time to stop by then now. \n\nI arrived about 9 something and it was about a 15 minutes wait. There are counter seating and a couple of tables. I bet they can only hold about 15 people at a time. \n\nIts a min. charge of $12 per person. I decided to go with the mango sorbet and the Carib. I could have passed on the mango but the flavors were there. I'm just not a huge fan of sorbet. I totally love the Carib. I love watching them pour the warm mango sauce over the white chocolate and watching it melt into my large wine glass. The flavors blended all together was nice. I couldn't taste the coconut in the panna cotta but I couldn't care less. The dessert was awesome. Taste and presentation was great. \n\nMy hubby decided to go with the sunset. This thing has lots of alcohol in it. We did not know cause the waitress didn't advise us so. We were not able to eat or enjoy this. What a shame!  \n\nI thought the service was okay, I was disappointed that they didn't offer us another dessert cause we couldn't even eat the sunset. We basically let the sunset go to waste.

I honestly didn't know what to expect but once my wife and I got in, she turned back to me and asked, \"Did we need reservations?\" This restaurant is set up much like kitchen with a bar top with some seating on the side. Overall the place probably can hold up to 24ish people. What's nice is that everything is very clean, and after being seated with a menu, we found that the menu is actually pretty simple. You either choose the lunch sets, Desert set($15 is what It costed me), or a main desert. A couple of things to note is that each person must order at least one Main category desert(I mean, why would you come here without trying a main desert anyhow??), and because the chef's make the food from scratch in front of you, it can easily take up to an hour and a half, if not longer before you're all done. \n\nWith all of that said, I tried the Desert Set that included a Mango sorbet with mint jelly(Really good!), and for the main desert course I choose the Puffy Cup, which is a raspberry and blueberry souffle with a vanilla cream interior, and Mango compote on the side. Having already been so impressed by watching the chef make everything, I was equally impressed by how it tasted. It was Creamy, slightly tart, and semi sweet. Who knew a raspberry/blueberry souffle would pair so well with a Mango compote? The warmth of the souffle paired really well with the chilled compote. \n\nOverall the service here was excellent, the chef's presentation was awesome, and the food was great! I couldn't recommend this place more. Every time I come back this way, I'm going to make sure I come here as there is so much more that I want to explore of the menu and drinks! Check it out!"

We were greeted and asked where we wanted to sit, luckily there was space available at the bar.  We were given an edible menu (yes you can eat it)  and they explained each item to us.  Feeling so excited, we ended up ordering three desserts, the Baton, Carib, and the Prix Fixe which is a three course dessert.  \n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=EfRR0roMzcmZXBbrFq-CnA&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=5W8EOgIJ9QwJl71FpIpRIA&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uCVui7v4YDS-rzsyZ-YIHA&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n::Desserts::\nI will start with the Baton, inside the Baton is cream, chocolate and pistachio mousse.  The Baton is delicate, thin, and made of a crispy chocolate shell.  \n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-YsHlb8L_0ez5xWgWCaIw&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\nNext is the Carib, it is served in a glass wine and presented to you when the Chef completes the masterpiece.  The wine glass is covered with a wafer, then they pour warm mango puree  on top, the warm puree melts and seeps through the wafer; it looked like a waterfall going into the wine glass.  Inside the wine glass is a mixture of coconut cream, chocolate cream, white chocolate, kiwi, mango, banana, and a cinnamon crisp stick. \n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=DutwK9Ln7A2lV21YjJsbyw&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LqxQem1fFB9OrKY5sotB1A&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\nNow for the Prix Fixe (additional $7 for a glass of paring wine), as I mentioned it is a three course dessert.  From the list of desserts, I got to choose one; I picked the Stella (Strawberry Tiramisu). First we got the Amuse which is pineapple sorbet with white jelly on top.  Next the Strawberry Tiramisu was ready.  It had slices of strawberries and served with Raspberry Sorbet.  The plate was beautifully decorated with grapes, pineapple, gooseberry and blueberry.  Then we got the Petit Four which is a cream puff.  For the filling I picked Chocolate, they also have Strawberry and Raspberry.  The cream puff was freshly made, served with raspberry and passion fruit marshmallow.  \n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LuQ4eozQ3HJp5jUyUlRaNQ&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vdikfRXyilemKirBeMDA3g&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=49jHwD5FA5zbGUxTi-e3uA&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n::Highlight::\nI fell in love with this place, I will definitely be back!!

Each course was appetizing and presented elegantly.  This place is unique and the desserts they serve I haven't seen anywhere else.  I won't forget the edible menu, it is rolled and inserted into a gold ring that you can also eat.  The menu has no flavor (I think it taste like rice paper) but they give you a raspberry sauce to dip it in and the gold ring taste like lightly sweetened candy. The table setting is creative and there is also a big button under the table so the ladies can hang their purse. Before leaving make sure to use the restroom.  You will walk into a futuristic and clean restroom with cool gadgets! \n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=V4RMKSUp6V7nmAUyMwNiSA&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n::Customer Service::\nWonderful, friendly and attentive.

First off, come early as this is a tiny place with limited seating. I don't believe they take reservations but I could be wrong about that. I came here with a few friends, and everyone that sits must order something. This worked out perfectly for us since there were 5 of us and 5 desserts on the menu. We also ordered their cheese platter, very tasty cheese! \n\nEach one of the dessert was amazing, minus one. I didn't care for the red ball one because to melt the red ball thing they pour alcohol that's on fire on top of it and it makes the dessert so saturated with alcohol that it ruins the taste for me. But everything else...wow! Each dessert basically came with a show of melting something, which made it all the more fun! \n\nThere's only one pastry chef and she won best pastry chef, last year I think. She makes everything right there as soon as you order it. If you're lucky enough to snag a bar seat you can watch her make everything. \n\nIf you're in Vegas, I highly recommend trying to come by this place. Even if you have to wait an hour, it's totally worth it. Next time I'm in town I'm coming back. Seems like their menu is seasonal so always something new to make me drool!"

It's awesome to watch them put the different desserts together. \n\nThere's a prix fixe three course dessert set which is presented on a rice paper menu with Raspberry dipping sauce. I've eaten it on 2 separate occasions. The first course is a sorbet. the most recent time I went it was pineapple sorbet. The pineapple sorbet was so good and refreshing and I don't even really like pineapple. The main course is a choice of about 4 different desserts. I've had the strawberry tiramisu and the \"Mt.

Instead of giving you three full pieces of raspberries, they cut it in half so you get three half pieces of raspberries.  Really? \n\nThe foie gras, instead of full pieces as shown in the menu and how it was served before as you can see from other Yelper pics, they also give you half pieces.  I should've known by then and take caution with this place but I didn't learn my lesson until this time.\n\nThis time I ordered the caviar ($30 for 10g).  It came tin unsealed, caviar was loosely packed with a thin layer that seems like they have took out some instead of it densely packed like how a tin or jar of caviar should be packed.  You can even compare my pic with other Yelper pic how it was much fuller in the past than mine.\n\nQuality totally gone down as I saw the baker put together the dessert quite sloppily and fed no passion.  Huge contrast from the first couple times I went.  The wait time for the caviar was long perhaps they need to bake the puff pastries.  \n\nIt's the little thing that some customers pay attention to that the eateries often think the customers pay no notice to.  Unfortunately I am one of those customers who pays attention on details."

The desserts are delicious to both eyes and tongue. The layers and attention to detail is wonderfully executed. Right down to the utensils. The whole experience of Sweets Raku embodies everything Japanese but does not overwhelm the visitor. And just as a quirk, the bathroom has a bidet. The proprietors of Sweets Raku are bold and inviting. I can't wait to visit and experience it all over again."

This could have been easily a 4.5 star review, but the restaurant policy turned me off.\n\nOne of my friends that dined with us was full from dinner and did not wish to have any desserts.  She ordered a glass of wine and declined to order anything else.  We were then told that the restaurant REQUIRES the patron to order a dessert.  She was then practically forced to order something (a cheese plate) in order for her to stay, even though she physically could not eat anything more.  It was not like she didn't order anything.  A glass of wine (equivalent of a 1.5 shot) for $10 a glass isn't cheap.\n\nThe tea was too strong, over steeped or too much tea leaves.  I've never had Jasmine tea that literally overpowered my taste buds.\n\nIn any case, I will not be returning there.  I will definitely not be recommending anyone to this restaurant."

Here's the deal- it is very impressive, I sat at the bar and ooo'd and aaaah'd while desserts were crafted in front of me. They are ridiculously beautiful. Service was great. The bathrooms - fantastic! (they have a remote control toilet, you hear me! remote control, with warming on the seat.... fantastic). The flavor of the dessert? Really not that exciting, especially for the price. I went with a friend. We split the sorbet, it was alright, nothing special, but not bad. On the recommendation of the waitress, I got the coconut mango flan thing that's served in a glass with a piece of chocolate on top that they melt with hot mango sauce in front of you... so pretty... so mediocre in flavor. Just somewhat bland tropical flavors with mostly mushy texture and a little bit of pie crust or something inside (which was the best part). Did I eat it.... well, was it over 10$... you know I did. Anyway, my friend got the apple strudel thing. Also so beautiful, they have a hollow apple made of candy that they fill with caramel and whipped cream... so cool. The flavor was better than mine, but still not blowing me away. We also split a chocolate cream puff.... still nothing special. Maybe this is because I prefer a richer dessert, but you would think that one of the items would be a huge stand out when you order such a variety. Anyway, it isn't bad, but for the price, I probably wouldn't go back."

Very clean and elegant in white interior. However, it is quite small so be prepared to get here at their opening time. I recommend sitting at the bar if you want full view of the action. \n\nThe location: it is located in the same plaza as the restaurant called Raku, so look for the one that is closer to the street with a SILVER SPOON in front. \n\nThe solely is no longer available. They have updated their recipe on the Caribbean (raspberry sorbet, chocolate cream, and chocolate hot sauce). Also, there is no edible menus anymore.\n\nOverall, yummy!"

I chose the prix fixe 3 course dessert menu along with a pot of peach tea.  I sat at the bar because I wanted to see the pastry chefs doing their thing up close.\n\nFor the three course prix fixe, you only have 1 choice--the second dessert.  The first, the amuse, and the last, the petit four, are fixed depending on the day and season.  For the first course last night, the amuse was an oval of mango sorbet with blue ice as Yuka, my server, described it to me.  It was mint jelly on the mango sorbet and it made a good pairing of flavors.\n\nCourse two I chose.  I had read the Yelp reviews and I was sure I'd go with the Mt. Fuji.  Yuka told me the Ringo (apple pie) was made that day and was excellent.  I finally decided on the Baton which was a tall thin chocolate mini-tower with chocolate and pistachio mousse and some fresh mango cubes.  It was excellent.  It was a little tricky to eat because I tried to peel a piece of the very thin chocolate tower to dip in the mousse but the tower is so fragile, it sometimes breaks away.  Regardless, it was tasty and lots of fun.\n\nCourse three, the petit four, was a delicious parmesan cheesecake with tangerine pieces.  The cheesecake was excellent.\n\nNone of the desserts was sweet which was very appealing.  It's not that I don't like sweet--it's just that it isn't needed in every dessert.  \n\nService was excellent!  Yuka was a gem. We did have a bit of a language problem but then I don't speak Japanese and she speaks English.  Do yourself and sit at the bar and watch the ladies work magic with preparing these delightful pastries!  \n\nFor those of you still trying to find the place when you arrive at the plaza, it's just south of Big Wong Restaurant.  Look for the wine rack through the glass windows.  At night, you won't see the spoon hanging outside."

What bother me was that there was no bench or seating while you're waiting in line at the entrance corridor, so everyone was standing the whole time.  \n\nOtherwise the dessert was perfect, we order a Spring Mountain, and Mars.  The Mars was presented by a heated brandy poured over slowly on top melting the chocalate, very pretty to look at.  It was very creamy and tasty.  The spring mountain is made of pistacio nut and it was exactly as it should taste.  Desserts do not come cheap, as a single order is $12 and a set is $15.  This is for the girls, as guys can probably finish these desserts in 2 bites.  When you're in Vegas and have some time to wait around, then it's not a bad choice."

The place is clean, ultra modern, and the people who work there were just bending over backwards to make us happy.

OMG I love you, lady.  \n\nWe sat at the bar and ordered our desserts and they brought out place settings, water, and the most adorable little plastic set of dishes, cups, and utensils for my toddler.  How incredibly thoughtful!  \n\nThe $12 angel cream is so pretty with it's sugared dome exterior, edible white chocolate angel wings, and pulled sugar \"halo\".  I was initially a bit scared by the description \"fromage mousse and pear mousse\" (CHEESE MOUSSE? EWW) but the dessert was light and melted in my mouth.  The bottom part of the dessert is like a soft cookie crumble.  The details on this thing are mind-boggling!  I loved this beautiful, intricate dessert. \n\nThe $12 Ringo is a crisp apple pie and ice cream with whipped cream filled apple candy on the side.  Besides being absolutely gorgeous it was very tasty.  The pastry shell and apples were nice and warm and the ice cream was rich and decadent.  The cream-filled candy apple is a show-stopper and tastes exactly like creme brulee.  I loved it.  \n\nThe service is impeccable.  The desserts are typical bland asian fancy desserts.

It is a very unique visual presentation but unnecessary to finish. Listed on the menu is a prix-fixe three course menu. My friend split the three course with mango sorbet, Mount Fiji, and cream puff. \n\nOur first course was the mango sorbet which arrived in a scoop with a generous strip of mint jelly down the middle. Any mango lovers would enjoy this smooth sorbet with a blatant and tangy flavor. Mount Fiji was a chestnut cream cake with thin slices of chocolate wafer pieces. The flavors were delightfully light but I'm generally not a fan of heavily-creamed desserts. Our last course was the chocolate cream puff with vanilla custard and a side of strawberry and mango jelly. The tangy jelly pieces was a good contradiction of the sweet cream puff which was freshly baked. \n\nWe were so pleased with the above that we even added another dessert, the Stella. It was a strawberry tiramisu with seasonal raspberry sorbet. Rather than being a typical tiramisu sprinkled with coffee powder and flavored with cocoa, it was done so with strawberry and a much lighter mascarpone cheese. It was beautifully formed like a flower.   \n\nWith dessert made fresh before our eyes, a $19 prix-fixe three course dessert menu is definitely my thing!"

At this point, they're both handcuffed to each other whenever I come to visit.\n\nAs usual, I visited Sweets Raku after having another wonderful dinner at Raku.  Because I was somewhat stuffed from my dinner at Raku beforehand, I chose not to go with the Sweets Raku's 2-course menu and just went a la carte to have one main dessert.

I don't know if I can separate Raku and Sweets Raku, but if I ever do in the future, at least I know that Sweets Raku can always be a reliable dessert option after eating at any of those spots nearby."

The Rosa Regale ($7) was pretty light handed...I've had this wine many times, just WISH there was more in my glass @ $7.\n\nFirst of all, Cool presentation with the menu...all edible!  The \"paper\" itself and the holder are all edible lol.\n\nStarted off with the Strawberry Sorbet and Mint Jelly...simple and clean taste. Definitely a palate cleanser...good overall.\n\nThe Apollo: Chocolate and Raspberry Mousse, Raspberries and Earl Grey Tea Ice Cream. Yummy flavors and cool presentation.   Really liked the mousse and ice cream combination.\n\nMarriage: Strawberry mousse and banana custard hiding inside the sponge cake, fresh berries, white chocolate garnish with gold leaf and sugar decorations. I thought this dish was the best out of the bunch, with the light fluffy sponge cake and custard combination.\n\nAnd to finish, the Petit Four: Chocolate Lava Cake with Flavored Marshmallows. This was good as well...you can smell these as soon as you walk inside! LOL.\n\nSo overall, it is a little spendy for dessert, but if you sit back and look at the presentation and the love put into the food combinations and flavors, it's money well spent every few months or so.\n\nPics!  :"

I've been wanting to bring my sister & sister in law here for awhile and finally got the chance to do so. Since life is too short not to eat dessert first, we started our girl's night out with a trip to the big silver spoon.\n\nWe sat at the bar and all ordered prixe fixes for the full experience. We had the mango sorbet with mint jelly amuse & chose the following for our desserts: Jack in the cup, Carib & the Mt. Exotic. I'm not going to go into great detail & describe each and every dessert as it will just sound redundant, regurgitating previous reviews. Bottom line, each is an epitome of perfectly created dessert with surprising fusion of tastes & textures that caters to the most scrutinizing palate and borders as art. \n\nSo, why lacking a star? After telling my girls about this place & going on & on about everything that makes this place unique, we did not get the edible menus! I was so busy playing hostess/tour guide that such important highlight escaped me. I don't know if they stop doing this or if our server simply forgot, I think it's a paramount aspect of the Sweet Raku experience."

It has fruits such as raspberries and yuzu covered in chocolate. The chefs light up Hennessy (alcohol) and pour it on, so you'll get a little bitter taste, but it's good! The 2nd item was a coffee sorbet, so flavorful and had coffee jelly.\n\nMy gf ordered the Primavera, which was coconut Panna cotta, with fruits and raspberry raspberry sorbet.

I ordered the two-course menu, which came with the sorbet of the day and one \"main\" dessert.\n\nThe sorbet was a refreshing raspberry flavored one with yogurt on top. I love that Asian desserts in general are not too sweet and this one had a good amount of tartness.\n\nAll of the main desserts looked interesting and I decided to order Mars, which is an orb that is then flambed with brandy. The presentation was cool but I have to give it 4 stars because I did not like the taste of this dessert. The brandy pooled at the bottom of the plate and the flavor of hard alcohol was so strong, I had a hard time eating it. Perhaps my experience would've been better if I had tried a different dessert.\n\nIf you do not love brandy, then skip Mars."

Because it's an experience you won't forget.\n\nFrom the moment you walk into this stark white establishment with cool decor to watching the pastry chefs prepare your 3 course dessert menu (if you don't go a la carte) to using their funky bathroom, this place is just very unique. I can't compare it to any other place.\n\nI got the pre fixe menu ($19) which comes with AN EDIBLE MENU that you dip into a raspberry sauce, an amuse and petit fours for just $7 more than getting is a la carte. I picked the Mt. Fuji chestnut cream cake because I was so mesmerized by the way the chefs were making it. It looked like ice cream spaghetti. But it was cream...which was good, but it definitely would have been better if it was ice cream.\n\nMy husband chose the Baton which had chocolate and pistachio mousse over a chocolate sponge cake and red wine sauce. The outside was made out of a thin chocolate layer. It was beautiful, really hard to eat, toppled over, and attacked. Taste wise, I thought it was better than the Mt. Fuji.\n\nThe Sorbet amuse was a good palate cleanser but the cream puff petit four was seriously so amazing. The cream puffs were heaven. I barely took a pic of it before it disappeared into my mouth.\n\nOf course out of all these things, the most impressive was the edible menu. As soon as they present it to you, you know you're in for a nice treat for the rest of the dessert experience. Could it all have tasted better? Yes. But because it was a unique experience that just makes people happy, I think it deserves 5 stars. I dare you to bring a sour puss in here and see if he/she doesn't come out with a smile on his/her face."

Specializing in tantalizing desserts, Raku Sweets offers various pies, parfaits, and sundaes with flair. We sampled a few items including the strawberry parfait with a searing pour of topping to crack the top layer of the glass, the chocolate cake with hot run poured into the center, and a deli table apple pie presentation with an sugar apple cone. I thoroughly enjoyed the apple pie the best because the crust melted in your mouth and I thought the plate was absolutely beautiful to put it over the top. But none of the desserts disappointed. A few more options were in the menu as well and I believe they rotate and have some sample tasting menus with presumably smaller portions. Alcohol is also available at this great restaurant. 5 stars for sure."

Firstly the desserts even though they look great with immaculate presentation does not taste as good as it looks! They taste ok, nothing out of this world! I seriously think this is a hype and will blow over once the wind shifts on to the next big thing.  Secondly, because they are so popular now they can't care less about customer service AT ALL! They WILL NOT, ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT seat you unless you are the very next one in line. We were a party of three and there were 4 parties of two's behind us. They had a seat for 2 at the bar open for 40 minutes(!!!!) but because we were a party of 3 and could not sit there they did not even ask the other  couples behind us!!!! Two of the couple left after waiting for almost an hour and I finally had to tell the server that it was ok to let the couple behind us to go ahead and sit at the two open spots! She looked confused but when I kept telling her that the two chairs has been empty for 40 minutes and the couple behind us should be allowed to sit before us she finally nodded and let them have the seats! It was like as if I solved the most complicated calculus equation and she just could not get it!!!!!! What a stupid policy! But I guess they are doing such good business they don't care to accommodate as many clients as quickly as they can. It's a very very small place and people just \"hang out\" even after they've finished eating delicately and leisurely sipping their wine or coffee or tea even though they see the line of people waiting for so long. So all in all the desserts aren't that outta this world for me to put my husband and my son through this torture. I will wait till they're not the IT place anymore and then  they actually care about client retention to come back here again. Because for now it's their way or the highway and no matter how sweet their desserts are you leave with a bitter feeling in your mouth and for 70$ for the 3 of us I just don't think that was worth it!"

After looking over the menu, decided on \"pre fixe\", since one of my dining mates recommended it.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great presentation of the desserts; so 'artsy'!\n- Clean, almost sterile appearance\n- Clean restroom with a toilet that has a proximity sensor (opens automatically)\n- Friendly, smiling staff\n\nCons:\n\n- the price: $40+ , (gratuity is automatically tacked on), for dessert for 2 people (no drinks) - WHAT??? Ok, I see gold flake in some of the desserts that were served to us. Does that make it worth it? Well, It looked nice, but I was still hungry when I left. I don't remember anything particularly special about it. Plus my wallet was a little lighter.\n- Ok, restroom was clean, but it took me a few seconds to figure out which object was the sink. It looked like a barrel of some sort.\n- I could barely understand what the server was saying (see below). Perhaps they should use pictures?\n- It kind of feels like you're in Japan... in a bad way, which means, it is small and cramped, and feels over-crowded.\n- Get a sign, for Christ's sake! I know the giant spoon in the front is a visual cue, but how many people know to look for that, and how visible is that from the street? It's like going to a rave in an undisclosed location. You won't know that you're there unless you ask one of the other people waiting in line to get in.\n- If you are lactose intolerant, cross this place off your list. It seems like everything made here is made from milk.\n\nSummary (IMHO):\n\nBang for the buck?? Nope. Not here. Not to me at least. Hey, that's great that they can get away with charging almost $20, for something that I can probably figure out how to make at home for less than $10 and still have second or third servings. I don't think i'll be coming back here - unless somebody else insists on footing the bill."

It's a Japanese restaurant, all I can say is excellent. \n-service: they were very nice, polite, and professional in providing excellent customer service, far away better than those 2 stars Michellin restaurant in Santa Monica. They served you with their recommendations, smiles which could definitely earn your customers come back. \n-desserts: we ordered their signature dessert which is called Mars, which was covered with white chocolate, then they melt it into fire. We felt the smooth and richness of the white chocolate, it was so good that I wanna keep it in my mouth as much as I can, I didn't wanna swallow it. It can be rated more than 5 stars. Then we had another one is looked like the angle, the appearance already earn more than 5 stars, it's not making you feel heavy on that. The concept and combinations of the dessert was perfect. The last pieces were the chocolate that they special made, there was some alcohol inside the caramel, hmmm, you will enjoy it so much, and the lady gave us 2 pieces of almond chocolate as an extra, it's also tasted really good.\n-drinks: we have the all you can drink sangria, we tried the red one first, it slowly made me feel buzzed. Then they gave me the white one after we finished the first one. The white one was so refreshing and it's sweeter than the red one, but it's good. \n We will definitely come back for the other dessert on the menu next time when we are here. I highly recommend this one."

Actually I was looking for Raku on Yelp to see what I should get this last time, and came across the high ratings for Sweets Raku.  Boy oh boy were we NOT disappointed.\n\nAfter a huge-a** dinner, we came to Sweets Raku and got in line.  It was rather quick to get seated if you didn't want to sit at the bar.  A lot of people like sitting at the bar so that they can see the chef make their desserts, kind of magical and good if you come with kids, or are a big kid yourself.\n\nWe went with the pre-fixe even though we were full as hell from dinner, because we were like eff it, diet in the new year!  \n\nLet me just say, I have never had a panna cotta like this one.  Every morsel, every bite, everything was awesome.  You will close your eyes and see unicorns and rainbows.  \n\nThe hubs got the strawberry tiramisu which I was thinking at the time didn't sound that enticing and I thought he was making a huge mistake...but alas it was also very delicious.  \n\nThe cream puffs at the end, I will admit, I also thought would be just another standard cream puff like bear papas .. nope!  Dat flavor.  Perfect amount of melt in your mouth, cream was less thick and didn't feel gross as some cream puffs can make you feel.\n\nIf you are in the area, stop by.  It is delightful.  It is a Japanese dessert place, so expect light flavors and light sugar (i.e. if you regularly eat American sweets and don't think sodas are too sugary... you may not like this place!)"

With fruit and other custard underneath - poured with flames Hennessy over it), and lastly primavera (coconut sorbet with raspberry jelly, gelatin, chocolate- hot Rasberry poured over).\n\nEverything looked beautiful and had great detail - the taste wasn't anything spectacular.

I ordered the baton which was a new experience to me pistachio cream with a chocolate and fruit base all wrapped in a light delicate cookie.

The attention to detail is amazing as well as the great customer service that is provided the moment you step through the door. Seating is very limited so it would be best to come in a small group. We had 6 people in our group and luckily were able to be seated at the bar after about a 20-minute wait. I highly recommend sitting at the bar to see the desserts being prepared! \n\nThe Sweets Raku Dessert Set is a two-course dessert for $15. It includes a seasonal sorbet followed by your choice of one of the five main desserts.\n \nSeasonal sorbet- Our first course was a mango sorbet that was topped with a mint gel\u00e9e. It was a refreshing palette cleanser that was a nice segway into the rich dessert which was to follow. \n\nMt. Charleston- The base was a chocolate ice cream with a lavender mousse. This was then topped with a fluffy meringue. I loved that the lavender didn't overpower the entire dish. But it did linger after a couple of bites which was nice. \n\nMars- This was my favorite dessert. A white chocolate dome resembling the red planet was presented then flamb\u00e9ed with Hennessey by the p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re. As the dome collapsed, the yuzu mousse, chocolate cream, hazelnut crunch, and assorted fruits were exposed. The yuzu kept the dessert light and airy.\n\nMt. Fuji- Also known as a Mont Blanc, the Mt. Fuji is a fluffy sponge cake topped with chestnut cream. I enjoyed watching the prep for this dessert as the chestnut cream is dispensed through a squeeze tube resembling spaghetti!\n\nRingo- A deconstructed apple pie to say nonetheless. Honey ice cream is served on the side along with a candied apple filled with a vanilla bean cream. \n\nPrimavera- Watching the p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re prepare this made it taste even better! The base was a coconut panna cotta followed with strawberry sorbet, chocolate cream, fresh raspberries, and a rose water Moscato gel\u00e9e. A white chocolate disc was then placed on top followed by a raspberry sauce pour over that melted through the disc! \n\nI can't wait to go back!"

I haven't seen or felt anything in the US that reminds me of that feeling- until Sweets Raku!!!\n\nThe service and ambiance is so warm and inviting. The white counters, tables and china are expertly designed to compliment the colors and flavors of the desserts. Even the menus and items on it are carefully thought out to have that wow factor. I think the $19 Prix Fix is perfect! A cheap cup of factory made gelato is $10 on the strip and Sweet Raku desserts are made delicately by hand to order!\n\nMy first visit order consisted of:\n\n*Strawberry sorbet with mint jelly- lightly sweet with a great texture contrast with the jelly.\n*Ringo (Apple in Japanese)- a strudel like apple dessert with lattice top. Served next to a ruby red sugared apple filled with caramel and cream and perfectly sweetened honey ice cream! Superb!\n*Chocolate lava cake with rum raisins and berry/passion fruit marshmallows!\n\nI ordered the cherry tea which came in the most perfect tea cup with cute tea pot. This helped compliment and add contrast to the meal although water would probably do just as well. I love their tea cups!\n\nThis was an amazing experience! I was here for about an hour. Perfect wow moment to bring friends or a date. I also like eating at the counter so I can watch the process and the small detail the chefs add to make each plate edible art. \n\nIt is a small space and does get busy here and sometimes there is a wait. I love that this is a hidden gem and has no signage. Makes it feel more special and intimate."

Small, spotless, but now rendered less sterile by light Japanese music playing overhead it was just prior to noon that we arrived, and seated on the corner as soon as the restaurant unlocked the doors it would not be long before an order was crafted - a six-course meal plus supplements rolling out over the course of the next hundred minutes at a slow, but deliberate pace.  Beginning first with cocktails, the light sake and bubbles pairing nicely to a both creamy foie gras with laminated pastry batons and caviar that could have used a little more cr\u00e8me fraiche to balance the brine, it was largely conversation about food that passed the time between courses and with a shooter of soup and crisp salad balancing light vinaigrette with creamy potatoes both pleasant enough, our 'main courses' each impressed - for him the salmon and ikura while I opted for fatty bacon crafted of iberico belly matched to crisp potatoes inside of a crispy, hot croissant.  Transitioning from savory to sweet with mango sorbet dressed in mint jelly that unfortunately got lost in the sweetness it was onward to better things that the meal progressed and while my friend enjoyed the Mont Blanc I opted for the seasonal Stella, a star of strawberries served over an almond-soaked financier with cream melding the two into a designer 'strawberry shortcake' with texture and nuance to spare.  Wrapping up the afternoon in puffs of choux offered with options for both cream and jam it was with little hesitation that both of us selected vanilla and black currant, the shell giving way in a crisp break to just a touch of pressure and melting on the tongue leaving me to wish they offered profiteroles by the plate. \n\nA bit underwhelmed by the caviar presentation but again impressed by everything else, including a croissant and cream puffs that made me think Raku should consider a bakery style counter as its next conquest, I still contest that Sweets Raku should be a destination for everyone who loves pastry and anyone looking to impress an out of town guest - a genuinely un-Vegas experience mere miles from the strip where passion and artistry matter much more than publicist noise or the name on the door."

First off, I like the decor of the place.  You are immediately greeted by a wall of wine, which looks fantastic peering in from the outside, and a few pieces of novel art work on the wall (and in the bathroom.. very neat) that sets the tone of the evening: relaxed and inviting.  It was a little warm for my taste but they were baking stuff right in front of you so I quickly disregarded.\n\nNow, the food.  I like the concept of the menu in that once you order off of it, you can eat it.  They even provide some dipping sauce (raspberry on this occasion, I believe) for you to dip and munch.  Pretty cool in my book.  Opted for a cheese place because we came from an edomae place before we hit up sweets and I wasn't ready to grub anything too big.  Also divulged in a few glasses Sav Blanc to keep the party going and for pairing purposes as well.  Not too shabby and the cheese plate was a pretty good way to keep me at bay over casual conversation.  The part I liked most about the cheese plate actually wasn't the cheese.. it was the spiced pastry sticks that came with it.  I would've just snacked on that for the evening if I could order just that!  Easily the highlight of the culinary venture here.  I also tasted some pistachio ice cream, mango and yuzu marshmallows, and a little bit of the Red Rock cake to get in on a few of the flavors that they had to offer.  Everything was alright but nothing to write home (or Yelp) about.  I definitely liked the fact that it wasn't super sweet as I am not really a fan of overly sweet desserts, but, again, it was an ok experience with nothing that really stood out.\n\nService was good and I liked the fact that I can see the staff divvy up some dishes right in front of me.  I think the prices are reasonable and probably worth the experience but with everything factored in, I just wasn't feeling it.  Note: I'm a bit more partial to the other \"face\" of Raku around the corner but just couldn't hang with this place.  Probably would bring my wife to try it out and see if she would like it but it's just not enough to coax me back for any other outings."

The Raspberry Lava Cake is my favorite. We always had the Chocolate version and this is something new and unique. The Tiramisu and Cream Puffs are soso, especially the Cream Puffs, it's so dry that I only took one bite and can't finish it. Overall, I think this is a one-time experience thing, no need to come back constantly."

So when i went to Vegas for Labor Day weekend, Sweet Raku was on my top list to visit.\n\nI got there around 5:30 pm, no customers except for 2 of us. The decoration is very nice with white carrara marble for the bar and the wine cellar. It's nice sitting on the bar and seeing the chefs making the desserts.\n\nThey didn't have Ringo ( pie apple) so we ordered Marriage (Strawberry & Banana) and Apollo ( Chocolate & Raspberry mousse).  It was delicious. Apollo is definitely for chocolate lover, it has very strong chocolate taste. We both got wine to pair with the dessert. Mine was kinda sweet. I should have got the tea instead."

I wanted to jump up in victory teasing my friends that i was right.  Yelp would never steer me wrong!\n\nThe desserts here were excellent.  All the desserts are delicate and not overly sweet typical of Jap desserts.

Not only did it serve as talking point, but we also learned more about some interesting techniques.  This was not all just a gimmick as the taste backed it up for the most part.\n\nWe had the Soleil and Mt. Exotic as part of our dessert sets.  The process of making the Soleil was a sight to be seen.  It was slightly citrusy and not too sweet.  I highly recommend it.  The Mt. Exotic, on the other hand, was a disappointment visually.  It just looked messy, and a bit too sweet for my taste.  There are better desserts in Vegas, but I think Sweet Raku is good enough for a return visit next time."

You wouldn't even think twice of entering here.....if you didn't yelp.. Yay to yelp!  \n\nYou are transported to a cool white cloud of immaculate cleanliness. It's so clean, white, pure, so like a vanilla house.  I was fully impressed with the edible menu, the dessert show where they crack sugar with sauce, the explanations of all that is being served.  But I am sucker for dessert, show me them and i eat up before I can fully appreciate the work put into it....hence the cost!  \n\nI definitely would not go back just because it's so $$$ and kids just don't appreciate dessert either.....they just eat anything sweet! I might as well take them to buy a pint of Ben and Jerry's and they'd think that was the best Vegas could offer.  \n\nReserve this for special times, and Do Not come here on full stomach after lunch.

Luckily, I went with a party of 4 as soon as they opened. We still had to wait about 30 minutes, but considering how small the place was, the line moved pretty fast. They had 5 main desserts on the menu, of which we ordered 4. \n\nRingo (5/5): Originally we weren't planning on getting this one cuz it sounded just like an apple pie, but I'm so so so glad we did. It was one of my favorites of the day. Everything about this dessert just worked. There was a small apple pie with tart apples and a crispy, flakey, buttery crust. It was paired with a honey ice cream that was so delicate, but so fragrant. Together, the 2 were a match made in heaven. And as if that wasn't enough, there was a small candy apple on the side that was filled with the lightest whipped cream and a caramel sauce. It was a fun play on apple pie and salted caramel apple pie. This was definitely a crowd favorite because seconds after it hit the table, we were all essentially fighting to lick the plate clean. \n\nMars (4/5): This dessert was both fun to watch and fun to eat. The server used a blowtorch to eat up some alcohol, which she then poured on top of the little red dome of white chocolate on our plate. Inside was yuzu mousse that paired perfectly with the white chocolate, brandy, and fruits inside. It wasn't too sweet due to the alcohol and the yuzu which added a hint of tang, bitterness, and freshness.\n \nPrimavera (5/5): My other favorite of the day. This didn't look as beautiful as the other desserts since it was assembled in a wine glass, but the flavors made up for it. The coconut panna cotta inside was so good. Not too sweet, but you could definitely taste the coconut. It went so well with the strawberry sauce and the fruits inside. This was super refreshing. I recommend trying to dig your spoon all the way to the bottom and grabbing a little bit of everything in one bite to get the full effect of this one. \n\nMt. Charleston (2/5): Sadly, we did not enjoy this dessert as much as the other ones. I personally wasn't a fan of the lavender. It was a bit too floral for my liking and didn't work well with the sweetness of the meringue. Overall, the dish was a bit too bitter and the components on the plate didn't mesh together. It left a strange aftertaste in our mouthes. \n\nAll in all, I would definitely come back here to try more of their desserts if I'm ever in the Las Vegas area again. \n\nCons: \n- Skip the Mt. Charleston\n- Gets super crowded if you come late\n- Hard to find parking\n- Super small interior\n\nPros: \n- Amazingly well thought out desserts \n- Cute interior (love the tea tins on the wall and the giant wine cooler)\n- Great service and friendly staff"

Saw one of the guests order the Carib where the chef poured the heated sauce on top of the sugar cover. The heat from the sauce then melted the cover to cover the dessert underneath in the glass. Such a fun and pretty presentation! \n\nAbsolutely loved the amuse bouche as the pineapple sorbet wasn't overly sweet nor tart. Very refreshing and the white wine jelly complimented the sorbet very nicely as well. The Jack in a Cup is a chocolate souffle with banana creme filling that is injected right in front of you. So fun to watch the souffle rise. The cream puff had an airy but slightly crispy dough with the custard very light and airy (like whipped cream). All the house-made marshmallows were tiny but bursting with flavors.\n\nOur waitress was very polite and described everything perfectly with much enthusiasm. \n\nDefinitely a fun experience and would definitely come back to try their other items.\n\nNOTE: Check out the bathroom. They have a bidet and a waterfall sink faucet with a pretty decor inside the sink!"

I recommend trying anything with a sugar blown treat (apple and pear filled with whipped cream is what I've had so far).\n\nThere are so many other restaurants and shops in this center so parking can be tight.

The prix fixe menu offers three courses starting with an amuse, a choice of the day's desserts, and a petit four. Wine pairings are offered for an additional $7. Prior to ordering, we were presented with an edible rice paper menu. It was a fun way of showcasing some of the thought and skill that goes into all the desserts here. It was served with a delicious raspberry sauce. \n\nThe amuse was a strawberry sorbet with mint gel\u00e9e. It was a simple, yet refreshing starter. For my next course, I got the ringo (\"apple\" in Japanese), which was apple pie served with an edible caramelized apple with a side of honey sorbet. The most aesthetically-pleasing and impressive component was the apple. The flavors were reminiscent of a creme brul\u00e9e with a nice candied shell protecting the cream inside. The flavorful honey sorbet was made without any sugar. \n\nOther main courses included the angel cream, which was light  and enjoyable. The Mt. Fuji, the most interesting of the bunch, was a chestnut cream cake that depicts the most well-known peak in Japan. It looked more like a ball of spaghetti, but the chestnut flavors dominated the dish. Our tasting ended with a mini chocolate molten lava cake with dried fruit and marshmallows. \n\nThe unique counter seating gave a great view of all our desserts being prepared. One last note. Whether you need to use the restroom or not, check it out. The sink and faucet are one-of-a-kind. Sweets Raku is definitely worth a visit the next time you're in Vegas."

Every thing about this place is kawaii. \nSweets Raku is a Japanese dessert shop next door to the restaurant Raku (yes, they're different places. Don't accidentally come in here thinking it's the restaurant- like so many people do). It's brightly lit with most of its seats being at the counter (3 tables off to the side). If you want to watch your dessert being made get a seat at the counter! They don't take reservations and the restaurant is small so plan ahead. \nThe desserts can be ordered by themselves or for an extra $3 (total $15) you can get a bite of the most amazing sorbet you'll ever have. The mango sorbet tasted like a creamy, iced mango. The Haagen Dazs mango sorbet I've loved for years now tastes artificial and lacking. Thanks a lot, Raku! Warning! if you're vegetarian the sorbet comes with some mint jelly on top! \nThe Carib, or the chocolate melting wine glass dessert you see on everyones snapchat, is a fruit and mousse dessert. The dessert was prettier than it tasted. In other words, take pictures of the one your neighbor orders and order something else for yourself. \nThe Mt. Fuji (Or if you want to be a show off order it as 'Fuji-san' ;)) is a chestnut cake. Momburan, as it's called in Japan, is not very sweet and has a pretty nutty taste to it. It's my FAVORITE. The momburan at Sweets Raku is the best I've had in America and decent compared to the ones I've had in Japan. \n\nObviously take your time to eat, but it may not be the best place to hold your 2 hour long conversation with your best friend that you haven't seen in years. It gets pretty crowded and you'll probably get a lot of stink eye from those standing directly behind you waiting for your seat to open up. \nIf you're staying on the strip and are wondering if it's worth the taxi ride.. YES. YES IT IS. There are plenty of \"cheaper\" restaurants to have dinner at so that you can splurge a little on dessert in the area. \nThe parking situation in this lot is pretty horrendous. Why are there so many great restaurants in one plaza!!"

Afterwards, upon entry, if you run into a wall made of wine bottles, you have just entered the back door to heaven.\n\nI ain't even got a sweet tooth, however, any place that offers a edible menu on wafer paper, served with berry dipping sauce...count me in!  It's like being given a top secret mission before destroying the encrypted message via consumption, I love it!\n\nThe plan was easy, devour all the extravagant sweets in sight, take photos off everything, laugh with strangers and comment about how we would all slap the spit out of our mama's since everything was soo Damn delicious, all the while acting bujee as a mofo.  Mission accomplished, and some.\n\nWe stayed with the amuse that included Mint jelly on fresh strawberry sorbet followed by conquering Mt. Fuji.  The dormant volcano erupted with a concoction consisting of water chestnuts topped with a stringy looking covering that resembled soba noodles, very interesting.  The Ringo just might be the best apple pie I ever had.  The fish came with cream encased in a sugar casing shaped like a candied apple, the design was immaculate.  I washed everything down with a Cappuccino and glad I did.  A friend got the iced coffee that used ice cubes ice cubes made of coffee! It was placed on a Lego coaster just as the movie is coming out soon, nice.  You gotta end the night on the cheesecake adorned with tangerine chunks.\n\nThe decor was magnificent and you could enjoy it with orchestra music.  The best part of all was the bathroom, I ish you not!  I had to check it out after our friends went I there and came out exhilarated.  Once I got in there I didn't see anything that initially stood out, until...The toilet seat cover automatically opened on me at such an elegant speed.  But this was no regular toilet, it was a black futuristic bidet!  Not only was it finished in a bold onyx black, it came with a massage feature, say what!?!  As if having dessert bliss wasn't enough...you get to shoot water up where the sun don't shine...  Afterwards, the faucet came out of the wall and poured water into what looked like a bucket filled with faux greenery and vines.  I had to video IG my memorable experience here at Sweets Raku.

They need to get a bigger place because this place was very small. There were about 10 seats at the counter and maybe 3 booths, if I'm correct. The first time I was here was almost 2 years ago and I have been hooked since. I knew that every time I come back to Vegas, I had to stop here. It wasn't popular at the time so there was no wait time and we stayed almost 3 hours on a Saturday and also got to try some lunch sandwiches. I think there were 4 of us and we each did the 3 course dessert for $25 and we each ordered different desserts so that we could try them all. I love that they make everything in front of you. \n\nThis time we waited about 30-45min but again it was worth it. It was hot but they had some iced lemon water for us. Sweets Raku was the reason I came back to Vegas so I had to drop by no matter what. We stopped by on a weekday so they opened at 6pm (Mon-Fri, closed Wed?). Therefore the sandwiches weren't available, just desserts. Last time they had edible menu that you tear and dip in this fruity sauce almost like chips and salsa which they currently are not serving. This time they didn't have the 3 course dessert for $25 but 2 course for $15 which came with a sorbet and a main dessert.  But what we did was saved $3 and ordered all the different kinds of desserts for $12 each and shared. There were 4 of us again but I think there were 5 main desserts so we got to try them all. Most of the desserts were the same as 2 years ago but had different flavors this time. They all still tasted amazing and so rich with flavors. Our bill came out to $100 so $25 each. So if you're the owner reading this, please get a bigger place or open from 12pm to midnight on weekdays too, not just the weekends. I would really appreciate that and so would everyone else."

The chilled sake was also very delicious, as it was not your typical sake, but it was like a gel like texture as you drank it. Different flavors, which both the blueberry and peach were very good. \nThe desserts of course were so good as well. My friends and I ordered all five desserts and just simply enjoyed them all. The only downfall is, if you are going for lunch on the weekend, plan on spending some time there. It's not your typical fast paced restaurant, but more to sit and talk stories.

What better spot then to take her to a dessert bar where you can supposedly eat the menu?! I've never been to a dessert place where there is actually a set menu with 3 different courses of dessert... faaa-annn-ccyyy! \n\n- Decor & Structure -  \nEverything is covered completely in white - white tables, white counter top, white work space. Okay, I guess it''s just safe to say I pretty much stepped into heaven. \n\nThere's about 2 4-top tables and 1 2-top table that are available to sit at (it may be just 2 total) and the rest of the sitting is at the bar that runs around the working area where you can watch them do their magic. We got there at 8-8:30PM ish on a Friday. I guess we came just in time because as soon as we were leaving there was a line looping around to the door. \n\nThis may sound weird, but if you get a chance.. check out the bathroom!! I'm not going to tell you why, just do it.\n\n- Service - \nService was exceptional, as I would expect nothing less. When you first sit down, they give you a hot towel, of course like traditional Japanese custom. They will come back repeatedly to your table always checking to see if your glass is full and is very accommodating to anything you may need. \n\n- Menu - \nThey offer 3 different kinds of specialty water that is shipped straight from the mountainous waters of Japan. No joke. One that is filled with ions to aid this, minerals to aid that, and one that is just the purest form. It comes in a large bottle that they take straight from the 'refrigerator window display'. It's about $4 a bottle which really isn't that bad when you compare it to the small tiny bottles of Dasani you buy in casinos on the strip, or even Starbucks. We started with all 3 bottles and to me it tasted all the same, except the purest, but hey if you're a water connoisseur you might really enjoy their selection.\n\nNow for the important part, the desserts. To start, as you probably already know, they place a menu in front of you and because I read from other reviews that it's edible, I already began tearing pieces off and putting them in my mouth. Well, it tastes exactly like what you think a menu would taste... like paper. It was coiled and wrapped with a thin candy cane like ring. That was delicious! It's pretty much hardened burnt sugar, so it reminded me a lot of creme brulee. Well the server came back and saw that we had already began chomping away and gave us what we're actually supposed to dip it in had we waited. It was a raspberry syrup that honestly didn't make it taste that much better, but definitely very interesting!\n\nThey offer a set menu for $20 or you can order a la carte. Each dessert a la carte is ~$12. The set menu didn't really sound too appealing to me since I figure the first and last course would probably be more of a tasting experience. I was just interested in the main course which is the option you can order a la carte. I wish I could go into detail with each dessert we ordered (total of 3) but they were so fancy and I feel like the menu changes often so you really have to experience it yourself. One thing I can say is that if there's a strawberry shortcake on the menu, you can go ahead and skip that. It's nothing too spectacular. If they still offer it, go for the angel cheescake (?) - as cheesy as it sounds, it tasted like it was made in heaven. Hehe see what I did there? \n\nAnyway, this is something I never really experienced before and would definitely be a place I'd recommend for anyone looking for a date night, or just a sugar addict!"

Service was great, with how busy they were everyone stayed calm & kind. My personal opinion I think this is more for presentation rather than flavor. I wasn't thrilled. $12 minimum per person which isn't bad we got the Mt. Fiji & Apple pie which came with sorbet. I didn't feel the Mt. Fiji had any flavor at all. I enjoyed the apple pie & the sorbets were different. Flavor was good for sorbets but it was a texture thing for me. Had jelly or lychee which didn't make me a fan.

However, having been here twice now in the last few weeks, I'm forced to recognize that Sweets Raku is mostly hype and very little substance.\n\nSweets Raku does have some strengths - the absolute best feature is the layout/d\u00e9cor/ambiance. It's a fun and cute place to be in, and the open kitchen design makes the dessert preparation a fun show. This aspect of the restaurant I do love. (And don't forget to check out the sink in the bathroom.)\n\nUnfortunately, disappointing is the first word that comes to my mind when I think about the food. Perhaps the Mt. Fuji dessert epitomizes the problem I have with their approach;  the dish looks absolutely stunning when it is being prepared, with chestnut mousse being separated into strands and layered over cream and cake, then topped with chocolate powder and accented with crunchy wafers. But when I eat it, it just tastes like any old chestnut mousse and sponge cake. There's no depth to the flavors or texture or other sensations and nothing interesting going on. And when I visit a dessert specialist, I expect something amazing - not just any old dessert that I might get after an average meal at some average restaurant.\n\nAnd that's the problem with Sweets Raku. If you don't care about the open kitchen and watching the dessert being prepared right in front of you, then frankly you're much better off heading to a gourmet Strip restaurant and getting dessert there (I know of several Strip restaurants including Michelin-starred spots that will seat you even if you're only ordering dessert, and many more will let you order dessert only at the bar, too) - and you'll pay about the same as you would at Sweets Raku, to boot.\n\nThe worst part about all this is that both times I've come here, my party has agreed that the Mt. Fuji was the best dish. If the consensus best dish is something I think tastes mediocre..... oh well. I do think that the Red Rock was a close second, although maybe only because I liked the yuzu marshmellow.\n\nService is also very spotty. On both visits, our courses were not paced particularly well and we were also left waiting a long time to get the check. Also, on one of my visits I had to ask twice for a hot water refill for my tea and still never got it. Some of the staff have a lot of difficulty speaking English, which could contribute to some of the interaction difficulties - and it sure makes it hard to understand sometimes what exactly we're being fed."

It's usually best to call for reservations but we just walked in and got seated at the bar. You can choose if you want an a la carte dessert or do a set which includes 2 things in it: sorbet and a main dessert from the menu. I ended up getting the 2 item prix fixe which I chose a blueberry champagne sorbet and OMG best sorbet I've ever tried. The blueberries were hidden underneath so after my second bite I had a taste of it and my boyfriend said my facial expression changed dramatically and looked so surprised [in the good way]. For the main dessert I chose carib which has a beautiful presentation. The dessert comes in a wine glass and then there's a thin flat piece of chocolate over it which is then melted off when they pour some liquid thing over it. My boyfriend ordered the ringo which is like an apple pie. Great crust and super tasty. I'd recommend this dessert place for anyone looking to impress their date or is looking for something with great presentation. They make it all in front of you too so you get a little show. There also is a minimum order for each person too so you can't share one dessert."

The place was clean and very plain and simple. We ordered fairly quickly but it took a while for the deserts to come out, and they came out a different times. I ordered the puffy cup. It was okay. The presentation was fancy, but that was about it. My sweet tooth was not satisfied, it lacked something. The line started to build up, so we were lucky we didn't have to wait in line. I don't think I'd wait that long for a dessert here.\n\nOverall, gorgeous presentations, but the puffy cup was overrated. I believe they constantly change their menu so maybe I just chose the wrong dessert. As long as I don't have to wait for seats, I'd come back to try the rest!"

Not sure, but I like to think so. It's a small room decorated all in white, with about 10 seats at the 'bar' where you can watch a few of the desserts being made, and about 10 table seats. Warning: there is no signage! It's located between Kabuto and a massage place.\nThe food menu (which is edible!), includes a 3-course prix fixe option or a 1-course option. The drink menu has an extensive selection of champagne and dessert wines, but unfortunately, these are all quite high-priced and there are very few by the glass selections. In addition, you can order from a wide variety of teas and several types of bottled Japanese water of various ph's. We tried the 'bicarbonate' one, which is supposedly for athletes. I could taste a slight difference from the tap water, but I'm not sure if it was worth $4!\nOn to the main thing, the desserts! They were all delicious. Our amuse was a white peach sorbet with sparkling wine jelly and it was sooo good. Usually peach-flavored things are cloyingly sweet, but this was so light and delicious! The small beads of sparkling wine jelly perfectly complemented it. I could have eaten about 10 of these.\nFor our 'main' dish we had the 'angel' (cookie with pear gel on top and covered with a pear foam) and the 'red rock' (raspberry molten cake with vanilla ice cream and yuzu marshmallows and some other stuff!). The angel was really good - light, with just a hint of pear - but the red rock was awesome! Seriously, I usually don't like 'molten' cakes because they're goopy and too sweet and the cake part is heavy, but THIS.....this was so good. And of all things, the yuzu marshmallows really stood out! It was disappointing that we only had 2! Our last dish was the cream puff. It was good and all, but small, and nothing too special.\nI would highly recommend everybody check out Sweets Raku at least once - it's a perfect date night! Add a bottle of dessert wine and you could even skip dinner! At $19 for the prix fixe menu, it's definitely more than you'd spend on typical dessert, but it's perfect for a special occasion.\nSo why, you may ask, do I not give it 5 stars? Simply because it is waaayyyyy......toooooooo.....slllllloooowwww. Seriously, we were there over an hour! I appreciate that every dish is made by hand as it's ordered, but could you maybe hire another cook back there? At a pace like that, it's not really even good for kids. Ours held out to the end, but we ended up scarfing down the cream puff in 1 bite each since it was way past bedtime by that time."

Pulling out on to Decatur and heading north, I asked her if she wanted any dessert.  I pulled out the cellphone and activated the soothsayer that is yelp and typed in desserts in our area.  Sweets Raku popped up at the top of the list.  We flipped a bitch and made a turn and then another turn before pulling into a packed parking lot on the NW corner (sort of) at Decatur and Spring Mountain.  Lucky to find a parking spot after pulling into a busy commercial center, we made our way to what could be the end of the dessert rainbow.\n\nTight quarters coupled with a wait normally make me freak out.  But walking through the door, I could see and smell this place was special.  And so we waited behind a party of four and another 1/2 party waiting for the other 1/2.\n\nTime ticked by and we occupied out time looking at all the beautiful pictures on yelp.  This garnered the attention of a party of two ladies who checked out the photos before one of them remembered they had the yelp app on their phone.\n\nAs we entertained ourselves in the hallway by the front door, eventually the party of four were sat at.  And eventually the party of 1/2 now two were sat.  \n\nIn nervous anticipation, we waited as my eyes survived the surroundings.  All white was the surroundings.  The chefs moved creating curious pieces of tasty looking treats like Willy Wonks's Umpalumpas but the were much more adorable and precise.\n\nWe ordered off a prefix menu and had three amazing sweet treats that I could not even tell you what the hell they were and that includes devouring the menu...literally.\n\nI know only two things.  I will be back and you have to check out the absolutely funky bathroom."

The place is not very big, but was fairly empty when we came so we didn't have to wait. The interior is very bright and has a sleek, simple, but sophisticated atmosphere (very Japanese).\n\nThe employees are all Japanese and spoke Japanese to each other. We chose to sit at the bar to watch them make the desserts, which I highly recommend doing. The care and detail that goes into making each dish is remarkable, though since the menu isn't too big, they get good at making their subset of dishes. The mannerisms of the workers are very Japanese too.\n\nThere is a minimum order (dollar amount) per person, which we managed to meet fairly easily. They offer a \"combo\" deal which comes with a sorbet starter, but since the combos all come with same sorbet, we decided to just order one combo and the rest of our desserts a la carte.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed all of our dishes. Our party of four shared everything and had a lot of fun eating each dish and savoring the various components with their different textures.\n\nWhile the desserts here aren't that cheap, they aren't crazy expensive either, considering the quality of the food and the experience that you get. I highly recommend checking it out for something unique!\n\nP.S. I apologize for the lack of photos! I went searching and couldn't find any, then remembered that I didn't get to take any since my phone died, and had to borrow a friend's phone just to check-in. I'm sure to return to Sweets Raku someday though, so will add photos after a future visit!"

Which also means: course meals for your desserts, long lines+wait, extremely limited seating and a bathroom with heated seats + waterfall like sink. Seating for this place is in a line fashion, not a waitlist version where you put your name down, so if you're coming here after dinner, expect to wait at least 1.5 hours in line before getting seated. \n\nFor the 2 course dessert meal here (which comes with your main dessert + their dessert of the day), I ordered the primavera, which is basically coconut panna cotta with raspberry sorbet in a wine glass. The dessert of the day, I forgot the name of it...but it tasted like tiramisu. In general all my friends and I agreed that the food here is good, but everything definitely looked better than it tasted. \n\nLastly....they also have a 20% gratuity charge for parties of 5 or more, but don't even try to be smart and spilt up your group because they're just going to find an excuse to charge you that 20% anyways. When we informed the manager that we were different parties (I mean it should have been obvious since we were seated at completely different times) she failed to take off the 20% charge for us. I am somewhat disappointed in this since this is just bad practice imo. \n\nOverall, this place is a good place for anyone who loves desserts...but I probably wouldn't come here again."

Really how long does it really take to 1st course: scoop out some sorbet and ass champagne garnish and 3rd course: heat up a premade cream puff? \n\nThey could really do themselves a favor by adding another server, adding a host or hostess, or something. Either I went on an off night or I'm just missing something.\n\nThe girls tried to be sweet and tried to explain everything well but it didn't work for me. There was so much inconsistency with service. \n\nExample: how about explaining the edible menu before the first course is almost coming out?\n\nThe sauce they serve with the rice paper menu is awesome.\n\nI liked the price for the prix fix 3 course dessert tasting. I liked the desserts. I like the restaurant itself. \n\nI wouldn't return any time soon. The whole \"experience\" was disappointing to me."

They used to have 3 courses and now they only have two (for $15, ala carte for $12). We ordered all 3 items from the left (we'll try the right one next visit). Carib is hands down our favorite. It's panna cotta with fruits and mouse and sorbet poured over by hot mango sauce. Clean, full of flavors, refreshing and not that sweet."

Sweets only serves desserts and the occasional cheese fare along with a nice selection of teas and alcoholic beverages. I don't believe they take reservations and it's a small space (around 20 seats) so a long wait time can be expected. To get a better experience, try to get a seat at the bar so you can watch your desserts being made. Each dessert is a lovely piece of art. From my experience, the flavors were not out-of-this-world good, but good nonetheless.\n\nOverall, Sweets Raku is a unique dining experience that won't break the bank (unless you order and drink a lot of alcohol). How unique? Even their menu is edible."

I can, however, appreciate delectable sweets every once in a while.\n\nThe ambiance here is... White. Bright, white walls and small in size. There's bar seating and a few tables for seating. I imagine the most Sweets Raku can hold is 20 people or so. \n\nI sat at the bar with a friend - I ordered the Caribe, my friend ordered the Mt. Fuji, and we shared some macaroons. We also tried the wine flight where a few samples of wine were selected by the pastry chef (to pair nicely with our desserts). All. Of. It. Was. Delicious. \n\nPresentations were highly impressive and the servers went into detail of each dessert. \n\n- Macaroons; Order came with 5 - vanilla, red bean, lemon, green tea, and coffee/mocha. Macaroons are usually too sweet for me but these were superb. The vanilla was my favorite!\n- Caribe; There was a lot going on but I enjoyed every last bite. A dessert concoction with mango and coconut flavors presented in a large wine glass. Creamy coconut panna cotta goodness and bananas along with other fruits and goodies. There's a thin candy lid placed on top of the glass and they pour a mango syrup which melts right through!\n-Mt. Fuji; Moussy hazelnut with hints of chocolate. Very creamy. I didn't have too many bites of this but it was very smooth and sweet! \n- Wine flights; Flight came with 3 small samples (test tubes) of wine, 2 white and 1 red. Also came with a small assortment of cheese and marinated tomatoes. Yummy!\n\n$12 for one dessert entree might sound pricey but for the taste and experience, it's well worth it at Sweets Raku!"

Both Mr. B and I were in awe with the work she did on a wedding cake that she was working on when we walked in.  We knew right then we were in for a treat getting to sit at the counter and watch her make our desserts.\n \nThis innovative restaurant focuses on dessert only that is served in courses thru their set Prix Fixe menu (1st amuse, 2nd Entree/main dessert, 3rd petit four)  or you can order the feature dessert items ala carte as well. \n\nRant: We witnessed some guests that had an issue regarding the price ($19) + no sharing on Prix Fixe menu. Seriously you're going to squawk forking a couple dollars more? For what you get, that's an exceptional deal!  If you dine at some of the upscale restaurants you will pay the equivalent for just a single dessert. (Mr. B reminded me about the time I dragged him to MO for the tiny cupcakes and 1 pot of tea $50..lol) Too bad for the people that walked out because they couldn't get around the no share policy. Your date missed out on an awesome dining experience. (and you lost your baller status Mr. I Drive a  90k+ car) \n\nBack to raving:  Even though we were full from dinner and shaved snow as it was,  I managed to get the Prix Fixe with Apollo as my choice dessert and Mr. B just got the Veil ala carte. Dessert was superb!  Especially made us much more appreciative of it when we got to watch Chef Mio carefully prepare each of the components and details of the desserts with such precision. Watch the procedure when she makes the bird nest topper for the Veil. It's crazy!\n\nThis place was a bit difficult to find. We came here initially to have shaved snow desserts over at Snowflake Shavery.  I knew this place was close by but couldn't see any sign glancing around Seoul Plaza. Finally we spotted the silver spoon to the right of the storefront. Thanks to Roger T for replying to my SOS quick for that visual cue\n.\nAmbience calm and clean, quite a contrast from the hectic parking lot. Our server was really sweet and friendly.  She also helped with being my translator when talking with Chef Mio. Loved our dessert dining experience here. Pretty unique. I would suggest this place for date night! We will  definitely will return as well."

It was a Tuesday night, so they weren't too busy when we came so we were immediately seated at the bar. Awesome because you get to see the chef make everything (not from scratch of course but she puts it all together in front of you) You can even see her make the crystallized sugar as each order comes up! How cool is that? \n\nService is a little slow, but with such sweet girls serving us and a show in front, it was ok with me. You're given a plate with a scroll on it to unwrap where they'll explain the menu for you. after You've had time to look over the menu, they come around to pour their TO DIE FOR raspberry sauce to dip your EDIBLE menu with. this sauce...was heaven. I swear. \n\nMy BFF and I decided to go with 3 main dessert entree's instead of the 3 course meal just because we don't care for cream puffs much. But really, the 3 course meal is a score so it's your preference, we're just fatties like that. \n\nI loved every dessert we tried. EVERYTHING. Each was amazing in their own way, but the Red Rock (lava flow) was one of my favorites and tops it on my list of favorite desserts. This surpasses Roy's Chocolate Souffle and if anyone knows me, you know I die and go to heaven with each bite of his souffle but this lava cake was the perfect mix of sweet and sour and light. \n\nFYI: Mt. Fuki (chestnut cream cake) seems to be something thats always on the menu and their #1 seller. The couple next to us told us it was the most amazing dessert they've ever had (next to red rock) so when i'm back in Vegas, i'll be there to try this dessert. \n\nThey don't take reservations here but if you're going on a weekday, they'll most likely have a table open or the wait isn't that long. But it is wroth the wait. Also, the desserts are $12 for just the entree and $19 for the 3 course. The chef is from Japan and if anyone knows anything about the Japanese, they're talented when it comes to food and what makes it perfect for my palate is that they know how to use sugar and not let the sugar be the main object of the piece. (it's not overly sweet, but just perfect. I really hate desserts that taste mostly of sugar and nothing else because that's how most people in America like their dessert)"

We tried to go last Saturday night but the line was ridiculous and there was no parking. \n\nThere was a group of 5 ahead of us, and although there were 3 bar seats open (which obviously would not have worked for the group ahead of us), it took the person in charge of the seating 15 minutes to ask that group if it was okay that we got seated at the bar first. \n\nThe space is really small. Workers are bumping into each other. They squeezed in too many bar stools on the bar that it's hard to get in and out of those chairs. And I felt rushed being there because the place was too small and you look out and see a line of people outside waiting for their turn. Not really the kind of ambience I would want if I was looking to get dessert and coffee. \n\nSitting at the bar was cool because you saw everything that was being done, but also realize that the workers were not sanitary (not wearing gloves, not washing their hands after picking up a pen). \n\nWe ordered the Mars, Mt. Charleston, and Mt. Fuji with espresso, coffee, and sparkling water. The desserts and coffee were good, but definitely not good enough for me to want to come back."

Was hoping the flavors would blow me away more, but the experience was still great. \n\nThis is in the same shopping center as Raku the regular restaurant, but Sweets Raku is towards the front of the parking lot! We were confused at first and didn't know they were difference restaurants. \n\nFOOD:\nRed rock (4 stars): Raspberry and white chocolate go so well together. The raspberry sauce is really good. My favorite dish out of the ones I tried. The sauce in the cake part is nice and warm too. All the textures work really well together. \n\nBaton (3.75 stars) Couldn't taste any pistachio in the dish. The chocolate cake with what tasted like a raspberry or wine like sauce at the bottom was really rich and good! The passion fruit gelee bits were also good. You can't taste all the individual flavors together though, I had to specifically look for each component to get that flavor. But I did like the chocolate wafer it was covered in. \n\nStella (3 stars): My least favorite. Definitely not a tiramisu. More of a strawberry tart. \n\nCalbri (3.5): If you love fruits and mango you should get this one. Very pretty dish and great presentation. The most fun to get because they poor a sauce over the chocolate covering the glass. But the dish is not so pretty once you start eating it because the glass starts getting smeary and you can't see what you're eating from the sides of the glass anymore. It had a lot of components but you mostly taste mango. \n\nSuch beautiful presentation. It's a great experience, makes you feel fancy in Chinatown. I love food art so I had a great time seeing the beautiful dishes come out. The flavors just didn't live up to the presentation. Each dessert was $12 and each person needs to order one. I just didn't feel like all the flavors in the description came out in each dish. I have the biggest sweet tooth and I love desserts, so I am a little more picky about them being perfect. \n\nATMOSPHERE:\nVery pretty restaurant. You can sit at the bar and watch them make the desserts. They first come out with edible menus which was really cool. They give you a yummy raspberry sauce to dip it in. And I had to check out the bathroom after reading reviews on here. It is a really nice bathroom, haha, so check it out as you wait. \n\nSERVICE:\nOur waitress was really nice. I noticed when someone was about to walk in the door they say something out loud to let the waitress know to come out and greet them. So service is important to them. They also put a cute chocolate sign that said happy father's day on one of the desserts for a father when we came in on father's day, so nice."

It was fun to sit at the bar and watch the ladies prepare all the desserts. \n\nMy boyfriend and I both ordered the prix fixe menu, which included an amuse bouche (mango sorbet), a main course (we chose red rock and the stella), and a cream puff (cream + jam of your choice).\n\nService as alright. When we came in there weren't many people there so they seated us promptly, but then we had to sit there awkwardly for a little while. A drink list was brought out. They asked us what we wanted to drink, but I ended up not ordering any wine because I wanted to see what the desserts were before I decided. There's a $7 wine tasting pairing that you can get with the dessert, so I ended up doing that since they had already taken the drink menu away. Since only one person is preparing the dessert, my main course came out well before my boyfriend's. Since it had some ice cream / gelato / something frozen on the side, I wanted to eat it before it melted. His came out after I finished. They also forgot about my wine pairing, so they comped it. I think the entire glass with wine had also been in the refrigerator. \n\nThe dessert was also alright. Nothing phenomenal, but very pretty. Good for an occasion, but I won't be rushing back here just to eat."

We all ordered a different one without the two course. \nMy friend had told one of the waitresses that it was my birthday but she brought out the wrong dessert with the candle because she said my other friend and I looked alike. It was okay though. \nI thought the dessert I chose had the best flavor compared to the other 3 my friends got. It's called the Carib and it was a panna cotta with melon ice balls and a mango type sauce that melted the white chocolate that was placed on top of the cup. Everything worked very well together. \nThe apple strudel was interesting. I wasn't so much into the strudel but the sugar blown apple with cream and caramel inside was really cool. \nThe souffl\u00e9 with banana cream was not bad but kind of over sweet to me. \nI didn't really get to try one of the desserts that my friend got because he ate it so fast! \nThe place is very small but very clean and picturesque.

This is not your typical dessert place with display shelves full of pastries, cakes, etc.  There really isn't anything to display other than its huge selection of wine, because all the main pastry items (more like works of art) are all made fresh in front of you.  If you sit at the counter you can watch the pastry chefs make your desserts right in front of you.  These aren't simple desserts that can be put together with a simple frosting or decoration; these require careful attention to detail and numerous steps to put together.  Watching them make the dessert was just as enjoyable as eating it.\n\nSweets Raku is set up more like a full service restaurant.  I don't think there's even a to go option. You grab whatever seats that are available and wait for someone to give you a menu.  You can go a la carte or go with its two-course dessert set ($15), which includes a choice of main dessert and another appetizer style dessert of the day.  On the day we visited it was a choice of two types of sorbets.  You can also add a pairing wine for $7 extra.\n\nMy wife and I went with the two course dessert set and chose Ringo (apple pie with honey ice cream and candy apple) and Blueberry Champagne sorbet.  We also ordered wine flight which was served in test tubes over ice.\n\nRingo was a dessert like no other.  It truly was a work of art.  I don't think I can ever eat any other apple pie after this.  The crust on the apple pie was hot, crispy, flaky with just the right amount of buttery taste.  The apple filling was crisp, sweet, and tart, just the way it should be.  The honey ice cream was well balanced with a perfect amount of sweetness.  The most interesting part was the candy apple.  It wasn't a real candy apple but a delicate candy shell made in house to make it look like an apple.  It was filled with house made whip cream and caramel sauce.  Watching the pastry chefs make this was truly priceless.  \n\nWhen I hear sorbet it just sounds really boring, but the sorbet we tried here was nothing like ones we had in the past.  It came in three layers with a slightly frozen fruit layer at the bottom; a silky white, mousse-like layer in the middle; and a gelatin layer at the top.  I'm not sure exactly what the middle layer was made with but it seemed like an egg white mixture, similar to a meringue but in a more liquid form. Overall combination was very refreshing and not too sweet.  It had little bit of carbonation, which wasn't surprising given the name Blueberry Champagne sorbet.\n\nMio Ogasawara won the Pastry Chef of the Year award from Desert Companion in 2013.  We feel honored she made our dessert on the night we visited.\n\nSweets Raku is definitely the most yelp-worthy place I visited in 2015, which is why I saved it as the last review of this year, and my 600th review.  My wife and I will be doing a back-to-back visits to Raku and Sweets Raku every year from now on."

Part of the appeal is watching dishes be created in front of you. They no longer use the edible menu. Instead a more traditional printed menu with pictures and descriptions is used. A 2 course dessert pairing ($15) is listed in place of the previous 3 course option. I inquired about the 3 courses and the accommodated me. \n\nTo start was a smooth and light strawberry sorbet with jelly, followed by the perfectly light for summer Mt. Exotic. Its subtle sweetness and crispy base were topped with a spongey cake and mango cream with tartness and acidity added from a raspberry sauce. My wife ordered the Ringo ($12) a la carte. It's a gorgeous and well crafted apple pie. The caramelized apples were covered by a crispy lattice crust, next to it was honey ice cream and an apple-shaped object made of sugar and filled with cream and caramel. It's an absolute must when visiting this place and one of the better desserts I've had in town. Ending the meal was a delicate and flaky cream puff filled with a semi sweet chocolate cream and raspberry sauce.\n\nService was excellent. The interior is stark white, clean and pristine.

I took a friend here for her birthday after we chowed down some kbbq, not sure what to expect. It's pretty small, but luckily we got two seats at the bar. There are also a few tables away from the bar, but you don't want to get stuck at one of those because you miss all the action of the dessert chefs at work.\n\nWe ordered red sangria, and then shared the 3-course menu, which came with a mango sorbet, an \"entree\", and a cream puff. For our entree, we opted for the strawberry shortcake. \n\nFirst of all, the sangria is one of the best I've ever tasted. It had a \"creamsicle\" aftertaste, which may seem strange but was actually totally amazing. The mango sorbet tastes like frozen mangos pureed then frozen and somehow turned into sorbet. It was so crisp and smooth all at the same time. I could've gone for a couple more servings of that. It came with a mint jelly that did not taste like mint at all, but more like sour apple, which paired beautifully with the sorbet.\n\nNext came our strawberry shortcake. I had told our server we were celebrating a birthday, so the chefs personalized it for my friend and everyone sang happy birthday to her when they brought it out. It was so nice of them. This dessert was TO DIE for. Seriously, the shortcake is perfectly spongy and the cream that came on top of it is smooth and subtly sweet. This dish also came with a delicious strawberry sorbet. \n\nLast but not least, the cream puff came and we had chosen chocolate as the cream filling. They cut it in half for us and we promptly devoured this in 10 seconds flat even though we were stuffed. Everything was amazing! The service was great, the food was great, the experience was great. Definitely recommended for anyone with a sweet tooth looking for a fun and unique experience."

However when I went back this time with my mom both the service and quality of food had gone down hill.\n\nFood:\n-no more edible menu.  I was really disappointed. I really liked it.\n-no solie (the orange desert) . They substitute with a angel wing cream desert however it doesnt taste or look as good as solie. Compare to solie its made with a lot less effort.  \n\nService:\n\n1. Before I had a chance to finish my first dish they already brought out the 2nd dish.  (Whats the rush?)\nWe were the only customer in the shop!!\n2.  I asked the waitress for two small plates but for some reason she decide to ignor my request. We were sitting at the bar so there are small plates all over. Under the counter and by the back bar where they display pastries. The waitress went to the back after I ask her for small plates and I waited for 5 minutes but she did not return. My dish with some shaved ice was sitting there slowly melting. Eventually I went to the back to ask for plate thats when she hurried came out  then took the plates there were on the counter top to us."

Glad we didn't have to wait long before being seated at the counter. \n\nDecided on their 2 course dessert set which started off with a coffee jelly dessert which was hella tasty.  Instead of using\n\nI decided on the mars which had a super cool presentation.  After the dessert is constructed, the waitress flambees some cognac which is later poured over the chocolate dome which then reveals the different layers underneath.

I know they had a soft opening and I called to confirm they were actually open today and my luck its their grand opening today!  So we pulled into their plaza and drove right past because I was looking for a sign! No sign but the people standing outside let me know something awesome was happening! We walked up to a red carpet entering the dessert restaurant and was greeted by a server and the chefs. We were able to sit with an awesome view at the bar watching all the magic happen. \n\nWe were handed the drink menu which consisted of coffee, cappucini, iced latte/americano, and an AWESOME list of hot teas. We went with an iced latte, iced americano, and a cappucino. We were then given our menus wrapped with a sugar ribbon. I actually ripped my menu pulling it out! The server let us know it was a pre fixe menu consisting if 3 courses amuse bouche, dessert, and petite four. There were 3 desserts to choose from the marriage had sponge cake, strawberry mousse, banana custard, fresh strawberry, fresh whipoed cream, fresh banana, white chocolate, and gold leaf. The Apollo which was chocolate and raspberry mousse, custard, chocolate sponge cake, earl grey ice cream, crispy chocolate rice square, a meringue stick, and dark chocolate. We didn't try the third because my mom and grams shared. \n\nAfter explaining the menu and ordering the server poured raspberry sauce on our plates and told us we could eat our menu! \n\nSo our coffees were awesome! The ice is made of espresso and they gave us simple syrup to sweeten it. Our amuse bouche was mango sorbet with mint jelly. The sorbet was smooth and soft no ice crystals at all. And the jelly worked perfectly without overpowering the mango. Our main courses were fantastic!!! Not too sweet and although there were many components they worked together! \nThe mariages banana custard was to die for! And the apolos earl grey ice cream had the great lemony/bitter note to set off the sweetness of the chocolate and raspberry. \n\nOur last course was a cocolate souffl\u00e9. Served with raspberry and passion fruit marshmallow. It was more like a lava cake but still amazing. It wasn't overly sweet and when you combined the souffle and marshmallow it was a perfect combo!\n\nSo a little tip- you are able to share for $12 for the 2nd person. So $31 total. You recieve 2 amuse bouche, one dessert, and 2 petite fours. Not too bad. \n\nIt was $69 for the 3 of us so a little steep but we had an awesome time and the show, the flavors, and all of the small details made it worth it! I will for sure be returning!!!"

Harmony and balance in flavors, not too sweet which is perfect for me bc I never had a sweet tooth my whole life except the last few years since sugar has become so addictive these days. My favorite was the primavera bc I prefer light fruity tart flavors. Mars was good too, maybe ringo might be better with apples...next time! Also got creme puff with Vanilla mouse and blackberry jam which was not overly sweet at all instead so light and nice tart that came through from blackberries. It also came with passion fruit marshmallow which my husband stole and a dark chocolate smooth ganache. Yummmmm\n\n\nCame back again for 2nd night in a row and had the most delicious peach champagne(not on the menu but I noticed the bottle in the glass wall). So crisp and light and not overly strong overpowering alcohol taste with nice aroma and taste of peach but not too sweet either. Ringo was soooo good with delicate thin apple candy shell, whole thing not too sweet...it was perfect with honey icecream and tart apples and whipped cream that hadn't been sweetened...amazing. Also had  the blueberry champagne sorbet....loved this too!!! Can't be happier with all these choices. Enjoyed all but Mars would be at bottom of list bc everything was so good with such a high benchmark only bc brandy alcohol was strong for me."

I had seen videos of this place on food blogs and immediately went to try it on my trip to Vegas. We got there at about 11:20pm (they are open late, till midnight, which is very cool). There was a line out the door, but understandably so. After about thirty minutes of waiting, I realized that everyone around me had buzzers and I did not. It was about 11:50pm at this point, and someone had just walked in and asked for a buzzer and was turned away because they said they already had booked up their wait until close. I was immediately heart-broken because I thought I wasn't going to be able to eat there. I decide to just wait in line and see what the servers would say. Amazingly enough, the girl allowed us to be the last customers. The staff is mostly Japanese (as that is where the pastry chef is) and were very sweet and on top of it all. They gave great service and kept the small restaurant very well managed. Our meals took about 30 minutes, but that is very quick for having freshly prepared, handmade, beautiful deserts. They are interactive as most of the deserts have one last preparation as they are in front of you. The pastries were delicious, light and airy, flavors bursting with every bite. It was a really neat experience. A two course desert for $15 is not too expensive at all. Anyone that has a bad review for this place is obviously entitled, rude, and does not understand the beauty and effort that goes into this art form!"

We placed our orders - a cheese tray, drinks and 5 desserts.  The cheese tray and drinks came promptly.  After 45 more minutes the waitress brought the 5 of us 3 macaroons and apologized for the wait.  After another 45 minutes 2 of the desserts were served.  Another 15 minutes and melted ice cream as the 2 of us who were served were trying to wait until the rest of us got served, 2 more desserts were served.  After another 10 minutes the waitress advised me my dessert would be another 3 minutes and asked me if I would like to cancel, which I did.  The way it was stated, I suspected my dessert was going to be much longer than 3 minutes.  The waitress apologized and stated that the desserts are made from scratch - we knew that, that's why we went. A 20 minute wait to be seated,  90 minutes for the first desserts, another 15 and another 10 minutes to be served (or not) is totally unacceptable.  Our total time there was 2 + hours, on a work night.  No one else appeared to be waiting more than 15 minutes.  Not bringing everything within 5 minutes so we could enjoy together was unacceptable.  Three macaroons and 3 apologies and nothing comped was unacceptable. I won't be going back."

As if in contrast to the more dark & savory Raku motif is perfect with a finish in the sweetly minimalistic white interior of Raku sweets.  They do serve as a compliment to each other in all things excellence, delicacy and deliciousness.  \n\nSweets' ambiance is a clean postmodern sterile envelope perfectly suited to accompanying the visually stunning dishes from the menu.  Handcrafted desserts created only by a sophisticated level of skill.  The entire menu is an experience in itself, like literally; the menu is written on an edible (rice?) paper and you may devour it with a warm tangy & sweet apricot sauce.\n\nOn to the tastes.  From the lunch prefixes we had a bevy of adequately sized portions including thimble cups of soups and a Japanese salad.  I had the lobster bisque-esque (lol, sorry) soup which was creamy & layered.  Just just the right touch of salt and a hint of lobster.  The salad was the kind you get at a Japanese restaurant with a dollop of some white potato salad type something.  \n\nI ordered the grilled salmon and ikura croissant sandwich.  Soft flaked croissant split and filled with salmon and micro greens with salmon roe on top laced with a creamy aioli.  Warm & toasty with little ocean salt pops of roe.  This reminds me of a Frenchier lox & bagels.  A great first act before the grand finale.\n\nFinish with a 2 course dessert.  First up a palate cleansing sorbet.  I think it was strawberry with mint jelly.  Then came the main event.  I had the Carib she got the tasse or lasse.  I cant begin to describe mine other than a microcosm of sweet custards and creams contained in a wine glass as a volcanic fruit lava pours down onto an ornate chocolate disc.  Mixing and melting over a civilization of Mmmm.  Hers was like an ala' mode sent down from heaven and guided by angel wings made of cotton candy.  But dat sugar sculpture doh!  \n\nShe has the sweet tooth in the relationship as I am the savory salty sea dog.  Either case we both are frothing to go back.

It is not a, \"Hey, want some ice cream or something?\" place; it is a, \"Let's have a culinary adventure!\" kind of place.\n\nWhen I first saw the menu, I was a little shocked by the price.  It's $19 for a three course prix fixe dessert tasting, plus a $5 split plate charge (since my husband and I wanted to share).  But, after watching everything that goes into the dessert, I see why it's that price.\n\nLet's go back to the beginning: when you walk in, it is a stark white, modern restaurant with this way cool wine rack/display.  I really dug the decor.  You sit down and in front of you is pretty much the coolest silverware you will ever see in your life.  A menu rolled up in a napkin holder thing is set in front of you.  You order, and then.....HOLD UP....the waitress pours some sauce on your plate.  What am I supposed to put in this sauce, you ask??  YOUR MENU.  The menu is freaking edible.  And so is the napkin ring holder thing it came in.  Oh my God, I would pay the money just for the experience of eating the menu.\n\nThe first course we had was a pumpkin and green tea pudding.  It was like a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and very light and tasty.  For our second course, we ordered the Mt. Fiji cake, which is apparently very popular in Japan.  It was a sponge cake with chesnut cream frosting on top.  Last, we had this mini lava cake with fruit flavored \"marshmallow\" type things.\n\nThe whole menu was excellent, but one of the best parts is that you get to watch the chefs make these beautiful pieces of sugar art right in front of you.  The detail in the desserts is awe inspiring.  Sweets Raku is a place I would take to impress people, and it is definitely a special occasion place to eat."

I highly doubt it. Raku, the savory side, swept me off my feet two years ago. And the sweet-offering sidekick has done it to me again.\n\nEnter this modern space to find a bar surrounding a dessert prep area where you can watch staff blowtorch, arrange, pour, roll, and form wondrous Japanese-style desserts. Like European pastries, Raku's creations are light and not too sweet. They also show great finesse in how they are presented and made. The flavors are so complex, and Raku's staff skillfully balance the rich and sweet with a little bit of tart. Do as they instruct, and eat everything the way they suggest. You won't have any regrets.\n\nTheir macarons are to die for, especially loved the green tea and red bean macaron. The fixed price, two-course menu option, with optional wine pairings, is a steal when you consider the level of expertise and work involved. I had the blueberry sorbet with the coconut panna cotta. Not only were these desserts beautiful to behold, they were also refreshing, sumptuous, and unique. \n\nTom N. described this as one of the highlights of his trip.

Seat at the bar if you can and watch them make the desserts.\n\nThere are only 5 dessert choices and the best way to have them is in the prix fixe. Each one has a theme and they are marvelous. The angle cake is a round mound with a edible halo and wings. The designs are simple but playful. \nthe prix fixe consisted of- the edible menu dipped in raspberry sauce, an amuse of sorbet & gelee, a choice of dessert and a tiny chocolate molton cake with tiny marshmellows and rum raisins. The apple pie was shaped like an apple, another dessert looked like a meatball covered in spaghetti. \n\nWe also got the caviar service which was good but not top notch. They use farmed caviar and didn't mention it until we were served. It has a weaker flavour than real caviar. But it was delight to layer the egg, onion and caviar on the tiny bread puffs.\n\nThey make excellent cappuccinos. They also have wine pairing for the desserts.\n\nThe space is wheelchair accessible, very good lighting. The servers was very sweet if rather soft spoken.\n\nTruly a magical place worth the trip off the strip."

It came in a wine glass and very beautifully presented.  They pour a warm strawberry sauce over a circle of white chocolate that acted like a lid to your glass in which the white chocolate melts and drops into your dessert. It was AMAZING! My visitor's dessert was made of puff pastry, fruit, and a pistachio cream. It was good but not as good as the primavera. I liked the fact the desserts were not too sweet and light tasting. Chef Mio...you should expand your business!"

We were the only customers at the time we went so we had the chance to sit at the table in front of the oven/kitchen. I love watching the lady meticulously prepare our desserts which I thought it was well worth the price. The desserts are on the expensive side but it's okay to treat yourself once in a while.\n\nWe started off with a wine flight which the wine came out in test tubes. The test tubes were so adorable. It also came with a small slice of cheese and tomatoes which were a little too strong in taste for me. They are supposed to wash out after each wine taste but I'm not quite fancy yet. Another dish we tried had mango chocolate in a wine glass. The lady placed a pink chocolate cover on the wine glass and poured something over it and melted the chocolate which fell into the dessert. That dessert was fun to eat.\n\nI absolutely love the raspberry sorbet. The sorbet was tiny but was sooo good. There were small chocolate pieces within the sorbet and I would taste the crunchiness every other bite. We also ordered a coconut dessert which was packed with a lot of different flavours. My tastebuds were confused as to what I was eating because each bite was different. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the desserts which were different than the typical bakeries/desserts served at other restaurants. The service was really nice as well. I highly recommend this place!"

Don't get me wrong, it was almost full and after we sat down, the line started to build outaide.\n\nSo you know, it's located in a very small shopping center with limited parkimg, and just like walking in we were lucky someone was just leaving as we were pulling in.  And there are 2 restaurants named Raku.   There is no \"sweet\" listed above the restaurant, but look for the wine bottle wall you'll know you have the right one.  the other Raku serves Japanese food and not these scumptious desserts!\n\nIt is small, so seating is limited and part of the reason a line builds.  I wish I had sat at the bar to watch them create these beautiful desserts.  Each one is made when ordered, not all sitting in a refrigerator.\n\nYes I ordered 3!  would've ordered 5 but I need  reason to come back with my girls...  My hubby had dinner here with me for our anniversary.  And he was in awhhh and surprised how great the desserts tasted.  Both light and sweet...  that's how I would describe them.

My first experience was in 2014 and I have been coming here almost every other month and as often as I can while living in Vegas.  Yes, that often and so worth every penny in my opinion.  Since moving away, every trip to Vegas now I have to visit at least once and purchase a large box macarons!  \n\nChef Mio is amazing with her creativity and patience.  She takes her time putting together her beautiful desserts as intricately as she possibly can.  English is her second language but she enjoys talking to her patrons to learn how they are enjoying their experience. \n\nDining here is more of an experience than just a get in and get out sort of place.  You must sit at the bar if at all possible, but if you're in a large party,  you'll be seated at a table.  The reason why you should sit at the bar is because the experience is like an art show.  You watch Chef Mio start from beginning to end and create a masterpiece through multiple steps.  I think just watching her assemble each plate is just as enjoyable as eating it.  Her desserts are definitely not for the average American because it is not heavy and overly sweet.  In my opinion, it is the perfect dessert to end a meal in Vegas.  \n\nWhat I like about Sweets Raku is that each season, they have a new set of desserts to reflect the ingredients of the season and often times rotate the popular items throughout the year.\n\nTea Selection - They have a limited selection of tea from Lupicia, which is a Japanese brand with very delicious fruity and floral tea flavors.  perfect to pair with the desserts.  My favorite is the supergrade oolong momo and the muscat.    \n\nThe kitchen is very cute and clean.  The bathroom, please visit the bathroom. It is so unique and quite fun to figure out how everything works.  \n\nService from the waiters is a hit or a miss.  Usually I request Yuka to help us since we have gotten to know each other a bit over the years of dining here."

Of course i noticed all the good reviews first, and i am a little disappointed and find it hard to believe that this many people really think the flavors and execution here was worth the money and hype. \n\nHere is a hint for people going that are planning to share the pre fixe menu it says that its $19..but if your sharing then its $24. Your better off getting two of the main desserts at $12/each and not taking the 1st and 3rd items from the pre fixe given that they are not large portions or really anything special. Same money but you get more for the money.. \n\nI don't want to repeat the same thing that few others have said... yes the place is clean, yes the desserts \"look\" nice, and its a nice concept...yada yada. But the flavors just do not jive, and in some cases it seems there is just too much going on to really appreciate the dessert. \n\nWhat i will add that not others have said is that i don't see the passion in this chef when making these creations one bit. Im very big on taking my business and money to a place who really enjoys what they are offering to their customers, and although the presentation is lovely, i don't see the chefs heart in the finished product. She is not very delicate, nor interactive at all, and i wasn't even enjoying watching her work since the look on her face wasn't as if she was even enjoying herself. She looked more of like an assembly line worker who was just \"going through the motions\" and throwing something together to get an end product and not a work of art or beautiful creation. I wanted to like this place... but it falls far short as i have easily had better desserts for a 1/4 of the cost and from a restaurant and not a dessert specific location like this."

You can see a huge wine display in front with a very white clean interior. I took two friends here on a friend's suggestion where \"you can even eat the menu.\" That alone sold me. What intrigue! And the idea of a prix fixe (~$19) dessert menu for a dessert lover like me is a match made in heaven. I highly suggest going with a couple people so you  can try their desserts, too. ;] \n\nMenu- a scroll of rice paper with a pulled sugar ring, with a raspberry sauce dip.  \nFirst course was a strawberry sorbet with mint gelee. \nSecond course you get to pick 1 of 5 choices. Though the waitress described all the desserts quickly and thoroughly, I could only catch a few words here and there. But she had such enthusiasm, that I didn't want to make her repeat herself. \n-angel cream: light, airy, not too sweet, lots of cream, mango pieces buried beneath, wings of white chocolate, and a halo of pulled sugar. \n-apple pie: a little too sweet for me, fun to eat, lots of components... \n-mt fuji: looked like spaghetti with mocha flavored crisps, had a mature taste, would go great with hot tea. \nThird course was a petite four: chocolate molten lava cake with dried fruit and fruit flavored soft squares. I don't know how else to describe them.. but it was good and I finished the whole thing.. \n\nI loved sitting at the counter and seeing them make everything right before my eyes. It was cool seeing them prepare for the next day as well. The service was great, almost ninja like as I never noticed when they refilled my water. The bathroom was pretty neat, too. Check this place out! You won't be disappointed."

(Minus the claustrophobia at the bar.) The kitchen was very pretty and orderly. The waitstaff were also just so nice. :D\n\nYou can eat the menu and dip it in a delicious apricot sauce. I tried to see if the plates or the glasses were edible too. They were not. \n\nWe tried the Mt. Fuji, Petit Four, Carib, and sorbet with jelly. Each dish was a work of art and they all tasted delicious. You get to chose what flavors you want for the filling in the Petit Four. I went with chocolate and blackberry, buuuuut I also enjoyed vanilla with raspberry. \n\nWhen they finish making the Carib, they pour a sweet sauce on top and the chocolate disk melts right into the glass. \n\nSwitching topics to their very popular side feature. The bathroom is far too cool. The toilet is also a bidet and the lid automatically shut. The controls for it are on the right and you can adjust the settings. And even better: the seat warmed up! (I want that toilet. Haha.)\n\nThe sink was cool too. There was a little (statue) frog and some plants inside. The water does jet out and kind of splashes against your hands, but ehhh. \n\nOh, and the price for each person runs to be about $25. \n\nI AM COMING BACK SOON! :D"

The first option is an amuse or you can purchase single desserts for $12. You can also purchase a cream puff for $5. If you did want 3 courses, it'd be the $20 as opposed to the $19 it was a year ago. \n\nThey no longer have the menu items on the rice paper. It is going to be a menu with the different desserts on there. They do still have the rice paper for you to eat. When I went, it was an apricot sauce. \n\nI had the mango amuse with a mint jelly which was pretty good. It most definitely had an authentic taste. It tasted just like a mango. My friend got the carib which is a coconut panna cota. It was very delicious, and cool. What they do is the have a piece of chocolate on top. Then they some hot ( I think it was mango), and melted the chocolate on top. It was super cool! The dessert I got was the Nasri which had a fake pear made out of sugar! It was very unique looking. There was a sorbet of some sorts. I'm not sure what flavor it was. But it went really well with the pie. I think it might have been a pear pie, but it was really crisp and flaky and amazing. \n\nThe service was decent. At one point, I ran out of water, and no one filled it up for me.

The $20 pre-fixe includes an amuse-bouche palate cleanser, your choice of main dessert, and ends with petit-fours you can customize by flavor and filling.\n\nAmuse was a flavorful pineapple sorbet topped with lychee jelly.\nThe CARIB is visually stunning, served in a wine glass covered with a candy lid that is melted with heated fruit sauce as it is served falling into the glass to mix with the other ingredients prior to eating: fruits, custard, caramelized banana, and mango jelly combine harmoniously.  By far one of the more unique desserts I've tried. \nThe MT. FUJI is a delicate sponge cake with custard, topped with delicate ribbons of coffee-flavored cream and shards of chocolate. This dessert was more in line with what I look for in desserts, and seems to be a safer menu option.\nOther options are the STELLA (strawberry tiramisu), the RED ROCK (raspberry lava cake), and the BATON (pistachio cream in chocolate tube). \nThe PETIT FOURS, similar to profitroles, available in customized flavor fillings and jellies. Raspberry and black currant was a good combination. Presentation even for this simple ending is beautiful, completed by a smear of citrus sauce and two house-made marshmallows.\n\nAll of the desserts look amazing, and with the amount of business they get in the evening you are sure to see them all. Unique place to experience even if you're not a dessert person, definitely a place I'd suggest all locals go at least once for a sweet date night.

Luckily, they are in the same strip mall so we trotted off to Raku, only to find we had about an hour wait. When on vacation, there are no rules, so we traced our path back to Sweets Raku and had dessert first!\n\nThis place is tiny (a few tables and the dessert bar where you can sit and watch them make your courses). It's all white and the servers are very sweet. For $19, you get a 3-course prix fixe dessert service like none other. \n\nThey start by bringing you a rolled up menu with a gold ring encircling it. After picking what you want, they pour a raspberry sauce on a plate and you dip you menu in it and eat it. Not only unique, it was actually quite good. You can even eat the gold ring.\n\nAfter the menu eating, you start with an Amuse. Ours was mango sorbet with mint jelly. I'll be honest, it looked and sounded not so good. But damn if it wasn't good! Super refreshing.\n\nThen you pick your main dessert from four selections. I chose the coconut panna cotta and my daughter had the pistachio & chocolate mousse. Both excellent and unique. They topped mine with some sort of wafer, poured sauce on top of that, and instead of overflowing, it melted or collapsed the wafer and the liquid into the serving dish. A show and a dessert in one.\n\nYou end with a petit four, equally odd and equally good. It's really hard to explain so I'll just suggest that you go there some time and try it. It's worth it and if you're a visitor like me, it's so refreshing to get off the Strip for just one evening.\n\nI also had an excellent cappucino with my dessert, complete with a crystalized sugar stick.\n\nDELISH!

Not a big deal right? WRONG. It was the perfect temperature and you watch them inject fresh cream of your choosing into it."

            "review": "Maybe I haven't seen the world enough, but this was probably my favorite/best dessert experience so far in my life. I was so excited from the moment I stepped inside. I was in search of dessert after dinner and just found this on yelp. I guess they've been open for 10 months. It's a Japanese dessert place. \n\nThe shop: It's mostly bar seating around an open kitchen. There are maybe 3-4 4 person tables on the side. My friend and I grabbed a seat at the bar. Best spot! I went to the bathroom, and srsly, my first time writing a review about it, but it had those Japanese styled toilets. Seat warmer, fancy buttons that I did not use. I've never been to Japan, but I'd imagine this is what it's like. Best bathroom ever. haha. The place is ran by a few Japanese ladies in their 30s/40s maybe? Very pleasant/nice/smiley staff. They make the dessert on the spot for you. Everything is precut/pre-baked, but they build the desserts on demand. So for example, your cake has a few layers, so they'll put it together like they're creating an art piece. It was very cool to watch. Kinda like sitting at the sushi bar with the sushi chef putting building your omakase dinner, but w/ desserts instead! The menu is made out of edible wafer that you can later rip up and eat with this fruit sauce they give you. The sauce was good, but the menu wafer wasn't really anything, but just a fun idea! \n\nDrinks: They serve wine (and maybe other alcoholic beverages, didn't pay much attention) and tea! The portions are pretty small though. One pot per person in terms of serving size. We tried the apple green tea and peach black tea. Not sweetened. I liked both! \n\nDesserts: We decided to go with the 3 course dessert, yes after dinner already. You can either do that or just get the \"main dessert entree.\" With the prix fixe, we started it off with a small dollop of mango sorbet. It was just ok. I'm not a huge fan of sorbet to begin with. The main dessert entree we tried he Strawberry Tiramisu and Angel Cake (some pear thing). There were 5 choices I think. Hard to choose. The Strawberry Tiramisu didn't really taste like what I imagined from my Tiramisu experiences in the past, BUT it was soooo good!! The little cake on the bottom was amazing. I don't have any other descriptive words to use. The side is drizzled w/ some mousse/cream? so good!! and fruits. 5 star for dessert and presentation! The Angel Cake is like 6 star for presentation! It looks like an Angel! with a Halo and White Chocolate wings. The cream on the cake was very light and yummy. The Strawberry Tiramisu was probably 0.5 stars better than this Pear one, but still very worth it and good. The third course was a cream puff with your choice of vanilla or chocolate custard and choice of fruit filling. Pretty good. If I came again though, I could do without the 3 course thing and jump right to the main dessert entree!\n\nPrices: Main dessert entrees were $12. Three course dessert was $19. Tea was $4.50. I would say a bit heftier in price, but not terribly high and totally worth it!\n\nOverall, I think these desserts are very suitable for the Asian palette. I can see my parents liking it. I normally do ok with regular desserts, but at times it does get heavy and rich. NOT HERE!! Everything is so light! After we were done, I felt like I could do one more (just bc i wanted to try something else), but didn't as not to be a major fatty. Check their hours of operation as it differs depending on day of the week and is a bit tricky. I will definitely come back here when in town!!"

I love the all white decor- the brightness of everything just adds an extra touch to the ambiance.\n\nI had gone in there on a Friday evening with my husband and his cousin to try dessert, since it's been on my bucket list for quite some time.\n\nWe each ordered our own tasting menu. I was a bit sad because this was 2 course tasting menu, and I had seen through other reviews that there was three course prix fix menu. But I couldn't find it. (I really wanted to try that edible menu.. Maybe next time.) With the tasting menu, you get a choice or two sorbets ( I chose the Coconut) and a main plate (I chose the Mars). \n\nWhen we our sorbets- I really like the small presentation in a demitasse. And When received my Mars dessert, I was blown away by the presentation I love the white chocolate dome that looked like Mars, and the server had a torch and torched some alcohol and poured it over the dessert, it as really cool. The flavors were real nice as well, not too sweet and some hazelnut in there for texture. I do wish the alcohol was cooked off a little bit longer though, because it left a strong flavor at the bottom every time I went in for another scoop.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this place. Just maybe one thing about service though, I wish the servers would speak up a little bit. It was kinda hard to hear them, and the noise level at that time wasn't too loud. But they did a great job.\n\nI will be back for more especially because they now have a \"Savory Menu\" for me to try"

The second course is your pick from the Today's menu. And the third course is chef's special. \nThey are doing soft opening by invitations only i think. Their grand opening is August 6th. \nThis restaurant is small, maybe 20 seats. The decor is simple. The space is very opened and well lit. They have a bar and you can watch them making your desserts. \nI had mango sorbet with mint jello as the first course. The mint jello balanced out the sweet and sour of the mango sorbet. It was such a great start. \nThe second course i tried named apollo. It's basically chocolate and raspberry mousse with chocolate sponge cake and fresh cream ice cream. The meringue and the chocolate crispy rice came with it was so good. Everything comes well together and it's not too sweet. \nAlso in the second course choice was the marriage. It is banana sponge cake, banana pudding, strawberry mousse and white chocolate decorations. It was ok.\nThe last course was the lava chocolate cake with pineapple and raspberry marshmallow. It was the sweetest dessert overall. The size of it was small, its such a right portion to finish off 3 courses desserts meal. \nI love their concept: a little sour to start off the meal, a little bit of sweet as the main course, and a sweeter desserts to finish off the meal as dessert. They did a very good job to balance out the sweetness, it's not too overwhelming. \nHowever 3 courses desserts might be a bit too much, i might not come back anytime soon. It's a meal by itself. \nOh their coffees and teas are very good too."

            "review": "I've had the pleasure dining at Raku twice now.  Based on the service and food there, I knew this place would not disappoint.  Upon walking in, you wait in line.  Once you are halfway to the front of the line, a staff member gives you a beeper to let you know when you will be seated.  This type of wait list is way too confusing and inefficient.  I can only assume the problem is that they do not have enough beepers to hand out to everyone so you have to wait in line until the beepers can circulate as diners leave the restaurant.  To solve this problem, a simple sign up sheet would do the trick.  \n\nThe GF and I waited close to an hour to get seated.  We sat at the end of the counter, so we managed to get a little privacy, and at the same time, had a great view of the pasty chefs at work.  We decided on the dessert set, which consisted of an amuse for each of us, the primavera, and a puffy cup.  The amuse was delicious.  It tasted like a creamy, frothy, jello.  Even though it was so small, it packed a ton of flavor. \n\n Next we tried the primavera.  The presentation was worthwhile.  We saw them making it, and it clearly takes a lot of work to create this dessert.  There are so many layers and toppings.  The dessert itself was just okay.  I thought it was overly sweet, even though  there was some tartness from the sorbet and fruit.    \n\nThe puffy cup came next, which was a light and airy souffle.  It was very delicious.  A small dish of mango and jelly was served alongside it.  I tried pairing it with the souffle.  I did not really notice any change in flavor.  I did however, think they tasted good on their own.   \n\nI would recommend giving this place a try.  The wait may be a bit strenuous, but all in all, it was worth it."

For $7 extra you can get a wine paring with your main dessert. The desserts are pretty good but the best part of it it's the amount of detail that they have. So many ingredients and decorations that makes this place very unique. The only bad part is that it could take a long time to get your dishes. I went with two of my girlfriends and we all ordered at the same time, but got the dishes at different times.... each five minutes after the other. They did not coordinate and bring all the dishes at the same time, which was very inconvenient! If you are a sucker for warm \"lava\" you must get the red rock! Instead of warm chocolate it's a soft cake filled with strawberry! It was delicious!! The Mt Fuji was also very good, but you should only get it if you like chocolate and tons of frosting! We also tried the carib which is perfect for someone who is not that into sweets and prefers a refreshing dessert!  Overall, a must try at least once in your lifetime!"

Also the place is absolutely TINY so if the place is full you're kind of SOL.  Went there with a group of four and the place was full.  They don't have a waiting area so you have to just stand in the entry way which can be uncomfortable.  Luckily a group left not too long after we got there so we didn't have to wait too long.  Sitting at the counter is definitely the way to go as you can watch them hand craft each dessert to order.\n\nI ordered the Ringo, which is pretty much an apple pie a la mode, but elevated into a work of art.  The \"apple\" on the place is some sort of edible candy filled with cream and caramel I think.  My wife had the Mars.  I have no idea what the candy dome is made out of but when they serve it to you the chef heats a small tin of brandy I believe with a torch until it flames.  Then they pour it over the dessert and the dome melts away to reveal the cream and fruits underneath the dome.  Very cool.\n\nIf you're looking for a unique and cool place for dessert off the strip you MUST stop by Sweets Raku."

Sisters and I tried the Ringo, Spring mtn, and Mars during lunch on a Sunday. Spring mountain was delicious and tarte, good if you like pistachio. Mars was very small in my opinion and the Hennessey overpowered the chocolate. Ringo was the best and the largest of the desserts. Pretty much an apple tarte with honey ice cream. Waiter was very bubbly and nice and the chef too. Desserts are really delicious, but for $12 each youre better off going to Jean Phillippe in bellagio or aria nearby. They have a $15 option including a scoop of the daily sorbet. Also each person has to buy their own dessert and theres an automatic 20% tip for parties over 6."

I've worked in the hospitality industry for 7 years & always empathize with the establishment before myself. \n\n1. The Wait - waiting for a table will take you at least 30 minutes (if your lucky), but probably a full hour. This is mainly due to the fact that they will not seat any party other than the next in line- despite empty single seats at the bar & multiple open 2-tops. So if you are a party of 2 standing behind a party of 4 that ONLY wants to sit at the bar... You have to wait for them to be seated, even if the rest of the tables are empty.\n\n2. The Service - our male server was of course polite ... he didn't make any suggestions on what was good, didn't try to sell us on dessert wine, nothing. The table next to us who was sat 2 parties after us (15 min after us) got their dessert first. No problem. We get our first dessert & while waiting for the second... another table that got sat after us got the same dessert we were waiting for. Then as I see the dessert we were waiting for... ANOTHER TABLE that got seated after us received it. Finally, after everyone else in the restaurant received all of their desserts- we got ours. \n\n3. The Food - as basic as basic could be. The flavor profiles were nothing to write home about. Even the little \"tricks\" that they do with melting chocolate shells with a hot sugary sauce could not compensate for the lack of vibrance these desserts had to offer."

If you're not dining on The Strip, you'll most likely be dining in nondescript strip malls in neighborhoods that you don't want to be caught walking at night. Still they are worth the drive/cab fare because the local foodie scene can be just as a fun experience as any Strip eating experience, as well as being a bit more reasonably priced. You just have to know exactly what you're looking for.\n\nI wanted to take the No1DP out for a meal to celebrate his belated birthday and my appreciation for him being such a wonderful boyfriend by letting me tag along with him this trip. \n\n---\nCAB FARE: ~$14 to the Palazzo base fare.\n\nVENUE: Located in a strip mall off Spring Mountain, the restaurant is very small with about half the guests being in tables and the other half sitting at the bar. If you are a foodie, SIT AT THE BAR. You'll see two dedicated and passionate pastry chefs make your desserts with such care and attention to your dish. Walls are almost bare so as not to distract you from the desserts - part of the experience is to watch them make your dessert.\n\nAs it's a small space, call ahead for approximate wait times. They do not take reservations.\n\nSERVICE: No1DP may be used to Japanese waitstaff but I thought the waitress serving us was very cheerful and polite. Her accent was so thick that I couldn't get the descriptions of the desserts so I had to ask the pastry chefs to explain again as I scrawled it on a napkin. \n\nPRIX FIXE ($19, $7 with wine)\nNo1DP noticed that the menu was made with a type of paper that you could actually eat and tore off a piece. This was confirmed by the waitress; after placing our orders she brought a plate with a raspberry sauce for us to dip our menus. The menu tastes like edible paper that is best dipped with the raspberries. The ring that holds the menu is also edible, we saw more rings being made in the counter.\n\nThe 3-couse prix fixe consists of the following\nAmuse\nBoth of us started with kabocha pudding (green tea sauce, chocolate and kabocha chip). Texture is similar to black sesame pudding I've had at another Japanese restaurant. There is a mild but evident sweetness in the dish that is offset by the pumpkin. This was also the only dish we didn't see made.\n\nMains\nNo1DP had Apollo (chocolate and raspberry mouse mousse, chocolate cake, earl grey ice cream). Japanese desserts are not known for their richness though you could still taste the chocolate and raspberry. No1DP liked his dish and wine pairing enough that he was willing to risk getting a migraine to enjoy his dessert wine. As a fan of earl grey tea, he also enjoyed his ice cream.\n\nI had Mt. Fuji (chestnut cake, chestnut paste, custard creme, Hennessy syrup). I got to see my dessert being made from start to finish. Apparently they use some contraption to make the chesnut cream take shape, followed by refrigerating the dish to let the cream hold. Chesnuts were slightly crunchy and chesnut cream and cake were light and fluffy. My wine was a slightly tart white wine to add but not overload the chestnuts.\n\nPetit Four\nAs the No1DP's dish contained chocolate, his petit four was a small piece of cheesecake that contained REAL cheese on the top. No1DP notes that the portion was light, delicate and small enough for him, otherwise he would have had a dessert overload.\n\nMy petit four was the traditional small lava cake with raisins and raspberry and passion fruit decorated on the side. I saw how committed to perfection the chefs are as they erased any imperfections with a napkin and redid the decoration. Raisins and marshmallows were light. Lava cake was small enough as a finishing dish yet contained all the components of a good lava cake - fluffy yet firm cake with hot molten chocolate in the center.\n\nAs we left the waiters noticed that we were from out of town and thanked us wholeheartedly for stopping by. Considering that I rarely go off-strip to eat anything seeing warm genuine service with a smile was much appreciated. \n\nFinal word: Go here if you want a new meaning/experience to eating desserts, which in most instances are often rush and shoe-horned at the end of meals. Don't go here if you just want to grab a quick sweet or if you like your desserts rich."

I felt a little guilty for holding them up but they were very nice and gladly sat us down, offering us their coffee and other drinks menu. There were a few other couples in the middle of their meals, so it wasn't an awkward closing time. They are pretty popular so it makes sense that they would have stragglers coming in so late (it was almost midnight). \n\nSERVICE: Quick, fun, friendly. When I told them neither my boyfriend nor I have ever been to Sweets Raku, their eyes lit up as they presented us their EDIBLE menu and explained to us the rest of their sweets on the menu, including a three-course dessert.\n\nFOOD: We decided to skip the three-course and go straight for the main dessert course. We quickly chose the Marriage dessert choice and the Apollo dessert choice. Let's start off with Marriage: Dominate in the strawberry and shortcake flavors, with some kind of strawberry-raspberry gelee and an edible golden flake atop the banana pudding in the centre of the masterpiece. Apollo was mostly chocolate chocolate chocolate, and I was okay with that =) now for the best part of the desserts.... THE EARL GREY ICE CREAM! It came perched above three layers of strawberry and chocolate mousses and chocolate cake. At first we thought it was a Fruity Pebbles Ice Cream (it really really REALLY tastes like fruity pebbles), but they told us later when we asked. \n\nBill for a large cappucinno and two delicious main course desserts, with a $10 tip came out to almost $40. \n\nOverall a great experience and well worth the money.

However they don't allow outside food, my child is on a special diet and brings his own food wherever we go. We didn't know this before coming and there were no signs on the door.

Plus the customer service was not very good. They were slow, didn't seem confident when explaining the menu, and I had to ask to get my water filled. The sweets were delicious; they are not however amazing for them to be so pricy. You can find the same quality desserts at a casino with much faster and better customer service. I tried 4 out of their 6 main deserts, since I am not expecting to return I wanted to take advantage of the visit. They were tasty and the presentation was exceptional. Perfect example of \"looks matter\" and how we're willing to pay top dollar for looks. Thanks to the presentation I'm giving them an extra star. If I'd return I would buy to go, not dine in."

One person went to one corner the other was looking around the block, another was in the middle of the parking lot trying to get a GPS signal for location. We finally found the place which is next to Big Wong. *Phew wiping sweat off forehead*\n\n1 point...The presentation of the food was fancy but the taste was not a wow factor. I had the apple pie with no ice cream, so they substituted white chocolate square instead. \n\n1 point...Friendly staff and very accommodating. Our group of 6 wanted to sit at the counter and they made it happen.\n\nFirst and last time coming here. It's to expensive and the service is slow and I'm lactose intolerant.

The service is very attentive and friendly. our waitress explained and answered all of our questions with a smile of her face. My bf and I ended up sharing a tasting. The menu is edible....and it tastes like paper. For some reason I thought it would taste like white chocolate...I don't know why, but it was far from it. It was seriously like eating paper and raspberry sauce. The Amuse was pretty good, and Veil was really delicious. The Petit Four with the Lava Cake was interestingly good, No complaints. In the end this place is just really great for the experience."

I've been here twice now and noticed they do not serve the edible menus anymore but still a very cool experience to check out at least once.  \nThis place is hard to find if you are not familiar with the area but it is located in the Monta/Big Wong parking lot and has a small sign that says Raku outside.  There is the Raku restaurant and Sweets Raku which is the dessert restaurant.  You'll know you're in the right place when you just see a wall of wine bottles displayed leading into a white almost sterile looking room.  There are about 3-4 tables and a bar where the pastry chefs are creating your sweets right in front of you.  It's a much better experience sitting at the bar and watching the chefs.  They serve a few savory dishes, and hot teas and wine but we just went with a dessert each and skipped the tea/wine.  I ordered the Ringo and my boyfriend ordered the Jack in the Cup.  \nThe Ringo is their take on a deconstructed apple pie with a side of ice cream and an candied \"apple\" filled with a pastry cream.  \nThe Jack in the Cup was a chocolate cinnamon souffle with a side of ice cream.   When the desserts are served, they are presented and each component is explained much better than I just did, but unfortunately I don't remember the details.  Although the Jack in the Cup doesn't look like much in a still picture, the big \"cool\" factor is when the souffle rises.  Both desserts are a good size for one, they are not huge and not super sweet, but the experience is definitely watching the chefs work.  *if you're a tea fan they serve Lupicia brand tea leaves"

The desserts here are really works of art, made in front of you while you watch, as long as you sit at the counter.  I've always chosen to sit there because that's where you get to see the art-making in action. \nWhen they first opened, Sweets Raku had edible menus, which was definitely a wow factor.  Those are long gone, though, but the quality of the product has not changed over the years.  It's still a very popular destination, though, so be prepared to wait for seating.  And, as mentioned in other reviews, parking for this plaza can be scarce so be prepared to walk, too.\nMy favorite dessert here is the Ringo, which is a candy apple, honey ice cream, and apple pie.  Crack that apple and get to eating.  But, first, with almost any of the desserts here, you almost feel guilty for ruining them because they are so lovely.  That's why you take lots of pictures first.  \nDefinitely a must-try if you have never been."

Although it can get a little pricey, I definitely think that each penny spent is well worth it and here's why:\n\nSERVICE:\nThe servers and pastry chefs were all wonderful and had great customer service skills. They explained each dessert item very well and were also very good at conversing with us. Through their explanation, you can really get a sense of what the dessert was. They were also very good at making recommendations. All of them were great and really added to the whole experience!\n\nTHE DESSERT:\nThe dessert was amazing! Not only did they look great being made right in front of you, they tasted even better! I do recommend getting a seat at the bar as it heightens your experience by seeing how they made each dessert. During my first ever visit, I ended up trying their Carib, which was by far the highlight of my whole dessert dining experience. It was delicious, to say the least--the right amount of sweetness, great textures, and mixing of flavors you didn't think would taste good together. Definitely a must try! I also got the chef's special that night, which was a coconut strawberry sorbet. That too was really delicious! As far as my friends, they ended up ordering the Sunset and the blueberry champagne sorbet. For me personally, the Sunset was a little too tart/sour and was lacking in sweetness. The blueberry champagne sorbet as well had an overpowering taste of champagne in it. Granted they were good, they were not to my full liking. I did greatly enjoy the desserts that I ended up ordering.\n\nOTHER OPTIONS:\nAside from desserts, this place also offers a savory menu. I think this is very smart of them to have this option as although they are predominantly a dessert place, they can cater to those that want something savory to eat first, followed by an indulgence in something sweet. To pair up with the savory dishes, this place also offers a variety of red and white wines. All compliment their savory dishes very well. If wine is not your thing, Sweets Raku also offers varying flavors of tea. The strawberry vanilla tea was really good as well and I highly recommend it.\n\nLOGISTICS:\nThis place is located in a plaza with other varying Asian restaurants and dessert places. The parking can get a bit packed since there are so many options to go to in this plaza. Also, make sure not to confused this place with their presumed sister restaurant offering Japanese cuisinei that is also called Raku. Like stated before, it is recommended to sit in the bar area to see how the desserts are made!\n\nOverall, one of the best dessert experiences that I have ever had. Sweets Raku is one of a kind. I have yet to experience nor taste anything as delicious and as original as this place!"

            "review": "Let's make this clear before I begin...I LOVE RAKU...LOVE!  That's why i was so excited to hear about this dessert bar opening.  I thought it was a fresh idea to have in Vegas.  Like the other reviews the restaurant itself is spot on.  All white...great plates, glasses, tea pots, tea cups, silverware, they have a modern twist on them all.  I was so close in snagging a spoon for my ice cream at home. LOL!  Restroom was very cool, but I don't know how long that remoted controlled toilet will last and I figure someone sooner or later will think the sink is a trash can, but whatever it's still very cool.\n\nNow, let me get to the part why i gave it 2 stars.  Lets get to the desserts...\n\nAmuse:\nStrawberry sorbet with mint jelly.  This was a strawberry sorbet you could get anywhere nothing spectaculor about it.  The mint jelly had no flavor and I feel was simply there for texture.  Not impressed.\n\nApollo:\nRaspberry mousse and a thin layer of custard in between two layers of chocolate mousse topped with fresh raspberries.  Again, I did not see anything great of this dish just a typical dessert you can get anywhere.\n\nMarriage:\nStrawberry mousse, banana custard, sponge cake, fresh berries, white chocolate and whipped cream with gold leaf. This looked awesome, but tasted again like any other dessert.  Truthfully the sponge cake was dry and not that moist.\n\nPetit Four:\nChocolate lava cake lightly dusted with powdered sugar, raspberry marshmallows and passion fruit marshmallow. Cool idea with the flavored marshmallows, but the chocolate lava cake was too bitter and nothing on the plate to balance it.  \n\nI must add that I did think making the menu being edible was fun and creative.  \n\nI did receive the goodie bag and I have to say that I was more impressed with the goodie bag than what I had in the restaurant.  The madelines were kinda of dry, but the almond brittle was really good and the chocolate cake was very moist...tasted like there was fruit or something inside and the chocolate top had a nice snap to it.  \n\nBased on the quality of Raku I had extrememly high expectations and maybe that's where it all went wrong.  Presentation is great, but is the flavor or presentation better than say going to Jean Phillip...No!  These were really just typical french style desserts.  I was expecting something more creative from Raku using more inspired japanese or asian ingredients."

We had to wait about 15 minutes on a Saturday night for our group of 6 which was split up, but later on we were all together again after a couple had left. My husband and I both got the prix fixe menu and it didn't disappoint! We got to sit at the bar and see all the action which was pretty neat. I decided on the Mt. Fuji, because I saw the \"noodles\" and I knew that is what I wanted. Turns out it was not noodles but awesome deliciousness. My husband ordered the Apollo and I just remember it being very chocolately. I did order a peach tea....but I should know that I am not a big fan of black tea. I loved the smell, but I needed honey or something which isn't the correct way to drink the tea anyways. \n\nService was awesome. I could probably sit there all day and watch these ladies work their magic. It was a bit hot in there, but with the steamer and oven constantly working that is expected. My friend in our group just ordered the apple pie. I think that is what I will order next time I come back! I loved everything and the details of it is exactly what Raku is all about. \n\nP.S.

We go the chocolate souffl\u00e9 and the strawberry shortcake. We also got the raspberry sorbet. The sorbet was good but nothing special at all. I would say the texture and taste is the equivalent of a flinestone push pop. The chocolate souffl\u00e9 was light and fluffy but I wish it had more bananas and less of that cinnamon liquid in the middle. It came with vanilla foam... Or at least that was the texture of the ice cream. Maybe it's on purpose?\n\nMy strawberry shortcake was the biggest disappointment of all. It took the lady ten minutes to assemble all the layers but it tasted like any plain cake you can get at any bakery. It came with small pieces of cut fruit (two grapes, one raspberry). Definitely not worthy ten dollars. I wish they had the Carib that everyone raves about but it's no longer on the menu. I would have much rather gotten Kung fu tea or snow ice next door."

As we parked, we were looking for restaurant sign, but couldn't seem to find it. We ended up walking to their sister restaurant, Raku, and the lovely lady came outside of the restaurant to point to where we should have been.

So we ended up moving over to the bar so that we could observe the dessert chefs making our desserts.\n\nThe menus were brought to us... COOLEST THING EVER... The menus are edible!

It was absolutely amazing, and shaped into a Yummy angel. NOTE: I LOVE HOW ALL OF THEIR DESSERTS ARE NOT CRAZILY SWEET. They are all filled with LOVE, and not too much sugar! (Diet friendly). My friend also chose the Prix fixed dessert, and chose the Chestnut cake. It was also a light dessert, amazingly PERFECT!\n\nOTHER THINGS I LOVE: The ambiance is just so soothing. The decor is a very modern chic, with white on white furniture! Simple, yet Beautiful! I love the utensils and their setup! I love the wonderful and cheerful chefs and servers. I just love this place and will be back every single month! I want to go back just writing about it! Sigh... Lol.\n\nTo conclude: No matter what mood you are in, dessert is always the way to go, but always remember... STRESSED is DESSERTS spelled backwards ;)"

Tried the prix fixe menu $19 which consisted of a pineapple sorbet with white wine jelly as 1st course, then Angel Cream (fromage pear) for 2nd course, and a cream puff with chocolate custard.  The menu they present to you is actually edible.  Just break it open and after you select what you want and tell the waitress, you can tear it apart and dip in raspberry sauce to eat.   The desserts I had  tasted like heaven!  I have a serious sweet tooth and although these were not on the super sweet side they were delicate yet so decadently delicious!  We sat at the bar and watched as our selections were created which was awesome to see.   They also sell macaroons freshly made to go and other goodies to!   Enjoyed and savored every bite and want to go back to taste the other entree selections next time."

From the moment you walk in, you can tell the place is clean, the food looks delicious, and the incredible culture of the restaurant is like no other. \n\nThis isn't just a dessert place. It's an entire experience. We went there on a Friday night around 9 pm. We were very lucky to have found a table quickly, but after we were seated a line started to form near the door. I recommend coming here a bit earlier or having someone visit the restaurant first because the restaurant is pretty small. \n\nPrice: With the amount of detail, work, and the quality of the food used, it is reasonably priced. For four people, the bill came out to $54. There were also wine pairing options and a special sorbet we could add on as well. However, we wanted to enjoy the desserts just as they were. We got the apple pie dessert, 2 mars, and mount fuji. All were delicious!!! I would go back again to try the apple pie. \n\nAmbiance: The decor is clean and sleek. Everything is white so you can tell the restaurant takes health code standards seriously. You get to watch the pastry chef, and sometimes the owner, create the dishes right in front of you. I recommend grabbing a seat at the bar so you can see the desserts being created. There is so much love, attention to detail, and quality that goes into each dish! I understand why they are so popular. \n\nFood: The apple pie came with a sugar apple that has mascarpone and caramel in it. Then there was a side of honey ice cream and the apple pie itself. Be careful biting into the sugar apple pie! Our friend cut his tongue on the leaf because it was so sharp. The Mars was an interesting presentation. It was covered with a soft of chocolate that looked like Mars. When it served the server poured a warm sauce over the dish and the chocolate melted to reveal delicious berries in the middle. The Mount Fuji has chocolate chestnut with chocolate chestnut cream and a sponge cake in the middle. This was my least favorite dish, but still great. They also serve non-dessert foods, which we hope to come back and try again one day. \n\nDrinks: They do serve alcohol here. However, we came here from dinner and already polished a bottle of wine before coming. So we didn't get anything to drink here. If you enjoy pairing wine with you dessert, then I recommend trying their wine pairing recommendations. \n\nOverall, I give this place a 5-star. The experience was impeccable and I can't wait to go back here again!"

It was definitely nothing to write home about and it was extremely small.\n\nThe second item that we each got were Mount Fuji and Mars.  I must say, these two were very good.  Mars had a strong alcohol taste to it but VERY good and Mount Fuji is essentially Mont Blanc, which was excellent.\n\nThe reason why I cannot give this place 5-stars is because it's way too expensive.  The chef is extremely talented and I loved the desserts but $12 per item is a bit steep.  It's worth a try for anyone visiting Las Vegas but I'm not sure if I'd go back considering the high cost.\n\nA word of advice: Be warned that they have a one dessert MINIMUM per person."

Having been fans of Raku for years (before they got super popular), we were hoping to get in on our latest visit. Luck was with us...we walked in around 9pm and there was NO LINE. Wow, yay!  By the time we left, there were about 20 people in line.\n\nAnyhoo, hubby went a la carte with the Mt. Charleston.  I did the 2-course thing with Mars and also got the plum sparking wine cocktail.\n\nReally, nothing beats sitting at the bar.  Although it felt like the ladies had the desserts down pat (and there may have been a sense of repetition in their overall demeanor), it was still so cool to see their work.  \n\nMy mango sorbet with apple gelee was a pleasant preamble to the main course.  I would have preferred another flavor sorbet but it was the luck of the draw.  As it turns out, this wasn't bad at all.\n\nOur desserts came next...the Mt. Charleston was definitely yummy, through and through.  My Mars was beautiful to look at and the melting of the dome was a nice touch.  However, I could have used less brandy in the dish.  It overpowered much of the dessert though on the bites where I didn't get too much brandy, it was delicious.  I saw a lady sharing the dessert with possibly her 10 yo granddaughter and I thought it was definitely not child-appropriate. The quick toasting of the brandy probably did little to burn off the alcohol. Thankfully, the kid stopped eating it pretty soon. \n\nDuring this time, I did get my cocktail and while it did serve as a break from all the sweetness, it really didn't mesh with my palate at that point in time and I didn't really taste much of the ume.  As a result, I think I ended up only drinking about half of it.\n\nI eventually also ordered what I think was called the Primavera...a coconut panna cotta (I love panna cotta) with a bunch of berries and mousse-like substance on it.  This one also had a flair - they put a disk of what I think was white chocolate over the glass the dessert is served in and melt it with a warm sauce.  My original choice was the Ringo but they'd sold the last one just a few minutes before.  (And the night was still young!) Still, the Primavera was soooo good.  It looked like a general mish mash of things but I couldn't get enough.\n\nService from our lady was very smiley and nice. We enjoyed our visit and definitely look forward to coming back again to try other things (like the Ringo)."

There are only about 13-14 seats at the bar and only 5-6 small tables here. \n\nI had the pleasure of sitting at the bar, so I got front row seats to all the action. It's quite amazing seeing them work their magic in creating these elegant desserts. The amount of attention to detail that is required to make each individual one... No wonder it takes some time to get your dessert. Trust me the wait is worth it. Try to get a seat at the bar if possible.\n\nThis is my first time eating a 2 course dessert: Main dessert + sorbet. \nI ordered the Spring Mountain, which consisted of a pistachio cream cake with strawberry and raspberry mousse on top of chocolate cake with pie crust. Omg it was fantastic! The mousse was very light and not overwhelmingly sweet. The pie crust was crispy and flaky with just the right amount of firmness. The chocolate cake was moist and light as well. Expertly crafted.\nOn this particular day, the sorbet was pineapple and coconut which I was hesitant about because I'm not a coconut fan. However the sorbet was fantastic! If you can get me to like something I normally don't like, then you've done an incredible job."

We were seated a little after an hour wait. It's a nice little setup.. you can sit at the bar & watch the girls make the desserts or you can sit at one of the 2-3 tables of 2-4 seats. Our party of 5 was lucky enough to snag a spot at the bar. We were entertained by the girls plating the desserts.\n\nOnce we were seated, the menu was explained to us. It's a prix fixe menu where you get 3 \"courses\" for $19. You get a starter, an entree (5 options available), & petit fours. OH! The menu (like everyone else has shared) is edible with raspberry dipping sauce. Nothing too exciting, but how many places can you say you've eaten the menu, right?? \n\nThe amuse was a raspberry sorbet with mint jelly. Light, refreshing, can barely taste the mint. For our entrees, since there were 5 of us & 5 different entrees, we all picked one & tried each. \n\n- Marriage: this was my favorite out of the 5.. a spongecake with banana custard inside and strawberry mousse on top with fresh berries. \n- Baton: this looked like a chocolate silo filled a chocolate cake, topped with chocolate & pistachio mousse with a cute candied ribbon on top. \n- Angel cream: fromage pear.. super pretty presentation! Delicious & light. \n- Mt. Fuji: chestnut cream cake.. tasty, but too much cream for my liking. \n- Ringo: another beautiful presentation! My second favorite: it is basically apple pie with with a candied apple filled with cream and a side of honey ice cream. \n\nThe petit four was a chocolate molten lava cake with dried fruit and marshmallows on the sides - would skip the fruit. \n\nOverall, super cute dessert place where you don't have to feel bad about taking pictures of your food because everyone else is. ;)"

Parking is getting harder and harder here with the quality of businesses in the area, so you may have to resort to nearby street parking. If you can, sit at the bar, so you can watch the master dessert makers at work. It's very mesmerizing to see people who are so good at their craft up close, with so much skill and refinement to what they do. You can choose from a la carte desserts or a dessert set, but there is an order minimum per person. Everything is so light and perfectly thought out, but be warned the alcohol-based desserts have a bit of a kick to them, so I would not order for kids (even my 15-year-old brother felt guilty with his moscato-based dessert lol I told him he didn't have to tell my mom he ordered it). \n\nThis place is also immaculately clean at all times. You can see that they've put a lot of care in to the set up of the restaurant and re-used a lot of non-conventional items, e.g. silicone lego mats as coasters, the tiling in the restaurant as utensil holders. They don't do the edible menus anymore, which I really miss, but I think the whole staff does a great job at making your time here special. They also do special order cakes (which I got to see being made), and they come out just as beautiful and delicious as their other items. So get ready to whip out your camera phones, you're going to want to capture all the magic that happens during your visit here!"

The cake part of it was my fav. :-)\n\nThey called it hot cream puff but I guess I like my cream puffs a little softer.  This one was rock hard.

What's the deal?  You can't let your first time patrons know that parking is bloody murder? To add on at least 30 minutes to try and get parking or tell them to park at another plaza and walk over?  Is that so hard to let people know? \n\nI called to ask them where they are located while I was sitting in front of Raku(which had a sign). The girl on the phone laughed and said yes no sign like that was a good thing... and then when I mentioned the parking she just laughed again and said to just drive around and look for parking.

The other half of the group received a fig sorbet which, let's just say, was not to die for.\n     \nFor my main dessert, I had the Mt. Fuji, a chestnut cream cake topped with layers of chestnut cream.  It was unusual to look at, but once I took a bite, I knew this was the stuff dreams are made of.  The light taste of the chestnut was delightful and the sponge cake was soft, airy and perfect.  \n\nHowever, next time and mark my words there will be a next time, I will order Stella, the fairest of all strawberry tiramisu.  With its beautiful presentation, you won't want to cut into it, but once you do, it will be sure to be one of the best desserts you have ever experienced.  \n\nThe final course was a cream puff served with petit fours.  I practically inhaled the cream puff and its delicious light vanilla cream.  The pastry chefs at Sweets Raku are amazing at creating such beautiful and delicious desserts.  This was definitely an extraordinary and unique experience.  Next time in Vegas, make sure to stop here."

The pastry chef makes suuuuch good desserts. She makes a starch paper and puts a note on it for you as a welcome. After you read the note that is on the paper they give you a sauce. After they give you the sauce, you can eat the note! Very very fun place. I recommend something called the Jack in the box which is a souffl\u00e9 cake with powder sugar, hot chocolate, cream that gets squeezed into your souffl\u00e9, and bananas at the bottom. An awesome place I recommend for anyone."

You can choose from a big selection of quality teas and for whichever cake you choose, they will pretty much make it in front of you! The creativity is awesome and it's definitely worth a try."

            "review": "This is very similar to an experience that you would have in Japan.   Even more so than P\u00e2tisserie Chantilly in Southern California (which is my current japanese favorite).    So lets go to the review...\n\nWe had the prix fixe.    Loved the sorbet with muscat grape jelly (very popular in japan), mont blac with chestnuts (tastes home made), and cream puff was fresh with berry sauce.   Very well executed.   It is an experience.   \n\n If you want the best dessert experience in LV, this is it."

            "review": "Five stars, simply because of the quality and creativity for being off the strip. I arrived in a party of 8 on a late Sunday afternoon, and we were lucky that they had enough space as we walked in. They only have about 20 seats, half of which are at the bar. The entrance is a bit confusing; the storefront is literally a display of wine bottles.\n\nThe server was very helpful in describing items off the menu. Each one of us ordered something different from the list of Main Desserts (offerings seem to change from time to time) and we all shared. As expected, they were all yummy. I especially like how interactive the desserts are. In some, they will squeeze fresh cream into, or pour a bourbon flambe, or you can crack something open. You can tell each plate is carefully crafted.\n\nTry anything from the main desserts. The presentation of each one is pretty amazing!"

            "review": "The place is small and seats roughly about 25 people. The service is amazing and very personal. We ordered the caviar and did the dessert deal for $15 per person. The caviar is from Italy and it is a 10g can. If you haven't tried caviar before, I recommend just smearing the caviar on the bread/cracker only. They gave us Mayo, onions etc. to dress the caviar, but I didn't use any of that. Enjoy the taste to the fullest! :)\nNext was the pineapple sorbet, which was really delicious. I can't emphasize how good the sorbet was. Tasted like fresh pineapples! Mmm. Second we got the Carib and Mt. Fuji. Both were different in their own way and it was good. It wasn't overbearinly sweet. All I can say about this place is, if you aren't a huge fan of sweets, at least come here for the experience and the ambience. Each dessert is delicately made in front of you. To watch them swiftly make each one is just amazing to watch. I'll be back to try the others."
