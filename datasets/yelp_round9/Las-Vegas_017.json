            "review": "The first word that comes to mind about Giada is \"sexy\". I'm referring to the restaurant, not the celebrity chef, but I'm sure everyone would agree that both is true haha. Giada is located inside the Cromwell on one of the high floors so that you have a beautiful view of the strip if you're lucky enough to be seated by a window. The seating hostesses wear little tight dresses and the decor can only be described as sexy elegance from the walls to the plating of the dishes. The waitstaff are formal and professional. \n\nStraight away, I was impressed with the bread service. You're served a beautiful plate with crispy breadsticks, bread crisps, and Giada's wonderfully moist and salty olive oil bread. Cocktails are presented on an iPad which is great if you're a visual person. We took advantage of the wine offerings and went with a crisp Chardonnay, chilled to the ideal temperature. Next we moved on to the Prosciutto di Parma, topped with apple slices and a healthy portion size. The perfectly soft Burrata had amazing flavor and was taken to the next level with the caper pesto on the plate. Eating these 2 dishes together made for the perfect start to our meal. \n\nI knew that I couldn't pass on the Porcini Mushroom Soup. I expected a cream soup but was pleased to be served a light soup with chunks of hearty mushrooms, cannellini beans and saut\u00e9ed escarole. If you're a fan of mushrooms as I am, this is a solid choice. As it was my first time dining at Giada, I had to try the simply titled Spaghetti. The thick noodles are lightly sauced with a thick lemon basil sauce and accompanied by 2 of the largest shrimp I have ever seen. I highly suggest this dish as I felt that each ingredient perfectly complimented the next and none overpowered the other. While the portion size wasn't out of control, I was still too full for dessert and nothing on that menu really called out to me. Overall, high marks for both the food and ambiance. I was here on a business dinner so the tasting menu was out of their budget, but I would love to return to try it out."

            "review": "had a very nice lunch today with my 3 girlfriends~\n    Lets start with the host stand~ like most restaurants in LV, the hostess's are all young girls and wore adorable white eyelet type dresses. We were there upon opening so there where people apparently w/o reservations, however we were seated after them.....It all worked out just thought that was a little off~ The girl who seated us was polite, conversational and pulled all 4 chairs out for us~ slightly awkward however still a nice touch!\n   Our server Sean/Shawn was very attentive, conversational, polite, well groomed and definitely knew the menu ~ everything we ordered was quite good, can't say delicious.\n    The starters we ordered the roasted mushrooms, served cold (expected it to be hot, but I could have overlooked this on the menu) they were a very nice assortment of different types of mushrooms. Also ordered the Pasta Fagio soup, good but more like a chicken noodle soup plus goat cheese stuffed peppers, pretty presentation and good, not great.\n    Main courses also great presentations  on each, 2 Kale ~ Faro salads with goat cheese, the special pasta of the day eggplant lasagna & grilled cheese with prosciutto & pesto served with these interesting zucchini potato shreddings, which were quite different, interesting and a VERY nice change from fries, chips or salad~\n   Our issues came with desserts ~ we were celebrating a B Day ordered the cookie sampler, gelato selections, zeppoles, 2 regular coffees along with an espresso.\nThe cookie plate had Happy B Day written in chocolate, very artistically done and the cookies were good......and of course they were on the bill~.we just questioned couldn't this been a complimentary B Day dessert? the price was $8.00 so not expensive, and yes they were ordered but REALLY GIADA???? it would have been a very nice way to complete the meal. I suspect that our server could have requested this as an option to be deleted from the bill, but for whatever reason he chose not to quite disappointing.Our bill was over $200 for lunch so again the money wasn't an issue, just seem like very poor customer service, and were LOCALS!!\n   You have a chance to rate your experience before you leave the restaurant, and we did and all the marks were excellent with A ratings, except the host stand which we gave a B. All in all it was a very nice afternoon, the restaurant is very nicely appointed and pretty with her name or initial everywhere, Hey it's her restaurant so why not? Will we be back? probably, however with sooo many options on the strip it could be awhile."

            "review": "OMG, if there was ever a reason to give a restaurant a perfect 10, then Giada gets it!\n\nTHIS IS MY VEGETARIAN DREAM!  Through all of my travels around the world and back, Giada of the most fantastic restaurants I've ever experienced, hands down.  From ambiance to food to service, no detail has gone unnoticed. \n\nI'll start by saying that this restaurant is a ray of light in the dark underground-esque-walk-through-a-casino restaurant scenes in Vegas.  As soon as you enter the space, you're greeted by the aroma of delicious food, an antipasti bar, a wood burning oven, cooks in the kitchen and food & friendliness all the way round.  It's like walking into Giada's personal kitchen!\n\nThen, after checking in with the host, you'll walk into the dining room to find a GORGEOUS, sexy, ambient-lit space with a killer view of the Bellagio and that part of the strip (mind you, you're several floors up and the restaurant faces the Strip).\n\nYou'll get an interactive cocktail and drink menu, from which I would HIGHLY recommend starting with one of Giada's signature cocktails.  I already forgot what I had, but it's a refreshing summery whisky something.  \n\nOK, now I'm getting onto the food, which is still calling my name days later!  The first and foremost delicious thing:  they start with a freshly baked crucible (?) of focaccia bread, fully loaded on the side with any topping you would need.  For your courses, You gotta go for a little of everything.  It's all meant to be shared.  So I'll ramble off some of what I had...the compilation vegetable plate, flatbreads, a side of potatoes, two types of vegetarian pastas and DESSERTS.  Cookies are a must, especially the lemon Ricotta, one of my fondest memories.  Then try the polenta cake.  It has a delectable strawberry topping with a dollop of cream.  MMMM HMMM.\n\n****FINALLY:  Can I just give a shout-out to my server Nathan and our Sommellier (I forgot her name).  They were just so stellar and they're the kind of people you'd want to invite to your house to have dinner, chat, and treat really well b/c of how nice they treated you.  REALLY FIRST CLASS!!! *******\n\nI gotta go back to Vegas in a month for round 2 so more to come then..."

            "review": "I'm generously giving Giada 3 stars, but only because of the service. My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday, and the waiter was very courteous and exactly the kind of waiter I want to always have in all my dining experiences. He appeared to be legitimately Italian based on his accent, which definitely added to the experience. \n\nI'll admit that I was the one who wanted to come here on our brief weekend trip to Vegas, and my boyfriend was a good sport about it. I love Giada's show, and I thought to myself, what's better than actually getting to sample the food she cooks on TV? Obviously, Giada herself does not prepare the food, but it's still her restaurant, so I assume the chefs use her recipes. Unfortunately, Giada was not at the restaurant, as some other diners have posted. Granted, I wasn't really expecting her to be there either. \n\nI had a reservation, but my boyfriend wanted a window table, so we requested it. We ended up waiting an additional 25 minutes for a booth that faced the window, but not what we had expected for such a long additional wait. Had I known, I would have just told them to forget it.\n\nOnto the food...\n\nThey give you a variety of complimentary bread with several accompaniments, which I really enjoyed. But you don't need to give me an excuse to enjoy some free bread. I love my carbs. We had the Crab Salad Crostini to start with, and it was good for what it was. For my entree, I ordered the Pappardelle, which I had high hopes for - maybe too high. The pasta itself was good. It was the pork ragout that sits atop it that disappointed. It was WAYYYYY too salty. I was downing water after every bite. I ate all the pasta, but left the ragout for my boyfriend, since his meal was a bit paltry in terms of portion size. He ordered the Three Cheese Tortellini and really liked it - except for the fact that it probably had less than 10 dime-sized pieces of actual tortellini in there.\n\nWe opted to skip dessert, since we had plans elsewhere for that. However, our waiter brought my boyfriend two small cookies for his birthday dessert, which was really nice of him to do. They were average, taste-wise. I make better cookies that that, and they're my least favorite thing to bake. I guess, you could say the food was average or below. It's unlikely I'll return on any future visits to Vegas.\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\nFood: 1.5/5\nService: 5/5\nAtmosphere: 4/5"

Amazing. \n\nThe Orzco Meatballs... Soft meat and the sauce was super good. Great flavors. \n\nBaked Pasta of the Day: Lasagna- this little portion of lasagna was good! It had mushrooms in it and the noodles tasted adente. Definitely worth the $24 \n\nPasta Carbonara- very standard carbonara. \n\nPizza- the dough was so light and the cheese was so stringy. UGHHH I wanted to eat all of it. Soooooo good. Get the pizza. \n\nSliders- these were the highlight for me. The meat was tender. The red pepper jam was amazing. These fried zucchini fries were soooooo good!!! Ahhhhh I wanted to eat all the sliders! \n\nDessert- the lemon cookies and the peanut butter chocolate cookies. Ok. Seriously.... These stupid cookies are SOOOOOO GOOD!!!! Different than all the other cookies I've had. It's so good. \n\nGreat place to eat! Must eat."

            "review": "I have always loved Giada as a chef, so when I found out she was opening up her first restaurant here in Vegas I knew exactly where I would be spending my money!! I was a little disappointed with how long my Friend and I had to wait to be seated even after they had told us how long it would be ( We waited an extra 25mins after the fact ) which for a more upscale restaurant I would expect better. Other then that we ordered a few appetizers that were good, I liked that she had her own twist on certain classics like the \"Rosted eggplant parmigiana\". Then we ordered a few main courses; Barolo braised Australian Wagyu beef short ribs, and Rigatoni. The short ribs where phenomenal! Probably my favorite dish, the meat melts in your mouth, it's amazing! The Rigatoni was great too, the pasta was a little too al dente but the Bolognese was full of so much flavor, you would never know there wasn't meat in it. We finished off the night with a chocolate cake ( I forgot the name lol ) and cappuccinos! I'm not going to lie the cake was a little dry I didn't even finish it...  \n\nI will say the decor is absolutely breath taking and very grand, she hit the nail on the head with really portraying her style. I love the location on the strip it's perfect. Everything had Giada's name on it which is cute and I loved it! Our waitress was awesome she new everything on the menu and took the time to answer any questions we had, giving us great recommendations on menu items like the short ribs. Since it is a upscale restaurant the proportions are small and the prices not so much. Over all I will still return to Giada's again, there where a lot of other things we tried that I did love! The food for the most part was perfect, and very creative with fresh twist to classic Italian dishes."

            "review": "Giada is my absolute favorite Food Network chef. She inspired me in so many ways to cook, eat healthier, etc. I have met her several times and she's been a pleasure to be with.\n\nSo when I heard that she was opening a restaurant, I couldn't pass it up. Let's fast forward to a year of wishing: I finally was able to pay a visit! And let me tell you...it was everything I imagined her restaurant to be.\n\nAmbience: Very modern, elegant, yet welcoming. It feels as if you're walking into Giada's home. It's surrounded with pics of her family, furniture that she has at home, etc.\nI love how it has a woman's touch to the decor...\n\nFood: Delicious! Exactly what I would expect from Giada. Portions are smaller but good enough to have a bite from lots of things from the menu. I encourage sharing as this will allow you to try all the items you want to order (it's difficult to choose just one! lol. My first experience at dinner was so good that I had to come back for lunch the next day...\n\nWhat I Ordered (Dinner):\n\n* Complimentary Bread Plate: I enjoyed the homemade rosemary focaccia! So flavorful dipped in the pesto sauce it comes with!\n\n* Orzo Meatballs: The best meatballs I've ever had. Not exaggerating. Very tender and flavorful. My mom who is not a meatball person enjoyed it and stole my portion! I was so mad haha. Please get this...it's Jade's favorite (Giada's daughter). This was so good I ordered it again on my second visit!\n\n* Grilled Octopus: Not chewy at all. Super tender. It had a nice char on the outside and paired well with the potato caper salsa it was served with. It's a favorite of Giada's.\n\n* Fritto Misto: I've had better. The batter wasn't too crispy but loved the lemon aioli and fennel salad it came with.\n\n* Oysters with Prosecco Mignonette: Sweet, fresh, & clean tasting from the mignonette sauce. Wish we had more!\n\n* Sopressata: How could you go wrong with spicy salami?!\n\n* Caprese Salad: The mini heirloom tomatoes were super sweet and the mozzarella was oozing with creaminess. Such a guilty pleasure.\n\n* Romaine Salad (Giada's version of a Caesar Salad): I loved how Giada added crispy capers and bits of anchovies. Worked well with the grated parmesan and crispy romaine.\n\n* Lobster Ravioli: I wasn't a fan. The tarragon butter sauce had a unique flavor I wasn't too fond of. The ravioli was al dente though which I was happy about. \n\n* Crispy Branzino with Orange Vinaigrette: I was really surprised with this dish. Absolutely delicious! The fish was very crispy and the meat was moist. I wouldn't have expected it to work well with the arugula salad with orange vinaigrette but it was a match made in heaven! Bitter from the arugula and nice citrus pop from the vinaigrette. Highly recommended if you like fish!\n\n* Lemon Spaghetti with Jumbo Shrimp: I fell in love with this dish. It's deceiving at first that it's on the smaller side bit it's very filling!!!! You get two jumbo prawns and they are huge! The sauce is very light and refreshing even if it is a creamy sauce. I love the clean flavor the lemon gives and the nice pop the fried capers provided. I can see why this is one of her signature dishes.\n\n* Tuscan Ribeye with A Fried Egg: A meat lover's dream come true. 28 oz ribeye cooked to your liking with a fried egg on top...who wouldn't love that?! I love the oozing yoke paired with the juicy ribeye. The other table beside us couldn't take their eyes off this thing...it's definitely a sight to see.\n\n* Giada's Signature Cookies: My favorite was the chocolate chip. Warm and chocolatey! \n\nWhat I Ordered (Brunch):\n\n* Carbonara Pizza w/ Fried Egg: Pancetta and an egg on a pizza? I'm sold. So good! Everything you'd ever want in a pizza...\n\n* Margherita Pizza: Simplicity at it's best. The tomato sauce was very sweet and the traditional combo of basil, tomato, & mozzarella never fails. And on a side note...Giada's pizza dough is very good. Has a nice honey note to it and it's charred to perfection in her brick oven.\n\n* Orzo Meatballs: It's that good that I had to order it again!\n\n* Zucchini Scapece: I'm so glad I was able to get this as a side order. Strands of potato, zucchini, and onion are lightly fried and served piled high to your table. I couldn't stop snacking on this in between bites from my pizza!\n\n* Arugula Salad with Candied Lemon Vinaigrette: As simple as the salad was....I really enjoyed the vinaigrette. Little bits of candied lemon bits floated around and provided a nice burst of citrus that contrasted with the peppery arugula and crispy pancetta. \n\n* White Sangria: Bubbly, fruity, and crisp. Perfect for the hot weather!\n\nOverall I had a great time at Giada's. Service was superb and the food was amazing. I'll admit it's very expensive but worth every penny. You absolutely get what you pay for. It definitely was the highlight of my trip to Vegas. I can't wait to go back. \n\nPS: Make sure you stop by the photo booth for an opportunity to capture your visit!!!!"

            "review": "Was here the 1st weekend in May with my husband and another couple. I was so disappointed by the service from the wait staff (2 stars). Maybe they were understaffed. The d\u00e9cor was very nice and created a very high expectation for a great experience. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and then while waiting for our table we ordered drinks at the bar. We were seated in a nice booth and then we waited and waited some more (we contemplated getting up and leaving, but I really wanted to try the food here). Once we were attended to and given menus, we started with some pizzas (Carbonara & Salumi Piccante), which were SO good (4 star). Then we waited and waited and waited and waited....at this point we REALLY contemplated heading out. But we stuck it out because we were entertained by Giada walking around the restaurant. She didn't make it to our table though. So three of us ordered off the brunch sampler menu which included three items, a starter (pastry assortment or devilled eggs or Brussel sprouts crostini), a main course (salmon cakes benedict, lasagna or chicken and waffle), and then a dessert (souffl\u00e9 or chocolate espresso tower or cookie ice cream sandwich). I tried the gnocchi. Tasty and delicious but this meal lasted a loooooooong 3 hours, which was a turn off. Next time, we plan to hit up the bar for prompt service."

The decor was trendy and gorgeous, the chairs comfortable and the food was delicious.\n\nI had the arugula salad with chicken milanese while my husband had the turkey panini with fried zucchini strings.  I had the peach bellini and he had a beer as well.  While the booze was tasty, it was more expensive than the food.  The arugula salad was perfectly dressed and the chicken was nice and crispy, though slightly under seasoned.  The panini was warm, gooey, cheesy and had a buttery crust.  Unfortunately, the pizza oven wasn't working that day.  Boo!\n\nWe ended lunch with a plate of mini fried donuts that were served with a bit of nutella.  My husband ordered an iced vanilla latte which was THE BEST and worth the $7.  \n\nThe only downside of our meal was our exit.  We were looking for an exit to the pedestrian bridge and accidentally walked into a meeting.  The male manager or whoever he was stormed through the doors and followed us to make sure we took the proper exit.  Nothing like a bully escorting us out of the restaurant."

            "review": "I'm pretty shocked to see so many good reviews on this place. The 3 best things are 1, location 2, the wine, cheese, meat boards and 3, the free bread. It was the best thing we ate all night. If you want a casual, and I say this because they do not enforce the dress code at all, place to have some good wine, in a beautiful location, with a light bite, this is your place. \nIf your looking for a good dinner, go elsewhere. It is very over priced for what you get, and to be honest, pretty bland and underwhelming. I have ate at very nice restaurants all over the world, price isn't an issue, good food is.\nWith all that being said, the concept, start with some meats, cheeses, nuts....move onto a soup/salad....move onto a small plate of pasta...move on to the main course.....finish it with desert..\nWe chose to skip the meat and cheese board and went straight to the pasta course and a bottle of wine and lobster ravioli. It was 4 bites of tough cheese and pasta, rubbery bites of prawn, and a red sauce that tasted like spaghetti ohs, cost $35. Main course, I ordered the 7oz filet with basil infused mashed potatoes, cost $58 My boyfriend ordered the beef spare ribs over polenta, cost $52. My filet was grey in color, but was cooked to temp...the potatoes were very unappealing, as they were a thick pile of green, apparently from the basil? No sauce at all, so overall, pretty bland. His spareribs were tasty, but honestly, it tasted just like the pot roast I make at home for $15. \nAfter talking with several people who had ate there before us, they all had very negative comments. One couple said the bad staff and aweful food ruined their 13 anniversary!\nPS, hostesses were very silly, laughing, giggling, acting like school girls, all in front of about 5 couples waiting to be seated, who all had reservations. I love Giada, but if any of these other great chefs (Ramsey, Fley, morimota, Wolfgang) ate at her restaurant, she wouldn't like the reviews..."

Guy Fieri, Gordon Ramsay etc...are douches. Michael Mina (see me review of his namesake restaurant at the Bellagio) was a total waste of time. The track records of celebrity chefs are not exactly stellar. \n\nFinally, after months of not looking at Giada's, I decide to go for a date night with the hubs largely because I absolutely love how the place looks when you drive towards the Cromwell with the green vegetation. Since then, I requested to come back with friends for my birthday dinner here as I loved it so much. Giada has proven the TV cook curse can be broken. \n\nFirstly, the place was outstanding due to a wonderful waiter (that we got both times we were there)! Diego...a wonderful man from Italy who was attentive, polite, hilarious and just literally the best waiter I have ever ever had in my entire life. \n\nThen, the food...Giada likes to squeeze citrus on her dishes. Normally, that would have generated a barf response from me. But you know what..it was done right. Just a smidgen of citrus was beautiful. I never thought I would say that. \n\nI've ordered the following:\n\n1) Artichoke Arancini - I could eat like 18 of these. So freaking good. Fried rice, artichoke balls. Oh loveliness\n2) Bucatini with a tomato - citrus sauce - so simple and delicious. You just don't feel like you ate a bowl of spaghetti...feels so much more sophisticated and just...different. I thought that the noodles here was even better than the famous Scarpetta spaghetti\n3) The vegan main was chard wrapped brown rice and tofu with a curry seasoning (?). Made no sense and sounded so awful on the menu especially at an Italian place. My husband made the order and I was seething with anger at having to pay good money to eat something that sounded awful. Why they would describe the dish that way on the menu is beyond me? Because it is one of the MOST DELICIOUS things I've ever eaten! So savory, so smooth and just wonderful. \n\nI never did try the desserts but the dessert cart was pretty impressive. When we had our friends with us the second time, our friends ordered the lamb, octopus and a bunch of other carnivorous fare and enjoyed it with glee. So I'd say the full menu is pretty darn good. \n\nBut the special icing of Giada - our wonderful Diego. \n\nThis is one of the places I think it's worth spending money on a meal for. Giada, you have me as a fan."

            "review": "Wow, impressed and doubly impressed that it is by a celebrity chef.  All reviews from celeb places are \"ugh, really overrated\".  Well done...service, food, atmosphere, view, price point.  Kudos and I am sometimes hard to impress.\n\nWe were under $200 for a party of four.  We ordered the Chicken Meatballs, which were good, but I wouldn't order again, just because nothing special...everything else was special.  Really everyone couldn't agree on a better app.\n\nEntrees...filet and lamb chops....the temperature and flavor on both of these were beyond excellent.  The lemon shrimp pasta...excellent.  The barley entree was good, but I am just not a huge barley fan.  \n\nThe bread basket was served with this piping hot rosemary buttery bread in an oven hot baking dish.  Butter had lemon zest and dipping oil was flavored as well.  \n\nDesserts deserve big kudos.  The strawberry polenta cake was a take on strawberry shortcake, but it held the integrity of the original, but was set apart and creative and fresh.  Very hard thing to do with a traditional recipe.  The jam, the cake....delish.  The tiramisu trio were excellent as well.  \n\nSides....the corn/sausage was very unique and I enjoyed thoroughly.  Others thought too spicy, but never for me....could have used less sausage, only because I am not huge on sausage and would rather have more corn.  Thought the combo was unique and the sauce was excellent.  The polenta cakes were excellent as well.  Crispy on outside, creamy on inside.  \n\nService was beyond excellent.  Waiter was spot on, funny, attentive, informative.  View of strip and bellagio fountains.  Four stars.  Attention to detail in design and layout, four stars.  Beautiful glassware, awesome silver ware.  Presentation...delivered....food quality....delivered.....price point....good for upscale dining.  \n\nI only somewhat knew Giada as a celeb chef with some food network shows.  Definitely a fan now.\n\nOh, and I had read in the review that her grandfather was a movie director and that her family also owned a pasta factory before WWII.  Her grandfather's movie posters were presented as art in the entrance.  Classy and true to a good heart....family first always.  \n\nThe walk through of the kitchen and antipasti bar was also a nice touch."

OH Boy! was I wrong it was the worst dinner experience I've ever had. First when we arrived we were waiting on our other friends so we went to the bar for a drink I ordered a drink and waited 10min till I asked where my drink was they said they weren't sure they would find the waitress. I told them to cancel my drink and just to seat us. When we were seated we waited another 10 minutes before anyone even approached us. At that time they told us that they were going to have three people helping on our table, the captain and two others. We ordered a bottle of wine which had taken 20 minutes to receive. We then ordered our salads, appetizers and dinner entr\u00e9es. The appetizer was just average very very small portions for very high prices.  My salad was the signature salad  which turned out to be very bland and the dinner was just less than average. We all ordered pasta. Two out of the four were very nice but super salty and I'm not against salt. One of the other pasta dishes was just average. And the fourth pasta dish which was  Giada's signature pasta was just awful. I was so surprised on how terrible the food was since I own her cookbooks and make many recipes that I enjoy. The service is Horrendous! We were left with dirty dishes on the table empty water glasses and they never came and checked if we would like to order another bottle of wine. All four of us will never go back. There are too many wonderful restaurants in this town. Just because she's on the food network channel doesn't mean her restaurants good."

The server was good, but not awesome. \n\nWe started out with the Bacon-wrapped dates and Marsala meatballs....dates were delish, meatballs had a great flavor but we're very dry. \n\nMoved onto pappardelle with pork ragout which was amazing, rigatoni with vegee bolognese so delish and the Crab risotto, which was wonderful. We also got the lemon smashed potatoes, which were really dry and disappointing. \n\nIn the end, I expected a bit more from this experience. When paying this much for food, everything needs to be spot on. I would go back again, however."

The restaurant as a whole was very high end. Everything from the placemats to the mugs was personalized with the logo. A lot of thought was put into it and it was successful I thought.\n\nNow I will go onto the food. It was very good. Nothing to jump around and dance about, but it was solid Giada food. Just what you would expect from the famous food network star. I got the Margherita pizza and I loved it. I also got a cappuccino which was very good, but, let's be real, how can one go wrong with a cappuccino? For desert we got these yummy fruit infused donuts with a chocolate dipping sauce and they were to die for. \n\nThe only complaint I have about the place was that they had this big beautiful windows open which would be lovely anywhere else except the smoky, busy streets of the Vegas strip. You would get random whiffs of cigarette smoke which really ruins your palette while trying to eat and enjoy food with new and exciting flavors. Also a really loud motor cycle or type of car would speed by and It was very startling. I dropped my fork at one point because of how creeped out I was. \n\nEveryone at the table was content with our meal at Giada :)"

I saw that but did not wish to fight with others to view the tiny menu.  \n\n2) The waiter (sorry don't remember the name) never came back to check our water, never refilled my iced tea, and took about one hour to even come back to our table after the desert.  We arrived at 12:30 p.m. for lunch date and left 3:30 p.m.  Ridiculous.\n\n3) The food.  What can I say?  Maybe lunch isn't their strong suit.  Margherita pizza was so mediocre.  I ordered this for my child.  For the price (I believe $15), it was small, too thick, and not enough tomatoes and basil.  The sauce was also not impressive.  Even Nove had a better pizza.  \n\nSandwich with zucchini string: again nothing special.  Zucchini string was soggy and salty.  \n\n4) Coffee (Americano) and cookie platter were the most pleasurable of all.  I did not fancy the peanut butter cookie but the ricotta cookie was fabulous.  I had made them from her recipe several months ago and was happy to see them included in the platter.  My friends loved the chocolate chip cookies.\n\nOf note, my child (2-year-old girl) said \"too loud\" when we sat at our table.  It was crowded and was pretty loud during the lunch.\n\nUnless they improve staff training, I would not even consider coming for dinner."

Probably if there was event there but I doubt we would make a special trip as we would not want to wait 30-45 minutes after reservation scheduled to eat.   I mean if the food was a 10 maybe.

There was literally no room our chairs were either back to wall or my bf chair to chair very unpleasant. Why we were not moved is beyond my comprehension? It's not the food or waiter that sucked for me it was the table and the fact that we obviously didn't fit in the space when we sat down. We should of never been sat there in the first place. We should of complained but we just tried to make the best of it. I'm a huge fan of Giada and I'm glad I got to go to this place but it's not like we can dine out often. So please staff can you notice the people that you over look and try some common sense. It's team work not Tetris."

            "review": "This Saturday evening my amazing and fabulous 91 year old (a local and Cromwell regular) and I decided to dine at one of our favorite spots. We are SO disappointed to report that we will NEVER be returning. After many memories of family events when the restaurant first opened to when my girlfriends and I come to town- this place will only be a memory. The service was HORRENDOUS! Where to start..hmmmm. Although the pit boss called ahead for us and we were told we could go upstairs to dine they tried to put us in the bar area. Not really a place to enjoy a relaxing meal with my grandma. We moved and were treated by a lovely waiter, Amber. Unfortunately nobody was helping this poor busy girl! The bussers, runners, kitchen, and management must really not enjoy their jobs. We had Amber beg the kitchen about ordering our Burrata while we decide on some food (she's a diabetic and was starving). Lucky us because we were \"allowed\" to order one dish ahead of the rest. Then we asked for regular butter and it took about 5 minutes to get it. We ordered a couple appetizers and one entree to share. To our surprise we received ALL of the items at once! I have never seen such a bizarre set of events. We asked for another roll of bread right when we got the first round and that came at the same time as the food as well! I asked Amber if we could please take a couple items away so we could enjoy our meal and take our time. Of course she accommodated us. My grandmother asked for a plate from a busser because we were sharing. The Burrata was so cold it could make your teeth hurt! Interesting stuff. I was so upset because we had to ask multiple bussers and runners to get us the extra plate. By the time we each had a plate we noticed the octopus was room temperature and unimpressive. I asked the one guy for the manager. He never came. I asked another guy for the manager - who told me he's very busy and can't help. I got of my chair (for the second time to \"help\" the staff get things moving- but this time I was determined to find this manager. I walked up to a man in a suit and asked him if I could borrow him for a moment because I had been asking for him for a while. He came with me back to the table where my Grandma was and I told him how crazy our experience has been and that we are huge fans of this restaurant. George was rude and unfriendly. George, the manager, hardly listened to anything I was saying and made my Grandmother feel awkward. He never said I'm sorry this experience has been different than Jose in the past. She said she's been there at least 7 times without anything like this. I told him that I have worked at many different restaurants and in different positions in them. He literally said \"congratulations\" and after I looked at him funny he fumbled his words and it was even more weird and uncomfortable. I found it rude and offensive and I didn't was just tying to explain to him that I understand that there must be cohesiveness and people working together and that I've literally seen only Amber working and the other people are standing around. he said well what do you want me to do? I was like hmmm weird question. I said well I'm not happy and neither is she and I'm so sad because we love this place. He was silent and I said well maybe you could have them remake the octopus because she's 91 and never had it before! He literally took the octopus off the table and said ok. We never saw George again. He never checked on us and NEVER apologized or made us feel comfortable. We probably should have left at that point, and if I was with my friends we would have (but 91 year old). The rest of the food came and it was pretty good. We had the same plate problem because we were sharing. Asked a couple times and finally came. We also asked a couple times for more marscarpone butter and pesto olive oil and it took a reallylong time to get it. We decided we needed some dessert to spruce things up. The chocolate peanut butter cake was pretty mediocre. Not worth ordering. Anyways my grandma was getting tired so we quickly got the check and to our surprise not one thing was comped or taken off the bill by George. I asked Amber jokingly about him not taking the octopus off or the dessert. I gave her the visa and she was so cute she actually asked him if he could do anything to help our experience and got a big fat No.grandma told her that she's sweet to even do that for us! I told her that I think he was probably the most unaccommodating restaurant manager ever and borderline rude. I said I hope he is nice to the employees unlike the way he treats the guests. Let's just say I can't repeat what she said but I feel awful for the people who have to work with him! On the way out the door I saw many employees just standing around at stations and a couple big tables that were full of dirty plates and glasses. I watched as they were unattended to. Giada - your food is great but your employees seem lazy and unhappy, and George is awful."

Besides that it was a miserable experience I would never want to encounter again.\n\nBefore our appetizers even came out, our waiter knocked my drink off the table. The glass shattered all under our table and into my sandals. The drink had spilled all over my sweater and hair and got in my eyes so I couldn't open them until I got a clean napkin free if glass shards. He apologized once, offered to get me a new drink, and was never seen again. The bus boy was left to clean (barely) up while neither a manager or the waiter apologized or offered me and my family anything in return for this mistake.\n\nThe menu is arranged easily for family type sharing, however two of the three pasta dishes came out cold. \n\nThe dress that all female workers were wearing says a lot about Gilda's personality.

I will not comment more on the decor or the staff as this is obvious, rather more on culinary side.\n   My wife wanted to treat me to something special and we went to Giada's. We looked over the menu and ordered something simple, the Calamari Salad, Tricolour Salad, and Margarite Pizzaette, which she and I wanted at the same time to share..\n   The Calamari Salad came 15 minutes later, in a little cup (did they use an ice cream scoop?). No thought on presentation. The taste was fishy and overcooked rubber bands. 20 minutes, the Tricolour arrived, average looking pile (did they use a funnel to shape it?) The procuitto was buried on the bottom and difficult to eat as they only gave us a fork. Took another 10 minutes to get a knife. The salad was bitter, too bitter, especially since the dates to cut the bitter were missing. Using walnuts sounds good, unless you remember that the skin of walnuts are bitter too. 15 minutes later, we recieved the Pizza, a $11.00- 4 1/2 inch dough ball, that reminded me of my easy bake oven days. Blond and thick, devoid of any pizza I've tried throughout Italy. More like a focaccia with only the center of Cheese and scant Tomato.15 minutes later, the bread display arrives, which much fanfare. The flatbread was too thick and under baked, giving one the impression that it was stale. The baked bread ball with rosemay was decent until you touched the bottom part, which someone salted salted the bottom. Did someone forget that certain fresh herbs amplify salt? What a mouth of sea salt we got as if I dove in the ocean.\nLuckily, I saved the last swallow of my beer to wash that down.\n  Culinary training and oversight by the Sous Chefs are VERY needed . Alot of what I had go wrong could have been avoided with by one who is passionate about our craft. No Manager was even seen around, let alone stop by.\n  AS I said earlier, it was my wife treating me, so her paying for this was hard as she had to work a whole day for our specail date."

            "review": "We checked this place out on our first stay at The Cromwell. Yelp reviews looked good....I say \"meh\". The antipasto dishes were the highlight but that was the only thing that was great. For antipasto we had the wood fired mushrooms which were excellent and the bacon wrapped dates which were also great. Next we tried a couple of their pizzettes - the Margherita & the Mortadella. These were both solid. Then we got to the pasta....Bucatini (my favorite kind of pasta), Ravioli & Tortellini. The Bucatini was not Al dente at all and was a pretty soft texture. Also the pomodoro sauce they used was just too saucey/thick and didn't have great flavor. The Ravioli had a flavor that made me think of Thai food and the only one I cared for was the Tortellini which was a pea/pesto sauce with pancetta. Dessert came around on a cart that we waited about 10 minutes for after our meal while tables in front of us had their look at it. We had one of the tiramisus and another chocolate dessert. These were pretty good and we didn't get charged for them so I'm not sure if dessert is free at this restaurant or if this was just an error. Now for the service. What really annoyed me was our waiter immediately turned into a less than mediocre waiter / snob after we didn't order wine and decided not to order a lot of entrees. All said and done, the bill was $153 pretip / $183 after tip which is pretty high considering these are all extremely small portions and we ordered no drinks at all & no entrees. Not sure why I gave this guy a full 20% tip. I doubt I would come back for a complete meal but would consider stopping in for a quick bite of their antipasto dishes if in this area of the strip."

We parked at Caesar's since the Cromwell doesn't offer free parking and still  arrived early. \n\nWhile we were waiting, we noticed a complimentary photo booth, so we took some cutesy couple pictures and were able to upload them to our email.\n\nWhen we got seated, we were served with three different types of bread. My favorite was the rosemary focaccia bread dipped in olive oil and sprinkled with capers, sea salt, and chili peppers. We were also given complimentary elderflower honey lemon spritz. This tasted so light and paired perfectly with the bread!\n\nWe decided to get the tasting menu and added the orzo meatballs everyone since was raving about them.   The meatballs were tasty and so tender! They came sprinkled with plenty of fresh parmesan cheese and just melted in my mouth.\n\nThe first course was the antipasti, with bell peppers stuffed with gooey cheese, bacon wrapped dates, and crostini carpaccio. \n\nWe both ordered the lemon spaghetti with jumbo shrimp since this was another of Giada's specialty. The portions were huge but delicious. Sadly, I had to leave some on my plate as I wanted to make room for the following courses.\n\nThe third course was the Sicilian roasted lamb, medium. It came with a side of smashed potatoes and sweet corn with spicy Italian sausage. We were able to eat everything!!!\n\nWe were able to choose three desserts each from the dessert cart and we ordered lemon ricotta cookie, chocolate truffle, strawberry sherbet, petit four, and cheesecake with strawberry topping. Everything was topped off with two glasses of sangria each.\n\nThe service was fantastic! Our waiter, Frederick, constantly checked in on us and was attentive and friendly. \n\nAt the end of the meal, you receive Giada's autographed picture with the breakdown of the tasting menu and a couple of her recipes! :-)"

They separated light and dark meat turkey into two preparations - my favorite turkey is dark meat but I did not like it pulled, pressed and deep fried.  Loved the antipasto, arancini (italian rice dish) and everything else.  The restaurant worked with us for a food allergy.  Was a great experience."

No explanations and never saw the waitress Stephanie for over 30 minutes.  Finally, received an insincere apology from the waitress after asking for the assistant manager, Greisy, who also did not show any genuine concern that they set us back 2 hours waiting for some scrambled eggs and a waffle.  The treatment from the staff was simply rude and dismissive.  When the food finally arrived, it appeared thrown together, there was another delay in getting salt and pepper (?), and the meal was mediocre at best.  Dined at numerous high end restaurants on the Strip and this is hands down the most unprofessional and unpleasant dining experience of the bunch.  Skip this place, plenty of other great options to enjoy weekend brunch.  Zero stars."

Maybe your a figure on tv but your restaurant has a completely different interpretation and representation of what we were hoping to experience. When we arrived we sat in the bar for cocktails Caitlin was our server I will say she was great! However that was the only part of this experience that was worth going for. The drinks were nice. They seated us for dinner and unfortunately we were in for a complete disappointment. I understand aldente cooked pasta right however a little to undercooked in my opinion. We chose the tasting menu. The pasta that was recommended to me tasted like \"Chef boy \"r\" dee\" and I am embarrassed to say yes I have tasted spaghetti \"o's!\" After that course was trying to get rid of I noticed our main course being delivered but halted by our waitress and sent back to the kitchen because that last course wasn't cleared yet. After the spaghetti \"O's\" were cleared the main course came. I ordered rack of lamb rare to medium rare it had sat under a salamander oven along with my wife's salmon both were way over cooked and bland! I want to warn others who are blinded by the beauty of what good network has done to glorify this celebrity chef. Her food looks greater on tv but you might be in for a surprise as we were that our Four hundred dollar bill could have been save by staying at home and eating spaghetti for a can. This is sad to me however I will let others know go somewhere else like Michael Mina, Daniel Bould, Thomas Keller if you want a real dinning experience with a celebrity chef! Sorry Giada but you need to get back in the kitchen and see for yourself! Diners beware and good luck in Vegas this is a losing bet!"

The breads and antipasti were very good. I really enjoyed the bacon wrapped dates. The lemon spaghetti and shrimp were out of this world ( remember this is not ronzoni pasta folks, it's fresh made and served al dente). For our proteins we had the rack of lamb ( 4 pieces and you could cut it with your fork) and the tenderloin. Both had a perfect medium rare cook. The garnishes were all tasty as well, but honestly we just tried them as we were getting full ( I may or may not have polished off the basil mashed potatoes). Then the desert cart comes out. Again, we were getting full, but we tried the 8 layer chocolate cake and one other. Awesome!\n\nOur servers, Andrew and Michael were on point all night. Anticipated our needs, made suggestions and delivered the goods! True professionals!\n\nI laugh when I read some of the reviews as they complain about the portion sizes. I'm 6'1\", 230 lbs and I was full. I wasn't stuffed to the point where I had to undo my belt like on thanksgiving, but I was full.\n\nVegas has plenty of all you can eat buffets. This is not one of them. If you want quality and a unique dining experience I suggest you give this place a try!!\n\nThank you Giada!"

The spinach and polenta cakes both are somewhat bland with the exception of the tomato in the spinach. They were both in need of a little salt. The meatballs were dense and lightly seasoned in a very nice light tomato sauce. Now these mushrooms just had so much incredible flavor with the nuts and cheese on top. I would go back for lunch and just order the mushrooms again and again and again. The front case with the dried meats and cheeses, olives and other assorted goodies has the best aroma coming out of it.

The Octopus was good , not spectacular (its hard to find this done perfectly) The chicken cacciatore was DELICIOUS! it was done fried with a sauce on the side...together it was just so good. Broccolini was a perfect side...cooked nicely and seasoned well. The breakfast was also done very well. We had TWO VERY good meals here and will be back again!!"

            "review": "I am writing this review based on two dining experiences for dinner about three weeks apart.  \n\nI will start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Giada and frequently use her recipes and cooking styles in my own every day cooking.  I consider myself to be a great home cook and have been told by many at my dinner table that I am a great cook.  Thank you, Giada (and some other Food Network Stars) for the years of training from the other end of the tv.\n\nEXPERIENCE #1\nThe first was on 10/24/14 and we were there to celebrate my mother's birthday.  We were a table of three.  I made reservations for this dinner months in advance and stated it was my mother's 70th birthday and on the day of I needed to downsize the reservation due to half of our party not arriving to Las Vegas until later due to flight delays.  We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation and were seated about 10 minutes after our time.  I felt as if we were being punished for changing the number in our party because as we were walked through the restaurant there were MANY (at least 5) four top tables available and we were seated at the table directly next to the entrance/exit to the kitchen.  We spent our entire time hearing the servers and runners yell \"corner\" as they darted in and out of the kitchen.  One of those yells didn't work out as a collision occurred and plates went flying and crashing to the ground.\n\nOur server was excellent, he was completely educated about the menu and very attentive to our questions and needs.  He checked in with us almost immediately after each course was delivered to our table.  I wish he could be my server every time I dine out!  \n\nThe food was very good with all of the courses devoured.  One issue with the food was it was inconsistent between two orders of the exact same dish, the Lemon Spaghetti.  Two of us ordered it and each tasted different (one had a good amount of sauce and the other had hardly any sauce and flavor on the pasta).\n\nOverall experience for this visit would be four stars.\n\nEXPERIENCE #2\nThe second visit was on 11/16/14.  We were a party of 8 seated at what looked like the only big table in the center of the dining room.  Being seated there was incredible because we could get the full impact of the ambiance of the restaurant.\n\nWe were greeted promptly by our server and food service assistant (not sure about the title).  Shortly after, we ordered drinks and then ordered our food a short while after that.  Bread was brought (which by the way is AMAZING) and we were enjoying our experience.\n\nOur food was brought out in courses.  The appetizer course was fantastic.  Next came the pasta and main courses, all brought at the same time.  The sides were brought out about 5 minutes later except my side which was brought out another 5 minutes after that.  Of the pasta and main course dishes, 5 out the 8 were great (especially the risotto which was ordered by two of our group).  Unfortunately, three of the dishes were not good.  We had to send back the lamb because the meat was spongy and two of our group ordered the Bucatini pasta (one of the two vegetarian options that are not a side dish or pizza) and it was completely flavorless.  After one guest sent back the lamb, the server was no where to be found and never checked in on the rest of our meals until 30 minutes later when plates were being cleared.  The two that had the Bucatini talked to the server and sent back their pasta.  The server asked if there was something else that he could prepare and my friend, a vegetarian, asked what was on the menu (other than the Rigatoni with mushrooms which he is allergic to) that he could have.  The server made a very snarky comment...\"I already reviewed the whole menu with you\".\n\nThe manager never came over to talk to us about the problems with our meal.  The food service assistant never brought the additional bread that we asked for and when we asked again, his response...\"oh, sorry\" and nothing further.\n\nI have to say that for a restaurant that categorizes themselves as fine dining and for the VERY EXPENSIVE price points, this type of service and the lack of caring that three of the five entree/pasta dishes had to be sent back is completely unacceptable.  When I shared my experience with my friends who are locals in LV, they told me that the buzz around town with the locals is that the restaurant is just average at best.\n\nOverall experience for the second visit would be 1/2 of a star, which is being generous.\n\nI am truly unsure if I will ever return to Giada's restaurant on one of my many trips to Vegas."

The weather was perfect, the windows were open and we were lucky enough to have a table with a gorgeous view of the sunset and the Bellagio fountains.  \nWe started by sharing the lemon ricotta crostini with prosciutto.  This was so delicious, I believe I will go back just to enjoy an array of their small plates.  For an entree I had the recommended lemon spaghetti and it was well worth it.  The portion size was plenty, with two enormous shrimp and delicious pasta.  I also want to mention the great bread plate, as there was obviously effort put into making this special.\nThe only disappointment was dessert.  The selections looked fairly boring, but we decided to split the tart with apples three-ways and cinnamon gelato.  It was quite awful.  I asked the server what the \"third-way\" was, since it obviously only had an apple chip and a large chunk of dry apple on top of dry puff pastry.  He admitted that their probably wasn't a \"third way\".  If this was indicative of their other sweet offerings, steer clear of dessert."

BUT worse than that, the food is unimaginative and the service is a joke. \n\nMy friend and I ordered a multi course meal - apps, salad, pasta course to share and two entrees (lamb chops and steak Milanese). About 20 minutes later, the servers arrives - WITH EVERY SINGLE COURSE IN HAND.  They start rearranging the table to fit everything.  I looked up at the lead server and asked \"what are you doing?!?  Every course together?\"  He then says, yes, that doesn't usually happen this way. Sorry - do you want me to take any of it back to the kitchen?\"  Im thinking DUH - why did you bring it out in the first place.  I was incredulous - but yes, we'd like to eat each course in order. It's and Italian restaurant. But I emphasized, PLEASE don't just put the entrees under a heat lamp. But no surprise, 30 minutes later the entrees were served to us again, warm on top, cold on the bottom. Heat lamp. \n\nThe food was mediocre and overpriced and obviously they have service issues. Luckily you have a few other choices. Unless you are a Giada fanatic, I can not imagine why you would spend your Vegas dining dollars there."

            "review": "Unfortunately we experienced the worst service here during our stay in Las Vegas. We dined all over the place and this was the most disappointing because of our server Christopher.\n\nFOOD\nOur lunch was good, but nothing spectacular. A nice, light lunch - portions are on the smaller side. If you have one of Giada's cookbooks you could probably replicate most of the menu yourself easily. \n\nSERVICE\nWe arrived on time but waited 10 minutes for our table, no big surprise. Restaurant was not what I would call busy though when we were finally seated. Our server, Christopher, greeted us and took our drink and food orders pretty quickly. This was the last we heard from him for at least 20 minutes. We're pretty patient people, but when you receive your food before your drinks you know your waiter is not doing his job. Christopher was either working a table of six women behind us (bigger tip prospects, I guess) or just standing around. We tried to get his attention several times when he walked by without checking on us to no avail. The bussers assisted us more in the end. When Christopher finally asked us how our food was (we were already done, waiting for the check by this point) my husband thanked him for finally coming back to check on us and Christopher seemed very surprised that we weren't happy with him. He apologized and said he was just slammed with tables (we counted three, including us). We didn't ask for any freebies but he did take our drinks off the check which was appreciated. I was going to speak with the manager on the way out, because Christopher's service was so bad - it was like we did something to piss him off...not order enough?...we were younger and this place was full of 60-yr-old's?...but the manager was sitting down and eating so I figured he was possibly the problem in the first place.\n\nLong story, I know, but looking back at our excellent dining experiences in Las Vegas with amazing servers our time at Giada and deep disappointment just needs to be said."

            "review": "One of the worst dining experiences of my life and by far the worst I have experienced in Las Vegas and if you look at my reviews you will see I spend a lot of time in Vegas. We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation time, didn't get seated until close to 30 minutes after reservation time. The first time I dined at Giada  about a year and a half ago they screwed up my reservation as well(see previous review), must be a theme here at Giada. Once seated we didn't get greeted by our waiter for 10 minutes. Drink order took 10 to 15  minutes to arrive. Waiter disappeared again. Comes back and we want to order first round appetizers and he tells about a chefs tasting menu but he has to disappear again for 5 minutes plus to retrieve menu. At this point we have been seated over 30 minutes and still have not placed an appetizer order. We finally order a couple appetizers and waiter disappeared again. The appetizers took an hour, keep in mind we still have not ordered additional courses or our main courses yet. I finally wave down waiter and ask about our appetizers an he seemed surprised that appetizers had not come yet....well if you did your job and checked in on us once in a while you would know they have not come yet. Between being seated 30 minutes late and the hour wait for appetizers we decided to skip additional courses and go straight to main based on limited time. Main course took another 20 or so minutes. At one point we needed a straw for a drink and there was nobody around I attempted to wave the waiter down a few times but he didn't see me so I had to get up and walk across the restaurant to the bar and grab a straw myself.  My fillet was not cooked to temp I requested(not even close), I ordered medium and it was rare at best and was cold(cool) probably from sitting after it was cooked and plated. it was a poor quality piece of meat as well, it was tough, not sure how a rare piece of meat can be tough but it was. We arrived at 7:20, got seated at 8 and finished main course at 10:05ish, we decided to skip dessert because we didn't have another hour to waste. \n\nThis was a special occasion anniversary dinner, they removed an appetizer charge from our bill and brought us a couple free cookies but that was absolutely meaningless to me, it was not about saving $15, this was supposed to be a very special evening but it was ruined. It was not about getting a free appetizer I would have gladly paid double the price to have an enjoyable evening or get a redo on the night. Thanks for ruining what was supposed to be a special evening...\n\nThis is an honest review, my first experience at Giada a year and a half ago was decent but this time it was a disaster. I will never go back and will never recommend it to anyone. If you read my other reviews you will see I rarely leave 1 star reviews, this was a situation where I wish there was an option for 0 stars because Giada earned 0 stars last night. The waiter should not be in the service industry, he was terrible. The place has security cameras everywhere so I hope management reads this review and goes back and reviews the tapes from 10/20/16 between 7:20-10:05pm and they will see exactly what I described above. \n\nStay away from this place, you have been warned!!!"

The food was unique and great flavors with each. The service we had (sitting at the bar) was FANTASTIC. Our server knew his food and actually guided our whole meal, we loved all has picks. Had 3 different cocktails, the Giagas Cocktail was my fav. Of all dishes the lobster ravioli with lemon mascarpone and capers was mouth watering. My only concern was price for the size of the serving, but other than that what a great experience! I would love to eat like that everyday. Servings were smaller but we left full, with great food like that you do not need to put on a feed bag. Ps anything with prosciutto! YUM... It was like butter."

He listed off the ingredients and I immediately told him that I HATED Gin. He said Id love this drink and because he was so confidant I tried it.. Loved it! The only Gin drink I have ever liked! Well, by this time it was 9pm. 45 mins into our reservation so we went to the front and we were assured we were up next. 5 mins later we were escorted to the tiniest table in the whole place with no view. The restaurant is lovely but this is an unacceptable table. We decided to eat at the Bar because it is actually much more comfortable. We ordered the Risotto and Ravioli. Both Amazing! We ordered Lemon Meringue for dessert. It is packed with flavor! Too good to get a picture of it. All in All I would recommend the restaurant but only because Rob made the experience memorable."

We were seated as soon as we arrived, plus. It took a solid 10-15 minutes before a waiter came over, negative. Service was kind of slow from there on out. I didn't realize until the waiter told us that most of the items on the menu are designed for \"tasting\" which basically means all the portions are small as hell. My husband joked that's how Giada stays skinny but I digress. We decided to order the small antipasti platter for an appetizer which was exactly as follows, two bacon wrapped dates, two tiny crostini topped with a slice of beef tenderloin, and two different stuffed peppers which came to a total of 4 items on the plate and it was $26. My husband then had a mortadella pizza, which seemed to be the best value on the menu for $13. He had the tomato soup also. I had the tricolore salad consisting of arugula, prosciutto, dates and some other things that weren't overly memorable for $17. We then each had the Brazilian wagyu beef short rib dinner which was very delicious but we should've ordered one meal and shared it because it was a whopping $56 each and we both couldn't finish it. The bill came to $205. It's probably the only expensive meal we will have this trip. I just can't see spending that much money on portions like that and had I realized in advance it was a small portioned menu, I most likely would've skipped this place even though I love Giada."

We took the escalators up to the restaurant and were greeted by the rudest and most non welcoming hostesses who lacked personality and tact. First impressions are everything and they certainly left a sour taste in our mouth. \n\nWe went to the bar for a drink before we were seated. The bartender was friendly and soon to find out it would be the best part of our experience.\n\nWe were seated in the middle of the restaurant. We asked to be moved to the window to which  the hostess stated \"the servers aren't on shift over there so it would be another 15 minute wait.\" We declined as we had a show at 7pm at another hotel. The music is regular pop music. I prefer Italian music at an Italian restaurant on the strip to make you feel like you are having a full dining experience. \n\nWe started with appetizers with the Margherita Pizzette. Extremely small and extremely doughy. The toppings, including the cheese fell off the pizza as soon as you took a bite. We also ordered the Artichoke Arancini which was very good. The bread served was pretty good as well. For our main dishes we both ordered Pasta Primavera which is not on the menu, but it is something we wanted. They were willing to make it which was nice. When it was served they did not offer to grate cheese over the pastas. (isn't that what we come to Italian restaurants for? Cheese on pasta!?) We asked for cheese and they brought it. Portions were small for the price. Overall mediocre pasta. Our server was friendly but often disappeared. Our bus boy was friendly as well. \n\nThe tables are on top of each other so naturally you strike up a convo with the people sitting next to you which is fine, but leaves little privacy. \n\nI absolutely would not go back to the restaurant. I can guarantee it is only a short while until it is closed as the reviews are awful for the price and the taste. Poorly done restaurant. Not impressed in the slightest bit and I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are WAY better local spots to enjoy an Italian meal. By far one of the worst dining experiences I have had in Las Vegas."

Prosciutto and parmesian crisps $11: tasty combination. American breakfast with meatballs $19 disappointing and nothing memorable, you'll need a glass of water as they're on the dry side.  \n2. Strawberry waffle: standard served with nutella. Couldn't tell if it was homemade or from the jar.  4 pieces for $18. Opt for 4 boxes of leggos and stay home.  Mixed bakery: yogurt cake - nice.  Monkey bread - nice and sweet \n3. Brunch tasting $45: Nice antipasti selection.  Bakery items: was it a scone or fingerprint cookie (couldn't tell).  It made for a good cookie. Main course -chix and waffles - waffles light and crunchy, go well with syrup.  Chix could use moisture.  Pass on the souffle. Ms. DeLaurentiis should redo her recipe. Again,  was confused about whether it was a citrus souffle or egg custard?  The tasting menu gives you a few alternative; you might do better with the other dishes.  \n\nOverall,  highly disappointing meal as there was nothing to make us want to go back, unfortunately.  This is Vegas and we want to be wowed.  It just doesn't feel like the effort is being made.  Put meals on a plate that resemble authentic Giada style. At this rate,  Giada's better hope Vegas continues to bring in unsuspecting tourists willing to pay high pricey for standard to substandard meals.  Hopefully it's around long enough to make needed changes. Hopefully Ms. DeLarentiis actually reads Yelp."

This time Giada was our choice for Saturday night. \n\nThe good:\nThe ambiance of the place was great.  The check-in process was very efficient, and we sat in the bar / waiting area and had drinks while we waited for our table (we arrived early to enjoy a drink).  Our table was ready right on time (in fact a few minutes early) and we were seated in the smaller room off the main dining area (which was fine with all of us).  \n\nThe not so good:\nFirst, let's talk about the food.  We ordered a lot of appetizers for the group to try a bunch of things.  It came to the table very quickly - which was great.  In terms of quality though, none of it was bad, but none of it was great.  We all considered it very pedestrian - and I think the best word to sum it up: \"meh\". \n\nSecond, we had a party of five people.  We all know that there are a set number of pieces for most dishes (4 pieces, 6 pieces).  Most high-end restaurants we've been will ask us if we would like to have an extra piece made for the group so everyone can try something (and our answer is always yes - regardless of the extra fee).  That wasn't offered here - in fact - the one place we did ask for it - it didn't happen.  We were informed that the standard pizza was cut in to four pieces.  We politely asked if they could have it cut in to five pieces.  Needless to say, our request wasn't well received and sure enough - not 2 minutes later - out comes a pizza in four pieces.  We don't even think the request was passed on given how quickly it came out (nor did the server mention anything about it).\n\nLast, one of our party had ordered a beer and he considered it too warm.  The bottle was reasonably cold - but the beer itself inside was actually quite warm.  He asked if they could please get him another one - and after a brief exchange (I don't think they really understand why he was asking) - they got him a fresh one.  Same problem here - warm inside.  So they took this one and put it in a bucket of ice for a few minutes after we asked again for a cold one - needless to say the problem wasn't effectively solved (and again - no apologies for the inconvenience or offers for something else).  \n\nSummary:\nWe had very high expectations (the night before we enjoyed a great meal at a different restaurant) - but unfortunately, this restaurant didn't deliver.  The best I can say was the food was \"meh\" and the service was just OK but certainly not great.  There are a lot of other great restaurants in Las Vegas and I think that Giada's is going to really have to step up the game if they want to compete."

            "review": "My friends and I visited Las Vegas for the first time the week of 6/30 through 7/7.  We decided that Saturday night we would enjoy a fine dining experience and then see what the nightlife had to offer.  We got dressed and headed out to the strip sometime around 7PM.  After debating on where to eat we settled on Giada (she is my partner and I's favorite chef after all!).  We were all dressed in appropriate attire, however at the reception desk we were treated as though we had walked in wearing flip-flops and tattered shorts.  We made our way up the escalator and I approached the desk.  A young dirty-blonde haired woman greeted me and I stated that I had a party of 6 and we wished to have dinner.  She started to say \"Oh I\"m sorry but we...\"  At that moment another blonde haired woman (slightly older) literally nudged her with her elbow and said \"be nice\".  She then preceded to ask me if I would perhaps like to see the menu before we were seated.  Essentially she was insinuating that we obviously could not afford a meal there and looked the part to boot.  I was infuriated, however being the opposite of what hey assumed I was I played along and agreed to see the menu.  We were then whisked away on a tour of the kitchen area and finally seated.  The drink menu was very unique (based on Giada's father's favorite films), I had a Hannibal which was great and my partner had the Barbarella (his favorite film) which was equally refreshing.  We ordered Giada's favorites and calamari for the table as the antipasto, spaghetti and tortellini for the pasta and shared the porterhouse steak with a side of polenta.  The food was amazing just as we expected, however the treatment by the staff left a sour taste in our mouths.  There were other patrons sitting near us wearing shorts and t-shirts whom I am sure were not treated as we were.  The main reason in my opinion is because we mostly looked Hispanic unlike the fairer skinned individuals who were poorly dressed.  While the food was amazing, we will not be visiting Giada again.  I myself have experienced true Italian hospitality, unfortunately it was nowhere to be found at Giada."

The waffles were delicious however we were required to refill our water on our own. I sat there for over 10 mins while all of the servers were standing around talking (there was only about 6-7 tables so it was slow). Not once did the server check with us to see how the food tasted or offer more drinks. I actually refilled mine and my sisters water when we were out. I do not have plans of returning again. I knew it was expensive but went for the experience, however the service is better at the buffets or any restaurant we went to besides Giadas. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

We elected not to do the Giada tasting menu for a couple of reasons. One, I had my eyes set on the veal chop. And two, I felt the selection would have taken the experience from a culinary sampling and turned it into a tourist experience. They included an autographed picture of Giada and some recipes.  And that option would be fine if I wasn't so interested in making my own selections.  We started with a bottle of champagne and a antipasti sampler platter and it was delicious. Bacon wrapped dates, cream stuffed peppers, crostini, and filet on toast with a pesto sauce. Wow. Our entrees were very large portions. I ordered the veal chop saltambucca Milanese style. I could rank that dish alone in my top five of all time. Splendid sauce and a perfect cook to a delicate piece of veal. Our dessert was some chocolate tower which I wish we had more of and a lemon hazelnut torte. Perfect way to end the night was with a drink recommended by the waiter. A spicy liquor with a double shot of cappuccino over ice. It was divine!"

Our food came out before we even received our bottle of wine. We finally had to ask for the manager once we were almost done with our meal why we STILL hadn't even gotten it. We also ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was extremely fishy, not fresh at all and at this point we were already having a negative experience.  Overall would never go back here any of our future trips and have already told family members who are going in a few weeks to avoid this restaurant!"

Due to a schedule mix up and the holiday, we were only able to get here for breakfast. \n\nFirst, the place is gorgeous, top to bottom, from the entry to the restaurant floor itself, the d\u00e9cor is modern but warm and inviting without being the appearance of trying too hard, just a very pleasant place to eat. Very reflective of the chef herself I think and how she presents herself on her show. There are peekaboo views of some of the best parts of the strip from most of the room, but depending on your seating many of the window front seats have full views of the Bellagio fountain show and Cesar's Palace adding to the entertainment value. \n\nThe service was attentive and pleasant from the attractive front desk concierges, to well dressed waiter, we felt very well taken care of. Further nice touches with branded name placemats and napkins, though I wonder how many thousands of \"Giada\" napkins they have budgeted to lose to souvenir hunters in their first year! \n\nBut we came for the food, and that should be the bulk of my review. Everything we ate was simply incredible. We ordered the caprese frittata with the prosciutto, and the sunrise waffle. The waffle was light and crispy, really excellent, while the frittata had fresh creamy mozzarella both baked in and in dollops, as well as very tasty heirloom tomatoes, just a really solid offering. We also had the lemon smashed potatoes as a side, these were so very good, I could not eat enough of these. They were sort of Yukon gold fingerling potatoes with cheese, lemon sauce and spices. Really good. Even the sourdough toast came with a plate of well conceived fresh butter, spreads and fresh raspberry jam. The breakfast drink menu, while expensive, offered several interesting choices, the Palm, a pineapple/apple/mint/lemon concoction was delicious. \n\nIn short, despite being a very expensive option for breakfast, at nearly $90 for two, the food here is incredibly good, I look forward to trying their dinner menu at some future point. Clearly a lot of thought went into the breakfast menu, which was creative, and very tasty, so I imagine the lunch and dinner menus will be the same. Giada is highly recommended!"

Uns wurde aber auch vorgeschlagen, an der Bar (im Restaurant) zu essen, dann k\u00f6nnten wir uns direkt dort unsere Pl\u00e4tze aussuchen. Da wir ziemlich hungrig waren, haben wir das Angebot angenommen. So hat man zwar nicht so viel von der Aussicht, aber das Ambiente ist wirklich toll, so dass man die Aussicht nicht vermisst.\nDie Esspl\u00e4tze an der Bar werden genauso sorgf\u00e4ltig eingedeckt, wie an den Tischen (au\u00dfer der Stofftischdecke nat\u00fcrlich). Wir hatten nur kurz unseren Groupon-Gutschein vorgezeigt und bald darauf kam schon der kostenlose Champagner. \u00dcberraschenderweise wirklich guter und vor allem echter Champagner (\u00fcblicherweise bekommt sonst eher Sekt - der schmeckt wie ein Billigangebot aus Supermarkt - wenn auf der Karte Champagne steht). Ehrlich gesagt war allein schon der Champagner unseren bezahlten Groupon-Kaufpreis (19$ f\u00fcr beide) wert.\nWir haben uns beide Pizza bestellt (2 verschiedene). Die Pizza war handgemacht und einfach nur k\u00f6stlich. Man konnte sogar dem Koch bei der Zubereitung zusehen. Die Form der Pizza ist oval (nicht rund) und wirkt so auf den ersten Blick ziemlich klein. Keine Angst - man wird trotzdem richtig satt und das mit Hochgenuss. Wir hatten au\u00dferdem eine Flasche Mineralwasser bestellt - es war sogar importiertes Wasser aus Italien. \nInsgesamt ein tolles stimmiges Ambiente, zwar zu gehobenen Preisen - aber die Speisen sind jeden Cent wert.

The Chardonnay we shared was good,  Jordan 2012. The artichoke arrenchini was fried excellently but I couldn't find the artichoke.  I take that back I choked on a hard fibrous piece. I had the surf and turf. The filet was excellent but the crab raviolo was hard and I can't say the taste was fishy but there was an unpleasant taste . It was one raviolo and small! The side of broccoli rabe was unacceptable! So much so I told server and they gave us roasted cauliflower as a replacement.  The broccoli rabe was tough and fibrous and over charred.  I am Italian and I guess my expectations are too high. My friend had salmon and enjoyed.  I was curious about the Strata cocktail so I had that for dessert,  it was good!

We quickly checked the recipe from the magazine and it didn't list any pork.  (I should also mention that my husband and I don't eat pork products).  We asked the waiter and the manager about it and they were both confused.  Turned out that the kitchen just recently started adding the pork.

When we were seated at the table, our waiter came over to tell us right away about a \"fire\" they had on Friday night in their pizza oven so no pizzas were available.  I would think if a large portion of the menu was not available, they would maybe add additional items like some pasta dishes.  The special of the day was lasagna and one other pasta is on the menu.  I asked if the pasta could be made with another sauce as I did not want the carbonara sauce, I was told simply no.  I am a big fan of small plates and ordered some antipasta items.  The mushrooms were ok, but lacked flavor.  The orzo meatballs were small and also lacked flavor.  The burrata cheese was tasty, but was served without bread???  NEVER in my whole life could I imagine a traditional Italian restaurant not serving bread.  We were told Giada didn't like how it was coming out so it was taken off the menu.  I have a thought...if your staff isn't able to prepare bread to your liking, there are several tremendous bakeries in town, maybe give them a call?  When we were done with these 3 very small plates, we decided to leave and have our holiday lunch at Olives instead.  Great service, great food, and a much better atmosphere.  I wish Giada luck, with all the fabulous restaurants in town, her staff will have their work cut out for them."

This was a disappointment as we were also guests staying at The Cromwell...you would think that they would have few tables \"on hold\" for guests of the hotel--that was not the case, even after he spoke to the hostess on the phone. Lunch selection was limited. I have shellfish allergies and I don't eat red meat--so my choices were sparse. The portions are small, we had chicken meatballs and orzo meatballs--per our server recommendation, and ordered a pizza to share and shared a dessert. The signature cocktail was delish! The food was tasty...wish our server explained portion size so that we weren't shocked and had to order more food. The restaurant was beautiful but we were both unimpressed by the overall experience and still hungry as we left. \nI would recommend trying for Dinner reservations...and not the Lunch menu."

Giada came to mind, and based on past experience, I really thought we all could enjoy it. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to our prior experiences.\nAmbiance - fortunately, that hasn't changed. The photo booth is still there in the waiting area. A fun way to kill some time while you are waiting for your table. Entering through the bar is still drop dead beautiful, with the glass wall in front of you looking out on the Strip. We requested, and got, a table by the window. Wonderful view!\nFood - This was a big disappointment. The last 2 times we were here, one dish was better than the next. This time, not so much. My wife started with the pea soup. It is a cold soup served in an ice cold very large bowl. Very impressive presentation. But the flavor was meh. I had the risotto with crab and scallops. Except I asked for shrimp instead of the scallops. The  2 jumbo shrimp were delish. The scraps of crab that I think were in the dish were hard to find and added nothing to the flavor (maybe they thought I wanted only shrimp and no crab or scallops??).  The dish was edible, but certainly not good. Our friend ordered the surf and turf. She was very clear that she wanted the meat to be medium well. When it came, it was red on the inside - rare! It took them about 15 minutes to bring her dish back. My wife and I were nearly done with our meal before that arrived. Basically, she ate alone. And the surf part of the dish was one piece of lobster ravioli - about 1 inch in diameter. Disappointing \"surf\" portion of the meal. \nService - Our prior experiences with Giada included great service. Not so this time. Our server was very personable. Unfortunately, not very attentive. When we pointed out the problem with my friend's dish, she agreed with the error in preparation. No apology. The manager, who spent a lot of time with the people at the next table (I suspect VIPs) never dropped by to apologize. Yes, they comped her meal. That didn't make up for the fact that she had to eat alone after we had finished. Add that to the fact that they didn't bring the bread or refill our waters without our having to hunt down our server to ask for it.\nTo sum up, ambiance still 5 stars, food 3 to 4 star, and service, I will be generous and give 3 stars. I was torn between a 3 or 4 star overall rating. Considering the price of the meal, I decided to go with 3 star."

My boyfriend really got it right this time by surprising me with a dinner here for our one year anniversary. \n\nAmbiance: I really enjoyed that the entrance had its own personal escalators to walk in which made it more secluded from the rest of the casino. The decorations were nice as well, kind of an upscale rustic look. They also had a photo booth available in the waiting area, but we didn't get a chance to use it. Once seated at the table I enjoyed that we still had a nice view of the strip, but was a bit disappointed in the atmosphere. I thought it would be a bit more romantic but it seemed like a mix of families, business meetings and dates. I also would have liked the tables to be further apart and more private.\n\nFood: I honestly loved everything we ordered. To start we had a complementary bread arrangement with came with a few breadsticks, crispy flat bread and rosemary potted bread. This also came with toppings like butter, red pepper flakes, capers and sea salt. I sampled each of the bread choices and each one was very good. For an appetizer we had the fritto miso. The calamari was delicious, probably the best I've ever had in my life. The shrimp was also cooked perfectly too. The only downside on this dish was the amount of sauce to dip in didn't go a very long way. Next I had the romaine salad which was very good. The dressing was very light, but delicious. My boyfriend had the chopped tricolore salad which he said was very good as well. For entrees I went with the spaghetti. I really enjoyed the subtle hints of lemon and most of all the perfectly cooked prawns. My boyfriend went with the surf and turf. The steak was delicious, super tender and topped with a very tasty sauce. He also really enjoyed the asparagus and mashed potato sides. For dessert we received a couple complimentary cookies. I really liked the lemon cookie, but didn't care as much for the chocolate peanut butter one.\n\nOverall I was very satisfied with this visit and am very glad I got to finally try it out. I highly recommend this place for any special occasion."

It's sad because I'm such a huge fan of Giada but her restaurant hype wasn't all what I expected.\n\nFirst off, we came here to celebrate my Bfs birthday. my server Gregory was so awkward and rude. He rushed us to order our food. It was so weird because out of all the restaurants I've been too, I've never been rushed. He even waited awkwardly until we ordered our main entrees. If I'm going to pay $200 on food don't rush us. Cater to your customers first they are the ones that make the business. I understand you want to keep the flow of the kitchen, but don't tell us \"I prefer you order your entrees now\" even when we ordered our appetizers, he was like \"that's it\" um yes that's it because I want to order my entrees later but instead rushes us and waits awkwardly.. Who does that? \n\nOnce the service sucks the whole experience is ruined especially on a special occasion. \n\nI have to give it to the busser tho, we wished he was our waiter. My tip should of went to him. \n\nHer dishes were pretty good.\nWe liked the Rosemary bread that was served, the paperdalle was a little on the salty side but still delicious, the Parmesan with the homemade fig sauce had a great flavor and last but not least the orzo meatballs were delicious. \n\nIt's a little expensive for the amount tho. \n\nOverall ambience and the food were great\nBut Mr.Gregory needs a lesson in manners."

The food was fresh and it was delicious and it was literally perfect. My favorite dish has always been the rack of lamb. To be specific, I have been to the restaurant nine times and have had it seven times! The last time that I was there, it was just OK. This time, today, it was a disaster! Is there a new chef? Am I missing something?\nWe started with the Verdure antipasto: medium size for $49. It is mainly vegetables in different combinations. It also contains olives. It was good. The initial bread that came out was OK yet, as usual, very oily. My friend ordered the yellow tomato soup which had a very tiny amount of soup but was OK to taste. She went ahead and ordered the seafood lasagna and said that it was absolutely disappointing as the seafood was overcooked. She is a seafood fanatic so if anyone knows proper seafood, she is definitely at the top of her game. She was disappointed and said she would never get the dish again. As for me, I ordered the rack of lamb. I ordered it medium and it was practically medium raw. The worst part is that it looked like it was rotting as it was breaking down off the bones with a lot of fat on it and just very unattractive and unappealing to the pallet. It looked old like it was wasting away rather than fresh delicious lamb that is properly cooked. To make it worse, there was this cold quinoa concoction along with it that was just disgusting. Cold quinoa with warm lamb??? Not to mention, again, the lamb was terrible. $54 for a dish that was as good as a bad dish that was $25.00 at a Denny's or Fridays.\nThe bill, and we had no alcohol, came out to $160. No dessert either! When the prices this high, the quality better be phenomenal... It was anything but phenomenal. I am so disappointed in this restaurant and will not be coming back. I contemplated, as did my friend, calling the manager over to tell them how bad the meal was, but we were not looking for a free meal. We also did not want to make a scene. Quite frankly, my thoughts on it I don't want to restaurant is this expensive, there is absolutely no room for error. Today, huge errors were made. This restaurant is no longer worth the money that it charges and I would not recommend it at all. Unfortunately, this restaurant was a very poor presentation of the chef it represents.\nI will say that the service was nice. We had a very nice waiter and I felt bad because it was obvious to him that I did not really touch a lot of my rack of lamb but I was not saying anything and I think he was trying to be polite as well. Therefore, no complaints about service. I have lots of complaints about the quality of the food and the price associated with it. Therefore, not recommended."

We arrived a bit early for our reservation, so I started out at the bar with wine. Great service at the bar and the Riesling was one of the best I've had. Once seated, our server was excellent at explaining the menu and answering questions. You get a platter of 3 types of bread. One is a parmesan flatbread, then there was grissini and focaccia, which is accompanied with basil pesto, capers, red pepper, and sea salt. The focaccia was great, but I wasn't a big fan of the parmesan flatbread. For a starter course, I had the bacon wrapped dates. These were great, and they came in a chili oil which gave them a nice kick and differentiated from the same dish at other places. For a main dish, I had pappardelle which had a pork ragout. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and then ragout was great as well. One execution error here: it took a long time to get a second glass of wine after finishing the first, but aside from this service was pretty good."

The polenta was perfect, with just the right kind of sausage. Sometimes Italian sausage has too many herbs and spices for me. This was just right. The Contadina breakfast was similar to your typical American scrambled eggs and toast breakfast, but it came with a tasty accompaniment of spinach and sundried tomatoes.\n\nWe enjoyed the thick breakfast toast. Our server gave us a condiment platter of cream cheese/lemon zest, walnut/chocolate nut butter and raspberry jam. All were tasty toppers for our toast. \n\nWe also ordered a very tasty bloody mary.\n\nService was prompt and reliable. Prices are not cheap; but portions are just right.

Finally we ordered!!! The appetizers arrived but we still not have any wine on the table and no bread, we asked several time for that, our server check on us after 10 minutes the appetizers were on the table and finally we got the wine. \nAppetizers were good, nothing to die for but good quality of food. The worst surprise was the pasta. I got Fettuccine with tomato carpaccio and my husband spinach gnocchi. My pasta was just a fettuccine in a case of melted butter, after two bite I feel I want throw up, my husbands tortellini was overcooked. \nWhat a shame!!! \nA beautiful restaurant on the Strip, nice decor, 30 minutes waiting and we just got horrible food!!!! \nTwo stars because on the desserts they put a congratulations for our 3 years together. Otherwise I want give 0 stars at this place!!!!"

They had dessert carts instead of made-to-order desserts. all the desserts were pre made, so I wasn't too crazy about that. Overall we still had a great time."

It was almost stringy and soggy.\n\n-Lobster Ravioli, ravioli was dry, the wrapper felt like it wasn't cooked through, I tasted no cheese in the filling (per our waiter there was suppose to be cheese? lack of this probably made it dry).\nThe sauce it came with was not sauce. It tasted and looked like a stick of butter melted and plopped on the plate. \n\n-Shrimp spaghetti, was the best tasting dish. Meaning, it was not amazing, but it was just ok. It was really salty and dry.\n\nFor about $34-36 per pasta dish, they were small and really disappointing. \n\nThere are so many other delicious places for this price range in vegas."

I was a skeptic at first...I thought it would be another over-priced celebrity chef restaurant on the strip.  I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.  I ordered the ribeye and my wife had the lamb chops.  Both were cooked perfectly.  The ribeye was seasoned to perfection and the lamb was very tasty.  \n\nWhile the restaurant is expensive, it was totally worth it.  Service was fantastic and the wine list had great variety and value."

We arrived at the Cromwell and were greeted at Valet by the nicest Valets I have ever experienced in Vegas. We made our way upstairs to the hostess station at the restaurant and were told our table would be ready in a couple of minutes. To pass the time we went into the photo booth and took some photos to remember the day by. Just as we were done in the photo booth, our table was ready. The restaurant itself is large and very open. It is beautifully decorated with huge movie posters of movies that Dino De Laurentiis produced in his amazing career. Next time we go however we will try to get a seat by the window as it is an amazing view. But enough of the stuff no one cares about, lets get to the food. \n\nWe had the wood roasted mushrooms, the baby sweet peppers, the sweet ricotta pizza, and the muffuletta. We loved every single one of them. Basically this was one of the best overall meals I have had in a restaurant in a very long time. \n\nAlso the service was great and Giada herself was in the restaurant going to some tables and talking to them. Although we didn't get to meet her we love that she is there talking to her fans."

            "review": "Very disappointing. Came here with high hopes!\n\nFirst we were sat 30 minutes after our reservation. Our server \"Tim\" was the biggest disappointment of the evening. Every time he came to our table he seemed rushed and impersonal. After viewing the menu, we decided on three dishes to share for two of us plus a soup for each of us. Tim instantly said, \"is this all for you folks? This is a very light meal.\" After we said this was all for now, he clearly \"checked out\" and no longer gave us the quality service we expected. \n\nTim was hard to come by. After our four dishes we waited patiently for awhile for the fifth to come out. Tim finally visited our table to condescending say, \"Were these portions good for you?\" We instantly realized he had completely FORGOTTEN about our fifth dish. \n\nAt this point we were disappointed and asked for our check, disregarding that he had forgotten about our last dish. Tim took too long to drop off our check, which he did by throwing bluntly on the table without saying any words.  \n\nOverall negative experience. Won't be back. When you \"only\" order five dishes for two people you should still be entitled to quality and respectful service. \n\nBut the free bread was amazing."

            "review": "I don't watch TV and the only food I can make comes out of a toaster. I had no idea the \"Giada\" in the name of this place referred to a renowned woman with many culinary (and cultural) accolades - I genuinely found out who she was about 45 minutes after arriving at The Cromwell for our 7:15 reservations, which is even more amazing/depressing when you stop and realize I was the one who booked the reservation for our meal last Friday night. Nonetheless, for a guy on the outside of pop culture cooking looking in, Giada managed to impress me from presentation to service, while the food definitely delivered on the reputation this gal has made for herself.\n\nGiada sits at the top of a couple escalators, or at the end of a very lengthy white hallway, if you take the elevator, in The Cromwell. I actually suggest taking the elevator because I imagine making that extended walk is how football players feel on their way to the field, or how surgeons get heading for the operating room: lives are about to be changed through that hallway and Facebook photos will undoubtedly be posted. Once you get to the entrance, it's a surprisingly small waiting room to the left of a hostess desk flanked by a duo of dashing young ladies that have style to burn. You can rest on a couple of sofa cushions, head to the right where the bar and bathrooms are, or you could stop in the photobooth near the sofas to kill time and post a few wacky pictures to Facebook - bonus points are awarded (not really) if you are wearing a shirt that makes you blend in with the wallpaper in this booth, like I did (without my maroon sweater vest, I think I would have looked like a disembodied floating head against that background).\n\nWe were slightly early for our reservation but in no time at all, a hostess escorted us (still ahead of our time! Score!) to our table in the window overlooking The Strip. The dining room is kind of tiered, with the bar at the top and the dining rooms unfolding outward, blending in chairs and horseshoe-style booths. Now is a good time to mention that the view here cannot be beat if you're in the window seats: major brownie points can only be won with your date when The Bellagio's water show kicks into action across the street and you're on your third bottle of wine.\n\nOur server, along with all the food runners and bussing staff, were attentive without being overwhelming. Following our technological snafu with the \"interactive drink menu\" (read: an iPad), our server got us started with orzo meatballs, a margherita flatbread, a beet-and-apple salad and a couple rounds of this awesome bread combo. I never got to try the flatbread (the four pieces in it were scarfed down quickly) but those meatballs made me question how I've gone this long in life without eating them. Kind of like how I managed to live all these years without tasting lobster ravioli like the kind from here - that ravioli was heavenly, and everyone else expressed similar sentiments for their tortellini and pappardelle dishes.\n\nBefore dessert could arrive and threaten to end my life right there via caloric overload, I escaped to the bathroom. This has nothing to do with anything, but aside from being spotless, these were also the best smelling bathrooms I've ever been in. I'm tempted to start doing my laundry in one of the stalls if I could figure out how to get there on a regular basis from Dallas.\n\nWith eyes bigger than our stomachs, we opted for a selection of \"Giada's favorite cookies.\" I can safely say this woman knows fine taste: chocolate chip was what you'd expect, the peanut butter (and jelly!) were a pleasant surprise, but the lemon ricotta cookies... I'm not a \"dessert person\" but I think I actually wept while eating those. Tears of happiness and savoriness, mind you.\n\nIf there are any nitpicks to make, they are minor. Management was scattered about and did not seem to put too much worth on the customer experience: I think I saw a manager talk to two, maybe three tables. That's unfortunate for a spot like this, as I would like to see the \"higher ups\" at the least asking how everything is, and possibly even displaying a personality and/or a pulse. I also don't know what to think about the special dinner that comes with an autographed picture of Giada herself. It's a cute promotion but, if Giada, or her PR people are reading this, this place is better than that kind of gimmick.\n\nAgain, totally minor, practically inconsequential critiques to be made. Sure, the price can be steep if you do not do your homework but look at the complete package: friendly servers and hostesses, a priceless view and a menu that made a believer out of a guy who had no idea who the woman behind everything was. That last part alone should be enough to get your foot in the door if you are even slightly considering this destination on your next Vegas trip."

When you are asked to wait, sit at the bar order a drink and the hostess wishes to seat you without the drink or the tab the service is not transparent. You have to wait until you get their attention to ring the tab as opposed to sending the tab to the  table. \nJoseph was exceptional, his training on service and the menu were quite apparent."

However, someone has to pay for the rent in that new and prominent Cromwell hotel.  I walked out after dinner feeling violated financially, in other words, ripped off.  $9 for a small bottle of sparking water.  Come on.  The food was good but the small portions and high prices makes me a one time customer.  The waiter was pushing the fixed price dinner at $120 per person.  (The whole table has to order it.)  When we didn't go for it, the service dropped off noticeably.  I got suckered in."

I made reservations via Open Table, so of course, it was simple. \n\nWe had a moment before our table was ready, so I was excited to check out the photo booth. It's a very cool set up of having a built-in complimentary photo booth, except it is a very tight space and it's difficult to reach the screen and be situated when the session starts. It was also unfortunate for us that their printer was out of service that morning! Sad face! They do allow you to send the photos via e-mail, but the pixel quality is atrocious.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful and the view of The Strip (and Bellagio fountains) is great. I love the open kitchen and the antipasti bar. We were given a table next to the floor-to-ceiling windows, which was very nice. The chairs were comfortable, too. \n\nWe started with Orzo Meatballs with Parmesan Pomodoro ($15) and Burrata with Balsamic Salt ($12). The meatballs were tender and flavorful; very satisfying. The Burrata was also delicious; really creamy and great with that balsamic salt, EVOO, and micro arugula. Both fantastic Antipasti dishes. They also offer complimentary bread that appears to be baked in a similar fashion to pizza (it may be their pizza dough). It's served with a yummy pesto oil.\n\nLobster Roll ($35): Lemon Basil A\u00efoli and Fried Capers. All sandwiches are served with Arugula Salad or Zucchini Scapecce. I chose the Zucchini Scapecce, but was served the salad, so our server graciously brought a small plate of scapecce to the table. It was a great error because I truly enjoyed the salad AND the scapecce! They were delicious alone and with my sandwich. The sandwich is open-faced and stacked with scrumptious lobster meat. The mixture was so tasty!\n\nVenetian Panino ($18): Turkey, Gruy\u00e8re, Fontina, whole mustard, and Peppadew. This panini sandwich was also well-made and delicious. It not entirely exciting, so I probably wouldn't order it over all the other menu selections. My mom really enjoyed it though!\n\nG's Baked Pasta of the Day ($24): The lasagna had layers of eggplant as well as your usual suspects. This was really, really good lasagna. I love the addition of eggplant layers to make it a bit more healthy. \n\nChocolate Tiramisu ($8): Chocolate Zabiaone and espresso-soaked ladyfingers. Tiramisu is one of my absolute favorite desserts and this is seriously one of the best tiramisu I've ever had the pleasure of eating. They also wrote a very nice \"Happy Birthday\" message on the plate.\n\nEspresso Nocciolato ($9): Lavazza Gran Riserva, Nutella, whipped cream, toasted hazelnuts, and a light dusting of cocoa powder. This was really tasty and a fun way to drink a shot of espresso!\n\nThe food was all delicious! The service was wonderful and we had a very pleasant experience. It was a fantastic birthday celebration. My only complaint: Why is everything so petite??! You pay quite a premium on the dishes that I didn't expect from Giada. Also, beware that you are charged for \"still\" water! I thought they meant tap water when I was asked (they only offered still or sparkling), so I was surprised to see the charge on the bill. Oddly, they only served us the one bottle, then switched to tap water without asking us if we wanted another bottle of still water."

Very generous amount of good prosciutto, super light and crunchy good bread, good cheese, simply perfect. Can't get too much better. \nSweet ricotta pizza, sounds good, right? Tastes great too! Dough is so fluffy crunchiness to perfection. Ricotta's little sweetness n balsamic reductions tanginess with arugula's earthiness are simply awesome. Good size, too.

We were told we would not be seated until 9am and to have a seat.  When we did go in we noticed people sitting at the bar....we were not offered a seat at the bar !  It appeared that the 2 hostesses were very busy discussing their social life and their hair.  We did mention this to the girls when we left and they had no comment!  So, the restaurant lost some bar revenue.\n\nFood wasn't so great.  My Italian Hash was mostly tomatoes and came just warm.  For the price, not much on my plate.  My husbands breakfast was a little better but what was with those potatoes?  Best item was the pastry tray....4 miniature pastries for $15.  Keep your pastry chef, this was the best part of our $100 breakfast!!\n\nWe had a rather snooty waiter with a nice accent but when we were almost done he stopped bringing coffee around, as if to say, time to give up your window table!  When we finally asked for more he simply said \"I didn't know you wanted anymore\". \nThe restaurant was beautiful and I may come back, but not for breakfast."

Very attentive, knowledgeable and courteous :)\n\nWe decided to go there for lunch on Sunday, so we called and made a reservation Sunday morning. We were glad we did, because we saw so many groups talked to the hostess and then walked away probably because the wait could be long without the reservation.\n\nWe sat next to the window facing Caesars Palace, and we also enjoyed the frantic view of traffic on Las Vegas Blvd with lots of honking sound :)\n\nAs mentioned by so many Yelpers, the interior is gracefully decorated with a homestyle-chic feel to it. It is also spacious and well lit with natural lighting.  Very relaxing and very clean.\n\nDo I mention they have photo booth and tons of merchandise?\n\nThe food is definitely on the expensive side as the portion is relatively small. But I really enjoy my Muffuletta Sandwich with Arugula Salad, and warm Citrus Infused Italian Doughnut drizzled with powdered sugar plus Nutella (we waited a good 20 minutes for it though).\n\nI would come back again with more people so that I could order antipasti and try its famous meatball!"

For our first night in Las Vegas, we decided on a fancy date night GIADA! As we walked in, we were met with an elegant and simplistic d\u00e9cor as well as the place settings. While we waited for our awesome server, we took in the view of the strip as the sun set down. Our server came with the various menus that were available for the night. After giving us a few minutes, he came back to suggest vegetarian options, which matched what my husband and I wanted to try. Normally, we share an appetizer and a main course but our server told us that the portions are on the smaller side so we could sample more dishes.\n \nOur Meal\n\nBread Plate (we LOVED the Garlic Rosemary bread baked in the cast iron bowl)\nCipollini Onions\nRigatoni with Vegetable Bolognese\nSwiss Chard Rolls\nLemon Potatoes\nChocolate Tart (which had 24k Gold shavings!)\n \nOur server was friendly and jovial making our meal a very pleasant one. The atmosphere was perfect for a date night (casual or fancy). The portions are also ideal so one can try multiple dishes. All items were cooked to perfection, with each of the ingredients standing on its own without overpowering the others. We definitely plan on coming back for another meal the next time we are in town. Can't wait to try more of Giada's specialties."

I make my own pastas and pizzas from scratch and have dined at some very well respected Italian restaurants across the country and abroad. I have made some of her recipes before and really enjoyed them. The burata was amazing and the the orzo meatballs were exactly how they were described by the bartender. The grilled artichokes had just the right amount of aioli to compliment them and I was quite excited to have her signature dish which is the Spaghetti with Lemon Basil and Shrimp. Once the dish was brought out (about 30 minutes) I was quite disappointed with the size. The presentation and aroma were spot-on but the portion (which the bartender said was a dinner size and not really a secondi) was tiny which is the opposite of the price ($34 for pasta that fits in the palm of your hand?). The disappointment did not end there. I found the pasta to be very sticky and doughy although the taste was phenomenal. The single shrimp was cooked perfectly and the lemon and basil were the perfect balance. But overall as my main dish I was not happy with the pasta. The overall experience would have been below average for me if it had not been for the dessert. I was talked into the special chocolate torta which was amazing. It paired perfectly with the glass of recommended wine and kept me from reviewing the restaurant poorly. Overall I did not think Giada was a value (I know its vegas) but it was a wednesday night and I think maybe the \"B\" team was on in the kitchen. I still would recommend giving it a try but do not go with the \"signature\" pasta. The meat and cheese plate looked robust and diverse. The rack of lamb that the gentlemen next to me at the bar said was the best lamb he ever had for what that is worth. \n\nTry it out!"

My hubby got his fav muffuletta w/ arugula salad on the side. He still prefers the thicker sourdough muffuletta version vs. the flatter sandwich less meat.

As soon as we mentioned we were there to celebrate our friends' wedding the day before, the staff offered to take pictures of us with our cocktails, stayed to chat a bit, and we truly felt at home.\n\nAfter much deliberation and with Cliff's guidance, we chose the tasting menu for the table (which comes with souvenir menus and recipes) and the charcuterie antipasti platter. We came as close as we could to licking the plates without losing our dignity! The girls had the lemon pasta with shrimp and the boys had the vegetable bolognese,  which despite what your traditional ideas of bolognese may be, definitely convinced our carnivorous men.\n\nThe lamb chops won the evening, and I quote: \"best quality cut of lamb I have ever tasted\". I took the veal chop substitution, and while it was good, I have to admit I would not stray from the original suggestions if given a second chance. The lamb and filet were both better in my opinion. Luckily the bride was gracious enough to give me one of her lamb chops!\n\nDessert did not disappoint (polenta cake with tomato strawberry jam! Mascarpone cheesecake! And those lemon cookies omg) and we got a few extra things to take back to the hotel room fridge when we told Cliff our favorites.\n\nTL;DR: Giada will not disappoint and I would 100% recommend for any special occasion you may be celebrating in Vegas.

Go find them instead of having dinner here.\n\nThe food itself is good, I'd give it four stars.\n\nThe wines are typical of Vegas, jacked up five times what you'd pay for them at the winery.\n\nThe service overall here is a below average for a restaurant with those prices. The staff is trying but they need far more polish if they're going to be serving $55+ entrees.\n\nThe management at this restaurant is non-existent and that's the real problem.\n\nI've eaten at thousands of restaurants all over the world and I don't say this lightly...whomever is the manager for the dinner shift on weeknights at Giada should be fired.\n\nWe had a party of 7 with an 8:30pm reservation on a Wednesday night in February. That shouldn't be hard to service, right? WRONG.\n\nWe arrived at the hostess station exactly on time. The hostess told us our table \"wasn't quite ready\" and we could go to the bar and they'd come to get us when it was ready.\n\nAfter sitting in the bar area for fifteen minutes, no one even asked us if we wanted a drink. Normally at restaurants I go to, if you're sitting at the bar this long past the time of your reservation, the manager will come over, apologize profusely and comp your drinks: Not at Giada. At Giada they simply ignore you.\n\nFinally after fifteen minutes of no one saying a word to us, one of the women in our party flags down a cocktail waitress and we order drinks. A hostess then comes by to tell us yet again that our table \"isn't quite ready\".\n\nAnother fifteen minutes go by and we get our drinks finally. It's now THIRTY minutes past our reservation time and we're still NOT seated. No apologies from anyone, nothing. Instead a hostess comes by a third time to tell us our table is \"almost ready\".\n\nFORTY THREE MINUTES after our reservation time, a hostess comes to tell us our table is ready. During this forty three minutes we were not visited at all by anyone in charge of the restaurant. No ma\u00eetre d' or manager of this restaurant has stopped by to apologize for such a RIDICULOUS wait or possibly comp the drink we had while waiting!!! Nothing! No one! Who runs that restaurant? Giada herself should be ashamed to put her name on a restaurant with such atrocious service! We pay our bar bill, which for some reason can't be transferred to our table, and finally go to be seated.\n\nAs we sit down, one of the women in our party slips on the slippery wood floor and her white wine flies in the air, spilling all over her dress. Only one waiter comes to her aid. Two other restaurant patrons help her more than the staff did.\n\nAs we're finally seated, another woman in our party tells the waiter about our 45 minute wait past our reservation. He had no idea we'd been waiting that long. He said he was sorry but he didn't get the manager to come over either. I've never in my life had to wait 45 minutes past my reservation to get seated. And I've never been ignored by restaurant management before. If I were Giada, I'd be furious at that manager and demand \n\nThe waiter gave us some sort of elderberry concoction by way of apology for our wait, but the complete unprofessionalism of the place just threw the whole meal off for all of us.\n\nUnless they get real professional management for this restaurant, avoid it."

For more than 14 people, you are supposed to go through group sales, a pre fixe menu, and make a CC payment. Lucky for me, Amber, of group sales, spoke with the manager who allowed us to change the reservation to 15 without going through that entire hassle! \n\n2 of my guests last minute canceled and we actually ended up with 13 people with our last 2 guests arriving late. We were seated quickly without them being present and weren't given any problems for them showing up late.  We were seated in a semi-private area perfect for our group and since it was early in the evening (5pm reservation), the two tables next to us weren't occupied until immediately before we left.\n\nOur group of servers were amazing! Our glasses were always full, we didn't feel rushed, and we weren't waiting/ having to look for someone if we needed something. They really took care of us. Service was some of the best I've had. \n\nI tried some appetizers that we shared family style, the scallop and crab risotto, bone-in rib eye, wagyu beef, spaghetti, another pasta I can't remember it's name, lamb, and veal. The risotto with its crab chunks was delicious, rib eye was seasoned well, wagyu beef and lamb was deliciously tender, and you can't go wrong with any of the pastas. The veal was breaded and didn't seem to complement the rest of the menu. Hence, the loss of one star. \n\nDessert was delicious (chocolate tart for the win!) and my brother was given complimentary cookies as we were celebrating his send-off to Navy boot camp. It was very nice of them and a great end to a delicious meal.\n\nOverall, a great experience and I would definitely return."

Food was incredible, the view is one of the best in Vegas, and the details in this restaurant are not lost on a diner. We had an excellent time. Get Giada's favorites for an antipasti and the cookie assortment for dessert. Lemon spaghetti and the bone in ribeye were phenomenal too!"

This was truly a special evening with no expense spared.  \n\nThat being said, the staff and kitchen at Giada's did not disappoint.  The only regret I have is not being physically able to try every single item brought to our massive table.  I did give it an honest effort but, unfortunately I ran out of room.  Dessert was insane! The roaming dessert cart just kept unloading selection after selection at our table....it was hilarious.  \n\nFood was excellent.  Staff was very attentive.  Recommend fully!\n\nGood luck getting a reservation :)"

I was so excited to try out her restaurant, but unfortunately, I wasn't blown away by her restaurant at the Cromwell, neither by food or decor. It does have awesome views though.\n\nWe started out with the assortment of bread, and two HUGE veggie, meat and cheese platters. I enjoyed the roasted mushrooms, sweet peppers and the bacon wrapped dates. It was a lot of food, very salty too. The breads are yummy! Was truly full by the time we were done with it and a lot was left untouched.\nFor the main I got the Shrimp Spaghetti - the shrimp was overcooked, pasta was okay and warm-ish -  let's just say disappointed... or maybe it's the full belly talkin, but either way overcooked tough shrimp on a signature dish is not cool. After that we indulged in 4 different desserts with coffee (souffle (it takes 15-20 minutes btw), chocolate torte, chocolate tiramisu and lemon hazelnut torte) The lemon dessert was good - nice and tart.\n\nAnd boo, the photobooth was broken. Service was good, our waiter with a thick Italian accent was charming, answered all our questions, paced the dishes out nicely and checked in on us often. But considering everything else I probably won't be back."

            "review": "10 Steps to a Nice Date on the Strip...\n\nStep #1:  Make a reservation to Giada De Laurentiis' new restaurant, GIADA.  GIADA is new and reservations are a must.  My suggestion, request a table with a view. \n\nStep #2:  Review the menu online.  You can also read the good, okay and bad reviews on Yelp.  GIADA's menu includes Italian dishes, with Giada's personal touches to them.  Menu consists of antipastas, soups, salads, pastas like Spah-geh-tee, ree-gah-TOH-neh, ree-ZOHT-oh, & Rah-VEEOH-lee, and main dishes like rib-eyes, salmon, chicken, rack of lamb, veal, and steak.  And let's not forget the sides...asparagus, potatoes, sweet corn, etc.\n\nStep #3:  Arrive for your reservation.  GIADA is located in the Cromwell and their entrance is on Flamingo just east of Las Vegas Blvd.  I suggest valet at the Cromwell.  For those of you that wish to take a stroll through the Linq or walk off dinner, then park at the Linq.\n\nStep #4:  Check in and wait in their lobby's comfortable seating.  The lobby also sports a photo booth where you can take instant pictures.  These pictures can be printed on the spot (we didn't print our since the printer was busted), uploaded on Twitter, and/or uploaded to The Facebook.\n\nStep #5:  Your hostess will take you to your table.  You server will arrive shortly for your drink order and of course, drop off some carbs (i.e. breads and spreads) and some of their $8 water.   You smell that?  Yup, it's fresh Las Vegas Strip air.  The restaurant has retractable windows (opened when we dined) and a good view of the strip.\n\nStep #6:  Check out the menu one last time and make your decision.  For me, it was the Orzo Meatballs and Risotto (crab & scallops).  My beautiful date had the Spaghetti and Lobster Arancini.  \n\nStep #7:  Enjoy the view.  That means phones down, no Yelping, no texting, and no Facebook.  My gf had a pretty good view of Caesar's and the Bellagio Fountains.  My view was the gf.  My thoughts....I had the best view. \n\nStep #8:  Food arrives and it's time to eat.  Okay, bring the phones back out for some pictures if you do that kinda thing.  To be frank, our food pictures are really unnecessary since almost every food photo is already posted on Yelp.  Just remember, there's only one original fork pic.  As for our meal, I loved mine and my gf's.  Yes, we tend to sample each other's dishes because that's what Yelpers do.  Everything tasted good, presentation was as good as it gets, and the portions were just right (enough that kept your satisfied, not too much that your belly couldn't afford dessert). \n\nStep #9:  Decide or have one of their Italian doughnuts, cookies, Tiramisu, gelato, or sorbets for dessert. We passed since we already had dessert lined up elsewhere\n\nStep #10:  Repeat.  I look forward to trying their lunch next time. \n\nPS:  I have to mention the overall service at Giada.  5 Stars for the service here.  Our hostess and servers were great.  The Manager made multiple stops at our table to check on us and on the way out, he went out of his way to thank us for dining here.  Kudos, Giada!  So far, I'm a fan."

Since the decision to have lunch at Giada's was completely spontaneous we did not make reservations. On arrival, although the restaurant was half empty, the Hostess refused to seat us at a table, allowing bar seating only! The hostess made it very clear that without the \"requisite\" reservation only bar seating was allowed. This makes no sense when a restaurant is only half full and it is obvious there are not enough reservations to fill the space! The food was delicious but the pretentiousness left a bad taste."

            "review": "After several visits with clients, the wife and my escape from yet another bachelor party (see my \"Gold Coast Hotel\" review), below are some quibbles, pointers and comments:\n\n--The delightful risotto with the crab and scallops in the cream sauce needed more than two scallops.\n--I wanted the chicken marsala meatballs to taste better: They had that Costco chicken patty flavor. More marsala sauce and mushrooms to the mix? Add some ground veal maybe?\n--The Caesar vinaigrette was a nice change from the \"gorpy\" generic Caesar dressing found at other restaurants. Unfortunately the croutons were stale more than once.\n--Noisy, noisy, noisy...every time. No intimate dinner with the wife here. On another visit, the last thing the four of us wanted after 10 hours wandering around the stuffy halls of the LVCC was trying to talk over a loud music mix.\n--Smoky, smoky, smoky. Not from the people around you (common in Las Vegas), but the wood smoke from the kitchen. You come out smoky-smelling, like what you'd get from a 4-day camping trip.\n--On one visit, I faced the sun setting. Not pleasant when there are no screens or curtains, so watch out where you sit.\n--The waiters need to bring the bread before the drinks. This happened every time, with one time bread being brought after the salads. Arrgh. The flat bread, the bread sticks and especially the focaccia baked in a clay pot, were excellent.\n--If you are willing to pay fifty bucks for the veal dish, you've probably been to Italy (even if it was just once after high school), and know how to pronounce the names of the pasta items.\n\nThe place has been open for just over a year, and I'd expected a smoother operation by now. Worth another try/chance."

The place is real nicely designed so props for not screwing up one of the best views on the strip. \nWe had a party of 7 for my engagement celebration, checked in and got the grand tour before we were seated. \nDecided it would be best to order a little bit of everything, from the chicken meatballs to prosciutto and something else that wasn't worth remembering. Chicken meatballs were pretty dry and flavorless. However the mushrooms they were stacked were pretty tasty. \nThe items on the drink menu were pretty good.\nFor the main course I had the rack of lamb and my fianc\u00e9 went with the filet. Rack of lamb was dryer than the chicken meatballs were which tells me that they had no clue how to cook or prepare lamb. Now the sad part was that my girls filet was super dry, over cooked and basically not a good cut.\nOur friends went with with porterhouse which was decent, some others got the lemon spaghetti and another pasta dish. \nEnded the dinner  with the strawberry shortcake type dessert that was bleh, cookies were pretty good with the espresso. \nNow despite the crappy food the place is real nice and I don't really mind that it sucked because we can't judge til we try it right? Being Vegas I would probably not go back because honestly Italian food is pretty bland in my opinion and there's always new places to try in Vegas. \nThe only real bad part of the experience was that they ended up charging me and extra $260. After I called the next day and spoke to the general manager he informed me that they were having problems and that his financial dept will take care of it. Said I will have a call back the next day and that if I don't hear back to give them a call. I've followed up and still can't get this issue cleared up which is a little annoying. \nHopefully this review will motivate them to take a closer look at their dishes and also fix the error on my check! :)"

So this review may be pretty useless to everyone, but I am writing it anyways because we had a fabulous time at Giada!!\n\nWe were very lucky to have lunch at Giada.  It is highly recommended that you make reservations months ahead of time.  We had no reservations.  My wife called and lo and behold, there was a cancellation.  She said that if we arrived there within 30 minutes, they would have a table for us.  The folks at Giada were true to their word.  We only waited about 10 minutes before being seated.  While we waited, we had fun taking selfies inside their photo booth.\n\nThe ambiance of Giada is exquisite and charming.  The view of the Las Vegas Strip from our table was lovely.  The table settings were beautiful and unique.  5 stars for the atmosphere!\n\nService was excellent.  From the hostesses to the busboy to our waitress, the customer service was polite, efficient, and professional.  5 stars!!\n\nNow to the most important part.  The food was 4 to 5 stars delicious!!  All of the dishes were served tapas style so portions were smaller.  Note that some of the items we had may no longer be offered on their current menu. Here is a quick rundown of what we had:\n\nBirdie was a refreshing drink with strawberry and basil.\nDolce Vita was another very refreshing drink.  \nMuffuletta Sandwich is one tasty sandwich. The combination of the porchetta, provolone, and other ingredients was so flavorful!\nG's Baked Pasta was delish! \nPancetta Egg Pizza was different and yummy!\nOrzo Meatballs were really good!\nChocolate Tiramisu looked beautiful and tasted wonderful too.\nCookie Platter had 3 different types of cookies.  All were quite good.\nZeppoles are citrus infused italian doughnuts. Hmm...Hmm...good!!!\n\nBased on our very good experience here, Giada rates 5 stars from me!!  Thanks for a wonderful and memorable time!"

We tried it several times and were pretty disappointed that it was broken. The decor of the place is amazing. We get seated and everyone there is so friendly. I love that about a restaurant. Our waitress was extremely helpful and she was always there when we needed. \nWhen waiting for our dinner, you get complimentary bread. The Rosemary bread was delicious and warm. The perfect bite for me would contain a decent amount of butter, a spread of pesto, capers, and salt and pepper. Haha I honestly enjoyed the complimentary bread a little better than dinner. \nHere's what we ordered;\n\nRisotto with crab and scallops. 3.5/5. Scallops are my favorite. It's sad when you order it at a restaurant and it doesn't live up to what you think it's going to be. The dish was lacking salt and pepper. Any seasoning really. I mean it was good. But it definitely needed a little help. I wouldn't spent that much and order that again.\n\nThree cheese tortellini with braised beef and Genovese sauce. 3/5. This dish was super salty. Super super salty. \n\nWhole roasted chicken cacciatore style. 3.5/5. Some of the chicken was really dry.. And also hard to chew. I almost spit some out. The tomato sauce was served with very delicious though. The fresh tomatoes inside of it helped me to not notice how dry my chicken was.\n\nDessert; Chocolate Tiramisu cake. 4/5. Pretty good! It was very chocolatey though we couldn't finish it. \n\nWe also got cookies on the house served on a plate that said happy anniversary. It was so cute! I didn't really care for the cookies at all though. We also got served some espresso from Caitlyn at the espresso bar. She's the best! \n\nI would come back again to see how my new experience would be. If it weren't for the great service I had, I would give the food 3/5. But overall 4/5 :)"

You leave so full, it's worth it.\n\nWe started off with pastries and a shareable Antipasti platter of fresh Parmesan cheese with Prosciutto accompanied with fresh honeycomb and mini egg fritatta.\nThe Antipasti was good by itself, but when you mix all the flavors together, the cheese on top of the fritatta, a slice of the prosciutto and drizzle the fresh honey from the honey comb?....your mouth will be singing a delicious tune.\n\nFor the main, I got the Salmon Cake Benedict  and my husband ordered the Italian Chicken and Waffles with Cacciatore Sauce.  There is no mistaken that you were eating salmon cakes.  The bread is served on the side of the yummy cakes and the poached egg on top of the salmon was on point.  You crack open that yolk and watch it ooze through the cake.  WOW!!  Let me say that backwards...WOW!!\n\nThe cacciatore sauce served with the chicken and waffes was soooo good.  Very tomato-y and fresh tasting that left a clean taste on my palette.  If you asked me what Italian tastes like, I would say Giada's Cacciatore sauce.  That's what Italian tastes like.  \n\nLast, but not least, the Leaning Tower of Chocolate & Espresso was decadent and the Limoncello Souffle with Buttermilk Gelato was so luscious and melted in your mouth.\n\nMake this place your next brunch stop when visiting Vegas."

Her menu and the setup of her restaurant reflects her consideration for her guests.  And isn't that what it's about? Treating your customers to something good, right? It's a beautiful restaurant and the food is pretty too.  \n\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers including proscuitto and the tricolor salad which were both very yummy.  We had also ordered a pizzette but it never came.  Apparently the kitchen lost our ticket, but we were getting too full to eat a pizza, so we didn't want it anyway.  The server handled it very well, apologizing to us for the mix-up, and was gracious enough to comp our dessert.\n\nI ordered her signature cocktail, and I wasn't too into that either.  I'm not a drinker, so I'm not the person to ask for drink recommendations, but to me it was too strong and it reminded me of some type of cleaning fluid.  But doesn't all alcohol...?\n\nI wasn't super impressed with the lobster ravioli or the rack of lamb.  There was no cheese in the ravioli! I'm not big on cheese either, but I think my husband assessed it fairly well when he said \"It's like... a Chinese dumpling.  There's meat and juices wrapped in dough, but it's missing the part that makes it Italian.\"  As for the lamb, it was okay, but I think it could be less chewy.\n\nFor dessert, we had the little cheesecake with a blood orange sliver on top and the lemon cookie, chocolate chip cookie, and the chocolate brownie cookie.  The desserts were yummy indeed.  The man presenting the desserts, however, was a bit too honest when we asked him for his recommendation.  Here's how it went:\n\nUs: Which one do you like?\nMan: Honestly? Nothing. After 8 months working here, nothing is good to me.\n\nOOOOOOOK.\n\nThat guy should not be working there.  Although it was 11pm by the time we were ready for dessert, I wasn't expecting any of the staff to blatantly dissuade us from ordering anything.  But eh.

We arrived right on time and were promptly seated in a table by the window. It was a little sunny but manageable. But then we waited a good ten minutes before anyone came over to greet us or give us water so that was a bummer of a way to start.\n\nBut we shrugged it off and moved on to ordering. We started the meal with an order of burrata cheese. It might be my favorite thing we ate there. It was super fresh, really creamy and went very well with the pizza dough bread basket. In addition we had an order of chicken marsala meatballs - also very tasty but a touch on the dry side.\n\nFor our main meal we ordered a muffaletta sandwich and a carbonara pizza. The sandwich was loaded with different kinds of meat and it was served with shoestring zucchini, which was kind of like French fries. I really enjoyed the zucchini and the sandwich was tasty as well. While we were enjoying our sandwich we expected the pizza to come out but it never did! I asked our waiter about it and told him we didn't want it anymore. He just said he'd check on it and then came back with the pizza. Which I guess was good but we did say we didn't actually want it anymore so I felt like he didn't listen. They did take it off the bill however, so that was nice.\n\nI was also a little surprised that even though they knew it was my birthday (it was noted with the reservation and the hostess wished me a happy birthday) that we didn't get anything special like a little dessert. I guess they don't do that like some other places. \n\nOverall I'd say the food was pretty good and I loved the ambiance but the service was mixed."

The vegetable Bolognese rigatoni, was a stand out. Whatever you do, do not let the dessert cart pass you by, even if you are stuffed. Grab some of those Lemon Ricotta cookies and enjoy the sweet, tart bliss. We saw Giada walking through the restaurant as we were leaving. She is mighty teeny and very adorable."

Told her that and she said. \"Ok. One minute.\" As we waited at the host stand, ignored for 10 minutes I finally said \"um. Did you want us to stand here? Are we going to be seated?\" She looked at us and said \"we are looking for a table.\"  Perhaps she should have told us that so we didn't stand there in the midst of all the people walking up and the hoards of cheap gift bags littering the floor? They had some promo event later in the day and had a bunch of bags all over the place. Looked cheap. \n\nSEATING\nAfter about 15 minutes of waiting, lots of open tables and we get seated so far away from the windows and views it's was kind of not worth waiting or the reservation. \n\nORDER\nAt brunch, they were out of Bloody Marys? Huh? \n\nFOOD \nMeh. Nothing special. Expensive for what it is. I mean Giada has her name everywhere (placemats, bar carts, etc) you would think there was more to it."

On a Saturday night, the earliest reservation we could get was 8:15pm but since it was Vegas, we didn't mind having a late dinner. We arrived 30 minutes early so we found a couch to sit on and sip on drinks before we were seated at our table. The drinks in the lounge area were decently priced $9-$12/drink and you ordered off an iPad which was kind of cool. Our server in the lounge also had a great personality! \n\nWe were seated about 5 minutes after 8pm and unfortunately were seated all the way in the back with absolutely no view. I suppose that would be my biggest complaint- the seating wasn't very comfortable at all. Our server was friendly and service was very quick which I appreciated. The bread basket was awesome with a small roll that had been baked in a mini cast iron pot (super cute!) and there were breadsticks and parmesan crisps which were awesome! Loved the sea salt and rosemary flavors. \n\nFor our appetizer we shared the Tenderloin Crostini which had a small slice of pickle and a potato chip on top- very cute but was just okay, it didn't surprise me at all. I had the Parpadelle with pork ragout and it was AMAZING!!!! I loved that the pasta was topped with arugula so there were some veggies incorporated. The pork was sooo tender. My boyfriend had the Three Cheese Tortellini that had Beef inside as well and though it was fairly heavy, he said it was really flavorful. We also shared the Spinach and Herb Soft Polenta with Spicy Italian Sausage as sides. Both were really great except the polenta didn't have much sausage in it. The most impressive item of our meal was the dessert- which was a Hazelnut Caramel Lemon Cake. It was an unusual pairing but it totally worked! \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the meal but it was pretty pricey. I'm definitely glad we tried it but maybe will try something different next time around!"

One of the best I've ever had outside of New Orleans.  Chocolate tiramisu was so good, as were the 3 types of cookies.  Our waiter was very funny, sweet, down to earth.  I think from France.

From the decor, to the service, to the food, to the view, it was all so wonderful. We went straight for entrees this outing and gave the grilled cheese and arugula salad a try! Boy am I glad we did. The salad was so fresh, the vinaigrette dressing was just right and the chicken was to die for! It reminded me of the chicken schnitzel off of the streets of Israel! My hubby got the grilled cheese and \"shoestring fries.\" Toasted to perfection featuring succulent cheese and pesto sauce...need I say more?! The fries were crispy and lightly flavored with vinegar and salt. One word: DELECTABLE. Even though we skipped the appetizers, we sure did indulge in dessert! If you're a Nutella lover, go for the donuts. They come out warm, drizzled with powdered sugar and a side of Nutella. Aside from the stellar food, the service was fast and the server was very knowledgable about the food items. My hubby drinks a ton of water and not once was his glass left empty. Love a conscientious serving team. Do yourself a favor and book a reservation at one of Las Vegas' finest establishments, Giada, the next time you're in town. You won't be disappointed!"

Great job with the decor and overall ambiance! Our reservation was for 9:30am, but we arrived 30 minutes early ,and we were warmly greeted and seated right away. We were seated on a great table with view to the strip and all the restaurant.Our server Christopher was great, he answered some questions and explained some special items that were available for Valentine's weekend. We ordered the American breakfast that came with smashed potatoes and some sausage meatballs in marinara. Both my kids ordered the polenta waffles with pineapple and strawberries accompanied by Nutella and maple syrup. My picky daughter ate the whole thing , don't know where she put so much food ,but she was very happy with her waffles. I ordered the savory waffle with eggs and pancetta served with maple and bechamel. This was a really good waffle, I was surprised that it remained crispy even though I'm a slow eater , excellent! Same with the kids waffles, crispy and chewy. If that wasn't enough food we ordered the pastry assortment to share: savory muffin, orange sticky bun, croissant , hazelnut cake and my favorite the Rosemary strawberry scone, soooo good! The pastry assortment came with some raspberry preserves, mascarpone and almond butter, the tiny plate where  the mascarpone was served was chipped , an overlook I'm sure, I bet Giada would just throw the plate away, right?\nThey also have some bar seating , where you can look at the nice pizza oven and a deli display with all their antipasto and pastry options, everything looked fresh and delicious! \nAt the end of our breakfast we had some fun with the kids taking pics in their photo booth, unfortunately their internet connection was done and we couldn't email or post directly to FB but we were able to print out our pics.\nOverall, I say if you are a fan of Giada , visiting the restaurant should be on your to do list when visiting Vegas. The prices are not cheap , they're comparable to other celebrity chef's restaurants on the strip so this was no surprise!"

Her days are not filled as much as her nights so she joined me at Bally's for the auction and we decided to go off and get some lunch.   It had to be close (didn't want to miss too much of the auction action) and it had to be fun.  Giada's fit the bill perfectly.\n\nWe were both very impressed as we walked into the place, it was absolutely beautiful.  The hostess seated us at their best window table overlooking the strip and Caesar's Palace.   As I was treating I was thrilled to see that the prices were more than reasonable for lunch.   You can actually have lunch in this amazing place for under $20 per person.  Of course we didn't but still it was much less than I would have expected.   \n\nI had a Bloody Mary and my friend had a Prosecco to start us off and for our lunches she had the Sardinian Gnocchi al Pomodoro ($16) which the waiter explained to us is not your traditional Gnocchi but one that is more of a pasta than a potato flavor...he was right and it was still delicious.   I decided to enjoy a pizza, the Salumi Piccante spicy dry sausage, san marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella, oregano (also $16).  Delicious and generous... a table of four could share one as a hearty appetizer. \n\nOur server was exceptional, nice and very helpful in steering us to other places that we should try during our respective Las Vegas vacations!   My friend thought the hostesses' dresses were adorable."

I was hoping for a great meal, but this place is one of the most disappointing ones I've had on the strip.\n\nWe weren't very hungry, so we kept the food small. We both had a different cocktail, both of which were tasty and strong. Standard Vegas-priced for $15 each. \n\nArtichoke soup for $12. The soup was lukewarm and had a mealy- not creamy- consistency to it. Neither of us finished the soup. I felt disappointed.\n\nI got the Tricolore salad ($17), which I didn't finish. Sounded delicious with pancetta, dates, kale, and a mess of other things... it just didn't taste good at all. I can't even put a finger on why it was not good, but this fatty did not finish this meal.\n\nMy friend got the spaghetti with prawns ($32, I think). That actually looked tasty, and I think other reviewers recommended it as well. \n\nAtmosphere is quite nice here with subtle lighting, and the restaurant is broken up into a cocktail lounge area, bar, and actual dining area. For some reason they had the windows open when it was 60 degrees outside at night, so it was incredibly cold in there.\n\nI'm sad to say this place is just overpriced and overrated hype."

They asked if it was a special occasion and stated it was my nieces bday. \nFirst things first the self parking is limited it is shared with the adjacent hotel n a timeshare. So you have no option but to valet. This was at 5pm. We then get to the restaurant and we still had to wait for 15 min for our table and when the hostess sat us we stood their like idiots bc they were still prepping the table. Epic fail!! \nWhen we finally sat our waitress was unprepared.. Trying to give us a menu that was empty so she had to go get another one.. 5min later she comes back takes drink order. She looked disheveled n had no personality. \nFood was mediocre for it being a fancy restaurant. I ordered the crab n scallop risotto which had bits of crab shells in it. I told the waitress and her response: oh that happens sometimes n walked away. The scallops were very salty as well. The appetizers were good we had the octopus, calamari n shrimp and some cheese thing which I can't remember the name of. There was nothing special on the dessert menu which I was so surprised about bc Giada makes awesome desserts on her show. \nSo the occasion was my nieces bday that was acknowledged by 3 people at this restaurant and did nothing special not even a piece of chocolate?? Why acknowledge the occasion if they plan not to do anything I thought that was really weird.\nThe one memorable thing was the photo booth in the front entrance. \nIn conclusion: reservation service fail, food mediocre and service fail;("

            "review": "I know it is hip to talk smack on Food Network restaurants, but Giada delivers.  Not like a large pizza to your door \"delivers\" but some of the best food and cocktails on the strip \"delivers.\" \n\nFirst, the women working at the place are pretty hot.  And the men working at the place are knowledgeable.  I know that sounds sexist.  Actually...rereading that sentence I can honestly say that it is sexist.  However, it is the truth.\n\nSecond, the space and view are amazing.  I cannot believe that the Cromwell used to be Bill's Gambling Hall.  That place would give you hepatitis just by walking in the door.  And now, the Cromwell is a shining beacon of no hepatitis....unknowingly at least.  If you bring a call girl up to your room then you are gambling with your clinic tests.  The view from the restaurant is great no matter where you are.  You can see the strip and the fountains.  Very nice view that is rivaled only by the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  Seeing as how the Eiffel Tower Restaurant is seemingly within the nether regions of the fountains, it will be hard to beat.\n\nThird, the cocktails are great.  Our waiter talked about the cocktails for a very long time.  He has tried them all.  At first I thought \"wow...very knowledgeable.\"  Then I thought, \"wow...what a degenerate...with some knowledge.\"  Knowledge in any form is valuable.  Oh yeah...get the Barbarella.\n\nFourth, the food is some of the best.  I tried the Lobster Ravioli, the pizza, the charred octopus, the calamari, and the braised short ribs.  The ravioli were cooked great and were actually quite filling.  The pizza was small (warning to people who are starving), but it was very good.  The waiter did tell me the pizza was small, but I was on my fourth Barbarella and either didn't hear or didn't care.  The octopus was the highlight of the dinner.  It is difficult to cook octopus correctly.  You either serve it nearly raw, and risk getting your mouth sucked to death by the suckers....or you serve it so tough that it can be used as a bungee for some craziness at Stratosphere.  However, this octopus was fully cooked and super tender.  I never tasted octopus so well prepared.  The calamari was great.  Fried well and not greasy.  It was a negative that all of the people at the table loved calamari, which meant that I got about one bite.  I hate my dinner guests.  The braised short ribs were a peculiar thing to try at an Italian restaurant.  I am from Texas.  We know beef and how to prepare it.  What I tasted at Giada was something that any Texas BBQ joint would be proud of.  It did not taste like BBQ, but was tender like it had been smoking for days.  Imagine how tender Keith Richards would be...he has been smoking for decades.\n\nFifth, the dessert was possibly the best thing we had.  We ordered the chocolate tart.  This thing was amazing.  Not too sweet...not not too sweet (I just coined that phrase)....just right.  We shared it since we were stuffed from all of the other stuff.  Stuffed from the other stuff is another phrase I just coined.  I make a vow before we eat that we will try an app, an entree, a cocktail, and a dessert.  We did well with the dessert.  Our waiter suggested it and says that he tried all of the desserts.  He tried all of the cocktails and the desserts.  He was the living embodiment of Bacchus.\n\nThe best restaurant in Cromwell.  That is actually a joke because it is the only restaurant in Cromwell.  However, it is one of the best restaurants on the strip.  You may read other reviews from famous foodies stating the restaurant is not up to par.  Do not listen to these people.  It is trendy to hate on Food Network.  It is trendy to act \"high-brow\" and believe you are above the peasants that worship Food Network celebrity chefs.  But you know what?  These celebrity chefs are known for a reason.  It is not because they make crappy boring food.  No....it is because they pay their dues and have worked tirelessly at their craft.  They are true professionals.  This is why a Giada restaurant, a Bobby Flay restaurant, and even a Guy Fieri restaurant all have good food.  I must admit, I am not a fan of Fieri's, but I will not bash his restaurant because of that....the restaurant is good.  The best out of the bunch is Giada.  Forget the crazy snooty reviews....just listen to a person that knows good food and is not too proud to admit it.  I hope Giada does not get down because of some of the raging snootier reviews and instead continues to listen to the people that actually appreciate fine dining and actually PAY for the food they get.  \n\nAll of the snooty reviewers need to take a jump out of the windows at Giada and get a good view of the Bellagio fountain before they hit Mario, Dora the Explorer, some Minions, Spiderman, a couple of guitar players, and ultimately the concrete on the way down."

The hostess then led us away from the dining room and stopped 15 feet away from where we were sitting (still in the bar) and tried to seat us facing the bar. My husband told the hostess that we had requested a window seat and this would not do. She told us there would be an additional wait and had us sit at the bar.  There were at least 3 open 2 seat tables open at the windows. She came back and led us to the main dining area and sat us right next to the waiter station. My husband had a strip view but I watched the wait staff the entire evening. My husbands orzo meatballs weren't anything special and my \"baby peppers\" (all 4 of them) were mush. Nothing like the description. My husband ordered the cheese tortellini. There were 7 small tortellinis but the sauce was good. My risotto smelled VERY fishy and the 2 quarter sized scallops and tiny portion were NOT worth $32.  My complaint about the portion sizes are because this is touted as an Italian \"home style\" restaurant. I expected more. If I want small portions, I will go to Twist, Joel Robuchon's or Picasso. We own a vacation home in Vegas, travel there often and enjoy our time by eating in the many restaurants.  We will NOT be returning here. We didn't order coffee or desert as we normally would. We wanted to get out as quickly as possible. Not one person acknowledged my husbands birthday (as stated on the reservation) nor did they acknowledge us as we left.  Attitude by a twenty something year old who has all the power to seat people wherever they please is disrespectful to the client paying their paycheck.  And one last thing, I know it's Vegas but I would tell Giada she has way more class than to follow the trend and let all the hostesses and waitresses wear dresses that are so short, they are constantly pulling it down because it rides up."

Let me start by saying I don't mind paying good money as long as the food is good, which wasn't the case in my experience. I think there should be less focus on \"oh this is giadas favorite cocktail\" and more focus on the food quality. I ordered the chicken Marsala meatballs and they were mediocre, I also ordered the romaine salad which was pretty tasty, what I really regret ordering is the risotto with scallops and crab meat. It tasted and smelled so fishy that I felt nauseous. I will say the scenery is nice inside the restaurant but that's about it. I really wanted to give this place a good review, I really did but it really is what most people said about it... mediocre food for HIGH celebrity prices."

Food - spaghetti with shrimp - pasta fresh and delicious , shrimp blah, portion size - small especially for pricing. Chicken Marsala meatballs- good. Caprese - so tastesless. The service - TERRIBLE! No explanation or details given to tasting menu or regular menu. I honestly thought the tasting menu was a bizarre souvenir - it contained three recipe cards, an autographed picture of Giada and a specific 4 course meal with no pricing.  Everything took forever...even water . Dishes with butter and olive oil for bread were chipped and broken. We finally asked for a different server. He made a very good effort to finish the meal but I would never go back!"

There was a group of us that went, the waiter was very short with us and rushing us. He felt irritated by questions that were being asked. The others servers or people that were helping him were very helpful and nice but he was rude and had no patience. We loved the food so much we still wanted to come back another time to give it a second chance. I made reservation's for my sisters birthday on December 16, 2016. Right away the people bringing drinks and our bread were very nice and friendly our waiter not so much. He was to busy flirting with  the other woman he worked with than helping us. We placed our order and so excited about our food. Someone else brings it out and I personally was missing 2 items I ordered. The waiter came back so late that we were already done eating and I was over it by then. I waited to get the bill to see if I would get charged for the items I ordered as to bring to his attention that I never received them. We got the bill and the items were not on there. Someone brought my sister a nice Happy Birthday plate with cookies. I Wanted her to have a good night and not frustrate it with my complaining.  If the waiter had spent more time helping our table than flirting with other people  we would have spent more money and time and would probably be going back. 2 for 2 with bad waiters does not sit well with me. I have to say the food is excellent though."

The photo booth was really fun but when we tried to use it again the guest before us moved the camera and the photos were blurry and bright.

To reserve a table by the window was a $100 per person minimum requirement. The waitstaff takes a pre authorization credit card form before arriving. Ok whatever, I figured with dinner and wine we would cover that no problem. Arrive at the table and find dirty silver ware, which occurred multiple times throughout the evening. The tables are so crammed I couldn't sit without pushing and hitting the person's chair behind me. But hey I got my window seat.  Ordered two appetizers, duck prosciutto and burrata cheese. The duck was great. The cheese took 26 minutes. I asked if they made it fresh and the waiter said no it's pre made they just need to plate it. We had the tortellini  and risotto. Both were good but not amazing, which we were hoping. The portions were small which didn't bother us at all. We ordered the limoncello souffl\u00e9 and it tasted like scrambled eggs!  Now I know what a souffl\u00e9 should taste like, I order chocolate souffl\u00e9s all the time and I'm pretty sure it's never tasted like breakfast.  Now I never go out looking for a free meal and this experience was no different. After all this crap the manager comp'ed the dessert. Thanks for nothing Giadas!  I can't my time or my money back!\n\nBottom line, the Las Vegas strip wins again, a complete let down for a local but if you are here on vacation and have cash to blow and don't care about dirty silverware and are completely smashed before arriving then enjoy!"

I really wasn't expecting much from the food. I checked out the menu in advance and none of the dishes impressed me. That is, until I tasted the food. \n\nLet me first say that I was extremely surprised that my group and I were even allowed in the restaurant. We had a reservation for 5 on a busy Friday evening. Due to heavy traffic, we had no time to stop at our hotel to change for dinner and showed up looking like a hot mess: t-shirts, flip flops, basketball shorts, sweaty, etc. I, personally, hadn't even brushed my hair all day. So kudos to the hostesses for not laughing us out of the restaurant when we showed up. I wish I could say that I was also blown away by the wait staff but that is sadly not the case. It took at least 10 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us after we were seated and even longer for us to get some water. If anything at the restaurant needs improvement, it's definitely the table service.\n\nNow, on to the food. We were a hungry bunch and wanted to try everything: orzo meatballs, calamari, tomato & strawberry jam crostini, margherita pizzette, tricolore salad, spaghetti, ravioli, and an assortment of desserts from the cart. The best items of the evening were the meatballs, pizzette, spaghetti and ravioli. The ingredients were simple but delicious. My only complaint (and you'll see this in many other reviews) is the price. Subtract one dollar sign and I would definitely be eating here every time I'm in Vegas."

We arrived early and got drinks at the bar. We sat for 10 minutes before a server came. We noticed right away that it was hot in the restaurant. All of the windows were open and it was loud and uncomfortable. For drinks, I had the Giada and my husband had the Barbarella. The Barbarella was a fancy gin and tonic and the Giada was sweet and creamy...both very delicious. \n\nWe started dinner with the orzo meatballs, crab arancini, and frito misto. The meatballs were delicious. They were salty, tender, and the sauce was cheesy. The arancini was good but my family's recipe is better. The marinara it came with was bland. The coating on the calamari was grainy. Calamari should be fried in a light, flakey batter. It came with lemon aioli which was good but I prefer marinara with my calamari. They were very tender and flavorful, I just didn't like the coating. This dish was served with a delicious fennel and pepper salad. Skip the calamari please and give me more of that salad. \n\nThen we had the romaine and tri colore salads. The romaine is Giada's take on a caesar salad. It was too lemony. The tri colore salad was delicious. It was served with kale, raddichio, proscuitto, and gorganzola. The proscuitto melted in your mouth and was salty and perfect. \n\nFor our entrees, we had lobster ravioli and lemon spaghetti. The lobster ravioli was good. The pasta was tender and they didn't skimp on the lobster. The spaghetti was raw. It stuck together and was chewy. The sauce was creamy and lemony and the shrimp were tender. I enjoyed the fried capers that were sprinkled around the plate. If my pasta was cooked this would have been delicious. \n\nWe wanted dessert but the service was terrible. We were in the restaurant for 2 hours at this point, it was extremely hot, and our water was poured warm without ice. We decided to take Giada's favorite cookies home. These were amazing. The lemon ricotta cookies were light and cakey and the peanut butter and blackberry jam cookies were soft and nutty. We received 2 of each and then 1 large chocolate chip cookie. I do not care for chocolate chip but this cookie was great. We paid $12 for 5 cookies...worth every penny. \n\nI am giving Giada's 3 stars for the drinks and cookies. The food was overpriced and not very good and the restaurant was hot, loud, and the service was poor. Our bill was $207 and the meal just wasn't worth it. My Italian grandmother never liked Giada. Grandma used to say Giada was full of you know what. And Italian Grandmothers are never wrong."

Small sized lunch apps (4 small meatballs) were $14.  Restaurant was less than half filled and they told us it would take 15 minutes to seat a party of two.  We ate at the bar where a bartender with no personality took our order, and spent most of his time trying to ignore the dozen or so customers eating at the bar.  Must say that the prosciutto appetizer was excellent.  The wood fired ovens make the place smell like someone is cooking barbecue at a bonfire.  The smell is abrasive and definitely sticks to your shirt."

He was a gentleman from Italy.  By the end of our dinner we were showing our server photos of our dogs and he was telling us about his.  He was so genuine and is a true asset to Giada.  He presented us with an ipad that had the drink menu.  Off of this we ordered wine which was good.  We ordered two types of cured meat before our entree's.  I had the beef wagyu which was good!  For my entree I had the crab and scallop rissotto.  While the plate overall was small, the scallops had absolutely outstanding flavor.  We had the molton chocolate cake for dessert which is made from scratch and takes 20 minutes to prepare.  I also had a espresso alcoholic dessert drink which was quite delcious.  My bill alone was $90.  The price is a bit high for what you get as the portions are small but the dining experience is one that I definitely won't forget.  The photobooth was so much fun after dinner as well!  A nice souvenir!"

A+ on atmosphere and service, C for the food.\n\nYou'll never forget where you are because Giada puts her name on EVERYTHING. The tasting menu even comes with a full page photo of the famous chef. The photo booth in the waiting area was fun, and is free to use. I don't see anyone stopping you from using it even if you aren't eating at the restaurant.\n\nThe best thing I had were the bacon wrapped dates and the tricolore salad. For all the hype, everything else wasn't really any good. We tried the Chicken for 2 since it was featured in a food magazine, but it was super dry and really nothing special at all. I know Giada doesn't eat a lot of what she cooks, but she probably wouldn't even look at this chicken. \n\nI would also skip the pea pesto crostini and the octopus. You can get much better food at a much cheaper restaurant. \n\nWith all the negatives about the food, you can't deny the perfect location on the strip - right on the corner of the Cromwell, and the great service by the professional waiters. It's super fancy."

I believe you could tell him that he won a million dollars and he would just look at you and say okay. The starter breads were very good, the pizza appetizer was good, my veal chop was very good and my wife's spaghetti was good. One thing that irks me about these high end restaurants is no salt and pepper on the tables. How does the chef know what everyone's palate is like? I don't get it. I don't know if I would come back, there just weren't enough food options that I like. We ate at Gordon Ramsay's the day before and that was awesome and definitely some place I would revisit."

My husband had to go to the bar to get drinks for us since the server was nowhere to be found and never acknowledged our presence.  I had a mojito and there was no visible mint in my drink.  WTH!  Was seated at our table at the time of our reservation. The server told us that we could NOT order an appetizer first, that we must order our entire meal to include wine at one time, end of discussion.  Okay we make our choices and order about 10 minutes later.  Still no bread.  Wait about 15 minutes for appetizers, they are brought.  Then finally some bread is brought out.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and the olives and they were meh!  The warm bread was covered in salt, so much so that my husband the sodium freak said it was too much for him.  I had the shrimp with spaghetti while my spouse had the lamb.  My pasta was clumpy and overcooked as were the two shrimp I received with it.  My husband's lamb was ordered medium rare and was received as  well done.  Both appetizers lacked seasoning and we were not offered any  parmesan for the pasta or salt/pepper for any of our food.  On a side note, the portions are incredibly  small.  My sister lives in Vicenza Italy and I thave traveled there on a frequent basis for the past 30 years, 3-4 times a year and this is not Italian food or service.  The waiter asked how we were enjoying our meal and we told him.  No one from management approached us.  We did not order dessert because the majority of it appeared dried out.  My husband did order coffee for after dinner.  This was a total waste of our time and money."

            "review": "My review of Giada pt 2: After my experience with this restaurant  last night I wanted to give a REAL review hoping that the manager and even Giada herself  would read this... I have been a long time fan of Giada  & was super excited to have the chance to eat at her restaurant.  After finally arriving at the restaurant  last night, I checked in with the greeter and was asked if I wanted to go in early since my wife &  I arrived early. My wife checked that the dress attire for the restaurant  is \"business casual\"  based on their website. I was wearing blue shorts &  a capped sleeved (  very short, short sleeved) Guess hooded sweater.  While waiting to be seated, another woman who didn't  introduce herself came from inside  the restaurant  & told me  that there was a dress code &  I wouldn't  be able to get in unless I changed clothes.  Being that I wasn't staying at the Cromwell, that was not something I could do.  I told this woman that I have been  a long time fan of Giada since her cooking show days and all I wanted to do was eat dinner at Giada 's restaurant for my wife' s bday.  All I wanted was a little customer service and to be pardoned for my capped sleeve shirt. She just turned her head,  gave me a  fake smile  that read \"that's  nice but I really don't give a shit\"  &  proceeded with telling me that I still won't  be able to get in unless I changed clothes.  She said I had \"torn off sleeves\"  and that was the problem. .  but mind you..  my shirt is once again CAPPED Sleeve that  go pass my shoulders and it was a Guess brand.  It was not a $10 ripped tank top from old Navy as she implied. While this is all happening, I notice  3 or 4 guys go inside to eat with blue shorts on and  t-shirts.  So here is my question...  What was the difference  between what I had on and THEIR outfits ????  \n\nI get that there's a dress code and rules like this need to be followed by the people  who conduct this business.  What I  didn't  appreciate was the condescending  approach and how that woman made me feel that this snobby atmosphere  is something that they're  trying to uphold & that me and my capped sleeved shirt don't have a place in there.  (Imagine that \"Pretty Woman\" scene w/Julia Roberts  when she was dressed as a hooker and that snobby lady didn't wanna help her because of how she looked.. All Julia wanted was to buy a nice dress and she had $$$!!) \n\nI thought that as a fan of Giada  (who this woman  probably  didn't  even know  of until she worked at the restaurant) AND as a paying customer that  a few  more inches of length  on my sleeves  wouldn't  be so  significant. I was naive. I had to seriously re-evaluate  being a fan because her establishment represents her like THIS.\n\nI'm sure your food is extraordinary  (I can only imagine it in the pictures because I didn't  get to taste it!!)  But your customer service  needs a SERIOUS upgrade!!!"

The food was delicious and they accommodated a couple of special requests well. The lemon ricotta cookies are a must! We already downloaded the recipe from Food Network.

We had a second plate of the lamb and I even had a chance to try a lamb chop.  The mustard crust with spinach, nuts and raisins, and herb imparted a nice flavor to the lamb and all the while not allowing it to dry out while keeping the center a rich magenta red color.  The 7oz filet is a conservative choice but kicked up with the presence of salsa verde and fried polenta.  I'm sure the porterhouse is an off the menu replacement for the Tuscan Ribeye tomahawk which they apparently ran out of that evening (as well as burrata -- how can this happen? In Las Vegas of all places?)  The one-and-a-half-inch thick porterhouse had a terrific presentation in a wok covered with mushrooms and an herb gremolata cooked a light medium-rare temp, sliced and plated separately.  The seasoning was a bit heavy handed in parts and the strip steak portion was predictably a little thick and chewy.  Though it was sized for two, I wanted to make sure I tried the Veal Chop.  For some reason I was expecting a grilled veal chop the likes of which you would find at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill but instead it was prepared milanese style like schnitzel or katsu.  Not that this was bad, it was just a poor substitute for a grilled steak; this is when I really missed not having the Tuscan Ribeye...\n\nSides:\n- Smashed Lemon Potatoes;\n- Sweet Corn & Spicy Sausage;\n- Peas, parsley, pancetta, pecorino;\n- Asparagus, white & green;\n\nSides were served family style like they do at a traditional steakhouse.  All were worthwhile.  I recommend the peas because they're prepared really fresh and snappy like they're fresh out of a pod;  betcha never had peas like this before...\n\nDesserts:\n- Honey Chocolate Almond Florentine (?);\n- Strawberry Crostata;\n- Chocolate Amaretti Cake;\n- Chocolate Chip Cookies w/Hazelnuts;\n- cheesecake;\n- Cherry Cream Puff;\n- Lemon Ricotta Cookie;\n- Chocolate Tiramisu, PB&J Tiramisu;\n- Strawberry Polenta Cake;\n- Nipple of Venus chocolate truffle;\n- Coffee Sorbetto, Strawberry Sorbetto;\n\nI think I got most of these right, they were all from the rose gold dessert cart.  There were at least 4 sorbetto and gelato, and several kinds of tiramisu, but the most memorable to me were the Chocolate Amaretti cake lined up in a row because I love ganache, and the Nipple of Venus (!) of course.  Most of the desserts were also embellished with gold flake.  Prix fixe diners were allowed up to five items, but all six of us were able to choose up to five picks because it's my birthday... =)\n\nThe service we received from our Server Cliff was exemplary. He was courteous, attentive, and prompt.  He told us up-front and early that the Tuscan Ribeye and the burrata were not available and I unfairly told him how ridiculous I thought that was, I now know that he was just the unwitting messenger...\n\nPerhaps it's my familiarity with her recipes and her cooking style that is mainly on display here as I'm convinced that many of her dishes are taken from her books, some of which I've actually made;  if you're a fan of her food like I am then I'm sure that you'll like the offerings.  Even though she wasn't present that evening, I couldn't leave without a signed version of her most recent cookbook.  Don't miss out on the chance to take a souvenir selfie from the photo booth too..."

So you may be able to get a seat there at the last minute.\n\nIt took two tries to make this work for me, even though I was alone. My first try was for an early dinner (just after 5pm), but managed to get a seat for lunch at nearly 1pm a few days later.\n\nI sat at the bar, and was quickly and courteously greeted. My bartender/server knew the menu well, and was able to make solid recommendations.\n\nI spent some time looking through the menu. Noticed there was an entire section of cheese plates. Ok, I'm all in.\n\nI ordered the burrata cheese for an appetizer and the Gorgonzola, arugula, and mushroom pizza for my entree.\n\nSo, here's my only real complaint: the pizza arrived about two minutes after the cheese. Sure, this is a small plates place, so having them out together isn't a mortal sin, but the cheese should be its own course, IMHO, and I did specifically request that I start with the cheese and then have the pizza.\n\nWatch your timing, guys.\n\nIn any case, I went with the burrata because it was a cheese I wasn't familiar with. It's basically mozzarella wrapped around a fresh cream cheese. It was wonderful, and actually lighter than it looked, which isn't to say it wasn't heavy. Just not as bad as it sounds.\n\nEat it with the toasted Italian bread they bring out. It needs to be spread, not eaten alone (which is how I typically like my cheeses).\n\nThen the pizza. It was a Neopolitan style dough, with a nice balance between the three strong flavored ingredients.\n\nLastly, as I was going to need some help getting through the day, after nearly 72 hours in Vegas, I ordered a coffee.\n\nWhen I want to test the espresso knowledge of a place, I ask for a doppio ristretto. My bartender/server had no idea what that was. Disappointing, but not unusual.\n\nSo, I asked for a double short espresso, which is the less pretentious version of the same thing. He knew what that was.\n\nSomeone else pulled the shot, so it seems like they have someone specializing in the espresso machine. That's a good thing in a place like this, that isn't pulling shots all day long.\n\nAccording to my bartender/server, Giada herself is in the place at least once a week. Unfortunately, that wasn't while I was there."

            "review": "We dined here last night for a early valentine's day celebration.   As locals working in the industry you very rarely celebrate anything on the actual day. When first arriving to the restaurant we noticed how beautifully decorated the hotel and entrance to the restaurant was.  If you remember what Bill's was before you would agree how much of a face lift this place got.  We checked out the photo booth before dinner since we got there 5 mins before our reso and they didn't seat us right away.  As we walked out of the booth the hostess told us our table was ready but not to worry about the pictures cuz it was out of paper to print them.   Why wouldn't you put a sign up or something so guests know to email the photos to themselves?   Or not take the pictures at all.  Whatever!  We followed the hostess to what seemed like the back corner of the restaurant.  The table she tried to seat us at was literally in the corner with a deuce so close to it we might as well have had dinner with the couple next to us and been a party of 4.  I asked her if any other table would be available.   She had us wait in the lounge while she went back to check.  We didn't mind the wait, about 15-20 mins, ordered a cocktail to start.  Great selling tactic if it was one!  Taylor, the hostess, came back to escort us to a table by the window overlooking the fountains.  She was super friendly and accomadating!  Honestly her willingness to help us was probably the highlight of our night.  Once at the table our server came over and greeted us, presented a wine list and dinner menu.  He took a moment to explain the menu and some signature dishes.  The gm came over and interrupted him during his spiel, said hi to us, said something to the server, and then walked away.  Weird.   (And he never touched the table after that)  I was torn between a couple different items and asked the server what he would recommend.   He didn't seem as if he wanted to answer my questions.  Almost as if we were bothering him.   We ended up ordering the orzo meatballs, bacon wrapped dates, burrata, and the tricolore salad to start.  They were all good, nothing spectacular.   The bread selection was good though.   We wanted to order a bottle of wine but had a couple questions for the sommelier.   He was tied up at another table and we didn't get a chance to order the wine until we were done with our apps.  A little disappointing.   In his defense the apps did come out quite quickly.  But still, no one likes to be rushed.  The weird thing was the apps came out super quick but we waited a long time for our entrees.   For our entrees I got the spaghetti, her signature dish.   It had these huge prawns with lemon and capers.  It sounds better on paper than it was.  My bf had the pasta with the pork ragout.   Both dishes were very bland.  We had to add salt and red pepper flakes from the bread presentation to spice it up.  I hate to say it but we were super disappointed.   We had heard so many good things about this place but didn't have anything good for ourselves.  They have this dessert cart that you see going around that apparently is only for the patrons who ordered the tasting menu.  So don't get your hopes up when you see it unless you have the tasting menu.  We ordered the cookies for dessert since nothing really jumped out at us.  They were unique.   Not soon after we dug into the cookies our server dropped the check.  Obviously he had someplace else to be and we were in his way!  Overall we were disappointed.  Not to mention once the bottle of wine was opened we had to keep pouring it ourselves.  Maybe $100 bottle of wine is too cheap to have any sort of table maintenance.   The server hardly came by to check on us.  Maybe we were just to critical of the place or maybe they were having an off day.  But none the less, with so many great options in this city Giadas will not be at the top of our list.  Sometimes people that work in the same industry are much more critical than others.  Or maybe not, who really knows."

I adore Giada and make her recipes at home often. \n\nThe ambience is nice, upscale, clean, pretty. The waiters jackets are all ill fitting which goes along with the hostesses skin tight dresses. \n\nThe wine selection is great and prices are fair. \n\nThe food sounds amazing but is subpar at best. I think that Olive Garden and carrabas deliver an equally quality meal for 1/3 the price. We ordered the lemon crab and fried artichoke appetizers. Crab was delicious but the artichoke was a disaster. Turned out to be a lot of hummus inside an inedible artichoke with the same cheese crackers they give for free which absolutely do not pair well with hummus.\n\nThe salad was a disgrace. Arugula with pancetta and candied lemon. There was a total of 7 tiny pieces of pancetta and no lemon. Basically arugula with a hint of Parmesan\n\nPasta was ok. The bucatini was spicy but bland. The tortellini was ok but undercooked. \n\nDefinitely not worth the money it costs. Save your cash or go elsewhere. Unless you have low expectations......"

Plenty of space between tables and the decor was modern but inviting. Kind of a mixed bag here as far as food.  We ordered the orzo meatballs on some Yelpers recommendation and they were served pretty cool. They might have been good but really too chilly to say for sure. Also had the salami and cheese antipasto plate and most of that selection was very good to outstanding. The parm was great!!    I ordered the risotto with crab and scallops. While tasty, not the level I expected from a high end celebrity chef venue in Las Vegas  My wife had the wago short ribs that she found .....just OK. The polenta it was served on was quite good however. Service was again. Just OK.  We ordered wine before ordering anything else and it came well after the meatballs arrived.   There was afore mentioned meatball issue and I had to chase a little for a check. Not bad service...Just not high level   Overall three stars just about says it and for $275 tip in for a couple I had expected a LOT more as to the quality of the food and service.  Lots of choices on the strip at this price point.  I'd choose others."

We all were happy to see her restaurant and wanted to know if this place was worthy of coming back to or not.\n\nWhen we came to the front desk, a hostess told us that we were able to be seated anywhere we wanted as long as it was in the lounge area of the restaurant. It was really busy and all the four person tables were taken so we settled for a seating that was meant for two people. Keep in mind that my family consisted of four people. This was the time when I started getting my hopes down.\n\nLuckily, soon enough, a waitress noticed us sitting in the cramped lounge and brought us to an actual table instead. I was so thankful! Our spot was away from the windows that overlooked the strip so I was a little bit disappointed. Little did I know that I would soon forget all about the view...\n\nOur waitress was extremely nice and her enthusiasm didn't sound forced at all like some other waitresses. We started off with an appetizer that consisted of: \nMussels\nChicken Marsala Meatballs\nArugula salad\nThe appetizers were very tasty but my favorite out of all of them would have to be the Arugula salad. There were a good variety of greens and the dish came with a very thin slice of cheese (I can't remember what type of cheese it was). I sort of wish that there was more cheese. The dressing was on point too!\n\nFor our main course, we ordered:\nWhole Roasted Chicken For Two\nCharred Asparagus \nSweet Corn\nThe chicken was meant for two but since my family was the type who can't eat a whole plate of something without getting full, we just ordered one of those. When the chicken came in there were about four hearty pieces of chicken and this type of soup or sauce that included veggies. It was the perfect amount for us! The asparagus and the corn were side dishes and complimented the chicken nicely.\n\nBy the time dessert came around, everyone was pretty full so we all shared a Souffl\u00e9. It came with a delicious scoop lemon ice cream that the waitress scooped in the souffl\u00e9 before our eyes. Powdered sugar was also sprinkled on top of everything. It tasted amazing!\n\nOverall, the service was great (besides the hostess)! Everyone was really nice and gave off a \"comforting aura.\" The food was fantastic and you can taste the quality in the dishes! I would most definitely come back when I have the chance."

A little cheesy to be honest. My mom and I came early for our reservation so we sat at the bar. Instead of giving us an actual menu they handed us an Ipad with the cocktail list on it. A little weird but I get it, trying to be up to date and whatnot I guess. \n\nOnce we were seated, our waiter came up to us and presented the menu and then also presented a set tasting menu that was I belive $120 BUT you also get a signed photo of Giada. What? This seemed strange to me and again, a little cheesy. She really seems a bit full of herself to be honest. We opt to not do this because honestly, we really didnt care about a signed photo of Giada. \n\nThe menu is huge and to be honest a little confusing. My mom and I decide to get a pasta dish and then an entree to share. Our waiter recommended the ravioli with lobster, green asparagus tips, and tarragon as a pasta dish and then the Veal Chop Saltimbocca so thats what we went with. The ravioli was really good but the veal chop was meh. It was a little over salted and we didnt finish it. Overall, if you are visiting this restaurant I would go with a pasta dish. The pasta tasted fresh and was delicious but our entree not so much."

But the kind woman on the phone let us know we were more than welcome to dine in the lounge/bar area where they served a full menu.

It didn't feel stuffy at all which was great! I always hate going to a nice restaurant and feel like I'm being sized up...\n\nOn to the FOOD!\n\nMy friend and I definitely ordered way too much food but whatever, it's Christmas! lol\n\nCHICKEN MARSALA MEATBALLS: This was delicious and it also came with wild mushrooms...

Definitely a must try!\n\nBRUSSEL SPROUTS ON CROSTINI: This was probably the only thing that wasn't as good as everything else but it was still delicious! Just that everything else stole the show....\n\nBRAISED AUSTRALIAN WAGYU SHORT RIB: This was the only main dish we ordered and shared. The meat literally melted in my mouth it was SOOOOO GOOD!

The salad and pasta were the second visit and they left much to be desired. The salad had too many flavors happening and way too much cheese (and I love cheese so that says a lot).

See the variety of ingredients in the salad in my pictuures?  As a meat lover the prosciutto was melt in my mouth with a nice serving of gorgonzola to make this meal really promising.  \n\nI ordered the crudo oysters and my husband was a fan.  Smaller in size, already cleaned and placed back in the half shell for our enjoyment.  Semi sweet, not too much of the ocean taste, which is a good thing.  \n\nWe had the salume pizza, about the size of a personal pizza.  I wish it would have been crisped up more, but it was popping with flavor.  You can't mess that one up, but good dough and good seasoning makes this a popular dish to share.  \n\nMy husband enjoyed the bucatini, but I thought this pasta dish was way too spicy for it's own good.  Topped with ricotta, I thought it was the saving grace for this dish.  We were forewarned, but it's definitely not my favorite dish.\n\nFor my main dish, I went with the salmon.  The buttery rich fatty goodness was the highlight of my meal.  My husband went with the surf and turf and all were cooked to perfection.  \n\nJust shy of $180, I thought it was a much better deal than what they offered for their tasting menu.  I'm not a fan when I can't really switch out the set tasting menu.  Some things just sound less enticing than the rest of the choices. \n\nOverall, I'm still a fan.  Eat a little bit of everything is Giada's motto.  The only reason why we're here is for our special anniversary.  The view is amazing when the sun is setting.  I think Giada lucked out with this prime location in the Cromwell hotel."

Waitress was sweet but did not have  sufficient knowledge of cocktails.\nSince I don't have any reason to give a good review it should also be noted that this place is very casual...

Two of my favorite quotes from his review, that I feel cover all of my feelings:\n\n1.  \"All of it is in a relaxed, approachable California-Italian mode, and none of it is very hard to leave on the plate,\"\n\n2.  \"Something was missing here -- maybe the commercial that on television would have run between the first chicken and the second.\""

Perhaps we should \"modify\" our reviews with more restraint so everyone doesn't catch on and swarm this place for the next 5 years? You know... instead of 5 stars and phrases like, \"OMG! It was all so amazing!\" we could tone it down to... \"uh...it' was okay, if you are into to awesome food and all that. Meh. I mean, sure it looked and tasted good, and the location was great... and Giada was gracious and lovely, but really... who cares about such things?\"  You know, add a tone of ennui to our reviews to keep everyone else away before we never get a chance to come back.  Just a thought.  By the way- the Vermentino goes excellent with the lemon shimp spaghetti, and the Leviathin red wine goes perfect with the lamb.  So-- back to my point- Stop promoting this place or we'll never be able to get a reservation. Let's make this Las Vegas' best kept SECRET! :-) Muhahahahahahaahaha! *evil laugh* ...and keep it all to ourselves!"

And I thought I'd love her food. Unfortunately, I paid way too much for disappointment. I now wish I didn't do the tasting menu. It is exactly what it says. Just a taste. Maybe I should have just ordered off the regular menu. \n\nSome bits of notes for future goers including me:\n\nAldante apparently means \"some crunchy bits\" in spaghetti. \n\nTasting platter means \"much smaller than a mouthful\"\n\nFree reign on dessert cart means \"you get 3 pieces\"\n\nThe dessert cart included cookies which were extremely lackluster but I guess it did have a very tasty limoncello cheesecake...\n\nService was off. We hardly saw our server. When he asked how it was we did say it wasn't what we expected. He tried getting us some limoncello in a glass. It didn't help. The main reason we were so upset was because everything we had was already so extremely lemony. The potatoes were raw on the inside and was drenched in lemon. The creamy or cheesy polenta was a block of cheese. The lemon spaghetti was hard spaghetti with basically more lemon and dessert was lemon with more lemon. \n\nI can't understand why we paid $250 for two people. Is a picture of Giada with some recipes worth $75? I suppose I can't say all of her food is bad. I just didn't expect this when all of her counterparts in Las Vegas have SO much better options. Otto and Mesa Grill are by far much better restaurants. \n\nSorry Giada. I will not be attending your restaurant ever again. I'm sure this will not ruin your success in the future but I just wanted to voice my disappointment. \n\nThat is all"

The food is the issue. I had the tortellini  with peas and pesto sauce. For a woman who is always making delicious looking pastas on television this was a great disappointment. Too much cheese and the pesto had a mint taste to it. Yes basil is from the mint family but it shouldn't taste like mint. The others that I was with had pizza and one of the sandwiches. Nothing remarkable there either. I think they better get their act together and revisit the lunch menu and add some of the wonderful pastas that showcases on her television show."

We checked in right at our reservation time, the girls barely acknowledge us and then we waited 10 mins to be shown to the table.  Waiting wasn't such a big deal, but them ignoring us and lack of politeness wasn't what we expected. Then once shown to our table we were seated by the hostess and that was it.  She didn't say a word, didn't give us a menu nothing.  Took another 10 mins before anyone came to our table to acknowledge us.  The waiter spoke so quietly that I could barely him him.  When I asked him questions he couldn't explain the menu to me, I asked twice.  And worse of all he wouldn't speak to me, he would turn and talk to my husband.   We found out later that he left out  information about the menu that might have changed our dining experience all together.  When I finally gave him my order, he kept trying to get me to order more food.   \n\nI will say that the food was fine, not awesome but good, not worth the $$ at all.  Service was horrible.  The restaurant was dimly lit and  loud and the tables so big that you can't talk to your dining partner at all.  Along with the dim lights the menu was in a very small light grey font, we had a hard time reading the meuns.  ( we weren't the only ones, saw other tables using flashlights to help them see).  \n\nIf we had only gone for coffee and dessert it would be 4 stars, that was the best part of the experience.  \n\nNot worth it!"

We started with the bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese, and although I've had many before, these dates were scrumptious. My dish was a lemon lobster ravioli which was fine; I was expecting more bold flavor. But surprisingly, the star of the evening was the orange mocha. The best dessert coffee I have ever had. It's made with their house made orange syrup. I can't believe the coffee is what impressed me most. So much so, that my husband and I are going back to Giada's today, just for the coffee before we leave town. \n\nOverall, a very enjoyable experience."

To top off the food, your cocktails, wine pairings and service were unbelievable! We were greeted with a smile and welcomed to the table with a very genuine greeting. Your staff must love working here! My Giada cocktail was handcrafted...with love.  It even had a G stenciled over the top of the egg white foam! I loved the fact that you have such an amazing selection of Italian and California wines to choose from for our meal. What better way to compliment your California inspired Italian cuisine.  This is a must try for a Vegas local or even a Vegas commuter.  My first visit usually determines whether or not I will make a second trip back to dine, and this experience was a no brainier for me!

The ambiance is aided by a good spot on the Strip with spanning glass windows that give way to views of the Bellagio fountains and Caesars Palace. It feels more high-class than it is, but that's not to say the meal disappoints. I found myself wanting more of the Three Cheese Tortellini, as the braised beef broth and Genovese sauce was dynamite.\n\nWe were in Las Vegas for my birthday, and our very kind (and legit Italian!) server sneaky brought me birthday cookies, with fanciful presentation. He continuously thanked us for attending and making the restaurant part of my birthday.\n\nThe only complaint was the initial wait. We had reservations and for a Saturday night, they did not seem particularly busy. There were maybe five people waiting to be seated, so we went ahead and asked for a window seat. They said they would try to accommodate, and after about 25 minutes, we passed an open window seat to be seated not at a window. Oh well. Oh, and they offered this hokey, expensive three-course option for like $100 where you get a souvenir menu encased in a silver pamphlet that had a generic picture of Giada De Laurentiis in it that probably wouldn't have even been worth stealing.\n\nAmbiance: 5/5\nCocktails: 4.5/5\nActual Giada De Laurentiis presence: 0/5"

I have all of giadas books and have followed her for years. Go to Ferraro's on paradise for a truly amazing meal. The ambiance was fantastic, one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever seen with the best view of the strip. But when you live here in town you get very spoiled by all of the great restaurants. Also typical Vegas, it gets too crowded and the quality control goes down. Most of our food was cold instantly because of the open windows and you can tell it sat around before it was dropped off. The signature Giada cocktail was warm. We asked for ice cubes, and they actually brought us a bucket of ice instead of making a freshly chilled drink. And what's the deal with being booked on open table from 5-10 pm Every night when it wasn't even all that busy?! Any time we voiced complaints or concerns to the server(s), they listened attentively then gave some explanation saying \"that's the way Giada likes it\", and masterfully ignored us. Apple tart was nearly raw, I could have made a better pizzette at home, lobster Arancini had no flavor. Orzo meatballs were good and so was the bucatini. But they were just good, nothing spectacular. If you rarely go out for a nice dinner you will probably enjoy it there. Not impressed at all."

Nearing closing time, the windows were slammed shut, & there went all of our ambiance (literally out the window.) Something about the lovely natural elements detracted from the air-con, set to full blast, & the overly simplistic decor which lacked character. Weather permitting, keep them windows open!\n\nThe dessert cart rolled by several times, tempting me. When I finally tried all three cookies (lemon, chocolate chip/ricotta, PB with blackberry jam), a bite of blueberry eclair, & a spoonful of dark chocolate amaretti cake, I was disappointed that they had tasted no better than a run-of-the-mill buffet dessert (at triple the cost.) \n\nTwo appetizers stood out as phenomenal: bacon-wrapped dates were sticky & plump, and crostini w/ ricotta, honey, lemon, & pink peppercorns were addictive bites of sweet & savory; the olive oil drizzle was magnificent & (I assume) a high quality one. \n\nHe enjoyed the salumi (bresaola & proscuitto) and cheese (parmesan & mozzarella) platter. The sage honey & spicy grain mustard accompaniaments were especially delicious. \n\nThumbs up for his rack of lamb. I chose farroto (faro) with fava beans, morels, & pecorino, which was extremely salty, & not up to par with the other amazing items we tried. \n\nI'd be hard-pressed to recommend; just another celebrity chef getting paid to throw her name on a Vegas eatery."

She's one of my favorite celebrity chefs because of her take on Italian dishes with a healthy and fresh Southern California twist.\n\nWe made our reservations via Open Table which was a completely painless process. I originally had us set to go for brunch (when the prices are a little cheaper) but knew I couldn't possibly go home without trying a pasta dish, so dinner it was. Plus it would give us the option to try dessert as well. I've had my eye on the cookies, especially her signature lemon ricotta ones.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is absolutely stunning. Gorgeous light fixtures, chic decor, and floor to ceiling retractable windows with spectacular views of the both the Paris and Bellagio fountains. \n\nBecause we were there in the evening, it was candlelit too making it very romantic. I would have loved a window seat but we still had a nice view from our table. \n\nOur server was knowledgeable and had great recommendations for us first timers. I really liked the idea of her tasting menu, but at $140 a person we couldn't justify it. Had it been a special occasion maybe, but not for an everyday dinner. \n\nWe started with cocktails ($15 each) which were both great. Mine was the La Strada and had Campari, homemade lemon sorbeto, Bertagnolli Limoncello, and Proseco. Tart, a teensy bit sweet, and refreshing. I don't remember which one my husband ordered, but I believe it had orange bitters and egg whites in it. \n\nThe complimentary bread plate is interesting and we enjoyed the different flavor and texture combinations. You get thin breadsticks, crunchy Parmesan chips, and a small loaf of an olive oil bread with rosemary. Alongside is finishing salt, red pepper flakes, capers, pesto, and the most phenomenal lemon mascarpone butter in the world. You must try it! We couldn't get enough. \n\nWe wanted an appetizer so we agreed on the fried artichoke with orange hummus. We weren't expecting to see a whole artichoke come out. We figured it would be individual breaded and fried bits. It was messy and annoying to eat, but at least the flavors were there. \n\nFor my entree I chose the lemon spaghetti with shrimp. Our server warned us about the small portion sizes because the pasta dishes are not meant to be a main course. It actually ended up being a perfect amount, though I don't feel was worth the hefty price of $34. The shrimp were fishy and over cooked resulting in an unpleasant chewy bite. The lemon pasta however was perfection. \n\nMy husband ordered the spicy sausage pizzette and it was comically small. He said the flavors were okay but nothing to write home about.\n\nWe decided to skip dessert to avoid any further disappointment, and as soon as we asked for the check our once attentive server went awol. We sat with empty drinks and cleared plates for nearly 20 minutes until he arrived back with it. It ended our meal on a more sour note than I had hoped. \n\nOverall, as long as you realize that what you are paying for is mostly the experience then you won't be let down. Should we make a return visit, I wouldn't mind opting for brunch next time. \n\nThey even take a photo of you downstairs before the meal, and try to get you to pay for a souviner copy on the way out. It all seemed gimmicky to me, but I suppose that's merely Vegas."

Service was impeccable, the decor is upscale, yet understated, the food was incredibly flavorful, and the wine an excellent complement to my meal. I dined there with a friend on Friday, May 13. \n\nWe waited a few minutes to be seated for our 5:45pm reservation (made via Open Table), and were gratified to receive a table for two with a strip view. We weren't right next to the windows, but rather directly across. The tables were staggered, however, so we could clearly see out the window without having to look directly at our fellow diners.\n\nThe most delicious bread items were brought to our table almost immediately, as was still water from a bottle.\n\nWe decided to order the tasting menu and were extremely pleased with our choice. I chose the pea pesto tortellini and the tenderloin. My friend had the spaghetti with shrimp and the salmon. We shared the antipasti, lemon potatoes, and corn/sausage. While we chose different pasta and main courses, the flavors of both of our choices blended impeccably with the shared dishes. Giada truly understands flavors and how to complement them to please the palate. I prefer my meat cooked to medium-well temperature, and sometimes that means that the meat may not be as soft as it would be at a lower temperature. However, the beef tenderloin cut like soft butter even though it was only slightly pink and NOT butterflied. This speaks to the cut/quality of the beef and the skill of the chef.\n\nI ordered the Il Boro Super Tuscan wine and it paired beautifully with my meal.\n\nAfter we had finished our food, we were presented within 5 minutes or so with the dessert cart, from which we could chose three selections. I chose the lemon cheesecake, a slice of raspberry mascarpone tart, and the raspberry tiramisu. Holy moley!!! All three selections were of a decent size and delicious.\n\nFor around $175 with tip (each), I was completely pleased and wouldn't have changed a thing. I will note that I do not regularly spend that amount of money on dinner. My usual choices are more in the $50 range. However, with it being Las Vegas, a name chef, the location, the decor, the impeccable flavors in the food, the very complementary wine, and the excellent, unobtrusive, friendly service, I didn't blink an eye at the bill. FIVE STARS!"

I love, love, love her recipes on FoodNetwork.com, and I melt for her smile and personality.  Naturally, a group of friends plan a trip to Vegas for a 50th birthday and so we book a late Sunday lunch for 10 people at Giada, the restaurant.  This is going to be great!\n\nWe show up on time for lunch and taken past the very attractive cold display case of olives and other menu items, past the long open kitchen, and we are seated at a large round table in the middle of the dining room.  The space is open, with high ceilings, and huge windows that are canted open, allowing a lovely breeze through the room.  To me the decor was fairly unassuming, kind of like being at home in your living room - comfortable, laid-back.\n\nAfter our initial seating the service became spotty.  Our server was ok, but basically left alone to tend to our table she was less than attentive, not meeting expectations considering the menu prices at Giada.\n\nI had read all over Yelp and elsewhere about the Spaghetti with lemon sauce and shrimp.  Well, primed to try that dish we were told that it was Sunday at 1:30, and they were serving only brunch.  It was a different menu than normal, and the Pasta dish was not on the menu.  And no.  They can't go off menu.  Hmmm...  Plan \"B\".\n\nSo we got Brescaola ($13) and Proscutto ($18) and cheeses to start.  All decent.\n\nFlatbreads, or pizzas, were just ok - the sausage ($16) version much tastier than the Margherita variety ($14).\n\nOrzo meatballs ($15)are an interesting take on the traditional but while tasty, they didn't get \"wow\" reviews from the table.\n\nBetween the appetizer and main courses the server came by to clean up plates and silver.  Remember, we're at Giada, not Olive Garden.  The server takes our plates, removes the silverware and places the silver back on the table for the next course.  C'mon Giada.\n\nThe Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese was unique and tasty.  I added San Daniele prosciutto, and I think it was $24.  Tenderloin Sliders were ordered by several of my friends, and these were probably the best sandwiches on the menu, albeit pricey at $30.\n\nThe Lasagna ($24) was terrific.  Get it.\n\nSeveral lemon souffles were ordered for the table, and they were delicious.\n\nAll in all, I expected so much more from Giada.  Service was meh.  The plates and bowls were oddly chipped.  We got one set of silverware for everything but dessert.  Food was 3 to 4.5 stars.  \n\nSometimes first dates just don't work out.  Sometimes you have to try a second time.  Sometimes things get better in a relationship, even one with a restaurant.  I hope that's the case with Giada.  As a foodie who's in love with the celebrity I hope this doesn't have to end.  ;)"

With huge glass windows looking out into the strip and bellagio fountains, it's truly an ideal date night place :) We had the grilled octopus and butternut squash soup for starters. Loved both. For entrees, I highly recommend the spaghetti. As simple as it sounds, it's a nice twist to the traditional dish. Giada makes it with a lemon basil buttery sauce, topped with capers. It's served with 2 large prawns. It was definitely filling. Papaya dells was also delicious. I wish their service was better. Our sever was slow to bring out menus and it took him a while to take our order. Giada's is worth a visit. The menu has a lot to offer and the food is good and priced right."

The food and service was great. \nThat said, I called 2 weeks ago and made reser-vations for 3 of us. 3 days ago I received a message from a hostess in regards to my reser-vations and to call them. To my surprise, I was told that if I wanted a window table (to be clear, I asked for a booth 1st and said, if you have a view that's great as well,) ok....now, I was told that if we wanted a window seating we would have to guarantee that we would each purchase $100 minimum per person. I am not cheap. Nor do I like being told how much food to stuff down my gullet. I let the hostess, a snotty, condescending and eye rolling thru the phone little girl name Farell, know my opinion.  I called back and spoke with an assistant manager. I live here in Vegas. I've never ever been told I had to promise to buy a quota of food, much less by a child hostess. If you're into being told what to eat and how much to spend, go for it. There are so many other wonderful places to eat here in this town that I will be enjoying."

I give Giada 3.5 but rounded up to 4\n\nPreface: I came with a party of 9 and a baby\n\n//Food//\nAmazing! Everything was pretty tasty.  We ordered an large appetizer to share.  I'm not exactly sure which one it was but it included what I believe was Giada's \"favorites\" like Crostini, bacon wrapped dates, wood roasted mushrooms, eggplant, olives, etc.\n\nFavorites: 28 oz bone-in ribeye.  Holy moly was it huge.  The sunny side egg just made it even better.  My husband thought it was a bit salty and his was overdone which is why I took 1 star off.  He didn't send it back because service was SLOW...he was starving so he gave in and ate it the way it came.\nPappardelle - it was perfect.  Pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was flavorful.  I also had our server add a bunch of parmesan cheese on top.  It was amazing.\nI forgot what it was called but we had a hazelnut chocolate tart for dessert to share.  It just hit the spot.  Everyone had a couple bites and it satisfied our sweet tooth.  \n\nRisotto was good but I generally don't like risotto and my cousin liked her lobster ravioli which I didn't taste.\n\n//Service//\nSLOW.  I loved our server Joseph.  He was great however food came out extremely slow.  I was also disappointed that they didn't offer any birthday desserts.  When you spend that much money, it's a shame you can't provide them with at least a cake and candle on the house.  \n\n//Highlights//\nThere's a Photo Booth in the waiting area and you can have them emailed to you.  The printing option wasn't available when we went."

I don't know much about Giada as a public figure, however my fianc\u00e9 wanted to bring his mother there for Mother's Day. We made a reservation and got seated right by the window. I definitely recommend making a reservation and I'll tell you why later. Also, it has a great view of the strip definitely ask for a window seat. I have gone there two times and had two different experiences the first time was again, for Mother's Day. We made a reservation got seated right by the window and everything was excellent except for the fact that they decided to open the windows. This made us all cold because it was so early in the morning the strip hadn't gotten hot yet ever, the second time I went they have the windows closed the entire time. The service was amazing, the food was amazing, they even had a specialized menu for the occasion and gave complimentary champagne to each mother in the restaurant. I thought that was fantastic. A brilliant idea. I had such a great experience that I wanted to go again. The next time I was in Vegas, I made my fianc\u00e9 take me for another brunch. This time we didn't have such a great experience. I guess we were a little hangry upon arrival so that didn't help, however we did make a reservation and got seated about 45 minutes after our reservation. Our hunger just kept growing and we knew if we left at that point we wouldn't eat for another 45 minutes because we relocated anyways. So we just stuck it out and were patient. By the time we got there we were so hungry we barely and joyed our meals. For this reason I was unable to give a five star review, but the food is excellent, the service is excellent, I would definitely recommend Giada's."

The sweeping views, from just a few floors up, overlooking Bellagio and Caesars were just fabulous.\n\nRegarding food and service, I would say very good, but not excellent.  Not quite worth the hype, and not really worth the money to me.  I am not sure I would return for dinnner, instead I think I might choose breakfast, where I get the same views.\n\nAll the appetizers were wonderful, however I found my chicken to be just a touch to the dry side.  Dessert was also quite good.\n\nDo I think the restaurant is worth trying, absolutely, but to have such a huge demand on reservations, and have them so hard to get, I simply don't think the restaurant lives up to all hype."

The staff at the greeting desk all wore the same black dress but it looked subpar as it didn't fit well and super short on some of them but I got over it.  Seated on a round table which was nice. Ordered the medium size Giadas favorite appetizer platter and we devoured it - it was very tasty especially the bacon wrapped dates. The table ordered various items - risotto, braised short ribs, spicy spaghetti dish that starts with a 'b', and surf and turf. The risotto hit the spot along with the spicy spaghetti. The bummer is that my friends surf and turf came out incorrect-her steak was rare when she asked for medium well. By the time it was sent back and redone for her, we were all done with our dishes which was disappointing for a first time experience. The manager did come by to apologize and did the right thing by providing a complimentary samples of desserts. Overall it was  good but could have been better. I think one of the highlights for us was goofing around in the photo booth in the reception area and taking group pics! It was also nice that they had someone to take picture at the bottom of the stairs-that's a nice touch for special occasions"

I loved the tour of the place before seated at my table. I absolutely appreciated meeting the manager, Avi, during my stay and the wait staff was wonderful. The menu presentation is current and unique and the bread tray was delightfully unexpected in design. I ordered the seafood risotto, a dish I had been eyeing leading up to my restaurant visit. I love how the spice/ garnish tray complimented my meal, with mini bowls of capers, red chili flakes, pesto, and grated Pecorino Romano. The dish was the right combination of savory and salty and truly satisfying as I hope it would be. Very minor detail of the night that could use improvement - filling my water glass. Water was my primary beverage for the evening and rarely had someone come over to make sure my glass remained filled. But that is just a minor detail that can easily be fixed. All in all, my experience was fantastic. Best customer service I received ever from any place I've eaten. I am coming back next time I'm in Vegas. And I'm bringing friends!"

Service less to b desired. Going down hill. Servers were way more attentive the first few months of opening for us. Our waiter took our order & we didn't see him again till he brought the bill. Never mentioned any specials or checked to see how things were. Hope he splits his tips with the people that actually waited on us. Plus we felt rushed the whole time. We hadn't even decided on an entree and he kept wanting us to order it with apps. Glad we didn't because both appetizers came out at the same time as the complimentary bread seconds after our drinks. Wasn't relaxing. If I'm going to spend $$$$ on dinner I don't want to be rushed. Giada has been there on the previous visits & things seem to run more smoothly when she's there. Can't count on that all the time.\n\nSide note. We asked for a table by the window when we made reservations. They wanted $100 a person to guarantee a table. Although most will probably spend that while there, I'm certainly not paying in advance just to look out a window."

I've always been impressed by the celebrity's TV cooking, but this food was very ordinary and very expensive.\n\nVeal chop and calamari were breaded and fried and tasted like you could get in most any diner.  The roasted asparagus was overly roasted-tasting with a funny after taste.\n\nThe whole chicken was presented then taken back to the kitchen to be cut up and the tomato/vegetable accompaniment put into a serving bowl.  That was probably the best tasting dish.\n\nLobster ravioli was good as was the Salumi appetizer - but for the price, none of this food met expectations.\n\nLike another reviewer, the sparkling or still water options leave me feeling upsold."

We arrived for our 6pm reservation and were told that the restaurant was running behind and had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated. No problem, we were okay with that. We let the hostess know we had a time constraint and she said she would alert our server. Once we were finally seated we sat for over 10 minutes with NO menus! My sister flagged down a waiter and he politely came over and gave menus and told us our waiter would be with us shortly. \n\nFast forward 15 minutes, no service. We were appalled, our waiter NEVER stopped by our table... any service we received we had to stop someone walking by and request. Now, I don't want to start throwing around accusations but we were the only people of color in the entire restaurant and we weren't served. I'll leave it at that. When the hour was nearing 7pm my friends and I got up and walked out,,,,,  still hungry and very disappointed. Our assigned waiter just stared as we walked by. We made a complaint to the manager onsite and I later received an apology via email from another manager, I do appreciate them reaching out and apologizing however, after how we were treated on Saturday I'm not sure if I'll make the effort to try again the next time I am in Vegas which is a shame, the food looked good too!"

I went in stoked. \n\nLike others we made a reservation for two and were kept waiting about 10 minutes. The ambience is incredible. Seriously so pretty and so well thought out. \n\nHowever, I really thought the food would be incredible as well. We started with an anti-pasta meat and cheese platter. The mustard on there was delicious. The signature cocktails were full of layers. Awesome. \n\nThen the charred octopus came out. No sauce just a small potato pasta. Thank god for the little potatoes. We didn't even finish the octopus it was so blah. \n\nLobster ravioli. Possibly undercooked. Or maybe the recipe calls for tougher ravioli. It could be something I wasn't used to. The sauce was not my favorite I felt as though it were missing something and just tasted a lot like butter. \n\n28oz steak and the surf and turf next. His steak? Charred beyond edible. I tried it. I finally just forced him to say something, it's an 80 dollar steak you should like it. The waiter (David, phenomenal by the way) apologized and removed it while buying my date a drink. Impeccable staff. Still had anxiety doing it and felt horrible afterwards. Still he seemed understanding. My dish was cooked perfectly if you like sweeter sauce go for the surf and turf. \n\nGreatest part? The chocolate tart. Get it. Worth it. \n\nIf it were not for David we would probably have left really disappointed. Hats off sir! Also our busboy was hilarious. If you're looking for five star go to Scarpetta at the Wynn."

There were three antipasti, crostini carpaccio and dates wrapped with bacon and red bell pepper with goat cheese.

We end up splitting the spagetti and taking the bolognese home.\n\nThe third course, I had the Sicilian roasted lamb and my wife had the seared Salmon with succotash. Both came with smashed potatoes and sweet corn with spicy sausage. All were excellently done and beautifully served! with every course Rocco replaces our plates and silverware.\n\nAnd finally the dessert cart! We get to pick 3 items each, but the waiter let us taste everything since it was late in the evening.

If you choose to eat at the restaurants here, you're paying a premium. We know that and are completely ok with it. Giada's was no exception. \nThe restaurant is lovely but we missed out on any type of view as our table was tucked into a corner. We started in the bar with a cocktail that was well made. Once to our table, we were greeted by our server who was very pleasant. The bread was good...I found the focaccia to be nice and spongy but just ok. The different spreads were a nice touch.  After choosing a nice glass of red, we started with caponata and burrata. I am a burrata freak but remarkably, this was again, just ok. Not as creamy as I would have liked. The caponata was good. I did enjoy the taste but this is an example of being disappointed in the price ratio. \nWe went with pasta because, really, life is all about pasta. Lemon shrimp and pork ragu. The portions were plenty and our server was kind enough to bring plates so we could share both dishes. We felt that the pork was the favorite. More flavor and well balanced. The shrimp in the spaghetti were huge and succulent but the sauce was not what I was hoping for. I imagined a bright, lemony sauce that was light and fresh. This seemed a bit muddled or heavy. It didn't sing and for the price tag, it should have been a soprano! \nI enjoy cooking and make some great food so when I'm paying for it, I suppose I expect to taste something I can't do in my own kitchen. \nI will say, our moment there was very relaxed and comfortable. We were not rushed, the pacing was perfect and they allowed us to linger over our wine. This is very important to me in a dining experience. Unfortunately, I probably won't return in the future. However, I remain a huge fan of Giada and all she does."

The waiter told us that all the appetizers and drinks were on the iPad. Using an iPad cheapened the experience for me and the authenticity of the restaurant. Just because restaurants are starting to implement iPads does not mean it works in a fine dining setting. And to make things worse the iPad froze multiple times. I also thought it was a little tacky when the waitress put the price fix menu on our table. It's okay to suggest it but to have a whole folder that takes up half the table is too in your face especially on ones first visit. We decided against the price fix until we knew the food was worth the price. \n\n15 minutes after sitting down there was still no bread brought to our table so I requested some from our waiter. He comes back with three different bread choices and a side of toppings. I was surprised that the one topping I did not see was Parmesan. The bread was very underwhelming but I did enjoy dipping the breadsticks into the pesto. \n\nI ordered the caponata and the spaghetti with shrimp lemon and basil. My dining partner ordered the bucatini for her main. \n\nBefore the caponata came our waiter said caponata is usually served with bread but Giada's is light enough to be eaten on its own. While the caponata was not heavy it was still a little much eating it on its own. The spaghetti I ordered was solid even though it could have used a little more seasoning. The shrimp was some of the largest I have scene however it was sitting in what seemed to be a small puddle of blood and this turned me off. I tried my friends bucatini and ending up like hers more and she liked mine more so we traded. The bucatini pasta was well cooked but the sauce was undeveloped. \n\nWe ordered the cookies to go for dessert and they were great. My favorite was the palmier."

Giada's located on the strip and there's loud music pumping in the restaurant as well as Las Vegas strip traffic coming from the outside.  The decor is contemporary.\n\nWe ordered the lobster arancini, charred octopus, arugula salad, chicken Marsala metballs, tortellini, and branzino.\n\nThe complimentary bread was a miss.  The olive oil bread was super oily and the breadsticks tasted stale.  The charred octopus is a miss.  It tasted like bad seafood from Chinatown.  The flavor was definitely off.  The lobster arancini was disappointing and I couldn't taste any lobster.  The chicken Marsala meatballs were try.\n\nThe tortellini had a good flavor profile but was super dry.  The only hits were the arugula salad and the branzino.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered lemon bundt cake.  I've never had such a dry mealy cake.\n\nThe service was definitely great, but I won't be back because it wasn't worth the price.  Perhaps those we rated Giada's higher had a better experience."

Well worth it for a special occasion. Make res WAY in advance.. They fill so fast! And I see why! The timing of the food coming out was perfect, the flavors and they quality and presentation were amazing, the staff is perfection! The atmosphere is clean and crisp and fantastic. The drinks, coffees (upside down cappuccino was great!!!) and the desserts were so good! Get the three kinds of cookies, you won't be disappointed! I'll go back for sure. Good job Giada's staff! :D"

It was hard at first getting a reservation. We had called months ahead of time and they said it was all full but we can try the day of. The the day of rolls around and we walk in only to be turned away as both tables and the bar were full. So we call the next day, still no luck but the girl on the phone said she would squeeze us in the next day. The day comes and they couldn't find our reservation. But they still took us. Awesome. We got a mini tour of the restaurant and were seated with a great view of the strip. So far so good.\n\nThe services was freaking amazing. The waiter was very attentive and personable. The recommendations he made was great. He brought us complimentary toast sized spritzers. (It was delicious) We never had to ask for more water as the cups seemed to fill themselves. When we got up to use the restroom, our napkins mysteriously folded themselves. (I later saw that a waiter had taken away the used one and replaced it with a brand new, folded one) The manager came by a couple of times to check on us. Overall, the service is what I would want from all \"fancy\" restaurants.\n\nNow on to the food. I went with a party that liked to eat, so us 4 girls spent $280 on dinner. We ordered 3 antipasti dishes, 1 salad, 4 entrees and 1 side. The appetizers were really good, we got the calamari, mushroom pizza, and broccoli rabe. The breads were very interesting (in a good way) and the lemon butter was the devil. I just wanted to eat the butter by itself and lick the bowl clean. I forgot what salad we got but it had arugula and parm cheese and it was delicious. For the main course, we got the 28 oz. ribeye (complete with sunny side up egg), the rigatoni, salmon, and the risotto with the side order of lemon potatoes. The waiter recommended trying the balsamic vinegar with the ribeye, which I was hesitant to try at first, but was very glad I did as it was amazing. Everything else was fantastic as well.\n\nI only wish we had room for dessert. We spied it on other people's tables and it was in these cute little cups. We made full use of the photo booth. :)\n\nI can't wait to try more of the menu the next time. This restaurant is now on the top of my list for vegas."

            "review": "My guess is you are going to love or hate this restaurant.  I recommend, if you are interested in dining here, go with an open mind.  That is exactly what my guest and I did.  Having heard Giada had a rough start and after reading some negative reviews, just had to give it a try.\n\nGlad I did.  First, the Cromwell, which opened about a year ago, is the perfect location for Giada's restaurant.  Her boutique approach to Italian food is a good match with the small, intimate feel of the Cromwell.  The staff at the hostess station were pleasant, professionally dressed, and appeared glad to have us join them for lunch.  In a town so jaded, this was refreshing.  After seating us, the hostess mentioned our server by name, indicating she would be with us soon.  And she was.  In less than two minutes our server arrived, warmly greeted us and on learning this was our first dining experience, offered some drink suggestions.\n\nMy guest stated the sangria was perfect for a hot, 100+ degree Vegas day.  We then ordered the Caponata, Chicken Marsala MeatBalls, and the Muffuletta.  The presentation was clean, simple, yet elegant.  Before describing the individual dishes, a thing each dish had in common was a balance of flavors and textures.  Each dish had an ingredient that was to designed to be the focus of flavor, but was well complimented by the flavors of other ingredients.  First the Caponata.  Was stunned how good it tasted, and again, perfect for a hot Vegas afternoon.  The Chicken Marsala Meatballs were unbelievable.  The texture was firm, yet moist and savory. As I am sure you would agree, often meatballs can be oily or greasy.  Not the case here.  These could be eaten by hand, if you were so inclined.  But use a fork and mop up as much of the sauce as possible on each meatball. The Muffuletta is what surprised us the most.  Having spent way, way too many misspent days and nights in New Orleans, I know a great Muffuletta.  As is the case with most of her dishes, Giada did a traditional sandwich, but with a slightly more subtle taste from what I am accustomed to, and she \"knocked this one out of the park.\"  Alert: you might not like this if you are looking for the absolute traditional Muffuletta.  But I think the texture of the bread, the quality and taste of the meats and cheese, along with the not over the top Muffuletta spread were, in my humble opinion, the absolute perfect match. We finished with a cup of coffee that was hot, fresh, and presented in a nice, slightly oversized cup. We also tried the cookie platter for dessert.  I am not a dessert person, but Giada has created a selection of cookies that are very different from each other, yet go well together.  My favorite was the chocolate-peanut butter with the dab of blackberry jam in the middle.\n\nAgain, if you keep an open mind and look for how she has combined flavors, I think you will like.  Nice job Giada!"

I would have preferred classical or at least Italian music vs what was played which was modern pop and r&b music. Their motto was 'eat a little bit of everything, and not to much of anything' which probably explains why the portions were extremely tiny. I ordered the salmon which was delicious BUT was still hungry afterwards. The waiter had told us that the desserts were share-able -so my boyfriend and i ordered a Lemon bunt cake to share- but we were surprised to see a tiny sliver of cake that we ate with literally 3 bites -and that was around $13. \nOn top of that, the waiter spilled our cream (for coffee) and never cleaned it up, and broke a few glasses while walking around our table. \nIt was extremely over priced for the amount you receive (one cup/coffee was $6-and refills are NOT free).\nIt was a shame that we couldn't decide what to tip our horrible waiter; a charge of $61 was added to our bill of over $400 for his tip!\n\nover priced, tiny portions and horrible service But ambiance and the view were beautiful."

New York Times' Pete Wells compared the space to a museum since everything from the napkins to the plates to the tons of retail merchadise showcase the brand of Giada de Laurentiis, Italian-born American celebrity chef.\n\nThis profit-driven objective may be easily be overlooked by well-heeled diners with its tasteful but casual interiors and satisfying food.  You are greeted with counters of freshly made pasta and antipasto at the entrance.  The space is relaxed, chic and beautiful, with views of the Strip.  $100 will get you satisfied for lunch, but for dinner and drinks, you'll definitely need $200/head or more.\n\nServing sizes are a little small, but the quality of food is excellent.  I really enjoyed the seared tuna bruschettas, the scallop risotto and the Tomahawk steak was excellent.  There are evil servers wheel around a dessert cart coaxing you to spend some more.  Giada is a well-oiled machine to please, but make sure you read the fine print.  To view more photos, check out my blog. :) http://findingtheyummyinvegas.com/dinner-party-giada/"

My wife had made a reservation many weeks in advance of our visit, and requested a window table. We arrived about 15 minutes early so we went to the bar for a drink. Another unknown couple joined our table. The cocktail waitress handed us an iPod showing the drink menu. So far, OK. I ordered a Stoli on the rocks that was listed at $14. They brought the drinks and we waited. She said we could start a tab and take our bar bill to the table. Then the cocktail waitress came over and said one of our tables was ready, but she didn't know who. So I went up to the front desk and asked, and they said I had to settle up with the bar before we could be seated. So I did. They charged me $19 instead of $14. When I asked why, they said it was because the listed prices were for a martini, not an on the rocks drink. \nWe were seated at a table nowhere near the windows. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, a caprisi salad and the lobster ravioli to start. The waiter brought the dates in good time. I thought they were just OK, and after the second one the taste was so sickly sweet I couldn't eat more. Then we waited and waited and waited. At least 45 minutes passed when our waiter came up and apologized, saying the kitchen was overwhelmed with an influx of 200 guests. I thought this was a poor excuse. It was a Saturday night, they knew how many reservations they had, and should accomodate accordingly. We were about ready to walk out almost an hour later when the food arrived. The caprisi salad was bad. The tomotoes were tough and the dish had little flavor. I took 1/2 bite of the ravioli and put my fork down. This stuff was tough as leather, had no flavor, and was lukewarm at best. My assumption was our food sat in the kitchen for some time before being delivered. But even then, the pasta was not cooked well. So we complained and the assistant manager came to our table. She apologized up and down, offered spaghetti, cookies, etc. At that point I just wanted to get out of there. The damage was done. She was generous enough to not make us pay for the bill. When we asked why we couldn't get a window table after specifically requesting it on the reservation WEEKS in advance, she said that only if guests can guarantee they will spend $100 per person, they don't give you a window table. REALLY? And of course none of this was mentioned when booking.\nOn top of this it was my birthday, they knew of this thanks to my wife's reservation, and this is what we got. We won't return. Maybe go there for a drink then eat somewhere else. We had a more enjoyable experience at Fuddrucker's. I'm sure Giada would not want her name associated with anything we experienced there. I can cook better at home."

Food and service was amazing.   I had some wine and a couple of the starters as they're not yet serving from the menu at the bar.   I won't get into the food as it is discussed here but I was not disappointed.  Giada was there also checking on the tables.\n\nWhat really made me stop was watching people get seated wearing flip flops, board shorts and tee shirts.  Yet I had to go back to the hotel to change shoes.   I guess Giada only wants the beautiful California crowd.  So, if you're in the 50ish bracket you better dress up or she won't let you in.   I was very disappointed in their screening of who they're trying to stop from getting in."

One of the best meals I had in Vegas! I had the seafood risotto and it was the perfect portion for me before going out! No one wants to be stuffed full like you're going to get sick anyway! The quality of food was excellent!! If you're looking for large portions, visit one of Vegas' many buffets!"

We made a reservation through the \"Open Table\" app that same evening. The ambiance and food was all good, what we expected and more. I just didn't like the place we were seated. We were right next to the podium where the waiters would input orders and process payments. I cannot even count how many times I heard \"excuse me or sorry\" while eating our dinner. We were seated with the view of \"The Strip\" but did not like that the podium was so close behind me.\n\nThe photo booth is a fun touch and cool souvenir since you can text or email it to yourself or free.\n\nThe other thing that bothered me was they have the hostesses all in uniform, but for a \"supposed\" classy place almost every hostess had tattoos and that ruined it for me. Because then it seemed like they should be working a street corner. At least the gentlemen wore coats and looked more professional.\n\nThe food was fantastic we ordered the chicken meatballs, the white pasta, and the arugula salad."

            "review": "Dinner last night started off on a sour note - the prices for cocktails or wine are nothing short of ridiculous.  Seriously, $15-$22 for a small glass of wine? It was insulting.\n\nAs you can expect from that, the food portions are small and pricey too. I don't necessarily object to small portions, but at Giada the pricing is high. The waiters are careful to warn you not to order a pasta as your entree, as the portion is too small. Odd. $28 is high for pasta most places, let alone one they tell you is just 4-5 oz.  And so it goes at Giada.\n\nIn all fairness, The food was mostly quite good.  The exception was the Giada appetizer,  which i would skip next time as it clearly was pre made and sitting in the refrigerator.  Cold crostini doesn't cut it...it felt like airplane food. The food that was cooked to order was SO much better.  The lemon pasta with shrimp was quite tasty, and the rack of lamb was high quality and perfectly prepared. And the bread and flat bread crackers were amazing....the accompanying pesto oil and capers, in particular, were outstanding.\n\nWe loved the decor...it's fun and contemporary. But good grief who chose the music? it is awful...much more suited to a club than as a backdrop for dining.\n\nI am not sure we'll return.  I would like to, as some of the food is very good.  But we really would like to see Giada and her staff rethink a few things - starting with the pricing of the wines and the pastas and that absurd music.  Giada the restaurant has potential, but it isn't there yet. I hope they pay attention."

The cheese was good, they serve it with a honeycomb that is hard to eat and you are picking wax pieces out of your mouth for the rest of the meal. For the entree we ordered the pasta carbonara. The lemon zest flavor is overwhelming and doesn't do with the pasta. I would have liked the pasta with Giada's bottled pasta sauce that you can get at target better than what I got. This was a complete waste of money and time."

The manager who was rude right off the bat did comp all the food which was about $500 dollars but he had a chip on his shoulder the entire time he talked to us. He seemed very annoyed we had complaints. Not a complaint but multiple complaints. He had the entire table cleared of all plates and told them not to bring anything else.

So when I found out that she was opening her first restaurant I was super excited to try it. \n\nA friend is visiting Vegas and wanted to check out The Linq. We had already had dinner so we decided it was still a great opportunity to check out Giada for a few drinks. \n\nThe restaurant was beautiful with lots of attention to detail. And that's where the good ended. We walked right past the hostess stand since they looked busy amongst themselves. We figured we just wanted to grab a drink at the bar so we didn't bother interrupting the hostesses talking to each other. Once we got inside one of the hostesses came up to us and asked if we had a reservation, so we told her we just wanted to get some drinks at the bar. Apparently there is such a thing as a waitlist for the bar (keep in mind it wasn't even full.) We were told that if we gave them our phone number they would call us in about 20-25 minutes once something opens up. Guess what? They never called!!!!\n\nTo say we were disappointed with the level of service and professionalism would be an understatement. Really it's just plain rude. I guess it's my fault for expecting that a restaurant of someone who seems so down to earth would be so unwelcoming. Giada, thanks to your staff you have lost a longtime fan. \n\nIt wasn't a total loss though, luckily we found the Bound by Salvatore bar at the casino level of the Cromwell. Great service and super delicious cocktails!!!"

We were so excited on our walk from the Bellagio but once we got up the escalator at the Cromwell things started to go downhill. We arrived and the hostess said that if we wanted to sit at a table we had to wait til 9:00. I asked what time it was currently and she said 8:54 but we had to wait 6 minutes to get a table. When we were being led to the dining area, we expected it to be busy and that was why we were asked to wait. There were two other tables with diners. The entire restaurant was empty. We found it odd that we had to wait over 6 minutes to be seated in a near-empty restaurant that opened an hour before we got there. \n\nWe ordered mimosas, which was delicious, and then asked our waitress to bring us one of the fresh pastries to have before our main dishes arrived. The menu says that you can order one pastry or four pastries. I specifically said one and the waitress brought us four. We decided that we needed to send 3 of them back because there was no way that two of us could eat four pastries and then eat our main breakfasts. So we flagged down our waitress and explained that we said we wanted only one pastry. Our smiling waitress all of a sudden had a pissed off look on her face and started arguing us about the pastries. We told her it said you could order one on the menu and then she got all huffy and puffy about having to take back 3 of the 4. One of the bussers asked her what happened about 8 feet from our table. And she hid behind a column obviously complaining about us. The rest of the meal she didn't go out of her way to provide any great service to us which we thought was absurd since the whole ordeal was her mistake. \n\nMy friend and I both enjoyed our entrees but there are plenty of other breakfasts in Vegas that are on par or better than Giada's. I would return for lunch or dinner but think I'll skip breakfast next time!"

My husband had the hash which he loved full of fresh vegetables and I had 2 eggs with side of spinach in olive oil and tomato and potatoes. It makes such a difference with good, fresh ingredients. They give you a choice of condiments which included lemon zest marscapone butter, chocolate almond butter, strawberry jam, pepper and Himalayan sea salt.

A big fan of Giada as well since I watch food network A LOT. \n\nArrived at Vegas and this was our first stop due to our reservations. A remodel hotel that has Giada right at the 2nd floor. If you wait outside the restaurant, there is a photo booth for you to take pictures. Yes I said it, They so ballin' that they have a photo booth to use(too bad i hate taking pictures or else I'll be all over that haha). \n\nANYWAY, when you first walk in, you can see all their different kind of homemade pastas and it's kinda an open kitchen sort of way. Greeted by our server that thoroughly explain the items on the menus and cocktails. You have an electronic(ipad) menu. We decided to order the tasting menu(I forgot the name), two appetizers, two pastas, and two entrees. The manager came up to us and check on us which was awesome. We were also given complimentary drinks which was an extra +. It was a sweet wine drink that was given to us topped with lemon. Sooooo good. Not sure why they gave us the drinks(maybe cause they're barely open)\n\nI love the hot bread that they give you. Although, I can't eat too much of that because it's such a heavy filling bread. \n\nGrilled Broccoli Rabe w/ calabrian chili vinaigrette - nothing too special but I do like the chili oil sauce on it. Plus, it's good to have some kind of veggies. \n\nFinocchiona - the salami. It was enriched with flavors. Topped with grapes and apple. Goes wonderfully together. \n\nThe sampler came with Chicken Marsala Meatballs w/ roasted wild mushrooms, Citrus Marinated Calamari salad w/ sundried tomatoes & olives, Lobster Arancini w/ calabrian chili pomodoro & basil aioli, and shrimps. We ordered the medium size one. \n\nI don't know if it's me personally but I was really disgusted by the Chicken Marsala meatballs. I thought it had a really strange flavor to it and this is probably the thing I don't ever want again at Giada + the Lobster fritter thing. The lobster thing was so so. I felt like it tasted better than it looked. I liked everything else after that. They had this shrimp that was marinated in a salad sauce that was really good. They give you JUMBO shrimps because the shrimps were fucking huge. It was really tasty. The cucumber frittes/fries were addictive and so was the calamari.\n\nPersonally, the two things that I loved the most was the two pastas. Ravioli (rah-VEEOH-lee) lobster, asparagus tips & tarragon  and the *Spaghetti (Spah-geh-tee) shrimp, lemon & basil. The Ravioli was Godly good. The skin was perfect and the inside was filled with lobster. I recommend eating it as a whole bite because if you tried to eat it piece by piece, the sauce comes out from the ravioli making it less flavorful and tasty. The *Spaghetti (Spah-geh-tee) shrimp, lemon & basil was really amazing. It seems so simple but the spaghetti was soo good. It tasted fresh and they had fresh shrimp that compliments it well. The lemon and basil wasn't too strong which made me love the dish. I recommend people to get their pastas...it was heavenly. \n\nThe two entrees were lovely as well. The waiter described the salmon as one of the best salmon you can get and I think he was right. It was so juicy and it was cooked perfectly. It seemed like it was still a little raw but i think it was meant to be like that because it just add another layer to the dish. I could do without the succotash. \n\nThe veal was really good as well. It was fried perfectly. if you cut it, the juices flows out. Look at pictures and it is topped with cheese on top. A really heavy dish.\n\nOh and the other thing I didn't like about GIADA was the side dish Sweet corn & spicy sausage . I think it was a personal thing but I thought the corn wasn't cooked all the way. the sausage tasted fine and all but the corn had a nasty texture to it. \n\nBEsides that, I recommend GIADA to all people. I can't wait to come back again the next time and trying more of their pastas and hoping to meet Giada herself. Excellent experience with amazing food and service! Cheers"

The place is super smoky; all of the cigarette smoke comes right up the escalator and settles in the restaurant.  The view is beautiful if you are lucky to get a seat near the window.  The servings are SUPER small.  To start, the waiter gave us one small roll to share with various dipping options (i.e. pesto, capers, parmesan, etc.)  Then we ordered the Chicken Marsala meatballs to share, which meant we each got 2.5 small meatballs; I liked the sweet taste of them.  The waiter said something to my husband about how we're supposed to order course after course to fill up because the portion sizes are small, but doing this would cost a small fortune.  I ordered the crab arancini and liked it, and my husband ordered the rigatoni and hated it. He said it had a hamburger helper taste to it.  Overall, the menu is lacking variety.  Everything has lemon in it (i.e. the rolls, the potatoes, the arancini, the cookies, etc.) or it has fish in it (the ravioli was made with lobster, the arancini with crab, the spaghetti came with shrimp. etc.)  We also ordered dessert, and it was by far the worst and most expensive dessert we've ever had.  The cookie plate was disgusting!  The chocolate chip cookie (if you can call it that) was greasy and it had no taste, and my husband thought that the lemon cookie was inedible.  I would say that if you're a fan of Giada's show or cookbooks, this place is worth a one time visit; just go knowing that the portions are tapas small for a big price."

We waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. We thought it was such a cute idea that she has a Photo Booth for patrons to use while they are waiting for their table. We ended up getting the tasting menu (everyone is forced to get it at the table, unfortunately), which costs $120 per person. You get to select 4 courses and get an autographed copy of the menu signed by Giada. \n\nThe waitress was really nice and they were on top of refiling our waters. My husband and his friend were iffy about the tasting menu because they wanted to get the surf and turf and the waitress offered to see if they could add that to the tasting menu instead. Everyone gets the same first course which is a variety of appetizers. I wasn't a big fan of it because one of plates uses goat cheese and I hate goat cheese. My friends thought the goat cheese was really \"goaty\". One of the other dishes on there reminded me of throw up so I wasn't too keen on it. My next course I got the lemon spaghetti which was not too bad and my husband got the charred octopus (which was substituted by the chef because we asked). The octopus was really good. The portion for the spaghetti was a decent size and I was already starting to get full. My next course was the salmon which was good as well. I enjoyed it and my husband got the surf and turf. We were extremely disappointed by the description of surf and turf. You get about a 6 oz. filet mignon and ONE lobster ravioli. Yes, only ONE. Finally for dessert, the waiter brings out a dessert cart and you get to pick 3 desserts. I picked the nipple of venus (really rich), the tiramisu (awesome!), and the strawberry sorbeto with fresh fruit (so light and refreshing). \n\nBy the end of the meal, my friends and I noticed that Giada loves to use capers and lemon in all her dishes. We were kind of sick and tired of it. Capers and lemon are used from start to finish (from the bread you eat to the lemon in the dessert). So 3 stars for lack of variety and for paying $120 per person for a tasting menu, not really worth it."

It also took us about 15 minutes to get our first drinks once seated.  I get it, it's new and it was Saturday night.  \n\nAs for the food?  Crazy.  Crazy good.  it made me forget about the rough start immediately.  We had four courses, each as good as the other.  We started with an Salami dish that came with pickled cherries, apricot, and two kinds of mustard.  Sounds odd, but you roll them all up into one bite and you understand why they make it.  I was shocked how well they balanced each other out.  \n\nSecond we had chicken marsala meatballs with roasted wild mushrooms.  I thought I knew what marsala was supposed to taste like...nope.  This was far better than any meatball and sauce I have ever had.  How did they make chicken meatballs taste that good???\n\nThird we had pasta (bucatini calabrian chili pomodoro & fresh ricotta) .  It was just as good, and now I understand why fresh pasta is key.  This dish will finally get me to break down and buy the pasta attachment for my kitchenaid mixer.  \n\nThe main course we decided on was the whole roasted chicken for two, cacciatore style.  First off, they bring the chicken in a large bowl to you from the kitchen, uncut for your inspection.  They take it back at that point and cut it for you.  This gives you time to wipe the drool up.  The flavor was amazing, and had a smoked paprika rub.  The cacciatore sauce was perfect.  \n\nOn the side we had crispy polenta with checca sauce.  I have never had polenta, so I did not know what to expect.  I was expecting something close to grits, but this was so much more.  The texture was like silk, and the flavor was mild and tasty.  \n\nThis meal was worth the wait and the price."

There were two ladies up front. One immediately asked if we had a reservation. We didn't. It was spur of the moment. She said we could sit at the bar for a couple minutes and then we'd get a table. The whole restaurant besides the bar was empty. Two gentlemen were behind the bar. One who was in our area didn't take our order. The other one did. Whatevs. We ordered a Bellini and a mocha. His mocha came out with a G on it. You go, girl. By this time our friend has joined us. Then I noticed people being seated. I asked the bartender what was going on. Then a hostess walked up-not for us. The lady never put our name down. It sounded like she did it a lot by the way the bartender reacted. Any hoot, we got seated. Awesome view. Our waiter was slow but eventually we ordered the Strawberry Polenta Waffle, Breakfast American, and\nItalian Chicken & Waffles with Cacciatore sauce. My waffle-little dry but still good. My friend asked for over medium eggs. Damn near raw still. She asked the waiter for new eggs over hard this time. She got her over medium eggs this time. Her meatballs were amaz-balls. The best meal was my boyfriend's. The Italian chicken was juicy and the waffles were cooked to a light crisp and it all paired well with the cacciatore sauce."

I ordered the panino with zucchini fries and it was delicioussss. My other friends had some sort of pasta dish but were a bit disappointed since the portions were really small and it wasn't anything extraordinary according to them.\n\nBUT, the best part of it all was when Giada came out!!!! We saw a buncha people and cameramen hovering around this area and people started coming towards that area with their cameras in hand. Then we saw it was actually her and was so starstruck!! There was a line waiting to meet and take pictures with her and she attended and talked to each and every one of us. She is so beautiful and just as nice in person as she is on screen. The nice thing was that it wasn't so chaotic with people pushing and running up to her, everyone was very respectful and waited for her. No rowdiness or anything. THAT, I must say, was the best part of the dining experience =) LOVE YOU GIADA!!!!"

Fritto Misto was excellent, the eggplant rollatini was surprisingly good since I don't usually care for eggplant, and the meatballs were good though we think they could have used more sauce. Romaine salad was cold and crispy and delicious. I had lobster ravioli and truly this is the best food I have ever tasted. Hubby had veal; it was breaded and properly fried, served with a delicious, cold, chunky tomato sauce on the side, and this was a generous serving of veal. We shared the sweet corn and sausage side dish. The sausage was very spicy but the flavor was still excellent. The trio of tiramisu and plate of cookies, along with an orange and cocoa espresso capped off an extraordinary meal. The service was absolutely first class; our courses were impeccably timed and our glasses were never empty. We had the privilege of meeting Giada herself, which made this a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience. This was a pricey evening for us at just over $100 per person (with only 2 drinks) but worth every penny for an extraordinarily unique dining experience."

When I heard they were redoing Bill's and turning it into a boutique hotel I thought that should be fun I guess. But when I heard they were turning it into a boutique hotel with Giada's first restaurant I though OH EM GEE I have to go!\n\nI finally got to try Giada the other weekend when a Vegas virgin friend of mine decided to visit and thought it would be a perfect opportunity to go. Now the big thing I should stress is: MAKE RESERVATIONS! I called about 3-4 weeks in advance as soon as I knew my friend was visiting and they told me their reservations were already booked for Friday night. However, they managed to squeeze me in by calling the restaurant themselves. \n\nOnto our night. After check-in, there was a fun (and free) photobooth where you can take 3 pics and it prints out a fun photostrip for you as a keepsake! We had been waiting a little bit outside so decided to go to the bar and wait instead. I ordered the Destroyer, which is supposedly one of Giada's personal favorite. It had tequila and I was already sold. \n\nAfter sipping our libations we were ushered to our table and boy was it a great table. It was a lower level booth that faced the Bellagio fountains and Ballys. Request it if you can, folks. I was digging everything about the table and decor of the restaurant. Very homey yet classy at the same time for a hotel restaurant. Request it if you can, folks.\n\nThe food.. you already know if it has Giada's name on it. Our group of 3 shared three appetizers and each had a pasta dish instead of any mains and it was quite a lot of food. My favorites were the bacon-wrapped dates and my pasta dish was her lemon spaghetti. I was able to order it with chicken instead of the shrimp (personal preference). The pasta was not too lemon and a great texture and consistency. The bread 'basket' and butter sides they give you are also to die for. I asked for seconds!\n\nOverall, a simply splendid evening with great food and company. The only thing that could have made it better? Giada herself of course! We were told we JUST missed her from the afternoon :( Giada, invite me back when you are there please!"

Decided to go here because I am a fan of Giada and what better way to show appreciation than to check out her first restaurant?! All I have to say is that the food, service, and experience was one of the best, and I'm not just saying that. Been to quite a few places so trust me on this one.\n\nI went here with some friends to celebrate both a birthday and surviving a semester of medical school. We made our reservation about a month in advance and the earliest time we got was 9:45 p.m. Parking is pretty confusing to find and we ended up in the confusing and super shady Linq parking structure. We arrived late, but they were also running behind schedule so we didn't get seated until 10:30ish. Waiting usually bothers me, but there was a photo booth that you must check out. It kills time and is a great way to get a little FREE souvenir because you can print out photo strips!!!\n\nThe food was pretty awesome. I ended up ordering Giada's signature dish of lemon spaghetti which seems so plain, but it was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever eaten. I was finally able to appreciate good pasta and experience what true al dente is like. You must give this place a shot at least once. The pasta had some firmness and chewiness that was just so novel to me. You get two huge pieces of shrimp which was so tasty and light since they were not drenched in sauce. The capers were a weird addition to the dish, but they kept things interesting with their strong taste. You also get free bread so check out my photos to see what that's like. I also ordered a molten chocolate lava cake which was way too sweet for me so I didn't finish it. The sauce they gave was pretty interesting because it had such a unique citrus taste to it. \n\nThe whole experience was just awesome and it was nice to have a terrace view of the strip while dining. Our server was really nice and helpful. He made us feel at home and made sure we knew what we were ordering and was honest about the portion sizes of the dishes. Definitely a big plus in my book. Most waiters would just try to make you order the most expensive items on the menu.\n\nAgain, check this place out if you ever get the chance. Just don't come here super hungry, unless you have serious cash to burn, then by all means go for it."

We were seated promptly on arrival at a window-side table overlooking the strip and the beautiful Bellagio fountains.  \n\nI ordered the Chopped Tricolore salad-  prosciutto San Daniele, tuscan kale, endive, radicchio, dates, walnuts, Gorgonzola dolce.  So freaking delicious.   Our server suggested it stating that it was her favorite and I can see why.  \n\nOur appetizer was the Orzo meatballs w/ parmesan pomodoro sauce.  Good, but not amazing.  It came with three medium sized meatballs.  When I stabbed my fork to grab one of them, it kind of fell apart.  \n\nLastly, we had the Gorgonzola, wild mushroom and kale pizza.   Lots of kale, but lots of flavor.  Some might say the cheese can be overwhelming, however I'm a fan of Gorgonzola.  The pizza seemed to be drizzled with some kind of sweet vinaigrette or sauce but I forgot to ask what it was.  It was very good though.\n\nOur server was very pleasant and very helpful.  She kept our waters filled and was very knowledgable about the food that was being served.   She even offered to take a family photo of us before we even asked her to do so!  \n\n4 stars for the food and another 1 star for great service.  Also, on your way out, be sure to try the photo booth where you can take photo booth pictures that you can email to yourself."

A warm and contemporary Italian American eatery that delivers great tastes with the energy that is Vegas.  \n\nThis is not an authentic taste of Italian regional specialties rather refined and prettied up versions of Italian American favorites.  All good, it works.\n\nThe majority of the menu centers around small plates of antipasti shared family style.  Flavors are very complimentary so ordering a wide variety of dishes works.  An incredible simple grilled broccoli rabe natural bitterness is enhanced by hints of char and smoke but brought to life by a spicy, chili vinaigrette.  Sweet peppers stuffed with a tangy goat cheese and peppery olive oil create a very well balanced dish exploding with freshness.\n\nFor seafood antipasti, do not pass on the lobster arancini.  Dressed with a spicy pomodoro of Calabria chili and a touch of a herbaceous basil aioli that elevates the sweetness of the lobster.  Slightly cloying mouth feel but great flavors.  \n\nGreat selection of well made salumi.  Try a variety.  The Bresaola and finocchiona as good as any in Tuscany.  Add a selection of cheeses with perfectly paired condiments (Mozzarella with a citrus chili pesto,  Parmigiano with honey).  \n\nSmall selection of pastas.  The lobster ravioli excellent.  Perfectly cooked sheets of pasta surrounding chunks of barely cooked through lobster perfumed by tarragon.  Richness on richness but it works.\n\nThe only weakness of the restaurant are the mains.  A mustard, walnut, and raisin crusted rack of lamb, while perfectly cooked was one dimensional, needing more herbaceous, lemony gremolata.  A bone in \"Tuscan\" rib-eye topped with a sunny side up egg did not make sense.   The yolk did nothing to elevate the flavor of the beef rather giving it an unpleasant yolky aftertaste as it cooled.\n\nService is a work in progress.  Slow and lacking confidence.  This will definitely improve with time.\n\nDecent wine list at Vegas resort prices.\n\nGuys, admit it, Giada turned you on to cooking shows.  Now the chance is here to try the food you know you never cooked.  Worthy."

We did have a private area which was nice. It was difficult to get through to the reservation system. Since we had 14 people, I had to talk to the group sales manager. Mine was Sandra Bailey (sbailey@caesarspalace.com), who was useless as she never returned any of my calls or emails. After speaking with the admins there (who were very helpful) they put me in touch Ilona, who sent me the relevant information. She provided me a list of options and had mentioned that the minimum spend per head was $150 per person. Looking at the menu this seemed like an exorbitant amount for what you get. I booked two separate tables to get around this and then later had them combine them when we arrived. I am glad we didnt go through with the family style. The food is mediocre at best. I had the spaghetti and tried the roast chicken both were not really what I expected from a restaurant representing a world famous chef. One of the guys tried the surf and turf and said that the beef tasted exactly like the roast chicken. The service was good but lets be honest, if the best thing about your restaurant is the ice cube in your drink that has a \"g\" in it, you're wasting your money."

Chest.\n\nI was dead wrong. 100% completely wrong.\n\nWe had the tasting menu. It turned out to be a little different than the menu we had looked at online prior to dining, but I have to say even with the modifications, it was basically within the top 3 meals of my life, and that includes 5 meals at Grant Achatz restaurants.\n\nThe antipasti platter was great. The focaccia in the cast iron ramekins that comes with the bread plate is something I want to steal and make myself. Sadly, we didn't get any signed menus with recipes like others have reported.\n\nThe pasta course was slightly lacking ONLY because I didn't think the quality of the pasta itself was on par with anything I'd eat in Italy. To be honest, the pasta was not al dente. It was crunchy. It could have used an extra minute or two of boiling, and I can almost guarantee it wasn't homemade (Edit: The chef reached out to assure me it was homemade). BUT the sauces were out of this world. I didn't even realize the Bolognese was vegetarian. It was AMAZING. The lemon cream sauce on the spaghetti was so good, I again want to steal it and make it myself.\n\nThe main courses were sublime. My rack of lamb and my brother's filet mignon were expertly prepared and couldn't possibly have been any more perfect. They were supremely high-quality cuts of meat, and they were done amazingly well. Surprisingly, the best dish of the night was one of the substitutions we didn't expect. It was the side of creamy polenta with sausage. After I tasted it, I almost wanted to tell my brother it was bad so I could finish the entire family style portion. No sharing.\n\nWe apparently got a special treat as far as desserts were concerned. I think it's because our reservation was for 10PM, and we managed to get the last tasting menu of the night. There wasn't a dessert cart to speak of, but they came over and plopped down a platter of SIXTEEN DESSERTS (2 each of 8 different types), explained what each one was, and said \"Enjoy!\" and walked away. We expected to be able to pick a few. We ended up getting all sixteen with whatever we didn't finish packed up in a nice little box to go.\n\nI want the recipe for those ricotta cookies too. The second I tasted them, I knew I'd had them before... From a little Sicilian grandma who has a tiny patisserie in England. I was immediately transported to Italy, and that's a REALLY tough thing to do, as I'm a hugely critical judge of Italian food in America. I actually found myself trying to find little pieces of the cookies that were stuck in my teeth just so I could keep tasting them, and that's something I've never done with any food ever.\n\nIn all, it was an amazing experience from start to finish. I'm not sure if Giada reads any of these reviews, but if she does, I just want to apologize for everything I've said about her in jest. Now the things I've said about Guy Fieri on the other hand; I'll defend those until the day I die."

But after spending almost $300 on an extremely marginal meal - sans any expensive wine - I was a little taken aback by just how bad Giada's really is. For instance, a $79 bone in ribeye came with a bone so big it would have made Fred Flintstone blush. Extremely showy, but not very much fun if you were actually looking for meat, as the bone had to take up at least 10 ounces of the dish. The meat itself was completely flavorless - it didn't seem at all seasoned, not even salt - and the cut was most likely \"choice\" as opposed to something quality. The mushroom soup my wife ordered was flavorless and bland, but the lemon/shrimp spaghetti pretty good. All in all, not awful, but so many better choices. Of course, one needs to remember that Giada's prides itself on a \"female centric\" tasting menu, where no one actually really eats any food beyond a nibble (but the white wine and xanax flow freely.) Even desert was blah. Of course the setting was spectacular - and there was \"big name\" guests in town, but I can sincerely tell you that the hot dog I had at Pink's in Planet Hollywood about an hour after this meal was a far sight better than anything Giada put on the table. Even the waiter seemed adept at suggesting only the most expensive dishes - and ways to share them - so everyone is on point - problem is, just not sure what point they are trying to make at Giada's. Let's see: Pretty face - check. Celebrity pedigree - check. Really cool surname that evokes the glory of American film - check, check, check. Decent food that tastes good - hmmm? Save your money - there is so much better in Vegas."

She was a huge grump and no smile or welcome at all.  If she had said something along the lines of they can't give me a table due to not having a reservation, fine.  But she literally said, \"Since you're alone, you can ONLY sit at the bar.\"  Really?  That's odd to me.   The bartender was fine, but not friendly at all.  The atmosphere here is way too pretentious.  The hostess left a very sour taste in my mouth before I even was seated.  \n\nDespite my admiration of Giada, would I come back?  Nope.  There are far too many delicious places with excellent service on the Strip, so why deal with young snooty pretentious girls?"

            "review": "We were super excited to try this place and went without a reservation at about 11:30am.  The polite hostesses told us to come back in about a half an hour, which was no problem - I assumed the restaurant would be crowded and busy, as it just opened.  When we returned, we waited a little longer, then were seated near the bar.  The restaurant has an amazing view of the strip, but we couldn't see anything from our table.  The restaurant was about half empty, leading me to believe this was more of a soft open - I know they haven't been open for lunch long.\n\nService was very friendly.  I had the Prosecco sangria, which was delicious, and we had some fantastic chicken meatballs.  The bread they brought out at the beginning of the meal was absolutely wonderful, though a bit greasy. I was very disappointed to see that there was only one pasta dish on the menu for lunch - I thought for sure Giada was famous for her delicious pasta dishes!  I couldn't order the baked pasta, as it contains pork, so I went for the lemon pesto grilled cheese, served with spiralized zucchini and potatoes.  It was quite good, but it took a really, really long time to come out.  Like, probably 40 minutes.  It's a grilled cheese!  We were getting pretty antsy - not to mention hungry - and we prefer spending our time wandering around Vegas, not sitting in a booth.\n\nMy husband ordered the muffeletta sandwich, a wedge of bread with various cured meats.  We later realized this sandwich is premade and is sitting with the antipasto items in the front deli case area.  Why did it take 40 minutes to put a premade sandwich on a plate with salad?  He found the bread somewhat soggy, likely because it's premade.  It didn't take long after we left the restaurant for my husband to start to feel ill and nauseous; he ended up out of commission the rest of the day.  I'm not sure how long the sandwiches were sitting in the case, but it might have been just a touch too long.  He had not eaten anything else that day save a banana, and he hadn't had anything to drink but water.\n\nThe wait staff was very kind and attentive every step of the way.  However, it appears that they just haven't worked out lunch yet.  I would not return."

Our waitress, Lauren, was very charismatic and gave us a really good overview of the menu. The menu items are very pricey; however, the food was delicious and well worth it. I highly recommend the Mortadella with focaccia bread for an appetizer. I loved the arugula salad. The Parpadella with pork was delicious .  You must definitely order The roasted corn and potatoes as a side ... You won't regret it. I loved the roasted Banana ice cream with chocolate gelato... Yum.

The bad side is the loud club type music, totally ruins the Italian fine (or even casual) dining experience.   The food, on the good side, presentation in all dishes was amazing.  The pasta was fresh, well cooked.  The bad, which was not bad it was just OK, 4 separate appetizers and none with a wow by any means.  Missing small stuff, no black napkins, plates so over used marks on them. For the price, worth dessert for the view but that's about it"

We had reservations and arrived 10 mins early, but since our table wasn't ready we sat in the bar area. Waited for 10-15 mins and finally had my husband ask for a drink menu because no one approached us with one and no servers arrived. We were ready to order and our table was ready. By the time we were seated we were ready for a drink! Our server was very attentive to the larger tables and took some time to get to us. We had to request bread because it didn't arrive with or before our appetizer. We ended up canceling our drink order because it took over 20 minutes to arrive. Our food was delicious though, I had the ravioli and it was amazing. We would've been more than happy to give our experience the max stars for the food alone but based on the slow and subpar service our experience was disappointing."

The restaurant looks very nice, but it was overly loud including the street noise.  We couldn't even hear our waiter describe things on the menu.  They gave us an iPad for the drinks/wine list that was very slow to scroll through the pages.  The sampling appetizer dish was good, but nothing spectacular.  The  Paste e Fagioli soup was very bland.  The biggest disappointment was all of our entrees. Everything was EXTREMELY SALTY, the bone-in Tuscan Rib-eye was cooked well but none of us could take a second bit without gulping down a glass of water.  Same is said for their pizza.  The highly recommended Spaghetti with shrimp wasn't any better, the shrimp was overcooked to the point that it was hard to cut.  Everyone took 2 bites of their food.  We pointed this out to the waiter and he insisted that the manager should be informed of the problem. Once we told the manager of the problem, he just gave us a nod in agreement, and all he offered to do was to give us dessert and walked away.  He did not offer to remake, replace, or asked us what we wanted.  We struggled through dinner only to decide that it wasn't even worth our time to stay and try their desserts.  Bad service, horrible food, don't think we'll come back here."

We garnered a great table overlooking the fountains and each ordered a drink. We got a kick out of the \"G\" in the ice cubes. \nWe proceeded to order several appetizers including the eggplant and the Ricotta with honey, lemon and peppercorn. The eggplant was good but the ricotta dish had too much honey so it was more like a desert than an appetizer. \nIt was about this time that I noticed a chip in the bottom of my bread/appetizer dish. I pointed it out to the busperson, he took it away without an apology and never did bring another dish for me. \n\nThe things that I really did enjoy were the bread plate which had a small crock of warm foccia, 3 small breadsticks and a flat bread along with some lemon butter and the best thing about the visit, the fried capers. I found a new addiction with these tasty toppers!\n\nAll three of us then ordered the Risotto with crab and scallops. It was well prepared and tasty although the crab seemed a little \"fishy\". I guess you get spoiled living at the ocean with the freshest seafood.\n\nI passed on desert as I was not feeling too well on the appetizer although my friends shared and loved one of the deserts.\n\nAs we were finishing up, my friend noticed there was a chip of glass out of the bottom of her water glass! Two chips in one meal....that was bizarre. They have someone walking around polishing the glasses at empty tables, but apparently not looking for things that could harm their patron.\n\nAfter we had paid and were leaving I asked to speak to the manager to tell him about this so he didn't think we were trying to get a discount on the meal. He said thank you but didn't really offer an apology. This is a relatively new restaurant, I don't remember ever having 2 chipped plates/glasses even at the lowliest chain restaurant. That really made what should have been a \"world class\" experience, a \"meh\" event. Giada you should be looking at the plates and glasses, not just the plating."

We came for lunch and the natural lighting from the panoramic windows truly kept the place bright. It was a two hour wait for a table by the window so we sat at the bar. Which is perfect because we really are bar people. \n\nNow the ONLY reason Im giving a 4 star review instead of a 5 Star is for the service. The bartenders couldnt have been bothered any less then to help us out. We sat at the bar for 10 minutes before we could even be greeted. When we finally were I ordered a Ciroc and Soda and the guy didnt even know what Ciroc was.. Now i would understand if I ordered something completely off the wall but I mean come on... thats pretty standard. Andy ordered a coffee and the bartender spatted off a list of different cappuccinos they had its like no dude, just a regular coffee lol The other bartender Nicole was also kind of a nightmare. She was giving away drinks left and right to the folks sitting next to us so maybe she knew them? \n\nBut when that was over we started ordering a few dishes. We had the Pasta Fazoli soup which was pretty good, not the best but certainly not the worst. We also had the marinated olives, also not the best. BUT then we tried the Chicken Marsala meatballs and those were phenom. 5 bite sized meatballs with roasted wiled mushrooms. wow. they seriously melted in your mouth. so good! then we had the Salumi Picante Pizza. This is probably one of the best food items Ive ever had in a restaurant. spicy dry sausage, san marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella, and oregano. But let me just talk about the crust for a second... That pizza dough could cure cancer. I mean seriously it was AMAZING. \nFor dessert we had the zeppoli. Now im a huge fan of this dessert, its always been my go-to while at an Italian restaurant but this one was made like Ive never had before. It wasnt sweet, like Ive normally had. And it had lemon zest sprinkled all over. Im going to have to try it again to see if i really liked it because oddly enough Im kind of unsure. \n\nThis was a great place and we will def be back, but we will make a reservation for a table next time and hopefully receive better service."

We both like Giada, and we walked in expecting a homey feel and huge portions of pasta like her television show conveys. It was a bit of a let down overall. All of the hostesses were nice and personable, but it was surprising to see them in the shortest dresses I've seen in a decent resturaunt. We actually saw one couple leave because the wife caught her husband staring one too many times :) We didn't have a reservation so we sat in the lounge area, which was nice but it again just conveyed a typical vegas restauraunt. As for the food, it was good but overpriced, and certainly not very italian. The oysters Rockefeller were $18 for four small bites, and the spaghetti was $34 for a child's portion of dry spaghetti with very little sauce. All in all, if you like Giada look up her recipes, make them at home, and invite your family over for a Giada experience and go to Casa di Amore for good italian food."

She has exceeded my expectations in every way. The staff is welcoming, the place is spacious yet warm, and the service is efficient yet  unpretentious. You can really see that she paid attention to every detail, down to the shapes of the bar ware. And the FOOD - OUTSTANDING! The four of us ordered one of their mixed mushroom pizzette, their medium assorted antipasto platter, the lobster arancini, and the braciole, and then we each ordered a different pasta. I had the vegetable Bolognese rigatoni, the others ordered the lobster ravioli, signature lemon spaghetti with shrimp and the scallop and asparagus risotto. Every dish was so delicious that we made a reservation for the next night before we even got through dinner. Which brings us to the dessert cart. And another OMG. The dessert portions are small, which allows you to sample several of them. We tried the white coffee gelato, the mascarpone cheesecake and the chocolate amaretti bars.  In fact, the portion sizes in general are reasonable rather than overkill, so you don't leave feeling overstuffed or like you wasted half of your meal by leaving it behind.\n\nIn summary, if you can get a reservation, run, do. Run, do not walk,  to Giada for one of the best meals you will ever eat."

They are avid fan and with all the great places to eat in Vegas, it had special meaning to experience it for them.  \nWhile I only had time to enjoy a mixed appetizer plate and dessert, I found both to be exquisitely presented in a wonderfully enjoyable and comfortable atmosphere which certainly captured California casual with an elegant Italian experience.\nThe bacon wrapped dates were incredible, all of the food was amazingly tasteful and light while certainly satisfying.  We also tried 4 of the deserts, each wonderful and I dont think we could have gone wrong with any of the choices.\nI would like to add that while Giadas entire experience was enjoyable, there are plenty of wonderful restaurants happy to take your money.  What was truly as notable as the food however were the people and especially, the Manager, Avi.  Even as busy as this newly opened place is, he made it his personal mission to great every guest and sincerely wanted to insure we had a wonderful experience, even though we werent really \"officially\" there for the entire course.  A final thank you also to Avi in that after I had explained the details of our visit and evening, he personally insured I had a great story, and more, to share with my daughters.

Whatever, I still have Yelp and Instagram and nothing could block me from dining at Giada!\n\nUpon stepping off the escalator to enter Giada on the 2nd floor of The Cromwell, we arrived at their impressive hostess station and were immediately taken to our table in the main dining room. This area overlooks The Strip (primarily Caesars) and includes exceptional views of the Bellagio Fountains when seated by the windows near the terrace (request it when making your rezzy). \n\nThe interior is accentuated by the natural lighting from outside. We gazed at all the stylish decor, which is reflective of the beauty and elegance of Giada herself. The abundance of whites reminded me a bit of Fig & Olive (in LA & OC) but Giada enhances it with classy touches of gold and silver. Menus, napkins, and placemats are adorned with signature Giada and \"G\" logos. Despite the swank setting, some patrons were dressed more casually than I expected at dinner, as a few even wore shorts and sandals (on the bright side, at least they weren't dressed in any of that ridiculous EDC attire). \n\nWhile we were smitten with the location of our table and views, there is also an attractive lounge and bar area that is more laid back. Near that, an open kitchen section resides before the restrooms, closer to the entrance. Don't forget to check out that display and of course, drop in the photo booth by the hostess station on your way out.\n\nAs enthralled with the environment as we were, it was time to add some accessories to our table, in the form of food and drinks!\n\nMENU: Italian with Californian influences and a strong presence of citrus. Many dishes are intended to be light. Dinner options are much more expansive than their lunch menu. Our party of 2 shared the following:\n\nDRINKS: they give you an iPad to browse the cocktail menu. All names are inspired by movies Giada's Grandfather produced.\n*Barbarella: this was made up of orange spice ginger beer, Tanqueray No. TEN, fresh lemon & basil foam, and is wonderful for mule lovers! I drank it way too fast and found myself craving another one even the next night.\n*Riesling: wine (for her), sweet and distinguished.\n\nANTIPASTI: they ranged in size. I'd recommend mixing it up by selecting from the different sections like we did. They also served a complimentary bread platter comprised of rosemary focaccia bread, Italian breadsticks, and Parmesan crisps (crackers), rounded out by trays of chili flakes, pesto, crispy fried capers, and marscapone butter. The bread was fluffy and we enjoyed the seasonings.\n*CHEESE: Imported Burrata w/ balsamic salt - creamy and perfect to put on the aforementioned bread and/or crisps.\n*SALUMI: Prosciutto di Parma - buttery, salty & sweet, pork.\n*MEAT: Orzo Meatballs w/ parmesan pomodoro - cute little balls (about 5 or 6) that I couldn't wait to grab. They were moist and tender.\n*SEAFOOD: Charred Octopus w/ potato, fennel & olive salsa - perhaps I wasn't in the mood for something charred, as I was more pleased with the other items we had.\n\nPASTA & MAINS\n*SPAGHETTI: shrimp, lemon & basil - absolutely delicious, I almost wish we had ordered 2 servings.\n*BRANZINO: fish with tangerine vinaigrette - this was an amazing dish cooked brilliantly that practically melted in my mouth. I didn't expect to be wowed by this but it was an extremely satisfying \"main.\"\n\nDESSERT: the menu differed from that posted online as they didn't have my zeppoles! \n*LIME & PISTACHIO CAKE: Giada's twist on a Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s dessert, with a fascinating presentation. Includes raspberry sorbetto and some fresh fruit.\n\nSERVICE: matching the quality of the food and setting, they didn't miss a thing. Our server was Joseph, who provided solid recommendations and was personable and helpful throughout our meal. Water refills were consistent. The girls working as hostesses were outfitted in really hot black dresses too (if you need help convincing your guy to take you here, just show him this part of the review only).\n\nGiada gave me a memorable night. I look forward to trying breakfast or lunch on my next visit, and in the meantime, will try to figure out how to remove that Parental Control channel block so I can watch her show!"

I've had better.\n\nAll orders came with fresh bread along with dipping sauces.\n\nLocated inside The Cromwell (a lovely hotel btw), it offers breakfast, lunch and dinner.  \n\n I'm sure there are better Italian restaurants but I guess if your a fan of Giadia then its a destination on your list."

            "review": "When approaching Giada's, you are rewarded with the smokey aroma of wood burning ovens. This inviting scent rescues you from the abrasive air freshener emanating from the adjoining casino. With a large bank of glass, guests can explore one of the best views in Las Vegas. The scene is fresh, contemporary, and pleasant. The guests range from individuals yearning for a connection to the famous lady, to people ordering endless mimosas...and nothing else...for hours. One can guess how those diners add to the experience. Anyway, let us talk about food. Overall the small plates are classic Giada: simple, fresh, high quality ingredients paired in masterful ways. The ricotta, honey, and pink pepper crostini are superb. Blue cheese filled and bacon wrapped dates are small packets of explosive flavor. Sadly, my dinner lemon spaghetti (Giada signature) delivered moderate flavor and overcooked prawns. The brunch lobster hash served Italian sausage as the kitchen was out of the dish-defining ingredient. The resulting entree could be obtained in any eatery, on any corner. The best element of brunch involved an extraordinary Pecorino Tartufo with apricot preserve. These were two extraordinary and flavorful ingredients simply served. When it came to an item being cooked in the restaurant, the quality lessened. Thankfully, I was able to purchase signed copies of cookbooks. As someone who uses Giada's recipes almost daily, I look forward to exploring her creations based out of my kitchen instead of the one in Las Vegas. As a member of the culinary community, I am rooting for the eatery and wishing all the best. Side note: the mixed cocktails are outstanding here. In my opinion, the best Vegas has to offer: creative, fresh, delicious."

We tried to make dinner reservations for my birthday but their soonest availability was a month later. Don't expect to be seated if you're wearing very casual clothes/ have no reservations. We witnessed a bunch of people getting turned away.\n\n\nThe bread service was pretty good. The interior is very beautiful, modern, sophisticated but still comfy. We were given a tour of the restaurant. Our server was fantastic and the manager checked on us.\n\nThe menu items all seemed delicious. They have a dolce cart: chocolate, cherry, sorbeti, gelati, cookies, berries, eclairs, tart, etc.\n\nOrzo Meatballs:\nVery tender and juicy beef balls with orzo in pomodoro topped with grated Parmesan. I didn't want to share and I'll definitely get this again when I return. 5/5\n\nChicken Cacciatore:\nFor 2 people. They'll show you your pan-roasted chicken with veggies before they bring it back to the kitchen to fry the chicken. The chicken is crisp but not oily, bursting with flavor, tender and juicy. I've had cacciatore from other places and Giada has the best I've had so far. 5/5\n\nLemon Potatoes:\nSmashed and fried potatoes with lemon and grated Parmesan cheese. This was a good side dish for the chicken cacciatore. 4/5\n\nSpaghetti:\nLemon, basil, shrimp and capers. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was creamy but not heavy. However, my large pieces of shrimp were a bit overcooked. Otherwise, this would have been perfect. Flavor profile was superb. 3.5/5\n\nChocolate Tiramisu:\nTopped with candied hazelnuts and gold leaf. Creamy, light, airy and mildly sweet. 4/5\n\nBlueberry Eclairs:\nThe eclair itself was wonderfully flaky and blueberry filling just oozes out. The top has glaze and fresh blueberries . 4/5\n\nChocolate Amaretti:\nA chocolate cake covered in dark chocolate topped with good leaf. You can definitely taste the amaretto. 4.5/5\n\nOverall, I was very satisfied with what we had and the service. I'll come back and try a few more dishes...or even get the spaghetti and maybe ask if they could not cook the shrimps too much. \n\nThey're currently open for lunch and dinner. They'll be open for breakfast October 2014 and weekend brunch beginning of next year. Something to look forward to."

The restaurant itself is picture perfect inside the stylish new Cromwell. The dining room is washed in white and curves out towards Las Vegas Boulevard with windows that open up so you can watch the Bellagio fountains - if you're seated in the right direction. We went on my birthday which was a Tuesday and I was SO excited. As we ascended the escalator we were greeted by the hostess who quickly dampened my excitement. We had reservations but still had to wait about 15 minutes at the bar which was probably good because the bartenders were actually the friendliest people in the entire restaurant.\n\nAlmost as soon as we sat down in this gorgeous, not cheap, restaurant, our extraordinarily unfriendly server tried to upsell us on some tacky package that came with an autographed picture of Giada. I've eaten at a number of \"celebrity chef\" restaurants and have never experienced a similar upsell. It felt very tacky and kind of ruined the vibe of the nice restaurant. This isn't Disneyland, this is a fine dining restaurant! \n\nIn addition to cocktails, we started with the Charred Octopus and it was delicious. It wasn't too scrawny and was very flavorful - I would highly recommend it. For my main entree I got the Risotto. The risotto came with two scallops and had two asparagus spears woven through it. The dish itself was delicious but at $35, a bit pricey for the portion. We also had some unmemorable sides. I do remember the bread basket being pretty top notch, though. Our waiter was rarely seen and when he was, he wasn't particularly pleasant. \n\nAs I mentioned before, it was my birthday and while I'm not a huge birthday person and definitely hate people singing to me in public, I found it very odd that no one even so much as mentioned it when we'd indicated that it was a birthday celebration in our reservation. In my experience most fine dining restaurants would at least say something... I don't know, maybe it was an off night but I doubt we will be back anytime soon."

Place definitely lived up to the hype and beyond my expectation.\n\nIt's located on 2nd floor of Cromwell Hotel/Casino. From the lobby, take escalators on the right which will take you directly to the restaurant. We had reservation for party of 4 and didn't have to wait very long. There's a cozy seating lounge next to guest check-in. Make sure to check out the photo booth on the left. We were seated right by the windows overlooking the Las Vegas strip. The view of Bellagio fountains at night is breathtaking. Perfect place to take a date for intimate night of dining or any special occasion. Restaurant is elegant and beautiful just like you would expect from the famous owner.\n\nMenu looked very intimidating and we were clueless on what to order. Thank goodness for yelp photos on guidance. Food is somewhat pricey, but worth it. Expect to shell out $75-$100 per person. Glass of wine range from $13-$18 and cheapest bottle of wine was $75. Since it was my birthday, it was skies the limit...of course I offered to pay a portion of the bill from my recent winnings at the casino tables.\n\nWe started off with mushroom arancini (fried meat ball served with pesto aioli sauce) and spinach & buffalo ricotta pizzette for appetizers. We weren't a big fan of mushroom aracini, but we did enjoy the pizzette which was yummy. Complimentary bread was provided too. It was divine!\n\nFor the food, we ordered the following:\n\nTuscan Tomahawk Rib Eye Steak - My personal favorite and all for me. It was humongous and attracted a lot of oohs and aahs from my table. Perfectly cooked medium, very well seasoned and was outstanding. Worth $83 price tag. It doesn't come with any sides so I ordered it with roasted broccolini which paired nicely with the steak.\n\nLobster ravioli - lusciously good and ravioli melts in your mouth. The lobster sauce rocks this dish.\n\nSeared salmon vegetable succotash & whole grain mustard - light crisp on top, tender and delicious. \n\nFettuccine di Amalfi with lemon pork ragu - scrumptious and ragu was on point.\n\nWe were full and passed on dessert. However, I did get some complimentary cookies for my birthday which were delicious. Sorry no pics...lets just say it was devoured instantly before I can get camera out.\n\nAll in all, it was a night to remember. I got the opportunity to sample everyone's dishes and all were terrific. Service was good too. The staff was very attentive, helpful and we didn't feel hurried. With exception to the steak, portions were smaller but perfect unless you wanted to take home. Great choice and definitely recommend to anyone who enjoy good Italian food."

I've always wanted to try this place out.  \nInside the Cromwell hotel (where Drais is located) we went up on the escalators and there was the hostess station at the end of the escalator. \nWe were invited to go to the bar and have a drink while waiting for our table.  That's exactly what we did.  Their menu of cocktails was on the ipad.  We just ended up getting our usuals.  Our hostess finally seated us.  \nWe were approached by Cliff, our fantastic waiter! He was very accommodating and friendly.  He made us feel warm and welcomed.  Very personable.  His Hawaiian accent is great also! He took care of us.  So 5 STARS for CLIFF!\n\nAs for food, I'll rank it 3.  The plates are small.  I ordered the lobster ravioli.  Which was a bit too lemony for my taste.  My bf ordered the risotto and scallops.  That dish was much better than mine.  Bread plate came out first,  I really liked the freshly baked bread on the bread plate that we got served.\nThe resto itself was pretty pricey.  It's nice to try new things.  Sadly, I don't think i'll come back\n\nOverall, I had a good experience with this place. ambiance, excellent service and the PHOTOBOOTH! That by far was my favorite part in the whole experience!\n\nThanks again Cliff! YOU ARE AMAZING!"

It is very relaxed and easy on the eyes. If anything, the setting immediately draws your attention to food as there is a huge brick oven and chefs are preparing plates. \nThe menu they offer is small, but this is so time is dedicated to your food.\nI always get the Parmigiana-Reggiano cheese with wild sage honey as an appetizer. For my meal, I chose the Lasagna with eggplant and sausage. It was served with an arugula salad. I really felt like I was sitting at home eating comfort food when I dived into this dish. The flavors only complimented each other and not one thing was competing.\nEach time I eat here, I am amazed at how well the food is prepared and have not been disappointed with any of my choices. \n\nIf you're into non-alcoholic beverages, Dolce Vita is a fantastic drink served with a sprig of rosemary. Don't worry about the Rosemary overpowering the drink, in fact the scent only seems to add to the drink of fresh orange, peach pur\u00e9e, blood orange syrup, elderflower tonic, and club soda.\nI'm a fan of her signature cocktail \"G\": G\nKappa Pisco, pineapple simple syrup, fresh lime, homemade apricot preserves, egg white & Angostura bitters.\n\nBut honestly, the lemon ricotta cookies are my favorite here. If I only ever wanted one dessert in my life, it would be those cookies. They come on an assorted cookie plate, but I always ask for just them and they accommodate my request. \n\nPlan to spend time here because the experience is relaxed and unhurried. You are given time to appreciate your food, which I feel makes it a solid Italian experience."

So it goes without saying that I could not wait to have a meal at her very first restaurant, which just happens to be in one of my favorite cities. Giada opened last spring, and when my husband and I visited Vegas a few months later last June, it was booked solid. So we tried again on our recent trip to Vegas in December. Our first attempt was for dinner and there were no openings the entire night. We then decided to give it another shot for lunch and only had a ten minute wait... score! Lunch seems to be the way to go. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very \"Giada\" in every way. It has that California cool vibe, but in a classy way. When you first walk in, you see a display case of all the fresh foods and ingredients before walking past the open kitchen. The large panoramic windows offer a stunning view of the strip in every direction.\n\nThe lunch menu seems a bit limited... several cheese, meat, or veggie antipasto plates, a handful of pastas, flatbread pizzas, and sandwiches. I was hoping to try the lemon spaghetti, but it's unfortunately served at dinner only. Our sever informed us that bread was only brought to the table if antipasto is ordered. So we started with the parmigiano reggiano served with a bit of honey that was actually still on a piece of honeycomb. It was good, but a mess to eat since you had to crumble the hard cheese yourself using a fork. My husband was covered in cheese by the time we were finished preparing it... it's a good thing parmigiano is his color. The bread is four very small pieces of flatbread that come with a pesto dipping sauce. I actually preferred the pesto to the cheese and honey. I found it ridiculous that they force customers to buy an overpriced antipasto plate just to receive the few bites of bread.\n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese and my husband had the lasagna upon recommendation of our server who described it as a \"traditional meat and cheese\" lasagna. My sandwich was very tasty... like a grown up version of grilled cheese. My husband's lasagna was not the traditional version he was expecting being that it had more diced eggplant mixed in rather than meat, but he enjoyed it nonetheless. Both entrees came with a choice of arugula salad with a light olive oil dressing or crispy zucchini strings. The zucchini strings were very light and flavorful.\n\nService was slow, but we were told their system was down and that was causing the backup. Our server was friendly though and our glasses of iced tea stayed full. We were in no rush and simply enjoyed the down time.\n\nNow that I have finally tried Giada's restaurant, I feel like it has been a check off my bucket list, but I wouldn't be in a huge hurry to return. Was it good? Absolutely. However, it was overpriced for the smaller portions served and I can think of a few other true traditional Italian restaurants that I'd rather visit when in town instead of this version described as Italian with a California twist."

Waited 10 minutes to be seated with the rest of our party that was already seated but the hostess ladies mostly ignored us so we just walked in and found our table ourselves.  Our waiter who I wish I could remember his name was fantastic and friendly. \n\nWe were a party of 6 so we were told our party had to be seated in a room in the back with four other large round tables.  This didn't give us the ambiance we desired but the boys were happy with the laker game.  No table cloths were on the tables which wobbled our glasses around and the wood kept snagging the sequins off my now ruined dress. I was stuck in between the seam of two wood pieces. \n\nI started with the Giada signature cocktail. It had a floral taste that I did not enjoy. We then munched on a platter of Salumi and cheeses which were awesome and the kids ordered a pizette with spinach.\n\nNext my group ordered and I tasted the Pappardelle, Rack of lamb, Braised short rib, Bucatini, Salmon and  the clear winner was the simple but delicious house made spaghetti with gigantic lemon basil shrimp.  The salmon was the biggest disappointment. I'm going to compare fish cooked at Mamas Fish House on Maui to this salmon. Mamas is always moist and delicious. The salmon was dry, thin and not flavorful. If we're paying $40-50 for each portion of food I want to at least walk away saying \"Wow that's a great bite\".  The waiter was fabulous by recommending the spaghetti that he said was the best seller and it was fantastic.\n\nI do recommend to try the pasta dishes here and avoid the mains. The rest of the meat dishes were just okay but the pasta dishes were the best.\n\nFor dessert it was a toasted banana gelato that stole the show over her favorite cookies, tiramisu which our waiter scrounged in the kitchen for us even though it wasn't on the menu (what a great guy!!!!), and the strawberry sorbet. \n\nI so wanted to fall in love but I walk out with a \"it was just ok\"."

Had I written my Yelp review then, I would've given them 5 stars from the impeccable service, perfectly executed food, and beautiful ambiance.  My friend and I were seated in the main living room and still had a great view of the strip. We ordered the burrata and charred octopus dishes to start, and then I had the branzino while she had the crab and scallop risotto.  I ate every single bite. Our water glasses were never empty and the waitstaff was very attentive. The wine recommendations were spot on.  I left deciding it was new favorite restaurant in Vegas.\n\nI waited to write my review though because my experience with new restaurants is that the consistency isn't always there.  I just went again this past weekend and was appalled at what a completely different experience we had.  In all fairness, I wouldn't say it was horrible and the food was still decent, but relative to the high bar that was set from my first time around, it was a drastic change.  I had no issues with paying $100 per person the first time.  As for the second time, I would've been happier at Maggianos.  \n\nFirst, the wood burning smell was incredibly stifling this time and since the initially tried to see us in the little back room with seemingly no ventilation, it was difficult to bear.  We moved tables, which helped marginally, but it wasn't until they opened the windows later into dinner that it was back to normal.  Second, our waitress was sporadically attentive, disappeared for long intervals, and told me things that I asked for before on my first trip (like plain grilled bread to eat with the burrata) didn't exist.  (When she checked with the kitchen though, it did materialize.) She also cleared our apps without asking if we were done because our entrees were ready.  Third, the food execution......the orzo meatballs were tasty and the burrata again delicious. I did a repeat of the branzino because I loved it so much the first time, but this time it lacked seasoning and was the skin was crispy in parts and soggy in others. My friend got the rack of lamb, which was a pretty tiny portion to begin with, which wouldn't have been an issue if 1/3 of it was big globs of fat.  We didn't even bother with dessert.  \n\nI have no issues with portions sizes and inflated prices on the strip because usually you get what you pay for from a reputable restaurant.  This was a major disappointment.  I may one day try it again, but it'll be for breakfast or lunch if anything."

We had the crispy polenta which was two small medallions with a very tasty tomato sauce. This was too small, two more medallions would have been better. Asparagus were Cooke perfect. \nThee dessert cart is a nice touch. It taunts you all through your meal. The strawberry sorbet was to die for. Chocolate chunk cookies were yummy. This is a nice price point at $6 per treat. \nOverall the place is very nice but the entree prices seem just a bit high."

            "review": "We tried Giada as some friends had gone and enjoyed it. I must say we were very disappointed. First off, the good points: The Service; it was outstanding from start to finish. The bacon wrapped dates were excellent.\nNow the rest: we were a party of 4 and were seated at a large round table meant for 6 so it was difficult to carry on conversation. The music was too loud, the whole restaurant was too loud IMHO and then to top it off, they opened up several of the garage door style windows so we could hear all the traffic noise on Flamingo. They don't have proper blinds and drapes to block out the sun which was setting so 2 people at our table were \"in the spotlight\". It was so bright you couldn't see and when we asked them to close the drapes to block the sun we were told they don't work that way but they are \"aware of the problem\". \nThe wine was very good but like everything else, way overpriced. We live in Vegas and we know the strip places are more expensive but the roasted chicken for 2 with 2 sides (everything is a la carte) came to $74. C'mon....this is chicken....actually it was more the size of a Cornish hen! The asparagus side was tough and stringy and luke warm.\nWith one appetizer, the meal for 2, 2 glasses of wine, tax & tip it was $150 and, in our opinion, definitely NOT worth it. Giada is just another overpriced strip restaurant charging more for the name and location, certainly not the food. We will not go back and will not recommend it to others."

The bar area has quiet an expansive loungey area that spills into the dining room. The actual dining area is intimate and a little bunched together. I just felt that the food was okay and not really worth the price paid. Maybe I hyped it up too much so that I expected a Robuchon-esq dinner. *shrugs*\nMy family of 17 people ended up splitting the tab and it came out to something like $90/pp. This would be a dinner consisting of one entree, lots of antipasta to share, a couple bottles of wine.\nQuick-E tips:\n-The photo booth is right by the escalators. Right when you get off, turn left and you'll see a little door. I totally missed it!\n-It's dimly lit AKA - kind of dark. Sets the mood if you're out on a date I guess!\n-If you plan to order alcoholic bevy with dinner, expect to spend dough people! \n-Antipasti portions are super small. More like teasers. One dish is suited for sharing with maybe a dinner party of 4. I personally enjoyed the complimentary bread plate with spreads the most....\n-Pappardelle was the best bang for your buck IMO. Flavorful pork ragot! My husband ordered and I was so envious.\n-Fregolotto portion was very small and I also felt the sauce wasn't salted. Even with the starters and bread, I finished my main dish and still felt a tinge of hunger. This is coming from a pregnant person who would normally get full off a small portion! To those that don't know exactly what it is, the pasta kind of looks like large pearl like cous cous. \n-If you're one of those Rib Eye fanatics, you might love or hate Giada's ribeye. It's a Tomohawk. A couple people ordered it and said that there was more fat than meat. I tasted a well done piece and thought it was nothing special.\n-Roasted Fennel side was really disappointing. I took a couple small bites and gave the rest to my husband. It did nothing for me taste wise because it felt very plain. \n-Whole Roasted Chicken looked delicious, but I didn't steal a piece. DARN! Wanted to see how it stacked up to Thomas Keller's version."

Don't worry the only one that made my mother in law feel special was our waiter.\nAt the end of an extremely overpriced 80th birthday lunch they could have redeemed themselves making it a special event if they had served my mother in law a complimentary surprise desert but they did nothing.\nIf this is going to be a gourmet Italian restaurant they need to work on the \"Giada's experience\" which fell off a cliff once they seat you. There should be a small surprise  first course brought to the table, such as a special soup, a tiny but flavorful horsduvre, etc., and something for the person celebrating their birthday, promotion, wedding, etc at the end. The Italian version of a ritz cracker didn't impress as a bread substitute. \nGiada's doesn't go the extra mile to justify the premium prices and there are dozens of Italian restaurants with equal or better food at half the price and double the \"experience\".  \nI could not bring a customer here..."

The food lacks flavor, and tries to be original, but fails. We spent over $100 on appetizers alone. All of which were bland, simply, boring, and completely lackluster.  My husband spent $70 on a bone in steak that was over cooked and each bite took him five minutes to chew. I was going over the Heimlich maneuver in my head because I was convinced he was going to choke at every swallow.  After eating there I read the New York Times review, and it was totally right on. This place screamed Giada and every glance, but made her look like someone who is completely over her head when it comes to the restaurant industry. She needs to stick to what she knows and leave the business of serving food to the masses to the professionals. Clearly she isn't one."

I've been a fan of Giada for so many years.\nUnfortunately,  I arrived at the restaurant on November 24th, 2015 at 9:00 pm.\nThe front desk greets you with the same inerest and formality as any Denny's restaurant. Their dressed as if they are going clubbing after work. Anyway, I decided to ignore those big detaills that really threw me off. I mean, that is a $$$$ reaturant, a glass of wine will cost you $14. The minimum you are expecting of a restaurant like that is the best service ever.\nThe hostess sat us down and told us that Diego was going to be our server. Diego arrived at our  table 5 minutes after the hostess sat us down, and started speaking with a very thick Italian accent. He welcomed us with a very unfriendly face and asked us if we wanted any drinks without even bringing any menus or offering the types of drinks available. He proceeded to bring the menus and leave without even explaining the menus or dishes available. Again, same service as Denny's. He came back with water, started pouring it, but my husband's glass was out of his reach from where he was standing at. He started asking my husband with some face signals to pass him the glass to pour water, but my husband really didn't understand what he was saying so he reached for the wine glass and Diego said, no no, the glass for water. (Not even a please). I know for sure that if your server, specially at a high class restaurant needs to pour drinks, he must find the way to reach from your right hand side. \nWell, we decided to let that My daughter asked him if they had a menus for drinks besides the wine menu, and he proceeded to grab a tablet and shovel it to our faces to show us the drinks instead of taking the time to give us the list of drinks available. That's exactly the same way I order my drinks at Applebee's. To top home it up, I will never forget Diego's most memorable lines:\n'If you are going to order dri is, please make it at once so I don't have to go bankrupt and forth'.\nI truly hope tha line says it all about the restaurant..."

What a great surprise and the food was amazingly delicious. \nI started with the mozzarella with citrus chili pesto. I never had mozzarella cheese served this way, typically served caprese style this was a nice twist, but considering the price $11 seems quite pricy considering the size of of the appetizer portion. I will say also, that while good, the taste of the mozzarella did not come close to the taste in Italy. \nWhile I was not up to eating a full five course meal that night, I opted to have the pappardelle with pork bolognese. The pasta was made fresh, you could tell. The flavor of the sauce was very good and while at first the portion size seemed small especially for $32, I must say it was the right amount.\nFor dessert I opted for the limoncello souffl\u00e9 which was out of this world good. If you find yourself at Giadia's, do not miss this gem of a dessert. It is well worth the $14 and time it takes to make fresh. \nLet me also say the service was very good too. Our waiter Rocco was from Southern Italy and he was very attentive and went the extra mile to make sure that every aspect of our dining experience was perfect.\nI think the fact that price vs. portion size is what was the disappointing factor in the overall experience, considering the uniqueness of food parings and quality of ingredients and knowing the restaurant is in the heart of the Vega$ strip in a high rent district - I get it. $122 = modest dinner for two without alcoholic beverages."

However, I had heard great things about Giada from friends and family.  \nThe atmosphere was awful and colored my whole entire meal.  Firstly, it was *hot*.  We visited in March and had on blouses and pants.  Nothing very heavy.  And we were both sweating for most of the meal.  I think the windows were open, but in the back part of the restaurant it was hot, with no cool air.\nSitting down you are overwhelmed by the table setting.  So much on the table!  Nearly everyone managed to knock over the bread knife balanced on edge when they sat down.  It makes a big clatter.  Then the waiter shows up with multiple menus, an iPad, a cheesy \"tasting\" menu you enticed to order so you can have an autographed photograph of Giada.  I had approximately 5 different things to look at.  And no room to put them anywhere on the table.  Some of the menus were redundant.  But I had no idea which one was the actual menu and had to ask.\nThe food was, meh. The bread was the highlight.  We had stuffed dates, grilled baby peppers and a nice lemony salad that was dressed perfectly.  All of these were tasty, but nothing special.  We had lobster ravioli which was bad.  The pasta was mushy and a little gooey without much filling.  It was placed over large chunks of greens, which were impossible to eat with the gooey pasta.  I was shocked the pasta would be so awful.\nBut the timing of the food was awful.  Almost 1 minute after ordering, food started coming out and being shoved onto our very tiny, overdressed table.  Oftentimes, the waiter would stand awkwardly with the plate while we tried to move stuff around to make room to squeeze it in.  I think we had 3 plates brought out within 5 minutes of ordering.  I had to have them hold the salad because, well, there was no room and we were still working on the first two plates.\nI will not return."

They also did not say a word to us when we walked out which after such amazing service by the entire wait staff was really disappointing. Overall, I would definitely recommend it!"

Yeah. I don't know. \nThe bartender was okay, but rushed & short. I ordered the Giada cocktail ($15) which was good but a little sweet. My husband ordered a whiskey they were out of so he had to substitute. \n\nWe were finally seated about 15-20 minutes after our reservation time. It took a good 5 minutes before the waiter arrived at our table, another 3-4 minutes for water & then who knows how long it took for him to take our order.\n\nWe were given complimentary bread & accompaniments - which in my opinion was the best part of the meal. \n\nHere's the low down:\n\nBacon wrapped dates - they were okay, but I have had better.\n\nArtichoke arancini - Flavorless. The best part about the dish was the gravy they served with it. \n\nWhite lasagna - NO. NO, I am not exactly sure what spice (possibly cloves) they put in this dish but it was soooooo overpowering it made my tongue and lips numb. ABSOLUTELY the worst bite of food I have ever had! \n\nSorry Giada, we won't be back. Service was slow and the food did not meet the standards."

I had the small appetizer platter with the bacon wrapped dates, tenderloin crostini, and stuffed sweet peppers- they were just Ok. Expected a lot more flavor.  The bread plate was Delicious!  Loved the lemon butter, fried capers, pink salt, basil oil and red pepper flakes with mini fresh baked bread in crocks  - probably the best bread serving ever!  Then I had the Lemon spaghetti with shrimp.  I choose it because it was seen like a lighter fare.  It was tasty, but it was under seasoned for me and the shrimp was over cooked.  I would order it again - once I had tried other items!"

The restaurant is beautifully decorated along with the panorama views of LV Blvd. Now that's the good....the rest of the dining experience went downhill very quickly. The bartender was clearly overwhelmed and most likely needed some help.  Menu's were presented promptly and took our drink order (just ok ice tea).  \nWe ordered the mulfetta and Giada hamburger which comes with thin zucchini fries. \nThe really bad - we waited and waited over 45 minutes for the order to arrive. The bartender told us several times it was coming soon and the kitchen was backed up because of a large group - I didn't see the group in the restaurant but perhaps it was an imaginary group?\n\nOrder finally arrived and the burger was dry along with cold zucchini fries. The mulfetta was nothing close to what you might get in New Orleans. The bread was not fresh, seasoning was lacking (come on - where's the olive spread and crushed garlic). Size was half a sandwich along with, you guessed it, cold zucchini fries. \n\nThe meal was mercifully coming to an end and finally paid for the bill. He did not charge us for the ice teas but if they had someone really managing the place, they would have not charged us at all. By the way, everyone at the bar (packed to capacity) had the same complaints. \nThe ultimate insult on the way out was seeing the piled high pre-made. mulfetta's stacked behind the counter!\n\nMaybe Giada should spend some time in her 'named' restaurant or perhaps find some competent managers. Would expect much more in one of her establishments. I also see quite a few other reviews complaining on service and rather pedestrian food. Lots of fine dining establishments in LV - but not here."

First-off, since the closure of Rosemarys Restaurant, we've been trying to find a decent gourmet eatery for special events, and while many fell short, and only a handful were contenders, Giada has become our go-to place. I have yet to try breakfast at Giada, but that's on my to-do list. Lunch is great (Lobster Roll, Grilled cheese with Prosicutto and Fried Zucchini Strings are yummy) but the service is noticably spotty, but not bad. Dinner service, however, is absolutely impeccable. Giada is worth the long wait for a dinner reservation, and worth waiting another 15-20 minutes for a window seat (if available, just ask at the reception podium) which overlooks the bustling intersection of Flamingo and The Strip - plus you get a great perspective of Bellagio's fountains!  While you wait, go to the photo booth to post a picture on Facebook or to email yourself. Decor is good with posters of grand-dad Dino's movies, and the bar drinks are named after his well-known ones (Blue Velvet, etc.) Back to the food: dinner menu.... again, absolutely perfect. House bread 'course' is amazing with great condiments, lemon creme fra\u00eeche pink salt, fried capers and a very tasty rosemary cake. If you're a lemon-head like me, this is THE PLACE. Lemon permeates many dishes and sides, such as the creme fra\u00eeche, lemon ricotta served with the side of asparagus, the signature lemon spaghetti and the (OMFG) killer Ricotta Cookies. I'm sure there's lemon elsewhere on the menu and I'll keep my eyes open for my next visit. BTW, Giada does frequent her restaurant - We visited for dinner about a month after opening and she stopped by for a great 5 minute chat where she insisted in giving me a box for my remaining Ricotta Cookie - no hollywood phonyness, just really down-to-earth casually-nice - she even posed for a photo! She took my idea of a \"Dune\" themed bar cocktail with a laugh saying that they aleady have a \"blue\" drink, but would keep it in mind - she's a hoot! Giada is located in The Cromwell - an elegant boutique hotel that complements this great restaurant, and as Giada is the only restaurant on-property, hotel guests can get room service from Giada's menu! Classy Nom! Can't wait for our next reservation!"

I spoke to the adorable hostess and asked her if it was possible to add on 5 more to my reservation for that evening at 9pm, she looked went and retrieved an equally adorable girl who promptly looked at me and said \"you have no reservation for this evening\"  I said I most certainly do I confirmed it last week.. while looking straight down , and in a monotone voice said  I'm sorry you do not.\n     What can we do to fix this problem I asked trying to stay as calm as possible. You can arrive early tonight and perhaps we will have something for you, bit a party of 15 at such a short notice is very difficult. \n     Tell me you are kidding it is not short notice your restaurant lost my reservation for my birthday, \"we do not lose reservations she insisted\"  \n       I turned ,went down the escalator and called Wolfgang Pucks at MGM  who after a total of 30 seconds said. We would love to have you and your guests here. Great good, personal service, in an open atmosphere well clear of all of the CET management issues at the Cromwell. \n    For those of you wondering why I gave it three stars after all of this inconvenience and frustration, I had the lemon spaghetti and a  bag of donuts the day before ."

Amazing how completely packed it was even though walking through The Cromwell was depressingly empty. First impression was this amazing panoramic view of the strip. I was the first of my group to arrive so found a spot to wait at the bar. My plan was just to order a martini, but I can get that anywhere so I decided to look over the fun specialty drinks. What actually got me was I saw someone else's cocktail with this really cool ice sphere displaying Giada's signature G. So I opted for the Destroyer which had tequila, fresh tangerine and basil. Delish! Lucky for me, the friends I went with have a similar passion for food so we order a lot and everyone shares. That way we get to try a little of everything. Bacon wrapped dates, lemon crab arancini, arugula salad with candied lemon and crispy pancetta and the scallop risotto were all amazing. We also ordered the 28 oz bone in rib-eye finished with lemon and topped with a sunny side up egg which I was really disappointed with. Although the presentation of it was impressive, it was over cooked and a bit on the tough side. Unfortunate especially since that is supposed to be one of the signature dishes."

Our bread came out and I loved the butter mixed with mascarpone cheese and also the pesto. Our server was foreign and at first I thought he was a little rude but he turned out to be great! The boyfriend had the orzo meatballs which were okay. Then for our entree I had the Lemon spaghetti with prawns and the lobster ravioli. Let me just say that the lemon spaghetti was beyond amazing. So simple yet so delicious. I cannot stop thinking about it. The ravioli was really buttery and had a hint of lemon which was really good as well. Even tho the portions were small I got full and had to take half of the ravioli to go. My boyfriend order the surf n turf. The steak was nicely cooked and he loved the prawns. Only thing he did not like was some pasta that was on his plate that was really salty and had a weird flavored to it. Anyways it was dessert time. I had a nutella latte, paired with Giadas famous Lemon Ricotta cookies and her chocolate chip one. Ugh they were so good! At first I was really scare because of all the mix reviews on yelp to try this place but I am glad I had a great experience. I feel sorry for all those who did not. And yes the price was a little higher but you are paying for the whole experience not just the food, keep that in mind."

When we checked in, the hostess at the counter wasn't especially helpful and mentioned that they were running 20 - 25 minutes behind schedule. In their defense, they did bring out complimentary drinks to those waiting, but there wasn't enough seating, and as someone who is 9 months pregnant, it took a LONG time for them to eventually bring out some water. Which was fine (I didn't ask for it, after all), but I thought it a little odd that they weren't more aware of the crowd that was standing around waiting.\n\nWhen we were finally seated, I wasn't overly impressed with the food. The waitress informed us that the kitchen was extremely backed up, but we told her we had a flight to catch and the food came out in a fairly timely manner. The peppers to start were a little too sweet for my taste (it tasted very citrus-y to me), and my dining companion and I did NOT like the sweet ricotta pizza (with pink peppercorns...it tasted like a spicy dessert). That being said, we both really liked the Venetian panino and would order it again.\n\nThe cookies to finish off the meal were delicious. \n\nOverall, I'm disappointed that a manager never made the rounds apologizing for the delay (like most 50-minute delays would warrant) , and that the food wasn't really worth waiting for.

I think I should have been told about that beforehand rather than being given a substitute with no warning.  The sandwich ordered by my dining partner was taken from the deli counter at the front of restaurant which was a shame: you want to feel that your food is made fresh at a restaurant, especially when you're paying $18 for a sandwich! The venue is great though, with a bright open space that's refreshing in Vegas. The only pity was when they opened the expansive windows and the noise of the Strip and the smell of smoke from the Casino below started taking over the ambience."

He was making great suggestions to all of his customers. I started with a cocktail, the Destroyer it was so good but 18 dollars refrained me for getting a second one. For my meal I decided to make two antipasti and a pasta dish. Great choice! I started out with the Vitello Tonato crustini antipasto, it was a fancier version from the rustic original Italian version, but all the flavored were there! Delizioso! Second came the Bacon Wrapped Dates, good but I was still overwhelmed by the crustini I had before. Eric offered me a small splash of Nero D'Avola to pair my dates and enjoy them better, it made a huge difference. Before my entree I had the Oro di Milano beer, nice and full bodied beer, around 8,5 abv. Finally the dish that blew my mind came, the Lobster Ravioli!! Wow, I was speechless when I took the first bite. Everything in that plate balanced perfectly, I could go back tomorrow and eat the same thing again!! \nOverall, great experience!

Reservations for dinner especially on the weekend, can be hard to get unless you book far in advance. I made my December reservation in October. \n\nThe Cromwell doesn't have self-parking that I'm aware of. But the valet was helpful in giving us directions to the restaurant. We got there early and got some gambling in before dinner. \n\nApparently there's a photo booth by the entrance next to the escalators. My friend and I skipped that since neither of us are in to the selfie thing. Anyway, the restaurant is fairly large, and it's busy. I didn't see any tables empty for very long. \n\nSo on to the food. I had the pasta fagioli soup which was better than average, and the bucatini which I really liked. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce had just enough heat. My friend has the scallop risotto that I got a taste of. I thought it was surprisingly light but delish. We were too full for desserts. On a side note, the bread presentation is awesome. There are several different types of bread and a bunch of accoutrements to go with it. My fave was the pesto. \n\nOverall service was spotty, hence only 3 stars. I know the restaurant is still kind of new but waiting 6 minutes just to get your menu is a bit off and it wasn't due to lack of staff. For the price you pay, and the portion sizes, and the service, I wouldn't come back here. The food is above average but not \"wow!\""

I happened to come across a woman cooking Italian food on TV.   She was young, hip, beautiful, and I was just mesermized.  I wanted to know what hair products she used, the name of her polish on her perfectly manicured hands and where she got her unique home wares from.  I was hooked on Everday Italian.  It was 30 minutes of total escape from grad school each week.  When I found the time, I started to cook from her recipes.  They were always a hit at home.  I've been a huge fan since that day.  When I found out Giada was opening a place in Vegas, you can believe my excitement.  So fastforward to Dec. 23, 2014.  I was like a little fan girl about to go to my first One Direction concert.  My Sigoth (significant other) didn't get it but he went along.  But it was excatly like going to a One Direction concert and finding out Zayn was no longer a One Directioner.  Complete and utter disappoinment.  It pains me to even admit it, but I must.  I didn't hate it but I didn't really like it either.  Neither did the Sigoth.  I don't know if I was being hyper-critical because I was eating at Giada's!  I mean these were the select recipes she chose to showcase herself and her brand.  The best thing I had was this signature cocktail, charcuterie and the meatballs.  That's it.  We got a pizza thing that was meh, a couple of pastas (one was the spagetti with the shrimp), it was over salted and terrible.  Just one note, salt.  There was something else we had that we had to send back because it tasted off, don't remember what it was.  I think my experience was a shock to my system so I've blocked off my memory from dining there.  I'm giving one star for the ambiance/decor.  It was beautiful in there, I loved the decor, a lot.  And the second star for the courteous services.  *sigh*"

That being said, I had an amazing night at Giada. ** Not to be confused with Giada's Italian Cucina In Anthem ** (which a lot of out-of-owners seem to be doing)\n\nI made reservations for my GF's birthday and requested a strip view. We arrived and were greeted with free glasses of champagne, which they do for everyone during the Friday dinner service. We were sat promptly, and immediately were taking in the amazing strip view at sunset. Beyond the amazing view outside, the view inside is great as well. I love the layout of the restaurant, which has a sunken dining area so people at the bar can view the strip without obstruction.\n\nWe ordered two glasses of wine off their digital menu and started the food train rolling'. Eggplant Parmigiana Fries with pomodoro & Parmesan fonduta, Mozzarella with citrus chili pesto, Prosciutto di Parma, Fritto Misto shrimp & calamari with shaved fennel & lemon aioli, Rigatoni with vegetable Bolognese, and a chocolate peanut butter tart with a raspberry sauce. The menu was limited, because a pipe had burst in the kitchen earlier in the day and full menu wasn't available. \n\nThe eggplant parmigiana fries were a amazing. Lightly fried, and dusted with Parmesan cheese; these were very light and crispy. They also came with a marinara dipping sauce that was nice addition to the plate, but wasn't needed. A must try. \n\nThe mozzarella balls had great texture with a tiny kick. These paired great with the prosciutto, which we only ordered with the server's recommendation. Thank you David! The prosciutto was so good; very thinly sliced and not too greasy. This stuff melted in your mouth. I could have easily eaten a pound of it. \n\nFritto Misto shrimp & calamari. Wow! This plate was an impulse order and I'm glad we did. The calamari was the perfect amount of saltiness and crunch, plus the added sweet peppers and fennel added freshness to the delicious fried seafood plate. \n\nWe shared the Rigatoni plate, because at this point we had already eaten all of the above along with a bread plate that arrives to the table once you sit down. Still... The Rigatoni was perfectly cooked, still firm, but not spongy. The sauce on this stuff was seasoned perfectly and the chunks of vegetables added great texture to the dish.  I used leftover bread to soak up the remaining sauce. \n\nI'm not a sweets fan, but the chocolate peanut butter tart was very good, but also very rich! If you're a sugar fiend this one's for you. I just had a few bites of this and was good to go. \n\nBeyond the food, the service here was fantastic. Very attentive and very willing to make sure your every need was handled."

Light wood and modern decor are used throughout the restaurant which makes it feels like you're in her home. The plates are pretty with a rose gold G on them.\nA big bread basket comes out with warm focaccia, breadsticks and flatbread.\nWe started off with olives with many different kinda and sizes along with the mini pizzette.\nI loved the size and taste of the pizzette so that you could get a taste and not be too full for the main.\nWe both got the spaghetti that came with huge shrimp.\nEverything was delicious and up to par!"

Everything, and I mean everything, was fabulous!\n\nWe waited a few minutes to be seated for our reservation, which was fine. We took a few shots in the photobooth, conveniently located in the waiting area. When we were seated, the hostess congratulated us on our special occasion, which was a nice touch. Our seats were SPECTACULAR. We had the of the 3 best tables, with a water view. Due to the time that we arrived, we were able to see the strip in daylight, twilight, sunset, and night. \n\nOur server, Laura (maybe Lauren?) was spot-on. She made great recommendations but wasn't pushy at all. She explained the way that service work-- meant to be on the slow, luxurious side. \n\nWe ordered to our heart's content: the burrata (divine, soft, and pillowy) and were given some complimentary breads (bread sticks and Parmesan crisps which were amazing, accompanied by a luscious lemon spread and basil spread). Then we had the marsala chicken meatballs (excellent) and honey-salt fresh ricotta bruchetta (uh-may-zing) to round out the appetizers. We each had a soup,m the ciopinno and yellow tomato (both exquisite). We followed that with the spaghetti with lemon and prawn, and risotto (the best I've ever had, with perfectly seared scallops). We had a teensy bit of room for the surf & turf and saltimbocca entrees that we had ordered. We ended up taking them home and eating them the next day as a meal! We got coffee and tea, and the server brought us an adorable 'congratulations' plate with 2 cookies; lemon, and fudgey chocolate. \n\nI'm not sure why this place doesn't have an overwhelming 5-star rating--it was easily the best meal of our lives. Each dish is prepared with such attention to detail that it's palpable. The food itself is enough to rank this as a top spot, and the service knocks it out of the park. Never once was my water glass empty--it was always refilled quicker than I could mention. All of the service staff is excellent, and it's a joy to eat at such a fine establishment. While a meal might set you back a pretty penny or two, it's worth the investment for a real quality establishment.\n\nFun fact: Look for the \"G\"s on everything. Seriously, she loves her name. That letter is on ev-er-ay-thang."

Dinner: Branzino - seabass - out of this world.  We did ask for Giada's specialty spaghetti for the table.  First batch was a bit sticky.  They quickly made another batch and it was much better.  Came with shrimp that tasted like lobster - really, really good.  Love the portion sizes - not gluttonous 'Merica plates.  Just enough so you aren't starving but you aren't rolling out of there.  And there is room for dessert.  Though, we skipped it this time.   Would go back in a heartbeat."

Head thru the casino and up the escalator were  breakfast is served at the bar from starting at 8:00 am to 9:00  and then the dining room opens up at 9:00 am.\n\nI had a conference call so it was kind of awkward setting up and ordered breakfast at the bar. But my  friendly waitress was very accommodating and helpful. On the way  I  met the head chef and I got to speak with him briefly about the prior Yelp event put on here which looked fabulous. The staff was very accommodating and enabled me to take pics prior before they were open at 8 a.m.\n\nHeart the attention to details here - from the napkins,  plates, condiments to the presentation of entr\u00e9es.  The decor of the  restaurant is stunningly beautiful. \n\nI ordered the Contadina breakfast which included spinach, tomatoes, two eggs over medium, polenta cakes and toast. In addition, much to my surprise - chef of cuisne Bruce M.  brought me over another entr\u00e9e -  eggs & waffles. Everything here tasted so fresh and delicious.\n\nI would  highly suggest making a stop here at Giada's signature debut restaurant, I'll certainly  be returning for lunch or dinner in the future."

We were sat in a back corner near the windows but it was actually nice back there.  More quiet than the main dining space.  The view of the strip is awesome.  You can see the Bellagio fountains right next store.\n\nWe started with drinks.  I just had a basic Ginger Ale but my mom had a Bombay Sapphire and tonic.  I think they make their own ice or get it from some place special as the ice was perfectly square cubes.  Really cool.  My mom's drink was strong so that was good too.\n\nFor our appetizers, I had the Tricolore salad and my mom had the minestrone soup.  My salad was delicious.  Lots of great flavors on it from different lettuces and toppings.  Nice vinaigrette on top.  My mom really enjoyed her soup.  It had a parmesan crisp on top that was her favorite part. \n\nFor our entrees, I had the scallop and crab risotto and my mom had the lemon shrimp spaghetti.  We both enjoyed our entrees.  The scallops were perfectly cooked.  The crab was mixed into the risotto.  My mom thought the shrimp were a bit over-cooked but she liked their flavor.  I would say though that for the prices you pay here, we should have gotten more scallops and shrimp in our entrees.  \n\nPrices are very expensive but Giada is a celebrity chef so you expect it.  I would say portions are a little small for the cost but the food is tasty.  I definitely will be back.\n\nOur waiter and assistants were very attentive and came around often."

The restaurant definitely doesn't disappoint!  I was skeptical at first because I had heard about the pre-launch troubles the restaurant was having (as well as some disappointing professional reviews immediately after launch), but I clearly didn't have to be.\n\nFirst of all, the restaurant itself is visually stunning.  Wow!  It's surrounded by windows yet has a very homey feel to it.  Everything was custom for the restaurant (plates, napkins, etc.).  Great view of the strip.\n\nI ended up ordering the arugula and ricotta pizza with pink peppercorns.  Delicious!  Exactly the right composition.  Cooked to perfection, with each of the ingredients standing on its own without overpowering the others.  The table also shared a cheese plate which started off the meal perfectly.  We didn't end up getting dessert, but I probably will when I make it back here.\n\nWould I come back?  Most definitely!"

However they have a smaller bar area where you can eat and enjoy the restaurant without reservations (only if spots open up). We went and the timing was perfect-seated at the bar within 5 minutes. The atmosphere inside is beautiful-lots of comforting white with great views, even from the bar. \n\nIf you go you MUST order the calamari-it's the best thing on the menu. Perfectly cooked and amazing. The rest of the food was good but not mind blowing. I'd give it 4 stars. The reason for the 5th star is the fact that Giada herself was there, walking around the restaurant (glass of wine in hand). She is tiny and so gracious and even stopped to take pictures with a few people, including our newfound friends from the bar, a Dallas couple with whom we got quite tipsy with (but that's another story).

            "review": "The food tasted okay, but we've definitely had better dining experiences, and for less money. The ambiance was nice and the decor was modern. This restaurant spends a lot of money on iphones and ipads, and having more staff than it needs, but what customers ultimately expect of a Food Network star is that the food be some of the best they have ever had. We felt that our money was mainly spent on the Giada brand.\n\nOn our arrival, we learned that our reservations had been overlooked, so we had to wait at the bar. It wasn't a big deal and this isn't factored into our rating. We did end up with the best seats in the restaurant, where we could watch the Bellagio water fountain show. It was good, but totally accidental on their part, so this also isn't factored into the rating.\n\nThe bar tender was nice, but he seemed deeply disappointed that we didn't order anything. Sorry, we were just waiting for the table, not planning on drinking. We were then escorted to our table.\n\nThe service was very aggressive. I don't know whether it's Americans' insistence on tipping as a percentage of sales rather than a flat tip based on servers' performance, or whether the restaurant trains its staff to be so pushy. But I can't stand it when servers keep trying to get you to order more items in order to get a bigger tip. And Giada's servers do just that -- and I see that other reviewers have mentioned this as well.\n\nThe server kept pushing us to try their cocktails, and after we kept saying \"no thank you,\" she brought us about half-an-ounce of a lemon ginger beverage that was pleasant, and she said it was compliments of Giada. (I am sure Giada had no idea we were even in the restaurant, but okay.) We enjoyed the sip of the drink she gave us until she came back, again asking if we wanted a cocktail. What part of \"NO\" is so difficult to understand? I finally asked her if they had a non-alcoholic menu, to which she replied, \"we might, but I don't know if the bartenders know how to make those drinks.\" All right then stop asking...\n\nNext, she kept pushing us to try the tasting menu. The thing about the menu that really irked me was that it didn't say how much it was. We'd read other reviews that said it was $125 per person, and while we could afford a $250 dinner, spending that much on one meal is, in our view, immoral. So we weren't interested in it. But the server wouldn't take no for an answer. We kept asking about other items on the menu, but she kept coming back to the tasting menu. We don't want to try it -- stop asking!\n\nThe server was annoyed with us because we didn't order cocktails or the tasting menu. \n\nThe food was good, but the portions were very small, even compared to other upscale restaurants. My girlfriend ordered the scallop risotto, which was literally a 4 oz. serving (they measure it). My \"rack of lamb\" interestingly was half the size of racks of lamb I order at other restaurants. Which begs the question: why not call it *half* a rack of lamb? :) We have tiny appetites so it wasn't a problem, but I think most people would be disappointed if they paid $100 for two dinner entrees that small.\n\nMy girlfriend's risotto was underdone, but she really enjoyed it. The rice was still pretty hard and got stuck in my teeth. I ordered my lamb medium well, but received medium rare. I sent it back, and it came back past the point of being well done, and because it was the second time they were grilling it, it had lost most of its flavorful juices. It was well-seasoned, but a little dry.\n\nAfter our dinner, the server then started another round of pressure-selling, this time for dessert. When we said we had no room for dessert, she loudly said \"WHAT? who comes to Giada and doesn't try the dessert?\" Um, well it's a new restaurant, so you haven't had enough customers to establish a trend. Another server heard her and asked what was wrong, and she said \"they don't want to try Giada's dessert,\" to which he shook his head and said \"what a shame.\" I know (or I hope) they were joking, but we didn't like it. The tables are so close to each other so a bunch of other people heard this conversation.\n\nWhen we got the check, there was an iphone attached to it, and when we were looking at their cocktails, their drinks menu was on an ipad. This stuff is nice, but I couldn't help but think that maybe if they cut out some of those expenses and focused a little more on their food and service, the result would be better appreciated by most customers. \n\nUltimately, we thought we were paying a little more for excellent food by a famous chef. Instead, we got food that was only a little better than average, and it came attached to very aggressive service. The extra money we spent goes to the decor, the fancy electronic gadgets, and the Giada brand name, not the food that Giada is famous for."

So I was excited with the idea of going to her restaurant. I did read the yelp reviews and thought to myself that I may have a different experience than the other reviewers who did not rate so well...so I pushed forward with keeping the reservation. \n\nWhen you first walk in, the place looks very impressive. Very open feel and a nice view of the strip. But that's where it stops. The waiter was less than attentive and frankly didn't care whether we were there or not. For the price of the meal we were paying, you expect a certain level of service. \n\nNext, the food. I was less than impressed with the food.  I heard so many wonderful thing about their shrimp spaghetti. I asked the waiter and he agreed. So that is what I ordered. My hubby order the rack of lamb. When our food came, my spaghetti was luke warm, on the verge of getting cold. You can tell it has been sitting out (probably because the lamb was still cooking) because the sauce started to harden and the spaghetti kinda stuck together. Most fine dining places I go to keep the plate really warm that they actually caution you about the hot plate as they are bringing it out. I can tell the flavor is nice, but it just would have been that much better better if it wasn't cold :(\n\nAs for my hubby's lamb, I didn't care for it too much but he liked it.  I think the only thing that was good was the free bread and cracker that came before your meal. \n\nOn top of bad service and bad food, what was the most appalling thing for me was that the plates and bowls were chipped around the edges. I fully expect chipped dishes In a chinese restaurant but I never care because the food is good AND cheap. But at Giada's???!!!  Giada...if you are going to serve my food in a chipped plate and bowl, then you really should charge me chinese restaurant pricing. Sorry...but I sorta lost respect for you. In a city where there are sooooo many good restaurants to compete with, you just could not keep up with the big boys. I really wanted to like the food and restaurant, but have to agree with with all other Yelpers  that it was sub par. Go to any restaurants at Caesars or Bellagio, you will get better food and service."

If someone goes through the trouble of  making a  reservation, treat them like someone who is trying to experience what you are marketing. This includes the view.

The scallop and crab risotto was 2 scallops and about a cup of risotto. You get the idea.  \nDon't get me wrong, for the most part the food tasted very good but it's tapas portions   without the advanced notice that it's a tapas restaurant. \nOh and if you prefer a good craft beer with dinner, forget it you'd be better off drinking water here."

            "review": "Most of the reviews about this place are pretty accurate. The food is amazing. The wait time is a little long. The view, if you can get a window seat, is beautiful. Our waitress was so nice and extremely helpful. \n\nMy husband and I ate here on Christmas day and the place was packed. I doubt you will get in without a reservation. We initially got seated in the back by the bar but we asked the hostess to move us by the window and she did. \n\nThe wait time was a little long but I think it's because the place is crazy busy. It did take us awhile to get some bread. \n\nWe ordered some wine and the mozzarella to start. It was delicious! The appetizer menu is huge so there are a lot of options. My husband ordered the surf and turf and he says it's one of the best things he's ever eaten. I ordered the risotto with the scallops. The risotto was a bit too buttery for me but if you like your risotto creamy and buttery you will like it. The scallops were cooked just right though, seared on the outside but soft when you cut into it. Perfect! The crab inside the risotto was very flavorful but not too overpowering. I would definitely recommend it. \n\nWe would eat here again and I recommend this place but make a reservation! Also, order some appetizers because there are wonderful options and the main dishes are not very big so you will not get stuffed. \n\nEnjoy!"

The rest of meal was mediocre.  Brought to the attention the waitress and the manager but they did not care.  Absolutely horrible.

            "review": "My parents moved to the United States from Rome in 1985, so I was very much looking forward to eating at Giada's new restaurant in Las Vegas. \n\nI enjoyed everything I ate; however, there were several textural issues, and salt issues with my plates. \n\nI began my lunch with the Burrata appetizer. Burrata (from burro, the Italian word for butter) is an extremely creamy cheese that can be pulled apart with a fork, and is often spread on bread. The Burrata was excellent, drizzled with olive oil, and served with a line of salt on the plate. Unfortunately, Giada's house bread is akin to pita bread, it consists of their pizza dough undercooked, and is served with a small ramekin of pesto, which was almost inedibly salty. Burrata really needs to be spread on hearty, crunchy bread otherwise every bite is devoid of any texture but mushiness. \n\nMy second appetizer consisted of baby peppers stuffed with goat cheese. They were delicious; sweet, and creamy. \n\nFor my entree I had the infamous $35 lobster roll. Again, this plate suffered from salt, and textural issues. The lobster roll consisted of one thick piece of Italian bread with a heaping pile of the lobster-centric filling on top. I tasted NO salt in the filling; however, that's an easy fix as you can always add salt. After the addition of some salt it was delicious. The filling was mostly large lumps of succulent lobster with capers, and celery bits; it was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, the dish was not a roll, it had to be eaten with utensils, and would not even qualify as an open faced sandwich as there was significantly more filling than bread. The real problem though was that the Italian bread bottom was soggy because in a matter of seconds it had absorbed the moisture from the lobster filling. Once agin during my meal I was taking spongy bites; this time of soggy bread, and lobster filling. \n\nIn conclusion, the issues I had were minor. However, with NO alcohol my lunch cost around $80 with tip. For this amount of money I do not think that crisp bread is too much to ask for. I would definitely return again for lunch though."

It was a vegetable base and it did not lack the depth or texture of the beef.  The pappardelle was delectable with fresh greens on top to cut the richness of the pork.

I thought there was a lack of spiciness to the Arancini (only to realize when the bill came that they brought the lobster Arancini instead) but they were very good, the Caesar has a citrus based Caesar dressing that was just OK.\n\nShe ordered the spaghetti and shrimp, the shrimp were huge, one was perfect, the other slightly overcooked, the pasta was slightly overcooked as well.  I ordered the Branzino and it was fantastic.  Came with a tangerine vinaigrette that complimented the fish well.  It was taking quite a while for the main course to come after the apps, but our waiter Diego showed with a couple of flutes of champagne to help with the wait.  Nice touch.\n\nDessert was the chocolate tarte which was pretty tasty as well.  Dinner came to $132, pretty pricey when no wine was involved.  $6 for a pepsi?  Come on.

Our waitress cleverly upsold the $30! black truffle garish to supplement the meal which feels like a miss all together. Anyway, we followed suit and waited 30 minutes!!!! for the dish to be warmed up to include the black truffles. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend this to a friend or return.

Bucatini and another which I cannot remember the name of, but both were earthy and the kind of pastas you would want in the dead of winter because you know they will do your soul good.  For my main, I had the salmon, which was cooked perfectly.  Several people at our table had the huge steak, which they enjoyed as well.  Desserts were the limoncello souffl\u00e9, the chocolate tower and the crostata.  As far as drinks go, Giada went above and beyond from the delicious \"Destroyer\" cocktail to how they handled the nicer bottles of wine we brought... Which were decanted and handled with great care.

I was excited to try this place, at first I planned to wait a few months and let all the hype die down, but when my friend scored us a 7p reservation, I changed my mind pretty quickly. \n\nWhen we arrived, we waited way passed our reservation time, only to find out Giada was in the house, so people were staying longer at their tables. As soon as we walked in, she was there taking pics with people on their way out. \n\nWe were started with a tour of the restaurant and the prep area, which was fun to see. Our table could not have been in a better spot. Perfect view of the Strip and the Bellagio Fountains. Greeted immediately by our waiter who gave us a quick rundown of the iPad cocktail menu, we all started out with a signature cocktail.  Something different for everyone, and every single person enjoyed their drinks. I tried the Destroyer, Clase Azul Tequila Reposado, tangerine, orange and basil, basil ice sphere, as well as the La Strada, Campari, homemade lemon sorbeto, Bertagnolli Limoncello, Proseco, and (don't judge) Barbarella, Tanqueray #10, orange spice ginger beer, fresh lemon, basil foam (this was my favorite).  \n\nI was excited to see they offered a tasting menu but to my disappointment, we were informed the way they have their tasting menu set up is a family style, so everyone at the table is required to order the tasting menu. So we went with the original plan of ordering something different for everyone to try. We started our with their amazing bread basket, I was more obsessed with the condiments that it came with, the lemon butter and the dried capers with my favorite. Onto the apps, we couldn't decide so we ordered multiple. The large appetizer platter was big enough for 5 people and it had a little but of everything. I had picked the Oysters Crudo, which were fantastic, the Burrata, amazing, Lobster Arancini, best Arancini I have had. I could have stopped at the apps and been happy. \n\nI originally had planned to get the Lemon Spaghetti, but then I wanted the Branzino, so our waiter told me to order the Branzino and I could have the Spaghetti as a side. Perfect! This dish was executed to perfection. I love Seabass, this had a perfect char on the skin, and the Lemon Spaghetti is as good as everyone says. The shrimp was as big as my palm.  My friends Rack of Lamb was my favorite. I would order this next time. The Ribeye was cooked perfectly too. TONS of sides! Ravioli, Crispy Polenta, Asparagus, and Lemon Potatoes. \n\nNext up, the dessert tray. I was so full by the time this came around, but we still indulged. She has some really unique desserts.\n\nService was excellent, our server was very attentive, as well as everyone else that helped him out.\n\nHighlight of my night, she came around to the table and spoke with us about our meal. She was so personable and nice, upon leaving, I was able to take a picture with her. Totally made my night."

The only thing I was truly worried about was the service expectation. Yelpers have been pretty disappointed with the quality of service they have been receiving when dining. \n\nWe arrived about 15 mins before our reservation time. We decided to take advantage of the infamous photo booth, but to our dismay it would not print or email the pictures. We ended up snapping our pics with our iPhones to. (Wish they would've fixed the booth while we dined.) \n\nWe were seated in the newest extension of the restaurant. Our server for the night was Joseph. He and his assistant were awesome! We opted to try the tasting menu. \n\nThe meal started with the bread platter, which was awesome. The freshly baked foccacia bread was light and fluffy. There were also breadsticks and parmesan crackers. The bread platter was served with pesto oil, chili flakes, australian pink salt, and dried capers for dipping.\n\nFirst Course: Giada's Appetizer Favorites. We were given bacon wrapped dates, stuffed chili peppers, and crostinis. The dates were definitely my favorite. I'm a sucker for bacon wrapped dates.\n\nSecond Course: I opted for the lemon spaghetti, and this is where are awesome server substituted risotto per my husband's request. Both dishes were amazing! The prawns were huge and fresh. Both dishes were full of flavor. I would come back here just for these two dishes.\n\nThird Course: Meat Course: I had the salmon and the husband had the lamb chops. Both were large portions and encrusted with mustard seeds. The lamb chops were cooked medium and very tender. The salmon was nothing special, and seemed like a typical salmon dish.\n\nThis course was also accompanied with the house potatoes and corn.\n\nLastly, Dessert! Bring on the dessert cart. Our kick ass waiter Joseph allowed us to get extra desserts because he was cool like that. Typically, you're allowed to get one dessert per person of your choice off the cart. We had the chocolate amaretto cake, polenta cake, lemon cookie, chocolate chip cookie, and ice cream. The desserts were all to die for. They were not overly rich or too sweet. I have to say tho, the polenta cake was definitely my favorite. The lemon cookie came in second place.\n\nI would definitely come back to eat at Giada's and request Joseph to be our server. He was super friendly and made our evening enjoyable. The best part of the tasting menu is getting a booklet with some of Giada's recipes along with an autographed picture of herself. Giada was in the restaurant that day, but our waiter said she was in the back regulating the line cooks, as orders were being messed up. Hey at least he was honest!\n\nThe main reason I can't give this place 5 stars: It was freaking hot in this place. It was as if the air conditioner wasn't working. The poor waiter had to wear a white blazer and you could see all the beads of sweat on the poor guys forehead."

            "review": "My first trip. Located on second floor of the Cromwell. \n\nTips. This place takes reservations. Most dinner times of 5-9 are a two month out for a reservation. Lunch recently began to be served. Lunch dress code is relaxed and dinner is business casual. Dress code is enforced.\n\nExperience. At arrival we are greeted immediately at the base of stairs to confirm our lunch reservation. Also confirmed and greeted at the front desk. She kindly informs us to wait a few moments to try the photo booth to the left and are escorted to our tables.\n\nOur server Anthony arrived in a timely manner to introduce himself and his help. He was kindly insured we placed a drink order. We were unsure on what to order and he described some of his favorite beverage choices. Giada's Sangria with Brachetto and Fortunella 1958 with Don Julio were the drinks we ordered. Anthony kindly informed us that restaurant was out of Don Juilo and was substituting with Patron. Rare to find a restaurant out of beverage. Without Don Julio I went with my second choice Barbarella 1968 with Tanqueray Ten. Waiter respected and agreed with my opinion and affirmed the second choice was his favorite drink. \n\nDrinks were served and food order was taken without delay. Both drinks I would describe as a good balance with alcohol and freshly matched ingredients. Sangria was crisp and savory. Barbarella similar to a Moscow Mule was harmony of gin, ginger beer, fresh lemon and basil. Drinks ordered were refreshing for the hot temperatures outside of the restaurant. Alcohol was not over powering either. \n\nAnthony made suggestions for the meal. We followed some suggestions and ordered others. We ordered appetizers from the antipasti meat and cheese including Chicken Marsala Meatballs, and Pecorino Tartufo with Apricot Preserves served with fresh made flat bread and dipping sauce. Dipping sauce similar to that of a pesto. Yum. Pairing flat bread with pecorino and apricot spread just magnificent. The components of pecorino worked well on its own and together. Harmony. \n\nMeatballs paired with vine roasted tomatoes in a savory Marsala. Tender soft meatballs. Sauce was flavorful and one of the best I had. Tomatoes lightly toasted to maintain it's integrity. As a whole this was a nice antipasti. Pieces were good on its own but in my opinion lacked a little cohesion for the appetizer. This item is on their dinner menu and I would still order it. \n\nWe ordered from the sandwiches from servers suggestions. Muffuletta sandwich with mortadella, finocchoina, porchetta, prosciutto cotto, and aged provolone. Similar to an Italian salumi trio, was bursting with spice and fair amount of provolone on a fresh rustic bread. Prepared warm from the grill, this is what a  sandwich should be. This sandwich pays true homage to the influences of Giada's family into the restaurant. Sandwich is served with choice of arugula salad or zucchini scapecce. Arugula salad was elected to pair with this. Lightly dressed and topped with parmesan that hit an accord with the sandwich. I couldn't complain if this was the only thing I ordered. Between the muffuletta sandwich and arugula salad I think I could eat all day without feeling guilty.\n\nOther sandwich was the Lobster Roll with lemon basil aioli and fried capers. The roll was by far one of the best deals on the menu. Ten ounces of lobster piled on a roll with the citrus aioli was succulent, creamy, savory, and sweet. Nothing over powering just right and not too aromatic with the lobster and citrus. Paired this with the zucchini scapecce like a zucchini onion strings. Not greasy but crispy enough with flavor to enjoy on it's own or pair with the lobster roll. Lightness of the zucchini paired nicely to the sandwich. Both light sides were good pairings. \n\nOverall the appetizers, sandwiches, sides, and drinks were great. Service was outstanding. Restaurant as a whole was refreshing, exceeded the expectations and hype. The restaurant reflects the pride, tradition which tributes to Giada's family and California influences. I would make sure I had a reservation the next time I am out to Las Vegas. A must try if you like food. \n\nServer was very personal and knowledgeable of menu. Server was efficient, friendly, and well articulated. It showed with suggestions. We enjoyed the meal from some suggestions he made and our own selections. Serve, wait, and host staff worked well like a oiled machine or an orchestra on key.\n\nOverall four stars for exceptions from a slight delay on the check to get to us, a little pricy, and no clue what lunch was because lunch menu (just started serving lunch) was not available until we ate there. Five stars on food, service, and drinks. \n\nWe had plenty on our list of things to do for this Vegas trip and this is a definite return place for us."

            "review": "Well, that was disappointing.\n\nMy husband and I came here to celebrate our 7th anniversary after finally scoring a reservation at a reasonable hour. We'd heard mixed reviews and lots of bad ones regarding the service, but we generally care more about food than service anyway so didn't pay much attention.\n\nThe main positive at Giada is the food. Bread was good. For the first time ever, we actually finished everything on a salumi & formaggi plate. It was delicious! The tortellini was fantastic, as was the chocolate tart that few restaurants get right. My husband's bucatini was good (but not unique), but being so upset about other aspects of the experience, he won't admit it.\n\nNow the negatives. First, we had to wait an extra 10 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. This wouldn't be so bad if it was the only problem. But when we were finally seated, it was in the crappiest seat in the back room. So much for the cool atmosphere.\n\nThe hostess and our first server both wished us a happy anniversary and were pleasant enough. However, after taking our order, we never saw our server again. The salumi and formaggi platter came out quick enough, but it was about 45 minutes before we got our tortellini and risotto. Only problem was we didn't order risotto. It should've been bucatini. When we told the next employee who finally walked by our table, he said he'd tell someone but no apology. A new server (we were never informed our old one was gone) came out to say they would get the bucatini ready, but we could snack on the risotto. Well, I don't like scallops, and my husband is in the process of finding out about a possible shellfish allergy, so we weren't doing that. Still no apology.\n\nI tried to put off eating my tortellini but didn't want it to get cold so ate it in very slow motion. Long after I finished it and it was taken away, the bucatini finally arrived. Once my husband started eating it, the server apologized and said the first waitress entered the ticket incorrectly. At this point, my husband's mood was ruined.\n\nOnce he was finished, the server said he was checking with the manager to see if we could get a free dessert, which she approved. Most upscale restaurants-- or even Applebee's for that matter-- give us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary anyway, so that offer was annoying. Maybe they don't do that there though, so whatever.\n\nWhat I know they DO do is at least write \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate, but that didn't happen for us. The chocolate tart was very tasty though, and I was happy they weren't afraid of making it super sweet. The manager came over later to apologize and tell us the dessert would be complimentary. Yeah, yeah, we know. She seemed nervous and like this was her first restaurant job.\n\nThe only attentive part of the service was the guy who constantly kept my water glass full. I saw a woman at another table drop her clutch, and instead of handing it to her or saying something (she hadn't noticed), the busser kept kicking it under her table without acknowledging it out loud.\n\nAlso, when leaving a good restaurant, employees generally step aside to let customers pass. At Giada, I almost got mowed down by the busboy.\n\nThe food was really impressive, but the unprofessional service (or lack thereof) was a huge turn-off and made the constant waiting not really worth the time. Some of the issues were minor, but the way they were dealt with was immature and not standard in a high end restaurant. I doubt we'll be back. Luckily, we have another anniversary reservation at CUT tomorrow, where we can rely on service that matches the food."

The dishes, light fixtures, furniture, colors, artwork, and even the hostess uniforms are all well appointed. Because it's breakfast, I don't want - nor do I expect - to get too adventurous. But Giada made it clear that their eggs and toast are simply much better than others. It's expensive. It's supposed to be. And you should know that going in ($6 for a plain coffee). The staff is friendly with just a sprinkle of attitude, arrogance and condescension. It's an annoying tendency I've been noticing lately in the service industry: Example, A hostess at Chili's becomes quite affected, cool and proud of herself when she becomes a hostess at Craftsteak. You're a hostess, get over yourself and smile."

We did get to sit right by the windows though which was very nice.\n\nThe restaurant was pretty full when we arrived and we had to wait over 20 minutes even though we had a reservation but the woman at the entrance told us that they were running late. The service was decently fast and nice. The restaurant is located in the middle of the Strip, which makes it easy to reach on your way to pretty much any casino. As always on the strip, you can park at any casino nearby.\n\nWe took a pizza and their muffaletta. Both were decently good, but very small for the price you pay, particularly the pizza. The muffaletta did come with zucchini fries though which made it much better.\n\nOverall, my experience with Giada was positive and I would recommend it. This is a decently good restaurant with a great view of the strip. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"

The hostesses were great and did honor the request for a window table, but it was half an hour after the reservation time.  No biggie because the room is comfortable and the view was fantastic.  The waiter was very good and tried his best to push the tasting menu, but we already knew what we wanted.  Here is the breakdown of dishes.\n\n1.  Lobster Arancini- 8  Very good... red sauce was the best part.\n2.  Shrimp Scampi- 8  Marscapone made this dish, but shrimp seemed of a lesser quality.  Polenta cake was perfect.\n3.  Artchoke Soup- 10  What an amazing soup, great taste and texture.\n4.  Pasta Fagiole- 10  My partner loved it.\n5.  Lobster Ravioli-10  This was too delicious to describe, perfect dish.\n6.  Rack of Lamb- 3  The pictures on Yelp make this dish look great, but our lamb was incredibly fatty.  The waiter said it was because it was Colorado lamb and I felt intimidated not to send it back.  Never again; there were only 4 tiny bites out of the whole dish.  The spinach served with it was delicious, though.\n     The worst part of it was the half hour wait between the soup course and the FAT of the Lamb course.  Way too long of a wait.  The server did say a couple of times that it would be right up, but never apologized for the wait.  That lamb dish was $45 for nothing... I want my money back!\n\nOverall it was a decent experience, but not worth $240.  The bottles of wine start in the $50 range and go up from there.  There should be more reasonably priced options, especially in the Italian categories... been to Italy several times and even good wines are a bargain.  They are trying to hype this restaurant as more casual dining as if you were having dinner in someones home.  Somewhat pricey for a home cooked meal.  \n\nProbably would not return for dinner, but might try lunch sometime if Giada has some amazing paninis on the menu.\n\nOne more item of interest- We saw tank-tops, tee shirts, tennis shoes, shorts, midriffs, sandals and every other type of dress here.  Not sure there is a dress code."

The evening started out at the bar with a $17.00 small glass of uninspired Pinot Noir for me and a $10.00 imported beer for my husband.  We were a party of six, and I must say we were seated quickly in the rather noisy dining area.  The service here is slow, and pre-dinner cocktails took a long time in coming.  We ordered an antipasta plate which was OK but ordinary....however the price was astronomical! The salads were good, but the worst part came when the entrees......didn't all arrive at the same time.  Three people in our party did not receive their entrees, and since we were all raised right, we all waited 20 min. until they appeared to begin eating. Naturally they were cold, and I found the pasta in my lemon spaghetti rather soggy.  My husband had the pork ragout, which had a peculiar burnt taste and left him with a queasy stomach later in the evening.  The crowning touch came with the bill, the amount of which could fed an average family of 20, providing they ate at a reasonable restaurant. I am from Charleston SC originally, where there are very expensive restaurants as well. However, the food, service and atmosphere at these eateries are usually impeccable. Not so at Giada's ! Needless to say, we will not be back. In parting..... Never trust a skinny chef or her restaurant!"

We were brought in right at our reservation time, we took the tour/walk thru of the kitchen, antipasta and pasta area. We were sat in the dinning room with a nice view of the hotels across from the Cromwell. I loved the decor in the restaurant, it was nice and bright, I don't enjoy dining in dark restaurants. An iPad with the drink menu was brought to us, and a delicious bread assortment. \u00c8 decided to order the chefs tasting menu, 1st course of an antipasti plate with bacon wrapped figs, a tuna crostini and goat cheese stuffed peppers came, it was so yummy I forgot to snap a pic while the dates were still on the plate. Then the 2nd course came I had the lemon spaghetti with shrimp (first let me say it was so yummy and the portions were so large I could have stopped there and been satisfied, also the shrimp were cooked perfect and they were so huge I had to cut it into several bites) my husband chose the vegetable bolognese that was super yummy and it tasted so hearty that you would have sworn there was meat in it. 3rd course was the salmon with edamame and a mustard sauce, this was so delicious and moist cooked perfectly, hubby got the lamb chops, I can tell you I don't eat lamb and these babies made me change my mind, so tender and mild tasting. You also received chorizo corn and lemon Parmesan roasted potato side dishes with the main course.I ordered an iced tea and a gentleman brought over a freshly steeped pot of ginger pear tea that he poured over ice for me and gave me some agave syrup to sweeten it, delicious. The 4th course was dessert we got a blackberry and lime mousse, 2 chocolate peanutbutter and jam cookies, and almond cake with a fruit topping and 2 gelatos a berry one and a white chocolate one, every one of these desserts were excellent, but we were so full at this point. The best part of the tasting was that we got a take away of recipes from the dishes we had and an autographed photo of Giada. \n    I was so impressed with this restaurant, yes it's pricey but it's Vegas we expect that from the celebrity eateries."

And then, there is the photo booth.  On to the dining room and you have well dressed waiters trying to provide a five star experience.

However due to the absolutely abysmal service I received today at Lunch Giada is getting 2 stars. I hope my experience was an outlier & from what I've heard/seen that may be the truth but the service ruined what would have been an amazing meal for me & has probably made it so I won't return any time soon.\nAs I said the food was amazing. Everything came quickly from the kitchen (other than the bread which was a little backed up), but everything was plated beautifully & tasted amazing. We started with the Orzo Meatballs & Prosciutto Dan Danielle to start. The meatballs had a great flavor profile & were cooked to perfection. The Prosciutto was a perfect balance of meat & ham & paired nicely with the warm bread & pesto. Our Entrees were the Venetian Panino & Lasagne, both were delicious & while the portions are a touch small I was happy with them. For dessert we had Zappole which were served with a chocolate sauce G & were a perfect end to the meal.\n& thus ends the glowing part of the review. Let's discuss the Service:\nI had a reservation that was made on Open Table, which was a great idea because even at 12:45 on a Wednesday there was a line to get seated. We checked in & were seated within minutes by a very friendly hostess, who informed us we were seated in Christopher H's section & that he would be by with menus in a moment.\n10 minutes later, we still haven't seen or heard from Christopher, the busboy notices that we've been seated for a while & brings us over some water, apologizes for the delay & goes & flags down our server.  About 3-5 minutes later he came over & dropped off the menus. He introduced himself & then went on for about 5 minutes explaining the menu in full detail. This would have been great however he was talking in a very hushed mumble & we could barely hear every 5th word he said over the noise in the room. He then said give us a minute to make our decision & he'd come back.\nAnother 5 minutes after we had closed our menus & set them on the edge of the table he finally came over & took our order.  He hurried off & entered our order, the apps came out before the bread which is fine, the runner explained that the bread oven was a \"little backed up because everything is made fresh\" but it came about 2 minutes after our apps got delivered. No big deal, it was delicious when it arrived. \nThe busby then came by & cleared our app plates & brought over some silverware for our main course. Our waiter came by moments before our entrees arrived & asked if we would like some more bread, to which I replied, \"Yes the bread is great we'll take another\". \nThe entrees made their way to our table & they were great, the busboy came by & topped off our beverages, but our server is nowhere to be found. No \"hey how's everything tasting\" or \"hey would you like some fresh cracked pepper\" nothing. He is bending over backwards to cater to the 5 top a few tables away from us & the couple seated right next to us, but he never  comes over to our table. We finish our entrees & the busboy scoops up our plates.\nMy aunt wants to check out the dessert menu, however our waiter is nowhere to be found so she gets up, walks over 2 sections & asks a different waiter for a dessert menu. We then place a dessert order with the busboy because we haven't seen our waiter in a good 20 minutes, even though he's been to the table directly next to us no less than 4 times.  Dessert is delivered & our waiter brings out plates & a fork for the dessert course after the food has arrived. I immediately ask for the check as the 90 minutes we've been there was longer than I planned & I need to duck out quickly for work.  He brings the check by & moseys off.\nI have worked in the industry, I've waited tables in the past & am a majority of the time a great tipper however the service I received at a White Table Cloth Celebrity Chef Spot was not worthy of my usual 20-25%. The bill was about $70, I paid $75, & our waiter took the check & went back to the wait station. \nI watched as his eyes got about as big as dish plates & he looks right at me & comes back with the bill to our table. He asks, \"Did I take this too early\". To which I reply, \"No we're fine.\" He then says, \"You do know that here at Giada Gratuity isn't included in the bill?\" To which I say, \"I know, there was nothing about your service that deserved more, maybe if you had actually acknowledged our existence you would have got a better tip.\"  He just shrugged his shoulders & walked off.\nOn the way out the busboy once again apologized for the wait, but once again the server didn't say a word other than to complain about his tip. \nI really enjoyed the food & it's a beautiful room, but that service was so bad that I probably won't be returning anytime soon."

I can't remember his name off the top of my head, but he was very willing to chat with us about the winery where our wine came from, and spent a good amount of time with us. Our glasses were never empty. Whether it was the server or sommelier, both were very attentive. The desserts were incredible. The ricotta cake was a delightful surprise, and the lemon cookies were addictive. \n\nOur service was top notch. Our server was Rocco. As an italian, he fits in perfectly at Giada. However, his service was absolutely incredible. I highly recommend asking for him if you make a reservation at Giada. I believe service is the key to a great restaurant, and here, Rocco makes this experience and restaurant absolutely amazing. \n\nI highly recommend Giada, and Rocco as your server."

Although we had a reservation, we did have to wait a bit, which was a little annoying, but Gracie, one of the managers was so nice and apologetic and bought us a round of drinks. In addition, she gave us a tour of the restaurant as well. The ambiance is wonderful. There are few restaurants in Vegas that look directly out on the strip, so you can see the Bellagio fountains dancing every 15 mins. The servers were impeccable. Very attentive, very helpful. At one point, during dessert, we were enjoying our tray of cookies and my partner asked if any of the cookie recipes were in any of Giada's books, and he promptly went and asked and came back and showed us the book where the recipe was. Needless to say we bought the book. Then on our way out, we were showed the photo booth set-up and had a wonderful photo taken of us and now I have it as my desktop! The entire meal was so incredibly delicious and the service so memorable, this has become our favorite restaurant in Vegas. We'll be back often. Keep up the great work!"

The shaved zucchini(?)/potato \"fries\" were really creative and delicious though.\n\nIt is worth noting that the portions are relatively small, but that wasn't the worst thing in the world given the amount we had gorged ourselves elsewhere during the vacation. Moreover, the price was exceptionally reasonable for the Strip -- with a 20% off coupon our bill (for two) came to around $25. It absolutely makes sense as a place to get a nice casual lunch for a reasonable price if you're recovering from a food orgy the night before (a not-uncommon problem for Vegas vacationers!)."

It seemed a little weird to me that we had multiple servers and once our main server had a large table they had the helper tend to us. They seemed so busy that their rooting of the specials was more important than saying good evening. The hostesses were wearing nice dresses and the servers were wearing white coats."

The food was not worth what they charge.  We got the risotto, which was full of shells.  Our party even got sick from it.  The other dishes like the burrata and the pasta were ok.  Nothing special and nothing that you could not have gotten from olive garden.\n\nI love Giada and was very excited to eat at her restaurant, but it was incredibly disappointing.  In a city with so many high quality restaurants, I recommend that you eat somewhere else.  This place is definitely not worth your money."

We chose this restaurant because of Giada, so I was expecting it to be nice but wow is it classyyyy. It is fine dining and everything that comes along with it. My favorite was the featured bread plate of the day because there were many things to try not just one chunk of bread to eat. I had the ravioli and my sister the cucumber soup and risotto. All delicious!:) \n\nIt was chilly in the restaurant but most places are freezing in Vegas so no surprise there. Unfortunately the neighboring server to Lauren's section was rude and I could hear his nasty comments about his coworkers to his tables. No thanks. \n\nLauren was great though!

That's probably why I was so let down when I had one of the worst dining experiences here. \n\nMy mom and I made a lunch reservation at Giada's. The location is great and the decor is lovely. We also had a blast in the photobooth. We were seated next to the window overlooking the strip, we was nice. \n\nAfter being seated, it probably took 10 minutes before we were greeted by a server who poured us water. Than we waited another 10 minutes for our actual server to greet us. Since we had already been at our table for 20 minutes, we were ready to order. We ordered an antipasti to start (mozz with citrus chili pesto), the arugula salad and the tubetti pasta. Well, after waiting 45 minutes, a server brought out our pasta. We told her that we never received our first two courses and really didn't want our last course until we could have the others. We also were never brought bread, and when we asked about this the server more or less rolled her eyes. I also must add that it was nearly impossible to get our water refilled. I think I had my empty glass sitting on the table for 35 minutes before I tracked someone down to ask them if I could have more water. \n\nSo finally after another 20 minutes after sending our pasta back, our antipasti arrived...in a chipped bowl. So had to send it back again. Another 15 minutes passed...I will say that the anitpasti was very good and I would recommend it. Next the salad was brought out (for the second time). It was also pretty good, my only thought was that it had too much dressing. And then after another long wait, the pasta was brought out again. We were told that the pasta would be remade. It was very obvious that this was the same pasta that was brought to our table 45 minutes earlier, just heated up. The pasta was cold and the top of the pasta was stale. Finally we were given the bill, which not surprisingly took forever to get the server to take our credit card. \n\nThe service really needs to change. Our server was pretty horrible, and all the other tables around us were experiencing the same issues. The table next to us said they had to wait 1 hour before they received their drinks, and another hour just to get bread. The table next to them walked out. I don't know if the issue is the servers, but it all stems to the management which definitely needs to change if this place is going to succeed. \n\nIn closing, I will not return to this restaurant nor will I recommend it, which makes me very sad to admit. I will continue to cook Giada's recipes though...at home that is."

We went twice - first for lunch and then again for brunch on our last day.\n\nThe restaurant and bar is beautiful with a gorgeous view of the fountain show at the Bellagio. The hostesses and our waiter were very personable.  We ordered cocktails to start the meal.  The waiter offered some suggestions and we then selected about seven different dishes that we planned to share between two of us.  Unfortunately, this is where the service broke down.\n\nFour dishes came out immediately - all either room temp or slightly warmer.  A few minutes after we started eating, my Bellini was delivered. So instead of savoring my leisurely lunch cocktail before the meal, it was lost amid the food.  Our \"Baked Pasta of the Day\" arrived next - a vegetarian lasagna which was borderline cold.  No melty cheese or steamy pasta - a cold mess.  We didn't eat more than a couple bites.  (I think it would have been DELICIOUS if it had been hot...)  :(  Unfortunately, our waiter was MIA after the food came out so there was no way to ask for a re-heat.\n\nWhen he eventually came by again, we pointed out that the Gorgonzola Pizza we had ordered never came out.  About 10 minutes later, the pizza was delivered and SAVED THE MEAL!  The Gorgonzola Pizza with kale and mushrooms was hot, rich and amazing..........  (Seemed like the mushrooms on the pizza are the same as the ones on the mushroom antipasti dish - wish our waiter had told us that...)  Once we finished the pizza, our waiter came by with dessert menus.  We had felt pretty rushed through our whole meal (even though it wasn't busy at that hour), so we took our time with the dessert menus, eventually settling on the zeppoles, a cookie assortment and hot tea.  Delicious!\n\nThe view, the pizza and the cookies were the highlight of our lunch.  I loved the tea cups and inquired about buying one, but was told they weren't selling them yet.  :(  On the way out, we found the Photo Booth by the hostess stand - such a great touch and so fun!\n\nDespite the service and chilly food temps (which sometimes happens at newer restaurants), I still loved this restaurant enough to go back on our last day for breakfast.  We ordered the Gorgonzola pizza again (yes - it is THAT good!) and also split an order of the Eggs Benedict with salmon cakes.  I am not really a breakfast person but this dish might have changed my mind on that!  Delicious and served at just the right temp.  Mmm...  We also ordered the cookie plate again - couldn't resist.  (In fact, the thumbprint PB&J cookies were so delicious, I made a whole batch the day I got home!)\n\nBefore we left, my friend inquired again about the teacup and -surprise!- they suddenly had one we could buy.  Strange that they were suddenly available - but YAY!  I have my lovely teacup!\n\nAll in all - I will definitely go back to Giada's the next time I'm in Vegas.  Hopefully she'll actually be in the restaurant ~ our waiter said she comes in a couple times a month and we had missed her by just one day!"

Originally we were not able to make a reservation, but we came early (~6:00 PM) on a Friday and the staff was able to accommodate us.  The pasta was especially good - we had the pappardelle, spaghetti, and ravioli.  We also ordered the lamb - there were 4 of us and we ate it all family style.   We also had the marinated olives, orzo meatballs, and bacon dates as appetizers.  All were quite good.   We decided to go Italian-style and order sparkling mineral water with our meal, which I think added to the experience (especially since we don't drink much wine).   \n\nAs the sun set, the restaurant opened the windows which overlooked the Las Vegas strip.   It was a great view.  Our indoor dining was now al fresco. With the warm Vegas nights, this additional physical feature of the restaurant made the experience much more enjoyable.  Regarding service, again, it was top notch.  Our waiter, Cliff, was very personable and attentive.  He made us feel like family.   The only minor down side we saw was when a different waiter accidentally broke a glass by our table and did not immediately clean up the glass shards, waiting for one of the other staff to clean it up"

We had a brunch reservation and walked up to the hostess who made us wait for our table despite the restaurant being completely open.  Secondly, 3 of the 4 of us ordered coffee (see below), which we sent back.  The waiter reluctantly offered us juice instead.  On our final bill we were charged for the juice instead of the coffee and the juice was more expensive.  We thought at a minimum he would charge us for the cheaper coffee drinks we ordered or give us good service and comp. the drinks.  The waiter was not friendly or attentive. \n\nThe coffee was so watery it wasn't even worth drinking.  We all ordered different things (latte, cappuccino and straight brewed coffee) and they all tasted really, really awful.  We heard the couple at the table across from us also complaining about the coffee and dousing their drinks with sugar and cream.  We all understand if the machine or whatever was not functioning properly but as mentioned above, they did not take care of us.  I don't think giada would stand for this. \n\nOn the plus side, the actual food was good.  None of us were sure it was worth the money for a pretty standard breakfast, but the items we ordered tasted good.  The decor in the restaurant was also nice. \n\nIf the restaurant can take huge strides on the service front and make sure they have good tasting coffee for breakfast, the experience would be much better."

So ecstatic to the point where if he hadn't planned me the best birthday weekend ever, it'd bother me...just a little...\n\nThis 4-star review is one that could easily be a 5-star my next visit. Are first impressions everything? No, but boy do you remember them!\n\nWe made reservations via OpenTable for 5:45pm. We checked in at the hostess stand and waited by the entry. A few minutes went by and we watched a handful of hostesses trying to appear organized, while we watched a few more parties check in and wait along with us. No parties were seated. Then, one of the hostesses came and asked again what name our reservations were booked with. She returned to the hostess stand, and we waited. A few minutes later, a different hostess approached us and suggested we order some drinks at the lounge while we wait. Feeling a bit skeptical, but we did just that. We ordered drinks at the lounge, the only available table had empty beer bottles from the previous customers. A manager approached and welcomed us to the restaurant and thanked us for joining them for dinner. Then, he walked away. My thoughts? Anyone? How about seeing to getting tables bussed... or helping the hostesses seat some parties? Before our drinks arrived, a DIFFERENT hostess (yes, there were about 5 of them, at least) informed us that our table was ready and that our drinks can be delivered to our dinner table. She asked, \"Who was your cocktail server?\" My boyfriend and I looked at her blankly, the server didn't introduce herself and we didn't notice if she wore a nametag. The hostess gave us this look like \"What, you don't remember the server you had a 20-second interaction with?!?!\" She walked off without another word, asked around to find out who was our server, then returned to seat us. We finally got to our table at 6:15pm. I understand, maybe 1/2 hour isn't the most horrible wait time, but that whole scenario made it seem forever. \n\nOkay enough, on with the food!\n\nCitrus Marinated Calamari\nLobster Arancini\nSpah-geh-tee\nVeal Chop Saltimbocca\nHomemade Gelato\n\nHer spaghetti lives up to the hype, it was amazing! The shrimps underneath the pasta were unbelievable, I think I cut one shrimp into five pieces. The lobster arancini were delicious, but I could've lived without the calamari. I'd probably have gone with the fried version next time. My boyfriend said the veal chop was good, but the portion was too big and a little too much breading for his taste. The gelato? We got two scoops, roasted banana and white coffee w/ chocolate shavings. Yum!\n\nThe service at the table? Phenomenal! I can't say one bad word about it. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and timely without the feeling of being rushed. \n\nI have to say I LOVED the ambiance and decor. Everything from the glass straw for your iced tea, elegant feminine silverware, the fresh pasta noodle display, even her restrooms with hand paper towels with \"Giada\" printed on them just screamed the chef and her classy style. It's a place I'd love to return to have lunch with just the gals.\n\nFYI: \n\n- Make your reservations at OpenTable online. I attempted to change our dinner time via the Cromwell. OpenTable had seatings available that the Cromwell did not offer.\n\n- They offer a dinner tasting menu for $125/person that includes many of the popular items for every course. Full table participation only.\n\n- They charged for our dessert, even though we were celebrating a special occasion. Were we spoiled in expecting that? The gentlemen with the elegant dessert cart did write Happy Birthday on my plate and make me feel special, plus the gelato was incredible!\n\n- Giada herself did not make an appearance that night. Good thing my boyfriend fell into a deep content food coma over the delicious dinner or he'd have been utterly disappointed. Hopefully next time!"

This one is the tough one because every one loves this place so much but here goes........\nI did not care for this restaurant at all. I visited on Dec 2, 2014 at 6pm reservation so I had flown from Houston to Vegas arriving at noon and I had been up since 5am Houston time so by the time I got here I was exhausted so I am hoping that had to do with my bad experience. I was seated with very little wait. the place is so beautiful but hard to tell because it is so DARK! I had to pull out my iPhone to light up my menu and my food and I never have to do that!\nI was brought some bread to start and guy delivering bread told me to be careful because bread in little cast iron skillet was extremely hot so to let it cool I ate a few of the hard sticks of bread which I hate. So I feel top of bread in skillet and it is barely warm, so I pull it out and break it in half and it is ice, ice cold! So much for my hot bread. It is good though but better hot I am sure. \nI started with the Orzo Meatballs with pomodoro sauce. The meatballs were dry and tasted like Sams warehouse meatballs in a bag. Sauce was good.\nI wanted to try veal chop Milanese style and the waiter said it was cooked to a medium temp was that ok with me? yes I said medium is fine. Also ordered lemon potatoes.\nThe chop arrived and it was huge. Also just a huge chunk of meat coated in bread crumbs with no sauce. So I cut in and take a bite and it is chewy and tastes like saw dust but I am hungry so I try another bite same deal but even chewier so I whip out my cell phone to look at it and it is raw!!  Now I hate hate hate sending things back so I don't even want to mess with it but I did call waiter over and show him the raw slab of meat on my plate. He apologizes and wants to send it back to re cook it but I am done by this time so I just tell him it is ok I will just try dessert.\nHe also says that Giada was going to be visiting next day and she would be horrified by the rawness. I doubt he told her! lol\nPotatoes were bland and had no lemon flavor whatsoever. So maybe dessert will be better.........Nope! I got the deconstructed lemon meringue pie and it was dry and blah!\nWaiter was way too busy to give good service or maybe because I was single woman by myself but he was good enough to take chop off the ticket. \nHopefully this was isolated incident and next time I am in Vegas I will give Giada's another try."

It was so elegant, yet warm at the same time. Kudos to the decorator! It didn't feel stuffy at all and it felt like everyone was welcome unlike other restaurants who make you feel like you need a Black AMEX to eat there. lol The view is wonderful if you are lucky enough to get a seat by the window. \n\nThe staff was amazing! She trained her staff so well! Above and beyond the call of duty. The waiter was so attentive and friendly. He answered all of our questions and made sure we were properly taken cared of. All his recommendations were delicious. The other members of the staff were so helpful as well. When I asked the gentleman filling the water glasses where the restroom was, he dropped everything he was doing to walk me over to where it was. Now that is great hospitality. We also ordered bottled water and when that bottle ran out, they gave us additional cups filled with filtered water as to not mixed with the bottle water. Such detail!\n\nOn to the food. The complimentary bread and dipping sauce were very good. Even though the sauce looked too oily, it was bursting with flavor. I enjoyed it immensely. We ordered the orzo meatballs, Pasta e Fagoli soup, lobster roll, and G's baked pasta. The orzo meatballs were so creative and yummy. I never thought to add pasta to a meatball. Ingenius! Only bad thing was that it was such a small portion. I could have eaten two more plates of them. The soup was good, but the beans were a little undercooked in my opinion. My lobster roll was not like any lobster roll that I had ever tasted before. The lobster was cooked in lemon and basil. Very light and tangy. Not heavy at all. I really appreciated that. Alone, the lobster would be so amazing, but what sealed it all together was the heavenly bread that the lobster rested upon. Such buttery goodness and combined with the lobster, it was like my taste buds were singing hallelujah! :P The arugula salad that came with the entree was a nice compliment to the roll. My husband got the G's baked pasta and even though I didn't try it, he said it was tasty. It looks deceivingly small, but filled him up 3/4 of the way through.  \n\nThe prices are high even though the restaurant gives off a casual feel, but I do believe you get what you pay for. The ambiance, the service, and the quality is all there. You can tell that the food was made with time and love. Bravo! I am a fan!"

It is pricey but my bf and I really enjoyed the food as well as the view.  We both had their sangrias, super good.  Then we split the sweet pea tortellini and lemon pesto grilled cheese.  Both were very light but filling.  Perfect way to start our trip!"

This was a plus as it helped entertained my toddler throughout the meal! They dont offer kids menu but they have pizzettes that are suitable for little kids. And with their delicious complimentary breads, that totally can fill up a toddler's tummy! my daughter ate so much bread and breadsticks, by the time the pizzette arrived she was full. as a matter of fact she preferred the complimentary bread basket over the pizzette!!\n\nthe complimentary breads were SO good. what really was the star was the condiments that you can pair with the breads! the mascarpone butter was so good, the fried capers was well executed, normally i dont like much capers cuz it's too sour, but this fried capers was different and it balances the sweetness of the mascarpone butter. The basil pesto was mm mm mmmmmm!!  \n\nwe ordered an appetizer, a sampler of salumi and formaggi... everything was delicious. i didn't know that parmaggiano reggiano would be sooooo delicious with honeycombs! I'm totally going to recreate this at home.. the only problem is getting that type of honey.\n\ni ended up ordering the Short ribs Agnolotti and i thought it was just okay. i don't recommend this dish. the agnolotti was not piping hot, i felt like it was sitting at the kitchen for a long time before it arrived on my table. The pasta was hardening too. The taste was nothing spectacular and the portion was extremely small. I'm so glad we ordered the appetizer and that there were complimentary breads. My husband ordered the white lasagna and that one was way better than my agnolotti. \n\noverall i think the appetizers and the breads outshine the main course. Till this day i am still thinking about the appetizers and the delicious fresh breads and breadsticks!"

They have cheese courses but they're not served with anything. A big blob of cheese in the middle of a board and some small crumbly things next to it. The Parmesan was just chunks of Parmesan on a plate. Four little chunks of Parmesan and nothing else. The bacon wrapped dates were very good. My husband enjoyed the risotto with scallops. But in my opinion it's overpriced and the portions are ridiculously small. I understand fine dining small but this was a little crazy. if I had to go back I would stick to the appetizer menu.

The problem is the branding is what they are selling as the food fell flat. This place is a real moneymaker with high prices and very small portions. Maybe that's how Giada stays so thin!!  Dinner for 3 included the tasting menu with 1 bottle of moderately priced wine, 1 cocktail   plus gratuity (service was excellent) came to $750!!  Potions extremely small, even considering it was the tasting menu.  One dish I I had was the mushroom pasta choice that was very gummy and sent back. Replaced with tortellini choice that was crunchy!!  Forget it!!  A companion we had dinner with had been there once before and said he had previously found the pasta \"gummy\".  I had the Bronzino as the main course which was ok but bland. My companions were not impressed with their choices either. \n\nWithout further ado... I would save your money and avoid this tourist trap. Too many better choices with chefs that are actually there preparing the meal as opposed to lending their name to a restaurant group. I wish I had my money back!!  Giada should be ashamed!!"

Don't know what happened, but I don't feel like the experience was as exceptional as the first time. Got the lemon spaghetti again but the prawns were a little over cooked. Burrata wasn't as creamy as the first time. Chose some things off the dessert cart and while it was all good, none of it blew me away (which is funny because didn't Giada start in pastry??)

Our server was a french dude, who was also very nice and welcoming. The manager also made sure that my 3 year-old son is comfortable, he was given a portable dvd player so that he can watch a movie. That was very nice. Since they're relatively new, we were asked a couple of times on how we were doing. While it is a family restaurant, unlike a typical Italian restaurant their servings are portioned, meaning it is a fine dining serving. It was expected, but mind you their food was flavorful. We loved everything we ordered, from the antipasti, entree and dessert, food was fabulous. Dining experience was superb, if you hit Vegas on your next trip, do try Giada's!"

I emailed Laurent, the manager for a last minute booking for a party of 12 and amazingly he went above and beyond to not only get us a table on a day that was booked out in every restaurant in LV, but ensured that the entire night was perfect!  If you can request a server, I HIGHLY recommend asking to be sat in Laura's section.  She was wonderful, engaging and made each person at our table feel as if they were the only one that mattered to her.\n\nGiada's is a classic Italian dining out experience.  The meal will take 3-4 hours from start to finish and that's how it's SUPPOSED to be!  It's about enjoying your friends and family and experiencing the food along the way.  If you need to get in and out within an hour for dinner, this is not the place for you.\n\nThe food here is simply AMAZING!!!!  We ordered so many different things that this review would take forever to complete.  I can however, embellish a bit on some of the highlights.\n\nCharred Octopus - Cooked to perfection. Great amount of char on the Octopus. I converted 5 people that night who hated Octopus to loving it.  That should be all you need to know :)\n\nArtichoke Soup - Rich and velvety.  You get a mouthful of Artichoke essence in every bite.  And the kicker?  NO BUTTER or CREAM in the soup! YUM!\n\nCrab Risotto with Scallops - SO GOOD!  Rich and creamy without feeling too heavy.  The sweetness of the crab played throughout the dish and the scallops were seared to perfection.\n\n7oz Fillet - Easily the best dish of the night.  Everyone who took a bite needed to just sit back in their chair and savor every morsel.  Seared on the outside wonderfully and moist, tender and juicy in the middle and just the right amount of seasoning.  OMG this is a MUST HAVE DISH for anyone who likes a steak! and for those who don't!\n\nBlackberry Parfait - I can't even describe this. Fruity, sweet, light, not too sweet. The perfect end to a perfect meal.\n\nAll in all the staff went above and beyond and the food was absolutely AMAZING!  If you are looking for a great meal, a great experience and have some time and a little money to burn, Giada's should be on your to-do list.  Heck, I even did a cartwheel in front of the restaurant after because I was so happy!"

The manager, Michael and the entire serving staff were incredibly gracious in accommodating his request and making me feel special! Our view was SPECTACULAR!! \n\nAnother SPECTACULAR element?...anything and everything you eat here. Seriously! The food is beyond flavorful; its rich without being too much or overwhelming. Everything is balanced and included with a purpose. My honey and I tried a couple appetizers...the calamari (oh mah gawd) is a must, the meatballs (yes please) are uniquely her (Giada) own. The pasta dishes are delightful! All of their pasta and bread are freshly made in-house. \n\nIn my second experience I was able to try their polenta waffles from their brunch menu. Talk about scrumptious. The texture and flavor was way beyond what I was expecting. Home run with this one chef!! I decided to continue my sweet craving by sampling the Lemon Ricotta cookies...these were perhaps one of the most delicious cookies I've ever eaten in my LIFE!!! \n\nThere are so many wonderful aspects of this restaurant. I can't speak highly enough of all of the staff, from the beautiful hostesses to the servers and chefs, to their incredibly friendly management. The ambience is chic and classy, not at all pretentious for being located on one of, if not the hottest corners on the Strip!

Our server gave great recommendations. We had bruschetta as an app and it tasted sooooo great. They brought out a nice array to munch on as well before the main course.

What a disappointment though. :( we went for lunch because the Yelp reviews were so low. First, I felt the lunch menu was lacking pasta options. I really wanted pasta but I didn't want lasagna or gnocchi. Based on the waitress recommendation I ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese with prosciutto and the fried zucchini rings. The sandwich was ok. Nothing special and certainly not worth $23. The zucchini was also ok. There was mound of it and honestly too much. It needs a dip, maybe an aioli. Boring on its own and too salty. I tried the lasagna that my friend ordered and was glad I didn't order it as the pasta was soggy. It didn't taste like anything special either. I've had better other places that are less elegant for sure. I tried my friends pizza and it was good, I'd say the best thing at the table. I wish I had ordered it. I'm not cheap but I do have to say that a $6 iced tea for lunch is a little steep. The tea wasn't anything special. The decor of the restaurant was great. Very Giada. I don't regret trying it but I won't be back nor will I recommend it to anyone. We ate at several other restaurants in Vegas that were much better...Mesa Grill, Mon Ami Gabi."

Not only was he a pleasant bartender who didn't intrude too much while keeping his professional and congenial demeanor, he REALLY knew the menu. Hats off to you bud.\n\nThe food on the other hand was...sofa king good. I love octopus and this was by far the best octopus I've had in a long while. Great portion and, more importantly, the most succulent octopus I've had that I can remember. So many places do octopus and just don't do the guy justice by overcooking or charring the hell out of the meat, then giving you tiny tentacles. This octopus was SO GOOD. \n\nWe also had the duck prosciutto which we were worried might be tough, since many in house Prosciuttos turn out tough. No no no, this was soooooooo tender, with perfect accompaniments to offer little zings of acid or salt or crunch here and there. \n\nThanks to Giovanni, we finished off our meal with the lemon souffle.

I was extremely disappointed in the lack of flavor in all the food especially what was supposed to be one of her signature dishes, the lemon spaghetti. No flavor at all.  I squeezed extra lemon from a slice I had for my water and put more pepper which helped a little.  The Caprese salad lacked any seasoning and the yellow tomato soup was so small, it was unbelievable for the price and also lacked flavor. Everything was high priced and very small portions so you had to order more than one thing. My husband and our friends all gave it a thumbs down and of all the restaurants we ate at our entire trip, this was the worst. I expected so much more flavor from Giada's food. I will say that the waiter tried to make it right by giving us one free dessert for everyone to try and it was quite good with chocolate, peanut butter pie. I will not go back and would discourage anyone from going for 3 reasons:extremely pricey; very small portions; and very bland, lack of flavor."

Completely our fault for not calling earlier, was just disappointed since the lunch menu is a limited menu and I would have liked to have tried some of her fancier dishes.\n\nI am giving 2 stars because of the terrible wait (with a reservation), the crappy server, and the general lack luster of the food.\n\nI REALLY wanted to love this place. Our reservation was at 2pm and when we arrived they said they were a little behind and asked if we'd like to wait at the bar, so we did. The bartender was great! I ordered a white sangria and it was fabulous. Then it was all downhill from here.\n\nA server came to the bar with a returned drink, loudly complained about the guests at his table, and told the bartender to serve the drink that was returned to the next person who ordered it! I don't think the bartender did, but it was completely unprofessional on the part of the server. \n\nWe were finally sat 45 minutes after our reservation, and guess who our server is, the same server with the returned drink situation, disappointing but wanted to give him a 2nd chance.\n\nThe food was so-so. We ordered a little bit of everything and there was nothing that I feel is worth writing about, good or bad.\n\nThe server was pretty awful. Lunch was over a 2.5 hour process, for appetizers, pizza and salad. Then he mischarged us on the final bill, to his detriment, which we pointed out. When he fixed the bill, he left the cash left by other customers in our check, which we also returned.\n\nAs I said, I really wanted to love this place, but it needs some work.

The mix of sprouts, cheese and sweetness of cranberries was fantastic.\nI ordered the Giada....and posted a pic. Very chic and the type of eloquent touches I appreciate when ordering a cocktail.\nThe bartenders were very attentive and energetic. I loved sitting at the bar! Now,behind the bar was the sexy table seating. The large posterior windows were the perfect frame to the intersection at Flamingo. The grand bridges were the focal point but the Belaggio water works were the backdrop. \nI would come here again for a special ocassion."

The salmon Benedict was definitely the best. Everything else was extremely bland with little to no flavor. We got the pastry assortment as well (probably the best part of the meal).\nNot only was the food subpar, but the service was absolutely horrible. Lots of sitting around for a restaurant that wasn't even fully packed. Even when we showed up for our reservation, we stood around for 15 minutes while the hostess went back and forth to the table - there were many empty tables at this point!\nOverall, do not understand the hype and would never recommend this restaurant."

We are celebrating our 2 year marriage! \n\nThe decor and layout was nice. The chairs were super comfortable and I love the theme of the restaurant. \n\nThe service was mediocre. Maybe our waiter had a rough day but didn't go over the tasting menu. Just gave us our water, then when it was time to order he said \"Ready?\" I prefer interaction with the waiter where they talk to us a bit about the menu. Especially at a place like this. \n\nMy wife got the risotto and I got the spaghetti. We both loved our dishes. However, this might have been the first time where we both looked and said where is the rest of our food. Typically Italian restaurants are pricey therefore we rarely go to Italian restaurants when we can make it at home. \n\nI'd recommend this place just because we are huge fans and I did like my spaghetti. Did feel as if everything had lemon in it. We did receive a nice anniversary plate which made it special :)"

Instead of ordering my regular Grey Goose on the rocks I eyed a bottle of Grey Goose XV. The bar tender explained it was being test marketed (95% vodka/5% cognac) and poured a taste. Excellent start to the evening. \nSeated shorty after and we opted for the tasting menu. Antipasto selection, to share, was outstanding. My next course was freshly handmade pasta in a lemon crema sauce. Outstanding once again. Moved on to a beef tenderloin that needed no knife ... served with a salsa verde sauce. Service was excellent and while not rushed the timing between servings was spot on. A cart of assorted desserts arrived for the finale. After we each selected a dessert the server said \"c'mon... take another\" and we did. Going be be difficult to visit Vegas again without spending at least one evening dining here again. I'll do it!"

            "review": "Last night was my second time at Giada and like the first time, it didn't disappoint.  I made a reservation well over a week ago to take a friend to dinner for her birthday.  Reservation was made through Open Table and was quick and efficient.  I requested a window seat via Open Table and of course was told nothing was guaranteed but a request would be submitted.  \n\nI was called about 3 days prior to our reservation to confirm and was told (rather bluntly but I get it - money talks) that a window seat is only guaranteed to guests who \"commit to spending $100 per person.\"  I thought that was a bit strange but told the restaurant rep that I couldn't commit to that (I couldn't eat $100 worth of food anywhere and I don't drink so getting to that figure wasn't feasible for me) and she politely said that she understood but would put in the request and do their best to accommodate me.  That's all I could ask and while it was a little strange to have been told that, in some weird way I appreciated the honesty.  \n\nForward to last night.  We arrived on time and were seated right away at...wait for it...a window seat!  The caveat was that it was a window seat on the south side of the restaurant where they have these rather large and cumbersome wooden blinds that don't offer the best view but if we craned our necks just so...we'd get a partial view of the Bellagio fountains.  Suggestion: If a window seat is your thing, get specific and ask for a seat on the west side of the restaurant.  It's a less obstructed view (although I'm not certain you'd be able to see the fountains) but there are no wooden blinds at all on that side so the view is far better. \n\nFor dinner, we decided on a couple apps and then a couple pastas and we shared everything.  We started with the arugula salad with candied lemons, pancetta and shaved parmesan.  No kidding - I could have stopped there and been completely content.  It was so good.  Light but satisfying.  We then shared the crab and artichoke dip.  I was worried at first that it was going to be too heavy but in true Italian form, it was light but packed with flavor and incredibly delicious.  The lemon and spiciness of it made for a completely different taste than what you normally think of as a crab and artichoke dip and the herb crostini, while slightly over-greasy, paired perfectly with it.  \n\nWe HAD to go with pasta for our main entrees and one out of two was amazing.  We settled on the risotto with king crab and scallops and the white lasagna.  The risotto was seriously out of this world.  It was so flavorful but again not heavy at all.  The scallops were grilled to perfection.  Absolute and total perfection.  We were a little less impressed with the white lasagna.  It just seemed like it was lacking something.  It was bland and not anywhere near as flavorful as anything else we ate.  The one bright spot was the jumbo prawn on top - it was delicious.  \n\nDessert.  We had to.  I mean, when in Rome...  We had the Limoncello souffle and it was wonderful.  The perfect end to an (almost) perfect meal.  It was light (oh I'm so overusing that word!) and lemony and tableside, just as it's served, they put a scoop of vanilla gelato smack dab in the middle and it cools it off just enough so that it's ready to eat.  Be prepared to wait a little bit for it - our server told us it would be about 15-20 minutes and it most definitely took at least that long but it was well worth it.  \n\nOur server, Rocco, was smashing.  Italian, personable, funny, helpful, professional, knowledgeable and all around fun.  He made the entire experience more enjoyable.  The femme maitre ds were satisfactory - but nothing to exclaim about.  Matter of fact, when we left around 10pm we asked if one of them would take our picture.  She seemed less than thrilled (and I get that it's late and she was probably tired) and barely acknowledged us other than to grab the camera, take a few pics and hand the camera back.  With that said, the behavior (however bad or good) of the front house staff doesn't make or break my opinion of a restaurant but had the ladies been just ever so slightly more friendly and enthusiastic, it would have made the entire experience even better.  \n\nOverall, fantastico!  Really.  It's pricey but it's the strip and it's Giada.  I'm a local so I can't see myself going here any more than maybe a few times a year but I will most decidedly be back and when I have guests in town I'll make it a point to recommend Giada.  Cibo eccellente!  Ciao!"

I will not deny I was a tad skeptical when she picked it, I tend to be a bit over critical of European styled restaurants in the US, especially celebrity run ones, mainly because I used to travel all over Europe for business.  I'm even worse if it's Italian!  I apologize for my inner snob coming out there.\n\nFear not dear reader of this review - you will not be disappointed if you come here.  This place is done with class, it's perfect from the initial greeting, looking up your reservation (and yes make one it's a popular place for good reason), being taken to your table and handed off to your server.  The atmosphere in here is amazing and it has stunning views of the strip. When asked due to bright sunlight they lowered the automatic blinds without complaint.  Now add to that the great table service and wonderful, helpful, relaxed explanation of all the menu items.  Even something as basic as water refills was done in a friendly, conversational manner.\n\nNow after all that, yes, I'll get to the food!\n\nThe bread plate up front was nothing short of wonderful.  Now add to this our appetizer of Chicken Marsala Meatballs which were wonderfully, naturally, flavored and so soft and succulent it was the perfect start to our meal.\n\nFor our mains we had the Lobster Roll as well as the Tenderloin Sliders and these also were both tantalizing and delicious. The food here just has to be tried.\n\nOne final point on the atmosphere here and I'll be done I promise!  It is cosy, inviting and relaxing.  A truly great place for special occasions."

Seated promptly, very pleasant and professional hostess staff.  However, that's where the romance ended.  Our waiter was rude, hurried, insulting.  He didn't know the menu ingredients and didn't like it when I made inquires.  Our cocktail order was slow in coming, but very nicely done when they finally arrived.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates - very disappointed.  Sausage was over powering, bacon was lackluster and far too little sauce - couldn't even tell it was gorgonzola.  This dish would have been better with and almond stuffing, Benton bacon (or one with a good deal of \"smoke\") and gorgonzola sauce that could be tasted.  We also ordered Baby Artichokes.  The grill flavor was delicious but the arts could have been trimmed better, too many tough leaves that had to be spit out!  The \"bread\" order and \"condiments\" were delicious.  Next was the crab/scallop risotto.  This was by far the most outstanding dish of the night - definitely one of my top 5 dishes ever ordered from a restaurant.  When I told the waiter how much I like the dish he made some weird comment about Gordon Ramsey???  Our 2 entrees were lobster ravioli and branzino.  The ravioli was fine, but not exceptional.  The branzino was again way under-dressed.  We were so irritated with the service by the end of the meal that we didn't even want to consider dessert or after dinner drinks.  The manager did stop by our table (twice) early in the evening for a cursory \"is everything okay\", but did pause long enough to even get an answer.  The dinner was very expensive and I just don't believe we received the value I had expected with Giada's name attached to it.  Given all of the celebrity chef options in Vegas, I would recommend that my friends make other choices."

            "review": "Not Terrible. When you expect to pay $400-500 for dinner for four, you just want something more than that. This was meant to be our 'big splurge' meal for our weekend in Vegas. Here's the lowdown:  Ambience: Lovely, modern Italian upscale restaurant, busy. Tables are so close together that I had to apologize to gent behind me as I accidentally bumped his chair several times. Service: Good, slow paced, but that's good for a restaurant experience of this $$ scale- you kind of want time to stop for a while to enjoy the meal. Servers attentive and friendly. Food: RECOMMEND: Giada's favorite antipasti: delicious bites of crostini, olives, mushrooms, and other goodies. This was $60, but enough for all four of us to enjoy as an appetizer. If only we had stopped there. The green salad, lightly dressed with a vinagrette and parmesan, looked delicious. The LOBSTER RAVIOLI was chock-full of nice lobster pieces and very delicious. Now for the downside: Soup du jour was a roasted cauliflower. Meh, It was okay, a small portion. My partner had the minestrone and I had a taste. This was in no way minestone. It was a thin, processed gruel that had no identifiable vegetables in it and tasted of the singe at the bottom of the pot. The frico of parmesan (a little crisp of grilled shredded parm) couldn't save the flavor and, soaked in the gruel, the texture suffered too. I wanted to have another bite just to make sure it was as bad as I'm describing, but I stopped at the first bite without regret. Partner and I shared the chicken cacciatore style, about $60, meant for two. Note that style-part. This was not standard cacciatore. This was a whole chicken (a petite one) and the parts were breaded and deep fried. The fried chicken, stacked prettily on both sides of the platter, was so dry and tastelessly overcooked there wasn't enough of the small crock of a vegetable ragout type sauce to save it. We did finish it, which tells you how tiny this bird was- with this amount of food on the table, imagine each of us eating four pieces of standard fried chicken. Relative had a risotto dish which she described as making better herself and other had the grilled lamb chops which he described as tasteless, without seasoning. Overall, the food presentation was just as pretty as Giada herself, but lacked the expected excitement and flavor she brings to her show. All four of us were disappointed with the meal. Hope the kinks work themselves out, but we won't be back to see it."

I have also dined in the main dining room on another occasion and also enjoyed the food, service and ambiance.\n The pasta is superb.. love the tortellini in the Gorgonzola cream sauce.  Everything from the antipasta to the final dessert was very tasty and cooked to perfection.  Our guests tonight said this was the best meal she had ever had."

            "review": "I can safely say this was my first time even remotely being excited to eat Italian food on the strip.  Currently the hottest restaurant in the city, Giada is bringing in the masses nightly.  I thought 90 days ahead of my 7th wedding anniversary would be adequate lead time for a 7pm-ish dinner on a Tuesday, but we ended up with 9pm.  Not a big deal.  That meant more drinks at the bar!  I had a few tasty \"Flash Gordon\" cocktails that made me feel semi-invincible; the sensation was unfortunately fleeting as I felt like Ming the Merciless had pointed his stupid ring to my head in the AM.  \n\nIf you do one thing above anything else with your time at Giada, my advice would be to wait for a premium table.  The hostess initially walked us to a less than favorable area with only a partial strip view.  Despite her warning that it could take half an hour or more for a better spot, we stayed strong and went back to the bar.  Luckily, she came back in less than 15 minutes and brought us to an excellent table with grand views of Bellagio and Caesars Palace.  \n\nLike Rod U. said in his excellent review, antipasti are where it's at.  If I could do it all over again, I would order more small plates of seafood, salumi, cheese, crostini, salumi, cheese, seafood and cheese.  The burrata was magnificent.  It was a creamy, mozzarella dream that tasted more heavenly as I got to the center.  Accompanying this glorious gift from cows with anything else more than olive oil, garnish and balsamic salt would have been offensive.  \n\nI had some serious doubts about the waiter's recommendation of the \"Prosciutto San Daniele\" since we recently had Carnevino's \"Prosciutto di Parma Riserva\", but that all went away when the first slice melted in my mouth.  As unimaginable to me as it could be, it was better than Batali's.  The waiter had tried Mario's as well and agreed. Not that he was biased or anything.....\n\nAnother highlight was Giada's signature spaghetti with 2 large shrimp, lemon and basil.  She really loves her citrus as it's all over the menu.  It was wonderful!  The handmade pasta was superb and the light cream sauce at the bottom of the bowl was well worth sopping up with the shrimp.  I am a huge sucker for fresh pasta.\n\nAlthough the \"Veal Chop Saltimbocca\" was an impressive looking entr\u00e9e in size, I felt it was underwhelming and quite plain.  This wasn't the kind of place that had salt and pepper shakers at the table, but I would have reached for some.  The massive leftover we brought home will definitely be getting some seasonal treatment.  The sauce it came with took it nowhere.  I wished we had given the branzino a shot instead.  At least the asparagus it came with was outstanding.  The wood grill brought out a whole new dimension of flavor to the standard upscale restaurant vegetable.  \n\nThe dessert cart they rolled out made final decisions tough but the strawberry tart, blackberry lime tiramisu and white coffee gelato (I'd bath in it) were great conclusions to an overall solid meal.  With dinner clocking in at almost 3 hours, Giada isn't a dinner before a show kind of place, this is the show."

            "review": "The best thing about this restaurant is the ambience and the decour but the best thing about a restaurant should always be the food! \nWe tried to walk in to get a table for four but they said that you needed to have reservations and the next reservation was three hours from now or we could sit at the bar. That made me think that if the restaurant was packed it was probably because the food is delicious or something so we decided to eat at the bar. The four of us sat in the bar area and the service was extremely slow there. I ordered the risotto ($28) which was very salty. My friend ordered the $32 pappardelle which was very bland. We also tried the tortellini which was probably the best thing we ate but, still just all right. None of us thought our food was anything to rave about. Specially when you are in Las Vegas paying $30 for a plate of pasta. Add a drink and appetizer and you are looking at over $50 a person for subpar food. The only thing that saved the meal for us was a bread platter that they bring to you which has breadsticks and a crostini as an appetizer. That gave this place the extra star because that was the best food item we ate. \nSo sad because Giada is always on tv shows so I assumed that she was a good chef."

The menu has a lot of options but we decided to go with the tasting menu because it had their best dishes. The tasting menu is $120 per person but you get a lot of food. We started with the antipasto of crostini, dates, and peppers. All were just ok but not anything I would choose to order again. Then came the pastas, you get the lemon shrimp or the vegetable bolognese rigatoni. Since there was 2 of us, we got 1 of each and we added truffle shavings on the rigatoni. Both were amazing! The pasta was perfectly cooked and deliciously flavored. I can't even decide which one I liked better. Then you get the main course and we choose the salmon and rack of lamb. The salmon had a light flavor but was good. The lentils that were in the sauce were bland and added really nothing to the dish. The lamb was delicious! It had a mustard crust and was just melt in your mouth good. And lastly you get to choose desserts from the extensive cart. I choose the chocolate tiramisu, lemon ricotta cookie, and white coffee gelato. All 3 were awesome! Overall, I very much enjoyed my experience at Giada's. I only knocked off a star for the antipasto and bland salmon sauce."

I order my favorite appetizer, the octopus, and it was tender with a nice smokey flavor. The yellow tomato soup had nice flavor. \nNow for the entrees and some small plate pastas. Seafood risotto was a little bland and a little watery. The salmon and Branzino were perfect. The lobster didn't come with drawn butter until we asked, bucatini good, and the spaghetti lemon shrimp, a signature dish was gooey. \nThe big change for me was the atmosphere. The music is now so loud we had trouble talking at our table. The Cromwell seems to have become much younger and the restaurant seems to be trying to follow. \nA side note, we left something at the restaurant  and found it impossible to talk to anyone there. The hotel nor the reservation service were able to connect us with anyone."

The whole atmosphere was fresh and airy. We sat in a beautiful booth that faced the Bellagio fountains. It was a stunning view on a beautiful afternoon. \nThe food was good. I wouldn't say it was out of this world, but it was nice. Two in my party had pizzas, one friend had the muffuletta and the other had a pasta dish. We all enjoyed our food. My pizza was nice, but not outstanding. It was very flling, but somehow I managed to save room for dessert. I had the berry crostada which was not very flavorful.

            "review": "I had heard that Giada De Laurentiis, the famous cooking TV personality, had opened a restaurant at The Cromwell and was mildly interested.  Then, when an article appeared in the Parade Magazine and both my mother and my sister became overly curious, I made a reservation.  And finally, weeks later, it was my turn to experience the divine.  We went in thinking we would get a few things and share.  Soon we were ordering the tasting menu and wine pairing complete with an autographed photo, souvenir menu and recipe cards.  I guess you could say we were \"all in,\" in poker parlance.  We began with the Antipasti:  Bacon Wrapped Dates (with spicy Italian sausage  gorgonzola crema), Vitello Tonanato (veal loin, seared tuna, caper aioli), and Baby Sweet Peppers (with goat cheese and olive tapenade).  Second:  Pasta (Rigatoni with vegetable Bolognese).  Third:  Salmon (pan roasted with summer succotash & whole grain mustard).  Dessert:  Banana ice cream, Chocolate ice cream, chocolate chip cookies, etc.--the nice man brought the cart and I wanted some of everything!  And he was a willing co-conspirator.  \nThe dining room is absolutely LOVELY -- fantastic in every way, maybe the best dining room in Las Vegas, and that is saying something.  Added to that, it sits kitty corner to the Bellagio and the dancing waters, which are magical to watch.  The table was a tad small.  A good thing for conversation but a bad thing for all the food and wine we ordered; we averaged three glasses of wine each on the table at any one time. Service was at a comfortable, relaxed pace. The whole time we felt like guests who were welcome to stay all night. The service was spectacular and the Manager went out of his way to greet every single customer.  The first salmon they brought me was stinky and overcooked.  They whisked it away and brought me another that was positively wonderful.  The wine-lady, Theresa did a good job, up until the point where she paired a $5 Nero d'Avala with the Salmon -- a total no-no.   Otherwise, her pairings were classic, just what you'd find if you consulted one of those phone apps.  The coffee was strong, but of good quality.  Seems that all these restaurants serve something called an Americano--espresso with some hot water added -- the stuff will stop your heart, after it races away.  \nAll-in-all the experience was outstanding -- Andrew and Nick did a great job of keeping it all well-paced and us well-fed and well-attended to. \nAt the end of the meal they give you a mini-ipad with your bill to fill out a survey, I think that is a bad idea because the time that it takes to do the survey could be used to turn the table over and get the waiting guests inside.  This is the kind of place that you want to go to at 5pm, if your reservation is for anytime after 7 you WILL WAIT!\nI have seen a lot of very critical reviewing of this place out there in cyberspace and in print.  I get some of it, but I think a lot of it is just unfair.  If you want spaghetti and meatballs, this is NOT the place to go.  But if you want a meal of well thought out quality food, cooked perfectly and FOR YOU, then this is a very worthy place.  Good for you Giada I wish you well!  At $550 for two, out the door, I don't think I'll be back soon, unless I can find a sponsor!"

And that was so true the first time we visited the restaurant in 2014; we sat in the lounge because the dining room was booked; Nicholas Cage and his family were there that evening.  The lounge area was very relaxing and the Italian Californian food was delicious, none of it very hard to leave on your plate.  The service was impeccable and the staff outstanding.  That was then - this is now.  August 2015 - we were looking forward to visiting this restaurant; we were able to secure a reservation in the dining area.  We arrived with anticipation of a great night ahead . . .  our reservation was for 8 pm; we were seated at 8:45 pm - the dining area was busy but not bustling... our waiter robotic; the menu lackluster and expensive for simple items that you can prepare at home for under $10.00.  It was freezing; the vent blowing cold air on us; the waiter robotically kept saying that they could not do anything because of the Casino.  Something was definitely missing and terribly wrong.  The waiter called the manager over and she listened to our plight and was just as robotic ... a lack of customer service which was very disheartening.  We left the restaurant and enjoyed an excellent meal at Gordon Ramsey's.  The service there was impeccable and the food delicious.  No airs, no snobbery.  Just very polite people making sure we were satisfied with everything.  What a difference a year makes.  It's too bad Giada's has lost its soul."

My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised by our Christmas morning brunch. I have only good things to say about my experience.\n\nWe made reservations a couple of days ahead of time and had our pick of times. I chose noon because I prefer to enjoy my holiday feast early in the day. We were warmly greeted by the hostess and taken to our table. We were seated next to the window which was nice for people watching.\n\nSince it was Christmas we were offered the regular brunch menu as well as the Christmas prix fixe menu. We opted for the Christmas menu since it offered a variety of dishes from the menu. \n\nI started with a drink called the Dolce Vita which was really delicious. It was nice that there were some interesting drinks on the menu that were alcohol free. Next up we were brought an assortment of pastries and antipasto. The pastries were out of this world. My favorite was the Nutella pastry because it was so buttery and flaky. The texture and taste were delicious. The antipasto included bacon wrapped dates, polenta, and goat cheese stuffed peppers. I don't usually like bacon wrapped dates, but these were amazing. The polenta was also very tasty. \n\nMy main entr\u00e9e was the Sausage and Eggplant Lasagna. This was served with a small arugula salad. The lasagna was truly delicious. The arugula salad had a nice dressing that was well seasoned. My husband had the Italian Chicken & Waffles. If possible, this dish was even better than mine. The chicken had the most amazing seasoning and crispy crust with tender chicken inside. The savory style waffles were good too. \n\nThe end to the meal came in the form of a lemon souffl\u00e9 for me and ricotta ice cream sandwiches for my husband. My yummy souffl\u00e9 was served with a delicious gelato. My husband absolutely loved the ricotta cookie ice cream sandwiches. I tried a bite and agreed that they were amazing. The cookies had a great texture and taste with delicious raspberry gelato in between.\n\nOur waiter was great and very professional. He was great at making sure we had full water glasses and that we had everything we needed during our meal. The staff also took great care to be sure we were finished with dishes before clearing anything from the table. All of our courses were perfectly timed. \n\nDon't miss the photo booth behind the black curtain next to the hostess stand before you leave! What a great idea and a nice memento of a nice meal."

(Chef Morabito was in charge of breakfast and lunch for over a decade at Thomas Keller's Bouchon, in the Venetian Hotel, one of our Las Vegas favorites.) In a phrase, we had a marvelous lunch! Giada's menu is very satisfying, with none of the \"Nouvelle Cuisine\" massive plate and tiny bits of food tendencies which still infect so many high-end restaurants. \n\nPortions at Giada are generous, without being overwhelming, and I particularly liked this celebrity chef's unpretentious approach to respected standards. My husband's lasagna was beautifully presented and tasted wonderful: \"smooth, flavorful, and perfectly satisfying\", according to the walking stomach. My polenta en cocotte with poached eggs, spicy sausage and cranberries was excellent, as well, and I sampled all of my husband's dishes, among them his chicken Marsala meatballs and ultra-airy crust Margherita pizza, which were top-shelf. Tiramisu came in a cup and was deliciously paired with a nice glass of Fonseca Bin 27, the sort of reliable basic Port my husband used to keep in his booze-soaked rooms at university. \n\nService was welcoming and efficient; Erin was enthusiastic and most helpful, a credit to both Giada and Chef Morabito. The tasteful light-colored room is attractive, with superb window table views of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. I want to see that famous water display from this perfect vantage point: we will return for a late lunch against the darkening sky.... Giada  is a really wonderful restaurant that delivers on the chef's promise!"

It's situated on the second floor of the Cromwell and is considered part of the Total Rewards family, so you get $1 off per entree if you show them your free membership card (and get points)!\n\nWe arrive a little early and had planned to order a drink at the bar.  The restaurant wasn't full - maybe 1/2 or so?  I noticed that throughout the night, the restaurant was never at capacity.  Maybe they do this purposely to allow for better service?  Anyway, we were seated only a few minutes after checking in, so we didn't have a chance to order at the bar, which looked like it had nice and comfortable seating.\n\nThe restaurant offers a tasting menu for $100 something along with a booklet of of a couple of the recipes and a picture of Giada.  I noticed they also did this at Gordon Ramsay Steak, too.  We declined and instead ordered from the regular menu.  We also noticed that their specialty cocktails were listed along with photos on an iPad instead of on a menu.  GR did this as well...maybe it's a new Vegas thing?  I liked it, though.  You don't order with the iPad, though, but order with your waiter.  We ordered:\n\n-Orzo Meatballs - Really tender meatballs (comes with five small meatballs).  Sauce seemed like regular spaghetti sauce but you could tell the meatballs were not your ordinary fare.\n-Lemon and Basil Spaghetti ($34) - The spaghetti was supposed to come al dente, but it didn't.  It was slightly overcooked.  Boo.  The two shrimp it came with were very large, sweet, and delicious.  However, the spaghetti itself was disappointing.  I could taste more of the pasta itself vs the sauce, which was a light lemon sauce.  I felt slightly cheated at the price and wasn't very happy with the dish. \n-Scallops & Crab Risotto ($32) - This was also very average.  My friend had been craving a good risotto after a while, but this just tasted like soupy rice.  The scallops were a bit on the salty side, and I think there were maybe three little pieces of crab in the rice.  It was decent but not as good as OC's Pinot Provence corn risotto I had a year or so ago.\n-Broccoli Rabe ($10) - My friend thought this was a bit too salty, but I though it was just right.  It was cooked nicely and had a slightly sweet chili flavoring.   \n-Chocolate Budino - Came chilled and was very smooth (thicker than a pudding and creamier).  Thumbs up.  The little sprinkles of pistachio crumbs were really good, too.  \n\nThey gave us a short of sweet sparkling wine as an amuse bouche, which I liked.  It reminded me of a light moscato.  They also give you three kinds of bread.  Our favorite was the big crispy cheese \"chip\".  Yum.  They also give you a platter of five different condiments like lemon butter (nicely whipped with a slight taste of lemon), dried capers, etc.  Cool!  Drinks were about $14 each.  I ordered one that was quite large and semi-sweet  (it was pink colored and not her signature cocktail).  It didn't seem to have much alcohol in it, but it was refreshing at least.\n\nUnfortunately, our entrees were lackluster and slightly disappointing.  We had a much better dinner the night before at Gordon Ramsay Steak, though GR was more expensive.  Giada's was no inexpensive meal either but just wasn't worth it.  Restaurant decor is soothing and nice - reminded me of someone's fancy house."

The waiters English was so bad we had difficulty understanding what he was saying to us. We made out what we could and order our first course. It took a long time to arrive but the city street view kept us entertained.  We order the second course of pasta when they arrived both were luke warm and the pasta was gummy (possibly from sitting to long) we only had a few bites. after that we never saw  the waiter again. We finally gave up on ordering the main course and flagged down one of the hostess to bring our check. The waiter dropped of the bill and said something (to this day we have no idea what) 200.00 minim to sit at the window and not even completing the meal was very disappointing. We received less service then on a counter at a Waffle House. By the way we are still wondering if the waiters accent and poor English was a put on."

We were tucked away in a small room so missed out on the beauty of the restaurant. We ordered 7 dishes and the portion sizes we're ridiculously small and so overpriced. I completely understand that you are paying for atmosphere and location but it was ludicrous. My friend ordered a side of Polenta and it was a 2\" scoop, lol. We laughed about it and when the bill came we cried.\nThe waiter was very unfriendly and didn't provide top service like you would expect at an upscale restaurant. If you decide to go get ready to empty your pockets, not happy."

But then you actually read the contents of the book and find yourself bored? Almost feeling tricked? Yeah. Maybe a little harsh, but that's how I feel about my recent dining experience at Giada's inside the Cromwell.\n\nI have to say I absolutely loved the ambiance. Such a beautifully decorated restaurant with warm coloring, soft lighting, and gigantic windows with a breathtaking view of the bellagio fountains & Caesar's palace -- the venue is a perfect scenario for a girls night out or a fancy date night. Our server was also very charming & friendly, not a single negative thing I can say about the restaurant itself or about the service... and that's where my 3 stars come from entirely. Like I said, the cover of the book was very intriguing. \n\nThe food? Same thing... absolutely beautiful presentation. But portions are very small, and I was disappointed by the taste of almost everything. Giada's Italian cuisine definitely has its own twist with Californian influences -- so it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. But for small portions I expect big flavor. Again, beautiful cover with a boring read. Nothing was noteworthy about this place to be honest... other than the strip view, enjoyable music playlist & chic ambiance. You're really paying for the experience, not the menu.\n\nOrdered:\n- ORZO MEATBALLS: $15. Four small meatballs in marinara sauce & parmesan pomodoro. (Very bland & unremarkable)\n- BACON WRAPPED DATES: $15. Five gorgonzola creme filled spicy sausages. (Only thing I semi-enjoyed out of our whole meal)\n- SPAGHETTI: $34. Two shrimp with a lemon & basil white sauce. (Decent dish, very citrus based)\n- RISOTTO: $35. Two large scallops with red king crab merus & peas/asparagus. (Scallops extremely salty, risotto extremely bland)\n- RAVIOLI: $36. Six small lobster filled ravioli with asparagus tips & tarragon. (This resembled a microwaveable dinner, so disappointing)\n- WHITE LASAGNA: $35. Two jumbo prawns on top of lemon ricotta & spiced tomato broth lasagna. (Very small portion, square slice)\n\n*We also tried to order the OYSTER CRUDO appetizer, but they were out of it... as well as the SALMON main entree. Womp womp."

I should have gone with my gut and gone to Olives or Tom Colicchio's restaurant instead!\n\n    It took about 10 minutes after us being sat for the waitress to finally approach the table. The restaurant did not have enough paper menus and they tried to play it off by giving us an iPad that did not have the entire menu on it. When we asked for menus they gave us one and said \"they are looking for more around the restaurant\". We finally ordered cocktails for the table and thinking that by ordering \"Giada's Signature Cocktail\" it would have the cute/fancy \"G\" that you see in the pictures. Nope, it didn't. When we asked why it was not there the waitress replied, \"They lost the G and haven't had the chance to find it\". The drinks took awhile to even come to the table and the waitress said that the bartender is backed up so she went behind the bar herself and grabbed the bottle of wine to pour the glass herself.  Perhaps she shared that information to get a bigger tip? It was awkward. As we were looking at the menu I asked for bread to be brought, her response, \"We normally bring that after we pull the menus but sure I will have Jacob bring you some\".  \n\n   We ordered the pizzette to start, it was boring and bland. They have a \"tasting menu\" but the waitress didn't even explain what it entails. However, we did see the dessert cart going around. However, you can only look and order from the cart if you have ordered this tasting menu. For our entree we actually all ordered the same thing, the spaghetti with the shrimp. The waitress described the dish and it sounded so delicious and was a favorite on the menu so we just had to try it. It was $32 for the dish and believe me, nothing to write home about. We expected a lot more and were left once again, disappointed. \n\n   Then our waitress brought the dessert menu. The espresso drinks were $13 and up and the desserts didn't really appeal to us. At first we ordered espresso and I asked if I could order the lemon ricotta cookie. On the menu they have \"Giada's favorite cookies\" which is a variety of cookies. I told the waitress that I wanted to just try the ricotta cookie and she said, let me ask my manager. At this point we were so over being there for hours, the slow service, awkward flow of the evening, and unimpressive meal we just wanted to get out of there and grab our espresso at Starbucks across the way! I decided to walk over to the waitress to cancel the espresso order and she responded, \"Oh man are you sure? I spoke to my manager about figuring out how to charge you for the cookie and he said that he would just take care of it! We know you chose us to celebrate your birthday and we want to do something special for you!\" I was like wow that is nice at least, we will take the cookie but still cancel the espresso. So then the cookie comes out on a special plate that says Happy Birthday and it was a good cookie, pretty much the only decent part of the entire meal. \n\n   Then we get the check, there are not enough pens for the table, not surprising seeing how the evening played out. When we looked at the bill they charged \"Open Food $2.00\". THEY CHARGED ME FOR A BIRTHDAY COOKIE AFTER THEY SAID THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT. WHO DOES THAT?! We just spent $190.00 on our meal and you charge TWO DOLLARS for a cookie?! \n\n   At that point it was the icing on the cake and I was officially over Giada and her lack luster restaurant. We will definitely not be coming back here! If you want to spend a lot of money for extremely slow service and an unimpressive meal than be my guest but I highly recommend staying away!!!!!!"

            "review": "Oh Giada. You let me down...\n\nMy friends and I came here for a late dinner earlier this year because our friend Crystal W. is a huge fan of hers and really wanted to try out her restaurant. We got there a little before our reservation time so we could use their photobooth. I love photobooths, so I was so disappointed to find out that their printer was out of ink/paper so we would only be able to email ourselves our photobooth pictures. But guess what? If you do the email option, you do not get a strip of photos... you get just ONE. We asked them how the printer could run out of ink and/or paper on a Saturday night because it seems logical that they would have stocked enough for the weekend, but the hostess said only that they ran out and she did not have any more. What makes the photobooth experience even worse is that the camera is horrible and unable to focus, so the two pictures that we took came out completely blurry.\n\nWe were finally seated about 20 minutes after our reservation time, at a half moon table facing the window so we had a view. The restaurant interior is very dark, which is good for ambience I suppose but horrible for pictures, at least on my cameraphone. Luckily my friend let me borrow her phone for pictures since her phone's camera does better in low lighting than mine.\n\nOur group of six shared the following appetizers:\n-- EGGPLANT PARMIGIANA FRIES: with pomodoro & parmesan fonduta\nThe fries were pretty soggy, but they tasted pretty good. The marinara sauce complimented them well.\n-- ORZO MEATBALLS: with parmesan pomodoro\nThese were just okay. Nothing special.\n-- BACON WRAPPED DATES: with spicy Italian sausage & gorgonzola crema\nI love bacon and I love dates, so I thought this would be a pretty amazing appetizer. It was good, but not that good.\n-- LOBSTER ARANCINI: with calabrian chili pomodoro & basil a\u00efoli\nWe all liked this one. I think this was RF's favourite appetizer. Pretty good!\n-- FRITTO MISTO: shrimp & calamari with shaved fennel & lemon a\u00efoli\nThere was barely any shrimp in this appetizer. It was mostly calamari... normal calamari. The aioli was good but they gave very little of it. This dish is basically overpriced calamari.\n\nWhile the appetizers were mostly just okay, we all loved the complimentary breads spread. Long thin crispy breadsticks, flat crunchy bread of some sort, along with freshly baked bread in a crockpot came out with lemon butter, fried capers, pink salt, basil oil, and red pepper flakes. That was really fancy and delicious! They definitely get points for that.\n\nWe then had the following pastas:\n-- RISOTTO: crab & scallops\nWe ordered two of these. JQ had one and Crystal and I shared one. It was pretty good flavour-wise, but it was not as well cooked as I would like. I like my risotto really well cooked so that it is nice and soft... and this was not that. But it still tasted good overall.\n-- FARROTTO: creamy porcini mushrooms, brussels sprout leaves, pomegranate, pecorino tartufo\nRF got this one. The grains were larger than we expected. The mushrooms are the dominant flavour of this dish and I thought it was just okay.\n-- PAPPARDELLE: pork ragout, parmigiano reggiano\nWe ordered two of these as well. KB had one and Crystal and I shared one. Following the theme of the night, this was cooked too al dente for me and I thought the flavour was just okay. Crystal likes her pasta al dente though so she enjoyed it.\n-- BUCATINI: calabrian chili pomodoro & fresh ricotta\nJP got this. Despite having chili as an ingredient it wasn't very spicy, as least according to her. She also found it to be cooked too al dente for her liking.\n\nWhile none of the desserts called out to me, our group ended up getting two:\n-- HAZELNUT CHOCOLATE TART\nI did not try this one because of the hazelnut, but Crystal was the one who ordered it and she liked it.\n-- LEMON BUNDT CAKE\nThank goodness this cake comes with creme fraiche, because it is dry! You definitely need to eat it with the creme, and it tastes pretty good when you do.\n\nOverall I found the food here to be pretty mediocre. Add in the high prices and it goes from OK to MEH and becomes a place that I cannot recommend and will not return to. Sorry Giada!"

We had reservations so we didn't have much of a wait (maybe 7 minutes), but we were told dinner reservations are 6 months out and lunch u can do walk-ins but you'll have to wait 30-45 mins.  Our lunch was incredible from the bread all the way to dessert.  I ordered the carbonara pizza and it was the best pizza I have ever eaten.  Someone in my party ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese, which was phenomenal and came with zucchini scapecce, which I had never had before but was awesome...I'd rather eat that then French fries!  Even the bread with the pesto spread before the meal was awesome.  As far as strip restaurants go, it was on par for pricing, if not slightly cheaper for lunch.  I can't wait to go back and try dinner (I should probably make my reservation now!!)  Wait staff was very good as well."

I won't get into our ordeal with trying to get reservations for a large group, that was another pain in itself. My most favorite part of the Giada experience was the bar; Flash Gordon was playing on the tube, the bar staff was friendly and informative, and they served an awesome drink called The Flash (Yes I'm a huge Flash Gordon fan).\n\nThe restaurant was beautiful. Our waiter was okay when we started the evening out but once he found out one of our table mates worked in a restaurant in Caesars, our side (not his side) of the table was almost ignored. The complimentary bread was great, loved everything in it.\n\nFor my meal I ordered the Spaghetti (with lemon and shrimp).  It was very average, the pasta was a bit over cooked. I expected it to be al dente, it wasn't. And the pasta was all stuck together with whatever they used to dress the pasta.  We also tried the Margherita Pizzette. That as well was very average and small. Another starter we sampled was the Bacon Wrapped Dates, they were okay, they were spicy as described, I have had better.\nMy husband got the Filet. Another disappointment. The steak was done as ordered but it came with a clump of maitre d'hotel butter that was ice cold and did not melt. \nThey brought around a dessert cart after our meal, the waiter was unenthusiastic about his job. We asked him multiple times to repeat himself because he was so quiet. For dessert my husband got the Chocolate Zabiaone, it was just alright, not quite what we expected. I tried the Chocolate Chip cookie, Peanut Butter and Jelly Cookie. Both were good cookies. \nWe spent a lot of money for a very average experience.  I doubt I'd go back but if I did I'd get the Rib-Eye, we had a bite of a table mates and was pretty darn tasty. But good steak restaurants are all over Vegas, don't go here just for that!"

Lemon Spaghetti is out of this world. The prawns are enormous. I went home and tried to recreate from her cook book and came close but no cigar. It is phenomenal. The Bronzino was so light and well balanced. I will have a difficult time deciding what to order when I return in a few months. \nPizza was also excellent. They are not huge so I would suggest apps and salads to make a meal out of it. Dessert cart comes around... Lemon ricotta cookies are a must. Take cookies to go if you are full. Finally, the quality of the staff is unparalleled to any other. Valentino and \"Turley\" will take care of you like you are guest in their home."

We had an early reservation (5PM).  We were asked to wait about 5-10 min for our table to be ready, but to alleviate the wait time, they had a (free) photo booth in the hostess area to play with while we wait.  You can either print pictures for free or email them to yourself.  I thought that was a cute idea and a good keepsake for your restaurant experience!\n\nThe restaurant itself is very beautiful, elegant, and airy.  It was bright and had great view of the Las Vegas Strip (particularly the famous Bellagio fountains).  I love how the fresh pastas, cheeses, meats, breads, etc were displayed Italian-deli style up front.  Every where you look, you will see Giada's name or her signature \"G\" everywhere (on chairs, plates, napkins, even on the pens they give you to sign your bill).  Seems a bit much, but I can't lie and say I didn't love it.\n\nWhile most reviewers criticized the service, I would say our service was great.  I like the iPad concept where you can visually see the drinks and appetizers without relying on the descriptions on the menu.  I ordered the signature Giada cocktail and my cousin and friend got some wine.  They served us an amazing assortment of breads, butter, capers, and pesto sauce to start off with.  That rosemary bread in the dutch oven was my favorite!  \n\nI think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because here is what we ordered between the three of us: Fresh Ricotta Crostini, Wood Roasted Mushroom Pizette, Arugula Salad, and Lemon Potatoes to share.  I ordered the Risotto with crab and scallops for my entree, my cousin the Tortellini, and my friend the Spaghetti.  I would say out of all our dishes that Spaghetti was the best.  It was light, lemony, and came with two HUGE prawns.  Plus the portion size was great.  You can tell Giada used her love of lemons to incorporate into her recipes at the restaurant.  I loved it. \n\nThe dessert cart was impressive, but by the time dessert \"rolled around\" (ha ha), we were all so full.  We picked a tiny little cheesecake to share between the three of us.  The cheesecake reminded me of cheesecake I've had in Italy.  It's light, creamy, but not very \"cream cheesy\" if that makes any sense. It was really fresh.  \n\nAll in all it was such a great experience, and I would recommend all foodies and lovers of Giada to go check it out!"

It tasted so good!\n\nI tried the Wood Roasted Mushrooms, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Arugula salad, and had the La Strada cocktail. I don't recommend the Wood Roasted Mushrooms at all because $14 was too expensive for something that didn't taste too special and came in such a small platter. The Bacon Wrapped Dates were my favorite out of what was ordered. It was very flavorful, but it was TOO overwhelming that I got sick of it after 2 pieces. The Arugula salad was pretty good too but it had absolutely too much parmigiano-reggiano which made the salad too cheesy. Although I really liked the candied lemon and pancetta in the salad. I think it would be hard to eat this entire salad by yourself because it's too cheesy. La Strada was easy to drink and fruity and sweet, but kinda too sweet.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed eating at Giada, but I'm not sure if I will be coming back. I felt like this restaurant was only good for tasting things and not so much for having an actual meal. I recommend coming here with another person or a group and share the food with each other. Most of the dishes are actually tasty, but can get overwhelming."

The restaurant is lovely with a great view where you can see the Bellagio fountains. Our server Rocco was amazing, very attentive and passionate about the items on the menu. He brought us a complimentary Prosecco which was a nice touch. We started with Tricolore salad, it was fantastic and quite a large size. Then we had the Lobster Arancini and the Fritto Misto. Both were very nice, the marinara that is served with the Arancini makes the dish it is light with a spicy taste at the end. The Fritto Misto has a very nice light crunchy batter, not greasy just right. My husband and I shared the Spaghetti and the Scallop Risotto. The Spaghetti was delicious and my favorite of the two. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the fresh pasta was great. The sauce is a creamy lemon sauce that is not over powered by lemon. I highly recommend this dish. The risotto was also great, scallops were cooked perfectly, and the risotto was nice and creamy. Only thing that I can kind of complain about is that they knew it was my husband's birthday and they did not bring him a little dessert but it's ok haha."

We started with a nice bread plate consisting of fried capers, peppers, olive oil and butter / cream. Delicious start. \n\nAs we wanted to keep it light, after ordering mocktails (birdie), we ordered chicken Marsala meatballs (delicious with a great gravy), baby sweet peppers with goat cheese, prawn linguine with a lemon cream sauce, and a margherita pizza. We ended with Giada's famous cookies and cappuccinos (delicious cookies - a classic chocolate chip, lemon drops, and raspberry Nutella chocolate). \n\nOverall, great food that felt right given the day. Ambiance was fun and lively throughout the night. Certainly a recommendation when in Las Vegas."

When the runner bought out the roasted mushroom in a small sauce size bowl, I asked him about the bread. He informed me that if I want it I have to request it from the waitress. After I asked the waitress for the bread, she told me that I have to waited 10 minutes for it. This is crazy, she should ask me if I want the bread or not at the time she took my order.\nBad:\nRoasted mushroom--$14.00 serving size 2 oz.\nMuffuletta---$16.00 bread is too hard and dry. Quarter the size of what I can get in New Orlean for $8.00\nPasta of the day--$24.00 plain pasta with tomato sauce serving size 6 oz.\n\nIf you need an expensive snack, go for it."

We ended with tiramisu, hazelnuts on top. It was good. I guess I just expected more. Maybe that's not fair but to spend $115 on lunch for small portions, when they make such a big deal about sharing/family style, it made me scrutinize the food. Oh, and the G on everything?

You're inside the Cromwell, which is a very stylish hotel.  You take this escalator up and the hostess station looks strait out of her Food network show's set. Once we were brought into the main dining area, WOW! , absolutely gorgeous views of the strip especially of Caesars and the Bellagio fountains. We were excited to get seated there and even though there looked to be available tables, they placed us in one of the wing corners instead. Not saying there was any discrimination but it was easy to notice that our corner was where all the minorities were and were minorities were getting seated. I didn't see any minorities in the \"premium seats\" in the main area even with available looking tables. #onlythefacts   2 star experience. \n\nOur server, Tim, was awesome just super hospitable. He knew the menu in and out and made some great recommendations, just very polished. 5 star experience. \n\nI really appreciate how the restaurant caters to vegans, vegetarians, and those with food allergies. 5 star experience. \n\nThe food was like lighter Italian. You're started with a bread basket filled with house made focaccia, lemon thyme flatbread, and some parmesan breadsticks. We shared a few things, Giada's favorite Mortadella bianca pizzette ($11) a pasta dish ($3X), ordered a couple cocktails off their ipad menu (Barbarella $15 - tanqueray, orange spice ginger beer, lemon, basil foam). Just nothing to get overly excited about. I guess it's a little better than the Olive Garden. 3 star experience. \n\nOverall probably 2.5. Wouldn't recommend it."

Most of what you heard is true. \n\nThe bad: Don't expect the servers to listen and actually know anything about their food. \n\nThis might not be an issue, but if you have allergies, BEWARE!  \n\nLovely thing about smartphones - you can see the menu even after they remove the real thing. We both ordered the brunch tasting menu, and noticed that several items had hazelnuts and almonds.\n\nAdmittedly, mine (hazelnuts) aren't generally life-threatening, but almonds trigger my husband's asthma. Not pretty in any case. I specifically asked our server if a particular menu item contained hazelnuts, or almonds, as WE ARE ALLERGIC to these items. We were reassured that they weren't in the items we had selected.\n\nShe must have a short memory. We were not give the opportunity to select our pastries, and out comes a lovely plate with five breakfast pastries. Two were beautiful chocolate mini cupcake looking items. I didn't think about it at first, because we had pointed out our allergies. Two of the five were hazelnut chocolate muffins. HELLO? Also on the plate were the rosemary berry scone (texture indicates more than just plain flour and butter as noted in the online recipe) and what I believe was the gluten-free blueberry muffin. If there is no wheat in the muffin, was it almond meal? I don't know, and I don't think the servers cared.\n\nThe busboy seemed to be new, too, and in boxing our leftovers, may have been neat in his placement of the items in the fancy plastic takeout boxes, but we won't ever know. He then put them on edge (not flat) in the smaller Giada bag, because \"sorry, we're out of the larger bags.\" Luckily, the fancy boxes did not leak!\n\nI was really disappointed in the level of training, given the great attention to the details in all other aspects of the restaurant. The food, the \"G\" elements EVERYWHERE, and of course, the high end price tag. It was amazing how much attention the half-shaven, tattooed hipsters with their Giada-esque ladies got, at the table in the middle of the room, while it took half the meal for me to get a single cup of coffee. Dad is 92 and on a rolling walker, but he certainly couldn't understand what the hoopla is about this place, and I can't blame him. \n\nBe ready to fight for your rights, or your allergies. They might just kill you with their attention to detail."

Definitely did not need 4 apps for 4 people - 2 would have been fine. Of the starters, the chicken Marsala meatballs were by far the best. The sausage was good as well, but neither the orzo meatballs nor the pizette had much taste.

This was among the best lamb we've eaten (yes, I ate one of the pieces).  \n\nDid I say the service was also top notch?  As busy they were tonight, our waiter Ron was on top of things.

Although Giada wasn't in the house, the staff certainly made us feel at home.\n\nFinally, they also serve complimentary Parmesan lavosh, rosemary bread, and breadsticks with the dinner.  Eating it with the pesto or the marscapone butter, which they provide as condiments, really makes a great addition to the meal.\n\nThis is certainly a celebrity chef restaurant that lives up to its reputation."

Definitely be sure to make a reservation way in advance if you're wanting anything between 6pm-8pm. And when I say in advance I mean months in advance. We booked about a month out and the only option we had was either 5pm or 9pm. \n\nYes the service is slow. Our entire dining experience was 2 hours total. But that's what exactly this is, an experience. If you're looking for a quick in and out, this is not the place you want to be.\n\nYes the portions do look small. However looks are very deceiving. Once you start eating, it is very hearty! In fact we had a difficult time finishing everything. And trust me, you want to finish everything because it's so good!\n\nNow onto the food:\n\n-COMPLIMENTARY CARBS: I have to say, these were so delicious! I could sit there and eat that all day. In fact we even asked to take it to go! Haha. There were 3 different types of bread that came with 3 different types of sides to put on. This here will definitely fill you up to try to control yourself!\n\n-LOBSTER ARANCINI: This was ok. Definitely tasted more of the breading than the actual lobster itself. Wouldn't recommend this.\n\n-PIZZETTE MORTADELLA: It was our fault for ordering this thinking the portions were small and that we weren't going to be full. This is a mini pizza but definitely skip this and save room for the main course. It was nothing special. Felt like lunch meat on puffed up pizza crust.\n\n-SPAGHETTI: Definitely get this! This was amazing. The size of the shrimp was literally the size of my hand. And it was cooked to perfection. Love the pasta since it was freshly made. Again the portion may look small when it's first brought out but I had to have my husband help me finish it.\n\n-SALMON: Definitely get this as well! Again cooked to perfection. The quality is that of sashimi. \n\n-ROASTED CAULIFLOWER: Various color of cauliflower, roasted just right. \n\n-GIADA SIGNATURE DRINK: They are definitely not stingy with the alcohol put into this. A beautiful drink. But not for me. \n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place. Get only one antipasti. A main dish per person. And I promise you your taste buds will thank you."

It was fine. \n\nThe overall service was a little awkward and not as smooth or polished as you'd expect from this calibre of restaurant. We were greeted pleasantly and then asked if we'd like a \"tour\" of the restaurant. This was basically our hostess parading us quickly past three or four prep stations on our way to our table, narrating them rapidly as she hurried down the line, tossing perfunctory explanations over her shoulder to us. We didn't even have time to look as we walked. It felt a little like a 5th grade oral report. It was whatever, but let's not call it a \"tour.\" The server was a little bit slow and probably should have picked up on some non-verbal cues--the ole \"craning my neck and wondering where the F you are because it's 10:15 PM and I am hangry\" thing. I think he was trying to be respectful and not intrusive, but it felt a little bit negligent at times.\n\nThe food was hit or miss, and overall, pretty forgettable. The only things that were excellent were the orzo meatballs and the salume pizzetta. The caponata was too sweet, the clams casino were fishy and salty (I guess that's a matter of taste), and the arugula salad can be skipped. I enjoyed the lemon spaghetti, although my wife found it too lemony, and the buccatini was spicy, but otherwise not complex or deep. \n\nThe view and decor are really something to marvel at, though. Too many Vegas restaurants are tucked away in a dark room inside a casino. Spectacular view of Bellagio Fountains, warm ambiance, comfortable chairs. \n\nGlad we went and tried it out. Probably won't be back. When there are so many exceptional restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas, I'd have a hard time justifying paying this much for an \"A-OK\" experience."

But was in the mood to mix it up. So glad we came!!!!\n\nI made a reservation about two months in advance via Opentable - asked for a table next to the windows so we can enjoy the view. They say us right away but at a table in the middle of the restaurant. So we went back and asked to be moved - said it would be 20 min. We had no problem waiting.. We wanted to take our time and enjoy the night. So sat at the bar and ordered drinks. \n\n- Hannibal cocktail 5/5\nThis cocktail was so yummy, huge, and very potent. My boyfriend and I each had two and became reasonably drunk! 100% would order again. And again. \n\nThey sat us at a table next to the window. It was perfect! Great view and a little more private because you're not in the center of the restaurant. \n\nOrdered a bunch of apps and pastas. None of the entrees jumped out at me. \n\n- Orzo Meatballs 5/5\nDelicious. Loved them  \n\n- Stuffed Dates 3/5\nGood. But nothing special. They were pretty big but easily forgettable. \n\n- Grilled Octopus 2/5\nEasily my least favorite. Nothing special. Sad bc octopus is my favorite dish ever. \n\n- Soup of the Day, Cauliflower 5/5\nWow! So flavorful. \n\n- Beet and Apple Salad 4/5\nVery bright and tasty. \n\n- Lemon Spaghetti w/ Shrimp 6/5\nThis earns a 6 because it was just that good!! I'm still dreaming about it. And the shrimp were huge!! And cooked wonderfully. A must order!\n\n- Risotto with Scallops 5/5\nThe scallops were out of this world amazing! Hands down the best cooked scallop I've ever had. The risotto was nice, but it's the scallops that earn the 5. I asked the waiter if I could order just a scallop entree next time, and he said they would try to make that possible. I hope so!!\n\n- Cookie Platter 5/5\nWe were so stuffed but wanted to try the lemon meringue cookies I've read about. All the cookies were amazing!!!! You get six - two lemon, two chocolate chip, and two peanut butter with jelly. So simple and delicious. \n\nWe're already planning on coming back for more shrimp and scallops!!\n\n*** side note: the floor around the bar is very slippery. Women, be very careful in heels!!! I saw two woman slip, including myself (thankfully my boyfriend caught me). The waiter saw and asked if I was ok and asked if I wanted to see the manager. I said no but a cocktail might help. But nothing! I guess I should of made a bigger scene... Lol"

Olive Garden serves better pasta and you can buy a grocery store pasta sauce that is much, much more flavorful.  This came as a shock as this is the Giada's restaurant! \n\n2. Service: Incredibly slow.  We waited over ONE HOUR for our entrees to be served! No waiter came to give us any updates. Once they did arrive, a few dishes were not even warm.  We ordered 2 cocktails which took so long to serve that we finished eating our meal in that time. After no word from them about our drinks, we inquired about them only for the to remember. We proceeded to tell them to just cancel it because we were already ready to pay our bill and leave.  After he acknowledged that, a few min later, someone came running with our drinks...probably so they could still charge us for them.

The host told us that wouldn't be a problem, except we needed to walk outside and have a seat until they called us back in. We were confused as to why she told us to go back outside. There were a few lounge type seats near the bar, so we decided to sit there. About 5 mins later someone came over to seat us. Then there was another 10-15 minute wait before a waitress greeted us. We ordered right away. Food took FOREVER to come. What was even more disappointing was that it tasted stale. The waitress also forgot to bring our tea/coffee. We had to ask a busboy to bring it out because she was nowhere to be seen. When she finally came to check on us we asked for water.

My husbands was well cooked but a terrible cut full of fat and the salmon our friend ordered was too salty and inedible   The potatoes that I had raved about were unevenly cut and therefore some were raw still. A shame \nIt's sad but seems like whoever was managing the staff and maintaining the standard is no longer there. Without consistency there is no longevity and it's too bad that such an inventive menu and great location just cannot cut it"

You get greeted at the door, and they bring you to the table and the staff is super friendly and the hospitality is #1. Avi the general manager came around and introduced himself and made sure everything is fine.  \nGiada herself made a round and I was able to take a photo.  Actually she took the selfie photo and was super friendly and sweet. She looked busy and she really cares about this place because she was talking to all of the staff. The staff knew the menu well, and gave great recommendations, and they knew their wine pairing s with the food.  They are super staffed and are alert on what is going on as in food coming on time, drinks being filled up, and the timing was all perfect as the food came out.  The pasta was fresh, the soup and salad was amazing and just the right portions.  Make sure you leave room for the dessert!!! They have an amazing dessert cart that comes around and everything was made fresh and healthy.   I had the polenta cake with the fresh coffee gelato. \n\nThis is one of the trendiest hottest new restaurants in Vegas. The best part of it is the location because you get natural light and it is not dark and dingy like the rest of the trendy Vegas restaurants.  The food is fresh, homemade, and amazing.  The best Staff! Super friendly and nice."

My rating is mainly based on the service we received.\n\nI am obsessed with Giada- I have been watching her on TV for years and I was SO EXCITED to try her new restaurant. The first thing I did after our plane tickets were booked was to go online and make dinner reservations here.\n\nThe location, ambiance and comfort level of the restaurant was excellent. The hostess gave us a warm and friendly greeting. They were 20 minutes or so late on seating us but the bar area was great and the drink server was super friendly and the hostess made sure to let us know that she had not forgotten about us. So far, so good.\n\nAs soon as as we were seated, it was like a switch was flicked. The atmosphere changed to being fun, vibrant and friendly to stressful, busy and rushed. Our waiter took an exceptionally long time to come over to our table and even when he did come, he seemed so busy and stressed that he could not take the time to actually greet us, go over the menu or offer any pleasantries. It felt almost as if we were bothering him because he was in the middle of something.\n\nMy mom and my fianc\u00e9 wanted some recommendations on red wine and the waiter sent the somm over. As soon as my fianc\u00e9 said we would be ordering by the glass or half bottle, the somm literally pointed out those sections on the menu (which we had obviously already found ourselves) and then walked away. I wish I was exaggerating or making this up but he literally turned around and walked away and never came back. It made us feel as if we were not good enough for wine recommendations because we were not ordering by the bottle. We told the waiter what happened and how upset we were and he did not offer any type of response and then a few minutes later the two of them were off to the side staring at our table and talking. I wanted to get up and leave at this point but the other people I was with were too hungry.\n\nThe rest of the night went the same way- slow service, hard to find our waiter, when he did come over he made the atmosphere feel rushed and unrelaxed and as if we were bothering him.\n\nNow for the food- I would say it was average. If this review was based only on food I would give it 3 or 4 stars. Part of this is because I don't think we fully understood what we were ordering- we ordered one of the flatbreads to start and it was not what we thought it was going to be. I probably would have asked for more help and recommendations but the waiter and especially the somm made us feel so unimportant so we just ordered, ate and left."

We passed the time in the photo booth (great idea and I give that part 5 stars.) We were seated fairly quickly and the restaurant was mostly empty. \n\nI ordered the lemon basil grilled cheese with prosciutto. The sever brought me a lobster roll. My friends orders were correct and by the time I got what I ordered my friends were half way done. Sandwich was cold and overly lemony. Server did apologize but no offer of compensation or perhaps a dessert. \n\nService was slow. Really overrated for the prices and I feel like I could have made the sandwich I ordered at home.

I've been to many gourmet restaurants and this place is just and insult to all of them. Not only was the food served at room temperature (which means it was sitting out somewhere because it was not hot), I felt like I was at a tasting eating crappy samples.\nI came to celebrate my wife's B-day, I called in a reservation and I requested a table by the window to see the Bellagio's fountain show (which many people recommend to see from the restaurant) ,I was told that to guarantee a window table there was a $100 per person minimum drinking requirement, otherwise there might not be one available. I took a chance and did not go with the guaranteed option but got one anyway, and found out that you can't see the fountain show because the view is blocked by the footbridge (and they don't tell you that). \nWe got the menu, the server was very nice, she explained the menu when we had a question, I order a glass of wine, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.  At this point everything is good, within 5 min from ordering we get the appetizers. We got 5 meatballs the size of jaw breakers and 5 bacon warped dates slightly bigger than the meatball. We started eating, then I get my wine glass and they served the \"one\" garlic bread which was the size of a biscuit (which was cold and salty). Not even 10 min go by and we get our entrees, LMAO, I've never seen a serving so small, in any other restaurant this won't even be considered an appetizer. Believe me when I tell you that a Lean Cuisine microwavable has more food than these dishes (and they were at room temperature as well, not hot). I do not mind spending money for good quality food no matter the size of the serving but the quality of this food was no better that a T.G.I. Friday's. I got the bill, looked at my wife and we couldn't stop laughing. We were not in this place for more than 1/2 hour and the whole time it felt that they were focus on getting people in and out quickly. The only reason why I give this place one star is because the waiter was the only pleasant park about the experience.\n\nGiada, I hope you read this because I open this Yelp account just to write this review,  you are robbing people by selling them overpriced below average food. We had high expectations because of who you are but your restaurant was the worse place we ate in Las Vegas."

The decor is light and upscale, but also feels comfortable.  I liked the waiting area (though it is a bit small) and especially appreciated the complementary photo booth - what a unique experience.  We were seated for our 9:30PM reservations right around 9:30.  Though we didn't get a seat right by the window, we could see the skyline pretty well.  There really isn't a BAD seat in the restaurant.\n\nOur waiter, Rocco was nice.  He was very classy and offered us suggestions on what to order.  I did at some points though out the meal feel out of my league in this \"fancy\" restaurant, but overall I felt welcomed.  The prices here are pretty high, but in line with other \"nice\" restaurants in Vegas.  I found the portions to be pretty decent... some smaller than others, but overall adequate.  Drink prices were very steep, as expected for a posh Vegas hot spot.\n\nThe Hubs and I decided to share a few things.  We had the bacon wrapped, sausage stuffed dates.  Yum.  Soft, sweet, spicy, these gems had it all.  Highly recommend.  For our entrees we got the lemon spaghetti and the veal chop.  The lemon spaghetti, though everyone RAVES about it, was a bit underwhelming.  The shrimp it comes with are HUGE.  I think I would have preferred a few smaller, regular sized shrimp.  The dish was lacking something... maybe some pepper or parm topping... not sure, but it was just ok.  The veal on the other hand was amazing.  It was huge and melted in your mouth.  So good... I would for sure get this dish again.  For dessert, even though we were stuffed, we shared three cookies, lemon, peanut butter chocolate, and chocolate chip.  The lemon was amazing as was the peanut butter.  The chocolate chip one was just ok... I'd say get two lemon next time.\n\nThe entire party walked away happy with their meal and experience.  I'd go back again in a heartbeat and try out some of the other pastas and appetizers.  Based on the long wait for reservations and how packed the place was I'd say Giada has hit it out of the park for her first restaurant."

We made our reservation about 45 days in advance declaring the evening as an anniversary and judging by the times still available through open table the restaurant seemed pretty open.   \n\nFirst we arrive and check in at the top of the escalator and are met by a gang of twenty somethings.  We give our name and they wish us a happy anniversary (this can only be a good sign I think).  Next we are left to fend for ourselves.  No one tells us where we can wait while they get our table ready (for a town built toward hospitality this is a Vegas first).  So we are stuck in limbo.  The tiny seating area with a photo booth is full (there are 2 other couples waiting).  So we decide to awkwardly check out the menu and some news articles down a hallway.  As we are mulling in the hallway there are other patrons arriving and they are being escorted to a seating/waiting area inside the restaurant (apparently one of the twenty somethings doesn't need twitter to communicate....I'll chalk that one up misfortune).  Eventually someone comes and gets us and our Giada experience is about to begin.\n\nWell, I wish I could tell you what the restaurant was like inside once we were seated, but instead we were seated in the bar area.  When questioned about the seating, one of the twenty something hostesses meekly grunts that this was all they had.  I should have used my angry/disappointed Emoji on my phone instead.  Maybe then she would have figured out the message.  So I get an awesome view of a bar and a TV with preseason football playing (not sweet).  My beautiful wife (a huge Giada fan, she makes me sit through all of her episodes instead of letting me watch football) she gets a view of a wall with 3 large paintings. It looks like she will have a huge portrait of the patriarch of the De Laurentiis family overlooking her every move tonight.   \n\nAs we sit there 3 other unfortunate couples are flocked to these 4 tables that should absolutely only used as the best bar tables and in no way ever be used as dining seats (especially when for a couple celebrating an event that made a reservation weeks in advance).  One by one we see the same disappointment on their faces as they realize they will be eating in the \"cupboard under the stairs\" with Harry Potter.  Let's move on shall we.\n\nWith that over and my disappointment waning we got to focus on the food.  We ordered a couple appetizers, the orzo meatballs and artichoke arancini. Score!  Our waiter proclaims those are his favorites (although, I did hear him say that to the other unfortunate souls sharing the cupboard with us....whatever I'm still comforted by the statement).  They both were good, but needed more salt and seasoning.  The arancini took the day.  Next we ordered the pappardelle and ravioli.  Both were good again, but served as an appetizer.  The pappardelle allegedly had pork ragout, but it seemed missing in action this night.  The ravioli was very good.  It was served with a butter sauce underneath and 2, yes 2 asparagus tips.  It reminded of me of eating a steamed lobster with warm melted butter, but with the lobster being wrapped in a pillow of pasta.  \n\nEssentially, everything on the menu seems to be served tapas style.  The only problem is that the price tag of $36 and $32 for tapas is a little ridiculous.  But hey, we are paying for the experience and it looks like the Eagles just put Tim Tebow in the game and though my wife never says, I assume the portrait of Dino remains unchanged.  \n\nOverall, Giada's was not worth it.  There are tons of Italian restaurants in this town and just value alone will keep us away.  Throw in marginal service and the fact I may be eating in a broom closet seals that. But, judging by how busy they were, they will hardly miss us. \n  \nFood:  3.5 stars (hey, my plates were clean when then took them away)\nValue:  1 star (proportion sizes don't match up)\nService: 2 stars (our waiter and his assistant moved the scale two stars from the zero star hostesses that only know how to communicate on a samsung or apple device).\nAtmosphere:  No star (having a preseason football game as my eye contact breaker was not what I had in mind for our anniversary.  Oh and thumping some J.T. like I was in a club doesn't seem to match the \"Giada\" brand)\n\nAnyways, finished the evening off with a burger and shake from in-n-out, so really how bad of a night could that have been?"

Our group was planned to be about 10-20 people. My fianc\u00e9 and I had great misgivings about the restaurant based on reviews we read on this site. However, about deliberations with our parents their wishes won out and we chose this restaurant.\n\nIn the sprit of full disclosure, we made a reservation 4-5 months in advance back in the summer. We attempted to make the reservation through Caesar's booking, and our experience here was terrible. We played phone tag and musical chairs with numerous people trying to book. Very weak service and little to no responses were the norm. We managed to finally get the booking, but still had doubts as to whether it was final and received no response from the person who made the reservation. Still we planned for the wedding reception to take place at the restaurant. We had been told we had a private room with a view of the Bellagio fountains. More on this later.\n\nWhen we arrived in Vegas, we made a trip over to the restaurant on the day before the wedding to ensure our reservation. After speaking to the manager, we were told our parties would be in the general seating area, not together, and waited on as if we were walk-ins. When told this was not what we asked for and would not work, the manager grew irritated. Finally, we were able to work it out to have the private room in the back behind the bar, with dedicated wait staff and a complimentary champagne toast and gift books for the couple.\n\nOn the night of the reception, we arrived in the restaurant and were seated promptly. The back room has no windows, but we didn't mind as it gave us a chance to talk and carry on as only an Irish wedding party could. The bride enjoyed the Animal cocktail, and the Groom had several of the Giada special cocktail, as well as a Flash Gordon. All are to be recommended. Drink flowed and so did the blarney, until the food came out.\n\nAnd what a meal it was! 5-6 courses over the course of 3 hours (6:30 to 9:30; I'm a little hazy on the number of courses because like I said, Irish). The first was an olive and cheese plate with little peppers and a delectable burrata cheese. The second were an antipasto plate. The third, small plates of meat. By this point I was already stuffed, and we weren't even halfway through the meal\n\nThe fourth, pasta, including a cheesy spaghetti with shrimp. The fifth was by far the best, with racks of tenderloin steak cooked perfectly, scallops, and roast chicken with a cacciatore on the side. Finally, a deliciously decadent dessert course topped the night. We cleansed our pallets with a salute of lemoncella. \n\nThe wait staff we had that night were courteous, prompt, and extremely professional. The manager the night of the reception took exceptional care of us. \n\nOur experience may not be the same as others. We had a large party, a private room, time to kill, and were ready to pay for the most expensive dinner option. Despite the difficulties in the planning of the dinner, the meal itself was exquisite, the service excellent, and all went away from the dinner that night having experienced a once-in-a-lifetime feast.\n\nWhat other choice is there but five stars?"

My mom and I came in for my birthday and we both did the signature tasting menu. It was a little pricey at $125 per person (for 4 courses) but well worth every penny. However, do be warned that it is a lot of food (antipasto, a full order of pasta, a full entree and then dessert) so go hungry otherwise you will end up taking some home. The lemon prawn spaghetti was unlike anything I had ever had it was simply out of this world. I was unaware that prawns that large existed! I had the farrotto and it was incredible. My mom had the salmon and it was cooked to perfection! Don't even get me started on the dessert cart. Such a lovely experience with so many options to choose from it was overwhelming but delicious. They even wrote happy birthday on the plate. The wine selection is well versed with lots of options to choose from, we had an amazing Italian Pinot Grigio however there was an optional wine pairing with the tasting menu but we chose not to do that. We requested a seat in the window and were not disappointed..the view of the Bellagio fountains was superb! Service was on point and attentive without being too overwhelming. All of the rest of the wait staff was professional and friendly with outstanding knowledge of the menu and where their products come from. Definitely the highlight of our Vegas getaway and we will for sure be repeat customers, the meal was simply life changing."

If I even considered dropping a star it would be for a the small menu selection, but everything I tasted looked and tasted outstanding. \n\nI had the Sunrise Polenta waffle (a must try). Crispy waffle, with slightly savory taste and served with house infused syrup and beschamel. My wife had the salmon eggs benedict. Both were filling and so flavorful. My wife also had the Dolce Vita, a great breakfast cocktail with elderflower. \n\nOur server/barmistress, Molly was bright, cheery and made recommended all the dishes we had. 100 points for knowing the menu, and great service. \n\nThey had these comfy seating, too and a great view of the Bellagio fountains."

Next was the pasta, and the lemon cream spaghetti with shrimp was fantastic.  For the main course I had a delicious rack of lamb.  The sweet corn with spicy sausage was our favorite side.  Finally, they rolled over the dessert cart and we each got to select 3 desserts. They told us to take all the desserts and they would pack up what we didn't eat. We ate a banana gelato and a polenta cake while we were there as we didn't think they would travel well and took the other 4 desserts back to the hotel, thoroughly enjoying them for breakfast the next morning."

From the bread, which was served with special dry dippers including salted Parmesan to the dessert, we chose the souffl\u00e9 w buttermilk gelato, we were moaning in ecstasy. We tried the calamari, which was the freshest I've ever had. We also started with the crostini with the roasted Brussels sprouts. We knew then we'd made a perfect choice. For our entrees I had the ravioli and my husband had the risotto. If it wasn't a nice place I'd probably have licked my plate.

Reservations for dinner are at least a week away which I don't understand as there are usually empty tables around. Maybe they don't have enough staff or want to make it feel more exclusive. We easily got a reservation for lunch, but when we arrived their system was down and said they needed to wait until it was up again as they had no way to confirm I had a real reservation. I showed them the email confirmation and they said they would seat us soon. We had to talk to them a couple of more times and they sat us when we said we had to be out by a certain hour. After that hiccup, our server was extremely attentive and the food was at our table timely. \n\nI was craving the baked pasta (lasagna for Sunday) but our server would not recommend it as it had mixed reviews from other diners and the kitchen was still modifying the recipe. I ended up getting the muffuletta sandwich and was underwhelmed. The bread was not soft and fresh, and the overall taste was nothing extraordinary. I got the zucchini scapecci as the side and this was my favorite part of the meal. My friend got the tuna sandwich which was better than the muffuletta, but be warned it is not fresh tuna. \n\nI would like to go back and give it another shot. The space and decor are beautiful but so far it felt like it was more about the celebrity chef than the food."

I love buffalo mozzarella,  but it is relatively bland and needs other flavors to make it pop. This didn't work. We couldn't taste the garlic spread and there was very little spinach. Our waiter was a nice young man,  but didn't seem to have a good grasp of the menu and our wine didn't arrive until our meal was almost finished. We won't be repeat customers.

            "review": "Had lunch at Giada on a Friday.  We had a reservation, but the place was nearly empty, so that wasn't needed.  It's large and it's appointed nicely.  I wouldn't think I would have liked the setting, but I did.  It has a large view of the strip, as it's right on the corner of Flamingo and Las Vegas Boulevard.  There is a lot of seating on the outer edge of the room, so if you want a view of the Strip, you should ask.  They can open the large windows, but I found that when you open the windows you pretty much just get traffic noise.  So, the views are interesting, but I didn't love having the window open.\n\nOur server approached us very quickly to take drink orders.  My buddies ordered specialty cocktails, including a bloody mary with a ball of mozzarella and a slice of sausage.  I didn't sample them, but everyone liked their drinks.  To start, we decided to go with the gorgonzola with pear honey, the orzo meatballs, and the goat cheese stuffed sweet peppers.  My favorite was definitely the gorgonzola with honey.  The honey was thick and difficult to spread, but it was fantastic.  The sweetness of the honey and the saltiness of the cheese was excellent.  The meatballs were a little disappointing.  We'd heard such good things, so we were surprised.  The orzo challenged the integrity of the meatballs, they kind of fell apart.  They weren't bad, but certainly worse than we were expecting.  The peppers were fairly straightforward.  No heat at all, I could have used more goat cheese.\n\nTo eat, I had the Venetian panino.  It comes with turkey, gruyere, fontina, mustard, and peppedew peppers.  This is one of the best pressed sandwiches I've had in a long time.  The bread is lighter than typical panini bread, and it was crisp, but didn't cut the roof of your mouth.  Often paninis have bread that is too thick or too crusty, but Giada's was near perfect.  The ingredients went well together.  The turkey was a tad on the dry side, but the mustard helped that.  The cheeses were fantastic, really tasty and melty.  This sandwich just worked.\n\nMy buddy ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese with added prosciutto.  I had a bite, and it was nice and caramelized and very cheesy, but too lemony for me.  The citrus was overpowering.\n\nFor dessert, we had the chef's trio of cookies.  I can't remember the other two  cookies, but the winner for me was a large warm chocolate chip cookie.  Slightly crisp, gooey, and packed with chocolate.  A little sea salt on top would have put this over the top, but it was a very good cookie.\n\nI would come back, I'd like to try dinner at Giada.  But, we were very pleased with our lunch and I absolutely would re-order that Venetian panino."

This tasted like a potato cake in ball form with lobster bites in it.

If you're debating between sides, try something unless you're really craving mashed potatoes \n\nVeal - No complaints here, exactly what I expected a veal cooked Milanese style to be.

OR if you really want the fabulous Strip view - go to Mon Ami Gabi or a Bellagio restaurant instead. \n\nAs foodie vegetarians, we are used to 5 star restaurants and paying for smaller portions of higher quality foods with stellar service, but this place took this to an extreme. We were intrigued by the lovely looking antipasto bar that is displayed at the front, and also because they profess to have vegan and gluten-free options. So on a slow Thursday night, we tried to use the online reservation system - but it was not working, so we dropped in around 8:00ish... They said they had no availability for the rest of the evening. Not even to wait for a table? They did not suggest the bar. But when we asked if they served food at the bar, they seemed as if they had never thought of this. And why... yes, they did. As we were guided to the bar, we saw many empty tables - WHICH by the end of our meal many were still were empty!!! And during this walk, not once did Scott?, our host, mention, that the bar did not serve the full menu.\n\nAfter we were seated, the menu seemed small by comparison to the food we saw displayed. We asked if there was another menu? We saw more selections up front. They said no, this was it. Later we learned after our meal - there WAS another menu, but they did not offer it at the bar. Being that the bar was so small (and there was only 1 other couple seated there - the place was half empty.), we were pretty incredulous that they would not offer a full menu at it.\n\nThe bar waiter seemed more interested in having conversations with the other bar staff then being a decent waiter. Several times we were sitting there trying to get his attention to get a water refill, get lemons, get bread, for a check, etc. only to have to flag down other bus and bar staff to get things accomplished.\n\nThe manager came over at the beginning of our meal and introduced himself, and again just before we left to ask how everything was. By that point, we didn't want to complain - we just wanted out...\n\nAfter dinner, we asked to see a dessert menu. the waiter said yes, and then never brought one over and or said anything else for that matter. Several minutes later, we asked again and he said, you have to wait to look at the dessert cart. I knew I had seen something on the menu posted out front that I wanted. I kept asking to look at a dessert menu and they kept saying there was none. Then I asked if I could look at the dinner menu again, and they asked me why!!!\n\nEventually one bus boy said, \"Well, I could go to the dinner table section and try to get you a paper menu. I said please do, but he promptly forgot and never did.\n\nAnother bizarre thing... I asked the dessert cart guy where the ladies room was. He said he would walk me over to it. I said, no thank you. Again, he insisted on walking me to it. I figured it really must be hidden or difficult to find? So he walked me over to the door in plain view just off the entrance. I did not require an escort.\n\nThe food flavor and quality was indeed 5 star, but everything else: 1 star.\nPASS."

            "review": "The food was amazing, can't complain one bit about any of it we enjoyed each item we ordered. The lemon cookies were my favorite! I left off 2 stars because we called and made the reservation 2 weeks in advance and advised we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and requested to sit by a window and to have a view because there are great views from just about every window seat in this place.  The day before our reservation the restaurant called and said in order to secure window seating we needed to pay $200 upfront and none of that was refundable if your bill was less than that.  Because I'm pregnant and can't drink and my husband is not a drinker I knew we might not reach that $200 so I decided to take my chances with possibly not getting the best seating but figured because we were going on a Monday evening it shouldn't be too busy and they could hopefully still accommodate our request.  Well when we arrived at 6pm the place wasn't packed at all and they still literally stuck us in a corner window away from the main dining area where all we could see was a high wall with an escalator outside the window and a wall right next to us on the inside.  Thank goodness the food was good because ambiance is equally important to me especially for the prices we paid and we were very disappointed with our seating.  I noticed the ideal seating where they could have sat us remained empty through our entire meal.  We definitely didn't feel like they cared much about our occasion or experience just getting that $200 upfront."

I had requested a table near a window but was seated in the middle of the restaurant with no apology or explanation. The waiter explained that we should order something from all 4 courses in order to have enough food. We ordered appetizers and then an entree. I ordered the veal chop. On then second bite I felt something cut my tongue. I then pulled out of my mouth a piece of serrated plastic. I called the waiter over who called the manger over. At this time my mouth was bleeding so they decided to call the hotel security and EMS. Over the next 2 hours I was questioned about what happen, filled out paper work and was basically left with no food. I was never offered another meal. The table was offered free desert and coffee. When it came time to pay I was given a check as well as all the members of my party for everything minus the veal chop. I was there celebrating my birthday but instead spent almost 2 hours  with security and EMS at my table.  my party got up and left with nothing else said to me. Why I still had to pay over 80 dollars and never had dinner is hard to understand. The customer service is terrible. I would not recommend going to eat here. If Giada had any class and cared she would have reached out to me to extend her apology. I still have the piece of plastic and wonder what it was from. Please do not support this business ."

We arrived about an hour early to check out the bar.  Our lovely bartender gave us the interactive menu.  We went with Giada's favorite - The Destroyer with Azul Reposado and Basil.  Delicious and refreshing!  Our server was Valentino and yes, he lives up to his name sake!  He was assisted by awesome Joe.  Muuuuahhh - we love you both. We started with Bacon Wrapped Dates with spicy Italian sausage & gorgonzola crema. OMG!  Next was the Crispy Oysters Rockafeller with baby spinach bread crumbs & pancetta vinaigrette.  Delicious! Our third appetizer was the Vitello Tonnato with veal loin, seared tuna, and caper aioli .  This was my favorite - the combination of the flavors was perfect!  They opened the windows.  The noise from the famous corner of Flamingo and LV Blvd actually added nicely to the atmosphere of the open dining room.  Before our main course, we were treated to a prosecco and St. Germain cocktail to cleanse our palates.  It was so delicious that I ordered one with Hendricks Gin!  My friend had the ravioli.  It was fantastic -  perfectly cooked pasta and filled with sweet lobster.  I had the Colorado (my fav) rack of lamb.  The lamb was perfect, melt in your mouth and not gamey at all.  The crunchy coating was delicious.  Our side was the asparagus with lemon ricotta.  Grilled perfectly!  For dessert, we had the three Tirimisu combo.  Heaven!  We order the Nutella coffee which was delicious!  Giada stopped by the table.  She is so amazing!  She hit the jackpot in Vegas with her first restaurant!  We are so lucky to have her!\nNote: I want those dining room chairs - they are sooooo comfortable!"

I'm a local and went with my girlfriends to celebrate publishing my first book. Really enjoyed the food, and our waiter was Tim, he was so nice and even wrote \"congratulations\" in chocolate sauce on my dessert plate. I got the bacon wrapped dates, Tricolored Salad, and the lemon potatoes. My friends ordered the Salmon and some Indian dish. All extraordinary! Yes it's VERY expensive, but typical for this type of venue. Our bill came out to $215, not including tip. That was for 3 people with 1 glass of celebratory moscato and a dessert to share. It's just as much as one would spend on the restaurants in Bellagio, but the view was beautiful, the decor was very clean, modern and beautiful as well. Wish some of the dishes were a little more resonably priced. But eh. It was all delicious and a very good experience. So much better than the other reviews made it out to be."

There were 8 of us (at one table and 10 at another) and the waiters charged us for 8 bottles of water. (I am assuming 1 bottle per guest). Guess what that cost, $64! SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS FOR WATER. And, when we got the bill, it was the first line item. He did that before we even ordered our food. We drank NO WHERE near 8 bottles of the water but whatever. For this alone, I wont come back. I made sure to put it on the survey you are able to leave when you get the bill.\n\nOn to the food......was let down to put it nicely.\nfood, eh. i like her recipes, i've tried literally, a hundred, and i was so diappointed that this food was just eh.\nnothing stood out as amazing. it was good, for sure but not amazing. fell short in my opinion. We ordered the large antipasta. It was good, but not spectacular. We all ordered entree's and or a bunch of appetizers for dinner. Again, nothing really stood out. It was OK, but I like her recipes from her show SO much better.\n\nThe handling of reservations was also a fiasco. There were 18 of us and reservations were made weeks in advance. They were pushing us to get a tasting menu that everyone had to order from (it didn't look great). We were finally allowed to get 2 tables, 1 for 8 and 1 for 10 but it seemed like a lot of work went into that. Dont you people WANT money to pay the bills? You wanna bust balls when 18 people want to come here and eat your food? So between, the water charge bullshit, the reservations annoyance, and the lackluster food, I wouldn't come back. I also think it sucks that they didn't contact me after I did the survey. I guess they dont care if customers are happy or not.\n\nWhat would Aunt Raffey think?"

But the pasta was freshly made.  \n\nDid I mention we went for brunch?  There are no brunch items.  There is a lunch menu and a dinner menu.  Weren't aware of that going in.  Pasta at 9am is a bit strange...but I'm Italian, so I'm game.  \n\nThe portions are small.  Also a Giada trademark.  So if you are starving and a foodie and don't want to pay $40 for a tiny bit of pasta...then this may not be the place for you.   That said, overall it was good. \n\nWe were extremely impressed with the management.  While waiting, a waiter sneezed and covered his mouth in \"vampire\" fashion.  The manager told him to wash his hands very strictly.  He tried to explain that his hands didn't touch his mouth, but before he could finish, the manager in unison with another of the wait staff said again, \"WASH YOUR HANDS.\"  Cleanliness is much appreciated and often overlooked!"

We got:\n\nBacon Wrapped Dates: with spicy Italian sausage & gorgonzola crema $15-a lot of flavors going on here. You get a mixture of the sweetness from the dates and all the savory goodness from the bacon and a small hint of Italian sausage.\n\nSpicy Italian Sausage Arancini: with parmesan fonduta & pomodoro sauce $16-this tasted like a fried mac n cheese ball to me.

Didn't really taste any Italian sausages though. \n\n\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered:\nFregolotto: with roasted rainbow cauliflower, garlic pur\u00e9e, parmigiano, kale pesto, crispy prosciutto $28.

The flavoring could be a bit more, but once I added some crushed red peppers, boom! the flavor and the added spice was perfect!\n\nBarolo Braised Australian Wagyu Beef Short Rib: soft polenta, garden vegetables $52.-Boyfriend was obsessed!!! He's a big short ribs fan so when our waiter introduced a few of the dishes to us, this caught his attention and immediately had his heart set. However....he's someone that doesn't bother looking at the price so when our bill came, he was a little taken back by how much this dish was.

The bread literally will melt in your mouth! \n\nHubby and I like small plates so we did a tapas style dinner.  We started with the bacon wrapped dates with spicy sausage!  I usually do not like anything with heat, but this brought the right amount of taste without overwhelming me with the spice.  Finished with a Gorgonzola  cheese it was pure heaven to my taste buds.\n\nNext we had the Tricolore prosciutto di parma, gorgonzola, dates, walnuts, Tuscan kale, yellow endive & radicchio.  All of the flavors combined to make this a light but incredibly tasty bridge from the dates to our entrees.\n\nWe ordered spaghetti and ravioli as our main dishes.  The ravioli featured lobster that tasted like it just came from the docks with a creamy butter sauce....perfect!  The spaghetti had a light lemon taste making the dish taste light instead of the heaviness you sometimes get with pasta.  \n\nThe vibe was trendy (music was just a tad too loud) and upscale without feeling pretentious.  Hubby wore jeans and a dress shirt and I wore a dress (hey you gotta dress up in Vegas) but i would say the code is dressy casual.

I flew to Las Vegas from TX for this party and was on my way to the Cromwell when the restaurant called to ask if we could make our reservations for another day.  I immediately let them know that was not possible as this as a 60th birthday party and had been planned for at least a month.  The hostess that called said they had a problem in the kitchen and had to cancel our reservations.  Evidently there was a pipe that burst.  i asked what time the restaurant would open and the said 5:30.  I replied that we would change our reservations to 5:30.  She said that was not possible because 5:30 already full.  I could not believe her lack of empathy and respect for me as a customer.  She informed me that I could come but I would not get a table.  There was no accommodation at all, no offer to find another restaurant in the hotel, or in the area, nothing.  She was cold as ice.  So here we are Easter weekend, at 4:30 on a Friday, trying to scramble and find someone where to host a party on the LV Strip.  To make a long story short, we ended up having to call everyone and we had to go to a local restaurant off the strip that was nothing special.  It was a totally disappointment.  I don't believe she wants hername associated with a restaurant that doesn't know who to speak with,  nor treat customers."

I was so excited to try her restaurant. \n\nThe service was excellent! \n\nThe food was delicious but extremely rich. My sister and my mother got sick. \nMaybe, if you only take a bite, like how Giada eats, then maybe you won't get sick. \n\nThe Meat and Cheese Board is to die for! It's a must have to start. \n\nThe Shrimp was incredible in one of her famous dishes, The Spaghetti (Shrimp, Lemon, & Basil). However, the sauce was way too much, it was too buttery, creamy, cheesy. What ever happened to a little olive oil and lemon? This was way to rich and took away from the flavor of shrimp. Sometimes, the simpler the better.  \n\nDo not get the Rigatoni (Vegetable Bolognese) I think this is the dish that ultimately got my sister sick. I took one bite and it was whatever.\n\nThe Cookies were Spectacular.\n\nMaybe my expectations were too high."

I truly appreciate their kindness.  \n\nHaving never eaten nor heard of this business I did not know what to expect.  Well what I got was one of the best meals I have ever eaten.  Following my servers recomendation I had the Caesar Salad and the Lemon Pasta.....both were so good!  I also enjoyed the appetizers and the bread.

            "review": "We dined at Giada last night. Had a lovely table in the garden area overlooking the strip. Though we had reservations when we arrived that the hostess told us it would be about 10 min. Not complaining,  just want to make you aware as the bar is very crowdedand the space is not conducive to stand around the bar. Too much traffic from the kitchen. One thing I really liked is there is a free old fashioned photo booth in the reception area though the printer was not working so the only option is to email or post the photo. Strike two.\nCliff was our  waiter and was excellent. He was very professional and courteous. He even brought us a complimentary aperitif we had inquired about when he noticed we were waiting an exceptionally long time for the sommelier to bring the bottle of Rombauer Chardonnay we ordered. Plus one for Cliff -3 for the rest.\nTo add to this without being ridiculously lengthy here. ..we waited way to long for our food. It was a Wednesday night. Can't imagine how crazy this would be on a weekend. When our dinner arrived the flavors were wonderful but my shrimp was over cooked to the point of being rubbery. There were only two shrimp on a $34 plate of pasta making this even more disappointing.\nNonetheless we enjoyed our experience here and will give Giada another chance. She is really onto something and the energetic vibe is great but the place needs better kitchen management and more staff to improve quality and experience."

I had been told by several friends that it was impossible to get a reservation, which I truly don't understand.\n\nThe view is nice but significantly lacking from the one at Paris or Cosmo, mostly due to the fact that the restaurant is on the 2nd level and not much higher. The Bellagio fountains are obstructed by the crosswalk bridge over Las Vegas Blvd, so not my much of a view. I probably saw more weirdos on the strip my whole meal more than anything else.\n\nThe service was ok but considering this is a fine dining establishment my drinks were not refilled during the meal & I actually had to ask a busboy to do it. I ordered an entree and an appetizer. The bacon wrapped dates were very good $16 for 5. However, my entree was terrible! Small plate of whatever it is that I had 3 bites of and left. Cost $28 and was a complete waste. The only thing that kept me from going home hungry was the complimentary bread with a variety of salts and butter. \n\nDefinitely would not come back."

It had become my new favorite LV restaurant, however a couple of things have knocked it down.\nLast September I made a reservation on Open Table and requested a window seat \"if possible\".  I received a phone call telling me that to guarantee a window seat my husband and I had to sign a contract guaranteeing that we would spend $100 each.  And we signed..so shame on us.  That night I kept saying \"order this....get that\" making sure we made our $200 minimum.  I don't know if they have continued this practice, but it's wrong.  The restaurant is beautiful but the view is not special....yes you can see the fountains but they are across the busy strip.\nBut I found myself in Vegas last week and we made a reservation for Friday evening, but did NOT make any special request.  And where were we seated? Table for two at the window!\nBut we sat.....and sat.....and sat....no water was poured, no menu to look at..no drink order taken.  When we finally got some attention, the specials were pushed....we ordered chicken Marsala meatballs, bacon wrapped dates, tortellini in lemon pesto sauce, and risotto.  Appetisers came first, then the bread and cocktails....everything was \"off\".  Food was good, portions small for the $.  No complimentary cookies, no dessert cart.  I like Giada and used to like the restaurant but had an amazing experience earlier in the week at Carbone so no need to return unless the restaurant returns to the way it was when it first opened."

            "review": "Short and sweet: the food is really good, but it's not worth the money. You're mostly paying for the novelty and celeb chef restaurant experience. \n\nExtensive wine list, sommelier on site, but prepare your checkbook for the wines. Almost all wines are three or four figure prices. You can find a bottle or two for around $70-80 though. I like to share two or three bottles per dinner so that I can start the night with a buzz as opposed to the feeling you get after a coma-inducing meal (re: \"the itis\"), but my budget only allowed for one bottle which was nursed slowly over four courses. The itis ensued. \n\nYou can order off of a tapas-style small plate menu or opt for Giada's menu which she offers her house guests. We did Giada's menu which included a shareable antipasti plate, a tiny pasta plate (can be a let-down if you're a big pasta lover like me!), an entr\u00e9e (I did the rack of lamb- amazing), and three mini-desserrts per guest. The cost of this tasting menu is $120/person.\n\nThe service, although not bad, did not not match the price. Nothing special about the service, our waitress wasn't extraordinary like the bill. I'm sure this varies server-to-server though. \n\nImportant note about how you like your steak cooked: my date ordered the beef tenderloin for her entr\u00e9e, cooked medium-rare. She is not one to send back food, but at this price, you might as well make sure it's right. The steak was rare in our books (red center). She sent it back and they cooked the same steak longer, but not long enough to cook it more. It was simply warmer, the color didn't change. Hesitating and trying not to be an ass, she sent it back again, and they agreed to cook a whole new steak. Third time's a charm: it came medium-rare (to our standards: warm pink center). There seems to be varying definitions of steak done-ness, but what happened with my date can be avoided by communicating to the server exactly how you would like your steak to look. I'm pretty surprised they didn't start a new steak the first time she sent it back and that they didn't cook it enough to add more color. \n\nWould I go back? Yes, but only if I'm rich enough that dropping $1000+ for two ain't no thang. So, no, I wouldn't. (We paid around $500 after tip, and I really wanted more wine. Maybe tapas is the way to go instead.)"

We are all excited to try this place, the waiter comes over and introduces himself asks if we want sparkling or plain water asked about wine cocktails, etc etc.   We get our drinks ordered and order a couple of the platter style appetizers.   That was the last pleasant experience we had.  \nWe were brought our bread on the board, the slat bread fell off the board onto the table with no linens on it and the server picks them up with her hand and puts them back on the board\nWe were never brought a plate to place our bread on while eating\nWe received our soups/salads, by a very flustered server who we had to tell what person ordered what.\nWhen we were done with our soups/salads the staff just took our silverware off the plate and placed on the table.  There are no linens on the table.  Why are we not getting new silverware with each course.  \nThey staff never cleaned the table between courses either.  So if someone dropped something on the table during bread service, appetizer service, or salad and soup service it was going to stay there the entire meal.  Again, how much am I paying for this?\nStaff was horrible about refilling water glasses, had to ask multiple times when we could find someone that we needed more water. \nOur meals came, our sides came, no plates to put the sides on again though.   We had to ask the staff to remove the bread board to make more room on the table, and they seemed irritated to have to remove them.\nDesert came (Souffl\u00e9, Chocolate Tart) we were sharing around the table, no plates again.   \nI finally see our original waiter and tell him what horrible service we had and he told me the reason our service was bad was because his \"helper\" went home sick and he had to do it all himself.  \nOur bill comes I see that we are being charged for water.   Water that we had to keep flagging down a waiter to give us.  I go and speak with a manager named George, who tells me they are very busy tonight and this excuse and that excuse, and that I should write a honest review about the experience and he would take a look at my bill.  He told me he would be right back.   5-7 minutes pass and no George.  I ask the hostess where George went she said Oh he hasn't came back yet, I said no, she was like oh here is another one of my managers (Female didn't get her name) She said he will be right up.   Waiting around, Geroge comes back up and says he took 20% off the bill (Which would cover the tip) and took water charges off bill, shows me the bill, and the 20% off was there but the water was not credited.  He said Oh I thought I did that I am sure I did that it must just be on another receipt.  At this point I am done my clients are done, I think Geroge is done.  \nI have never had such a bad experience at a restaurant.   The fact that there is the Giada name on this restaurant, one would think the service would be up to par that is associated with the name and the prices being charged."

But still delicious and worth it if you can afford it. Giada is no different.  \n\nThere are simply some restaurants in Vegas that are in different categories of price levels and we need to understand that. You take a restaurant like Giada, which is quite expensive but easily accessible to anyone who wants to get in. Compare that to Robuchon which is uber expensive and impossible to walk in without a reservation months in advance. Yet there isnt a single person reviewing Robuchon and saying oh wow it was pricey even though its 500 a person. There's a reason for that and it's that the kinds of people who take the time to go to Robuchon have never thought price points were a relevant criticism. And if the food is good enough, as it is at Giada, neither do I. \n\nThe menu items have in some ways changed a lot since I was there as a few things I ordered are no longer on the menu but I will address them anyways.\n\n-Mussels. Not the same as they are on the menu now but very delicious and cooked perfectly. Very natural flavors.\n\n-Prosciutto crostini. Not on the menu anymore and the weakest part of the meal. Pesto a little bland but the prosciutto made up for it\n\n-Pea Soup. Also not on the menu but OMG this was amazing and the best part of the meal. It's similar to the butternut squash puree on the menu now. Had a lot of ingredients including crispy prosciutto but it was a mind blowing cold soup.\n\n-Bucatini. Awesome. A truly fresh and light pomodoro pasta.\n\n-Pappardelle. Oh god it was so good. The pork ragout was nuts.\n\n-Surf & Turf. This was honestly a bit of a shocker because I wasnt expecting a filet to be top tier at an Italian restaurant but it really was. A great filet and the surf, I think it was lobster then but now it's shrimp, was delicious and buttery.\n\nThere's just no defense of a 3.5 average review of this place. Complaining that the pasta side dish is 30 dollars just doesn't cut it for me. I get for some that's a deal breaker and ultimately that is the problem. The pasta section doesnt say side dish or appetizer it just says pasta. I can see plenty of orangoutangs getting drunk in the casino, walking in, ordering a 30 dollar pasta dish and getting drunk angry when they realize it's a side dish meant for sharing. Maybe the waiting staff could do a better job conveying this to its customers or you could just recognize that there's a reason why there's 'mains' section and a 'pasta' section. The implication being that the PASTAS ARE NOT MAINS.\n\nIt is so good. Don't listen to the haters and just go. Don't let your wallet ruin a perfectly wonderful dining experience."

So, I booked a reservation on OpenTable about 3 weeks out, scooped up 6 folks, and headed to the Cromwell. \n\nFacility:  it's best to come in off Flamingo and use the parking garage or park in Valet as I did. Then it's straight ahead, until you see the escalator on right. Then it's at the top. The restaurant itself is beautiful!  The chairs are comfortable, attractive and vary depending on the table size or area you get. They have some round and square tables and bar seating.  The decor is a very trendy, modern look with Italian influences around the cooking area.  I loved the fire oven for the pizza, fresh drying pasta and antipasto display cases.  \n\nService:  Wasn't too impressed with the hostesses, but the wait staff was pretty good. Christopher was a great waiter, who was very knowledgable and friendly!  He took pictures for us even with no complaint or sign of impatience. I was a little thrown that they support wait staff took the $70 salami plate with food on it when I was in the bathroom. I would have loved to take the leftovers home. Also, maybe Christopher got busy, but at the end, he handed cash change to someone (the wrong person), and then set the rest of the tabs in the middle for us to look through and figure which one was ours.  I've never seen that in a restaurant before. Like I said, maybe he got sidetracked or busy. \n\nFood:  I was pretty impressed with this place. I know some YELPERS had some bad food, but ours was great!  I started with a white sangria (4/5), which was refreshing and delicious. We ordered a meat and cheese plate for 6 to share. Then we each ordered a lunch plate. \nMeat and Cheese platter (5/5) for 6 (not on the menu) - It was a little pricey, but it was so cool to try all the meats and cheeses. It had the 4 meats offered in their appetizer section, along with Gorgonzola, Truffle Pecorino, and Parmigiana Regiano. It had an infused honey, with actual pieces of honeycomb. Loved this platter!!!! \nLemon Pesto Grilled Cheese (3.5/5) - this was very good. It looked more like a spinach sandwich because there was so much pesto, but it surprisingly did not have an overpowering basil flavor, which I was worried about.  When you bite into a tomato, it really completed the flavors. Not sure how much lemon I tasted. I got the zucchini strings (3/5) on the side. They were good, but lacked some zucchini flavor and a tad greasy. \nLobster Roll (4.5) - shared with my neighbor and I loved this!!!!  But lobster is my all time fav food. Tons of lobster and not just salty claw side of meat.\n\nOverall:  I enjoyed the lunch. I lived the atmosphere, I loved the decor, the service was great, and I liked my food. 4 stars for me!  :)"

The bad: food sucked (yes it really did), the portions are shockingly small, the price is out of control, and the worst part is it's extremely slow service (for everything).

Was totally on edge after reading the recent Yelp reviews about lousy service and mediocre food because we were taking friends to dine and I basically pushed the group to eat here. I didn't want a crappy evening to sour our mood. Thank God our experience turned out great! \nWe arrived 20 minutes early for our 7:15pm reservation & the hostess says she can seat us right away. The hostess is totally pleasant and makes small talk while showing us to a table. Right away we are met by our server, Rocco, who proceeds to take excellent care of us right straight through from appetizer to dessert. One of us has an intolerance to onion. Undeterred, Rocco talks to the chef about each item that may or may not contain onions - we appreciated that Rocco cared enough to go that extra mile. We ordered the large antipasti for the table ($69). I love antipasti platters and this is, by far, one of the very best examples of antipasti I've ever had. We probably could have (should have?) stopped after this gargantuan platter and the bottle of Barolo ($150) but we didn't. 2 orders of Barolo Braised Waygu Beef Short Ribs ($52 each), an order of veal chop Milanese ($50?) and an order of the lemon spaghetti with shrimp, and we were stuffed to the gills. We still managed to scoff down the white coffee gelato and a plate of Giada's favorite cookies. Rocco is a sweetie. Ask to see a picture of his French Bulldog, Ginger ;-) We loved how engaging and chatty he was. He was also incredibly knowledgeable about the food, wine, cocktails, desserts...All I can say is that fantastic service makes all the difference, but combine that with fabulous food and wine and this was one of the most memorable dining experiences we've ever had. Two (or eight?) relieved, enthusiastic thumbs up."

The ambiance real nice, loved the spacious round table and comfy upholstered dining chairs.\n\nI ordered the romaine salad with fried capers and vinigrette Caesar. It was dressed well not saturated I liked the flavor. Missed the fried capers, too few to be memorable. The two croutons sucked and may as well been left off. \nThe bucatini was alright. Again I liked it but not for the price.  The al dente stuck to my teeth and not in a good way. Lacked sauce!!!    \nThe ricotta was a teaspoon Seriously!!\n\nHusband had the lobster ravioli and liked it. \n\nThe service was great! \n\nSo, if you like small portions(trust me, you won't need a doggy bag here) and care less if there's  any yummy sauce to mop up.  Bread was more like a soggy garlic ball and not crusty, too much Rosemary . Then there you go, it's pricey, it's in the strip and we've been there and won't likely return."

The food was quite good as well - we shared the tricolore salad, the orzo meatballs, the sweet pea tortellini and the zeppoles.

I absolutely love it, it's all in the details! The ladies all wear white eyelet dresses while the men wear checkered shirts with a navy tie. Not too bougie but just right. Up the escalators and to the left there is a small photo booth to mark your experience, take note! \nWe came for lunch.\nWe tried the white and red sangria to start, red is better. \nThe meat and cheeses can be made into a platter, the $65 platter allowed all 7 of us to have a good portion of three cheeses and four types of cured meats. The house bread and pesto sauce is an honorable mention because we requested more pesto to dip our pizza crusts into! We got the mortadella, carbonara and salumi picante. No complaints. Each pizza is enough for one hungry person or two not so hungry people. \nThe salads were a hit or miss though, as everyone loved the arugula salad and no one wanted anything to do with the kale salad. It ended up in a box to go and then someone's fridge and probably in the trash. \nFor sandwiches, the muffuletta and lobster roll was a favorite, but the tenderloin sliders were dry. \nLastly we shared the baked pasta which is a lasagna, good enough for two people and it's highly recommended. I only wished I left more room for it! \nSince it was my birthday, 6 baked cookies were brought to the table. Not sure if it is on the dessert menu but the chocolate chip, lemon and chocolate peanut butter are just fabulous! Definitely coming for dinner to try the evening menu.\n\nOh, and the crowd is 95% women in their 40s+"

The risotto itself was overcooked and totally lacking in flavor. Overall, very expensive with not so good food"

The restaurant is very homey and welcoming.  The smoke of the wood burning oven adds to the ambiance.\n\nIf going, I would recommend going for dinner as the lunch menu was limited.  I wanted to eat pasta, this is Giada's place isn't it, but no pasta on the lunch menu.  The lunch menu consisted mostly of small app, salads, pizza's and sandwiches.\n\nWe had prosciutto, olives, meatballs for starters.  All were very good and tasty.  Our party had 2 lobster roll, grilled cheese lemon pesto sandwich and lasagna.  The lobster roll was excellent.  I had a bite of the lemon pesto sandwich and it was good to.  My friend loved the lasagna, although it was quite small of $24.\n\nThis place is not cheap, for what seems to be a casual lunch. Apps and entrees (no desserts) came out to $200 for 4 of us.\n\nI definitely want to check this place out for dinner."

He was fun and informative and offered suggestions. EVERYTHING On the menu looked and sounded AMAZING!! Unfortunately it's going to take 5 visits to be able to try it all!! I can say the bacon wrapped dates and orzo meatballs were fabulous starters and the rigatoni with vegetable bolognese was incredible for a pasta! We did also try the trio of tiramisu and the plate of cookies, both delicious and a great finish to the meal. Giada's has knocked it out of the park.

My girlfriend and I were probably the most dressed up there and the patrons were definitely not the 20 to early 30 something partying crowds.  After looking at the prices on the menu I understood why, but what do you expect from a more refined, celebrity chef restaurant at a hotel in Vegas?\n\nI enjoy Giada's style of cooking; Italian with her southern California twist; elegant, rich, flavorful yet not too heavy. The small bites (appetizers) menu is extensive: you might get full and not need the main course if you pick a few dishes. We only had the chicken marsala meatballs and roasted eggplant parmigiana with smoked scamorza cheese; both of which \nwere delicious. The eggplant dish tasted like a vegetarian lasagna dish.\n\nWe also had the scallop and crab risotto dish and the lobster ravioli, both were delicious but the portions were very small. \n\nI wish I was hungry enough to try some of their meat or fish dishes, which by the way were a little pricey. \n\nFor dessert we only had room for a tiny cake, which was a special for that night and I can't remember the exact name but it contained some nuts like almond or hazelnut. It was good but a little too sweet to my taste. Maybe we should have tried their chocolate tiramisu instead?\n\nThe service was very good and prompt. The ambiance was modern and nice. Good place for a nice or romantic dinner night if you don't mind shelling out a little more from your wallet and not looking for cheap eats."

Cromwell is nice, small in size, d\u00e9cor black and red tones with leather. Entry to restaurant up large white walled (non-inviting) escalators to Hostess and open kitchen/Bar area,(very impressive). I greeted Hostess and said I have reservations for 815 and I was local and asked for a window/view table please ( I put this request on my TableOne email). Her response: whines, \"I can't guarantee that -it depends on when tables clear-I'll try\". I said thanks and headed to bar to wait. Well, being a LOCAL- that response 95% of the time means I need to 'tip'. I walked back, shook her hand, with nice tip handed to her while I asked her to \"please make sure we get a good view table\". She withdrew her hand like I burned her and said \"oh I CANT TAKE THAT\"..as I look for a hidden camera....I told her with surprise..\"oh, sorry no insult intended. I'm local and know how things usually work\" Said I was sorry, and asked please for a nice table. Go to bar, 4-5 people come by to do different 'stuff' at our little seating area, we order, 10 min at least pass, not busy in bar, no drinks yet. Another gal then shows up and says table is ready. WE have to get the drinks served, cash out tab, then follow to our table. Head towards dining room (lovely views) take a quick right to end of a hall-type area with about 8 two top tables. We are placed at the very last one with my shoulder almost bumping the shoulder of the lady sitting by the \"window\" crappy view area (oh my back to 'window). I told host I will not eat right against another's back. She moved us to the table across from them in this 'hallway'. Food. Ok. Portions might fill up a bird. Pasta is cheap and so is bread. I have lived here 10 years and atmosphere / ambience means everything. We got screwed. We were given the WORSE table in the restaurant. I walked thru the 'real restaurant' on the way out, beautiful....Too bad I didn't feel like we had 'that' experience. This was my special Christmas present to my guy..waah, wah- FAIL.  Thanks Giada for making my 'gift' a 'crap memory'.\nOverall -2 Stars\nFood- 3 Stars\nService- 3 Stars\nAmbiance- 1 Star"

The Romain salad couldn't have been more wonderful if I had assembled it myself. My dinner entre was the Ravioli. Stuffed with the most succulent lobster meat to ever cross my lips. Then drenched in a rich butter sauce that was quite possibly the most fantastic thing I have ever put in mouth. Which if you knew me that is saying a lot. We had such a magnificent time we made reservations for breakfast for the next day as we were leaving. For breakfast I had the Carbonara pizza.

From the moment you walk up the second floor to when we walked and were explained about each different prep stations I was quite impressed.The design is very cute and clean and I think it represents Giada to the tee. We came on their 6th day of opening the service was EXCELLENT. Our server Radoslav was really attentive and good at explaining the menu though it was quite lengthly. He explained that the portions are designed to be small so that you can try many things on the menu. My boyfriend and I had to beg to differ. We ordered 2 plates too many but they were all tasty. I did not know what to really expect but I was PLEASANTLY surprised. Here is what we ordered:\n\nDrinks:\nLa Strada: Campari, homemade lemon sorbeto, berognoli limoncello, prosecco\n        very good, pretty and on the fruity side\nRiso Amaro: cucumber, celery bitters, 2nite vodka, fresh grapefruit and lemon\n         pretty, fruity but on the too much of the bitter side for me\n\nAppetizers:\nBacon Dates: very tasty, just the right amount of crisp on the bacon\nOctopus: lacking a little salt, the only dish i wouldn't order again\nArugula Salad: simple but yet very refreshing\n\nEntre:\nTortellini: if you don't like peas you probably wont like this dish but i thought it was very good\nSpaghetti: PERFECTION. BY FAR MY FAVORITE DISH. spaghetti and all pasta dishes are made in house. this dish was so refreshing and was just perfect with the large shirmps. I WANT MORE!!!\nFilet: cut of meat was very good and cooked to perfection\nSide Corn: with a kick of spicyness and charr. \n\nWe had no room for desert but did have the Espresso Nocciol and Lemoncello Berta for a drink after our meal. \n\nThe Espresso Nocciol was velvet in my mouth. SOOO good. it has nutella in it. Need i say more?? \n\nThe Lemoncello was a nice palate cleanser\n\nOverall I would HIGHLY recommend that you try Giada. If you call and try to make reservations you might not be able to get the reservation but if you walk in and have a small party i'm sure they can accommodate you. Rumor is that they are \"fully committed\" until October. \nI almost forgot the VIEW!!!!! Giada in located in the new Cromwell Hotel. She totally lucked out the the view. because its just beautiful up there with the view of the strip. \n\nGood lLuck and Good Eats."

The location is also great at the intersection of Las Vegas blvd and Flamingo road. The wife had breakfast contadina which she enjoyed. She really liked the polenta cake and the wilted spinach that came along with her eggs. I had the Italian hash and it was delicious with only a hint of being under seasoned. Service was good and attentive. Also the view from our table was nice. \n\nLater the same day, they were quite busy for dinner so overall the dining room was louder with the high ceilings accentuating the noise. Due to the amount people filling the restaurant the service did suffer a little. For dinner, the wife and I split the mushroom pizza as an app and she went with the branzino and I opted for the farrotto, which for me was underwhelming. The wife enjoyed her fish and the pizza was alright. Overall dinner was a good experience but I would probably only return here for breakfast or brunch at this point.

When you are paying high $20's for pasta, you want the dish to be spectacular.  It wasn't.  It was just fine.  As were the appetizers.  And try finding a bottle of wine that you want for under $60.  I certainly don't mind paying over $100 per person for a  great meal.  But that wasn't what I had here."

And would give there suggestions as per you palate. We had meat and cheese platter and veg platter. The meat platter had prosciutto wine cooked beef chesse of different type. The mozzarella chesse just melted in my mouth the moment I ate it. And for main course I had lobster with side of zucchini. The bread was loaded with lobster meat cooked inside a bag put in boiling water. So the lobster is cooked in it's own juice. The bread was crisp even after 20 minutes of serving. And the way lobster and bread mix in the mouth is like mesmerising  jazz happening performance happening. And yes most of the desserts are freshly made on order. So don't miss it\nI recommend this place whenever you visit Vegas as a must to visit"

Shared the orzo meatballs and crab arancini to start- not a big fan of meatballs so I just tried one and it was ok, but the arancini was delish- great sauce.  Then had the caprese, which was so flavorful- great mozzarella.  Finally ended with the scallop risotto which was amazing; risotto is so hit or miss and this one was just right.  Also tried my friend's lemon spaghetti, which was very unique and the shrimp were enormous and very flavorful.  The service is really amazing and the view of the strip was great- could see the fountains at Bellagio from my seat.  Only disappointment was I was so full, I didn't have any room left to try one of the amazing looking desserts!"

Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent with a nice wine list, and the chocolate tart is delicious (so light for being so decadent!)...so if you like her recipes, then you should go once. They were very accommodating by splitting a pasta entre for our app and cutting the tomahawk rib eye for us to share, so kudos there. \n\nThe problem is the vibe...its an extremely tiny space with a tiny bar...trying to be a CA restaurant with a CA attitude. It's loud with not enough staff for the amount of people they pack in...and the bar definitely needs more help. I don't mind waiting for my reservation (that you have to make a month in advance) if I can order a cocktail, but when the staff is rude because there's no place to stand to order a drink...and there's only one bartender to service the entire restaurant...then it's a problem. With that, I'm still willing to try them for brunch next trip and see if daytime is better. I want Giada's to succeed, but Vegas is a tough crowd to please."

I have been to many restaurants in Las Vegas and I have to say I have never felt so disgusted at the level of customer service as I have at Gaida. She must really not know that's going on there. Couple of things to point out:\n\n1) Food is extremely over priced for the portion and quality you receive. Nothing special about the plates whatsoever ordinary caprese salads and pasta dishes with tiny portions and no taste. \n\n2) The waiter was something out of this world and so was the management. The waiter asked if we wanted a bottle of wine and I said yes so management brought us a bottle of a white wine we had never even heard of and asked if that was ok... Umm no it's not ok let me see the wine menu and select myself. The fact they didn't even ask us if we wanted to see one from the get go blows my mind (mind you I was in a party of 6). The waiter also took our dishes without asking if we were done with the plates. Can you say rude? You could tell the waiter does not belong serving in a place like that. I also overheard the couple next to us who was eating say they did not like their plate and would like it returned. I literally watched them return it and just finish their two drinks and leave (wish I had been this smart from the start). \n\nThe only reason I stayed through it all was because it was my girlfriends birthday and that's where she wanted to go. With reservations and all I still had to wait at least 15 minutes and when they brought my girlfriend a dessert for her bday it was 2 lemon cookies and some icing on a plate that said happy birthday... No small dessert with a candle or anything. Seriously? I wish I could go back in time and had gone to eat somewhere else. Only reason I didn't run out was because I was trying to satisfy my girlfriend but our whole party was appalled by the quality of that establishment. Never again will I go there and I'll make sure everyone I know doesn't waste their hard earned money on a place like that. Hope this review helps someone.  I strongly believe some of these 5 star reviews are people paid by the establishment or people who have no idea what fine dining is really about."

From the staff to the decor to the food, everything was phenominal! \nThe restaurant itself was very warm and so well put together. There is a photo booth in the lobby. You can take photos and have them facebooked, emailed or printed right there for you.  Such a fun and cute idea!! The attention detail once you enter the dining room is obvious with beautiful booths, gorgeous tables and decor. We sat at a table next to the window, which is for sure the best seat on the joint!\nOur waiter was so extremely helpful and knowledgeable which is always such a nice touch! \nNow onto the thing we all really want to know about: the food. It was sooooooo delish I want to go back now! We started with drinks. My husband ordered the barbarella, which was so wonderful you could forget it was alcohol! I ordered the savignon blanc which was so crisp and light.   \n\n-oysters rockefeller: amazing! They were fried I believe in a batter perhaps. It was so light though and melted in my mouth.\n-strawberry jam and feta crostini: the crostini was just the right crunchy and the toppings were amazing together. (Add the basil pesto to the top, you won't regret it!)\n-spaghetti with prawns: wonderful!!! The sauce is so amazing! Its light and lemony and the pasta is clearly freshly made and cooked to the perfect al dente. The prawns were enormous and cooked to perfection! \n-lobster ravioli: stuffed full of lobster with a lemon sauce and chinks of lobster on the plate. It was delish!\n-side of peas: amazing! Peas with mint! One of my favorite things and it was so good!\n\nOur dinner was one of the best I've had in a long time!! The servings are not what we in America consider normal (sadly) because everyone seems to want so much food on their plates. However, I think they were perfect and exactly the size a healthy serving should be. I actually ended up taking home some of my dinner. \nDESSERT: NOM NOM NOM NOM\nThere is this adorable dessert cart that comes to your table and you choose your dessert. We chose the lemon cookie, the chocolate peanut butter cookie, the white coffee gelato, and a chocolate tart with almond brittle. Everything was phenom but the chocolate tart with almond brittle was seriously orgasmic!!!!! I want to kiss Giada for creating it!! MUST TRY!! Our next favorite was her lemon cookie. Light and almost  creamy texture. \nOk so....bottom line: amazing experience and I cannot wait to go back!!!"

Nicely prepared food at top dollar prices, appearance of both the restaurant and the plating trumped actual food flavors. The chicken meatballs were the worst as dry and needing a soak in the Marsala sauce once halved to be palatable. The eggplant lasagna had a wonderful pink sauce which made this the best plate. Two salads were both about average for a normal California fusion restaurant. Not sure what the vision for this restaurant is? If you want the big dollar menu for expense accounts, then the food experience needs to be increased considerably. If you're making a casual Italian lighter fare food, then the menu needs to be a bit more unique that what I can order at California Pizza Kitchen or cut the prices to match the mediocre experience.\nMy overall opinion was I came once and that was enough. Our waitress disappeared after we ordered until we got the bill. Or actually, she  was around helping larger parties but not us. Thanks to the guy who came by with our entrees and had to go get us plates (leaving the hot food sitting  to get cold while we waited) and finally gave us a water refill that we'd waited for since we sat down parched. Nice water pitcher, but need way bigger glasses perhaps if refills are so hard to come by."

I highly recommend you use the Groupon for breakfast for the biggest bang for the buck - which is what we did.\n\nWebsite says they open at 8 AM but they don't.  They open at 9.  So know that.  We had built our schedule around an early breakfast and we were stuck waiting for them to open.  \n\nEVERYTHING here has Giada on it.  From the napkins to the pictures to the TV playing her shows to the bathroom towels.  It's a little weird and comes across as so heavy-handed.  I think Anne Burrell is way hotter but I like women chefs that like women, so that's just me.  \n\nOnce you get past the ego trip, the place is pretty.  It's actually lovely.  And if you show up early (at the time they actually open, not the time they claim to open) you should be lucky enough to get a table by the window with a nice view.  But don't believe that you'll have a \"perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains\".  You can maybe see them if you stretch.  It's obstructed.  More PR.  Giada must have an awesome PR team.\n\nI'm not someone that likes a big breakfast.  I'm good with coffee and a muffin so I did the Giada's Fresh Pastry Assortment ($5 for one pastry).  I got what they call Monkey Bread but which is essentially a chocolate croissant.  It was good and just the right size for my breakfast needs.  The coffee BTW was excellent.  As was the champagne included in our deal.  I was very happy.\n\nMy vegetarian SO got the Breakfast Contadina - two eggs served any style, crispy polenta cakes,wilted spinach, oven roasted tomatoes & toast ($17).  It was very good and satisfied her - she likes a hearty breakfast and this was perfect.\n\nService was just spot on.  We really enjoyed our breakfast here.  I can't imagine they offer Groupon deals that often but if you see one, GRAB IT and absolutely plan a breakfast here.  It's a steal of a deal and quite the scene.  Worth it."

            "review": "The husband and I have been wanting to eat at Giada's restaurant for a while. We finally dined here for dinner last month for my birthday. In fact, I think I called in the reservation about 3 months before. Not that I needed to that far in advance, but its never bad to plan things early, right? I also requested a table with a good view. Although they said \"we will try as much as possible, but not guaranteed,\" we did end up getting a table facing the Bellagio fountains. Also got a fantastic view of the crazy traffic on Las Vegas Blvd, LOL. \n\nCustomer service was excellent. Our server and the staff was very nice, polite and attentive. Drinks were refilled and dirty plates were taken away in a timely manner. So here's the thing: years ago when I did watch Giada's cooking show, I really liked her recipes because they were simple. Few ingredients, preparing didn't look too difficult and of course everything looked so good! When I was browsing the menu, everything looked so complicated. I guess it doesn't help that I'm picky about what I eat, but its never a good sign for me when nothing on the menu really catches my eye. So I ordered probably the most boring thing on the menu: Spaghetti. I know, I know, but it was the only dish that didn't have things that I hated like squash, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, etc.\n\nWe started with appetizers. We asked our server what appetizer was popular under the meat category, and he recommended the Bacon Wrapped Dates. Not a fan of dates, but they were stuffed with sausage and wrapped in bacon. Sounded like they were worth a try. I was surprised that I could hardly taste the dates and the sausage did have a kick to it, but they were good. We also ordered the Orzo Meatballs, which were juicy and tasty as well. It also came with a generous amount of sauce.\n\nNow to the main course. I was excited when the food was brought to our table because the presentation was pretty. For my spaghetti, there were two jumbo shrimp on the bottom and a dollop of spaghetti sitting on top of the shrimp. Unfortunately, I didn't like the lemon sauce too much. I was kind of over it after the first few bites, but forced myself to eat it all because this place isn't cheap! Ughh, I'm definitely NOT a fan of sweet spaghetti. It needed butter, or maybe just salt. My husband, on the other hand loved his food! He ordered the Bone-In Tuscan Rib-Eye with truffle flakes. Our server said that occasionally they offer the truffle flakes in the restaurant. I thought it was weird that there was a sunny side up egg on the steak. But then again, I do hate eggs. I know that eggs are used to make a lot of foods and that is fine. I guess I should say that I don't like eggs by itself or eggs that are visible. Anyway, he said that the Rib-Eye was fantastic and one of the best steaks he ever had. \n\nI really wanted to order a Tiramisu for dessert, but our server told us that they only serve it when they have some special \"Tastings Menu.\"  :( Total fail for me, but at least one of us really liked the food here.\n\nBeen there, done that, but I probably won't be back. A little disappointing, but oh well, there are many other good eats in Vegas!"

Within a short time, our waiter, Rocco--one of the stars of our dinner--arrived to greet us and to ask about water/drinks.\n\nI ordered iced tea and my dining companion got a cocktail.  It was then time to peruse the menu and decide what we wanted.  While looking at the menu, Rocco brought us a selection of bread--some breadsticks, a round baked load, some lavash, and an assortment of spices and dips for the bread and for later in the meal.\n\nWe ordered the same salad, the tricolore--with prosciutto, gorgonzola, dates, walnuts, tuscan kale, yellow endive, and radicchio.  The salad was the other star of the evening.  It was simply superb!  The dressing and the textures of the various ingredients were so good.  I did put some of the salt from the bread board on the salad. \n\nFor my main course, I got the fregolotto--with morel mushrooms, baby zucchini, and squash blossoms.  The cheese grated on the pasta, shaped like large tapioca, and the zucchini gave the pasta some flavor.  Otherwise, the dish was very bland.  It was also a small portion for its $28 price.\n\nFor dessert, I got a pistachio cake with gelato.  This had an interesting presentation.  A rather large, oval-shaped bowl with some torn pieces of pistachio cake, a small dip of raspberry sorbet, and some fresh fruit. I finished dinner with a cup of coffee.\n\nService throughout our almost two hours there was first rate.  Rocco and his staff were excellent.  The room is very nicely done and their was a vibrancy to the place that I liked.\n\nOn the other had, I know Giada is a celebrity.  But must everything have her name or her stylized g imprinted on it.  Before I left, I checked in the bathroom to see if I had her name stamped on my ass but it wasn't there.  Being a celebrity also means that you can take normal prices, add the surcharge for dining on the Strip, and then add another surcharge for dining in Giada's establishment.  A double whammy.  \n\nThe salad was a good sized portion but the pasta was almost laughable in its size.  Following other restaurants lately, the pasta was served in a huge dish with a relatively small well in the center for the pasta.  \n\nThe only thing that rescues Giada (see, I feel I have to use her name throughout the review, too), from a 2 star review would be the salad and the service.  Been there, done that, won't be back."

We had a group of 5 and we all ordered something different so we were able to try a few different dishes.  We were given the option of a tasting menu, served family style, at $120, we did not opt for this as all parties at your table had to partake.  I can understand a minimum of 2 people to do the tasting menu but not sure why the whole table would have to partake.  Everybody loved their food and I would definitely return.  Since it was my birthday, they brought me 2 cookies (lemon ricotta and a chocolate/peanut butter one) on a plate with happy birthday written in chocolate on it.  We started off with some fried calamari and it was oh so delicious, melt in your mouth, tender.  The side of asparagus was a good size portion and was enough for all 5 of us.

Based on our previous visit, we went back again. What a disappointment!  We made a reservation for 9am which was the time the restaurant opened.  Even though there were only two other parties waiting to be seated, it took the 2 hostesses about 10 minutes to seat us at our table.  We had menus and waited about 10 minutes for the waiter to ask us if we wanted coffee and what we wanted to order.  There were several waiters in the room and only 3 tables of 2 people each and a large party of about 15 people. He acted as if he was doing us a favor by taking our order.  We told him we had come back to enjoy the delicious donuts we had had last time.  He told us Giada did not serve them for breakfast anymore.  I asked about other sweets and he said that they had a pastry basket.  \n\nWe ordered our meal. They brought our omelet and bread with no butter or jam.  We finally were able to flag down the waiter and asked for butter, jam, and more coffee.  By the time he came back, our entrees and toast was cold.  At 9:45, when the restaurant had only been open 45 minutes, we ordered the pastry basket.  The waiter came back and told us there were no more because the large party had taken them all.  I asked if we could have the donuts or any other muffin or sweet. He said he had nothing to offer.\n\nI went to the hostess and asked her to send the manager to our table.  His name was Frank Gibase.  He said that the waiter was wrong because what had happened was that the chef had burnt most of the pastries in the morning when  he was making them so they couldn't serve them.  The few that were not burned went to the large party.  I again asked if we could have the donuts or any other sweet.  He hardly acknowledged that there was a problem and didn't even apologize for our disappointment.  We will never go back."

            "review": "I came for one of my favorite peoples birthday. There were so many people interested that a few of us made a reservation of a few smaller tables and then just asked if we can be seated together.\n\nWhile I wasn't there to witness it, it seemed this was OK with the GM as the bday girl talked to him. She had to email the reservations manager according to them who tried to make us take these pre fixe group menu or impose a spending minimum. NO. We have 3 separate reservations and not some ginoromous group even with all of us. No. Those group menus weren't interesting to most of us. We just asked to be in tables near each other. It put a bad taste in my mouth and almost cancelled if it wasn't a point we can argue out of. I get trying to let us know as a option and to maybe be easier for the kitchen but any other parties of 6- 10 people wouldn't have this imposed on them I'm sure. It's only because we asked to sit by each other. \n\nWe arrived at dinner - and no, we didn't do the group menus. \n\nIt took a little while to get orders in and get bread, but once the dinner rolled on the pace was good and food came in a fairly timely manner. As a side note, I think iPad menus are not needed. It froze up quite a few times on us and talked about antipasto platters that were not on the main menu you could miss. It also talked about alcoholic beverages that were in the wine list booklet already. \n\nBreadservice was good. There was a small pot of herb focaccia, some crisps and breadsticks and a tray of condiments- pesto, finishing salt, red pepper, lemon marscapone butter, fried capers\n\nI decide to split up some items with my friend Anthony. \n\nCaponata had pleasant texture of the veggies were good, but a tad too sweet. I like when it's sweet and tangy. It could have been a big hit for me with a bit of acidity. I tried to offset with a bit of the fried capers and red pepper from the condiment tray. This really should come with some nice bread though. It was okay on the crisp and the focaccia, but I didn't get enough bread as the basket was small and there were 6 people.\n\nGrilled octopus - simple flavors, but the octopus was tender. Everything was cooked nicely, but I wish there was something to give the octopus with diced potatoes some oomph. A nice puree, sauce, veloute to add a little something.\n\nMarsala chicken meatballs were decent. I like that it wasn't too sweet as marsalas can be but more a wine-y flavor.Came with a few mushrooms and 2 small tomatoes on the stem.\n\nVeal Saltimbocca was lovely.Nicely crisp, the cheese stuffing was solid and it was well seasoned. I like the incorporation of sage on it. It was a good size, maybe about 14-16oz.\n\nCrispy Polenta was our side for the veal. It was simple, but good though mine wasn't really crisp. I enjoyed the tomato sauce that was on it. \n\nDessert cart I chose a honey, chocolate and almond tart. This was almost perfect. The florentine cap on top was money. The texture of the chocolate filling was nice but a tad too sweet along with the honey and would have preferred a bitter chocolate to offset. However, it was really well made and still pretty damn good. \n\nOut of my meal, the standout was the veal saltimbocca. It was the singular item I would order again and considering it was the most expensive then perhaps it was a good thing that it was worth it. \n\nService was OK, but had some hiccups. Like I mentioned earlier it took a moment to take off as I don't know why the server was going to our table, answer questions then disappeared a few times. The bussers were a little too plate eager. I had my plate taken while I was still eating bread but turned to have a conversation and found it gone. We took the bone off the veal then split it in half and place it on my individual plate. A moment after the plate was being lifted from us and I had to say wait! the lemon and the sauce was still on there so he placed the dish of the sauce on the table as I took the lemon and left. Sucks because the veal bone has all those good little pieces left and he took my utensils on the plate. \n\nApparently our other table had hiccups too. Most notable is being poured water like crazy and getting charged $64 for still water. Really, they should have been asked if they wanted to order more. The water was not branded bottles even. Its the reusable kind that Echo&Rig use for their water which they give you for FREE. \n\nNow the food ultimately is what it is about. It was good, but nothing blew my mind. It was good, but not on par with its cost.When you have a town where there are some good off strip fresh pasta, seasonal ingredient Italian food, I have other, better options. On top of that, I am a bit critical of some things I believe I do well at home. A few people had the risotto and it did not hold up to the one the fiance and I make - their words, not mine. \n\nIt's not a bad  meal, but I think there are better experiences I've had on and off the strip that I would return to first before stepping here."

When I found out that reservations were available on OpenTable, I made a reservation right away for the first time slot available (11 am on June 4th, made the res in early May). I spent the next couple weeks obsessively looking for the menu and reading all of the news articles about this restaurant. In one article, I noticed it said that they would not be open for lunch for the first month... this was a red flag for me, so I called the number provided to confirm that we would be able to go at the specified time. I was assured over the phone that it was fine. Great. So we get to Vegas and I get a confirmation e mail from OpenTable for my res... I am so excited, but still a little wary, so I went to the Cromwell's front desk to ask about our reservation... they don't know anything and give me the number of the restaurant (which isn't the number on their website). I call... no answer. I call several more times and finally get an answer. I just wanted to triple check that my res is still good.... oh no, not open for lunch. 'You made your reservation when we THOUGHT we would be open for lunch, but then we decided we weren't going to be.' WHAT?!?! I had invested so much time and energy into going to this restaurant.... I drove to Vegas for this. I could not believe it. Not only that, but the manager, Nicole I think, was less than helpful. First, they offered us a 5 o clock res for that night, which I snatched with renewed excitement... only to get a call back a couple minutes later saying that actually they couldn't give us that res since they had a private party until 730. WHAT. Let down all over again. Who has a private event on their opening night? I thought this was the night for the public. At this point, the manager said she couldn't do anything for us, that we could 'try to come sit at the bar.' Are you kidding me? This was unbelievably ridiculous. She couldn't even just save us a place at the bar considering they were the ones who messed up? How hard do I need to work to give this place my business? I think the worst part was if I hadn't been researching, I would have shown up for our res and no one would have been there... how crushing is that? How many people did this happen to? I hope this place works on its customer service because right now it is garbage. That, and don't give out reservations you can't keep and never bother to call those people or contact those people to tell them that their reservation had been cancelled. After this experience, I don't know that I will visit Giada in the future and I would be hesitant to recommend it to anyone else. I know it's a new restaurant and all, but get your act together."

Going upstairs to Giadas I can say her restaurant again vey classy, I loved the light woods and the art.  They have an adorable photo booth that you can mark your experience by taking a photo and sharing it on Facebook or send to your email for free.  Very nice touch!  The dining room, kitchen, seating were all very nice.   I loved her napkins with her name on them and all of the dishes used during the service very Giada.  So I was surprised to hear everyday radio music especially when you read her menu and clearly see she wanted an Italian flair and experience.  I'm beginning to think that restaurant owners do not understand that dining can be an experience even for that hour or two where you are taken to another place.  I can get in my car and hear regular old radio music any day of the week.  What you have done is just cut the experience off at the knees. When you could have provided the full take me away dining experience.  Also I was not a fan of opening those huge Windows on Mother's Day when it was still cool outside and all the ambulance noise and traffic.  Slightly disappointed however I am still a Giada fan and hope that their establishment realizes they have the power to provide an experience for your eyes, ears and palate."

Now the food, amazing,  just as we thought it would be, but i must say they love their arugula lol. Now the negatives,  the service was lacking, we found ourselves waiting looking around for service. Drinks were forgotten,  no refills offered & when we did get the bill, not only did they charge us for our table but also added someone else's table to our bill. So overall,  great food but the service is what brings you back, and unfortunately,  the service did not compliment the food, so not sure if we would return. Our grade would be a B-, C+."

The service was excellent, and, the view of the Bellagio Fountains was superb.\n\nI really enjoyed all of the food!  We had an appetizer sampler platter with more things that I can remember (mushrooms, bread and tapas, roasted peppers, olives, bruschetta with pancetta, meatballs and so much more).  All of it was delightful!  I could eat the lemon mascarpone spread they gave us for the bread every day.\n\nThe lamb was absolutely the best any of us had ever had.  My short rib pappardelle pasta was amazing.  Friends didn't really care for their spaghetti (it has a rich white sauce, not red sauce) or the ravioli (again a white sauce).\n\nWe were all quite disappointed in the standard dessert menu.  We begged our waiter to let us order off the dessert tray that's solely for the four course tasting menu (and he agreed, but, we saw him get in trouble from a manager...POOR GUY.  Don't blame him, blame us)!  The little bite sized desserts were way better than what the options on the menu.\n\nI will definitely be back!"

            "review": "My husband and I and another couple from out of state, who had never been to Las Vegas went to dinner @ Giada's on the night of Sept. 30. We were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I had made reservations a good month and a half before this date. Our time was 5pm. I am a big fan of Giada's on the Food Network, and I knew the food should be great! I thought she would never put her name on a place that wasn't going to be a wonderful place to celebrate an occasion. WRONG!!!!\n   We went to the bar while waiting for our table, 3 glasses of wine and a tip, $54. We were seated, and I requested a window seat ahead of time, but they put us at a side table where the shutters were barely open. We were given a wine menu, a food menu, then a tasting menu. We were told we all had to order the tasting menu or no one could. Confusing! We were told to order several dishes and share them family style. Our waiter asked if we wanted to speak to the sommelier, which my husband declined, because he knew of most of the bottles on the list, and which one we wanted to order. He brought the wine over, and our one friend declined to have a glass. The waiter said, \"maybe you would like a scotch instead?\" Our friend said, \"as a matter of fact, I would\". The waiter said, \" I was joking\". He brought the scotch. \n   We then ordered our food, the waiter suggested the antipasti plate. We each placed our order, then the waiter said that would not be enough food for you all, so I am going to order you a lemon spaghetti also. Aaaaaa, we did not ask for that??? In the mean time, the sommelier came over. Again, we did not ask for him. The food all came out, but took along time. Portions were small, but over all, the food was good.\n   Then things really turned. We sat for a least 15 minutes with our dirty, finished dishes in front of us. Finally, we stacked the dishes in hopes of being noticed. Someone finally came over and removed them. There was no mention of dessert to us. Our waiter came back over and asked if we wanted to see the dessert wine menu. By that time, we were ready to move on out of there. Enough! Between the bar bill and dinner bill and 2 tips we spent close to $ 500, and to top it off there was never a mention on \" are you here for any special occasion?\"\n  We took the manager's card. I emailed him a few days later. He responded saying he was out of town and would call me in 2 days. No call came. 5 days after that, I emailed him again. He responded with, a sorry, I am out of town. I will call you tomorrow. Well, guess what?? No call !! Maybe if they had a manager who was around more, the poor service would not happen. Not worth your time and money going there."

If you take anything away from this review, it should be to take advantage of the four course tasting menu, especially if you don't live near Las Vegas. With the tasting menu, a large and delicious antipasti platter is served and not one thing on the plate is disappointing, but the bacon wrapped dates and pea pesto crostini were the favorites. The pasta courses were stunning and delicious as well, but the table favorite was the Vegetable Bolognese. Amazing is an understatement, such rich flavors.The tenderloin with chimichurri was fanastic, as were the crusted lamb chops and salmon. The real entree star is the Branzino with Tangerine Vinaigrette, it is honestly the epitome of perfection. The dessert cart that comes with the tasting menu is stunning, both in looks and taste. the choices are endless with the gorgeous rose gold cart but we stuck to banana gelato, lemon ricotta cookies, polenta cake, tiramisu, and raspberry sorbet. We recommend them all. We enjoyed our meal so much that we cancelled another dinner reservation to return to Giada before heading home. Both meals were phenomenal here. The staff is amazing, the view is spectacular, and the atmosphere is elegant as Giada herself. This review doesn't even begin to do this restaurant justice, you just have to go and see for yourself! We can't wait to return!!"

            "review": "Loved this restaurant. Beautifully furnished. Nothing about it said \"Vegas\" except for the views. We arrived 20 min early for dinner and they still seated us immediately. Service was perfect and food was delicious. \n\nUpon being seated, we were delivered warm rosemary bread, coupled with both pesto and freshly churned butter with lemon mascarpone folded in. --I already make my own butter for my homemade breads, but now I'm excited to attempt to recreate the added lemon and mascarpone as well. It was light and silky. Love. \n\nTo Start: The roasted beets paired with port soaked pears and goat cheese was divine. It was a feat to keep my husband's fork away from my beet salad. He should have ordered his own instead of his bacon wrapped dates. ;) The dates were good. Spicy and a little sticky. But he could have eaten an entire bowl of my port soaked pears. \n\nMain Entree: Flavorful and very tender short rib braised in Barolo, nestled in polenta, with roasted carrots and pearl onions on the side. It was comfort food at its best.  Perfect on a cool desert night. \n\nMy husband ordered the Veal Chop and was happy with it, but I loved my short rib more. I took two bites of his. The chop by itself and a bite of chop with the flash fried herbs. The flash fried herbs made the chop. Perhaps I'm biased with the opinion that the short rib was vastly superior. --I was in desperate need of comfort food that night and the veal chop just didn't satisfy enough.\n\nAdded Sides: Herb Polenta w/Spicy Sausage. Absolutely loved it. Loved it more than the polenta that accompanied my short rib. I left my own polenta alone and ate the side instead. Loved the herbs and the bites of sausage. \n\nRoasted Fennel.... didn't love. Didn't even like. For being \"roasted\" there was no caramelization at all. Just white and hard. No flavor. It was the only thing on my plate that made me want to hide it like a 5 yr old would. Or slip it to my pup, but I don't think he'd have eaten it either. \n\nIf Giada's was located in Chicago, I'd go there yearly. No doubt. Since my parents live in Vegas and I'll visit regularly, coupled with my dad's love of gambling (too much), I *might* return. I can drag him away from blackjack and maybe back to Giada's. There are so many restaurants I haven't been to though!"

I like how you go up the escalators and are greeted by the hostesses up top and there is a photo booth on the left, which is a nice touch. I've never seen a restaurant with a photo booth. On the right is the restaurant, I love how spacious and modern it feels. I really liked the furniture and all the cups, plates, and utensils...you definitely felt like you were in a high end restaurant. I also like the windows surrounding the restaurant with so much light coming in. I came here for brunch so I can't speak for how it is here for dinner/the evening. \n\nFor brunch, they offer a sampler meal which is $45/person, which is a great deal if you are feeling hungry, but what I did not like is that if one person in your party orders a sampler than everyone in your party must order an appetizer and entree. I think this is ridiculous and hate being forced to order food. I was in a party of 8 and although one person wanted to order the sampler, he spared the rest of us being forced to order an appetizer and just ordered each item he wanted separately. They have bottomless mimosas for $30/person. Service was not so great, our server forgot our beverages and I had to ask someone else to bring them over. She seemed like she was just not paying very much attention that day. I believe the juice and coffee was $9 each, which was a bit steep-at least they were good. \n\nOn to the food, we really liked the meatball appetizer, but keep in mind that it is a very small dish. The carbonara pizza was amazing, and I would definitely order this again. The lasagna was also good, but a bit pricy for what you got but I did enjoy this dish. It was a small dish of lasagna that was not too cheesy (which was a good thing for me), and came with a small arugula salad with some shaved cheese. Overall this place is pricy, which is expected, but I wouldn't mind coming back here sometime."

The other was after my meal was served I forgot what one of the items was and when he walked by I asked Him and he bent down really close to my plate and said oh I can't even see it.

For a fancy place, the wait staff was not the typically pretentious type, but instead very down to earth and personable. And then the food, absolutely amazing.\n\nOrdered the following:\n\nANTIPASTI (shared amongst 4)\n\n- Bacon wrapped dates\n- Orzo meatballs\n- Lobster Arancini\n- Prosciutto\n- Burrata\n\nThe orzo meatballs were probably my favorite. Lobster arancini was good, though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. And finally, for someone who doesn't like dates, the bacon wrapped dates were on point. Prosciutto and Burrata of very good quality.\n\n\nMain (shared between 2)\n\n- Spaghetti (shrimp, lemon, basil)\n- Risotto with (crab and scallops)\n- Side of Sweet corn and spicy sausage\n\nI had the spaghetti which I really enjoyed. The sauce is very light, but just the perfect amount of flavor to be able to really enjoy the fresh pasta. Side of sweet corn and spicy sausage was a bit spicy, but very good.\n\n\n\nOverall, this was a very memorable dinner, from the environment, to the service, the food, and of course the dessert cart! Don't forget to stop by the photobooth by the host table."

Let's just say, WOW! \n\nWhile waiting for our table reservation to be ready we sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple glasses of wine and the goat cheese stuffed peppers appetizer which was DELICIOUS, we could have done 10 more orders!!!  The menus we presented on iPads which was kinda cool and unique. \n\nOnce our table was ready we closed out at the bar and headed to our table (which would have been nice closer to see the strip view but still a nice spot). We were greeted within minutes buy a very friends Italian waiter (I forgot his name :( ) We wanted to try everything on the menu but we will have to save that for future visits! :) wait time wasn't too bad and we got to enjoy this DELICIOUS olive oil and Rosemary bread while waiting.... Everything we had was awesome!! Service was excellent, waters were continuously refilled, plates were cleared when we were finished and we were well attended to all night! Can't wait to return!! I'll attach some photos for your viewing pleasure!! Good job Giada!\n\nWith a 20% well deserved tip and all our check was only around 300$. I think very good price for everything we had!"

I may be slightly biased simply because Giada is my favorite cook on the food network but the food and atmosphere really did impress me. For starters, I probably had the best arancini in my life from here. I also really loved the bread that they brought out too especially the foccacia bread. Of course we had to go with her signature lemon spaghetti shrimp and it was so incredible yet so simple. I honestly don't know how they make it taste so good. Overall, I was super pleased with just about everything and I really want to make another visit."

How the hell can yelp tell me that this was not a first hand experience?!\n\nA repeat of my review about my FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE here at Giadas:\nI'm basing this review solely on the grossly overpriced menu. I have eaten at some of the best restaurants and steakhouses in the US and none of them come close to the outrageous prices charged at Giadas. I'm all for paying good money for a meal, but $75 for a bone in ribeye or $35+ for a plate of pasta portioned the size of an appetizer (just look at some of the pictures) is just absurd.\n\nSure, it's a good steak.... that's right.. I ATE IT!! But it's not even close to justifying its price. I'm pretty much disappointed with almost all the food network star restaurants and Giadas has managed to make it to the top of the list. All these guys cross promote each other to fuel their own pockets. Way to ride the fame bandwagon and lure people in with your TV name. Shame on you. \n\nMore detail about MY FIRST HAND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. They have a seating area overlooking the strip. The kitchen is right out in the open for a \"showy\" atmosphere. The Hostesses where grey heels with short white friffy dresses that have holes in them. There was a 30 minute wait last Saturday afternoon and we didn't even have to make a reservation to get a seat. We had a $14 arugula salad, I ate a bone in Ribeye with a egg on-top of it sprinkled with arugula and my friend had the lemon pasta which came with two prawns and looked like an appetizer. Side of lemon potatoes and the Tiramisu which came in a tiny shot glass and an espresso to finish off our underwhelming meal. I drank coke, she had a fancy drink.. the total came out right under $200. Everything tasted good... not amazing... will I write about how I felt about each and every item?? No... because explanation can justify being reamed not only in price.. but portions as well. I've paid good money for great food.. but I've never seen outrageous prices unless it was a special day like V-Day... in which case I guess we can justify paying $100+ a person... for a filling meal at least.\n\nWe went to Gordon Ramsays Steak the night after and had a wonderful and FILLING meal for two for less than$140. Portions were larger and we even had leftovers... Something I couldn't imagine happens a lot here at Giadas.\n\nGIADAS IS A PAID YELP ADVERTISER. They made a complaint to remove my legitimate negative review about a REAL experience here at Giadas. How can you say I didn't eat here when I know what their food tastes like and that they serve measily portions for top shelf prices. We left hungry and spent a couple hundred for a meal for two."

            "review": "Eh. Went in mid july for our 1 year wedding anniversary dinner. Tried to book reservations 2 weeks before we got to Vegas, but they were all booked. (this was before Giada was open for lunch). My hubby and I were waking past the Cromwell (please see separate review) and we wandered upstairs to get a look at Giada's. We were able to make a reservation a week in advance for dinner at 9:30pm on a Monday. Upon making the reservation, the hostess asks if we will be celebrating anything special. I tell her its our anniversary. (thinking maybe Giada will come say hi?!). They were very vocal in telling us about the dress code. However, as we arrived in our Sunday best. people strolled in wearing sneakers, shorts, and maxi dresses from the pool...The night of our reservation, we arrive a few minutes early. There is a free Photo Booth there that was a fun and free souvenir. The open concept kitchen as you walk into the dining room is gorgeous. Fresh antipasti station, Fresh pasta being handmade, bread being baked... The room itself is beautiful. Very white, very chi chi. Very Manhattan pretentious. When you are first seated, the waiter brings you a menu with \"Giada's selections\". This menu is several courses meant to work together that Giada arranged to compliment eachother. This was $120 pp. We weren't interested in eating all that. The waiter brought over an iPad to take drink and antipast orders. I didn't want to drink and the (3) choices of antipast did not impress me. I was praying the whole menu wasn't on an iPad because this layout was so annoying to use. Finally the waiter comes back with a real menu. I am a major foodie (please see ALL my reviews), and it took me forever to find something I was interested in eating. This rarely (if ever) happens to me. Giada raved and raved about having \"gluten free food\", so we expected to see GF pasta. NOPE. Her GF foods were meat and veggies, which by the grace of God, are GF already. That was a disappointment. Again, it  took forever to figure out what to order. GIada's Italian food is not your \"traditional\" Italian food. (ex spaghetti and meatballs, manicotti, braciole, red sauce, etc). For traditional, amazing,  Italian food, please see my review for Buddy V's. Her food is more Mediterranean Italian- lots of lemon, fennel- very different recipes and combinations of food. I felt lost and unfamiliar with the menu. We wound up ordering chicken marsala meatballs, shrimp scampi with marscapone cheese, and we each had a salad. The meatballs were excellent. Shrimp scampi was very different. Not at all garlicky, which is often synonymous with scampi. Salads were good. They bring out a big selection of bread to the table, with pesto dip and several other dips, and that was good. The only thing I entertained getting as an entree was the rack of lamb, but it was $45, and something I make at home. I wanted something different. For dessert they bring over an entire cart of desserts- from homemade gelato, to cookies, to pastries... we had cappuccinos and tiramasu. I had traditional Tiramasu and my husband had Peanut butter & Jelly tiramasu. Those were amazing. It was extra cool that GIada was there that night cooking, and coming out to tables in the dining room to talk with patrons. They seemed to send her out to select tables, aka high rollers, as she didn't go around the room to all. That wasn't cool. It was very cool to see her in person, as I am a big fan of her shows, but being the anniversary and all, she could have stopped by. I wonder why they even asked that...We felt it was a little too much for us. We are laid back people that enjoy casual places. Not enough offerings on the menu for our palette. We go to Vegas every year, and I don't think we would go back. For 2 people for 2 appertizers, 2 salads and 2 desserts with cappuccino, it was over $100. Portions are SMALL."

Instead I was given multiple numbers to call which were corporate people that referred me back to the restaurant.  The number that was suppose to be the hostess station at Giada's would ring 2 times and then go back to a corporate reservation line.  This happened no matter what day or time I called.  \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I went in for a pre dinner cocktail and app.  We ordered bacon wrapped figs, 1 glass of wine and some kind of cocktail drink.  The bill was 47 dollars.  I left a 5 dollar tip since it was just 1 round.  When I checked the bill on my credit card statement , the total was 97 something. The bartender had given himself a 51 dollar tip.  Now I'm not a math wiz but it sounds like he added a 1 after my 5 on the tip line.  \n\nFor being a newer, high profile, celebrity restaurant, the customer service is a complete joke. I feel embarrassed for Giada and hope she takes a little more, 'hands on' approach to prevent any further criminal activity in her restaurant. Also, how about  making  some kind of management available to customers so they can deal with these types of issues over the phone rather than on social media.? \nI did, dispute the charge with my credit card and they also quickly realized this was a scam and refunded me my money."

The Red Sangria seemed a bit on the sweet side whereas the White was refreshing and I honestly could drink it all day.\n\nTheir Wine Menu is impressive.... lots of sparkling wines and still wines.  \nDon't be intimidated... ask for a recommendation.  \nI highly recommend a sparkling as a starter with your antipasti as well as with their zucchini scapecce (shoestring fried zucchini... so good!)\n\nMy mom and I shared the Chopped Tricolore Salad. Kale, dates, prosciutto, radicchio and all sorts of yumminess.  The Gorgonzola dressing was a bit heavy so if I were to order this again, I would ask that they go super light on it or serve it on the side. It's a great salad.  The freshness of this salad hit the spot.  I'm not a kale person... this salad could change that.  I particularly love the prosciutto and date combo. Oh Yum!\n\nI had the Muffuletta sandwich and Mom had the Venetian sandwich.  Both were good.  But the Venetian was way more decadent than the Muffuletta.  I  thought the bread on the Muffuletta was a little tough.. so I ended up eating the insides of the sandwich which were very good!\n\nMy girlfriends ordered the Faro Salad and the Tenderloin sliders.  I got a taste of the Faro Salad.  I'm totally ordering that one next time.  The faro was tender ... not like other Faro salads I've had where it's more \"grain\" like.  And the light, citrusy dressing was perfectly light but loaded with flavor that enhanced the salad rather than distract from it.  I did not taste the sliders but they looked damn good.  :)\n\nMy mom finished with the Mocha Mio.  I highly, highly recommend this.  It's hot dessert in a cup.  I took a sip and it was heavenly.  Espresso, Chocolatey Goodness with a hint of Orange Citrus flavor.  I didn't think it sounded good on the menu, but oh how wrong I was.\n\nRight now (through the end of March, I think)... Locals get a 20% discount for breakfast and lunch.  So... if you've been meaning to try Giada's... and you're a Local... Go Now!  :)"

We had a little issue finding the right table at first but the hostess with a little extra effort eventually found us a table that was suitable.\n\nOur waiter,  Valentino was very personable and professional. The menu starts with either a tasting menu which consisted of antipasto, pasta, entree and desert or an ala carts menu which for one who has a hard time making decisions seemed overwhelming. With the help of Valentino- we went for the tasting. \n\nThe antipasto was tasty olives, spicy cheese stuffed figs and a small meatball. The crackle bread/ bread with pesto, salt, butter and hot pepper was to die for. My angel hair pasta with shrimp small plate was delicious. My husband loved his penne bolognese. \n\nBy the time we got to the entree, I for one was full. My salmon was cooked to my liking but not particularly special and spoiler alert....My husband's lamb entree was quite dry. When we told Valentino he was truly saddened and offered to get a new one. We explained there was no need but felt it important that the chef know. He promised to share our critic. \n\nNot being dessert lovers we skipped the beautiful dessert cart and instead we hade a cappuccino which was creamy and delicious and  delivered a large bowl each of natures perfect sugar... berries which were fresh and very satisfying. \n\nWithout prompting  the manager came over to our table to express his deep apology for the disappointing lamb and gave a generously large discount off the cost of one dinner. That was never asked for but greatly appreciated. \n\nOh and we made sure not to miss the photo both on the way out. \n\nAll in all I think it was a great experience and we would do it again."

We felt like we were not treated with the great customer service that I would expect. Our server was very inattentive, he missed an opportunity with us, we were planing on spending a lot on our meal and ended up only ordering 1 glass of wine and mediocre meals, then closing out our bill, with out dessert or more drinks simply because we desperately wanted out of the restaurant. My kale salad was drenched in a heavy cream dressing, So much so that you could not taste and other elements of the salad (I complained and they did kindly take it off our bill). I ordered the lemon spaghetti, and it was just ok, for 35 dollars I would have expected more. \n\n\nSeems like they are just looking to make money here, and do not truly care about your experience. With so many options in Las Vegas for fine dining I would skip this one. My favorite local Italian restaurant in Denver far exceeds what I experienced here at Giada's...... What a disappointment."

That's the \"positive\" side of the story.\nWhen making the reservation, to get a window table you had to \"guarantee $100 per person food/alcohol\". We were a party of 4. It wasn't that the $100 per person was a issue, it was the *principle\" of the presentation. I have NEVER been to a restaurant that wants guaranteed sales dollar volume for view seating.\nTHE FOOD: Appetizer of cheese filled mini-roasted peppers. This was a huge disappointment. Wasn't even warm. Room temperature. We had other appetizers that were \"good\", but certainly not \"gourmet\". The main course entrees (steak/shrimp, Vegetable Bolognese over Rigatoni, two side dishes were all barely above room, temperature, barely warm. Completely unacceptable. \nI ordered a Belvedede Martini with bleu cheese stuffed olives. The must have searched the globe for the smallest olives on earth. Anyone who drinks martinis knows they are to use jumbo (queen) olives, and hand-stuff with bleu cheese.\nOf the two desserts served, one was outstanding, the other one (kind of a layered cake) was cold and near-tasteless.\nWe asked our server how many days a week Giada was there. She said \"about once a month\". Even Wolfgang Puck makes regular rounds of his restaurants I frequent. Once a month means -to me - that we have Giada recipies but no Giada. \nSo, another overrated restaurant with high prices, small portions, and food that's not up-to-par nor consistent. There is simply NO excuse for food coming out lukewarm.\nLas Vegas has many outstanding restaurants such as Alize at the top of the Palms, Charlie Palmers at the 4 Seasons/Mandalay Bay, Capital Grille, and a bevy of other choices. The only restaurant is Las Vegas that this beats-out is the Eiffiel Tower restaurant at Paris Hotel, which is so ridiculously priced it's insultive.\nThis reviewers opinion is that there are many other fine restaurants to choose that this one, unless all your after is a beautifully decorated interior."

I couldn't really help but order their Italian Chicken & Waffles because it really caught my attention when I saw it on the menu and I'm also a sucker for fancified versions of the classic soul food combo.\n\nItalian Chicken & Waffles -- http://bit.ly/1OOLJxm\nCacciatore spiced chicken, polenta waffle, parmesan, cacciatore sauce\nYeah, this was a serious plate of chicken and waffles for brunch.  The Chicken was flavorful and had a nice spicy kick and the Cacciatore sauce gave it a tangy flavor that I enjoyed very much.  And those Polenta Waffles were on point with a soft interior and slightly crunchy exterior. I just remember when they served it to my table, I was just shocked at how big the portion was for this.  It was a very generous portion, but it was enough for me that I wasn't overstuffed after I finished it.  Yes, I did finish this!!  One thing of note though was that this platter was pricey at $28.  That's just a few dollars more than Bouchon's Roasted Chicken & Bacon Chive Waffles.  But it think the portion size and quality of the food was justified.  I can't really say which is better though, because they're both great in their own way.\n\nBreakfast Contadina -- http://bit.ly/1TBBsqn\nTwo eggs served any style, crispy polenta cakes, wilted spinach, oven roasted tomatoes & toast\nMy mom also ordered a side of bacon to go with this since it was more of a vegetarian entree.  From what I noticed, it was a very nice looking breakfast platter and it looked like my mom enjoyed it.\n\nSo I've been to Giada for Breakfast, Brunch, and Dinner and all of them have been great experiences.  It just proved to me that you can go there at any time of the day for any occasion and you can't go wrong.  And I do intend to go back again since it's now become one of my must-go restaurants on the Strip."

I came here on Sunday night August 2 to celebrate my birthday, what a waste of time, first let me say that none of the employees know what a dining booth is, when I made the reservations I asked to be placed in a booth, and the young man said that he would make notes and that there were no guarantee that there will be one available but he will make the request which was OK, when I arrived I told the hostess that I requested a booth she turned and said yes we have a booth for you, she took us right to a banquette, there was not one booth inside of the whole restaurant, we' asked to be seated somewhere else they stuck me in the back room next to the wine cellar, OK not really a big deal, started out with two appetizers orzo meatballs and some other type of balls not impressed enough to even remember the name, they both were horrible, I've never had a tasteless meatball before then, she should be embarrassed to even call herself Italian! I should've stopped there but I wanted to give my main dish a chance, so I ordered the Branzino.... Big mistake! I don't understand how this restaurant is getting great reviews, maybe someone in the kitchen is just mad with her and is purposely trying to ruin her! Save yourself some time and money and go to Rosati's on Grand Teton and Durango, now that's Italian!"

The food was bland, overpriced and very small portions. \nWe ordered 1 of every pasta, the spaghetti was the best, although even that was not great. \n\nThe shrimp and prawns were so overcooked we didn't even eat them, they were so tough you couldn't even cut through them. Had I not been with a group I would have sent several of the dishes back. \n\nTo top the whole experience off, service was appalling. From the waitress to the people that brought our food out. When our food arrived we asked if they could tell us what each plate was and the response was a non comical aggressive tone where they said \" you tell us which plate is what.\" It got worse from there .\n\nI wish we had gone to one of the many other great offerings in Vegas! Olive Garden would have been a better choice."

The grilled cheese came with some fried veggies with a garlic aioli and all of the flavors just worked so well together. The polenta added a cut of a crunch to the waffles, and the pineapples were grilled to perfection. The maple syrup and Nutella paired quite nicely. \n\nLocated in the Cromwell, Giada designed this restaurant to feel like you're a guest at her home. It's elegant and simple. Soft music, big windows with lots of natural light and pretty views. \n\nWe arrived a few minutes before 2, and the hostess said we missed lunch but could order from a bar menu and only the lounge/bear seating was available. So while we waited, I searched for a menu and saw that lunch was actually until 2:30. The bartender was nice enough to let us order, but the situation was a bit of a disappointment. \n\nWhile we were there, Giada was also visiting, so it was cool to see her. Apparently she comes once a month, and seemed to know and interact well with a lot of the staff members. She changes up the menu pretty often and gets quite creative from what I've heard. \n\nBy the host stand there's a free phot booth! Be sure to stop in for a picture."

That's what I wanted.  Started off with excellent service, gave us all these menus from wine-list and an Ipad to pick your drinks, also information about the dishes.  It was overwhelming for me.  I didn't even know where to start.  So I took my phone out and started to Yelp reviews.  Lolz.  Thanks Yelpers... \n\nThe cocktail drinks were Flash Gordon, and The hannibal.  Good to start with some drinks to relax the night.  We ordered the Fritto Misto shrimp & Calamari with fennel & lemon aioli, Mortadella pizza Bianca for appetizer.  For the entrees was Spaghetti shrimp, lemon, and basil, and Whole roasted chicken for two, cacciatore style.  We skipped the salad part.  My recommendations, don't order the chicken.  Our chicken (white meat was dry and chewy).  The pasta is excellent!  For dessert we picked the Tiramisu trio.  Oh yums!!   No Giada tonight.. it's okay her name and logo was everywhere..lolz.. Overall service and food quality is top-notch.  \n\nHint:  Remember before you check-in, go have some fun at the photo-booth (waiting area)  on your left.  Behind the black curtains.  A hidden picture taking booth and you can do your Selfies there!! \n\nEnjoying dinner with the person you love, cherish, and birthday celebration = priceless.  \n\nThank you Giada, a great night to remember!!"

This restaurant is located inside the Cromwell.  Yeah I've seen the show...but I'm not a big fan.  My husband's uncle is some kinda high roller and got a $500 dining credit to eat here and invited us.  I try to avoid the strip if at all possible but free food lures me in every time.  \n\nThanks to Stefany V. for the tip about parking...to get to self parking you have to go through valet and then make a U-turn.  This is very useful and was totally accurate!! \n\nThe scantily-clad hostesses first proudly announced that they had no tables available until 10 pm and then argued a bit before agreeing that there would be a table ready in 15 minutes.  Woah....big difference there, toots.  \n\nTook forever to order and get drinks and then took about an hour to get food.  In the meanttime they brought our party of six people a teensy little cutting board with one little piece of bread, some cracker flatbread, and three tiny little hard breadsticks.  For. six. people.  My husband's uncle jokingly asked if there was going to be one of these brought for everybody and the server rolled her eyes.  LOL \n\nThe $28 spaghetti, although not a good portion for the price, was very tasty.  The spaghetti had a lovely creamy lemon basil sauce and the noodles were curled into a delicate swirl on top of two very large shrimp that were perfectly cooked.  \n\nThe romaine salad (cuz' calling it a caesar salad would be too easy I guess) had torn croutons, fried capers & citrus caesar vinaigrette.  The lettuce was crispy and fresh and it had just the right amount of dressing.  It was rather small for the price.  There's a guy who comes around with a pepper grinder the size of a baseball bat and I had one bite of salad left and he asked if I wanted some pepper.  Seriously, dude?? I'm almost done!!!  So just to be a smart ass I said yes and he sprinkled pepper on my last bite of salad.  \n\nI tried my husband's wagyu short ribs and OMG it was like the most decadent, tender, pot roast you've ever eaten in your life.  It came with roasted fancy veggies and cheesy grits (although I'm sure Giada would call it polenta LOL) If I ever went back I'd definitely order this.  It was amazing.  \n\nSo....the food was amazing....the restaurant is really pretty....the food takes forever....but overall it's a good time.  I was so hungry after I left.  Luckily my husband's uncle didn't eat much of his chicken so we took it to-go and ate that when we got home.  If I ever went again I'd probably eat a couple tacos from Jack In the Box before I went.  \n\nDear Giada...just because you don't eat doesn't mean other people don't want to eat!  Increase the portion sizes!!! Especially that stupid bread plate.  It's ridiculously tiny and they should really bring one for every two people at the table."

Not terribly disappointing since we were really there for the food, not the views.  I was looking forward to the grilled cheese and disappointed when they informed me they were out.  Long story short, our experience consisted of a lot of waiting...waiting for our table, waiting for our order to be taken, waiting for our drinks, and waiting for our food.  My husband was served his food at least 20 minutes before me.  He politely tried to wait for me as long as he could and ate slow, but his food ended up cold.  The food in general was okay and a little bland.  I would expect more considering the prices.  They were kind enough to discount my meal for the wait, but it will be long before we ever return. I hope I'm not discounting them on a bad day since I heard the table next to us call someone over for water and menus after they had been sitting at their table for 10 minutes without anyone going over.   \n\nDrinks were excellent and bar service was great while we waited for our table, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one."

After examined the menu, my husband discovered that the spaghetti dish he wanted to order, the sauce was made with Mushrooms.  He is extremely allergic to mushrooms, fish and will not eat red meat, so he ordered as his meal 4 side dishes and a glass of wine.  ALL OF THE SIDES WERE GREASY! Honestly, the best part of the whole meal was the Cauliflower soup and the 3 breads the waiter brought at the beginning of the meal. \nAt the end of the meal, I gave them a good rating and paid for the meal $150.80, but wished I hadn't by the time we both got home.

I have always been a fan of her on the Food Network, and knew eventually I would be dining in this semi high end establishment that she has brought to my home town. The day finally arrived and I made sure to come hungry. Now maybe that wasn't such a good idea, considering all the portions are quite small. What is the motto they use, \"I like a little bit of everything, but not a lot of anything\".  That is an actual quote from Giada herself. And I get it. We were able to try a huge variety of items including the baby sweet peppers, multiple cheeses and meats, bucatini, pea pesto tortellini, the surf and turf, lamb, ribeye, a few sides, and a couple desserts. Of all that I mentioned, I would eat the entire meal again in a heartbeat. The pea tortellini and the lamb were favorites. The pesto had a sweet yet savory lemon/butter/basil flavor that was to die for. All of the pasta was so fresh. The portions again were small, between 4 people we shared 3 pastas. No complaints about the size, but the price for 12 small pieces of noodle being $25 is a little crazy to me, no matter who or where you are. I mean sure, it's fancy, with a great strip view and beautiful fixtures and lighting, but when it comes down to it, us natives know what the Cromwell is known for, and it IS NOT upscale dining! And speaking of fancy, I requested a window table with a view because it was the birthday of 2 of the patrons dining with us. We sure did get a window table, but it was in the corner with no view. I watched numerous other parties of 4 be seated in the prime view area. The difference, they were dressed up fancy and my party wasn't. As far as I am concerned, we still spent $500 on dinner, if my guest wants to wear a hat on his birthday, he should be able to. Especially in August in Vegas. I noticed with us being in the corner, we were not offered freshly ground black pepper or the dessert cart like other, closer tables were. Yes, small minimal complaints, but had they not happened, this would easily been a 5 star review. When you pay top dollar for a classy dinner, I expect the full experience. \nThe hospitality in general was fabulous and I was not disappointed with our service in anyway. I feel that any negative comments or feelings I may have, are part of Giada's restaurant as an entirety and not one specific person, dish, or dollar amount. \nOverall, I absolutely would return to Giada's for a special occasion or date night. It was a fun night with an excellent meal!"

She's also a UCLA Bruin which is pretty cool.  When I found out that I'd be in town for a family event, I booked a reservation at Giada on our free night via Open Table.  I had to adjust the reservation slightly when we booked a show on the same evening which wasn't a problem.  We arrived at the Cromwell and the valet asked if we were dining at Giada which we indeed were.  He even offered to give us directions to the restaurant.  It was pretty easy to follow the path and signs within the Cromwell.  \n\nOur reservation was at 5:30 pm and we arrived at 5:15 so we took advantage of the free photo booth and took some pictures.  There's an option to print them right there, send via email or post on Facebook.  We opted for the print and received 2 copies.  After the photos, we sat and waited until they were ready to take us into the restaurant.  There were a few parties ahead of us who arrived at the time of their reservation and they were seated before us, no big deal.  I did notice that all of the hostesses seemed to be wearing very short LBDs.  No judgement as it is Vegas, but according to my boyfriend, my LBD was modest compared to theirs.  We were escorted past the big window and seated against a wall.  It would have been nice to have been seated by the window but I could see the view just fine from my seat and the bright lights of the Bellagio signage.  Our waiter was fantastic and he brought an iPad for us to peruse the different types of antipasti, cocktails, wines, and beers they offer, while he went to get us some water.  We opted for two of the film inspired signature cocktails ($15): Serpico and Barbarella.  Of the two, the Serpico was my favorite with the smooth bourbon and the fun ice sphere with a \"G\" inside of it.  The Barbarella was fruity but not too sweet and gin based.  It was also made with ginger beer so it was like a Moscow mule but with gin.   \n\nFor our meal, we decided on the spinach & buffalo ricotta pizzette with roasted garlic pur\u00e9e & porchetta ($14), mustard crusted rack of lamb served with braised beluga lentils,\nroasted rainbow cauliflower & vincotto ($51) and the Barolo braised Australian wagyu beef short rib served with soft polenta and garden vegetables ($52).  They brought out a spectacular complimentary bread tray.  It came with parmesan bread sticks, cheesy flat crisps, rosemary garlic roll along with lemon butter and pesto sauce.  Can I just say that Oprah's \"I have bread everyday\" came into my head as I ate this?  Because if I could have this bread tray everyday, I'd be a happy girl.  \n\nOur pizzette came out and looked amazing, until we tasted it.  It had an overwhelmingly fishy taste to it.  I had a slice and so did my boyfriend.  I asked him if he tasted the fishiness too and he confirmed my suspicion.  There was nothing on the menu that indicated it was seafood based so we could only assume that they cooked the spinach in the wrong pan.  When our waiter asked how everything was, we asked if the pizzette was supposed to taste fishy.  He immediately offered to take it back and asked if we wanted to replace it.  We felt bad since we had eaten half of it but he assured us that if we didn't like it, he would take it back and take it off the bill.  That was an amazing gesture and I applaud him for his hospitality.  Our entrees arrived shortly after and I have to say, the braised short rib is fork tender, delicious.  The lamb chops were perfectly cooked too.  The lentils were savory and had an amazing flavor.  Normally, I'm not a fan of lentils but I was a fan of these.  We were impressed by the meal, ambiance, and service at Giada.  We didn't have time for dessert, but I did take a look at the dessert menu and I would have ordered something chocolate hazelnut.  Buon Appetito!"

The only negative was when we first arrived, about 45 minutes early, the waitress would not be check us in until closer to 2 p.m.  We will definitely prepare well  ahead next time and make dinner reservations!"

It's hard to live up to the authentic characteristics of a true Italian margherita pizza and this place did it.  The crust was crispy yet fluffy fresh in the middle, thin bottom, sweet and fresh roma tomatoes, ample amount of fresh mozzarella, topped with fresh and large pieces of basil.  I want more!!\n\nThe lasagna from initial reaction was rather small in size when presented in the bakeware.  Once you dive in, it was power packed with flavors from the meat, cheese, flat lasagna noodles and sauce.  Unbelievable taste.  Served with a small arugula salad.  \n\nFor dessert we had the zeppoli - my God, this was amazing.  The chocolate drizzle that you dip the donuts in was mouthwatering.\n\nI also ordered a red sangria - perfection.\n\nEverything about this visit was flawless.  We will definitely be back again.  The atmosphere is fancy but not too showy or intimidating.  The views are just as good as The Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  \n\nWoohoo Giada!"

I love the decor and set up and color and the whole she-bang. the atmosphere was my favorite part of dining here.\n\nthe food was good. not sure if it's because we went on a holiday but the menu seemed a bit limited to me. I did expect a little more pasta dishes since it is an Italian restaurant, but there was none so don't expect any of that. \n\nwhat we ordered:\ntenderloin sliders- I didn't try it, but everyone who ate one was raving about it and said it was the best out of the dishes.\n\nlemon pesto grilled cheese sandwich- we got one with prosciutto and one without. the one without was my dish and I really enjoyed it\n\nsweet ricotta pizza- this was good also! as good as a pizza can get :)\n\nfor about four dishes, it was around $120 which isn't bad at all for a Vegas restaurant. service was great, from the hostesses to the servers to management-- our server was super friendly and attentive! would come back when I revisit Vegas (with a reservation!)"

I was so excited to dine here on my most recent trip to Vegas with friends.\n\nIt was seriously disappointing.\n\nWe were seated by a giant open window facing the Paris Hotel.  It was nice to have a fresh breeze and the view was lovely.  However, the wafting cigarette smoke and noise from the street below was counterproductive to a positive dining experience.\n\nOur waiter was pretentious and trying to over sell us on everything, ($125 Tasting selection, with a take home, souvenir menu). This is more of a theme park, pseudo fine dining, celebrity chef, tourist attraction than an actual good restaurant.  \n\nI don't want to order cocktails off an iPad.  I don't want to have the waiter tell me what to order at each course and I don't want to have the flow of our conversation abruptly halted each time the waiter has something to say, in what I think was a fake, Italian accent.\n\nLet's talk about the food.\n\nBread course - what?\nA large, crispy, flat, cheese crisp - meh\nA few crisp bread sticks - okay\nA warm, greasy focaccia - nice but where's the real, good, Italian bread?\n\nOn the side, little thimblefuls of salt, fried capers (what's with the capers by the way?  They are in everything), a little pesto oil.  All nice touches but what should I do with them? Try to sprinkle some salt on my crispy cracker or better yet, dip a bread stick in 1/8 teaspoon of pesto oil?\n\nFor an appetizer, my husband and I split the Lemon Spaghetti.  It was fine, not great.  No bursting, marriage of fresh, delicious flavors but rather old, unfresh, over cooked shrimp abed a creamy, lackluster pasta that might be featured on a kid's menu.\n\nMain course was described as a whole roasted chicken for two, cacciatore style.\nWhat appeared at our table was the tiniest of all chickens, split in two, on a wooden plank.  Not roasted but more like fried, perhaps oven fried, absolutely flavorless, dry chicken with a bowl of chunky tomato sauce.  Not only was this dish just not good, but it was so poorly described on the menu.  When I read roasted chicken, I am expecting a juicy, flavorful, tender chicken with a delicately crisped skin from roasting in the oven.  When I read \"Cacciatore style\" I expect it to be gently sauced in a fragrant, Italian sauce of onions, tomatoes and garlic.  This was all wrong.\n\nFor dessert, our waiter pushed the lemon meringue.  Again, on the menu, it read like a delicious, soft, fluffy, sweet lemon meringue experience.  What appeared at our table was one of those hard, meringues you can buy in a plastic container at Trader Joe's.  It had a puddle of lemon ooze and a bit of whipped cream on it.  So disappointing.  How do you eat this?  There's no way to slice into this brittle meringue with a fork.  This is a dessert I might desperately throw together, in a pinch, if unexpected guests showed up at 8:00 p.m. on a weeknight.  This is not worthy of a sit down restaurant ever!\n\nOn our second night in Vegas, we headed to our old standby Mon Ami Gabi and I felt sad for the previous night's experience.  I wished I could invite Giada to come over and join us for a truly spectacular meal.  No gimmicks, no pretension, just solid good food and masterful service!"

The only tasty selection was the deviled eggs. My friend, who was reason we went to Giada's in the first place, was really disappointed in the rest of the antipasti selection. I ordered the Baked Sausage & Eggplant Lasagna as my main entree. Considering Giada is italian, I expected her to have her pastas down, but I was also disappointment as this was a $29 plate. \n\nI got to taste my friend's entree, the Italian Chicken & Waffles with Cacciatore Sauce which was pretty good in comparison every thing else we had tasted. The cacciatore sauce was delicious, and the waffles had great texture. \n\nGiada's dining area is beautiful, but we were really expecting to enjoy more than just the ambiance, and a bite of egg and a sauce side considering a $130 meal for two."

            "review": "Local review, so I may be biased because of course you can find better priced meals anywhere off of the strip, but it was my birthday so we decided to venture out. We had the choice of having the pre-chosen courses for $120/person or just decide on our own. We decided to choose our own, and it came to exactly the same price per person.\nWe had:\nLemon Crab Arancini $19- Okay, but it sort of fell apart\nPea Pesto Crostini $15- good\nArugula Salad $15- It was supposed to come with candied lemon (whatever that is) & crispy pancetta. There were maybe 3 pieces of pancetta. It was basically a plate of argula and olive oil & balsamic vinegar for $15. Definitely not what I expected.\nCaprese Salad $19- the mozzarella was very good & fresh\nRisotto $32- good, very creamy and light and fluffy\nRavioli $36- ok\nSurf & Turf $56- This is when I had to remember my Italian that I took in college. That plural ends in an \"i\" so when I saw raviolo instead of ravioli, I thought it was strange that you only get 1 raviolo.. really Giada? So your turf is a poorly cooked piece of meat, be sure to check and send it back if your medium rare comes out medium or well done. And your surf is 1 raviolo stuffed with crab. This was very disappointing for $56 dollars!!\nSalmon $39- was okay, slightly raw, but I'd rather have slightly raw salmon versus dry and over cooked salmon. But here's the kicker, it was placed ontop of lima beans and corn. Pretty sure the lima beans and corn came from the freezer section of my local grocer. \n\nI was disappointed. Again, maybe it's because I'm a local and I could eat elsewhere or even my own kitchen for a whole lot cheaper and probably the same if not better prepared/cooked food. But it was an experience... an experience I probably won't have again, but an experience nonetheless and I'm okay with that."

Therefore, imagine my disappointment when my high expectations of her restaurant was shattered. We had a completely OVERPRICED Tasting Menu, about $120 per person, which includes an autographed picture of her. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. I am a foodie, and this was soo overpriced, with such bad service (took them a 1/2 hour to get us drinks with an 8:30 dinner reservation), that I am sure I would NEVER recommend this place to any of my friends. Of the 4 course meal, which includes: antipasti, bread, 3 choices of pasta, 3 choices of a main, and a desert cart... the antipasti and the desert cart were the only thing to rave about. The bread came in 2 small sized baking ramikens, where each of us (8 people) could only have 1 small piece, maybe a bite and half worth of bread. The pasta was ordinary with some good flavors, and the beef, lamb, and salmon was nothing to rave about. Again... TOTALLY OVERPRICED. Also, it was soo loud that we had to yell across the table to hear each other. And the waitstaff were so slow with bringing bread, or drinks, or even water... that you thought that they forgot about you. \n\nPeople, if you want good pasta, go to Scarpetta or even Lupo's... Giada totally missed the mark. IF you really want to eat here, order al a carte, and only order the pasta and maybe some anti pasti. Sorry, this was a total dining fail."

Not helpful when you've dropped your fork on the ground and need a replacement while your food sits and gets cold. \n\nThe food itself was good, but of course, the portions are small and very highly priced, which wasn't a surprise....just don't go there when you're ravenous.You'll leave ravenous.\n\nWe had a party of four and were able to taste test each others meals.

Probably the most difficult part of the dining experience was getting a reservation - My husband called two weeks prior to my birthday and they told him only thing available was after 10:00 PM - not acceptable - He did manage to get in a bit earlier that I would have liked (5:15) but was glad that we got to try it.\n\nWhen you walk in you see a plethora of fresh foods in a spotless glass refrigerator case and as well  an open wood fire stove with several little red pots inside.  Humm I wonder what those are? Fresh pastas are also hanging in view ready for their 3 minute hot bath before serving. \n\nService starts with a bread plate...Here comes the little red pot of hot freshly baked rosemary bread served with savory bread crisps and sticks and nice dipping and sprinkling assortment that includes pesto and lemon butter.  You will want another pot o bread for sure.\n\nNothing better than fresh pasta - My daughter had one of Giada's signature pastas, a nest of angle hair pasta flanked by two tender jumbo shrimp - She did not leave even a speck of pasta on the plate.  I had parpadella with pork - fresh - sauce like my grandma used to make and wonderfully tender shreds of pork.  My husband had the surf and turf -  The turf was an excellently prepared fillet of beef cooked to perfection - He was less satisfied with the turf that was a crab ravioli.  He wanted a more traditional surf maybe more substance than a single ravioli.  His was also served with sauted asparagus and snap peas which he really enjoyed.\n\nWe were very full from our meal but did indulge in some lemon icebox cookies and peanut butter and raspberry cookies - a satisfying end to a very nice meal.\n\nIn addition service was excellent - Wine list was very nice and appropriately priced for the overall price point of the restaurant."

My first was the D Bar Denver, where I live, owned by Food Network Celebrity Chef, Keegan Gerhard.  My second restaurant was Giada's, in Las Vegas.\n\nI made our reservation on Open Table the day before and were able to book the time just 15 minutes outside of what we were looking for.  We arrived, were greeted by the hostesses, and immediately shown to our table.  Our waitress, Tina, showed up minutes later welcoming us to Giada's.  You could sense her dedication to her job, her love of Giada, and pride for sharing with us the menu, guiding us to what we would most enjoy eating for lunch.\n\nOur table faced the strip, but also the mountains beyond the strip.  The windows were open, and you could faintly hear the bustling on the street below as people were laughing, talking, and walking by.\n\nGiada's decor is warm, welcoming and if you take time to really look around, you will see thoughtful meaning in every aspect.  Her flower print chairs have what I refer to as, kitchen cupboard handles or pulls, on the backs~ perhaps making it easier to pull the chair out for someone.  Her slatted window blinds are ceiling to floor and are BIG, but really beautiful.  Her lamps have phrases cut in them, and her bar shares a glass cooler where beautiful olives, cheeses, wines and breads are on display.  Behind this bar is a burning wood fire oven and next to it is fresh pasta, hanging in rows in a glass case.\n\nOur lunch of salads and lasagna were delicious.  Beautiful presentation, just the right flavors throughout each bite, nothing overpowering any of the other ingredients.  As we were enjoying each bite, I turned around, and there was Giada; standing on a bank of steps which enters part of the dining room.  People in the restaurant began to walk up, shake her hand, hug her, tell her how much they loved her, and of course have a photo with her.  She welcomed each person as though they were coming into her home and were friends.  I was so impressed to know she exudes the same warmth and love you feel sitting at home watching her show through the television! \n\nGiada is real, down to earth, grounded, caring and grateful.  We were sitting close enough to overhear most of her conversations with people, and she just kept thanking them for choosing to dine in her restaurant and thanking them for their compliments.  She probably stood there for 35 minutes greeting people.  Wow~\n\nI returned to eating my salad, and somehow, it tasted even better after watching her, meeting her and realizing how authentic Giada truly is.  While I still want to eat at more Food Network chef's restaurants, I'm somewhat leary that it will just never compare to my experience here.  I guess we will just have to see~\n\nIf you are ever in the Vegas area, you must come try this restaurant.  Even if Giada happens not to be there, you will feel her not only through her food, but in the manner in which you are treated by her staff, the humor in her pepper grinder, and the subtle thoughtfulness in her decor!  I personally can't wait to come back from breakfast and dinner sometime!\n\nGrazie mille e tantissimi auguri per il tuo locale ed il tuo successo!!\n\nDiane~\nDenver, Colorado"

We were celebrating our wedding anniversary there for dinner. \n\nWe were excited to be returning as it was about a year ago that we ate at Giada's. We enjoyed the experience-both food and level of service. We even ordered the tasting menu and ordered a bottle of wine. It was definitely  worth the splurge. \n\nHowever, our second visit wasn't what we expected. We were seated at a window location, which we appreciated. We decided on ordering off the menu this time around. But also chose a bottle of Pinot Gris to go with our dinner. Our appetizers came quickly- we ordered charred octopus and grilled sweet peppers. Loved every bite of it. However, our entrees did not quite arrive in a timely fashion. I think it was about 25-30minutes before our server had informed us there was a mistake on the restaurant's side. Our bill was paid for by table next to us, and therefore closed out. So that explained the delay, but we still waited another 15 minutes or so for the food.  I ordered  the spaghettini with shrimp. The noodles were cooked al dente, but the sauce was to creamy and overpowered the taste of the dish. Not as great as my first experience (especially for the wait). My husband ordered the Branzino (grilled white fish). Which he enjoyed and I also liked the seasoning and flakiness of the fish.  \n\nThe dessert we ordered was a chocolate espresso cake. This was decadent and probably the best part of our meal. \n\nWe were offered a 10% discount on our meal for the delay. We were appreciative for that gesture.  \n\nIn total we were there for about 2-1/2 hours. I wasn't really impressed this visit and may not be visiting agin the next time we are in town.  Especially Not for the amount we would like to pay for fine dining. \n\nThe opening was excellent and it set the bar high for the restaurant.  No matter what, I still love Giada and her cooking."

Decor lovely, great view of strip if the shades are raised but at 4:30 they would not raise the shades claiming the sun or reflection would be too bright. We were there almost 2 hrs, no reflection or bright sun ever appeared (we could see under the mostly lowered shades) so no unobstructed view was ever made available. \nGreat selection of wines and interesting cocktail selections. Very good glasses of wine available in several styles.\nNow the bad news: the food.\nRestaurant had just opened for dinner and they were out of the grilled artichoke, which the waiter did not even know about until he turned in our order. How can you be out a dish on the permanent menu when you just open and the staff doesn't even know about it? Stuffed dates were dry, no sauce, 1st time in my 33 yrs of marriage my wife didn't love them! Salads were okay at best, pasta with vegetarian ragu was excellent, salmon okay, lemon shrimp pasta was 2 shrimp in house made spaghetti with a light lemon flavor. Not bad but for $26 way overpriced and only 2 shrimp. Not the knockout signature dish we were expecting or hoped for. \nLemon smashed potatoes were okay but would have been better had they been hot when served. Cheese plate nothing special.

They should call is something else because it is nothing like the traditional Roman specialty. Before ordering I asked the server what the carbonara is like, whether it's eggy -- I always do this when ordering carbonara anywhere because so many restaurants butcher this dish -- and she said it's \"very good with only a hint of cream and one of my favorite dishes on the menu.\" So I felt confident it was going to be great. Instead I got one of the smallest portions of pasta I have ever seen (more like an appetizer portion for $24!) that was barely warm in a bland cream sauce with a few specks of bacon or pancetta (there was so little of it I couldn't tell) and onion. Not at all what I had expected so I only had a few bites.\n2. Margarita pizza -- Barely any sauce or cheese. Tomatoes were sundried. Came out cold and pretty dry. Definitely not oven fresh.\n3. Lasagna -- This was the pasta of the day and definitely the best choice of the three entrees we ordered. That said it was a pretty generic lasagna and nothing special about it. Came with an arugula salad.\n\nAfter the dishes were served it took at least 15 minutes for anyone to come by to check on us. My husband had finished his pizza by the time the store manager happened to stop by as she was making her rounds. When I told her I was disappointed about my carbonara she immediately took action and the server came over to replace my dish. I asked for the soup instead (minestrone) -- I wanted something quick since everyone else was pretty much done with their meals --  which sadly again, was bland and very disappointing. \n\nTo the restaurant's credit they addressed our situation with a lot of apologies and complimentary cookies which were delicious -- peanut butter chocolate, lemon ricotta and chocolate chip. Next time maybe I should skip the main meal and go back just for dessert."

Just in case you forget where you're eating. \n\nNot sure why, but everything I ordered had lemon in it. Including my cocktail. \n\nThe one thing that stood out to me was the bread. They give you bread sticks, these cheese crackers, and a little pan of focaccia. This comes with a tray of toppings to compliment: fried capers, lemon butter, pepper flakes, pesto, sea salt. This was great! \n\nSpaghetti: no it's not your red sauce with meatballs. Creamy lemon sauce with 2 prawns on the side. I don't really like shrimp but these were very good. Pasta was very light and delicious. Also $34 for a very very small amount. \n\nSquash crostini: prosciutto and lemon ricotta with squash bits. These were good, but 4 little toasty bits cost me $15! \n\nIn the end, the ambience, the presentation and the food made it worth it. Very pricey for the portions though. Oh and the check comes with an iPod which I have no idea what for."

The food gets 3.5 stars overall.  Our table ordered the Gorgonzola pizza with kale and mushroom, the sweet ricotta pizza, the carbonara pasta, the tenderloin sliders, and the muffuletta sandwiches with the fried zucchini. The bread and pesto sauce that came with our meals were delicious, best part of the meal. The tenderloin sliders were very tender and flavorful. The other dishes were average.  Honestly, the pizzas tasted similar to California Kitchen Pizza's, except Giada's crust was much better.  The carbonara pasta dish is small.  I did not like Giada's version of this pasta dish.  The muffuletta sandwiches tasted good, but the bread was a bit too tough and chewy. The fried zucchini side dish that came with the sandwiches was light and perfectly seasoned. For desserts, we ordered the Italian donuts, the gelato, and the crostata. They were also average.  Maybe their dinner dishes will be better."

            "review": "I'm grading on a curve here, but for a restaurant this expensive (the most expensive Italian restaurant I've ever seen) I just wasn't all that impressed.  First, the good:  A diverse menu of Italian dishes, meant to be enjoyed over at least three courses.  A nicely appointed room, with a great view of the Strip -- Caesar's Palace and the Bellagio across the street (somewhat marred, on the night we dined, by the massive fatal car crash just down the street; but that's hardly Giada's fault).  And, Giada really knows how to pack the flavor into her dishes.  My bacon wrapped dates, crab crostini, and tricolore salad all screamed their respective flavors.\n\nBut, there were some aspects I didn't care for.  First, the food is rich, rich, rich, even for Italian.  Even though I only had two appetizers and a salad, I felt bloated on the way out; and I can usually pack it away.  Second, the relentless emphasis on Giada's name.  Our waiter only mentioned her about two or three dozen times.  The plates, menu, and even the towels in the bathroom were emblazoned with \"Giada.\"  I've never seen anything like it at any other celebrity chef restaurant, and I've been to a bunch of them.  Third, and I really don't know how to explain this, but the atmosphere just didn't feel comfortable to me.  The dining room is a little bit crowded and a bit of a maze to get through.  The menu is a slightly difficult to figure out, and the waiter wasn't that much help (the answer to every question about the menu was a story about how Giada loves this or that dish).  And the presentation of every dish was, kind of \"Wow!  Look at me!\"  In short, everything was just a little bit overwhelming, and I guess my mental image of Italian food is of comfort food in a homey environment, so it just felt a little off to me."

The contract for the private room had been signed months prior and when we arrived the table was set for 16 and we had 20 guests.  To make matters worse, we only had one server and I got my first cocktail after my 3rd request more than 30 minutes after arrival.  The wife of the \"birthday boy\" made the mistake of breaking out in tears and asking to see the manager and I personally witnessed his rudeness.  After placing his hand just inches from her face, he told her she needed to \"back off\"  and told her she was out of bounds.  After many years in the restaurant business I can confidently say he needs to be fired. \n\nThe food was anywhere from good to incredibly scrumptious.  Antipasto was fabulous as were the all the first courses from chicken meatballs marsala to beef shoulder cured in red wine that was ridiculously savory and delicious.  The bone in rib eye was off the charts and the giant prawns and pasta were really good.  Our solitary waitress for a party of 20 did the best she could and reinforcements finally showed up to help about mid-way through dinner but the entire experience was severely tarnished by a bad first impression and a thoughtlessly rude manager.  \n\nAs an aside, the party's host and hostess had stopped by the restaurant earlier in the day and reminded them about the increase in guests and a member of our party who  was staying at the hotel and also mentioned the problem to management earlier in the day to no avail.  Someone had the audacity to bring up a contract that had been signed over a year prior that had multiple \"amendments\" that apparently never found their way to the manager on duty.  Sadly enough I will have to favor B&B on future Vegas visits for their excellent food and superior attitude and service."

The food is just ok, but there is no way Italian food should be priced this high.  You are paying for the name \"Giada\".  On top of the cost of the food, we were mis guided by our waiter in suggesting a wine that we though was $50 a bottle and when we got the bill, it was $150.  Be sure you know what you are buying here.  They will run your bill up in a hurry if you are not watching.  The service was just ok as well. This place was the highest cost restaurant we ever ate at and it was far from something you would want to pay around $500 for just one couple for dinner with tip.  We just felt ripped off!\n\nSeriously for a famous chef, walk across the street to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  Yes, it is not Italian food, but Bobby does not gouge you in the cost of his food and it is awesome!   \n\nSave your money and go elsewhere.  So many options in Vegas, and no need to put this place on your list. If you want good Italian at a reasonable price go right around the corner about 2 blocks, to Battista's Hole In the Wall.  It sure is a hole in the wall, but they have great Italian food for a good price."

Located inside the Cromwell Hotel and Casino: The ambiance creates an airy, fun-filled scene, with beautiful breathtaking views and whimsical white-washed shutters that allow the summer winds to slowly blaze in. The visuals of an Italian deli and candid photo booth add the right amount of style to the gorgeous setting.

However, the entire meal was ruined by our awful server.\nWe waited 30 minutes past our reservation time, which I can accept for such a busy place, but it would have been nice if there had been any acknowledgement of the wait at all. Especially considering it was 6:15 and I had made reservations 2 months in advance. Instead, I watched as the hostesses twirled their hair and looked bored. My bestie and I looked past this though as I had been previously in August and had a fun and delicious meal.\nOnce we finally got seated our waiter came to greet us. He was very friendly, telling us all about the menu and the wine. This demeanor changed immediately upon learning we were not drinking alcohol. I couldn't drink and my friend did not want to drink without me. I was however still very prepared to eat a ton and indulge! \nWe no longer had this urge after receiving just our drinks. I ordered an ice tea which my mother ordered upon my visit previously. The presentation then was so beautiful and I was looking forward to it again, something I mentioned to our waiter. A few minutes later he returned with a diet coke and my tea. I know tea, I drink tea with breakfast lunch and dinner, and this was not good tea. It was bitter and over brewed and tasted like it had been sitting out for quite awhile. I let our waiter politely know, this seemed to annoy him further, and waited. Upon his return he carried the full presentation I had been expecting the first time! He then tells me without any hint of apology, \"He didn't know where the tea bags were so he just gave you what the cooks were drinking.\" Then he just walked away! He didn't present the tea the way the other waiter had and he acted like getting served what the cooks were drinking was acceptable for 6 dollars! \nWe proceeded to order the dates with sausage and marscapone and parmesan and honey for appetizers. These were both ok but I don't think we enjoyed them much wondering what type of kitchen they came out of. We each ordered just a pasta because our appetites were quickly being ruined by the continued attitude from our waiter. These were both very good, the bucatini and the tortellini were fresh and perfectly al dente. \nOnce finished with our pastas I was still hoping to salvage the meal with my favorite part of my previous experience: the dessert cart. However, in an attempt to get us to spend more (which we would have had our waiter not been a jerk) we were handed the dessert menu instead. Each dessert was twice the price ($12-$14) as on the dessert tray ($6) plus we didn't get the fun of seeing all the beautiful desserts! We decided not to order anything due to overall disappointment with the experience. Once we said no to dessert our waiter did not utter a single word to us. I could not believe how rude and unprofessional he was. I guess he didn't think we had spent enough to care about our tip, so that at least saved me some money.\nSuch high hopes, and I won't be back. So many other delicious places in Vegas with great service. Don't waste your money or your time unless you like being treated poorly."

You cannot go wrong with ordering off the menu (even the drink menu!). If you have doubts, ask your server who is very attentive to your needs. \n\nWhen we visited in late July, we were fortunate enough for Giada to be there. (If she's there, you get a small glass of Prosecco) Even more fortunate was that she made rounds and stop by our table to see how things were going and took a picture with us! She truly seem interested to make sure we enjoyed our experience even though I bet she was tired being one of the later dinners of the night (9:30 reservation..she probably came by around 10:30p)\n\nMy only gripe is that some of the tables are really close together (in the area we sat there were three small couples table together). So that was a little bit of a drag. It's not like the other couple was annoying, but sometimes you need some personal space! So keep that in mind, or so show up in a group of 4 :)\n\nA first class dining experience through and through and the price reflects that!

First my friends tried to make a reservation on OpenTable and there was nothing open for over eight weeks. So I said why not call them I called them and I was able to get a reservation for the evening we wanted but not until 830. They called me to confirm the reservation the day of and the only change I made is I said there will be six of us instead of five of us and the person on the phone said that was fine.  We got there at 7:30 to enjoy a drink in the bar. We were turned away saying the bar was full and to please come back at our reservation time. So we went to bound. See my review on bound. When we came back the hostess very unkindly told us that our reservation was at five not 830. That's when I started to get a little angry. It was just about this time that a manager came over apologize profusely told us to hang out for a few minutes and she would get us one of the best seats in the house. My gosh from that point on it was a completely perfect dining experience. There was a dessert cart right there where we were waiting and there were two people manning the dessert cart and they were very happy to tell us about all of the desserts. When we got our table we were asked if we would like a tour of Giadas kitchen which we took. When we sat down at our table the view was absolutely breathtaking. When I made the reservation they asked if there was any special events we were celebrating. I said we were celebrating several birthdays including my own. The first thing they did was bring us a complimentary St. Germain cocktail which was absolutely delicious absolutely unexpected and absolutely appreciated. The service was absolutely impeccable. We started with the large Caldi platter and the Salumi and cheese platter.  Her menu is broken up into small plates and a traditional Italian course meal. On the Caldi platter you could get some of her best small plates. We had two different kinds of meatballs calamari shrimp scampi eggplant Rollitini fried zucchini and lobster Arancini balls everything was amazing. However we sort of wanted to have entr\u00e9es too so we ordered the Rissoto with scallops and the tortellini and the pitzetti. It was all fabulous. However I would be aware that these dishes are also very small so if youre hungry get a caldi platter also!!!  It's really worth it! Then the dessert cart rolled around again they took so much attention to details they had written happy birthday in chocolate on our dessert plates. Everything on the dessert cart is six dollars but the best deal in the house is you can try five desserts for $14 which is what we did obviously. We sort of made fun of one of the dessert and so the dessert waiter gave one to us for free just to try it or Maybe because he thought we were funny. Either way it was a perfect way to end the meal. Looking around this restaurant is just beautiful you can see the picture of our view that I posted but the attention to detail is amazing. My favorite thing is her light fixtures say I eat a little bit of everything but not a lot of anything which I think sums up her menu perfectly. I will go back again and again and again and I truly hope this attention to detail this service and the amazingness of the food is in it for the long-haul and not just because it's a new restaurant."

I've never been given so many choices of things to spread or sprinkle onto my bread products !     the drink menu and food menu were very descriptive and everything sounded delicious !   we obviously couldn't try everything but what we did try was very well done, with one exception.   the \"drunken goat cheese\" was unexpectedly thick-ish slices of  hard cheese in the nature of Parmesan chunks with sons odd tasting crunchy things sprinkled on it and a small amount of a balsamic mix sauce on and under the cheese.     for dessert I had the limoncello souffl\u00e9 which was outstanding !   service was excellent from beginning to end and the pricing was fair considering it's fine food in a celebrity chef restaurant in a casino on the Vegas strip.    5 stars !!"

We were seated at a booth with a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower from the Paris and the fountains from Bellagio.\n\nWe started with  Salumi Picante, followed by Giada's Caprese, then Sausage & Eggplant Lasagna, a side of the orzo meat ball.  They were all really good, I just wished the lasagna had more eggplant.  The pizza had a really nice dough, crispy and chewey all at the same time.  All pasta are made in house.\n\nI had a sangria, it was light and refreshing.

When I received, however, it was very mushy and effectively fell apart when I tried to pick it up - in total contrast to the crispy sandwich I had on my first trip. The worst part, however, is that the waitress told us that this is how it was supposed to be.  We then brought it to the attention of another waiter who admitted it was not right and brought a replacement immediately.  So saved by the nice waiter!"

Even from the lobster arancini and pea pesto crostini, we sensed fresh aroma of lemon, and it was amazing.\n\nThe contrast between the homemade spaghetti (light) and tortellini (rich) convinced us the versatileness of pasta dishes. No simplistic marinara / alfredo are provisioned here at Giada, which is what exactly we'd expected.\n\nAnd the Tricolore salad with gorgonzola, dates, walnuts and prosciutto... perfect balance of bitterness, sweetness and crunchiness.\n\nBy the time we get to the dessert we were completely full, but were unable to resist Tiramisu per the waiter's recommendation - glad we ordered!\n\nIt's a great idea for Las Vegas to have a fantastic restaurant like Giada at the most prestigious intersection on the strip - what can I say?

We were greeted by Giovanni and WOW so phony! Every question we asked his answers were so fake! It was to the point you didn't even want to talk to him.

Some things just fell short this time around... Like your photo booth. Don't forget to fix that =)\n\nI visited Giada's restaurant and tried the tasting menu. This menu was made up of some of Giada's favorites. Service and food was good. Not mind blowing, however. Giada is pricey and I can't 100% recommend it to everyone. I'd say, check them out for brunch if it's your first visit. You'll invest less money and those chicken and waffles look amazing.\n\n\n\nTASTING MENU\nBread platter - cool presentation. *Tip: put this aside and eat it if you still have room\nlater. Practically everything else they will serve you is more worthy of your stomach space. \n\nRigatoni - pasta cooked right. tasty sauce. good dish\n\nGrilled squid - this one was a disappointment. This dish seemed pretty ordinary. The flavor just wasn't right.  Even the texture wasn't what I had hoped for. I had this dish before at a lunch Giada hosted and it was AMAZING. I'm guessing that it is usually better as i have also heard how great this is from others.\n\nCorn Side dish - really tasty. At this point, however, i was getting full and i couldn't enjoy this as much as i'd have liked to. \n\nCrispy Potatoes - good but not as good as the corn. \n\nWagyu beef short rib - very tender. ok same problem here as the corn. I was full at this point and couldn't enjoy this one that well. Don't get me wrong, i finished every last bit of it haha. \n\nDessert Cart - Three is a great number Giada.  In fact, it's my favorite. But when you bring such a beautiful cart around, you can't limit us to JUST three items. One of each item sounds appropriate, right? \n\n**COFFEE - After I finished dessert, i was asked if i would like coffee. I assumed this was included so i just went ahead and ordered. Had i known that it wasn't, I definitely would not have ordered this. The drink itself was fine but i had been full three plates ago. Plus, the coffee isn't cheap. Careless on my part, but putting this in case anyone else has the same situation. \n\n\nSERVICE\nI like how they let me customize a lot of my order. After looking at the regular menu, I saw some things that I really wanted to try. These weren't options on the tasting menu but they had no problem substituting them in. I even modified the cocktail I ordered. \n\nI also appreciate being seated at the table with the best fountain view. *Note: the restaurant is still only on the 2nd floor and therefore part of the view is obstructed by a bridge. \n\n\n\nPARKING\nI ended up parking at Flamingo's parking structure. Parking is free there and it is a very close walk to Giadas."

I'm glad I took her word as it was a delicious meal.  The front staff wasn't super friendly or warm but after you got through the doors the experience changed.  \n\nI was by myself but they gave me a phenomenal seat right along the window.  I was lucky enough to see Giada there too as she came out to speak with the table next to me.\n\nI started off with a cocktail and had to try the tasting menu after the waiter described it to me.  Plus I was able to bring home an autographed photo of Giada for my wife.  Be prepared because the tasting menu is massive so you better be hungry.  They first brought out the bread plate which was awesome and the lemon butter made it that much better.  The tasting menu started off with bacon wrapped dates, a stuffed pepper with cheese and Vitello Tonnato crostini.  All were delicious but I loved the dates and I'm not a huge date fan.  For the second course I had the super tasty lemon spaghetti with two of the most massive shrimp I've ever seen.  For the third course I got the roasted lamb which was good and the mustard crust made the meal.\n\nFor dessert you got to choose from 5 which was too much.  I had the strawberry gelato (yum), a strawberry tart, lemon ricotta cookie, amaretti cookie, and my favorite the blueberry tiny donut.\n\nExcellent job Giada!"

Unable to get water, drinks, or appetizers from her she instead threw attitude when  we got them directly from the bar (who I'll admit every one of the counter staff were amazing). Finally being seated at the empty table I'd been staring at for nearly an hour, a quarter of the menu is unavailable not because they ran out but rather because they put the wrong menu in and the kitchen was unwilling to cook that menu. Being pushed heavily toward the rather unimpressive special we instead had appetizers, some salumi, and oysters, a few drinks and our dinner was instead a light snack. Next time save half the price and get twice the meal, go to Joe's."

I made reservations for my party of 7 for 8:00pm. We arrived to the restaurant at 8:05pm, and we were asked to wait while they were setting up our table. While we waited, my party and I took advantage of the complimentary photo booth that is right outside the restaurant across from the hostess stand.\n\nOnce we were seated about ten minutes later, our server Rocco was very informative and patient with us as we were a larger group. Rocco is probably the only redeeming factor in my experience at Giada's. \n\nMy group ordered antipasti for the table - the orzo meatballs, calamari & shrimp, and the Cacciatore Tartufo (salami dish). I believe there was a misunderstanding between my ordering and Rocco because a cheese dish came out instead of the salami. Rocco was very accommodating and fixed this quickly and left us the cheese plate, which ended up being one of the only things I enjoyed. The cheese was so aromatic, full of truffles and I knew instantly I was in love. The salami was a great pairing for the cheese as it was a perfect mellow flavor to cut the sharpness of the cheese! I highly recommend these! The other only thing I enjoyed for the night was the calamari and shrimp. I know it sounds very cliche to order calamari at a Italian themed restaurant, but the calamari and shrimp was seasoned very well and the lemon aioli made the dish.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the lobster ravoli and it was decent. The sauce was very light and I was not expecting that, but I feel like it wasn't very developed as a sauce. The other people in my party ordered the crab and scallop risotto (it ended up tasting better if you sprinkle some of the truffle cheese on top), the bucatini (not impressive), and the whole roasted chicken for two (I was told it was dry, but the caccitore was a flavorful touch).\n\nAll in all, I expected a higher quality meal for the price I paid. Would not go back."

Very small portions which if you know anything about Giada was to be expected, but the quality was definitely a little lacking. \n\nThe dough and the sauce on the pizza were great but the cheese was already hardening when the meal was brought out, like it'd been sitting around for a bit. The pasta tasted very fresh although a little tepid for what we were expecting. The real disappointment however was the caprese which claimed to be made with buffalo mozzarella. I'm Italian from the same region as Giada and buffalo mozzarella has a bit of a tang and is normally a little softer; this was very bland and dry. Places like Obica in LA import mozzarella and burrata from Italy and that is the real deal with the right taste and consistency. For $19 I got halved cherry tomatoes and there was no way the cheese was made of buffalo's milk as claimed. We ended the meal with the zeppole to share and these were surprisingly light and served with nutella which added a nice touch.\n\nThe service meanwhile was impeccable, quick, and smooth. Overall it was a decent meal but for almost a $100 the food should have been amazing. Very beautifully prepared in a lovely setting but I expected perfect Italian quality and taste and didn't feel that was delivered."

The entrees were well prepared, well presented, and delicious, but once again on the smaller side (6 average size lobster ravioli for $37).  The view of the Las Vegas strip at sunset is exactly as advertised.  The service was excellent and attentive.   Our entire party appreciated the hosts turning away the drunks coming over from Drai's day club and improperly attired. \nIn a town where fine dining can be found in a myriad of places, I doubt I'll come back here due strictly due to the value issue.

First of all, my husband made a reservation but didn't write down the confirmation # and at check-in, there was no record of it.  We were very disappointed but immediately, the host manager told us she would work us in in about 20 minutes.  We walked into the restaurant and loved seeing the kitchen; same idea as the Eiffel Tower restaurant.  We sat at the bar and met two bartenders.  The male was terrific and very easy-going, personable, and loved telling about the drinks and the atmosphere - very engaging and you could tell he loved working there.  Sadly, the female that ended up making our drinks was not like that.  She would giggle and say she didn't know certain things about the restaurant and she seemed very clumsy while making our cocktails.  My husband had a rum drink that looked like a snow cone which was super cool (and tasty) and I had the Destroyer, which was made with tequila.  I think it could have been made better and muddled more, but the ingredients/idea were awesome.  The host manager came to the bar and took us to our table.  We sat just above the actual dining room but as close to it as possible.  My husband had an actual chair but I sat facing him on the couch/bench seat.  Those need lumbar cushions!  It was not ideal for eating.  We had the pleasure of having both Josephs serve us and they were both equally amazing, funny, respectful, kind, smart... everything you'd want and expect from fine dining servers.  We also met a Sommelier, Darius, and he, too, was amazing.  I would like to give an extra special shout out to Juan, who delivered our bread.  He knew every single type of bread and all condiments, he was lovely, smiled, and answered our questions.  I got the impression he was a bit nervous and lacks confidence, but he is a gem!  He will soon become a terrific server, without a doubt.  He was far more knowledgable and personable than the female bartender, that's for sure!  The overall atmosphere was a bit confusing to me.  Was it trying to be a club?  The music was distracting to me.  The decor was *not* what I would have expected after seeing Giada's TV set, and I truly hated seeing her name or initial everywhere.  I liked the white on white napkins with her name, and I liked her name on the To-Go bags, but did not care for it at all on the back of the bar stools or on some of the dishes/plates.  \nNow to the food... 10 Stars for that!  We started with the grilled octopus, which was indescribable!  We will order that again, and again, and again.  We also had the gorgonzola dolce, which was terrific.  For entrees, I had the lobster ravioli and I ate every single last bite.  The pasta was delicate and the lobster was plentiful.  My husband had the veal saltimbocca.  He ate it all but said he wouldn't order it again as it was pan-fried.  And for dessert, we had a variety of cookies, and the lemon ricotta one was out of this world, but we also had the honey almond chocolate ganache tart.  O.  M.  G.  !!!  I wanted to make my house out of it.  It was so delicious and a perfect balance of creamy and crunchy.  I would go to Giada's again just for dessert and order that tart.  \nFood = out of this world.  Servers = amazing  Bartender = 1 great, 1 not Atmosphere = tried to be different than your traditional Italian fine dining but became too eclectic for me."

We ordered some cheese to start that was pretty good, for my main course I ordered the lasagna with arugula salad on the side and my friend the lobster roll with zucchini scapecce (that tasted like oil and nothing else..). Lasagna was very bland.. I asked for salt that took forever to get to the table.. The lobster roll? same, no taste at all. What ashamed! I didn't finish my plate.. Then I decided to ask for dessert so I can have something in my stomach for the rest of the day. \"Someone\" (not our server) cleaned up the table and I noticed he didn't pick up some arugula leaves that fell from my plate to my placemat.. So when he came back with the dessert he put the dessert IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE instead of in front of me (since my placemat was dirty)!! My friend started laughing at the situation and I was speechless.. The tiramisu was nothing extraordinary.. And my friend's coffee was ok... I looked around and although the place itself is pretty the little care with cleaning and attention to detail was not to the standard of a famous chef's restaurant  .. Food on the floor, dusty.. I never thought I was gonna listen to Aerosmith (which I love) in an Italian restaurant?? For a moment I thought I was eating at the Hard Rock Cafe..The music selection was like they picked someone's Ipod and played it! Overpriced for the whole experience.. For that price? I rather go to Nora's on flamingo!! And I won't smell like CAMP FIRE when I leave.."

The tasting menu was great because we got to taste a lot of different things. \n\nFor the lunch visit today, my husband and I were seated on LV Blvd side looking at Caesar's. A little tucked away, but it was fine. Our waiter Christopher was really great. Polite, professional, but friendly. I got the SLAT or Smoked Salmon/Lettuce/Avocado/Tomato with an arugula salad. The sandwich was good! Lots of stuff on the sandwich. It's open face though, so had to eat most of it with a fork and knife. My husband got the Carbonara pizza. It was awesome! The crust was great and the pancetta was great as well. \n\nOverall I really like this place. It's pricey, so just keep that in mind. Total bill minus tip + one glass of wine was about $50."

The entire dinner was about 3 hours long, but it was a delightful 3 hours because the setting, the wait staff, the food, the cocktails, and the company I was keeping were key components to my enjoyment that evening. The bread board is delicious and consists of focaccia and cracker breads and is served with 5 spreads; lemon butter and pesto were my favorite spreads. Burrata cheese with Balsamic salt and chicken Marsala meatballs were the appetizers we chose and we  did not regret our choices! There are many great selections on the general menu, but we decided to go with the tasting menu. An antipasti plate with bacon wrapped dates, cheese-stuffed peppers and tuna tar-tar crostinis start you off, followed by a second course of your choice of either lemon spaghetti or vegetable Bolognese. I selected lemon spaghetti because I make lemon spaghetti at home and naturally, I had to try it at Giada for comparison...it was great---as is my own if I do say so myself ;-). The third course is a choice of either salmon on a bed of summer succotash with whole grain mustard (my choice and it was delicious), or Sicilian roasted Colorado lamb (I tried a bite---also delicious), or Farroto with fava and morels. The sides were smashed lemon potatoes and a dish of sweet corn with spicy Italian sausage...they did not disappoint! The tasting menu was very filling...AMPLE portions! If you go with the tasting menu, you can select 5 desserts from the dessert cart. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of one dessert that I particularly enjoyed; although, the lemon ricotta cookie was another favorite from the dessert cart. I left with the recipes for the lemon ricotta cookie, and two pasta dishes, which were a gift if you ordered the tasting menu...I was tickled pink to get that cookie recipe presented in a special Giada envelope and an autographed Giada photograph. This might not matter to some, but I thought it was a unique touch that I've not been offered at other restaurants. On your way in or out of Giada, note that there is a small room with a black curtain by the escalator...it is a complimentary Giada photo booth! Be sure to take advantage of this complimentary feature and take home a souvenir photo strip...the machine will shoot out two copies for you to preserve the memory of your visit there! :-)"

We were greeted and seated at our exact reservation time.  Our waiter for the evening was excellent.  He was phenomenal with his knowledge of the menu and what goes into each dish.  There was no shortage of suggestions from our enthusiastic waiter.  \n\nA complimentary bread basket was brought to the table filled with several types for everyone to enjoy.  One was a small baked bread dish with amazing flavor.  It almost looked like a bread muffin but easily sliced.  Three spreads were accompanying the bread including an amazing pesto.  Loved that! The drink menu was easily browsed on a tablet which included what was in each specialty drink.  I'll just say the La Strada is awesome! I'd describe it as a spritzy light adult lemonade.  Fabulous! \n\nI chose the Risotto topped with crab and scallops.  Creamy and filled with the perfect amount of seafood.  I'd highly recommend this dish to anyone.  And of course we couldn't skip dessert. I had the lemon cake topped with a chocolate ganache.  Yum. The lemon and chocolate flavors were perfectly balanced.  I loved it.  Plus I had a bite of my husbands delicious molten lava cake.  \n\nI'd also like to highlight the manager Michael who recognized me from a Yelp event almost a year ago.  I was pretty impressed and flattered with his memory of me.  A big thank you to Michael for topping off a memorable dinner.  \n\nEvery part of this dining experience was great.  I'm already excited to come back to Giada's.  It was perfection."

You feel like you are not in a restaurant but an open room having dinner in someone's dining room off a kitchen.  \n\nGet the meatballs and the sandwiches are spectacular.

Don't miss the selfie picture booth while you wait for your table.  \n\nThe first time we ate here we were seated along the window with a great view if the strip and Bellagio fountains.  My colleagues had pasta dishes and I had the prosciutto grilled cheese sandwich.  \n\nThey messed up my colleagues dish ( forgot to add chicken) and then it took a while for it to come, but the hostess and waitress were extremely and sincerely apologetic.

            "review": "I adore Giada -- she basically taught me how to make and enjoy Italian food, and when I found out she was opening a restaurant in Vegas, I knew I had to go. \n\nThe restaurant is so beautiful. It is elegant, simple, but with very distinct decor and lighting fixtures. Clearly, every detail was thoroughly planned with a creative eye, from the tiles to the placemats. Even the stemware had a feminine touch. \n\nWe were greeted by some very lovely hostesses--they looked amazing in their matching short sleeved white eyelit dresses. (I want that dress!!!) We were seated by the window, which gave us a view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nUnfortunately, I wasn't impressed by the quality of the wait staff. We sat without menus or acknowledgement for 5 minutes, we were promised water but didn't receive any for another 10 minutes, and then we were promised bread, which also didn't arrive for another 5 minutes. Our waiter also got parts of our orders wrong--my friend received the wrong side, and I received a red sangria instead of a white sangria. He was polite and did acknowledge the long wait time for basic service and corrected my friend's order quickly. When our appetizers arrived, the plates were just thrusted randomly on the table by the food runners, which I felt seemed tacky.\n\nAnother surprising thing was how dirty some of the utensils were. There were bits of food on both my fork and knife, and the spoon for one of our appetizers had dishwasher stains all over it. Not harmful in anyway, but just very surprising for what I thought the basic standards of an upscale restaurant would be.\n\nDespite receiving the red sangria instead of the white, I ended up being thrilled about the waiter's mistake. This drink was so very refreshing and tasty--it was everything I would expect a Giadian drink to be: light, fizzy, fruity, and elegant! \n\nWe started our meal with a couple of appetizers: chicken marsala meatballs and a plate of gorgonzola cheese. The meatballs were tender and juicy, but lacked flavor; however, the mushrooms, sauce, and blistered tomatoes were delicious. The gorgonzola came with raw honey and pear slices, and each bite was decadent and dreamy.\n\nFor my lunch, I ordered G's baked pasta of the day, which came with a side salad of arugula and generous parmesan (ahem, I mean parm-i-gi-a-no re-ggi-a-no) shavings. The pasta was a lasagna loaded with hearty vegetables, tons of ooey gooey cheese, and topped with a parm crust! How does that not scream Giada? The salad was light and refreshing with a lemony dressing, and the parm shavings on top were the perfect salty bite.\n\nI couldn't leave without trying dessert--Giada has quite the sweet tooth, right? I was torn between the zeppole and the strawberry tomato crostada, but ended up choosing the crostada because of how unique it sounded. Wow, it was EVERYTHING. The crust was buttery and crisp, enveloping a tart and sweet red filling with fresh strawberry slices on top. I wanted more! \n\nThis is definitely somewhere I NEED to return to--I am going to make a reservation for dinner and THEN find a flight to Vegas!!"

            "review": "I'm not in love with Giada's.. but my review truly reflects a 2.5 as the food was very good.. \n\nThere were so many things that just took me out of enjoying the experience fully. We arrived at 715 on a Wednesday night so it wasn't terribly busy but it wasn't empty by any means. We are locals and ae familiar with convention schedules and whatnot, so we chose to go on a quieter night. \n\nMy date and I had a nice array of items. We started with the 'Spicy Italian Sausage Arancini' served with parmesan fonduta & pomodoro sauce. As well, we enjoyed the 'Fregolotto' (fre-go-LO-toh) with roasted rainbow cauliflower, garlic pur\u00e9e, parmigiano, kale pesto, crispy prosciutto. We shared them both as appetizers and they were both great. Rich, delicious flavors and good portions, everything very shareable. The pasta was split for us in the kitchen as well, which was greatky appreciated. Bread offering was also good but i saved room for dinner so I didn't really have much of it.. though it was delicious. \n\nFor the mains we shared the 'Surf & Turf' 7oz filet with two large prawns, port wine sauce, creamy gorgonzola gnocchi & baby carrots, and the 'Barolo Braised Australian Wagyu Beef Short Rib' served with soft polenta, & garden vegetables. \n\nI ordered my filet medium rare and it was perfectly cooked, and one of the better steaks I have had recently. The Creamy Gorgonzola Gnocchi were also delicious. Again, nicely portioned and really perfect texture on the cooking of the filet. Just so good. The Short Rib wasn't my favorite. Although I do really like short rib and I do really like polenta. The flavor profile fell short for me personally,. The wine component was great in my mind, but maybe it just didn't translate well to my palate after having things like the rich gnocchi or the port wine sauce ont he steak. The polenta also came across a little unseasoned.. but again maybe it was me. My date didn't care for it, so it was pretty much uneaten. \n\nWe had a couple of cocktails and some California red blend wine.. and everything was good. No question when the food was being cleared as to why we didn't eat the short rib, but we wern't looking for any other food so it wasn't a huge deal. I would have appreciated it if they had asked though. \n\nNow, a couple of thigs that I want to mention are in the interest of constructive criticism. \n\nMainly, our server was so blatently intent on upselling us on everything.. which is part of his job I realize, but it was a bit rushed and short of quality service. Not staying with us at the table in terms of presence, constatnly looking elsewhere while we were asking questions and looking for suggestions, (based on how we wanted to manuever the menu nicely without over-doing it but still getting a few items to try.) \n\nEvery request for guidence was met with short, curt responses. Pointing at the menu seemingly going for the priciest options was the answer to everything. The money wasn't the problem, we knew what we were geting into.. but, I would have liked a bit more personalized service based on our cocktails and wine.. and just not so hurried. It may be asking too much. I was fully aware of the other tables and how he was being sat so I wasn't intending to take up time, but it felt rushed and I just didn't care for that. \n\nAnother thing - the backwaiter or server assistant, was really a big distraction.. and I honestly don't mean to be rude.. but when you are trying to have a nice quality meal -  the sound of silver being loudly set onto tables, and clanging together while being polished and then tossed into a drawer or sideboard of some sort - is not cool. Also,frequently we were asked if we would like water botlle refills, and forgotten.. and then asked again and forgotten. Not the biggest deal but it made me feel like it was a turn and burn situation. I didn't like that at all. \n\nOn top of that, the 'back of the house' conversations and opinions of other guests from the backwaiter and the servers - were just inappropriate. Finger pointing and crude remarks that were clearly meant to be offensive. The guests being spoken about may not hear you, but we heard every word. It's something I may not have even noticed, were I able to stay int the moment and just enjoy myself.. but that silver clanging had me hearing and noticing everything else that was going on. \n\nSo overall, food 5 stars.. but service was like 2.5 stars. I'd go again, maybe sit at the bar.. I do like quality food and they have it. \n\nWell.. Happy Eating To You!"

When they sat us at our reservation time, it was in a tiny back area with a window to nothing that had blinds we had to open ourselves.  We are not complainers at restaurants, but I felt given the special night, I wanted to have the experience there that I planned.  When the hostess came back with our menus, I asked her if it would be OK if we waited for another table, as we had requested a view.  She first said that we could wait if we wanted, but that people were lingering in that area so that's why they sat us here.  My husband and I started to discuss whether we wanted to wait or not, she then went on to say that they just sat everyone in that area, and it would be quite some time.  ?  Really?  At that point we gave up.  How did they just seat everyone there when I had requested that area months in advance?

It's been said before, but I am your biggest fan, and like most Foodies I love you for your charm, class, and most importantly, your cuisine, and maybe holding you up to that pedestal turned this much anticipated dining experience into a fail. \n\nWe took our most important client to Giada to really WOW them, and luckily the good outweighed the not so good this evening, and I am positive that you yourself would have been disappointed on several key points.\n\nFirst the good. Giada is located on the second floor of the new and very chic Cromwell hotel. Upon entering the host staff was attentive and perfect. Moving into the restaurant the antipasto bar and kitchen, as well as the overall ambiance and layout of the restaurant was outstanding. You could also see Giada's touch in the tableware and glassware selection. The view of the strip and the fountains of the Bellagio were outstanding. So far so good.\n\nThis evening I had decided to order for our guests family style. Having selected most of Giada's signature dishes prior to arriving my plan was to have an uninterrupted meal by not having to have every guest be distracted by the extensive and creative menu. Upon seating I discussed with our waiter, who was also excellent, that I would be ordering appetizers, salads, pizzette, salads, as well as a pasta and family style main course. I outlined our selections prior to even ordering cocktails and wine selections, and what happened next was simply inexcusable, and the reason I would never return. Before we could hardly finish placing our cocktail order and wine, here come the appetizers, all of them, too many to even fit on the table!   I have no idea how they could have even been prepared so quickly. I waived half of them off and asked the waiter to please pace our dinner!  At least let us have a drink in hand before all of the food arrives.  I understand the importance of turning tables at a new hot spot, but this was a terrible start for sure.\n\nAs for the cuisine, the bread service is excellent and creative, with a very nice skillet focaccia, cheese crisps, and breadsticks. We started with the bacon wrapped dates with sausage, and what can be bad about anything wrapped in bacon?  They were good, but the texture was a bit dense. We then had the Artichoke Arancini, which seemed to be void of artichoke, and nothing special. Next I had wanted to order the signature Mortadella pizzette, only to be told that I would enjoy the margarita pizza much better, that the Mortadella pizzette was simply \"Shaved Italian bologna on top of a crust\". The margarita pizzette was only okay, and I have had way, way better.  So much for the highly anticipated Giada appetizers.\n\nThe next course however was a winner!  The signature Tri-colore salad, with dates, kale, lettuce, and a healthy helping of a very fine quality prosciutto. Everybody raved about the salad and we seemed to be back on course...no pun intended. Next came the pasta course, and I had ordered another signature dish, Giada's Ziti. Although the ragu was delicious, the pasta itself was on the hard side of Al Dente. Scott Connant would have ridden Giada for this misstep.  Finally I had been drooling for our final main course, Giada's highly acclaimed Chicken Cacciatore. The plating was unique, with the actual ragu delivered on the plate in covered ceramic pots, and the roasted chicken arranged on the plate around it. Again, the ragu was excellent, but the very plain looking roasted chicken was dry, and the plate completely void of any garnish.  It would have probably been a better idea to serve the dish traditionally with the chicken actually covered by the ragu, which might have masked the dryness of the chicken.  \n\nFinally the dessert cart came, and for the cost of the desserts I took one look and asked where the \"grown-up\" servings were.  We passed on dessert and went elsewhere to finish our evening.\n\nGiada, I love you, but again, I think if you were on-site that you would have been disappointed this evening.  We left feeling that this was not Giada's restaurant, but simply a new restaurant that just happened to have your name on it.  That said, I give this 3-Star rating for the ambiance, class, and creativity, but there is way better Italian to be discovered in Las Vegas."

He made no suggestions and was no help at all when it came to the menu or what we should order. The bread dish that they served had little dishes with condiments in them and they were all cracked and chipped.  They were out of the one dish my husband wanted to try, the lobster ravioli, and it was early in the night. The food was so-so, appetizers were good but the Veal Saltimbocca was just a large veal chop put on a plate that was brown, mushy and very unappetizing.  The plate had nothing else on it, no garnish, nothing. We left very unfulfilled and will never recommend or try any of her restaurantsin the future."

This visit I partook in the dinner tasting menu. The Rigatoni with vegetable bolognese was delicious, fresh pasta cooked perfectly all dented makes you realize the number of times you ate pasta incorrectly, what a difference in flavor and texture. Crusted Rack of Lamb with grain mustard give a hint of spice to a wonderful flavor profile.dessert consisted of lemon ricotta cookies, polenta cake, brownie, tiramisu, banana gelato and strawberry sorbet. I could go on about the desserts but I will say my favorites were the polenta cake, light and tasty, lemon ricotta cookie, vibrant flavor of lemon will make your mouth pucker but go for another bite and the banana gelato, creamy, sweet and marvelous flavor of banana won't disappoint. If you have the opportunity and tine to sit and enjoy it, go for the tasting menu, it requires table participation but with that you are able to order different items which means you can share and sample the numerous selections available in one trip which makes it worth it, not to mention you also receive a souvenir copy of the menu, a few of the recipes and a signed picture of the executive Chef, Giada. Thank you staff for another wonderful dining experience!!"

The entire wait staff was attentive and knowledgable in the menu. \nNot sure why the Yelp map shows the location near the Sands Expo when this is on the corner of Flamingo and the Strip. We had a table over-looking Flamingo which was good since the tables on the corner got the setting Sun heat at our time of dining. A walk by the antipasti case as you are walking in lets you know of things to come. \nA few minutes after sitting down, we get the fresh baked focaccia and bread sticks. We ordered the taster menu and started with a platter of antipasti - Giada's favorites. It had bacon wrapped dates, eggplant rollatini, stuffed peppers, and a few crostinis. The wife and daughter got the lemon spaghetti with shrimp and I got the rigatoni vegetable bolognese (to be different) as seconds. If their shrimp was any bigger, you'd think they were lobster tails! For thirds we ordered Farrotto with Fava and Morels (daughter), Seared Salmon with Summer Succotash (wife) and Sicilian Roasted Lamb (me). This came with family style smashed potatoes and sweet corn with spicy Italian sausage. The food was amazing in presentation and taste and cooked to our preferences. For dessert, we received a plate with a tiramisu, strawberry/tomato tart and cookies. We've seen Giada do her Strawberry/Tomato recipe on Food Network and it was delicious! The waiter, Joseph, also brought our daughter a birthday dessert of three scoops of gelato. This is the type of wait-staff that could develop their own clientele of regulars. \nThe whole dining experience was unrushed and comfortable. People watching on the Strip is always interesting!\n\nOne odd thing - while at Giada's, all three of our iPhones were drained of their power at an alarming rate!"

You may get one dish here or there that hits but for the most part the plates sound like they might hit, but don't deliver. The ambience and decoration are \"nice+ish\" while it does feel a little like a new Vegas version of the Cheesecake Factory. The entrance is nifty but it definitely dances with cheesy.\n\nI  WILL SAY, the service was awesome. Everyone who helped me was attentive and quick. Real congrats to the staff.\n\nSo like I said, the food is ok, but when the restaurant itself has cooking shows of the creator playing on loop, flavor expectations start high.

After waiting 10 minutes past our reservation time and watching several other parties that came in after us get seated my husband went to find out what was going on.  He was told we were next to be seated.  We were seated in the worst area of the restaurant (in our opinion) back in the corner on a long bench with tables squeezed together.  I guess to have the view you need to make a reservation a month out and then bribe the hostess.  Our server never gave any type of explanation of the menu (the server at the table next to us did though).  Very unpersonable, never checked back on us.  Our food was delivered to our table before the juice I ordered was.  Needless to say we won't be back.  You really should value locals as much as you do the tourists."

Reservations are required; my girlfriend made ours months in advance due to the grand opening. While waiting for the table, we took pictures at the photo booth which was cool. When the hostess sat us, she gave us a mini tour of the prep areas where they make the hand made pasta, marinated olives, pizza, focaccia, etc. Everything is fresh and looks amazing!\n\nWe had a seat near the opened window, overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountain. Our server was very personable and knowledgeable, I'd expect nothing less. He brought us probably the best tasting focaccia I've ever had, and we ordered the sausage stuffed dates as an appetizer; also amazing. Perfect combination of salty, sweet and spicy. \n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, I ordered the branzino and my girlfriend had the spring pea and panceta tortellini. The branzino was perfectly cooked, and the citrus sauce and arugula salad made it very refreshing. The tortellini was fantastic, and I'm not one that likes peas.\n\nFinally, desert came and I wasn't expecting much. We ordered the tiramisu which came in layered shot glasses. My Nonna makes great tiramisu, so I had high expectations. There were three flavors: pb&j, chocolate and blackberry lime. All three were delicious, but pb&j was the best! We ordered mochas as well, extremely decadent and garnished with Giada's signature \"g\" in chocolate. A pretty heavy desert but well worth it. \n\nOverall, just a great experience in terms of food and service. Giada even came to our table and talked with us for a little. Gotta say, it was pretty unforgettable, will definitely be going back!"

It wasn't lobster bisque where talking about here, it was pasta fagiole.  90% broth with a 5 or 6 white beans.  I am not exaggerating either.   Service is where work is especially needed.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation of our party of 8.  Since we were early, we had no problem waiting in the bar for our table.  They assured us that our table was getting ready.  45 minutes later, 30 minutes past our reservation, we were finally seated after several inquiries and several reassurances that the table was almost ready.  What the ????   And to add insult to injury our server in the bar was a dingbat.  Our dinner server was adequate though.  \n\nIf it ever was acknowledged by the staff that we had to wait 30 minutes for table, I wouldn't be so upset.

Your name is Giada and so is your restaurant.  I've been to a lot of places to eat and can't think of anywhere I've ever seen such a thing.  Before we got to see all of her monogrammed items, we had to wait for a table.  The hostess said we could sit at the bar with no wait, or wait 20 minutes for a table.  Since we were all starving, we walked into the bar to get a seat to avoid the wait.  Well that's humorous because there is maybe 6 bar stools and they were all taken.  Then the other couches and table in the area are just a waiting area, not a place to sit and eat.  So back to the lobby we go.  While we walked back out to get on the wait list, I looked over and the restaurant was practically empty!  They we're only seating the tables around the edge by the window.  All the other tables stayed empty.  I'm guessing b/c it was lunch or maybe lack of servers but whatever the case, not a great first impression.\n\nOnce seated our server was very professional.  (I think Stephanie was her name).  I ordered the Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese with heirloom tomatoes because I love lemon, pesto, and grilled cheese sandwiches so how could this be a miss.  The server recommended I add the Prosciutto di Parma which was at an upcharge of coarse that I didn't notice but still added per her recommendation.  Unfortunately this sandwich was a huge disappointment.  The lemon pesto and prosciutto was all I tasted.  The sandwich was over cooked so if there was any cheese on it, it had all melted off and was non detectable.  And those were not heirloom tomatoes.  Small, flimsy, roma tomatoes at best.  I picked it apart and tried to eat some of the bread but it was just not good.  What was good though was the Spinach & Buffalo Ricotta Pizza.  The dough was so fresh and the pizza offered great flavor.  The only thing about it I found flavorless was the thinly sliced porchetta on top.\n\nThis was not a restaurant I had bookmarked and could have gone without visiting during this Las Vegas vacation, but when your starving and tired of trying to make a decision, you take what you can get."

We said okay and decided to wait at the bar of course.  While walking to the bar, we realized that there is about 4 people max in the restaurant area.  So why did we have to wait you ask?  Good question.  \n\nOnce we got to the bar, Beau the bartender asked if we were dining at the bar.  Good idea Beau!  Since they wouldn't seat us. So we dined at the bar with beau.  Beau was good and attentive and Max was good as well.  \n\nThe food:\n\nWhite Lasagna - taste decent.

We had a reservation and were given a great table for lunch on good Friday.  I was excited to try this restaurant as I love Giada.  Hubby and I started by sharing the meatballs.  I gave them an 8.5, hubby a 7 (he felt they were a little drier than he would have liked and lacked browning).  Next we shared the margheritta pizza.  This we both gave a 9.  Excellent crust, cheese and the tomatoes were to die for.  Appeared to be sun dried in marinade and so yummy.  Unfortunately lunch had a turn for the worst, while eating alarms stared going off.  No one explained what was going on and all the guest were unsure if we should evacuate.  Finally they stopped and the dining area became very smokey.  I went and found someone to ask fearing a bit for our safety.  Apparently there was some type of water leak in the kitchen and the kitchen was being shut down.  The ventilators weren't working so all the smoke was billowing into the dining room.  Of course this can't be helped, but we were unable to order anything from the kitchen.  Which was disappointing as I was looking forward to trying a dessert.  The smoke was burning my eyes so I was ready to get out of there.  This is where my review goes from 5 stars to 3 stars.  We were not offered any type of compensation for this.  Our lunch was filled with smoke, alarms and disruption.  Had something been comped for our troubles, or perhaps a complimentary sorbet, I would feel differently.   I am torn about whether I would go back, while I loved the space and felt the food was really good and a great value for lunch prices, I am not impressed with management that would handle the dining crisis by charging diners full price for an alarm smoke filled partial meal.  Side note, iced tea 6 dollars for one small glass.  I would not order that again.  Perhaps a refill was possible, but our waitress was very inattentive, but benefit of the doubt because there was a lot going on."

First, they have a fun complimentary photo booth for customers waiting or after a meal. Such a great concept! \n\nSecond, the staff at Giada is pure quality. They take care of you while making you feel respected. They are so polite it's unreal. \n\nLastly, the food is so delectable. Most of the time when going into fancy restaurants you don't expect much from the food because it's just supposed to be good. Giada really tastes like home. The recipes,  tastes, and flavors that go into making this delicious food is quality. \n\nIf you're looking for a quality experience that will remind you of home, Giada is a must!"

However, it it the \"people\" who make this a great experience and a tribute to Giada's name.\n\nFrom the moment you are greeted at the top of the escalator until you pay your check (very reasonable prices for the high quality of food), you understand that the people working there are really happy to be there and to be of service to you.  They are right there for your every need and request.\n\nMy hat goes off to the manager of Giada, as he is doing a difficult job and getting a 10 Star result."

She gave us suggestions and was right about everything she offered as a suggestion.\n\nWe started out with the cured beef, which came with the most amazing pickled cherries.

My family and co-workers enjoyed a spectacular dinner. Three of us had the Barolo Braised Australian Wagyu Beef Short Rib, one Veal Chop Saltimbocca and Pappardelle. I initially wanted the AU Short Rib since I was just in Australia and two employees recommend it. The dish was fantastic. It melted in your mouth.

It's an elegant restaurant and resembled Giada's taste. The lamb Colorado chops were melting in our mouth and  flavorful. Also the calamari was very light panko  I believe breaded and delicious. The complimentary Rosemary bread was so yummy. And when they opened the windows where we were sitting was the best view of Las Vegas strip and also the decor of the inside. And everyone working there was very friendly and prompt. My 5 and 2 year old sons always watch Giada's foodnetwork shows and saw her photos and asked the hostess is Giada's here? They love watching her cook as do I. We just wished we could of met her. The hostess said she's in Italy. We were there on Memorial Day weekend Saturday. We will definitely go back."

Other than the setting and service, I can't say I was very impressed. If it weren't for her name being all over the place I don't think this restaurant would be as successful.\n\nFor apps we went with the charred octopus which was quite tender, some wonderful burrata with balsamic salt, and a salumi plate.\n\nPasta dishes being what Giada is famous for, we decided to order a few of her classics and forgo the entrees as they didn't seem very interesting or appetizing. As she is also known for her dramatic pronunciation of pastas, it was funny to see the pronunciations spelled out on the menu. \n\nAfter much deliberation, we ordered the \"spah-geh-tee,\" the \"ree-ZOHT-oh,\" and the \"tohr-teh-LEE-nee.\" The risotto was hopelessly undercooked and underseasoned with the crab and scallops very sparse. The spaghetti was okay, but this was supposed to be \"the\" dish. The massive prawns that accompanied the pasta weren't very warm but were clearly overcooked. I enjoyed the tortellini with kabocha squash and crispy prosciutto most--maybe because it was drenched in brown butter.\n\nMy wife is a fan of Giada and has a couple of her cookbooks (we even attended a book signing), but from now on we'll stick to making the dishes ourselves. They turn out better that way and are a hell of a lot cheaper."

            "review": "After a weeks' long stay in Las Vegas, the one meal that is most memorable is the one I had at Giada.  Even against the Michelin-rated restaurant we went to on our first night.  Maybe it's the familiarity of Italian food, the comfy coziness you come to expect from a really good pasta, or maybe it's Giada herself.  Either way, I loved this restaurant, the service, and most importantly, THE FOOD.\n\nWe decided to go with the tasting menu - may or may not have something to do with the free autographed picture of Giada and recipe cards that come with it.  Whatever the case, I thought we made a pretty good choice.  It started with an antipasti platter.  This included small bites of a stuffed sweet pepper, tuna crostini, and a bacon wrapped date.  All of them were quite tasty, the tuna especially.\n\nSecond course was the most heavenly and delicious lemon spaghetti with shrimp.  I seriously could have just stopped right here and been perfectly happy.  The pasta was homemade, which is a huge, huge plus.  Delicate lemon cream sauce and two large shrimp.  We were told it was a smaller portion of pasta, but it was plenty big if you ask me.  I hated giving most of it back as I knew if I finished it, I wouldn't be able to eat anything more.  Luckily, one of the recipe cards we received was for this dish, and my husband and I are so excited to make it at home.\n\nThird course was a seared salmon atop a bed of summer succotash in a light mustard sauce.  The salmon is cooked medium rare by default, which I know is the ideal temp for salmon.  However, the server was quite aware that not everyone in the world is okay with eating what appears to be something undercooked.  He informed me of this ahead of time, which I appreciated.  I asked for a medium salmon, and that is exactly what I got.  To me, it was PERFECT.  It wasn't over the top on seasonings, but somehow it was extremely flavorful.  Light, flaky and paired perfectly with the succotash and sauce.  Again, I had to send most of it back because I was getting too full at this point and I didn't want to miss out on dessert.\n\nMy husband got the lamb, and he enjoyed it very much.  We also received this dish as a recipe card, so I'm sure we will be having lamb at our house in the near future.\n\nAccompanying the entrees were two family-style sides: smashed potatoes (glorious!) and a sweet corn wth chorizo.  I loved both of these.  They are the epitome of comfort food to me.  Another thing I could have just eaten all by itself and been perfectly happy.\n\nLast course was dessert.  They bring over an unwieldy, awkward cart filled with about 10 or so different things.  We were seated in a narrow space with tables on either side, so I have no idea how this cart ever made it over to us.  I was so full by this point that dessert didn't even sound good, but we split a peanut butter/raspberry jam tiramisu anyway.  It was surprisingly light and very satisying.  It was a small, single portion so if you're on the verge of unbuttoning your pants at the table, I think this item will be just enough dessert for you.\n\nWe did get one of the chocolate cake things to go.  And then didn't proceed to eat it until the next night.  It didn't taste all that great, but that could've been cuz it sat in a plastic container for over 24 hours.\n\nI really had a great time at Giada and would 100% go back if we were locals and had the opportunity to do so.  I've already recommended this restaurant to several friends, and of course it is one of the highlights of my vacation recap.  To anyone trying to decide where to eat while visiting Las Vegas, all I can say is GIADA, GIADA, GIADA!  You won't be disappointed."

Everything is light and airy and everything is adorned with either her name or a G. Not four minutes in, I think I heard her name from the hostess or a server at least 10 times. \n\nThe food was wonderful, small plates, larger plates, etc.. It is a little on the pricey side but nothing that will really break the bank. It's definitely a place for a nice evening out. The pastas were standout, super tasty, with the lemon spaghetti and JUMBO prawns as particularly delicious.\n\nI loved the dessert cart though the presentation of the actual desserts was somewhat simple. I mean, it's basically just a cookie on a plate. The white chocolate coffee gelato was amazing and I'd definitely go back for more.\n\nSomething of note, we were offered \"still\" or \"sparkling\" water -- we took still, inferring that to be plain tap water. Apparently \"Still\" was the name of the ($8) bottled water and it took us two bottles to figure out what was going on. Absolutely not a deal breaker by any means but we joked about our $8 water cocktails we purchased.\n\nWith great views of the strip and a non-Strip-like atmosphere, I loved our dinner at Giada and would gladly go back."

Not a single thing about this restaurant reminded us of her warm personality and her constantly stating how important \"branding\" is. This place screams \"I have more investors to please than I can handle\" and \"this is my first restaurant\" like crazy. Prices need to reflect this as it is not even close to being on par with other \"celebrity chef\" restaurants on the Strip. There is a lot of work left to be done here. \n\nThat being said, most of the food was fine. Everything needed a bit of editing and more salt. The \"grilled\" artichokes with lemon a\u00efoli were served ice cold, and the \"grilled\" zucchini & eggplant involtini was served room temp. The pancetta in the arugula salad was chopped way too large for such a delicate salad but the parmigiano was sliced perfectly thin. The a\u00efoli was by far the best thing on the table all evening.  We were honestly surprised we could not hear Drai's, but, when all the windows were opened, it became too loud to hold a pleasant conversation. We did not complain, but our waiter kept apologizing profusely. And that was our cue that it was time to go. So we did.\n\nThere are so many better restaurants on the Strip for the same price range, it's really not worth a return visit. I highly suggest reading the other reviews to get a better picture of whether or not this is the dining experience you want to have. I wish we would have."

The decor is very nice, and the restaurant is bright with large windows on the corner of the Strip and a side street.  The staff, male and female are all younger and attractive.  \n\nHere is the so-so - the menu is not terribly inventive, a Mediterranean survey of pasta, risotto, and other fairly typical italian/mediterranean dishes.  Nothing really jumps out as a \"must order\" item.  It is very pricey, and the wine list is high (sure, as are most of the nicer Strip restaurants).  The two appetizers we had (chicken meatballs... 4 small ones, and 5 bacon wrapped dates) were ok, but not worth the approximate 30 dollars we paid for them.\n\nHere is the awful - We made an early reservation and announced to our server we had to make a 7:30 show.  We were assured that nothing we ordered would be a problem for our time frame.  After over an hour, and several assurances that it was \"on its way\", we gave up.  We announced to the manager on the floor that we had to leave, and offered to pay for what we did receive - two appetizers and a bottle of wine.  At that moment, our entrees arrived and the staff offered us... to go cartons!  They accepted our offer to pay for the wine and the two appetizers, and we left, furious.  \n\nTo the manager's credit, she did invite us to return after the show to try dinner again.  Even though the concert was outstanding, we were in no mood to so quickly go back there.\n\nDon't be dazzled by a TV personality name... there are many other nice places to try on the Strip.  I look for an interesting menu, food well prepared and presented, and good service.  Didn't find it at Giada."

Great food and cocktail menu, just all a little more expensive then they should be but I get that it's Vegas (Cocktails are $15 each).  We had two appetizer platters, two bottles of wine, some cocktails, dinner plates, and coffee for dessert and it came out to about $125 per person.  I enjoyed the Bacon Wrap Dates, the Crab and Scallop Risotto, and coffee for dessert.  Attentive excellent wait staff that went above and beyond.   I would definitely come here again, especially with a large group when you aren't sure what everyone likes to eat (we had people visiting from all over the world and very different palates),as they have a diverse enough menu that everyone enjoyed it.   Only 4 stars because I felt like it was overpriced, and although the food was excellent, nothing was really out of the ordinary or inspired in any new way.

I felt like I was watching one of her shows and eating the dishes as she describes them. She cooks with lots of lemon, parsley and parmesan which are definitely present in her restaurant dishes and I like that she's putting things on her menu that she really would/does cook.\n\nThe arrancini were light on the inside and super crispy with good lemon flavor. The bolognese was terrific very earthy flavor and bold like when you get it with meat but it was vegetables. \n\nI think her style of cooking is good fresh flavors but not   overly complex. You can taste the pea soup and actually taste peas, parsley and maybe a touch of mint maybe lemon too. I think you have to appreciate that kind of style to really enjoy a meal here.\n\nI actually also make her recipes from her tv shows at home so they are good and accessible. Sometimes you find recipes and need to buy so many ingredients you go broke. Or have to spend so much time prepping you are exhausted by the time your are done cooking.\n\nI really feel like her style of cooking is reflected here.\n\nAll in all I thought the food was delish.

The only other thing I noticed is that when the place got busy our waiter seemed to disappear.

I went with my husband, brother and sister in law.  I actually noticed, as I was describing everything to them that I sounded like a stalker, but whatever.  I recognized the artwork immediately because Todd's friend, the artist, was featured on an episode a few years ago.  I explained to \"my guests\" who he was and why he was special.  \n\nI was very excited that Giada hand makes all of their pasta.  It was delicious.  The prep kitchen's were all open to the bar, it was nice because it made you kind of feel like you were standing in the kitchen, it also reinforced the whole family style atmosphere that they try and create.  I was very proud to explain the menu to my guests.  They had no idea who Raffi was so I was delighted to not only explain her relationship to Giada, but also that she has the most darling personality that you can imagine.  \n\nWe got the antipasti plate.  It was good, honestly I would request it next time without the stuffed peppers.  They were boring and not that great.  The eggplant dip was good the crustini with tuna was awesome, the dates were good and the other crustini they put on the plate, I think it had a pea puree on the bottom wasn't bad (not my favorite either)  We also got the Burrata, (it was terrific, but could use the addition of a few crustini to accompany it). The bread basket and accompanying dipping sauces were absolutely amazing.  \n\nMy brother and sister in law ordered the vegetable bolagnase and the veal chop, they loved them both.  Greg and I ordered the chicken cacciatori and the boccatini pasta, the pasta was a little dry, but the flavor was really good, the chicken was terrific.  \n\nLastly, the evening wouldn't have been nearly as special if it weren't for our waiter.  He was italian from Milan and I can't remember his name, but I will try and request him the next time I go.  He was awesome, the service was top notch and he went out of his way to make sure that we had a wonderful experience.\n\nI can't wait to bring my daughters back.  They will absolutely love the restaurant."

            "review": "My wife was very excited to eat at this restaurant.  Of course, we all know who Giada is and we were expecting to be blown away by the food, atmosphere, and service.  A big disappointment would be a good way of describing it.\n\nThe hostesses were nice and we felt welcomed. We made a reservation for brunch, which was the first weekend they ever served it.  A table next to the window with a view was nice so it was easy to pass the time waiting for our food.\n\nI made the mistake of wanting an appetizer.  Yes, they cost more money than they are worth.  Yes, they come in very small portions.  That is a given at most of the nicer restaurants, so it didn't really bother me.  What I ordered bothered me.  Meatballs.  I ordered meatballs because the waitress recommended it.  Mediocre at best.  My wife makes better meatballs and she's   not a very good cook.  I could make better meatballs if I bought some frozen ones and dumped some Ragu and cheese on it.  At least I could have 50 of them for the price of the four I received in a cup and saucer.\n\nThe presentation consisted of meatballs in a cup.  Can you imagine reading meatballs in a cup on a menu?  Surely no one in their right mind orders meatballs in a cup.  Do not order this, unless you just hit on the craps table and you don't know how to blow through your money.\n\nMy wife ordered a nutella latte right at the beginning.  She did not receive this drink for a long time.  When it finally came, it looked nice because who ever made it wrote a big G in chocolate  on the top.  Little did we know, the G was for Garbage.  It tasted like a regular hot chocolate.  Neither of us could taste nutella at all.  We both took a couple of sips, then the drink sat on the table untouched.\n\nNow for the food.  My wife ordered... sorry, i can't remember what she ordered because it was so forgetful.  Oh yeah, it was eggs, toast, and some kind of tomatoes.  Usually I remember all the details but at this point, I stopped caring.  I felt sorry for her, but also laughed and made fun of her for making such a terrible choice.  Needless to say, she didn't eat it all, and it wasn't because it was a large portion.  She also ordered a pastry.\n\nI ordered the $29 chicken and waffles.  More like the $not worth it chicken and awfuls. I'm not sure if I ever felt so mad over $29.  Luckily, I only yelled and cried on the inside so I didn't embarrass my wife.\n\nI have made better waffles at a continental breakfast.  I've made better waffles without looking at the instructions.  They call these things $29 waffles?!  They make me sick.  \n\nYou know what made me sicker?  The chicken.  The ridiculous chicken they put on my plate.  It looked like a baby chicken.  It even had a wing.  I don't know about the chicken and waffles you eat, but usually I don't get a wing with it.  Have you ever seen someone eat a wing with a knife and fork?  Next thing you know, I'm eating a snickers with a knife and fork like Costanza.  Cutting anything in this restaurant will be a tall task.  The knife's handle is turned opposite of the blade.  I have never in my life seen a knife in a restaurant like this.  If you are into martial arts or have a hand that grew 90 degrees to the left of your wrist, then you will use this knife very naturally.\n\nIt's served with a bowl full of baby tomatoes, bell peppers, and a tomato paste.  Now, I'm no chef or chicken and waffles connoisseur, but I not sure how that fits in.  Maybe it does, I just haven't had enough drinks and substances pumped into my body.\n\nThe pastry she ordered came after our meal even though she ordered it at the beginning to eat with her latte.  It was supposed to be a delicious $4 raspberry danish.  It was a hockey puck with a red stain in the middle.  Absolutely no flavor.  My local donut shop has better danishes.  My wife took 2 small bites and I took one just to have something else to gripe about.  It granted me my wish.\n\nOne other thing: We were not the only one disappointed.  My wife and I got a kick out of watching the lady at the table next to us react to each plate that was served to her.  Her face was one of shock, horror, and finally mad.  In that exact order.  We felt the same.  If you guys want to experience these emotions yourself, book a reservation asap.\n\nI give the hostesses 4 stars.  The waitress 2 stars.  I give the food 2 stars, only because it was edible.  For the money, do not come to this place.  Completely not worth it.  If you want a meal that you actually get what you pay for, go somewhere else.  Especially the brunch, which is not any better than iHop, Cracker Barrel, or you mom's house."

But they were what we ordered! A dish of mixed mushrooms which were tasty but such a tiny portion! Then 5 mini mini stuffed peppers on a tiny little plate. My husband had gnocchi, a portion so tiny he said he would be eating lunch when we got home. I had a spinach salad with a flavorless grilled piece of chicken breast, a few slices of apple and a bit of blue cheese. It had a very tasty dressing. Size was ok for me but it was an appetizer size. No drinks no dessert and our bill was $80.00! Our waitress over filled our water glass, did not bring bread or lavash crackers - had to ask for them as well as salt and ground pepper. No Parmesan cheese offered for gnocchi Brought my husband an espresso which she spilled on to the saucer and I sent it back before it dropped all over his shirt. I live in Las Vegas and we avoid the strip for this reason. It's over priced. I will not go back. How difficult is it to serve normal portions  \nThe pizzas looked pretty good"

I luckily snagged a reservation 4 weeks in advance, but a quick search shows that the restaurant is sold out until August unless you want really inconvenient times.\n\nFront of the house was a little awkward. We got there a few minutes early, and they told us they were running on schedule but we'd have to wait until our reservation time. No biggie, I thought. I then watched 4-5 couples walk in after us and get seated before us. Again, no biggie. 15 minutes after our scheduled time the hostess asks if we'd like to sit in the lounge while we wait for our table. Now I'm getting annoyed. What happened to running on time? Luckily we didn't sit too long as they seated us after 10 minutes in the lounge.\n\nI watched as they offered a tour of the place to their guests before they sat down. Were we offered a tour? I'll let you take a wild guess. NOPE - I had to ask for one, and yes, we did receive a tour.\n\nThe space itself is gorgeous, with a great view of the strip. There is a classic, traditional look with big, beautiful windows overlooking the Strip. I loved the wood staircase going up to the restaurant. Servers are in white jackets, with plating done tableside. It is pretty elegant with kind of a homely feel.\n\nI guess if you're gonna run episodes of Everyday Italian and Giada at Home on an endless loop on flatscreens above the bar, it better be Giada's place. I mean, why the hell wouldn't she do that? As we ate I was able to watch an easy-to-make peas and prosciutto dish. So I got food and education!\n\nThe menu has phonetic pronunciations of all the pastas. In case you're an idiot, they're right there for you. Thanks, Giada.  Also, there are self-portraits of her all over the walls. Not the endearing South Park portraits, however.\n\nOur dishes were excellent.  Bread service was great, as the butter I thought I was spreading was actually mascarpone cheese.  The scallop and crab risotto was our favorite dish of the meal.  Bacon wrapped dates with spicy sausage and gorgonzola crema were also a big hit. The cocktail program is well thought out and executed.\n\nGiada stopped and chatted with us and took a pic after we finished our meal. Very nice lady, and nice to see her buzzing around the place. The tourists will come here in droves.\n\nSo food is good, decor and ambience even better, but something was just off with a few things. I still think it was surprisingly a good experience. As much as I thought I would dislike it, I enjoyed my meal there (despite a few hiccups). And the food is quite noteworthy.  Giada is definitely off to a good start."

            "review": "My husband and I decided  on Sunday to go Giadas. I am a fan of Giada's TV show.  We arrived about noontime.  We did not have a reservation and we were told by the not so friendly reception desk the wait would be 45 minutes (they seemed annoyed we did not have a reservation ) but 10 minutes later we were seated to a not so full restaurant. I guess because we did not have a reservation we were seated in the hallway part of the restaurant against a wall where there was food splatter all over the wall papered wall and the wood floors are severely scratched up. The very nice waitress came over to take our drink order. I wanted a bloody mary one of their \"specialty drinks\" and we were told they were all out of it (what?) okay another strike but we are very tolerant and still okay with it.\n\nFor appetizers we shared the orzo meatballs and margherita pizza.  The pizzas flavor was good but the dough was very chewy. I did not care for the meatballs or the sauce. Also for $15.00 you get  the tiniest meatballs I have ever seen. Our entree was lasagna and pasta carbonara. NO BREAD was served! The pasta carbonara was very good but the portion again is quite small ($24.00!). My husband had the lasagna and this came in a very small ramekin like dish and was just okay ($24.00!) The portions are very very small so eat before you get here. We had Gelato for dessert and this was excellent and is why I was generous with the 3 star review. $100.00 bill and still hungry! It sounded like we ordered a lot of food but even when i asked the waiter if it would be too much she said no and boy was she right. On the way out there were 3 employees standing at the reception and not one acknowledged us by saying thank you or have a nice day. Too many better choices on the strip. I hate giving bad reviews but we were disappointed."

But, the food is just OK.  The cuisine is italian style but it's just not anything to write home about.  We tried some nice cheeses, the bread platter that comes out is lovely baked with rosemary.  But, I'm not trying to pay $80 per head for good bread.  Some ordered the surf 'n' turf, others the risotto, and pizzas.  The specialty is a shrimp lemon spaghetti - it's presentation is photo worthy but the taste is just Meh.  For a restaurant that's $35 per plate on average, it's not worth it.  I suggest going for drinks and maybe some cheese and charcuterie style appetizers."

Contemporary, chic, yet comfortable. \n\nService: 3/5 Surprising for a new, high profile restaurant. ( my visit was in October 2014) we were seated about 30 minute after our reservation, which I found surprising. Perhaps it was to encourage us to use the photo booth in the lobby. The photo booth was a nice little touch. The delay in service was less nice. \n\nDrinks: 5/5 I don't remember the names of any but we tried about 4 different signature drinks. every one of them were beautifully executed and delicious. \n\nFood: \n-Antipasti platter of Giada's favorites: 4/5 overall good. Well executed, though nothing was mind blowing\n-Octopus: 5/5 Well executed. Perfectly grilled. Fennel salsa was a great accompaniment. \n-Spaghetti(lemon/shrimp/basil): 1/5 This was one of \"Giada's favorites\". the pasta was limp and sticky. sauce was just cream with minimal flavor. sorely disappointed.\n-Risotto: 2/5 yet another of \"Giada's favorites\". Creamy, yes, but in a heavy heavy sort of way. again, disappointed, though not as bad as the spaghetti. \n-Tiramisu: 2/5. not terrible, but when is tiramisu ever terrible? It fell a bit flat for me. it was fine. \n\nSo the dinner started out great. The drinks were delicious, the venue was gorgeous, the antipasti was yummy....Then the food was one disappointment after another. I highly doubt I will return for food. Sorry Giada, I wanted to love you but I couldn't...\n\nOh, one hilarious moment was when their super fancy ipad drink menu froze and they had to reboot, struggle, then it froze again."

We were so excited to go because we make her pasta sauce at home every time we have pasta. We loved her Vegas restaurant so much that we went for lunch and dinner in the same day.  \n\nWe then went the day after Thanksgiving this year. It was not difficult to make a reservation, as I made it far in advance.  When you check in, you wait a little bit longer for a table, but nothing too crazy.  She has a little photo booth set up for people to have fun with, and that is a nice touch.\n\nI had a Starbucks coffee with me that I had picked up before I came. I was told that I could not bring it in, which was a little ridiculous, because Vegas.  Chugging coffee was not exactly fun, and not a great start to my meal.\n\nWe decided to go with the brunch sampler platter. We were not informed that if you order two of those, then the first two courses come out family style.  We felt like we were being jipped, because it seemed that if one person ordered it, then more food would come out.  A lot of little things kept going wrong, and by the time this happened, my husband went to go speak with the manager. \n\nThe waitress was not very warm. I am a sarcastic person, but she was just a little too much for my taste. We felt like we were bothering her whenever we needed something.\n\nI had the pasta, and it was super bland.  Absolutely nothing special. In fact, the sauce we make at home (that is Giada's recipe) is much better. Very disappointing.  My husband had the chicken and waffles...and he wasn't impressed.  The chicken is roasted, and an interesting take on the classic dish, but if you are gonna deviate from the classic, at least make it to die for. Unfortunately, what was memorable was that it was meh.\n\nDessert was good, however. The lemon ricotta cookies were pretty out of this world.\n\nI am just really bummed about how this place has changed.  Yes, its beautiful, but the quality of the food and the service have really gone down hill since it opened.  We will probably never go back."

Vegas has such amazing restaurant all around with more realistic entree sizes, and not to mention the all you can eat buffets starting at 15 bucks! I have hopes Giada's restaurant can change though.. she just needs to balance out her menu to reach all kinds of her fans, because they have all loved and supported her. Also, the girls in the dresses at the front were so rude, which really takes away from the experience from the start.

The sad part about breakfast was the amazing chocolate orange mio heaven in a cup drink I had on Tuesday wasn't available because the espresso machine was down. My friend saw my face and I was honestly on a verge of tears. (I am not exaggerating). I settled for 3.5 cups of house coffee.

If your sense of taste is strong, you'll love it here, if you need totally over the top flavors, it may seem less full than you'd expect.\n\nThe ambiance was great. Nice views, good lighting level, good sound level, just great. \n\nThe best part though was the service. Tim was our waiter, and I'd highly recommend him to anyone.

My wife and I were in Vegas over New Year's, so we knew having dinner at Giada's would be tough.  We actually tried to make a reservation one night, but they were completely booked.  So, we decided to come early (around 11 a.m.) for lunch one day, and we only had about a five minute wait.  The decor of this restaurant is very nice, and it has a great view of the strip.  You can see all of the fresh ingredients being cooked right when you walk in the door.  I thought that was a cool design.\n\nAs for the food and service, I would rate everything as being \"good.\"  Not great, just good.  Our server was very informative about the menu, and answered any questions that we had.  There was one thing that really bugged me about this place.  Our server informed us that in order to get bread for lunch, you had to order some antipasti.  Seriously, I have to order something just to get some pizza dough bread??  So, since this was our first time here, we decided to order the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese plate ($13).  The cheese, bread, and pesto/olive oil sauce were good, but the cheese was hard to eat because it had to be mashed up.  Go with a softer cheese if you like those.\n\nAs for our main dishes, my wife ordered the Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese with heirloom tomatoes ($16).  It came with these zucchini strips which looked like really thin french fries.  My wife commented that they were good, but were difficult to eat.  She also mentioned that her sandwich was good.  I ordered the pasta of the day, which just happened to be lasagna ($24).  I was told that it was a \"traditional lasagna\", but I've never seen eggplant in a traditional lasagna.  It was served in a small but deep dish, and came with a small arugala salad.  My dish was pretty good, but I've certainly had better lasagna at many other places.\n\nI most certainly love Italian food, and I thought Giada's was good, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that I've had much better Italian food at other restaurants throughout my life.

If I were rating the service, atmosphere, drinks and dessert it would get 5+++ stars! The restaurant is warm, classy and inviting. There was a very nice view of The Strip from our table. Our waiter was just awesome!! He knew so much about the menu, gave recommendations, was very descriptive, so polite and seemed like an all around nice person. We started with cocktails. I ordered the Giada, it was beautiful and delicious! We decided to do the tasting menu. It was around $125pp. That is expensive but not unexpected since we were in Vegas. It was 4 courses plus you get some recipes and an autographed picture of Giada. The waiter brought out an assortment of breads and spreads to the table. That was excellent!! Next, the first real course were appetizers which were a few of Giada's favorite antipasti. All pretty good, stuffed peppers, bacon wrapped dates etc. Next course was the pasta course which was the worst. Pasta was gummy and flavorless. I was expecting so much more in terms of quality. For main course, we ordered the veal and salmon. Both dry and also flavorless. The dessert course was pretty epic! They push out a dessert cart and each guest can select 3 desserts each. Not only did we get to try 6 desserts which were all delicious, the waiter brought out sorbet for me for my birthday. Overall, a ton of food was served!! So if you have a big appetite this place is for you. I wish the main course and the pasta course were better...it would've made this a fantastic dining experience!!"

I understand wanting to accommodate as many tables over in that area, but at the expense of comfort?  The chairs aren't the best for hanging purses on either, and there isn't much room to hang them on the chairs without hitting the person behind you anyway.  I saw women put their purses on the floor.  For a germaphobe like me, and as someone who likes to keep my bags as clean as can be, that's just a no-no.\n\nAs for the food, I wasn't impressed either.  I split a lobster roll which was too heavy on the lemon side for my taste.  I've had better from food trucks :p  I also split their carbonara pizza which was ok by me since it had bacon and I love bacon!  For dessert we had their zeppoles, which was nothing special and too \"citrus-y\" for my taste.  \n\nWould I come back?  Maybe, but not for lunch, which was not bad, just ok in my opinion.  I would have come for dinner but good luck getting a dinner reservation!  \n\nFYI if you are driving to the restaurant, the Cromwell only has valet parking.  We self-parked next door at the Flamingo which was quite a trek, and their parking structure is quite old and narrow!"

Except for being placed in corner table which walled us on two sides everything else was exceptional.  Service by Casey was impressive from start.  She has the menu committed to memory with ability to cite all entres and options to enhance dining experience.  Giada offers a variety of Pasta dishes , but I had the pan seared salmon with lentil and succotash with an amazingly delicious sauce.  My wife had the surf and turf; a wonderful filet and seafood ravioli and baked brussel sprouts.  She raved about the flavor.  The portion size initially appeared modest but the big flavors left no appetite unfulfilled.  Layout is on second floor on corner accross from Caesars Palace and Bellaggios.  A little traffic noise, but attention was on food rather than outside.  My salmon was seared to perfection and I found myself smothering each bite with the lentil and sauce as it complimented the salmon so marvelously.  Restaurant was full to capacity, but seating was prompt (reservations recommended) and service was exceptional considering the number of diners.  Meal was a little pricey by our standards, but a good value in view of the quality, exceptional service, and overall experience.  We'll be back.  Thank you server Casey and other members of the staff.  Mike Wifler, San Diego"

And the experience, from start to finish, did not disappoint. The restaurant d\u00e9cor is exactly what you'd imagine Giada's restaurant to look like. It's beautiful. The view is beautiful, the dining area is beautiful, the bar, ditto. \n\nThe one odd thing about the night were the number of hostesses huddled around the front of the restaurant. I know it gets busy so when one leaves to escort diners to their table, another takes over, but it was a little mob-like. Anyway, that is honestly the only off thing I felt the entire night. \n\nThe service was absolutely wonderful. Our server, Jeff, could not have been more perfect. The right balance of informative and helpful without being over bearing. He suggested a sampler to start. On our plate, we had the dates, bruschetta, and peppers. The bruschetta was yummy. The peppers were so fresh, it was as if they were freshly picked from a farmer's market that day. The dates were out of this world!\n \nMy BF ordered the lobster ravioli for dinner. The ravioli were generally stuffed with delicately spiced lobster. I think he ate the entire plate in less than three minutes. Seriously, it was that good. \n\nI ordered the lemon spaghetti with shrimp. This is honestly the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. The shrimp were huge and perfectly cooked. The pasta, so fresh. The lemon sauce is absolutely divine. And the sprinkle of fried capers on top, perfection. \n\n\nThe wine list was nice, not crazy big. They had lots of options for wine by the glass. The pours themselves, I thought, were on the large side and that's a GREAT thing.\n\nGiada was everything I expected it to be. I will definitely be back and would highly recommend! \n\nTip: if you want to try your hand at making the lemon spaghetti, foodandwine.com has Giada's recipe. Everything down to the fried capers. I made the dish two nights after dining at Giada's and, but for not having fresh pasta (still working on that), the recipe is spot on for what you get in the restaurant. It was really, really good. In fact, I'm making it again tonight :)"

Four of us sat down for a cocktail before dinner. We ordered two Vodka with juice on the rocks, a beer and a margarita. When we got the bill we were charged 14.00 per vodka drink with an additional 3.00 charge per Vodka for \"The Rocks\"? I asked what that charge was and he said it is always more for \"on the rocks\" in Vegas. I have been to Vegas hundreds of times and two of my friends with us live in Vegas. We said we NEVER heard of a 3.00 per drink charge for \"on the rocks\"! We asked if we had ordered the Vodka and not said on the rocks would he have given us ice? We also asked if we ordered w/out ice would it cost less. He could not answer except to say that is how it is in Vegas! I was so frustrated by his stupid explanation and bewildered look we just left and vowed NEVER to eat there. \n\nLater that night we told some other Vegas locals about it and they shared a horror story as well about there recent experience at Giada. They had 8:00 Pm reservations and arrived at 7:59. The hostess told them they were backed up and to go get a drink and come back in 30 minutes. The bar in the restaurant is tiny so they had to go downstairs to get a drink. The crowds were busy and by the time they got their drinks it was time to be seated, the hostess told them they can't bring the drinks in from outside. They told the hostess she told them to go get the drinks, she said sorry either leave the drinks or gulp them down but you can't bring them in. It was 80.00 worth of drinks! They guzzled them down and were seated and waited FOREVER to be served and all they had to say was the food was fair at best, the service poor and the prices way too high!\n\nBTW.. I have never given a 1 star review before, I am NOT the angry kind of customer and generally only leave good reviews of places I enjoy. This experience aggravated me so much I had to tell it like it is."

When I called, I was told that because I was making a reservation for more than 10 people that I had to speak with someone else, I was transferred to a different line and asked to leave a message with all details. I left a very detailed message on a Thursday, no one called me back so on Saturday I call again, I was told to call again on Monday. At this point I was beyond annoyed, but I decided to wait and call. I call back on Monday, I speak to a nice lady, I explain my situation, she told me she would transfer me to a manager, but that a) either his voicemail would be full or b) if I was able to leave a message he would more than likely not call me back. At this point I asked her to be honest with me and asked if I was better of just taking my business elsewhere, her answer? YES, you are better off going elsewhere because no one will call you back. \n\nNow, I know that this is a new restaurant, but what ever happened to good customer service?!? I will NEVER eat here, and I will highly discourage everyone I know from going here as well.  \n\nAs the nice lady suggested, I took my business elsewhere. I made a reservation for my 14 guests at Botero, they were quick at answering the phone, emailed me a proposal the same day, and the day of the dinner took great care of us.\n\nSorry Giada, your food may be great, but you need to take a close look at who is talking to your potential customers. Your restaurant will not be the hot spot forever, so when the newness wears, and the hype is over, how will you fill your tables?"

Meaning the ingredients used for the dishes taste very fresh.\n\nFinally made it to Giada after a year or so of me driving past the Cromwell, looking up and saying...I need to try that restaurant. The brunch menu was being served at the time of my visit so brunch it was.\n\nTwo plates were ordered for me and a friend as well as a side. First was the breakfast American which contained delicious pieces of bacon, over medium eggs (my friends choice), lemon smashed potatoes, and toast. The potatoes were delicious! The lemon flavor was great and not too sour. The toast was a bit dry but still good. This was resolved with the yolk from the eggs but some butter next time would be nice as well.\n\nThe potatoes from the lobster hash weren't as flavorful as the potatoes from the first dish but taste clean and fresh. When it comes to the flavor of this dish its all owed to the lobster and bacon. There was a lot more lobster than I expected on this dish and it was delicious, The Nueske's bacon in the dish taste a lot smokier and flavorful than the bacon from the last dish with tons of tomatoes, peppers and onions to compliment it. Let's not forget that egg on top with all that yolk that came pouring into the hash. The yolk also served the same purpose for the toast with this dish as it did for the last.\n\nTo finish off brunch, I had the chia seed parfait. This is one of the best parfaits I've tasted. Lots of chia seeds in maple Greek yogurt combined with raspberries and almonds. My regret...not ordering another. It was gone before I knew it. I should have eaten it a lot slower to savor the taste.\n\nBrunch at Giada was a refreshing intro to her restaurant for myself. Fresh flavors, a relaxing decor and a nice breeze that flowed throughout the restaurant from the outside. Looking forward to trying plates from the dinner menu on a second visit. \n\nBrunch 4/2/2016"

We arrived early and were told we could sit at the bar if we'd like and our table would be ready. We went to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks as well as 2 appetizers. Drinks arrived and about 10 minutes later the hostess notifies us our table is ready. We told her we had ordered appetizers and asked if we should close our tab at the bar. The bartender comes over and says she has yet to put the appetizer order into the system. Ok, no big deal.  \n\nHave to mention that \"Giada\" is everywhere. Not actually Giada herself but her name is on everything. I understand the importance of branding but it was a little much. I also thought it was a little tacky to play her cooking show at the TV above the bar. Giada the brand will get you into the restaurant, like us. I wanted to go there because of her but it won't get you to come back again. The food and service will do that but that didn't happen in our case. \n\nGet seated at our table. The view was by far the best experience of the evening. We were almost above the corner of the street at a window table with an amazing view of the bellagio fountains. Loved our table, perfect. We ordered our appetizers again and added one. The burrata, chicken meatballs and orzo meatballs. Burrata was good, can't really go wrong but the meatballs were nothing special.  We saw other tables had bread, we had to ask. Also had to ask for water and there was no mention of the tasting menu by our server. \n\nI ordered the lemon pasta with shrimp. Pasta was good, shrimp was dry and over cooked. My husband had the lamb. He orders lamb often when we go out and he was disappointed. We choose several desserts off the cart. Favorite was the chocolate cake. \n\nThey closed the windows to the restaurant where we were sitting while we were still eating which really changed to mood. We had to wave down a server to get our check and then another to pay it. Walked out and saw the photo booth but went inside only to see an out of order sign. \n\nOverall, the service was lacking quality and the food lacked flavor.  We didn't leave feeling like we had a special meal or good experience. It was just ok."

Our server was great (not constantly hovering but always there when you needed him) and the nearly floor to ceiling windows were perfect for someone like me who slept till lunch and needed all the natural light I could get. Before ordering, our server went over the menu and described our options as being \"designed\" for the time of day, which \"duh\" it's lunch, not dinner, different options, everyone does that right? Nope, after I finished eating, I got it. Like the natural light, everything I tasted helped me to come alive. The recipes were subtle, cool and refreshing, almost rejuvenating, and while I never felt any one thing was amazing, it just all worked. \n\nFor appetizers we tried the caponata $8, baby sweet peppers $12 and orzo meatballs $15. Interestingly enough, the cheaper the better here. The caponata was excellent and came with enough to cover about 10 crostini (it came with 6, we asked for the extra.) The baby sweet peppers stuffed with goat cheese and olive tapenade came with three and fit the theme of this review perfectly--not amazing but somehow still perfect. The orzo meatballs were probably my least favorite of everything I tried, as paying 3 to 4 dollars (per meatball) for a relatively small and un-compelling dish is not something I would advise and this is coming from a guy who falls for the aidells samples at Costco on the regular. \n\nFor lunch, I had the Waldorf Panzanella salad, which included a unique crouton-like raisin walnut bread I really enjoyed. I also split three other options: the Lobster Roll, Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese w/ prosciutto and Tuna sandwich. Getting back to the idea of refreshing, the lobster roll (served cold) included a lemon basil aioli, which along with the lemon pesto grilled cheese contributed to the overall feeling of zest I felt at the completion of our meal. Of the three, the grilled cheese was my favorite, followed by the lobster roll and then the tuna. \n\nTry it or Diet Final Word\n\nIf soup taste 10x's better to you on a rainy day and/or there's nothing better to you than a ice cold beer after mowing your lawn, this is the place for you at lunch. It's good food served in the right atmosphere at the right time. Try it."

She had a rude attitude and was just plain \"stuck up.\" Here I am, coming to spend big money in a nice restaurant. I feel we should be treated like gold like most good restaurants I've been to; but no, not here. I think Giada would be very disappointed with the treatment we got since she seems sooo nice. When we were finally seated, the water took quite awhile to come. The server was average. This place just seems really overrated. Everything is al-a-carte so you end up spending a lot of money on apps, salads, entrees, ands sides. We ordered the \"whole chicken for 2\" for 58$. When it came out it looked like KFC chicken with four pieces of breasts and a tomato like marinade/sauce in the middle (which was mediocre). By the time the bill came, it was $128. This was without us drinking alcohol and without any dessert! What a joke of a place--very overrated. My wife was so excited to go there. This whole experience was a HUGE let down. Also my wife is a huge fan of Giada so we left a gift for her at the front and again the hostess who took it didn't even say thank you or anything. Again, very rude. They had about 10 hostesses there--is that really how many people you need to greet and seat people? Seems a little excessive if you asked me!

My cousin ordered a Shirley temple and it came with flat club soda and 3 cherries. The server mentioned that they had run out of grenadine - but then my cousin decided she wanted a sprite instead. The server come back with flat soda water. Also, came back (non-apologetic for The most part)  we ordered bread while we waited for our meals and we literally got 1 piece of bread for The entire table!! Not making this up... Our waiter Nancie was pretty good at the end but throughout was not very friendly AT ALL - she was almost rude and sarcastic which was very shitty.  I have been to 3 star restaurants and have received better treatment. In all actuality the prices and portions are the most disappointing."

            "review": "So having visited Giadas at the Cromwell last night I have to say very disappointed, the venue itself is very well situated, beautiful decor and like walking into someone's dining room at their house, it all looks pretty and appealing and that's where in my opinion it all stops. It took over 10 mins for a waiter to touch the table , it took about the same time to get the wine order delivered to us too. The bread was forgotten and had to be asked for. The appetizers arrived and all were tepid , the grilled octopus which I was looking forward to was last to show up and was tasteless and over cooked having being told for its lateness that they were putting a good char on it! Next up was the pasta , they make their own pasta in house in front of you in their open kitchen. Waiter said had to have the lobster and asparagus ravioli, bland and lobster chewy with not even a hint of a sauce to help it. Crab and scallop risotto , the scallop was perfectly cooked and then that was it , an other bland tasteless dish and the crab must have run away as I couldn't detect any in the dish. \nEntrees branzino was good , lamb came under cooked and had to refire to get the right temp but was bland and my filet was bland .\nWine service was poor too, we had white wines and placed in ice buckets with no ice so our wine started to get warm . \nDesert is run a round on a cart and when the waiter puts it on a plate it's has no presentation , the cart I would get rid off and work on presentation . \nMaybe one of the reasons it's hard to get into is the service is so slow so there's no tables turning !\nIt's prices are up there with the rest of the strip and portions small . We all have off nights but they better fix what's wrong or it'll be bye bye Giada!!"

We ordered the family style tasting menu so we were able to try a little bit of everything. The antipasto platters were huge, delicious, and had lots of options. The meatball appetizer was by far the best meatball I've ever had. Our favorite dish by far was the lemon spaghetti with shrimp. I'm still craving it! The service was impeccable as well - our wine and water glasses were never empty. The only thing that would have made my night better was if Giada herself had been there. Would highly recommend!"

            "review": "Dining at Giada was great. However, I will start this review off by saying I WISH I HAD COME FOR DINNER. The lunch menu is significantly limited compared to their dinner offerings. For example, there are only 3 pasta options for lunch. Imagine my disappointment when I learned the lemon shrimp spaghetti that everyone raved about on yelp is NOT offered on the lunch menu, only dinner! \n\nBut, I digress. AMBIANCE: Located on the 2nd floor of the Cromwell, the restaurant is beautiful. Let's be honest, Giada is beautiful. She is probably my only and real \"woman crush.\" The restaurant ambiance and decor emulate her. It's very inviting, spacious, elegant, yet also homey. Not to mention a great view of the Bellagio. We requested a view of the fountains like everyone said and they were able to oblige. \n\nFOOD/DRINKS: The Sangria ($15) was pretty and tasted as good as it looked. Lunch menu had a bunch of appetizers, pizzas, salads, and sandwiches. Again, super limited pasta menu, and no additional entrees... or at least I can't remember any. Things I tried:\nORZO MEATBALLS ($10)- okay, lots of flavor and the sauce they came in was good. A good appetizer to start. \nWOOD MUSHROOMS ($14)- tasty and tender. But super small. \nPESTO LEMON GRILLED CHEESE WITH PROSCIUTTO AND TOMATO ($22)- the prosciutto is an extra $4, you can get it without for $18. I couldn't really taste it because it was so thin, it really only made it a little more salty. The lemon flavor wasn't too prevalent either. The main flavor here is the pesto. It was good but $18 for a grilled cheese sandwich? Ponder that for a min. All sandwiches come with your choice of salad or fried zucchini strips. Get the zucchini strips, they're still vegetables! Thus, you can feel less guilty about them. \nSAUSAGE PIZZA- pretty good but also quite oily. Probably wouldn't get next time. \nCAPRESE SALAD ($19)- the heirloom tomatoes were excellent and the mozzarella was delicious. \nEGGPLANT AND SAUSAGE LASAGNA ($24)- This was really good. The size is just right. \n\nSERVICE: friendly, competent, attentive when needed, but nothing really remarkable in this area. \n\nOverall, Giada is my homegirl, but I'll have to come back for dinner. The limitations of the lunch menu was surprising. Also, it's obviously a pricey place... but if you can splurge, I'd definitely recommend you try her. I did it just because I like her so much. It's absolutely more of a special occasions only type of place."

I received the same treatment as when I first got there that I was asking for too much.  I really wish they would train their hostess better, I know it's Vegas but can you try to act like I'm welcomed."

Our first impression with the restaurant - the host stand. We arrived on time for our 1:15 lunch reservation and were told that our table wasn't ready yet, but would be in no more than 30 minutes. Umm? I know it's a new restaurant and they'll surely have kinks to work out, but the concept of reservations, seating guests, and turning over tables isn't new. \n\nFinally get seated after 20 minutes, and we're stuck in a corner at one of those higher bar-type tables. Unfortunately someone in our party doesn't do well in those chairs and we asked to be reseated and were told we'd have to wait again. Ugh. \n\nLuckily they have a fun photo booth to play with, but the wait for the second table was only 5 minutes. Once we were finally seated, everything was top notch. Our table had a view of the fountains, our waiter was great, and the food was phenomenal. We shared the chicken meatballs, lasagna, Waldorf panzanella salad, and a margherita pizza. In fact, the pizza was so good we ordered a second one before gobbling up some zeppole and a tomato and strawberry crostada for dessert. \n\nI'd love to go back and try dinner...hopefully by that time they'll have figured out how to seat people."

I visited the restaurant with 3 other people, we all ordered the $120 per person 5 course dinner. The appetizers were very unique and so great. The pastas do come in small portions but they aren't the only meal you get for $120. Steaks/salmon/shrimp also come in small portions but when you add all 5 courses I promise you that you will leave very full. Appreciate the taste and quality of the food because that's truly what you are paying for at Giada's. Desserts are a delicious ending to your fulfilling dinner.

Our party of five was seated at a semi-circular table overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountains - a truly spectacular view at night.\n\nThe menu - many appetizer choices, but honestly nothing on the menu was a standout. Meatballs were tasty but small portions. Burrata was salty, offered as a tiny sample. Gorgonzola and honey - maybe three bites worth. Fritto calamari - overly browned and about 5-6 pieces. The risotto with charred scallops were delightful, but as a main course I could have eaten 2 or 3 more servings. My other dinner guests seemed to enjoy their veal, lamb, fish and pasta dishes, but I didn't hear anyone raving about their meals.\n\nOverall - a very mediocre meal that was overpriced and skimpy. I went home un-fulfilled and hungry for breakfast the next day. Nice date place to impress, but not to satisfy your hunger. Also, was disappointed Giada was not here and we couldn't see her.

We had to ask for a menu and that was how the service went the entire evening. My sauce on my lemon spaghetti was pasty and seemed like it had been sitting too long before serving and the shrimp were tough. A pizza was not delivered with our meal as asked so it was sent back since it was cold by the time the other food arrived. The desserts were excellent. Coffee served prior to dessert so it was cold when desserts arrived.\n\nThe management was accommodating once they knew of our issues but it was an overall disappointment experience.

I've read through some reviews that the staff can be pretty cold, but we didn't get that at all. We felt so welcomed, which is much appreciated for a girls night out. \n\nThe bread is delicious. I had the bacon wrap dates, mozzarella salad, salmon, and asparagus. All of it tasted great. The sauce the salmon came with was so good I was using the bread to clean my plate. \n\nSome complain about the small portions. I run a lot and went for a 2 hour hike/run the same morning we went to dinner. I eat a lot. After having some of the complimentary bread, sharing the bacon wrap dates with the girls (I only had one), the salad and salmon were more than enough. In fact, I should have split the salad with someone. I didn't even ask for dessert! I always ask for dessert! I think the people who complain about the portion sizes at Giada's must eat regularly at Cheesecake Factory or something. Or maybe they're just ordering two small plates from the left side of the menu? I don't know.\n\nThe only reason that I can't give it 5 stars are the prices. I know! Vegas! I usually roll my eyes when I see people complain about the prices at a nice restaurant in Las Vegas. It's a given. However, I live here and eat out on the strip a ton. I don't mind dropping some change on good food, but I thought comparatively, Giada's food and wines by the glass was priced a few more dollars than it should have been. The wines were on a much higher markup than some other nicer places I've been."

To say I had high expectations is putting it mildly, so honestly I didn't think there was any way it could live up to them.  I'm happy to report they managed to EXCEED them. (and that was sans Giada herself)\n\nWe  arrived about five minutes early for our 5:30 reservations and were greeted warmly by the gals at the top of the stairs, given the brief tour and led to a two-top overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  sigh, it pays to plan ahead, folks.  :)\nThe table was just the right size.  Small enough that we could easily converse and share food, but just large enough to handle all the food we ordered!\n\nService was at a comfortable, relaxed pace. The whole time we felt like guests who were welcome to stay all night if we wanted.  They aren't about turning tables, which might be why they stay booked up.  \n\n I had to try her Signature Cocktail!  I still don't know what was in it, other than egg whites and a cool G.  Very delicious, with enough body to it that the G stayed in place for a long time.  Meanwhile Husband had the most incredible iced tea ever.  Made right in front of us, he was given his own little pitcher with some agave syrup.  I ended up ordering one later after coveting his.  ($6 each and worth it).\n\nAs we perused the menu, I was trying to get Husband to give me an idea of what he wanted, but honestly I was very okay with him letting me decide, as having read reviews and the menu online (happy to report also that they have the updated menu with updated prices on the website now, by the way), I pretty much knew what I wanted to try!\n\nWe started with the Orzo Meatballs and the Lobster Arancini, along with their fabulous bread service.  Loved the spices to kick up anything we wanted to! Now I can make some good balls, but I gotta say, these were excellent...both the meat ones and the rice ones! \n\n Next we shared the Romaine Salad, which they brought to us split.  It was light and refreshing. Then we did the Spaghetti with Shrimp, Lemon, Basil and Capers.  Pasta & Shrimp perfection...yum!  And so was the Crab Risotto with the BEST Scallop I have ever tasted in my life.  Period.  Don't know why, as it appeared to be simply seared, but it was so rich and light at the same time.  \n\n  Full, we still couldn't resist a sample off the dessert cart (after all, they were so small).  Husband wanted to try a nipple truffle...they gave him three.  I wanted to try the blueberry eclair...oh it comes with a cream puff too.  Plus, somehow two lemon ricotta cookies and a chocolate chip one landed on our table as well (thanks!).  I don't know if it was an oversight, or we had already spent enough or what, but we were not charged for any of the desserts. Again, made to feel like welcome guests.\n\n  Meanwhile, we got to watch the Bellagio fountains, both in the daylight and after the sun went down, very cool!\n\nI might also add that while this experience was more than we normally pay for a meal for two...for a total experience for two, it was just under $200 and well worth it!\n\n The view outside plus the full experience inside, it was a truly magical evening that I will never forget!  (which is why I chose this to be my 600th review).  Thank you Giada for taking your years of culinary and world experience and creating this place! And extra thanks to your hard-working so-polished staff....true culinary gems, in the kitchen and in the front!\n\nThat being said, where was the infamous photo booth everyone talks about?   We never saw it!"

I am not sure why we had to go through all that but things went smooth from that point. We both tried the tasting menu at the suggestion of our waiter. It was awesome ! We loved everything !

Amazing. \nWe basically ordered every tapas of cheese and veggies we could. The sage honey served with the parmigiana was just the right amount of sweetness. The mozzarella had a bit of chili flakes with gave it a great little kick. The chicken Marsala meat balls... OMG so good!\nAll the veggies we ordered were also very memorable.  We just order so much Food!\nWe also ordered a pizza with apple balsamic drizzle. OMG I could eat this all day. Sweetness from the drizzle, a bit peppery from arugula and a nice eathyness from the creamy cheese. Pink peppercorns to finish. \nAt this point we've had two rounds or drinks and full table of tapas. I have no idea how we will get to the entrees!\nAfter a bit of a debate we decide to go straight to dessert.... EPIC. \nChocolate tiramisu ... I want to eat this everyday. Just beautiful. \nThe donuts are light fluffy as the right amount of crispy on the outside. The chocolate it comes with is not overpowering. Finished with some lemon zest which really gave it a clean feeling. \nWe also have the Nutella espresso drink. Amazing.\nThe food was EPIC. We have already decided to come back to try entrees and have our mind set to taste on a COUPLE of things! Can't wait! \nBravo Giada! Really well done!"

We sat in the lounge area which was conducive to conversation (until the crowd showed up). For a good seat by the window though, reservations are a must, but if you do sit in the lounge, I hope your lucky enough to have Brianna taking care of you. 5 plus stars all around."

Make sure to take a pic while you wait for your table. The place is gorgeous: upscale and modern with a beautiful view of the strip. We ordered the chicken marsala meatballs ($14), savory waffle ($18), and gnocchi ($17). Everything was pretty good but the best dish had to be the meatballs. They were salty, flavorful and the sauce was marsala wine sauce was heavenly!!! On top of that, our server was excellent and knew so much about the dishes and how they are made. Overall, a good place to have a fancy brunch but I'd skip the savory waffle, it's not worth the $18. The meatballs are a must try though!"

They finished by bringing her out a special plate with 'happy birthday' on it and let us pick several desserts from the dessert cart. It was memorable."

            "review": "My hubby is a chef, trained at Le Cordon Bleu - his muse and reason for attending culinary school is Giada di Laurentiis.  So we naturally booked ourselves a reservation for New Year's Day dinner at the Cromwell.  Our 5-star experience began upon walking into the Cromwell's first floor casino.  We were looking for directional signs to lead us to the restaurant entrance and a floor manager noticed us, asked if we were looking for Giada and then smiled and proceeded to not only walk us to the escalator but joined us on the ride up and introduced us to the hostesses.  We checked in and then went to get martinis at the bar while we waited for our table to be ready.  I asked for seating by the window and they were able to provide that with no problem.  Our martinis (made very well, BTW) in hand, we were directed to our table.  Both our waiter and his assistant approached within minutes and we were on our way.  To get the best experience and to try as many of Giada's creations as possible, we both opted for the Tasting Menu (for those of you who wonder about the cost - it's $120 pp - a great value considering the amount of items you are provided compared to their a la carte cost).  First course is antipasti - there's one of each item served on that platter so that each person can sample; second course was pasta and on that night, they were out of the Rigatoni dish so our waiter said to choose any item from the regular pasta menu if we liked...I liked and i decided on the Lobster Ravioli while the hubs picked the Bucatini - both were excellent.  Third course was our entrees - mine was the 7 oz Tenderloin with Basil-infused mashed potatoes and the hubs chose the pan-roasted Salmon - we also were provided a tasting-size bowl of Lemon Potatoes and the Creamy Polenta.  Everything was amazing.  Finally, the dessert waiter brought the cart to our table - each guest can choose 3 desserts.  We each chose 3 different items so we could sample 6 desserts rather than 3 - exquisite!  As we prepared to leave, our waiter came by to wish us a good evening and provided us with fresh, new versions of the tasting menu folder - inside were 3 recipes from the menu, a copy of the tasting menu itself and an autographed photo of Giada.  The chef/hubby was sooooooo happy and can't wait to go back on another visit to Vegas (oh and PS - the floor manager who walked us up happened to be in the restaurant lobby when we left and she was very interested in making sure we had an exceptional dinner and that we were pleased with everything).\n\nIs this restaurant pricy? Yes\nIs it worth it? In our opinion...Yes - the food was excellent, the service was top-notch and the setting is beautiful.  And while I did have a beef entree, it was also nice to find a celeb chef restaurant in Vegas that wasn't so freaking focused on having a steakhouse (seriously...I've never seen so many steak places on one street) - the flavors here are delicate and mediterranean, so if you're looking for another type of Italian food, perhaps you should check out Maggiano's in the Fashion Show."

After several attempts to make a reservation I was able to eat there and I was very disappointed. \n\nThe restaurant is beautifully decorated with a California beachy vibe and felt very welcoming. \n\nThe service was alright and the bread they offer was above average with a tasty pesto sauce which we liked, and then, things started to go downhill...\n\nWe ordered the eggplant parmesan which I was very surprised to see was improperly cooked and the eggplant was raw and gummy and the sauce was nothing special. Very simple flavors. \n\nWe then had the octopus salad. The octopus itself was cooked nicely but the sweet potato puree and olives did not add anything to the dish and the salad lacked flavor. Very uninspired. \n\nNext we had the beef tenderloin on potato chips with curry sauce. It was a cold piece of beef which was overcooked, I could not taste any curry flavor either. We couldn't even finish the dish. \n\nWe were so disappointed up until this point and I suggested with give her another chance and decided to try her pasta and aranchini. We ordered the spaghetti with shrimp and the lemon crab aranchini. The shrimp was over-cooked and the paste although made well did not have any flavor. I couldn't taste the basil or lemon. Just bland bland pasta and overcooked shrimp that did not smell good. The crab anarchic was alright, the lemon sauce was nice, however, by the time we got to it I had totally lost my appetite and felt so underwhelmed and disappointed with the whole experience that we only a few bites and left the dish unfinished. \n\nI was so looking forward to this experience and had made our reservation 3 months in advance. I wish I could write a great review but unfortunately it did not get close to what I was expecting."

My daughters follow Giada on Instagram and watch her on the Food Network channel.  They  were so excited when we told them we were taking them to Las Vegas and stopping at Giada's.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant around 4:25 pm and were advised by the curt, unfriendly hostess that Giada's was available only by reservations, but she could probably seat us at 5PM when it officially opened.  We were not hungry for dinner at that moment, only wanted coffee and desserts.  The hostess informed us that we could only sit at the \"lounge\" and not the dining area since we were not eating dinner. No restaurant has ever told us such a thing before, but we were willing to play by their rules. \n\nAt 5PM, we did as instructed by that hostess and went and found the \"lounge\", which, by the way, is in the corner by the restrooms.\n\nWe waited patiently for a staff member to wait on us, or even approach us, and nobody ever did. In fact, none made eye contact with us or greeted us.\n\nAt 5:10 I went back to the hostess stand, to that very unfriendly hostess, and inquired about how to go about getting waited on.  She hardly made eye contact with me and only said someone would come wait on me.\n\nNobody ever came.\n\nA few minutes later I returned to the hostess stand and asked to speak to a manager.  The hostess informed me, barely making eye contact, that she would get a manager, but I never saw her make an attempt to contact anyone.\n\nA few minutes later, as we still sat waiting in the corner \"lounge\", she came to us and told me that the managers were in a meeting and not available.\n\nI informed her that it wasn't acceptable and wanted to speak to a manager at once.  She walked away, never saying a word.\n\nFive minutes later, a manager approached us and listened to my story as written here.  He informed us that the \"cocktail waitress\" that was due to wait on us did not start her shift until 5:15.  He did not appear to be too concerned about the poor customer service his hostess provided, only offered us to stay and he would \"check\" to see if there was a dining table available.\n\nAt this point, my daughters were crushed as the Giada they follow and watch on tv did not match the personalities of the staff and air about this restaurant.\n\nNeedless to say, we left the restaurant, but completely disappointed at the very POOR customer service this beautiful restaurant offered. I found it interesting that only three tables were occupied as we left, yet for some reason there was no room for us. \n\nWe have gone to many restaurants in our travels and never before did we feel like we were not welcomed as we did today at Giada's.  \n\nAs a mother to my girls I was disappointed for them and had to explain to them what it meant to be treated like we did at this restaurant as they had never experienced this treatment.  \n\nAs a paying customer, I was angry at the lack of customer service for such a high profile restaurant.\n\nGiada should definitely be made aware of the poor staff that runs this restaurant. \n\nDon't waste your time and money!"

Our entire meal was luke warm at best (not piping made to order hot as it should be), Calamari was charred and dry (big ick!), meatballs super tiny (should not be allowed to call them meatballs), Bugatoni lacked flavor and character and my husband's white lasagna over cooked. Our waiter was a nice kid, but not guest service oriented.  We clearly were not impressed.  Anyway, walked away smokey smelling and hungry.

Place actually deserves a 2.5 but there were a few things that up'd their score from what I would of given them to a three. \n\nThe branding, d\u00e9cor, large open room, is spectacular. Very modern. Everything you can imagine has her famous \"G\" signature on them. She uses the sleekest and most modern flatware and other supplies. That is so Giada and it's gorgeous. Also, good expressos.\n\nNow on to the bad - Note, this review is solely based on lunch experience.\n\n1. Like most, you're not getting your money's worth for the small portions of food. Whether you order appetizers or a meal, there was nothing that exceptional about it. I don't mind the high prices, but make it worth it. Being from Orange County, travelled to some of the finest restaurants in New York, DC, and SF, you will find much better food for the relatively same high prices elsewhere. Generally, lunch menu food was just mediocre. \n\n2. Our girlfriends ordered a side of prosciutto for $18, mozzarella balls for $11 and a side of gorgonzola cheese for $13. Prices apps, yes. But the issue here is what the heck do you eat these with?  Do they expect us to scoop a chunk of cheese and eat it like ice cream? We asked for bread or crackers - something that makes sense to serve with cheese and delis and our waitress response was we don't have bread but you can order a sandwich. Now mind you, she said sandwiches so you must have something to eat it with. After waiting to speak with the manager while our food sits there for 15 min, they were able to accommodate us by giving us parmesan crisp. That was a freaken lot of work to get parmesan crisps! \n\n3. I ordered the pizza. Came out lukewarm and bread was doughy and uncooked. My other gf ordered a chicken carbonara dish and came out cold and chicken was tough. Manager was more than glad to send it back and bring out another dish which were compensated. This certainly was a nice gesture. My pizza was flavorful b/c of the spicy meats that were on there but it still seem to be lacking something in the sauce. The carbonara was much better simply by looking at it seeing that now it was glistening moist.\n\n4. There deli sandwich come with an aioli already made and you cannot get aioli on the side which I never heard of such a thing. Whatever, this is minor.\n\n5. And right, like another review, for the amount of money spent here, the birthday dessert is 6 cookies. While some were fresh out of the oven, I never seen such a cheap and tacky dessert for a high-end place. \n\n6. The place smelled like a cigar room instead of a nice Italian aroma you should smell when you walk in. This was gross.\n\n7. As with one of the raters, the seating arrangements seem quite cramped. I felt that if I laid back on my chair, someone would walk right into me. \n\n8. The restaurant seems crazy. There was just so many workers, some of which were just standing around while a handful of others were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I felt that they wanted you in and out with no personal dining experience focus. Sometimes you go to restaurants and you can connect with who is helping you. Not here.\n\n9. It was hard to tell what theme Giada is striving for. People came in with their laptops so is it a caf\u00e9 style place. But you serve lunch and half of the menu was just tapas like selections. \n\nOverall, this place may be good for others but definitely not for me, even for a Giada fan. Real tempted to rate it a 2 but manager saved the day for us."

Our dinner order was placed, but the kitchen somehow lost the order & we had to wait 30-40 minutes later to get our food. Thank goodness, we made dinner reservations early otherwise we would've been late for the Beatles Love show at the Mirage. Other patrons who came in after us all got their dinner before we did. \n\nAlso, we were celebrating my wife's birthday that night & we made reservations 1 month in advance & requested a window seat to over look the Bellagio water show. Only 1 day before our dinner date, the personnel at the restaurant called to confirm our reservations & said \"by the way\" in order to get a window seat, each of us would have to order at least $100.00 of food each!!! Such a ridiculous & crazy rule and to only tell us 1 day before our dinner event. If I knew ahead of time, I would have never made reservations or come to this restaurant! I would've had time to make other arrangements & book a different restaurant for my wife's birthday! But since we were already in Vegas & it's too late to book a nice restaurant for this special occasion, we had to come here.\n\nThe only good experience here was our waitress (Lauren). She gave impeccable service & explained every detail of the menu & made us feel very welcome. Also at the end, she gave my wife a complimentary birthday dessert consisting of 3 cookies. She gave excellent service!\n\nAlso, I like to point out that while you wait for your table in the front lobby, there's a photo booth machine that you can take pictures. But down side is there photo printer is broken! \n\nOverall, disappointing experience at Giada's! Horrible rule of $100.00 to spend per person to sit at a window seat & NOT telling your patrons until the day before their dinner reservations. Losing the order ticket & making us wait 40 minutes for our dinner. Giada, you need to take notice of such poor practices at your restaurant & make changes. There are plenty of other fine dining establishments in Vegas that people can go spend their hard earned money on instead of here!!!"

I absolutely love her and could not wait to try her food! Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. The food was unbelievably incredible. The menu is set up go eat courses, so most dishes are small bites/smaller plates. You would get at least e or 3 fishes per person. They brought a round of complimentary Rosemary Foccacia and cheese crisps to the table. This came with 4 things you could add to the bread - salt, lemon marscapone butter, fried capers and Pesto Aioli. The aioli was the so good. Everyone devoured it and had to ask for more! For an app we ordered the burrata and the lemon and crab arincini. They were both amazing. I didn't really taste crab in the arincini and the lemon was very light. However I would get these again! The burrata was soft and creamy and delicious. I wish it had been served with some bread but it was great on its own. For the \"main\" course I got the spaghetti and my boyfriend got the short rib agnilotti. I am not the biggest shrimp person because it is usually overcooked and flavorless. However, this dish was absolutely amazing. It looked stunning on the plate and tasted better than I could have ever imagined. The agnilotti was OK. The pasta was excellent and the sauce was fantastic but the filling was a little dry but had good flavor. We really wanted to try the Lemon Souffle but we were too stuffed! The only negative I have to say is that our waiter was rather rude. Any time we asked for anything it felt like we were bothering him and he seemed very annoyed with us. He didn't ever come back and ask us how our food was and we had to track him down to order more drinks. A little damper on the experience but the food was amazing and I would go back in a heart beat."

She took great care with the expensive bottles of wine we brought for the evening and made sure everyone had drinks at all times. \n\nThe food itself was phenomenal! We started with the antipasti and omg the cheese and meat were so good! The complimentary bread basket was also so great. The warm focaccia and all the dipping sauce were my favorite. There were so many delicious options to choose from on her menu. It's a very well throughout menu.\n\nOur table also split two of the pasta, the rigatoni and bucatini were excellent. I could eat that rigatoni all day! Both were top notch!\n\nMy husband and I split the Tuscan ribeye and the spinach and potatoes for sides. That ribeye looks and tastes perfect. It was fatty, flavorful and just as i had hoped.\n\nFor dessert I had the chocolate cake and tried the lemon souffl\u00e9, and my husband received a complimentary lemon sorbetto for his birthday. All were good.\n\nOf course the highlight of the dinner was Giada coming to our table and chatting with us a bit. She was just as genuine and nice as you would hope.

They told us it would be about a 5-10 minute wait... I would have understood this if they were just waiting for their full wait staff to show up for the morning shift, however they kept seating other tables before us that had actually arrived after us. After about 20 minutes of waiting around, I finally went back to the hostess stand to ask what the scoop was, and she rushed around a little bit to finally get us seated.\n\nThe restaurant decor was absolutely beautiful though, with so many \"Giada\" details throughout the space. Giada signature tableware and even Giada signature cappuccino cups and saucers. These little touches were great.\n\nThe service was extremely slow. Our server would disappear forever before we could track her down to order more items. Wasn't my favorite. \n\nWe started with the Breakfast Pastry Assortment... $15 and not really worth it. There were maybe 2 items out of the 5 or so that I actually liked. Our entrees were good though; I went with the Italian Hash:  potatoes, bacon,  salami, peppers, tomato, onion with sunny side up eggs & toast. Felt like a cleaner version of \"hash\" compared to what I am used to in Texas. This plate was $19...  kind of expensive for a breakfast item... but then again, this is Vegas. My boyfriend had the American Breakfast, which was fine... nothing special. So for some lackluster pastries, two entrees, two coffees, and 1 over-priced mimosa, the final bill for breakfast came out to $100 after tip. \n\nNot sure I would suggest this spot to anyone. Happy I tried it, but doubt I will ever be back. Sorry Giada :("

We were pleasantly surprised that there was a kids' menu even though our kids were more adventurous and shared with the adults.  We had the carbonara flatbread, which had a perfectly cooked sunny side egg on top. We also shared the sausage and eggplant lasagna, which was well seasoned but the portion may have been a tad small for the price. It did come with an arugula salad in the side, though. We also had a salumi flatbread -- dried salami that resembled pepperoni -- and the orzo meatballs.  We also started with a gooey chocolate croissant monkey bread, the size of a muffin.  \n\nThe service was really good, once the server came to our table.  They did a great job refilling out complimentary coffee and our waters.  We asked about the famous bread basket but learned it was only available at dinner.  We were offered Parmesan cracker bread on the house, and it was divine. \n\nWe had a reservation to request a table with a view, which I recommend highly.  We also enjoyed the fun photo booth in the way out."

The presentation is gorgeous but the taste leaves one with much to desire.  \nWe began dinner with the orzo meatballs.  Tasty, but $25 for 5 small balls that lacked enough sauce and when you cut into the meatballs, the orzo looked like maggots on your plate as you ate them. \n$28 per glass of house Pinot noir, which was delicious.  We then had the yellow tomato soup which was very rich but yummy. \nI chose the spaghetti shrimp pasta- looked great... Lacks flavor.  2 jumbo shrimp glaring at you as if they may give you great satisfaction but as you begin to taste and chew, you realize, you need sauce, garlic, pepper, Parmesan cheese - anything/ something to bring taste to this dish.  As a signature, I'll say it was well below par for many shrimp pastas I've had in the past or made at home. \nWaiter suggested the cookies for dessert- we could have had just as good at Mrs Fields.  I would think that an Italian chef would have better desserts than the \"signature cookies\". \nOver all, we spent $240 and it was just meh.  \nThe price for me has never been an issue if the food is drop your jaw amazing. \nWould I return?   Not unless someone else is picking up the bill....\nEven with the beautiful decor and ambiance, there are much better restaurants in Vegas to spend that kind of money at.  The taste is definitely not worth the price. \nSorry Giada- you need to taste your food from time to time.  It's not that good.  I guess that's why you don't feel tempted to eat too much of it and are able to keep your figure! :-)"

The four of us were looking forward to Giadas new restaurant because like most of the reviewers, Giada is so inviting on her food network show.  Starting with the miniature bread - no flavor, lack of salt but he 4 side spoons of kosher salt, red pepper flakes, and pesto sauce was a nice touch. The Caesar salad was swimming in sweet lemon capers - I ordered dressing in the side but the lettuce was over powered by capers. Orzo meatballs were flavorless and had more orzo than meat. No salt or garlic flavor. Marqarita pizza had limited, mostly dough and no flavor-thankfully I used red pepper flakes  to rescue. The chicken cacciatore for two( served on one plate and had to ask for a second plate) was fried chicken ( oops - bakes and flash fried ) had no flavor and a small bowel of tomatoes and peppers. Nothing traditional . The broccolini was inedible since it was drenched in lemon - could not taste the vegetable. The veal shank - was another breaded /fried fish with no flavor. We expected more from someone who boasts her Italian heritage . I don't think she knows how to cook"

Well turned out that's when brunch ends and only lunch is available. This was not made clear and there was no attempt to accommodate us. \n\nMore importantly, the food was mediocre with incredibly overpriced small portions. We got a variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and pastas. Even something as simple and classic as pasta carbonara was actually labeled bad by my companions. The sandwich orders only came with half a sandwich and the meatball appetizer, for example, came with 5 meatballs the size of a large grape or olive. The servers were friendly but very slow and gave no insight into the menu. When ordering those meatballs as an app for 5 guys, we asked if we should get 2...she says \"oh well there are 5,\" as if it was a sufficient portion. All of that for $50+ per person. We spent the whole meal talking about how much better the Caesars bacchanal buffet was. \n\nOn the plus size the space is beautiful."

When I first walked in I was impressed by how she honored her grandmother and grandfather by having their movie posters hanging on the walls.   Once inside we were seated at a table for two and was greeted by the waiter.  However, he didn't offer us a cocktail menu with the dinner menu.  When he asked if we wanted a cocktail I had to ask for it and then waited a while to get it and for him to take our order.  Appetizers were good especially the crab aranchini.   The entre options were good however what you get for the price is very small portions.  I paid $25.00 for a fistful of bucatini and the branzino fish was really dry.  Once we were finished I had to ask the server to clean our placemat as he was placing our dessert silver ware down.  If I hadn't asked I don't think he would have done it.   For dessert we ordered the lemoncello souffl\u00e9 which was well worth the 17 minute wait.  That was by far one of the best desserts i've ever had.  The people next to us ordered the cookies which looked really good and since Giada is a pastry chef by education, I don't think we would have been disappointed had we ordered those.   My rating is basically low due to the service and the small portions for the price you pay.  The dining experience wasn't what I had expected but I definitely would give it another try."

I was so excited to try her restaurant, but was not impressed.  \n\nWe sat at the bar by choice - there were open tables, but we knew we just wanted a cocktail and small bites, so grabbed some bar seats.   We were noticed right away and given menus and the tablet to review.\n\nWe started with signature cocktails the Riso Amaro and Le Notti - these were fantastic.\n\nWent downhill from there - we ordered the Sausage Arancini and drunken goat cheese.  We received the drunken goat cheese first and noticed it was frankly just cheese with nothing to eat it with.  At that point the bartender did bring us the bread plate - the crackers were good, but the cheese was frankly just cheese -nothing exciting.    The Arancini arrived next and I cut one in half - didn't see any sausage, but took a bite.  Was surprised to have a crab taste - my husband then tried and he agreed - they were the wrong ones.   We flagged down the bartender and asked her what she thought - she kinda shrugged and brought over the other bartender who agreed - those couldn't be right they aren't the correct color. They double checked the order (yes, we did order sausage and not crab)   He took away the plate and went to the kitchen.  he returned saying \"those were wrong they will get you the correct ones\"    There wasn't an apology or anything - we felt like we were the ones who made the mistake.\nthe order finally came out and we ate them - just ok - definitely better than the crab ones, but not impressed.   It might have also been the service that just left a bad taste in our mouths. \n\nA bill just showed up in front of us - not asking if we wanted dessert or anything.   We paid and left - When we walked by the hostess desk there were 3 employees standing there putting on lipstick and chatting - there was no \" thanks for coming - join us again\"   \n\nwell we won't be joining again - work on the service and tighten up the kitchen - just an expensive tip from me to you."

We were seated at 9:45pm, and because we had the tasting menu, we did not leave until about 12:30pm.  I called about 2-3 weeks in advance and had about 2 or 3 time slots to choose from in a span of a week for a party of four for dinner.  So if you want to dine here, call well in advance.  \n\nThe restaurant is very nicely located in the Cromwell, across from Ceasar's Palace and kitty corner from the Bellagio.  The view from the windows is fabulous, but you'll have to request a window table when you make reservations.\n\nSince we had to wait for a bit for our table, we had some cocktails at the bar. The service was a tad slow, but since they gave us an iPad that acted as the menu, we just played with it and explored the different drinks. Overall our cocktails were okay and cost $15 each.\n\nThe tasting menu for the night was spot on with Giada's style.  If you have cooked from her recipes, you know what I mean. The flavor profiles were aligned with what I have made from her books before. Here's the overview:\n\nBread selection - all of it was very yummy, but the rosemary foccacia was the star. We knew we had a lot of food coming, but we still had to ask for more bread JUST BECAUSE!\n\nAntipasti - a selection of four items.  I forgot the names of everything, but I ate everything but the stuffed peppers with goat cheese (not a fan of cheese).  The other three items were perfect, and I especially loved the eggplant mix.\n\nSecond course - my friend and I ordered one each so we could try both.  She ordered the Vegetable Bolognese and I ordered the Lemon Spaghetti with Shrimp.  The Lemon Spaghetti was surprisingly good and the Shrimp were \"ginormous\"!  I personally liked the Vegetable Bolognese more, but both dishes were great.  Again, the flavor profile is SO GIADA.\n\nThird course - I chose the Sicilian Roasted Lamb.  I love lamb, but I must confess that I was SO stuffed because everything before this was so good that I could not truly enjoy this.  It was good, but if I had more space I would probably rave about it more.  I was so full that I could not even try the family-style sides of Smashed Potatoes and Sweet Corn (sniff sniff).\n\nDessert - as stuffed as I was, because they roll to your table a big cart filled with all types of temptations, I had to try a few.  The gelato was good, especially a coffee flavored one. My only complaint was that it was melting too much.  The cookies were good, as was everything else. Again, I was too stuffed to truly enjoy it.  \n\nI wish I had a second stomach for the Third Course and Dessert!\n\nAlong with the Tasting Menu, you also get a nice folder with some recipes, the tasting menu you had, and a signed copy of Giada's photo.  The only sad part of this dinner was that I brought my copy of Giada's book all the way from California...and she wasn't there to sign it. Boo hoo. But at least I still got a signed photo.\n\nIf I get to come here again with my husband, I'll be making reservations here as soon as we book the trip!"

Bright, clean and spacious while maintaining a cute comforting coziness. I definitely want to live here, but I will settle for raiding homegoods to replicate my home into a cheap interior decor knockoff. \n\nThe food: Portions are tiny, as is expected with ~fine dining, yet the quality and flavors of these dishes didn't warrant such a high price tag. Nothing about the flavor combinations was innovative or spectacular; in all honesty it was quite plain and lackluster. Mushrooms with almonds were plain and seriously tiny, chicken marsala meatballs were dry, and the gorgonzola kale salad was good but.. I could make this at home. The rest of the small plates we got were alright but again, so unmemorable that my photographic foodie mind can't even remember what they were for this review.\n\nCocktails are delicious and strong. The bellinis are great, as is the drink with egg whites (can't remember the name, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.. including the \"G\" monogrammed on top in foam). Service is outstanding, and the wait staff is very attentive. There's also a photobooth where you can entertain yourself with while waiting, but unfortunately none of the pictures were printing while we were there.\n\nLeft kind of hungry and with noticeably lighter pockets. Next time, I'll spend my money elsewhere. Granted its Vegas, so what the hell *throws cash everywhere*."

I approached the hostess stand and gave my name.  The hostess looked at me like I had two heads.  What's up with that? Next, we each had a martini in our hands that we brought up from downstairs.  The only thing the hostess said to us was \"you can't bring those in here.\"  I understand that but no welcome, hello, glad you're here, your table will be ready shortly, nothing but \"you can't bring those in here.\"  So, we finished our martini's.  As we were being lead to our table, I asked for a window seat.  Hostess said ok, sure but walked us right to a very small table that was the furthest away from the window.  I could tell she was not going to budge so we accepted the table.  \n\nNext, we ordered the chicken cacciatore for two because we had seen a Food network episode where Giada cooked that at her place in Italy and it looked so wonderful.  What a joke!  The \"chicken\" was the size of a very small cornish game hen.  The leg was the size of an average person's thumb.  I'm not exaggerating.  There was nothing on the dish but this tiny, dry, sad bird.  The waiter even came out before the chicken was served and strongly suggested we get a side.  So we got the asparagus.  So, to break it down, a bottle of wine (one of the least expensive on the menu-nothing extravagant), one tiny, dry bird, and some asparagus cost $250 + tip.  This restaurant is very beautiful but the food and service do not live up to the ambiance and price point of the restaurant.  Will never be back and will highly suggest you spend your $$$$ elsewhere.  There are many high end restaurants in Las Vegas that know how to treat customers and that serve fantastic food."

Every last detail is fancy and luxe (down to the personalized toilet paper in the bathrooms!) and there's wraparound views of the strip. Now this is a Vegas restaurant. Great job Giada! I didn't expect anything less. \n\nThe food is delicious, but be warned, the portion sizes are small. Just look at Giada. You don't look like that by eating much. There's even a quote from her written all around the restaurant, \"eat a little of everything, but don't eat a lot of anything\". If you need more food, do what my sister and I did and share a few plates. \n\nThe meal starts off with a complimentary bread plate. So.Freaking.Cute. Like I said, every single detail of this place is impeccable. The bread comes on a wooden board with several little serving dishes of lemon butter, capers, salt, and the most delicious olive oil and vinegar. The bread is a little ramekin of focaccia (my fave!), breadsticks, and Parmesan crisps. The entire spread really only feeds 2 and you get 1 per every 4 people, but like I said the servings are small. You can be like us and ask for more. By the way, I know I just dedicated an entire paragraph to the bread, but it's so good, it more than deserves it. \n\nAs far as the food, there were some really delicious dishes and others that left much to be desired.\nStandout favorites include: rigatoni with veggie bolognese, surf and turf, salmon, and artichoke arancini. \n\nThings we suggest skipping: Brussel sprout crostini and lemon souffl\u00e9. \n\nService was fantastic. Very attentive and friendly. \n\nOverall, if you're a Giada fan or not, this is great dining. (Disclaimer: I'm a huge Giada fan so my review may or may not be a bit biased. It was probably 3.5 stars, but yelp doesn't let you do half stars so 4 it is!)"

I hope it wasn't serious. We were looking forward to trying Giada's but not today. Not sure how to rate it since we couldn't try it, but wanted other folks to be aware in case they set out on a cold morning and become surprised like we did."

I tried to make reservations for Giada for the night, but they were booked solid.  That's OK because the hostess said we could try the bar.  We came in and there were a few spots open, but they were filled up pretty quickly as well.\n\nWe got a few beers and ordered the mussles and Pappardelle.  The mussels tasted very fresh and had an excellent broth.  The Pappardelle is a pork ragout with parmigiano reggiano.  The pork ragout was excellent and tender.  I would definitely order that again."

            "review": "Giada's had a ton of hype ever since it opened this past summer. Reservations had to be booked two months in advance. Expectations were high when I finally tried the food last weekend with a high probability of disappointment (as is usually the case with these types of celebrity restaurants). The menu is naturally Italian cuisine, but with Californian influences. \n\nWe started with a few appetizers: the orzo meatballs, the lobster arancini, and the wood roasted mushroom pizzette. The orzo meatballs were a heavy favorite on reviews, but I found them to be ordinary. The lobster arancini was a huge failure. While it was well-coated and fried, the name was quite deceiving. There was no lobster at all - no chunks of meat, no flavor of lobster whatsoever, not even imitation meat. I thought I was mistaken from the first ball, but by the time I bit into the second, I was sure there was no lobster. I love mushrooms so the wood roasted mushroom pizzette was my favorite appetizer. It was topped with gorgonzola, which didn't overwhelm the mushrooms. \n\nWhen at Giada's, forget about the mains because the pasta is the star of the show. We shared the pappardelle and bucatini. The handmade pasta was perfectly cooked. Now, that's what I call al dente! The pork ragout was tender and flavorful, but I really liked the bucatini's spicy red sauce. I enjoyed both pastas, but the bucatini was a slight favorite. \n\nGet used to high prices for small portions when dining on The Strip. Each appetizer was 4 ounces each and each pasta dish was 8 ounces. Surprisingly, I was comfortably full after the pastas so we skipped out on dessert. I wasn't blown away by the food (especially not the appetizers), but I could appreciate the pasta dishes. The space itself has great views of the Bellagio fountains and Caesar's. I also love restaurants that have an open kitchen where you can watch them prepare everything from the pasta to even the charcuterie."

The salad was one of the best ever, fried capers, house made croutons, and the biggest shrimp I've ever seen! \nIt was a great lunch and would definitely eat here again!"

Wall decorations include many Giada family photos, posters from her grandfather's movie career as well as Giada retail items which were in abundance. The hostess stand was staffed by several people waiting to escort you to your table. Upon entering the restaurant dining room the hostess offers a tour of the open kitchen and describing the items on display starting with the antipasti table. We received a nicely located corner table for four people next to the windows. The restaurant uses iPads as well as printed menus. I did have difficulty navigating the wine list on the iPad because it froze up. I was brought a second unit which encountered the same problem. Our server stated they were having problems with the wireless service. Thank goodness for low tech paper menus.\n\nThe dinner menu is wide and varied with many appetizers, pastas, seafood and meat dishes. The wine by the glass selection not extensive but did have some moderately price choices. Our server Turley was friendly and helpful. The following was ordered for our party of four.\nAppetizers:\nOrzo Meatballs were 5 to an order and tender with a tasty Pomodoro sauce.\nClams Casino topped with prosciutto, a new twist on an old school item. A large bowl of about 25 small clams were juicy and more than enough for four people.\n\nEntrees:\nBranzino - 3 crispy skin filets served with arugula and tangerine vinaigrette were tender and juicy\nVeal Chop Saltimbocca Milanese style - A very large portion which was very tasty\nRack of Lamb - 4 chops cooked perfectly as ordered medium rare\n7 oz Filet of Beef - comes with polenta but potatoes were requested as a substitute. The potatoes were tender balls dusted with cheese. The filet was ordered well done but several pieces were a little pink. Overall a nice piece of meat.\n  \nDesserts:\nThe dessert cart has a variety of treats that were beautifully displayed and explained to us. Our choices were:\nChocolate Sorbet\nCoffee Gelato\nTiramisu\n\nOur server offered complementary dessert to compensate for the steak. Although that was not expected or necessary it demonstrated the staff's willingness to satisfy the customer."

The food and service were exceptional and the environment with the views was perfect for this special occasion. Kevin, our server, was kind, knowledgeable and welcoming during the entire meal, from drink suggestions to the desert display, he really went above and beyond to make our dinner feel special.  We had the seafood risotto and lobster ravioli and I fully recommend them both. The risotto was al dente and the scallops cooked perfectly while the ravioli was a wonderfully blend of asparagus lobster and tarragon without any of the ingredients being overpowering. Kevin recommended our cocktails, the Destroyer ( which was like a tangerine margarita) and the La Strada ( which was a light and fruity limoncello) and we ordered the artichoke arancini, which were delicious. All in all, we would come back and explore the other items on the menu, because of the wonderful experience we had last night."

There were plenty of wait staff making sure you didn't need anything but they weren't intrusive where they interrupted your conversation and dinner ever 2 minutes.  The service was efficient. \n\nThey give you the option of eating the dishes family style which seems like a great idea and fits in line with giada's style and her philosophy.  However, I feel she would be better off having a separate menu for those interested in a family style serving of the food.  We thought it would be a great idea but some of the dishes are on the small end to be served family style with 4 people so I don't think you can get the full essence of the dish with just a couple of bites.  \n\nThe food itself was clean and fresh but it didn't necessarily stand out for me.  I enjoyed it don't get me wrong.  The one dish I did think was cooked well was the charred octopus."

The way I see it is, for the amount you pay, you better have exceptional food or exceptional service, and Giada have neither. Don't get me wrong , the food wasn't bad, just not any better than other no name Italian restaurant. Service was poor, waitress can't even manage a simple task of refilling drink.  The only thing Giada has going for it is a great local overlooking  the Strip. Wish I didnt' step through this door, at least my admiration for Giada's  (the Chef) cooking prowess would stay intact."

It has lots of art and is very inviting. The service was okay but I did need to ask  my waiter (Gary) to refill my water and after my entree came out I asked for a little bit of ground pepper. The man who brought me my food acted like I requested his first born child and questioned my decision. Needless to say because of his reaction I said forget the pepper. I had the spaghetti with lemon and herbs with shrimp. I will say this is some of the best cooked pasta I have ever had. It had very good flavors and with a little crack of black pepper it would have been perfect. The two large shrimp were cooked very well. Overall I would give this place another try to see if my service would be a little better because its in a great location, very inviting and food was pretty good."

Basic stuff like eggs, potatoes, toast, side of meatballs?  Ok it's an Italian joint.  I was last to get my food not including my husband sending his pizza back because the egg was way overdone.  But really didn't get to enjoy anything beacuse of the total lack of sevice.  People might want salt and pepper, why shakers are not on the table beats the hell outta me.  \n     So my meal is cold, flavorless, toast burnt to shit.  The waitress comes by to ask me if I'm done.  For f*cks sake I haven't even started, I ask for salt and pepper.  I get little boats I guess I'm supposed to pinch or pour on my food, it came with random hair in it, and now I'm done.  \n     Total garbage service after we didn't upsell to sparkling water.  We wanted non-alcoholic drinks but she never took our drink order.  I was able to sneak in a coffee request only because I asked for it with my food.  It was the wrong drink though.  They use Lavassa coffee the same crap as the movie theaters.  This is just not living up to the hype.  By the way, they'll add a tip to a party of six and run away when they drop off the bill although a party of six next to us was able to get separate checks.  I can't recommend this place and I won't be back."

Usually I'm against vegetable bolognese but this sauce was deep with flavor. Then we had dessert and coffee.

I had an eggplant parm appetizer, beet salad, and vegetable Bolognese. All were good, but the vegetable Bolognese in particular was so delicious. We ordered cookies for dessert, which came with a lemon ricotta cookie, a chocolate peanut butter cookie with a raspberry filling, and a brown butter chocolate chip cookie. I was also given a plate with an extra lemon ricotta and choc peanut butter as a birthday treat. All were tasty, but the chocolate peanut butter one was definitely my favorite. \n\nThe best part of our evening came in between our salad and entr\u00e9e course. We noticed a bit of commotion at the table next to us and quickly realized that Giada was there, chatting and taking pictures with every table. When she got to our table, we got to chat with her for a few minutes and she wished me a happy birthday, congratulated us on our engagement, and took a couple pictures with us.  I would've been completely happy with my experience at the restaurant even without Giada being there, but it definitely made my night. I'm so glad we were able to try out her restaurant, and would love to go back in the future."

My daughter had the Sweet Ricotta pink peppercorn, arugula, apple balsamic pizza. It came with enough arugula to feed a herd of rabbits. We had to remove to see the pizza. There was much sweetness to the pizza, and we thought it might be good for a shared appetizer but not a main cold dish.\n\nMy wife enjoyed the Muffuletta with the fried string zucchini. A bit bready but tasty.\n\nThe Super Tuscan at $17 per glass was very good. Probably not worth $17.\n\nI would not return for lunch but I would try the dinner menu.\n\nThe music in the restaurant was loud and 2010. Very strange.\n\nF"

He explained the menu and then took drink order and food order. We never saw him again until dessert. \n\nOur backwaiter was amazing. He refilled our glasses, asked how everything was and made us feel very welcome. \n\nWe had to ask for a dessert menu and then our main server showed up to take the order. Overall I was annoyed by our server. \n\nDrinks: 4 out of 5. So I ordered a Grey Goose and tonic and my husband ordered a Cosmo. His cosmo was 19$. I know we are in Vegas but good god. We have been other places in the strip and the prices were not this high for drinks. \n\nOverall it was good but with a few tweaks could be amazing."

Five stars for the food - my lobster ravioli was delicious. Four stars because what we ordered off the iPad regarding Giada's favorites, was missing one of the ingredients that was advertised (bell peppers) and replaced with giardiniera. \n\nFor the price you pay to dine here, I was not so impressed. I would definitely go back because of the friendly service, but I would probably just stick to a pasta dish, a drink and dessert."

The sweet onion carbonara was so gross and tasted like weird fish we had to send it back. The Gorgonzola pizza was just okay, and originally came out cold. We had to ask them to heat it up, and it tasted slightly better after. The grilled cheese was bad.. Had barely any pesto flavor, the bread was soggy, and overall it tasted watery. The zucchini side that came w the grilled cheese was super yummy tho. The minestrone soup lacked any flavor.  The beignets were extremely fluffy and I actually enjoyed these. Our waitress was really nice and the ambiance is amazing. But we had to wait 30 min past our reservation to be seated and we ordered a veggie antipasti which never came. Our whole family left disappointed. I still love giada, but unless I've heard they've revamped the food I will never return."

Servers were awesome with great suggestions and made me feel like I was their most important customer that night. Then of course there was the amazing food. The appetizers are so good and so numerous it becomes almost impossible to not want to try at least two or three. Eating a dinner of six to eight of the perfect proportioned appetizers gives you a variety it is hard to match for an Italian meal this side of Boston's North end. And finally the atmosphere is very nice without being pretentious. In short the best selection of Italian food in Vegas with a staff that greatly enhances the surroundings and experience."

The spaghetti was also good but the cost is now $34 per order even though all the menus online say $28, so that is a pretty hefty increase already.  We were also charged $15 per appetizer even though some were $13 and $14.  Honestly i didnt pay attention when we paid or i would have brought it to the attention of the staff.   I also didn't scrutinize the in hand menu for pricing changes so that part is my fault\n\nOverall Very good food but I agree with the other reviewers that cost per portion is \"off\" even for vegas, and the fact that the spaghetti has already increased over 20% is troublesome.  \n\nThe hostesses were good, no issues being seated and we didn't feel pressured at all by the wait staff.  Had a great sommelier named Theresa and all in all a good evening but I would encourage the restaurant to update the menu on their own website as well as open table if they want to stop the pricing confusion."

We stopped by in the morning and made a reservation for dinner, (thought we got lucky.) I have to say we were all so disappointed that I try not to bring the experience up. My husband claims it ruined the whole weekend for him. The portions are tiny and the prices are huge. Our waiter was much more interested in his table of young girls to the point we had to wait and wait to ask for water refills. Our favorite course was the anti pasta appetizer, but  it went down hill from there. The  tortellini I ordered must have been from the night before, dry and sitting in a pool of olive oi, all 6 of them. I would have been embarrassed to serve this dish!  We left unsatisfied and rather shocked at what we got for the exorbitant prices. The restaurant is indeed beautiful and has an amazing view of the strip. Our waiter was less than attentive and down right rude when we turned down dessert. I would not recommend this restaurant, there are sooooo many better choices in Vegas. Quit frankly I am shocked at how many good review she gets. That certainly was not our experience. We regretted not getting pizza and blowing $500 on the tables instead."

The waitress told us that Sunday brunches feature bottomless mimosas that are made with that sparkling wine. The prices are a bit steep but it seems you pay for the ambience of the room and being so close to the strip as well as the wine; we will be back to give the food a second chance at dinner or lunch.

But we actually got seated at around 45minute mark. Now that's well and fine things happened, but at least acknowledge your guest that things are running late. No they don't have a mobile messaging system to let you know that tables are ready. \n\nService was a fail for me. If you claim to be a higher end dining place then the level of expectation is obviously different. We were seated and wasn't acknowledged for about 15 mins, no menu, water, hi hello how are you, nope none. We were invisible people. Mind you our table was still a bit dirty from previous service. Ugh.\n\nAnd then our server finally arrived, she was nice. \n\nWe ordered Burrata, they ran out. Ordered another dish.\n\nTiming was off, just when we were served our bread & cheese platter. A server comes running in wanting to serve entree. Uhm. No.\n\nFood was underwhelming, my heart was so broken I was expecting more from Giada. It's her only restaurant so I figured she was on top of her game with QC control\n\nApp: Mozarella with chili pesto - was bland there was no heat and the basil was non existent\n\nOrzo Meatballs was average\n\nMuffalada, lacked olives was bland\n\nG's baked pasta, I kid you not, the Rao's bottled pasta sauce tastes way better\n\nSangria, white was one dimensional\n\nLemonade was tasty the first time we got it, it had club soda and maybe basil in it the refill was just plain lemonade.  Both $6. Beyond pissed when we saw the bill. Oh and it took forever to get a refill, yes we knew it was not bottomless.

The bar is packed, even at 10pm which they also advised in advance. Found a spot on the end. Two bartenders helped us, Robert and Chris I think. Both gave awesome service & so personable. We enjoyed our cocktails very much! \n\nWe got a window table which I was very excited about. The view of Ceasars Palace :) It took a while to get menus. Our server, Jessie I think it was. Female with dark hair brought the wine list first. Everything on the menu looked amazing but my stomach couldnt handle one of each thing. We ordered the Chicken Marsala Meatballs to start. Amazing! VERY small order so dont be surprised. I think there were only 4 bite size pieces. We didnt get the complimentary bread before the appetizer so I had to ask for it. Presentation was impressive. I enjoyed the lemon butter with the Rosemary Olive Oil bread. We were brought St. Germain compliments of Giada. That was a nice touch & it was good! Not too floral. I enjoyed just sipping on it. We ordered Iced Tea's with the Raspberry Essence the same time we ordered the app and entrees and didnt get it until we were in the middle of our entree's after I asked for it. Instead of an apology, our server quickly left the table and yelled at her busser. The Iced Tea service is very impressive I must say. Comes with a glass straw! One order comes with two full glasses and are not refillable. I had the famous Spaghetti which was delish! Those prawns are huge! The boyfriend had the Salmon with succotash, yummy!!!! And a side of lemon potatoes. Never in my mind would think to put those two together but it just worked. We were both getting full but I was not about to pass up dessert because I really wanted gelato! The beautiful dessert cart came by & of course everything looked wonderful but I already planned on getting gelato so we got one of each flavor, White Coffee & Toasted Banana. OMG! Best gelato ever! Both were amazing, I dont know which one I enjoyed more. The server brings the check & it comes with an Itouch servey. The bf fills it out cause we def had comments to make! When she comes back from swiping the card she then mentions our anniversary. Kinda late dont you think! As we were standing up she brings an anniversary drink. It was a basil infused sparkling lemonade. A lil sour & too sweet for me but good. I wish she brought that before we were leaving cause I had to sit back down to drink it. \n\nAvi was the front manager for the night & as we were first getting seated he introduced himself. During our meal he came by again to shake both our hands & asked if everything was ok. I wanted to mention all the things our server missed but he came by when I had a mouth full of food. He was very nice & im impressed he went to every table & introduced himself. That is quality service.\n\nThe service from our server only could have been better but I will definitley be back. The food is just outstanding. Im a fan of her show & Giada is my favorite Food Network star so of course I was excited she opened a restaurant here. I can def see her personality in the design of the room. Its large, so open & clean."

It is one of  my favorite restaurants and so I was quite dismayed to read all the negative reviews and low ratings on Yelp prior to our going there. We took friends for breakfast at noon, and we were totally thrilled by our dining experience!!!\n\nThe main reason I am writing this review is because of our outstanding server, Christoper. He is truly one of the best servers I have ever had!!! He was so friendly and open and kind to us and had the most infectious smile. He had a complete grasp of the menu and made the most excellent suggestions when asked. He was so helpful and was always there when we needed him. He took a photo for us and even showed us how to shoot pictures on our iPhones without having the glare from all the beautiful light that streams into the restaurant from the vast windows. One of the things I liked most about him was that he was also very discreet and totally professional. He did not feel that he needed to put on a \"show\" for us as sometimes happens with servers in Las Vegas. He was just always there for us in the background when we needed him.\n\nI also want to complement our backwaiter. I neglected to get his name, but he was so friendly and gave us so much information about the delicious G cocktail when we asked him. Also, our water glasses and coffee cups were never empty!\n\nI made a reservation for noon the previous day and requested a table by the window with a view of the Bellagio fountains, as this was our friends' first time at Giada. We were seated immediately by a lovely, friendly hostess and got the perfect table.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant is everything you would expect from Giada, elegant, understatedly pretty and in the best of taste, from the decor and furniture right down to the tableware and placemats.\n\nThe food as usual was superb! We ordered scrumptious strawberry and pineapple polenta waffles and a carbonara pizza to start, which we all shared. Our friends ordered lobster hash. I had the salmon cakes benedict which were outstanding!!!! The hubs ordered the sausage and eggplant lasagna which was very small but as other yelpers have said is not meant to be a main course. It came with a small arugula salad and as my husband is not a large eater, it was the perfect size for him. The taste and presentation  of all our food was beyond excellent. My only complaint was that parts of the lobster hash were cold when the dish came out.\n\nThe cocktails were wonderful. I had a peach bellini and my girlfriend had the signature cocktail, the G, which was out of this world.\n\nYelpers have complained about the portion sizes of the food, but we were stuffed by the time we left. The portions are small, more comparable to Paris than America, but they are not minuscule by any means. The time it took to get our food may have been slow by some standards, but in my opinion was perfectly paced in order for us to enjoy our cocktails and conversation The whole dining experience was definitely pleasant and relaxing.\n\nI just cannot say enough about the wonderful experience we had at Giada!!!"

We sat for about 10 minutes before  I asked a random staff member for menus,  He brought the menus, apologized for his coworker who was supposed to be our server, and said he would be right over.  Okay, so another 13-15 minutes passes and no one has come to greet us or take our order.  Again, I summon another random staff member and tell him that we are ready to order.  This man pours us water and assures us our server, who has walked past us numerous times, will be right with us.  He NEVER stopped to say anything. The only reason we even had menus or water was because we had to ask for it.  That is absolutely ridiculous. Every other table around us is being served, including a table with guests that arrived AFTER us.  By now, its about 6:50.  Our reservation was at 6:00pm.  Not one person has come to our table, so, we stood up and walked out.. It might has well have been a Mississippi Woolworths in 1954. All we needed them to do was throw hot coffee in our faces and have them call us the N word.  As we left, we walked right past the person who was supposed to be our server and he just stood there with a retarded look on his face.\n\nBefore we exited the restaurant, my sister did speak with the manager Carisa, and she did alert her boss who emailed my sister, so at least she did report the incident, but still, this whole situation was completely unacceptable.  I really wanted to eat there, but I will never give my money to that establishment. Nope. No thank you. Not a chance. Never."

Was a little concerned about the portion size, but I was pleasantly surprised in all fronts.\n\nOur waiter, Joseph, was chatty, in a good way. Told us that there would be no rush to get us oh so enjoy our meal and time with family. \n\nWe first ordered drinks, all named after Dino DeLaurentis' movies. My daughter and I had the Barbarella, my husband had the Serpico and my son in law had the Conan with Vodka instead of Tequila. I loved my Barbarella  which is a riff on a Moscow Mule, but if you like Manhattan's the Serpico was to die for!!!  My husband begged for the recipe and they were kind enough to give it to him. \n\nWe opted for the $120 tasting menu and it was better than anything I expected!! Antipasto plate, yummy with one of four kinds each.  The pasta course, we had all three varieties, rigatoni good, but lemon shrimp was wonderful!! \n\nBread tray comes with all kinds of cute accoutrements, but I loved the lemon marscapone butter!! \n\nThen we all ordered the tenderloin, cooked perfectly with some asparagus and snap peas with it. The sides were sensational. \n\nFor dessert you get 3 choices from a dessert cart. Lots of gelato and sorbet, cookies, tiramisu and much more! \n\nIt was a glorious night, a little pricier than I usually go, but I was glad that my experience was not sketchy at all. \n\nAnd with the tasting menu, you get a fancy portfolio with recipes (ours included the lemon ricotta cookie and the heavenly smashed potatoes! ) plus an autographed photo of Giada herself!"

He went above and beyond in accommodating me with vegetarian options in the tasting menu, making sure I was not left out and had plenty to eat. He also recommended these yummy St. Germaine spritzers for an anniversary toast.\n\nThese are just a few things that made our experience at Giada's memorable and when in Vegas again, we certainly will be back to dine at this restaurant."

One was a Gibson straight up and the other an apple martini.  The Gibson was $15.00 and the Apple martini was $17.00.  They had decided that I needed Grey Goose in my apple martini unbeknownst to me.  Both Martinis didn't even come close to filling up the small martini glasses.\n\nNext we ordered the buratta cheese plate.  It came with the cheese and a tiny row of salt.  Nothing else.  Where was the bread, balsamic, prosciutto or anything else to compliment it?  We were suppose to eat it with a spoon with nothing else.  I guess simplicity is the answer.   We ordered the orzo meatballs.  They were the size of large jawbreakers and had no flavor that a beginner cook couldn't figure out.  I'm sorry but this was ridiculous.  Then for $37.00 we had the Brancino.  We had to skin it ourselves.  I had skin all over my hands.\n\nThe venue is beautiful, but these Strip restaurants are out of control and we live here.\n\nWhat a disappointment."

After we were seated a waiter came to our table. He took a moment to introduce himself in not the most welcoming way. I asked if he could take a quick picture of us because we were excited to be there. In the most rude way possible he said... not now because he had food coming out of the kitchen. Now it's fine if you're busy, but there is a way to say it in a nice manner. I don't think I have ever had someone be so rude to me at a restaurant. Especially when I was about to pay $150 a person. As for the food... NOTHING came out hot or even warm. Everything was room temp. We put our entree orders in around 8:30pm and did not get served them until after 10pm. We were told that the kitchen was running way behind because it was a new menu. And during all of this not one time did someone come over and offer us a glass of champagne, desert or anything. You go to almost any restaurant and your order is that behind a manager will come out and apologize. I can't imagine that this is the image Giada wants for her restaurant. Major disappointment!"

We were not disappointed with the decor, service, views and most importantly, the food! I read some of the negative service reviews prior to making our reservation, but we didn't see any evidence of that during our very delicious and relaxing lunch at Giada. They promptly took our order, checked on us several times and repeatedly made sure our water glasses and coffee cups were filled. Service was effective and prompt without being uncomfortable or rushed. So sit back and just enjoy this dining experience! \n\nThey offer beautiful views of the Vegas strip from most of the tables at Giada and you'll enjoy the warm and airy decor. We started off with the Orzo Meatballs which were very good, but not astounding. I then ordered the Italian Chicken and Waffles for my entree and my husband ordered the Salmon Cake Benedict. It was one of the best Chicken and Waffles I've ever had and I've had many! The chicken was cooked to absolute perfection. It was served warm, flavorful and crispy without being greasy. The cacciatore sauce was as delicious as it was beautiful, savory and oh so right. Now I'm not a big fan of waffles, but the polenta, parmesan waffles were amazing. They were light and savory and the perfect pairing with the fried chicken and cacciatore sauce. Do yourself a favor and order this dish! We ate at several fine establishments in Las Vegas, but this entree stands on its own. Wow, I was so impressed with the flavors and preparation that made this dish so unbelievably delicious! I wish we had this restaurant in SF!"

            "review": "Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh. This is going to be a long review so brace yourself, but this is probably one of the worst experience I've had with a restaurant for a long time...\n\nIt was a good start. The restaurant is nicely decorated with an open kitchen and a swanky set up with an option to be seated at couches, tables with great views of the strip and Bellagio's water fountain, and also a back room for a large party. \n\nWell, and that was the good. Yea, sadly that's all it was for us. Let's begin with the downhill roll...starting with the service.\n\n|| SERVICE ||\nUnfortunately we were not seated on any comfy couches, or in an area with a great view, instead we were seated at this 2-person table that seems like they just stuffed in the hallway because they had extra space. \n\n1ST ADVICE: request a table with a nice view - along the window facing the Bellagio water fountain.\n\nOur server came by and greeted us, gave us our menus, and was MIA for the next 15-20 minutes. No drinks, just bread on the table. When she finally remembered we existed, I asked her for recommendations and she just spilled out 10 items under 5 seconds with names that sometimes didn't describe the dish well. I responded with \"Ok... so I didn't catch any of that, would you mind repeating yourself and describing what the dish is or at least pointing it out on the menu?\" \n\nThis is my issue right off the bat. Let's be frank, these dishes are priced ridiculously high, so I'm under the impression that you, Giada, are setting your restaurant to be somewhat high class, no? So okay let's agree this is a high class restaurant. High class food should come with high class service, am i right? I definitely didn't receive the appropriate service you would typically associate with  this high-end dining.\n\nOkay the order is in and still no water. I guess it's really hard to notice anyone sitting in this little hallway. Our server's assistant finally came by with a pitcher of water and poured it directly into my glass sitting on the table. Oh me oh my, you can go to a hole in the wall and they know to grab the glass, face away from the customer, and pour the water preventing it from splashing everywhere - I MEAN COME ON IT'S COMMON RESTAURANT KNOWLEDGE. Well of course the water spilled all over the table so she grabbed her white linen and attempted to clean it up. It obviously wasn't enough to clean up the mess so she left and came back with a dirty rag to wipe the rest. Ugh, this is such a classy restaurant.\n\n|| FOOD ||\nOkay let's start off with the bread because that was pretty much the highlight of the evening. You think I'm kidding but the bread was pretty damn delicious. Assorted bread, bread sticks, etc with of course olive oil to soak and butter on the side. Not sure how to really describe it cause it's quite simple, but I thoroughly enjoyed going through all of it. \n\n2ND ADVICE: Get full off the bread.\n\nThe food didn't take too long to come out, thankfully. We started with the meatballs and octopus.\n\nThe meatballs come in 4 and have the height of about a half dollar. I'm not quite sure why these are a popular item on the menu. There were quite bland and really not that remarkable. \"It's just .... meatballs..\" was my reaction.\n\nThe octopus is terrible. Just skip it. It was over-charred so basically I was just eating burnt flavorless rubber. I honestly can make it for you for $16 if that's what you want.\n\n3RD ADVICE: Don't waste your money on the meatballs and octopus.\n\nFor the main entree we went with the popular Spaghetti and the Rigatoni. The Spaghetti was good but it's not like it saved the night or anything. It was dried out and needed more sauce. The Rigatoni was just bland. The Spaghetti came in a size of a fist with two large prawns, and the Rigatoni could maybe give you a couple more bites than the Spaghetti. Both were tiny dishes, so good luck to all the hungry men dining here. With all the disappointments I was happy to find something that left me pleased... VERY happy to say that the pasta was cooked to perfection!!\n\nReally, all I could say was that this whole experience was BASIC. Expensive basic food with 'meh' service."

When making reservations I requested a table by the front window so we could have a view of the strip. I was told we wouldn't be guaranteed that unless we spend $100+ but they would still mark it down as requested. We ended up getting a window seat but it was towards the back where the shutters cover most of the window so we didn't really have a view. Didn't think we would spend over $100 but we did so we should've just guaranteed the spending of $100 when making the reservations & maybe gotten a better view.\n\nThere's a free photo booth in the waiting area which I thought was cute & a nice touch. \n\nService was a little slow. We weren't in any hurry but I felt it drag a little bit. We were treated very nicely.\n\nPricey. Food was very good. Heavy but small portions. I got the rigatoni & my boyfriend got the spaghetti which came with the biggest shrimp I'd ever seen/had! Both dishes were very good & again different than your traditional spaghetti & rigatoni.\n\nWhen making the reservations I told them it was our anniversary & for dessert they brought us a cute dish with 2 of Giada's famous cookies, lemon & chocolate with \"happy anniversary\" written on the plate. Very cute! (Lemon cookie was delish!)\n\nI will be going back again because I'd like to try the brunch menu."

            "review": "This place is off to a great start considering how ambitious the menu is, how large the dining room is, and how absolutely slammed busy it is every second it is open. The only issues we had were with pacing--all of our smaller plates came out in a hurry, then there was a loooooooooong wait for the final larger plates. Well, there was also a minor issue with the staff not knowing which of the coffees were and were not available in decaf. \n\nThe place was full, but we were seated immediately upon arriving for our 7:45 reservation. The room is arranged comfortably and even though it's busy, the tables are far enough apart that there's a busy hum without being too loud. I think you would probably have to be right on the windows to have much Bellagio fountain view, but it was also very pleasant to watch the crescent moon rise over Caesars from our table. \n\nThe bread service is excellent, with crunchy breadsticks, a flatbread, and a life-changing rosemary focaccia. It also comes with multiple condiments, like pink Himalayan salt, chili pepper flakes, lemon ricotta and basil pesto. (We actually used the condiments throughout our meal, which was fun.)\n\nFor the small plates, we had the oyster crudo, the charred octopus, the chicken marsala meatballs and some of the reggiano cheese. Every one was excellent except the octopus, which was tough in some bites and could have used a bit more seasoning. (But maybe the bar had just been set impossibly high the previous night, when I had the best octopus I've ever eaten at, surprisingly, CarneVino.) The chicken marsala meatballs displaced the albondigas at Julian Serrano for me as the best meatballs in Vegas. If they had been any more moist, they would not have been able to hold their shape and they burst with flavor. \n\nFor the larger dishes, we had the lemon spaghetti (with shrimp as big as lobster tails) and the branzino with tangerine glaze. They were both wonderful. We were so full we decided to forego dessert. \n\nLots of thought has obviously gone into the menu, as there is a wide range of dishes and every plate is beautifully presented on dishware that looks like it was selected to suit the individual dish. Service throughout was smooth and attentive (I think they would rather die than let a water glass be empty) and quite knowledgeable about the menu except for the decaf issue.\n\nOverall, I do plan to go back next time I'm in Vegas. The menu is set up (and priced) so that you can sample a variety of items without breaking the bank. For two people, we had cocktails (love the iPad cocktail menu with pictures), wine, four smaller plates and two larger plates and with tax and tip it was $252. I consider that perfectly reasonable for an event restaurant of this quality in this location."

Only knock was the spicy sauce might have overpowered the mozzarella taste but I didn't mind the added flavor. We got the salumi pizza and a salad. The pizza was really good, dough was on point, toppings were good only thing is the bottom I would've liked slightly more crispy (slight preference on my part).

The only thing that deters me from this place is the ridiculous over pricing and smaller portions. \n\nThe waiter introduced us to Giada's style as an emphasis on feeling like family and \"eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything.\" \n\nI would describe this place as tapas style if anything, there a lot of small plates to choose from, but they are in fact really small bites. So if you're starving I suggest getting a few antipastas and to share for the table before moving onto the main dishes. The pastas are served in 5 oz servings, if that gives you an idea. \n\nAs for ambiance, this place is super classy. My friend wore flip flops and felt self-conscious the entire time...until the guy next to us sat down in shorts and flip flops too. The decor is homey, but classy - it makes you forget where you are until you look out at the giant view of the strip. There's also a fun photobooth to print or email pictures for free while you wait for your table! \n\nBack to the main thing though - the food! \nWe ordered a few things. We got the burrata and grilled artichoke antipastas to share. The burrata was fresh and mild and delicious and everything burrata should be. Albeit, it was difficult to slice in any graceful manner. The grilled artichokes were the mini hearts grilled to perfection, hints of lemon and herbs perfectly complimenting it. \n\nI ordered the chicken marsala meatballs as my main dish because I was actually still full from the brunch buffet we had that morning. 5 delicious meatballs and 2 cherry tomatoes came to my table looking a little underwhelming, but they were packed with flavor. \n\nMy vegetarian friend ordered the eggplant antipasta which was also delicious. The eggplant wasn't overcooked at all and the marinara sauce wasn't overpowering. \n\nMy other friend ordered the lamb parppadelle and it was amazing. The tomato based sauce brought out the lamb flavors in just the right, delicate way. \n\nI was reading through the reviews of this place and I started to think I was there on a good day because my food tasted delicious! That being said though, not sure if it's worth the prices really. \n\nBottom line: \nDid I enjoy dinner? Absolutely! \nWould I ever go back? Maaaybe. It's really pricey for what it is, so only if I actually hit the jackpot for once."

Everything we ate was good - my only problem was for the price of dinner you were left empty .  I so hate not to rave about a place but that would be my only big negative .  We are used to eating at pricy restaurants ..... We are not fast food people so it's not that we are yahoos and we were prepared to spend money .  Salads were great , appetizer , pastas were all good .  My Seafood Risotto lacked flavor for the risotto , but the scallops were perfect .  My husband liked his lobster Ravioli ."

            "review": "Friday Brunch- Due to pedestrian traffic and parking, we arrived 10 minutes late for our reservation. The first comment from the host was : \"You are Late, so we gave away your table\". ??? We were told we would have to Wait, in a disdainful tone. (First impression). I assumed that meant they were very busy.  In about 15 min, we were taken to a table in a more than half empty restaurant.  It is a beautiful dining area, however, we were given a table in a corner near a small door, which gave us a limited sight. The club chairs are comfortable, but not made for eating at a table , with manners of placing one hand in your lap, as both of my elbows had to be held up above the edge of the chair. \n  We received instant questioning and service for alcoholic drinks- several times. At the point she determined that the order was non-alcoholic, the waitress disappeared.  Water was provided, and our order taken, with much urging of adding more appetizers and courses. The choices were limited, and most entrees were not special enough to attract attention.  ( I enjoy all kinds of foods, herbs, preparations, and want something that I would not prepare).  Lavish was provided and excellent, leading me to believe that my expectations would be met.\n   The Lobster Roll was nicely cooked, prepped, and seasoned with a nice plating. ( it was on a crisp bread slice). The mushrooms were very good. No more water was poured, and the waitress disappeared.  We took our time to savor the food and atmosphere and engage in conversation. Not once did she return to check the results. We were finished, with the napkins on the table, and empty glasses, for quite some time before she returned. Water was replenished upon request. She did not ask if we wanted coffee, or dessert, and at that time, we were tired of sitting waiting for her return. \n   Very Disappointing!  In fact, it was the worst service in my 7 days of eating at various restaurants from moderate to high priced and small to large ownership.  I was tempted to low tip, but felt that would not be specific, so I did quietly tell the waitress what I felt about the quality of service, in case, it might be addressed in the future for others. I would suggest to the management, that they visit Mesa (Bobby Flay's restaurant to experience quality service . Giadas was high on my list, and although my adult son lives in the area, I would never take the time to visit again.  Improvement is Needed."

            "review": "We were excited to try this restaurant and made our reservation way in advance.  We had a 7pm reservation and only had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  We wanted the full experience so we ordered the tasting menu ($120ea) and the wine pairing ($70ea) for 4 courses.  While everyone (the waiter, his assistant and the sommalier) were very nice, none of them were in sync with each other.  We received our first wine pairing a good 15 min before the appetizer (a shared antipasto plate), so we didn't really pair them because the drink was finished.  The courses were then spaced far apart and the wine and food were not timed well.  You have a choice for pasta, entree and dessert, but they do not customize the wine to your choice of food and just serve the same to the table (for example, I had salmon and my fiance had steak and we were served the same wine.  It seems that they could have put in a little more effort.) The summary is that we went in at 7 and didn't finish until 9:45 and it cost around $500.  For that, I would say to skip this and go to Michael Mina's at the Bellagio."

            "review": "To summarize the food we had was great the service and waitress we had was terrible to say the least.\n\nWe tried to make a reservation ahead of time and of course it's very busy because it's a brand new and first giada restaurant.  We were informed by the hostess to come in and try to get a seat in the bar area as it was not a very busy night. Beware if you sit in the bar area it is a different menu than the regular dining.  We arrived and checked with the hostess and she showed us where we could sit in the lounge next to the bar. This is when the terrible experience started.... Keep in mind this is a Tuesday night and while all tables were full it was not busy other than that.\n\nIt took around 15 minutes to first be greeted by any server. We then got greeted by one server and got told another one would be around right away. 5 minutes later she came around.  We informed her that we would be eating in the lounge area and ordered drinks.  My girlfriend had a bad dairy allergy so we thought all of the vegan options on the regular menu would make this a great place to go.  Unfortunately the lounge menu had no vegan options, when asking the waitress for possible options without dairy she suggested ONE appetizer and was not knowledgable at all. When asking about other items she said she would check with the kitchen.. While she did that we ordered the one item.  We also asked for the bread provided to all customers who are dining which we NEVER received.  A kitchen staff brought the one item we ordered out and it was delicious.  Our waitress finally came back 10 minutes later and did not give us any information on the non dairy items nor did she bring over any bread. I did not want to wait any longer so I asked for the check stating that it didn't seem like the dairy allergy could be accommodated.  Meanwhile I know from looking at the full menu there are vegan items. The waitress did not even try and stop us from leaving or ask kitchen staff for recommendations.  It was truly a bad experience.  \n\nI had very high hopes for the restaurant. And it was the most anticipated dinner on our vacation. But to avoid my girlfriend being embarrassed or trying to deal with terrible waiting staff I can say I will not be coming back or recommending this to anyone else."

I must say that our whole dining experience here was top notch.  We had a great server, I think her name was Amber, and was able to get a table at the window which had some awesome views of the strip and Belagio's water show.  \nEverything we ordered was delicious.  Started off with the Wagyu beef salamis which were so amazingly addicting.  The Charred octopus which was so tender that it almost didn't tasted like octopus.  I guess I like my octopus somewhat chewy and it just didn't have that same consitency which must have been the reason I wasn't too impressed.  But none the less still very tasty.  And lastly the Imported Burrata which was very tasty with the balsamic salt that it came with.\nFor the mains we ordered the Veal chop milanese which was a generous portion of veal the was butterflied and deep fried with fontina cheese.  My favorite dish of the whole night was the crab and scallop risotto.  The risotto was perfectly cooked along with some of the best tasting scallops I have ever had.\n\nPros:\nOur server was the best.  She offered great suggestions, really nice, and came and checked up on us at the perfect times.\nThey have a nice wine list, with good variety of Californian wines.  \nI really liked their bread.  \nBeautiful restaurant with great views.  If you can try to get a window seat.\nThe food was great and liked everything that we ordered specially the crab and scalp risotto.\n\nCons:\nI did notice that some tables that looked like it might have been tight and hidden in the corners.  \n\nOverall:\nI highly recommend coming here.  Our experience was top notch and really enjoyed our time there. However, I can see how the restaurant may come across as \"pretentious\" to some and how some people might have had a totally different experience as ours."

We were greeted with a smile by the two hostess and waited just enough time to get into the Giada photo booth and snap a couple of photos for keepsake. We were then escorted to our table. Once we walked into the dining room, we were in awe. The dining room, to no surprise, was stunning. The view of the strip and along side Flamingo Road, there was frankly no bad seat in the restaurant.  Everyone we can into contact with greeted us with a smile and everyone, despite it being Christmas, seemed like they truly enjoyed working there.\n\nAfter getting situated our server, Rebecca, made a timely entrance with an introduction and made mention of several items on their Christmas menu, she also excited us with the house made Bloody Mary's, which we ordered.  Breakfast was perfect! We ordered items from the Christmas menu along with the daily menu: The Breakfast Contadina and Polenta en Cocotte. Prepared perfectly taste wise and portion wise for breakfast.  Our water cups were always filled and everyone seemed to work beautifully together. Breakfast was without a hitch not just with us, but every guest that dined there that day.\n\nThe only thing we regret was that we weren't back for dinner that same night. We will definitely return for the impeccable service and the overwhelming positive reviews that were written on dinner. The bar is set pretty high with just breakfast, hopefully it will be just as great, if not better with dinner. Can not wait!\n\nBravo!"

            "review": "Visiting Giada's restaurant was high on my list for my first Vegas trip.  Traveling by wheelchair, I was initially thwarted from the goal because floor level entry through the casino was by steps.  A tip from my hotel's bellhop sent me up the valet entrance where access was possible.\n\nThe restaurant was beautifully appointed and welcoming.  The views of the area out the big windows was spectacular (Bellagio fountains, Caesars).  A romantic and classy spot.  The windows were open but had to be closed due to windy conditions for those sitting near them.  (The bathroom was lovely, too!)\n\nThere was a high traffic volume for the restaurant making the seating and serving impersonal and infrequent.  There was some large party noise keeping this from being a peaceful retreat.  Menu looked yummy.  I chose a summer minestrone soup and a caponata for a light lunch.  The minestrone was divine--perfectly diced and equally sized veggies in a meat broth with a touch of parmesan melted as an accent.  Well-balanced flavors.  Sadly, the $10 soup was far less than a cup and gone quickly.  I guess you pay for the chef's name and not food volume.   The waitress described the caponata as a rough-cut hummus.  It was actually a rough cut eggplant with other little goodies like pine nuts and raisins.  It was good but served with only 3 small toast points.  There was plenty of the caponata left which I ate with a spoon.  I think Giada could've spared 2 more toast points (they called it \"lavash\") on this small tasting dish of $9.  \n\nWhile others had dainty desserts, I was never offered a dessert menu and left without.   While I deem the ambiance 5-star (my favorite location in all of Vegas) and the flavors 5-star, I left feeling a little jipped in service and still hungry after $24 of food/tip.  I would certainly go back for a second experience with her food and perhaps some meatier options on the menu."

            "review": "Ok, let's get the one thing out of the way. It can be pricey, but that's what is expected with a well know chef and being on the strip. That said, there are some nice differences that make Giada rise to the top versus the rest!\n\nFirst, the location is on the second floor of the new Cromwell casino an elegant boutique casino that sits in the corner of Flamingo and the strip. Well, if your looking for a good view point Giada is on that corner on the second floor!\n\nAtmosphere starts from the escalator that moves you to the elegant reception area with comfortable seating area an then, yes my favorite a photo booth! We all hate the wait to be seated area where people stand and look at each other annoyingly until someone calls your mispronounced name within what is hopeful, an hr later. Well, this place is cool and using the photo booth with your friends and family while you wait is lot better and it's free!\n\nService starts immediately with eager receptionist waiting to attend to you. However, the popularity and packed reservation gives them the little shortness in their attitude. Too much to go on in the decor and the design but it's very nicely sat with feminine, clean, yet elegant but not too over the top. For me, I like the clean feeling as you walk in the dining area.\n\nFood, let's just put a spot light on this right now! It's darn good! Best description is, simple, beautiful, and taste that will pleasantly surprise you. Never knew how wonderful a simple meat ball will taste or squash strings that you'll swear it's the best shoe string fries you ever had. Let's just say it's not your typical fill me up place littered on the strip to fulfill your hunger from night after drink binging. Plus, putting your famous name on something doesn't mean it's gonna be any good like manny celebrity filled over priced places on the strip. Yes, Giada puts her name on it but the significant difference is everything. Finally, she is there quite frequently to oversee every corner of the operations from the kitchen to her customers. Ya, she actually spends lots of time in the dining area and genuine like your the guest over her house. \n\nSpent some time on this review for sure but it deserves the attention from my perspective..!"

Signature spaghetti was the top of the list, lobster ravioli, risotto, and branzino are my runner ups.  Ended the dinner with the chocolate molten cake. \n\nAwesome dinner, fantastic service by Timothy our waiter, would love to go back and try the new additions to the spring menu.    \n\nThere's even a photo booth to capture these memories."

We had reservations for 9pm (a party of 6) and waited just a few moments to be escorted to our table.  We were sat at a nice table adjacent to the window, and were initially greeted with a smile by Nancy.  She seemed very enthusiastic and eager to please. Upon taking our drink order, she proceeded to explain the menu and we were on our way.  About 30 minutes into our course servings, one of my guests spilled a drink by accident.  When we shared this with Nancy, she brought over a new drink.  However, she did not share much care to see if our guest was ok (some of the drink spilled onto him).  No offer of assistance whatsoever.  From that point forward, she seemed to be more annoyed with our table than supportive, and spent  the majority of her time serving smaller tables adjacent to ours.  When she did stop by, it felt more \"matter of fact\" vs. engaging from a customer service perspective.  Now the supporting wait staff was great, and they were very engaged throughout dinner.  Nancy, however, did not seem to have the same attentiveness I would expect at a restaurant like this, especially being our head server.  Understanding that the tip was preset at 18% for a party of 6 or more, I may have chose less based upon her lever of service.  I hope much of that went to the support staff.......I am not sure I would bring back a party like this again if I cannot get a higher level of service from start to finish.  I have spent a lifetime serving others in the food / beverage and retail industry, I expect better at a 5 star restaurant like this (and you should to).\n\nNow on to the food.\n\nDrinks - Very cool selection of specialty drinks that very tasty!\n\nAppetizers - Bread and salt / sauces were amazing!  You cannot miss with the Salumi e Formaggi platter (simply amazing!)\n\nDinners - probably some of the most AMAZING food I have eaten!  The flavors were to die for, almost did not want desert to spoil the moment.\n\nDeserts - The desert cart had something for everyone.  Again, wonderful flavors!\n\nI would hope that management at Giada look into this to help improve the quality of service offered.  When you spend a small fortune on dinner and an experience, you expect more.  Giada fell short of our expectations this time around.\n\nMaybe they will get another shot at redemption down the road."

Don't be fooled though, despite how small my meal looked when it arrived by the end of the night I was full. Our waiter was very friendly, they bring you a drink menu on an ipad & after your order drinks you get your food menu. Constantly refilling our water glasses & making sure we had everything we needed. A bread platter with different types of bread & spreads is brought out while you wait. I ordered the risotto with crab & scallops & I was in heaven. Perfectly cooked, flavorful & rich. I tried to savor every bite & was sad when I got to my last forkful.

We made reservations for 4 a month in advance and all they had open was a 9:45, which was late, but ok. We got there a few minutes early, but they had no problem seating us. I had no idea that the restaurant had a view of the strip, I was simply going for the food! It was incredible! The table was perfect. we could see the Bellagio fountains from our seats. The windows wide open with a nice breeze. I was so happy! We ordered drinks and apps and everything was great. And then...an hour later I had to flag down our waiter and ask him where our dinner was. He simply said they had to re-make one of our dishes. No, I'm sorry or anything. He told us then it would be up in a few minutes. He never came back around to ask us if we wanted more drinks or anything else. We had to flag him down for everything after appetizers. we finally out our dinners around 11:00pm..an hour and a half after we were seated, and they only brought out 2 of the 4 for the first few minutes! By this time, we were to full and tired for dessert, so I ordered some cookies to go. He then brought us the same cookies ( could have told me that before I ordered) as a Happy Birthday treat to my fianc\u00e9. This service ruined my experience here. I was SO disappointed. Overall, food was decent, but I was probably too tired to enjoy it anyway. I will try this place again strictly for the view and ambiance."

A review was written by Shahn M 8/3/2014; I was actually the person that had the wine glass broken and spilled on...and no I did not work the manager for a free meal although he did comp our drinks.  While waiting for our table my friend ordered a martini with an onion and was informed by the waitress they didn't have any onion, I'm not a martini drinker but isn't that a common condiment for martinis?  After waiting about an hour ( we had reservations) we finally were seated back in a corner and informed the hostess after waiting so long and having wine spilled on us, the least they could do was seat us at a window table, which they did after another 20 min or so wait.  We ordered a small pizza (best part of the dinner) gnocchi, smashed lemon potatoes, filet ( the size and look of an Omaha steak) And I salad I don't recall.  The food was nothing special and portions very small, but the ending to this dining experience gets better.  We went to the bar to have an after diner drink; 1 shot of tequila and 1 glass of port wine...$38.00 and it wasn't the port!  I've experienced Giada's but can't say I will return or recommend."

We ordered the ricotta and honey crostini appetizer, lobster ravioli, penne pasta, two pizzas and two beautiful desserts. I also ordered the barbarella drink. It had a nice non sweet mix of flavors. The restaurant itself is very classy with a vintage Hollywood feel. The staff was great too, our waitress gave us the right amount of attention and our water glasses stayed full (very important to me). The reason I give it three stars is because the portions are ridiculously small. I expect big prices and small portions because... Vegas, but seriously. Go here, but don't go hungry ;)"

She also felt her entree was way too small and unsatisfying, especially for the price tag. Also, my water glass went untilled for a long time and was never refilled.

Depending on the time of day and your seating location you may even take in a view of the Bellagio fountain show. The service was a bit slow and we spent roughly 15 minutes there before anyone came to our table, but our server seemed to have a number of tables so we can certainly understand the delay. We were there for lunch and as this was a special occasion, we brought our own bottle of wine. The corking fee was a bit high (but not for Vegas prices) at $35, but it was still a steal considering that almost every wine on the list was an ultra premium wine. Once we ordered, our food came out exceptionally fast. We highly recommend the baked pasta of the day, the Buratta cheese (buffalo mozzarella), Baby Sweet Peppers and Marinated Olives. Our total dining experience lasted over 1 1/2 hrs. We were so fulfilled by the time we left. In the end, when our check came, we found that the corking fee was not on it. This may have been due to the fact that we bought so many dishes during lunch or maybe our overwhelmed server simply forgot, but we weren't complaining :) \n\nI would highly recommend Giada's for lunch!  All their food is fresh and homemade, which is somewhat rare these days, even on the strip."

The bread basket is wonderful...especially Giada's rosemary bread! We shared, and highly recommend, both the lemon spaghetti and the veal saltimbucca. The combination of flavors in the lemon spaghetti sauce with roasted capers was scrumptious and the prawns are enormous! The veal saltimbucca is the kind of dish I will dream about and crave to taste again! We also shared the salad tre colore, which we also enjoyed.

I found you via yelp and thought that your resturant would be nice and cozy for us for this special occasion. I'm a big fan of you and your cooking style clean,  tasty,  and straightforward.  On top of that,  I loved that your resturant looked like it had the feel of any of the beautiful restaurants we eat back home in Orange County, California.  Not too over the top VEGAS, if you catch my drift.  I mentioned to my good friend that I was considering your place for my boyfriends birthday and she insisted I pay Giada's a visit and recommended I reserve a table by the window. \n\nWe dined at your place last night,  and let me tell you,  it was TO DIE FOR!  We started with a drink at the bar, both of our drinks = delish.  Our bartender was warm and very friendly, he offered us tips on how to get into the new nightclub Omnia, and wished my boyfriend Happy Birthday.  We were promptly seated shortly after getting our drinks,  seated at the window overlooking the Strip!  I couldn't have asked for a better view.  Again the resturant had such an at home feel,  it was perfect.  \n\nOur server, and co-server were wonderful.  They were knowledgeable of the menu and very friendly.  We started with some olives,  a crostini, a pizette,  and the grilled squid.  I HAVE NEVER HAD SQUID SO AMAZING IN MY LIFE!   My boyfriend and I agreed it was the best we have ever had.   Since we really filled up on the shared plates,  we decided to spilt the Shrimp Spaghetti.  It was perfectly creamy and the fried capers added a dynamic yet simple twist to the pasta dish.  We finished the meal with a little DIY Afigato our server made for us, the espresso was rich and the Gelato was sweet, but not too sweet. A perfect finish to a perfect meal.  The waiter that delivered this to us was so charming,  he gave us a little tip for next time we are in Vegas,  and said you are there often and not to be afraid to stop by just to see if you're there!  \n\nGiada - thank you for bringing a fresh feeling to Vegas, I am glad you are here and hope to see more of your resturants opening soon. Preferably somewhere close to home (Orange County, California) so we can be  regulars!  \n\nCiao!\n\nRobby G."

Cocktails, named and inspired after the movies of Giada's grandfather Dino De Laurentiis, are excellent and reasonably priced for the Strip at $15 each. \n\nDon't overlook the first page of the menu -- antipasti and pizzettes -- because there are some gems among them. The lobster arancini starts creamy with a touch of sweetness and finishes with a  spicy kick. Taleggio and an olive tapenade are paired beautifully for a salty hit. The hard pecorino cheese is complimented by the sweetness from apricot preserves. The thin, delicate prosciutto di parma is accompanied by two types of mustard -- one sharp and pungent and another that is slightly sweeter.\n\nBoth pastas we tried showcased Giada's California-Italian hybrid cooking -- pastas that don't have the heaviness of stereotypical Italian food. Well seasoned and creamy risotto was mixed with crab and sat between two beautifully seared scallops. Giada's famed spaghetti can challenge for the best in town. The hints of citrus worked, giving the dish a light and fresh profile.\n\nThere's a dessert cart they roll around, but according to our waiter it's only available to those who order the tasting menu. The rest of us are only presented a menu to choose from. The apple tart is a decent option, with apples prepared three ways, atop a flaky pastry foundation with brown butter frangipane, cinnamon gelato, and gold flakes on top.\n\nThey also have a kids menu available for those that want to bring their little ones. We brought ours and he loved his noodles and had a s'mores gelato ice cream sandwich for dessert. For $11 kid's get their choice of entree and the ice cream sandwich. Quite   aa bargain compared to what other restaurants on the Strip will charge kids.\n\nThe casual elegant atmosphere is perfect for special nights outs or just hanging out with friends in a somewhat upscale environment. Despite the celebrity chef hype, Giada proved to be a surprisingly good restaurant that exceeded expectations and delivered an unforgettable dining experience."

Since Giada doesn't have a restaurant in every major city, I figured that dining here would be as close as I could get.\n\nThe atmosphere is wonderful.  You would think that you would hear a lot of noise from the strip below, but it really doesn't make its way up to the dining room.  The music may be turned up a little to cover this.  Unfortunately, our waiter was soft-spoken and it was a struggle to hear him.  He also seemed really disinterested in talking to us - he explained the menu as briefly as possible and was gone.\n\nWe ordered several appetizers first.  Most of these were decent - nothing spectacular.  The one bright spot was the ricotta crostini.  This was amazing - even for cheese on bread.  What was really disappointing, however, was when the wait-staff removed our appetizer plates without asking us if we were still working on them.  They took food off of the table without asking if we were finished.\n\nThe entree sizes are small.  I guess since we technically ordered pasta dishes and not \"entrees\" we should have expected this.  Everyone at my table had the risotto which they liked well enough.  I had the pappardelle which was also good enough.  I personally think the noodles were too thick and not wide enough  - and a little chewy.\n\nIf the pasta dishes were priced $5-$7 lower these would be above average.  If the dishes were $10 cheaper they would be amazing.  For what they cost, however, they were just ok.  So much hype, not enough follow through.  For the prices she is charging, we should at least get some free cleavage shots like on TV.\n\nI think the thing that amazed me the most about this restaurant is how fast our dishes came out.  The overwhelming impression that I got is that they were trying to turn tables as fast as possible.  Not only are they being greedy by over-charging, but they're double dipping by rushing people through.  For shame, Giada."

We waited while she was talking to another group and when they were finished our hostess told her we would like to take a picture. She was very abrupt and said that she couldn't have people gathering in the front because it was blocking the entrance. Ok, I get it. But it made us feel like we did something wrong when we didn't even ask to take a photo with her, we thought it was part of the grand opening experience. She said she would come by our table instead, but never did despite visiting many other tables around us. The hostess then gave us a little \"tour \" and lead us to our table. Beautiful view of the strip and Bellagio fountains.\n\nWe ordered the Giada and Flash cocktails, both good, but took forever to come from the bar. The waiter even came by multiple times to tell us they were coming. As for the food, we elected for the tasting menu $120. Probably not the best choice. The antipasti was \"Gilda's Favorites\" and they were just ok. The grilled octopus (dietary substitution) was over cooked. We added the chicken Marsala meatballs, but they never came. The lemon spaghetti was by far the best dish of the night. The pea tortellini was excellent as well. My husband had the lamb and loved it, as well as the corn side dish. I had the salmon and it was ok. No different from any other pan seared salmon at most other restaurants in the strip. The smashed potatoes, were not all that \"smashed\", had good flavor. Again just ok.\n\nDessert was excellent. PB&J tiramisu (not really anything like a tiramisu though), chocolate chip cookie (served warm), lemon cookie (tart, but a little too sweet), chocolate cake (rich, but delish), and gelato (coffee was the best!). We were supposed to get a signed copy of the tasting menu, but our server forgot to bring it out. We were on our way home before we realized it and my husband had turn around to go back and get it.\n\nI also had the Barbarella and my husband had a glass of wine. In total over $400 for the two of us, and in my opinion not worth it given the other high quality options on the strip. Wait a few weeks and they'll start serving lunch. I'd bet you'd get many of the best dishes at a fraction of the price. Also they will add breakfast/ brunch around Aug."

Delicious. Everyone was very friendly and the room was beautiful.  The view was awesome. I bet at sunset or evening with the lights of Vegas it is something to behold. There is a photo booth (free) and you can send photos to your facebook or email. Sweet."

You'll only torture yourself.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way, if you're still reading (and hopefully eating soon), you are in for an amazing experience.  We had a few drinks at the bar while we waited to be seated for our 10 p.m. reservation.  That's right. 10 p.m. and we booked that a month and a half out.  This place is popular.  Service was flawless, both at the bar and at our table.  Our dinner was overseen by Joseph Gordon Levitt, aka Gregory. A+!  He knows the menu and flavors like it's his job.  Oh, wait.  Any way, he did a fantastic job of making recommendations and even suggested the order of how our choices should be served.  Truly outstanding server.  \n\nWe started with oysters crudo, oysters rockefeller, Vitello Tonnato crostini, bacon-wrapped dates.  I've been around the block when it comes to bacon-wrapped dates and these were amazing.  I also really loved the oysters crudo.  Probably the only dish I would not reorder was the crostini.\n\nNext we had our pasta course and shared the lemon spaghetti and buscatini.  Both were phenomenal, the sweet and tart of the lemon spaghetti contrasted nicely with the spiciness of the buscatini.  Both were incredible, but I think if I had either as my entire meal, I would not have been satisfied.  Just not a big pasta eater.  Gregory's recommendation to do a pasta course and then a main course was a great one.\n\nFor our main course, we shared the 28 oz ribeye and chicken cacciatore.  The presentation of the chicken was mind-blowing.  The staff presents the whole chicken with its \"fixings\" and then it's returned to the chef to be carved and brought back to your table in all of its glory.  The steak was very well-prepared, well-seasoned and the argula and fried egg were the perfect touches.  I can't even talk about our dessert course.  I was in a coma by that point.\n\nThe dining room is still working out a few kinks.  I am one of those people who believe that if you have a reservation, your ass better be in a chair no later than 5 minutes past and we waited over a half hour past our reservation.  Everything was so wonderful, I can forgive a little tardiness.  This place is a foodie's wet dream.  Love, love, love.  Giada had the night off, so I am cashing in my retirement to return and meet the dynamo behind this mecca."

            "review": "Despite Giada De Laurentiis being on Food Network, I've always admired her as one of the few chefs on that channel who prepare dishes on TV that aren't replicas of something you'd find in the Better Homes & Garden cookbook.\n\nLikewise, her restaurant at The Cromwell on the Las Vegas Strip is not a cookie-cutter \"celebrity chef\" restaurant on the Strip, eschewing the formulaic darker ambiance, and instead embracing lighter colors, ample lighting, and soft wood accents. However, Giada's best design feature is that, unlike other Strip restaurants that you'd actually eat at, Giada has an entrance directly on the street so that you don't need to walk through a casino to get to it.\n\nThe food was very good. Giada De Laurentiis' fingerprints are on the menu, as I recognized most of the entr\u00e9es as being featured recipes on her shows.\n\nThe complimentary bread service was impressive-looking, featuring a focaccia-like bread baked in a ramekin, with accompaniments including garlic puree, mascarpone lemon cream, pepper flakes, fried capers, and pink salt. Anywhere else, this would be ostentatious, but this is a restaurant in a Vegas casino after all.\n\nLobster Arancini was the first plate I ordered, featuring four small fried arancino balls. Do you love creamy risotto? Fried food? Lobster? Parmesan cheese? Great, you'll love this. Served with a pomodoro sauce made of Calabrian chilis that impart a small bit of heat and a slightly fruity taste. Given the diminutive size of the arancino balls, this appetizer was a bit on the expensive side at $19 -- but worth it.\n\nThe Pan Roasted Salmon was another winner. The 7 ounce filet of salmon is mild, wonderfully seasoned, and richly browned on its top, accompanied by a mustard sauce spiked with garlic and thyme. A summer succotash of corn and cannellini beans completes the plate. Again, smaller portions than what you'll generally find out on the Strip. At $39, it is a dish I'd re-order.\n\nI finished my meal with a Chocolate Honey Almond Tart. I've made this myself based on Giada's instruction on Food Network. Here, the preparation and presentation was different, as they don't pulverize the almonds and instead slice them thin and layer them on top of the tart, creating a crunchy texture. \n\nI dined solo at Giada and I was told by the dude who sat me at a half-empty bar at 8pm that they don't serve their dinner menu at the bar, and that I'd need to ask the head bartender for a favor to order anything that wasn't the limited antipasto selection on their iPad bar menu. This was all done and said with a straight face. Once we got past that bullshit, the rest of my experience at Giada was fine.\n\nThere are a plethora of \"celebrity chef\" restaurants in Vegas, and Giada is a worthy entry into a crowded scene. If this restaurant was not tied to Giada De Laurentiis, it would still be successful."

We opted for the tasting dinner so we could try more things. Antipasti was small plate with a few little bites. Family style to share? Bread plate was good with tiny amount of butter and pesto. Then pasta appetizer was lemon spaghetti which was al dente, bland and dry. My husband had fregolotto which was mushy but he ate it. Main course showed up and looked nice. Lamb was good but sides were mushy and unrecognizable too. He had tenderloin with gnocchi and carrots. Not impressive. No waitress in sight ever checked on us. She kept walking by and finally we asked for manager. He was shocked we didn't like our dinner. Really? Dessert was good but save your money."

There were a few standouts, but for the most part the food was just mediocre, especially for the high prices.\n\nThe good (yum!):\n-Bacon wrapped dates ($15) - great appetizer, tons of flavor\n-Tricolore salad ($17) - perfect combination of ingredients\n\nThe bad (mediocre):\n-Charred octopus ($16) - it was okay but I've also had much better\n\nThe ugly (never again!):\n-Pea pesto crostini ($15) - flavorless! The prosciutto was obviously great quality, but the pea spread was not up to par. Thankfully they give you a little tray of crushed red pepper and sea salt, so this helped a bit\n-Whole roast chicken for 2 ($58) - DRY!!! I was blown away at how dry this dish was. It came with a tomato sauce but it would have needed to soak in the sauce all day to reduce the dryness of the meat. \n\nI will say the service was wonderful. I read many reviews that stated the waitstaff was pushy with the drinks and tasting menu, but this wasn't the case at all. The restaurant itself is also beautiful. I absolutely love the decor and the perfect view of the strip. The photo booth in the waiting area is also a nice touch. I won't be back, but I'm still glad I checked this place out."

            "review": "This new place is, indeed, A-OK.\nWith no reservation we decided to check out Giada in the lounge which has a limited menu.  We were told it's first come first serve starting at 5.  We got there just after 5:30 and were greeted by a woman at the base of the escalator.  She took my name and said it would be 20 minutes.  That's okay except there isn't a stick of furniture in that space so you either have to go into the casino or stand around like an unwelcome party crasher.  After 20 minutes she said it would be another 10 (she said I was \"clocked in at 5:42 and it was then 5:58.\"  I said that by my Iphone we had arrived at 5:35. It felt ridiculous to quibble about minutes so I let it go.  A short time later she sent us upstairs where most of the lounge tables had \"reserved\" signs.  So much for first come first serve.\nNow for the good news .....  \nThe room is gorgeous.   The staff is attentive.  Eric, at the bar, was wonderful, informative and solicitous.  \nThey brought the wonderful bread service which I wanted to devour but held back to leave room for other things.\nWe ordered one of the antipasti platters with artichokes, caponata and olives.  Liked it all.  \nWe ordered the vitello tonnato.  It was a tasty enough bite was NOT vitello tonnato.  It is a slice of veal topped with a slice of seared tuna on a crostini.  Couldn't taste the schmear of sauce. Eric explained that everything is \"Giadafied\".  Okay. But don't call it something it's not. I had just watched an episode of Food Network Star where Giada warned a woman not to call something Serrano ham if it isn't.  So, call this dish something else.  I shared my view with Eric and he brought us another dish to try.  Anchovy crostini.  I wouldn't have ordered it myself but it was wonderful!! Like a deconstructed Caesar salad.\nWe also had arrancini and dessert cookies.  Both OK but unexceptional.  I wish they offered pasta at the bar. I would have liked to try one.\nI will certainly go back but I hope they sort out that very unpleasant greeting.  Not a nice way to start the evening."

This was my first time at Giada's and found the restaurant very inviting and pleasant, the view of the strop was magnificent.  The wine dinner was held in one of the private rooms, very comfortable and provided a warm family atmosphere.  The first course consisted of family style platter of several appetizers, a wonderful bacon wrapped date, some tamponade, various olives and several other delectable samples.  The Blanc de Blancs, North Coast 2012 was served with the sample plates--very enjoyable.  The second course was Seared Mediterranean Branzino with Puttanesca Coulis and deconstructed Puttanesca Salad.  This was presented beautifully, the fish had a firm, white, delicate-flavored flesh was roasted and placed atop a delicious Puttanesca Coulis--a wonderful garbanzo bean puree with spices.  Alongside the fish was a simple green salad.  I enjoyed this dish very much, the wine parred was J. Schram, North Coast 2006--this was magnificent with this course.  The third course presented two pasta dishes, Three Cheese Tortellini with Salsa Genovese and family style Rigatoni with Vegetable Bolognese.  The tortellini were delicate and the meat sauce was the Wagyu Short Rib trimmings and provided a great depth to the wonderful dish.  The Rigatoni had a mushroom based sauce which was very good.  The wine parred with this was Pinot Noir, Davies, Nobles Vineyard, Sonoma Coast, 2012 and was fabulous.  The entr\u00e9e presented was a Barolo braised Wagyu Short Rib with Smashed Lemon Potatoes and soft Polenta.  This was extremely delicious, the short rib was very tender, flavorful and almost melted in my mouth.  The polenta and smashed lemon potatoes added a nice balance to the rich meat.  This course was parred with Cabernet Sauvignon, J. Davies, Diamond Mountain, Napa Valley, 2012--and was superb.  The dessert course was a Polenta Cake with Strawberry jam and Mascarpone cream, amazing flavors, simple yet very elegant.  This was parred with Cremant Demi-Sec, Napa Valley, 2011.  The entire dinner and the wines were excellent and I enjoyed the great service, food and wines.  This was a marvelous event."

            "review": "\"eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything\" - Giada De Laurentis\n\nGiada did an excellent job; great location with stunning views of the Bellagio Fountains and the Strip, swanky ambiance, stylish decor, an overall inviting and comfortable dining experience. The effort was extended to the tiniest details of her quotes written on every lampshade hanging from the ceiling - everything was seriously top-notch. The best part of dining at Giada was her complimentary photo-booth; What a beautiful touch: a perfect way to make lasting memories. I give her team 5 stars for making the restaurant shine like her gorgeous brand. Regretfully, I wish the same could have been said for the food.\n\nThe bread-service was decent; I enjoyed the parmesan crisps the most, the freshly baked rosemary bread was warm and fluffy - but extremely oily for my preference and the simple breadsticks weren't touched. The seasoning tray was a welcomed addition to our meal; we used all of the seasonings offered, since most of the dishes needed the extra kick. Yet, my favorite was the crispy fried capers - they were incredibly flavorful and texturally exciting.\n\nMy boyfriend and I kept it sweet and simple and ordered three dishes - crostini, pasta and seafood... Surprisingly; the crostini was the highlight of the entire evening. We were concerned three small dishes wouldn't be enough food for both of us, but we were wrong! We ended up uncomfortably stuffed, so keep that in mind as you order.\n\nUnfortunately, these dishes weren't all memorable. There was only one dish that left us wanting more: \n- Crostini: Pea pesto with prosciutto san Daniele $14 was mouthwateringly delicious, perfectly seasoned, with bright flavor and texture. The pea pesto had a similar flavor profile and texture as smashed avocado and the prosciutto was the freshest. Flavor rating: 5/5\n\nThe other two were only a notch above average. They were well executed, but lacked any real depth of flavor; I mildly tasted some sort of citrus ingredient and plain old salt in both dishes. However, the seasonings and flavor were mostly muted: \n- Seafood: Lobster Arancini with Calabrian chili pomodoro & basil aioli $18 was actually a highly recommended dish from our waitress, so we thought we had a winner. The rice balls were fried very well, light and crispy, however the promise and essence of lobster was nonexistent. The filling was mushy and lacking complexity and the pomodoro sauce was leaning more towards the watery side, lacking bold flavor. The best part of the dish was the bright, inviting flavor of the basil aioli, but there was a minuscule amount offered on the plate. Flavor rating: 2/5\n- Pasta: Risotto with lump crab meat and 2 scallops $30 were enjoyable, but we had some seasoning issues with the overall dish. We enjoyed the expertly cooked scallops and crab meat, both juicy and moist. Yet, while the risotto was under-seasoned, the scallops were aggressively seasoned. In retrospect, I understand now that I needed to eat a bite of risotto with a piece of scallop all together for \"the perfect bite\" however, I failed to do so; therefore the over/under seasoning caused a poor taste for the dish. Flavor rating: 3/5\n\nAlthough I had some issues with two of the dishes, I'm confident that there are more delicious hidden gems offered in her large menu and I would definitely return to Giada to give something else a try."

It was delicious and I highly recommend. \n\nLast night we came for dinner and it was just alright. I would recommend a lunchtime visit instead. I got the beet salad which was beets, a little green and not much else. Hubby got pasta that was again just so so. The best part of the meal was the drink which was a champagne and Campari mix. Not sure how, but I ended up drinking three."

            "review": "Came here with my girlfriend who is a huge Giada fan and had been talking about her new restaurant for months. We started with the marinated calamari that was cool and refreshing in the Las Vegas heat, and the charred octopus that was so tender and made even better by sprinkling the Provided finishing salt over top. We also had to order the salumi with hints of truffle that was also amazing. For the main entree we had the whole roasted chicken cacciatore. It was the Best roasted chicken I've ever had! Perfectly crispy skin yet juicy meat that wasn't over cooked. The seasoning was spot on as well. Every bite was full of flavor! The wait staff and even the managers were attentive and went out of their way to make our dining experience special, which says a lot about Giada's attention to detail. It was such an enjoyable experience that we didn't want to rush. We took over 3 hours savoring every mouthful and will definitely be back!"

We were greeted in a very friendly manner by the hostess who suggested we go to the bar before our complete party arrived. We ordered drinks at the bar- the Hannibal being my favorite as well as the Giada. The manager greeted us and welcomed us to the restaurant - exceptional attention and concern for guests. We were seated at our table and were then greeted by our waiter who had exceptional knowledge of the menu while he walked us through everything and gave recommendations of what to order. Staff is very attentive and brings whatever you need to the table in a very professional manner. We started with the bacon wrapped dates, mushrooms, soup, and a meat plate. Everything was in small portions but absolutely delicious. The main dishes did not disappoint either- lobster ravioli, lemon shrimp pasta ( my favorite) risotto, tortellini, etc were all exceptional. Dessert came on a cart and the waitress explained all the options to us. The cookies, tiramisu, cappuccino and coffee drink with nutella were all completely amazing! If you go here be prepared to know that portions are small and the meal is meant to be in stages like Giada would have at a dinner at her house. The personal touches in the restaurant complete the experience and the open windows give the restaurant an open feel. Overall I loved this place. It is a little pricey but for quality ingredients and service. This is probably the nicest restaurant I have been to and perfect for special occasions. I loved it and hopefully will go back in the future!"

Upon being seated we were greeted by the manager Laurant, and invited to a table which had just come available.  It was a wonderful window table with an amazing view.  We started with two outstanding signature cocktails and four appetizers. Orzo meatballs, marinated olives, a blue cheese plate with pears and honeycomb and a crostini. By the time we were done with the appetizers we had gotten into our bottle of wine which was suggested to us by Darius, the master sommelier. He nailed it.  Next was a kale salad and it was fabulous. Our last dish was a truffle barley pasta. All dishes were genuinely flavorful and delightful.  To finish it all off we had a couple of little desserts and coffee.  Our server Kevin allowed my to enjoy my dishes at my pace. I eat slow and savor my meals. I felt comfortable to enjoy the ambience, my wife, the view, the wine, and the food for all it was worth.  Thanks to all at Giada!"

We visited some old faves, and tried out some new ones -- and this was not one of them. Believe me, I love Giada as much as the next foodie, so I don't take this 2-star review lightly.\n\nTHE GOOD: I loved the decor of the restaurant. It was very Giada-esque. We went for a late lunch, so it was very bright with lots of windows and a great view. You could also see right into the kitchen, which was a nice touch. The table decor was all branded \"Giada\" down to the napkins, place mat and plates. Definitely everything I expected out of her restaurant.\n\nTHE BAD: I hate to say it, but the food was just not Food Network chef worthy. It was actually something I could've made at home. After MUCH deliberation, I chose the fritatta and my mom ordered the carbonara pizza. Even though I wanted the prosciutto on my fritatta, I requested it without it since it was a whopping $5 extra. I was surprised (yet not at all upset) when my meal came out topped with prosciutto. I didn't complain, and luckily the waitress didn't even notice and charged us as if I hadn't had it. Despite not being charged for the prosciutto, the bill was still outrageously priced for what we got. \n\nTHE UGLY: The waitress and service were awful. It seemed promising at first, but then we stopped getting water refills. And then the waitress came to check on us for the first time... after we had finished eating. Had she checked on us before I ate my entire meal, she may have actually noticed the kitchen got my order wrong.\n\nWe walked away disappointed, and questioning whether Giada is really the chef that she and the Food Network claims she is."

I found out the wait list for her restaurant is about 4 months long and saw my hopes of dining there slip away. Come to find out my best friend surprised  me by making reservations months in advance for my birthday and my dreams came true. \n\nWe had 1:45 reservations, we walk up to the hostess at about 1:20 to let her know we were in the vicinity, she made it very clear that she didn't want anything to do with us until our strict 1:45 reservation time. Our time came and I went back to the desk to let her know we're ready, she had our table ready very promptly at 1:45.\n\nThe dining area at first glance is beautiful, pristine white makes everything look sparkling clean. We are seated and In a few moments the waiter is over. He goes over the menu in depth and gives us a moment to decide. \n\nWhen he returns he answers all our questions in great detail and listened to our\nSpecific needs (one of us doesn't eat meat). We ordered the wood roasted mushrooms and chicken orzo meatballs to start. Also ordered two muddled strawberries which is a brilliant concoction of tea,lemonade,strawberries, and basil. All\nOf these dishes were an absolute smash. We order our main dishes which were a frittata and Giada's lasagna. Both of these dishes were great and we had not a single complaint with them. They also bring you a sort of pita bread with a pesto oil spread which is great as well. They have a gentleman of whose job it is to make sure your water is always full which was nice. With it being my birthday we of course ordered dessert which was a tiramisu and a cappuccino of sorts with Nutella. They even wrote \"happy birthday\" in chocolate on my\nPlate. These Desserts really smashed this experience through the roof.\n\nAs we wait for the waiter to bring the bill I see Giada Herself talking to some patrons in the restaurant. My heart of course stops and our waiter personally asked her to come to my table because it was my birthday. She sat and took a picture with me, wished me a happy birthday, made sure our lunch was everything we expected, and said she liked my hair. I died on the inside. The food was awesome, our waiter was a class act, and the Giada was everything I'd hope she be. \n\nThe reasons I gave this four stars ........ The epic waiting list which reaches 4 months\nIs extreme but totally understandable. The portion sizes of these dishes are minimal at best and very pricey. \n\nEveryone should definitely try this restaurant. Not a place to get full but a dynamite venue for a special event. From the food to the staff to Giada herself an absolute smash."

I don't know who Giada is but everybody else did and that's all that matters I suppose. \n\nArt on the walls is cool - I'm told it's mostly stuff related to her grandpa.\n\nWe had reservations, but still had a bit of a wait before being seated so we had some drinks in the lounge area. The menu is on an ipad which is probably not necessary but would be cool if you could order from it or it offered anything a printed menu couldn't.\n\nAfter we were pretty much done with our first round of drinks in the lounge were seated by a big poster of Barbarella and given the rundown of the menu and whatnot. Prices were a bit high but we took this opportunity to not care a ton about cost and just ordered what we thought would be a satisfying amount of food. We all ordered and somewhat shared our food. I had lemon potatoes, charred octopus, and pappardelle pasta. All of it was pretty good and I didn't leave hungry or too full. Food was prepared well and the octopus was one of the better I've had.\n\nWhat I really liked were the drinks. The Destroyer and Serpico were pretttty delicious and not something I could just go order anywhere I don't think. If I'm ever back to Vegas I would go back here solely for the cocktails.\n\nEveryone had a good time, nothing was crappy, all in all a success - just sort of spendy, so know that's what you're getting yourself into here."

We were seated quickly after, given a table with a view and a complementary round of cocktails (thus the higher rating!). The food was excellent and delivered quickly, but then we had a hard time getting the bill - maybe why they're so behind on seating?? Basically a great restaurant with a lot of potential, but they need to rethink their flow a bit. Also, more bartenders!  I was able to observe the poor man while I ordered cocktails for our hour wait. Very polite but totally overworked. (The cocktails are excellent by the way :) Order the G or the barberella)"

The man who served us was so polite and gave us such exceptional service!!! \nOn to the food...\nThey serve you with this complimentary bread which was absolutely delish!! It was a rosemary bread, bread sticks and some kind of cracker with tons of cheese on it. It also was plated beautifully! They give you a plate which had mascarpone butter, sea salt, chili's which compliments the bread! They probably gave us 6 of them! Which we demolished!! Lol we also ordered an antipasta dish. Had 2 kind of cheese, pears, honey, nuts and two types of meat. Absolutely tasty! \nI ordered The Spagehetti, which is one of Giada's signature dish. Lemon, shrimp pasta. This was one of the best dishes I have ever had! So delicious!! It was a little pricey for the portion but that really is how fine dining is!

Both dishes were good. We preferred the spaghetti. That was followed by our main course. She had the salmon, and I had the best rack of lamb I've ever had (Giada wins the throw down with Bobby Flay! I've had his at Mesa Grill as well). The main dish was accompanied with really good cheesy potatoes and fresh broccoli. Lastly we were treated with a wonderful dessert cart.

Not my favorite muffin, but better than the waffle. Also tried a bit of the lemon cookie and chocolate cookie. The lemon cookie was too sweet.

Whether you're paying $1 an ounce for veal or $15 a cocktail you'll be happy. \n\nI highly suggest securing a reservation on your own or with a casino host and ask for a premium table- you will be blown away by the view. \n\nFrom the moment you make your way up the escalator and greeted by a host with a short skirt you feel this is not your ordinary Las Vegas Restaurant. \n\nThere's a photo booth set up but now currently usable but you can still take pics with your own camera. \n\nThe entrance is welcoming as you see the Sous chefs preparing food and next to it the huge bar and lounge area. The dining area itself has a great layout with great samples of art. The decor is simple yet very elegant. With views of Flamingo Avenue and Las Vegas Blvd. \n\nThere are booths in the Al Fresco section and small tables in the other section. \n\nKeep in mind if you want a premium seat you must order at least $100 per person in food and beverage which is easily met with the Taster Menu. You'll get a dessert cart where you can have everything that your sweet tooth desires. Also, you'll get a special personally signed photo menu from Giada. \n\nIf you're looking for huge portions this isn't the place for you but if you're looking for savory flavor, Giada's favorites will definitely surprise you. The salads and appetizers packed so much taste...\n\nThe entrees were again scrumptious! \n\nI want to add that Valentino and his crew were very excellent in terms of providing service. Our drinks were topped off and were asked if we needed anything else about every 10-15 minutes. Plates were cleared etc... \n\nI'm not sure why this place has a few two star reviews... Maybe my wife and I were lucky, we were impressed not disappointed. We will be back again when in Vegas. \n\nIf you haven't had visited Giada - trust me, you must give this place a try. \n\nI no longer believe the saying of \"never trust a skinny chef!\" \n\nGiada, if you read this review...\n\nThank you Giada for putting a great restaurant on the strip.

Both of our filets were burned on one side and was topped by one small ravioli.  Yes, that's correct, one ravioli.  The ravioli was very dry and hard around the edges, where I had to use my knife to cut it.  You would think at $56 dollars (ala carte) you would expect it to be perfect!  I just could figure...The only way to ruin a filet is by over cooking it....They did.\n\nService was okay, I say just okay because our waitress was having trouble with the other wait staff. A little disagreement over using each others menus.  The service staff need a lot more training it seems.  Our small table for two quickly became over crowded. as the dish (extra dish) piled up,  With the raised place mat, bread dish, and glasses, there was little room for anything else.  Hence, once the bread tray arrived, it didn't easily fit on the table.  So picture what it looked like when the bus boy didn't remove empty dishes,  I was forced to start stacking dishes on my table and had to ask to have them removed.  .\n\nThey did bring my wife a very tiny dessert and sparkling wine because it was her birthday.  However, I think it was more that we complained to the manager, who told us we should have told him or the waitress sooner.  \n\nThe interesting thing was that the bill included an Iphone to take a survey on the service we received.  One of the questions was \"Did the manager visit you during your meal?\" Since he didn't show up until after we had received our bill and completed the survey, I said \"no.\"   Funny, after I advised him of the poor quality of food, the manager asked if I had already completed the survey.  The irony was he never offered any way to make up for our poor experience.  My opinion, it was because I had already filled out the survey.\n\nSo, after settling our $200 bill,  we agreed we wouldn't be returning to Giada's on our next trip to Vegas.  Especially since Vegas has plenty of great restaurants to choose from during our four to six visits a year."

The people working last night clearly did not want to be there and their actions spoke loudly. In order to provide great service, one must have great leadership. This place clearly needs better leadership. I would suggest dining somewhere else until they can address their quality of service. We left in the middle of our meal after the appetizers based on the poor quality of service. It's all about the experience and this place lacks luster. One of the front shop girls gave me a card with the name of Greisly Pacton and she is one of the managers that was on duty but not available. I didn't give them a 1 star, I reserved that for food poisoning. They don't even have black or dark napkins for people that have dark clothing. I guess dress attire in not appropriate for dinner?The good news is that Giada is not the only gig in town!!\n\nGreisly Pacton, Assistant General Manager\nPacton@caesars.com\n702.379.1667 \n*phone number on business card that was given to me"

Was so excited to try as Giada food style is perfect to my taste and I was not disappointed in a single thing I ate. Where my experience went wrong is in the human interactions-waiter needs an assistant or more interest as \"Ready to order\" or \"finished\" were about all that I heard-no effort to explore the menu, assist a vegan diner with options-contrary to web site, no offer of a second cocktail, coffee, after dinner drink. No explanation of the dessert cart and how it works-a point out of the items but price? Do you order 1? tasting option? Ipad options were distracting in that they either didn't work well or I'm not tech enough. Commented to waiter about a burning smell and he said \"yeah, its the wood burning in the ovens-I take a shower when I get home and cant get the smell off but need the job\". The  manager types who stopped by seemed self serving and not really interested in hearing \" my wine glass is empty and would order another if someone came by or asked\".  Felt like the \"Experience of dining\" was lessened by what seemed like turning tables-but the food was sublime and the kitchen has its A game. Perhaps the novelty and kinks will work out when people have been there and done that-but more human and less shtick- as part of what drives people to a place like this is the human connection we want to have with the real Giada- as well as the experience of special dining."

Normally, with a super early reservation, comes a lot of expectation which can't be matched. Not so the case here. Read on, friends....\n\nThe decor here is very modern, comfortable and chic, all without being pretentious. The view is outstanding and we were lucky to have what felt like the best table in the house. We were sat in a half moon table which had us all looking out over the strip - incredible views of the bellagio fountains and the \"eiffel tower\". We were treated like royalty by our server, who was exactly the right level of friendly vs giving us enough space to enjoy our meal. \n\nI am English, so I'd never heard of this Giada lady who is some kind of TV/social media celeb, right? I still don't know, and I still don't really care. But what I do know is her food is to die for. And it's worth every penny. We went for a mix of antipasti, kind of tapas style. Of particular note - I loved: lobster arancini, the clams, the truffle pecorini cheese, the dates/bacon thing (forgot the name) and then the gorgonzola salad. We had other things to sample, but those were the ones that really stood out for me (although they were truly all absolutely delicious). \n\nThis is hands down some of the best food I've eaten in the USA. Maybe in the world. As you can tell from this madwoman review, I really loved it. Ok, enough crazy. Review over. You should go, if you're headed to Vegas and looking for a special or celebratory meal. When you make your reservation, be sure to ask for a table with a view."

When we arrived up to the top where the hostess was, it was an odd arrangement.  We saw tshirts folded on the shelves so we weren't sure if it was a clothing shop or a restaurant.  It was an odd setup.\n\nWhile we waited for them to setup our table we took full advantage of the photobooth.  It was out of paper, but we emailed it to ourselves.\n\nThe decor is modern and sleek and dimly lit to be sexy.  The large ring shaped lights hanging from the ceiling reminded me of Lord of the Rings.  They say something like, \"I love to eat a lot of Anything.  I eat a little bit of everything\"  I guess it's her slogan? \n\nService was great and we had a variety of appetizers and the main courses were small enough so we weren't over stuffed when we left.  However for the price and the atmosphere, it's not worth it.  It was the most expensive meal during our stay and we went to several reservation required establishments.  \n\nThe food wasn't memorable."

Some people loved it, others thought it was just alright, A LOT thought it was on the pricey side for Italian food on the strip, so I didn't know what to expect going in. All I knew was that I really enjoy Giada's recipes at home, so I was hoping for the best and expecting to dish out a lot of dough by the time it was over. \n\nWe made reservations on a Monday night - 8:30pm dinner. We arrived a few minutes before and were sat down right on time - despite 1 of the 3 hostess earlier telling us it would be about 10mins. (By the way, before being sat, we popped in the complimentary photo booth that is set up in the waiting area, but I will warn you, the camera is completely out of focus, so your photos WILL be blurry. I guess what can you expect when the photos are free, right?) \n\nWe did not sit next to the window. My boyfriend made the reservations online and wasn't aware that there were \"better\" seats to request, but we were sat at a table still in clear view of the beautiful view Giada's has to offer of the strip and the Bellagio water show. (TIP: request to sit next to window that they usually have open)\n\nThe service was a little slow to begin with. It took maybe around 10mins or so for our waiter to introduce himself, then another 5 to get a drink order in. The drinks didn't show up for a little while longer (longer than you would normally wait) and once our drinks showed up, I was happy. I ordered the \"Flash Gordon\" and the boyfriend got the \"Destroyer.\" Both were bomb diggity. \n\nWe started with a few antipasto dishes, ordering \"Giada's favorites\" which consisted of Bacon-wrapped Dates, Seared Tenderloin Crostini and Baby Stuffed Sweet Peppers. We also ordered the Burrata cheese and the Wood Roasted Mushroom Pizzette to start. All were tasty, but nothing absolutely spectacular. For my entree, I ordered her special shrimp and lemon linguine. The shrimp were huge and the pasta was delightful. But again, nothing spectacular. Dish was simple and something people could easily make at home. \n\nFor dessert, I was pretty full, so I ordered a coffee (which was yummy) Overall, I would give Giada's three and a half stars. Food was good, but for the price and semi-decent service, I'd rather have stayed home and cooked something equivalently delicious, for a third of the price."

Good portion sizes. VMain courses included the petit fillet, the Mediterranean white fish call branzino and mine, mine was the risotto with crab, scallops and asparagus. Perfect. We all split the dessert...thanks Diego for convincing us we should indulge. A dark chocolate amaretto something.

Also, thank you Scott for stopping by to see how are meal was. \n\nEverything was fresh, house made including the pastas, bread and more\n\nRecommendations: make your reservation well in advance. Consider dining earlier in the evening as its a bit more quiet. You could wear casual, but hey, dress up. This is a elegant restaurant. \n\nI will certain be back to enjoy their many choices and a real taste of Italy.\n\nMille grazie!"

We were told at the hostess stand that they were running about 20/25 minutes behind on reservations. Annoying yes, but we could deal. We got 2 glasses of prosecco at the bar and proceeded to wait and wait and wait. We then got 2 more drinks because we were still waiting for our reservation. I checked in with the hostesses twice and each time they just apologized and said our table would be ready soon. Finally at 9:10 we got our table. The hostess asked my husband while we were walking to our table if we were celebrating anything (our reservation had noted that it was my birthday) and he said yes, her birthday pointing at me. The hostess wished him a happy birthday and he said no, its her birthday and she said \"oh\" - and kept walking never wishing me a happy birthday (I was several feet behind them so didn't hear about the conversation until we were at the table). When we got to the table, the hostess simply pointed at our table and left. SHE DIDN'T PULL MY CHAIR OUT or anything. Our waiter appeared 10 minutes later and handed us our menus. He showed us the tasting menu and then disappeared without explaining the rest of the menu, making suggestions or anything. I think we must have gotten a bad waiter or something though because I heard waiters at other tables going to great lengths to explain the menu to their tables. When our food came, they brought us a corn side dish when I had ordered peas. Not a big deal, when I brought it to our waiters attention, he apologized and took back the corn dish. A few minutes later he reappeared with the peas and the same corn dish saying the corn was on the house. It was weird that he took the corn and even weirder that he brought it back - mistakes happen all the time at restaurants like this but the wrong dish is always left at the table since they can't (hopefully won't) serve it to anyone else. Proceed to dessert, which they have a beautiful cart and a very nice gentleman serving it for you. Mid-way through my dessert though, our waiter brought over an empty plate that had \"happy birthday\" written on it and said \"sorry, happy birthday\". Totally awkward. I mean at least put a piece of chocolate or something on the plate, but an empty plate? At least the food was good - not great but good. Orzo meatballs and proscuitto as a starter were good but of equal quality to whole foods. Pasta and risotto dishes were delicious - the only stars of the night. Dessert was ok - raspberry and peanutbutter tiramisu and polenta cake. Overall not impressed."

Took about 30 minutes in between courses being served which is unacceptable. They were not even that busy. I will start of with the signature drink the \" Destroyer\" . This is a tequila and orange juice drink with basil. The appealing part was the ice sphere that was supposed to be in it. It  came with regular cubed ice. I asked about the sphere and they said they had run out. It was 5:30pm. Really? Also the basil leaves were thrown in as an afterthought with no muddling whatsoever to infuse the flavor. Could barely taste the tequila and this was $18. Next was the Crostini with lemon and ricotta. Great flavor, but I swear the 4 little toasts were. 1 inch by 1 1/2 inches , that is shameful. Next was the arugula salad with crispy pancetta. Absolutely zero flavor and I counted 6 crum like pancetta pieces that I had to search for in this salad. So sad. I ordered  the $36 lemon and shrimp spaghetti. Could barely taste the lemon, the pasta was stuck together, and seriously even though the shrimp were a nice size, two of them for this price is pathetic. Last and finally, I ordered the lemon bundt cake which was equal to the size of abut 4 bites. Light lemon flavor and pasty texture. This place is ridiculously expensive for the tiny portions and flavorless food I received. There is no way I would ever go back and I only hope the restaurant takes the apparently consistent reviews of tasteless food and small portions seriously. You can't be successful very long without repeat customers."

            "review": "This place was a huge letdown.  Made a reservation through their front desk hostess and specified Sunday brunch, 11:00.  Based on Giada's website,  which I checked again before going that morning, it reads \"Breakfast and lunch daily 9:00-2:15pm\".  Neither menu posted on their website specified a time differential for each.  We showed up 15 minutes early for the reservation and they made us wait until 11 to be seated, even though less than half the restaurant was full.  When we were seated we were only given a lunch menu.  After 15 minutes of waiting at the table,  I grabbed a passing hostess and asked her for the breakfast menu.  She said they stopped serving breakfast at 11:00  so I asked for our waiter.  He finally showed up 5 minutes later and said he would check with the manager.  She came over and said breakfast was not available after 11:00 so I reminded her of their website menus/times posted and she said she checked with chef and he said there were no more breakfasts left (are they making them in advance?  or they ran out of eggs?  either way it's not so good).  She did apologize and brought us some free Prosecco's.  Our waiter finally appeared a second time to give us some water, 25 minutes after we were seated, so we placed our full order right away as we feared we may never see him again.  The food was just ok and overpriced even for a strip restaurant.  I had to grab a passing busboy for a to-go box and again later to ask for our check because our waiter was NEVER around.  Have to say their service was the worst I've experienced in town."

            "review": "My husband and I enjoyed lunch at Giada on Saturday during our stay at The Cromwell. We would have preferred to eat dinner there, but lunch was our only option because we decided to go to Vegas as a last minute getaway. Even with a lunch reservation, we had to wait over 20 minutes for a table. \n\nService was good, but there is room for improvement. Delicious bread was brought to our table, but we had to wait five minutes for bread plates. We witnessed this same thing happen to another table, but they had ordered several pizzas to share and had to sit there staring at the pizzas until someone brought them plates over five minutes later. This should be an easy fix for Giada. Also, my husband ordered sparkling water and was not given a different glass, so when a different server automatically refilled his water glass with flat water, our server scolded the water person. It was a little awkward, and to fix this, they need to bring a different glass if someone orders sparkling water. \n\nThe restaurant is open and lovely. You notice instantly that they have put great thought into the details of the restaurant. Unfortunately, out table was right next to the server station, so nearly each time a server left this area, I would get bumped in my seat. With so much thought put into every aspect of the restaurant, I am surprised that they have squeezed a table into this area. Hopefully, they will remove this table so diners can enjoy a relaxing dining experience without the irritation of having servers brush up against you or knock into your chair. \n\nThe lunch menu seemed quite limited, offering only one pasta dish, and no meatless pasta option. I really wanted to order pasta, but since this was not an option, we ordered the olives, burrata, the kale mushroom and gorgonzola pizza, the romaine salad, and the lobster roll. Everything was fabulous, but it all had a lot of olive oil. \n\nThe specialty coffee drinks and desserts sounded amazing, but we were pretty full and the restaurant had gotten pretty hot in the direct sunlight, so we decided against it. \n\nNext time we are in Vegas, I will make reservations for dinner far in advance, so we can try a pasta dish and definitely enjoy dessert and coffee. I do not think we would go back for lunch, but I look forward to trying dinner at Giada."

We were seated in the way back, which didn't bother me as it was a little quieter and mellow however it was super hot back there. I asked the server for some air and he said they were working on it. Was still hot throughout the meal...that's why I have it 4 stars. \nThe food is fantastic!!!! I love the tapas menu! We ordered several items from the tapas side as well as homemade pasta. It was so delish!!! The fresh olives are literally the best I've ever had. So fresh the marinade was fantastic! The service was 5 star! If I needed anything someone was there to assist. I loved it. Next time I'd like to sit in the main dining room as the view is fantastic!!!"

If you're a foodie in Vegas, Giada is the place to be right now so I couldn't wait to go there for my wedding anniversary, 8/8. \n\nTo sum it up, our experience was disappointing and way over priced for the style of food. I'm pretty desensitized to my hometown prices and this was still crazy given the service time and quality of food. \n\nHostess was sweet, server was nice but highly sales driven. Both knowledgable about the restaurant but only mehh when it came to the food. Service was extremely slow. Antipasti came out at a good pace, but didn't get our pastas until 2 hours into dinner. Easily the slowest fine dining service I've ever had. \n\nBread was good, but I wish it was served with olive oil or even butter. It's served with cheese, capers and pesto. I have a pine nut allergy and they had no substitution for the pesto. Cool for a $50 per person restaurant, not cool for a $125 per person restaurant. \n\nMeatballs, burrata, crostini antipasti dishes and the salads were fine. Pastas were 4-oz serving sizes, roughly $36 each and very underwhelming. The lemon spaghetti was too sweet for dinner, tasted like a lemon cookie. A little weird. \n\nBought a dessert, which they placed on a \"Happy Anniversary\" plate. Who pays for birthday or anniversary desserts?! It's basically universal for restaurants to bring you a complimentary occasion dessert THEN ask if you'd like to purchase another. Best practices people. \n\nVirtually any Bellagio, Wynn, ARIA, MGM Grand contemporary or fine restaurant KILL Giada when comparing service and food quality. Most 5-star reviewers here must live under a foodie rock, or the namesake of Giada just overpowers their senses. Makes sense as people hate wanting things so badly and admitting disappointment."

One of the reasons I had intentionally not put this restaurant in the \"must try category\" was the less than 4 stars on yelp which are abundant in Vegas. Yet somehow, we found ourselves hungry at lunch and no plan...a bit of an anomaly for an avid foodie/yelper!  Sometimes flying by the seat of the pants is so much better though.\n\nWalked passed Mon Ami Gabi and were both tempted go back as their steak/frites and moules/frites are a safe bet. But time to venture to something new and I remembered that Giada's was just another block up the strip.  As we headed up the escalators in the Cromwell, two ladies were descending and their friend hollered up....\"how was it?\" One called down...\"I had the lobster roll which was fantastic!\"  I looked at my husband and said, \"it's gonna be pricey...but I don't care how much it is...I've been craving a lobster roll and I'm going to order it!\"\n\nSo we sit down in this gorgeous very un-las-vegas-ey style restaurant....meaning bright and open with awesome feng-shui. I was hooked as soon as I melted into a nice comfortable club chair with a good amount of space between tables.  \n \nIn addition to the lobster roll (which was a whopping $37) we ordered the Salumi Picante pizza that totaled only $16.  They were both really beyond fantastic. The salumi was nothing like I've tasted before...a bit spicy but not too oily.  The crust was on the thicker side but light and airy at the same time. Giada knows her pizza!\n\nThe lobster at first looked small...that was deceiving because it was open faced so the entire 1 1/2 inches on top was all lobster. We decided it must have been well over a pound of lobster perfectly dressed in the lightest aioli with fried capers...never would have though of that but it worked well. In fact, this was one of the best lobster rolls I've ever tried.  \n\nThey get knocked one star because wine by the glass is pretty steep so we ended up getting a bottle of French wine on the lower end of the price range...Vouvray Francois Pinon.  Our server immediately informed us that they serve that one by the glass at Spago where he used to work and it is delicious. Ok, that made us feel better about our choice, and much to our surprise, it was the perfect choice....light and not too buttery or oaky.  \n\nThe service was wonderful and even with the steep wine prices I would definitely return."

The manager told me that reservations are pretty much required for dinner but lunch is easier to drop by and eat.  I'm guessing it's because people are sleeping off the prior night's festivities.  \n\nFirst off, the staff is very friendly and attentive.  The tables by the windows have a great view of the strip.  There is a nice lounge area between the tables and the bar.  \n\nThe lunch menu is smaller than the dinner menu, serving antipasti, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches.  Oh yeah, desert too. :-) \n\nStarted off with a glass of red win Sangria.  Very tasty but a little on the expensive side.  First to arrive was very good bread served with an equally tasty pesto.\n\nI had the Wood Roasted Mushrooms for my antipasti.  It was oyster mushrooms with toasted Marcona almonds and ricotta salata.  Very good antipasti.  I really like Marcona Almonds because they are so buttery but I felt the flavor got a little lost in this dish.\n\nNext was the Carbonara pizza.  Basically it was a gourmet Italian breakfast pizza.  It was topped with two fried eggs and prosciutto (I think it was Prosciutto San Daniele), and black pepper.  The dough was not very thick, the prosciutto was flavorful without being too salty, and the yolk running off the sides added to the flavor.  Overall an excellent dish!\n\nI wanted a light desert so I ordered the sorbet and gelato.  My mistake!  It came with a small scoop of each flavor: strawberry sorbet, banana sorbet, chocolate gelato and white chocolate gelato.  The sorbets were light and full of the fruit flavors.  The gelatos were also very flavorful and insanely rich!\n\nThe presentations for lunch were pretty straight forward.  I'm guessing dinners plates come out a little more artistically.  I guess I have to come back for dinner and find out.\n\nSo make a reservation, come to Vegas, and enjoy!"

Seemed like a perfect opportunity.\nThe entrance is inside the Cromwell casino, and up a large staircase adorned with Italian film posters. At the top, we were met by the hostess, who was extremely attractive in a stylish white dress, but a bit cold and humorless. My wife tried to banter on the way to the table, and was met with silence.\nThe room is lovely. It is bright with very clean design. We were given a window table with a marvelous view of the Vegas Strip. I was facing the Bally's sign with a news, sports, and stock market crawl. No need for a morning newspaper.\nUpon being seated, we immediately caught a very strong smell of smoke. It was strong enough to create concern that we were going to leave with our clothes reeking. My wife asked our French waiter if he smelled the smoke. He responded, \"Of course. That is the wood-fired stove\". He gave us a look as though he thought we were stupid.\nCoffee was delicious. Even in the morning, it seemed that each cup was individually french pressed.\nThe breakfast menu contains a lot of non-conventional breakfast fare, although they do offer an \"American Breakfast\", featuring eggs and your choice of bacon or sweet Italian sausage meatballs. One of Giada's signature features is a large antipasto bar. This is open for breakfast. We were offered seats there, but opted for the window table.\nMy wife ordered a Caprese Frittata. It is made with 3 eggs, buffala mozzarella, heirloom tomato and basil. For an extra $5, you can add prosciutto.\nI had Italian Hash, made with potatoes, Nueske bacon, salami, peppers, tomato, and onion. It comes with sunny side up eggs. I asked for poached.\nAll of the food was outstanding - fresh and delicious.\nI also ordered juice. They have an interesting selection, ranging from a green concoction to one with pineapple, apple, and lemon. I opted for pink grapefruit with crushed mint. Delicious, and well worth the $9 price tag (for me, at least). Breakfast was accompanied by crunchy Italian toast and a trio of spreads. I used the Nutella.\nThe tab for 2 came to about $60. If you are staying at any of the many Caesars properties in the vicinity, you can charge to your room.\nSo, in summary, the food was all outstanding. The room was bright and attractive. The help was very efficient but kind of snooty. If you go in the morning when the wood-burning stove is fired up, expect to smell like a fire-fighter when you leave."

We both rated the food 3 stars.  Service from Timothy D was 4 stars.  \n\nNow, back to the food.  We ordered the Crab Dip as an appetizer.  It tasted more like tuna fish.  The more we ate it the more we thought it was Tuna.  It wasn't, but it sure tasted like it.  Overall 3 stars only.  It was $18.  When I pay this much for an appetizer I want something special. This was not.  It also seemed to be greasy. \n\nNext we ordered Lobster Ravioli.  It was properly presented but it was swimming in butter and cream.  Of course we can splurge off our diets but the butter really came through, in an overwhelming way. Cost: $36. I would say this meal is overpriced. It should be in the low $20 dollar range.  Again, not remarkable enough to warrant the cost. \n\nWe will return in time. There are so many better restaurants that we want to try in Vegas first.

We kind of made a big deal of it to them ahead of time  Apparently that worked well enough to get us arguably the best table in the house, a window table overlooking the intersection of Flamingo & Las Vegas Blvd, with a direct view of the Bellagio fountains.  It was mid-summer and for some reason the restaurant was quite cold for our ladies, so we had the restaurant open the window to the warm Las Vegas air, which appeased them.  The great service didn't stop there however, as they brought us out every salad on the menu and only charged us for one of them.  They also brought us out every dessert on the menu as well and again only charged us for one of them.  Between our salads, small bites, entrees and desserts the salads were the most memorable.  Produce was very fresh and never overly complex.\n\nThe second time was with another friend who loves Giada's recipes and without us making a big fuss about it to them, were sat at a window table overlooking LV Blvd. (view of Caesar's).  This was recent so I actually remember every dish we had.\n\nBaby Sweet Peppers with goat cheese & olive tapenade had a great texture of creamy goat cheese with the crunch of the peppers, the sweet/tangy combo was a great opener.\n\nOrzo Meatballs with parmesan pomodoro, with this I was expecting a little more orzo (pasta shaped like rice) texture, although it turned out just to be a really good meatball.  \n\nParmigiano-Reggiano with wild sage honey, Sweet Soppressata with garlic & pepper and Bresaola matched up well, probably my favorite \"dish\" of the night, although a little on the pricey side ($40 total).\n\nLemon wood roasted chicken & creste de gallo soup was a very simple, flavorful \"chicken noodle soup\".  The flavor of the broth transported me back to my youth, when mom would make it on a cold night (which was fitting, since it was hovering around 30\u00b0 outside).\n\nArugula salad with candied lemon, crispy pancetta & parmigiano-reggiano, we had this salad before and it was just as good as the first time.  Even though it's just a few ingredients, all of them have strong flavors.\n\nI ordered the lobster ravioli, with lemon butter emulsion, brussels sprouts & pumkin seed gremolata as my main.  Even though our waiter said this was his favorite pasta dish, I felt the flavor a little lacking in lobster.  Perhaps if they added some lobster sauce in with the lemon butter it would've brought it out a little more.  Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente though.\n\nWhite Cauliflower soup with pickled cauliflower & white chocolate came out last, as we asked our waiter about it during dinner but opted for the chicken soup instead.  We finished up dinner after they were done seating, and the soup was just going to go to waste, so he brought us out a bowl to taste.  The chocolate went well with the nuttiness of the cauliflower, but wasn't overly sweet.  The small bits of picked cauliflower helped cut through its richness.\n\nThis restaurant is great for small or large group special occasions or if it's just you and your significant other.  The service will certainly make you feel like you have been personally invited to eat by Giada herself."

Firstly, we love Giada, were big fans of her on food network, so we thought the restaurant would do their best to represent her in the best way possible. So we made reservations for 10 PM, we tried to move the reservation to an earlier time about 5 different times, and weren't able to however the receptionist said \"you can come in earlier, and if we have a table available we will accommodate your party and seat you earlier\" Thats great. So we got their at 9:30 PM. Checked in, Photo Booth was broken. Waited and Waited. 10:05 comes and now were becoming impatient. We asked the girl at the front how much longer it was going to take she said they were setting up the table. At 10:05 they were setting up the table for a 10 PM reservation. THATS AWESOME. We explained that we are from NY. Us NY'ers do not like to wait. We expect to be seated at the time the reservation was made for. At 10:10 we grew even more impatient. Again, the girl at the front gave us an attitude and said \"they're setting up the table\". Anyways, we finally sat down at 10:15 PM. It took them 15 minutes to set up a table with 5 plates. Got the the table SUPER DISAPPOINTED. They took two random tables from the restaurant pushed them together. Mind you these tables were different heights, and had the five of us sit at these two tables pushed together at two different heights. Im glad it took them 15 minutes to put together this eye sore of a table. It only went downhill from there. Service is terrible, extremely slow. If your patient thats great you'll love this place. I ordered the Farrotto. First of all, this is labeled under \"Pasta\" this is clearly not pasta. Its BUCKWHEAT. unless your Russian and you love eating your kasha in the morning this is not the entree for you. It was undercooked and terrible. My boyfriend ordered the Bucatini. Also a huge disappointment. Overcooked pasta that tasted like Udon noodles. Other than that the Arugula salad was nothing special. The pizza was also nothing out of the ordinary. Ive had better dollar pizza here in NY. Anyways. This isn't really an astonishing Italian restaurant. Were big foodies, and overall the experience was really disappointing. Let's just say I had very high expectations of this restaurant until we sat down. I was also drawn in from the other great experiences people have had."

            "review": "I booked this event for 22 people thru the group sales division. We were offered three choice for a family style price fix dinner, and we went with the top option.  At $125 per head and a minimum of $150 required before tax and tip, we all arrived on 10-5-14 for an experience that topped all others anywhere that I have been.  We were greeted promptly at the top of the escalator, and escorted to 3 tables, all beautifully laid out.  I spoke to the GM, and all the wait staff, to greet and handle the alcohol arrangements.  Everyone was super friendly, and the feast began right on time.  This is no ordinary meal, and it took all of my eating powers to try every one of the 28-30 items we were presented with.\nThe house wines flowed freely, and a few awesome cocktails as well, and every dish they brought was spectacular, starting with fresh breads, and amazing amounts of appetizers.  After catching our breath they set up new serving dishes and proceeded to serve up the lemon spaghetti w/shrimp, lobster ravioli, and some amazing salad.  The dinner entrees were the bone-in rib eye, chicken , and scallops w. risotto, all amazing.\nI requested a nice vegetarian meal for one, and they presented my friend with a beautiful plate of food, which he was very pleased with.\nFor dessert they kept bringing all kinds of wonderful cookies, and other treats, plus each table had fresh sorbet w/ berries, that was made with agave nectar for diabetics like me.  I asked for whipped cream, and they made it fresh for me, which is awesome.  Tremendous service, great food, and great company all for $215per person, including taxes, and tip.  This made sound high to for some reading here, but believe me, not one person complained, as it was an amazing experience.  As a foodie, this was the best ever, so I give it my top rating of all time.  Giada knows how to do first class for sure, so go and enjoy yourself."

Everything was perfect, the food, the service, the view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nFrom the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm welcomes from everyone we encountered. We were visited by management twice throughout our dinner to see how we were doing. Our waiter, Greg, gave us great recommendations and even steered us away from a few menu items. The sommelier visited our table to assist with the wine selection. \n\nStarted with medium-sized Giada favorites antipasti - bacon wrapped dates, stuffed baby bells, veal crostini, pea pesto crostini, and caponata. Even the bread basket was delicious! Main course was the bucatini and the 28 oz bone in Tuscan ribeye. Served with a side of crispy polenta and sweet corn with spicy sausage. For dessert we had the trio of tiramisu. Everything was delicious!\n\nWe ordered a lot of food for two people but wanted to try a bit of as much as we could. It was an amazing experience and we will definitely be dining there again next time we're in Vegas. Ask for a seat by the window to take in the views throughout your meal."

Had to fill out a request form and pay a $100/per person minimum for a window table (new policy). Food presentation was rushed and sloppy (we have ordered the same thing on multiple visits over the last year and know what it should look like...) Server never brought over the drink menu and it took forever to get drinks or wine at the table. Food came out lukewarm and the spaghetti, which was my favorite meal, was too salty and looked gray. The vibe seemed rushed and un-friendly. They boxed up my leftovers and forgot to bring them out, then \"found them\" somewhere in the back and have them to me in a ripped bag?? Sketch. Hopefully it was an off-night, but I felt much more like a customer in the way than a guest who was dropping lots of $$$ for the experience. Better places on the strip, sad for me to say!"

Even the hostesses wore these fancy white dresses. Everything was amazing except our waitress. I wonder if it was because everyone had a Groupon and she was grumpy about it.\n\nWe don't drink, so we asked if we could get another drink besides the free champagne. She said no, we asked her to give our champagne to the table behind us, she said she would, but we never saw her do it. She just seemed annoyed and impatient.\n\nAnyways, you get the idea- now I'm gonna talk about the food. We went here for breakfast. For drinks, I ordered the Dolce Vita, it was sparkly and tasty. My mom ordered one of the juices- it tasted fresh. For my meal I ordered the frittata. It was delicious. It had tons of cheese and fresh tomatoes. Yum! My mom ordered eggs and spinach. The spinach was amazing, it was sauteed perfection! Her meal came with toast, so we got this adorable spice tray (that I want to buy). It had  coarse salt and ground pepper, along with Nutella, lemon butter, and raspberry jam. I tried them all and the lemon butter with jam was my favorite. I wish that we could have gotten a little bread basket since the frittata doesn't come with bread. The frittata is pretty huge and I was having a hard time finishing it- you could definitely share it. We also got a pastry. It was monkey bread made with a croissant and had chocolate in it. It was to die for. I kind of wish I had tried all the pasties for $15 instead of ordering the frittata!\n\nOverall, this restaurant is beautiful, the food it's impeccable, and it feels like Giada could just walk out of the kitchen at any moment.\n\nI took one star off because of the waitress, what a bummer."

As we made our way from the valet to the restaurant we watched multiple groups of drunken women in bathing suits (no cover up) who were \"fresh\" from Drais Day Club looking to grab taxis to somewhere.   Very rowdy women asking if there were any single men available..and not the kind of atmosphere you would wish for.   We then went upstairs to the restaurant and were seated at a table next to the server station.....each time the staff came to get cutlery or plates, they bumped my husband's shoulder.   The cheese/salumi plate was very good, but the chicken meatball appetizer had no flavor and tasted burned.   Husband's veal was not very good.  The wait staff constantly reached over everyone because there was not enough room for them to move around the table to serve us.   They even spilled food on one member of our party twice.  They wait staff took 2+ minutes explaining the $125 tasting menu which comes with an autographed photo of Giada....really?  And her name is inscribed on all the plates which is a bit much.  I wanted to grab my hand sanitizer and clean the ipad menu that was rather dirty and left at the center of our table where food was to be served/eaten.   The d\u00e9cor is nice, but a bit over done...very busy when you look out the windows, and see plenty going on with the strip view.  But, not that bad considering this space was previously the parking garage before the hotel/casino had it's make over.  In general I would say this restaurant is not worth the money or the time."

The photo booth was a fun touch but the only reason we knew there was one was from reading these reviews.  \n\nWhile the view of the Strip is nice if you have a window view, the restaurant itself is rather nondescript.   The service was average, there were long periods of sitting and waiting for the wait staff and then periods when they were very attentive.  However, the bus staff was working non-stop.  They need to pay more attention to the little details.  For a higher end dining establishment I was disappointed to have my $15 cocktail served in an extremely water spotted glass.  The table should be cleaned periodically of crumbs and they need to watch reaching in front of the diner to remove items from the table while they are eating.\n\nThe food was good but over priced for what you get.  We tried the Tasting Menu and afterwards realized it would have been cheaper to buy the items individually.  I think you pay for the recipes and autographed Giada picture as well as the meal.  Our favorite items were the pasta dishes.  Her lemon spaghetti with prawns is delicious.  But be aware that if you try too many of Giada's favorites you may be overwhelmed by lemon as she uses it a lot.\n\nOverall, we were underwhelmed.  We've eaten at high end steak houses that were less expensive.   While we were not blown away by our entire dining experience, we would go back as there are several items on the menu that we would like to try."

We got lucky! We were seated right away in the part of the dining room behind the planters. I actually loved the decor and feeling of this little semi-secluded area. We were greeted right away and then brought menus. It took us a moment to figure out what to do. I knew I wanted the burrata to start. I ordered the famous lemon spaghetti as my entree, my Hubby ordered the chicken cacciatore to share with me, my kids had the grilled cheese and chicken strips from the kids menu. \n\nI know it took a minute for us to order but our server send out everything at one time. So I had burrata, lemon spaghetti, and chicken cacciotore all at once. I expect that from Olive Garden(it's actually happened), not Giada's. The kids grilled cheese was really tasty, the server had the pesto put on the side. \n\nThe food was good, I ate maybe a quarter of the burrata. Do not let your lemon spaghetti get cold. I had to take my kids to the restroom and the food arrived as we were getting up. It still tasted great but had it bern hot it would have rocked! The chicken is ABSOLUTELY worth ordering, it is amazing! The sauce was perfect in acidity without being overwhelming, it had notes of bacon, and plenty of veggies. \n\nI was very unimpressed with service. She had 7 or 8 tables and was basically an order taker in a diner.  She never cleared a plate, mis en placed, or filled a water.

The food and service were excellent so it saddens me to say I would not eat here again .  The smell of the open wood fire grill was terrible.  My husband had watery eyes our entire lunch and begun sneezing towards the end.  When we left our clothes and hair smelled like we had been sitting around a campfire.  We had to go back to our hotel to change and clean up.  I would understand this if w had been sitting close to the kitchen but we were sitting against the windows, far away from the kitchen.  Very disappointed!"

            "review": "Last night I had the good fortune of dining at Giada's restaurant having made a reservation a month in advance through Open Table. During the reservation process, I requested since I was traveling for business and would be dining alone that I be seated with a view of the Bellagio fountain. Arriving early, I perused the waiting area and had fun at her signature selfie booth. Let me begin by saying  that the guest experience was over the top with kudos to Floor Manager Avi and the sever team of Nick and Brandon. Let's start with Avi - being in quality assurance in the food service industry, I observed how he walked the floor prior to the 5:30 seating thanking guests at the bar for choosing the restaurant for their dining and was very sincere with the dialogue that he had with each guest that he came in contact with. We spoke briefly at the bar where I ordered The G cocktail. The biggest surprise was after I was seated for dinner, Avi personally came over and recanted my request on Open Table for a view of the fountain. Well done Avi. \n\nNick, my server and his sidekick Brandon also displayed warmth and made me feel comfortable. Nick skillfully listened to what my taste buds were feeling and after much discussion, I ordered the Orzo meatballs which was composed of veal which I love, the candied lemon arugula salad and the signature lemon spaghetti all of which were spot on!\n\nFood safety was also apparent as I observed a server reload individual cookies on a partial plate on the dessert cart which was being presented to me. The cookies were transferred by sliding them from plate to plate but in doing so this caused them to be arranged not as nicely rather than using tongs which she did not have. My point being - she could have easily used her bare hands to rearrange the cookies but she chose not to in order to avoid accidental cross contamination! Great job!\n\nIn closing, I failed to get the name of the female bar tender who waited on me but she was very professional and she gave no inkling of being upset that I decided to transfer my tab to my dinner bill.\n\nThank you Team Giada's for an outstanding dinng experience!"

Everything I asked for when I made the reservation was accommodated. I asked for a table with a view and that we are celebrating our anniversary. We had a great view of the strip and Lauren sure made our anniversary dinner special. \n\nWe had the Giada and La Strada cocktails ($15 each). The La Strada was really good. We are not huge drinkers so it helped that it was not strong and it was on the sweet/fruity side. I also had a raspberry iced tea ($6, free refills). \n\nThe complimentary bread service was full of variety. It was fun and tasted great. Love the fried capers. The starters we ordered, Orzo Meatballs ($15) and Crab Crostini ($17) were good, not great. I've had better meatballs and crab toast else where. The pasta course however was great. The Spaghetti with Shrimp ($34) was my favorite dish of the night. I have a weakness for fresh made pasta. Flavors popped from the perfectly seasoned al dente pasta. The Crab and Scallop Risotto ($32) was perfectly cooked. I've had my share of poorly cooked risotto so it was refreshing to see they got it right here. The scallops that came with it were not overcooked and it was perfectly seasoned.\n\nFor the main course, we had the Chicken Cacciatore for two ($58). It was basically fried chicken with tomato sauce. I'm glad the sauce comes on the side because the chicken came crispy and had a really flavorful spice rub on it. I actually prefer it without the sauce.\n\nFor dessert I really wanted the souffle but the kitchen didn't want to make it since it was close to closing. This was really the only thing that kept our night from being perfect. We ended up getting the Lambic Float ($18) which wasn't very good. Lauren did send out some cookies with Happy Anniversary written on the plate which was really nice of her to cap our night off."

Greg and Valentino with their boyish good looks really complimented Bryan's style of service. Felt like the Rat Pack was back in town and serving at Giada. Avi the manager also stopped by and was incredibly welcoming. Other than that the room was beautiful. And in case you're intoxicated by the service and forget where you're at, Giada's name is everywhere to help remind you. Food was ok not going to blow anyone away. Definitely a house wive sanctuary.

Although the view is nothing to get excited about you can people watch from the window seats.  \n\nWe made reservations for a Thursday brunch and gauging by how empty the place was I don't think they were needed.  We tried the Orzo meatball appetizer which was 5 small meatballs in a delightful sauce.  The meatballs were moist and tender with good chew and flavor $15.  For our entree's we ordered the Carbonara pizza, cheese bacon and quail eggs on a flakey crust $18.  The pizza was not large but had good flavor.  I felt it would have been better with pancetta instead of the large pieces of bacon but overall it was good.  We also ordered the gnocchi which were served in the same sauce as the meatballs $17.  The coffee was disappointing as I was expecting a rich strong brew but got a mild cup of joe $6.\n\nOverall nothing stood out at Giada's which was disappointing since we love her on the Food Network.  All of the food was good but there was nothing that would bring us back.  In addition since prices are on the higher side it would be nice to have some complimentary bread or fruit with your meal.  I know this is petty but a place shooting for upscale should make the patrons feel indulged and I felt like this place was cutting corners."

I had made reservations in advance for 11 am on a Sunday morning and was told that it would be breakfast time when i arrived. Not wanting to waste any time i looked up in advanced what i had wanted to order online. My friend & I ended up arriving 30 mins late due to the rain and having a very hard time finding the parking structure to the Cromwell hotel. Needless to say, we didn't make breakfast & it was already lunch time when we had arrived. We had to take the long way thru the flamingo hotel, and it was a bit of a pain in the ass.\n\nAnyways! We were seated right away and i loved how cute the hostesses dresses were. it was very \"giada\" like. The service was def up to par, the managers checked up on us three times asking if we needed anything and if the entrees were delicious. Our server was very knowledgeable and very patient with us, while we decided what to order. We didn't order her recommendations but what we got were delicious! The complimentary flat bread and pesto was AMAZING. So fresh & delicious. I ordered the Arugula salad with pancetta, candied lemon peels, and freshly shaved Parmesan cheese. I thru on an order of the shrimp and got two HUGE shrimps. the salad was one of the best salads i have ever had. It was very simple but tasted SO good. I do think however, it needed some kind of crunch.. maybe some walnuts or pecans perhaps. I also ordered a vanilla tea which was also good but was rather on the cold side. my friend ordered a pepperoni pizza which she enjoyed but it wasn't necessarily amazing... I wasn't really feeling the decor on the inside but the outside of the restaurant looked nice. Towards the end when we got our bill... it was around 50 dollars, which i thought to be pretty cheap.. but then again i paid 22 dollars for salad.. Lol.\n\nAll in all I will be back in August to try dinner!! (:"

This restaurant is beautiful inside and the attention to detail is evident in every aspect of the meal including the bread selection and awesome cocktails.\n\nWe had the tasting menu for $120 each.  This included a take home menu, recipes, and signed picture of Giada. The following is included in the tasting menu: a small plate of antipasti (my only complaint is that it was too small), a pasta course, main course and then a free shot at the dessert cart.  My party made full use of the dessert cart and tried many of the offerings.  The dessert cart guys were very cool and encouraged us to try as much as we wanted.  The cart had a huge selection of 4 ice cream, 4-5 cookies, a few tarts, 3 parfaits, and 3 cakes plus a few things I am probably forgetting.  We got about 10 items off the cart and the highlights were the peanut butter and jelly parfait, peanut butter and chocolate cookie, and lemon ricotta cookie.\n\nI am going on and on about the dessert, but the pasta and salmon we had was also very good.  I really want to go back and I hope they open for lunch soon!\n\nThe highlight of the night was that Giada was there!  She was very gracious and stopped for a moment so we could take pictures with her on her way out to catch a plane.  It is good to see that she is very involved in the success of the restaurant over a month after they opened.  It definitely shows in the quality of the food."

Finally got a drink ordered and they came for our seating before it came. Wouldn't put it on our dinner tab so had to wait to close out the bar check. Our waiter was not very attentive and his accent was so thick we couldn't understand him. The roar from the street didn't help. Loud motorcycles and fire trucks. They finally closed the windows and that helped a little. The prices were steep, even for Vegas. $30 for a 4 oz. pasta course that the waiter made sure to tell us should not be our main course. Starters and pasta came out in a reasonable time frame but waiting almost an hour for the entree is unacceptable. When we asked, the waiter was gone 10 minutes only to return and say our entrees were being plated and would be there in \"one minute\". After about ten minutes we were about to leave when the food arrived. Never an explanation or apology. Water glasses were frequently empty. Waiter never checked on us. We always had to flag him down. It was almost like the waiter was upset we didn't order more when our tab for 4 was $400 before gratuity.  Even so, it appeared to be a management issue because other guests were being treated similarly.  Such a disappointment."

When we arrived the restaurant the ambiance was beautiful. The photo booth was a great touch and the staff was amazing. However, that's all it was. To start my husband ordered pasta fagioli soup and I had a arugula salad. The salad was good and a nice size portion, however the soup portion was a disgrace. I understand the concept of small plating but I don't even think there was a ladle of soup in his bowl. A bowl of soup is not something you order to share and in my honest opinion I think they should be embarrassed by the portion of soup they serve. For our entrees my husband ordered the Filet and I had the salmon. He ordered a side of lemon potato's and I had a side of crispy polenta. My husband said his filet was very good and the sides were very good as well. My salmon was very bland. On to dessert.... They come around with a cart and you choose off of the cart what you would like. I ordered a blackberry, lemon tiramisu and my husband got a strawberry tart. Again very small portions for the prices and nothing special. I also ordered a nutella espresso. It was supposed to be two shots of espresso, nutella, hazelnuts and whipped cream. This barley consisted of espresso and I'm a little perplexed how they passed this off as a drink because all it had was nutella, whip cream and a DROP of espresso. $250 later this meal wasn't as good as any of the other restaurants we went too during our stay. In fact it was on the bottom of the spectrum. Lavo's food was way better and Tao's salmon blew the salmon I had at Giada's out of the water. I think this restaurant is going to be a one hit wonder for a lot of people. Giada fans will try it but likely not return. Its a lot like a pretty woman, dressed to the nine and a face full of make up with no personality... Pretty to look at, but no substance. I don't know about everyone else, but I go to a restaurant for good food, not just a pretty room. The next day there was nothing memorable about this meal or food."

I consider myself a big foodie and I have to say that the food/recipes just didn't work at all and the dishes that were \"good\" were just ok... We had no less than 12 dishes and they all kinda suck. I think that it's really hard to mess up italian food if you are a chef but I guess it can be done after all.\n\nAnother thing that was really disappointing was the overwhelming menu. Like I said, I'm a well-versed diner and that menu was waaaaaay too much. Took me and my friend,  who is also well-versed in dining out, about 30 minutes to oder. And we ended up going with a lot of their signature dishes/recommendations from the waitress and it wasn't good.\n\nAnd for my last comment, the service was \"too good\" if you can call it that.

I would have given it 5 stars based on the food alone, because it was very good but the drinks were extremely overpriced without much to do -even for Vegas (again expected.) Overall a very nice experience, great views of the strip as well!!"

            "review": "As huge fans of Giada, we decided to try her restaurant ...\n\nTL;DR - someone has licensed her name, photos, recipes, but I highly doubt she has any personal involvement in the running or quality of this place especially considering 1 in 3 reviews are 2 stars or below. This would explain why a famous chef has a restaurant not at a major hotel. Look at Jose Andreas, Wolfgang Puck, Julian Serrano, Emeril, etc .. all at major hotels. Pretty easy to put two and two together on this one. This is just a \"tourist trap\".\n\nHere goes ...\n\nWaiter - he was in a huge hurry. Only 2 out of the 5 of us were ready with our drinks, he insisted on putting them in. They arrived, then he was MIA for awhile, put in the rest in, by the time the 2nd set of drinks arrived, the first ones had been slowly diluting for at least 15 minutes. There was no reason to rush. On a Saturday night there were more staff than patrons.\n\nThe tasting menu has some recipes etc. If no one at your table orders it, they take it away even if you want to read it. We ended up asking another waiter if we could see it again.\n\nFood - a pizzette and a 7oz ($65) filet that was ordered, arrived COLD (so far below room temperature you have to wonder if both these items came out of the fridge and someone forgot to warm them up?).\n\nI had the Veal Chop and although it was tasting, it was most likely fried in a very low quality/cheap oil because two days later, I still have some serious bloating.\n\nNoise - Maybe the loudest \"fine dining\" restaurant I've ever been to. The restaurant was maybe 50% full and it was so loud, we couldn't hear each other at our own table.\n\nFor the \"$$$\" rating for this restaurant, it is not worth it. We had dinner the night before at Lago at the Bellagio and had one of the best meals we've ever had in Vegas.\n\nSorry Giada! You sold out your good name to someone who is ruining it. The reviews speak for themselves."

While the surroundings are quite stunning and well thought out, it was a little disturbing that cookbooks and other various items were being hawked at the entrance.  While tastefully done, it is still retail.  The waiter was attentive and nice early on, but then seemed to lose interest in our table.  Not sure of the cause, as we had 2 bottles of wine, appetizers, main courses and dessert.  Thankfully, the dessert cart attendant and water attendant made up in attention what our waiter lacked.\n\nWhile we all agreed that we would highly recommend the spaghetti with shrimp, the bacon wrapped dates (yum!) and the mushroom Gorgonzola flatbread, my experience with my entree fell flat.  I had ordered the farrotto, which at the time had morel mushrooms as the starring ingredient.  I literally had 2 mushrooms and the farro was completely tasteless.  Not once after we received our food did our waiter come ask us how it tasted.  It was only after all of my friends had finished their meals (mine was still there, with only 2 bites gone) that our waiter came back.  He failed to notice my (uneaten) meal and it was only when my friend pointed out that I was disappointed in my meal did we get a half hearted apology.  \n\nWe will pass on Giada next time we're there."

This was a great idea BTW.\nAfter more than 15 minutes, my husband had to ask about our table as we were not called back. At that point, one of the hostesses whom we spoke originally that was standing there the entire time realized that we were waiting, so she called us up, and we followed her into the restaurant. The place was packed. We were seated by the windows, which were opened (not so good idea). We seat down, after adjusting our table as we could not freely fit into the space. The amount of space allowed for those double tables was limited, and taken by larger individuals on either side. We both tall & skinny, but had to come up with own solution seating down. When we walked in, we liked the decor, and we had good feelings; however after seating down, we were not given any menu, and we were left alone. No one has showed up for about 15 minutes, and at that point brought us cocktails & wine list. Cocktails are $15.00 & small. Wine prices (per glass) range from $18.00 and up (large glasses, but very little wine). Wine prices per bottle very high!\n\nComplimentary selection of breads (2 kinds only with extra condiment) very good & delicious, but arrived 30 minutes after first table encounter. We had to ask for them. Seeing white jacket service, high prices, but no white clothes tables made me feel like something was not right. Table service seemed overwhelmed, and forgetful. We had to focus to understand our waiter. He was nice, but in wrong profession. We had no connection with any of the staff; they came & went away; almost felt like everyone was under pressure, doing their jobs but without any good execution. Fellow, who operated desert cart, was the only one that was having fun while working.\n\n Planning on having a romantic dinner and/or conversations? Giada restaurant is not the place due to very high level of noise. The combination of outside & inside noise was unbearable & left me with a headache. It was hard to seat through. \n\nDesert options very limited and not so exceeding. My tiramisu was not what I have expected, and was extremely sweet. I enjoyed my specialty orange coffee though, but had to wait for them to make it. \n\nArtichoke soup, Lobster raviolis, and Risotto were excellent. I will give 5 stars!  \n\nService experience needs serious improvement, and needs to smile in my opinion. Overall experience low, and one time experience only at this point."

            "review": "I visited Giada at the newly renovated Cromwell for the first time a couple of days ago, and I'm left confused about how to describe this place, but here are the first ten words that come to mind:\n\nDelicious.\nComplicated.\nBeautiful.\nUnique.\nAnnoying.\nSurprising.\nPretentious.\nWell-intentioned.\nPricy.\nEnjoyable.\n\nIs this list schizophrenic? That might be appropriate, because dining here is a wildly multi-sensory, potentially annoying, but delicious experience.\n\nFOOD\nFor me, a restaurant is about many things but primarily the food. In this area, Giada is superb. The complicated menus -- plural -- are large, but once we got through them every single bite was delicious. Nothing was merely average. Everything was scrumptious.\n\nMy table of four ordered enough for a small country -- in part based on a dubious suggestion from our server that the dishes are intentionally small; I'm familiar with small-plates concepts, so we followed his lead and ordered the following from two of the three menus to share. From the sampler menu, which is presented via iPad with sampler \"packages\", we ordered the option with bacon wrapped dates, a pea pesto crostini, calimari, stuffed baby sweet peppers, mushrooms, and potentially several other things I can't remember. Everything was stellar. I suggest you wear a diaper, because the bacon-wrapped dates may make you wet yourself.\n\nFrom the main printed menu, we shared a wild mushroom pizette, spaghetti with lemon and shrimp, risotto with crab and scallops, branzino with tangerine vinaigrette, veal saltimbocca, and lemon potatoes.\n\nFirst, all of the above were crazy delicious. I would taste something and think, \"This is the best.\" Then I tasted the next item and thought, \"Oh, this is the best.\" And so on. In the end, the veal saltimbocca was probably the standout for me.\n\nSecond, I would not classify these as small plates. I'm a fatty, and I would have been satisfied with one pasta OR one main, not the pasta AND main as suggested. We over ordered, which drove the bill up.  I can't help but think the servers are simply trained to sell, sell, sell. It's a smart business move -- just perhaps not in the best interest of the patron. My suggestion if you go to Giada: by all means over order to sample everything if money isn't an issue, because it is delicious. However, do not feel you need to. You'll be satisfied with one pasta or one main if you share a couple appetizers.\n\nCommon threads through everything we tasted were lemon...and complication. For example, we ordered iced tea -- and even that's complicated. It's brewed at your table for one cup, so no refills. At Giada, if you order x, they'll do x, but it's a production to do x.\n\n(By the way, the three variety bread course served was yummy and is served with an option of wonderful spreads.)\n\nMENUS\nI've already mentioned two of the menus we received. The third menu was the tasting menu with no price listed. We asked: it was $110 per person. For that you receive pre-selected favorite items, an autographed picture of Giada de Laurentiis, and the recipes for the items you ate, in a souvenir folder.\n\nReally? I understand that Giada is a celebrity chef. I personally find her delightful, but the autographed picture offer seemed like a narcissistic gimmick. Her food speaks for itself. (And eloquently.)\n\nWe did not order dessert, but the dessert tray is huge -- literally. There were about 20 to choose from on a behemoth cart.\n\nSERVICE\nThis was my biggest issue at Giada. Everyone was well-intentioned and friendly but overly trained and zealous -- so much so that my party felt it oppressive. Throughout the dining room, servers stood at attention as if in the military, waiting to \"help\" but actually hovering. They wanted to engage after every dish for feedback, and it was just a bit much. The restaurant is new, so perhaps management will tame this with time.\n\nATMOSPHERE\nWhere to begin? The restaurant is beautiful, and again, complicated. I counted about eight different seating styles/chairs/lounges/table types/environments on various levels. The art is colorful and plentiful, and the lighting is fun and fascinating. One would think throwing all of this together would be bombastic. In a way it is, but it also works. The windows open for a wonderful, open air feel -- complete with noisy traffic and strip noise (which I found charming) and incredible view of the Bellagio water show. If you're a small party, request a seat near the open air windows.\n\nThere's also a photo booth near check-in. This is a playful, very nice touch. Your seating hostess will also offer you a tour before you're seated if interested. She was hard to hear among the noise, but it's another unique touch.\n\nNUTSHELL\nDespite the high price tag, I would have rated Giada 5 stars had it not been for the borderline-intrusive service. Go...but bring your wallet. Bring your appetite. And bring your patience. You'll need all to fully enjoy the delicious schizophrenia."

We anticipated a multi-course gourmet experience and price tags around 150-200 per person. This is not something we can afford to do often, so once or twice a year, we decide to treat ourselves.\n\nStarting with the host staff, they were high school aged girls, dressed for a club in slutty dresses, with ZERO apparent training in hosting. They were clueless of anything other than shoving cattle down the chute. The restaurant was hot, loud (pop music blasting so we had to raise our voices to speak), and we waited 5 minutes for our server to show up. She was overly pretentious, pretty much just for the sake of being pretentious. Keep in mind, we have dined in several white table cloth, sommelier hiring, jacket and tie requiring establishments, and understand fine dining. This was not fine dining, but some strange pseudo-fine dining treatment. The iPad for cocktails was filthy, the counter next to our table was covered in crumbs, and all the wait staff looked disheveled. None of their uniforms had seen an iron or bleach in quite sometime. After a few minutes, we just walked out. This is not a fine-dining experience, so if you want a pleasant evening with special treatment by a professional staff, this is not for you."

She's really the only chef/FN star I've followed and  made many recipes from, so naturally was eagerly anticipating her restaurant opening. \n\nFirst visit was one year ago (party of 2).  We were seated at bar even though we had reservations.  No problem.  Ordered a signature cocktail which was delicious and was seated a short time later.  The waitress explained the menu a bit and suggested we order \"at least 3 or more plates\", as we were thoroughly made aware each dish was for 1-2 people.  I had caught a glimpse of the dessert cart upon arrival and wanted to be sure to save room for some.  But since the waitress was insistent we order said number of plates, we obliged.  The food was good, however, as expected, I was near full and decided to pass on dessert.  Oh well, next time!\n\nSecond visit:  party of 6.  My daughter wanted to go for her bday, since she heard I'd enjoyed it the first time.  I made reservations (forgetting to request a window view, darn) and tried to recall the menu to accommodate for 3x as many people.  Entire party were family members, already knowing their palate and also knowing none of us were 'starving' and it being a later dinner (8pm) - I figured we'd order more plates than on my first visit and all would be 'okay'.  Wrong!  When our waiter arrived I immediately informed him I'd dined before but the rest of my party had not, and if he could refresh my memory and/or make suggestions.  He began to rattle off so much stuff, saying something about the menu changing from my previous visit... and now dessert was only offered with the....who knows what he said...basically he ended on the mention of their...I'll call it 'prix-fixe menu'.  At $120 a head!\nUhhh...I was unprepared.  And now, totally confused!  As previously mentioned, none of us in the party were that hungry, especially for some of the items he'd mentioned....like lamb (yuck).  And since I was picking up the tab, I also wasn't prepared for that heft of a bill.  To make a long story short, he walked away, leaving us to quickly decide what we wanted.  It was obvious he was expecting that we go with his suggestion above and instead, we ordered  what WE wanted to eat - several appetizers, a couple salads and pasta dishes.  He seemed annoyed with us, saying it wouldn't be enough food, shrugged his shoulders several times and pretty much set the tone for the rest of our meal (can you say 'awkward'?) \n\nI guess it wasn't obvious on my first visit that they really try to SELL each and every dish and drink at Giada's.  After this second visit, not sure I'll return.  The food is good, don't get me wrong, but unless $$$$ (and yes, you should really change that to 4 instead of 3) is no object to spend for a larger party, I suggest trying it as a party of 2 (if you're a really big fan and must fulfill your bucket list). Oh, and for my daughter's bday, they brought out a large platter with 'Happy Birthday' written in chocolate (3/4 of the plate) with 2 small cookies on the remaining quarter.  It was too embarrasing to take a photo of, so we didn't :/"

It is unpretentious and warm.  I found myself transfixed by the halo light fixtures.\n\nThe female staff needs a lesson on how to speak in their \"grown-up\" voices...I was scolded by a woman-child for bringing my seltzer-water (purchased at the bar downstairs moments earlier) into the restaurant.  Fine point, but the delivery was needlessly condescending in advance of the $600 our party was about to spend on dinner.  #tiredofbabytalkokay?\n\nI am not fan of iPads at the table... there's something decidedly unappealing about touching something that thousands of slot-machine fingers have perused and then joining hands in the communal bread basket that violates what little I know about food safety and sanitation.   Were the 6 of us to pretend that the iPad is sterile?  Or perhaps ritual hand washing en masse?\n\nThe Antipasti course is how, we are to believe, Giada eats at home:  a little bit of everything but not too much of any one thing.  Our group shared two types of meatballs, a teeny  pizza, octopus, stuffed peppers and goat cheese crostini.  Each was delightful, if ordinary but for the octopus which I dreamt about.\n\nMy BF and I shared the table-side chicken, or as I like to call it, Giada's Bait and Switch.  The ideas is that this is a small roasted chicken brought table-side and then the chicken is returned to the kitchen for carving and the vegetables are made into a family recipe cacciatore sauce.  What came to the table initially looked luscious and fresh before it was whisked away by our server.  What came BACK to the table were bits of fried chicken parts, drizzled in a red sauce that was made at 11:00 that morning.  It was too expensive to be funny.  Amusing maybe...\n\nDessert is also served table-side from a cart an idea that sounds better than the execution- temperatures of the desserts are uneven depending on how long they've been on the cart.  The lemon cookie was perfect.  Peanut Butter Tiramisu was fun but at room temperature, the texture was off.\n\nCoffee service should be more efficeint- they are oddly out of their depth on something that should be rote."

It took the bar wait staff 10 min to acknowledge we were there, another 10 for a server to come to say she'd bring bar menus & clean up the table. So after menus arrived & we had a chance to give it a quick glance, our drink order did not get put in until about 30 min after arrival. About 40 min after arrival, the hostess came back to take us to our table, so we let her know our drinks hadn't arrived & requested to have them sent to our table. She told us she needed to check since they usually close the bar tab before seating. After checking & coming back seeming inconvenienced, she took us to our table & left us there saying our server would be right with us. No food/drink menus were left with us or water offered. Strike 1! It took another 15 min for the server to arrive who introduced himself & said he'd bring our drinks from the bar when they were ready. He was turning to walk away when one of us quickly stopped him to request that water & menus be brought to the table on his return since he did not offer water or ask if we needed anything before turning away. Strike 2!\n\nThis basically set the tone for the rest of the meal. There were huge periods in between water, drinks, or food courses where our server was nowhere in sight & other staff zoomed by us without a second glance. At some point a full drink was accidentally tipped over. We could not get any staff to assist in a timely manner (the 3 or 4 staff who passed by did not attempt to stop to help & just said they'd get our waiter), so we used our own table napkins to clean up the spill off the floor. When our waiter finally came around, he seemed indifferent about the spill since we had already wiped it up, didn't offer a replacement drink nor did he offer to bring new table napkins to replace the ones balled up on the floor. Strike 3!\n\nSide note on the food, it was good but not truly memorable. I had the crab & scallop risotto, which I enjoyed but did not blow me away. The pizzettes seemed to be enjoyed by those who ordered them as well as the spaghetti dish. They did bring a birthday cookie plate for our friend who had a  bday coming up & the glazed lemon cookie was probably the most memorable item of the night. Yummy!\n\nAll in all, with all the other fine dining options on the Vegas strip I don't see myself returning based on the service alone. So sad since I love watching Giada's shows. \n\nQuick tip: hit up the free photo booth at the entrance - one of the only high points of the evening."

I booked online 3 weeks out and could only get dinner for 2 at 5:15PM.\n\nIt was totally worth it.\n\nThe pasta in the lobster ravioli was perfect - thin, not rubbery. There was no shortage of lobster, and sauce was light, fresh, and didn't overwhelm. It was very well put together. Cocktails were tasty. Service was attentive but not over the top. The view is great and it was nice to have some of the windows open.\n\nAbout the only thing not very well thought out was the photo booth off of the lobby. 2 people can't fit into the seat and you can't reach the screen to operate it. It's a nice idea, but it doesn't quite work. Once you get into the restaurant, everything else clicks. It's worth booking early and eating here."

We sat on the sofas in the hostess area. Beware!! You make think the sofas are comfy, but don't just plop your butt down like I did. It's pretty hard! \n\nWe saw a photo booth on the right side! It didn't print pictures that night or you couldn't email it to yourself. But you were able to take a photo in the photo booth and take a picture of the photo with your cell phone. \n\nWhen we got seated, we had an excellent view of the strip! We sat along the window which made our night! People watching while we enjoyed a nice dinner-what a treat!\n\nWe started off with a bottle of moscato. It was sweet and delicious! Then we ordered the mushroom pizzette, white lasagna, and calamari.\n\nThe complimentary bread was so good! Best bread I've tasted! It tasted like it just came out of the oven! \n\nThe mushroom pizza was delicious and had a nice crunchy crust!\n\nThe white lasagna was light and very flavorful.\n\nThe calamari and shrimp was perfect! It had the perfect crunch as well and the shrimp was HUGE!!! \n\nWe also ordered a dessert. Shoot!! I forgot what it's called, but I have a photo of it! So if anyone knows what it is, please leave a comment!\n\nThis place only got 4 stars because we had empty plates on our table when we got our entree and we asked the food runner if he can take the side plates off our table, but he just walked away and acted like it wasn't his job. \n\nBut other than that, we had a nice experience!! They even gave my husband 2 of Giada's favorite cookies for his birthday! His real birthday was the day before and celebrated it at Gordon Ramsey steakhouse, but they didn't do anything nice to make my husband feel special on his day!"

The romaine salad had the BEST dressing I have had in literally years(along with fried capers). Pizzette the perfect size, artichoke soup nice and light, lobster ravioli delicious & 28 ounce rib-eye just gorgeous. The bread assortment was yum - the 4 year old asked for seconds. Our team of service individuals were so kind - considering the 4 year old was being a tad of a handful. We cannot wait to go back! Also - the manager Avi was an absolute gem and truly genuine. LOVE THIS PLACE. Yes, I yelled that. Go there you will not be disappointed."

We were given misinformation about where the restaurant was and took the wrong set of elevators up.  We found a manager on the floor who told us that happens to guests all the time.   \nMy husband and I arrived at the front desk and were made to wait for 15 minutes with a half empty restaurant.  Since he was on oxygen, I thought this was inexcusable.  While waiting I walked over to look at the assortment of olives etc. in the display and noticed the bread platters set up for service.  Almost all the dishes were cracked and looked like dishes that should have all been rejected for service.  \nWe were seated and enjoyed the Dry Cured Basque Salume, and Parmigiano-Reggiano appetizers.  Our server highly recommended the signature Spaghetti with shrimp, lemon and basil.  When it arrived it was under cooked, not hot and did not have the slightest taste of lemon.  We were very disappointed.  \nOverall I would not recommend the restaurant but gave it two stars because we had a server who did a good job.  He did remove the cost of the spaghetti from our bill.  \nThey need to get back in there and take a good look at what is going on.  It needs serious help."

I had the bucatini which for those of you who don't like spice, I'd recommend going a different route. While delicious, the spice was a bit much for me. The cauliflower side was out of this world! Fianc\u00e9 had another pasta dish that was flavorful and in my opinion the best I've ever had! Nathan sent out a round of moscato to congratulate my fianc\u00e9 and I as we had just got engaged which was such a nice touch and much appreciated. We cannot wait to back again. We ended the night with the apple tart and chocolate cake! Was so pleased with the experience!"

I made reservations for a party of 3 at 9:30pm. We arrived at about 9:20 and were told we should be seated shortly. About 5 minutes after we arrived, a party of 4 arrived. I heard the man tell the hostess he had reservations for 10pm. The hostess told him he could not be seated until closer to his reservation time. He asked if there was anything she could do and gave her CASH (I physically saw him hand it to her and her open up a drawer and put it inside). She then escorted him and the rest of his party to a table for 4 in the dining area. Mind you, this was 9:30pm. CLEARLY she gave him MY table. We were not seated until about 9:45pm. I was LIVID. The waiter was fine, a bit slow. We ordered some appetizers and some pasta dishes. My brothers were not impressed, they thought it was underwhelming and the portion sizes are very small. One brother ordered the tortellini and literally was given 8! The highlight: my dinner - spaghetti and shrimp. IT WAS DELICIOUS! ALMOST made me forget about the disappointment at the hostess stand. All in all, the food was good but overpriced. And even though it's Vegas, I would never allow my restaurant to be run that way. Giada and management should be ashamed and that hostess should be fired."

The place was practically empty but we were told that our reservation would be honored at the appointed time and we could wait in the bar. OK, fine. We went to the bar where the bartender was warm, helpful and effusive. Soon after getting our wonderful mimosas were were called to our table. \n\nThe space is comfortable and gorgeous, made significantly less so by the too loud, completely un-brunch appropriate rock and roll music. Are we in a fine dining establishment or an Abercrombie and Fitch store??? I politely mentioned the situation to our server. She said other people have complained but there was nothing she could do. Wow. \n\nWe started with the gorgonzola dolce and burrata. Both were incredible and generously portioned. I also had a latte which was gorgeous and delicious.Two of us ordered the lobster hash, the other a frittata. The hash had potatoes, lobster, peppers, bacon and other things. It was good, but also kinda wet, not crispy like I had assumed it would be. The eggs on top were fine. The toast was served dry. When I asked for butter (really, you have to ask???) they brought little dishes of butter, nuttela and jam, all were yummy. \n\nGood service and some great and not so great things. I'd like to try it again for dinner."

Room was desolate and wide open, had requested a special table near the strip and was surprisingly seated in the interior..... Seemed \"weird\".  Asked our server if we could move to the plush booths that have a great view and were we had sat on our last visit..... Denied!  Waiter who seemed a little miffed said \" they were not seating any booths and we could move to a smaller table near the window.  We accepted but once again .... \"Weird\"!  Not 30 seconds later they seated a party of two in the booths near us..... Once again \"weird\" now bordering on \"strange\".  \nBut I digress..... The meatballs (cool in temp), eggs over easy and smashed potatoes were very good not quite exceptional.  The smashed potatoes seemed a touch off as if the had been reheated but had a nice lemony essence which saved them.\nOverall I'd say Giada's is in trouble..... Pretty sure it's Giada's in name only because if she owned it she wouldn't accept the level of service..... In the end I'm disappointed I really thought Giada's was going to be special after my first visit...... Unfortunately the restaurant appears to be in a tailspin and I don't see any signs  of effort by the slightly pompous staff to fend off the inevitable..... I'm giving you 9 months tops until a major overhaul.... The room has potential !\n\nYou'll never solve a problem until you own it.... Time to step up!"

We sent the hyped up $60 chicken entree for two back because it was over cooked, dry as a bone, and no flavor. KFC OR Popeyes would have been way better.  They suggested the tomahawk pork as a replacement. It was thin, fatty and tough. They paired it with $36 lobster ravioli that was undercooked.  We had come expecting and looking forward to greatness instead we left our special anniversary dinner $250 lighter in the wallet and feeling ripped off.  The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 is that our server Tim was professional and apologetic about the kitchen's failures.  I honestly think Giada and Gordon Ramsey should become friends. And we absolutely love Giada. She's always been my favorite celebrity chef.  But can't help but feel she would be embarrassed if she had been there tonight."

The mushrooms were very flavorful, but they were expensive for the size of the portion.\n\nThe eggplant fries were terrible - they just tasted like oil, we sent them back and were talked into trying the goat cheese stuffed peppers.  They were also not good, the peppers had no flavor and the goat cheese just leaked out of them (the cheese also had no flavor).\n\nWe ordered the parpadelle and bucatini for our pasta course.  These were the highlights of the meal - past was cooked very well and my bucatini had a great sauce.\n\nFrom there you are encouraged to order an entree, but we were full (and slightly underwhelmed by the appetizers and so decided to move straight to dessert).\n\nMy favorite dessert ever is tiramisu and given this was an Italian restaurant - and I had seen tiramisu on the menu online, I was ready to order that.\n\nSadly tiramisu was not on the dessert menu and so rather than try something else we got our check and left.\n\nI really think that anyone could make food that tasted as good as the dishes we had & when I go to a \"celebrity\" restaurant and pay that kind of money I want something that in no way could I attempt to create at home.\n\nFor the prices charged I was very disappointed; the \"debate\" about transferring charges from the bar to our table also left a bad taste.\n\nIf I could I would give this place 2.5 stars, as you can't & 2 stars would be very harsh I am stuck with giving it a 3 star review.

It being on the Las Vegas Strip and a bit more pricey, I was expecting TOP NOTCH service!  Didn't really get the best customer service.  Our waiter seemed like we were a nuisance to be served right from the start!  I mean, we didn't even look at the food menu, he asked what we wanted to drink and I said tap water and from then on, the experience went downhill.  I was a bit insulted....I don't go to a restaurant like Giadas to drink....I go to EAT the food she makes!  \n\nWell after we looked at the menu, asked our questions we had on how certain dishes were prepared, I began to order.  I ordered two appetizers and a main entree for myself and my friend ordered an appetizer and main entree.  When we were done, I saw that the expression on our waiter was more attentive, seeing that we were spending our money on food instead of the alcohol.  But really?  One should not base their service on how much a customer is willing to spend, but that's how I felt we were being treated. \n\nAnother thing was the waiter that served us was terrible in explaining how dishes were prepared.  I ordered the Lobster arancino after asking how it was prepared.  The waiter did not state it was \"deep fried\" and instead said \"pan-fried\" now there's a difference between the two....well let's just say, the fried rice balls were MUCH better at Macaroni Grill.  \n\nI was however, thoroughly impressed with the Lemon Spaghetti, Giada's signature dish.  Now if it wasn't for that this, I would be giving it 0-1 stars....but because of the lemon spaghetti, I may actually decide to go there again JUST for that one dish. \n\nForget about dessert, it just sits out on a car in the restaurant UNCOVERED, becoming dried up in the LOW HUMIDITY of Las Vegas....terrible idea!  What they should do is have a cart for decor purposes only, and use only that, have the customer's order and prepare it fresh in the back kitchen.  I mean cmon, for the price you're paying, customers should at least get some freshly made desserts to end their meal!  \n\nWell that's my rant...and I RARELY give negative reviews....just did not have a good experience here."

This restaurant was pricier than what I am used to, so I was expecting a bunch of super small portions, and I honestly thought I would walk out still hungry; but the server gave us tips on how to order, and although the portions were very small, at the end we were stuffed. My favorites were the mozarella appetizer and the lobster ravioli. The chocolate tart was way too chocolatey, but the cookies were so soft and flavorful. We also had a bottle of German wine, I can't remember the name, but it was so good, and I am not a wine drinker. I will definitely eat here again."

The hostess at another restaurant suggested to make one when I asked her about it. She said her friend was a hostess there and it does get busy. We arrived and had to get the attention of the four ladies standing behind the podium. I requested a table with a view of the strip. The service wasn't that great. We sat there for 10 minutes without anyone coming over to us. My boyfriend finally asked the two gentlemen behind us about the whereabouts of the server. The gentlemen apologized and asked us what we wanted to drink. After several minutes later, the server arrived. We had plenty of time to review the menu and were ready to order. I ordered the risotto with crab and scallops. My boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli. For dessert, we ordered the fruit tart which was apple. The olive oil on the bread plate was one of the best I have tasted. If you're looking for a family style large Italian meal, this is definitely not the place for you. The entr\u00e9e portion sizes are small. My entr\u00e9e came with two scallops and not a lot of crab risotto. And, my boyfriend's entr\u00e9e had eight ravioli. So, if you are intending to share your meal this is not the place for you. Overall, the food was good, although the portion sizes are not worth the price you pay. And, nice milieu with a view of the strip."

This was the 2nd time that I dined at Giada's and the service has very much declined since it first opened.  We arrived 45 minutes before our scheduled reservation to have drinks in the bar area.  The drinks were good (blue velvet and prosecco), but our waitress spilled my entire glass of water on me.  After that, she avoided us like the plague.  For the next 1.5 hours until they actually seated us (they were 45 minutes past our reservation), I sat in a cold and wet dress with no drinks (she never came back to check on us or refill my water).  She literally would pass by us even though we tried to get her attention multiple times.  When we finally sat down our waiter hardly spoke English.  He kept looking around and barely would answer our questions for the menu.  After taking our order, he didn't return to check on us until dessert.  Again, he just stood there and couldn't really answer our questions about dessert.  Since I had been there before, I knew the lemon cookies were the best so we ordered the cookie plate again.  I've liked Giada for years.  I watch her cooking shows on a regular basis and own many of her cookbooks and I was very disappointed in this second visit.  I hope service improves for future customers and they do not have to sit through a whole dinner in cold, wet clothes."

Her eponymous restaurant juts out over the Las Vegas Strip more prominently than her cleavage juts out of my HDTV whenever the boob tube is tuned to the Food Network.  (See what I did there?  \"Boob tube\"!)\n\nAnyways, now that I got my requisite joke about Giada's cleavage out of the way, I can finally talk about my brunch!  It was pretty great, actually.\n\nI was joined by a few friends at Giada on a Sunday morning.  The place is right off the casino at The Cromwell, with a dramatic escalator entrance that takes you up to the hostess stand, which doubles as a gift shop selling mountains of Giada-related paraphernalia.  (Like I said, Giada isn't subtle.)\n\nWe were quickly whisked into the dining room, which was gorgeous and has a stunning panorama of the Strip.  Lots of light and cozy furniture make you want to sit back and relax for a while.  Pretty much everything from the napkins to the dishes is a shrine to Giada -- her name and image are ubiquitous.  Some might find this tacky, but, it was just tasteful enough that didn't bother me too much.\n\nBrunch started with drinks.  My friends had mimosas but I decided to forgo the booze and had a cappuccino instead.  \n\nNext, we shared an assortment of breakfast pastries.  They were fine, but nothing in particular impressed me.  The donut-like pastry was dry.  I think my expectations might've been too high.\n\nThe real star of brunch was the salmon cake benedict, which was totally fabulous.  It was served with wilted spinach, piquillo peppers, poached eggs, prosecco hollandaise, and two thick slices of toast.  I don't think I'd ever had prosecco hollandaise before, and it was a light and delicious alternative to a heavy, run-of-the-mill hollandaise.  The salmon cakes were fresh and juicy, too.\n\nI also enjoyed the assortment of spreads and sauces (including Nutella!) that came with the toast.  That was a unique touch.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my brunch at Giada.  I look forward to my next brunch here -- almost as much as I look forward to seeing her cleavage bursting through my television set."

I asked for better seating and was told by the hostess that I should've asked for a better table when I made my reservation.  Yes, I guess I should've known when I made a reservation at a restaurant that was going to cost me hundreds of dollars that I needed to request not to be seated in the dungeon. A place that people go on vacation and couldn't possibly know there was a chance I'd be seated in the restaurant's prison section.  We did wait to get a better table that was basically in the \"hallway\" between the dungeon and the main eating area which was to a degree an upgrade.  But you would think they would relegate that room to walk-ins and not people who made reservation and dressed the part.  The food is worth going, the wait staff was great, you can guess how I feel about the hostesses, but if you do go REQUEST A GOOD TABLE or you might be quarantined."

I am only bringing this up because it seemed as if her designated job was to serve the wine, and if so, she should be familiar with the vineyards/wineries pronunciation.  \n\nIf given stars on the service and antipasti- would definitely be a 4.

Portions are kindof small but bold in flavor! They also have windows that open up and giving you a view of the strip (at the same time sitting indoor giving u an illusion of outdoor sitting) nice attentive staff and great food! Prices are a little high but worth it."

The staff was well trained for the soft opening, the kitchen executed beautifully and Giada was in the house to see everything was up to par. It did not disappoint!\n\nCocktails are well thought out and the Hannibal was a crowd favorite. We sipped on those while we gazed over the huge selection of anti-pasta items. It's a bit overwhelming to choose, because they all sound delicious, but eventually we decided the table would share the dates ($14), burrata ($12), orzo meatballs ($13), rollatini ($12) lobster arancini ($18), salami and cheese platter. Bite after bite was utterly delicious. However, the dates stood out as a favorite, like most these were sweet and salty, but what set them apart was the spice from the Italian sausage. They had some serious kick, which I loved. The aged parmesan from the platter was dreamy, as well.\n\nNext, we shared a variety of pastas: Giada's signature spaghetti ($28), tortellini ($26), ravioli ($34), and farrotto ($26). The spaghetti's simplicity really shines with a touch of lemon, basil and three jumbo shrimp. The ravioli was delicate and filled with wonderful flavors from the lobster, asparagus, and tarragon. The farrotto had a wonderfully chewy texture and earthy flavor from the morel mushrooms and distinct richness from the pecorino, we really enjoyed it. The manager brought over an order of risotto ($30) for comparison. It too was delicious, it oozed with bold seafood flavors from the crab and scallops. You cannot go wrong.\n\nWe had already enjoyed a feast, but the main course was still to come. We had the veal chop saltimbocca ($43), rack of lamb ($45), and Tuscan ribeye ($68). The veal chop and the ribeye were straight from the Flintstones. These were extremely large portions even for the heartiest of appetites. Every bit of it was stellar. The lemon potatoes were the perfect accompaniment. They are smashed and fried and topped with cheese.  Meat and potatoes never tasted so good.\n\nDessert selections were chosen for us. There was a trio of gelatos, the espresso and chocolate really stood out. The banana was the least favorite. Then, there were assorted cookies, tart and other pastries. To cap it off they served a scrumptious nutella espresso that was simply sinful.\n\nThe dining room is gorgeous. You can spot Giada's special touches all over. The retractable windows are impressive though it got a bit warm when they were open. The photobooth is fun and sets the mood for the playful evening that lies ahead."

This was the best 2 hours of my life. \n\nIn talking with Cliff, he knew how excited I was to just be there, and on our way out he provided us giadas favorite cookies to go AND a signed copy of the menu.

Now, if you know me then you will know that I am a huge Giada fan. She is the chef I receive the most inspiration from for my cooking and it is her cookbooks that I turn to first when looking for guidance or a new recipe to try. I have even had the honor of meeting her at a book signing once - yes, she is that beautiful and yes, she is incredibly kind.\n\nThis love of Giada is shared by my amazing mother, Janet. We love to watch her shows on Food Network, make her recipes together, and most importantly - eat her recipes together! After Giada opened her Las Vegas restaurant at the Cromwell in the summer of 2014, my mom always said that if she could dine anywhere, she would love to try Giada Vegas.\n\nAugust 18th is my mother's birthday, and this year her birthday was one of special significance for a multitude of reasons. I wanted to do something out of the ordinary to celebrate her on this important birthday, so I surprised her with a trip to Las Vegas, a stay at Caesar's Palace, and dinner reservations at Giada. I didn't tell her where we were dining until right before dinner, and I loved seeing her face light up when I told her that we were going to finally try her top dining destination. Her birthday dinner could not have been better as our dining experience was one of the best either of us has ever had. Giada is a true treasure of restaurant. \n\nTo summarize, dining at Giada in Las Vegas was a fantastic experience that I will always remember. It was the perfect place to celebrate my mom on this birthday of importance. The warm and inviting atmosphere, the unrivaled service, and the heavenly dishes made our time at Giada a smile-invoking and memorable experience. \"Experience\" - this is an important word here because that is what Giada Vegas provides; it's more than a nice a meal and a view, it is full dining event that is as pleasing to the eyes, ears, and spirit as it is to the tongue and the stomach.  I recommend Giada to anyone in Las Vegas that is looking for spectacular food and a wonderful time. Thank you to Giada and staff for such a treat of an evening! \n\nFor more, visit my blog post: https://johnnylapasta.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/giada-vegas-restaurant-review/\n\nBut know that Giada is the place for you!"

I had made reservations with a special request of a window table six weeks in advance.  I had been wanting to try Giada's restaurant since it opened and on our previous Las Vegas trip we were unable to get reservations.  When we showed up to our 7:30 reservation we were asked to wait for over 15 minutes, when the host did finally seat us at our table she did not apologize for the wait.  Furthermore, after waiting it was not a window seat facing the Bellagio Fountains like I had requested.  Instead we were cramped into a two person table pushed in the corner.  I kindly said that this was not what I was expecting and she said that they were no window tables available and did not know how long it would be for one.  I didn't want to make a scene so I sat down. Now, with all the choices of restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from I would think that Giada's being a new restaurant, one year old, would have spot on customer service.\n\nOn to the food, we ordered the PEI mussels which were light and a perfect starter to share along with the bread basket.  Next we ordered the arugula salad, I would try a different salad next time as the arugula was lacking in flavor but the pancetta made up for it.  Now on to the star of the meal, Tuscan Rib-Eye with a sunny side egg.  This was a 28 oz bone-in Rib-eye cooked to a perfect medium-rare, the sunny side egg was an added touch that I truly enjoyed.  The food was light yet full in flavor.  I simply which that the hospitality side of it was equal to the food.  Las Vegas has many other restaurants to choose from with the best in service and food.  I am not sure if I will be back to dine at Giada's again."

I guess the restaurant just recently started serving lunch and so service was\na little off in that there was quite a lag and confusion with the seating, and our server during the start of the meal was quite confused as he was bringing our food to the wrong table twice! But all was well since our main waiter and his other 'assistant' were pretty attentive. Our main waiter also gave us very good descriptions of the menu items and excellent recommendations for cocktails and entrees. The food was nothing short of excellent!\n We started out with orzo meatballs, the caponata along with the complimentary focaccia with the side of pesto for our antipasti. They were all well prepared with each dish having the right balance of seasonings. I had the lobster roll with the lemon aioli topped with fried capers and a side of arugula salad. The lobster meat was moist and crisp, cooked just right and the lemon aioli with the fried capers rounded out the flavor of the seafood. My friends ordered the tenderloin sliders and the Venetian turkey panino; and although I didn't try their dishes they both had good things to say about the dishes. It was served with a side of zucchini 'scapecce', which was a dish made out of very thin strips (strings, if you will) of zucchini which was deep fried to perfection and very well seasoned. \nI would have given this restaurant a perfect 5 stars, if it weren't for the service which\nprobably could improve in time with just a bit more organization."

I got the Bucatini pasta cooked perfectly & the sauce was SPECTACULAR!! The portion sizes were perfect!! The creative cocktail list is interesting & my husband got a basil drink that was OUTSTANDING! They knew from the OpenTable reservation that it was our anniversary and brought out two different cookies on a dish with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate sauce. We ordered the Orange mocha flavored coffee to go with it,& it was an AMAZING and CREATIVE twist on how coffee should always be served! We will definitely be going back!! \nThe bill came & was totally more than reasonable for the high quality of food & service we received. \nGIADA- if you read this -PLEASE OPEN A RESTAURANT IN LOS ANGELES!!!!"

So of course, I'd want to try the recipes at her restaurant. \n\nFirstly, we came here for Valentine's Day because we're nuts. I made reservations a month in advance. We only did this because we were going to a concert on the strip. And I was told I was allowed to pick any place I wanted to eat. :|\n\nSo, we get there super late. 20 minutes later than our reservation and I was blown away that they still took us. First star. \n\nSecond star: The decor and view is excellent. It's very warm and contemporary. I love the seating and the light fixtures. Even the music was excellent. It's perfect jazzy. \n\nThird star: our waiter was a complete weirdo and loved to make horrid jokes. But, he was very attentive and brought out our food in a timely manner. \n\nThird star: The food was excellent. I will say this, it was a bit salty on a lot of the dishes. We ordered the Valentine's Day special prefix meal. It was a TON of food for $125 a person for a 4 course meal. Some things that we had:\nLobster Ravioli. Very good. The pasta was homemade and the lobster inside was small, but it was tasty.\nTruffle and prosciutto bacon risotto. This was excellent. The prosciutto bacon was super SUPER salty, but it's hard for me because I love salt. I just try to not eat so much of it. The truffle seemed baked and hardly had the taste or smell of truffle. BUT, the risotto was awesome. It's a recipe that I've made myself. \nBacon wrapped scallops: Perfection. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the bacon around it had a very full flavor. \nLamb: The lamb was the best thing of the night. Which, I already ate so much that it was hard to finish. But, the lamb was so tender that it melted in your mouth. Served with whipped grits to top off the flavor. \n\nOverall, this place was very good. BUT, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the pricing was a bit much. Yes, I get that it's on the strip. Yes, I get that it's quality food. But, $20 for a tequila cocktail is nuts. Just for two of us, we spent over $400. I know I can get this type/quality of food or better off the strip for half of the price if not more. I just hate that being on the strip really takes advantage of that. I would love to come back here, but I do not want to pay those prices."

Starting with the good:\nThere is a very tasteful photo booth in the waiting area.  Big hit withy my kids.\nThe staff is very well trained and extremely open.  They explained all the dishes and showed us around, offered DVD player for the kids and plain were extremely well trained.  Huge kudos for them.\nWe'll laid out space and decor - pink but not overly so.\nNow for the bad.\nThe food!  Every dish we got except for complementary bread was nothing to write home about.  I always had a suspicion that all the food network chefs in an attempt to outdo each other long forgot that they are cooking food that people would like rather than showcase usually a random or very pricey list of ingredients.  I watched Giada a few times and had the feeling that she's basically adding \"extra sugar to Pepsi\".  IE nothing is really wrong - but what she does kills the taste of any of the underlying ingredients.  Which is exactly what we got for our meal.  I always thought that beauty of Italian food was the freshness and the taste you get with a few very basic ingredients - flour, salt, egg, and water.  And then eggplant, sweet peppers and, say, oregano.  What I got in my baked pasta - was a vat of melted cheese with something resembling about 1/2\" of flat pasta and a few chunks of somewhat undercooked eggplant.  Really?  Good thing Giada still did not discover truffles!  Tuna sandwich was just that - chunks of tuna with a bunch of stuff.  My daughter's pizzette looked good, but she said that the pizza I make at home is better (right!).  And chicken fingers for my son?  My wife and I looked at each other with \"...there is something we are misunderstanding here...\" expression.\nWe read dessert descriptions - sounded like all the expensive sweet ingredients piled together and decided to pass.\nIn any case - Giada never promised to cook Italian, and nobody dragged us to the restaurant.  So it's our fault for choosing incorrectly.\nBut once again - wait staff carried the day - the best trained people I've ever seen."

Apparently there is a Giada's restaurant in Henderson, NV (no relationship).   The restaurant ambiance is light, white and bright! We had reservations at 5 pm last Sunday before our show so it was a great time to enjoy light traffic in the restaurant.  We loved the appetizers: orzo meatballs, burrata cheese and a few other items! yum!  Of course, we tried the lemon spaghetti with shrimp which was like everyone suggested GREAT!  Then the finale of the desserts tray came by- yum! The nipples of venus were little truffle balls and we also shared a fruit tiramasu which was tasty. Enjoy a great time and experience! The nice touch was that the manager came by our table for a personal introduction which you don't see much anymore.  Last note, the max for wine corkage is two bottles per table."

The place was half empty and they couldn't seat us for over an hour. We sat on the benches in what looks like is part of the bar, hoping we could get an appetizer to pass the time, but they won't serve food there, even though it's a mere 5' from the bar. After we're finally seated, we learn they are out of 1 of the 2 pasta dishes they have on the menu. It's lunch, how does that happen? I ask for the muffuletta sandwich, they are out of that too.  Living in Las Vegas, I've gotten used to most celebrity chef restaurants providing great service and great food. The food was okay but there is no room for the \"take it or leave it attitude towards patrons\", especially on the strip. I'm sure the name will keep it open for awhile, but that won't last forever. Great TV show however."

My party of four went on a Saturday evening  in mid-May 2016.  \nThe food was very bland and so tasteless!  I usually don't care about the price of food, I enjoy good food!  But I felt so cheated by my experience. \nI literally could not eat any of the entree!  The waitress sent the Maitre D over and I told him my veal chop was not a quality piece of meat and that it was very bland and tasteless.   He said that's the way it should taste \"it's a taste preference\"!  I said \"what taste\"!\nGiada do you know what the food is like!  I can't imagine you do?  We paid $500 and ordered a lot of food but not one dish was edible!  Shame on you!!"

It definitely feels like Giada had a vision for this restaurant and had a large hand in making it extremely beautiful to look at. \n\nOn to the bad. Small portions. Everyday food, nothing special, exorbitant cocktail prices...I could go on. Service was pretentious. Our group was half from NYC and half from SF, so we know good food and service.\n\nI agree with other reviewers that my favorite thing was the orzo meatballs. They were flavorful and moist. We ordered many of the other items and they were mediocre- pizzas, panino, tenderloin sliders, lobster roll, baked pasta etc.,none worth the price.\n\nThe kicker was that it was my 30th birthday. Our group had a large bill well over $1,000. As my gratis birthday dessert they brought over their 6 cookie plate... For 10 people! Would it have broken Giada's bank to scrounge for one more plate of cookies. If someone decides to spend their birthday and their paycheck with you, show a little love. That is all."

I love Giada and looked forward to dinner especially since the restaurant is upstairs away from the casino and prided super views. My husband and I booked early, requested a window seat but couldn't get a reservation till 9:45 a little late for us but took it with pleasure.   We are frequent Vegas visitors and always enjoy quality restaurants - so many excellent choices in town. We were told it was a $100. 00 minimum check for the window which was fine because the prices are high. A lovely room lots of windows and a view of the traffic!  We ordered salmon for my husband and rack of lamb for me with a broccoli side to share. Oh, just water to drink.  Then the manager began hovering over us imcomfortably as time passed. He asked if everything was OK before any thing was served,  then the nice bread selection came followed immediately by dinner. Timing was rather off and the veg side was cold. So the manager whisked it off and brought another cold side!  Tried again and finally got hot  veg.  The salmon was tasty and nicely cooked as was the lamb, but we had to ask for our water to be filled.  The manager  insisted we order dessert  ($100.00 minimum). So we ordered Lemon souffl\u00e9  which was nice too but not very lemony   When the bill came,  well over &100.00 an $86.00 seat charge was added to our bill!  Appallingly poor practice for a good restaurant. The manager was rude and pompous and embarrassed us  tremendously.  He told us we signed for al fresco dining !  OK but we were inside!  After a lot of back and forth the charge was eventually removed. But the entire episode spoiled our evening. We're not the \"beautiful people\" we saw all around us, and we didn't order a huge meal with drinks but nevertheless we were paying customers and expected to be treated as such. I compclaimed to the general manager by E  Mail but heard nothing. So unless you spend  lots of money on drinks, starters etc.  don't expect any service. Very disappointed !"

            "review": "I am giving the food 3.5 stars and the cocktails 5 for a total of 4 stars. \n\nIt's not that the food was bad. It was good. Better than I was expecting actually. I always thought that Giada was riding the coattails of her grandfather and her good looks with all the success she has had within the food industry and that the food would rate right in there with Carrabas or Papa Vinos but it was actually pretty decent. They are still pretty new at this point so they have plenty of time to up their game.\n\nIt was great being able to see a lot of the ingredients they were using kept in plain sight of the diners. Everything looked fresh and delicious. I think they have a great concept going on here and should do just fine. My advice? Bring the food up a notch or the price down a notch and you will be right in the pocket.\n\nThe desserts were delicious. They bring out a cart filled with 3 shelves of desserts. It made for a great presentation. We all had something different and everyone was blown away. \n\nNow as far as the bar goes... bartender Eric Hobbie made us some cocktails that were 100% off the chain... and off the menu for that matter! He improvised a few cocktails for us based on our likes and dislikes. A true artist in love with his craft is always a great find and Giada, or whoever hand picked this guy, hit a grand slam. We will be going back just to sit with Eric again and experience some more liquid gold. The entire bar staff offered great service and were all very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. \n\nOn a side note, the manager asked one of my party to remove their hat, which they did without question or attitude and the manager even apologized over and over but it still bothered me a little, although it didn't bother my friend in the least bit. And, for the record,  I don't blame the manager, he was just doing his job and he was very polite and professional about it. I blame the owners. I think it's time for some of these upscale strip restaurants to get over themselves. Good food is for everyone and we spend quite a bit of money when we go sit down and start eating and drinking. We liked the drinks and had a good time at the bar so we will probably go back, but if we had to make a decision based on food alone... trust me, we wouldn't be going back to the room to change. There are plenty of Italian fine dining  restaurants that don't mind a baseball cap or two at their bar for hours. \n\nActually, Giada is probably doing a disservice to a lot of her fans. I would guess that if you polled a lot of the people that would be interested in eating Giada's food you would probably find that a good percentage of them wear ball caps or have husbands/boyfriends that wear ball caps on the strip. So come on Giada, when it gets down to the nitty gritty, your fame came from the same channel that spawned Fieri so lets not get too uppity just yet. You have to earn it."

            "review": "\"I eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything.\" -- Giada quote etched into the light fixtures above the dining room. I guess that's justification for the small portions. The other harbinger for our dismal dining experience was the tray of seasonings brought out with the bread plate. The food should be seasoned by the chef, not the diners.\n\nBARBARELLA: This cocktail was similar to an adult lemonade. I enjoyed the basil accents and the rather large glass, but it's not worth $15.\nWOOD ROASTED MUSHROOMS: Menu says this comes with roasted Marcona almonds and ricotta salata. They were basic mushrooms, but the thin cheese slices were a nice touch. No almonds were present.\nGRILLED OCTOPUS: Charred exterior but slightly overcooked and no seasoning whatsoever. Had to ask for lemon, which was embarrassing. Texture seemed to have been boiled to cook and then grilled to add blistering. Disappointing.\nPECORINO TARTUFO: the cheese course suggested by our server, plated with apricot preserves. A highlight! Great salty richness to the cheese with a hint of a truffle crust, the sweetness of the fruit was a good complement. But when the cheese course is one of your most memorable dishes, you're in trouble.\n\"SPICY ITALIAN SAUSAGE ARANCINI\": The name and description are laughably misleading. There is no sausage in this dish, server insisted it's in the risotto crust. Spice flavor was extremely slight. There's no reason whatsoever for the name to reference sausage if it's basically ricotta(?) cheese sticks with marinara sauce. Two thumbs down.\nROASTED BABY BEET SALAD: This was fine. Beets and goat cheese on a bed of frisee with a light dressing and some pepitas. Not bad but nothing different here.\nSTEAK TENDERLOIN CROSTINI: A surprise hit! Good balance of flavors between the thin-cut tenderloin and a mustard-esque sauce and some pickled veggies. Thick, crisp base. Seems to be a newer offering in this category.\nCOLD PEA SOUP: Completely unbalanced. Tasted like pure pureed peas, had hoped for a delicate, subtle pea flavor offset by the pancetta... but it was not. Too bold, too forceful, no restraint, would not get again.\nBACON WRAPPED DATES: Smoky, sweet, and a touch spicy. That's how this dish is supposed to play out, and it does, briefly. Then the sweetness overwhelms. Rather large portion compared to other dishes here, 6 pieces. I liked the bleu cheese crema, wish there was more of it.\nLEMON POTATOES: Crispy \"smashed\" and fried potatoes. Nice blanket of cheese atop the order, nicely done, and the portion goes farther than you'd think.\nSPAGHETTI: I don't care for the pronunciation guide for the pasta portion of the menu, but the spaghetti was decent. Attractively plated with two large and tasty shrimp and a small nest of pasta and a lemony cream sauce similar to an alfredo. As many other reviews state, $34 is a bit much for this dish. Compared to the original menu, the price has risen $6 in the past year. \nLEMONCELLO SOUFFLE: This was the dessert suggested by our server. It's presented tableside with a scoop of buttermilk gelato, which is placed atop the souffl\u00e9 to melt into the dish. I liked the lemon flavors of the souffl\u00e9, but only the topmost portion was cooked to the light, airy style characteristic of a souffl\u00e9. Rather than having a gooey center, the entire bottom half of the dish seemed to be a gritty, soupy (though tasty) mess, which wasn't helped by the melted gelato.\n\nSERVICE. Our server was polite, and suggested a few great dishes. The two-top tables for couples are small, and the plates are large, and we ordered a lot. Our table filled up quick, yet none of the bussers or servers removed our unused wine glasses, unnecessary bread plates, etc. Toward the end of our meal, service improved. It appeared our server had our table, along with another couple, in addition to a party of 10, which was a bit much for one person to handle.\n\nAfter waiting a year to experience Giada's restaurant, our dining experience was disappointingly subpar. The menu and dish descriptions are precisely our style, but many of the dishes received did not match what we were led to expect- multiple dishes were missing ingredients and others lacked seasoning altogether. Though there are a few unique dishes here (no small feat in Vegas!), too many have better versions elsewhere on the Strip."

So... we settled for the previous night at 4:30 pm....Not as romantic during the daylight!\n\nSo while we were anticipating a loving \"evening\" dinner for two- what we got was far from romantic and closer to pedantic!\n\nWhen we arrived on time, we were directed to the bar. Uh...ok, we'll have a drink. We were given a hi-tech screen menu from which to choose the cocktails of our liking.  I wanted a bloody Mary- simple tomato juice, vodka, lemon juice, pepper and maybe a celery stalk.  The aloof male- handsome and bearded- made for the part-\"bar tender\" was not amused that I was surprised that there was No tomato juice nor V8 juice. What? I exclaimed.... no tomato juice!!??!!\nI settled for a Giada's Bloody Mary. It was not palatable. The color looked like a brown liquid excrement that was totally undrinkable, the taste fowl. A female tender came to my rescue from this concoction. She said Giada had her opinions of how a bloody Mary should be prepared to be unique and unprocessed. \"Unprocessed\" what the hell is tomato juice!?!? I knew from that point that we'd be hearing her lemming staff reiterate during the meal that \"it's the way Giada wanted it\"- it was going to be a disappointing dinner. At least they didn't mess up my Martini. By the way, the  2 hosts behind the bar were TOTALLY non verbal with the clientele. Exactly what you do not want at a restaurant bar. We were then seated, thank God we got away from those 2 snobs!\nWe ordered appetizers- chicken marsala meatballs, beef tenderloin crostini, clams then 2 minestrone soups and an \"arrugala\" salad. I ordered a lobster ravioli. Two appetizers were to be served with the main meal but were premature.\nThe steelhead salmon as referenced on the menu is typically referred to as a trout and should be referred to as a trout- not a steelhead salmon. Of all the steelhead I have caught on the Salmon river out of Lake Ontario, none were ever called a steelhead salmon. Picky? yes. But you need to be a bit more humble.\nThe soups were bland and skimpy at best- lacking seasoning. Our salad was not what we ordered. They sent a romaine salad. Not bad, but not what we ordered. \nWhen selecting a wine, I had a problem reading the menu with a long very obvious hair dangled in my sight of view which I hand to swipe away to see what I wanted to order. But i digress.....\nNo spoon on an Italian table? They did bring spoons for the soup, good idea.There were no table cloths. Not entirely bad except that between servings neither the table nor the place mats were wiped! So much so that when our desert was being prepared, our waitress placed our utensils among the leftover debris making sure they weren't placed ON the debris instead of just cleaning it up before placing down the silverware. When the dessert was presented, we petitioned the waiter to clean the table before putting down our deserts. \nA waitress came and cleaned up the scene and appeared to be put out by having to do so. Unfortunate but true it was. She said our coffees were in process- waiting on the barista.  Our deserts came and the coffee didn't. No longer desiring to continue our dessert without coffee, we decided that it was now too much to tolerate. We asked for the check which by the way was 5 star tab for a 2 star performance.\nNo manager came to our table and on the way out we informed 2 \"suits\" of our dismay. One just looked at me and the other, when I told HIM of our dissatisfaction, asked if i wanted to talk about it.  I told him to read about it on yelp! Giada better look at a few reruns of kitchen nightmares and/or restaurant make-overs to get her act together. \nFor the readers.... don't fall for the celebrity, the pretty face nor the wonderful TV prepared meals she appears to put together so professionally.   What you see on TV is staged. She can't stage reality and the reality is disappointing to say the least. Save a pot of money and eat good....eat elsewhere.\nWhen we drove up to valet and when we were leaving as well, the attendants couldn't be more polite, concerned and caring about our experience. They wished us to return but for their sake we're sorry that's not gonna happen."

            "review": "Saw pictures of this restaurant and also read some really good reviews about this place so my family and I decided to make reservations and check it out. We did breakfast just to see how it was pretty much get our feet wet to see if it's worth checking out for dinner. I like the location. Very nice view, and also it's up some escalators so it has that feeling it's away from the smelly, smokey casinos which is a nice change. Our server was I believe his name was Juliano (had had an accent so it was a little difficult to understand him) Juliano is what I heard. His approach was very nice and also made sure to give my daughter a children's portion breakfast due to Giada's restaurant not having a children's menu or anything on the menu that a young child would even consider eating due to it being so different,which wasn't a big deal because they made her eggs and bacon with some toast and gave a decent pricing due to it being a small side plate of food. My daughter enjoyed it. Our meals were amazing. Fresh, well cooked, and excellent flavor. Also our fresh squeezed juice was delicious. The orange and carrot juice seemed to be the favorite at our table. My husband got the hash and he said it was really good, and I got the American breakfast it to was very good. My husband and I have already talked about going for Dinner on our next outing so we can see if the dinner is also as good as the breakfast was. And what the heck we will for sure have to eventually check out the lunch too. Our only complaint would have been our service was somewhat on the slow side. It took the server a long time to come and clear plates and give us our check. Whoever was the busser was slacking. We had dirty dishes and glasses on our table for a long time. We gave the food on a scale of 1-10, a 10 and the service a 6. Also my husband showed how the silverware and glasses were not polished. I still give this place 4 stars our of 5 due to the fact the food and location of the restaurant was amazing. We look forward to going back for dinner and or lunch hopefully my next review can be updated with 5 stars and an even better review."

            "review": "Giada - please read ...this review is for YOU ...not people considering your restaurant - this is for you and those around you who are running your restaurant - and here's why...\n\nThis is NOT a review about terrible wait times: we had a reservation and were seated immediately.\n\nThis is NOT a review about bad service: the hostess smiled a million-dollar \"Giada\" smile, wished one of our party \"Happy Birthday\" and acted as though we were a very special guest in the home...(in other words - what people have stated about bad service, \"straight faced, serious\" wasn't close to the truth as we experienced it) ...\n\n...further, the waiter was a top-notch guy from Italy, who acted and treated us just as the hostess did ...as though we were his only guest/table...(and this even after we asked to switch to another, more intimate, table, which was done so immediately without problems) ...\n\n...the partner/server treated us just as well and was as professional as could be and very personable...\n\n...the entree server, however, treated us like he had an issue or a chip on his shoulder - nearly shoving the food onto the table, making a loud \"clank\" noise with each plate, almost purposely showing us disdain for some reason (we're not one to play the race card ...and it won't be mentioned who or what race was involved - save to say, we're an interracial party - and he seemed to possibly have that as an issue.  While we've experienced this before in other restaurants and other cities, sometimes it's tough to tell if someone's simply having a bad day - providing bad service, or if they actually do have an issue with you for cultural/racial reasons.) ...let's move on...\n\nThis is NOT a review about the food: the food, however, was terrible.  The cocktails were good - but the appetizers and chicken dinner/cacciatore for 2 were the opposite of the recipes we've made from your site and cookbooks (as we are gigantic fan of yours - have your cookbooks, watch your show daily etc.etc.) ... but there were no complaints made and nothing returned - purposely (even amongst ourselves - and we imagine some of you may agree - the only thing worse than a less-than-perfect meal, is the complaints and irate-nature of a less-than-civil patron or dinner-guest.  Unless the place has literally made you ill, write your \"wrongs\" here - don't ruin everyone else's night ...just make the best of it.)\n\nThis is NOT a review about the atmosphere: It was stunning and beautiful and perfect (nice, smokey firewood aroma as you enter- beautiful ambience.)\n\nSo, what IS this review about???  This...\n\nBy listening with the 3rd ear on the entire experience, we came to realize something that many \"absentee owners\" run into and is the reason they subsequently fail: If you don't choose the right people at critical moments in the hiring - when the cats are away, the mice will play.  It appears your restaurant is suffering from that very choice - those you have surrounded yourself with.  Some (not all - as mentioned above) literally state the song-and-dance they must in as lack-luster a manner as possible (with the demeanor of \"yeah yeah - here's my kool-aide pitch while inside I think Giada's a real ______\")  - they have no loyalty to the product they serve, nor the way they are coming off nor to you.  \n\nWe really got a sense of the above the next night prior to closing; we came back to have wine/cocktails.  We saw our great waiter/\"new friend\"- true to form, he shook my hand - and  told us the bar would be open until 1am and to have a seat and enjoy ...\n\n...when we did sit at the bar, the bar-tender seemed to see us as a problem and were treating us very second rate ...while treating her \"hip\" friends to gossip, etc...as though the bar service was not really her job (we've all seen an employee's friends show up - giving the employee license to \"hang out\"...)\n\n...so let me state clearly - this \"non-review\" is actually pointing out the tell-tale signs that your people are NOT watching your back ...as she, the bartender, poured the wine I literally had to say \"whoa! You can stop - that much wine is going to make me crawl outta' here! lol\" - it just seemed she didn't care she was literally filling a (huge) wine glass near full..and she would have kept going had i not raised the alarm.  This was just one of many, many small \"alarms\" that the sum of the whole would make any owner, had she known, pause for concern.\n\nSo let me wrap this up - if you read my past reviews, you'll see credit where it's due and harsh reality where things go wrong, with suggestions as to why or how to fix.  That said, as mentioned at the start - this review isn't for others to decide on going to your restaurant - this review is for you to understand you have people there that do not have your interests at heart.  Some do - some do not.  It would be great if you could weed them out and provide a beautiful experience to match the beautiful restaurant your name and reputation deserve.\n\nThanks...\n\nJohnnie"

It started with the fact that no one answers the phone, we tried to call for a reservation, we finally got a reservation, booked on-line by the concierge at our hotel, pretty lame as he could not reach anyone by phone either. \nWe showed up early, bad move. The hostess was rude, condescending and really really snotty. Her feedback was that we would be seated when our reservation was set for. Here's the odd part. There were plenty of open tables, and the table they eventually sat us at were open the entire time we were waiting. Really?! \nOk so the food, my wife and I eat out a lot, at lots of high end spots, and loving Giada the way we do we expected to just love the food in spite of the bad experience that got us to the table. It was tasty and somewhat original, but the salt was over the top, every dish was so over salted, and I love salt, so you rarely hear that from me.\nLast but not least, the prices, OMG! $16 for 5 small Arancini sausage balls? $32 for 2-3 ounces of the Pappardelle Pork Ragu? I expect to \"pay\" for high end food at a high end restaurant but that's just offensive, seriously it's pasta with about 3 tablespoons of ragu. \nSorry to have to say all of this but between the snotty hostess and the salt mangling of the recipes, it just ruined it for us."

Surprisingly our 4 courses came out to the sound of $168 and we left hungry due to their small portion sizes. We expected the higher price point, but it would have been more acceptable if we left satisfied.\n\nWe ordered:\nGiada's Caprese - perfect combination of heirloom cherry tomatoes and mozzarella!\nMortadella - savory on top of moist bread, even better with a little pesto from the bread tray!\nSurf & Turf - crab raviolo (1) was good ... filet was questionable, arrived with a greyish color...in the moment I thought it may be the lighting, but the flavor said differently. It was still tender but was not worth the $60 price tag.\nSweet Corn - sweet and savory, just a hint of spice...delicious!\nChocolate Tart - definitely worth going just for this...decadent!\n\nService was great! Diego was our server and he was on top of it. Although it took a bit for him to warm up to us, I would still recommend asking for his section. The staff went out of their way to wish a happy birthday to my wife and even surprised her with a note on our desert plate!\n\nOverall great service, not so great food and overpriced."

First the Birdie arrived, followed by the iced tea, and finally the coffee as water was provided when we were seated. The iced tea was a light amber color and tasted more watered down than a bootleggers bottle of whiskey during prohibition. When I asked the server about it, she stated that it was white tea and was more mild. This however is FALSE, it is in fact black tea. FAIL. They brought me a raspberry tea in it's place which was fine.\n\nThe coffee arrived, and it was cold - really this is inexcusable unless specifically ordered to be iced or cool. Additionally a cup of green tea was ordered and a cup of black tea was delivered to the table. This warranted a visit to the manager who did what she could to rectify some of the issues.\n\nMy wife and I ordered the brunch sampling menu which featured a plate of pastries, appetizers, choice of entree, and dessert. One of the appetizers featured salmon which neither my wife or I wanted so we asked for a substitution (which they would happily do). When the appetizers arrived a single plate of pastries arrived and appetizers with salmon. The salmon was sent back and a plate was returned without the salmon. I asked if the pastries we received was a single serving or for two, and the server wasn't sure. She finally let me know that the plate featured one additional pastry for both of us.\n\nI selected the chicken & waffles (roasted chicken with cacciatore sauce and parmesan crusted waffles). The chicken didn't have much flavor by itself, the cacciatore sauce was watery and featured more peppers than anything else, and the waffles were brittle and dry. Take this one back to the kitchen Giada... it's not ready.\n\nThe Tower of Chocolate (three layer chocolate cake) and the Lemon Ricotta ice cream cookies with raspberry sorbet. The ice cream sandwiches were superior to the tower of chocolate, but really neither one made a lasting impression on me.\n\nFor the price point of the restaurant and experience avoid this restaurant. Giada you have quality control issues and considering your name is practically on everything in the restaurant, I expect more. My first visit was a pleasant experience, but this one shows the deterioration of the quality and service level."

We tried a few appetizers first and then onto the soup of pickled cauliflower and white chocolate. The taste was heavenly. Then into the main course and we all shared something different. The fresh pasta and jumbo prawns with lemon and basil very fabulous with the colors and the fresh taste in each bite. Very fresh in all the dishes. Rigatoni, fresh salmon. Everything prepared to your liking. At the end we all shared the chocolate and banana gelato and homemade cookies that just gave you enough sweetness along the end of the evening.

Next served was a tray of assorted breads including lemon basil baguette, crostini, and Parmesan sticks, this could have been the meal itself because they served it with little bowls of marscapone, oil and fresh herbs, fried capers, sea salt, and red pepper. We shared 2 appetizers the first a bacon wrapped date stuffed with spicy sausage & Gorgonzola crema, the second eggplant fries with shaved Parmesan and light tomato dipping sauce. We opted for pasta in lieu of entrees to keep our costs down. I had small plate rigatoni with vegetable bolognese and my date had small plate bucatini (thick spaghetti) Calabrian chile & fresh ricotta. Desert was shared lemon meringue first a large meringue cookie topped with heaps of lemon curd, topped with fresh raspberry, almonds and tiny bit of sweet basil drizzle on the plate.

I wasn't wowed, I yawned."

            "review": "Let me preface this review with some commentary on a local \"critic's\", well, I guess, \"pre-emptive\" review in which he basically denounced all things Giada, pretty much predicated on her fame. I'd suggest the real motive behind it is her fame and his lack thereof, at least beyond the usual, incestual, self-aggrandizing LV \"foodie\" circles. My guess is he got to meet her (probably about three bottles into an early afternoon, knowing him) at any one of a half dozen food/ wine bacchanals across the U.S. and failed to impress her with his LV notoriety.\n\nOn to the subject at hand- the eponymous Giada at the re-opened and renovated Cromwell (formerly Bills, nee The Barbary Coast). While my not-so-esteemed hobby-critic non-professional is correct in his observance that the very affable Ms. de Laurentiis has never operated a restaurant, she does have a very real passion for food that her experience on the Food Network has translated into a somewhat new breed of culinary experience. As for how that translates into a commercial culinary operation, well, based on my experience, she's got the bulk of it figured out. Back to that later...\n\nAs far as the experience went, the room's very much like its namesake- beautiful, but not in the glamorous sense that pervades all things Vegas, more along the lines of the girl-next-door. Bright and airy, with clean lines, uncluttered space, and sparing us of overly-retro/ ironic furnishings and paint schemes, it's simply a breath of fresh air. The only knock here is the hokey \"tour\" of the counter space that fronts the open space of the kitchen. Better to let waiting guests explore on their own and have friendly staff ask them if they have any questions with an appropriate table-side follow up, which, based on the service I received, would be proficiently, if not charmingly, executed.\n\nBeverage-wise (and all great meals' first course, IS a beverage, preferably somewhat strong drink), this place is in very capable mixological hands. My table sampled several of the cocktails which covered a broad spectrum of tastes and ingredients. Well-balanced and elegantly presented, they formed a great flavor canopy under which we stretched out, relaxed, and perused the bill of fare. Which, with much confidence, our server, whose name has, for the moment escaped me, handled ably as my dining companion proceeded to order from both sides of the menu (the left side being more small plate/ anti-pasti driven, while the right side features larger, heartier dishes), in the manner of a SWAT officer range-testing a new automatic weapon. As we awaited the various plates arrival, our sommelier approached. I informed her of the myriad and sundry plates on their way from the kitchen, and when she asked, \"Do you want to go red or white?\" , my response, hedonist that I wish I to be,  was, both.\n\nAs dishes arrived and were placed upon the table family style with well-enunciated descriptions, she returned with both, and they were perfect. A medium-light bodied white and similar red with bright acidity to keep flavors flowing and the flavors did just that- flowed deliciously. This is fresh, just off the garden style cooking, reminiscent of backyard-dining at family gatherings. Except this was Italian, unlike my family's tendency to flame-roasted flesh, potatoes, and fresh peas, regardless of season. Well, maybe the fresh peas regarded the season...\n\nAnyway, from the charred octupus to arancini, the flavors were bright and straight-forward. The only miss was a soup that I'm quite sure had been the result of an improperly followed recipe. Call it the vulnerable moment that endeared me as I was happily overwhelmed by layers of excellence.\n\nAs the large plates arrived, I again beckoned the sommelier and asked her help along the same criteria, albeit with some bolder flavors and richer options, none of which missed the mark. I might add, she accomplished all of this with by-the-glass offerings. An aside- here's the true mark of a wine program- you should find every pairing you need for everything on the menu on their BTG list. It's really not all that hard. Anyway, the star of all those plates, and by \"star\" I mean Alpha Centauri compared to Vega, was the Lemon Spaghetti. Perfectly cooked, perfect texture, perfectly balanced, it resulted in much discussion at our table about our own recipes for such and a \"throw-down\" challenge, of which I am a part. I look forward to repeated research outings here...\n\nDessert too, was comfortable, fresh, and uncomplicated- a selection of great gelatos and some amazing chocolate cookies rounded it all out.\n\nWhich brings me back to my point about this being Ms. de Laurentiis' first go- it's all about passion and professionalism, only one of which can be learned, but both can be hired. This place is in very capable hands..."

Having eaten here for brunch before, I had an idea of what we should expect. \n\nWhat I didn't expect was to leave having paid $450 for a subpar meal. The proportions are extremely small, which you don't expect for the price you are paying. We ordered the charbroiled octopus, bacon wrapped dates and salumi platter for appetizers. The octopus and dates were very salty, to the point that my relatives didn't eat them. \n\nMy uncle and I shared the whole chicken for two that was to be cooked cacciatore style. 1st, this chicken was cut and deep fried, served with red sauce on the side. Nowhere on the menu did it say that this chicken would be deep fried, and I kid you not when I say that this fried chicken tasted like something from KFC. My husband got the salmon which was great. My Aunt ordered the rigatoni (for $26) and it was what one would expect for rigatoni with a bolengese sauce to taste like. \n\nHonestly, I felt a little embarrassed that I had recommended this place as our 'big dinner' while they were in town. The uncreative menu and over salty food made for a poor dining experience."

Cool... Single big Ice cubes for rocks drinks and fun egg white foam for clever cocktails. Hostess sits us at about 9. No menus given [i get it they want you order wine before dinner] ok. But we had a long while to look at the menus at the bar. The server comes about 9:15 and asked for wine and cocktails order. We Order a bottle of wine. Takes about 20-25 minutes because it wasn't \"chilled\". Finally wine is served, it's a Pinot ... Could have served it to me right out of storage but anyway.... The entire service from sit down to water service to wine service (both times) to waiting for the dessert cart to roll around was a 3 hour experience. Way to long for this type of restaurant. \n\nThe veal was fried. \nThe bucatini was mediocre at best. \nThe spaghetti was an amazing house lemon sauce instead of red sauce... Which blows my mind. You can't have a spaghetti on the menu with a lemon sauce. Just breaks all the rules. However the fish was beautiful and light. \n\nAsparagus soup was bland but the tricolor was yum\n\nOctopus was to die for. \nAracinis were not my favorite. \nAnd the dates, well.. I would have expected more. \n\nThis place is booked out for a long while and I know they are just getting the hang of things so I'll try it again in a month or so."

The taste wasn't anything special. \n\nI personally ordered the Branzino, and since I'm not too familiar with this term, I thought it would be a similar style to a Chilean Sea Bass - nope, just fried fish with tomatoes that you can get at your local fish store. \n\nFrom our entire table, I must say that maybe the lobster ravioli was the best, which was not even that great, and it didn't even fill any of us up. We had to walk over to Giordano's at Bally's later on to satisfy our hunger after leaving Giada's. \n\nWell...I guess I could say at least I've been there!"

I had something with champagne but honestly I wish I had picked wine because the food has enough flavors so my sweet cocktail was throwing it off. \n\nA must - the antipasto platter - just do it! Roasted ricotta stuffed peppers where perfect grilled and the quality of cheeses overall is divine. There was medley of mushrooms that I could have eaten all night. Bacon wrapped dates, olives, and the crostinis are so intricate it will blow your mind. \n\nMains: \nLobster ravioli- done in a light lemon olive oil over spinach. Fantastic and a refreshing change from a heavy cream sauce. \n\nPrawn pasta - must have! It was a tad heavy on salt but a house hit and rightfully so. \n\nRack of Lamb- I'd get this next time. Tasted my mom's and it was so well flavored - no gamey taste at all! \n\nSurf and Turf- if you love steak the sauce on this is was something I've never experienced. Like a cherry wine sauce - Devine! \n\nGood luck getting a reservation but man she's worth the hassle!!"

We were seated quickly upon arrival and the decor and ambiance was beautiful.  Our waitress Karina came over to us and let us know her and George would be taking care of us today.  She asked if we wanted anything other than water but we both declined as all we wanted was water due to the hot Vegas weather.  She seemed extremely annoyed that all we wanted was water.  We then were left to look at the menu, and decide what we wanted...for about 20 minutes before Karina returned again, asking us what we decided on.  At that point my mom and I asked her to explain the menu and let us know what her recommendations were.  The disgust on her face was enough to make me want to leave, she went through the menu while looking like she wanted to do anything other than help us.  Meanwhile, we were watching the waiter Michael, who had the tables around us great everyone, explain the menu and his picks and help everyone pick out a meal.  We then decided on some pizza's, salads and olives.  After we ordered, we didn't see Karina again until she brought us our check.  Our water was never refilled, we couldn't find anyone to refill it, our food was brought by someone else which in most upscale restaurants it is, but Karina never even came by to see how we liked our meal.  We were treated like we didn't belong there, and it ruined the meal and the whole experience.  When they give you your check they also give you an iPhone to fill out a survey about your experience and leave a name and number so they can contact you.  I left this similar review with my name and number and was never contacted.  Overall, the food was amazing but not worth the money or time due to the terrible service we received.  We visit Vegas often and we will never be back again, and I'll be sure to spread the word with family, friends and/or strangers about how badly they treat their customers."

Then, we were ignored for twenty minutes, finally grabbed a waiter and asked for the manager.  \nTen minutes later, a manager arrived.  \nWe relayed our experiences and his reaction was reminiscent of Capt Louis Renault in Casablanca. He was 'shocked' at our experience.  \nWithin a few minutes, water and menus arrived.

Nothing a pinch of salt won't fix, better not enough salt then to much!  The sauce from the meats balls in the other hand we all wanted to eat with the bread and everything else!    I orders the Hannibal as a cocktail which was way to much ice not enough Hannibal, but the taste was good. Not my favorite , but still tasty and great with my meal.  We had the risotto with scallops , the spaghetti signature dish, salmon (which believe it or not in my opinion was the best dish of the night)  and the 7oz filet!  For sides asparagus which was delicious , potatoes were super tasty and my all time favorite the corn!  I ended up adding the corn the the spaghetti which made the spaghettini a super delicious dish because of of all the flavor in the corn that it added to the pasta.

Knows the food inside and out, has great recommendations, and has a true passion for the Italian food and culture. A nice touch is he has a business card which is a napkin, great idea. \nYou can start with fresh baked breads, however I did not have any, they bake it right in front of the restaurant, gives it a nice atmosphere and aroma!\nI started with the grilled octopus. It was very tender, which I could cut it with my fork and had a nice char on it. \nFor the main dish I had the rack of lamb, 2 double cut lamb chops cooked to perfection. It was crusted with mustard, which wasn't too spicy, but gave it a nice crust and flavor. It was served with a small spinach gremolata, nice flavor, but you will need more of a side dish. So on the side I had the grilled broccoli rabe with the spicy Calabrian chili vinaigrette. If you like spicy, order extra because it is to die for! The grilled broccoli is a nice touch, as many other Italian places simply saut\u00e9 it and grilling it gives the rabe great flavor. \nI would come back for the atmosphere and knowing I will have a good meal. It's not a cheap night out however. With a few glasses of wine and tip I paid $175.

We decided we would just order at the bar and eat there since there was no point in waiting for our table in an empty restaurant. The only reason I deducted a star. I ordered the Sunrise Waffle which was absolutely delicious. The perfect balance of sweet and savory. My boyfriend ordered the Carbonara Pizza which he kept raving about. I was lucky to get a bite of it and it was delicious as well. We loved the food and the decorum of the restaurant...very LA and chic which suits Giada's personality.

The restaurant is always so booked that we had to take an 8:45pm dinner reservation even though we booked weeks in advance.  Not a huge deal as it's Vegas and you're going to be up late every night anway.\n\nWe arrived a little early and had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table.  Just enough time for me to go to the bar and order a red Sangria to sip on while we waited.  We got our table and were pleasantly surprised to see that they sat us at a booth near the center facing the windows so we had a good view of the Bellagio fountain.  I'm not sure if telling them this was an anniversary dinner had anything to do with it.  Much better than our view last time when we were put at the far right of the windows.\n\nOur waiter was Cliff and he was MUCH better than the Miley Cyrus lookin' girl we had the last time.  We has friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  I ordered the Surf and Turf, (Filet Mignon with Lobster Ravioli and Cliff made a great recommendation on a glass of red wine to go with it. The wife was Spaghetti with Shrimp and the mother in law had Risotto with Scallops.  Everything was very good.  My steak was cooked perfectly.  However I was a little disappointed that the dish only came with ONE ravioli, (not a lot of food for the $56 price tag the dish carries).  I guess Giada doesn't want you getting too full.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the leaning tower of chocolate and Cliff also brought us some complimentary lemon cookies on a plate that said, \"Happy Anniversary\".  Nice touch.\n\nMy wife raved about the coffee the last time we were here so when Cliff came to take our dessert order I mentioned that my wife was looking forward to it.  Unfortunately Cliff thought I meant she just wanted a cup of regular coffee when what she wanted was the mocha that she had had on our last visit.  The wife tried the plain coffee but didn't really like it.  So I went over to Cliff and apologized for the misunderstanding.  I showed him a picture of the coffee drink she previously had as I had it on my phone.  Apparently they make a different mocha drink at night than they do in the evening and Cliff wasn't quite sure which one she had had.  But he brought her both an Orange Mocha and a kind of Amaretto Espresso.  The wife liked them both but ended up drinking the Espresso and giving the Mocha to her mom.\n\nOverall the experience was amazing and Cliff did an excellent job of making the evening memorable."

Got to meet Giada while I was there she was so gracious to speak with me and take a photo.  She is as cool in person as she is on TV.  The menu is very comprehensive and the staff will gladly make recommendations and take you through to make sure you get what you want.  Really can't say enough great things about this but will recommend to anyone visiting Vegas as a must visit."

Well, if you just eat in the bar (because you cannot get a reservation for two months) you cannot eat from the regular menu-just the bar menu. The bar menu items are really small and very expensive. NOT worth it at all. Very disappointed. For what we paid, I would expect a whole lot more.  We know Vegas is expensive, but at least make the food good.  Great red wines."

There's a wide variety of choices on the antipasti menu and we thoroughly enjoyed about 5 out of the 6 we ordered. The lemon spaghetti was out of this world. I regret not trying a dessert, everything looked amazing. I knocked off two stars solely for the service. The hostesses were cold and unwelcoming and our server was clueless. We were seated about 30 minutes after our original reservation. The moment we sat down, our server wanted to get us out the door. She was pushy and attempted to rush us through our meal. She also failed to refill water glasses, clear plates when new dishes came out, just those small things you never really think about  until it happens. I would go back again, but perhaps try to be seated at the bar to avoid the poor service."

They also have a really nice kid's menu. The pizza looked so good, I almost wanted one too.  The highlight of the night for me was the French press coffee. It was so yummy I felt as if I was having dessert.  Salmon was just ok, nothing special. No crispy skin. Scallop was nice, but the risotto was not special and way under done. Finally, the broccoli rabe didn't look like the veggie I was familiar with, though I still liked it. However, it was too salty and too spicy. Not great as a side to my seafood entree."

            "review": "I had high hopes for Giada's, but unfortunately the restaurant fell flat.  I anticipated the food to be the centerpiece of the visit, but it ended up being the leading contributor to my one-star experience.  Three of the guests in our party shared two orders of the risotto.  Not only did both plates have a significant number of crab shells (real crab at least), but all three became ill after eating it.  Admittedly, the pasta and branzino were cooked much better, although the simplicity of the dish, an apparent hallmark of the restaurant, rendered them far from memorable.\n\nService was more akin to the risotto than the pasta.  Our waiter Joey had a strong, friendly start that quickly disappeared, just as he did.  His salesmanship was highlighted by his attempt to push the prix-fixe menu primarily based on an autographed Giada folio with the menu and a few recipes.  Admittedly, Joey was probably correct that the restaurant's selection of the least interesting dishes for the prix-fixe was likely not what was driving diners to choose it.  The pitch on the prix-fixe was followed by his description of one of Giada's signature cocktails as the most popular selection but also the most frequently returned to the bar.  \n\nAfter his presentation of the menu, Joey disappeared for an extended period of time, and later in the meal he did not even bother to visit the table from the time the first course was served to when the check was delivered.  This seemed particularly surprising given the apparent high ratio of staff to guests at the restaurant overall.  As if the experience wasn't already far short of expectations, the check was also incorrect, as Joey had added a random dish that had not been ordered or served.  \n\nAs someone who professionally reviewed restaurants for years, this restaurant falls on the very low end of its peer group."

If I had more time in Vegas, I would've definitely returned for dinner. The restaurant is so beautiful. It properly emulates Giada's charm and sophistication. While the butter knives were gorgeous, they are heavy and SHARP. If you have young children, make sure you set them aside straight away.\n\nI enjoyed every moment at Giada.

One Veg and one Meat!\n\nThe pacing of our meals was perfect. We had a couple of minutes between courses to digest and prepare ourselves for what was next. Things were great.\n\nWe were both thrilled with our choices by the time our mains came around. With the tasting menu you each get a side with the entr\u00e9e. Most of them were loaded with meat but our waiter told me they could do the peas without. Perfect.\n\nThat is until I got two or three bites in to them and I picked a chunk of meat out of my teeth...\n\nAt this point I'm pretty much finished eating. I'm feeling gross and a little sick and I barely had a third of my entree. Our waiter apologised and offered to have more peas made. I told him I was finished.\n\nThey clear our table and the dessert cart comes around. You get five each with the tasting menu and I ask if we could get them to go and the dessert cart guy says \n\n\"Giada wants her customers to experience everything at it's freshest so we don't make desserts to go.\"\n\nI pointed out that Giada probally wouldn't want me eating meat in a vegetarian dish and he just shrugged his shoulders. Not very helpful, but he gave me a look like his hands were tied.\n\nSo 80% of our desserts were wasted. I went back to our hotel feeling awful and it cost us over $300 after the tip. \n\nNot worth it.\n\nMy wife was happy with her meal, but we are not going back to a place that served me meat and didn't try to accomodate us after it was pointed out."

            "review": "I have been anxiously waiting to try Giada ever since they've opened. I'm not sure if it was the hype of a new restaurant opening on the strip or my fanatical love for Giada and her recipes, but I sadly left Giada feeling less than satisfied. First of all, I have to mention that I went to Giada during their lunch service, which to my knowledge, had only started a few days earlier. The lunch menu did not appeal to me as much as the dinner menu but I figured any meal would still be amazing. I'm a little disappointed that they mostly offer salads and sandwiches since I adore carbs and love me some pasta. They had one pasta on the menu and their specialty pasta that day was lasagna. I'm thinking that I made the mistake of expecting too much and letting my anticipation get the best of me. \n\nFirst off, I LOVE THE CROMWELL. We hit valet and took about a 5-minute stroll through the casino, which was beautifully redone (I hadn't been to The Cromwell since their opening). I heard that their gorgeous, semi-vintage chandeliers were found in the former Barbary Coast storage and were refurbished and given a little facelift to match the d\u00e9cor of The Cromwell. And they are just stunning! They give off a red hue that makes the casino feel more intimate and exclusive. I immediately felt like I was the star of a seductive music video and I should've been walking in slow motion. Anyway, back to Giada. You take an escalator up to the restaurant (or approx. two flights of stairs if you dare) and are greeted by very cute hostesses in classy but fun and flirty (almost mesh see-through) BCBG-like dresses. They have a charming waiting area with a cozy \"Home & Garden\" touch AND...a secret photo booth! Well, it's not so secret, but it's a little closet-sized room hidden behind heavy curtains. You can take a picture of you and your date and automatically upload it to your Facebook or have it emailed to you!\n\nThe interior of Giada is beautiful. I love the fresh market feel at the entrance of the venue and the open layout of the restaurant. Every table had a view from any point of the restaurant since the windows face out onto Las Vegas Blvd. and Flamingo. The d\u00e9cor is appealing, with wood floors / tables and the furnishing reminds me of being at home. The daylight streams through the restaurant which lights up the venue in a bright but delicate way. I wasn't too fond of the glassware (the water glasses reminded me of candleholders) and some of the bowls kind of flopped over on its side easily, which I imagine might conclude in a lot of broken glassware and spilled food. But enough about that, and on to the food. The house bread that they brought out was okay, very similar to a pizzeta but the thing that made it amazing was the pesto dipping sauce that accompanied it. \n\nRated on a scale of 1-10:\n\n10 - Burrata Cheese w/ balsamic-salt (really good, but it's hard to mess up burrata cheese)\n10 - Prosciutto San Daniele (also really good, but hard to mess up and was served with your everyday, average \"French's\" mustard?)\n1 - Chicken Marsala Meatballs w/ roasted wild mushrooms (horribly dry and the marsala was watery)\n5 - Carbonara Pizza (just made me feel like I was eating more house bread since the toppings were very minimal)\n5 - Italian Cookies for dessert (this was recommended to us by the server, but I think my cookies are better - lemon cookies were the best)\n\nAll in all, my meal was just sub-par for me. A lot of my colleagues have agreed that their experience was either similar or worse. Just to give you an idea on pricing, I ordered two glasses of wine along with our food and our total bill came to $130.00 before gratuity. I'm still optimistic that dinner might be better so I'll have to come back to try that and give an updated review."

I made reservations which were easy to get if you call direct on noT use online features. We had a party of 7 and they were happy to have us. We arrived early and waited in the reception area and had some cocktails which were reasonably priced for a Hotel restaurant.\nAfter a short time we were seated and the staff was quick to get our drink orders and waters. (because that is key). I wish that bread was brought before we ordered but that is not the case here. Our table was just off the main room and a little in the traffic area but it was comfortable. I have to say the chairs were soft and not what expected at a restaurant. I ordered the ice tea and thought it was a Cirque performance just to drink it. pour from one pot to another pot to a glass of ice. I just want ice with tea. Table was not roomy enough for this spectacle, but nicely done. The rundown on the food.\nAs a whole we ate a little of everything except for any of the antipasti. Josie and I shared the Rib Eye(not sure why I do this to Myself). Came with a giant bone and easy for 2 to share. I dig the egg on top. HOWEVER. I truly will always have a difficult time paying crazy prices for a steak I can make at home at half the cost. If the steak was high 20 to low 30 range fine but for how it tasted I was not happy with cost. (yes I make a pretty mean steak) Steak rant over. Sides, smashed potatoes and sweet corn with sausage. The corn was incredible. Sweet flavor followed by this awesome heat bite from the sausage. Almost a smokey flavor as well. great side I need to learn how is made. Lemon smashed potatoes, smooth citrus taste with a buttery type finish. A must have if you do eat here.\nThat was our meal also eaten that night was risotto, tortellini and salmon. Had a bite of each but nothing was a standout for me.\nfor dessert we had the cookie trio that as far as the lemon cookies go my wife can do better. Yes, its pretentious, but her lemon cookies are awesome. \nI may go again. I can say try it out, food was good, staff was great. Very attentive and knowledgable."

I had no idea Giada had a restaurant in Las Vegas so I was super psyched about coming here. We made a reservation the night before for noon and we got there right on time. They took about 20 minutes to seat us. The hostesses were not too friendly, but whatever. We were seated and our waitress came by to greet us and leave the menu's. It took her almost 20 minutes to come back and ask us what we wanted to drink. By that time we already knew what we wanted to eat and told her because we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes just to order our meals. That was an immediate bad first impression. The drinks were good, I ordered a Bellini my husband a Mimosa. I ordered the Breakfast Contadina that had polenta cakes. They didn't have much flavor. The eggs, well they're eggs. The spinach was good. IBut overall the meal was not to the caliber I was expecting it to be. My husband ordered the Italian Hash. He also thought his meal was just \"ok\". Maybe the lunch and dinner selections are better. I will never know because I'm not ever coming back here. They just took way too long and the food was just ok.

I was running late so we ended up sitting in the bar/lounge area which was perfect for us to catch up and eat good food.  We sat there for over 2 hrs chitt chatting before heading out to a lounge and the rest.  The lighting was perfect not too dark and not too bright, the noise level in the area we sat was Fantastic.  Our waitress was spot on and of course beautiful like a dainty pixie fearie, but it is Vegas after all, no Fugly people in a high end place like this. lol  *well it's true* not to sound..umm arrogant like I guess.  So we ordered a few things and it was filling. We got :\n\nCaponata - this was nice and tangy and portion perfect.\n\nPeppers sliced- they brought out this app. and accidently we though this was their version of caponata, which was way off base of course..lol  \n\nSweet stuffed peppers- very plump juicy and tasty\n\nArugula salad - very peppery tasting as arugula should be and fresh like right from the back yard.\n\nWe shared the Salmon entree which they kindly split for use and the portion was perfect. The salmon was good, but the actual sauce with I think shitake mushroom or something?? Was TO DIE FOR!  \n\nWe had a Chocolate Budino just to try some kind of dessert and it was good with pistachio, but I wanted to also try the Apple Tart, but they just ran out of it.  My girl doesn't really drink and I was also driving so club soda and splash of cran for me please. lol  Besided I don't do girlie fufu drinks anyways and this is NOT a place to be drinking straight shot 151's and blue Lamborghini's and get trashed. :-) I say that for Drai's or Tao. hahaha\n\n  This place was worth it and not snooty, but reflected Giada's personality on tv all the way and was elegant.  It was not expensive at all and I was shocked at how affordable it was. Cheaper than the Cellar. What??!!!   Ofcourse it's not your white castle prices..lol but some place to go to if you want a nice dinner and some intimate time with friends or significant others.   I sooo want to go back and try about 6 things, which when I go back in May I will do just that.  \n\nThis placeuse to be the old Barbary Coast, now called the Cromwell, which kind of gives me what I would say is a James Bond kind of atmosphere, though a bit small.   This should be a go to place, especially since Giada's not known for her having eateries like Lagassie or Bobby Flay, and her place is WAY better IMO.  \n\nAll in all, I'm looking forward to going back with our group of friends when we meet up, since several will be coming from out of town as well.  \n\nGo GIada!"

While the sandwich was good, the bread was dense and overly hard, which made me question the freshness of it.  Second, while the zucchini shoestrings were good, the chef may want to rethink the concept since every time I went to pinch a few, it snapped a lot of the strings.  By the time I was finished, most of the zucchini shoestrings had been reduced to a series of broken matchsticks.  Pretty on the plate, not practical to consume.  Perhaps larger shavings?\n\nMy other friend ordered a pizza and she did say that the dough was very good, but the price did not reflect the single layer of prosciutto on top. \n\nWhile the experience was a pleasant one due to the simple and pretty interiors as well as the waitstaff (trained, no doubt, to tell us that Giada's family prefers to eat the pizza in one manner or Giada prefers you to take a bite of this etc etc), I will not return for a second visit.  Thank you, however, for making my friend's birthday a good one.  The two cookie presentation was nice too and the Lemon Ricotta cookie was very good."

We had the giadas favorites which included the roasted red peppers, bacon wrapped dates and tenderloin crostini. We had cauliflower and white chocolate soup... it sounded weird but it was delicious. The Brussels sprouts and pancetta side was the star of the meal. Now the entrees- spaghetti with jumbo prawns and the lobster ravioli. I did not like the pasta at all. Tasted doughy and salty. The prawns were very bland. \n\nThey brought out our soups before the appetizer which was weird. Then one of our peppers wasn't stuffed with marscapone like stated. We pointed it out and they waitress confirmed it was a mistake. So she brought us more appetizers (prosciutto, cheeses, dates) but that just made us so full we didn't want to even eat our mediocre entrees. \n\nI don't mind paying for a good meal but this wasn't worth it. I have had boxed pasta that tasted better."

This restaurant was a HUGE disappointment. I am a big Giada TV fan, so I was very excited to go.    To start the Cromwell hotel is dark, and very empty -even for 8pm on a Friday night .  The hostess reminded me of a typical LA hostess, barely looks at you in the eye, not very friendly and certainly not customer service oriented.     The menu was very disappointing, to start we ordered the soup   Pasta Fagiolo- they took our order, came back and said sorry - no soup left. ( Shouldnt they have known that when we ordered?)  When we continued to order the main course and asked for a few substitutions - it was actually pretty humorous- their answer was No, No , No . They were saying no before we could even ask the question!   They kept explaining that certain items were pre- made. WHAT?    They made it very clear that substitutions were not welcome.   I didn't find any of their menu choices very appetizing, and that was ironic because we walked in with a $250.00   food comp.  I ordered a  mini Pizza -can I get goat cheese on it ? NO we don't have crumbles. But you have Goat Cheese on the menu- NO.\nThe Pizza reminder me of a Lean Cuisine Pizza, that was the exact size.. \nOverall, with all of the fantastic restaurants in Las Vegas, I would pass on this. Absolutely nothing like I expected - the service or the food quality.\nWe left and went to  a French  restaurant, received fantastic service, enjoyed amazing food and wondered why we didn't go there in the beginning."

Much to some people in our party's joy, Giada is on site (Monday night at 9:00 pm) Our server, Frederick, is amazing... he explained the menu and gave excellent recommendations.  We also get a stop - off from  the GM who wants to make sure everything was going well. and not 5 minutes later, Giada strolls in, making JG go crazy. We ask our wait staff if we can meet her, and Giada walks over, saving my arm from an eminent bruising from getting hit by my friend and her repeating \"Giada's HERE!!!! Giada's HERE!!!!\" After the chef siting and picture taking we were treated to Giada's best and a very pleasing appetizer round. This meal is in rounds... A marathon, not a sprint, so pace yourself if you want the full experience. \n\nWe had one each from all the appetizers from each category, and for dinner had the porterhouse for two, spaghetti, tortellini. Margaretta pizza, calamari, meatballs, prosciutto, and bruschetta and mushrooms were all wonderful. All offerings were perfectly prepared, tortellini was perfect sauce, not too too.. just right and porterhouse was seasoned just right.\n\nIf you make it to Vegas, stop by Giada's and have one of the best meals you will ever have in Vegas! That's amore!!!!"

The waiter barely took time to stop by our table to check on us and we had to flag him down to point out our missing food & the vegan issue. We ordered desserts but again had to get the waiter's attention.  The check came about 20\" AFTER having to get the waiter's attention and ask him for it. We wanted to do a lunch there, not spend the afternoon!  Perhaps it will get better with time but right now, it is over priced and under organized. I'm hoping it will as I love watching Giada  on the various TV shows and truly love her recipes. I plan to give it another try in a few months assuming reviews are positive."

Don't get me wrong I don't need a Cheesecake Factory dictionary sized menu, but something more than pizza and salads would be nice. It's winter and they have grilled cheese but not even a soup to go with it... when I asked for a soup the server said \"Giada hasn't approved it yet.\" Uhm ok. I don't want to make a negative review, nothing was terrible, but three stars pretty much sums it up. We had the antipasto platter and it was alright. Very little meat for a large platter... you're buying bread and a few olives and a mixture of some sort and enough cheese for 2 mice. Most of us got pizzas (carbonara and one other I can't remember) and they were a lot of bread and little flavor. Bottom line is that it was a pretty pricy lunch and I would have been just as satisfied with Olive Garden and a bit more full. Maybe dinner is where it's at with this place?"

            "review": "I'm a little torn about this one folks.  I've always enjoyed watching Giada De Laurentiis' shows on Food Network so I couldn't be anymore happier when the chef decided to have her first ever restaurant in Las Vegas.  Too bad celebrity chef restaurants usually don't live up to the hype due to such high expectations and sadly, this one's no exception.\n\nThe restaurant itself has a nice ambiance. Despite of the tables being so close to each other, details throughout made it feel as if we were dining at home so it wasn't too awkward/uncomfortable being seated less than a foot away from other guests.  If I were to do it again, I'd certainly do what Phillip T. recommends on his review and request for a premium table overlooking Bellagio or Caesar's Palace no matter how long it takes.\n\nFood in general was good.  Looking back, however, portions were relatively small considering of how much they're charging for each dish.  This surely isn't your rustic Italian joint where you can get large bowls of pasta that can feed a whole town!    \n\nUpon ordering, our server brought out a complimentary platter of breadsticks, rosemary focaccia and cheese crisps as well as several accoutrements.  Several antipasti plates then followed which quickly filled our table.  Few favorites include charred octopus, wood roasted mushrooms and Prosciutto di Parma.  The Parmigiano-Reggiano was also good especially when eaten with the wild-sage honey and rosemary focaccia.  I say skip the burrata since texture was quite unpleasant instead of that smooth consistency everyone has been accustomed to.\n\nI opted for the risotto as my main entree since I'm a sucker for creamy pearls of rice prepared w/ tasty seafood broth.  Unfortunately, what was served was rather disappointing: rice was underdone and seasoning was lacking.  Although the scallops were perfectly cooked, I actually would've never thought the dish came with crabs if it weren't for the menu listing the item as one of its ingredients.\n\nWhile my food was completely amiss, her spaghetti, on the other hand, was easily one of the few highlights of the night.  In fact, I'd pick this over your regular meatball and marinara pasta any day.  One thing that caught my attention as soon as the dish was placed on the table was how enormous the prawns were.  The lemon and basil sauce also went really well with the pasta.  If I could eat this everyday, I absolutely would in a heartbeat!\n\nService was great and staff knowledgeable of everything on the menu.  Forgot his name but I'm assuming our server was fairly new since he was getting plenty of complaints from other guests.  He even charged our card with someone else's tab; making us wait for some time and not even a dessert was given to compensate for his mistake.\n\nOverall, Giada has become one of the hottest restaurant in the valley as people continue to flock to this joint even after several months of being open.  Having said that, nothing jumps out of our dining experience that makes me want to come back at this establishment anytime soon."

We somehow managed to get a reservation the same day that we called, so we were able to have a nice, late dinner.\n\nThey had a great drink selection, with signature cocktails, craft beers and some amazing wines. To start, I got a beer. \nFor appetizers, we had bread and burrata. The bread was amazing and freshly baked in a small cast iron skillet. The burrata was creamy and came with a balsamic sea salt. It melted in your mouth, the way burrata should.\n\nSince our reservation was so late, we had already eaten a bit, so were not terribly hungry. I wish I was, because the tasting menu (I think it had 3 or 4 courses) looked amazing.  Instead, my sister got the spaghetti, which she loved. The shrimp were perfectly cooked. Our extremely picky friend ordered the spaghetti, but he wanted it with a red sauce. And he loved it, so much so that he ordered a plate to go as well. Since it was a special request, I anticipated some push back from our server, but there was none.  I ordered the risotto, which was rich and creamy and had an amazing crab flavor (as well as crab chunks). The scallops on top were perfectly cooked. \n\nTo finish off the meal, we had an amazing dessert with mascarpone or ricotta and topped with an amazing strawberry jam. I wish I remember what exactly it was. It was amazing, and we ordered two more desserts to go. \n\nOverall, an amazing dining experience. The d\u00e9cor was amazing. The service was amazing. And the food was amazing. I will definitely be back to try the tasting menu."

Large windows wrap the entire corner and give a panoramic view never before seen in Vegas.\nThe interior is beautiful with indirect lighting that makes everyone look great and sets the mood for a wonderful evening. The chairs are comfortable and encourage a leisurely evening.\nStart with a specialty Italian inspired cocktail, not seen on many menus. Beautifully presented and delicious! \nFor starters, the Antipasti selection is amazing. We totally enjoyed the marinated olives, baby sweet peppers,the soppressata (with garlic and pepper)and the parmigiano-Reggiano with wild sage honey was exquisite!\nFabulous bread is baked and served in a mini dutch oven alongside Sea Salt and basil aoli and capers and chili flakes and silky soft butter. \nWe shared the rack of lamb- mustard crusted and the Pappardelle with pork ragout (not usually seen) and both were to perfection!\nFor dessert we had the limoncello souffle with house made buttermilk ice cream and lemon hazelnut cake tower with lemon curd on top .Both desserts rank among the most delicious desserts I have eaten in a restaurant.\nDo not miss trying the lemon ricotta cookies topped with lemon glaze, an absolute must! \nCarissa and Greisy  are doing a remarkable job making this restaurant a Not To Miss destination while in Vegas. Personable and professional and friendly, these two know how to run an outstanding Italian eatery.\nDo not miss the opportunity to experience this magical environment, it does not exist many places these days.\nI look forward to many future visits.\nJeff Z."

The I ordered the olives-that's all you get I don't mind spending $90 for lunch in Vegas if it's worth it and this place isn't when I walked out of this placed I cried because I was so sad"

The amazingly cramped table for two, the indifferent service and the menu turned us off right from the start. The only thing Italian about the menu is the pasta course, and you get only four ounces of pasta for around $30. We're willing to mortgage the house for good food, but you can't feed a gerbil on four ounces. The main course selections are four meat dishes. Nothing Italian there: steak, pork, etc. When we told the person we took to be the lead waiter that we couldn't drink anything alcoholic, he turned around and vanished, and we were left sitting there alone for the next 15 minutes. If you've seen the restaurant scene from \"LA Story,\" you'll get the idea. I guess that's why they call it \"California\" Italian."

We love Giada and really looked forward to this experience.  \nFirst - didn't like the use if the ipad.  \n\nAlso, didn't understand the family style dinner for $120 with a signed picture of Giada.  Just thought that was being too commercial. \n\nFood is good but WAY overpriced even for Vegas for what you get.  We had the chicken marsala  meatballs, burrata,  ricotta crostini, lemon pasta with shrimp and the salmon.  All were good but definitely not worth the prices charged.  Really no standouts here. \n\nOverall our service was great..didn't have any issues with the wait staff on timing of meal and service.   Hostesses were great.\n\nProbably will not go back but glad we tried."

We ordered drinks (a cider and sangria). Both were tasty and well-presented. There's a lot of ice in the sangria however, so there's not much sangria to drink. We also had them bring a Waldorf salad, and it came before we'd had more than a couple sips of our drinks, then the entr\u00e9es (the grilled cheese sandwich and a lobster roll) arrived almost immediately. They were pretty good. It was not the dining experience we expected. Far too rushed. Then it was time for dessert. Tiramisu, and the gelato/sorbet were delicious, but where was the espresso and cappuccino we ordered? It came well after the desserts ... and we kind of expected them to be hot drinks. Not so. Then it was time to pay. $115 plus tip. Years ago they would have called this yuppie food. Both the service and food paled against the dinner we had at Hugo's Cellar a couple nights before, for $135 plus tip."

BUT THERES ONLY ONE PASTA DISH ON THE MENU. ONE. I really felt that the menu is lacking in many ways. this is vegas, we don't come here for salads and sandwiches for lunch, especially if we're already willing to pay the price to eat at Giada. Nevertheless, my sandwich was pretty good, I subbed out the fontina for buffalo mozzarella and they were pretty accommodating.  I didn't bother getting a pizza because the portions looks small. my sandwich came with flash fried zucchini, it was interesting but i rather have truffle fries or polenta fries with marinara something."

I would definitely say this is a must when in Vegas ,but I wouldn't think about breakfast or lunch ,this is a five star place and a must ,go for dinner and you'll see what you've missed if you were on the fence .I will definitely suggest Giadas to friends!!

Atmosphere, seating, view, d\u00e9cor, service all A+.  We ordered bread 3 times (my daughter loved it), some prosciutto, lasagna, pizzette  salad with a dead slab of chicken and one soda ($6).  All the food was very tasty, except the chicken, it truly had been beaten to death and overly fried.  \n\nPortions were very small.  The prosciutto was about 5 slices & the Lasagna was about 8 oz.\n\nAfter lunch, they hand you an iPhone, where you take a survey of your experience.  An obvious way the owner can stay miles away and know what is going on.  After leaving our table, my daughter & I watched them make some pizzettes.  They are cooked in a brick oven with olive wood as the heat source.\n\nI understand that I'm in Las Vegas, where a $5 California Roll is $19, but that really was about a $60 lunch, not $100.

Ambiance of this place is incredible, I love they have a photo booth outside in the waiting area. \n\nMy Sister and I came for early dinner like at 5pm so we were able to easily get window seating giving us an incredible of this amazing city of Las Vegas that we call home. It definitely was a one of a kind dining experience, but dining as a local at establishments like this is different than dining here as a tourist. We started with the bread & spices appetizer, & we chose from the large array of cheese choices and assortments we went with our server's recommendation of Imported Burrata. It was light and almost kinda sticky texture but it was good, I liked it, my sister not so much. It has sort of a bitter tone to it, but set off with the pesto on the side. \n\nWe went with the 28oz bone in Tuscan rib eye steak with sunny side up egg and arugula as the main meal and a variety of sides to accompany the monstrous steak which by the way has got to be the real steak and eggs combo Vegas is so known for lol The Steak was super tender! comes already sliced & cut and the meat literally melts in your mouth type food-gasm experience!! All the flavor literally down to the bone. The arugula accompanied the steak well with its unique taste and flavor and helped to not make the plate taste salty. \n\nWe had sides that included Lemon Parmesan potatoes, Spinach with golden raisins & walnuts, and Chicken Marsala meatballs. those meatballs were fantastic! amazing taste, super moist, and just a great addition to the meal as a side extra little choice. \n\nI mean, c'mon though the moment you walk in, and are greeted by the beautiful hostess, you know the place is going to be exquisite. It really was an incredible dining experience, but for the price value of a local, my return will have to be one that warrants a very special occasion where I won't be sad to see the check. \n\nOur service was great, and he was very well informed and answered every question we had about the incredible amount of choices on the menu. Giada's does offer a pairing or tasting menu that gives you small servings from every part of her menu along with recipes & an autographed photo with the purchase but the tasting menu has to be bought per person, but just for the entire table, I will have to have a go at that one day... one day. \n\nAlthough it was an amazing dining experience, Im not so sure it lived up to it's hype. I didn't get into the Yelp Elite event that was held here, so since that event I've been dying to go, and I walked away not feeling as mind blown as I hoped I would have been. It definitely has all the makings of a fine dining establishment with the Vegas expectations, but as a local it'll be a big reason to bring me back. but at least I can say I tried it."

So instead, they let us reserve 2 separate tables. \n\nWhen we were seated, our tables were nowhere near each other. In fact, they were pretty much on opposite ends of the restaurant. On the upside, our server was extremely professional and very helpful! :) they were good at refilling our drinks and answering any questions we had on the menu. \n\nI ordered a seared tenderloin crostini as an appetizer and the lemon spaghetti with shrimp. The crostini was decent and the spaghetti was okay. I did not enjoy the sauce, the portion was super small for the price ($34), and the shrimp was so overcooked! I was so disappointed. \n\nOverall, overpriced and overrated. It is very fancy and professional, but I don't recommend at all, spend your money elsewhere, like a buffet. You'll get more bang for your buck. They also charged us for gratuity, which was okay with me, but they did not tell us. In fact, they gave us the option to tip more, so be careful when you tip! Make sure they didn't charge you already."

Great decoration, great location...I mean, the view is killer. Go Cromwell for making this place happen. \n\nThe service was like...an awkward first date. Here me out here; they meant well, they were doing good for the most part, but they interjected at weird times to tell us about the menu while insisting there was no rush. I asked for water and the guy gave me a half glass (of what is essentially a lowball glass to begin with) and walked away after I asked for more :I. I got nothing. \n\nStill, it was overall good service. \n\nDinner...we just sorta ordered whatever. Our server successfully upsold a cheese plate for us that turned out to be on the money (good on him), and he also suggested a pork shoulder ragu pasta that turned out to be quite good. We also did the ricotta crostini (really good) and a flatbread.\n\nNow, all of these were good....but the portions were so spectacularly small that it was like going to a dinner party with models. No one got to eat shit, we just got to taste it. And hey, $\n\nMain courses came out, I did a caprese to start with the short rib. Let me say that they caprese's mozzarella was the best mozz I've ever had in the US. Like, damn. Daaammmnnnn. \n\nThe short rib was also the best I've had, and I always opt for a short rib at any restaurant that offers it. It wasn't as completely tender as described (falls apart by touch...more like cuts with fork after some prodding), but it was still freaking amazingly savory. The polenta and accompanying veggies were a plus. \n\nEdit: TOTALLY FORGOT. Holy shit those cookies are good. Buy them. The espresso tower was frozen solid, but dem cookies man...dem cookies. \n\nOverall, damn good food and decent service. Wish there could have been more to eat."

The hostesses were very accommodating as we were using a breakfast voucher bought from Gilt at around 1pm in the afternoon\n\nFor an upscale restaurant however, the service was pretty slow. It took a long time for us to get water and our menus, which detracted from the experience.\n\nI ordered the salmon cake Benedict which came with 2 salmon cakes, 2 poached eggs, toasted sourdough on a bed of saut\u00e9ed spinach with a side of hollandaise sauce. I though the dish was quite well done, the salmon cakes were flavorful, the eggs were poached nicely. However, since it normally costs 21 dollars, I was expecting a little more from both the service and the flavors. It was good but not amazing.\n\nMy friend ordered the polenta with bacon bits. She said it was ok but not amazing as well. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, the polenta waffles looked really delicious. \n\nWe also ordered two glasses of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. I really enjoyed my glass, but my friend found it to be too bitter and sour.\n\nOverall, this was worth it for the 44 dollar voucher but I would hesitate to go again and pay full price."

I had my birthday in Vegas (all 8 of us traveled from out of state) just so we could have my 30th birthday dinner at her restaurant- I know, I said I was probably her #1 fan.\n\nMy husband made reservations 3 months in advance for my birthday for a table of 8 on New Years Day. We all arrived right on time for our reservation, hostesses were on the dry side- no smiles or warm welcome. \n\nService started off fine 1 star to the server. \n\nWe all ordered cocktails and 3 bottles of wine, a couple appetizers and everyone ordered an entree. 2 Spaghetti's (Spah-geh-tee's) that had shrimp, lemon, basil this dish was fresh tasting with the lemon and basil and filling with the fresh made pasta and 4 shrimp, 1 Risotto's (ree-ZOHT-oh's) with delicious and perfectly cooked crab and scallops, 2 Rigatoni (ree-gah-TOH-neh) that had a flavorful vegetable bolognese, & 1 Veal Chop. Food came out all at once and presentation was on point. 2 stars to the chef!\n\nMy husband AND one of my friends had been in talks with the manager a month before to find out if Giada would be in and to arrange a \"Happy Birthday\" dessert. Our server knew it was my birthday, the hostess knew, it was on our reservation and even on Twitter! 20 minutes after the bill had been paid and everyone was ready to leave, my poor husband had to stall everyone from getting up and had to talk to whomever was in-charge that night and would listen to find out what happened to the birthday dessert. As we're leaving they finally brought out a chocolate dessert. Do not come here to celebrate a birthday-- they won't acknowledge it even if you're willing to pay for it. Painstakingly, awkward and embarrassing end to a hefty dinner. Minus 2 stars. \n\nIn the words of Giada, (di-SAS-tro)."

However, we all had a poor experience beginning with our pushy waiter who seemed focused on turning over the table as soon as possible. The menu was surprisingly limited and pricey. One of the entrees that was ordered was the veal chop saltimbocca. We've all had many saltimbocca style dishes and this was clearly not saltimbocca style. It looked and tasted like a breaded pork chop with lots of fat hidden in the breading and without the sauce that typically comes with a saltimbocca dish. A side dish of polenta was ordered as well which was not the solid form of polenta that we were used to but, instead, resembled a dish of grits. With the exception of the brussel sprouts, the other items were just as disappointing. Another item of note is that, although their wine list is extensive, the prices were three to four times market prices as opposed the two times market price that we typically encounter. \n\nWe went to another Las Vegas Italian restaurant, Canaletto, the following day and had a great experience which helped erase the memories here."

Also for those of you are complaining about price you should check the menu online before visiting. So let me get into the food yes you're not going to get your traditional Italian pasta plates with a ton of raviolis in red sauce here this is a gourmet light new mix on Italian dishes it  was excellent I would definitely be back again. Oh and the desserts are great you need to try the nipples yes the Venus nipples if you love chocolate those are my favorite.

From the hostess that bumped somebody over so we could sit at the bar, to the manager who came over and introduced himself, to the bartender Chris who wickedly and seamlessly substituted the vodka redbull that I originally ordered for the vodka concoction he prepared in its place, to the expediter that explained the salt and chili accompaniment to the bread, service and attention to detail off the charts.  \n\nNow the food.  We only sampled giadas favorite platter, a $50.00 sampling of sweet peppers, stuffed dates, and the antipasto assortment of calamari, ahi crostini, etc., and while nothing was bad, nothing really crushed it for us either.  The bread presentation is a lot of sizzle and less steak, even with the fresh rosemary bread they bake in a ramekin.  Probably not fair to rate a restaurant on one appetizer plate but this was all we ordered.\n\nI was really struck by the attention to detail everywhere.  Servers looking at glasses to see if they needed polishing, bartenders wiping off the side of the glass because a bit of foam trickled down, etc..They have assembled a terrific team, and this is obviously not the case of a celebrity chef just stamping their name on the front door, but a labor of love by an obvious perfectionist who has invested a bunch of blood, sweat, and tears and isnt about to let someone else screw it up."

There are equal amounts of pluses and minuses in my mind....and the fact that Giada DeLaurentis is my fantasy woman (don't tell the wife) makes this review especially difficult, but here goes.\n\nYou need to make reservations well ahead of time.  Right now, this restaurant seems to be the hottest thing around and even calling a month ahead only got us a 10:15 p.m. reservation. \n\nThe Cromwell seems nicely redone.  Leaving our taxi, we walked through the casino to the escalator leading straight up to Giada.  It was bustling even at 10:00.  While we waited, we took advantage of her photo booth-a definite thumbs up!\n\nThe restaurant, like the woman, is beautiful and so......tasteful.  Should we expect less?  Our table gave us a partial view of Caesar's and the Bellagio. Clientele were well dressed except for one party of 4 dudes in shorts, jerseys, and baseball caps worn backwards.  \n\nGiada opened her windows, letting in the cool fall air.  Good in theory, but a few things worked against the ambience.  First of all, the restaurant was a bit noisy considering the beautiful people dining....ahem.  On this night, sirens cut through the restaurant every few minutes.  (We found out later that a distubance had occurred downtown.)\n\nOur waiter seemed to know his stuff and had a wry demeanor I liked.  The problem was his timing was not in synch with ours.  For instance, he was ready to take our drink orders when we were still deciding between a red or a white to go along with our food.  When we decided, he was gone.  I know we could have used the iPad, but neither the wife nor I could get it to go where we wanted it.  In general, everything was a little slow....ordering, drinks, food, coffee, check.  We were always waiting......\n\nThe food was perplexing.  Servings were small, but ingredients were quality.  Tastes were innovative, but not necessarily what I wanted.  For instance, I imagined the Crispy Oysters Rockefellers would be spinachy, cheesy, and bacony, with a rich sauce that I thought would be crisped up somehow.  (My vocabulary is growing!)  Now maybe I'm wrong, but although the oysters were fresh, they were cooked in what tasted like a mignonette sauce (wine vinegar).  I think the crispy part was the bacon.  So it was refreshing and different, but not what I was looking for.\n\nThe same thing happened with her spaghetti with shrimp.  I wasn't expecting that much lemon so the first bite surprised me. The rich. cheesy pasta needs to be eaten hot. It grew on me as I ate and while you might think there isn't enough shrimp, they are quite large and cooked perfectly.\n\nI should have asked more questions about each dish.....at least then I wouldn't have been off balance so much.  I would give the food 4 stars, but service gets only 3 stars for all the waiting......I still love you, Giada......."

The whole hostess area was crowded with people waiting so we decided to leave and walked around for a bit.  We were told they would call us when our table was ready.  We were a little worried about time.  My friend had to work later that day and I had seen reviews about being seated late and service and food being slow.  We decided to not wait for the call and just go back to the restaurant to wait.  To our surprise we were seated right at our reservation time.   \n\nI ordered the Birdie for my beverage, it is Giada's version of an Arnold Palmer, while it was good I wouldn't order it again.  Nothing special, esp for $9.  We started with the Chicken Marsala Meatballs and a Margherita Pizza.  For our entrees we had the Tuna Sandwich with Arugula  salad and Lobster Roll with Zucchini Scapecci.  Both sandwiches were excellent.  I think the Zucchini might be my favorite part of the meal.  I wasn't sure what to expect but it was delicious.  We finished the meal with Zeppoles, Assorted Cookie Platter, Mocha Mio and Cappugiro.  Everything was so light and refreshing we felt great after lunch.  Not tired or sluggish like you sometimes get after such a big meal.

I mean, that view, Italian food and bright-eyed Giada backing it? This is going to be awesome! Everything seemed promising when we arrived - cute photo booth (win!), no wait for our table (we made reservations) and a great booth near the windows. And a super friendly waiter to boot. \n\nAlas, it was all downhill from there. \n\nAfter a lengthy explanation from our waiter about how Giada encouraged family sharing, (I mean, it's on her lampshades as was pointed out to us), we drank the kool-aid and decided to order her intended-for-sharing antipasti plates. They came out in laughably minuscule portions. Unless your family hates food, these sharing plates are NOT family sized by any means. Look, we're not a heffer-sized family. But $14-$20 For a tiny ramekin of mushrooms and an even smaller portion of meatballs?! Nope.com. Fine, lesson learned. Onto the main..\n\nTragically, not great either. I ordered the sweet onion carbonara - I love me a good carbonara and this just wasn't it. Lukewarm and small-portioned. Pancetta, cream, onions and tube pasta. Call me a purist, but throw in a pea or two. At least pretend like you tried. The actual plate was hotter than the dish. My husband ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese. Dry, lukewarm and small portioned. (The fried zucchini fries on the side saved the dish.)  but the lobster roll that my dad ordered was delicious. Rich and decadent. (Or it could be that we were all starving so we descended on the poor man's lobster roll like a walking dead hoard.)\n\nGiada has these giant yard-long pepper shakers that they use tableside to much bravado. I don't mind it- it's The Vegas touch. The irony being that none of that badly needed seasoning made it to our table. Our waiter disappeared and I had to flag down another waiter who annoyedly grabbed pepper ( right next to our table) and hurriedly serviced our table. \n\nLook, I don't like to write mean reviews, but when you already know you're going to pay a premium at \"celebrity\" restaurants in Vegas, then those restaurants should try to make an effort to earn your cash. We went to a bunch of restaurants that weekend (Mizumi at Wynn, DB Brasserie at Venetian, Twist at Mandarin Oriental)- and they all far outshined Giada.\n\nI like you Giada - you're cute, you make good food on TV and although you way overpronounce your Italian words sometimes (you're Italian, we get it.), you're likable. Just wish your restaurant was as likable."

The lobster roll and arugula salad were yummy and a nice entr\u00e9e. \n\nThe wait staff were very attentive and were fast and great when ever we had a special request (lowering the screen to block sun, bring lemon for sparkling water). \n\nThey also brought mini Brownies and pastry to munch on. We had so much food and didn't want to fill up on them so we just had a little taste at the restaurant. They bagged them up for us and made great morning snacks in the hotel room. \n\nThe one complaint we had was one of the glasses for the water had a bit of an eggy smell. The lemon fixed that, but it was a little annoying."

While we waited for our table, we started with a bit of coppa, bacon wrapped dates, and charred octopus.  All delicious items!  Drinks were imaginative, tasty, and stiff. \n\nOnce we were seated at the table, it went south.  We ordered 3 pasta dishes, 2 mains,  a side, and a bottle of wine.  the Sommelier was awesome and choose a great burgundy, but the food...it just never came. 30 mins into the bottle of wine, the server checked and said there was problem and it would be out shortly...Another 20 mins and a second bottle wine...no food.  \n\nFinally after an hour,  a chicken makes an appearance (no pasta yet) with a bit of flourish, disappears for carving and doesn't come back.  It's like they were teasing us!  Well we waited for another 10 mins but unfortunately we had a show to catch at 10PM and after 2 1/2 hours at Giada, we only had apps/alcohol to fill our bellies.  The manager was gracious and comp'd our 2 bottles of wine and apps, but couldn't make right our disappointment or rumbling stomachs during the show.  \n\nHopefully this was just opening jitters as it was the first Friday night they were serving dinner.  Really wished I could of tried more of their food...."

The photo booth was a nice touch but probably due to the long wait to be seated.  Once we got seated it then took them forever to even greet us or ask if we wanted water.  I had to flag our waiter to ask for water and get some appetizers in. Amongst 7 women we ordered about 5 entrees and 4 appetizers and everything but the fattoh and rib eye steak was tasteless and not very good especially the risotto which I had to send back.  Being I chose this restaurant I was very embarrassed and apologized to my girlfriends for such a bad Taste and experience Giada left in their minds not to mention the money they spend. I literally thought we were getting punked and Aston Kutcher was going to come out but we sure got punked $700 instead."

The orange cappucino, and zeppole's are something you will not find at the feast of San Gennaro.  The food at Giada's are very flavorful.

Unfortunately, had to ask someone who was not our waiter for menu's they were not very prompt on greeting us with menus or water.\n\n They did have an interesting addition to the menu called a tasting menu. Had about a 5 course meal to choose from. Too much food for us. But also had some of her recipes included.\n\nWe order bubbly wine & a couple of appetizers. A mozzarella cheese ball very moist & full of flavor. Also some bacon wrapped dates with a lil'chilly & blue cheese. Very flavorful. \n\nWe all order something different on the menu to try. I had the lobster ravioli, aunt had the spaghetti lemon & her best friend had the risotto with Scallops. All very tasty. \n\nLastly we had all split a wonderful chocolate tart dessert. Looked like a Reese's peanut butter cup. Had a yummy raspberry sauce drizzled on it with blackberry's & edible gold flakes. Just enough goodness to please the chocolate lovers. \n\nOverall very good experience & great food. Definitely make a reservation. Great view of the strip & Bellagio fountains.

The bruschetta has a thin slice of avocado on top, which really kicked it up. The bacon wrapped dates were divine.

Everything was delicious, but the lemon spaghetti was everyone's favorite. For dessert we had a lemon hazelnut tart that was just delicious. My drink was called The Destroyer, and it was delicious.\n\nYou have to be willing to drop about $150/person. It isn't a cheap place, and you won't enjoy it if you try to skimp out.

I expect that if I put out that kind of money that the food would blow me away and at the very least I would leave there feeling full. Neither is the case at Giada's. The portions are insanely small and when you have to shell out $15 for the tiniest arugula salad, well that's over the top crazy to me. It was supposed to come with \"candied lemon\". Ummmm, not a lemon to be found on my plate. I would guess that salad cost .70 to make, at most. The waiter suggested that if you get a pasta dish, you should also get a main because \"the pasta is a rather small portion.\" At $36 for a \"small portion\" of spaghetti with 2, albeit fairly large, shrimp, should really have to pay that much PLUS an extra $50 - $74 for a main? Add any appetizers or salads and HELLO humungus bill! All of this would be fine if you were blown away by how delicious the food was. Sadly was just okay; entirely ordinary. Oddly enough, the best part was the alcoholic beverages that weren't too over priced and delicious.\nOver all, I left there scratching my head wondering how the 4 of us could have spent so much money and still be hungry. Then I remembered, we got there at one teeny tiny over priced item at a time."

The appetizers and desserts were served family style, but the entrees were not. This was a very unwelcome surprise. Had we known, we would not have agreed to the tasting menu. We got to select one pasta and one protein only. Once we realized this, it seemed too late to back out as we were with other guests and it would have been too embarrassing.   That being said, I got the lemon spaghetti (delicious, but an appetizer size portion-disappointing) and my husband got the rigatoni. He felt it was nothing special. We both chose the filet mignon as our protein and I have to say it was fabulous. It was served topped with a pesto that really enhanced the flavor. As for the desserts, the chocolate chip cookie was terrible. One of the worst I've ever had.  I did however like the polenta cake. It was different and delicious.

It is located in the lounge/waiting area. You will not miss it because it says \"Photobooth\" in large print against the wall. So make sure you reserve some time to take pics before or after your meal to capture the memories.\n\nThe space in the restaurant was plentiful and open. High ceilings and tall windows adorned the restaurant. Giada is located on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd so you can get a great panoramic view of the strip. Everything was very clean and fancy; I didn't expect anything less from a $$$ restaurant. \n\nWe ordered the Dolce Vita and freshly squeezed orange and carrot juice as our beverages. The Dolce Vita was sweet and flavorful. I opted for the orange and carrot juice which wasn't as flavorful or sweet, but was an excellent healthy alternative.\n\nMy friend ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese with a side of zucchini fries. The grilled cheese is one of their most highly requested dishes, but it wasn't memorable for me. The pesto cheese oozed out of the panini so if you're a huge fan of grilled cheese sandwiches, you should give this one a try.\n\nI ordered the giada burger with a side of cacciatore chips. The chips were flavorful and crunchy. The giada burger was very tasty but I wouldn't say it was worth the price. I felt like I could've gotten the same burger elsewhere for a fraction of the price.\n\nI probably won't come here again for brunch, but would definitely give it another try for dinner."

Unfortunately I got way too buzzed on two bottles of excellent Sicilian Wine to write my review at the time. And besides, who wants the birthday boy's face stuffed into a cellphone writing a review during the birthday dinner. So I am writing it now.\n\nThrough my haze here is what I recall. The wine selection was exceptional and fairly priced. The restaurant was beautiful and the staff was great. And the menu was really exciting. \n\nWe ordered fried calamari (a must for my girlfriend at any establishment that offer it no matter how upscale); then that was followed by a prima piatti of penne (or was it orccietta) in red sauce; then followed by a rack of lamb in herbs. We split everything. \n\nHere is the issue why this place is not getting 4 stars from me if not 5. Everything was way too salty. That's it. The food was great... but too salty. If food is too salty, then it isn't right. And this is an easy fix. Salt it lightly and then let the guest use cheese to salt it, or even simply sprinkle some salt on it. Pasta with red sauce should be salted lightly, because everyone grates cheese on it, and Romano is essentially nothing but milk and a lot of salt.\n\nIf Giada herself were in the kitchen this wouldn't have happened. But she was not in the kitchen.\n\nOn a really good note - I repeat, the wine was great, and after dinner we had dessert and cappuccinos and both were perfect."

When you first enter, you'll notice all the little touches with Giada's name, from the carts to the napkins. The views are amazing because it faces Las Vegas Blvd. \n\nNow on the the food, it was overall a great experience. The server was very knowledgeable and suggested we order a few of their appetizers as these are tapas style, small plates. We ordered the chicken meatballs, grilled octopus, bruschetta with burrata cheese, eggplant parmigiana, and sausage pizza to start. The eggplant parmigiana was so good that my friend that hates eggplants had seconds. The pizza was also a highlight. The rest were good, just didn't wow us. \n\nFor the entrees we had the steak, lobster ravioli and 2 orders of the Branzino. Our friends that has been there before told me that the Branzino is awesome, and they were right. The skin was amazingly crisp without drying out the meat. The steak was cooked perfectly. The lobster ravioli was a disappointment. The pasta was way to al\ndente. It was hard and made it quite brittle when cutting into it. Even though I can see the filling had lobster, I couldn't taste it. Could've skipped it."

The freshly baked focaccia bread (served right in the pot) and cheese crisp bread were standouts and a very unique touch. \n\nMinestrone soup was good, nice flavors, but, I would recommend trying a salad as there just  wasn't enough soup in the bowl for me. It was also on the lukewarm side. \n\nMain course;  I ordered the Lemon Spaghetti and Shrimp.  The spaghetti was cooked perfectly, the lemon flavored sauce bended well with the shrimp.  Wife ordered the Char Broiled Filet Mignon which was also perfectly cooked.   We added the Roasted Cauliflower accompaniment, which to our surprise contained at least four different varieties of cauliflower, flavored subtly, but, very tasty.\n\nOverall I would rate this one of the better restaurants in LV.

The waiter took what seemed like 15 minutes to take our order even though we had our menus closed for the longest time and was sitting right next to the waiter stand. We looked over the menu and had questions since I had my favorites from my first visit that I was hoping to have my husband try. We asked about dishes and he said rudely he doesn't know what the dish is. He asked if I came for dinner, I said yes and he rudely said we'll that's dinner we don't have it. Made me feel stupid for even asking. My husband and I were already disappointed but wanted to make the most of our Anniversary Lunch. He checked in maybe once or twice to see how things were but wasn't sociable at all, and always w/o a smile. When it came to dessert I again asked about a dessert I loved 2 weeks prior and again he rudely said I don't know what it is, so I told him what the ingredients were and my husband asked if he knew what it may be called and he said I don't know while shrugging his shoulder and again making him feel stupid for asking. We decided We wanted to get out of there ASAP because His facial expression, attitude, tone & comments made us very uneasy, so we skipped out on desert to go somewhere else. What topped it off was how although they knew it was our anniversary they offered nothing as a \"Happy Anniversary\" there was no going the extra mile with service. Even the chain restaurants offer something. All in all the food was good, but it was so disappointing that I raved about my first dining experience here, and when I come with my husband 2 weeks later to celebrate out anniversary we received the total opposite. If I can say anything positive, I'd say try going for dinner. \n** 2 stars because my first experience was great, otherwise it would be 1."

The first few bites of the lemon pesto grilled cheese sandwich were fairly bland. The prosciutto in the lemon pesto grilled cheese sandwich made the dish palatable. \n\nThe best dish of the day for us were the orzo meatballs. \n\nOur hostess kept us waiting as she seated several people who arrived after us. Unknown to us, she was waiting for an opening on the terrace that has a view of the Bellagio fountains. Nice touch. However, I don't think the wait is worth it during the day because the fountains weren't running during our stay and we had to deal with sunlight in our faces. The shades went up and down several times during our meal, it seemed like the people on the terrace wanted the shades down while others in the restaurant wanted the shades up to see the view."

We were on time for our party of 4 reservation, which was set 3 months ago.   My boyfriend and I went to dinner with another couple and we were looking forward to this dinner for months, as no one in our party had been there ( we all live in CA) before but had all heard great things about this restaurant.   She tells us they are readying our table and that we could wait in the bar.  \n\nWe wait in the bar...5 minutes...10 minutes....15 minutes....20 minutes.  All the while, the main dining room that wasn't filled when we first arrived, was completely full.  People kept being seated while we were waiting our turn.  After patiently waiting 20 minutes, we go back to the hostess to see where we're at with our table.  Then she says that she'll have us seated right away.  Another hostess takes us into the main dining room and then leaves us in the middle of the floor while she goes to \"check something\".  She comes back and takes us to a BACK ROOM, with NO WINDOWS and only 4 small tables with even smaller chairs.  NOT the dining experience we were waiting out the 3 month reservation for!  \n\nWe kindly ask to speak to the manager, who apologizes and offers to break up a larger table for our smaller party.  The table we are taken to is still OFF the main dining room, still behind a small wall with blinds in the windows blocking most of the Las Vegas view.  The food was above average, but in Vegas, there is no shortage of superior food.  I do not feel the need to ever come back here.  What irked me even more was that there wasn't any attempt at service recovery. Meaning, no effort was made at all to recover the situation other than moving us CLOSER to the main dining room.  Keep in mind, this reservation was set 3 months ago!  \n\nDinner was good, but not mind blowing.  At the end of our meal, my boyfriend wanted a pastry off the pastry cart, but was told he couldn't have one because those were for the special Tasting Menu only.  THEY COULDN'T EVEN LET HIM HAVE A COOKIE FROM THE DAMN CART!  We were not offered comped dessert, drinks, or ANYTHING.  Not that we were looking for freebees, we spent close to $500 on this dinner.  But I just feel, that being in the food/service industry myself in the past, that MORE could have been done to make up for such a bad start.  I was left with a bad taste in my mouth for the majority of the experience.  This dinner was going to be our big splurge for our Vegas weekend with good friends and it was very quickly ruined.  \n\nThe hostesses are the FACE of any establishment, they create that initial impression.   When they don't acknowledge your presence or at least make initial eye contact with you when you walk up, that sets a bad tone for the whole establishment.  The manager did not even return to our table to check up on us to see how we were doing.  I was dining at Sage at the Aria the night before and my boyfriend only had to look over his shoulder and someone QUICKLY approaches our table asking if he can be of any service to us.  THAT is PHENOMENAL and SUPERLATIVE service.  \n\nOther restaurants I have been to (in CA) would have a manager come to the table to see how we were enjoying our food. I mention that the steak I ordered, at the server's glowing recommendation, was overcooked and not at all how she described.  8 minutes later, we have another steak cooked to perfection and the manager returns AGAIN so see how we like this new steak AND she comps us a dessert.  She easily recovered the whole situation!  And we were left highly impressed by this restaurant and we continue to recommend it to our friends and family based on their phenomenal service.  GIADA'S COULDN'T EVEN DO THIS!  Not asking for much, only some simple consideration for our dining experience.  \n\nI'm returning to Vegas again in 3 weeks and again, my girlfriends and I have a reservation at Giada's.  BUT if this is what I can expect for my money, then I am taking our party SOMEPLACE ELSE.  SUCH A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!"

That was annoying, but not even close to as annoying as our wait staff! After we were seated, they provided us with menus. The waiter then went into his sales pitch about buying the 'all inclusive three course meal for $199. He went on about how you are getting 3 courses and its specialty items that Giada hand selected. I'm like \"woah, an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $199??!!!\" we said no and asked to look over the menu for a minute. Well it didn't end there. Another server came over to attempt to talk us into purchasing the major expensive meal deal. I felt like I was at a car dealership. We said no and then ordered the entree's we wanted instead (which were still at least $40 per entree)... The portion size was barely enough to feed a 4 year old. I couldn't believe it. But the worst part was the flavor. There wasn't any! I had been salivating at the  mouth just thinking about trying one of Giada's dishes. And this is what I get?

Very strong cheese.\n\nI can't say I would recommend this place for the food, maybe just for the experience. Definitely better places out there.\n\nSorry, G! You're still pretty."

This was my last meal in Vegas before heading to the airport. I did not have a reservation so sat on one of the lounge couches. I waited for like 15 minutes and no one came to check on me, offer me a drink , or anything. I had to fetch myself a waiter, ask for water, bread, and a menu. The food here is really good though. I had the Orzo meatballs, Lemon Shrimp Spaghetti, and Choc Budino .\nThe meatballs were just ok but a bit dry in my opinion. \nThe pasta was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the shrimp are two of the biggest prawns I had been served at an Italian Place. Very complex flavors although next time I would ask for a little more sauce on the side. \nThe choc budino had to be one of my favorite desserts in Vegas. It was so light and delicious with a small amount of the perfect finness and flavor profile. I love it and would come back here just for dessert despite the terrible service. \nThe atmosphere here is nice though and they make all the pasta by hand fresh. The vegetables are fresh. \nThey also have a photo booth to take pictures to commemorate your dining experience which is kind of unique. \nOverall ,great food but terrible service."

The bartenders were great and drinks tasted good.  They came to grab us from the bar about 825 and led us to a table with an amazing view of the strip.  \n\nThe waiter was great and very attentive the whole time.  The bread they give you was Delish and we ordered olives and buffalo motzerella to start.  Both very good.   Now comes the issue.  I ordered Veal Saltambucca and my girl got a pasta with shrimp dish.   The veal was basically a fried piece of veal for almost $50 and the pasta was about a big enough plate for a four year old for $40. The pasta had one large shrimp on it which did not smell right and she didn't even eat it.  \n\nNow onto desert.   It was great !   I forget what we share but it was really good.   Had the main course been good this would have been a five star review."

My wife had espresso drink that was very good as well.  We shared some cheese and meats as we dropped in for a snack.  I like the decor of the restaurant.  It definitely has a Giada feel to it.  My only complaint is that the restaurant is a bit overpriced when compared other other restaurants in the same class.  All in all, a place to definitely check out."

I had the lobster ravioli, hubby the veal saltimbocca (dry and a touch burnt around the edges). End result, good restaurant but I would not return. Tip: be an assertive diner. The waiter pushed the tasting menu. We knew it would be too much food. He then recommended we share an app, soup, salad, and a pasta and then order our own entrees. Way too much food for us.

Showed up on time, yet still needed to wait 15 minutes until a table was ready.\n\nWaiter was friendly and helpful with the menu. As a vegetarian, there are a ton of options. Was torn between appetizers and was swayed to the stuffed peppers, with a slight variation to keep them all veggie. Underwhelmed and regretted having ordered them. For an entree it was the rigatoni with a veggie ragu. I was really impressed that this was even an option, almost couldn't believe it. The sauce was great, the pasta, not so much. I had been warned that it is cooked al dente, but mine was undercooked even for that. Literally half cooked, gummy, pasta getting stuck in my teeth. Pushed around the pasta in order to just eat the ragu. \n\nNice atmosphere. Great bread. Good service. Probably wouldn't return on my next visit to Vegas."

Evarr.\n\nFOOD:\nCame for breakfast had the American Breakfast that came with smashed lemon potatoes, two eggs (style of your choice, toast, and sausage meatballs or bacon). Let me just say this first, ALWAYS get the Orzo Sausage Meatballs as the side. SO GOOD. Delicious aromatic marinara sauce were drizzled atop these delicate balls of awesomeness, no joke was like ambrosia (especially after the disaster of all meatball situations at Andiamo the night prior). The smashed lemon potatoes were also amazing as well, gently cooked on a skillet these potatoes are then dressed with a beautifully made sauce consisting of lemon juice, thyme, and parsley topped with a light sprinkle of lemon zest. You can taste every bit of the ingredients used. The microgreen tomato salad was surprisingly delicious and refreshing, I was originally hesitant since I'm not a huge fan of sprouts.\n\nSERVICE:\nOn the higher end of the spectrum in terms of restaurant so general rule of thumb you would expect good service and the wait staff here proved that to be true. Very attentive and made sure every table got their order and that the food was the way we liked it.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThe venue is gorgeous, everything here is so pretty and well thought out. An architectural and interior representation to Giada herself. Light colored wood with white painted walls, occasional splashes of gold. It was very inviting, the seats/booths were all super comfortable. The way the restaurant was built allows sunlight through so the entire place is awash in bright refreshing light. The entire place makes you feel good eating here.\n\nSO. IN. LOVE. With this place........ :)"

Again, we were hungry and ate them, but not pleased. Didn't really want to express displeasure as already \"complained\" about one thing... But with all the options in this city, Giada's left a lot to be desired. Not sure how or why it went down hill so badly!

This is as good as it gets for a true foodie, and the view and ambiance just add to the great experience. Couple of suggestions: if you go as a group of 4 or more, order a bunch of aps, salads and throw in a few micro pizzas (but pass on mortadella pizza, it was only average), every item offers a different taste, one as good as the next. Then pick a pasta to share, the portion size will be relatively small, but good to share as you still need to get to the main course. We had the pasta in a light sauce with 2 jumbo shrimp, I think it is her signature pasta, it is heavenly, and the T-bone is cut into slices at the table and it is one of the largest cuts of beef I've ever seen served, should be shared by the whole table. Throw a fish dish in, and you have it pretty well covered, but leave room for a bite of dessert, they are all excellent. Top end wine list, recommend those in the Rioja section.\n\nRecommend bringing some sort of coverup for the ladies as it was quite cold where we sat. But that didn't diminish an incredible dining experience. It's going to cost you some cash, but most of the great things in life do."

My husband had the Short Rib Agnolotti which he said was Ok in taste but again nothing special. His portion looked like an appetizer for 2 and definitely not worth $28. I get that Las Vegas tends to be on the expensive side but some places actually have tasty food and price is not an issue; here the food does not live up to the hype. As for the restaurant itself it is very clean and nice looking but our waiter was a little slow and somewhat inattentive.

I also had the spaghetti with lemon and shrimp which was excellent. My wife had the margherita pizzette which she really liked. For her main course, she has the rigatoni with the vegetable bolognese which was also really good. \n\nTHE BAD\n\nWhile the food was really good, the service was a bit lacking. Our waiter was attentive and did a pretty good job during dinner. He forgot to come back to the table to ask my wife what glass of wine she would prefer after serving mine to me. At the beginning of the meal, the waiters are required to present a pre-fixe menu at $120/person which includes an autographed picture of Giada. The way this is presented in a leatherette binder is completely cheesy. You would think that he is presenting the Holy Grail to you.\n\nTHE UGLY\n\nWhen we had finished our dinner, the waiter asked of we were interested in dessert. We told him that we were and a guy proceeded to wheel a cart of desserts over. He reviewed the desserts with us and I chose chocolate gelato. Instead of going to the kitchen to retrieve the desserts, he proceeded to scoop out the gelato from a metal container on the dessert cart. The container was not chilled because the gelato was mostly melted and placed on our table. All of the desserts are served from the cart. And the cart is sitting out the entire night near the entrance to the restaurant which allows all of the desserts to come to room temperature and most of the desserts are uncovered all night. It is quite disgusting!!\n\nIf you go here, avoid dessert!"

Or stuff yourself into a tiny girls sweater and hope it doesn't rip........ it was a bit ridiculous, but I lent my friend my sweater so he didn't have to walk back to the hotel in the awful heat. It's ok if he looks silly wearing my sweater, but can't walk in with his tank top? The sweater survived.\n\nHe ended up taking it off because seriously. He isn't bothering anyone. \n\nNext, coffee...... waiter spills cream over the table and 'cleans it' by going through the motions. We did most of the cleaning because he didn't know how to clean a spill......\n\nNow.... food........... \n My fiance ordered 'giada's' specialty. It had the signature 'g'  of her approval.  Something fancy sounding and a 'pizza' of sorts called 'the Mortadella'. It was the equivalent of Oscar Meyer bologna with pistachios on a flat bread. No sauce. No olive oil.  Nothing else. It was clear that this was a pure money grab. \n\nI now know why her smile is so big! Suckered into paying exorbitant prices to what was essentially an open face bologna sandwich. ($15 for the curious). Order for yourself if you don't believe me. \n\nThe burrata? A joke. The balsamic was disappointing.  It needed more, and was a not a balsamic I would've served with sea salt. Salt wasn't necessary,  good balsamic was. This was bad supermarket balsamic. un-aged, thin. There was just enough to make a small pretty spot. Amuse bouche? Rather amuse douche. Excuse my Fench. \n\nWe also ordered the gorganzola with fruit and honey. It was just ok. The honey needed to be much sweeter to meld the flavors together. If it wasn't for the presence of the wax, I almost thought it was store bought watered down honey. \n\nAll in all, the menu was really underwhelming.  The pairings were odd. And fancy names have no description because the Mortadella should be quite mortifying for a restaurant that seems to be so pretentious.  I can make bologna sandwich at home in PJs. I don't even eat this or buy this at home, only to get this here of all places, AND have to follow a dress code for this place. \n\n So we got suckered by the fancy name and pretentious dress code thinking we were in for a treat. But instead got tricked. \n\nDon't waste your time or money. Unless you are morbidly curious about overpaying for the bologna sandwich.  My bad. 'Mortadella pizza'."

Unfortunately the buttery after taste was too overpowering. Then we moved onto the dessert menu and nothing really stuck out.

The restaurant was at the top of the stairs up from the casino floor.  The hostesses were nicely attired in stylish, classy, yet still sexy off-white dresses.  I mention this because the wife liked them enough to ask one of the hostesses if they were restaurant provided uniforms (they were) or something that she bought somewhere in town.  The hostess asked if we'd like to sit at a table by the windows overlooking the Strip (we did), and informed us that it would be a few minutes before our table was ready as the restaurant was transitioning from breakfast service to lunch and some of the breakfast crowd were still finishing.  No worries.  A few minutes after our reservation time, we were seated at our table.  Even though the windows were open, street noise from the Strip was barely noticeable and didn't impede conversation.  \n\nThe lunch menu was an abbreviated version of the dinner menu with the pasta selections being the greatest area of divergence.  We shared the Wood Roasted Mushrooms with toasted marcona almonds & ricotta salata ($14).  In my estimation, it was a bit smaller portion than I would've liked for the price; however, the dish was delicious.  The wife ordered G's Baked Pasta of the Day, which was Lasagna ($24) and came with a small arugula salad.  I had the Tubetti ($24) with caramelized onions and bacon in a carbonara sauce.  Both pasta dishes were nicely executed and flavorful, albeit a bit pricey given their portion sizes.  I'm not usually that big of fan of pasta in carbonara sauce, but this one made me a believer.  My tubetti (which looked suspiciously like penne) came out a perfect al dente.  The sauce was surprisingly light and contrasted nicely with the caramelized onions, bacon, and fresh herbs.  After tasting both dishes, my pasta was the clear winner.  Service was satisfactory as it wasn't memorable, either good or bad.          \n\nFrankly, I had reservations about the place.  I hoped for the best, but was prepared for a disappointing experience.  I had nothing to worry about.  Giada was solid.  My only critique was that I thought the pricing/portion sizes weren't well aligned.  In spite of this, Giada is a place that I'd be willing to try again for either lunch or dinner."

After turning down the $120 per person tasting menu, it became apparent our server was more about pushing dishes on us than service.  No matter what we asked or ordered, he would say \"we needed more,\" \"the portion is tiny,\" \"it's made for 4-5 people,\" etc.  Listening to his advice, we deferred to his suggestions.  We ended up w way too much food.  An example, \"the salmon was really small- too small to share, you'll need two.\" So people listened and ordered more or duplicates.  It was absolutely not the case.  There was plenty that almost 2-3 could have shared after having appetizers and salads.  On  another note, the famous chicken highlighted in a magazine, was not only dry, but an entire entree of it went uneaten- $59.  We all walked away baffled how that was a signature dish when in comparison Costco's $5 rotisserie was significantly more moist and tasty.  \n\nSimply stated, be aware of what you're ordering.  You can always add more plates if the portions are insufficient.  The gratuity was added for parties 6 and up - so our server insured he made what he wanted from our table after denying him the $120pp option instead of providing us the sort of service one would expect from Giada.  Again, a very disappointing and different experience than two years ago, and it unfortunately does not compel our party of ten to return when we were so excited about bringing our them there.  The thing about Vegas is that there are lots of fantastic restaurants to choose from."

My husband and I celebrated our anniversary and everyone from the hostess to our waiter to the server wished us congratulations. \nOur server, Tim, was amazing. He described in intricate detail the meals we were interested in. I ordered the veal chop which was without question the best veal chop I have ever had. My husband had the spaghetti in lemon sauce with two gigantic shrimp. Neither of us could get over how good our meal was. Even though there was no room for dessert, Tim brought us two delicious cookies on a beautifully decorated plate. \nDefinitely recommend this place. Perfect for special occasions. Our waiter only had three tables so we didn't have to compete for his attention. It was perfect!"

We did get help from the sommelier but she never checked back on how we liked our purchased bottle. We made reservations weeks ago and were not even seated in the main dining area but in a \"hallway\" like area at a very small table w other diners pressed up on top of us. I ordered the tortellini and counted 10 total tortellini in my bowl. My husband had the risotto and that was also a very small portion. Both dishes were 30 each about. We consider ourself \"foodies\" who will pay for the fine dining experience and with so many other options out there are sad to say we won't be back. Sad because we love Giada!"

Nice big bar. Started with some antipasto. Cheese and cured meats (aka what the kitchen doesn't have to cook) were delicious. Meatballs were pretty nicetoo. We had the destroyer cocktail (which the bartender said was Giada's favorite) and it was good. Not great. \n\nCons - opened the menu and the pasta are  all translated into Giada speak (e.g ri-ZOH-to). I get they were trying to play on Giada's tendency to pronounce words using an Italian accent but do they really think their clientele is so stupid that they don't know how to say \"spaghetti\"? Eggplant fries were bland and needed salt or spice. Pastas were a step up from an Olive Garden. I had the lemon shrimp spaghetti which was basically a dressed up Alfredo, which was fatty and not worth the calories.  Service wasn't great. Hostess seemed very overwhelmed and were unfriendly.\n\nWould only return for drinks and a light bite. Not worth it for dinner."

            "review": "After a 2 month wait for a reservation we made it to giadas. Note: trying to get this reservation was not an easy task to begin with. Both my friend and myself called separately and spoke to someone extremely rude at their front desk. Like we owed them something just wanting to come there. In the end I called again and was connected to ceasars reservation line and a terrifically kind person helped. Enough about that. We arrived a bit late due to LV traffic Friday at 545 pm. They were very welcoming and seated us immediately at the best table in the house!  What a view!  All things the strip!!! Windows are open in the restaurant. Great atmosphere except a bit loud from street traffic, and the ambulances. But I still loved that part anyway. Four of us went.  We actually didn't order food for at least 1.25 hours later (we were talking so much it too us that long) and the waiter came over a lot but he wasn't pushing us at all. Ordered wine off a menu but they didn't have it any longer!  Shouldn't be on their then and the Somali (unsure of spelling) wasn't great at offering suggestions and made excuses why they only ordered one case of it to begin with. They found something else and she offered nothing to make up for it but the group did like my husband's choice. We finally ordered numerous appetizers. Pizzette (not great at all): some kind of three bean salad (excellent except Baruta cheese had odd flavor): Parmesan cheese (definitely not my favorite but never is): and dates in bacon (loved it and would order that again); the bread they give you came after we ordered those things and I think it should have been brought out when we first arrived but apparently they don't do that and we didn't ask). Frankly I didn't care I loved the tabke so much I could have just sat there not eating at all.  Then we ordered dinner and basically shared.  A lemon spaghetti with chicken (my friend who ordered it didn't love it, originally she was going to order an italian fish and probably should have gotten it): I ordered a tortellini dish with peas, a yellow sauce and pancetta (which we ordered on the side for all things kosher), very good, a whole chicken with a delicious catchatori sauce on the side ...very yummy chicken was perfect, and their lamb excellent.  Service was good and all staff seemed so happy there (but could have been better by the wine lady and even the waiter but he was ok too.  Dessert then was offered at 6$ for each taking and we did,  cookies (choclate chip, a peanut butter and jelly and  lemon iced cookie); a chocolate Grenache (small and rich); something called nipples (my husband had to have that..chocolate inside, with white chocolate on outside 3 small ones); and something the waiter loved kind of like a small cookie with strawberries in top and they called a tomato something or other (not great).  In fact all the desserts were beautiful but in all honesty not fantastic by any means. I forgot to mention the men also ordered cocktails which were recipes of giadas grandfather and they liked those. At one point the manager came over to say hello. He didn't introduce himself and he didn't come with 3 feet of the table. It was weird and unimpressive but wanted to know if we liked the place and quickly scurried away. Anyway the meal was fun and interesting. Dinner ran close to $550 with tip. It was very expensive I thought but for me personally that view was worth the whole thing. Id tell people to go try it for themselves. I really wanted to try it but don't need to return unless it's for lunch with girlfriends for a fun and good atmosphere. You can go there we found without reservation and sit in bar first come first serve. The restaurant was full and maybe we got that table as we asked for a view ahead and are locals. Who knows but if I sat somewhere else I don't know if I would have enjoyed it as much though the entire decor is really nice but we weren't facing the restaurant..the strip the fountains ceasars, flamingo road, fabulous!"

There were parts of the tasting menu that I wouldn't otherwise order but every part was super yummy!!! Stephanie was pleasant & also very very attentive.

The waffles were a fresh perspective...since I normally find most waffles bland these were a nice change...& the cacciatori had multiple levels of flavor.... for dessert I had the Lemoncillo Souffle...which was to die for (perhaps consider using the Raspberry gelato from the cookie dessert for more depth?)

When we arrived at 6:50 for our 7:00 reservation we were told that it would only be a few minutes till our table was ready. Unfortunately they did not seat us until 7:20 which I could look past barbecue we had fun in the photo booth in the lobby. I had requested (a month in advance) a window seat looking out to the Strip, but we were escorted to a table next to the bar away from the main dining room. I asked if they were able to honor my request and they said that the restaurant was full and we would have to wait another 30-40 minutes to be seated over there by the windows. We declined since it was already 7:30 at this point and were all hungry. Fast forward to the service: Our waiter was very nice yet slightly disconnected and informed us to stick with the cocktails on the iPad and not to venture off. The food came out fast and was very good overall and very inventive as you would expect from a Giada \"crafted\" Menu. When it came time for desert we were told we would have to wait about 10 minutes for the cart to come over so we could see the daily offering which at first I thought it was a really cool concept. What wasn't cool is after waiting 10 minutes the cart came over looking very sparse with very little to choose from. We picked a few items out and felt very underwhelmed with the taste compared to the looks. Overall we had an OK experience. Perhaps it was to early on and they were working out the bugs. We will be back to give it another try but I really hope they nail it."

Thanks to Laurent, who is the General Manager, he was able to accommodate a last minute reservation, as I was in town for work, and previously had a bad experience.\n\nI can say that this time was much better.  The food is amazing.  We had a party of 9 and went fairly big.  The table ordered quite a few appetizer platters (all delicious), 4 pasta dishes which were just outrageously delicious, main courses for everyone, and dessert.\n\nEach course was fantastic.  Giada has done some amazing work here.  The pastas were my favorite, and in hindsight, I wish that I ordered that as my main course (maybe 2 pasta dishes?).  For my main course I had the lamb, which was also really good.  It had a mint flavor, and was cooked perfectly.  Most others at the table ordered the Branzino, and they did seem to enjoy it as well.\n\nDessert was amazing.  Many choices on the dessert cart, and we tried quite a few.  My favorite is probably the White Chocolate Gelato.  I have not had that flavor before and I was blown away.\n\nMy only complaint about the evening was that service was pretty terrible.  We had to complain multiple times about the slow service, forgetting of orders, and incorrect dishes.  I think that it is mostly due to us having a bad waiter.  Giada herself came out to say hello and help rectify the situation.  Giada did not apologize for the service, and chalked it up to being open for 6 weeks.  I found it understandable.  Giada took a couple pictures with us, and was there quite late. They helped rectify the bad service by providing free dessert (and even telling us before we ordered it).  I found the fact that they accepted the criticism well, and responded appropriately very good.  Giada is def. worth trying if you come to Vegas.  Plus, Giada is even more pretty in person!\n\nI hope that they serve pasta at the bar in the near future so that I may return on my own and have a quicker meal.  Everyone deserves a second chance, and I'm glad that I gave Giada one!"

My husband and I were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and my mother joined us for our meal (her treat which was awesome). Our seating time was @5:15, and we arrived a few mins early so we stood and looked at the different pictures and such on the walls before being seated. We were given a tour of the stations and explained what each person was doing. We were seated in the corner, kind of like a little private space, it was really nice. The windows were shut and blinds pulled because the sun just pounds that space from about 5:00-7:00. Once 7:00 hit, they raised the shades so you could look outside. Upon being seated, we were greeted by our server who was very very very knowledgeable about everything. He showed us the I-pad with the drinks and such. Also, we had a lady who would fill our waters and give new plates and such for courses. She was so kind, we warned her we were extremely thirsty as we had played tennis at The Cosmo that day and she sure made her promise of never leaving us with an empty water glass. The general manager also came by to introduce us and to wish us a happy anniversary. \n\nWe choose the following 3 drinks to kind of \"share\" and \"try\"........\n\n#1 Hannibal: Botran Reserve Rum, Maurin Quina, fresh lime, blood orange and mint syrup, Chianti float. It was served in a giant goblet glass with crushed ice. The Chianti float was served in a lime turned inside out. \n\n#2 La Strada: Campari, homemade lemon sorbeto, Bertagnolli Limoncello, Proseco. This was the lightest of the drinks. Very refreshing.\n\n#3 The Destroyer (Conan the Destroyer)\nClase Azul Tequila Reposado, fresh tangerine, orange and basil, basil ice sphere. This was the strongest and my husbands favorite. \n\nWe then choose 3 apps to share:\n\n#1 Wood Roasted Mushrooms w/ toasted marcona almonds & ricotta salata. Very good, great assortment of different mushrooms.\n\n#2 *Rollatini - ricotta stuffed Eggplant & pomodoro. Very small but very good.\n\n#3 Calabrese, spicy calabrian chili, the original pepperoni, pork. When ordered, this was my least favorite but ended up being very very good.\n\n#4 (just my husband) Pasta e Fagioli w/ creste di gallo, cannellini & parmigiano-reggiano (soup)\n\nMy husband and mother shared the assortment of breads and breadsticks as I cannot eat them because of wheat allergy. They were very kind in asking if it was ok if they brought the bread out as I could not have it. \n\nWe then choose 2 pasta courses to share. I am gluten free, so the knowledge the server had about it was wonderful. \n\n#1 *Spaghetti (Spah-geh-tee) shrimp, lemon & basil made with their house made gluten free pasta. It was excellent. I always get worried ordering gluten free pasta as its usually just an afterthought. The server assured me that Giada would not put something on the menu she was not confident was the best. Let me tell you this was the best gluten free pasta I have ever had. I could tell the time and perfection that went into it. That night, the gluten free pasta was a bucatini. \n\n#2 Risotto (ree-ZOHT-oh) crab & scallops. The scallops were amazing. I could of eaten a meal just on that. Risotto perfectly cooked. \n\nWe then choose 2 mains to share. Honestly, if I went again, I would just order more apps and pasta courses and skip mains. Don't get me wrong, the mains were very good but I just really loved the apps and pastas.\n\n#1 Branzino, w/ tangerine vinaigrette. Very good and very fresh. \n\n#2 Whole Roasted Chicken for two, cacciatore style. Beautiful presentation before actually cutting it up and serving. Chicken had a spicy rub and the sauce made from the veggies roasted with the chicken were good. \n\n\nAll night we watched this poor desert guy push his cart around trying to not to take people out. Its a cool idea but really seems like it gets in the way. His cart was parked by us and they switched the cookies out 3 times during our 2 hours. Kind of seems like a waste, I hope they give those cookies to the food pantry or something. They presented us with a plate that said happy anniversary written in chocolate and we choose a very good strawberry sorbet to share. \n\nAll in all I would say Giada's was a wonderful experience and one I will never forget. It was a very beautiful place and classy yet I never felt out of place. It still had a very casual feel and I love how they encourage you to share with your group. It really makes dining fun and allows you try new things. We all decided this would have to be added to our yearly trip each year."

Let me start out by saying that I was a huge fan of Giada prior to visiting this restaurant. we were seated in a very nice private dining room that had a balcony looking out over the Las Vegas strip. My husband, a friend, and I ordered the surf and turf and aother two of our friends had the Spaghetti (lemon / basil) with shrimp. the steaks all came out under cooked (very rare) and luke warm. The Spaghetti was overwhelming with a lemon kick, but is not bad if you are a serious lemon lover. After our food was delivered our party had to ask for Parmagiano cheese and then we never saw our waiter again while we ate our meal. My steak was so rare that I could not finish it. no one came in to see if we had everyhting we needed. one of our friends ordered a side of potatoes and they were never delivered yet they still showed up on our bill. I had one drink with our meal and our total, for my husband and I, came out to $166. In my opinion this was a horrible value for a meal that was half eaten. I would skip this location and go to either Emeril's Steak house or Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. I was extremely dissapoined with this restaurant and it's lack of quality control and customer service. They did serve our party with proseco based shots, but that was way too little too late, the damage had allready been done.  A manager never even took the time to come talk to us, we were not looking for any thing except a little customer service..."

She has such a charming personality and it's such a pleasure to watch her work her magic in the kitchen.  It was great news to me that Giada would open her very first restaurant at The Cromwell, a boutique resort on the Las Vegas Strip, a destination I visit every year.\n  \nIt was difficult to get a dinner reservation for a party of ten even at a month in advance so I suggest you book as early as you can.  When we arrived for dinner, we took advantage of the complimentary photo booth in the waiting area.  We were already off to a super fun start! \n\nThe restaurant is stunning and exudes a warmth that is comforting.  It's classy, but you feel encouraged to relax with a drink (or two).  I started off with Giada's signature cocktail, a delicious concoction that included egg whites and was marked with a G.  The bread basket was filled with home-made focaccia, lemon thyme flatbread and parmesan breadsticks.  We were presented with a dinner menu and a multi-course tasting menu that comprised portions of all her specialties. \n \nBecause the tasting menu was served family style, our group decided to order off the dinner menu.  I had the lobster ravioli and the lemon potatoes.  The lobster ravioli was excellent.  The pasta was perfect and the lobster was delicious and succulent.  I would order it every time.  For dessert, I had a latte and the cookie plate.  All three cookies were tasty, but the lemon ricotta was my very favorite.\n\nOur group had the best time and the service was beyond our expectations.  Our server brought each of us a bit of sparkling wine so that we could cheers to 20 years out of high school.  His gesture was so awesome and made our fabulous experience unforgettable.  Love Giada's!"

She was clearly put out by our shortsightedness and behaved like she would have to go chop wood to get us a table.  Once we were able to be seated, we walked inside the dining room and there were open tables everywhere.  We asked for one of the open tables overlooking the strip because it was my birthday and it would add to the occasion.  We were told those tables were all reserved but they were still empty when we left.  Instead we were sat in an awkward hallway.  Our server wasn't kind or attentive in any way.  I asked for a lobster roll and he said that item was no longer on the menu but the next closest thing were the pork sliders.  I failed to see the similarity so I ordered a margherita pizza instead.  My mom ordered an appetizer for us to share and a salad.  The cheese she selected for an appetizer came as a single wedge of cheese on a plate at the same time as our entrees.  It was weird, usually cheese is served paired with something but it was just a wedge by itself.  We both agreed that our entrees were delicious but we couldn't tackle that big chunk of strong cheese on its own so we asked for something to go with it but our server never brought anything.  As we sat and waited, my mom noticed that the table next to us was eating a lobster roll, you know - the ones our server told me were no longer on the menu.  Also, their server was continuously filling their ice tea while my mom's glass sat empty at the edge of the table throughout our entire meal, it was never refilled once.  We actually had a lovely time because we were enjoying each other's company but it was hard to ignore the terrible service we were receiving.  As we were leaving, the hostesses just watched us walk out, no \"thank you for coming\" or \"have a nice day.\"  They were the most miserable looking women I've ever seen in Vegas."

            "review": "Came to Vegas to celebrate our 6 year anniversary. i found out about this place a week or 2 before we left and told my hubby that he could pick all of the other places to eat as long as we go here for lunch one day. it was amazing! our waiter was a great guy and knew the menu. we got a pizza for our appetizer then for entrees i got the tenderloin burgers with zucchini and the hubby got the lobster roll. for dessert they brought us zepolli's and on the plate wrote out Happy Anniversary. it was all amazing and will definitely recommend the place. the only thing is i wished we made reservations earlier and asked for a window seat. the windows open up to view the strip. you could see the fountain show at the belagio while you eat"

            "review": "The reviews don't lie with this one.  Just like everyone else is saying, the ambiance and the restaurant itself are beautiful.  Other than that, meh.\n\nWe went there for my mother-in-law's birthday.  She loves Giada and was so excited to go.  Like another reviewer said, Giada's name and face are EVERYWHERE.  It's nuts.  \n\nAs for the food, I had the ricotta and honey crostini as an appetizer, which was delicious.  And also $12 for tiny pieces of bread.  For the main dish, I got the vegetable bolognese.  It was tasty, I suppose.  But either the dish, or the Las Vegas tap water they served that tasted like metal, really clouded the dish.  Everything tasted rubbery and gross.  Definitely not worth the money at all.\n\nOur waiter got one of the meals wrong and wasn't very nice about it.  I've been to other high end restaurants before and this one was incredibly disappointing.  I was really excited to go and have some amazing Italian food, but Giada's just fell flat.  I won't be going back and I wouldn't recommend it either."

Friendly, courteous, knowledgable and smart. He answered every question we had with thought. No canned answers. He had command of the menu but also answered every question we had about Vegas as well. The Manager Kyle was equally gracious. A great restaurant elevated by fantastic service. I recommend the arugula salad, mushrooms, lemon spaghetti and lamb."

The bacon wrapped dates may have changed my entire life, the cocktails are amazing, the risotto is perfection, the veal is a game changer, and the lemon ricotta cookies with coffee gelato is by far dessert perfection. Giada honey....honey...you rocked my world."

Loved the salmon, lemon potatoes, and broccoli.  The bacon wrapped dates for appetizer. The portions were generous.  Unfortunately,  I read a few reviews saying the portions were small and had a late lunch. No need to do that. The portions are generous. I didn't have room for desert! Overall,  a very pleasant fine dining experience."

Had the bone-in veal chop and it was terrific.  Lots of flavor, tender veal, just amazing.  Service was excellent and the view is terrific as well.  \n\nTotally worth making a reservation a month in advance."

We ordered a tasting menu which was $45 and brought pastries, antipasto, an entree, and dessert. For that we got salmon cake Benedict, and a Limoncello souffl\u00e9 (one of the bet desserts ever!). We also ordered Strawberry Polenta Waffles, and Scrambled eggs with polenta cakes. Everything was so delicious and I think I could say that I'd rather go for brunch than dinner! They also brought out spreads for the pastries and toast which included almond butter. The almond butter was the best I've had. Not to mention they also have such a nice and friendly staff. I cannot wait to go back!"

We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and while we waited we were shown to the photo booth to entertain us. We were then promptly sat - waited on a team of servers that were exceptional all the recommendations (bacon wrapped figs, lemon pasta with prawns, prosciutto) was beyond delicious- we just ordered a bunch of items and shared family style to get the most out of the menu- I recommend doing that since so everything's so good. The cocktails were also good, always had drink and water refills, staff was very accommodating, friendly, helpful without feeling like they were pushing expensive dishes. And we had a view of the Bellagio fountains :) best dining experience in Vegas that weekend, and many were good!"

We found the staff  -from hostess to waiter - aloof almost to the point of obnoxious and the food tasty but no better than our  local pizzeria. We went there for lunch and ordered their pizza and salad.  For the price it was not worth .\nIt is nicely decorated and has a good view,  neither of which you can taste however.\nWe would never go back."

            "review": "I was really hoping to give this place five stars but it just didn't happen. I liked the experience overall but a couple of things left something to be desired. \n\nWe were  a party of four with an early dinner reservation. The ladies at the reservation desk were accommodating but had pretty much zero personality. I felt like they were all kind of miserable actually. We were seated fairly promptly and our waiter, Diego, came to our table within a minute or so. He was very friendly and gave some good ideas for what to order for appetizers and dinner. We ordered the orzo meatballs and fritto misto as appetizers. They were both absolutely delicious. The meatballs are FANTASTIC and I highly recommend them if you go! The bread platter they give really is delicious as well. \n\nI ordered the lemon pasta with shrimp and the other three dinners were the veal, rigatoni with vegetable bolognese, and the surf & turf. I seemed to be the only one without the food euphoria upon taking the first bite of dinner. The pasta was just shy of al dente in the too firm direction and it was lukewarm. The sauce tasted good but I guess the cream in it gets it to be too thick/dry when it's not piping hot. The flavors were great but those aspects definitely impacted my desire to eat dinner. The shrimp were HUGE and one was more cooked through than the other. I don't typically pick apart meals like this but when you're paying that much for the food, I definitely expect it to be better than a $9 pasta meal at a pizzeria. The portions are definitely small so if you're expecting a big bowl of pasta, you're not getting it there. The surf and turf was a nice piece of filet mignon and one crab raviolo. One. \n\nWe didn't end up ordering dessert. In terms of drinks, I had the Barbarella with vodka rather than gin and my boyfriend had the destroyer. Both were very, vey good. I had an espresso after dinner and it was definitely some of the best I've had. \n\nOh, the only other down side is you're going to leave smelling like you were sitting outside at a bonfire. There's a wood burning stove or something and I left there smelling like I had been camping. \n\nI would definitely go back and try it again. I might do lunch next time to try a different vibe and other menu items. It's worth a trip if you're in Vegas and are looking for an expensive meal."

Our entrees arrived over a ten minute period without our sides.My ravioli was desiccated with no moisture left in the pasta and over cooked lobster. The veal portion was huge and was eaten cold because we were waiting for the last entree to arrive.\n\nOver priced and incredibly average. Good thing Giada is famous, because this restaurant could not survive on its own."
