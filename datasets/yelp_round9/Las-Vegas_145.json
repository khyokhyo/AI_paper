Order the biggest crabs you can for easier picking.\n\nNever had Maryland crab and didn't know what I was missing. Super family friendly too... Every kid loves to smash things with a wooden mallet!

Mini crab cakes were delicious, not a lot of breading. The entrees were great too. I had catfish and shrimp. My only complaints are that the delicious oysters were so small and our server was attending to the entire restaurant, which made for slower service. But the food more than made up for it."

It didn't seem to long before the place filled up and every table was full! \n\nWe were greeted by one of the Brother/onwers, he suggested the lobster bisque and I am a fan, so we said yes right way. We also tried the crab dip on bruchetta. Both of these were specials for the day and both were very satisfying. Big chunks of crab and flavored well.  The bisque was very creamy and needed just a bit for lobster, but we found out later, that was about the last of it for the day!\n\nWe then got a dozen large Maryland crabs steamed with not your Old bay seasoning, but JO Spice, which the owner tells us,  it's Maryland's version. The brown paper came out to cover our table, we were given our hammers and a quick demonstration on how to open them up and away we went. It was a bit of work but the big pieces of crab just melted in my mouth!  \n\nYou should know that there is a bit of \"goo\" that's not very pleasing to the eye, and doesn't taste very good, at least to me, so you really have to clean that stuff away, and it's a little messy but worth it to dig out the meat!\n\nI enjoy eating a meal that leaves you feeling good all inside, and this is one of them! I know I'll be back, the service was great, the food was fresh and very tasty, the prices, a little steep, but, fresh crab in the desert, you figure it out!"

I should've paid closer attention to the not so positive reviews.  The bluecrabs were ok.  A lot of work goes into getting at the meat.  I can tell  some of the crabs were not fresh.  The rest of the family passed on the blue crab after their first one.  Leaving me with the rest.  I had to eat them to try and save face.  We also ordered their shrimp and clam which were also decent but nothing spectacular.  Here in the OC, we have the Boiling Crab which in my opinion always has fresh and tastier seafood.  Overall, the folks at the Crab Corner were friendly.  We problably wouldn't eat here again but do recommend others to try."

Thank god someone made them available here.  \n\nFirst off.  These are the real deal.  They are cooked on old bay seasoning ( which every crab lover knows is the ONLY way to cook crabs. The place reminded me of a crab house on the water back in Maryland.  Complete with brown paper on the table. and rolling rock beer.  Yum yum \n\nOnly have two knocks on the place. \n\n1.  Dropped 200 bucks here.  Two couples eating crabs and beer.  That's pretty steep. \n\n2.  Guys get some friggin metal butter knives so the people from the east coast that really know how to eat crabs can eat without pounding the shit out of the crabs with those damn hammers. \n\n\nGood meal may have been pricey but I didn't have to go 3000 miles to get them"

We got there and a guy (lets just call him \"J\") by the door just asked us how many were in our party, didnt even introduce himself, then my husband asked him if they have a booster chair and he said in reply \"no we don't, we only have a high chair\" in a rude way. So i thought he was just a hostess but then grabbed a menu then start walking away not even said, this way guys or follow me this way.. How rude... So we got at the table. I dont know how we got treated differently at this restaurant because other tables they put a brown paper cover but nothing on ours... Then we have left overs.. Husband asked for a box... Gave us one box for Our left over crab legs and more...AND of course it's not gonna fit in it.. O i have to asked for a plastic bag too.. What an oughful service, the worse ever... I normally doesn't leave but review but you \"J\" you need to change your attitude or better yet get another job that doesn't require customer service... And we were nice to leave you $10.00 tip.. But u deserve maybe a $1.00"

            "review": "I grew up on the east coast and have been eating steamed blue crabs every summer since I can remember.  The clue crabs here are flown straight from Maryland to their steamers.  The quality is the same as anything I have had on the east coast.  I have had steamed crabs, crab cakes, and the crab soup here and everything was top notch.  I would recommend dining there on Tuesdays as other reviewers have mentioned for $2 crabs and $2 beers.  This restaurant is a no frills seafood place with fresh food and friendly service.  For the seafood lover or anyone from Maryland nostalgic for the real thing, Crab Corner is the place to go.  If you prefer to have your crab feast at home, they are more than happy to sell you live crabs as well."

            "review": "This place has been on my radar for a while, I finally made it over!  We were a bit scared when we pulled up and the place was packed but once we went inside we were happy to find out why.  It was all you can eat Maryland crab (they were all about the medium size) The prices change with season but it worked out to be about the same for a dozen for medium size but you get 2 sides per person with it.  So we felt we defiantly got our bang for the buck!\n\nThe decor was all Sea Fairing and Maryland themed very fun and very clean!  The bathrooms were especially clean.  You may sit at a family style table if its busy and you are a small party but I felt ok with it because the condiments made for a nice divider.  The staff was AWESOME!  All of them greeted us when we walked in but it wasn't the fake cheer you sometimes get, it was a really nice happy to have you here kinda greeting.  We felt welcome and looked forward to our meal in a nice cheery environment. \n\nSo as I said we did go with the all you can eat, but beware if you do not eat what you order you will be charged so do so according to your eating abilities!  We also opted to order the crab cakes upon recommendation from our waiter.  They are as he said pretty much all crab and ohh so good!  Highly recommend them...  The crabs are seasoned while and after they are boiled with an amazing seasoning that goes inside during boiling and get all over your fingers and the meat of the crab while cracking \n\nI luckily have been to a Maryland crab place in Maryland so I have had a tutorial in crab cracking but if you have not the guys that work there will help you out and they also have a diagram/tutorial to help you crack them!  They have a Yelp Check in offer good on regular priced orders and beer and wine.  I will be back! :D"

            "review": "Tuesdays & Thursdays have the $2 female blue crabs special. Sometimes they offer AYCE crabs, but you'll have to check their Facebook page for those updates (just called to get that info).\n\nLet's get service out of the way first. It was pretty simple and what's typically expected. We got checked on about twice but what I noticed was that I was too busy eating and it was nice not to be bothered so much. But if you had needed anything, all you had to do was just let them know with eye contact or a wave of your hand. My sister brought up how she didn't like to be checked up on too much so that's when I noticed that we weren't bothered too much. There was a fairly good amount of people when we were there (around 5:45-6:30pm on a Tuesday night).\n\nI grew up eating crabs so don't hurt yourself, people! I ordered 8 crabs with my sister for $2 each and we also got corn on the cob and hush puppies for our side orders. Those are nothing special. Hush puppies weren't too bad but you can skip out on the corn.\n\nThe crabs didn't have THAT much meat (not what I'm accustomed to, at least) so it's just whatever. The experience was nice and I would actually come back. I'm a bit lazy so having crabs cooked and prepared for me is my kind of deal. The location isn't convenient for me but I would drop by if I'm close enough. We actually drove down there just for that today. Definitely worth a return visit :]."

Looking at the menu, we just ordered the pick two combo and a side to go with it for the reason I am not really into crabs, mussells, oysters etc. So far we had crab cake with fries and shrimp, chicken tender with coleslaw. Overall, the highlights was the crab which was my first time tasting it and it was good. The rest are just a mediocre taste that you can get it at Long Silver's for lower price. We paid $40 for two combo with soda. It was kinda expensive for me to be honest because the taste was just okay. Other than that, the manager was really attentive and always checked our table."

But my buddy promised that this will change my mind since they have the freshest crab in Las Vegas. Crab Corner is a small restaurant in the corner of a strip mall. Very unimpressive from the outside. Inside, it is very informal. The wait staff was super friendly. Before they bring out the food, they bring a fresh piece of brown paper to cover the table. You eat your crabs directly on the paper tablecloth. No plates for eating the crab. They to provide a small wooden mallet and a plastic knife to assist in opening the crabs and extracting the meat. We started by ordering 8 small crab cakes followed by 2 large crabs for our lunch. Crab cakes were all crab with little or no filler. It was served with a very tasty tartar sauce. Very nice. Next came the crabs. Our server was incredibly helpful showing me how to open the crab properly. However, when all is said and done, this didn't change my mind about eating crab. It was way too much work for way too little return. And, I felt it was a little pricey ($22) for an informal lunch in a small unpretentious restaurant in a strip mall. Despite five star service, I still can only give it a 3 star rating. If you are dying to try really fresh crab in a very informal setting, Crab Corner is probably worth a try for you. However, for me, I won't be coming back."

I came here solo and in my gym gear (so I was ready to get messy) and got 2 large crabs and a lb of shrimp.  The shrimp was good and the crabs were too!  I've broken crab before so I had my own method of doing things but the people that worked there showed me how they normally do it.\n\nCrab pro tip:  Take a leg or claw out and flip the crab over.  With the tip of the leg/claw flip the tail or bottom shell up and rip it out.  Then separate the shell from the body from behind!  Eat everything but the gills and shell!  And the hammer or mallot thing they give you is for cracking the claw!\n\nAnyways, I found out that this will be the Baltimore Ravens bar on NFL Sundays.  How awesome for them.  Crab \"is greater than\" Crawfish, ahem.  But the shrimp was just a filler.   \n\nSome people didn't make a mess of themself but I did, but I had gym clothes on so I didn't care!"

I've been to a couple crab places in Maryland and was never that impressed. But it had been awhile and I had the gift certificate - so why not give it a shot and visit the East Coast from Vegas.\n\nIt's a small and unassuming restaurant. It has a dive-y feel, but is cutely decorated with crab and Maryland items (ex. Orioles items). You seat yourself. Menus are brought to you. Market prices are posted on the chalkboard behind the counter / cash register.\n\nWe were greeted immediately, had the menu explained to us, and our drink order was taken right then. Very friendly and attentive service. Very knowledgeable too - our server had some great recommendations.\n\nThe menu is rather extensive and includes non-seafood items too. But, of course, when at Crab Corner, you should get crab - or at least some seafood. They have a small beer and wine list too.\n\nAfter ordering, paper for table, utensils, bucket, etc. were brought to us. (No bibs, though.)\n\nWe opted for the Maryland crab soup, boardwalk fries topped with crab dip (it's called crabby-style), 1 large blue crab (they have \"regular\" up to \"jumbo\"), and 1 lb of littleneck clams. The blue crab took the longest and items were brought out to us as they were ready.\n\nThe soup was unique and tasty. Tomato based with basically shredded crab and veggies. The fries were seriously yum. On their own, they were good fries and perfectly done. But topped with the crab dip just elevated it to a whole other level. Seriously tasty! The clams were yum too. Perfectly cooked in a beer, butter, parsley, etc. broth. And the bread that it came with was great too. And then came the blue crab. Thankfully, we sat ourselves at the table next to the instructions on how to dig into one. And wow, I was blown away. Perfectly done and delicious. WAY better and FAR superior to that famous blue crab restaurant I went to in Annapolis, Maryland. Succulent and so tasty! I was so close to ordering another crab or two (but alas, I had filled up on the goodness of soup, fries, and clams).\n\nWe will most definitely be back! Fabulous food and fabulous service. Everything was super fresh and perfectly cooked. Who knew I actually like blue crab?"

I had searched high and low for crabs that were seasoned just like I remembered them from back in the day and I hadn't found exactly what I was looking for until I found Crab Corner. This is easily one of my favorite places in Vegas. I just wish it was closer to where I live! \n\nThe guys that own the place are as awesome as their food is. They're very friendly and are helpful with whatever you need. Good service, good times. Bring a bunch of friends and have at it. Crab Corner has a casual atmosphere that is perfect to drink a few brewskies and get down and dirty with some crabs. Bibs and a hearty appetite recommended!\n\nThis review is dedicated to my late grandfather, whom I acquired some of my writing genes from. He passed away before the new year. I used to eat Maryland blue crabs by the swimming pool at his house in the summertime. I will miss him."

Young Philippine with shaved head promised if we would come back next day, the first round was on the house. We came back the next day... No free round with our purchase but the price was raised! $12 per crab... Supposed to be 7 inch crabs... They were rotten and all under 4 1/2 inches which is illegal to catch or sell. They also sell females which is also illegal. This place is ripping of customers and destroying the crab population"

            "review": "You need to know right now that my Wife grew up on the Atlantic Ocean very near the Chesapeake Bay. Her family were all Watermen. They fished and raked both clams and oysters. Just what do you think she ate every day of her life? Right, seafood. Ok, me too.\n\nCrab Corner food is what I remember from my Maryland and Virginia peninsula days. It is absolutely authentically prepared each day with 'flown in overnight\" fresh seafood.\n\nOur meal last night (Monday) :\n\nAppetizer  -  Calamari.     Fresh tentacles and tube rounds in a light coating. This offering is cooked quickly. The crispy coating is light, brown and in place. The squid inside is hot, tender and clean tasting. Remember, if you cook squid over a minute you get rubber, These folks know how to do it.\n\nSoup:   -   Cream of Crab.     Hot, creamy succulent, and filled with blue crab meat. This is something Libby's Grandma would make.\n\nEntree   -   Crab Cake Platter.     Let's start with the fact that these huge cakes are nothing but blue crab. There are NO FILLERS. They use a very light bit of coating and then broil them. Nothing but taste here. Excellent menu item. Comes with two cakes and two sides.\n\nEntree   -   Soft - Shell Crab Platter.     The best you can get. They have a number of sizes. the three we had were called Chesapeake Bay, MD \"Prime Size\". Crunchy, sweet and juicy. Very \"home style Maryland\".\n\nSides   -   Don't bother to fool with the regular old frozen fried. Pay the extra $1.00 for the wonderful Boardwalk Fries. These are hand cut and fried in peanut oil with a hint of crab spices. Then you make them swim in some great malt vinegar. Just like on the Boardwalk in Ocean City Maryland. I can almost smell the salt are as I eat them.\nMimi's Potato Salad is the home made style that is uses by Mom's and Grandma's all around the Chesapeake Bay. Seriously flavorful, rich, and creamy. The Cole slaw is creamy and filled with that course slaw you want. The texture and flavor is right there.\n\nDrinks   -   Iced Tea was fresh made, cold, and clean tasting. A fine thirst quencher.\n\nWe had no room for desert. I think for my next trip in I will start my meal with a Baltimore Shaved Ice \"Snowball\" with about a dozen flavors to choose from. My Wife did manage to get out the door with two packs of Tasty Cakes. (that's a comfort food from MD)\n\nThe menu is extensive. It is going to take us a while to try everything. You see above what we had on this first trip in. Go on line (CrabornerLV.com) and take a look at their menu. It is extensive. \n\nTheir claim to fame is the \"flown in daily\" Maryland Blue Crabs. They are steamed with Crab Blend Seasoning and the dumped on your table. You just use your mallet and pick to bring that sweet crab meat right on to your taste buds.\n\nMy next meal is going to be fresh single fried oysters and a bunch of steamed hard shell blue crabs.\n\nFor the quality, quantity, cooking, and freshness of what you get at the Crab Corner the cost is very reasonable.\n\nYou want a great east coast seafood meal? This is the place to be."

They also serve beer and have tons of specials; all you have to do is ask what's the special that day.  They're also a great place to watch games.  The owners are from Maryland so the whole place is decked out in MD gear.\n\nWhen I went here, I had eaten crabs before but never whole crabs and I never had to de-shell one before.  Our waiter was nice enough to dedicate some time to showing me how it was done, what parts were what, and all that jazz.  \n\nThe boardwalk fries are delicious.  The same seasoning also goes on the crab if you ask and by itself the seasoning is tasty.\n\nThe tables are covered with brown paper if you order the crabs so you can be as messy as you want.  Don't forget to use lemons on your hand when you're done eating though so your hands don't smell all day!\n\nThis is a great place to go with friends, family, or date night.  I just wouldn't recommend a first date if you're going to get hands on with the crabs.  \n\nDate night seal of approval!"

            "review": "I've actually had two experiences by the time of this review\n\n1st experience was on a Tuesday, when they had their $2 female blue crab special. Service was great and the waiters were nice. +1 right off the bat, they keep your water filled ! XD Restaurant was maybe 1/2 full? maybe a little less (around 5ish pm). not bad. \n\nI had ordered 5 crabs while my other friends ordered 3 more. As one of my pictures (and many other peoples pictures) show, they pour it on the table. The crabs come out on a tray the waiter carries over, and dumps it on top of a large brown butcher paper they place on the table beforehand. They give you a hammer and a knife, and just let u go at it. I've been eating crabs all my life and have prepared them so i pretty much know how to open and eat them pretty easily (granted blue crabs are smaller and require more work). Seasoning was yummy. The texture of the meat was good. and each shell had a decent amount of \"yummy stuff\" that probably only asian's eat. XD The only complaint i have of this experience is it had a slight, very slight taste that seemed it may have not been as fresh? as i had hoped (well this was my first experience so had nothing to compare). aside from that, it was great. it was a very slight taste so it didnt bother me too much. I also had ordered a side of sweet potato fries which were fried wonderfully. great color. crispy but still soft on the inside. \n\n2nd experience was much better. We were served by David. (Don't let looks intimidate you). Very nice guy ! This time was on a Saturday late afternoon (4:30 - 5pm). Got the opportunity to try this place again, started with a few appetizers. First off was the mini crab cakes.. small 1 oz crab cakes, maybe the size of a silver dollar. Nice golden brown color, served with lemons and tartar sauce. Very fresh taste, sweetness from the crab meat. Delicious. 2nd appetizer was the Annapolis Crab Dip. I actually had forgotten to read the description but sounded yummy. It came, already on sliced baguette, but loaded. The baguette was a little on the soft side, had a little trouble picking it up (could have been toasted a little more). The \"dip\" was very creamy and rich, and of course, lots of crab meat. Very heavy but delicious nonetheless. \n\nAs for the entrees, my friend had ordered the Alaskan Cod and fries (she's not a shellfish eater so she opt'ed for the fish). She liked it. She said it reminded her of the fish from Crown & Anchor ! surprising ! +1 for crab corner. The seasoning they used with the fries, was delicious. I'd probably assume its the same seasoning they use for everything else, which makes it addicting ! ! Last but not least, the big entree. Came in a semi large pan. 3 male blue crabs, 4 pieces of corn, probably a handful of shrimp, and lots of clams and mussels on the bottom swimming in probably the water it was cooked it, topped with their very own special Maryland seasoning. I actually put the crabs off to the side and dug into the smaller things first. Shrimp was wonderfully cooked, perfectly seasoned. Cooked to perfection. Easy to peel shells. Mussels and clams were cooked nicely. Of course there's a few in there that had sand but there's nothing really the chef can due, in terms of those types of shellfish. The sand is inside the meat, and the shell is closed, so there is only so much you can do prior to cooking. The corn was nicely cooked, seasoned with their seasoning, once again. Was yummy, ate them all but didnt eat it, uhm, nicely like i usually do with corn, where i can get almost each kernal completely out cleanly. These corn, i just went at it and just mowed it down. yummy ! now the blue crabs. These were actually male blue crabs (can tell by lookin on the bottom. females have a rounded flap whereas males have a point at the end). Meat texture was great. seasoning was great. good amounts of \"yummy stuff\" i had mentioned earlier in the review. NO \"unfreshness\" taste at all this time. Cleaned the meat out of the crab. YUMMY ! so much work, but YUMMY ! \n\nAll in all, the 2nd visit had pretty much made me re-consider this place, and maybe possibly putting it up there in one of my more favorite restaurants now. Everything is fresh. Prices are pretty good for the quality of food you get. Can't really find this elsewhere in the city. Heard they are opening another location on the west side (YES!!! MY SIDE!!!) near Tropicana and Fort Apache. Looking forward to that. But i'll definitely recommend people who like seafood to check this place out. I'll even tell my mom ! she's off on tuesdays too! sweet !"

Ordered oysters on the half shell, a bowl of lobster bisque, sweet potato fries, and 8 regular blue crabs at $2 each. Oysters were small according to my friend. Lobster bisque was ok, nothing special but at $4.99 a bowl fair price. \n\nThen the crabs came out. Fairly small with a pile of seasoning on top. No butter, no lemon, no sauce of any kind. We ate a couple then decided we would rather have butter, lemon...and my friend wanted her special thai sauce so we had them provide a to go box. Well, getting them to go created them going back to full price. Fine, whatever. Doesn't make any sense to me but its only an extra $12 for 6 crabs. \n\nThe crabs weren't of the the highest quality. I've eaten crab in a lot of places, including Baltimore. I was not a fan of these. Almost felt like fast food crab. \n\nI won't be back, and I can't recommend the place when there are so many better options out there.

When Baltimore scores, everyone in the place wearing a Baltimore jersey gets a free crab! That's pretty cool.\n\nSo what wasn't cool? The crab Angela and I got. Overcooked and way too dry. We ordered the snow and king crab. Also got an order of the calamari and hushpuppies. The calamari wasn't too tasty either. The hushpuppies on the other hand, were pretty outstanding. The sad thing is Angela ate here when they just opened and loved it. She was pretty sure it was one of our waiters that was working the kitchen and felt the new cook just sucked. Just really disappointing food."

It gets very very busy on Tuesday so try to get there early. Best time to try to get there after work on Tuesday is probably around 5:30p.m. \n\nI am a seafood fanatic and this place doesn't disappoint... for the price on a Tuesday. I have had better, but those places can be very pricey. Of course there are some that would complain about the \"quality\" of the crabs... but everyone has to keep in mind... lots of seafood is based on the season.  The owners are very very knowledgeable too about the crabs, such as if the female crabs are fertile and will have eggs in them. \n\nThe blue crabs were very good, and the seasoning they use is amazing. I also had their sweet potato tots... and if you have read a few of my reviews, you know I am a sweet potato lover. These tots are very good. We also ordered the crawfish, and that was really good too... and messy!\n\n We were all a mess at the table, so i would recommend not wearing anything that you care for here. Things tend to fly off the table and spray out. =) All in all... very good place. Not sure if I would come here any other day than Tuesdays."

I had a date with this one guy who offered to take me for  the best lobster in town. we pulled into this strip mall next to a Red Lobster, i started to laugh. Red Lobster is a \"high end\" fast food joint, far from BEST anything. then he pointed to the opposite corner of the mall, to this little hole in the wall. \n\nAs i'm a foodie, and am a great seafood lover, i will ALWAYS try a new restaurant (especially if someone else is paying). as we walk in, and i see this place, little more than a school cafeteria in decoration, rolls of paper towels on the table, plastic table cloths over wooden picnic tables, i was wondering what kind of place did this guy bring me to? but i now realize the kitsch of the decoration, is part of the charm of this place, decorating (or lack there of) is a way to make EVERYONE feel at home, and not to detract from the taste of the food. \n\nWe ordered the king crab legs and the lobster (what can i tell you, i have expensive tastes) however, the pricing was fairly reasonable. this was my first time having king crab, and even though i had a difficult time cracking those suckers, it was worth every minute. the lobster was the most tender i have ever had. being from Canada (Ontario, NOT the maritimes) i had never had hush-puppies, and personally probably won't have them again, they were OK, but a little too bland for my taste, reminded me a bit of falafel which i'm also not a fan of. \n\nSeveral months later when my mother was in town visiting me for my birthday, i brought her here, the look of skepticism on her face probably mimicked mine when i first came here, but she trusted me, because she knows how i am when it comes to food, if i recommend a place there's a reason for it. we ordered the lobster dip appetizer (AMAZING!) and again the lobster and king crab. unfortunately they were short on crackers, so we had to share one, not happy about this (they need to restock and have a surplus of these things, only downside of this place that i've seen so far), but the lobster and crab was even better than i remembered, my mother who has traveled the world over, has had lobster in Maine, Newfoundland, and other states and provinces in the east, and she was ready to order a second lobster (which we actually did). this time for the sides i ordered the sweet potato tots (i even ordered some to go after the second lobster, because they were so good), all in all, the 2 lobsters, an order of king crab legs and lobster appetizer came to $86, that is a DAMN good price. the next day, when my mother was back in Toronto, she called me up asking if she could fly in once a month just for the day, just to eat at the Crab Corner, and considering my mother doesn't like ANYTHING, that is one hell of an endorsement."

(don't let his looks intimidate you, he's super cool) I believe he is the manager, and I was able to meet the owner, Mark, who was also very friendly! All the staff seemed very friendly. OH if you're a Raven fan, it's your place to hang out! \n\nWe had some appetizers to start off, mini crab cakes with tartar sauce and lemons, I loved them, they were moist and pretty big for a 1oz size (or I'm really bad at judging size based on weight), and they were all cooked to a golden brown. I'm not a big crab person, but I really did enjoy them though. The next appetizer was the Annapolis Crab Dip, which contained cream cheese and crab meat served on a toasted baguette. This was also delicious! It was hot when it came to our table so we waited a bit before chomping down on this and loved every bite, there were six that came out with the order. Oh the crab dip was a bit greasy too, if you're not into that, then be careful about ordering. \n\nSo because I'm not a big shelled fish person I ordered the Alaskan Cod and fries. Which came out in a basket with a paper, no surprise there, I wasn't expecting anything fancy. I had fries and a corn on the cob as my sides. So I tried the cod and it reminded me of Crown & Anchors fish&chips which I have to say is the BEST in town, so Crab corner can compete with them on that! The fries on the other hand had their special \"Maryland\" seasoning, which I fell in love with! The corn also had the seasoning too, though on the corn it was a bit stronger than the fries, but it was still all delicious to me! \n\nMy friend on the other hand got this large pan, I believe it's one of their specials not sure what it's called though, but it looked like it had 3 crabs, several large shrimp, mussels and clams, and on top of that had 4 pieces of half cut corn on the cob, all topped with their Maryland seasoning. I tried a piece of the shrimp and it was cooked with perfect seasoning and I really enjoyed it, it was very fresh, I could still taste the ocean in it as I don't with prepackaged stuff you'd find in your frozen seafood section at the grocery. I believe my friend enjoyed all the clams, mussel, shrimp, and crabs. \n\nAll the seafood is fresh and they have a Tuesday $2 special on the blue crabs and if you're a Raven fan, they have specials during the game such as every touchdown the Raven's get you get a crab on the house, and if you come in with Raven colors you get a discount on the bill and such. \n\nIt's overall a good place to go to and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family who love seafood especially shelled fish!"

The only thing missing was the river side picnic tables and the humidity. This place gets it right! The hush puppies were delish, the peel and eat shrimp were served hot just like they should be and the dozen crabs were a god send! \nI also sampled the Maryland Crab Vegetable soup and was pleased. It could be made a bit better by adding just a little more spice to it, but otherwise it was great.\n\nTo all east coasters that are transplanted anywhere within a few hours drive of Vegas this is a must go! The location is miles away from the strip, and easy to find. \n\nMy only issue is the lack of any lacrosse sticks hanging on the walls and no Naval Academy Blue and Gold anywhere. Perhaps this Annapolis girl should send some gifts their way.\n\nThe prices are reasonable and about the same as to what I am used to spending on crabs even at home in Maryland. I know some reviewers mentioned price but I would have paid triple what they charged and still been happy!\n\nBy the way the owners are super nice and friendly and it was fun to hear an authentic Maryland accent from someone that was not a character on The Wire or a member of my family!\n\nI will be back!

On Tuesdays, they have $2 regular-size crab and $2 domestic beer specials (I think it's Budweiser).  They offer different sizes of crabs, and on other days, the prices per dozen can be expensive - especially if you can eat a lot.  Personally, I can easily knock out a dozen XL or jumbo crabs.

The special at that time is half off appetizers.  We got down on an 8 piece mini crab cake plate and crab dip on baguette.  The crab cakes were probably 80% meat, and were delicious.  I can't wait to try the large size one. The crab dip on baguette was rich and creamy, quite delicious as well.  Again, lots of crab, not a lot of filler.\n\nNext was Maryland Crab Soup and Lobster Bisque.  The soup had big chunks of crab with Lima beans, tomato, and half a crab sticking out of the cup.  Very tasty, served up hot.  I am partial to bisque and have had it many places, but the only one I have had that was better than this I paid $12 for.  This was $3 (when bought as an add on to dinner plate).  It was thick and creamy, with little bits of lobster floating around in it.  Excellent! \n\nNext was the peel and eat shrimp, swimming in lemon and old bay.  I wouldn't know, but my girl told me it was about as authentic east coast as you could get.  She deftly peeled and ate, while I mangled most those I touched.  Food tastes better when you earn it.\n\nFinally, we had three deep fried soft shell crabs.  Well seasoned, and very satisfying to eat.  As she put it, \"You aren't really at the top of the food chain until you eat an animal whole\".  \n\nGive this place a shot!  If you don't like it, walk yourself over to Red Lobster and cry into your cheese biscuit."

It was all shell and hot grease. When you bit into it all you tasted was crunchy oil. It sucked.\n\nIt was the worst dinner ever and I will NEVER EVER go back.. I wish I could throw up all of the food we just ate; it is THAT BAD. \n\nI could have spent my $35 at the Red Lobster across the street. this place is NOT WORTH IT. please spend your money elsewhere."

I've been here about three times, and make sure to get there on Tuesdays, so that I can take advantage of their $2 female crabs (also males when they have them)/$2 domestic beers special.  \n\nThey also have other specials (dine-in) during the remainder of the week: Mondays - 1.25 lb snow crab legs $14, 1 lb shrimp $14, 1 lb crawfish $5\n\nWednesdays & Thursdays - 1.25 lb fresh whole steamed lobster & 2 sides for $20.  \n\nEven though I've been to some other seafood restaurants in the area, I really like this place. While there's plenty of parking, the restaurant itself is pretty small, so you'll definitely need to come early to reserve a spot.  I've arrived at anytime from 5:30pm - 6:30pm, and let me just say that the best time that I've been there is at about 5:30pm or just around 6pm.  Afterwards, it gets really busy and you'll be waiting for awhile.  Another catch is that the place closes at 9pm...I've actually been sitting and eating after 9pm, but they turn away people at 9pm.  Yes, I'm a slow eater...especially when it comes to blue crab.  \n\nI've had the shrimp and the crab and definitely think they're both pretty tasty.  Growing up on the east coast, I remember making many trips just to get some blue crab in Virginia Beach and Maryland.  While it's not the same, I'll admit that it is a good substitute.  Hands down, their Baltimore-style seasoning is on par when comparing it with the \"real thing\".  For the price, you definitely can't beat this deal.\n\nWhile they do offer sweet potato tots, which I've heard are really good, they now offer white rice, which is something that I do like to eat with seafood--especially with this particular spice.  I also make sure that I have some vinegar on hand too, just for the blue crab though.  \n\nHands down, this place does not disappoint...when it comes to $2 Blue Crab Tuesdays here.  As for the rest of the week and the other deals, I'm still waiting to check those out."

Item missing from order, asked for it, still never got it and had to ask to remove from bill.  Soft shell crab greasy.  Female blue crab, no meat, too much work for no meat.  Crab soup 99% lima beans with no flavor.  Would not recommend nor return. I wouldn't even give 1 Star but the system makes you give at least one."

Was close to home and I was hoping for some delicious seafood. My family loves seafood and we eat a lot of it.  The place is a hole in the wall but we were warmly greeted and well taken care of.   The guy's wanted calamari which I didn't want to order mostly because it was  $11.99 but I caved unfortunately.   It was a small amount of overly breaded fried scraps.   The taste wasn't too bad for crunchy scraps.   The owner made the mistake of asking us how it was.   Silence fell over the table me averting my eyes for a full minute then my husband just let it rip.  Honestly this is the worst calamari I ever ate.  He tried to make it up by bringing us a small order of fried oysters.  The flavor was okay but it was another basket of overly fried seafood.   I wanted to suggest some places he could visit to see what calamari should look and taste like.   2 ice tea's  $4.98 thank goodness the hubby drank water.   My son had fried oysters, hush puppies and onion rings.   More overly fried food but he liked it  $14.99.  Pasta Alfredo  $14.99 for the hubby and this tasted pretty good with lots of shrimp but not worth the price.   I had the crab cake just 1 $16.99.  There wasn't a lot of filler in it but it just didn't taste like the price.   I was expecting succulent juicy crab and it was pretty dry and blah. Hubby got a side of onion rings  $2.99.  Our bill was over  $91.00 before the  $25.oo Groupon.   For this kind of money we could have eaten at a really nice restaurant with delicious food.   I recommend if you have this kind of money to spend go somewhere else.   We will definitely not go back.   Three stars because the service was great."

The crabcakes were pretty good and according to my mom its just as good as the ones she had in Maryland. We also ordered the fried soft shell crab, which lived up to our expectations as well. The sides (fries, potato salad, corn) were delicious because they all had a homemade taste. We were impressed by the freshness of the seafood and I wouldn't expect anything less because they claim to have it shipped daily. The only true thing I would complain about is the table and chairs, although this is a casual seafood place they definately need an upgrade."

It is a little hard to find in the strip mall, but as soon as we got close I was thrilled to see the gentleman outside sporting a Ravens hat in the actual shape of the mascot (akin to the Green Bay cheese hat), a Suggs jersey, and purple and black Mardi Gras beads. GO RAVENS!!!! \n\nThe bright yellow and red walls are a salute to the Maryland Flag. Much of the wall space is adorned with flags, decals, and posters for the Ravens, the Orioles, and the University of Maryland Terrapins. Apparently, this place flies their blue crabs in daily, although they had just run out of males before we walked in. They have beer and crab specials during the game, so my husband was able to enjoy a few crabs (although they weren't very impressive and were on the small side, even for females). \n\nThe cream of crab soup was pretty mediocre, and I kept crunching on tiny bits of crab shells. Other reviewers claimed that there were large chunks of crab, but I didn't see anything like that in my particular cup of soup. Still, we were really happy to be there for the camaraderie. It was great to cheer along with other Ravens fans, and we talked to several people who were either visiting or had moved to the Las Vegas area from Maryland and were looking for a slice of home. We'd definitely come back here for another football game!! Two stars for the food, a million stars for the atmosphere."

Be prepared as this is a place where you get your hands dirty. They put down butcher paper and bring you your food in baskets. She recommended the potato salad with my crab and it was very delicious.\n\nI enjoyed the special $2 beers, more crab than I could ever eat and the drawn butter kept flowing.

Yummmmmy in my tummy these clams were so good and buttery with lots of garlic the best dish tonight! And it came with plain bread to dip with. I would just add some of their Maryland seasoning on there and you're good to go!\n\nLast came my fianc\u00e9 king crab claws and my blue crabs.\n\nKing crab claws were on the fishy side but I'm not sure if that's normal since I never really liked them. My blue crabs on the other hands were so nice and sweet and tasty BUUUUTTTTT like the other yelper mentioned it was so darn mushy! I went through the first one fine but the second one was so damn mushy it was not safe to eat. I told the waiter and he kindly brought out another one for me. The third one was just perfect!!! They should all be like that! \n\nI would def come back and give them another try when they have crawfish in season."

The first surprise was the cheap storefront appearance, as we were expecting a real restaurant experience. The paper towels and plasticware didn't help, but I figured they put their money into their food. \n\nAmongst the three of us we tried the fried catfish, fried clams, hushpuppies, pulled pork sandwich, fries, crab cakes and- of course- the snow crab legs. \n\nThe hushpuppies were fried too hard, but would have been great otherwise. The catfish was also fried way too hard, but the fish inside was melt-in-your-mouth good. The clams weren't as over-fried. \n\nThe pulled-pork sandwich wasn't a big hit (and wasn't especially attractive) but the little container of barbecue sauce went over well, if that says anything. It was way overpriced for being just a sandwich -it should've been half the price. The Boardwalk fries were all right but the special seasoning just tasted like salt to us. We didn't like the crab cakes at all, but appreciated that they appear to be made with real crab. \n\nFinally, the service was off. A couple of orders were forgotten, one order was incorrect, and the two servers, who were both friendly, seemed overwhelmed with being responsible for everything from  taking orders to clearing tables to cashiering. I'd hate to see what would happen if the place was more than half-full.  \n\nThe crab wasn't anything special. I guess there's not much you can do with crab except ruin it, which they didn't do.  It was $19.00 for just the crab legs and no sides, which didn't impress my S.O., the crab eater of our group. So I hate to say it, but we won't be back."

I have had it book marked for nearly a year now, so I was thrilled to have an excuse to try it with friends! I can honestly say it lived up to my expectations in every way - if you are a blue crab lover, you must try it!\n\nMy husband's family has a house on the water near Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. My husband grew up eating crabs from Maryland, and I got to experience to go crabbing with their property last summer. Watching the little crabs squirm around while being steamed to death isn't really a fond memory, but the taste of those fresh crabs is something I will never forget!!\n\nEating at Crab Corner really replicated the Maryland crab-eating experience for me. The crabs were very fresh, and they were prepared the same way as they are in Maryland. I really love that they used an Old-Bay-like seasoning, and didn't go the douse everything in freaking HEAT route that way too many places seem to go. I love tasting the seafood so it kills me when places like Hot and Juicy ruin a perfectly good crustacean with mouth burning spice! The other awesome thing? When you leave here your clothes, hair, and skin won't REEK of garlic for days! I didn't need to take a bath after eating here, so that really rocked! \n\nThe special price of $35 for a dozen was more than fair, and the beer prices were reasonable as well. There were several enticing sides priced at $1.95 as well! MMMM sweet potato tots....\n\nWhether you are from the East Coast or just a fan of all things crab, don't screw up like I did and wait a year to try this place! I will definitely be back now that I know how fabulous this place is!"

The food was delish.  We ordered crab soup, crab cakes and soft shelled crab platter.....everything was excellent.....I will definately be back on my next Vegas trip.....I would highly recommend this place"

            "review": "Sad to report. Inconsistent crab quality. Only 5 of the 13 x-large + large blue crabs that showed up at our table were acceptable. The rest had \"mushy\" meat in the body and legs. Inedible in my book. Not to mention this condition of crab meat will likely give you hives.\n\nDepending on the season, I can buy a live 2 lb. dungeness crab from the Asian grocery store for anywhere between $8-$20. Suffering a pricey $$$ Crab Corner lunch tab on a non-special day will never happen again at this location.\n\nAt $8-$10 per Crab Corner blue crab, one would think you'd expect perfection. Yes, we worked it out so we only had to pay for our crab cakes (fishy tasting - probably leftover day-old crab) and oysters (not good either - read below) and 5 crabs... but because so many crabs were bad and the kitchen fixes the crabs to order, this lunch ended up being over 2.5 hours long. A total waste of our afternoon.\n\nOysters were on special ($1 each) but were ridiculously small. The owner-manager (AJ) described them as being \"Skipjack\" oysters. I'd never heard of a \"Skipjack\" oyster before in my life, and I've eaten thousands of oysters. A skipjack is an oyster boat, right? Whatever they actually were, they were tiny, not even good, and therefore not worth it. And they were shucked poorly as well - little bits of teeth-chipping shell were in almost half of the dozen I got.\n\nI would avoid this location and revisit the Rainbow/215 location the next time."

My mom raved about her lobster bisque soup.\n\nGreat place for our 2 year old who got to bang her own mallet and color (bring your own crayons) on the paper tablecloth.\n\nI'm def a bigger fan of alaskan king crab, but this place is good. I will go back to try the crabcakes and crab sandwich. I'll probably never the get the whole crabs again. I just don't like working so hard for my food. \n\nVery friendly owners!!!!"

The place looked dirty, looks like the place has not been cleaned in a while. It was a place U see on Kitchen Nightmare. My daughter had to use the rest room and could not even make it back there due to a horrible smell that was coming from the rest room. My wife had the clams and oysters and was so disappointed because they use more breading the clams or oysters. I had the wings and they tasted like they were cooked in old dirty oil. Seems to be a theme here DIRTY. The price for a PBR was 4 bucks.... Really it's PPR. For as dirty as the establishment is there is no way in hell they should be charging these prices and claiming they get fresh seafood on a daily basis. The lobster tank had 1 old run down lobster in it. To top this all off their supply of beer is just stacked in the restaurant. The same beer they charge an arm and a leg for. This place needs a major makeover and clean up. The sign on how to eat a crab looked 15 yrs old and was dirty. No one has taken a sponge, some cleaner and hot water to this place in a very long time... We were not impressed. Glad I got a deal on Living Social!!!!!"

So I will present the Even Steven review for your consideration.\n\nWe had a deal from one of the local coupon sites and it sounded great.\nWe arrived and were a bit surprised it was in a strip mall and had a decor similar to several other hole in the wall establishments.  This in itself is neither good nor bad as some of the best and worst places are in similar locations.\n\nWe sat down and were informed the blue crab was on special for $3.00 each.  We ordered King Crab legs, 4 blue crab, and a place of fried shrimp and clams and a cup of maryland crab chowder. For the sides we had boardwalk Fries and potato salad. (Starches yum)\n\nThe waiter brought us our drinks and we watched others fill bowls with crab meat.\n\nThe food arrived quickly ( a positive)\nBut the waiter almost threw the crab on the table as if he was in a hurry to get away. (a negative)\n\nOther people had bowls and butter (a positive) but we were offered neither of these. Ultimately we asked for and were given very small containers of butter. (a negative.)\n\nWe were provided with a Mallet and regular forks to use for our food.  The Blue Crab were small.  We were offered no instruction on how to crack them open even though the waiter was aware it was our first visit. (a negative) The meat we could get out of them was very tasty and well cooked. (a positive.)\n\nThe King Crab Legs were steamed and pre split (a positive) and tasty especially with the butter.  \n\nThe soup was excellent with plenty of crab flakes and a strong hint of crab flavor.\n\nThe side of potato salad is one of the best potato salads I have tried. (a positive) but the boardwalk fries were a disappointment, arriving soggy and flavorless. ( a negative) The crab seasoning kicked them up a bit though. (a positive). \n\nThe fried shrimp and clams were good.  You could taste the difference between the clams here and the fast food ones you might get elsewhere.  (POSITIVE).  However, the portion was rather small for the price. (negative)  We didn't even get wet naps after to help clean up.(negative)\n\nIn fact, overall, while the food itself is good, it certainly wasn't worth what our bill resulted in.  The prices charged were along the lines of the nice strip casino located restaurants but the food portions, quality, locations and atmosphere do not support the price point.\n\nI will say the manager or owner was very friendly with all the customers, the bathrooms appeared clean and even had a sign to talk to the manager if there was a problem, and everyone did enjoy themselves.\n\nWith a great concept, this might have gotten 4 stars with a better price and service but if you like the Maryland crab concept, don't mind getting messy and have a few bucks to burn, you should enjoy this restaurant."

The crab cakes were very filling and if you order it, one is enough. It was majority lump crab meat (crab cake lovers appreciate that). I was so excited for crab cakes I ordered 2 with blue crab, corn on a cob, and hush puppies. I was stuffed but very satisfied. \n\nThe prices are a little higher for blue crab but it's expected being in Las Vegas--no ocean (imported seafood daily). \n\nThis restaurant has two locations. I went to the location closer to the strip (10 min. drive), easy to find. I was surprised to see the store front, it looked more like a take out restaurant but we went in anyway and I'll definitely go back for a meal again."

            "review": "I've read all the reviews, so I guess I was there on an off night.  We went on a Thursday night, around 6:00 PM.  It wasn't crowded, but there were quite a few people there, and one vastly overworked server.  While there were empty tables, we still had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated (another couple waited longer), and another 15 minutes to place our order (the same other couple still waited longer).  My sister-in-law lived in Maryland for a long time, and loves crab.  I've been to Maryland several times and was looking forward to this.  We had gone before on a Friday night and when we learned the wait was over 30 minutes, went elsewhere, so we had our hopes up.  Mistake.  My wife and sister-in-law ordered the crabcakes.  One had french fries and one had sweet potato fires.  I had the soft shell crab and onion rings, with coleslaw.  We received our order about 20 minutes after placing it.  A beer would have made the wait a bit more pleasant, but they won't have a license until February.  My sister-in-law's comment about the crabcakes was that she had had worse (she's kind), while I thought my wife's were a bit mealy.  My soft shell crab came hot, but relatively tasteless; the onion rings might have come from the supermarket freezer, and the coleslaw was soggy (I love coleslaw) and flat.  The tartar sauce had an odd flavor, so we left it alone.  The fries, both varieties, were ok.   All in all, for the above order, plus soft drinks, $60+ wasn't too bad, if it had been good, but with the wait, the taste (or lack thereof), we won't be back."

I have been coming here since the place first opened to eat Maryland  blue crab. I'm originally from Maryland and I consider myself a professional crab eater. In other words ....I love crabs, I eat them all year around, I can crack them with my hands no utensils needed and I can eat dozens by myself.\n\nHere are the reasons why I will never EVER never go back. ....1. The guy /cashier is soooo  soooo  soooooo rude and unprofessional. 2. The guy attempted to pick  an argument with me before the crabs were even sold. 3. The guy knew the crabs were bad when he sold them but chose to sale them anyway...integrity. 4. He tried to lie about the crabs being from Maryland. . . The crabs are from Texas. Texas?? Why advertise Maryland blue crab when they arent.  5. The meat in the crabs were mushy and he had to crack one just to see for himself. As if I was lying 6. Crabs should not be full of water..they know that but  they sell them to people anyway.   7. I ordered a dozen medium male and 2 reg females. The guy acted like he forgot I ordered to female crabs. When I turned all of them over and showed him all males he acted like he was shocked .. he didn't realize he was messing with a pro . 8. The guy tried to make me pay for the crabs even though he knew they weren't any good. 9. Because i wasnt in the mood to argue...We agreed that I would pay for 3 and my friend would pay for 3...although  ....   we ate NONE. Each one we cracked was full of water and one look or feel of the very little (light weight)...real crab eaters know what I mean when I say light weight) meat ..u can tell the meat was mushy.. 10. Even after we paid for the food we didn't eat the guy tried once again to pick an argument by making condescending statements. Once again I will NEVER ever NEVER GO BACK!!!

So we decided to split a soft shell crab platter, crab dip, and fried calamari.\n\nThe soft shell crab was good but maybe a tad overcooked. For our sides we got hush puppies and corn on the cob. The hush puppies were pretty good but the corn was cold in the center. Since it's winter the corn had likely been frozen. It could have used a few more minutes in the boiling water.\n\nThe crab dip was pretty good. It had nice big chunks of crab and was served on slices of baguette. The owner told us it was his grandma's recipe.\n\nWe both enjoyed the fried calamari which was served with a good marinara dipping sauce.\n\nWe got free sodas with our Yelp check-in. Free is always good.\n\nThe owner came over while we were eating to see if we were enjoying our meal. He was very friendly and down to earth. He told us he's been crabbing since he was 15. For the last several years he's been the main crab supplier to local seafood markets and recently decided to open up a restaurant with his brother.\n\nWhen we asked about the blue crab, he explained that the water is too cold right now so the crabs are all staying in the mud, but he's been watching the weather reports and anticipated he'd have more blue crab in a few days. He definitely seemed to be knowledgeable and passionate about crabs.\n\nI would give the food 3 stars. I'm giving an extra star for the fact that this is a locally owned place with an owner who seems very committed to serving quality food.\n\nI definitely plan to return and try the blue crab."

We ordered 4 blue crabs, soft shell crab sandwich and boardwalk fries.\n\nblue crabs- pretty fun to break open up your own crab and dip it in some butter and old bay seasoning. The servers will teach you how to properly crack open a crab.\n\nSoft shell crab sandwich- so good. Honestly I just ate the soft shell crab, not a big sandwich person. \n\nBoardwalk fries- I love french Fries, however didn't concentrate on the taste as it has some seasoning on it. I was more focus on cracking up the crab.\n\nI would def recommend and come back. \n\nThe servers were amazing and so helpful! I wish I got their names. \n\nTip- they turn off the steams at 8:30pm. So get there before 8:30! You need to give yourself enough time to enjoy the crabs!"

            "review": "I gave the Crab Corner 5 stars because of the taste and authenticity of the food. I came to Vegas about 12 years ago from Baltimore and the only thing I really missed about Maryland was the crab cakes and crab soup and the Ocean City fries. \n\nI visited the Crab Corner for the first time today and was elated to find all my favorite dishes just as good as I remember them from when I lived in Maryland. It was like going back in time for me.\n\nThe crab soup was delicious, but it came with a 1/2 of a small crab in the shell in the cup which takes up too much space and I think is something they do in Baltimore for the tourists. I asked for the soup without the shelled crab and it was perfect! My only gripe is that it came in a Styrofoam cup. I would have much preferred a real bowl and a real soup spoon instead of the regular size plastic spoon and plastic cup that they provided.\n\nThe crab cake was delicious and perfectly broiled. It was full of Jumbo Lump crab meat with very little filler. They served it on a hamburger roll with lettuce and tomato. In Baltimore I used to get my crab cakes served with saltines. I prefer them that way. Many people prefer deep fried crab cakes, but I wasn't offered an option. It didn't matter to me since I prefer them broiled. I do wish they offered a larger crab cake. They serve a 1/3rd lb. which is kind of small. Several places in Baltimore used to serve \"baseball sized\" 1 lb. crab cakes. They were the best!\n\nI forgot how good \"Ocean City\" fries were. I guess I just took them for granted until I moved away and now all french fries that I get seem pretty bland. I think the main difference is that they are fried in peanut oil. Anyway, It was great to taste genuine Ocean City fries again.\n\nThey also offer steamed hard shell crabs which I haven't seen anywhere since I left Maryland. I used to enjoy them, but they are real messy and require a lot of effort to pick them properly, especially the small ones. They are also not cheap! \n\nMy bill for a small crab cake, a bowl of crab soup and a medium serving of fries was $26 which is kind of high for a lunch at a very casual restaurant in a strip mall far from the strip. Even though it was pricy, I'll be going back as often as possible. I know how good authentic Maryland seafood is and I've really missed it!"

Give me some crabs and some hammers any day.\nAfter the first night, all I could think about was going back and smashing more blue crabs.\nMy order was simply a shit load of female blue crabs and some corn.\nWhen they brought the crabs to my table, it was like love at first sight.  \nI knew from that moment, my taste for this crab would be obsessive and that's all I would think about until I get it again.  They were loaded with seasoning and served with garlic butter.  Simple yet amazing.\n\nThe next day approached, Vegas was a sweltering 109 degrees.  First thought in my head, \"Today is a good day to smash some crabs.  Again.\"\n\nThis time around, the lust and infatuation had passed and I was able to think with a clearer head.  While still being delicious, these blue crabs are a pain in the ass to open up and eat.  It will take almost $50 of crabs to feel remotely full.  While as tasty as it is, don't expect to get a full belly off these critters unless you don't mind working for it.\n\nService was excellent and it wasn't too crowded.

Perhaps a choice variation to the crab dip option? \n\nAnyways, the negative part of the review comes from the sandwich and the bisque. The bisque was probably a few days old or perhaps just a bad batch but it was horrid and what little lobster flavor it did have was rancid and made me glad there was no actual lobster meat (which by the way their grub hub pay says has plenty of). \n\nThe ShipWreck Po'Boy is properly named but that is only because it truly was a shipwreck for me. Again, the oysters were rancid and cold, the catfish tasted as though it was caught a few months ago, frozen, and then sat around for a week before being fried. Shrimp were decent and the baguette was fine which saved the place from being a total shipwreck. \n\nAs of this writing, it will be hard for me to ever order from this place again given the litany of options in Las Vegas which I travel to and too often for work and play."

Not a quick meal, it's one to dig in & enjoy the company of those you're with. The seasoning on the crab was really good - finger licking good, actually.

The crab cake platter came with two sides...I ordered the sweet potato fries and the hush puppies. The crab cake was just okay. It didn't really taste like crab. Ive had better crab from Walmart to be honest. The fries were very soggy and limp. The only thing I really liked was the hush puppies. They were as another reviewer stated \"legit\". My wife ordered the garlic blue crab plate. After about ten minutes of waiting for her food one of the staff came over and told my wife and our friend that the crab they ordered wasn't good and they'd need to order something else. We were very happy that they at least told us the crab was bad but then it really made us think about if we want to ever eat here again. We got our answer not once but twice! My wife decided on getting the peel and eat shrimp. It was bland and had a funky sauce that came with it. Then what put me over the top was when we got our bill. They charged us an 18% gratuity! For me my wife and two kids they charged us. They also charged our friend 18% gratuity and it was just her and her daughter. WTF!!! Right then and their I knew I was done with this place. I'll bet they charge everyone the gratuity and most people don't even look at their bill. It's sad because I always tip but I don't want to be forced to tip. To me the way they do it it's like stealing."

These people are absolutely from Maryland and know how to prepare crab every way possible! We had heard about it and stopped in for a quick lunch. I started with the crab bisque, which was full of meat and seasoned perfectly. I had the crab cake sandwich for the entree and OMG, so amazing! The service was great and we were treated like regulars. I can't wait to go back and get to crackin'!"

Wear casual clothes, cause you'll be wearing bits of crab and juice on your way out. This is not your lazy man Alaskan king crab, but they are the king of crabs from a sweetness standpoint. Be ready to work for your meal and even though it's hammer time, you CAN touch this. Whack those crabs, take your time, enjoy friends. Don't be shy, look, search, and devour each sweet tender mini, meaty, morsel you can find. The crab cakes, also the best I have ever had. Sure they are small (half dollar size), but I suspect it is labor intensive getting enough of the Maryland crab picked to make the cakes, lots of meat, little filler, devine flavor. Boardwalk fries are made from fresh spuds, and are yummy too. If your feeling crabby, this place will put you in a good mood."

Originally from Maryland, so I know my blue crabs/crab cakes... This place is as good as it gets for a taste of the Chesapeake Bay! I'm so glad we stopped in for lunch before our flight back and even ordered an extra crab cake sandwich to take with me since I can't get blue crab cakes (yes it matters what kind of crab it is) in SoCal. AJ greeted us immediately upon entry. He was super friendly and knew we were in a hurry so helped us out with suggestions, even though I knew what I was getting. My gf and I split a crab pretzel... SO GOOD! I almost didn't have room for my crab cake after.. but I managed to power through. Even the fresh made potato chips seasoned with crab spice were on point. I would have loved to had time to pick a few steamed blue crabs, but just wasn't able to. Prices were a little steep but where else can you get fresh East Coast seafood? It was worth every penny. The decor was totally Maryland which I loved. I knocked a star off because they support the Ravens (Boooo.. GO REDSKINS!) and because they had a South Carolina seasoning on the tables instead of Old Bay (bad form Crab Corner). But AJ did provide me with a can of the OB upon request, so not a total bust. This will definitely be getting a return visit whenever I'm back in Vegas. Nice little taste of home before Xmas to remind me of my family. Thanks AJ and Crab Corner!! Go Terps! HTTR! Go O's! C-A-P-S!"

Upon entering the restaurant it has a divey feel to it.  It's pretty small as well.  We let the guy know it was our first time there and the next thing they tell us is that they are out of Blue Crab.  I checked in to yelp after that and there was a special check in for Blue Crab. \n\nSo I had crab cakes and calamari for appetizers.  They had oysters as the daily special for 1 dollar each.  I finished the meal off with king crab legs that were delicious.  The tab was around 80 bucks.  Normally when we spend that kind of money we are at a fancy restaurant.  Service was ok for a small restaurant.  Would I try it again....maybe....but when I or my lady spend that kind of money it's normally at a all you can eat seafood buffet."

We were the only patrons and the two gentlemen there treated us like royalty...they were incredibly attentive and friendly.  \n\nThis restaurant is located on Eastern & Flamingo.  Their website says \"fine dining seafood restaurant\" but the ambiance there is very casual...some of the tables are picnic tables, they have rolls of paper towels on the tables, and bottled beers.  \n\n$45.35 got us crab pretzel appetizer, a cup of crab soup, a fried shrimp dinner, a baked tilapia dinner, two iced teas, and a side of fruit for the boy. \n\nCrab Pretzel ($10.99)is a Bavarian style pretzel covered with their famous crab dip and cheddar cheese.  The pretzel was soft and and the crab dip was creamy and wonderful.  Not too fishy and not too salty....I could eat a whole crockpot full of that dip! \n\nMaryland Crab Soup, according to their menu,  has \"lots of blue crab meat, tomatoes, lima beans, carrots, corn and onion, flavored with crab spice and served with an in-shell crab half\". Mine did not have half a crab in it...Maybe it's because I ordered a cup instead of a bowl?  I dunno...but I loved every bite of this soup.  I had the flu and it was freezing outside and today I feel 75% better and the soup may or may not have been a magical potion that cured me.  \n\nFried shrimp dinner ($13.99) came with about 20 lager-battered shrimp and two sides.  I chose the sweet potato fries and a side salad.  The shrimp were so delicious...lightly fried and perfectly seasoned...I wish I could eat these every day.  Their side salad was spring mix with onions, croutons, tomatoes, and cucumbers.  Their ranch is definitely hidden valley and I would pick a different dressing next time.  \n\nThey are rather pricey but it's expected for good quality seafood.  Yay! I'm a fan."

No garlic, no crazy spicy sauces... just good ol' tasty steamed fresh Maryland blue crab. \n\nI have been here twice now, for the $2 special on Tuesday and Thursday, and plan on coming back often.

That just goes to show you when I show up all I can think about is seafood so well done! \n\nIf you are from the east coast specifically the  DC area you will love their store! It has a ton of MD items and is only slightly nautical theme, most of it is football etc;  on entering the store you will be overwhelmed with the intoxicating elixir of the nautical gods Old Bay; I love the stuff and knew my search for a local seafood restaurant was done. \n\nI judge a restaurant on its menu; is it full of items or does it keep to the basics with only a few main dishes that they specialize in? their menu is simple seafood and more seafood. If you want whole crabs or legs these are the guys to patronize; If you want the best darn peel and eat Shrimp this is the place to go. \nThe oysters are huge but be prepared, the last order wasn't cleaned thoroughly and stomach contents from the oyster came shooting out as you bit into it and or cut into them;  if the rest of the meal wasn't perfect that would have ruined the meal but my group laughed it off and moved onto the next course.  Just be prepared if you order them they aren't the chain restaurant oysters. \n\nIf you like crab but aren't comfortable with shucking and eating whole crabs don't be scared; the owners and their staff will be happy to sit down and walk you through it just let them know you will need assistance; their idea is that they want you to get the most out of your meal and have a good time so you will tell your friends and return with them the next time. \n\nPrices for the crabs can fluctuate depending on the season and availability but don't let that deter you either. They are very competitive and you won't leave hungry or disappointed.  Anytime this guy gets homesick or is craving Seafood he heads over to the Crab Corner!"

I actually reconsidered my plan to move after eating here. I am not even kidding - but then John offered to ship the crabs to D.I.A. for me and I decided to stick to my plan to move to Denver.\n\nBut I digress (as usual)....this place is LEGIT. TOO LEGIT TO QUIT if you ask me. I went with my dad, who is in town from the MD area, I knew that he would be the one to experience Crab Corner with me. We already knew that we were set on splitting an order of #2 males. But what else to get....BOARDWALK FRIES? Stop it right now. As I bit into the fry, I was immediately taken back to Ocean City, MD.

Can't go wrong price wise!  So how does the food fare?\n\nThe crabs were very good.  A bit of work to get to the goods, but worth it IMO.  I tried the brains/stomach, and it didn't do anything for me....gave them to my friend.  But I did enjoy the leg joints and claw meat.  And for $3 each, solid choice!\n\nAlso, the jumbo shrimp/prawns (head on) are very very good!  First of all, their \"pound\" seems a lot more generous than other quick seafood places I have tried.  Obviously it should be the same, but maybe it is because they are larger and you get more meat than shells.  The seasoning is the winner here...very very good and not super salty and overly done like some places in comparison!  You have to try them!  \n\nThe crab dip and crab cakes were also good, but I felt like they were a little spendy for what I got.  Although they were good, I will probably put that money towards more shrimp and blue crabs truthfully.\n\nTip, the blue crabs are cooked to order, so if you plan on ordering a few at a time, plan it out so you aren't sitting without in between sessions.  I think they took appx 15min between orders, so plan accordingly!\n\nThis will be a regular spot for us!"

Bummer, but OK, that happens, we'll eat something else, although we had come in specifically for the blue crabs. Then the water tasted bad and was basically undrinkable, despite being told it's triple filtered. Bleh. Then my order of 4 mini crab cakes were extremely small....and deep fried. My fault for not asking if they were deep fried or pan-fried, which is my preferred method and the way most strip restaurants I frequent prepare it. So since I was pretty hungry, I also ordered the lobster bisque, which came out quickly and was piping hot. The first spoonful were quite good, with the deep and distinct flavor of sherry. But by the end of the bowl and with the cooling of temperature, it no longer was as tasty. None of this was the fault of our waiter who was quite informative and on point with his service. A friend who has been there many times and tried a number of different things on the menu said she only likes the blue crabs. So now I know, call ahead next time and just come for the blue crabs."

I love seafood but I unfortunately live in a desert, so it is normal to be skeptical about fresh seafood. \n\nI brought my Dad here and we loved it. One of the staff members seemed to be new because he almost placed another table's food in front of us. He was also unsure about some items on the menu. We had the hot crab dip appetizer, I had blue crabs, and my Dad got a fried food platter. The app was amazing and cheesy and I had to not think about the amount of calories I was shoving in my mouth. I personally feel that breading and frying any seafood is a travesty so I didn't bother to sample anything on my Dad's plate. I had a great time whacking away on the blue crabs. \n\nThe other diners were super sweet and everyone interacted with each other. Some were regulars and some were new because of the deal. It added to the appeal to have your tables very close together. \n\nThe only reason why I had to bring this to 4 stars is because I attempted to go here once and it was closed. It was a Monday night when the Ravens were playing a Monday night game. Isn't this place billed as a Baltimore joint? My friend and I were disappointed that when we saw the sign that said that the place is closed on Monday nights during the winter."

We got the mini crab cakes for both of us, I ordered the clam strip platter with boardwalk fries and hushpuppies, and he got the soft shell crab platter with sweet potato tots and applesauce.  The only thing of his I tried was the sweet potato tots--crisp and yummy! He said the soft shell crab was great also, but I'm sure he'll elaborate in his own review.\n\nThe mini crab cakes were awesome! Big chunks of sweet crab meat with hardly any filler--just the way crab cakes should be. The clam strips were some of the best I've had. It's quite rare to get fried clam strips that are freshly prepared instead of pre-frozen, especially out here in the desert. They survived the journey home really well along with the hush puppies, which were nice and crisp on the outside and well seasoned. The boardwalk fries were soggy, but that may have been because of the combination of vinegar and a car ride home in styrofoam. I'll probably get the sweet potato tots like my husband next time we get takeout, but I'd still like to try the boardwalk fries in restaurant to see if they come out crisper because the flavor was good. I also ordered an ice cream cookie sandwich, which they waited to make until we arrived to pick up the food. That kept it from completely melting all over the place, which was considerate of them.  We also got a fresh brewed iced tea, but it tasted kind of funny to me. Not terrible, but I'll be cautious getting it again because I love good iced tea. \n\nAll in all I'd say our experience was a great one--the food traveled well and didn't get soggy except for the fries, and the person I talked to on the phone as well as the one who took our money were both very friendly and helpful. I look forward to returning to dine in restaurant to see how the service is!"

If you're over the buzz of The Strip and looking for a chill place to get some tasty seafood (and other) grub, take a short drive and check this out."

We narrowed in on Crab Corner after trying to find some friggin crab-cakes in this town...not an easy task. \n\nSo Crab Corner has a ton of variety: steamers of different crabs, shrimp, clams, mussels, raw oysters....all the things you'd hope to expect they have. Prices are pretty steep...but I guess we are in the middle of the desert so all that sea-life had a fun plane ride to get to you. \n\nWe did end up getting the crab cakes and they were pretty good - very meaty without much filler. I actually think they could add a wee bit of filler and a few veggie bits to increase the flavor as they were actually kind of bland. They came with tartar sauce which I think is kind of a foul to put on crab but I eventually did anyway since I got kind of bored with it. \n\nI highly recommend the oysters. They're usually $1.75 except on Sunday's when they are $1 each. I believe they are a type from Virginia somewhere...they are the variety with the smaller but deep shell so they're more meaty. Great flavor and freshness.\n\nThe service is awesome! The people there are nice, helpful and friendly!"

We sighed and mentioned we came back for the lobster and he replied \"you should have come earlier\", really?! I ordered 3 oysters on the 1/2 shell and a salad (greens & tomatoes only, with a side of vinegar). My husband asked about the lobster bisque and the waiter replied \"give me a second, I'm trying to put in all these modification\" with a snarky attitude, (was my salad order that difficult?). \n\nWe thought they could've made a pleasant effort to accommodate us and maybe offer a substitute special. As for the food this time, the soup had zero lumps of lobster (only minimal flakes) and it was very salty, the oysters were bland, small & room temperature, but the salad was decent. Our server Jared seriously lacked in customer service. Our experience was the complete opposite from the day prior and I understand the mixed reviews for this location. A huge disappointment!!!! We visit Vegas about 4x a year and thought this may be a new regular spot, but I highly doubt we'll risk a repeat of today by returning."

We found the Crab Corner based on another internet review and, seeing the number of positive reviews posted, decided to go ourselves.  We expected to find a fancy restaurant and had actually called to make reservations (I have to laugh at that now!).  Instead we found this unassuming little place on the corner of a strip mall.  Nothing fancy at all.  In fact, it looked a bit seedy from the outside, but we decided to dive in  and go \"local.\"  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a young waiter in a \"I GOT CRABS IN LAS VEGAS\" T-shirt.  He was very friendly and gave us a corner seat.  The tables were totally plain with a set of condiments for each.  He took our order for drinks and another waiter came and took our order for food.  On his iPhone.  This was in itself awesome--the order was wired to the cooks before the waiter even left the table!  The waiter was funny and helpful, and even photobombed a pic I shortly took of my wife and me at the restaurant!  I posted it to FB right away :-)  We got the crab cakes which, as other reviewers wrote, were some of the best I've ever had--all crab.  The clam strips were fantastic and actually had real clam strips within instead of the usual nothing-but-fried-stuff with a clam residue.  The fried fish was excellent and my wife, a Texan, couldn't help but repeatedly comment how she could taste the beer in the batter.  The portions were not monstrous--they would be normal--and I ordered another plate of clam strips simply because I'd never had any so good.  We were so happy with the experience that I bought a T-shirt from the place then and there. We are sworn repeat customers.  \n\nPS: I was momentarily afraid after we left because I had stuffed myself on fried food, a massive \"no-no\" for dinner time as I then suffer bad indigestion all night long.  Call it coincidence or call it some sort of \"quality\" frying, but I did not have any problems sleeping with a belly full of fried Crab Corner food :-)\n\nCheck this place out and really enjoy the small cafe atmosphere.  You will not regret it!\n\nThanks for an excellent night Crab Corner!"

Be prepared to work for your food and get a little messy!  Have fun! Walk in and the place is simply furnished But cushioned seats. Sports plays on the tvs. Some tables are shared between 2 parties. Paper covers the table so you can eat right off of it. Our server Bryce was very friendly, attentive, and really great overall.  My man drank beers and I had soda. They offered $1 oysters so we ordered 6.  I didn't care for these as they were larger than I prefer. My favorite starter is the creamy lobster bisque. Always has good bits of lobster in the thick and tasty soup.  I don't want any other kind of crab but blue crab when I come here. The bigger the better.  They have a great deal $2 blue crab on Tuesdays. Although I have never taken advantage of it.  It is enough work for me to get the meat out so I prefer as much meat as possible.  The females are great when it is the season for eggs.  I like the eggs and fat mixed in my rice.  Everyone does it different. I flip it to its under side.  Pull off all of the legs. Flip open the shell of the abdomen and remove it.  Stick the knife in the opening you've just made to separate the body from the big shell. Then using my knife I scrape off all of the gills and guts to toss away.  Then break the body in half to get the good stuff!   I save my wooden mallet for the claws.  I take a folded paper towel and place it over the claw before I hammer at it, to prevent flying shells. Sprinkle the old bay seasoning in my melted butter for dipping. Then to balance all the salt I enjoy my crab with steamed rice.  We shared a half dozen of large females today.  I felt they were a bit small for my appetite so we also ordered the little neck clams.   I love them smaller.  The flavor for me tends to be better.  So yumm!  They give you bread for dipping in it's seasoned garlic butter sauce.  Smells good too!  The nice thing about this crab spot is that the smell of seafood and seasonings doesn't linger on you in comparison to the Cajun style restaurants.  Our total for 2 people came out to around $78.  All my friends that I bring here love it. One exception is my girlfriend who refuses to get her hands messy."

Everything is either a fried greasepit or something pretty expensive.  There is some righteous blue crab action happening here.\n\nI tried the soft-shell crab platter and it was tasty. The crabs weren't too greasy despite being fried and breaded.   My parents, being veterans of this joint, knew right away to get a dozen female blue crabs and then do some work on them.  They'll lay the crabs out on your plastic covered table and give you tools to crack and destroy each one.  Each crab is spiced with some spice that is a Maryland specialty (the name escapes me).  It's definitely messy and not very romantic, but as long as your partner is ok with you looking like a fool with crab all over, go ahead and visit.  \n\nFYI - crabs are market price and flown in from Maryland when in season.  You can order males or females.\n\nThe hushpuppies were hearty and delicious.  Fries were ok, but definitely go with hushpuppies for your side.  I also tasted the crab cake sandwich which held its own, but the stars are the cute little blue crabs.\n\nService was friendly and attentive. Lots of Ravens and Terrapins gear on the wall- dude is proud of his Baltimore roots. We bonded over a conversation about Steve Blake, Juan Dixon, and the last Maryland CBB championship."

There was a large party that was just being seated.  I think they accept reservations, so I would recommend making one before you go.  There was no sign up sheet, but the owners and crew knew the order and offered us seats, while we waited.\n\nThe customer service was excellent and with that alone, they would get 5 stars.  My wife said they get 10 in her book.  They were very attentive and helped us with the menu, since it was our first time there.  When the crab came, they showed us how to open the crab up and tricks to get the meat.  We already knew how to do it, but wanted to see if they had special tricks of their own.  =)  The place was busy, but it wasn't just the waiter that came by and asked us how we were doing, but practically every worker came by and talked to us.  You can tell they were genuinely good folks.\n\nWe ordered their boardwalk fries, crab cake appetizers, and 6 large male blue crabs.  The fries and the crab cakes came out first.  The boardwalk fries were tasty and splashing malt vinegar on it made it even better.  Yum.  The crab cakes were a little small, but the menu did say each were 1 oz.  Other places compensate and add other stuff like bread stuffing and other fillings, but the good thing about Crab Corner's crab cakes were that it was practically all meat.  It wasn't earth shattering tasty goodness like this one restaurant in Baltimore, but it was still good.  The sauce that came with the crab cakes was a perfect complement and was a good start for the dinner.\n\nThen our large crabs came.  They were out of the jumbo size.  The large size was smaller than expected, but again these are blue crabs, not dungenous crabs.  The meat was very sweet, soft and moist.  The seasoning was good and I liked licking it off my fingers while eating the crab meat.  heheh.  They also had extra seasoning on the side as well.  My wife and I didn't talk for a while, since we were all focusing on the food.  haha.  But again, the waiters and owners came by regularly to check up on us.  If you have little toddlers that get restless, you might want to get a babysitter, since you can be there for a while and your hands get messy.  There were other families there with kids, but I'm glad my sister-in-law babysat our little one that night. \n\nI wanted to check out this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews and was definitely happy with this place.  However, if you are in the mood for other shellfish and not just crab, you might want to go to other places like Hot and Juicy Crawfish, though this place offers other shellfish as well.  Note, I didn't try other shellfish like crawfish and shrimp here yet, but this is my gut feeling.  I paid the same amount in Crab Corner as in Hot and Juicy, but felt more \"stuffed\" at the latter.  However, Crab Corner definitely satisfied my crab craving and would come back here again.  I definitely want to try their other entrees and appetizers and of course, have some of the blue crab again (maybe jumbo next time)."

I didn't love the fries and thought it was okay. Only after we left and I looked at the menu again did I realize that you are supposed to season them with crab spice and vinegar. Oh well...I will definitely try the crab spice seasoning next time but I'm no fan of malt vinegar so I don't know if that'll make a difference. We shared a bowl of lobster bisque which was very tasty but I thought it would be better if I found actual pieces of lobster in the lobster bisque. Afterall, the bowl wasn't cheap at $8 a bowl. My husband devoured his fried oyster sandwich which he claims was very good. It was served on a bun with lettuce, tomato and cocktail sauce. The crab cake sandwich also came on a bun with lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. The crab cake was delicious and full of crab meat and little filler if any.\n\nI rated it a 4 star because based on what we ate, we are a fan and plan on coming back to try the rest of the menu and more specifically the blue crab. Although the food is a bit pricey, you do get what you pay for. The staff was pleasant and observed them helping out new diners crack open some crab.

The crab is a little expensive (we should have tried the Tues/Thurs deals!), but I think fresh blue crab anywhere is probably expensive. The main drawback for me was the sides. Potato salad and fries weren't bad, just didn't really stand out. Also, the potato salad was a small scoop served on a plastic dessert plate, which also seemed kinda lacking. The peel and eat shrimp were good, but not as good as what they serve at hot n juicy (nor did they have as many flavor options).

The crab cakes we tried were all crab, no filler, so that was positive.\n\nThere was a sign on the wall next to me that told us how to open the crab for maximum eating pleasure.  I got this down easily and malleted my way into the legs, making perfect cuts each time.  I really dug the sweet potato tots too because they were basically little mounds of sweet potato fried in batter, rather than shredded and made into tots.\n\nAfter that, Mike bought a Tastykake so Eric R. then bought one too and he ate his for dessert inside the restaurant.

Fried food is great and all, but when batter overwhelms the core it makes for an awful dining experience. \n\nWe ordered oysters to start with.  Not usually a fan of oysters but these were surprisingly delicious. I was told these are fresh water oysters which gives it a different taste. A delicious one absent of that seafood taste a lot of people dislike, including myself. Even better: only $1 each on Sundays :D\n\nThey also have a pick two combo. I ordered chicken tenders and Alaskan cod with sweet potater tots and cold slaw. Both the cod and chicken tenders had little meat inside and I ended up picking off lost of the batter. Slaw was average and the only thing I found to be appetizing were the tots. \n\nI definitely give the employee props. It was Sunday and he was working alone but was still able to tend to everyone. \n\nSide note: I ordered ice water and it tasted like sea water, I believe this is because the cups are washed with other dishes and the seafood taste gets intermingled... Blech"

I ordered the crab cake sandwich and boardwalk fries, my hubby ordered the King Crab legs and the lobster bisque. We got there early (11:20a) but the guy (owner possibly) opening up was late so we were a little chilly standing outside until about 11:35. But he made up for it and got us two beers rather quickly.  The pros were his humor and professionalism, the food tasted overall good, \n\nThe cons are the location (in an old mexican market plaza) and the place itself wasn't as visually pleasing.

I ordered the Annapolis Crab Dip for the table, assuming it would be a good portion, as most places give you \"too much\" for an appetizer.  This was not the case.  Although it was DELICIOUS - it was only six baguettes with crab dip on top of them for $10.99.  Unacceptable.  I and two others ordered the Lobster Roll.  It was all bread.  Although the bread was delicious - I was not there to eat bread.  The fries were cold and tasted old.  When another party brought that to the attention of the waiter, within minutes he brought out steaming hot fries ...... still tasting 'old.'  Another party got hush puppies and one of which was not fully cooked.  This same person ordered Cod which was not fully cooked in the middle.  Overall a disappointing experience, especially since they added the tip to the bill and nowhere was it noted that they would be doing this.   I MIGHT try it again for the crab.  But the lobster just did not live up to my expectations.  Also tried the Lobster Bisque - it was 'ok.'  Very expensive for so many disappointments."

So my beau and I entered \"crab cakes\" in Yelp's search engine looking for a place not too far from our house.\n\nWe came across crab corner. From the pictures, it definitely caught our eye and we were willing to try it out.\n\nUpon arrival, the place looked to be straight off of the Maryland Boardwalk.\n The smell of old Bay let me know I was in the right spot for my craving.\n\nWe ordered the bacon-wrapped scallops. With the apricot chutney and a squeeze of lemon, it was the best part of our meal. \n\nFor our main entrees, I had the crab cake platter with hush puppies and beer-battered onion rings. The beau ordered the 2-item combo with beer-battered shrimp and Alaskan cod with a house salad and French fries. It is Tuesday so we took advantage of the Day Special $2 Blue Crabs.\n\"Growing up on the Mason-Dixon Line, I know what Maryland blue crabs are all about, and this place does a decent job of trying to replicate the flavors  from the Chesapeake,\" says my boyfriend.\n\nOur bill ended up being around $60 before tip.\n\nThe food, although nearly authentic-tasting, was not enough to write home about. The fried food, with a heavy batter that overpowered every item we ordered, turned out to be too much for our stomachs to handle later on.\n\nWe would have LOVED to LOVE this place because Ivan and the manager were very accommodating and kind, but the service was better than the food itself."

(That is a much nicer story than coming to the realization too late that apparently old folks homes don't want to see Rex's erotic version of Winnie the Poo...especially the poo part...and that it took 4 arrests and 5 stints in county before he realized this absolute truth...yes...olympics is nicer.) \n\nIn between...um...workouts for the Olympics...Rex aways would crave seafood. Let's just say where Rex was...um...working out...they didn't have access to the freshest seafood...damn jail...Rex means London...whatever.\n\nThe powerful pull of amazing seafood is one that Rex is often subject to...but in Las Vegas Nevada there is a very low...VERY LOW chance of being able to find that great seafood. Even at the classiest restaurants their dumpsters are filled with leftover subpar seafood. Also, in these recessionary times Rex...like all of us...is ever conscious about finances...when he makes his own roofies...he uses immitation Mentos...that is how broke Rexy is right now...but that is another story.  So, where does a budget conscious foodie who is desperate to get that sweet meat from the sea...(ironically Sea Sweet Meat was Rex's nickname in the Navy)...well...Rex has found the best possible place. A place that isn't just good for Vegas...which many places could be labeled...no...this is GREAT for anywhere. Where is it...Crab Corner. Even the words are great...Crab (not crabS...that isn't good)...and Corner...which we can all agree is better than a square. \n\nFirst and foremost before we get to the menu...which is all brilliant...one thing must be said...ALL OF THE SEAFOOD IS FLOWN IN FRESH EVERY DAY!!!!! Really read that and understand what it means. FRESH EVERY DAY!!  Not this frozen crap that is sold in stores...that isn't seafood...that is a waste of money. Since Rex has spent his time in the east coast...he knows great seafood...and you CANNOT FREEZE SEAFOOD AND THINK IT IS GOOD!! The fact that these two brothers (great guys, they don't even mind when Rex licks their dumpster) would go to this extent to provide great ingredients is a testament to their commitment. At this point it would be almost impossible to screw up and they dont.\n\nLet's start with the greatest dish they have and the FINEST bowl of soup in town...the lobster bisque. Proof in one bowl there is a God. There are no fillers, it isn't some cream filled monstrosity with some frozen crab thrown in it. NO!  This is the real deal. The depth of flavor they get is just out of this world. No life can be complete and NOT eat a bowl of this soup. Rex wants his ashes to be thrown in the soup and then served to unsuspecting customers...that is how good the soup is and how bad Rex is.\n\nThe rest...is all great. The crabs are obviously amazing. Absolutely perfectly cooked and seasoned. The jewel of Rex's heart is the FRESH, hand battered oysters. Salty, briney, sweet, perfectly battered. Just amazing. Rex could go on and on but there is nothing bad.  If there is one minor complaint, to nitpick, their cole slaw is uninspired, the sweet potato fries are sometimes too soggy and one of Rex's lobster tail was extremely overcooked to the point of rubbery. Sometimes the attention to detail in the more delicate culinary pursuits are just not done as well as they should be. Still, on the whole this is the BEST seafood restaurant in town and it won't break your bank.\n\nAs the great Rex Marvin says...\"does it smell like fish....then give her to Rex!\"  Enjoy!"

Crab Corner is that kind of place. I spent the first thirty-plus years living in both Virginia and Maryland, where it was routine to buy bushels of crabs on the weekends or go boating and crabbing with my father. \n\nBeing the lazy person that I am, I opted for the crab cake platter instead of the steamed blue crabs. The platter ($25.95 for 2 crab cakes) came with two sides. I upgraded to a cup of Maryland crab soup (an additional $1.50). It's served with half of an in-shell crab. The second side dish was an order of hush puppies -- some of the tastiest ones you'll find in town.\n\nThe crab cakes were excellent. They had all the marks of a good crab cake -- very little filler and loosely formed with plenty of lump and jumbo lump meat that falls apart with little effort; enough seasoning to enhance the flavor but not too much as to mask the sweetness of the meat. They're the best crab cakes I've had in Vegas, by far.\n\nThey do have a kid's menu that consists of chicken tenders ($5.95) or popcorn shrimp ($6.95). Both come with fries and a drink.\n\nThe place is owned by two brothers from Maryland who also own and operate Nevada Seafood Wholesalers, which supplies much of this town's seafood for restaurants and markets like Seafood City. And with those imports comes a slice of nostalgia for any east coaster used to eating fresh seafood."

While my husband drowled at the crabs, I screamed like a little girl, \"Take it away, take it away!\" I know, I'm dumb, but the guy, the lobster, probably known as \"Legs\" to his friends, was looking right at me. To my astonishment, the waiter... I should have remembered his name, and the name of the gracious cook... pulled his buddy away from my screams, and explained to Legs that he was going to have to be de-shelled by another before fulfilling his life's mission of giving pleasure. The cook was so kind as to remove every bit of meat and then serve it to me. That was amazing. Of course, I tipped him... Don't forget that when you are in Vegas, please. Sorry, I digress.

Crab is flown in from their own fishing company if I remember right.  Thier seafood is fresh and tasty. Eat setup is fun. Eat everything right on the table, covered with a large paper. It's not the best looking spot inside, but it gives you that by the bay kind vibe, instead of boats, there's the automobiles on eastern haha.  Thier dungeness is seasonal, so if your coming for that, call first. They present thier dungeness and blue crab unseasoned, but flavorful, if that makes sence. Deffinately the go to spot if your in the central area for that quick seafood fix. They do have to go too, so if your not in the mood for a sit in, call ahead and pick up."

Its located in a small mall plaza right after the zia record store on eastern. When we went inside, the setting was simple with a few tables, chairs, and decorations reflecting all things Maryland. The crab cakes were pretty good. It was a little on the salty side but the tartar sauce really helped calm that salty flavor down. Was it worth almost $20.00? Yes but only if you're craving fresh crab cakes as 20 bucks can go a long way here in Vegas. The steamed sampler contained cleaned blue crabs, corn, sausage, clams, and shrimp in a garlic, butter sauce. I wouldn't order the this again for 2 reasons. First, the sauce was on the watery side and thus gave the seafood no taste at all. And secondly, the crabs and shrimp did not come with the heads so pretty much the best parts of the seafood were missing. I will only come back here only for their crab cakes..."

Sadly, on Monday, I got out at 11AM for an hour lunch, only to find this place closed. Looked it up later and they don't open til 11:30AM for lunch. Too bad for them, because I planned ahead to hit them today and while waiting in their parking lot from 11:15-11:30, no less than six people walked up and decided against waiting for them to open. Highly suggest they open a smidge earlier, they're losing out on business.\n\nIn any case, I managed to make it in and service was polite- placed a to go order for a crab cake sandwich, had a little bit of sticker shock at the $13 price tag that didn't even include fries or an add-on option for a discounted soup (as other menu items do). Order took a reasonable 15 minutes, server brought me cold water while I waited, which was appreciated. When my order was brought out, the box was opened to show me the food and I was given extra lemons and tartar sauce without even asking, which was great.\n\nCrab cake sandwich itself was tasty- the cake is a good size and surprisingly delicate with a light flavor. Good amount of crab and not too much breading was used, but felt the seasoning was almost a bit too light. Tartar sauce is made in house and it's evident in the taste: light, fresh, spot-on flavor! Only issue I took with my order was that the sandwich was stuffed with three lettuce leaves and two thick slices of tomato, almost as if to make the sandwich look bigger- but the extra toppings made the sandwich messy so half had to be removed. Filling portion, though.\n\nWould come back for some fresh seafood or other menu items. Their website indicates that they have various discounts and promotions, and Tuesdays in particular they offer $2 male or female blue crabs and $2 beers, which I sadly could not take advantage of during work hours."

I read other reviews about being out of crab but to me that just means that its that good, so I would suggest trying something different if that's your experience because you wont be disappointed. The crab cakes are a favorite of mine for sure! Both locations are nice, obviously the newer one is a bit fancier in a few ways, but food is what Im after and both locations have amazing crab!

However, I am married to one, so my thoughts are based partially on his reaction to his meal, my personal meal and a recitation of the facts.\n\nFacts can be important, especially in the seafood business where product quality is of particular importance, so let's start there. Crab Corner is owned by two brothers who previous to the restaurant only owned a seafood wholesaler specializing primarily in... you guessed it, crabs! They supply a good deal of Spring Mountain Road grocery stores with their live crabs, and now, they are running their wholesale business from this location. So, I'd say the product is as fresh as can be found! They carry Maryland crabs when they are in season, but when they are not, they come from elsewhere. Right now, they are serving up Texas crabs.\n\nAs for the crabs, they are sold based on the number you want of a particular size: 1, 2, or 3, with 1 being the biggest crab. They bring 'em out on tray, and then slide them onto your plastic covered table for your crackin' pleasure. Each crab is steamed and covered with J.O. Spice, which is apparently THE spice for Maryland crabs. My hub is still talking about the #1 crab, and we ate this meal a couple of days ago. He approved of both the meat quality and the value.  \n\nI had a crab cake platter: one crab cake, two sides for $15.95. I think this is a little expensive, but of course, I am not an expert on crab pricing! As for the crab cake, if you appreciate crab more than cake, I think you'll approve as it definitely has a strong crab flavor. Although the menu said jumbo lump blue crab meat, the meat wasn't particularly lumpy. Personally, I think I like a little lumpier crab cake.\n\nFor sides, we sampled the onion rings, sweet potato tots and potato salad. Onion rings were good, but probably not hand-battered. What's not to love about sweet potato tots? And, I think the potato salad is a real contender! I bet it's based on somebody's mama's recipe, as it tasted like it were made with love. Lots of egg. The only thing I might add is some sweet pickles and a dash of mustard, but then again, who am I to question Mom? \n\nLastly, the service is great. Here is another family owned business that deserves some love. These brothers are passionate about their product and their home! You can be sure they will be showing all the Ravens' games, and don't worry, their liquor license is coming soon.  \n\nIf you are a crab lover who loves to pick, this should be on your list to try."

As I lived in MD for six years, I was really looking forward to a great MD fresh seafood taste.\n\nWe went in on Monday and the place was pretty full at 5:45.  There was only one table at that moment that would fit all six of us.  My mother-in-law and I both had the crab cake, which came with two sides.  My husband had snow crab legs, my father in law had a combination plate, and both kids had the popcorn shrimp.\n\nEveryone thought their food was fantastic.  The question really becomes is it worth the price that they charge?  I don't know.  The average cost per meal was $16.\n\nI had a living social coupon, which took off $20.  Because there was 6 of us, they charged 18% tip automatically.  I paid before we got our food (so it won't be an issue with my inlaws playing the \"no, I AM paying\" game).  Later while we were still there, I thought about the tip amount and it seemed under what it should have been.  The guy charged me tip on the amount AFTER he took the $20 off, but then he charged me for two kids drinks when they were supposed to be free with the kids meal.  Hence, $5 that would have been the extra tip I was about to leave, was paid to the house for his error.  Oh well.\n\nI am not sure if I will return.

This place was pretty awesome!\n\nMy husband and I had the sampler -- 1 lb of Maryland crab, 1 lb of Dungeness crab, 1 lb of king crab, 1/2 of shrimp and corn on the cob, plus we had their crab soup (cream-based). We finished every bit of it! Really, really good! \n\nThe staff were all attentive and friendly... especially Jade.

The order takes only about 5-10 to come out anyways, so I recommend order as your go.\n\nGreat quality blue crab, served extremely hot and flavored with spicy cajun seasoning! For the first ten minutes, the inside juices of the crab is hot to the touch, so be careful. Make good use of the mallet+knife and the meal will be less messy and laborious. Sometimes blue crab is a pain to eat, but there's a few techniques that really makes it easier than just bashing at it. The friendly staff will teach you if you need guidance.\n\nI am more of a dungeness crab eater because the meat is more easily accessible and come in bigger chunks. However, the blue crab here is really easy to crack open once you get the hang of it, and there's plenty of crab to go around so portions doesn't become an issue. I ate about 5 and I felt pretty full. \n\nThe venue is pretty small but cozy. The crab will be ready within ten minutes of ordering (I love fast service!).\n\nA few points I wanna make: The venue is tiny, so there might be a waiting time. The tables are so small it's hard to eat. We sat in the corner and I had a hard time stretching my arms and using the tools. \n\nAlso, I don't know if the cajun seasoning is a winner. I liked it in the beginning, but I really think they should serve it plain. It gets a little bland and tastes repetitive after a while. You can always ask for it later if you want it.\n\nOverall, great place and I would categorize it as experiential eating. It feels awkward not using chopsticks or a spoon but the mallet becomes fun to use after a while."

However, their food and service is horrendous... I haven't been back in over a year, and don't plan on ever going back. \n\nThe food at this location is much better. But the space isn't as nice, and the bathrooms are gross. They have been every time I've gone. They also have a server who is very \"interesting\". Tall guy, and don't get me wrong, he's very nice. But I could have sworn he was high. He talked and acted like he had just smoked a bowl in the back. My husband thought maybe he had a learning disability? Who knows. Anyway, when you can catch him (he moves around in slow motion and seems kind of oblivious), he comes over and is very kind, and talks to you... A  LOT. We were all starving on Friday night. He took our order, then proceeded to talk to us for about 5-10 minutes. I didn't want to be rude, but all I could think was \"Please... Go put our order in before I eat your arm off!\"\n\nFood was pretty good. My son's friend got the snow crab, which looked awesome. But I just don't know if I can keep justifying the price for the atmosphere and service. The food is good, but not great."

            "review": "I realllyyyyyy wanted to like this place. I was killing time waiting to go somewhere and hadn't had dinner yet. Based on a previous review I decided to stop in at the crab corner and order what had been highly rated in a previous review, Clam strips, hush puppies and catfish with sweet potato fries. When my plate came out it looked pleasantly full- crispy burnished brown, with a fresh homemade-looking cocktail sauce and tartar sauce. Sadly, the flavor did not live up to the first impression looks. The clams had a crisp exterior which yeilded an unpleasantly mushy and dare I say slimy? Interior. Some of the crispy bits had clam, some were more clam- flavored batter, I'd say half the total order. I'm completely perplexed as to how the previous reviewer had \"ordered another of clam strips as they were the best he'd ever had\". The catfish still had that silver skin on underneath the batter and tasted pretty muddy. I never understood people complaining about \"catfish tasting dirty\" till now. Brrrr. The pieces were small and pretty thin, too (anyone looking for amazing crispy fresh catfish, try Cravin' Cajun on Jones which will still be my go-to). The sweet potato fries were greasy and limp within 5 minutes of their arrival. I ate 3 hush puppies which seemed to be the only rightly flavorful and \"decent\" part of the plate. \n\nTo top it all off.. I ordered a fountain drink (root beer) and the first thing I noticed upon a sip was the strong tap water aftertaste. What the heck!!!\n\nThe only thing I think worth stars in this whole meal was the service, with only 2 young guys manning the front and I swear they checked on me at least twice through my meal (both of them). How this place earned a 2012 Review Journal \"Best Of\" completely escapes me!!! Now to upload the pics I took. Sigh."

We were promptly seated and were informed of the Tuesday $2 blue crab special. The service from then on out was a little slow and scattered, but it was completely understandable - one waiter was running the entire restaurant (~10 tables). What I did like, is for those that didn't know how to eat blue crabs, the waiter would stop by and explain the different parts of the crab and how to get to the good stuff.\n\nCrab soup: Disappointed. All the of crab meat was shredded and the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the broth. The soup wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't anything special. \n\nBeer battered cod: The fish was still tender and the batter wasn't anything overwhelming. Great.\n\nFried Oysters: Delicious! The breading was a little heavier than I would've liked, but the oyster was incredible fresh and juicy on the inside.\n\nHush Puppies: Absolutely amazing. These were seriously the best hush puppies I've had.\n\nCrab cakes: Loaded with meet. I could barely find any filler at all. They had incredibly delicious flavor. Because they're loaded with meat, the price is somewhat steep: $16 for 1 cake/$25 for 2. However, getting 1/3lb of crab meat per cake makes it worth it.\n\nBlue crabs: Wonderful flavor. I actually like the flavor of blue crab more so than king/snow/dungeness, but the work:meat ratio is MUCH higher with blue crab. Expect to work a lot harder for your food with these crabs. It's totally worth it, but if you don't have the patience, just order the crab cakes and you'll be set.\n\nMussels: Great garlic broth they were cooked in, but in my opinion, they were somewhat overcooked. I just ate at Hot N Juicy the day prior and the mussels were much more tender over there. The flavors were great though.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely go back, but I'd likely stick to the crab cake platter with hush puppies."

Yes it's true and the food is fresh and delicious.\n\nCrab corner is a popular seafood style Restuarant that's more like a sports bar. But Serving seafood simply isn't enough for them, so on Tuesdays & Thursday's they have the seafood special where whole crabs are just $2 each on Tuesdays and $3 on Thursdays. They also serve chilled beers for $2 as well. What a steal for the price!! That's not all, they have delicious complementary side dishes like chunky potato salad, sweet potato tater totes. But the two popular dishes that I couldn't get enough of was the lightly fried and well seasoned calamari and the crab dip. \n\nImagine being temporarily transported from the hot Vegas sun to the cool waterfront of Maryland with the smell of old bay seasoning lingering in the air. Sounds delightful and although it's not decorated to my liking as a sports fan (this place is covered in Ravens memorabilia). The staff and fun make up for it.\n\nSo get there early because this place fills up fast and can become a long wait. Ask them to go light on the old bay because it can be to much at times. But once you get settled this place is fun and entertaining with huge TV screens located on the wall. But more importantly full from endless seafood."

They showed up in a timely manner after we were sat and did, at some point check on us a while after appetizers and after the meal but we had to flag them down for anything else. It wasn't terrible but, if I want crab, I'm going to Joe's CS. Glad to check it off my list of places to try but they didn't come back."

I, like many from there, grew up crabbing and eating Maryland blue crabs which have a distinct buttery-sweet flavor. Steam them up in a pot with generous handfuls of Old Bay season and I'm your best friend! I travel to Vegas a few times a year from L.A. One day recently, I found myself watching a video on ways to eat blue crabs and ended up watching one from a guy who owned 2 restaurants in Vegas. WHAT?? Blue crabs in Vegas?? Sure, there are places that serve the meat in dishes (crab cakes, sushi) but I haven't heard of any that steam them and serve (dump) them on your butcher-paper-covered table with vinegar, extra seasoning, a mallet and crab knife like this place does--Chesapeake Bay-style. The peel-and-eat shrimp was also good. The boardwalk fries (similar to the ones sold at Thrasher's in Ocean City, MD) did kinda take me back. The crabs? Mouth-wateringly, finger-licking good! Although the spice blend they use isn't actually Old Bay, it's very similar. The vinegar cups they give you even have tiny peppers in them to spice it up. Plenty of DC/MD memorabilia all over so it made me feel a little bit at home. The only caveat to me was the service: although attentive and prompt, they were not terribly friendly or engaging. I wasn't expecting them to be super outgoing but still felt kinda like we were just given the food and the check and that was it. I might be able to understand somewhat if it were busy, but it wasn't while we were there. Regardless, I truly hope this place survives and sticks around for years. I appreciate the DC/MD/VA pride in the middle of the desert!"

Then later a 2nd server came named Richard took our order. They were actually SOLD OUT on majority of their items we wanted. So whatevers, we still thought we should give it a try. Got our food which was such a small portion amount for their price. Not worth it! Even their oysters were very tiny! On top of that, Service was horrible! No one came to check on our table to see how we were doing the entire time we were there. They were 3 other tables there. But they weren't busy at all! The bill came out & realized the snow crab special w/ 2 sides was NOT $19! We complained, and told Richard the other guy who 1st came quoted us $19. Richard himself, who we then found out was the MANAGER said well he quoted you wrong, I'm the manager! I'll go talk to him. Instead of saying I apologize for his mistake, and adjusting the bill. He just left it as that! No apology for the mistake absolutely NOTHING! Not even a thank you, have a good night! Take your money else where and eat at a seafood buffet, or hot & juicy or even boiling crab! Never again!"

The waiter was friendly but never anywhere to be found, when I ask for the check I noticed he added 18% to my bill, My husband and I waited tables all through high school and college so we tip between 20 and 25% always, I gave them 3 stars because first of all the service sucked we saw him all of 3 times he came back once in the hour and forty five minutes that we were there to fill our tea and water the rest of the time it was just to drop off our food he didn't even clear the dirty dishes out of the way till he brought the check.. I should be happy he saved me money because my husband would have insisted on leaving at least 20% but when he saw that he put 18% tip on for 4 adults and 2 children he agreed.. I really would say for the price of the meal and the lack of service go somewhere else there are so many other places in the Las Vegas area where you will have better service.. I wish I could say we would be back but I think we will be looking for other places to visit on our next trip."

The first impression this place left on me was...well,  that fishy smell, not off to a good start....... Myself and a few co-workers stopped here for lunch. As it is a relatively new location that did not open too long ago. I figured they would have their best foot forward.  Sure hope that was not the case. \n\nCant remember the name of the server, we only saw him 3 times during the whole visit. 1) bring water and take order 2) drop off food 3) drop off check.  Now let me clarify, I do not expect to be served like a king, I am not a nose up type of person. However, when we had to ask for a re-fill on drinks from a different server that happened to be walking by, then I started to question the service.\n\nThis brings me to the food. Part of the drink re-fill debacle was due to the fact that all of the food we ordered was overly salty. We were all parched and need large amounts of water to wash down the food. The fried soft shell crab was not very impressive, scrawny little guys, 90% shell/breading, 5% meat, 5% grease/salt. The fries were not bad but they were nothing to write home about either. The potato salad was pretty good. \n\nI will probably give this place another shot as every place has its off days. Im just hoping that this was an off day and not the standard at Crab Corner."

I've come in the past with my family and we enjoyed the crab. I wanted to order about a dozen female crabs but our waiter suggested I order half now and the rest later so it wouldn't get cold. An hour later we are approached by the owner apologizing for the delay but the expediter was new and gave our crab to another table. He gave us shrimp to nibble on and another beer as we waited for our crabs. Our waiter at this time was also the bartender and he was very VERY apologetic and sincere. Over an hour later we get six crabs. I don't trust the wait so I order six more female crabs. He appologizes that they are out of the smaller size but we will get the larger size for the same price. When the crabs arrive they are all males. I ask what happened to my order of females and he again apologizes that they ran out. Well I still don't understand why they didn't say they ran out of female crabs when I ordered. \n\nLesson learned from my visit to both locations ...just because they are named crab corner and boast their Maryland crabs doesn't mean they have crabs to sell at their restaurants, maybe the crabs are hiding in the ocean but next time I want blue crabs I'll head over to the Asian market and cook them myself."

Not only that, people are walking in with reservations! \n\nOnce we were seated at a table with no serving ware we waited 17 mins for someone to take our drink order. Then the waiter comes and asks \"what are we eating?\" No introduction. No specials were told. Hell to this day I don't even know his name because he failed to tell us! \n\nOur order arrived in a timely manner although we didn't have anything to eat it with (still no serving ware) My water was now empty and I'm parched so we order the bottle of champagne. Wrong! Champagne served in wine glasses and there wasn't a chiller provided so the bottle sweats on the table and we're drinking warm champagne. Smh. For some odd reason an order of white rice came out with our meal and it didn't belong to us. It sat as we began to eat and the waiter returns with a bashful smile and says \"Uhhhh yeaaaaaa this isn't yourssss\" then proceeds to do a slow motion James Brown slide as he takes it to the correct table. Yes, he took it to the table as if it were a fresh bowl prepared for them. \n\nIt's a shame that the food is great but due to the service I'll visit a different location and tell my friends to do the same."

The crab cake is one of the best 'I've had with great flavor an large lumps of crabs with little filler. I also got the Alaskan crab legs on this visit and they were some of the best  I have had hands down.  The bar area is a great set up as the back opens up with a view of the patio which is great on a nice day. I actually hit this establishment twice on my visit since I enjoyed it so much the first day I arrived. Its not too far of the strip with 5 star food for reasonable prices."

            "review": "I love Crab Corner. I like the idea and the concept behind it. Fresh crab flown in from Maryland for our own pleasure here in the desert. I have sampled most of their menu, and have yet to find anything I dislike. Please, if you come to a place called Crab Corner and order a chicken sandwich, you forfeit your right to complain.\nThey have great happy hour specials (I believe $4 wine and beer), and a number of appetizers to choose from. Also, they have $1 Oysters during happy hour and on Sundays. Yes, their oysters are small but the texture is just right and they are always fresh. So, if you are a fan of huge, briny oysters this is not the place for you. The price point matches what you get. I've also had their calamari fries which were delicious. We have shared the garlic steam pot among four people ($49.99) and it was filled with corn, shrimp, and various types of crab. I have also had their fried soft shell blue crab and it was perfect. They offer several sides but my favorite were the fried okra and sweet potato tots.\nThe service was great, the price point just right, and the interior was spacious with a fully stocked bar. On certain nights they host trivia there and it gets pretty packed. After having a huge feast for four, and eating what seems to be 800 pounds of crab I was shocked at how reasonable our bill was.\nI will most certainly be back!"

            "review": "For just the seafood, Crab Corner is pretty good.  I went twice, once for the fried softshell crab and then went back because I just had to try the crabcakes.  I also tried the Maryland crab soup and the bacon-wrapped scallops.  First, avoid the bacon-wrapped scallops!  They were horribly overcooked and therefore dry, tough, and except for the bacon, flavorless.  But the other three seafood items were terrific.  The crab in the crabcakes and soup tasted fresh, as opposed to frozen or out of a can.  If you have a craving for seafood (which tends to be either very bad or very expensive in the middle of the desert), Crab Corner is great.  But where this place really disappoints is everything else on the menu.  Every side I tried was just awful.  The corn on the cob had the taste and consistency of something that had been sitting in a warmer for hours, if not days.  The sweet potato tater tots are a great concept with weak execution.  And the hush puppies were either left in the fryer or sat in the warmer for so long that they were almost as tough as the scallops.  Finally, the dessert selection is almost nonexistent:  either snow cones (I tried the root beer - yuck) or Tasty Cakes (sounded very factory, so I didn't bother).  For seafood, Crab Corner gets 3 stars (the horrible bacon-wrapped scallops drops it a star).  But for everything else on the menu, it gets 1 star.  Both servers I had were great, so 4 stars for service.  I live pretty close, and as a Boston guy, I certainly love seafood, but I doubt I'll bother going back."

I ordered king crab legs and they come with a seasoning salt that was too salty to eat . I ordered a plain order and it tasted the same . Thought they were supposed to be steamed but tasted like they were boiled and the water hadn't been changed in a while. I ordered a fried oyster appetizer, and was told they couldn't do that. There was no appetizer but there was an entree on the menu. I will never eat at this place ever again. You're better off going to hot and juicy or the boiling crab instead.

He was very attentive and quick.\n\nOur party of four wanted crabs! We're all from Delaware, and two of us have been living in the desert for a couple years, missing blue crabs like crazy. We went on \"Three Dollar Thursday\", for which we ordered 2.5 dozen large males at $4 a pop (about half price off their menu board). Before they came out, we ordered two appetizers: a blue crab dip & a crab pretzel. Both were pretty good, however I felt that the same exact crab mix was used for both apps. The only difference was melted cheese was placed over the pretzel. The pretzel made me miss Philly pretzels, not the same.\n\nWith each dozen of crabs delivered to our table, we all gave various feedback from cooked perfectly to too mushy to eat. I personally ate 5 crabs and 2 of those were on the overcooked end. That seemed to be the consensus also: somewhere around 60-70% of the crabs weren't cooked to perfection. But it was worth it. We filled our bellies and were happy. We may return if the craving ever comes back, since flying home would be a lot more pricey and time consuming rather than dealing with a less than perfect cook on the crabs. Overall a great experience!"

We went around 5pm on a Friday night and it was easy to get a table still. The place is relatively loud however so don't expect to have any easy conversations. \n\nFirst off, the food is good but nothing to write home about. There wasn't really anything that we didn't like but we've been to steakhouses or non seafood restaurants that had better fish. I got the soft shell crab sandwich which doesn't come with any side so I ordered onion rings, and my wife got the King crab legs and a $3 happy hour beer. We shared a crab cake platter which comes with two very small sides. All of this came out to $75 with tax which in our opinion was far overpriced. \n\nThe real disappointing part of this place is the service. We did get seated quickly but then we didn't really see our waiter the whole time. He and and took our order and then just disappeared. Also, they delivered people's food to the table uneven leaving some eating and some still waiting for the I food for quite awhile.

It took a couple of minutes to be seated, and the hostess had trouble finding a clean table. The server was quick to take our drink order; however, he told me that he had to check to make sure they had the stuff to mix my drink. Which is fine - i get that, but he disappeared for 10 minutes after that and never confirmed whether or not I had to choose a different drink. I watched him flirt and socialize with different employees before he returned to our table with drinks in hand.\n\nAfter that we had to wait an additional 10 minutes to have our order taken. The food came pretty quickly after that. The bacon wrapped scallops were really tasty, but you only get 4 scallops that were on the small side for $14, so it was a bit overpriced. The lobster bisque was very well done... would have preferred more lobster chunks instead of the slivers, but I was grateful for what was there compared to the crab soup that my spouse got. There wasn't any discernable piece of crab to be found in the otherwise tasty veggie soup. Maybe it was just the portions we were given... not sure.\n\nWe ordered the garlic blue crab, peel and eat shrimp, homemade potato salad, and onion rings. The potato salad was excellent! The onion rings were battered nicely, but they would have been much better if paired with some kind of cheese dipping sauce. When we asked for that, we were told that the only sauces available were salad dressings, which was disappointing. The shrimp was tasty, decently sized and portioned for the price. We were rather disappointed with the crab. We were given 3 blue crabs smothered in a garlic sauce. Maybe blue crab is small in nature, but the actual meat inside the crab was mushy and difficult to extract from the shell. We are used to eating snow, dungeness, and king crab, so we didn't really consider the crab to be an accurate reflection of the restaurant's abilities. \n\nAs we live in North Las Vegas, and stopped by this place because we were in the area, I don't believe we will be returning anytime soon.

Interior is pretty similar, but still nice. They had a band performing which was a nice touch. They weren't overly loud or distracting which we were concerned about at first.\n\nI had really intended on ordering crab, but got derailed and instead ordered the two item combo with fried shrimp and oysters. I should have stuck to my first inclination. Although my food was ok, the fresh seafood options looked so much yummier and I stared enviously at other diner's meals. I tried a bite of my friend's crab cakes and they were delicious. I'd come back for those as well as during their happy hour for some blue crab or oysters.\n\nService was a little slow and we had to remind our server for refills and to bring our check, but for the most part I enjoyed our meal here and look forward to trying them again soon."

The bread they use I believe is garlic bread, then their coleslaw is a perfect balance of sweet and salty that goes perfectly with their fresh crispy fried oysters. They are also generous with the portions of oysters within the sandwich. In addition to good food they are super friendly and show they appreciate and value your business. I cannot understand why this place is only 3.5 stars they deserve to be 4-5!

My daughter and I stopped in yesterday for a quick bite to eat before heading back to work. From the minute we walked in the smell was terrible, granted we know seafood places have a tendency to smell a little funky but this place just smelled bad.  The table condiments were filthy. We were looking at what was available to use and when we picked up the large container of seasoning, it was covered with food and smears and old fingerprints from previous patrons. It looked like someone had been eating crab legs with their fingers then moved onto the seasonings over and over again. The bus boy or waiting staff obviously never wipe them down.  In the women's bathroom the wall was covered in dirt and the bathrooms had all the toilet paper spindles empty with extra TP just sitting on top of the back of the toilet. Looked like no one had serviced or emptied the waste disposal unit located in each bathroom as they were overflowing with trash. \n\nWe decided to play it safe and order the chicken fingers or chicken nuggets I think they were called, we paid approx 10 buck a piece. When they came out there were 2 in each basket with fries.  They were the pre bought frozen chicken fingers and were pretty gross.  It doeskin take much for a restaurant to purchase fresh chicken tenderloins and dredge them in some milk cover them with some flour and deep fry them.  This is a pretty simple meal to prepare for most restaurants.  Not to mention the price was way over for 2 nuggets I mean they weren't even extra big just seems a bit steep for 2 bites.  \n\nNeedless to say we wont be back and would recommend that they either find a cleaning crew to clean things up or they wont be in business too long.  Also a little fresh food really goes along way."

Sam suggested the $1 happy hour oysters. I'm glad he did because they were delicious. Fresh and buttery. Their crab cakes are some of the best I've had. They're mostly crab meat. Hardly any breading. Lightly broiled and delicious.\n\nThis place is definitely worth a try. If your looking to watch a game the bar area has plenty of flat screens and good sound. You can either belly up to the bar, or sit at a table and watch a game. The bar is half inside and half outside on the patio. When the weather warms up the patio bar seating will be a great spot to eat, drink, and watch a game."

Instead of buying it through groupon and having them get a 50% cut on their end.  So I went it and mentioned it to the waiter. He told me I had to buy it first through groupon, AND I had to wait 4 hours before I can use it. I asked why , because that doesn't make any sense. And thats when he told me \"Groupon just doesn't allow us to have the vouchers used right away\" ..... okay but thats not true. And whoever in there thinks its a brilliant idea to lie to customers is an idiot. I have a business myself and am a groupon merchant. So I know exactly how it works and it does not require a 4 hour wait to use. It doesn't even take a person who is a merchant to know that. It's obviously a setup to force the customer to pay full price. Which is not really an issue for me , but they way the business is shady about it and lying to people is not a good way to make customers. I wanted to use the groupon to try the food, see how I like it (regardless of the bad reviews) and if I like it, ill come back and ill be happy to pay full price. I understand that the business is trying to make it and would prefer to have full paying customers, but heres the thing, What's better? $30 bucks plus a good tip ( especially to compensate for the groupon) or $0 ? Because thats what they got from me, just for lying. And just for that, I probably won't give them another chance. What could've been a chance to make a customer, they made it so unreasonable and now I'm on here . And i didn't even get the chance to try the food. but from the looks of the reviews, it looks like i didn't miss out. Heres a tip for the crab corner, if you just want full paying customers, then I suggest you take down the  campaign and quit bull shitting ."

The restaurant is pretty big inside with lots of TV's (they had the football games on when we were there, most people at the bar were watching). \n\nThe menu had so much to choose from, we spent more time debating on what to get than your average customer. So the plan was to get a couple things and share. This was our order:\n\nLobster bisque- awesome, prob one of the best I've had, tasted like I was at a strip restaurant. Not too much sherry, and the broth was delish. \n\nCrab Cakes- outstanding. About 90% crab (real crab) and not too much breading. Sauce is excellent too. \n\nAlaskan Cod and Fried Sea Clams-cod was excellent and I loved you could get a hint of the beer in the batter. \n\nSoft Shell Crab-so good! Batter was good, didn't take away from the taste of the crabs. \n\nSides-\n*Hushpuppies were the best I've had (better than the ones I recently had in North Carolina) Not dry at all and had a good seasoning. \n*Sweet potato fries (can't really mess those up)\n*Coleslaw was good but it was a tad warm, needs to be a lot colder. \n*Potato salad wasn't the best I've had, a little on the plain side. \n\nI definitely want to come back and try some of their cocktails and sit outside on their patio. They had an good specialty cocktail list. \n\nMy only gripe is, I loved the crab cakes, I just think $28 was a bit steep for them."

You'll notice that most of the 2-star Yelp reviews are from people who don't eat blue crabs. Blue crabs are what Crab Corner does best. I understand picking crabs isn't for everyone, but this is one of those places where you have to know what to order.\n\nI'm a fan. But it's a real time consuming meal - figure about 8-10mins per crab. Don't miss $2 crab Tuesdays (regular size) and $3 crab Thursdays (large size). I've never done the all-you-can-eat Mondays ($24.99) there, because that could be big trouble timewise and healthwise. Picking crabs is hard on your fingertips, and I usually eat 7 or 8 in one sitting. I'm not full after 7 or 8 crabs, but at that point I do feel like taking a shower after that much cracking, splatting and sucking. Feeling rich? Get the jumbo size - a lot easier to pick and a lot more meat.\n\nThe $1 happy hour oysters from 2pm-6pm are usually a large variety like Chesapeake or Fannie Mae. Very tasty and a great deal. Draft beers are $3 during happy hour.\n\nIt could literally take you 2+ hours to eat here, picking and grinning the entire time. My best suggestion is to order at most 3 crabs per person at a time, so they stay hot. When starting on your last crab, put another order in."

And the crab Benedict which was perfect from hollandaise to egg texture. \n\n\nMigrated to bar to continue our bottomless deal (if you don't have a bottomless for brunch ... What you doing ??)) met Ashley the bartender. She was so attentive and relatable . Would come back to see her and eat at the bar Area ."

            "review": "This was our first time to this place. My son has been there and said it was good. First of all the the calamari was very chewy, I have never had calamari that was so chewy that it made your jaw hurt. Food started to come out...we had order two lobster rolls, kids chicken fingers, clams, cheeseburger and blackened mahi mahi. Everyone food but the cheeseburger and mahi mahi came out, waited another 20 minutes or so for the burger and then another 15 for the mahi mahi.  Waited another 15 minutes for someone to come by to so I may ask for tartar sauce, after no one coming to attend to us I got up and walked over to the bar where the server was sitting on her cell phone to ask her for some tartar sauce.  Waited for another while and thought maybe they forgot about us since we had to call out if anyone was there to give us our check. I had asked prior to leaving because they already had added the gratuity which I felt was not deserved.  They had stated that their internet was down and they needed to run our cards the old way imprinted. After walking out they closed the place early due to Internet not working. I called and spoke with Rina, manager and explained how I felt I shouldn't have had to be forced to pay for the gratuity at a certain amount when the service was bad. Rina apologized and said your card was not run due to Internet being down, which I checked on my account and it wasn't. She stated that the next morning she will run it with a gratuity of my choice minus our drinks...didn't happen. Checked my account first thing and it was run first thing for the full amount. So I called. Spoke with Rina, asked what was going on, mind you she was to call me first thing this morning to give me a new total amount. She now explains that the card was ran last night, but wait I thought the Internet was down? She puts Richard on who is the higher up and he can't do anything says he has to talk to the owner. I finally said you what forget it. I just can't believe this place. Never going back for sure, be careful if they tell you their internet is not up and what they charge you. They brought out the burger without the side and when they did bring out the side it was an upgrade and here we are thinking fires comes with a burger. Food is just ok for the prices and the service is horrible!!!!"

It was my hope that the crab would be very meaty and flavorful. This was not the case at all, the mussels were very tiny and had no flavor, the king crab was good but had no seasoning and was quite salty and pretty bland and the blue crab, well that was an adventure all in its own because when we finally got to the meat it wasnt worth it because there wasn't much to eat. To top it off we ate inside and somehow our food was surrounded by flies. I am not one to write reviews but if youre expecting anything close to hot and juicy or boiling crab like I was you're in for a disappointment."

I definitely prefer this location to the Eastern location because the area around the restaurant is better and the dining area is more spacious. \n\nOur preferred starter is the mini crab cakes. I definitely can't complain about lack of crab here. These crab cakes are almost all crab and have very little filling. The crab here is reasonably priced and very fresh. It's also prepared perfectly so it's easy to crack the crab and get to the meat in no time. The sweet hushpuppies side is generously portioned and delicious. The flavor is great and they have a nice amount of sweetness. \n\nThe restaurant is very sports oriented so I would suggest avoiding this place on a Saturday or Sunday during football season. It says a lot about their crab if I can sit through sports to eat my crab."

When my order of mini crab cakes arrived, I was pleasantly surprised they were full of flaky, sweet blue crab.  Very tasty without much in the way of added flavorings to take away from the crab.  That led me to try the combo fried clams and catfish plate with hush puppies.  The clams were thick and sweet but the catfish a bit dry.  The blue crab soup that came with it was delicious.\nCan't wait to go back."

To start, they took our name on the back of a recites and seemed really disorganized. There were plenty of empty tables but lots of people waiting. After 20 minutes, which truly isn't bad on a Friday night, we got seated. Our waiter took our order quickly, we got the crab cakes, peeled shrimp and blue crab. The crab cakes were tiny, peeled shrimp was good, and the crab had very little meat for the $$$. Let's just say, we walked to Roberto's and each got 3rolled tacos to fill us up."

Never waited for a refill on tea or anything else despite the place being fairly crowded.  The expanded inside looks great to boot.\n\nThe other bonus for this location is there are some things to do, like gaming, video games, smoking patio and full bar.  Some people get sick of watching me crack crabs for 2 or 3 hours, so they're nice distractions.  Some of the best seafood I've had in this town and at more than fair prices.\n\nIf you're in the mood for fresh shellfish, crab cakes, or boardwalk fries, this is the place.

Not quite sure if this technique is really professional or even more efficient than the old fashion way, but I guess that's just how they do things here & I have no problem with that.\n\nLet's move on, the food I absolutely love! I am a seafood fanatic & this place is one of my favorite places to go. They give you good portions especially for their snow crab legs. The only problem I have is that they charge an outrageous amount for a half a pound of shrimp. I think it was either $8.99 or $9.99. Personally I can go somewhere else for cheaper shrimp that tastes the same, but I still sometimes come here anyway.\n\nApparently the service is hit or miss, but I never have bad service when I go there.

After he brought us our drinks, he then took our order of 8 blue crabs (Tuesday's special at $2/crab) and an order of black mussels. We waited for about 10 minutes until the crabs arrived, however there was no sign of the black mussels nor did Kyle tell us that the mussels would be coming up shortly. That's fine we thought. We figured the mussels would arrive soon. 15 minutes into our enjoyment of the crabs, we realized that our order of mussels had yet to arrive. Ok, we'll just ask Kyle about the order of mussels when he checks up on us or when he returns to refill our drinks. \n\nTurns out that would never happen. \n\nNot once did Kyle check up on us or refill our drinks until well afterward as we were finishing up our meal. One of the other servers (his name was David, I believe, and he appeared to be a senior member of the staff) took it upon himself to refill our drinks and ask us if we needed more crabs. If it weren't for David, we would still be waiting there to have our drinks refilled and our second order of crabs taken. Prior and after David approaching us, we would notice Kyle walk by and glance at our table several times during our meal. Not once did he ask us if the meal was to our liking nor did he refill our drinks. It seems that he didn't notice our drinks (or lack there of) or that he just couldn't be bothered to refill them. We were not about to ask to have our drinks refilled nor ask about our missing order of mussels because we as paying customers feel that we SHOULD NOT HAVE TO. The server should be looking after the customer frequently and making sure that every need is met without having to be flagged down or asked. \nOnly at the very end of our meal did Kyle finally approach us and ask us if we needed anything else. By that point I didn't even mention the order of mussels that we never received and just asked for refills of our water. I would only mention the missing order of mussels if they showed up on our bill (it did not, which is another issue entirely). \n\nWe've been here several times before and have usually had good service. \n\nThis was not one of those times."

We ate family style and there was plenty to go around.  They covered the table with brown paper and gave us all bibs and wooden mallets.  Seafood is super fresh and tastes wonderful.  Staff is very knowledgeable about the menu.  Highly recommend trying this off strip restaurant if you live in Vegas or are just visiting."

The groupon drink of $15 for a glass of alcohol mix is quite a joke. It tastes no better than a pre-mixed Costco type of drink. The service is fair, not great but not horrible. The food is good but way too expensive as it comes to a small tiny portion. Two order of crab cakes cost almost $28 but it is just like an appetizer. If your budget is less than $40-$50 per person, this is not a place for you. It all explained why this restaurant is quite empty and not sure if it is in business for long if they still keep the cost of their food that high. This is not the Strip to charge that premium price."

We were obviously there for a special occasion (wrapped presents, decorated cupcakes, etc.) and most restaurants would have taken note of that. My friend who walks with difficulty was not treated with deference (pulling out chair, taking care of her cane, etc.) Young people don't care if you can walk, just so you can pay.\nI'm writing all this in hopes that management actually reads their reviews because I want them to improve and then stay around for a long time.

The oysters are $1 during happy hour 2-6 during the week and on Sunday's. I ordered 8 to start. I was really happy to see they were on the small side as I hate large chunky oysters. The flavor was so good I slurped them down In a couple minutes and ordered a dozen more to enjoy. The Calamari was some of the best I have had. Really crunchy.. Mmm. We ordered a lobster, king crab, fries and co slaw . Everything was so freaking good. It was the best meal I have had all year! Jeremy was nice enough to bring us out some blue crab to try as there was a mistake In the kitchen. We were having trouble getting the meat out so he showed us the expert way to open it. Way too much work for me but I appreciated him letting having us experience it. We topped off the meal with some rich chocolate cake. I think it was the 1st time my husband and I have cleared the table in a long time, licking our fingers on the way out. \n\nYou will definitely see me back here and with friends!"

If you like deep fried everything (especially seafood) then, seriously, look no further. \n\nThis place is very large.  It has lots of space, several TVs, a big bar and a great patio. The smell (seafood) is very strong when you walk in the door which kind of killed my appetite a little. The staff is great.  There was one guy, who was playing host, waiter, and bus boy.  He was doing an excellent job too - very friendly and super quick. \n\nWe ate: \nBoardwalk Fries - Pretty tasty and very well seasoned. \nCod - This was beer battered and fried. By far the heaviest thing we ordered. \nCatfish - \"Lightly\" breaded and fried.\nOnion Rings \nHush Puppies\nPretty much all of this tasted the same and all of it tasted like greasy breading with the exception of the Cod which had a nice vinegar finish.  I kind of dug it, but I was starting to feel really gross by the time I tasted this. \nMy husband really liked the hush puppies (I thought they were kind of so so) and he also thoroughly enjoyed his soft shell crab sandwich.  \n\nI HATE to give such a low star review and was fully prepared to 3 star this place and move on. Then, hoping to salvage the meal by treating myself to a rare something sweet, I ordered the only dessert on the menu - the snow ball.  I'm sorry but this thing was unforgivable.  If you are going to put a snow cone on your restaurant menu, it should probably be a dang good snow cone. I've had better ones served to me by 9 year olds at little league games. \n\nI Probably will not return."

She was excruciating slow and there weren't even a lot of other patrons there. If they were busy and the service was slow, I would understand. But there was no reason for the crappy slow service we received. She never came to ask us for refills on our drinks and we had to wait another 10 minutes for her to finally get around to taking our bill and running our credit card. She was unfriendly and it was just very obvious she didn't give a crap. I almost never leave bad tips because I understand servers receive most of their pay from tips, but I left a very small tip because she honestly didn't deserve a good one.\n\nI may be willing to give this place another shot, maybe order something else from the menu.

Me and my wife came in expecting to do the AYCE crab special that was on Monday nights. We came into the restaurant and it reeked of old bay seasoning and that bad fish smell you find in old markets. We weren't too upset by this, just figured it was part of the atmosphere. We ordered our food and had about 6-8 very small blue crabs dropped off at our table. We have never eaten crabs like this before and how no idea how to do it, but the waiter just left them there on the table and walked away. There was very little meat in the crabs and the act of ripping them open and seeing the \"gut mustard\" was absolutely disgusting and enough to ruin our appetite. We attempted to eat it and realized there was no way we would get full or even stomach it. The manager told us he would charge us for 6 of the crabs plus our appetizers and that he would bring us out some King Crab legs that we ordered instead. The crab legs were good but after our clothes and body were covered in crab juice and old bay seasoning, we weren't able to enjoy it from the stench that was burned into our nostrils.  We didn't expect what happened next, the waiter gave us our bill for $80 which included the crab we didn't even eat... What type of customer service is that? Especially in Las Vegas... I do not see this place surviving here long and definitely warn people to avoid it, not worth the time, money, or the amount of detergent it will take to get that smell out of your clothes."

The cook was kind enough to ask me how the food was, so that was nice of him to do that.  i did not offer any input to him....doing it here.\nmuch to be desired, but larger portions, and make sure that you know what you are ordering before the server leaves the table."

I came for the crab but also ordered fried oysters and raw oysters. The oysters are not particularly impressive but we're fairly cheap at $1.75 each. \n\nNow the crabs were quite delicious! I only ordered a few, but they dump the crabs onto the table and you start grabbing it for the table like a barbarian which is quite satisfying. The crabs were surprisingly hot when we got them, and quite meaty as well. The salty/cajun seasoning is really good, but I was full after 5 crabs. A great experience overall but would love to have the place be a bit more busy and lively for a better experience."

I will be doing a random task and a craving for that dip will hit me. It is a little alarming but speaks to the power of that crab dip. \n\nWe stayed for trivia after a Monday night game and we had a blast. The host was a great heckler. The only problem was that a team was sitting on the patio and clearly using their smartphones to find the answers. We discretely notified the host and his assistant but they did not do anything about it. No surprise here but that team did win. They won a big bar tab and left a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth."

So I see yelp and this place that looked like they had a Maryland feel. Not even close to crab cake sandwiches in Maryland. Also the calamari fries were not seasoned at all, very tasteless. I know its a seafood restaurant, but as I walked in the aroma of spoiled seafood hit my nose.  Other yelp reviews complained about the service. I did not experience anything wrong with the service, it was fine to me, just the food didn't taste anything like it did in Maryland to me for the same prices. Don't think I'll be back."

Is it just me, but shouldn't  your entree come out after you have finished an appetizer?  I think management needs to get more involved.

The fourth person in party ordered another seafood platter which was tasteless and hush puppies that tasted stale. Again friendly staff but the $90 bill tasted more like $30.

They put very little binder in it, it was made up of almost all, and I mean all, crab! So good. I enjoyed lunch so much, ended up going again with the family for dinner. It was louder and busier, very much a pub setting. Had the fried clam dinner. Again, excellent. The clams were huge, much larger than I've ever had. Hubby had the shrimp, and it did not disappoint. It's great to have an authentic Maryland seafood restaurant on the southwest side of town. Worth the trip even if you are across town."

THIS WAS A NEW RULE THAT JUST STARTED TODAY, so yesterday they served the blue crab at happy hour... So I asked why he couldn't serve the happy hour blue crab and he said because it's too expensive for them to let customers order from the happy hour menu. So I asked why it was on the menu with a price if he didn't want to serve it at that price and why \"market price or it changes\"  wasn't written there and his solution was to remove the menu from the table and said \"that's how to fix that\"  but you can buy the entree crab... \n\nAs an establishment the restaurant creates the price for each item, and they just decided that they didn't want to serve it for that price without changing the menu or anything.\n\nTHE MANAGER DIDN'T EVEN TELL HIS SERVERS ABOUT THIS NEW RULE UNTIL AFTER I ALREADY ORDERED MY DISH\n\nThe waitress was very nice but it didn't make up for the managers incompetence. They should just take it off the menu or serve the dish. \n\nP.s the bread with the clams is just a hamburger bun and the clams were whatever...

Unless your body is used to eating massive amounts of fried food you may want to steer clear of this. I felt awful and hated myself the rest of the day. \n\nOur server, Jared, was well past the 'unhelpful' threshold and operated in the 'rude' category. Here's a fun exchange showing how helpful he was (verbatim):\nMe: How much are 6 crabs?\nJared: They are priced by the dozen.\nMe: How much are a dozen?\nJared: What size?\nMe: ?...Medium.\nJared: $64\nI think this whole exchange could have been shortened. But granted he did then tell me 6 would be $32 since I apparently don't look like the type that can do complex math with the facts thus provided. \n\nAs I awaited him to come by so I could request the check, the ample time allowed me to check-in and find a deal for \"any beer for $3\"! Thanks Yelp! I asked to apply that to my bill as well as inform him we'd be using a Living Social. He balked at this saying you can only use one \"discount\". I scoffed right back so I was allowed to use both after a talk with the manager...\"but just this once.\"\n\nNow I'm not sure if anyone else is with me, but I don't consider Groupons or Living Socials \"discounts\". They are marketing tools made 1) to get customers into the restaurant, 2) are pre-purchased, and 3) are known sunk costs. Whereas discounts/coupons are used to get people in but that's where the similarities end - they do not know how many people will take advantage of it, etc. Who's with me?\n\nWell we could talk the finer points of economics all day but I will close with the fact that I do not recommend this place at all."

            "review": "I remember sampling this place at its original location on the Eastside about a year ago.  It has since expanded, fortunately much closer to home.  It is as good as I remember it and then some.\n\nIt went from a small local joint to a hub for sports, great food and Maryland patronage.  One of the head honcho's, I believe named Jay, was still on the front lines getting down.  During our first meeting, he was kind enough to offer us deals on flying in bulk crawfish in from the south since we mentioned that we often threw crab and crawfish boil parties.  In fact, all staff are very welcoming and good peoples.  Not too mention, it's good to see some Pinoys competing in the industry that I have learned to be cornered by some old timers and my Viet homies, especially in Cali (ie. Boiling Crab, etc.)\n\nThe menu has expanded as well.  Aside from the typical grinds from hush puppies, fish/chips, oysters and crab cakes, I noticed lots more added such as (real) crab dip and bacon wrapped scallops.  \n\nBut the fact remains, this place is built on cornering the niche that no one else has in the valley, blue crab!  Not just any old blue crab, Maryland style baby!  Although some compassion about the work expended when eating crawfish and blue crab, it's all about the entire experience, not too mention, these crabs are streamed just above rare, I can just imagine Katsumoto uttering...perrrfecct #lastsamurai.\n\nTopped with that Maryland spice and throw in the Filipino vinegar, and you got yourself a feast line no other.  The trick is to get the large or jumbo female blue crab, that way when you pop em open, all the savory goodness can be enjoyed with a bowl of white steamed rice, gotta get yo starches in complete the meal.  Booyahh!   BTW, my wife says the (real) crab cakes here is one of the best she ever had [Drake voice].\n\nOh, and I almost forgot to mention, happy hour starts at 2:00 p.m. and ruins until 6:00 p.m.  what a way to put a cherry on the crab cake.  I gotta go with the drafts for $3 a pop and the Crabby Mary is definitely a treat.  Just know, this place is ran by Terps, yet no turtles are served in the menu.  So if you root for the Ravens, the Terapins or anything else Marlylandish, roll through and be ready to get crackin'."

Ordered the crab dip and the crab cakes as well. Those were delicious. I came in expecting to get the jumbo crabs however they ran out and only had regular and medium sized crabs. Both were very small. Also, I had to send two sets of crabs back because the meat was mushy. Overall it's an okay place. Kinda expensive. If they would've had the jumbo crabs in stock then I would've bumped it up a star."

I would have to say the vibe has gone down significantly.  Seems way more quiet.  The servers are much better though, with more sense of urgency. \n\nI always go for the female blue crabs. They are the best when their eggs are in season. Throw in some old bay seasoning into my butter... Yum!  \nLittle neck clams never disappoint. That garlic butter soaked up in the bread wow. \nLobster bisque is nice and creamy. Never skimps on the lobster meat. \n\nI never go for oysters here... I've tried many times this just isn't the place for them. \n\nI'll always like the food here."

Always a great time and upbeat positive energy.  Ashley always makes us feel at home.  We eat and drink way past our bedtime on many occasions....

We ordered just what they are known for...Crabs! They had the $3/large crab special. Ordered 8pcs, 2 orders of white rice, and lobster bisque.\n\nFirst off, we were greeted promptly and seated right away as soon as we walked in. That was instantly a relief since those were some of the issues of patrons here. We were handed menus and order was taken about 7 minutes later by our very friendly server. \n\nThen our order came, as soon as I opened my first crab, it was love at first sight! It was meaty, full of crab butter, and steamed just perfectly!!! That just sealed the deal for us. Our server served all of our side dishes, limes, vinegar, drinks at one time so we never had to flag him for anything. We devoured and enjoyed our crabs dipped in spicy vinegar. \n\nThis place was truly above and beyond my expectations. Everything went smoothly service and quality of food wise. Although, I cannot speak for the other items they have for their menu since we only ordered what they are popular for, and that is their crabs.  Yelp is a great source in our dining choices but it does not always determine the outcome of our dining experience. One customer might have a horrible time but it doesn't mean you will too. Sometimes people could be ordering items that are not really their specialty so you cannot really set your expectations high. I remember dining at a vietnamese restaurant that served one of the best Pho' but their Pad Thai was anything but great.  So always give a place the benefit of the doubt and stick to the highlights of their menu.\n\nWe sure glad we did because we have just discovered a hidden gem next time we crave for blue crabs at a very reasonable price!"

I had no complaints until this past Tuesday when I came for their daily special (that they happen to advertise pretty heavily and regularly on their website, Facebook and Twitter). When we get there, the guy tells us they didn't get that many crabs that day so there are no females and no special on the crabs. I thought that was fair, but assumed the drink specials ($2 Rolling Rock or PBR) would still be in effect... unless, God forbid, the availability of beer in the city suddenly drops overnight. Ended up being charged full price for the beer though so had to deduct a star.\n\nBut... like I said, food is solid and good vibes abound so I'll be back whenever the urge for Maryland style crabs hits me (which happens far too frequently)."

Came with the typical lemon, horse radish and cocktail sauce. They weren't the best but for $1 each... Totally worth it. For my entree, I had the crab cake sandwich. The food took a while to come out but when it finally did, I must say... I was pretty impressed. The crab cake was huge! It was a little bland but nothing a touch of ketchup and ranch can't fix. My mom got the soft shell crab sandwich. The crab on hers was huge too! She had to rip off the arms so that she could get a grip on the sandwich. We also ordered a side of French fries but they ran out so have us boardwalk fries (at no extra charge) instead. I would have preferred the regular fries because the boardwalk was too salty for me. Oh well. \n\nThe restaurant is very open. Staff... Super friendly and welcoming. The one thing that really bugged me was the fact that the waiters take the orders on their cell phones. At first, I thought our waiter was in the middle of a text message, or tweet, or what have you... While taking our appetizer order. I was a little offended and felt very uncomfortable. When she came back to take our entree order, she bent down a little and that's when I realized she was punching in our order on her phone! I get that technology is the way to go nowadays but c'mon! It was such an awkward situation. My mom thought she was being extremely rude so I had to explain to her that she was just doing her job. I hope management realizes this and changes the way they take orders because if I had not seen her screen, I would have never known! \n\nCrab corner definitely has the potential for improvement. I'm gonna be coming here again sometime in the future and I would love to give them more stars. But for now, I'm sticking with a 3."

We were in a group of six and the waiter got everything ordered in a timely manner and all the orders were correct. We had been planning this trip for a month and I was excited to try the Blue Crab. We learned from the waiter that they had only King Crab or Snow Crab, no Blue Crab at all. They hadn't had Blue Crab for 4 days. The menu and advertisements place a huge emphasis on Blue Crab being available for a variety of options, but to our disappointment a lot of the menu was not available to us due to the lack of Blue Crab. \n\nWe ended up ordering fish, shrimp, oysters; they were mediocre at best. I can get deep fried seafood at many other places as long as they have a fry basket. The one thing that had the potential to satisfy me were the bacon-wrapped scallops but they were not very good either. They were small under-cooked bay scallops wrapped in bland fatty bacon. \n\nUnfortunately we will not be returning to this place and most likely will not try the location on Eastern either."

I am assuming they have been limited on their seafood intake as far as quality, or we just had the unfortunate night of a new cook.

Funny thing is, good food and service, we tip well. Servers tip would have been much more then the added gratuity. WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN!!!"

Ordered a half dozen oysters on the half shell as an appetizer. What a joke. 4 of the 7 oysters they gave us had absolutely no meat in them. It just looked like gray slime. So I am sure that's why we got an extra one to try to make up for the pathetic ones. And they had the nerve to charge $10.50 for them. I've had better oysters at AYCE sushi restaurants in this town or even Tides Oyster Bar @ Sunset Station. Ordered the soft shell crab sandwich for $13.99 (I believe). It was good I have to say but I have again had better. Tarter sauce was good though. I don't know that I'd particularly go back to this place & spend my hard earned dough when I know other places that have better food. Possibly only for happy hour when items are discounted."

The food is excellent!  the crab cakes are delicious, the crabs are mouth watering and you can't go wrong with the seasoned fries. Anyone complaining about how long it takes for the food to come out is full of it. It takes time to steam crabs, it takes time to prep it, it takes time for freshly made food to be delivered to your table. If you come in here thinking it's a fast food joint, you're wrong and need to go somewhere else like McDonalds. If you have any issues, ask for my man David. He'll immediately fix it for you."

I used to go to 3 Tomatoes all the time on the weekends, so it was exciting to be back.\n\nThe exterior hasn't changed at all.  The interior really hasn't either, except now they have a huge tank with live blue crab, and they've painted a little...\n\nNow, onto the food.\n\nEver since my last experience at Crab Corner, I've wanted to try the crab cakes.  My fella isn't big on crab cakes, but agreed to get the appetizer (4 minis) to try.  \n\nWhen they came out, I was concerned.  They are TINY...and really expensive.  \nBut after one bite, let me tell you, they were 100% worth the money.\nThere is SO MUCH CRAB MEAT IN THESE TINY BITES OF AWESOME!  This is going to be a regular item for me, I can tell.  SO delicious. \n\nWe also had the cod, and the clams with hush puppies and fries:  Everything was delicious!  \n\nDrinks were pretty decent...they had a $3 mystery shot, and $3 well whiskey....PBR was $4 at the beginning of the night, but I think it went down to $3 after karaoke started. \n\nService was pretty good.  The bartender seemed a little abrasive at the beginning of the night, but she warmed up to us, and ended up being pretty darned cool.  \n\nKaraoke was incredible, as usual.  The host was fun, and it was great to be singing on the patio again!\n\nI can't wait to come back again.  Karaoke was shut down early this week, but from what I understand its supposed to be 10-2 this Friday night."

My husband requested a dozen crabs to share with my son and the waiter recommended only getting one crab per person. We waited an hour to receive our food. I ordered two appetizers and I was pleased with my food but my husband and my son were starving after finishing their one crab.

It is a little difficult to get to from the 215, but it is a gorgeous place. Full bar, all of the MD/Baltimore items,  flat screen tvs, and much larger. They also seem to offer more specials- lunch, happy hour, etc.\n\nI just ordered takeout- a crab cake sandwich and an order of Boardwalk fries. I did think that it was a little pricey ($20), but the sandwich was delicious. It would probably benefit from mayo or some kind of sauce on it, but the crab cake was full of meat, nicely seasoned, and the bread was tasty too. The fries were just fine, nothing really to write home about. \n\nHopefully I'll be able to return soon for a full meal here!"

When we walked in we saw a table of endless crab piled high, however, since breakfast wasn't hours and hours ago for us, we decided on appetizers. WRONG CHOICE TO MAKE..\n I started w/the Maryland Crab soup which tasted exactly like it came from a can. I had two bites and couldn't tolerate the \"can\" remnants left on my tongue. Slowly (very slowly) our 3 appetizers came out to the table by two (the only two) waiters in the place who would play a video game each and every time they passed the large, out of place, golf game. As my  Pepsi cup sat empty, I watched as both waiters made direct beelines for the game at every opportunity they could- which was about every 30 seconds....\n So, out came our  undercooked Scallops wrapped in  beyond burnt bacon, our Calamari fries that did not taste or look anything comparable to Calamari, and the Crab cakes- which were the ONLY food we had that we both actually enjoyed....\n  I would ONLY come back to try their Mon special which is endless crabs piled on the table.. I grew up on Long Island, and we LOVEd to go crabbing- so when family comes into town we will go back for the CRABS ONLY...... CRABS and soda- that's it..........\n  Good luck folks........"

I like that they have a Shuffleboard table, Corn Hole and Beer Pong which makes hanging out with my friends all the more fun.  I met the owners (2 brothers) and they are super passionate about everything Maryland and always have a great game playing on the 9 TV's so you are not going to miss anything.  (yes I am a football fan)  They also make sure to get the Freshest Seafood possible (which I love) by having LIVE blue crab flown in daily!  I asked for the secret recipe for the crab dip but there was no way I was going to get it.  :O)\n\nNow about my favorite items on the menu.......  I am a huge foodie and love trying different food and immediately fell in love with multiple menu items.  I know blue crab is a little more work but once you get crab picking down the meat is sweet and delicious and worth the little mess that comes with it.

Nice seasoning, and not an overwhelming boil like some of the other places. It's great to actually taste the meat, and crab was fresh. Plus it comes 1 1/4 lbs, so you end up with two full knuckles. Small detractor: no good crab tools, just some janky plastic knife that was pretty ineffective against the shells \n\nSides: corn was nice, but maybe a little over priced for a single ear. Fries were great!\n\nClams: oh yeaaaaah those were good! Garlic butter style was perfect, just the way I like them! \n\nMenu: disjointed, hard to find what you want. Needs a reformat. The flip book on the table has some treasure that should be on the main menu. \n\nStaff: kind of laying about the place, but very friendly. It was slow when I came, so probably bored. \n\n\nOverall, I think the owner needs to decide if this is going to be a sports bar or a crab shack. Regardless, the food was great, and if my gal has anything to say we will be back again."

Expect that you will be treated lowly when you present the coupon from Groupon.   There is a reason they are in the 80% for recommended on Groupon.  The food was good, but would say for the price...nothing to brag about.   As for the service... Read the reviews of others... It's a hit/miss.

And, I should have known, because the place was almost empty on a Friday night, during Lent.  I ordered the same dish as before; cod was still bad.  It didn't end there though... I was given marinara sauce instead of cocktail sauce for my shrimp, and half of my hush puppies were straight up RAW inside.  Once again, I left disappointed, and will not be back again.  It's a shame, because we need a good fish restaurant on this side of town.  Sadly, this isn't it.  Still two stars though for their awesome potato salad (it's now really the only thing I can count on there), and so-so service.  Not good, but not horrible either.  I'm wondering if it's worth trying the original location that I fell in love with, but not sure it's worth the risk for the price."

Crab Corner is chock full of Terps and Ravens memorabilia plus a pretty awesome crab tank in the middle of the place. Surprised there was no Redskins stuff but then again that team is terrible. overall the place is really large which would be good if I had a party. I did not so I sat at the bar.\n\nThe server was attentive and since it was a work trip I decided to splurge with a little of everything. First up raw oysters. While not for everyone I am a big fan and these did not disappoint. The shell is pretty deep so it was like a bowl of oyster. Next up was the bacon wrapped scallops. They were super hot so it needed a good cut in the middle and some the apricot sauce it comes with. It's bacon and scallops so you know it's amazing.\n\nFor my meal I ordered a five large crabs. Tons of meat with a good spice on top of it. Not old bay but something similar. By time I was pretty full but enjoyed the meal. I will definitely be back again the next time in Vegas and hopefully with a group."

The food was WAY too over-salted and over-spiced, to the point where you couldn't even taste the fish and were left guzzling water all night. It was highly distracting and completely unsatisfying.

            "review": "To be fair I am originally from Maryland so my standards for a place that claims to have Maryland style seafood might be high but it also meant I was super stoked to try this place out. We had a group on deal that was purchased for $15 for 25$ worth of food. Upon arrival we were seated by a hostess who took our drink orders. The server \"Richard\" came up to take our order with a smile but using his iphone. I was having dinner with my Mother and two children aged 7 and 4 . Since  the restaurant only has two items on their kids menu - Fried Shrimp or Chicken strips I was forced to get my 7 year old a adult entree of spice and peel  shrimp which turned out to be my favorite thing in the whole place. My Mother got a order of Boardwalk fries and the Annapolis Crab Dip (Sliced toasted baguette covered with rich cream cheese & crab meat) yes it was a appetizer but she ordered it as her entree and they brought it out FIRST which is a personal pet peeve of mine but hey at least they didn't let it get cold right?  The dip appeared to have tons of crab in it but it was majorly lacking flavor and the Baguettes were very chewy and not anything I would order again especially for the price . We were pleased it didn't have a artificial crab flavor. Since our server was no where to be found we weren't able to locate the Old Bay till the end our meal but it helped with the flavor a bit. I ordered the Pick 2 Combo Entree  which they have a decent number of options to pick from I went with Fried Oysters (My personal Fav anywhere that serves them) and Fried Clams which comes with two sides (I went with hush puppies and potato salad) for 12.99. I thought it was a pretty good deal $ wise. My Oysters were really good but my clams were way over cooked same with the hush puppies. When the host lady brought my food I didn't notice until I went to ask for Tartar sauce that my potato salad was missing and this is why my rating ended up being a 2 instead of a  3. I advised her that my potato salad must of been forgotten and that we were still waiting on the fries instead of a let me check on where those are or a sorry she said and I quote \" No Maam it just wasn't ready yet so it didn't get brought out\"  so to me that was just really rude because I have been many places and they do not prepare potato salad made to order it's essentially just a scoop which I did eventually get . She didn't bring my tartar sauce and when I finally flagged down our server \"Richard\" he did say sorry and that he would get my potato salad and check on my Moms fries. Guess what? he brought my potato salad but didn't bring my tartar sauce which was what I wanted all along so by the time I was able to eat my yummy oysters they were cold and I was already annoyed. The boardwalk fries did finally come out once we were almost done with our whole meal but Richard was kind enough to try to rectify my upset by comping us for the fries which turned out to be somewhat of a saving grace but I still wouldn't go back to this place again. The service needs improvement and for the price the food just doesn't outweigh the slow turnover and mediocre job on the items. The peel and eat shrimp really was delicious though and if you are dying for a place where you can pick your own crab and enjoy some spicy shrimp its worth checking out but I can't say I will be back."

Pricey, Plan to spend $13+ for lunch. We consider this expensive for a work day lunch. So, we opted for the special soup which was $8 for a styrofoam bowl full. *shudders at styrofoam*  The waiter raved about the crab soup over the lobster bisque so we tried it. My co worker liked it, but I only ate half which is highly unusual for me. It was a bit fishy for my liking, seemed they were masking smelly cheap crab with too heavy paste like cream & lots of pepper. Even ran into a shell chip or two. Ick. The only thing that got me really crabby ( bad pun) was it took over 1/2 hour for them to ladle out 2 bowls of soup, plunk down a handful of saltines, and napkins. Ridiculous! I will say the hush puppies we split were top notch.. The ambience is horrible, school bus yellow walls with stop sign red below chair rail, think nursery school, or sports team. Ya I get they're football fans but its a bit too teenage boys bedroom. Coincidentally, all the wait staff & cooks were younger asian men...Not sure what that means? Its an oxymoron, I don't put Maryland crab expertise..think fishermen, think sea captains, think east coast old world, think Loyola, ...with surfer dudes toting iPods.  Either way, Service was laughably bad, food pricey for fried fare, ambience none existent. Doubt we will return."

We had a Groupon that included bottomless brunch drinks and $15 food credit. The Bloody Mary was extremely too salty. Pretty much undrinkable. I ordered a beer to add to the bloody but the server never offered to remake it.  We ordered some blue crabs which were okay but seemed slightly under cooked. We switched over to the Sangria which was pretty good but tasted like it was Franzia or maybe from a box. What really got to me was just when the Bears go into overtime the server or maybe owner switched EVERY TV in the place to the Ravens game. We had been there for two hours watching the whole game and he REFUSED to leave one tv on for me to catch the end of the Bears game. He could tell I was extremely upset and just said sorry there is nothing I can do, this is a Ravens bar. That was extremely disappointing to me. Bad customer service in my opinion. The service wasn't bad but this was a deal breaker for me. We still left a 25% tip but I'm not sure if I'll be back which makes me sad because I really liked this place. :("

The guy that worked there, told me that on Thursdays it was $3 for a large Maryland blue crab. I couldn't pass up that deal. You need to get here early. Once they sell out of the crabs, that's it. You're either going to have to order another size or wait for another day. Sometimes, they don't get the crabs in, so the guy told me to call first. \n\nTheir crabs are flown in fresh. It was so fresh, sweet, and yummy. On Tuesday, I ordered four. On Thursday, I ordered three. They were broiled with Old Bay seasoning sprinkled on the shell. They were all delicious. I also had the crab cakes. They're the best crab cakes ever. Every bite of the crab cake had chunks of meat and very little filling. It was seasoned to bring out the freshness of the crab. I also ordered the sweet potato fries. It was a huge portion and fried perfectly.\n\nMy husband doesn't like seafood so he ordered the grilled cheese sandwich that came with chips. He said the sandwich was good and stuffed with cheese. He didn't finish the chips. It might have needed more salt or seasoning. He also got the mozzarella sticks for his appetizer and polished those off. They were really good with the marinara dip.\n\nThe guys working there were really friendly. We talked story and about football. We needed directions to Trader Joe's and they were more than happy to help. One of the guys even helped me with my fantasy football pick.\n\nI told the guy that they needed to open up a spot on Oahu. He smiled and said that the prices weren't going to be the same, shipping charges to Hawaii are horrendous. It's the story of my life. If I lived in Vegas, I would be here every Tuesday and Thursday. I want to fly back just for this. It was the best meal that I had in Vegas."

            "review": "**** WARNING -- BUGS ****** WORST experience ever!!! A huge COCKROACH crawled across my table. Not a small baby, a huge roach about an inch and a half long and half inch wide crawled across my table in the later half of my meal. I immediately got up, in disgust and walked away from my table. Several waiters/waitresses stood by, offering no assistance ... When I spoke to a manager (moments later) he told me I was to pay for my meal in full or he would call the cops!!! I was SO outraged. As I offered to tip my waiter accordingly, but did not feel it was right for me to pay for this meal, he called the cops on me and I stayed in the restaurant till they arrived. The cops told me if I didn't pay I would get a ticket for stealing. So I payed for the meal, and left in a complete outrage - not to mention totally disgusted. I have never experienced such unprofessional or worse treatment from an owner of a restaurant (apparently that's who I spoke to when I asked for a manager, he claimed to be the half owner)  I Will do everything in my power, to detour business from this establishment. Absolute worst restaurant experience of my life.  I only put one star because I have to, to post this review. \n\nBefore the roach appeared, I was not too impressed with the meal anyways. I had the crab cakes. Very dry and bland. I recommend The Boiling Crab or Hot & Juicy for anyone who seeks a proper seafood experience."

            "review": "This review is not meant to pan Crab Corner, but help it a bit. The food is good for the Eastern Ave. location that is more reminiscent of Eastern Ave. in Essex, but with the new location that is a bit more like Cockeysville or Reisterstown. A better location with hopefully better food. This review is also the culmination of about 10 visits over a few months. \n\nFirst of all the crabs are good. It's great to have a bit of home in Vegas but your staple can't carry the entire business. Let's look at some of the other food. The crab dip is horrendous in style and presentation. It's small French bread slices with the crab dip on the toasted bread. It needs to be a hot creamy bowl that the warm French bread is dipped into presented on a seperate basket on the side...that's how it's been every time I've ordered it in Bal'mer. Every time I order it I feel a bit cheated. \n\nI don't always have time to order the crabs and when taking a client there for lunch have to order off the limited menu. I end up with the shrimp salad sandwich because it's quick and easy. However, every time I order it's described as 'large spiced shrimp' and I always get it and feel cheated yet again. They are quite small and not up to normal Baltimore restaurant size (or at least what I'm use to from Little Lou's). They could be a bit bigger and offer a choice of buns like a roll since small shrimp are hard to eat on a sandwich roll in an earth-like gravity. \n\nThe steamer sampler is good, however the crabs are female (I NEVER eat females as they decrease the population) and feel it should be mentioned on the menu before ordering. I would like to see a choice of sauces like Bertha's. You can be Bal'mer style without directly copying. \n\nOK, with the menu choices are kinda lax. I would like to see burgers and local favorites like crab burger or hot & Bleu burger.\n\nI know you can't get Boh, but would like to see more local Beers like Dogfish Head IPA. It's a crab staple in MD and readily available here. \n\nI hope to see Crab Corner improve as it grows."

I ordered the cod with fried oysters, board walk fries and slaw. I have definitely had better...\n\nThe cod was like any other in town with the exception of long John silver (that place is hell). I was really looking forward to the oysters but unfortunately the batter was soggy and made for an unpleasant experience. Fries are fries and the slaw lacked seasoning. Oh well...the whole experience was an hour that felt like a lifetime. This included waiting to get my check and pay.  If there is an upside...the people are courteous. \n\nPerhaps I will try it for happy hour and see if it is any better."

Settled on 2 combo plates; shrimp & clams and cod and clams. Side dishes were onion rings, French fries and dinner salads. The salads were fresh and actually pretty good. Everything else we ordered was fried which may be where we went wrong. The cod was oil soaked, shrimp was edible but dense in a strange kind of way and the clams had a rubber band texture. The French fries were pretty good. Service was acceptable but I am pretty much convinced if you are not going for the actual crab fest, go elsewhere. I did see a few other diners hitting crab platters pretty hard and looking happy."

This is our second time to the new place. \nWe know the food will be good and consistent in quality. The servings are fair, always tastes fresh and a good value for the price. \nWe have become used to be treated like weekly regulars at Eastern, being recognized and acknowledged by staff even only visiting every 3-4months. The same treatment was received at the SW location on our first visit. Last night our service was poor at best. The young man was inattentive and ignored us for the majority of time we were there. The rest of the wait staff were not interested in covering for one another, walking by numerous times without inquiring about our needs. The waiter wanted to blame the poor service on \"busy\", not really for a Friday evening and being shorthanded, not really. I think there was no manager on duty....\nGreat food, poor service. We can find that many places. We will visit Eastern next time, hope the experience improves, or find a new place..... Really bums me out....."

The service in order to get someone's attention needed to flap my hands like I am taking off crazy. The crab cake was good but everything else was very disappointing and over prided and had 8 crab sizes on wall but only had 1 size also when asked about the 2$ blue crab told not available only 3$ so we were stuck for price. Wife not happy for birthday choice and now everyone knows \" happy wife happy life\" not this time. Hope the manager and owners read this."

            "review": "Stepping inside of the Crab Corner immediately made me reminisce of the former failed Italian eatery once in its place. The memories were easily found with the same set-up, even with alignment remaining the same. This should have been more than a hint, but of course we proceeded to order.\n\nThe menu was basic, but much listed as 'market' price. With the bill, the market rates seemed to be more from a greedy Wall Street banker lining their pockets on seafood futures, than from a local crab shack worth spending a dime.\n\nThe food was not bad, but very in-proportionate and served on China from a local dollar store. The table was crowded with customary sauces and shakes of seasonings, but oddly served in a Pepsi bucket as if a local sports bar.\n\nThe service was poor at best. Perhaps suited for a group of college kids out for a binge, but not to par with expectations for such high prices and very subpar presentation. \n\nIn closing I would not make this a personal recommendation, but then again know that for the same price there are wide selections of superior rated and highly frequented competitors not far off the beaten path."

            "review": "So My husband and I saw this place from Yelp and went to try. First,they didn't have any female crabs today, we ordered male crab - which means it won't have any eggs or a lot of sweet meat like a female one. Okay, that's fine, so we ordered Jumbo and Large Blue male Crabs.  However, the Jumbo was smaller than the Large size.. (even large was pretty small) Since our Jumbo was so small, the waitress brought us one more bigger size of crab later (we didn't ask for, she just brought one more and we really appreciated). The service was very nice. But the crabs were pretty bad. I felt like I spent $60 dollars to eat the SHELLS...  [I guess if you go there during the happy hour, it's different story].\nAnyways, we had to order a Lobster roll (sandwich) so we don't get grumpy after we eat in this place. However, they didn't have sweet potato fries... so they gave us some kind of chips which tasted like a week old... so we didn't eat that. Lobster roll was okay, but for $20 dollars, I won't ever order it again. Very salty and taste not that fresh.. \nOverall, the service was good, the concept of this business was okay, but food was horrible in my opinion. You could go to other cajun crab/seafood places with the same price for better quality.."

            "review": "I've come to crab corner a few times and always had a wonderful experience, today however was kind of weird. Ordered a soup and the initial one came out with a hair on it... It happens, I simply told the server and they changed it, no biggie. The lobster bisque is normally my favorite item on the menu and I can't get enough, I always order a big bowl, today it was bland and had almost no meat in it. Since I had already sent back the first soup I didn't want to complain and ate my bowl. When I wasn't satisfied I decided to order something else. The staff were very busy talking, looking at their phones, and gambling on the machines so by the time I ordered my food the rest of my party was almost done eating. The bartender even put money in the machines my friend and I were at and instructed us to play for her... It struck me as weird that they were playing the machines in their own establishment, but whatever. I think the worst was when we got our bill all together, we started pulling out our forms of payment and the bartender then decided she should split the bill after... Fine ok, wasn't a big deal. I put cash as I normally pay and my friend payed with card, she never came to give me change back, all she did was inform us that she had swapped our entrees by accident so we had payed for each-others meal... I waited and waited and never got my change. I'm normally a generous tipper... But a 60% tip????? I didn't have anything to drink... Just a soup and one entree, why was I out $40? Bartender comped my friends drinks, which was nice, but screwed me... Won't be returning anymore."

I hadn't seen it before and because I'm such a foodie I just had to try it being that I LOVE seafood! I suggested this place to a friend and she was down to try it out with me! When we walked in we were greeted by a nice guy and was told that because it was Wednesday they were running some sort of \"flip a coin night\" which consist of them flipping a quarter at 10PM and they total out your tab for whatever you've ordered up to this point.. Then if you win you get your whole bill take. Care of.. I thought to myself this is interesting.. We ordered the 8 small crab cakes for $19.99 I believe and I selected off the \"Pick Two\" menu choosing the Atlantic Cod and what we're suppose to be catfish nuggets but came out as a fillet.. No big deal I guess.. You also get two sides with that option and I preferred the corn on the cob followed by the sweet potato fries.. If I could rate my whole meal experience on a scale from 1-10 Id give them a 7.. There was nothing spectacular about my meal in fact I felt like I could've got the same quality out of the VanKemp boxed fish out the frozen food isle at the grocery store. My friend said her crab cakes were just okay as well. Being this place is new Id give it another shot and this time get some CRAB, which is what they specialize in.."

They have great happy hours and special days....Like on Wednesday during 9PM to 10PM, they have flip it or bill it (i think that's what they call it) but basically whatever you order during that hour (drinks, beer, food, etc...) you flip a coin and you call it. If you call it right, its FREE and if not, then pay your regular bill whatever it is. \n\nSo.. lets see...\n\nFOOD....good food, its not a fancy seafood place here. It's bar sooo yeah, seafood and beer and stuff. So don't wear your fancy shirt and pants. Food presentation is going to be basic, again it's not fancy, so don't whiny about presentation. The food here is fresh. I come here usually for happy hour because they have $4 blue crabs and $1 oyster. Its good, but the oyster are so small you need to order 2 dozen just to make you feel you ate a dozen oyster. \n\nPRICE....its seafood, some dish are cheap and others are little expensive just depending what type of seafood you order. \n\nPLACE...lots of parking, TV, chairs and tables. they have 3 side in that restaurant: one side is for the bar, other is for the restaurant and they also have outside tables. \n\nSTAFF... some are good and some are bad. The people who are bad are usually new staff. so obviously, they're still learning. So I cant really complain. Btw, read what on their shirt says...(pretty funny)!\n\nOne bad time... i had was when i order blue crab cake entree, and they had a little side salad. in that salad....a big huge dead moth....they gave me like 10% or 25 % off for that meal. But i still afraid to finish the remainder of the food, so i barely ate half of the meal. so i felt it's not fair just getting 10 or 25 % off for a meal i barely ate half of."

Also ordered crab cakes as an appetizer.  After the order was put in, two soups arrive.  One soup went back and a salad came out with the wrong dressing.   When we were eating, another soup and salad arrived, wtf! The crab cakes never arrived.  My colleague's shrimp arrived, but not mine after quite some time.  Then when mine arrived, it was not 1/2 lb.  My colleague did not check the bill and was charged for shrimp that was never fully delivered and for crab cakes.  Right before we left, a server stopped by with more shrimp even though we never ordered it.  They just opened, but, man...not good at all.  Look at your bill before you leave."
