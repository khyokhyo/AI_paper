            "review": "This was our last dinner in Vegas and we had a craving for Thai. Chose Lemongrass at The Aria based on the menu, and we were not disappointed.\n\nI had the Panang Curry with Duck and honestly, it was the best panang curry I've ever had in my life. Fantastic flavor, even without the duck itself. It was so delicious, I could have eaten probably three more orders of it. We also started off with the veggie spring rolls and they were quite the tasty appetizer.\n\nThe place was pretty busy about 7:30pm on a Friday night, so we ate at the bar. Service was excellent - great attitude, very attentive. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.\n\nI will forever be going back to Lemongrass in Vegas, specifically for that panang curry!"

            "review": "After some great experiences with the other eateries inside the Aria hotel, we decided to stop by Lemongrass for lunch.  Being right outside the Sky Suites entrance, we must have walked past this restaurant dozens of times. However, we noticed that it was never really busy - a possible indication of quality?  We decided to try for ourselves.\n\nWe walked up to the host stand and asked for a table for two for lunch.  We were sat promptly.  This is where the promptness of service ended.  After what seemed like a longer than normal amount of time, a server came over and took our drink orders.  We ordered hot jasmine tea and water.  After another extended period of time, we received our drinks and we placed our order.  The appetizers, as well as entrees, were brought out at different times, but not as a regulated course approach, but more like bringing out as they are prepared.  This seems to reflect poor execution of timing on the kitchen's part.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered Jellyfish, Potstickers, and Chicken Satay.  The jellyfish dish was delicious.  Crisp, fresh, with a hint of sesame, but not so much that it overpowered the dish.  The potstickers and chicken satay were unremarkable but good.\n\nOur lunch order consisted of Phad Thai and Basil Fried Rice.  Both dishes were good, safe, prepared correctly with nothing remarkable, and not any different or better than any local strip mall Thai restaurant.  In all reality, I've had better at certain strip mall Thai restaurants.\n\nI expected more from a restaurant within the walls of the Aria.  When compared to the likes of barMasa, it is a huge difference in the quality of service and food."

Although the dim sum isn't totally authentic, the items we had were still really good!\nWe enjoyed several of the items off of the regular menu as well.  I can't remember the names of the dishes but one was a mixed seafood salad that had a nice kick to it and the other was wonton noodle soup.  I wouldn't recommend the wonton noodle soup because it was bland but it was the only disappointment in the whole meal."

It was one of the restaurants that was open late at night and close by our hotel.  We ordered the beef red curry, chicken rad nah and tai chen chicken.  The food tasted good.  Service was good.  But it was a bit expensive, but again, it's Vegas so what do you expect.  Also, for a not so busy restaurant, it took awhile for the food to come out.  The waiter was nice and attentive and our waters were filled quickly.  The restaurant wasn't that busy at that time of night.  Its your basic thai food-nothing fancy or special, but overpriced."

The service is very good as i think it should when everything is so overpriced.  The quality of the food is fresh, but it won't wow you out of your pants.  \nOne thing i enjoyed is that they do have dim sum service in the mornings which was a big pleasnt suprise for me when i stayed at Aria.  Instead of waiting in line for the cafe/bakery/buffet, get some dim sum.  Avoid the pho/ noodles as they are a tad bit diluted."

            "review": "Most of the restaurants I've chosen in Vegas I've been happy with but Lemongrass not so much. Overall, the Aria is a slightly strange place. The rooms are amazing - so comfortable, amazing touch screen technology to control everything in the room, bathtub in the shower area, etc. That said, the hotel lobby is gloomy, the casino is very dark, the club is just okay, and the casino tables are not lucky!\n\nBack to Lemongrass though. It's thai-fusion and not all I'd hoped for especially with how much I love thai food. I'd be happier with more \"normal\" thai food than this spot. We tried to get the seaweed salad to start but had to send it back because it was so strange and fishy. The other dishes were not memorable either and it wasn't inexpensive. We had wine which was pretty good but the food was just not worth it. If I were to stay at the Aria again, I'd choose other restaurants for sure. I'm actually a bit surprised that Lemongrass is still there."

I went with the cashew chicken dish and an order of the pork fried rice. \nThe food came out within 15 minutes. \nThat fried rice was one of the best I have ever had! Great flavors!!

            "review": "Are you people on crack? This food was downright awful! First time in Vegas, and I was ready for some awesome food. We were staying at the Aria, and Thai is one of my favorite cuisines, so I thought we'd play it safe by eating at Lemongrass.\n\nWe started with calamari, one of my favorite foods, and it was chewy, bland, and all around blah. The other appetizer we got was the jellyfish, which is probably the only thing I would recommend--loved the sesame flavor. My entree, the Drunken Noodles, was horrendous. Flavor was bland even though I requested it \"very spicy\" and the seafood was even worse. It seemed like they just cooked it separately and threw it on top, and it wasn't even that fresh. Maybe the Southwest just isn't an Asian food mecca, but I didn't think Central Pennsylvania was either, and I have had much better Thai food back home. This food isn't just Americanized, it's gross, and especially at this price I'd definitely recommend getting your Thai fix elsewhere. To top it off, the service was a little too pushy for my taste...they kept trying to get us to order more! It was creepy!\n\nOn that note, I highly recommend the drinks here, and the atmosphere is nice. Next time I'll stick to the bar and jellyfish (well, I don't think there will be a next time actually. Sorry, Lemongrass)."

However, dishes that were tasted did not stand out from other Thai restaurants (e.g. pad thai, sweet and sour chicken). Though some of the dishes may not have that \"wow factor,\" there are some that are pretty decadent. I'm talking about their red curry. It's amazingly flavorful immaculate Thai dish. Just make sure to not order it too spicy otherwise you won't get to indulge in its rich flavor. Try out the coconut ice cream. It is sublime."

We went with a large group and I think everyone liked their food. I ordered yellow curry and some wine, and both were tasty. For dessert we ordered the mango sticky rice, fried banana, and something with coconut (I can't remember what it was). All of those were awesome. The prices were also decent--I think my meal was ~$15 or so, but they had more expensive/fancy entrees if that's what you're into. The service was also super friendly and fast. We waited the perfect amount for our food--not too short (where you feel rushed and wonder if they even cooked your food) but not too long. Our waiter Chun was great. I'd definitely love to go here again, especially because I always get cravings for Thai food. It's good to know next time I get a craving in Vegas."

We had pad thai, some sort go orange chicken, tilapia, fried rice, etc, but the two that stood out to me were the crab cake/pancake (my little brother is annoyingly picky, but he loved this dish) and the seafood curry (nice spices, and it was different from everything else I've tasted). \n\nI also ordered one of their specialty drinks, the Berry Botanical, which was a green tea infused gin with whole blueberries. It was really refreshing, and they were not stingy with the alcohol, which I appreciate. \n\nThe ambience is what you would expect of Vegas, trendy, clean and modern with dim, mood lighting.

We had a late dinner so we didn't really have a difficult time getting a space for a party of 5. We ordered  Tom Yum for a starter.  The waiter managed to brought in the soup, 5 bowls & 5 spoons on our table in one shot. Almost perfect! except he didn't bring a ladle. He turned away but I  called his attention just in time before he disappear from my eye sight, I asked for a ladle, he replied and said \" Sorry, there's no ladle in the kitchen.!\" Seriously?? We were shocked by what he said, how does he expect us to scoop the soup with? this is just a common sense! Oh well, we decided not to ruin our night just because of that so we just started scooping it with our soup spoon. hmm... Nice Resto inside a 5 star hotel and yet couldn't afford a laddle.. After few minutes, the same waiter came back with a ladle but we were half way done scooping the soup! He probably realized how stupid his excuse was! The main entree came next..the food is mediocre but i will have to give 5 stars on the Thai Crab Omelette, i really enjoyed this one. We also had this Garlic and Lime Steamed cod. It's looks so good! but the taste was a total opposite. We actually  returned and cancelled this menu because the fish was either not fresh or not cooked well...

I didn't order much (so my review is based on three dishes only), but what I ordered was enjoyable:  (1) Leek and Shrimp Dumplings - Less like a traditional dumpling (with a distinct flour wrapper you might associate with a potsticker), but still okay; (2) Turnip Cake - Very good, and I am a HUGE fan of turnip cakes; and (3) Ginger Scallion Tripe - Also very good, and I am also a HUGE fan of tripe."

It is quite tasty and comfort especially after a late night drinking!\nWe were glad to have a great meal at this late beside pizza!\n\nWe were skeptical at first because of some bad reviews on yelp... but we're surprised about this place.

Send me to the epicenter of hookers, blow and blowing hookers and I instantly crave it like clockwork (the dim sum, not the prostitutes/drugs); it always hits right around 10:44am on the 1st morning waking up in Vegas. Pft, like I'm gonna leave the Strip to go get sum dim sum...no. NO! YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GET IN THE CAR! No-oh...there's a place in ARIA?! Okie =)\n\nChinese-Thai fusion -- to my stomach that translates to: dim sum and satay. Asian soul food and tropical shee-at. I feel only the slightest bit bad because LG has been deserving of four stars my previous two visits but with the last one, well, let's just say third time was NOT the charm. Hehehekekekejajajaja. Amirite? Yah, I am totes rite.\n\nAside from ordering your typical assortment of spherical balls of crap enveloped in cocoons of some sort of rice-based skin (as an Asian I feel pretty ashamed I don't even know what I'm talking about) such as har gow, pork bao, shao mai, turnip cake, etc. you can of course get Thai dishes. No lie, we've probably ordered 90% of the same thing each visit while sometimes changing it up and subbing out a dim sum plate for something else. Can I mention how cute the phrase daan taat is? Egg custard cups...they even look adorable. If I could personify this dish I'd want to squeeze its cheeks, slap it in the face then swiftly punt it into a wall because it's just too gosh darn ky00t. Daan taat in animal form is a maltese =)\n\nTo regain focus on the foodles...the beef satay disappointed us this time around. In fact, most of the dim sum disappointed too. Did it taste skanky like a used diaper laced with pencil shavings? Nah, it tasted decent like always but the temp...argh. Such a seemingly simple aspect when serving food but tough to execute correctly on a consistent basis. All the dishes were either a couple of degrees above being lukewarm or getting dangerously close to flat out cold...clearly not the optimal temp to serve dim sum or meat on a stick in a pineapple under the sea. It's almost as though the carts were circling the depths of hell for a few mins too long...and by hell, I mean Lemongrass. And by mins, I mean a maybe a half-hour or so. The worst was the satay -- the surface temp completely turned me off since I felt like I was basically licking a cold cow popsicle...ahhhhh!\n\nIt doesn't help that without fail, at least two people order the young coconut. 12 mothafluffin' dollars per...that's a 6 or 8 place bet in crapaud =( I mean, they're alright but I don't see what the big deal is with these stupid nuts. In particular on this last trip the examples we were served weren't ripe so it was tough to scrape the meat off and it wasn't exactly sweet flavored. Kinda slimy too, akin to squid...blech.\n\nStill, I won't let this deter me. Yes, you can bet your sweet fanny I'll be updating LG when I revisit in a few months. Plz to be turning the heat up a few degrees on your stoves and grils?"

I have not tried other Thai restaurants in the Las Vegas area yet. But, I enjoy Thai food and had many opportunities to have really great Thai cuisine. \n\nBoth dishes I had (chicken wing appetizer and drunken noodle entree) were recommendations from the restaurant to be among their \"best\". But, if you've tasted good Thai, you will agree that the flavors are comparatively bland and the texture is not ideal in some dishes. \n\nThe service wasn't well coordinated, but I prefer being checked on by several servers asking/offering the same items to me then to have no one check on me.\n\nI rounded up and gave Lemongrass 3 stars rather than 2.5, mostly because on a 5star rating, they barely made crossing over the halfway point. Honestly, 4 stars and above should be reserved for restaurants that are far better in class than their great competition, however, Lemongrass is not at that point yet - I hope they get there.\n\nUp shot: I did like the mango sticky rice dessert. I think the interior is very nice and most importantly, the staff are very kind. But save the sticky rice, it's not a location I'd bring guests to who love Thai food. For as attractive as the restaurant is, I wish they invested more in the food."

Our appetizers were the chicken and beef satay skewers and they were amazing. For my main meal, I had the Panang curry chicken. I asked for it to be as mild as possible. From a scale of 1 to 10, I asked for one. The meal was so good. It was not spicy which I loved, but it could have been made very spicy for someone who enjoys that. My friend ordered the shrimp pad Thai and asked that it be spicier. They honored that! The beauty of this restaurant is that I like Thai food a lot, but I am unable to tolerate very spicy food. This restaurant always successfully manages to create delicious meals that are either very mild or very spicy, depending on how one likes it. Dessert was a scoop of mango sorbet which was very nice on the palate.\nThe prices are reasonable, the restaurant is beautiful, the food is delicious, and the service is always friendly.

Classier and more than twice the price of what we'd get for something similar in LA, but the cuts of meat are nicer, the waitstaff is very pro and attentive, and the ingredients are top notch.\n\nHowever, the tom kha was EXTREMELY spicy.  Like, Thai spicy.  As in, we asked for medium (I've been to thailand twice and can handle some VERY spicy food) and we were served something we could barely eat.  It was vert tasty, so I downed it, but had to pay with a tummy ache later.  That said, most Thai places take the really spicy Thai peppers, split them with the side of a knife, and put them in for flavor.  Lemongrass seemed to have ground up the peppers iN the soup, which is kind of a no-no, as it was just WAY too hot, and killed the flavor, so we had runny noses and fire-burned tastebuds.\n\nThe Shanghai rice noodles, although not Thai, were delicious, and perfect, and beautiful form the tri-colored bell peppers.  VERY nice, good food (save the crazy spiciness of the soup), and kind of what you'd expect from an upscale casino restaurant.  Not cheap, but good, and it was the only place open for lunch at 3 o'clock."

The restaurant was dimly lit but was not romantic. It didn't even look Asian -- it could have just as easily served hamburgers and martini. \n\nFood:  we ordered Chilean sea bass as per yelp recommendation and it was delicious. A chunk of fish filet was panko breaded and deep fried, and served drenched with thick garlicky sweet and sour sauce, with sliced green onion heaped on top. The green onion strips seemed fried as they were crunchy but was not oily. Not sure how they did that.  Hubby did not like it and thought that green onion strips just tasted hard, but I liked the light crunch. I would definitely recommend this dish. \n\nWe also ordered Mongolian beef noodle soup, which had tendon and Bok Choy. The soup was just okay, improved much by a generous dollop of hot sauce, because hot sauce makes everything better. Beef was \"dark\" meat ( don't know the name of the cut but I accidentally bought it at a Korean grocery store before so am familiar with it). This cut has a lot of blood in the meat so it is dark in color and has a subtle metallic flavor from all the iron in the meat. Tendon was weirdly slimy -- I like my tendon firm but this was more slimy fatty type which is decidedly off-putting. Noodle was fresh. I ate all the Bok choy, some beef, some noodles, and all the broth so My craving was satisfied, but would not order the same dish again."

But we're fans of Thai food and figured: \"how bad can it be?\" \n\nWell, apparently it can be much worse than we thought. We started with the vegetarian spring rolls and the prawns (which our waiter assured us was \"the best appetizer on the menu\"). The spring rolls could have come from any cheap hole-in-the-wall Chinese place I've ever been to. I wish they had been better because they ended up being the only thing I ate for lunch. I'm told the prawns were okay, but if they were \"the best appetizer,\" my dining companion commented that the other options must be pretty scary.\n\nFor entrees we decided to try the pad Thai, chicken satay and some vegetable fried rice. I kid you not - the pad Thai tasted like dish water. The fried rice had no sauce, and was basically white rice with little squares of carrot and onion in it. The satay came with peanut sauce, and while I had never before met a peanut sauce I didn't like, this one was awful. It was bland, noticeably lacking in sweetness (which would have enhanced the otherwise-absent flavor), and quite honestly just not worth the calories.  \n\nWe had no complaints about the service or ambiance, but in a city filled with so many great restaurants this one definitely belongs at the bottom of the dining list."

The satay and Tom Yum Ghoong soup was excellent as were the satay. The chicken breast dish I had was breast meat that was over battered and the meat so dry I could not chew it or swallow it. My partshrimp entr\u00e9e was good, but not excellent. The mango sticky rice desert was good. The fried bananas were terrible. The menu and cooking seems to be dominated by Chinese influence. May be part of the reason it was lacking. Service was good through the entrees and then everyone disappeared. Had to grab someone from another section to get desert and the check at the same time. Really wish I could have had better things to say."

Service was just okay, they seemed unorganized.  Maybe cause they're fairly new, but employees seemed unsure of everything.  Got alot of blank looks when I asked a question.  \"Can I eat in the Bar?\" Blank stare.  \"Can I still order off the Early Dinner Menu on Weekends?\" Blank stare.  \"Wheres the bathroom?\" ..... Blank stare. \n\nSkip the early dinner, btw. Too pricey.  Just order off the regular menu.  Or go to Serranos.  That place is awesome.  Service and food are on point there."

This is the first Thai restaurant I've ever seen where people were offered and served champagne with their meal. Wine is horrid with spicy Thai food, but champagne is heaven. I'm glad the prices are high because it keeps out all the casino riff-raft and street sleaze that's all too common on the strip. We wanted to see if this restaurant could make decent traditional Thai food so we ordered some standards like tom yum goong; green curry; and white fish. The tom yum came with huge shrimpers although it lacked a good spicy kick. We requested our green curry be made with tofu and they did it. The green curry was very good, but again lacked a little kick. The white fish was great-very tasty and served with the traditional nam prik. All in all the food was very good, and very traditional. The wait staff were all Asian, but only a couple were Thai. Our waitress luckily was Thai so our family could speak Thai to her. My pet peave was piqued at this place because many of the farang patrons ate their Thai food with chop sticks. Thai people don't eat like Chinese. We use a fork and spoon for most things. We might use chop sticks if were eating a noodle soup. So put your chop sticks down when in a Thai restaurant and use a spoon and fork!!! We recommend this place. Good service. Good Thai food. If Vegas strip prices bother you, you may want to ask yourself what the hell are you doing on the strip to begin with????? You've gotta order champagne and satay. It goes great together."

Lemongrass has a relaxing vibe, both beautiful and modern inside - lots of dark woods, sleek booths, and eye-catching, large lantern lightings.\n\nWe ordered the Tom Yam Talay soup to start. Lemongrass ranks spiciness as mild, medium, hot, and very hot. We chose our soup to be medium/hot and it came out very spicy!! We love the heat but wow that soup was difficult to enjoy. Either way, the spicy, creamy broth was filled with all types of delicious seafood & had a great mix of lemongrass and ginger flavors. The abalone mushrooms were so tender and yummy too!\n\nWe were not too hungry so we decided to share the Singapore Noodles.  Wow, these servings are large! Surprisingly we weren't asked our desired spice level for this dish, and actually found it a bit bland. While we weren't particularly impressed with the noodles--it wasn't better or worse than your typical Thai hole-in-the-wall spot--the portion size is perfect for big eaters who want to dine at a fancier restaurant without breaking the bank.\n\nOverall Lemongrass ranks at 3.5 stars.

This place still is Strip-priced, (expect $16+ for fried rice or chow mein), but was decent for where we were.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice with dark booths and dim lighting. The service was friendly, but were not as attentive as I would have liked. \n\nI ordered the vegetarian pad see-ew, which comes with flat rice noodles, broccoli, egg, & tofu. Simple. It also had a green leaf next to it on the menu indicating one of the vegetarian options- which I loved and appreciated. Regardless, when I got my meal (& I was so ravenous I just dug in), my 1st bite was a mix of white tofu & white CHICKEN!!! UGH!!! Manners & impressing the boyfriend's parents pushed aside, I immediately spit up the contents in my napkin. I have been a vegetarian for 17 years now, that was absolutely disgusting & such an inappropriate mistake for a restaurant to make. Also, why on earth would the kitchen staff put in two proteins?! They clearly charge you double for adding extra protein, & this was one of the specially marked vegetarian entrees. Normally I inspect my meals just in case, but I was just so hungry & trusting... It took a long time to get someone's attention to make it right, & they had to remake my dish while I sat there hungry watching everyone else eat. We were also in a hurry that night as we had after dinner plans. When I finally got my new dish, it had no meat, but it was much drier than the original dish. It also did not taste Thai, or like pad see ew, it was like regular Chinese chow fun. Very disappointing. \n\nThe other people in our party ordered the basil beef fried rice, shrimp curry, beef chow fun, & chicken curry, & each enjoyed their meals. I would still recommend this place if you are craving Asian cuisine in Vegas, but beware, vegetarians!"

There was nothing great about it.  The wontons were good, but the overall soup tasted like it came out of a Top Ramen bag.  Totally disappointing.  One of my friends ordered the pepper shrimp which was good, but a bit on the salty side.  Their pineapple fried rice was good I do have to say.  \n\nMy advice is  save yourself some $$$ and dine somewhere else.  Personally, I like Archie's Thai Restaurant on Flamingo.  Food is great and affordable.  Or if you don't want to that, try YELPing a few places.  :)"

I'm sure that's not what it was called on the menu. This was a tiny portion of beef, utterly drowned in a peanut sauce that made my arteries harden just looking at it. \n\nDuck and gloop. I don't think it was called this either, but again, the tiny portion of duck was drowned in so much sauce. The dish was probably as many calories as a human should eat in a week. \n\nSesame chicken and gloop. This was a sweet and sour type sauce with a lot of sugar and gloop.\n\nIf you like your food \"smothered\" in sauce to the point where there is nothing but gobs of fat in your mouth, you'll probably love this place.\n\nSuch a beautiful restaurant, surely deserves better food."

            "review": "Although this place is listed as a Thai restaurant,  it is more Asian Fusion as they have a mix of Thai and Chinese food.  I ended up ordering the Tom Kha Chicken Soup and the Yellow Curry, both them were ordered at a 8 (out of 10) for a spice level.\n\nThe Tom Kha Chicken soup was pretty large and was enough to feed 2-3 people.  The flavors were wonderful and there was plenty of chicken pieces.  The only thing that was new to me was these funny looking mushrooms that they used,  they had a purple top, but their bottoms and stems were more of a white/beige color.  \n\nThe yellow curry was great as well, but there were a few pieces of potatoes that were undercooked.   The slickness of the dish was more on the mild side even tho I ordered it at a very hot level.  This dish was also large enough to share with a friend or two.\n\nI took off a couple of stars because the service was pretty bad.  When I walked in, they didn't have any tables available and so they offered to seat me at the bar.  I grabbed one of the smaller tables beside the bar, sat down and within a few minutes I had my menu.  Then it took about another 10-15 minutes before the waiter came by to take my order.  When I was finished with my meal,  they came by took away my dishes and asked if there was anything else,  I said no and they went away.  Expecting to receive my bill, I ended up waiting another 15 mins before they came back with my bill.  So dinner at a place like this should take about 30-40 mins,  it ended up taking over an hour.  And it was not that busy in the bar area, so I couldn't understand why the lack of attention.\n\nThis place is also pretty expensive, for my 2 dishes, a Thai iced tea, and a small plate of rice(yes it was extra) my meal came out to about $33."

Not worth the overpriced price we paid for for regular Thai food. We ordered the Tom Kha soup with Chicken. Beef skew with some sauce for starter. We had Green Curry and Pad Thai for entree. The Tom Kha was pretty good, and the portion was huge. They gave us a lot, it could serve four people. The Beef Skew or whatever it was called was good too with that sauce. The Green Curry and pad Thai was very ordinary. It couldn't beat regular Thai places around here. We took some to-go for late night snacking since we couldn't finished it but we left it at the roulette table!! Dang. \n\nIt was a good new experiment but definitely not a restaurant I would recommend if you're in Vegas. I would say go for lunch or late at night when everything is close.

For curries you have option on spiciness on scale of 1 to 10. Fantastic coconut ice cream dessert with mango, coconut, fruit jellies, sticky rice-- hit all the right notes in tastes and textures, and seemed light to boot. Staff is very friendly and efficient. Left extremely satisfied. Will return to Lemongrass every time I'm in Las Vegas!"

The flavor actually reminded me of how my mom and I cook our curry so I enjoyed it. The peppers in it were really spicy, too. I also ordered the prawn rolls for my appetizer but I didn't really care for it. I was expecting more flavor in it. The ambiance is feels pretty fancy in this restaurant. I'm not sure I would dine here again, but it was good to try at least once since it was close to our hotel."

Not only does the environment look and makes me feel good, the food is good! Also there's so many of these hidden little gems I'd have to come back to Vegas a few more times just to try them all! \n\nOn a crave for Asian food so we came here. My girls and I started off with sticky rice in those leaves and some dim sum. Of course a bit on the pricey side, but nonetheless GOOD food. We shared the Young Chow Fried Rice and the Mee Goreng.\n\nI like that their food isn't too salty. It captures the right taste and has such good flavor! Their food is made fresh and their presentation is decent. Yummy food here!"

One of the fancier Thai places I have been to. But I have had better Thai food at small mom and pop shops. We are staying at Aria and we needed an easy place to dine with a two year old. This seemed to be a better option than the cafe.  The service was fast and cordial. They left us alone, in a good way, for the most part. My water was constantly refilled. \n\nWe ordered the chicken satay. The chicken was moist but I have had better peanut sauce at many other places. So I would probably recommend something else. It didn't wow me but I still enjoyed eating it. Next we got the pad Thai with prawns and the soft shell crab salad. Both were tasty, lots of flavors. The salad had mint, onion, pepper and some other herbs and spices. The crab was good but a little salty for my taste. The pad Thai was pretty good. Not much to say about it though. \n\nAll in all it was decent food and casual but nice atmosphere. I would not travel out of my way to eat here and I wouldn't really recommend someone to go there either. But if you do find yourself at Aria and craving some fancier Thai food then go ahead and try it."

I was pretty happy that they were able to change the beef satay to shrimp with only mininal increases in price. I ordered the noodle entree and the portion was huge. The mango sorbet was a nice refreshing dessert at the end. \n\nThe only thing I did not like was the tom yum soup with mushroom. It was extremely spicey (even for someone very used to spicey food).

Maybe I've been spoiled from living in the Bay Area where there's great Asian food/ Chinese food and China Towns in Oakland and the city but I was not blown away. \n\nThe tastes were only mildly flavored.

It has the fish/crab sauce and has a strong smell, but it's delicious! A bit pricey compared to other Thai places, but the salad tasted better than most papaya salads that I've from these other places. It's not as spicy as other ones, but I actually like the level of spicyness here because I prefer to not have a runny nose while I'm eating it.\nMy boyfriend ordered the drunken noodles with seafood ($20). It had large pieces of shrimp and squid that were very flavorful. They give you enough to feed two people - I was helping him finish his. It's also quite spicy, so beware! I do enjoy eating spicy food, but wow... my tongue was burning after a few bites!\nMy friend had the sesame chicken ($17) with a small bowl of rice ($3). it was pretty good - I didn't detect any MSG in it, so that's good. The place is pretty big too - definitely enough for two people, and the chicken is still crispy, despite being coated in so much sauce.\n\nService was great - the food didn't take very long to cook, although there were hardly any customers since it was around 1:30am in the morning. Our waiters were quick in bringing out our drinks, and were nice enough box our unfinished entrees. They also refilled out waters frequently, considering how much we drank due to the spicy noodles.\n\nOverall, I really like this place. It's spacious inside, there's booth and regular seating (I like sitting in booths!), and the tables are spacious. They're also accommodating to larger parties, even late at night. If you're not craving Thai food in Vegas and looking for a cheap fill to satisfy your munchies, then this is not the place for you. They'll be seeing me again."

She didn't hesitate to bring me honey and lime to calm the spice. When that didn't help she got the cook to make me a level 1 pad Thai. A bit of warning: be prepared for hot dishes here!\n\nOverall the food was tasty. My husband enjoyed his drunken noodles but I couldn't taste it because he got spice level 7.\n\nNext time I definitely want to try the dim sum."

However no one in our party liked the food, we got the yellow curry so did our friends and we all thought that it was the most tasteless and bland curry we've ever had! It was as if they ran out of curry and added loads of water to it to make more of it, it was loaded with tasteless potatoes and bitter onions....such a big disappointment. We got chicken satay for appetizers and that one was pretty good although nothing special or unique. The service was subpar as our waiter wouldn't come to check on anything... We'd have to track him down to get water, our bill etc. so wouldn't recommend this place at all. I need to get some real Thai food from the family restaurant near my house to forget this unpleasant Thai food experience."

The outcome was surpassed expectations. The food is excellent and properly authentic Thai. Even the spice level is Thai spicy (from 1-10, 3 is a medium, 6/7 being SPICY).

It wasn't as greasy and the sweet chili sauce to go with it was really flavorful.\n\nFor a starter, I ordered the Tom Yam Hed soup and honestly it was an explosion of all kinds of flavors. I actually had to stop and kinda sit there wondering what the hell I was eating. I think I may have misread the ingredients because it wasn't something I enjoyed very much (the flavors were so overpowering). My brother had the Tom Kha Chicken soup and said he enjoyed it.\n\nFor my main course I had the Pad Thai with Chicken, and honestly I have had WAAAYYYY better Pad Thai here in Las Vegas from hole in the wall Thai places. I felt like it was bland and flavorless. I also asked for it to be super spicy (10/10), and honestly it wasn't spicy at all. I was actually really bummed because I figured a Thai place as upscale as this inside Aria would have some pretty banging Pad Thai...but oh well, I'm going to stick to eating my Thai food from my regular spots here in Vegas.\n\nThe rest of the family ordered different curries and they said it was ok. Oh and none of the dishes come with rice so you would have to order the rice as a side. Kinda figured since its upscale and usually upscale tends to be only A la Carte.\n\nOverall, this place was ok. It wasn't anything special and nothing really stuck out to me. Our total bill for 5 people came out to about $170 so the price wasn't too bad. The service was great with a very knowledgable and kind staff.\n\nSo will I come back? Maybe...I'll give it another shot some other time if I happen to crave Thai and am inside the Aria."

I came in to Lemongrass because I had a 7:00 show to Zarkana and we needed a quick fix before we went in. \n\nI really like the decor of the small but intimate restaurant. Very cute design. However, if you end up being seated at the booth, those booth chairs are SUPER uncomfortable to sit at. The booths are shorter so it kind of forces you to sit up straight the entire time. I couldn't relax and rest my back onto it without sitting up straight. I guess that's good for my posture but man, imagine sitting up straight for an entire dinner! Sure would have made my mom happy!!\n\nWe ordered a various kinds of food. Green curry, pad see ew, shrimp soup, and cashew chicken. All was good but nothing spectacular. For the prices you're paying, I'd say it's nothing that great you couldn't get at a smaller and cheaper Thai joint. \n\nLike I said, it was okay. I enjoyed my green curry but don't enjoy the price I'm paying for it. Would I come back? Depends.

It had a great assortment of mushrooms which is something I'm not used to in other Tom Yum that I have tasted. We also ordered Tainan Style Chicken which was served in a clay pot. The Chicken was great and very filling with an order of rice. \n\nWe were seated at the bar area which was nice and quiet.

You can put me in the column for liking it.\n\nStarted off with one of my favorite drinks, a Grey Goose dry martini, straight up. It was good, so I forced myself to drink another.\n\nOur waiter, Van, was pretty much on top of it. Friendly, knew the menu, made suggestions based on our menu questions.\nI started off with the Tom Yum soup, spice level #5. Now I love spicy food but following our waiters suggestion, I stuck my level in the middle of a 1 -10 scale. Glad I did because it was just right. I could have gone up 1 or 2 more, but why? This soup was tasty. I had the shrimp version and these shrimp were very fresh and clean tasting.\n\nWe had a few different plates and shared among us. I had some type of spicy seafood noodle dish whose name escapes me right now (Grey Goose martini's?) but it is the first dish on their entree list. My wife had a green chicken curry. We switched our dishes after a short while because she thought it was a little too spicy for her. It was not too spicy for me. \n\nNow I am somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to green curry. I make an excellent version myself. The version here at Lemongrass was better than average. My only dislike with it is that I just did not care for the pieces of potato in it, but the rest of the dish was just fine. I would order it myself.\n\nNo room for desert. It usually works out this way for me.\n\nI would give this place somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. However, our waiter was really good and that makes a difference so I will give four stars.\nIf you are staying at the Aria, it is a nice option for dining. Reasonably priced......................for Vegas!\n\nCheers to all"

            "review": "Being a frequenter of the Aria resort, I've eaten at Lemongrass many times...always having a great experience. \n\nDishes I've had most recently:\n\nPad Thai:  excellent!  I've had pad Thai at a lot of places and Lemongrass ranks among the best. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a lot of large perfectly cooked shrimp with my seafood pad Thai. I was kind of expecting overpriced and few shrimp given that restaurants on the strip can get away with this sort of thing. Nope. Well done, Lemongrass. \n\nDrunken Noodles:   Very very good. Not sure what to say about the drunken noodles, exactly. Nothing stood out as being specifically good. Just that the dish was overall very very good. I mean, they're drunken noodles. They're delicious!  I don't think I've had bad drunken noodles before, but I can't see how Lemongrass can improve on their version. It was tip top. \n\nYoung Chow Fried Rice:  delicious!  My only qualm is that it is inconsistent.  They've served me the dish already mixed together and looking very fried ricey (is that a word?) but the last time I went they served the fried rice separate from the primary ingredients and had me pour the soupy-like mixture over the fried rice. I like it the first way better.\n\nPork Dumplings:  A somewhat small portion for $10, but some of the best I've ever had. Was pretty pissed a couple of times when they gave me very little dipping sauce in my to-go order. But not the end of the world. \n\nThe inconsistency in the young chow dish and the amount of sauce given for the dumplings makes me want to give the restaurant 4-stars. No cheap and inconsistent restaurant should receive 5-stars imo, but the food IS top notch and they didn't skimp on the shrimp (hey that rhymes). I mean, be cheap and give me less sauce, shame on you. But you did surprise me with more of an expensive seafood product.  I'll be kind. 4.5-stars rounded up.  I can use my casino comp points to pay too. Weeeee!"

Understandable. \n\nYou might wander into the Aria and find yourself sitting down at a very zen-like restaurant, ordering a pad see ew and finding yourself completely dissatisfied - no spice, minimal flavor, overly inflated prices (they had pho on the menu - for a whopping $15. I've never paid more than $5 - or let's be generous and say $7 - for pho...). Regrettable.\n\nUnlike many things in Vegas, where extravagance and decadence make things oh-so-much more fun, Thai food is probably better served in hole-in-the-wall, marketed-via-word-of-mouth locations - avoid Lemongrass. For authentic, worthwhile Thai food I'm thinking you'll have better luck off the Strip."

Not something that you couldn't get at your neighborhood Thai restaurant for much cheaper. Don't get me wrong though, price is not a big deal but I believe in getting what you pay for. The food was a bit overpriced but then again, what do you expect, it's Las Vegas! I ordered the Lobster Tom Kha, it was tasty. The only thing that bothered me was usually restaurants take out the inedible parts of the soup such as the lemongrass and galanga but I found myself having to spit them out while I was trying to eat my meal. My boyfriend ordered a fried noodle dish which was tasty, except it was a bit dry. \n\nThe decor was really nice but the hotel itself is really nice! The service was good.

Often Thai places tend to overdo a lot of the flavors to appeal to people's expectations of what Thai food is \"supposed\" to be but this place gets it right and adds a definite touch of refinement to the dishes.\n\nI would recommend coming here if you don't mind the price 'cause if you're expecting normal Thai food portions you're going to be disappointed. I went here for lunch and I would recommend the same. Don't go here for a big dinner because you may be disappointed.\n\nI had: Rib Eye (good, small portion), Pad Thai, Coconut Soup (really good, I usually don't like it), Mint beef, Mango Sticky Rice desert (good), & a Thai tea (muted flavor compared to the usual really sweet versions; refined)\n\nAll-in-all I do wish more Thai places seasoned their food like this but I would have to pass on eating here again."

I asked for water and he asked for beer (one the was on tap but I can't remember). It took almost 10 minutes for our drink orders and we placed our order once the drinks were brought to the table out of fear of the waitress disappearing and not returning. \n\nThis restaurant is very versatile and can accommodate groups, children or date nights if the service is up to par. \n\nWe ordered the spicy prawns and spicy Asian cucumbers for our appetizer. My husband ordered sesame chicken for his entree and I had the pla lobster salad. \n\nThe appetizers arrived fairly quickly and to our surprise the prawns were actually flattened a bit so that they can be rounded and looked like a panko coated crab cake. The prawns while a little different were absolutely delicious as was the rest of he food and the portions were fairly large. \n\nThere was celery in the salad that I had ordered and I was picking it out as I am not a big fan of celery. The waitress asked if my food was okay and I told her that it was very good and my husband chimed in that I was picking out the celery because I don't really like it. \n\nThe waitress offered to take my salad back an remake it without the celery which was very nice but I told her that it was no problem and that I would eat the salad that I was served. She seemed a bit concerned that I may not enjoy my meal and asked if I was sure and when I assured her that it was okay she left. \n\nThe waitress came back to the table about 10 minutes later and asked if I was ok again and if I was enjoying my salad and once again I assured her that the salad was delicious. I did appreciate her concern. \n\nAs we were eating another waitress was pushing a cart containing dim sum thru the dinning room. The food on the cart looked and smelled delicious but we didn't order any because we knew were not going to able to eat all of the food we had ordered. \n\nThe prices are a little steep especially since or bill was over $50 for lunch but hell we were in Vegas!"

Being the only Asian at the table, I found my dish to be completely soaked in soy sauce and lacking in all other known Thai spices.

They used fresh mushrooms rather than dried mushrooms, which really brought out the smooth texture in the mushrooms.  The broth was the perfect level of spice and flavor.\n\nI also had the Jelly fish appetizer, which I would avoid.  There was a weird after taste that left a weird tough texture on my tongue.  Jellyfish should melt in my mouth and I would say mine was undercooked.\n\nOne con:  When we announced a birthday at the table, the waiter said he would bring out some dessert.

If I remember correctly, there were 4 skewers, but they were large skewers so you could have it all to yourself as a meal or share with others as an app. The chicken were tender and wasn't burned, but grilled to perfection. The sauce was good and there was bread, but I didn't care much for that. \n\nCrispy marinated squid: Hated it. Squid was coated with too much flour and there was absolutely no flavor. Very bland, wouldn't call it marinated at all, and hardly crispy at all.\n\nYellow Chicken curry: Very meh. There wasn't a lot of chicken and the curry was a bit thicker than I expected for a Thai curry. I'm fairly sure there was more potato than chicken.\n\nThai iced tea: It was ok, but expensive ($4.50!?)\n\nService:\n\nIt was ok for the most part. Waiter came quickly enough and our food arrived in a relatively timed manner, but nothing special.\n\nPrice:\n\nBy Vegas standards, it's.... ok, but if I were paying this price elsewhere I would freak considering the quality to it. $3 for a bowl of rice?

I was expecting better quality because Lemongrass is a nice upscale restaurant in an upscale hotel. Not bad but not great. \n\nThe fried prawns on the other hand were really good. Good size and portion. The pad see ew noodles were good as well. Not a big fan of flat noodles but these were tasty\n\nI would definitely recommend Lemongrass to anyone looking for good Thai food. I will be heading back to try the other options they have."

However this was such a disappointment, that it will be some time before I feel the need to go try another restaurant at Aria.  Especially since this the second time dinning there and both places have been mediocre at best.\nI will take some of the responsibility though, for having a bad experience, because we we're in a rush to get something to eat before Viva Elvis.  I had quickly searched before we left the house just to get an idea of what type of restaurants there was to choose from.  Being that me and my fianc\u00e9 visit Thailand at least once, every year, we really love Thai food.  Therefore, I was excited to try this place, eager to replace my last memory of the English pub that wasn't exactly delicious.  \nWe started off on a bad foot, I admit, by being in such a hurry and it only got worse from there.  I had to basically argue with the waitress on how spicy I wanted my food.  I know I'm a round eye, but what kind of scale goes from 1-10 with 2-3 being medium, huh?  We always order around a level 7 at all our neighborhood Thai places and it comes out perfect.  So after a few minutes of bantering back and forth with the waitress, I finally get to a level 5 on our papaya salad and curry.   \nWhen I ordered peppermint hot tea with the food, instead of earlier when she came for the drink order, the look I received spelled trouble.  They served green tea, instead of peppermint, and then it took quite awhile to finally wave someone down so I could get it fixed.  Then the food came out.....Ugh!\nThe papaya salad was seriously the worst I have ever had!  Not spicy at all and seemed to be missing an ingredient.  The curry was also very bland and thank goodness I decided we need some veggies at the last minute because they were really the only good thing we ordered.    The street vendors in Thailand could definitely teach these cooks a thing or two.  \nLike I said, I hate focusing on the negative, but save your money and go to a small neighborhood Thai place like Jasmine or Archie's, where the food will be authentic and the service friendly!"

            "review": "For a Thai restaurant, there seems to be a lot of Chinese items of the menu. Not a bad thing, since there are still Thai items. Lemongrass has the option to order from the main menu, order from a dim sum menu, or both.\n\nThe wait on Christmas day for my party of 4 was 10-15 minutes, which was not bad at all since it was packed. The decor around the restaurant is elegant and well placed with an Asian vibe. The booth where we were seated had a very large table (enough for probably 6-8). The condiments available were soy sauce (which was a little strong for my taste) and hot chili sauce. I liked the generic restaurant music that played in the background; it was captivating yet subtle.\n\nMy party ordered dim sum before ordering entrees. Each item on the dim sum menu ranged from 4.50 to 6.50, which is a little reasonable. The total is added to the final bill. The chicken feet (four per order) were very tender and flavorful. The sticky rice (2 servings per order) had good flavor and was nice and hot; inside was a slice of sausage, mushroom, and pork (I think it was pork). The scallop dumplings (I think five were served per order) were juicy and tasted just right like scallops are supposed to. We also had the Siu Mai (3 per order) which had a very tender meat filling, but lacked flavor. The steamed buns (3 per order) had a good flavor and the bun itself was cooked just right, but I have had better. Something that caught us off guard would have been that the carts that served the dim sum did not have normal rice. It was off guard for us because rice is the staple starch food in all of Asian cuisine, and to not have it while eating dim sum felt like something was missing (I know it's not an actual dim sum food, but having to wait for the rice to come with the entrees was a little disappointing).\n\nFrom the main menu, we ordered chicken chow fun ($16) and the tofu and pork (Forgot the name and actual price, but it was $15-20). The portions were big enough to give each person at the table one serving. We were also offered rice, which we then ordered one bowl of brown rice and one bowl of white rice. The chow fun did not have a lot of flavor at all. Even adding soy sauce and chili sauce to it did not bring out a lot of the flavor. The tofu and pork did not have much flavor either. As a matter of fact, there was more tofu than pork served to us.\n\nOne thing I do not like about this restaurant would be their silverware. I had the option to use chopsticks, but our serving utensils were silver that were awkwardly heavy at the bottom. Whenever I would want to rest the silverware on my plate, the heavy handle would force the end of the silverware to hit the table. This caused a few accidents moving plates around.\n\nOur service was OK. We were served drinks quickly and even got one round of refills. Unfortunately, whenever the waitress would stop by, she would quickly leave before I could ask for a refill. Even after we were done eating, I wondered where the waitress was to give us our check. Despite these shortcomings, our dishes were quickly cleared by the bussers, so we were not totally ignored. I was a little bummed out that we were not offered dessert.\n\nFor a restaurant in Aria, one would only have high expectations of their restaurants. The best part of my dining experience here was the dim sum, but I think with how much money we paid, the best part should have been our entrees from the main menu. I feel like I can go to Chinatown and order the same food and it would taste better than how it was made here and it would only cost a fraction of the price. Service, like I said, was OK, and I get that I went here on a holiday, but going to a place like Aria, one only expects something better than what everyone else has to offer. Lemongrass was not absolutely amazing, but left me with a little disappointment. I'm not coming back here."

It is located within Aria's casino level, near Blossom (Chinese restaurant).\n\nI tried the food during the Aria \"Play Days\" (essentially a dry run for selected employees and their guest), and honestly thinks that once the initial pre-opening butterflies are worked out, it will be a good restaurant.  \n\nI tried the Tom Yum Goong (prawn soup with lemongrass), and the portion is large enough for 2 to share, and it came out nice and hot, just the way a hot soup should be served.  The flavor is good, but not knock your socks off great.  The mushrooms and prawns are really fresh, and the prawns were not overcooked like at most restaurants.\n\nThe Chef's Signature Crab Fried Rice was also very good.  It was served piping hot and the rice is not greasy like at most restaurants.  It was one of the best fried rice I have ever tried (but Ding Tai Fung's fried rice is still tops in the fried rice category for me, but Taipei is just too far to travel for a fried rice fix).\n\nThe only disappointment for me was the dessert: Mango and Sticky Rice (Khao Niaow Ma Muang).  The mango was surprisingly good (considering that the ones we received for our operation is pretty bad in quality this time of year), but the sticky rice was undercooked and lacking in the traditional coconut milk flavor. This is a very easy recipe to master, so I was very surprised that it was not made at least as good as your typical Thai restaurants.\n\nAnyway, I took a few pictures of other dishes that others ordered, and those look good.  I can't wait to go back and try their other menu offerings once it is open to the public."

I was feeling particularly lazy and didn't want to drive off the Strip, so we decided to give Lemongrass a shot.  Unlike most of the dining options at the Aria resort, the Lemongrass won't cost you an arm and a leg, but expect to pay a premium over your typical Thai spot.\n\nThe restaurant is decorated in that simple modern look that is consistent with the Aria resort with subtle (or not so subtle) Asian cues.  The servers were friendly and quick to fill water glasses or bring extra napkins, but weren't able to really offer suggestions from the menu (possibly a language issue).  The service isn't over-the-top excellent but it's far better than what you get at most Asian restaurants.  \n\nFor our late night snack, we ordered fried rice and the prawn spring rolls.  The fried rice was good - nice chunks of meat.  The real winner was the prawn spring rolls.  Their interpretation of the dish was impressive and tasty, and it kind of made me wish that we were hungrier so that we could try another dish.  Yes, the prawn spring rolls were pretty good - light and crispy, not oily, and loaded with flavor.  \n\nIf you need a comparison: the Red 8 at the Wynn doesn't even compare in terms of food taste and service, despite the Wynn being a much better resort than Aria.\n\nI paid $40 for fried rice and prawn spring rolls after tax and tip - much more expensive than your typical Thai restaurant but not bad for something on The Strip.  Considering the dining options at the Aria, the Lemongrass is actually a decent place to eat - not too artificially upscale or pretentious."

I've returned to Lemongrass 6-7 times since, and the quality has seriously deteriorated.\n\nFirst, the lobster satay, which as been the staple of every order, has come out.... well... crappy. They come out piping hot on the outside, and cold (sometimes, even still slightly frozen) on the inside. There is NOTHING more annoying, disappointing, and downright crappy about biting into something you're looking forward to, and it comes out like a badly heated frozen dinner.\n\nTheir \"very popular\" crab curry..... tasted more like curried scrambled eggs than anything else, and their \"dan dan noodles\" were also absolute crap. Ugh.... HOW could you let things go consistently wrong for 2 months after 3 wonderful initial experiences????\n\nMy family also managed to get food poisoning when we went on Monday, a few days ago.

Wings were flavorless, and looked way better than they tasted. Eggrolls were not special either. We ordered a noodle dish and a soup. Soup was ordered with a spice level of 4 out of 10. We like spicy food a lot, but I swear the waitress requested a 14 out of 10!  Damn hot!!!  I don't plan on going back to Lemon Grass, primarily due to the service (or lack there of) we received from our old grumpy waitress. She was not happy to be there, never smiled once and just lacked the most basic courtesies expected from a waitress at any restaurant, let alone Vegas. Definitely nice decor, but not worth the price. The negative sour vibe from the serving staff and waitress was enough for me to not recommend."

Nice selection of house wines although we had been led to believe they served Cakebread wines, which they don't. But oh well. After a wait of about 30 minutes they offered us early seating in the bar. Hold out for the table lol. The seating in the bar is very comfortable and leans you back ALOT so isn't the easiest to eat from. The back cushion kept moving and that detracted from the whole dining experience.\nWe started with the pot stickers. The port could have used some salt and seasoning. It was very bland, given the chili vinegar soy sauce had no punch that was a disappointment.\nFor my entr\u00e9e I had Phad Thai Ghoong and it was delicious. A very large portion of noodles very well seasoned. I like it on the hot side and could have gone hotter than the 5 I asked for. But every place rates differently so its a learning process. There were four good sized shrimp in my entr\u00e9e and the peanuts were on the side for me to add. All in all it was a good dish.\nThe atmosphere is bright and interesting, a little noisy for hanging out and talking. More of a go and be seen place but still was fun.\nWill I go again? Not until I try all the Thai places Vegas has socked away. It was good but didn't take my breath away. Nice if you are on the strip and don't want to wander to far."

Particularly recommend the red curry with duck breast and lychee, the crab fried rice, and the drunken noodle with seafood. Seafood central, but so delicious.\n\nThe selection of vegetarian options is scanty, and they don't really reduce the price if you want to sub veggies for the protein.\n\nThe mango and sticky rice is spot on! Temperatures were perfect, the mango was ripe and sweet.\n\nAs far as the service, things were fine at the beginning of the meal, then really started to slow down about halfway through. Then they just straight up screeched to a halt. After we finished eating, we waited over half an hour to get the waiter's attention to request our check.

I guess it's because that is a family gathering day.  That's my supposition.  Nonetheless, they make the dim sum small plates, such as the pork ribs and tripe pretty good here.  They have chicken feet too!  Made well here as well.  Try it out!  There's no harm - you're in Vegas anyways!\n\nThe waitress who assisted us, was great.  She came by our table a lot of times and offered us dim sum too - especially when we didn't even know that they served that up!\n\nTheir broth and noodles are actually made well here.  You can tell because the rice noodles in the beef pho, for example, does not get soggy, but still noodle sturdy when it has been in the broth after awhile.  \n\nTheir chicken wings are crisp and moist on the inside - well cooked all by itself!  \n\nAs for their Thai dish, such as their Pad Seew Ew, it was flavorful, but lacked the ultimate umph and jalape\u00f1o marinated in vinegar zest to it.  \n\nKeep this in mind - this place is the remedy if you are craving pho or for fulfilling some good Asian food in you and you are limited within the confines of the Strip!"

It was conveniently located in the Aria hotel where we were staying so we decided to give it a try since we love Thai food. The place inside is ultra sheek and modern with a contemporary flare. It's very nicely decorated with nice tables and furnishings all around. This place was delicious overall, we ordered the veggie egg rolls which were very fresh and the chicken pad thai. It's on the pricey side at $18 but you get what you pay for, the quality of the ingredients was superb, everything tasted super fresh. The only thing I didn't love is that our server asked us how spicy we want it on a scale of 1-10 but I didn't think pad thai came spicy at all? We figured we'd give it a kick and told him 5, but we really should have said 2 because our lips were on fire, but in a good way, so I can't truly complain. Next time I would just get it on the mild side. Our friends had the pho and a thai curry dish which they seemed to really enjoy. \n\nAnother plus is how fast the food came out which was perfect since we had to catch a cab to the airport and we were in and out within 45 minutes and we took our time eating. However, the place was pretty empty around 2pm on a Monday afternoon so no reservations are needed. If I stay at the Aria again, I will definitely come back. Plus, I read that the executive chef is from Bangkok which shows you that the food will be good and it was."

We had a craving for Thai food, and this was probably the best Thai food we have ever had.  We started with the Prawn Rolls and they were to DIE FOR. The crispy squid was pretty good too. Yummmy.  \n\nFor our mains we had the yellow curry and the basil beef.  The basil beef was made too spicy for me as there was a misunderstanding on how spicy I wanted it.  However, when I informed the server, he handled the mistake with class and immediately got me another freshly made dish and apologized.  It's okay for restaurants to make mistakes and how I really judge them is on how they react to the problem.  THe problem with my dish was handled extremely well and I commend them for their great service to ensure I was happy.  \n\nOur bill came to less than $100 for two of us and we were stuffed!  Pretty good for some really good food in a swanky hotel.  Highly recommend!! We will be back on our next trip to Vegas"

The only places that were still open at the Aria was Lemongrass and their 24 hour cafe. Without much deliberation, we came here hungry but also not expecting much. \n\nWe ordered the red curry with duck and vegetables and wow, it was a huge portion of duck, pineapple, green eggplant (fairly certain it was eggplant lol), red and green peppers, bamboo shoots, and cherry tomatoes. I was quite impressed by the sweetness of the curry with the tastiness of the overall dish. The jellyfish appetizer that I was happy to see on the menu wasn't good though as it was very rubbery. I've eaten a lot of jellyfish and this was something that definitely looked like it but wasn't quite there. I even tried adding chili sauce to mask the rubberness but that didn't work haha\n\nNow I know the reviews overall haven't been great here but there are positives: A. open till 2 am /// B. restaurant decor is nice /// C. food looks authentic\n\nHonestly, I would normally never choose a place like this to have a dinner when I usually only get 2-3 nights per visit in Vegas and there's TOO many restaurants to choose from. The thing was that all the places I had on my list to try were already closed and we were staying at the Aria and this was open. I'm not sure about the rest of the menu but the red duck curry made for a satisfying meal that won't leave you feeling stuffed to enjoy the rest of the night."

I can't imagine enjoying curry without rice so I shelled out the extra $3 bringing my curry dish to $21.  Dinner for 4 (without alcoholic beverages) was $120.  We each ordered 1 entree and split an appetizer for the table.  You can drive 10 minutes in any direction off the strip and get food that is 10 times better for literally 1/3 of the price.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is ok. It is located in a quiet corner off the casino floor next to the high limit area. There is not a lot of people watching but t is a perfect spot if you want a quiet dinner or lunch.\n\nThe staff is ehh. No one is over friendly but they aren't rude either.

I have been coming to vegas frequently over the years and have tried most of the top restaurants in las vegas.  What I have come to discover is that most of the restaurants in the newer hotels, especially the ones that serve asian fare, are decent, but incredibly over priced.  That was not the case with Lemongrass.  I found them to have a wide range of food that was absolutely delicious.  The decor and ambiance were impressive and the service was excellent.  A great way to enjoy a delicious and fun meal with a group of friends.  Would recommend it to anybody."

It was a great decision and I highly recommend giving it a try.\n\nI stuck to my usual order of chicken phad see ew. Oddly, the menu only lists three meat/veggie options for each dish and the phad see ew only offered a choice of pork, seafood or veggie. For comparison's sake, the phad thai listed chicken, shrimp and veggie. I decided to take a chance and inquire about substituting chicken instead and they easily made the change with no questions. I'm not sure why the menu only lists certain protein options for each dish but I was pleased to see that they're not strict on that. \n\nMy phad see ew was absolutely delicious. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say it's one of the best that I've ever eaten, which is a good thing as it's also probably the most expensive at $18. While it was a little hard to justify spending nearly twice as much on the same dish, the quality of the food and the ambiance of the restaurant made it worthwhile. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the home style tofu with rice at a spice level of ten. Our waiter warned him that it's extremely spicy but my boyfriend grew up eating New Mexican green chiles and always asks for high spice levels at Thai and Indian restaurants. He's usually disappointed that they fail to reach his desired spice level but the spiciness here is no joke. He was pleased that they actually lived up  to their warning. \n\nI also decided to splurge on a Thai iced tea and it, too, was very good and gave me the caffeine burst I needed to make it through the rest of our final day in Vegas.\n\nThe restaurant is beautifully decorated and would make a great date night spot with the dim lighting and quiet setting."

We just wanted some Thai food and figured Lemongrass can't be that bad!\n\nAfter looking through the menu, you can tell that Lemongrass isn't a true authentic Thai restaurant.  There's more of a... Thai Chinese fusion going on here.  Still, we were pretty damn excited since all we had for the last few meals were fast food!\n\n+ Tom Kha Chicken - chicken, coconut, lemongrass, galangal.  Solid tom kha.  Not the best I've had but it's solid.  We had 4 and the portion is good for a bowl of soup each! $8\n+ Panang Duck - coconut red curry, duck, ground peanut, lychee.  My favorite out of all the ones we tried!  I think the duck is fried so it had this crunchy skin and it is very good with the red curry.  No bones!  VERY small portion though, and the curry is more of a paste.  Lychee sits on the side. $20\n+ Drunken Noodle - spicy rice noodle, prawn, scallop, squid, Thai basil.  Good to share.  Lots of fresh seafood.  We were actually surprised by the amount of seafood! $20\n+ Three Cups Chicken - bone-in chicken, ginger, basil, sesame oil, Shaoshing wine.  Yes yes, I know this is not Thai, but we did want something Taiwanese for whatever reason so decided to go for it.  Biggest disappointment out of all.  The chicken is fried then stewed in the pot with the ingredients, but the flavors of the garlic and ginger didn't really penetrate through.  Maybe I'm just a little picky since I love this dish normally :P $16\n\nThe Thai dishes we ordered were all pretty solid so definitely going that route next time.  We knew it was gonna be expensive and it sorta is.  $20 for the noodles and curry, $16 for the chicken, and $8 for the soup.  We also ordered jasmine rice & brown rice to go with our meal and each portion was $3.\n\nWe didn't try any of the alcoholic drinks since we were still sorta recovering from the night before.  Fountain drinks are at $4.50.  Again, a little high but at least there is free refills!\n\nService was good and the decor/ambiance of the place was pretty nice."

Upon further inspection of the bad reviews and a meal during a typical day of the week at 5:30PM, the general consensus is unfortunately true. The service was horrid, the food came out incredibly slow, and they never checked up on us once after the meal was out. I ordered Phad Thai and my mother ordered Phad See Ew expecting authentic or at least tasteful Thai food. I was already in a good mood because of the atmosphere and a good Thai tea. However, you just can't ignore the lack of flavor of both traditional dishes. Both dishes tasted like flavorless jello. I tend to be generous with my opinion on restaurants, but this place just doesn't cut it especially considering the price. You'd be much happier going to the buffet."

Want greeted promptly, seated in the center of the room. To me the restaurant needed a little more lighting. We got the prawn satay, seafood drunken noodles, ribeye salad. The prawn satay was really good, it came with two slices of french bread and a curry dip. The skewers of prawns was held up with a piece of pineapple. The appetizer was good.\n\n Shortly after that the drunken noodles came out, it looked good. The flavor was bland, the seafood in it was good except for the squid, it was dry. The veggies was crunchy some of leafy parts was over done. I added in some soy and some siracha chili sauce to it. \n\nWe was also waiting on our ribeye salad, this was about 5 mins after they brought out our drunken noodles. You would think the salad would comeout first if not together with the noodles. The wife took the first bite of the ribeye. I asked her how is it, \"chewy\" she stated. I had a piece, it was chewy. It seemed like they had cut a piece of tissue with it because there was a only couple pieces that was chewy. The salad did have good flavor tho.\n\nNow onto waiting and waiting for the server to get us our check. Seemed like forever, I also saw a customer walk up to one of the servers and said \"we need service, we've been sitting for over 10 mins and no one had came over. 5 mins passed I got my check, signed. As I was leaving that table seemed to have not been helped yet. \n\nI give three stars as I had better thai food/experience o in a smaller town, in the US of course."

I ordered prawn satay which had a delicious peanut sauce and duck panag curry. We ordered our food medium spicy and it was spicy but not overly so. The duck was perfectly tender mixed well with all the flavors in the dish. The portions were very large so I recommend sharing an entree if you aren't too hungry."

It is beautifully fit for the very modern Aria.\n\nOur service was a bit weird. I understand it's difficult to accommodate large parties, but our service just seemed a bit whacky. A little \"all-over-the-place.\" In a rather empty restaurant, they told us it would take them 20 minutes to set up a table for 10. All I could think of was, why?\n\nAnyway, the food. The food was good and decently priced (especially for Vegas). Our pho was about $12 a bowl? Double what I pay out here in Oakland, but like I said... it's Vegas and it beats paying $70 for a small steak. My friend ordered the soft shell crab (I think) fried rice and it was DELICIOUS. Everyone at the table loved it. They also served dim sum, which was a nice surprise and comparable to Oakland dim sum. I NEVER said it was AS GOOD as Oakland's dim sum... but it exceeded our expectations.\n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant to those looking for an inexpensive bite and if they're at the Aria for any reason.\n\nOH! Avoid the pho though. It was extremely bland..."

The meat was not bad at all, but the noodles were short and clumped up, which may be due to a colder soup. The broth also had a different taste that I wasn't used to. It did not taste like it was cooked with beef, rather it had a cinnamon-y taste like it was from a soup packet. Overall, the beef pho was not to my liking.

Although it was a bit pricey for pad thai ($18), I understand, given the location.\n\nMy second experience was through the delivery service. Our group ordered multiple dishes to be delivered to our SkySuite. I decided upon the Duck Noodle Soup. Given I've had duck noodle soup multiple times before, and had a great experience at the restaurant the night prior, I was extremely excited for my meal! However, after taking the first bite, I realized that might not be the case. The soup was extremely salty. The noodles were very thin and undercooked. There was a good amount of duck, but considering the soup base and noodles were not good, the one good part was not enough to salvage the meal. My friends who got Pho said their meal was amazing, which is odd, considering Pho is not even thai food. I only consumed about 1/3 of my meal, before giving up. Another friend ordered the duck noodle soup and had the same thoughts as me. Definitely a disappointing experience."

Again we asked for a table for two, and she advised it would be about 20 minutes.  Fine, we'll wait.   We ended up waiting about 40 minutes, during which time, one or the other of the two came up and asked for my name on at least 3 separate  occasions.  Talk about a short memory.  We also saw several people walk up after us and then get seated while we waited. \n\nWhat was the deal?  Were we dressed too casually?  I'm NOT the type to dress in shorts and a t-shirt to an upscale restaurant just because it's Vegas.  We dressed up for Stripsteak the night before. But this was listed in the CASUAL restaurant category in Aria.  On all of  the hotel restaurant listings and on the Aria tv channel, they categorize the restaurants as either formal or casual, and this was casual.  And it's not like we were that casual.  I was wearing jeans and a polo type shirt.  My wife was dressed failry nicely as she always does.  \n\nAnyway, once we finally got through the attitude at the door and were seated, the service was actually very good.  The food was good, but nothing spectacular.  Being from Los Angeles, we're used to good Thai food, and at 1/3 to 1/2 of the price here.  If you live in a city where good Thai is hard to find, this might be a good spot to try, if you don't mind the attitude."

I've never tried jelly fish before but it was amazing, and the duck curry was just as good - the prices might seem a little up there but you definitely get what you pay for - not to mention the portions are of good size. They're cocktails are strong. You definitely will not be disappointed."

            "review": "Shocked no one has reviewed this yet? Or maybe i just couldn't find it but I searched really long and hard lol\n\nVENUE:\nCute little restaurant tucked in one the corners of the Aria Hotel. Atmosphere is intimate, with dim lighting (even at 10AM in the morning). D\u00e9cor is pretty modern with regular seating and bar area seating. We were sat in the bar area - tables were small but they had this small mini table pull out (very clever and smart) for additional space. Also the chairs were super comfy. Basically like mini couches (to me), which makes me wonder how wonderful the regular area seating is if they were reluctant to sit us near the bar. I'm really not sure if this place is supposed to be more chinese or thai as there are both kinds of dishes on the menu.\n\nFOOD/DRINK:\nDim sum is pretty standard so far. Got the har gow and siu Mai. As far as taste goes, a speaking as someone who has tasted Dim Sum from some solid areas (San Francisco, Houston, etc.), I would say that it was not phenomenal. Not bad, just not what I prefer. If I had to describe the taste in a sentence, it would be, \"Dim Sum for the average  American.\" Not to be offensive or anything, but my opinion is that you would like it if you haven't had better. All in all it was still pretty good, and my kudos goes out to the amount of shrimp they packed in each bite. That was one pleasant surprise that I enjoyed. \nOf course, anyone who has eaten dim sum understands that you will never get full from it, so in addition to this Chinese morning tapas, we ordered off the menu. One of my favorite and wisest foodies told me that if a Thai restaurant doesn't offer Lard Na on their menu then they're not really authentic. I decided to dare Lemongrass and asked my server if they would make Lard Na for me. Two surprises: the first being that she knew that the dish was, and the second was that she was super accommodating about wanting to get it made. She even knew that there are various way you can serve the dish (more gravy like or a soupy pho-style). She charged me for the price of the Pad see ew. When it arrived, the beef was nicely marinated and tender. The noodles were slightly bland, but I will forgive it as it was not an item they typically make and serve. I should have known better because the gravy sauce with Lard Na takes a long time to get right.\n\nSERVICE: \nOur hostess and server were extremely helpful.  As we were in the bar area, the bartender was also helpful and came to check up on us. At the end when we were paying, my card had gotten rejected, and he came back and made some remark (I'm sure he intended it to be comedic) about how I should have let my boyfriend pay. I was slightly miffed and after making sure there was nothing wrong with my account (as many of you wanderlusters know, the bank might think someone stole your card if you suddenly make a purchase on the other side of the country), I asked the bartender to swipe it again. It went through. To which, he commented, \"Yeah make sure there's funds in there.\" Really dude? I don't need your accounting advice."

Unfortunately Lemongrass didn't impress us any more than some of Aria's other offering have so far.\n\nI ordered an appetizer of satay chicken sticks and the wife had vegetable spring rolls. The rolls were OK but not amazing, my satay sticks were mediocre. They came well presented, but the satay sauce was a tad bland. I'm usually willing to overlook this because I know this is a property of Thai satay, with my own preference usually leaning strongly toward Malaysian or Indonesian satay which tends to be spicier and nuttier in my experience, however the chicken itself was bland and nearly tasteless beyond the outer glaze and clearly hadn't enjoyed the hours of marinade-bathing essential to imbue a stick with a good flavour.\n\nFor mains we ordered Pad Thai \"J\" (for the wife) and I ordered Chicken Mee Goreng. My wife rued the lack of a strong peanut taste in her pad thai which was overwhelmed with chunky vegetables. She felt the dish lacked finesse and looked like it had just been plopped down on the plate.  My Mee Goreng was bland and gluey. I would chalk this down to poor ordering on my part, with with the rest of the meal suffering similar issues I think it's more of a quality issue. I was surprised how tasteless my meal was, considering we were informed of the restaurant's 1 to 10 heat scale in which 2-3 means \"medium\" and decided to go for a \"4\" meaning a bit spicier than medium. What I got was a 1 by any scale I've used for measuring spiciness.\n\nWhile the restaurant looks nice here, the food simply isn't. For half the price you can enjoy far superior Thai fare at any number of establishments around the city. Even our generic fountain lemonades that we had to drink cost a staggering SIX DOLLARS each bringing the price of our meal up to around ninety dollars after tip for two appetizers, two noodle dishes and non-alcoholic beverages. For that sort of coin I expect my tastebuds to have their socks blown not only off, but then discovered in someone's backyard several states away a few days later. Lemongrass didn't impress me at all and I see no reason to return."

Plus, the food and service are top notch and I feel like the prices are very reasonable.\n\nThe restaurant is made to resemble a Thai Silk Factory - it's dimly lit and this might sound weird, but I love the lamps at each table. They specialize in Thai cuisine, but also have quite a few Chinese dishes as well.\n\nWhen I dined here, I had the yellow curry with chicken. At $16, the portion was HUGE and could definitely be shared. I was disappointed that they charged $3 extra for rice - this is something that usually comes standard with curry. However, for less than $20, I thought it was a great portion and REALLY tasty. I ordered it at a level 5 - their scale is from 1-10 and I was advised that 3 was medium. Although 5 was a bit spicier than I anticipated, I would probably go with at least a 6 next time (for that extra kick).\n\nOverall, it was a great experience - considering I was there just before close (at 1:45AM). The service was prompt and friendly and I was surprised at how busy it was at that time. If you are at Aria and looking for something a little different (this is the only Thai restaurant on the Strip I believe), definitely check out Lemongrass!"

Lemongrass is located in Aria and it is open for lunch (it was surprisingly busy for lunch despite its location; it is kind of located in the back of Aria, which I would assume would not get much foot traffic).  Lemongrass features an all-day menu consisting of satays, appetizers, salads, soups, entrees featuring all kinds of proteins (beef, chicken, lobster, prawns, pork, tofu, sea bass, and crab), curries, rice dishes, and noodle dishes.  Like a lot of Thai restaurants, Lemongrass features a big menu so maybe it should not be a surprise that some dishes are good while others underwhelm.\n\nI thought their chicken wings were very good.  They were not battered, but the outside was crispy while the inside was very juicy.  The chicken wings had a good flavor too--a fair amount of spiciness.  The chicken wings were served with a sweet dipping sauce.\n\nThe Pad Thai Ghoong also had a good amount of spiciness too and the spiciness was more than I would expect with pad thai so it was a nice surprise.  The pad thai also featured good noodles, a generous portion of prawns, crushed peanuts, and bean sprouts.  I did feel that the portion of noodles was a tad small.\n\nThe fried tofu with sauteed mushrooms, peppers, onions, scallions, and oyster sauce featured really good deep-fried tofu.  The tofu had a great and distinct edge while the inside was soft and very creamy.  Unfortunately, the sauce was very lukewarm in temperature.  Even if the dish had been served fresh and hot, it might have needed more heat or flavor.  In addition, with the tofu and the cooked vegetables, the dish felt too soft (there needed to be more crispiness or crunchiness).\n\nThe yellow curry with chicken, onion and potato was quite watery and bland.  I really liked the potato, but the chicken was shredded without care and overly dry.  It was disappointing given the quality and moistness of the chicken wings.\n\nThe beef satay was not that good.  The texture of the beef was a tad chewy.  The flavor was okay though.  The satay came with garnishes of peanut sauce, cucumber relish, and ciabatta bread.\n\nService was good--pleasant and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.\n\nThe restaurant has a mostly dark decor.  The room is comfortable.  And despite being very close to the casino, the restaurant feels very blocked off with walls and such to keep the smoke from wafting over to Lemongrass' dining room.\n\nPrices vary.  Appetizers are in the $10 and below range while several main dishes go for $16; there are several courses in the $25 range and portions vary with some dishes feeling generous with proteins and others feeling stingy with proteins or noodles.\n\nLemongrass probably has enough good things on the menu that you can have a good lunch or dinner here.  You need to do your research before coming here.  I thought the chicken wings and pad thai were both good, but the other dishes were mediocre.  I imagine there are other good things here and there are probably a few reasonably priced dishes as well.  If you know what to order and get the kitchen on a good day, Lemongrass can probably be a satisfying and not too expensive lunch or dinner on The Strip.\n\nLike other major hotels and casinos on The Strip, Aria offers free self and valet parking."

The restaurant was not busy at all, so the reservation I made proved pointless. The decor was nice, but I didn't expect anything else from an establishment inside the Aria. My friend and I were very thirsty and the best thing about the staff was that they kept our waters filled the entire time! That was huge for us, and brought us back to life at the end of a long weekend in Vegas. We got the Salmon Spring Rolls as an appetizer and I am very glad we did. These were excellent! I had the Singapore Noodle as a main dish and this was also very good and sized appropriately for the price. I was a little worried that it wouldn't be enough food given how hungry I was, but everything worked out fine. At the end, I paid under $40 for an appetizer and main dish along with generous tip. I thought this was pretty good for Vegas, and the food quality was above average. I would go back if I was in the Aria, but it is a bit out of the way if you are just strolling the Strip since the restaurant is tucked in the back of the Casino. The dessert options here were poor, but do yourself a favor and visit the Gelato spot just down the hall, Jean Phillippe Patisserie. $5 will satisfy your sweet tooth with a generous cup of your flavor choosing!"

Also, the beef was really tender and delicious, just wish the rest of the bowl was as good.\n\nThis place is pretty fancy too.  It's go a nice atmosphere, and the servers were very helpful.

The tom kha was pretty fantastic, but the curry was just meh.  I can't really put my finger on it, but it just didn't taste..authentic.  Our main gripe with the restaurant was the service.  It took FOREVER to go get our bill settled.  Our order was literally just the tom kha and panang.  To just ask for the bill, it took over 15 minutes. We put our card in the weird card holder boxes they had, and then....nothing.  At this point our waiter must've been kidnapped or roofied or something because he was nowhere to be seen.  Eventually, the boyfriend had to get up and walk directly to the check stand to drop off our card, just to get someone to process our payment info and get us the heck out of there.  From there, it took another 10 minutes for them to bring us our final receipt and return our card.  This was on a slow Tuesday night when there were maybe three other tables there.\n\n    The second time we ate here during our stay, we got our food to go.  This experience was much more positive.  The girl at the front who took our order was super helpful and friendly, and showed us how to charge the food to our MLife account.  This time we got the lobster satay and it was absolutely AMAZING.  The sauce was delicious and fresh, and the lobster was cooked perfectly.  We'd definitely return here just for that, but would probably get it to go just because of the dine-in service deficiencies.\n\nI'd recommend the tom kha and satay here, but I'd definitely advise others to budget the time for the uber slow service."

We had passed this place a couple of times while roaming around Aria so we decided to give it a try. \n   We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken. I ordered the Drunken Noodles with Seafood (spice level 4) and my compatriot ordered the Basil Meat with Shrimp (spice level 5) with jasmine rice. The food here is meant to share as medium sized plates are already on the table and they the meals/food ordered is brought in larger plates. I have never had drunken noodles before so I cannot compare it to other dishes I've had, but it was delicious. The noodles were the right thickness to absorb the delicious sauce and there was an ample amount of seafood (4 medium sized scallops, 4 shrimp, and 3 pieces of calamari). The basil meat with shrimp was fresh and had good flavor to it. We also ordered extra spice on the side so that we could control the spice level (can order level 1-10), but we did not add any additional spice to our meal beyond the level that we ordered. \n   I would definitely come back again to Lemongrass to try the other dishes on the menu as this visit was a delicious hit."

I ordered the sesame chicken and I thought I was going to get chicken with more ginger and garlic flavors, but instead I was served a huge plate of super sweet fried chicken.

I loved the food so much that I had to stop by one last time before leaving Vegas! I was with a large group so we all ordered a little bit of everything. Here are some of the dishes that stood out the most to me: \n\n1. Penang curry with duck- you would think the duck was the star in this dish...if you did you are wrong. The curry sauce was so delicious. I would eat all the sauce with plain rice and still walk out a happy customer. \n2. Tom yum w/ seafood- this soup is sweet, sour, and spicy. The ginger and lemongrass was not hidden and lost in the soup, all the flavors for a good yum yum soup was present. The best part is...there's HUGE shrimps and lots of squid and oyster mushrooms in the soup. The broth to meat/veggies ratio was good. I have been to other places that had too much broth and not much of anything in the soup. \n3. Papaya salad- tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. It's just a well made basic papaya salad. \n4. Sea bass- the portion was a little smaller than I expected but the fish was great. It was nice and fatty and not dry while the skin was super crispy. \n5. Beef salad- it was my first time trying a beef salad but I really liked it. Never would I think to add grapes to a beef salad with fish sauce and chilies but it worked. \n\nWe ordered a lot more food but these were the ones I enjoyed the most. My next visit to Vegas I will definitely be stopping by Lemongrass!"

But the restaurant was so beautiful and they refilled our water and tea frequently so I didn't mind spending more time enjoying my lunch.\n\nThe food was fantastic.  They offer a tasting menu regularly for $59 that was very similar to the $30.14 menu they offered during restaurant so I know we got a great value on the meal while donating to charity.  The starter was a chicken satay and cucumber salad.  The peanut sauce was very good.  Then they serve a small mushroom Tom Yum Hed.  The flavor in the soup was great and I would go back to eat just that.  Then for the main entree we choose to have the Phad Thai with Shrimp.  I loved the pad thai and the shrimp were a good size and fresh.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the dessert - an ice cream with sticky sweet rice, coconut, jackfruit and fruit jellies.  The coconut and jackfruit were very fresh and the ice cream tasted great with the rice."

Good to know for the future.\n\nPork satay skewers were delish. It was very juicy and I love the pickeled cucumbers they served it with. Gave the dish a nice freshness and the whole entire dish did have a good combination of sweet, sour, spicy, and savory.\n\nDefinitely would come back here to try other dishes."

The waiters/waitresses were very attentive - always refilled our waters and checked up on us constantly. The food however was rather disappointing. We already expected everything to be overpriced because that's just how it is. \n\nWe ordered something light before our flight back home. Chicken pad thai and dan dan noodles. I already had a feeling the dan dan noodles weren't going to taste very good because this restaurant was supposed to be a Thai restaurant. Dan dan noodles is Szechuan cuisine. Just looking at the dan dan noodles once they were placed on the table, I knew something was wrong. Where was the chili oil/flakes and minced pork? It looked more like peanut noodles to me. These were probably the worst dan dan noodles I've ever had.. it tasted nothing like it at all. The pad thai was pretty good. Not too strong of a flavor, but was very generous in its portions.\n\nThe flavors still however cannot justify the $18 per dish.. lol. Overpriced and unsatisfying."

We weren't looking for a romantic dinner, as after spending all day at her conference, the wife had to \"send a few emails, and quickly look at something for work\", which destroyed any chance of date night.  We weren't inspired by the Aria's in-room dining options, and know that Thai is often a decent choice to offer alternatives with her gluten allergy.  \n\nMake no mistake, we didn't expect a terribly authentic Thai experience.  The signs were a broad menu that included udon, sesame chicken, and pho, and the fact that their signature beverage is a Watermelon Caipiroska.  I'm not sure why their menu covers so much of Asia, as there are separate Chinese and Japanese dining alternatives at the Aria.  But, that's neither here nor there, as we were after the usually-GF Thai stuff.\n\nBecause the wife was going to be busy, we just were going to pick up and bring it back to the room.  We both went downstairs, in case there were questions my wife would need to answer.  The young lady working the hostess stand on a Sunday night was, honestly, more friendly than we expected.  She walked us through our allergen questions, quickly dispatched our order, and before we could comment very long on the what looked like young, fit, and well-dressed platform-heeled blonde twins going to the secure Tower Suite elevators with what looked like their very affectionate dad, she came out with our bag of goodies.\n\nWe just went with a straight up chicken \"Phad Thai\" (not used to that spelling).  I didn't find it overly spicy, nor did we ask for extra hot sauce to customize it with.  Even though it took a bit of time for us to get back to our room, the food wasn't \"stuck together\" like some report here.  I was expecting to be underwhelmed, and come back downstairs to grab a pizza slice or something for my dinner later, but the ($18) entree was plenty to feed us both.  \n\nSo, for the ability to handle my wife's gluten allergy without worry, the nice hostess who helped us, and conveniently and quickly feeding us both for about $20, we were pretty happy.\n\n3.9 stars"

Hadn't eaten dinner yet so I met up with another friend here because we were staying at the Aria and it was one of the decent sounding places still open that wasn't on the greasy side.\n\nVery dimly lit, the decor along the ceiling is like a weaving loom and really intriguing. Fairly quite atmosphere but can easily accommodate large groups.\n\nOur Order\nTom Kha Chicken: ($12) Chicken, coconut milk, lemongrass, galangal, abalone mushrooms\nChilean Sea Bass: ($28) Deep-fried sea bass fillet, shallots, scallions, Yu-Hoi sauce\nDrunken Noodle with Seafood: ($20) Spicy stir-fried flat rice noodles, prawns, scallops, squid, Thai basil, Kachai, bell peppers\nGinger Peach: ($14) Absolut Peach Vodka infused w/ Black Tea, Canton Ginger Liqueur, and Fresh Sour served tall over ice\nWatermelon Caipiroska: ($14) Grey Goose Vodka, Fresh Limes and Fresh Watermelon juice\n\nThe Tom Kha surprisingly had a strong mushroom flavor that overpowered the coconut. So instead of a more tart flavored soup, it was fairly earthy tasting which was interesting but we didn't love it. I love mushrooms too =/\n\nI ordered the Drunken Noodle w/ Seafood due to the reviews I saw on it. Honestly, it was greasy and tasted like chow mein. Nothing special and wouldn't order again.\n\nWhy I would come to Lemongrass? The Chilean Sea Bass. It was cooked perfectly: wasn't dry and very soft.\n\nThey drinks were good and very strong. They had better be at $14/drink! Even though they came out in small glasses, they pack a punch. My friend's a light-weight and drank a little more than half the cup and got tipsy. I nearly finished both drinks but my friend was too far out that we had to go back to the room.\n\nWouldn't go out of my way to come here since there are so many places to eat in Vegas but if I was in the same predicament, I certain wouldn't mind."

There were tons of staff walking around and there was even a manager looking person towards the back who failed to even make his way to the front or find someone to assist the ever building crowd.  Never ever have I experienced anything like this.  If the restaurant was busy and packed, I would understand.  However, the place had multiple empty tables.\n\nIf this level of service is any representation of the restaurant, I can't even imagine how atrocious the food must taste."

Like all of the Vegas restaurants, the interior is a sight to behold built with all sorts of rope, wood, as if the modern inteirior was built from found objects in a shipbuilding factory, which is of course impossible in the desert. Anywho, like all vegas restaurants, it is hidden in the back of the Casino but staff here was helping in tracking down the actual location.\n\nWe got the yellow curry, the portion size was good to satisfy 2 with normal appetites. The cucumber salad was probably not worth the price but it was tasty and a nice way to start the meal. Everything is very a la carte, and like most of Vegas, rather expensive. Thank goodness for company-sponsored travel :).\n\nService is attentive and you can bill to your room at any of the \"M life\" resorts."

The waiters also speak Chinese (Canto and Mando) so if you can't speak English then they can understand your orders in Chinese. I would recommend the Beef Pho, having it here is amazing and one of the best that I've ever had. The only negative I would have for this place is the price. Like all casino restaurants it can be quite expensive for usual simple dishes. But I guess the price comes with quality.

A customer dining in a restaurant inside a world-class hotel and casino like ARIA should not have anything less than an amazing experience. \n\nIt began when I called the restaurant reservation number to make a reservation. I had an important dinner meeting, and I wanted my guest to have an awesome experience. I made a reservation and got a confirmation number. When I arrived at the restaurant,  nobody could find my reservation. I called the reservation line, and after talking to a representative, she encouraged me to talk to the manager. So I requested a manager, but after waiting more than 10 minutes on hold, nobody came back on the line and I hung up. Thankfully, the restaurant was not busy, so they were able to seat us.\n\nWhen we sat down, I chose a bottle of wine and ordered it. I asked my guest to have the first taste. He tried to be enthusiastic. Then I realized that the bottle we received was a different year than what was on the menu. No wonder my guest struggled. I brought this up to the server, and she didn't think it was a big deal. I requested another bottle.\n\nThe meal was good. My desire is that the restaurant will make the experience better for its customers. Not plan on returning here unless things change."

The ambiance was great, the service top-notch, and the food was best of all!  \n\nI ordered what amounted to some bone-in chunks of chicken served in a large hot pot in a spicy thai sauce with fresh basil leaves mixed in.  The restaurant lets you pick the heat level, and as I like my food spicy, I selected a heat level of 8 (out of a choice of 1-10)  -- the food served matched my personal heat taste perfectly.  \n\nI found the prices moderately high for Thai food, but not for Vegas, nor for the service and swanky ambiance offered.  As far as portions go, the item I ordered came with *plenty* of food presented nicely, and I could not posibly have eaten any more... a *very* large portion in my book that probably could have fed two.  Service was absolutely top-notch.  The server always was on top of drink refills and knew the menu extremely well (warning me as I placed my order that my choice had bones still in the chunks of chicken, for example).  He even gave excellent advice on cocktail pairings with some liqours I have never heard of (that were great, by the way).  I am a hard customer to please, but I don't have a bad thing to say about the place and that is the highest compliment I can give.  Lemongrass may be the only Thai restaurant on the Strip, but when you have one *this* good, who needs another one?"

The restaurant is actually tastefully done with a central bar and plenty of tables. The food itself is nothing short of average, it isn't terrible but it is by no means terrific. The Satay is essentially the best thing on the menu and you have your choice of meat, I've had the lobster and the beef, both were pretty good. The Phad See Ew with pork wasn't anything to write home about and the overall portion/presentation is simply just average as well. I will say that the Thai ice tea is pretty tasty...

They were very small, tasteless and chewy. No heat whatsoever or flavor in this salad and it consisted of 98% celery. It should not be called a salad. Nothing salad about it. Someone should explain Salad to these people. \n\n3.

My friend could not eat her piece and left it on her plate. I ate mine but had to put chili paste on top to give it flavor. It was even missing salt. In fact the salad and the main entree did not have adequate seasoning, flavor or at the very least salt.\n\nI ordered a Spiced Rum drink with literally NO RUM in it. for $15.00 I would expect some rum in the drink but all I tasted was thai tea and coconut milk.\n\nSo $90 later we left hungry and pissed.\n\nI think the only reason this place gets any business is due to their location because their food is horrid and their drinks are light.\n\nTheir slogan at the top of the page: \"The only authentic Thai restaurant on The Strip\" makes me cringe. As a local they have some serious nerve to claim such nonsense. They seriously must appeal to people without tastebuds.

The service is okay, not too attentive and a little aloof but they were busy so it was understandable.

The portion were big enough for a leftovers the next day. \n\nPros: not too pricey (considering it's on the strip), good variety of food, great service, little to wait time, open till 2AM, clean, nice bathrooms, and good location in Aria.\n\nCons: food is not the greatest as the pad thai and shrimp was greasy. Plus drinks are very overpriced.\n\nOverall, a good place to go too if you're on a budget and craving Thai food. Just skip ordering cocktails."

The server was friendly and quick to take our order and all of our food came out in a sequenced order and in a timely manner. We ordered a seaweed salad and spicy Asian cucumber salad which came out first. Cold and refreshing they were - I absolutely loved the cucumber salad. It had a vinegary dressing and spice to give it a little kick.\n\nNext came out our chicken skewers from the Satay grill which we nibbled on for our appetizer. It came with a peanut dipping sauce that was tangy and delicious! \n\nFor our main course we ordered several dishes. Pad Thai (noodles), Pad Pak (veggies), and a few other unfamiliar chicken/veggie dishes. The food came out hot and tasty! The flavors were mild in the majority of the dishes but still very good.\n\nI still prefer the authentic Thai food you'd find in a mom and pop hole in the wall Thai restaurant. Lemongrass is a popular Thai restaurant on the strip that I would definitely recommend to tourists who want to dine at a hotel/casino."

            "review": "I agree with the person who would rate this restaurant 3.5.  The food is comparable to many Thai restaurants in Northern California but nearly twice the price for everything.  I tried the seafood chow fun which is Chinese, not Thai, and it was very tasty although a bit on the oily side. There were scallops, calamari and shrimp which were huge, but had a very funny aftertaste like they had been soaked in something.  That aftertaste turned me off so much I had to stop eating them.  The yellow curry with chicken, potatoes, onions and peppers had a nice kick.  We asked for medium heat and It was actually making us sweat. Nice that they didn't dumb it down for the Caucasians.  The pineapple rice was nice too, with huge shrimp.  There were a lot of raisins or maybe currents in nearly every bite which I didn't expect.  The pineapple tasted fresh and the dish was very good with bits of BBQ pork added in for flavor.  Rice was not included so an additional bowl of Jasmine rice for the curry was $3 - 4, which makes me upset..  Any curry that costs nearly $20 or more should include rice.  Shame on them.  The Thai Iced Tea was really good and freshly brewed (as opposed to package mix).  Not a bad meal despite the nickel and dime pricing and the odd non-Thai dishes all over their menu.  The service was very nice and the restaurant was a very creative design of thread, rope and other material that play with the light.  It was dark but sophisticated and I liked the way it was laid out.  If you're in the mood for Thai, or Asian in general, this isn't a bad option but perhaps not my favorite Asian food on the strip."

On the expensive side.\n\nBy the way, I would definitely recommend reservations if you are reading this. The concierge at Aria said they didn't take reservations...but they did, and we had to wait 45 mins. :(\n\nThe service was not very good first of all. My family tried to get a few bowls so we could share the dishes, but they didn't give it to us until we asked a million different waiters ( exaggerating, of course). We were wondering why the waiters were standing around chilling when we asked for bowls...?!\n\nAnyways, we ordered Tom Yum Goong, and Tom Yum Tay ( or something like that) and they basically tasted the same. Tom Yum Goong was a little bit sweeter though. You can choose what spiciness level you want. \n\nWe also ordered soft shell crab fried rice, satay chicken, and creamy red curry with prawns (I forget the name in Thai).\n\nFried rice - I thought it was good, just a bit bland. My family thought it was nothing special. Comes with fried crab pieces on the side.\n\nSatay chicken - the chicken was good, but the peanut sauce wasn't. The bread was good though.\n\nCurry - I thought this was probably the best part of the meal. Delicious. Creamy. It was small, and came with only a  few (maybe a bit more) prawns.\n\nThe restaurant was very high class ( in Aria ) and a bit formal dress is probably good ( not necessary, though )\n\nHope you enjoy this review and it was helpful!!

When we sat down, there was no waiter to be found anywhere near by. I kept having to turn my head back and forth just so I can wave one down. I had to walk to the hostess stand to ask for some menu's to look at. By the time the waiter came, we were ready to order. \n\nI ordered the thai tea as my beverage. It took almost 10 minutes to come out. The thai tea wasn't sweet enough. I've had better. \n\nMy boyfriend & I shared the jellyfish and the Lemongrass prawns as the appetizers. I don't recommend the jellyfish. It was too largely cut that it was so hard to chew. I wish it was thinly sliced. So the \"Lemongrass prawns\" came out. And it looks like a fishcake or something. So I asked the waiter what it was and he said fish cake. I told him we didn't order that and that was ordered prawns. So he added that in as well. Then the \"prawns\" came out and it was an eggroll prawn. There was 3 different waiters at this table and they were all saying different things. Finally we verified that it was the Lemongrass prawn and just turn into a mousse. The Lemongrass Prawns was actually pretty decent. It was just a hassle to figure out what everything was. \n\nAs our entree we ordered the drunken noodles with seafood. It was okay. The portion was kind of small. There wasn't enough flat noodles. It was about $20 for this dish. \n\nI thought this restaurant was pretty pricey for an \"Asian\" restaurant. And it wasn't even satisfying."

The restaurant's location is ideal, tucked away from the main casino located adjacent to the high limit baccarat casino, Club Prive (high end gaming), the Sky Suites lobby, and Blossom (chinese restaurant). The decor of the restaurant is decidedly modern, with warm earth tones and decorative pipes serving as walls. \n\nI found the food to be (not to my surprise) very americanized with the exception of the duck and yellow curry, which my party decided to order spicy. The menu allows you to pick your spicy-ness on a scale of 1-10. Because of this, I believe that the higher you go on the hot scale, the more Thai the food will taste. The pineapple fried rice and drunken noodle were bland, and were served in extremely small portions. The orange chicken however was probably the best orange chicken I have ever eaten as the chicken meat was still juicy on the inside. \n\nAll in all, I would recommend Lemongrass as a good place to eat Thai food if you care more about overall ambiance than authenticity of the food. Its location next to the Sky Suites lobby makes it convenient if you are staying on that side of Aria. As another added bonus, the restaurant is open for lunch at 11 am and is open late till 2 am so if your craving Thai food to cure your hangover, Lemongrass is the place to go."

The pho was well, but other than fried rice and pho, the food was just eh....the prices you know..its Vegas...as the flight attendant said...lost wages."

(Today is Sunday, so I am not sure if dim sum is available on just Sundays, on both Saturday and Sunday, or every day).\n\nThe staff is very attentive and friendly.  The suggestions our waitress recommended were on point.  Well, except for the papaya salad, which lacked the kick that most papaya salads have.  Barely tasted the fish sauce or lime in it.   \n\nLoved the sea bass, the marinated fried squid.  If you're in the Aria and you're craving Asian / Thai'ish (yes, I said \"ish\") food, Lemongrass is definitely worth checking out.  Pricing is also reasonable.  My party of 3 ate 4 selections of dim sum, sea bass, marinated fried squid, papaya salad, brown rice, and we also drank 2 Thai teas and 1 fresh-cocunut juice for a total of $103 pre-tip.  More importantly, we were FULL AND SATISFIED.  Worth coming back to try out more of what their menu offers."

Talk about DEALIO for vegas standards/prices.\n\nI'd highly recommend this restaurant for foodies on a budget since although Vegas has a tremendous set of fancy, amazing restaurants to offer, it's not within most people's price range (plus, it is extremely hard to book reservations for the places that are to die for like Robuchon!) so run towards the middle and go to Lemongrass. They strangely have dim sum at lunch hours...but besides that, they offer comfort food for $20 or less. Satisfying and delicious. The restaurant is beautiful too. If I stay at the Aria again I would def venture over here again and again!"

She was staying at the Aria and we decided on going to Lemongrass for dinner.\n\nThere was no wait at 7:45/8:00PM on a Saturday night which was great!  I would categorize Lemongrass as an Asian Fusion restaurant.  They make a bunch of different Asian dishes.  The food is good but not great.\n\nWe ordered a TON of food:\n\nFried Prawns\nJellyfish\nSpicy Cucumbers\nChicken Wings\nVegetable Fried Rice\nThree Cups Chicken\nBeef Pho\nPork and Pickled Vegetable Noodle Soup (Xue Cai Rou Shi Mian)\nSpicy Beef Noodle Soup (Nu Rou Mian)\n\nThe Fried Prawns were YUMMY.  The prawns are huge, and the dipping sauce compliments the flavors so perfectly.\n\nI quite enjoy jellyfish, but this one tasted a little too water-y.  They must've washed the jellyfish and possibly soaked it in tap water, because there was an overwhelming tap water flavor when I bit into the jellyfish.\n\nThe Spicy Cucumbers were seasoned with the right mixture of vinegar, sugar and spice.  It actually tasted really similar to the appetizer you'd get from a legit Chinese restaurant.\n\nI got the Beef Pho and was a little underwhelmed.  I felt like I got more beef, tripe, flank, and whatever else they put in my soup than noodles.  And because the beef, tripe, flank etc. looked weird, I had a difficult time wanting to eat it.  I ended up having a big pile of that stuff on my side plate.\n\nThe server seemed to be in love with one of the girls and would be SO chipper and smiley with her.  Anything she needed, he'd get for her.  I believe his name is Van.\n\nThis was a pleasant dinner, and somewhat affordable.  I think I'd rather try some of the other restaurants at Aria, perhaps the buffet, next time."

I ordered a level 7, which was at the time I mistake.  But the curry was so good that I kept eating it, mouth burning, and a Sapporo to wash it down, that by the time I realized I was too full to eat anymore, I couldn't stop shoveling it in my mouth!\n\nYes.

Chicken satay and prawn roll were included in the fixed price, they were good, nothing amazing. Main dishes were basil beef, chicken pad thai and something else... can't remember. The best part of the basil beef was the giant onion ring it was served in, kind of like a bowl.Desert was good as well, but don't remember what it was besides being in warm coconut milk.  \n\nOverall I was left with a ... meh.... impression. Very nice place, food was good, service was good. But seriously, how can you really spruce up Thai food? I get it locally where I live and pay $15 for food for two people with leftovers and its just as good. I wouldn't come here expecting to be impressed, its just plain old good Thai food."

Unfortunately, I didn't find it at Lemongrass.\n\nThe service was excellent, so no complaints there. The food was extremely average though, and definitely not worth the price. We ordered satay chicken and Tom Kha Gai for starters, and green and yellow chicken curries for mains (entrees). All of the meals were well presented, but extremely bland in taste. The Tom Kha soup had too much lime juice, and the curries were both almost tasteless aside from the spiciness (we ordered very mild, as we prefer the taste to the spice). The satay chicken was better, but still much too subtle in terms of flavour.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for somewhere to eat in Vegas, but there aren't many options available if you want Thai food.

On the table they have a cup with wooden/bamboo chopsticks. I personally think if it was an upscale Asian restaurant they'd be pretty and reusable but that's my opinion. \n\nWe ordered Tom Kha Chicken to start which was awesome. They didn't spoon the soup into individual bowls which I thought was odd. I guess I'm just use to Asian restaurants doing that. For our main course we had black pepper prawns, sweet and sour chicken, some kind of curry, and I think Chow Fun. All tasted good but weren't outstanding. I guess I've had better Thai/ Chinese food with better service for cheaper back home. But then again I have to give them credit for being open so late. \n\nAfter adding some sodas, beers, and white rice the total was well over $100.

The next time we saw him we told him the sofa was flat and he offered to get us something else but I asked if they could just replace the co2 but he literally said no. Ok fine. \nThen it took about another 20 minutes to get our appetizers and even longer for our meal. \n\nThe food... eh. Very lacking in flavor and I would not recommend eating chicken since both things we ordered had a very rubbery weird version of chicken. \n\nI would not recommend this place at all.

None of us want to leave the table with the oil exec from Houston and the French tourist who likes to bluff. I don't know what it is but I really enjoy taking money off the French. Gonna have to look in to that. Anyway, I'm a little hungry and after my fourth greyhound I need some food. But I wanna keep it healthy and light so I call the brush. She hands me a menu to Lemongrass for table-side service which I will gladly tip her well for. I see brown rice on the menu for $5 and I ask the brush to tell them to add a side order of broccoli. She says no problem and I tip her $5 for ordering/picking it up.\n\nShe comes back a few minutes later with the bill and its for $24 and change?????? I'm  confused, and assume she mixed my order up with another but no. I tell her to hold the order and let me know what the $24 charge is for (I'm staying upstairs and assume they'd charge my room cc at some point). She said that the manager said they don't do sides of broccoli and had to order the vegetarian dinner. I again am confused and let her know the vegetarian dinner is full of brown rice, noodles, and a mixture of veggies and mushrooms (is that a vegetable or a fungus?). She said the manager said this is all they can do for me. I tell her to cancel the order and say keep the tip for your efforts.\n\nAfter my button passes I take a walk across the casino to the restaurant, more like a cafe. The manager is extremely smug and rigid. I am utterly shocked by his lack of customer service to not only a gambling guest, but a hotel guest as well. He makes some snide comment about me not wanting to pay or not \"having enough\" to pay for my meal. Again, completely shocked I decide to make a statement and accidentally drop my wad of gambling c-notes on his counter which he picks up and hands back to me. Douchey as it was, this pompous cafe manager had to be put in his place.\n\nI returned to the poker table where we shortly left to get some Nobu at Hard Rock.\nIt was a great trip but this was more surprising than anything.

I thought this place was a bit pricey, but the city center theme was created to be upscale so it is understandable. \n\nI also had the papaya salad that came with the coconut rice. It was very good. \n\nBeing a local and having so many great thai food restaurant options, I would never head out to lemongrass just to have lunch. But if the presentation and ambiance is important to you, it would be the way to go.\n\nMy friend and I had lunch here and were trying to plan our resolutions for 2010. We were interrupted a bit too much as the waitresses were very eager to please. I don't mine an occasional excuse me, and checking up if the food was OK, but literally interrupted me more than 5 times. I would have preferred that they recognize that we were having a conversation and just refilled my water and took my plates away rather than interrupt me."

The scallops were delicious but everything was just a bit too spicy for my taste.   The waiter seemed unhelpful when asked for his opinion on different dishes and cocktails.  One of the specialty cocktails (\"something Leopard\") tasted medicinal.  My biggest recommendation would be the salmon rolls for an appetizer.  They were really good."

Consistently good and had good service as well and at a reasonable price.\n\nI eat a LOT of thai food and I have to say that Lemongrass has some of the better Thai food I've eaten, not the best, but it's very good. \nI often started with the chicken satay which is standard but good and/or the tom yum soup which had a bit more flavor than a number of other tom yum soups I've had.\n\nFor the entree, I've had a number of things. My favorite Thai dishes are yellow curry and panang curry and Lemongrass offers high quality curries, both had good flavor and spice without overwhelming and the consistency of the curry was correct as well, not too runny like some places.\nThey have plenty of fried rice options which are good and also offer a good pad see ew. One of the times I was there, a friend got the crab which was a full crab on a plate. I'm allergic, but it was very cool to see and looked incredibly fresh and delicious. \n\nOverall, I always enjoyed Lemongrass and would gladly recommend it to others."

I'm not a buffet person. Fast casual is great, but not for every meal. And the same goes for high end dining- I'll do it for something special, but it'll break the bank if I go every night. Lemongrass hits that rare sweet spot of being somewhere in the middle. It's a sit down restaurant with a nice ambience, provides tasty food in decent portions, all while being reasonably priced.\n\nSpeaking of tasty food, Lemongrass carries one of my favorite dishes ever-- the Mee Goreng. Consisting of wok-fried yellow noodle, fried tofu, egg, potatoe, chili, tomato, choy sum and chicken (or your choice of beef or shrimp), it hits all the right notes. The sauce is slightly tangy and sweet while the egg, potato and chicken add a savory flavor. It's served in a hearty portion with the ability to choose your level of spice. When I visit a Thai restaurant for the first time, I always wonder if they are going to white-wash the spice level. This is not the case here with a level 6 nearly burning my palate off (just how I like it!). Last time I visited the waitress even said I'm more Asian than her! If mee goreng isn't your thing (it should be), Lemongrass also offers a variety of other dishes such as rice, curry and even lobster or steak. They have good appetizers too-- I'm a huge fan of the spring rolls (they're fried so don't come here right before the pool) and one of my friends swears by the jellyfish.\n\nUsually there isn't too bad of a wait and you can make reservations in advance. The staff have always been prompt and friendly. I can't say enough good things about this place. It's always a must when I come to Vegas!"

Variety is always good. \n\nWe ordered the rib eye steak, duck red curry, and two other dishes I barely remember.  The duck curry was hands down the best.  It was really tasty, if a tad sweet.  The crappy part about the dish was that there was barely any duck in it.  What duck it did have was tender and well-cooked.  \n\nI only ate a piece of the steak - it was ok.  The other two dishes I don't remember were average. We also had spring rolls with cream cheese inside - strange, but not bad.  \n\nOverall, the food was fine.  It's friggin pricey for Thai food ($30+ per person after tax and tip), but that's probably the cheapest place to eat at in Aria, next to the crap-tacular cafe they have. And maybe the buffet which judging from reviews, is pretty crap-tastic itself.\n\nService here, unlike the rest of Aria, was actually okay.  I only had to ask for the check twice.

The I realized why as my meal progressed.\nDecided to come here for lunch since we wanted something inside the hotel to save time, and most other restaurants were closed for lunch.\nPromptly seated when we arrived, and they informed us there was still dim sum being served so we were pretty excited. The food is Chinese and Thai, even though they call themselves a Thai restaurant.\nSo they actually pushed around some dim sum on a cart. We ordered a bunch of things and the guy pushing the cart was a pretty good salesman because we ended up with a bunch of stuff, and he spoke Cantonese as well. Most of the dim sum dishes were b/n $5-7. Definitely more expensive than most restaurants.\nChicken feet - 3.5 stars, I like dim sum king better, but it was decent.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=eI9PBrgTDLA7H7pJy1mEXw\\\nShark fin dumpling - 3.5 stars, tasted fresh and not too bad. But I've never been a huge fan because I don't really like cilantro.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=-ry4GWNxlXF2K5xWH9Mpew\nStick rice in lotus leaf - 4.5 stars. This was really good. Very flavorful, filled with lots of meat, and they used regular shrimp rather than dried shrimp.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=uquHg71LwLDWok7uSHRd8w\nThe next three is part of dim sum but it was not readily available on the cart. But it only took a few minutes from the point of ordering to arrival.\nStuffed crab claw - 4 stars, it tasted really fresh and filled with crab and shrimp compared to most dim sum places. However as you eat the claw you can taste that it's been previously frozen. Fresher than other places, but not completely fresh. Didn't care for the mayo that came with it, just used chili sauce and soy sauce. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=3nvHw_BHvGUeHjC72yuRVQ\nCurry pork bun and basil chicken bun. I like the curry pork bun, didn't taste so much like curry but had a little kick and lots of flavor. I thought the basil chicken tasted a little bland but my bf liked it.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=eQm37SiDOa4Nhz4-RgV_IQ\nWe had ordered off the regular menu and was waiting on the rest of our food. We picked the basil meatball soup, chicken curry, and after reading good reviews for the satay, I opted for the lobster satay.\nThey bring out the food, and despite repeating lobster satay back to me, they brought a lobster salad. I informed them that it was the wrong item, so they took the salad away and one can only assume that they were suppose to bring me my satay.\nBasil meatball soup $9 - 4 stars. FIlled with tender soft meatballs, and loaded with lots of basil leaves. The soup was light and refreshing, and the immense taste of basil left my mouth feeling refreshed. Not too greasy, and perfectly seasoned.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=96Sz_IJDONzTffXoJBk9Ug\nCurry - 3 stars. Tasted like everywhere else to me, the only bonus is that it was loaded with potatoes. My bf actually didn't like the curry and he only ate a little bit of it. I barely touched it so we threw most of it away.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg?select=BfPRtLtMz5sWYqgKvOf-tA\nSo about 30-35 minutes have past since they brought me the wrong dish. We are completely done eating and still nothing. Took us about 5 more minutes to flag down out waiter, even though it was not busy at all. And he said that it's almost ready. I didn't even really want it at this point. But he just said it was coming and ran off. Waited waited waited...... 5 more minutes passes by, so I was like forget it, let's go this is stupid. It doesn't take 45 minutes to make satay. So another 5 minutes passes before we find out waiter again and ask for the bill.\nSo guess what, they CHARGED me for the lobster satay that I DIDN\"T eat and I DIDN\"T receive. Are you kidding me?????????\nSo his explanation was he took off the dim sum items instead. Well he took off three dim sum items that added up to $18 while my satay was $22, so WTF. It's not about $4, because even then our lunch was well over $100. I don't care about $4. I care about the principle that you did not serve me well, and you want to rip me off additionally. Why can't you just reverse the satay?? Why must you do some funky thing and take off three dim sums that adds up to less than my satay? Seriously?????????\nI would NEVER eat here again. I am surprised for a wonderful hotel like Aria that they would even have a restaurant like this. The service is so below par. Unfortunately I wrote a 20%+ tip before I saw the charges.\n\nI always stayed at Aria when I went to Vegas since it opened for the last 10 times I've visited. I am really disappointed. Avoid this place, NOT WORTH IT. Such shady business practices."

I had the Watermelon Caipiroska and it was a table favorite.  Really tasty and refreshing without being overly sweet.  You can't even taste the liquor in here.  My sister had the Berry Botanical, but the green tea was a little overpowering.  The Ginger Peach was good too but the vodka does come through even with the black tea.  Wine list is decent and included a really tasty Pinot from Holdredge.  I loved how the wine list was broken down between delicate and full-bodied.\n\nFor appetizers, we started with Chicken Satay and Veggie Spring Rolls.  Satay was tasty with a really good peanut sauce, served with skewers poked into a pineapple chunk.  Spring rolls were standard but good.  For dinner, I split an order of Dan Dan noodles and Basil Chicken with another member of our party.  We sub'd the minced pork with sliced chicken, but ended up getting minced chicken which worked out just fine.  Didn't realize it was going to come out as soupy as it did, but that was OK.  The chili oil and peanut combination gave it a nice sweet and sour taste.  The basil chicken was AMAZING.... all the pieces of meat were so tender and juicy.

But all the meals are free from my poker comps so I'm here more than I would if free market forces were applied.\n\nThe Soft-shelled crab fried rice is really really good fried rice. With that said, it's fried rice and it costs something like 30 dollars. They also have a slew of dishes and you can adjust the \"hotness level\" on a scale of 1-10. I've tried level 5 and 8, and the dish that was the 5 was more spicy than some of the 8's, so I think it's spotty. If you like your stuff spicy, 8 is a good level.\n\nI don't remember all the other dishes I tried, but they are all decent."

Appetizers came and we finished them, they cleared the table and then the soup and all the entrees showed up.  The soup takes time to serve and eat and by the time you're finished then the entrees aren't as hot as you would like.  A nice place like this should know better.  I was PO'ed at their mistake and at myself for not sending the entrees back.

I ordered pad kee mao spicy 4/10. I'm not sure how they measure their spicy level, but I did say 4/10, which shouldn't be all that spicy.. but it was. I couldn't enjoy it because my tongue was burning. but there was so much wrong with this, I don't even.. ok, so aside from the spiciness, the meat and especially the vegtables were inconsistently cut. majority of the pieces were very big as well as very undercooked. another thing was that the noodles were hardly seperated; most of the noodles were still stuck together. lastly, there was so much basil.. again, aside from it being not cooked properly, there was so much that I had it in every bite, it was overpowering.\nthat being said, I would not come here again, and I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. it's just bad food for an expensive price."

This is not a thai restaurant, but a restaurant with south east asian cuisine.  You will be dissapointed if you think you are going to get good thai food here.  Thought they had the dim sum cart, but that is only offered on the weekends - Fri, Sat, Sun.  \n\nWe had the bacon satay.  The server said it was fatty and no kidding, it was.  It was not like the bacon you have at breakfast, but a fatty piece of pork.  You get 4 skewers.  I could barely take 1 down.   \n\nWe had the Drunken Noodle with Seafood, the Softshell Crab fried rice and the grilled pork neck.  The best dish was the drunken noodle.  It had a nice basil flavor to the noodle.  I could not find the seafood, except for 2 shrimp and 1 scallop.  \n\nThe soft shell crab fried rice was okay at best.  Lots of crab, but it seemed that they did not clean the body of the crab well, as it tasted really gutty and had a strong fish smell.  The fried rice was like any other asian fried rice.  Nothing special. \n\nThe grilled pork neck was the best dish.  The sauce was exceptional.  It did not sound like a great dish, but it was.  Very lean pork with a soy, mandarin, lime sauce.  Very tasty.  \n\nService was okay.  Jeremy was a decent server.  The busboys were able to keep up with the iced tea and water service.  We drink fast and a lot, so anyone who can keep up with us, is fantastic."

No. However, they do it right and it always tastes good to me. I will always try to squeeze two portions of it per one Vegas trip. \n\nOther than my beloved char kway teow, I never really tried anything else here except the chicken and corn soup and mee goreng. Friends ordered the dan dan noodle, drunken noodle, and pad see ew. I was always sticking with my shrimp char kway teow cooked spicy. Sooo good!!!\n\nThe restaurant was next to the baccarat lounge and across from Blossoms Chinese Restaurant. It caters mostly to South East Asian foods. This hotel is smart as there are tons of S.E Asians that gamble hugely here. My friend, CK, recommended this place several years back and I still love it to this day. He told me to get a fried garlic crab this time. He said it was out of this world. I didn't get it though because I couldn't eat a whole crab alone.\n\nI'm a big fan! The service is always pretty quick, perfect if you were trying to slip in lunch in between meetings. We were in a time constraint to watch Zarkana, and they did an awesome job in getting the foods we ordered in record time. \n\nWhen in Vegas and you like South East Asian cuisines-Thai, Vietnamese, Malaysian, Singaporean, and Indonesian... Lemongrass is the place!"

The hot and sour soup had no shredded pork in it, just generous amount of veggies in very sour and fairly spicy hot soup, that was all I needed at the moment!

The restaurant serves Thai food although you wouldn't know this as they don't display a menu outside! We didn't have a reservation but went just after 9pm and could see that the restaurant was only half full. Asked for a table for 2 when the girl at the desk finally returned and she said she could see what she could do! She managed to find us a table but really didn't seem to know what she was doing. \n\nWe ordered and this is when we should have realised there would be a problem. The table next to us asked for the manager to complain about something, we should have left then! However, I know they had only been open just over a week so I thought it wouldn't be too bad. Little did I know. \n\nWe ordered a satay and salmon roll to start and then chicken green curry. I wanted chicken satay but was told there was no chicken satay and I could have pork instead. Why could they not put chicken on a stick??? Had they run out of pre-prepared chicken satay? We also ordered a bottle of wine. \n\nAfter around 15 minutes our waiter brought a glass of wine. Oh dear, but not the end of the world as this was easy to fix. He brings the bottle back and then proceeds what seems like at least 5 minutes trying to open it. I have never seen anyone spend so long trying to open a bottle of wine. I almost asked for the corkscrew myself as it was embarrassing to watch him fumble with it. When he finally opened it he then dropped the cork in the wine cooler! He certainly wasn't used to opening wine and by the way he slouched around the restaurant and didn't seem to know what he was doing I got the impression that he hadn't worked in a restaurant before. \n\nBy this point the couple at the table next to us had been sitting there around 10 minutes without a menu and if their body language was anything to go by they weren't having a fun evening.The woman next to them was sat with arms folded staring towards the kitchen too. \n\nHad a glass of wine (this was nice) and then another. By this point I'm wondering where on earth the food was. We weren't drinking fast and I know that some sort of food should have arrived before we'd had 2 glasses of wine each. I then see a table opposite (who had arrived quite some time after us) being served food. I check my watch and it is almost 1 hour after we arrived. We call the manager over and ask what is going on and where our food was. He returns to say that there has been a problem with the order being put into the system (ie it wasn't!). I'd had enough by now and say we would like to leave and we'd pay for the wine. He tells us he'll take car of the wine for us and we leave. \n\nThis is the first time I have left a restaurant before even eating. I understand that they had only just opened and were bound to have some teething problems but half of the staff seemed completely useless and lacked any experience. There were a couple of people rushing around and looked like they had worked in restaurants before but the majority of them were clueless. No one spotted that we never had any food in almost an hour and the manager was stood practically next to us the entire time! \n\nOne more small thing, I was sat on a comfy seat but my husband said the chair he was sitting on was incredibly uncomfortable (he mentioned this just after arriving too so it was nothing to do with the wait)."

The yellow curry was like an elixir. It came in a huge bowl, and even though I was hungry (I mean, really really really hungry), I couldn't finish the whole thing. It didn't come with everything that was listed as being in it on the menu, but when I mentioned it, our waitress was quick to correct the problem. She wasn't my favorite server ever -- it was a very generic and impersonal experience -- but she was nice and helpful, and although I like more, I don't feel like I can expect that. \n\nMy boyfriend got the vegetable fried rice, which was also really good. Both of us enjoyed our food so much that for the rest of the trip we kept talking about going back there instead of trying other restaurants. \n\nThe experience wasn't 100%, but the food was so good and generously portioned that it actually merited the price. We only went there once on this trip, but I'm sure we'll be back again on a future trip."

            "review": "First thing you think of when you go into the Aria Hotel is bling bling, I must be getting paper fo'sho if i'm staying here. That ubiquitous air of wealth and luxury permeates the atmosphere, you can't help but feel like Justin Bieber in Vegas. You're the bomb; anything is possible in sin city. With this new found confidence and flare for extravagance, what sort of dining experience do you expect? I'm thinking exotic. I'm thinking fantabulous. I'm thinking thai food.\n\nSo, during my short stay at the Aria hotel in Las Vagas, me and my family decided to go to Lemongrass. First of all, the decor was amazing. Curtains of fringe hung effortlessly on the ceiling, creating a tent over some of the tables. The lights were dim, creating a very sensual atmosphere, mimicking that oriental mysteriousness of Asia. Om nom nom nom, this place looks amazing!\n\nI wish i could say the same about the food. It was like turning on the T.V, being all excited to watch the new episode of the Real Housewives of New York, but getting disappointed when instead, you see the rerun of a cheap, tacky real housewife of New Jersey flipping a table. Don't tase me bro! I love the Manzos and all, but the Simon and Alex are where it's at! Anyway, back to the food, I could have gotten tastier, more authentic thai food at half the price right here in OC. Don't get me wrong though, the food wasn't horrible, it was very much delicious.  For appetizers, we ordered the Yam Ta Krai (lemongrass, fresh prawns, squid, scallops, spicy tamarind dressing) and Tom Yam Talay soup (spicy seafood, prawns, scallop, squid, lemongrass, abalone mushrooms).The appetizers were amazing! The seafood was super fresh, and everything was really tasty and flavorful.\n\nWhat I was really disappointed in were the entrees. I hate curry...NOT. I'm bananas for curry. Everytime I eat thai food, which is very often, I order curry again and again and again. I would bathe in curry and immerse myself in its deliciousness if I could. Curry is better than shark week; it is legend...wait for it...dary. So, i ordered the green curry since it came with eggplant ( eggplant is a sign God wants us to be happy). I didn't hate it, I could never hate curry. It would be like a mother hating her child. It was just watered down and lacked that unctuous and satisfying spice that curry is supposed to have. My mom ordered the Drunken Noodles, which I guess is one of their specialties. To be honest, these noodles tasted like a typical msg-ridden fried noodle dish from a mediocre Vietnamese restaurant. The crisp on the noodles was nice; but like the curry, it lacked flavor. \n\nThe dessert was amazing though! But then again, I've never complained about the dessert at any restaurant. Dessert is like Ryan Gosling; it's good all the time. I ordered mango sticky rice, a thai classic! If you've never had mango sticky rice, you have never lived. The red ruby was very tasty as well. It was shaved ice with corn, jellies, and jack fruit. The corn was a sweet, surprising touch. \n\nOverall the restaurant was average. I would give ten stars for the decor but only three stars for the actual food. Compared to the prices of other shnazzy Vegas restaurants, this place was a pretty good deal. But compared to a more humble, authentic thai restaurant, the food seemed bland. If you want super yummy, exotic drinks, appetizers, and deserts with a cool and stylish ambiance, definitely try this place!"

The fish cakes were really delicious and the pad thai fulfilled my Asian craving. \n\nI actually came back to this place a couple of hours later because my other friends were also having an Asian food craving. I had the Tom Yam Hed which is a abalone mushroom soup as well as their Singapore Noodles to go which consists of stir-fried rice vermicelli, BBQ pork, shrimp, onion, bean sprouts, bell pepper, egg, and curry powder. I was amazed by how well the singapore noodles lasted a couple of hours after a late dinner. The soup and the noodles were pretty good. At least I know that the quality of the food is consistent.

From the cart we selected the soup and the spinach and shrimp dumplings. They weren't as piping hot as I might have enjoyed, and the soup dumplings weren't as soupy as your dreams. However, the taste, especially of the shrimp/spinach, was excellent. I would get those again. Plus, the environment is about 5 times nicer than your usual dim sum establishment. We also sampled the chicken wings this time around, and they were surprisingly delicious. Their soft tofu is superb in their curries. They don't take it easy on the spice though, so be careful what you ask for. We also tried the Three Cups Chicken, but for the price and execution, you're better off doubling down on the chicken wings!"

It has to be good, right? I guess the interior can really fool people in terms of quality because this place was just a disappointment. \n\nService: 1/5 I have expectations when it comes to upscale restaurants like these because one, we're shelling out a bit more money than a typical restaurant. Two, it's in Aria. I'm pretty sure that they just rent out the space in the hotel, but still, I imagined that they would want to provide the same type of service. \n\nWe were at at our table, and whoever was responsible for taking care of us pretty much neglected us. Getting our drinks was the only fastest part of the service. Everything else was just plain annoying. We waited a bit for our waiter to take our order. Nothing was special about it as he just took the order, and left. All throughout the meal, he never came back to check on us. It was to the point when we were done and STILL waiting. Like, WHY?!\n\nFood: 2/5 I think the chicken satay redeemed itself because that was pretty tasty, but there was nothing special about it. I thought it was beautifully prepared though. We ordered pad thai, pad see ew, and duck panang for the main entree. Both were bland in taste which was such. a. disappointment. Seriously, for the price that we paid for and the taste, it just doesn't match. I can literally go down to an average Thai restaurant here in Vegas, and they would probably taste the same-- Bland. The duck panang was a bit tasty as well but it couldn't hit that \"wow' factor. The duck was tender, but the sauce-- not so much. \n\nInterior: 4/5 This place is beautiful which entices people to walk in and dine with them. I was a fan of the darkly lit room and the positioning of all the booths and tables. Their decor was amazing as well. The overall look of the restaurant is the only reason why I'm giving this review a two star. \n\nOverall, it was a disappointment. I felt bad enough that my aunt didn't want me to pay for dinner since I was the one that suggested it. Next time, I'm going to take her to my favorite Thai restaurant (which I won't name because that isn't fair) as it doesn't disappoint. I have to say that there are definitely better restaurants out there that can definitely compete with this place."

The pad thai was delish, loved that they put the peanuts and bean sprouts on the side because my dining companions enjoy the noodles without it. The three chicken spicy dish was great! Very flavorful with ample amount of meat. The tom yum was my least favorite, only because it was way to spicy for us! (But that's our fault for ordering it too spicy. They will ask you on a range of 1-10 how spicy you would like your soup.)\n\nOur server was very friendly and sociable. She came around often to replenish our drinks.

We asked for a 7, and got a good runny-nose spicy that we were craving! Only gripe: the soup was big enough for two, but only had 3 small pieces of lobster meat. The green curry was also good. But, wasn't out-of-this-world amazing. It hit the spot. The vegetable fried rice was not as great. It was on the bland side, and a tad oily. The cashew nut chicken had great flavors, lots of cashews. \n\nI loved how they knew their spice! The dishes weren't bland, and they were spicy enough for us to enjoy, without burning our tongues off! Service was very attentive -- although at times it got overwhelmingly attentive! \n\nOverall, a bit pricey for the food served, but it's to be expected at a strip restaurant.

Looking at their menu, Lemongrass is advertised as thai food, but there's also chinese and vietnamese food on the menu. \n\nThai Iced Tea- (3/5) it was okay, slightly too creamy\nChicken Wings- (3/5) the wings without the sauce didn't have much flavor and tasted better with the sweet chili sauce. However, you can get the sauce from a bottle at an Asian market.\nTom Kha soup- (1/5) enough for 4 bowls, dried chicken pieces and mushy mushroom, no other veggies\nChicken Pad Thai (lvl 6)- (3/5) didn't have the tradition sweet taste of pad thai and tasted mostly like spicy\n\nI think if you're really really craving thai, I guess this place is okay. However, if you can drive a little off the strip, you're better off going to a hole in the wall thai restaurant. You'll probably get much more authentic food for a quarter of the price."

Also the hostesses were very condescending and annoying. The staff needs to learn manners and know how to deal with customers"

            "review": "The menu here was very standard American Thai -- nothing out-of-the-ordinary. You've got your Pad Thai, some various noodle dishes, some soups, a few curries, and so forth. Some were dressed up a bit (lobster in the Tom Yum soup), but it was basically a standard menu.\n\nBut it was as fresh and clean and well-prepared as any Thai food I've had. Flavors were right-on. The soup was perfectly balanced (cool + hot). My shrimp were nicely crusted. There was a bit too much syrupy sauce on one tofu stir fry dish for my liking, but that was the only loser.\n\nThe restaurant is a little hidden in the Aria, and both times we went there was no wait. The price is about the same as the buffet upstairs (which can have long lines!), but the food is definitely a notch higher.\n\nAnd, they take the heat ratings seriously here. I asked for mine to be 8/10. I'm usually good with the heat but this was a bit too much! (They warned me, so I can't hold it against them.)"

Ive been to many other Thai restaurants and have not been a fan. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing. Pricey, but you're paying for what you get. I recommend the two dishes along with pineapple fried rice if you're a pineapple fanatic."

It was very good, but we did not realize that we would have the option to order dim sum from a cart.  The dim sum is a star at this place.  The dim sum server was very knowledgeable and recommended a few options.  Most of them were from the pot sticker and dumpling family.  Tell them the type of food you like, and your server will help you find something.  You can't go wrong, and each order has about 3 or 4 pieces and runs about $5 each.\n\nThe menu is extensive here, and has something for those who like traditional Asian dishes, like my wife who ordered the Singapore Noodles.  I like more Asian-American fare, so I ordered the Beef Chow Fun, it tasted like an Asian version of beef stroganoff.  You could really take the cast iron skillet flavor.  Amazing dish for around $15.  \n\nThe service was great, and he had plenty of good suggestions, and drinks were always being filled before we had to ask."
