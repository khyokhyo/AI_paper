            "review": "By FAR and I mean FAAAAAAAAAAAAAR the best Pizza in Las Vegas. Have been 2x in the past 3 weeks. I grew up in the Tri-State area and this is the real deal. The meatballs remind me of Sunday dinners my grandmother used to make. UNREAL. Perfect texture and excellent gravy. And the Pizza? Again nails it. I prefer the thin crust - and you can tell the ingredients are fresh and imported. And no nasty Las Vegas water used in the mix. Sure it's expensive, you get what you pay for. If you want $5 go to Ceci's Buffet or Pizza Hut, and for those who give it a \"meh\" they HAVE to be accustomed to glop with ranch dressing or the cardboard that passes as \"California Pizza\". I feel bad for you. The staff was amazing - friendly, attentive and actually knew what they were doing (a rarity in Vegas). They even have Moretti Dark beer!!  \n\nAnd I have a very strong opinion of the Mets and Yankees, by the way. And I could never eat pizza anywhere else in Vegas now - not like I did much before YUCK! Meets my standards and I grew up in a NY Italian immigrant family - so there."

            "review": "They got some pretty damn good specials after 10pm but the nite we went (Jade's UYE) the bartender was just not up for doing his job.\n\nWhen i approached the bar to ask about what kind of drinks were available during the happy hour i was informed that anything they didnt have to open (ie wines) were half off. Then i was told the server would be taking my order. After we ate and paid the bill a few of us migrated over to the bar for some drinks and the first thing i was asked by the bartender was \"where's your server?\" \n\nFood wise everything was pretty good. Some things are better on certain crusts like the white pizza on the thin pan totally awesome and considerably less troublesome than going to cosmo for secret pizza. \n\nThe Di Fara Special on square cut thick crust is absolutely incredible with the crisp pepperoni but i honestly would have loved it a lot more if they julienned the basil and just threw it all over the damn pie with no regard of quantity control what so ever.\n\nThat's about all i can remember at the moment. Being super super hungry and devouring an alarming amount of square cut slices and washing it down with many Angry Orchard ales on tap to suddenly get you full takes a lot out of you. \n\nI definitely know where to go if i ever have a late night pizza craze on the cheap side now.\n\n\nYelp 100 - 024 of 100"

            "review": "Burt had a great dinner at Dom Demarco's.\n\nVery nice dining room.  Comfortable, private outside patio/outdoor space.  Friendly helpful staff.  \n\nBurt had the fried eggplant with fresh ricotta for an app. (hint- order some fresh ricotta on the side for the table)   It was very good.  Linguini and clams was very flavorful and tasty.  Just the right amount of garlic,  not overbearing.  \n\nBurt's mom had spaghetti and meatballs.  I know, its a basic dish but it tells a lot about an Italian place.  Very good meatballs, spaghetti was prepared correctly, nice gravy.  \n\nThe dessert was GREAT!!!  Homemade cannoli and tiramisu. No matter how stuffed you are from dinner, make sure you order some desert.   The cappuccino was so-so. \n\nDommy D's gets an extra point because the waitress was cute (she looks like a mature version of Burt's old lady). - That's a good thing!\n\nBURT'S DISCLAIMER - Dom DeMarco is known for their pizza.  I guess Obama ordered some pie's from here when he was in town.  Burt didn't try the pizza.  It did look delicious but Burt feels this is an incomplete review without tasting the pie.  Possible upgrade to 4.5 stars.       To be continued.\n\nUPDATE - Burt did go back to try the pizza. Yes it is very good. Thin crispy crust, nice sauce, light cheese. So yes the pie is good. The problem was that the regular food didn't taste as good as it did the first time. Maybe it was an \"off\" night?  Therefore no upgrade in rating because the food slid down a notch but the pizza lifted the rating back to where it was. \nPS Burt still gives the server a great review. WSUP"

            "review": "Family night with my brother guys. He wanted too check this place out since lot of his friends been yleping it and only heard good things about. We checked out see for ourselves. The wait not that bad less then twenty minutes. We went right about busy time 6pm. There lots of places too sit down wait either at the bar, and outside patio area. I know nothing too do with yelp but thought it was cool beepers tell you table ready shaped like pizza! \n\nWe had couple appetizers too start our meal fried calamari and buffalo mozzarella/tomatoe. Calamari was fried too nice golden crispy. I liked is the batter not that heavy so nice light and marinara dipping sauce was good. Buffalo mozzarella was really nice. It nice soft consistency not firm one. Felt much more flavor and depth but paired it with fresh tomatoes perfect! \n\nMy brother, sister-in-law and I shared thick crust pizza or felt like it was more foccaica white cheese pizza. It shaped like rectangle first instinct round table pizza. Honestly not even in the ballpark. This pizza has soo much flavor and I enjoyed the crust it was different then normal thin crust pizza always eat. My nieces had the pasta with meatballs. I tried the meatballs. Good. It nice moist in the center cooked just right and nice seasonings too it. \n\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter accident dropped couple pieces of calamari brought it too the table. Surprised he going too return with couple more but ended up giving up another order free of charge. Classy. The hostess greeted us with smile and even on the way out. It great atmosphere and feels like old school family run italian restaurant. \n\nIf you in need for good thick crust pizza not go wrong at DeMarcos! Maybe next time go save room for desserts."

            "review": "Decided to try this pizza place out due to all the great yelp reviews. We called in our order and was ready by the time we got there. They have 2 parking spots for to-go orders in which you call and they bring your order out. \n\nWe ordered their caprese salad (different name the menu but same concept) and while it was fantastic the price for what we received was sad. There were 12 quartered pieces of red  tomato and slivers of basil with a nice hunk of a more creamy mozzarella. They give you plenty of mozzarella but a few extra tomato slices and a lot more basil would make this salad worth the $12. As it stands its a one person appetizer. \n\nWe ordered the Do Fara Special pizza. It comes in thick crust only which was good (burnt on the edges so that was a let down), however the pizza sauce tasted like spaghetti sauce. That was something I hadn't expected and didn't care for. If I wanted spaghetti I would have ordered it. The pepperoni was small and over cooked. The basil was itty bitty and couldn't even be tasted. \n\nI'll give this place on more chance when we're feeling like pizza again, but after this first experience I'd have to say that even Papa John's has better pizza then what we had tonight."

            "review": "Okay. Let me start off by saying this. I live in Las Vegas, but I am from Brooklyn, NY. For 41 years I had lived in NYC and know all there is to know about pizza. I grew up with pizza. I have worked in pizzerias, i have studied pizza. My college degree is in Pizza. I don't believe in hype. Yea I heard the POTUS ordered here when he was in town. But he's from Chicago, and deep dish is good. UT not the pizza I know and love... So what could he know. I didn't go because of that I went because it was supposed to be a copycat of DiFaras world famous in Brooklyn pizza. \n\nThe pizza here is in my mind, the absolute best I have had in Las Vegas. It isn't exactly the same as you would get in a NY pizza joint, but comes close enough. For LV it is very very good. For a NY transplant to want to take their guests and Italian relatives here it would have to be. Don't believe any reviews here that say otherwise.\n\nI have been to the DiFara's in Brookyn whose maestro is the eponymous inspiration for this establishment. I am not at all crazy about DiFara's and at $5 a slice it is way overpriced and overhyped, but they do make an excellent square slice, or as we in NY call, a Sicilian. So, that is what we ordered here... Very comparable. As close to a copy as one could get here. It had enough cheeses and sauce with the requisite fresh basil on top. It was very crunchy on the side crust and bottom as a good Sicilian should be and soft and airy in the middle. Very well done... Maybe, maybe just a bit oily, but not offensive. We have been back 4 times since and were always very pleased. I doubt I will try another pizzeria here again, and just to clarify a point... We love Due Forni on Town Center Drive but that isn't really pizza. It's gourmet pizza, not NY pizza. \n\nThe service varies. Good to okay, nothing to complain about. We have had the spinach salad which was very tasty and the eggplant appetizer which was very good as well. \nOn our last visit we order the round pie, or Neapolitan. It was very good as well, better than my wife and I expected. We had made the square our go-to dish, but now can def say the round will be added to our repoirtoire.\n\nIf anyone knows of a comparable place in Las Vegas let me know. Honorable mention to Broadway Pizza on N. Rancho."

We also got an order of the meat balls which were tender and the sauce was perfect. The pizza was okay - wasn't the best I've had. \n\nOne perk - we saw Nicholas Cage here with his family :)"

DeMarco's does not quite meet that lofty standard, but is awfully good. I drove 2 pizzas back to henderson, ate them luke warm after 40 minutes in the trunk, and loved every minute of it. Flavors are so good, and love the basil on top! We will be back. Wish there was one in Henderson..."

She posts up under the table (when she is not trying to sneak a peak at the other pups) while we enjoy a nice outdoor meal. They even brought her out a bowl of water. Sufficient shade and misters for a sunny day.... and heat lamps for the cooler evenings. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit.... with or without your pet. \n\nTip: order the garlic bread with cheese on top and a side of ranch.

            "review": "Decided to stop in Dom DeMarco's after hearing good things on Yelp and from friends. Glad we did! I am a big time fan of Sicilian style pizza (square cut thick crust). I looked at the menu for all of 10 seconds and decided I was going to try The Di Fara Special. We ordered a half for the two of us and it was perfect... 6 slices. Almost no complaints on the pizza other than the pepperoni was a bit overdone (they should put it on later in the cooking process I think). The flavors were incredible and I wanted to just keep eating more and more. Cue the kids from the AT&T commercial (we want more). \n\nService was friendly and attentive.. didn't have to wait for refills. The restaurant is clean and well maintained. I look forward to visiting here again. \n\nA bit on the pricey side... we paid $17 for the half pie (slightly under $3 a slice)."

Quick service but not overly intrusive.  Had 15th Street BLT salad for starters, a great big salad perfect for two hungry people.  Lots of bacon, delicious gorgonzola dressing. Wife had the Prime Rib pane (sandwich)--out of this world, very tender, med rare roast beef w/great truffle fries.  \n\nI had the Brooklyn Chicken, breaded chicken cutlet w/red peppers & provolone smothered in marinara sauce like I haven't tasted in years.  Served with spaghetti & marinara sauce.  Nice beer & wine selection, as well. Will definitely go back w/friends  family."

            "review": "This is an update of my first review - I've been back to DeMarco's 6 times in December, and I am formulating some firmer opinions. Obviously, since I have gone that often, I like it. With some experimentation, I Really like it. It is certainly the best option in LV for NY style. \n\nFirst - the crust is very good, but is Much better when you order a small rather than a large, and when you eat in. In particular, the bottom of the crust is a bit dense when you get it to go (obviously - pizza has a short life span), but it is also a little hard when I ordered a large to eat in - I think that this is because it is cooked longer. So I ordered a small, and the crust is near perfect on a small - great charring and very airy. Good Bread. I also like the olive oil the crusts are basted in - DM's puts a Lot of olive oil on top, and it spreads to the crust, and I like that. \n\nSecond - The cheese - I like the mix - I have never had one as tangy, and I prefer this to the fresh mozz on Neapolitan style. But there is a bit too much of it. I've added two pictures where I think that you can see it is a bit soupy on a large. This is also better on a small - I also asked for light cheese the last two times I was there and it was very good. \n\nThe minimalist sauce is very good, and the toppings are excellent - I mentioned that I liked the pepperoni, because it was thick enough to stand up under crisping. The sausage pie is also very good - it was very spicy with rough chunks. I like the basil - I asked if I could get the basil on it before it was cooked, which I prefer - but I was told that that wasn't okay, which I understand - that is ideological, and definitely their call. \n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nGood, but not great. \n\nHave anticipated the opening for a while. It is definitely  a transplant rather than the original - it tasted like a mass produced copy of great pizza, which still puts it Way ahead of pizza in Las Vegas, but will disappoint New Yorkers. \n\nVery good sauce and toppings - the sauce is very simple tomatoes and herbs, rather than a cooked sauce, so it tasted very fresh and tangy, rather than too sweet. The pepperoni was very good - thick enough and crispy to give a snap when biting into it. \n\nThe crust is tasty, but the texture was not perfect. This is my fault - I got it Carry Out, and had to drive for 15 minutes, so it tasted more floury and a bit dense as it cooled off. I intend to try it again in the restaurant.\n\nI also thought that there was too much cheese. \n\nWeird note - the boxes were a pain - they did not stay folded into a box, and the end kept coming open, and I almost lost the whole cheese pie as it almost slid out the end - I don't know if the boxes were cheap or just bad, but it was a pain."

            "review": "I remember reading about DeMarco's last fall on Serious Eats. That article was in the \"Slice\" section of their website, and it was following the construction of the restaurant, which was set to open sometime soon. That article lit a fire inside of me. I scoured the deepest reaches of the internet for weeks (not really), pouring over hundreds (nope) of articles and reviews of Di Fara, the original (and famous) pizzeria opened by DeMarco Sr. in New York. I had to try this pizza! The SE article didn't say when DeMarco's would open, but I knew I would be ready! I wasn't. \n\nI forgot. I had never heard of Di Fara before reading that article since I don't live in/visit New York so it wasn't at the top of my food-priority list. Also, I didn't know exactly when it was supposed to open so I couldn't mark my calendar. Fast-forward to January. Somehow I was reminded of DeMarco's and instantly thought that I needed to try it. I was a bit mad at myself for forgetting, but I soon got over it. Now I was ready!\n\nThey have two styles of pizza - New York style thin crust and a square-cut thick crust pizza. A small of either serves two people. The first time I went, my girlfriend and I tried the Di Fara Special, which is the original. I had to see what all the fuss was about., right? I liked it. Their pepperoni is AMAZING. I'm more of the thin crust person, but the thick crust had great texture and flavors. The size of the large was more than enough for the two of us (it only comes in one size), and we had some tasty leftovers for the next day! \n\nI've also tried the thin crust with just pepperoni and two of the specialty pizzas - the Big Apple and the White Truffle. The thin crust was great. Nice and foldable, exactly how I like it. The White Truffle was a bit on the oily side, but it's pizza, and it was good.  I haven't had anything there that I didn't enjoy. The atmosphere is great, and they will even charge your dying phone at the bar!\n\nI don't pretend to be a pizza expert or anything like that. I don't know what real New York pizza is supposed to be, but I know what I like. I like the pizza at DeMarco's. I don't know if it's my favorite pizza place, but it's definitely at the top of that list."

Mind you this was at 3pm on a Saturday.  Place was more than half empty so not like there weren't seats available.  This time we went in a few minutes after two, again on a Saturday and it was worse.  We were seated right away but waited 15 minutes and as we were getting ready to leave a waitress came over and asked if we had been helped.  Got our drinks and then salad but took awhile to order the pizza.   There were only a few customers in there.  Once we got the pizza the waitress was good about refilling our glasses.  We have given this place way too many chances, mainly because it is close by.  Don't know how this place and it's pizza get such good reviews.

Excellent service. \n\nDom DeMarco's actually has the recipe to DiFara's pizza, consistently rated best of Brooklyn, and it was such a treat to have a Brooklyn favorite right here in Vegas.

I'm very impressed with this place so far since they are still in the soft opening phase as I write this. Service was excellent, our waiter Juan Carlos went out of his way on many occasions to see that out needs were met, and drinks always filled. The level of attention was above and beyond, like many fine steak houses I've been to. The three of us shared the Dom's Fries, 15th St BLT salad, and the White Truffle Pizza w/meatballs. The fries were crispy and dipping aioli sauce were great, only drawback was the serving was kinda small. The salad was very good cause you can't go wrong with bacon! Finally the pizza, it was excellent, lots of flavor of garlic and truffles. My cousin loved how the crust was crisp. A little pricey even higher than Grimaldi's I think but attention to details makes up for it. Too bad its so far away from me but I'm certain try this place again. Another awesome NYC pizza place invades Las Vegas!"

While the food is middling, the service is singularly awful--I would say it's beyond detestable, but that's showing too much leniency. The restaurant was clearly short-staffed, and twenty minutes elapsed before we were even asked for our drink orders. I wanted to ask for a shaker of oregano; however, our less-than-sanguine waiter swiftly left after placing the food on the table. Are these particularly grave offenses? Not really. It was the manager, Joey, that drew my ire. My mother recently had knee surgery, and she had fallen from her chair when leaving. Though several staff members witnessed her fall, no one offered to assist her. As my family left the restaurant, Joey asked us how we were doing. I gave him my honest assessment of the service yet he did nothing but scoff at me. I did not demand anything, I did not raise my voice, I did not berate the staff. I simply said the pizza was salty and I was displeased with the way my mother was ignored. Joey sarcastically asked us if we wanted a hundred dollar bill for recompense, proceeding to yell at my grandfather who just turned eighty-three. Perhaps, Joey, I was expecting too much. I expected to be treated with civility. I expected a manager would demonstrate professionalism instead of screaming invectives. If the manager is reading this, he'll probably be quite thrilled to know that my family doesn't plan to return. Sure, the eggplant pizzette appetizers were alright, but they're certainly not worth the visit if Joey is liable to verbally abuse my family."

Always same order, large cheese pizza, zuppa di clams (white sauce), and occasionally linguini and Mediterranean Salad. \n\nOrdered usual pizza & clams. Came quickly via curbside and piping hot! HOWEVER, right away, I noticed RED sauce to my dismay. Called and was put through to manager. He said no prob, just bring them back and we'll get another order with white going.\n\nMy return for their error was \"AT BEST\" a luke warm order w/white sauce, half as many clams and cold burnt garlic bread.\n\nI've had better service & quality from them on Friday nights! Such a shame. ;-("

We were in for some protein and carb-loading since we had a full night of drinking ahead of us and at least we weren't disappointed.  Would I recommend friends to stop by for restaurant week dinner?  No.  Would I recommend they stop by for pizza?  Hell yea, especially after 10 when I guess you can call it happy hour til closing.\n\nFirst course, fried calamari.  Served with marinara.  Enough for two people.\n\nSecond course, another appetizer I guess, half Mediterranean salad.  Salad with chickepeas, tomato, olives, peppers, and cheese.  Also enough for two people.\n\nThird course, I had the Brooklyn chicken.  Breaded chicken served with spaghetti.  Enough for two people.\n\nFourth course was the vanilla panna cotta, this was good.  Most panna cottas are hit and miss.\n\nSo while portion control was excellent and my friends enjoyed their meal, they considered it a discount since all but the panna cotta is served on the regular menu.  Again, for restaurant week I would not recommend.  But their pizzas are good.  Dom, the man, not the Jr, stopped by our table to say hi and try to chat up New York stories so that was cool and the highlight of our night."

            "review": "Everything was on point the night I visited.  It was quite crowded, but service was prompt and friendly.\nI started with the Eggplant Pizzettes for an appetizer - crispy, breaded eggplant, creamy ricotta and well-seasoned tomato sauce were all delicious.\nTheir pizzas can be made with either of two crust styles: A round New York style thin crust or a square, thick crusted Sicialian pan style.  I was able to sample both.  We ordered the Di Fara Special which comes on the thick, square crust and it was fantastic.  The crust had that super crispy fried edge along the bottom that comes from being baked in an iron skillet.  It was topped with pepperoni and it was apparent that the ingredients were quality -thick cut, spicy pepperoni with fresh mozzarella, grana padano and a flavorful tomato sauce.  Each piece was quite hardy and it didn't take much to fill me up.\nThe other pizza we ordered was the Bianca on a thin crust.  This crust was not quite as thin as some New York style I have had, but the flavor of the dough was great and stood up to the toppings of garlic, basil, ricotta and cheese.\nI would have a hard time picking a favorite between the two pizzas and will most likely order one of each the next time I go.  And since I am secretly addicted to pouring Green Tabasco all over my pizza, the leftovers were almost better than the first night.  Especially with the garlic in the Bianca seeming to mellow and penetrate the remaining toppings.  \n\nThere was a line waiting to be seated as we finished eating, but our server did not try to rush us, which I appreciate.  I just hope they can maintain their quality, because I will definitely be returning soon."

The thin crust is the best in town:  melting in your mouth & not yanking on your teeth.  The outer crust charred perfectly, the sausage outstanding (& plenty of it), topped with fresh basil, the \"right\" spices & fine Mozzarella.  We must have looked stoned as we ooed & ahhd.\n  \nThe wall near the restrooms displayed articles of their many accolades, so richly deserved.  The ambiance is conducive to a feeling of community, the lighting just right, tables & booths spaced just perfectly, & a very Italian patio when weather permits.The women serving us were delightful, anxious to please, & definitely know their product.  I noticed a terrific happy hour menu (3-6:00 M-Fri.) with several Paninis, stuffed peppers, bruschetta, etc. & a fine selection of both draft beers & wines are half price. \n\nWe can't wait to reappear at DeMarco's for a taste from their huge pasta menu, as well as Veal Parmigiano, Melanzane Parmigiano, seafood Pescatori & more.\n\nAnd a BON APPETIT to you."

I found the crust to be tougher and thicker than the original. And, I couldn't tell if they added the olive oil at the end like Dom does. I guess I miss the whole ritual of watching him make my specially ordered pizza right in front of me. If you don't know what I'm talking about, YouTube DiFara Pizza. Besides these comments, I would say that the taste and essence of the pizza is almost bang-on to the Brooklyn-made pie by the pizza \"phenom\" himself. The blend of toppings definitely says \"DiFara\". I will most certainly go back the next time I'm in Vegas.  BTW I thought they would have had at least 1 photo of the \"main man\" in the restaurant.  Perhaps, I missed it!!!"

I would say that we had a good time, pizza was very good, but there were a few missteps to knock it down to 4 stars.  \n\nWe ordered some wine and beer, great wine by the glass selection and tap beer selection as well.  They had Peroni on tap which was a nice touch.  The space is really nice, we loved the design inside and were sad it was too windy to sit outside.  It looked so nice and fun with big screen tvs and a huge electric fireplace.  They have a bunch of magazines at the front door, which could be cool if you are dining alone.  \n\nWe had a salad with green beans and asparagus with a truffle vinaigrette.  This was great.  The pizza we ordered with a new york crust had sausage and eggplant on it.  It was very tasty.  All in all the food was probably a 5.\n\nThe missteps were with the service.  While the atmosphere of the restaurant was trendy and upscale, our service was rather casual.  Our server was kind of condescending and kept asking us \"are you sure?\" whenever we would order something.  We tried to get garlic on our pizza and she told us there was enough on top of it already, which there wasn't.   She also asked if we wanted the salad with the pizza, to which we replied yes.  After the pizza came out we still had no salad and two different people had to come ask if we ordered a salad.  It was just kind of odd.  Not necessarily bad, just a disconnect between the server training and the concept of the restaurant.\n\nI would go back for sure, I think my parents would like it, I just hope for a different server next time."

She never brought our coffee to go with our dessert and we had to ask 3 times for our to go boxes. Finally the busboy who walks by our table is more attentive than our waitress. Three tables came in after us with more settings than our table and they were served before us. Then, the manager (the short guy, couldn't tell you his name because he didn't take the time to come introduce himself to our table like he did EVERY other table) looks at me dead in the eye and never came and asked how our meal was our if everything was ok. I suppose its the short Italian man syndrome. We didn't have a man at our table so he didn't think we were big tippers. Yes, Italian men think like this!\n\nThen our waitress realized that she was so bad with her service and lack of attention that she proceeds to give us a 20% off coupon for the meal but when we get to register it was expired. WTH! \n\n(Oh and waitstaff, please do not tell your customers that you are working two jobs and have given your notice at this location and its too hard to memorize the menu). NOT GOOD! Stick to one job if two is too much for you to handle. There are plenty of waitstaff that need income and would appreciate memorizing the menu SINCE ITS THEIR JOB!

The pepperoni was thick and small and full of flavor. If I based the review on pizza alone, it would get 5 stars, no doubt. So, What went wrong?\n \nI had to ask twice for sweetener for my iced tea. By the time I received the sweetener the ice had melted and I had a glass of room temperature tea. The BLT salad was just OK. The dressing, if there was any, had no flavor. The Gorgonzola cheese was the only thing giving this salad any flavor. Not a big fan. But, Dom's isn't known for the salads, so I could forgive. The crispy garlic bread was good and it was crispy. Only 4 bucks so we definitely liked that. We also ordered a cannoli, imagine my surprise when it wasn't an authentic cannoli. It was not made with ricotta cheese. I'm guessing mascarpone. Whatever it was, it was disappointing. No hint of citrus, not enough chocolate chips. But, I will say this, for a fake cannoli, it was a good fake.\n\nWhat really cost them 2 stars was the restaurant itself. It's dark inside. So dark that I saw at least 5 different tables using the flashlight app on their phone to read the menu. And logistically, the restaurant is a nightmare. The amount of waitstaff whizzing by our tables was head spinning. So much so, that I had a headache by the time we left. The bar is on the right side of the restaurant. The kitchen along the back wall. The drink station for the wait staff is in the very front right corner. The staff is constantly criss-crossing the restaurant. It is nonstop. Downright hectic. restaurant is in a storefront in a strip mall so, it's not the most ideal space and they definitely deserve a better, bigger space. And if you have to wait for a table, the wait area is so small people are literally standing next to you watching you eat. I felt as though we should have offered them a slice of pizza! I hope they move, because we decided we won't return, at least not during peak hours. It's why too overcrowded servers! I told my husband next time we can order the pizza to go and eat it in our car in the parking lot! We don't live close to Dom's and I think the pizza would lose that crispness if we took it all the way home. \nSo if you want a great, NY style pizza, this is the place to go and if you want to feel like you're eating it in the middle of Times Square, then you'll really love it. Looking for a nice, relaxing meal? Look somewhere else."

More like the splintered sects that quibble over details until they decide on something real fun, like The Inquisition.\n\nPizza is that kind of religion.\n\nSome sects have thick necked men who watch football, shovel their own snow, and know at least two good rumors about Jimmy Hoffa. That sect likes their pizza crust thick and their toppings simple and traditional.\n\nOther sects have devotees who wear sandals, vacuum sand out of the floorboard of their car, and know someone who has been hand cuffed for protecting a tree. That sect likes their pizza thin and topped with exotics like pineapple, bar-b-que sauce and tofu.\n\nFinally there is a sect with loud men and women who watch baseball, don't own a car (or a license), and can remember when riding the subway was dangerous, but necessary. That sect likes their pizza crust thin and acrobatically thrown, spun, stretched and worked until ready. Their sauce takes time to get right, and their toppings are traditional.\n\nDom DeMarco's wants to be in that third sect, and I do mean 'wants'. \n\nDon't get me wrong, there's a lot good here. The bartender was hustling when we were there, on the floor, checking drinks and bringing refills. Service was decent too, we didn't wait long and our order was correct.\n\nBut the whole reason you pay $20 for a medium pizza is that you believe that they worship the same pizza deity that you do, and they will follow the scriptures and get it right. That, sadly was not the case.\n\nLets talk about crust for a moment. How can you tell if its good? Lets not start at the wide end that everyone looks at first. No, I want you to look at the pointy end. Flip up that point and touch the crust. It shouldn't be soggy and spongey. DeMarco's was like overcooked lasagna noodles at the tip.\n\nFor the sauce, it should be tasty and tangy on its own. If it gets most of its flavor from the other toppings, its too weak. If its over seasoned, the toppings will get lost. DeMarco's was Meh flavored.\n\nNow the toppings, simple is better here. Good quality, uncomplicated and covering the pizza in an even layer. DeMarco's did ok with this one.\n\nNow, does this review mean that you will not like their food? Maybe not. If you only worship pizza on special occasions and holidays. If you are non-denominational and ok as long as the toppings are tasty, if your standards allow for a bit of error and your still willing to pay top dollar for close enough, come on by.\n\nBut, if you know what you like, and have an opinion on Mets vs Yankees...this may not meet your standards."

However, our server was nice enough to let us know that the pizzas are large - even the smallest size - and that one would probably suffice. I definitely appreciate his honesty instead of trying to push more pizzas on us. \nThe pizza it self was really good. We got the truffle pizza! They were generous with the toppings and the pizza crust had the right balance of crispy and chewiness to it! \nThe restaurant is bigger than we expected. We were seated at a high top table near the bar area, where there were numerous TVs (there actually are TVs throughout the entire restaurant) and it sort of had a sports bar feel. I've been to DiFaras in Brooklyn and was sort of expecting that type of feel. This is nothing like that in terms of ambiance."

We'd be regulars if it was closer.\n\nDom DeMarco's is unassuming from the outside; located in a Summerlin strip mall.  But the interior is done in warm woods and cozy, comfortable booths.  There is also a terrific patio, which is large and comfortable.  Equipped with a 2-sided fireplace and heaters as well as a canopy to keep out the hot sun, so it's good in both cool and warm weather.  The bar Happy Hour specials are also good on the patio.\n\nChicken Wings with buffalo sauce and house made Bleu Cheese: $13.00 /10 wings.  These meaty wings are finished on the grill to give them a great crispy exterior.  Definitely some of my favorite wings in Vegas.\n\nDi Fara Brooklyn style Sicilian pizza: $26.00.  This is by far my favorite square pizza in town.  It has hand cut pepperoni, mozzarella, grana padano cheese, and fresh basil.  The edges are also slightly charred, giving it a traditional taste.  The golden crust is so light and buttery and the sauce has such a great acidity.  All the components make for a fantastic package.  I do consider it a fork and knife pizza though."

Finally, 45 mins later, I asked the bartender where my food was!  The host clearly didn't remember that I said I would be at the bar because my food was sitting on a table and was not very hot when I got it.  Also, when I got home saw that the pizza I ordered (white truffle thin crust) was not the pizza I received (white truffle deep dish). Spinach salad and pizza are good, but the service is the reason I will not be back.\nUpdated - June 30\nAfter my initial experience and post, the general manager contacted me and invited me to return.  I like that he actually read about my experience and took the time to contact me.  I finally had a chance to return last week, and it was a completely different experience.  This time my boyfriend and I ate there (I was actually a little nervous to try to do takeout again).  Fernando was our server and he was friendly, attentive and personable.  We had the meatball appetizer, which was delicious, a salad, and pizza.  The pizza took a little longer than expected, but both a manager and Fernando came to let us know the one they made wasn't up to their standards and they would be making us a new one.  My boyfriend loved this place so much, we went back a few days later and had a few beers and ordered takeout from the bar.  Was again a great experience and Dom Demarco's has earned back my business!"

Everyone here is super nice.\n\nI was a bit iffy about ordering a pie to go, but it wasn't for me so who cares right?  Who am I kidding? I know I'm going to have one regardless.\n\nOf course i saw meatballs on the menu, and if you know me I'm a sucker for protein in all form and shape.  The bartender told me that they do not use bread crumbs in their recipes.  Even better, and man, were they worth it! Each bite were divine, and the marinara sauce was a great addition.  They give you plenty.  I had enough sauce to make sure each bite was coated for maximum decomposition.  Heck, it was even a dipping sauce for my pizza crust! Zing! Choice of lollipop or in a bread roll.  \n\nOur Big Apple Pizza aka meat lovers came NY style thin crust..  It had Ham, Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball, and lots of Basil.  Sooo good that i wanted another slice, but fortunately for me it was all gone before i could do myself anymore harm.  The pie was a bit soggy in the middle, but i think it was due to all the hearty toppings.  Then again it could have been more mushy if it wasn't for the  neo mesh (aka honeycomb) underneath the pizza.  The mat helps fend off the condensation, so our happy pizza kept us happy.  Kudos to Dom DeMarco's for being thoughtful.\n\nWhile waiting for my order i had a good convo with the bartender.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu and even gave me a little extra 411 about the place.  Like how they use ingredients imported from Italy, and how they use a water filtration system that mimic the water in NY.  Just some of the measure they use to mirror their pizza in NY which happen to be voted #1 by Zagat. \n\nVerdict: My new Pizza Spot!"

I had the spaghetti and meatballs which the sauce was way too acidic. Meatballs were OK...nothing great but I was starving so I ate them. Also ordered the Picatta, but the waiter brought something else and didn't know that it wasn't the Picatta. We just canceled the order because it already took more than 30 minutes after the salad came out for the food, which is unacceptable for this kind of place. Our waiter was not well trained, when he saw we were sharing the spaghetti he didn't even offer to bring fresh plates to make it easier to share. Supposedly this chain originated from a location in Brooklyn, but having lived many years in Brooklyn I've never heard of it so it can't be that great. I'm sure many people like this place, but most likely because they don't know any better."

We ordered (2) NY thin pizzas with specific toppings, (1) large & (1) medium. The 1st was served in a timely manor, however the 2nd took 25 minutes extra to be served. This borders on beyond acceptable.\n\nThe shift manager came out and ask how we we were doing about 15 minutes into the wait. Seemed pretty obvious there was an issue since the 1st pizza was half eaten (buy one guest) while the other guests were still waiting to see a pizza on the empty pizza stand.\n\nWhen the 2nd pizza arrived, slightly burnt, not much of a apology was offered. When the bill was presented, I suggested a discount should be in order but the waitress was not forthcoming. At a minimum, the shift manager should have become involved. \n\nThe restaurant was at less than 25% capacity at 6:00 PM on a Thursday, so it was not a logistical issue.  \n\nIn closing, while the pizza was good, the overall experience was pretty abysmal. My recommendation is good for take out but not eat in."

This place took over the old Atlanta Bread Company and I really dig what they did with the space.  Very nice bar and restaurant with nice outdoor seating.  \n\nPizza comes in two styles - New York thin crust and square cut thick crust baked in a cast iron pan.  I'm not a big fan of thick crust so we went for the thin crust white truffle pizza.  Very tasty.  $22 for a large but the pizza was huge!  We are still eating it for lunch three days later.  And so greasy, it left puddles of oil on our plates (and still does).  I got over it after a few bites.  Also, they put a ton of parmesan on the pizza.  You'd be crazy to ask for extra.  Generous with the toppings and cheese.  They have a variety of sizes, small, large, half, and full, for your dining needs.\n\nWe also tried the Mediterranean salad, which was also very good.  Romaine lettuce, feta, kalamata olives, garbanzo beans, onions, cucumber, and their house vinaigrette, which is like a Greek dressing.  Very fresh and tasty.\n\nGood beer selection.  Guinness, Stone, Mirror Pond.  They were out of the Deschutes but hopefully they will bring it back.  \n\nThey have cute little pizza shaped vibrating pagers if you have to wait for a table. If you want to avoid the crowds, your best bet is to come during the day on a weekend around 3pm or so.  Great service.  Looking forward to more visits."

We chose the New York style for both. The service was great and the pizza guy personally delivered our pizzas to us, and even served us our first slices which was a very nice gesture.\n\nYou know how you first taste something and you have that moment of silence, and your eyes roll to the back of your head like the Exorcist because its SO DAMN GOOD?\nI didn't have that moment in any of our pizzas. Not the White, not the Truffle, and Not the legendary Di Fara....TASTE is everything, and what we tasted was an overkill on garlic...You can never have too much garlic, right? that's what I thought, but it got so overbearing, we wanted to like the White/Truffle pizza, but it turned out to be disappointing.The Di Fara was okay, but nothing legendary about it IMO, and I'm not such a fan of the pepperoni used here(personal preference)\n\nThey use New York water in their dough!..Yeah, yeah, yeah...the crust got hard and tough as it cooled.

This place was not good, and actually, it was borderline terrible when you consider the prices they charge. I'm willing to pay for a product when there is value and quality that justifies the pice. Dom DeMarco's does not justify the cost that one pays to eat here. Everything was overpriced form their french fries, to their baby cow meatballs to their pizza. The sicilian was terrible. It was greasy spongy, and only semi thick dough. I will speak on behalf of my fellow Sicilian descendants to say that this was no Sicilian pizza. This place bugs me slightly more than the pretentious pizzerias like Due Forni and those styled \"pizzerias\" because I can actually sort of enjoy the pizza at those uppity places. \n\nThe service was even rough here. We had to beg and repeat asking for everything we needed. But the servers were actually friendly and pleasant people, just slow as molasses. I don't even know why I'm not giving this place a 1 star, it's probably because I'm too nice of a person by nature. Be warned if you actually have experience with good pizza and don't like spending a ton for food that is just sub par. Ok, my venting is done here. Sorry Dom DeMarco, you broke my pizza-loving heart and charged me up the wazoo to do it."

I had the Tomato & Burrata, which is their version of Caprese salad.  Instead of sliced tomatoes, sliced mozzarella, and basil, this had a circle of quartered small tomatoes around a big ball of fresh mozzarella.  The plate was also seasoned with olive oil and basalmic.  The mozzarella was absolutely the freshest I've ever had, but our server told us that it was not made in the restaurant.  The pizza was excellent, great cheese, great sauce, great crust.  Next time we're back in Las Vegas, I want to try the Baked Ziti and Brooklyn Chicken."

Plus a Testamatta Vermintino by the glass and by the bottle which is quite nice.

I walked in about 10 to 5 and I was immediately greeted and welcomed. My server quickly introduced herself to me and brought me a water. I was surprised that ice wasn't in the glass.  So the server told me that they were running a happy hour special and it probably wouldn't make sense to use my certificate because then they would have to charge me full price. Nonetheless, I said, let's see how things play out. I ordered some pizza and wings.  The wings arrived fairly quickly and they tasted burnt. I clearly saw grill marks on the wings. I think they put the wings in the deep fryer and then put them on a grill.  The server checked back with me pretty quickly. She said that the pizza will be arriving soon. Several minutes later, I watched her bring the pizza towards my table and then she did a 180 and went to the kitchen. A few minutes after that, she came back and apologized to me. She noticed that the pizza was prepared incorrectly and said that they will need to make it again. A free salad was offered. I elected to take the garden salad. The salad consisted of lettuce, tomatoes, and nothing else! The vinaigrette dressing was very good, however. The pizza finally arrived and it was ok, at best. The pizza tasted very thick and the crust wasn't soft like a good New York pizza.  The server checked back with me and I watched her refill my drink which was completely watered down already.  The server should have brought me a fresh cup of soda instead of adding more soda to a watered down mess!  The food runners and bussers were helpful and offered to box up my food as I finished.  Finally it was time for the bill. I was shocked that my meal was still over $25 even with the discount. I dined alone and I didn't anticipate that I would be spending over $35 ($10 tip) for pizza and wings.  Remember, the salad was provided to me for free.  Too bad that I wasn't impressed with this place, I would have loved to find a nice neighborhood pizza joint, but I will stick to North End or Verrazano Pizza.\n\nOne thing I need to really point out, the staff was extremely friendly."

I got there late, natch, so all I was left with was a very cold Sicilian slice.  And I was blown away.\n\nWe were impressed with the restaurant's decor - modern, upscale, but the seating was uncomfortable for me.  Nice-looking fake leather webbed chairs and the upholstered booths had me sitting way too low for short little me, so I felt like a dog lapping out of a bowl.  (I did try one of the few straight-backed chairs before I left, just for comparison purposes, and they were fine; if we go back, I'll insist on that).  The patio, with its big, glass-covered patio, looked awesome, but it was too cold for it to be up and running.\n\nOur waiter, Roberto, was completely unfriendly.  It's amazing how a friendly waiter can have an impact on my overall impression of a restaurant, and his demeanor definitely detracted.  In fact, I started a conversation in Spanish with a very friendly busboy, whose hometown in Mexico was my old home-away-from-home, and after a couple of minutes Roberto gave the busboy a curt and nasty signal that implied he needed to get his ass moving.  This kind of thing makes us feel like commodities, instead of valued customers.\n\nNow for the food:  I've never been a fan of Sicilian (square) pizza but, because of the previous experience, we ordered half a square Bella Napoli, with tomatoes, spinach, garlic, and EVOO.  I have to say I didn't enjoy it as much as the cold one from the other night, which may have had sausage (it was too dark to see what was on it).  This pizza was grease personified, and with the tomatoes dripping all over the place, it needed to be eaten with a knife and fork which, to a Native New Yorker, is a complete sacrilege.  And $17 for half a Sicilian pie is pricey.  (Note to management:  sharper knives are needed!).  Still, it was good, but needed a bit of red pepper to liven up the flavor.\n\nThe little touches are nice - the water bottles that sit on the table, the heavy plates made in France, the modern pizza tower (though it didn't work for me in my sunken-down seat).  \n\nIf it weren't for the ambience, I'd be giving this three stars.  But since my credo is \"You CAN eat the atmosphere,\" I've bumped it to four."

As always, the food was spectacular!\n\nBefore I get to the pizza, there are a few appetizers that also deserve praise. The Golden Calamari is wonderful. The breading is light, but crispy, and the squid is cooked exceptionally well. Also, Gram's Meatballs are some of the best meatballs I've ever had. The combination of the pork, the beef, and the veal, makes for an amazing flavor combination, and the tenderness is perfect.\n\nTHE PIZZA: The only way this pizza could be any better is if they fed it to me. The pizza at Dom DeMarco's is AMAZING. I have never once been disappointed. They have two different styles of crust, New York Style Thin and Square Cut Thick. Personally, I think the thick crust is better, but to each their own! My absolute favorite pizza is The Di Fara Special. Fresh basil, pepperoni, two different types of cheese, it's so simple, and yet it's so fucking delicious! The best part, is that the pizza is huge! It could easily feed a family of four and potentially have leftovers. Dom DeMarco's also does carry out if you feel like staying in for the evening. \n\nTHE VERDICT: Dom DeMarco's will always have a special place in my stomach. If you're craving pizza, you're doing yourself a diservice by ordering delivery. Make the journey, it's worth it, and your stomach will thank you for the days to come."

It was about 10 minutes before our drink order was taken and then almost 10 before we got our drinks (1 iced tea and a beer).  It was then another 10 before our order was taken. (The place was semi-busy but not slammed and I saw other servers just standing around at times) We started with the Eggplant Pizzette which were INCREDIBLE with tiny dollops of ricotta (4.5 stars).  We ordered the The Di Fara Special pizza (thin style).  The eggplant came within 20 minutes.  When we were finished a man came over and informed us that our pizza had looked over cooked so they started a new one (He looked to be the manager but never identified himself as such).  About  20 more minutes later the pizza was finally delivered to our table.  It was a great pizza-one of the best I have had in Vegas(4 stars) but given how long it took, it put a slight damper on the whole experience. ( It probably didn't help that the table next to us was seated with 3 very loud and pompous narcissistic  blow-hards that couldn't stop talking even long enough to eat their own food which seem to come out pretty quickly despite the fact that they were seated after us.) \n\nThe manager came to check on us 3x which was good intentions-wise but did little else to make up for the long wait and he responded with a \"fantastic\" in each of our interactions as though he was on automated response.  Almost 2 hours later we left with our bill-our waitress notified us that the manager had graciously removed the price of my iced tea (REALLY???).  Our waitress was very personable.\n\nThe decor and atmosphere are really nice-loved the outdoor patio- the music was a bit loud which made it hard to talk  at times.   We are wanting to give this place another chance because the food was good and all restaurants can have bad nights. .."

I wonder what they think about  DeMarcos in Vegas, which I think is supposed to be related to the famous DiFara's.  First of all let me say the wait staff at this place was great and they had Coke which I like.  I tried both types of crust with just cheese.  The thick short crust tasted like there might have been some rancid oil used and it had a burnt taste.  And the other New York style crust had very little watery sauce.  Imported tomatoes can be good but you have to do something about draining the liquid out or they will make the crust soggy.  Overall I would give this pizza a B-.  I am sure that DiFara's in New York is fantasic pizza, but this Vegas version didn't do it for me.  This pizza isn't even close to Metro or Grimaldi's. Nice atomosphere though and I am only about the pizza so they might have some other menu items to enjoy.  The Napoli crust was not good at all.  I even heard people complaining in the restaurant about the taste."

            "review": "I've eaten at Dom DeMarco's with friends and family on multiple occasions since they opened in Summerlin in early 2012.  The Summerlin restaurant is divided almost in half between a large bar area with bistro style seating on the right and more traditional table seating on the left.  The bar side opens up to a large outdoor patio and fire pit.  The left side has an open style kitchen in the back where you can see the chiefs throwing the pizza dough in the air as they work the dough.  \n\nThe restaurant does more than pizza and the menu, although not that large, offers a good variety of appetizers, salads and pasta dishes.  One of my favorite appetizers is the bruschetta trio ($9).  It comes with three pieces of garlic bread with one holding white beans, one with prosciutto and one with tomatoes, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  They go well with a glass of wine from their reasonably large wine list.  Other notables are the fried calamari ($10) and the antipasto plate containing, among other goodies, nice sharp pieces of parmesan reggiano cheese ($12). They even have an appetizer of just meatballs, however, while the quality is good, it is way overpriced for what you get ($11). The salads are huge, which seems to be a trend in restaurants these days.  If you get one, plan on sharing it or taking the rest home.  \n\nFor dinner, don't miss the pizza which comes in a thin (small $12) or thick crust (small $15).  You can start with plain cheese and add your own toppings or order from several suggested formulations.  If you go this later route, I recommend the white truffle pizza (small $15 and large $27).  This beauty comes with mushrooms, mozzarella, parmesan, lots of garlic and truffle oil.  It is delicious. Aside from the pizza, I'm also a fan of the prime rib sandwich ($14). They tell you that they only make a limited supply of prime rib daily and when it runs out, the sandwich is no longer available that day however, I've never had them tell me there wasn't any left. They serve it cold with a side of garlic fries and a horseradish aioli.  The meat melts in your mouth.  It would be perfect if they served it hot but that's why this sandwich also works well as a takeout item where you can heat it up at home.  \n\nThe desserts are the most disappointing menu items.  The tiramisu is small for the price and the cannoli taste like they are straight out of the freezer aisle of the nearest Costco.  Until they start to put the same attention into their desserts as they do with their food, I recommend you stick with a cup of coffee and have the dessert at home.\n\nThe atmosphere is lively and it can get crowded.  Even during the week, going there around 7:00 pm will require a wait for a table so plan ahead.  I give the restaurant four stars as they do a great job of bringing good quality Italian food to Summerlin."

We were there for an hour if not longer...\n\nI can go to a wolf gang puck restaurant in crystals for the same price!\n\nWe went 9/21 between 2:30p-4:00p\n\nSo if you're going to go, avoid that time!"

This pizza has crisp pepperoni that I suffer through the hand slapping as I try and pick them off the pizza.  BEWARE those, who like me -  love food, I find myself leaving in a food coma every time.\n\nSide note to all the OTHER pizza places out there - USE FRESH BASIL.\n\nTo avoid my freshman 15 flashbacks, I will order the Soho salad (mixed greens, grilled fennel and asparagus in a truffle vinaigrette) it's very light - you can add grilled chicken or shrimp and it's definitely enough to share.  My alternative is their Tomato and Burrata appetizer (cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil.)  It's drizzled with balsamic and as Rachel Ray would say EVOO.  (Ya sorry it's a weeknight and it's getting late.)\n\nAs this is one of the few non asian restaurants I'll bring my folks to - I have to tell you about their White Truffle pizza.  This sauce less pizza has mushrooms, mozzarella, parmesan, and garlic truffle oil.  My mom raved about this pizza for at least a month.  It's so good, she makes me order the large pizza so she can take home the leftovers.  So Chinese. \n\nFellow Yelpers will feel my pain as I try to understand why this pizza can be better than the billion other pizzerias around town.  It was so obvious - it's the fresh ingredients - but specifically for me it is all about the tomatoes they use.  Dom Demarco's uses imported fresh San Marzano tomatoes - think Roma Tomatoes times two - sweeter with less seeds and less acid.  And of course - FRESH BASIL.\n\nNow for you fellow alcoholics - the bar has a to die for pineapple drink infused with vodka overnight.  Um ya.  To boot they have 12 beers on draft and a wine menu that is a necessity for every Italian fare.   Need I say more..."

Person sat after us got served right away. Had to ask to get service. Someone came and took our drink order. It  took some time to get someone to take our order after that. In fact we never knew who our actual server was. Took forever to get our food, table the was sat after us got their food and was gone before we got ours. We had pizza which was just okay and my daughter had a cheese calzone that was awful.  She couldn't eat it is was so bad. I tried it and it was not good. \n\nWe never saw a server from the time we ordered until we had to ask for the bill. Never once asked for refills on drinks. Bus person was the only one who was helpful, clearing our plates and boxing the left over pizza. We finally had to flag down a manager so we could pay our bill, which he comped because we told him about our dinning issues."

The place was packed but the waitress helpfully reminded us we could purchase anything on the menu to go.  We asked for recommendations and she recommended the spaghetti and meat ball. She said it was the best meat ball ever.  We got that and a calzone because we were on a limited budget and the prices were very expensive for pasta.  Took it home and while the meat ball was not the best ever, it was pretty darn good.  However, the portion was disappointingly small for the price and the sauce was somewhat bland.  The calzone was very poor, almost empty inside.  Based on the price, I would not recommend adding this to your rotation but once in a while, it is an interesting experience."

It is a meat pizza with fresh basil. The fresh herb really added depth to the dish. We all were quite happy with our selection. Three slices were enough for the men of our group and the ladies ate 1-1.5 slices. \n\nFollowing our meal the executive chef came out and spoke to us for over 20 minutes. He was happy to discuss a possible cooking class. He was excited one of our group wanted to learn from him. Very kind."

They were generous with the aioli which was nice because some places I've been to lately are stingy with it. They give you more than enough for your fries. We then shared a 15th St. BLT salad ($10.00). It had butter leaf lettuce, avocado, cherry tomatoes, bacon with Gorgonzola dressing. The dressing was a little too bitter for me but the salad was good.\n\nWe ordered the Di Fara pizza ($26.00) it is pretty huge especially for just 2 people. Let's just say we had more than enough left overs for work. The sauce was sweet and zingy ...tasty! It came with pepperoni, fresh and aged mozzarella, grana padano(  Italy's most popular hard cheese), fresh Basil and extra virgin olive oil. It was delicious!  Demarco's really takes their crust seriously! In order to get their pizza to taste just like their pizza in New York at Di Fara's in Brooklyn they use all the same ingredients.  The waiter said they even bring in water from New York for their recipes. This shows how much they are dedicated to their food.  The proof is in their pizza!"

Funny, but we didn't reserve a table in the bar area for a birthday dinner.

When I arrived the table was all set and ready.  I met our waitress, Sara and ordered some appetizers and salads to begin.\n\nAppetizers: Bruschetta Trio, Golden Calamari & Dom's Fries.  The Bruschetta Trio is not a pretty dish.  The white bean flavor looks like brains.  The tomato balsamic looks like your standard bruschetta and the prosciutto flavor was a little unappealing too.  No one was impressed with this dish.  The calamari was well received as well as the fries.  The calamari appeared to have a good mix of ring & tentacle parts.\n\nSalads:  15th Street BLT and Mediterranean.  Everyone that tried the BLT said it was really good.  It had a nice blend of lettuce, bacon, cheese & dressing and was topped with 1/2 of an avocado.  Good comments about the Mediterranean salad too.  \n\nPizza:  Big Apple, both thin crust and Sicilian style, White Truffle and Artichoke.  The feedback on the Big Apple was that the toppings to cheese to sauce to crust ratio was good.  You had a variety of flavors and textures in every bite.  Our group did favor the Sicilian style crust over the thin.  The artichoke pizza looked nicely balanced too.  The artichokes were nice and big and looked fresh, never frozen.  The abundant amount of fresh basil was a plus too.  The favorite was the White Truffle.  Our group reported a good meaty texture from the mushrooms with a hint of truffle as opposed to the flavor overpowering the rest of the pizza.  \n\nWe also tried the Tiramisu for dessert.  It was okay.  A couple people wanted just a bite of something sweet to cut through the richness, which this accomplished but we did not finish the dessert.  \n\nThe bar has a large selection and we ordered a variety of beverages.  I had the J. Lohr Riverstone Chardonnay and really liked it.  It was not oakey, buttery or sweet.  It was a crisp refeshing white.  It was especially good to me because it was chilled properly.  I do not appreciate warm white wine.  The rest of the group enjoyed their choices too.  \n\nDom DeMarco's is a little expensive if you are expecting a meal of pizza and drinks but the quality supports the price and the staff is friendly and accommodating.  \n\nOn a different note, thank you for choosing this location rather than a couple blocks down the street.  You can actually pull into your parking lot, find a space and get into the restaurant without playing Frogger with the cars and pedestrians."

We ordered the calamari and garlic knots as appetizers and those alone filled us up pretty quick. Both dishes were delish and the garlic knots are the best I've had in the Valley so far. We also ordered the Lg Round Big Apple pizza. I substituted the italian sausage for bacon since it already had meatballs so I didn't feel like it was a big sacrifice, plus i dislike sausage on my pizza. it was soo good and I was overly filled after two slices. \n\nOur server Natalia was very friendly and attentive. She brought my kid a ball of dough to play with after we had sat down which was a creative idea. She had a ball (no pun intended) with the dough. Prices weren't that bad and the atmosphere was very laid back with tvs visible from anywhere you sat in the main dinning room."

Yesterday on the way home from a play at UNLV, I had this place in mind for quick take out before going to the evening play for which we had tickets.\n\nI had looked at the menu online and had already decided I'd get a square (thick crust) white pizza with some toppings I chose.  They've changed their menus and I ask the greeter if I could still get the white pizza.  She told me too different kinds I could get and I opted for the white truffle with mushrooms.\n\nI agree with Nelson Q. that there was so much garlic that it hid the truffle flavor.  The pizza was very good nonetheless.  There was a lot of garlic and there were many mushrooms.  My only negative comment would be that some areas of the pizza were baked to a black crust rather than an evenly done one.\n\nService was pretty good.  I waited about 15 minutes for it to be ready.  The greeter asked me if I'd like some water while I was waiting--a nice touch.\n\nI almost wished that my wife was with me so we could have stayed there and eaten in their patio area with just enough shrubs and trees to make Hualapai Commons and the cars almost disappear.  Instead, I got my hands greasy and salty at the kitchen table. \n\nI also long for the menu at pizza places where you have the blank canvas and get your white pizza with toppings x, y, and z.  You can still do that some places but it seems to be a disappearing thing at the more upscale places."

I had the sausage and beans as an appetizer to start.  the beans were very good but the sausage left a lot to be desired.  it lacked seasoning and juiciness.  I prefer a spicier sausage and perhaps one that is either cooked to order or has a higher fat content.  we also shared the chicken sandwich Inot my choice).  it was a heavily breaded boneless breast stuffed in a big loaf of bread.  it felt like a bowling ball in the stomach after eating half of it.  the second trip I tried the pizza.  we went with the house special.  a thick square pizza with hand cut pepperoni. it was good but I had huge expectations.  it was a little salty and a little under-cooked.  on some level it reminded me of BJ's thick crust pizza but that's a little too harsh a criticism.  i'll try it one more time before my final verdict.  service was good both visits and the beer is cold.\n\nok, followed up after a long absence.  no more.  spent over $20 for a 12 inch pepperoni pizza.  it's too salty, the cheese isn't a great quality, the tomatoes are completely forgettable and the crust is indistinguishable from many other thick crust pizzas."

After the news of Obama being in town and ordering from here, I was curious and had to try it out.\n\nWe are big fans of Northside Nathan's and Metro Pizza, so we felt it was going to take a lot to impress us.\n\nOn the first visit, a couple of coworkers and I trekked down during lunch on a Friday.   Definitely a little more of a uppity scene than we usually go to for lunch (it's not really \"uppity\" but when in Summerlin, its just the way everyone pretends to be.)\n\nWe were seated quickly, we got the typical waiter-in-a-rush treatment.  We got the Sicilian Style for lunch and it took a bit to get to the table, but it arrived and it was good.  I would place it somewhere between Good to Really Good, but not great.   A little too \"saucy\" and not as cheesy as I'd like, but nonetheless I left satisfied.\n\nSo on Saturday, I decided to take the family down for lunch.  My older two boys being typical teenagers never turn down pizza, so how could we go wrong?\n\nDespite a fairly slow crowd, it took forever to get us seated.  We kept being told by the hostess that despite the fact that we see some tables we could get our party of six to by combining smaller side-by-side tables, they were about to be having a shift change and needed to wait and see for some reason.  So we waited...and waited.  I didn't mind.  But everyone was getting grumpy and hungry.\n\nEventually we were seated at table meant for a party of four.  When our two pizzas arrived, there was barely room on the table.  We decided to also try one of the thing crust cheese pizzas which was MUCH better than the Sicilian style.  Overall, the family was unimpressed and understandably so.  On this day, the Sicilian seemed overloaded with even more sauce and even my least-picky child wanted none of it.\n\nMy first visit was a four star.  My second visit was a two star.  So I'll meet in the middle with three."

I had the chance to check Dom DeMarcos out for an early dinner recently and will surely be spending lots of time there!\n\nWe were greeted by a very friendly hostess who greeted us and walked us in.  Great first impression!\n\nMy girlfriend and I sat at the bar.  While I am not drinking alcohol, I am very comfortable in a bar scene and this bar environment was very comfortable.  Ample seating (don't get me wrong, the actual restaurant area was nice as well, but I'm a former barfly so we opted for the bar) and a nice bar layout with a few tv screens and sports.  I can't comment on cocktails/wine but my friend seemed happy with her beverages.  My soda water was impeccable.  \n\nWe asked the bartender for recommendations on food and he did not steer us wrong.  He suggested the meatballs, eggplant pizzettes or any of the pizzas.  We decided on the eggplant pizzettes which were amazing!!!  They are breaded eggplant with a dollop of whipped ricotta on top and delicious red sauce.  Sean, the bartender, made sure to order us more sauce as we clearly enjoyed it.  \n\nWe followed that with the 15th Street BLT Salad.  Very tasty.  Think of a BLT without the bread and made into a salad.  Deeeeelicious!  \n\nLastly was the pizza.  We were in the mood for some meat so we ordered the Big Apple with sausage, pepperoni, ham and meatballs.  We ordered a small and could only eat a piece each...yahoo for leftovers!!!  Luckily, the bartender warned us ahead of time that a small would be \"plenty\" for two ladies of our stature.  What a charming flatterer!  \n\nDuring small talk with another bartender, we learned that another one of the hostesses had been awarded most attractive restaurant hostess of Las Vegas or Summerlin (I don't recall which she said.)  I have a feeling it wasn't based solely on looks...not to suggest that the staff there isn't very good looking, but everybody seemed to be very genuine, kind hearted people, so I think the combo of being good looking AND kind hearted had something to do with it.  Good for her!    \n\nDom de Marco's has a very pleasant, casual vibe with a wonderful staff.  From the greeter to the awesome bartender Sean, and the rockin' New York style grub, I will certainly be back.  \n\nPS...if I ever hit the booze again, I'll have Sean make the drink and I'll review his pouring techniques!"

You can get either NY style thin round or a square which is a bit thicker like a pan pizza (not quite as thick as deepdish). We got the square and it was a crispy delicious crust. I love that the meats had a light sear but that the sausage slices got crispy good. My problem with most thicker pizzas is not enough sauce and their ratio was ideal and the marinara is solid. I'm a sucker for fresh basil and I love that they put ribbons of that on top. \n\nService was constant, but unobtrusive.

I will gladly pay good money for the full experience of a marked up bottle of wine, an appetizer, a pizza pie, and if my server isn't trying bum rush me for camping out at their table, I will even order dessert and coffee.  And that is just what I did the other night in the company of my Vegas dining buddy/fellow foodie, my mom.\n\nShe's a regular here whereas I was a virgin.  I had heard about this place a year ago when President Obama was in town doing his campaigning bit.  Not only did the Element at 215 and Town Center get a shout out, but Dom DeMarco got some publicity since the prez ordered 12 pizzas plus a bunch of cannolis.  I wanted to check it out immediately.  But, our usual Friday night pizza is limited to Little Caesars thanks in part to my young children, who have underdeveloped taste buds and young tummies to withstand the heaping gas those $5 pizzas create.  Anytime I wanted to go outside of the Little Caesar spectrum, I got attitude.  That and Dom DeMarcos isn't exactly in my neighborhood, so out of sight, out of mind.  I would eventually get around to trying out Dom De Marco and I finally did.  I went crazy, out of my usual routine of Friday night pizza by having pizza on a Tuesday!  Ooh!  I was living dangerously and it was worth it!\n\nWe started off with the calamari.  It was breaded to perfection and tasty.  My only complaint is that shortly after we were noshing on the app, we got our main events.  It's a true pet peeve of my husband's and I can see why.  However, we did order everything at the same time and didn't specify space between courses.  I let it slide, despite the fact our 2 seat high-top ran out of room.  Somehow, the affable server and his runner made it work, piling up our food on the table.  Yes, all of that food was for just us two: my mom ordered linguine and clams AND a half Di Fara Special for me to try and I ordered the half Artichoke thin crust.  Let the games begin.\n\nThe Di Fara Special is their signature square cut thick crust pizza, topped with small, hand cut pepperoni, mozzarella, basil and extra virgin olive oil.  I personally don't care for thick crust pizza, but I absolutely LOVED the taste of this crust.  It wasn't too doughy or dense.  The crust was golden crisp and just the right amount of thickness. The toppings were cooked to perfection and simple.  Quite often I find that simple is best.  \n\nI dug into my thin crust artichoke delight and it too did not disappoint.  I love a good New York thin crust pizza and this one was perfect in terms of the crust and toppings which were basic red sauce, mozza, basil, grana pandano, EVOO and of course, a generous helping of artichoke hearts.  But not too generous as to overwhelm or weigh down the crust or drench it.  There is nothing worse than a thin crust drenched, leaving it soggy.  The crust was the perfect texture and gave me a good crisp once I bit into it.  With my pinot noir and my mom with her malbec, we enjoyed each bite of our food.\n\nHaving boxed up the remaining slices of our respective pies split two ways (she took some of my pizza, I took some of hers), mom and I decided to dare go there with dessert and coffee.  We each had a cup of the hyped \"Best Coffee in LA\" (still don't understand what that meant, even after I asked our sweet energetic server) and split a piece of the 7-layer carrot cake.  The carrot cake was topped with white chocolate shavings and decorated with pecans.  I need not say anything more except one word: OUTSTANDING.  Even the \"LA coffee\" didn't disappoint - smooth and dark and completely complimented our dessert.\n\nTo wrap up: Dom De Marco is a hit in my book and a new favorite.  I will definitely be back, bringing my husband for a date night and/or bringing some girlfriends for a girls night when we're all feeling the need for good pizza and vino.  Oh I will be back for sure."

I wish I could use swear words in this review because I REALLY want to get my point across: THIS IS AMAZING PIZZA!!!\n\nMy friends and I came here after hitting the Brew fest all day to sop up the alcohol with PIZZA and CARBS. Yum. \n\nIt was my first time here. It was about 9:00 on a Saturday night. We didn't have to wait. AWESOME. The patio looked (and sounded) intriguing because there were a lot of people out there and it seemed like there was an awesome party going on. But, we had been outside in the cold all day so we opted to sit inside. \n\nWe ordered the 15th Street BLT salad to share and we stared at the pizza options for a good 15 minutes before we finally decided to settle on the DI FARA SPECIAL.\n\nBLT salad came out really quickly and it had an entire avocado on top of it. I love avocado. Very fresh and simple but with great flavors: the bacon really complimented the cheese flavor of the dressing. \n\nThe DI FARA turned out to be an amazing decision. When we ordered it, the waitress asked if we wanted the smaller version. We said no and upon eating my first bite, I was very happy we got so much of it because I was already excited to eat it cold! \n\nThe pizza was deep dish (I'm not sure if you can get NY style if you ask for it?). The crust was flaky and soft but crunchy and almost had a buttery flavor to it. It was heavenly. The sauce is on-another-planet-good and the pepperoni reminded me of Grimaldi's pepperoni (but smaller). Very authentic and meaty. The cheese was wonderful and balanced the flavors of the sauce and crust perfectly. I don't think I could have imagined a better deep dish pizza, honestly. \n\nSome might say $26 is a lot for pizza, but I don't. This pizza was huge. I only ate 2 pieces and probably should have stopped after 1.5 but literally ate past \"full\" because of how good it was. The 3 of us ate about half of the pizza and I was MORE THAN HAPPY to take it home and have another 2-3 days of left over pizza! :) \n\nOh, and our server was wonderful and friendly and kept our drinks full all night! \n\nI can't wait to come back and try their other pizzas!!!"

There is a choice listed for half salad or full and a different price for adding chicken for half or full.   However, if you order the half salad and the half salad portion you will be charged for the full size.  When this happened the waitress explained that they had changed it  but not on the menu.   Of course they gave us the price but only after a discussion with the manager. Apparently they are not aware that is it is listed on the menu at a price they are required by law to charge you no more than that.   If prices change, they must update the menu to reflect it.  The lunch specials are very good with a nice variety.   They do need to select happy hour days and times and stick to it."

Just having moved to Vegas, I tried Dom DeMarco's as it is just down the hill from me and have been back 4 more times in the last month.\n\nThe pizza is real New York style Napolitana pizza, with real cheese. I was in pizza heaven from the first bite. Wow, what a treat after Los Angeles imitation pizza. Now the meatballs are to die for and maybe the absolute best I have ever had in my life. Tasty,  light and soaking in a fabulous marinara sauce. Another favorite is the 15th St. BLT salad with an incredible blue cheese dressing. \n\nThis is the real deal folks and as good as it gets.

To make things worse the waiter gives us $15 off, then when the owner finds out, he takes it off charging us full price.

Our HR plans everything and last year it was a success, but this year not so much due to the poor communication of the staff. \n\nPrior to arriving to the restaurant the company had already emailed the chef what our orders were to be, but there was some confusion and two waiters came by to ask orders and write down what each person was going to eat. \n\nOur appetizers came out fast and the setting was nice and that's where the two stars came from. When our food came out that's when everything was messed up. They all of a sudden ran out of prime rib which we ordered 20 orders of! Then they forgot 6 of us! So 6 people were sitting without food while everyone else ate for at least 30 minutes after everyone else received food. Once most of everyone was served the waiters neglected to check on us to see if everyone was served. They left 1 person out and that person waited 1 hour to eat after everyone else was almost already finished. The staff was not accommodating at all either as we had kept asking what other choices do we have if you ran out of the food we has pre-ordered. They said we had no choice but to stick with their chicken Alfredo pasta which was mediocre. \n\nIt was not a very good first experience coming to this restaurant and I'm not sure I would willingly come here on my own or tell friends about this place."

Ordered three pizzas for a party of 8 and several drinks.  Had to go to the bar to retrieve the drinks.  Had to get silverware and plates from other empty tables.  Many of the plates were dirty.  We waited an hour and 15 minutes for the pizzas.  The server had nothing but excuses...\"We are very busy,\"  \"Lots of carry-out orders,\" etc.  We are not there for excuses.  We go to a restaurant with the expectation of being served.  We were not planning on serving ourselves.  Finally, after inquiring several times, the salty, dry pizzas arrived.  Talking about awful.  The earlier comment on Yelp about it tasting like a frozen pizza was very accurate.  We stated our dissatisfaction with the waiter. He just  apologized and made further excuses.   Inquired to speak to a manager and was then offered a free dessert.  Expected the manager to come over and discuss the situation.  When we finally spoke with the \"so-called\" manager (Joey) he became confrontational, angry, and rude.  He was not only yelling at the top of his lungs at us; he became belligerent and threatening.  What an unprofessional employee to represent an establishment that is suppose to be serving the public.  We will never recommend or eat at this establishment again.  There are many great pizza places in the area with professional staff and management.

The entree salmon was good, but undercooked for me (they didn't ask how we wanted it cooked, and it came out QUITE gelatinous in the middle - like think unset jello), and the asparagus that came with the salmon was just insufficient in volume. A mostly empty plate with ill-cooked fish is never going to be worth more than $5, and this was priced substantially above that. \n\nThe dining area was nice, and the appeared to have an outdoor patio in front with heat lamps for cool and dry days.

The server arrived to our table in a timely manner however she felt compelled to rush away to attend to other tables. No worries, it's only my first time and I might have some questions about this supposedly glorious pizza. I show her my Yelp check in for our free order of garlic knots. Damn it feels good to be a Yelper!\n\nAfter my inquisitive mind relinquished all my questions on this poor server I decided on the Mushroom & White Truffle pizza with 1/2 homemade sausage. The kids got a cheese pizza and some dough to play with while we waited. That is an AWESOME Idea because the kids were quiet the entire meal.  I disliked the $3 each kids lemonade they only drink a few sips.  I decided to try the house beer Dom Demarco IPA which was ok. I did notice they have a decent draft and craft beer selection featuring both local and regional brews.\n\nThe pizza came out in timely manner but was luke warm when it arrived at the table.  The kids pizza however was bubbling hot.  Like mix up in the food prep if you ask me.  I would say make the kids pizza first and the parents pizza last to keep it HOT! and let the kids cool down as to not burn them.  No worries because pizza is one of those foods that can be enjoyed at any temp and even left out over night on the stove and consumed the next day.  \n\nThe flavor of the White truffle was very subtle.  The white sauce was also very mild which gave the pizza a well balanced taste.  The pizza crust and dough was of good density and not to thick on the thin crust pizza which gave each slice a nice crunch and sturdy enough to hold the toppings in tact.  \n\nNext time I will try the deep dish to see how that style of fairs against some of the great pizza places I have eaten in Chicago. As of now, I'm still seeking the best Pizza Place in Vegas."

Unfortunately I've deducted stars for the service.   We sit, party of 5 at about 9:45pm, I ordered a salad and the guys with me went out to look at one of their new cars.  They sat back down at 10:00, our waitress came over a few minutes later and told us that it is now happy hour and there is only pizza on the menu at Half off prices.  Cool.  Not what made us come in, but definitely sounded like a plus for being here at that time.  So we order 2 large pizzas.  After our meal our waitress drops off the bill and rushes away.  We see that the pizzas are full price.  We wait about 5 minutes and she doesn't return, so I get up to find her to ask about the happy hour prices she quoted us.  Her response is that we came in before 10 so we don't get the prices.  I asked her why she told us we'd get happy hour prices if we wouldn't, and she had no explanation, simply \"sorry but that's how it is\".  The cost is not the issue, neither are the \"rules\" of happy hour.  The issue is the lack of customer service skills and our waitress' neglect of an explanation and apology for her mistake.  Now that I think about it, I should've addressed her manager on the spot because to me, business is business, but I didn't feel like wasting the time and headache over $24.  But I'm thinking that l will give the store manager a call just to let him know that due to poor customer service we will never return, and I will be sure to recommend people do not waste their money here when you can get better pizza and excellent customer service 1 mile away at Grimaldi's!"

Loved he salad. But what I really enjoyed was the crust: thin and slightly chewy. I was told by the waitress that they used distilled water for drinking and making the dough. Perhaps that is the secret just like how Grimaldi's does it? Speaking of Grimaldi's, which my wife likes more, I prefer the chewy crust unlike Grimaldi's thin, cracker-like crust.

I could easily eat it everyday!! And, we got it on a thick crust which was phenominal.\n\n2) The Margherita which was very basil-y...so I LOVED it. I would, also, go back just for this pizza.\n\n3) The Big Apple which is sort of their answer to a meat lovers...ham, pepperoni, sausage, and I think meatball. I didn't really eat this one, but I did try a piece of the pepperoni itself which was great & there was none left over of this one so it was obviously good.\n\n4) The White Truffle. This one had truffle oil, mushrooms, garlic...I am not a mushroom or a truffle oil fan so I skipped this one.\n\nI, also, got a cannoli to go. And, it was fantastic.\n\nThis place will probably be our new pizza place...and I will probably start telling people it is the best pizza in Vegas.\n\nYou should definitely check them out."

I didn't think that finding a decent lunch special would be such a hard quest in this restaurant-saturated city, but it is. Dom DeMarco's serves up some tasty lunch specials at killer prices in a cozy setting.\n\nLunch specials are all around $10 and you have a solid selection of choices from pizza, classic spaghetti and meatballs, side salads, caesar salad, sliders and some other pasta dishes. What I like about Dom DeMarco's is that the portions aren't offensively huge. I got the caesar salad and spaghetti and meatballs-not my typical lunch, but a steal at $10. The salad was a bit overdressed for me, but the lettuce was fresh and crisp and came topped with generous shavings of parmesan. Not that shaker stuff, but real, quality parm. \n\nThe spaghetti and meatballs.....I DIE.  The noodles weren't oversauced and the sauce was flavorful, probably due to the best meatballs I've had in a while. I think Dom DeMarco's mixture is one of pork, beef and veal which gave them a really nice flavor and texture. I hate the word moist, but there's no other way to describe them-they were so tender! You only get two with your order, but they're a really good size, so any more than that would've been overkill. For $10, this was a quality lunch that didn't leave me feeling full of overeating regret.\n\nI sat at the bar and had fantastic service. Food came out quickly and the bartender was attentive, friendly and conversational. This could easily be a power lunch spot or a family dinner hub-the vibe there is kind of fluid like that.\n\nI don't know when I'll be back since it's so, so far from my house. In the meantime, I'll be dreaming of those meatballs! ::That's what she said?::"

I ordered a large pepperoni to go.  When I arrived, they gave me a pizza with all sorts of veggies on it.  Not a pepperoni in sight.  I said that's not what I ordered.  The girl sort of argued with me saying she didn't take the order but that this was a New York pizza.  I said I didn't care who took the order or what you called it, this wasn't a pepperoni pizza.  She went away, came back and said it would be a few minutes.  OK, mistakes happen.  They were playing \"Dark Side of the Moon\" so they got exact points from me!  While I waited, several people got pizzas to go.  The girl at the front opened each box and showed them their pizzas.  Each one had a black, burned-beyond-belief crust.  Everyone said, \"Great, thanks!\"  and left with their pies.  I couldn't believe it.  So I was ready when they brought mine out.  I guess since they \"rushed\" mine out, it didn't have time to be burned.  It tasted just OK, but way overpriced at $20 for a single topping.  Don't think I'll go back."

It should be spectacular right? right?\n\nSadly no, I got thick crust pizza the \"legendary\" one. It was not great. Well, the crust itself was not great, the stuff on it (approx. 15% total pizza volume) was excellent. The crust was flavorless and spongy, like an angelfood cake. No thanks. The pepperoni, cheeses and sauce were excellent.\n\nAlso the service: I was drinking beer, because beer is delicious and everyone should always be doing this, and somehow this was a problem. We had a party of 10 and the soda drinkers were regularly refilled by a gentleman who had me understand that as a minor in our United States he could not bring me a beer. However our overage server was far more rare and apparently had a variety of macular degeneration that kept him from noticing an empty pint glass. When it did get refilled I asked for a \"Deschutes Porter\" and got a Mirror Pond. This is a bit like requesting \"Big Momma's House 3\" from Redbox and getting \"The History of the Ku Klux Klan\".\n\nAlso we had reservations for 9+3 small children. They sat us at a pub table. Lucky we have good kids who don't need strapped in.\n\nBeer list was pretty solid, pizza wasn't altogether terrible, and the place was swanky. I wish I liked it more.\n\nTips on having a good experience: Order a thin crust pizza regardless of regular order, don't bring your children, and when you run out of beer stand on your chair and say \"HEY CAN SOME MOTHER FUNSTER BRING ME A GODDAMN PORTER? THEY ARE BROWN AND COME FROM THE TAP LABELED \"PORTER\"!"

If you're just grabbing a pizza you can get an OK one lots of places, but I loves me some DiFara special. The Sicilian crust is fluffy and golden, crispy and buttery on the bottom. YUM! Not cheap but you get a lot of food. One member of our party always get a full caprese salad for herself. The burrata they use in it is so creamy it must be homemade. The last time, though, a request for extra cheese was not honored, although they didn't charge, it was disappointing to not get what we ordered, and one of the pizzas was burnt. Not wood-oven charred, just burnt. We ate it anyway but probably should have sent it back. Other visits have been 5 star quality. Hope this was an isolated slip up."

The type of salad we ordered was supposed to be traditionally no lettuce but tomatoes cucumbers and a few other things all chopped up kind of together and vinaigrette it was good just came a little bit odd  from tradition. \nI had artichokes and added to the pizza, considering those are one of the heaviest items that is on a pizza they should have been arranged towards the back of the pizza because when you pick it up the tip is so heavy from the artichokes that were placed in the middle it was a slight inconvenience. Again not a big deal.\nThey were switching over salt and pepper shakers which was on a side station right next to our table so the rattling of those and the four five employees it took to do that was kind of a nuisance, could have done that in a back room or a table where no ones at, again not a big deal just minor details that to me are common sense.\n You don't annoy the only two people that are in there spending money. ( there were a few other tables but not in that area just us)\nOur waiter was a bearded guy a little bit of a big guy,  he was very nice and very kind we needed a few things throughout our dinner experience and he seemed to be the only one busy,  the other for 5 employees like I said they were doing salt and pepper and walking around and when they seen our empty glasses turned a blind eye like they wouldn't even help him out. One young girl in a red shirt did help with refills one time.\n Also took tiramisu to go it was very very very very good dazzling homemade not frozen but for $9  I expect homemade. It looks like they have a great happy hour and when the weather is cooler I'm sure the patio is going to be packed I live 32 miles away and I will come back"

A friend told me Dom DeMarco's shipped in water from New York, so their crust would taste right. I don't know if that's true.  I do know that the pizza is good.\n\nMy husband and I decided to try the Di Fara special, because the menu says it's legendary.  It's also expensive, and it's hard for me to pay a lot for pizza.  But the Di Fara is worth the price.  Really nice crust, great toppings.. (Why doesn't everyone put fresh basil on pizza?  It makes such a difference.  And the Di Fara is big.  Since there was just the two of us, we took half home and had a great lunch the next day.\n\nWe also tried Gram's meatball lollipops, because they had been recommended.  It was an appetizer, so there was only three.  I wish there had been more.  They were so juicy and flavorful.. I could have had a meal of just meatballs.  Maybe I will next time.\n\nI also like the way the restaurant is laid out.  It looks completely different from when it was Atlanta Bread Company.  We sat inside, but the outdoor area looks great.

It's doughy and unpleasant and I just do not enjoy it as a general rule.  Fortunately, Dom DeMarco's has a solution for those friends who cannot agree on a crust: Two styles of crust!  One is a Regular crust (New York thin) and one is Square crust (thick and cooked in a cast iron pan).\n\nDespite my aversion to thick pizza, Dom DeMarco's really does it right.  My friends insisted we try one of each, so we got the Big Apple in Square and the Di Fara Special in Regular.  Both were really awesome.  Naturally, I loved the thin one best (Di Fara) but even I have to admit that this thick crust is good and the combo of meats on the Big Apple was out of this world.\n\nThe Eggplant pizzettes were money! Little, crunchy eggplant slices covered in parmesan and ricotta.  Yes, please.  Also enjoyed the Tomatoes & Burrata cheese appetizer.  Two criticisms: (1) we had an incredibly long wait due to the Cougar Den in the bar, but Dom DeMarco's is popular with a certain age group of women in Summerlin, so what are you going to do?  It's worth the wait; (2) that thick crust does not heat up well.  It was a grease ball the next day, so eat it while it's hot!"

There is nothing \"Happy\" about it.  There are no food specials, period.  What? Really?  Everywhere you go for similar promotions has food specials during happy hour. You do get the privilege of having a glass of tap wine (who wants that?) at 50% off.  The issue here, it still costs 7 bucks.  C'mon DeMarcos, normally charging 14 bucks for tap wine (who would pay that?) and reducing it 50% during happy hour is a joke.  Are you in the used car business?"

It's most definitely a good deal, we got the large Quattro Formaggio pizza, a coke and a beer and the bill was less than 15$! The happy hour prices would bring me back to try it again. But I was not impressed with the pizza. There were no aspects of the pizza that I was happy with; the cheese, the sauce, nor the crust. It didn't remind me of New York style crust at all as they claim on the menu.\n The staff and service was nice and helpful. The restaurant itself is really nice too.\nI've been wanting to try this place for a while, so I've gotten it out of my system and I can focus on other pizza joints I haven't tried yet."

Second time on a large pizza, sauce was chunky, and my reviews show, I hate chunky pizza sauce! (I know I'm fussy, but that's the way it is) Last Monday 2/20 we went again for a large pizza. I asked the server if they could put smooth sauce on our pizza, like straining it or removing the chunks. She checked with the kitchen and told me \"That's the way the sauce is\" meaning take it or leave it. To me, it wouldn't have been a big thing to take a minute to remove the tomato chunks before baking my pizza to keep a customer coming back. So, since they didn't take care of my needs, I will never go back there and I'm using Yelp to vent my displeasure with this place. To the owner: Take care of the customers, or they won't come back.\nNOTE 3/4/2012-Lori from DeMarco's contacted me offering to \"be our guest so we can make you happy\". A nice gesture, but I don't care now. I don't want a free pizza. We'll spend our yearly $1500-$2000 on pizza someplace else."

Is it way too much if you're also getting bread, maybe a pizza? Of course. Should that stop you? Of course not. \n\nWe went pretty simple here and did just great. Yes, a Cheese Pizza for the table. It's pretty much your classic New York Style. Not super thin, but plenty easy to fold it over (if that's how you roll). The kitchen seems to enjoy making the food here: the pizza tasted effortlessly good. \n\nI went with a Caesar Salad (adding Chicken). It totally hit the spot. Naw, I didn't really pick up on the anchovy in the dressing, but I still liked it a lot. The Romaine was perfectly crisp with a nice ratio of green and light colored leaves. Not too much dressing. The chicken was plentiful and good; charred nicely from the grill. The chicken wasn't hot, it seemed prepped ahead of time. Still, it was good, solid breast meat. Someone at the table had the Caesar, as is, and was satisfied. A Caprese Salad looked really good - and the report from the other end of the table was 'YUM'. So there ya have it.\n\nThought about trying the cannoli, but really, we were happy and comfortably full.\nGood service. Our waiter handled us just great, with a friendly confidence about everything they have at Dom's. Smallish wine by the glass selection, and nothing terribly unusual (Hess, et al). But, very good and reasonably priced. Bring the family, or bring the honey."

            "review": "I've tried Dom Demarcos PIZZA twice now and am ready to give. My opinion.\nFirst time I ordered a large square Pizza (Sicilian Style) with sausage. The Pizza had excellent taste and a great sauce. Could have had a touch more sauce and a lot more cheese for the thickness of the dough. There also could have been a little less olive oil in the dough, it was kind of greasy. I had ordered sausage on half of the pie. The sausage had good authentic taste, but there were hardly any pieces there, approximately 2 or 3 small turd style pieces per slice, just a teaser\nI had also ordered 2 Cannoli.($6.00 Ea) They tasted as if they were made. from a store bought flavored mix, not fresh ricotta cheese, lemon and sugar, there were almost no chocolate chips or dried fruit like the real New York version. If you're going to charge $6.00 a pop for a cannoli, make real ones!\n\nMy second try at Dom Demarcos, I thought I 'd try the traditional Neapolitan round. I ordered an 18in. with Meatballs for pickup and a Calzone with sliced Ham.\nThe pizza looked and smelled Great! There was one thing missing! I ordered MEATBALLS NOT MUSHROOMS on my pizza! If they used maybe 3 whole mushrooms on the entire pizza that would have been a lot by their standards!\nThe pizza towards the center was rolled as thin as a tortilla, maybe because there weren't any Italians working in the kitchen.\nThe calzone was good, but again the dough was rolled as thin as a tortilla and a finger touch in the center poked a hole thrrough it.\nThe bottom line is, if you're going to charge premium prices for PIZZA use premium ingredients and premium quantities on your product!\nI recommend that the owner should shop out competitors like METRO PIZZA, Biaggios,  and such and see what they offer at similar prices! \nYou got the New York taste down, but You got to put more stuff on your pizza!\nBTW way, I was born and raised in Astoria New York, My Grandparents were from Naples. I also have a 10 year culinary background as a Saucier and Sous Chef.\nI KNOW GOOD NEW YORK ITALIAN FOOD! \nWith a little improvement, this place can be one of the top pizza joints in Vegas!"

Everything from far away (i.e. pictures, passing by, signs) looks so tempting, so I was very hopeful that I would get an experience that would be enjoyable enough for me to return.  Alas, it falls a bit shy of being a great experience, but I may yet return to see if my one disappointment could be remedied.\n\nThe venue is fabulous - great patio area, attractive interior with great vibe both from the d\u00e9cor and the crowd, large bar area that gives it a bit more oomph on the adult scene side, and pleasant enough staff that keeps the mood jovial.  We had calamari which was typically good but not great, and the meatballs that were really good except for the fact that it was on the salty side.  No gamey taste, tomato sauce that was good but had an interesting taste, and sufficiently sized for the price.  Then we had the Di Faro pizza, my lone point of contention.  I'm not a fan of the deep dish style, more the New York style pizza with thin, chewy crust.  Well, Di Faro is a rectangular, deep dish style with just too much crust.  The balance just isn't there between the bread and the toppings.  As far as deep dish pizzas go, this one is pretty good.  I'm giving it a 3.5 stars based on great venue with decent other dishes, but since I can't, I'll knock it down the half based on my dissatisfaction with the main dish.  But, I am reserving a full star for another time when I will be trying a different style pizza.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  The bar area is large with ample stools and tables around it, so perhaps eating alone will work.  But the atmosphere isn't necessarily suited for walking in alone, so keep that in mind."

And it is better than I was prepared for. Believe the hype. \nHighest quality toppings that I've ever had on a pizza, crust that thin and crisp, cooked to perfection each time I have had the pleasure of dining here. Someday I will get a chance to try the thick pie but I will have to first overcome my love affair with the NY style. You may have to wait for a table and you may have to be patient for the food to arrive at the table but the wait is always worthwhile for such a quality product. You can't rush greatness."

Very small portion of spaghetti.  It comes with three  small meatballs menu says you can sub for sausage so I asked for two meatballs and one sausage they said if I want both then I can get one meatball and one sausage- they would not have lost any money if they gave me what I wanted .\n\n Had to ask a couple of times for bread and to refill the water just for spaghetti tax and tip $40!!!  \nSpaghetti factory in San Diego gives you twice as much food with a beverage, salad, a delicious bread, ice cream and 100% better service for 12.00!  Considering it only cost the restaurant pennies for spaghetti, I thought the $$$ would be for excellent service, nope.\n\nI did contact the business directly and mgr said next time I'm there I can have a free dessert, with he poor service and small portion of food had she offered a free pizza perhaps I wouldn't feel I wasted 40.00.  So many excellent restaurants in Vegas wish I had gone elsewhere."

I ordered for pick up small pizza ( only available size for gluten free) and a tomato burrata appetizer. \n\n12' pizza is 12$. Then an additional 6$ for the gluten free crust. Then 2$ per topping. \nSo you're looking at a 24$ dinky pizza with bell peppers, mushrooms, and 6 spinach leaves ( yes, 6 leaves for 2$!).\n\nThe tomato and burrata was a complete rip off at 12$. Was a slab of cheese, a few shreds of basil, and 9 very tiny, cold tomato wedges (another Yelper posted that she got 12 small wedges and felt the proportion of tomatoes to cheese was lacking so you can imagine mine). The container included a two small sauce cups, one with olive oil and the other with a balsamic reduction. \n\nThe cheese and balsamic sauce were actually tasty. The tomatoes were not sweet and they were cold. Fresh tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated. \n\nThe pizza was okay and I could see ordering it again IF it weren't 24$ a pop when I can make a comparable one with organic ingredients at home for 12$. \n\nSo total was 41$ including a 2$ tip. \nNot worth the price for the food/portions"

To top it off there was melted Parmesan cheese on top of the calzone, which just gave it a yummy sharpness. We also ordered a pizza with sausage and roasted red peppers...again, love the thin crust New York style pizza. I highly recommend this establishment. It's a delicious, hip place to meet for a business lunch or just to unwind after a busy day and catch the game on one of the flat screens on the patio over a delicious pizza."

Our server did a great job of getting our drinks and pizza order in quickly. Peroni on draft and served in icy glasses. Ordered the Big Apple--we got a large for the two of us because we were really hungry and we wanted some to take home. Pizza came in a reasonable amount of time and we got to it. Outstanding NY style pizza! Our server recommended the cannoli for dessert--house made and delicious. We split one, which was just enough for a few bites each. All in all, great food and service even on a busy Saturday night. Five stars!"

This comes without cheese, so it's naturally vegan with no modifications.  (They currently do not have a vegan cheese option here.)  Now, usually, I'm not fond of the cheez-less pizza, but Dom's has sold me.  The toppings were high quality (garlic, spinach San Marzano tomatoes) and really brought enough flavor to the table that cheese (or cheez) was not missed.\n\nA large pizza (split between two people) was enough to leave us both stuffed with leftovers for another meal.  And the true sign of a great pizza, it was still delish left over and cold right out of the fridge.  Maybe even better, as the garlic flavor had penetrated into the crust.  Best crust I've had in town definitely.  \n\nWe had good service, and the atmosphere is casual, but nice.  The place was full but managed to not be too noisy.  I wish I'd known there was patio seating, because it would have been a perfect night to sit outside.  Keep that in mind if the weather is nice.\n\nGood beer list, including several drafts.  They also have entrees and salads and sandwiches; looked like a few of those could easily be made vegan with the removal of cheese.  You could also go for a make-your-own pie with your choice of toppings.  If you think you have a favorite pizza in LV, definitely challenge your choice with this place.  You might change your mind."

It's not very often that I want a serious deep-dish pie, but when I do, Dom's is the only place to go.\nSo far, I've only ordered the DiFara special, but I haven't seen anything on the menu yet to make me stray! The pizza is so so good. The crust is the highlight and it's delicious - thick, but not bready, and deliciously flavored with some type of garlic-y stuff. The pizza is topped with some more high-quality cheese and pepperoni (like you'd expect from a fancy pizza place), and everything works together wonderfully.\nThe location is not near me, but it's really cute with a little patio area that's shielded with plants and slightly below sidewalk level, so you're not staring at the parking lot. The bar/wine specials looked really good, and I bet it's a cool place to go for a happy hour drink.\nPrices are higher, but totally worth it as the DiFara special fed 2 of us and we had leftovers for 3 days!"

The antipasto is really good but they don't give you enough bread in comparison to the quantity of cheese, peppers and prosciutto...ask for more bread in advance.  On to the service...hit and miss (more of a miss than a hit I might add), it seems the bussers are more personable than the waiters and bartender.  I don't know who the guy is behind the bar all the time but he needs a lesson in customer service skills. Seems more interested in hanging around with his buddies at the bar than taking care of guests...I don't know maybe it's just my perception but in that customer facing position you should be on top of your game.  For gods sake smile once in a while and interact with your guests.  Is it really such a horrible job to be a bartender?

Treated first with a bag of zeppoles served with raspberry sauce and progressing through two savories and two sweets before moving onto one of the iconic pies the first thing to strike me was how well everything was prepared - the scrambled eggs springy and the poached eggs runny with vegetables nicely prepared and plenty of cheese while both the baked pancake and French Toast were fluffy and sweet with top quality fruit and ample, but not overwhelming amounts of pure maple syrup.  Impossible to decide between the square or the round crust based on quality as both were excellent in Brooklyn our eventual decision was based entirely on the fact that the square pie is only available in a large size and although perhaps not as well seasoned in terms of the bright acidity of the tomatoes or robust herbal notes of the basil the crust at DeMarco's was every bit that of the version at DiFara's, lightly raised and golden with a light crumb and pleasant yeasty notes serving as a backdrop to ample cheese - undoubtedly a contender for the best pizza I've found in Las Vegas."

Square pie crust was fluffy and crispy due to all the olive oil. Lovely ambience which seems great for parties esp. with the landscaped outdoor seating.  Very friendly, attentive  and informative service."

The bar is good, the TV/SPORTS are always cranking. My latest complaints: they close too early. A few years back they tried a happy hour around midnight but didn't wait it out and seemed to close even earlier. On a recent visit I had some really good calamari, traditional Italian pub style but the portion is a bit small on that one. Generally speaking it's all good here. If you like being outside they have a good patio, you'd never know you were steps from the parking lot."

I called about a month before his graduation from UNLV and was helped by Nico. We agreed that he would give us half of the patio (with heat lamps) and we worked out a price per person (as we figured about 20 people) with appetizers and pizza as well as wine and beer.\n\nWell, as fate would have it- one of the few days that it rains and is windy happened on his day.  The assistant manager, Carl, was fabulous!!  He arranged for us to be inside with no problems.\n\nAlso, the UNLV graduation lasted about 4 hours (2 hours longer than I had planned!) and I made an emergency call to Carl and he was taking care of everything.  If anyone showed up from our party- he was serving them (without any deposit from us!) and telling everyone the situation.  My cell phone died as I was trying to reach everyone.  So needless to say, I was in super panic mode!\n\nWe got to Dom DeMarcos- our friends and family were eating and drinking and having a great time!\n\nWe had:\n1. EGGPLANT PIZZETTES  9\nBreaded eggplant topped with whipped ricotta, parmesan reggiano, basil and tomato sauce.\n*Delicious. Even those that \"don't like eggplant\" liked these!\n2. GRAM'S MEATBALLS SLIDERS  11\nSecret family recipe of pork, beef, and veal, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.\n*These are the only meatballs I like besides my own. Juicy and full of flavor.  I usually order them lollipop style (on a stick) instead of sliders.\n3. CAESAR  FULL 9, HALF 5\nHearts of romaine lettuce in creamy garlic dressing, shaved parmesan reggiano.\n*Being that its my husbands grad party and he loves Caesar salad this was a must have. Classic and delicious!\n4. MEDITERRANEAN  FULL 13, HALF 7\nChopped romaine, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red peppers, garbanzo beans, red onion, pepperoncinis, kalamata olives, feta, house vinaigrette.\n*Great salad and full of veggies!\n4. Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza\n5. Cheese Pizza\n6. Pepperoni Pizza\n*Classic New York pizza that everyone enjoys.\n\nFood kept coming out and no one went hungry!  In fact, some guests left with boxes of food.\n\nWe had less people than we thought, so we were charged per dish and per drink (we didn't limit to beer & wine- we said serve whatever anyone wanted).\n\nBill came to less than $250 for everything! OMG- amazing!! For all the food and drinks for about 12-15 people. This was great!\n\nI would highly recommend having a party here as everyone was very helpful and accommodating.\n\nThanks Dom's for making my husbands grad party a success!!"

The food is excellent but what I have noticed during my last 3 visits are the following.....\n\nThe portions are getting smaller. The drinks are getting skimpy. Durning a recent visit I ordered a $12 glass of wine, by husband ordered a scotch on the rocks. My glass had about 4oz of wine and my husband received a glass of ice and about 2oz of scotch. You've got to be kidding me  \n\nReturned again over the weekend with a party of 12. Orders 2 full salads 3 appetizers 4 pizzas and 3 entries. Like I said before the food is excellent but the portions have gotten significantly smaller. Here is the kicker.. We were celebrating my sons bday. I informed our waiter of the occasion. At the end of our meal he brought out a cannoli with a candle. Very nice except he charged us for it. I found this to be very tacky. Our bill was well over $300 and an 18% gratuity added. (Which I have no problem with). Had our waiter not charged us for the cannoli I would have rounded up the tip to 20%. \n\nDear Management... Stop being so skimpy. Your not a strip restaurant."

Yesterday I ventured out and tried some thing new with my bottle of wine...the sausage and broccoli rabe pizza. It is my new favorite pizza of all time! Holy Moly was it delicious. Spicy, meaty, a tad bitter, garlicky, pure delight. I loved the grilled half of lemon. I squeezed it over the pizza and it took it to a whole new level of fantastic. It gave it a zip of sunshine that made my taste buds dance in delight. Thank you for letting branch out and broaden my horizons and thanks again for the great zza and service!\n\nMy husband and I have been here and I have been here solo. Each time we/I have had great food and wine. I am impressed by their happy hour from 3-6. They offer half off beer, wine, and well drinks plus select $6 apps and cheese pizza. From 2-4, M-F, they offer half off pizzas and half off bottles of wine. I absolutely love this deal.\nIf you check in on yelp you get free garlic knots. My husband and I checked in, got our knots and they were great. We also ordered the eggplant, cheese pizza, and Caesar salad (all part of the $6 apps). They were all fabulous.  When I was solo I ordered the square deep dish Margherita pizza (half off) and it was good, not the best I have had, but good. I will go back to the Neapolitan next time. \nThe service was a slow start the first time we were in, but once the ball got rolling it was smooth sailing. The second time I sat at the bar and no issues with service what so ever. \nI love the atmosphere and the clientele. The food is great. The prices are good. I will repeat."

Here's an idea for the manager go up to Smith's and buy a few cases. So I'm looking around at the walls and I see a safety light the kitchen that has a good 2 years worth of dust on top of it - that must be the lunch special their referring to on the chalk board?  Our order arrived and the meatballs under cooked also the bread was burnt black on one side it was turned down so you couldn't see it. The funny thing is when they brought our order to our table they didn't speak English - only Spanish. I did say in English mine is the seafood. I can speak Spanish but I didn't say anything as I just wanted to see how the 4 plates landed also the waiter was missing in action... I was like this can't get any better we are actually paying for this.. My wife is a Chef staying home is becoming the best option more and more... We will never go back complete waste of time and money.. Eating at Pet Smart next door could be a better option?"

I was hoping for a small deli-like store which sold large individual slices for a few dollars a slice. Instead, a large, upscale dining area along with an equally large upscale bar area greet me. Well, I sat at the bar still hoping for the ability to order individual slices, but that idea was quickly quashed. Oh well.\n\nI opted for a small \"Big Apple\" and my usual ice tea. The pizza was good, the crust was thin, not too crisp, and a bit chewy. After finishing my small pizza, the bartender made a comment about so much for pizza by the slice. I pointed out that I was not worried about quantity, but wanted variety. Service was otherwise great, my ice tea was never empty for very long.\n \nMy only complaint would be the prices, as mentioned in other reviews, they are a touch on the pricey side for what you get. If you are on the west side of town, are looking for some good food and good service, Dom's is definitely worth a try."

Both the food and service can be spotty, but when it's on, the pizza here is some of my favorite in town.\n\nBoth the New York style thin crust and the Sicilian style, square cut, thick crust  pizzas are delicious, but the Sicilian can be too greasy and the NY style can be overcooked at times. On our first visit they gave us one that was completely burnt and we were surprised that they let it leave the kitchen like that. Where's the quality control?\n\nWhen cooked properly, the pies here will make you forget about any other pizza joint in town with a crispy, yet chewy crust that can hold it's own under the weight of quality meats and cheeses and an amazing sauce. If you want a white pizza, the white truffle pizza is sure to satisfy and leave you craving for more.\n\nTheir menu may not be huge, but it's well focused and features plenty of great bites. Gram's Meatballs are a combo of pork, beef, and veal that you can get as sliders (on a brioche roll) or lollipops (served in a bed of marinara with toothpicks). The eggplant pizzettes shouldn't be missed. They're breaded slices of eggplant topped with ricotta, parmesan, basil and tomato sauce. The BLT salad (butter leaf lettuce, avocado, cherry tomatoes, bacon, gorgonzola dressing) was good but overdressed.\n\nThe desserts we've tried don't quite match the same level of deliciousness as the savory items. The house made tiramisu, served in a tumbler, was heavy on the cream and light on the biscuits. The chocolate cake, not made in house, is rich and dense and the perfect dessert if you're craving a chocolate overdose. It's great to share with two or three people.\n\nThe decor is modern chic. Lots of dark tones. It may not be the best place to take kids, but if they're well behaved, go for it. The open setting makes it loud enough to drown out any shrieks your kid might let out. There's no kid's menu, but they'll be happy to make a cheese pizza without the basil for the little ones."

In Las Vegas, where there are plenty of servers with tons of solid experience, we had an incompetent waiter who couldn't answer any of our questions about the ingredients on the menu.  I do feel sorry for incompetent people, but not when they're meant to be helping me order in a restaurant.)\n\nWhat we've got here is essentially a glossy, slightly upscale Domino's.

Both times my food was bad in different ways.  The anti pasta salad is a platter, not a salad.  With very little on it.  The most recent time the cheese was stale (the waitress who served it even noticed-then why did she serve it hmm?) the bread was hard-the rest was just average.  The pasta-the ziti has a lot of weird spices-I just wanted a great tasing comfort meal-this wasn't it.  The pizza-average at best,  I asked for little sauce (for my 4 year old) and got sauce pouring over the top edge.  Of course they offered to remake it-but they are so slow, it wasn't worth another 30 minutes to wait.  The garlic bread-lots of stuff, dry romano, etc but not much garlic-it's premixed they told me so they couldn't do better.  They add a lot of spices and dry cheese and toppings to everything-I guess to cover up the average cooking-yuk!  The serivce, nice but slow and not so smart.  I watched the waitress take lids off of drinks and smell them-she still gave my son the wrong drink-huh?  The bar is cute, I'm sure they can't mess up wine or beer.

They were crispy but not oily.  Good app.  I had a large New York style Big Apple pizza.  It had good crust, but could have used about another minute in the oven to crisp the bottom just a bit more.  I love truffles so I also ordered a square White Truffle pizza.  It could have used another handful of mushrooms, but overall, I loved the flavor.  Some may say the crust was too oily, but I like it that way.  I usually hate square pizzas, but I will order this one every time I come here.  \n\nIf you are looking for a bargain, you won't find it here.  The prices are not low, but the quality is high.  Drinks are expensive, so come during happy hour if you are going to have a few.  \n\nThe reason for a one star deduction is the service.  The service was terrible.  In fact, it was so bad that I would normally have given a two star deduction, but that White Truffle pizza was so good that they earned one star back.  \n\nGet the propane heaters outside working.  It was cold out there and since the waiting area is so small, they should make sure the customers have a comfortable place to wait.  The 20 min I waited in the cold felt like an hour.  Check the weather report and if nothing else, there is a Home Depot in the same parking lot."

It could have used some better music but other than that, a very chill spot.\n\nThe pizza itself was also good.  The thin crust could have been a little thinner for my tastes, but the selection of white pizzas was very satisfying.\n\nWas told we'd have to wait 20 minutes and it ended up taking only 8 to be seated.\n\nCons - The waitress we had was a little slow/scatter brained.  That said, she was still friendly."

We sat in the patio the weather was great the layout is awesome it's great for functions there I think it's awesome. But we did experience a long wait at the door. It Took a little too long for us to be seated. We both took notice. The waiter should inform all guests about gluten-free and vegan cheese things we missed out on. We were able to switch the cheese to vegan cheese. The pizza tasted fairly OK. I felt that I needed to add more salt and pepper to bring more flavor out of the sauce. Something I think they could work on is probably the sauce and bringing more flavor out. The waiter did take a long time to give us our first initial drinks of water and didn't check on us as quick as we wished he would. I think with a little work this place could be 5 stars"

The other two servers were wiping down tables and wandering around aimlessly. They all looked up at us then continued on about their chores. No hello, no \"be right with you\", no greeting of any kind. So we stood at the hostess stand for at least 5 minutes with no acknowledgement (probably closer to 10 min.). Then we walked out. Their staff is obviously poorly trained and not customer service oriented. We live very close by but we will NEVER go there again. Dom DeMarco's FAILED miserably, immediately after we walked in the door."

It's pretty big and the bar looks really nice.  I haven't had a chance to sit down and have a couple yet, but see that changing real soon.  I been wanting to try the DiFara which our waiter said was the best pizza they had.  It took a bit long for it to get to our table, but our waiter applogized and remained very attentive.  I was surprised with the size.  Probably perfect for three or two hungry people.  It's cut in squares and looks simple which it is.  Dough, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.  The quality.  of the ingredients is what makes it stand out for me.  I enjoyed it very much, but whatever happened to this pizza after I had spme the next morning while cold is why it went from a four star to a five.  All the ingredients seem to enhance especially the sauce.  Do yourself a favor and get the DiFara and save some for the next day it's really good."

I've heard rave reviews about this place, but it didn't come close to living up to the hype.\n\nFirst of all, if you hear that this place is a pizza joint, it is NOT. It's a sit down restaurant, while it features pizza, it's more of an Italian restaurant, than it is even close to a pizza joint.\n\nThey do not sell pizza by the slice, although the small isn't that big (perfect for two). I was born and raised in NY and I'm a pizza snob. The pizza was NOT NY style. Thin, yes, but not what a true NY'er expects when ordering NY pizza. This was crazy to me since the owner's dad owns a place in Brooklyn.  The crust was HARD, too hard. I recently got a crown, and was afraid to chew on that side of my mouth for fear of breaking the crown, that's how hard the crust was.  I ordered half cheese and half pepperoni, and it came with green leafy crap on it. I challenge you to walk into a real NY pizza joint and find green leafy crap on the pie.\n\nThree positives to the place is 1 - it's a pretty nice restaurant, good ambience, and energy. 2 - it's got a pretty extensive menu. Apps, salads, sandwiches (gourmet fancy ones, not subs), pasta dishes, and of course pizza. 3 - The service is outstanding.\n\nMy date had the grilled chicken sandwich (minus the bread), and immediately had to brush his teeth upon getting home to get the taste out of his mouth. I didn't bother asking what was wrong, as it didn't look or smell appetizing.\n\nAnyway, Eww somes it up pretty well."

I was convinced on the Big Apple which was as described by the hostess as a meat lover's counterpart. I thought the prices were a bit steep $17 for a small (12 inch) and $25 for a large (18 inch), not used to paying a premium for pizza, but why not. \n\nOrder was ready in the 25 minutes as promised, AND they even called to let me know the pizza is almost done. You could use this to your advantage by not even leaving your house until they call you, if you live close by anyways. \n\nThe pizza came in a completely plain white box, but had a mysterious aphrodisiac aura. The aroma coming out of the box into my car caused my neurotransmitters to release endorphins throughout my entire body... yup food porn at its best. I don't know what kind of biological beast the Big Apple was, but it honestly told every meat lover's I ever had to GTFO or that it was not worthy, or maybe it told me I  wasn't worthy of its crispy crust and delicious carnivorous toppings. Either way, definitely worth a try, price is not too bad if you're splitting with a few friends. \n\n\nNotes:\n\n- They need a menu online. \n- The Big Apple is one of the most expensive pizza on their menu so the price does not accurately portray their entire menu. Large pizzas really range from 20-26 for their New York Style and 27-30 for their full square cut. \n- Appetizers, pasta, sandwiches, and salads should be expected to be on the menu. \n- There is a bar."

I was pissed and hungry  I was not going to wait another 30 min. Told the waiter that we would share the dish that my wife ordered. The manager came by and offered a dessert but I declined. No one brought me a plate so I can share the dish so we were eating out of one plate which was kind of annoying. On top of that that food sucked. The head chef was just walking around the restaurant bullshitting with customers and not where he is supposed to be in the kitchen making sure everyone's order is correct. We left leaving pissed off. I definitely would not recommend and will not be back to this establishment."

The crust was semi charred which was nice but it didn't make up for anything i found wrong.  The cake slices we were given were decent but one had two sides and the top slathered in frosting... It was too much frosting and not enough of the actual cake. If you want real cake, check out Grand Lux Cafe... If you want better pizza, go to Papa Johns."

Nothing special by any means. It certainly has the hype of a great pizza joint and the interior is definitely a 4 star plus (thumbs way up for the designer, architect and contractor), however the food is mediocre. \n\nService: Poor for 3 of the 4 trips and extremely bad and lied to for 1 of the 4 trips.\n\nThey are good at greeting you, but that is about it. On my last visit there was a 30 minute wait, which we understand, however what irked me was the girl at the front flat out lied. It was a bit chilly and we asked for the outdoor heaters to be turned on since we had a large party with many small children. The hostess said ok, but looked like she really did not want to (it was almost like she was swamped and did not want to be bothered with another task). I looked her in the eye and said, is there a problem with the request. Hostess said no, but still looked annoyed. We waited 20 minutes and still no heater. I walked back in and asked the same hostess and she had a deer in the headlight look and said the heaters were not working. I asked her why she didn't let me know when we were outside since there was no room to wait inside, and she said I forgot. I reminded her we specifically asked for the heaters because there were small children and there were others waiting outside that had heaters on and I asked hostess what attempts were made to make the heaters work, since there were plenty on the other patio area that had plenty of heaters that were not turned on. Hostess replied with just a \"sorry\", as if no attempts were made and that she simply forgot to ask someone to turn the heaters on and felt it was easier just to say it was broken. I was beyond annoyed at this point, and asked to speak to the manager, at which point I was told our table was being set for us. I was upset, but because i was with family choose not to make a bigger scene and let it go. 2 months later, I finally wanted to voice my experience."

Overall, the pizza wasn't bad, but not exactly what I think of when I think of New York style thin crust. I tend I picture something a little different, maybe more like a Villa or Verrazano.  I'm not a fan of black edge crust either, a dark golden brown is my own preference. They definitely spent a bunch remodeling it from the old Atlanta bread Company that was there.  That being said I'm not from New York although I have been there and have had a couple different slices of pizza.  I will probably go again, but not sure if this will make it to the regular rotation."

It's probably the tastiest sauce I've tried.  We had some on the eggplant appetizer (tasty and perfectly fried) and on the Big Apple pizza.  Read on, pizza lovers, and try not salivate!\n\n- Big Apple pizza: red sauce with all sorts of meat.  The sausage is a-ma-zing.  I picked all of it off and my husband got really mad at me.  Hehehehe.\n\n- White Truffle pizza: I love me some mushrooms.  But I must admit this pie was a bit bland.  I really had to pile on the red pepper.\n\n- Bianca pizza: The cheesiness is heavenly.  The zing and flavor of all the different cheeses is melodious.  And greasy as all get out, but worth it.\n\n- I don't drink beer, but a pint of PBR was $3.  I think that's pretty cheap, right?  My glass of a delicious New Zealand Sauv Blanc was only $7.  Yeah, SEVEN.\n\nAll in all, for four people, we ordered the eggplant app, and 2 large pizzas...and still had about 6 slices left over!!  My advice: if you go with 4 people, one large pizza and a salad should do the trick (I saw many a salad pass by; they're pretty big).\n\nReturning for sure.

I should mention that not only was our server attentive and fast, but one of the chefs (maybe the owner- not sure) came by to make sure we were happy. I really enjoyed cool music and surroundings, the ambiance, the service and the food. \n\nA very deserving 4 stars!!"

This is certainly more upscale than the Brooklyn establishment, but it must be the difference in the water that simply cannot be overcome.  I would not drive out from the strip to eat here.  If I lived nearby in Henderson I'd go here."

Delicious \nChicken wings: 5/5\n10 wings per order with buffalo sauce. We ordered two orders fearing skinny chicken wings but this was not the case.  Full of meat and flavor with a perfect crispy skin. \nGram's Meatballs: 5/5\nPerfect blend of pork, beef, and veal.  Tender center with a crispy outside.

He lives in New Jersey and has nothing to do with this restaurant except that he sold the recipe to the owners and wanted his name on the building. \n\nAnd man oh man what a recipe it is. The pizza here is so awesome. I love pizza, and I often have very low standards. I'll eat Little Caesar's if you put it in front of me and I'll hate myself the entire time. I love pizza so much. That said, I am under no illusions about the quality of these pizzas. While I will still eat Little Caesar's, I do not think it is good. It is just pizza and I love pizza.\n\nThe pizza here has everything. Sometimes I have to order my pizzas well done, but the crust here comes out just right by default. The selection of toppings is great, and the quality of the ingredients is great. The sauce is delicious; often I find myself ordering light sauce at other places, or wiping off big chunks of sauce from parts of the dough that are uncovered by cheese and toppings. Not here. Not only do I not get pizzas with big empty spots of bread and sauce, if I did I'd just eat them because both the crust and sauce are delicious. \n\nThe garlic knots. Man oh man the garlic knots. I know my profile says I'm Paleo and I know that my reviews typically focus on the healthiness of the food i'm eating and the quality of their ingredients, and I know that all of this would lead you to believe that I would never eat garlic knots. These are so worth it. They are amazing. They are large, and slightly crispy on the outside but warm and soft inside. The crispness of the outside isn't like a shell, so much as it just provides ever-so-slight resistance before giving way to the soft delicious woven bread within.\n\nI love this place."

As suggested by my server with Chicken and an order of Garlic Knots.  For a beverage a Magic Hat #9 to drink.  While my food was ok, it was nothing more than angel hair spaghetti with garlic marinara and a frozen chicken breast grilled on top.  The garlic knots were so greasy when I bit into them when oil literally squirted across the table.  As a reliable favorite, Magic Hat #9 was awesome. This meal came to over $30 for me to eat alone.  When I paid my bill, my server came back with a hand written receipt and informed me their credit card machine was down and they were going to manually run my card later.  Wow.  awkward.  With all of that said I would have gotten the same meal of equal or better quality from any mom and pop pizza joint for less than half the price"

On the third time he gave us 3 waters and I ordered an antipasto as he kept moving. At this time there were about 5 tables and 3 other servers on the floor. The hype about this place is that the owner was one of the partners from Difaro's in Brooklyn. That's what got me there. We ordered antipasto, Zuppa di Clams Bianco, Cavatellis with sausage and broccoli rabe, the Difaro special, the NY Style thin crust (In NY we just say round or Neopolitan) and a bianco thin crust . Antipasto was ok and then came the clams that we ordered and  broccoli rabe which we did not order, but the server said we did. I reminded him that when he repeated our order it was not on it and he did not seem happy about taking it back. Then all the pizza's and the pasta came at once. Though they cleared the antipasto plate they left the clam bowls(one for shell the other for the clams). They just put everything on the table and left. I got up and served my Wife and Son and as I was giving myself some pizza the server came by and said he would serve. I told him I got it. The only items that were ok were the clams and antipasto. \nThe pasta had very little taste. The pizza's were not as advertised there was not any on the black charring as described on the menu. The prices are very high and I would not mind if the quality of the food was on par with the prices and the hype. Do not be fooled this pizza is not like Difaro's in Brooklyn.Having been born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. I can honestly say that this pizza is a best a regular neighborhood place with high prices. The dough is absolutely wrong and does not have any of the NY taste.\nI am sorry but we will never go back there are other pizza joints that are better and not such a rip off."

But some proprietors apparently don't know when to leave well enough alone.  \n\nAfter creating what I considered to be a perfect rendition of a New York style pizza, someone decided to change the formula.  So, on our last visit, instead of being presented with relatively thin but supple and highly malleable slices of pizza, I was instead greeted by a Large Pepperoni, Mushroom, Italian Sausage, & Green Bell Pepper New York Style Pizza made with high-grade San Marzano Tomato Sauce but fashioned with cooked dough that was, alas, both too thin and too crisp.  The toppings were still first rate.  But changing the recipe did not improve the product.  Diane, too, liked the toppings on her large Ham New York Style Pizza but also deplored the thinning and crispness of the new model.  The place was packed on a Sunday night.  But service by friendly staffers was excellent.\n\nUnless the New York Style pizza served here is restored to its earlier, more traditional excellence, I may be back--but definitely not as often."

The day of the shower he made sure to come in and help set up. He made sure we were happy with everything provided before he left. The GM and server then took over and we had the best service ever. With only 1 server and almost 50 people he was on top of serving everyone drinks and making sure our food was always fresh and hot. The whole staff was so nice!

The crust was not as thin as DiFara's in Brooklyn and the oil was not present as it is in Brooklyn. In Brooklyn the pan has a pool, not a coat, of oil under the pizza, after it is eaten. Not much oil was present here and that was just from the cheese, not from the generous amount of oil that is poured on pizzas made by Dominic himself.\n\nThe good news is that the pizza tastes the same, which is fantastic. There is no better. \nThere are some advantages to the LV pizzeria. \n\nComfortable chairs/tables and some elbow room. Working restrooms open to the public.\nTV. A full bar, free refills on soft drinks which are from a fountain. No hour long lines to get a table and fill an order. Tables are clean here, unlike in Brooklyn where they depend on people cleaning their own tables. \n\nThere is a full menu for Italian food, other than the fantastic pizza. We had a waiter, which does not exist in Brooklyn. \n\nThere is even a parking lot. How about that! Also this restaurant is open all day including Monday and Tuesday. Sorry, no private parties on Thursday night yet. \n\nPizza is not $28. for no toppings. It is listed at $18. but they gave us half off because of some promotion. Wow! $9.00 for an authentic DiFara's pizza!\n\nGiven a choice, I would prefer the excessively oiled pizza with the thinner crust in Brooklyn. But for $9.00, I will take this."

My first experience was extremely memorable, and the server was there with a great attitude, perfect recommendations, and answers to all of my questions. She even brought out the chef to address a concern I had due to my dietary restrictions. That was over-the-top impressive, especially for a \"pizza place.\" But since then, I've realized that this restaurant places importance on both product and service.\n\nThe pizza is perfect. My favorite meal here is the spicy Arrabiata pizza and a Caesar salad with added chicken breast. That one's a winner. The Eggplant Pizzettes are pretty fun as an appetizer. The Pesto pizza and the Broccoli Rabe are both good options as well. I decided to try the cheese ravioli once. It was okay,, like a C-, and actually kind of dry. Nothing special. I think its probably best to order pizza at a pizza place.\n\nI love that there is both indoor and outdoor seating, with a bar and TV's. It's laidback, upscale-casual, much like most of Summerlin. And its pizza.\n\nNo wonder Obama ate here."

I ordered the clam pizza and he ordered the arrabbiata pizza with added pepperoni and artichoke hearts.  I didn't know what to expect with the clam pizza but for some reason it just sounded so good to me.  When we got our \"small\" pizzas they were a lot larger than most small pizzas.  After a beer or 2 and appetizer we had about 4 slices leftover to take home.  The clam pizza was the first one I tried, after a light sprinkle of lemon I took a bite of it and it was the most amazing clam pizza I've ever had!  I love the dish linguini and clams so I would describe it as linguini and clams on a pizza.  I'm glad we ordered 1 pizza with the red arrabbiata sauce because going back and forth between a red sauce and white pizza was great contrast.  The clam pizza was so good and had so much flavor that it was nice to go to a pizza with more familiar favors.  I wouldn't call the arrabbiata and simple or plain pizza at all though.  The sauce had great flavor, the crust cooked perfectly and the toppings just added to the flavor.  Service was great also, from the friendly hostess to our server.  *will definitely come back!!"

I was in NY last summer eating my way through Brooklyn's highest rated pizza joints when I heard that Dom DeMarco Jr. was bringing Di Faro to Vegas. I nearly wet my pants in delight!\n\nWell, after months of waiting I was hoping Dom DeMarco's would complete the holy trinity of pizzas in Las Vegas, and Jesus Mary and Joseph it did!\n\nWe began with the eggplant pizzettes which were absolutely fabu! The sauces used here are made daily from San Marzano tomatoes, which is what I use at home as I love the rich, strong but sweet flavor that they offer. The eggplant was fresh and flavorful; the breading coating it was seasoned with Italian herbs, and combined with the sauce and the dollop of whipped ricotta on top shot this appetizer into entr\u00e9e territory. Seriously, they should layer 3 or 4 of these and call it a meal!\n\nWe then moved on to the 15th Street BLT - my new favorite salad. It's loaded with bacon, avocado, tomatoes and dripping with a beautiful gorgonzola dressing. It's perfect for two people, and I SHOULD have stopped there as I was comfortably full. \n\nNow for the main event: the pizza. The crust was crispy yet chewy, soft and perfectly charred, and dipped in the San Marzano tomato infused grease that had dripped onto my plate was simply moan inducing. The combination of the crust, sauce and cheeses make this one of the best pizzas I've had in Vegas in a while. \n\nI am a traditionalist and must finish any Italian meal with a tiramisu. Here it came in a little glass and was light, fluffy, perfectly sweet and creamy. A perfect end to the feast.\n\nI'd rank Dom DeMarco's in between Settebello and Due Forni."

The crust was cooked perfect!... although the chopped garlic was lacking in flavor and the pepperoni was a little burnt on it's edges.

Over all I would highly recommend this place to have a pizza in a nice , clean, friendly restaurant.They have a very nice beer and wine menu as well. I would vote this pizza based on the way I ordered ours as the second best pizza so far in Las Vegas that I have tried...... second only to a \"THIN CRUST ALL THE WAY TO THE EDGE WITH PEPPERONI AND FRESH GARLIC\" made by Brian at New York Pizza and Pasta on the North East corner of Sahara and Jones.If any one would like to recommend a place to me that has great NY pizza here in Vegas feel free to contact me via YELP.I've tried: Grimaldi's, East Side, Mark Rich's and Metro's. I'm just a pizza lover in search of the perfect NY pie. I form my own opinion, give an honest and fair review and share it here on YELP.\n   11/01/2012  Met some friends here for pizza.

I was through the roof excited to hear of Dom DeMarco's, so I dropped everything to dine here with some friends and family immediately. \n\nIt is an upscale looking restaurant with a bar area and a dining room that opens up to patio seating. It can get quite loud inside and the chairs are seriously giant, but overall has a really great feel to it. I loved the giant pictures of Vespa's on the wall and that they leave you a bottle of water on the table, very Italian touches. Our server was good, not great and definitely not overly available. \n\nWe started with calamari, eggplant pizzettes, and the SOHO salad. The calamari smelled great, but I don't eat calamari. I tried a bite of the eggplant, but again I am not an eggplant fan so was not impressed. Everyone at the table really enjoyed them though. I thought the salad was good, a mixture of lettuce, asparagus, green beans, fennel, fontina, and a light truffle vinaigrette. I would have liked a little more flavor from the vinaigrette, but it was a fun mixture of ingredients overall.\n\nWe decided to go with the legendary Di Fara Special pizza. Now, the pizza they serve in Brooklyn is of course thin crust, so please tell me why this pizza has a thick crust! It was good, although the pepperoni was seriously lacking in flavor and the cheese pulled off the pizza with every bite, but it wasn't necessarily a bad pizza. I enjoyed the flavor of the olive oil and the crust (and I am not generally a crust person). But, if you are going to have a Di Fara special pizza it would have to be a thin crust simple pizza, just like you would get in Brooklyn! \n\nI do wish I had gotten the opportunity to sample the NY style thin crust pizza, maybe next time. I found this place a bit pricey and a little lackluster. We definitely have better options in Vegas."

The antipasto platter was excellent, and was filled with good cheese and cold cuts.  The pizza was good, as it had nice thick pepperoni, not that crap you get on 99% of pizzas, although I could have stood for a little more heavy hand on the toppings.  The entrees, according to my friends were all good and the desserts were good.  The mascarpone tart, or whatever it was, was a bit dry, although the cannoli was good.  Overall, they serve good pizza, but also a solid assortment of real Italian food.  It is rare that you can have a place that is an actual Italian restaurant outside of pizza, that does very good quality food as well as being a place that you could go just to pick up a great pizza.  Overall, I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, but Yelp does not allow half stars for some inexplicable reason, and I enjoyed this place immensely AND I hear they are dog friendly, so in that case, you definitely get the 5 star round up."

Mother-in-law suggested Dom DeMarco's because it was close by and have good pizza and pasta.\n\nI quickly got on Yelp and made a reservation through Seat Me for 6:30p.  Upon arrival, we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated even though we arrived on time for the reservation....I'll cut them a little slack as the place is packed.  The owner is very friendly.  We brought 2 bottles of wine and they comp the corkage because my Mother-in-Law is a regular. Score 2 for the In-Law.  Otherwise it was $20/bottle....WOW.\n\nThe pizza is pretty good.  But the pesto was a little dry. For the most part, I like the friendly service, good food, and the atmosphere.  I'd recommend coming here with a large family.  Enjoy!"

            "review": "My husband and I are new to Las Vegas.  We were looking for a new restaurant to try and came across this spot while we were shopping next door.  I looked over a few of the yelp reviews and was very excited to give it a try.  Now i feel terrible.  My husband wanted to try a little Mexican restaurant down the street, but I convinced him to go here.\n\nOur dinner was ruined from the start.  We came in on a Thursday a couple of weeks ago.  I didn't think it would be too busy.  I figured I was right when i saw that the restaurant was pretty empty.  We still had to wait about ten minutes to be seated.  My daughter works as a server and has told me before that \"just because a restaurant looks slow/empty, that doesn't mean that all of the empty tables are available.\"  I was okay with the short wait.  We were seated right next to another table.  I was a little confused by this point.  There were several tables available that wouldn't have put us so close to other diners.  The space between us was so close, I really felt like we were dining together.  I asked if we could be moved (just one table over), and the hostess/server was so rude.  She said that it was the only table available and we should just sit down unless we wanted to wait longer.  My husband wanted to leave at that point.  We almost got into a fight about it because I really wanted to give it a try.  The food cooking smelled delicious!!  \n\nThe menu looked great!  There were several options that really reminded me of home.  We ordered an antipasto salad and an order of meatballs for an appetizer.  We wanted to wait to order our pizza later, but our server assured us that our meal would be coursed properly, and we could order everything all at once.  I kind of felt pressured into ordering everything.  Our server was quite pushy, and made me feel like we were inconveniencing her by us even being there, so we went ahead and ordered a white truffle pizza for our dinner.  I don't know if she was about to get off for the day, but the whole experience seemed very rushed.  When we told her that we were wanting to take our time with dinner, she gave us a defeated look.  \n\nThe appetizers seemed like they were taking long.  When I saw our server walk by, we asked if everything was coming along okay.  She just snapped, \"It's coming.\"  Okay, I guess I'll wait.  I am used to someone stopping by the table to let me know if my food takes a little long.  It was fine, I was just so hungry because of all of the yummy smells.\n\nOur salad and meatballs came out together, which was very nice.  They were both delicious!!  However, I feel like the prices are on the high side for what comes on the plate.  I don't ever complain about the prices, I knew what I was paying when I ordered. I guess I just expected the dishes to be worth their price.  \n\nThe pizza was brought to our table literally MINUTES after we got our apps.  We were only able to serve our plates, and take just a couple of bites before a food runner carried over our pizza.  We looked at him with a confused look, he saw our table full of food, and took our pizza back without a word!!  When we told our server that it was okay, she brought it back to the table.  This is why we wanted to order it separately.  We don't mind waiting for food, we just don't like feeling rushed.  \n\nThe pizza was delicious!!  So yummy!!  \n\nWe decided against desert or after dinner drinks.  We just wanted to finish up and leave.  I will definitely come back for that pizza!  I might even try a different appetizer or salad because there were other things I wanted to try, BUT I will not come back in to dine.  We were so unhappy with the service from the time we walked in until the time we left.  We still tipped our normal 20%, but the attitude and atmosphere nearly ruined our meal.  Next time we will order to go and eat at home."

This time it was just Ok as it didn't have any Marcella flavor to it and the sauce was more like gravy. I like to go to restaurants because of the consistency and there was none here.  The waiter was nice and said he would relay my concerns to the manager. I was here about two years ago and had spaghetti and meat balls which were good though almost cold when served. I talked, at that time owner, he was great and comped the meal. Don't think I will go back again though. a senior gentleman and go out to eat at least 5 or 6 time a week."

If you are staying on the strip, it is a bit of a drive, but I think it is worth it.  \n\nThe service was outstanding... They have a huge inside area, as well as a great, large patio.  It was a bit windy, but other than that, all was right.\n\nWe missed the Happy Hour, which I hear is great, but we had a deal with some free apps... the delicious Golden Calamari and Gram's Meatballs... Mmmm...\n\nWe spilt a whole bunch of salads... all delicious... and then... bum ba bum... the pizza... Aaahhh...\n\nThe White Truffle is a must... so rich and oozing with flavor...

I'd give this place five stars if it weren't for going so long to between visits from our server. Drink refills, extra napkins,  the check and some to-go boxes.... \n\nOverall,  I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a good pizza place with good grub."

I was really excited about FINALLY being able to try out the pizza at Dom DeMarco's - but I have to report that sub par service ended up putting a damper on our experience.  \n\nMy husband is totally a pizza guy and he was HUNGRY!  We walked in and were promptly seated by the friendly hostess. We noticed that there was a large party of about 20 women at one table and a family of four at another. All in all, pretty quiet for mid-afternoon on a Labor Day Monday.  \n\nWe got menus and drinks...and waited. Another couple were seated close to us in the restaurant. We waited. A table of four were seated. We waited. There were two waitresses in our section - but ours was evidently tied up with the large party. The couple ordered and received appetizers - my hungry-hungry husband fell into a low-blood sugar quiet funk. We waited. The table of four put in their order. We waited. Finally, our waitress came over and admitted she had forgotten that she hadn't taken our order. (Kudos on the honesty...)\n\nNow, as hungry as he was, the husband was nice enough to capitulate to my love of thin crust pizza, ordering up a thin-crust Margherita, instead of going with the toothier square cut. After watching all of the tables that were seated after us dig into their food - our much heralded pizza finally arrived.\n\nIt was just OK. I liked the balance of flavors of the cheese versus the fresh basil and the sauce. The cheese tasted incredibly fresh and of high quality. I felt the crust was a little too thin - bordering on a crispy cracker (but I'm a California gal, what do I know of true NY style pizza?). Kind of flavorless too. We'll definitely be back, I still want to try the cheeseless Bella Napoli - but maybe we'll make sure there aren't any large parties in the house before we sit down."

I heard about this place through a foodie blog and decided to try it out with my boyfriend and some friends.\n\nAppetizer: Antipasto. The antipasto is pretty good. All in all I would have liked a bit more meat options and maybe a few more cheeses. The prosciutto tasted a little old but mixed with the saltiness of the olives and the cheese you couldn't tell.\n\nDinner: Artichoke Pizza, Bianca Pizza and Chicken Sandwich. My boyfriend and I split the Bianca pizza and he ordered the chicken sandwich. The Bianca is a white pizza with no sauce. I thought it was mighty tasty. Who can say no to Ricotta, cheese, garlic and EVOO on a thin crust? Not this girl! I thought it was good until I tried our friends pizza. The artichoke pizza comes with sauce and that made all the difference. Their pizza was even better than ours! My boyfriend said the sandwich was good but had a bit too much pesto and cheese on it. Other than that it wasn't bad. \n\nThe decor is nice. Sports bar feel with a little bit of luxury involved. Their wait staff is clearly trained to upsell but they aren't too pushy so don't be afraid to pass. Next time I think we will try a red pizza and possibly the meatballs!"

On my previous visit for a Saturday lunch the food took over an hour and fifteen minutes to arrive. They did comp our appetizers for this but still. So when we all went today, we were hoping it would be different. The owner is walking around and being friendly to his regulars, but not talking to any other tables or helping the 2 servers. Food took 52 min after order was placed today. Not an ideal for lunch. (Yes, we did time the food today due to out previous experience)."

By 5:30 this place was jammed and lines out the door. First, the ambience is very nice for a pizza joint. Very upscale decor. The only down side of this is that the prices are high for a pizza joint too. The house red was wonderful, but I thought $22 for a half carafe was a bit spendy. We had the Mediteranean chop salad and that was tasty. But $13. for a side salad seems excessive considering the menu. Server, Colleen, was not only gorgeous but gracious and helpful. We had the Sicilian Big Apple and enjoyed it....though it wasn't the best pizza I have ever had. They seemed a tad skimpy on the cheese too. All and all a good experience at a not so cheap price. Go, but be prepared to dump a few bucks at this joint. Looks like the rest of Summerlin will keep it humming."

They have to figure out a better system.  If you are getting take out on a Friday or Saturday, one the main reasons is because you are avoiding crowds.  Then you walk head first in to people storm at the front register of this place.  Usually about three employees plus a manager, at least 10-20 people trying to check in or be seated and all you want is your pizza still hot (not to mention is I am always in sweats and a baseball cap and I do not want to be stuck here with the Summerlin Housewives....)  Create a take out counter, or do it at the bar like other places do, this front register situation is just BEYOND chaotic."

The cheese was reasonably stringy, the sauce was very good with a great tomato essence but a bit of saltiness. So I still gave it 4 stars...in NY I might have only given it 3, but I suspect in LV no one is nearly as good. Wine prices were a bit high but not bad."
