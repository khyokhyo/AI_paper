Previous visit was 3 years back and incredible, so hopes were high for a similar experience.\nI have to say that we were not disappointed.\n\nTable was ready when we arrived and service was spot on. Crab and lobster cakes appetizer was terrific and flavorful with big lobster pieces (wife thought they were tomatoes!). Both ordered the filet, which were cooked as ordered to perfection.\n\nNo dessert or coffee for us as we we started to slip into a food coma after eating those protein bombs.\n\nEaten at a lot of places in Vegas and this is still a favorite!"

            "review": "My boyfriend and I went for Valentine's day this year and had an amazing dinner. Alex was our awesome server and he recommended our new favorite wine. Pricey but definitely worth it if you like Cabernet Sauvignon. We started with their Clam Chowder and Caprese salad. Without a doubt, their Caprese was the best I have ever tried. Their Clam Chowder was also very good but not the best.  I ordered the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster and my boyfriend ordered the Dry Aged Sirloin steak. My steak and lobster were delicious, but holy cow, my boyfriend's steak was so flavorful! We ordered two sides and barely touched them since we were focusing on our steaks. Make sure not to over order since their sides are big. Each side can serve about four people. Overall, a great dinner overlooking the Las Vegas Strip.  If you eat here, do request a window seat."

            "review": "We came here on a Thursday evening for a pharmaceutical hosted event. For appetizers we had the Wagyu beef carpaccio. For salads, we had a Ceasar and Wedge salad with bacon. For the main course, we had a 10oz fillet mignon and 14oz sirlion steak. For dessert, we finished off with creme brulee and a flourless chocolate espresso cake.  \n\n- I had to park next to the green at the Fashion Show mall to get here. Went up an escalator and out the food court and into Capital Grille. \n- Great service. Servers greeted me with a glass of white wine and took my order promptly. \n- Wagyu beef was finely sliced. Reminds me of when I go to a korean BBQ or Japanese restaurant. Nice presentation and nice flavor.\n- The wedge salad was interesting. Litterally a chopped head. Don't think you're expected to finish all of it, but if you managed to do so, good for you. haha. \n- The steak and fillet mignon were excellent! Very juicy and tender. High recommendation. But if I had to chose, I go with the sirloin over the fillet. \n- We had mashed potatoes, mushrooms and green beans for side. Taste like any other steak restaurant to me, equivalent Mastro's. \n-  The desserts were sweet. Excellent presentation. Just what I expected."

My salad contained no herbs other than what was in the vinaigrette dressing I had on the side.  Capital Grille should rename it the \"Iceberg Lettuce and Tomatoes\" salad.  \n- My 2 buddies had each ordered soup with their fish entrees.  Both buddies said that the waiter had made it seem that the $11/soup would be complimentary (since it was our first time eating at Capital Grille or whatever).  I wasn't paying attention to what the waiter said when he was discussing the menu, but I'll side with both of my friends (word of my 2 friends vs. the word of 1 waiter) who say they were mislead into ordering the soup.  Had my friends known it wasn't complimentary, they wouldn't have bothered ordering the soup.\n\nPros:\n- Great location overlooking the northern end of the Strip.\n- Aside from the soup problem, the service was great.\n- Fancy decor, nice ambiance."

He was very knowledgeable of the menu with great recommendations! We started off with the lobster bisque and French onion soup. Though you cant necessarily compare the two the French onion was my favorite. Definitely should've ordered the bowl. I also extremely enjoyed the filet Oscar with crab. The meat was so tender and the bernaise sauce  complimented it very well. On the menu most of the steaks did not come with a side luckily mine came with asparagus. We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese to share. YUM! I'm a huge fan of Mac and cheese and this was probably the best I've ever had. \nYes it is a bit pricey but it was 100% worth it!"

I believe Smith & Wollensky went under or moved out on the strip years ago and next to Capital Grille any Smith & Wollensky is a 2nd trimester pre-natal boy in a Capital Grille MAN's game...Joe's Prime Steak & Stone Crab in Seizures Palace is really the only Las Vegas strip outfit that can compete in this segment, in my opinion.  This Capital Grille location is superb.  I think Del Frisco's off-strip is the only place capable of besting C.G. in Vegas.  Absolutely superb execution.  (And no 6x wine mark-ups, it's reasonable.)"

Service thereafter was seamless, high-touch - special kudos to certified trainer Michelle Underwood (?)\n\nRanked in order of recommendation:\n\n24 oz. Dry-Aged Porterhouse - perfectly medium rare. 3 of us enjoyed this equally much.\nLobster/Crab-stuffed Shrimp - this was a beautiful entree but too rich, would strongly recommend sharing.\nSpinach salad w/warm bacon dressing, onions, mushrooms - delicious.\nLobster mac - found this too crunchy - heavily crusted (not light as panko typically might suggest), has a few lobster lump pieces.\n\nGenerous wine list with a wide range of tastes and price points is a plus."

This wasn't our first choice for a steakhouse dinner but a family member who lives in the area highly recommended it to us. Let me tell you this place was AMAZING!!!!! The view of the strip at night while you eat is cool. (that is if you're sitting by the windows) My fiance ordered the seared tenderloin and butter poached lobster, the only thing he wasn't a fan of was the portion because this man can eat but overall he was satisfied with taste and presentation. I ordered the holy grail of their steaks, the porcini porterhouse, and this baby was HUGE!!! The steak was life changing!! We shared the truffle fries and the lobster mac n cheese as our sides and both were awesome. Since i had put we were celebrating my fiance's birthday on our reservation, our table had birthday decor and a hand written card thanking us for celebrating with them. AAAAAAND we were given complementary champagne to toast before we ate. If i could give them 10 stars i would. Their service was excellent and the food was phenomenal! I highly recommend!"

Capital Grille went above and beyond with a letter from them, congratulating us. Also heart shaped decor was put on our table and free dessert for the occasion. The food was to die for! We ate till we couldn't anymore! :) Great people working there, from the waiters, to the bussers, and management! I'm sure if we met the kitchen, they'd be pretty awesome too! I'll be back sooner than later, that's for sure!!! Thanks for the wonderful experience and helping me celebrate my one year!!!"

Average at best, had much better elsewhere for less money. \nAtmosphere was pretty nice, service was sub-par/slow, bar was very slow at getting drinks out, food was fast and presented really nice but unfortunately we all ordered med-rare streaks/lamb and all came to the table med/overcooked...would think their line cooks could get the temps right for the price. Sides were good, birthday girl was happy overall which is all that matters as it was for her, but I would not recommend this place for the price nor will I be going back soon.\n\nMy wife read they were bought out by Red Lobster Corp or something, which probably hasn't helped anything."

The service was absolutely wonderful and the food was exceptional.  Most people in our party had steaks which they were all happy with.  We also ordered a number of side dishes-- 6 or so for the table, which were great for sharing.  I'm not that into French fries but theirs are something else-- the truffle oil takes them to a whole new world.  The lobster mac was also amazing.  I was one of the few who had fish (sea bass) and another person had the ahi.  Really good as well.  We had some wine (I didn't order it so not sure what) that was good with comparable prices to other nice restaurants.  Their deserts are not to be missed.  The coconut cream pie (not typically my go to) was deslish as was the flourless chocolate cake."

The ambiance is very nice with a nice view of the Wynn and part of the strip.  \n\nWhat we ordered:\nCaprese salad:  The mozarella was decent, but nothing spectacular.  The tomatoes were average, I'm surprised they didn't try using heirlooms here.  The balsamic vinegar was the highlight of the dish and made an otherwise average dish a little better.  \n\nKona crusted filet mignon:  Boyfriend ordered this.  It wasn't bad, I've had better.  The Kona crust gave a different flavor to the steak, but the filet was a little on the dry side.\n\nPorcini rubbed delmonico:  At first, it was over-cooked.  Ordered medium-rare / medium and it came out more towards medium / medium-well.  I cut it next to the bone and it was just pink.  I really hate to send food back, for the price I was paying, I was not too happy. The second steak was cooked to perfection.  Very good marbling.  The rub added a nice touch to an otherwise tasty steak.\n\nRoasted Seasonal Mushrooms:  A mix of mushrooms sauteed with butter.  Good mushrooms, nothing spectacular, nothing to complain about.\n\nCheesecake:  Not your ordinary cheesecake.  First of all, it is round.  It is not as dense as your typical cheesecake, which is a good thing to me.  There is a creme brulee-like crust over the top.  Save room for this.\n\nOverall, dinner for two ended up costing us over $100, and it came out to about $250 with alcohol.  The service was good, I would probably have given them a 4 if the steak was prepared to my liking the first time around.  If you are a salt and pepper steak fan like I am, I would look somewhere else.  But if you want to try something with flavors you can't find anywhere else, this is worth a shot."

The chain holds to consistent standards of excellence, known for their on-premises dry-aged prime cuts and superior service. The Las Vegas location holds up its end of the deal.   \nThe atmosphere is what I'd call \"hunt club\" - dark rich woods, elegant but not overstated decor (in this location the unique feature is painted potraits of famous local entertainers). This location adds a 3rd-story view of the Wynn casino and surrounding neighborhood.  \nService is imbeccable - timely, welcoming, classy, attentive, & knowledgable about fine cuisine.  Although the atmosphere is elegant and cuisine very high-end, the staff make you feel right at home (even if you arrived in merely a dressy casual fashion). A special mention is deserved for our waiter David.  \nAh, but ultimately it's about the food. Let's start off with the Procuitto-wrapped mozzarella appetizer, served over mildly-oiled toasted crisps with cherry tomatoes and banana peppers. The combo of textures and flavors was on the money. My friend had the steak au pouvre with courvosier sauce. I'm not generally a big pepper steak fan but the tenderness, the rich sauce, and the just-right touch of pepper were a winner. My porcini-rubbed Delmonico may be the most exquisite such cut I've ever had; cooked to a PERFECT medium, melt-in-your-mouth juicy, with a delicate sweetness from the rub. Wow!  I somehow found a way to eat the whole cut. \nDesert for me consisted of a homemade DARK chocolate ice cream that was so rich it should have come with bodyguards. A hint of mousse-like quality but clearly ice cream. Exquisite! \nOverall: As my buddy Matt put it, an experience for all the senses. If the opportunity arises, I WILL return, as I have to the Captial Grille in Denver. My compliments to the staff, and Bon apetite to you lovers of fine cuisine!"

Having the original location in my home city gives me great perspective in understanding how things \"should be\" \nI visited the bar for a quick bite and cocktail during my visit and Mark made the time spent there enjoyable. The truffle fries, calamari and fresh bread were perfect as usual. Next time I am ordering dinner.."

There are 2 CG's in the L.A./O.C. area and I thought I'd try the one here in Vegas, since the restaurant is situated to have spectacular views of the strip.  In our case the Wynn and Encore and southward.  \n\nThe entrance (from the garage) was a ride up in the elevator directly into the elevator.  I had to adjust my eyes a bit because it was dark with dark mahogany furniture.  We had a table by the window and a birthday card with glitterati candy all over the table - here for my birthday.  Love that!\n\nI knew what I wanted to order, since a couple of days before.  I started with the lobster bisque with sherry.  The soup came out piping hot, not too thick and rich with a good amount of lobster strips.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail and forgot that we had until midway into our dinner.  We both ordered the Delmonico steak.  I had my steak prepared medium rare and the hubs had it medium well.  Medium rare the way to go...yumm!  That was a juicy piece with browned fatty corners...mmmm. Tender and tasty.  I knew this steak was taking me down it was 22 ounces! I had a fist size left over which I had later that evening as a snack...yay!  Sam's mashed potatoes was smooth with some chunks of potatoes - gosh, that was creamy rich goodness.  The spinach which I thought was going to be creamed was actually lightly steamed with bacon, I think - the steak was so good that the sides were actually SIDES and not taking over the limelight.  I enjoyed both the mashed potatoes and the spinach.  I would order these again!\n\nI guess our server felt bad about forgetting the shrimp cocktail (and not that I was craving it or anything), so she brought our a cheesecake with berries for my birthday \"cake.\" It had caramelized sugar on top and it was so moist that it just broke apart with your fork.  I don't like cheesecake really, but this was very good.  I didn't have a cocktail because I had been drinking most of the day and my tummy wasn't feeling so hot earlier, so I thought I'd take it easy, so I can have a pleasant rest of the night.\n\nThe service was okay and nothing over the top or spectacular.  Staff was attentive enough.\n\nI may visit one of the CG's here in L.A./O.C. At least I know what goodness awaits me."

The wine list is tasteful with half bottle's available. Do to the fact that we expect and require stellar service, we also request a Sr. Server to tend to our table. With this, we have yet to be disappointed with the service. \nOur coarse usually consists of the French Onion Soup, which comes in a large portion (enough to share), House Salad, Crab Cakes and the Fillet Mignon. We enjoy our steaks cooked medium and unlike a lot of other steak houses, the temp is just right every time. The Au Gratin Potatoes are sinfully delectable and quite a treat. \nA definite recommendation for a quiet couple's night in Vegas!"

We arrived early, and our table was ready for us. We were seated at a table with a view of the strip decorated with heart confetti and a handwritten  card. Our waiter, Raul, brought us a bread basket and complimentary  champagne. Service was impeccable! Raul was attentive but allowed us plenty of time to enjoy our meal in privacy. We dined on raw oysters, Delmonico steak for hubby, filets with butter poached lobster tails for me, roasted Brussels  sprouts  to share, and a complimentary dessert. Steaks were perfect and oysters were very fresh. Minor complaint (being picky here) was Brussels sprouts were a bit crunchy for our taste, but spot on with flavor.\n\nGreat experience, food, and service! Perfect Anniversary dinner!

Was surprised that the server did not notice this, but he didn't complain when she asked how we were all doing. I ordered the special of the night, which was a 10oz ribeye. Server came back to say they were all out of the specials, so there were two other ribeye choices on the menu. I didn't have the menu to look at anymore, so she recommended I order the ribeye that my husband wasn't already getting. It ended up to be a 22oz kona rubbed. I had no idea they would use coffee grounds; I just kept wondering why the surface had the consistency of dirt. I figured it out once I looked it up later. Frankly, I'd rather have a steak from Chili's. My husband was not too happy with his ribeye. I think it had a porcini sauce that he thought was too sweet. Our other friend had a filet, and she had no complaints. We also ordered the lobster Mac n cheese, which we order pretty much anywhere we go that has it; it was just meh. I had the spinach salad, which was also just ok. I have had better at Applebee's. We also had the truffle fries, but they were not very crispy or impressive. Yikes!

The lobster tail did not have much flavor to it, but it still tasted good but not as amazing as the tenderloin.

She was okay in the beginning but she got better as the night went on.  We normally dont require much attention as long as our water is refilled we are pretty much set for the rest of the night.  \n\nATMOSPHERE (3.8 out of 5) \nIt was a busy night full of commotion and talks and laughter filled the room.  I enjoyed it.  I like the paintings/portraits on the wall and they had a locker for wine which was pretty cool. \n\nOVERALL (4 out of 5)\nI liked it here, but it wont be my first choice that I would go to if I wanted to eat out."

He recommended the asparagus citrus bisque, which I have to say was absolutely amazing. I was well cared for as I dined solo. I highly recommend dining here during your stay in Vegas as a fine dining experience. the chef offered a note to me as well. I thought it was a nice gesture. I will be back and sure to ask for my favorite server Charles."

They had probably 5-6 different types of bread in a basket, so if you're picky about your grains, you have options. A friend and I split the Delmonico steak and Lobster Mac & Cheese (AND an entire bottle of wine... YOLO!) I appreciate that the staff here knew we were splitting, so they came out with the steak cut in half for us. The food was great! Steak was cooked perfectly and the Lobster Mac & Cheese was not lacking in lobster and was probably the best lobster mac & cheese I've ever had in my entire life (I've only had it about maybe 4 times, though). We were so stuffed afterwards. \n\nI docked one star because of an incident we saw while they were seating another table. The couple was seated in a booth that did not have place settings, so I believe it was the manager at the time that shot the server a nasty look, kind of like \"Why the hell would you seat them there. Are you dumb?\" I kind of felt bad for the server because there was nothing she could do. It almost felt degrading. And on top of that, the manager wasn't hiding her emotions. Basically anyone in the restaurant could have seen it happen. If you have constructive criticism, do it behind closed doors. Not where people can openly see you treat someone with a nasty attitude. Hope the employees here are treated well!"

Chopped Salad - romaine and iceberg lettuces, corn, asparagus tips, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, crunchy parmesan croutons, all served with a side of house made ranch...Fresh and lovely.\n2.

The service here is superior to most other fine dining chains... some of which are hard to top! To make mine and my husband's anniversary special and memorable, they sprinkled little hearts on the white linen table, had glasses of champagne waiting for us, and completed our meal with a complimentary berry cheesecake.\n\nI love when a variety is offered in the bread basket, and you get quite a range of flavors here from raison pumpernickel to chopped olives baked in. So good to carb out on! When on vacation, we like to splurge... so we ordered our very own salads instead of spitting one before the meal. ;-) I had the caprese while my husband went with a caesar. Both were a perfect start! I'm a filet kind of girl AND I'm a lobster kind of girl. So it was an easy choice for me to go with the lobster topped filet medallions. I would get it again in a heartbeat! My husband went with a simple filet, which tasted anything but simple. We split a side of the cheesy au gratin potatoes. They are some of the best I've ever had... and I've had a fair share of cheesy potatoes in my time! As previously mentioned, we enjoyed a piece of thick, New York style cheesecake plated with fresh berries. Though we were stuffed from our meal, it was too good not to finish the entire slice of cake.\n\nCapital Grille... please, please, PLEASE come to St. Louis! I miss you already!"

I typically don't prefer to go to chain restaurants, but it is definitely one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to!\n\nMy family and I made dinner reservations at The Capital Grille for New Years Eve.  It turned out to be the perfect place for such an occasion!  The food was out of this world, the ambiance was relaxing and wonderful, and the service was flawless!\n\nThe restaurant is located on an upper floor of the Fashion Show mall on the Vegas Strip.  The inside of The Capital Grille is decorated very nicely.  The restaurant has windows from the floor to the ceiling, which offer a great view of the Strip!  Our reservations were for 5:30 p.m.  It was nice because we got to watch the Vegas strip fade from daytime to all lit up and sparkling at night.\n\nThe food- oh my goodness.  Everything was divine.  My table started with the fried calamari.  The calamari was served without any dipping sauces.  We were confused at first, but quickly realized why.  The golden calamari was served covered in a hot cherry pepper sauce.  It was amazing!\n\nAs my entree, I ordered the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails (Their version of Surf n Turf).  The meal was perfection.  I had my meal with a side of the Lobster Mac n Cheese- one of the best I've ever had- and I pretty much order Lobster Mac n Cheese whenever I see it on a menu!  It was so crispy and flavorful.\n\nMy mom ordered the Fresh Maine Lobster.  My sister ordered the chef's suggestion- Bone In Ribeye in a 15-Year Aged Balsamic.  I tried both and they were equally delicious!\n\nWe somehow saved room for dessert.  Actually, we did not.  The meal to that point had just been so great that we knew we had to try the last course they had to offer.  Once we heard that the desserts were made in house, we were sold.  We split the Capital Grille Cheesecake with mixed berries.  The cheesecake was made brulee-style, with the crispy sugary top.  It was literally the best piece of cheesecake I've ever had.\n\nAs if the food wasn't enough of a selling point, the service was so great.  Our server's name was Juan.  Juan was extremely attentive and friendly.  He provided professional service, but maintained a down to earth disposition.\n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good steak or seafood dinner in Vegas.  It is pricier than average, but so worth it!"

BALLIN'. \n\nService was up-to-par and timely. When it came time to inquire about wines, I always like to ask for suggestions and almost without fail, servers will upsell and recommend the two highest priced wines. Initially I decided to pass on the wine as I already was struggling with a (really stiff!) Manhattan but after a couple bites of my steak, I waved another server down (ours was clearly occupied with the next table which had a party of 6, so I didn't want to interrupt her with my inability to make decisions the first go around) who asked if I liked Malbecs. \"ABSOLUTELY\". It was priced well, he mentioned it was one of his favourites and since it was not the most pricey wine on the list, I trusted his recommendation. It was a fabulous pairing. \n\nWe ordered french onion soup (cheesy goodness) which had a nice depth of flavour and wasn't overly salty, the lobster bisque special (this went really well with the Manhattans, strangely), and both of us had filet mignon with mine medium-rare. \n\nGreat, well-rounded experience."

The manager came by and talked to me. He assured me that this was highly unusual and he would investigate it further. Thinking he would just give me an excuse, I was surprised when he apologized and would replace my lobster with a new one. I just wanted to trade in 2 claws for more tail but he gave me everything to make sure I was happy. Kuddos guys because actions like this makes me happy to spend 30 minutes of my life to tell all the restaurant goers to eat here.

However, when I saw that there was one in Las Vegas while searching for a place to fine dine in Vegas, I immediately booked a reservation to celebrate my recent promotion.  Once we arrrived, we were seated immediately.  Our table was decorated with foil confetti in the shape of balloons and there was a card sealed with wax to congratulate me on my promotion.  I am impressed by this because I was expecting a table with a view that I requested since we were having a late dinner, but not the decorated table because I thought it was usually birthdays and anniversaries that  are given this.  We definitely had a nice view of the Las Vegas Strip.  Our waiter, Eric, was amazing!  He was very attentive to us even though he had to tend to a number of tables.  He took the time to explain how we can go through the wine list via a tablet.  He also suggested food items that we might enjoy and so we ordered some of these items and wow....delicious I must say!  Everything we ordered was very tasty...fresh oysters on a half shell, lobster bisque, kona rib eye, chilean sea bass, lobster mac and cheese, and brussel spouts!  Of course we couldn't eat everything so we brought it back to our hotel and stored it in the fridge for late night snacking.  Each item we brought back was boxed and labeled with the name of the food item and the bag had an attached label signed by the chef.  Wow!  Never seen that before and we've been fine dining forever.  Last but not least...we ordered the coconut dessert the I saw people raving about and it was exactly what I expected! Yummy!  To make it even better, Eric said it was on the house due to my promotion!  The \"wow\" factor kept going through the night, but the only negative thing was that after we were served our wine, it took at least 45 min to receive our appetizers.  However, I didn't take away any stars for this since everything else was amazing!"

That is the only bad thing I can say about our visit and why it didn't get 5 stars (since I hate waiting). \nOur drinks ordered at the bar were free and were taken to our table which had candies all over it and a birthday card with well wishes. Our view was amazing since we were seated in a booth that looked out to the Wynn. Everything was cooked to our liking: buttery steak, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. Lovely dinner at a classic steak restaurant. I'd return but probably to their LA location for a special occasion since it's a bit pricey."

My boyfriend was boring and just got a crown and coke. I opted for their special stol-doli. It is pineapple infused vodka and they make it themselves. It was so smooth and good. Whenever I drink vodka, I usually cringe because I hate the taste of it. This drink was so smooth that you couldn't even taste the vodka! Its dangerous, I ended up having two without any thought haha For our appetizers we got a caesar salad and lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was so buttery and creamy and full of lobster chunks. I had ordered the salad but ended up taking the bisque from the boo lol Fo rmy main dish I got the tenderloin with lobster. It comes with two 4 ounce filet mignons and a lobster on top of each. It was very juicy and tender. Literally melt in your mouth. The boyfriend got the dry aged kona rubbed (im pretty sure I messed that up) bone in ribeye. IT WAS SOOOO GOOOD. We are cming back in two weeks just to eat this again. Yeah. It was that good. We also got the lobster mac and cheese which was so good. I am severely lactose intolerant so just imagine what I had to go through to eat this. But I ate most of it despite the consequences I would face later. lol. We had no room for dessert but we took the rest home. When you take it home, they attach this little card signed by the chef. My name is Sarah and my boyfriend's name is Rocco....the chef's name was SACCO! It was meant for us to eat here haha"

Its a great place to have a family lunch/ dinner. the staff was so friendly and welcoming; they didn't even make us wait, they sat us right away.\n\nI wish I remembered our servers name but she was phenomenal! she was so attentive and ready to answer any questions we had about menu items. I decided to order the French onion soup (Best I've ever had! I wish I ordered a bowl) and lobster and crab cake sandwich (It was okay), My mother ordered the burger (Delicious), My little sister ordered the filet mignon (Made to perfection), and my father ordered the clam chowder (So good!) and prim rib sandwich (The best meal at the table; wish I ordered this!). Prior to us ordering, however my father was complaining about the cheese on the sandwich, which if you knew my father at all he is extremely picky! So our waitress decided to bring him out a sample of the cheese that would come on the sandwich, lo and behold.. he loved it! I thank her for actually getting him to try something new! Once we were all done with our meals our server decided to bring us a complimentary cheesecake. this cheesecake was the most creamiest cheesecake I've ever eaten, words cannot even explain how delicious it was! \n\nOverall I give this restaurant a 5 star rating! I give it 5 stars because of its excellence, quality, cleanliness, and amazing staff! I will definitely be coming back on my next Vegas trip!"

Upon entering you notice all of the wine lockers; lockers with peoples names on them to store wine for them...I want one!  The hostess was friendly and happy to seat us without reservations, even put us at a window seat.  The view of the Strip and the Wynn is delightful and so pretty at night.  Our servers were attentive and their suggestions were perfection.  We enjoyed the Generous Pour (1/2 of July and all of August) at only $28 (I think) a person.  I didn't even know I liked white wine until I paired it with my calamari.  The hubby and I shared a salad and a bone in filet (rubbed in Kona coffee) and a few side dishes.  There side dishes are fantastic here especially the lobster mac-n-cheese!  I also very much enjoyed the pineapple infused rum.  This place is now in my top 5 and I will be back frequently."

The place was dark much like many steak houses, but this was more upscale.  The appetizers were good, but small in portion.  The steaks were pretty good, but I honestly had better.  Cost was off the hook.  I'm not cheap, but to pay this much for a steak that I feel is better at another place is ridiculous.\n\nAnyway, if you want to impress someone, take them here for the view of the strip, ambiance and the the high prices.  Don't forget to valet as well.  If you just want to eat a good steak, go elsewhere."

The interior reminds me of a man cave... like a very manly den back in the 50's!  I really loved that aspect of it.  The entire place is surrounded by huge windows to give you a great view............unless you're on the side facing the construction that's been sitting there for years.  Pretty sure they didn't bank on that happening when they built this place!\n\nIf you have an anniversary or other special occasion, they decorate your table all cute! Very romantic ;-)\n\nOur server was amazing.  He was extremely friendly and didn't give off that snooty attitude that you sometimes get at fancy steak restaurants.  He explained the menu in detail, which usually I don't care for, but he was extremely helpful!  \n\nI got the seared tenderloin with lobster.  Be aware that the portion size is very small (he informed me this dish was \"for the ladies,\" and when I asked him why he explained that it was on the smaller side, so I was prepared.  Thanks again, helpful server!).  Despite this, I could only eat half of it, which was a huge shame because I couldn't take my leftovers with me :(  This was one of the most delicious meals I've had in my entire life.  My boyfriend's steak was also completely to die for.  We topped that off with the lobster mac and cheese, and oh my gosh- it was a meal to remember.\n\nThe only forgettable part about it was the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  Maybe we got a bad one, but it tasted like dirt and was completely the wrong texture- kind of grainy.  The only part that tasted good was the glaze on the top, so we scraped that part off and left the rest.  We probably should have said something, but I hate doing that so we didn't.\n\nTL;DR I highly recommend Capital Grille and will be back time and time again for a romantic date :)"

Because the cabs in Vegas are so dirty we wanted to be able to walk to a restaurant.  Since the Capital Grille is directly across the street from the Wynn Towers our choice was easily made.  We have never eaten at a Capital Grille, which , according to the manager Mathew Foody (yes, that is his real last name),  has 50 locations.  The entire meal was wonderful.  We first ordered the Prosciutto wrapped Mozzarella.  It was so good and enhanced with the fresh bread basket.  We also ordered a bottle of wine.  The cab was a 2009 Markham from Napa Valley.  At $48 I thought the price was very reasonable.  \nAfter eating this large portioned appetizer we decided to split the dry aged Porterhouse steak.  Again we were not disappointed. Ordering it medium rare the meat melted in your mouth. The creamed spinach side was to die for. We passed on the desert menu and instead had an after dinner drink in their beautiful bar.  Jessica, our waitperson, was the best.   She was very attentive and explained the menu with ease. She made our evening memorable.  Also, the manager kept checking on us to make sure we were thoroghly enjoying our dinner.  Kudos to Capital Grille in Las Vegas.  We will be back."

He complained to us the whole time.  \nSave it buddy.  I'm out in 110 Vegas heat, and want a cool, inviting experience.  Even though we told him we're Denver regulars, he treated us like tourists.  Ignored us for a couple of local women who obviously drink there often.\nOur service went from bad to horrible after I ordered the $13 glass of wine instead of the $23 glass he recommended.  \nUp sell someone else.  I know my wines, and will not pay $23 a glass for a $23 a bottle of wine.   ( I know...I know, my $13 a glass is $13 a bottle, but we all have our price points).\nBad service aside, my lobster bisque was lukewarm at best; globby and mediocre.  The sherry accompaniment never came, so we had to flag the waiter.  10 minutes later, someone from the kitchen brought it.  By that time, the soup was really cold.\nThe BF's burger was perfect cooked -- medium rare and huge.\nHowever the fries were inedible.  \n\nThe waiter never appeared with the check, so I flagged him down on my way to the rest room, and signed on my way back.\nUnfortunately, he kept my credit card...\nI've always said, customer service will either make or break a business, and the way the Capital Grille handled the error is 1 star.\nThe next day I returned for the card ( a $40 round trip cab ride).  The manager who was holding the card was tacky; not in a hurry to return the card, so we sat down for lunch.  \nFinally he arrived at our table, and had the nerve to suggest I offer a reward.\nReward???\nHow about tearing up the check for the previous day.  Or at least comping up lunch that day.  Your waiter caused us great inconvenience, and for what?  A mediocre lunch, terrible service, and a huge price tag.\n\nI'm hoping that corporate has a better 'tude, since I still want to patronize the Denver location\n\nps\nWe were \"invited\" back for lunch......AT THE VEGAS LOCATION.\nSure, let me jump in my corporate jet and lunch in Vegas.\nThanks for nothing.\nTypical Olive Garden mentality....that's what Darden Corporation is making the Cap Grille.  \nYou have just won my tacky award"

Total came to $120/head, all in.  Reasonable.  I had an 8oz fillet that was topped with approx 3oz of deliciously fresh crab meat that just had a hint of a delicious sauce.  What a great combo.  Not revolutionary, but the steak came out perfect to my order (M-rare) and was of very high quality beef.  Definitely a top 10 steak for me of all time.  \n\nPlease request a strip view and take some time to look over the well stocked wine list.   You will be right across from the Wynn and have a beautiful sight in front of you.\n\nThis was the beginning of our Vegas trip and set things off right."

My boyfriend and I celebrated my birthday here, they gave us a secluded table complete with a card from the chef, decor, complimentary champagne and dessert. Our waiter, Charles, was extremely hospitable and made wonderful suggestions, giving us a great overall experience. The food was something else, we both enjoyed the calamari, seared tenderloin and poached lobster, potatoes au gratin, and asparagus. All cooked to perfection. Well worth the price and deserving of another visit. Thank you!"

The knife slid into the meat like butter. It was cooked exactly how I asked for. The sides, mashed potatoes and lobster mac, were equally as delicious. The lobster chunks were fresh and not chewy, like I've experienced at other restaurants. This is really as good as it gets for steak, and the service was also exceptional. Other restaurants should look here for what to do, it's all too common to experience bad food at high end restaurants when that should not be the case."

So, when I saw that there was one directly across the street from my hotel in Vegas I thought \"hey, why not!\" The room wasn't ready yet anyway, and I was famished so I headed over.\n\nSitting at the bar, because there's no better place to meet people and have a good time in any Vegas restaurant, I ordered my newly discovered favorite appetizer - the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella. The flavor was great (it was cheese wrapped in meat after all) but the presentation was not quite up to Seattle standards. I guess maybe they don't need to try as hard because they've been around for several more years than their Seattle counterpart.\n\nOverall the restaurant itself was very similar (surprise, it's a chain) with dark wood, brass, and paintings of famous people, most of which I don't even recognize. But it does come off a little cheesy, especially seeing that the Vegas Capital Grille is located in a mall. Oh well. At least I still have Seattle!"

She was very welcoming in greeting us upon our arrival and showing us to our table overlooking the Strip.  This place does have very nice dark wooded decor.  After our stellar arrival, the visit became just average.  I ordered grilled salmon and it was very dry and bland.  I have had better at much less expensive restaurants.  Our server (I don't recall her name) was not very friendly and had an abrasive personality.  She was efficient enough, but not enough to make up for the lackluster food that came at a very high price tag!  I have had better meals at Applebee's for far less money!  In short, don't believe the hype about this place.  Save your money and go somewhere else in Vegas that always delivers well in food quality and service, such as Billy Bob's Steakhouse at Sam's Town!"

Had more claw meat than expected but still good. they even brought out extra sherry to tweak it to our liking. \n\n3. Filet Oscar- My husband had this entree. The crab was really good. He said it was really good. \n\n4. A La Carte Side - Creamed Corn- Very good. It was double roasted so there was good flavor and a bit of a crunch. Needed a bit of salt. But as expected. Reminded me of my mom's creamed corn which it is a good thing.\n\n5. Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tail - This was my entree and it was delicious. The steak was tender and cooked to perfection. The lobster was also tender and was a generous portion. \n\nAll and all the experience was amazing and worth the money. They pamper you and show keen attention to detail. I look forward to coming here in the future. Jeff even brought out samples of a drink that was really refreshing.

We had visions of walking through the food court to find this restaurant.  It turns out that it has its own private entrance.  This may sound petty to some, but when you are spending a lot of money for a meal, the last thing you want is to be walking by Panda Express on your way in the door.  The restaurant has a lovely view of the Wynn, and we could see the mountains to the north from our booth.  \n\nThe service and food was outstanding.  I can't say enough good things about our server, Francisco.  He recommended the \"Summer Generous Pour\" --  a flight of eight wines -- three whites and five reds.   A two-ounce pour of each wine is served at different stages of your meal.  We especially liked the Chardonnay, and Francisco was happy to pour us a little more.  My husband drank Scotch.  We made just one order of the wine sampling and found it was plenty for the two of us.\n\nMy husband ordered the NY strip with the Gorgonzola and truffle crust with a Cabernet reduction.  It was cooked medium rare to perfection.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass in a tomato and saffron broth.  The fish was flaky and tender.  The broth was deliciously savory without being overpowering.  This dish was a lovely, light, and flavorful dish for those who seek alternatives to steak.  We split a side of creamed spinach, noting the smoky hints of nutmeg.  The consistency was just right, being neither too stiff nor too runny.\n\nWe finished the meal with the coconut cream pie.  It was very good but, as a coconut dessert fan, a tad underwhelming.  If you want the bomb coconut dessert in Vegas, have the coconut cake at Mesa Grill.\n\nThe service was outstanding at Capital Grill.  We didn't want to be rushed and told Francisco that we wanted to take our time.  Dining to us is an experience that should be savored.  Pun intended.    It pains us to see Americans come in to upscale restaurants, scarf down dinner in 45 minutes, and leave.  If you have a show to go to in Vegas and also want a special dinner, have dinner after the show.  It's a crime to have dinner at a place like Capital Grill and choke down a meal in under an hour.\n\nWe will absolutely be back to Capital Grill and recommend it to anyone seeking a special meal where you will be attended to as if you were royalty."

I started my meal with the salty and sour prosciutto wrapped melted Mozzarella that was evenly balanced with the sweetness of the mini vine ripe tomatoes and crostini.  I also had the garlicky fried calamari with cherry peppers.  It wasn't as spicy as I expected, but the tangy peppers added kick to the calamari.  For a salad, I had to have the stinky stuff....sweet onions on thick slices of tomatoes that was sprinkled with a Vinaigrette and roquefort cheese...so delicious.  I followed this with the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico Steak with 8-Year Aged Balsamic.  I asked for a medium which turned out a little more drier and cooked than I expected.  It seems they run more on the well done side, rather than most restaurants running mor to the rare side.  This brought it down to 3 stars.  I also accompanied the steak with some creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin.  The stars went back to 4 after finishing off with.the most delicious coconut cream pie.

I was a bit disappointed when they told me we were going to some boring, stale steak restaurant.  You open any magazine in Vegas and you'll see some exotic piece of unicorn meat teetering on top of a fragile stack of vegetables and painstakingly dotted with exotic sauces (is that mango?  Some chive oil?).  All of this is topped with a lacy piece of flair made out of something I'd never heard of or ever suspected was edible.  \n\nHo-hum.  Another steak place.  So I thought I already knew what great steak was.  Capital Grille proved me wrong.  We tried practically every appetizer and side they offered on the menu.  Everything was beyond delicious.  Beyond fresh.  Beyond beautiful.  All meaning I stuffed myself beyond silly.  \n\nHappy Appies:  \n\nSmoked Salmon\nShrimp Cocktail\nOysters\nProscuitto Wrapped Mozzarella with Tomatoes and Balsamic Glaze\nSteak Tartare\n\nShamefully, I admit to having more than one gluttonous bite of each of the above...plus I split a delicious spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  Main course?  What main course?  Oh yeah, how could I forget?  I had a perfectly prepared Filet Oscar which was a beautifully prepared filet (medium rare of course) stuffed with crab stacked on top of tender asparagus and drizzled with hollandaise.  My husband had the Grille Delmonico which was a mouth-watering rib-eye with an earthy porcini mushroom rub.  Absolutely incredible.  Oh, and lobster mac and cheese and truffled parmesan French fries?  I was in heaven.  As if I had not done enough damage to my insides, then came dessert.  About five or six of them came around the table.  I'm a big chocolate fan and they certainly did their chocolate desserts justice with their chocolate hazelnut cake and their flourless espresso chocolate cake, but their coconut cream pie was to die for.  \n\nMy only gripe about this place - any nice restaurant I've been to in Vegas has an amazing bar with incredible bartenders.  This place didn't.  My husband's mojito was not muddled correctly and was waaay too sweet as was my lemon-drop martini.  The mojito was not even drinkable.    The bartender didn't apologize when we had to send the mojito back and didn't ask if we wanted something else instead.   I want to knock off one star for the prick, but the rest of the experience was so good it just doesn't seem fair.  Especially since dinner service was stellar and our waitress was friendly, rolled with the punches for our large group, and definitely took care of us.  \n\nI would definitely come back to this place - even with all the other enticing restaurant ads in town - Capital Grille taught me that \"classic\" doesn't mean \"boring.\"  They made that lesson pleasant to learn.  But be warned - wear your dessert pants."

The restaurant was not very busy at the time we visited( we had early dinner so we could catch a show). The poor review is directly attributed to our server Alex. \nAlex seemed to be a bit of a cold fish with his presentations of the nightly specials. He did not offer explanations of the different chef recommendations, and he was not engaging. He made it seem as if it was a chore to serve us.\nI was willing to attribute this to a flat personality until another table of diners arrived. Alex transformed into a totally different person. He really turned on the charm, engaging this party about their likes and dislikes, as well as offering variations on the different preparations. \nThis experience was disappointing to say the least. I am not sure why Alex was so unwelcoming as we we're visitors and I had not dined at this location before. Hopefully the other locations will have the service that Capital Grille is known for."

Easy choice due to my last review details of class, extraordinary service, food quality and reservations.\n\n2.  Last night, I was in \"trouble\" because we were taking my son out for dinner for his 18th birthday with his friends. I was feeling a bit generous as he is doing so well in school, his friends are great and so, we wanted to have something special.\n\n3.  Special meant, on the strip, good view, great food, feeling pampered and special.\n\n4.  I made reservations at the last minute, 5:00 pm for a 7:30 pm dinner. Why, because i needed class and where we were going wasn't special enough.\n\n5.  I asked for a window seat due to my son's birthday. They did not promise, however, they said they would request.\n\n6.  Here is what we got...\n\na.  Best table seat in the whole restaurant. Right in the corner with great views.\nb.  A birthday card with a nice touch, a wax seal envelope, that wished my kid happy birthday and thanking him for dining with them.\nc.  The service was beyond extraordinary. It was simply staggeringly special.\nd.  The food, was beyond really good. It was just right.  We had the Delmonico (bone in rib eye), the Porcini rubbed Delmonico (dry rubbed porcini finished with a 12 year balsamic dressing), sliced Filet Migon, Calamari, and Prosciutto wrapped Mozzarella as starters.  For sides, we had the Lobster Mac and Cheese, the Au Gratin Potatoes, Truffle Fries and Creamed Spinach.\n\n\nI guess, when all said and done, the best review is from the young men...\"Best Steak ever\".  OK, while we know that they haven't been to all the best steak places in LV to qualify, the fact is that it was great and I have been to many  steak places in the world.\n\nPeople, when you are looking for an experience, this is the place.  Kudos to Tiffany for taking my reservation and making it special.  Kudos for Eric who helped us make decisions, and made for a great evening.\n\nThanks Capital Grill for making our night so great.  It doesn't get better in my book and Happy Birthday son!"

The filet mignon was cooked to perfection. The oysters were fresh and super tasty. The mozzarella, tomato and basil salad was great. We ordered asparagus and mashed potatoes as our side dishes and oh heaven! I love that they had 1/2 bottles of some great wines, perfect for one person when no one else at your table wants to drink the same thing. We went for a birthday celebration and they brought a very nice birthday dessert out. The service was excellent, as you would expect. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is that it is so expensive...over $100 per person. Worth it though for a special occasion!"

The Food & Service has always been awesome!  We ask to be seated with Frankie from Philly he is a professional, funny and awesome waiter.  My Husband always gets the Oysters & I a salad for appetizers.  As for the entree my husband always gets a steak (always tries different ones) as for me I always get the chicken Entree.  Over the past several years they have changed the Chicken  dish but they never disappoint it is always moist and delicious.  The grilled Asparagus is to die for. \nWine selection is fantastic!!!!! \nLooking forward to our next visit to Vegas an another exceptional meal at The Capital Grill!!!"

They knew it was our anniversary and they had rose petals and a card laid out for us on our table. The card read \"thank you for celebrating with us, from the Capital Grill.\" The server even came up to us and gave us some complimentary sparkling wine for our celebration. I was in awe at how well we were treated. \n\nI ordered the veal and my bf ordered the lamb chops. We opted for creamed spinach and Au gratin potatoes for our sides. \n\nWhile we waited for the food (which was a pretty quick wait) they gave us a complimentary bread assortment which was pretty tasty. \n\nThe food came out and I astonished; It looked so delicious! And boy did it taste even better! Both of our plates were bursting with flavor, and the sides were an awesome compliment. \n\nThe server checked up on us every 10 minutes or so to fill up our glasses and make sure everything was perfect. When we were almost done with our plates he told us to save some room because they had a \"surprise\" for us. Of course that put a couple big smiles on our faces!\n\nWe were just about done with our food when the server brought out a center cut piece of creme brulee cheesecake with a candle placed right in the middle for us. He said it was on the house from Capital Grill and that they hoped we really enjoyed our anniversary. \n\nMmmm, that cheesecake was sooo delicious! My mouth is drooling just thinking about it!\n\nWe had an exceptional dining experience here. I've never had such incredible service anywhere. I hope they stay the way that they are because we'll be sure to come back very soon!\n\nThank you for making our anniversary so wonderful!"

They brought out an iPad with their wine menu and boy do they have a lot of wines to select from. We started with French onion soup which was over salted and had to send it back. We asked for another one to be made but they said it would be the same as it is made from the same broth. We ordered a Caesar salad and it was delicious. Next came out the steak and it was very tender. Prices are  a bit pricey but what do you expect? It's Vegas and all restaurants are pricey. Overall the food was good and I would come back."

To start, we got seated right at the window looking north up the strip, and we could see the Wynn and Encore across the street.  It might have been romantic, if I wasn't dining with a couple other guys...\n\nThe ambiance was nice - like a quiet version of Fleming's with a touch of the Rat Pack.  Paintings of notable faces from the old days of Vegas hung on the walls in various corners of the restaurant.  Speaking of Fleming's, the menu resembled theirs in format and pricing.  The service was exceptional - very attentive, but not overbearing.\n\nI got the lamb chops, which were outstanding!  I ordered med-rare, and they came very pink and warm - perfect!  They served it with a cherry compote, which was a perfect compliment - I'm not a fan of the mint jelly that often accompanies lamb.  One of my friends ordered the Delmonico steak, which is a 22 oz bone-in ribeye.  All of their beef is dry-aged in-house.  As good as my lamb was, I was coveting that steak, and he said it was great.\n\nI will return to this establishment and enjoy another great meal on my next trip."

The bread that they started us off with was by far the worst that we've had in any steakhouse. We then ordered the calamari which was very good. After hearing about the two specials my husband and I each ordered one. Unfortunately when they came out they were each cooked wrong. We thought that maybe they just got the order mixed up. He ordered his rare and I ordered mine medium. It wasn't that big of a deal to us so we were just going to trade meals. The strange thing was that my meal came with two 7oz fillets and they were each cooked totally different. We didn't complain because everything still tasted good. We shared the mashed potatoes and they were delicious! We then shared the cheesecake which was super amazing!"

We can't comment much on the steak at this time because we couldn't taste the steak this time. But we want to praise them for their great service and professionalism. 4 stars all go to their service. Not 5 star yet because we can't comment on the steak yet.....maybe 5 stars next time after we go back again next time. Please read on for what they have done right below:\n\n\nWe ordered steaks but couldn't really taste it as we ordered our steak medium well, but the steak came out burned outside and rare inside. My husband's was a porterhouse, and mine was a rib-eye. my rib-eye did have a portion that is more like a medium, so I ate that part, at least still better than the steak I had earlier somewhere for lunch. My husband's porterhouse was medium on the edge, and pretty rare when it got closer to the bone. We didn't want to ask for cooking them more as the outside was very burned up (basically black). So we tried to eat the part that is more like a medium, and considered taking the rare part home, But when we got to the pretty rare part, we were still hungry and we think we couldn't handle the bloody taste anymore, it was also hard to chew on with the rareness, so we asked them to grill them some more. I guess at that point, they noticed that the steaks were burned outside and rare inside (they probably wonder why we didn't say anything earlier), and after grilling them some more, the outside got even more black and the inside was not yet medium well. So the manager came out and apologized to us very professionally and sincerely. And they said they would take care of the steaks. We were a bit surprised because we haven't experienced such kind of professionalism in restaurants for quite a long time. And they still continue to serve us sincerely after they said they would take care of the steaks. The server still kept saying happy birthday to me, and they still gave me the complimentary birthday dessert after they said they would pay for our steaks. The dessert tasted good and the presentation was good too. So at the end, there was no bill at all and we could have just walked away without paying anything. They didn't even leave a tab on the table at the end (the black thing that holds the bill when you ask for the check), meaning they are not pressuring us to leave tip. What a good ethics and attitude! In fact, we wanted to tip them even more instead because of all the good business ethics and professional service! We estimated how much the meal would have been if the steaks didn't come out wrong, then we calculate the tip off that amount. I think we gave more than 20% tip. They deserve the tip money though the steaks came out as a mistake. Since there was no tab, we gave the tip directly to the server. \n\nThere was no upsetness though the steaks were messed up. We were pleased and we think we would go back again to give it a try again in the future. Again, professionalism and service are very crucial in restaurant business. Of course good food is important too."

The food and service definitely rated up there with the other fine steakhouses where I've dined in the past.\n\nWe made a reservation for the start of brunch service and were promptly seated next to the window. The window gave some nice people watching opportunities while we dined. The atmosphere of the restaurant was upscale, but not in a stuffy way. It was nice that other diners had dressed nicely for the occasion and the restaurant was drawing a classy crowd.\n\nThe service was very attentive from beginning to end. Our waiter was friendly, drinks were constantly refilled, plates were cleared regularly, and our meal flowed nicely. Not a single hiccup with the service. The manager/owner(?) was also walking around checking on each table which is always a nice touch.\n\nBrunch began with a Bellini and the bread basket. My Bellini didn't disappoint and I enjoyed the breads. I opted for the Bibb Salad that had plenty of greens, dried cherries, blue cheese, and vinaigrette. It was a simple salad, but well prepared. My husband enjoyed his Caesar salad as well.\n\nMy entr\u00e9e was what really impressed me. I had the 8 oz. Filet Mignon with mashed potatoes. My steak was the perfect size and perfectly prepared to medium rare as I requested. The seasoning had a wonderful flavor as well. I would say this was one of the best steaks I've ever had. The mashed potatoes had great flavor and a nice creaminess. My husband had the Lobster Frittata. This was served with a potato cake layer, frittata layer, and more lobster on top. Beautiful presentation and delicious as well. The truffled hollandaise was served on the side without even requesting it which was a nice touch.\n\nI ventured out a little with dessert and went with the Espresso Chocolate Cake. This was very rich and had more of a fudge like consistency. I enjoyed it, but I think two could split it since it is so rich. My husband's Cr\u00e8me Brulee had a strong custard flavor and fresh berries on top. He loved this dessert.\n\nI've been missing out by passing on this spot for years. Absolutely awesome service and food."

I was in the mood for steak, so we took a chance on the Capital Grille, of which there is a sister location in Boston, where we live.  I wasn't excited about going to a chain restaurant, even an upscale one, but we were pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  She directed me to a delicious red wine, and had no problem at all with my boyfriend and me sharing a couple of appetizers and an entree, an action that might be frowned upon in other more upscale eateries.  They separated the steak in half prior to cooking it, which was unexpected and wonderful, and gave it to us on two different plates without us having to ask.  The appetizers we shared, the Spinach Salad and the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, were both great, and actually quite a lot of food, in addition to the warm, fresh bread we were given upon ordering drinks.\n\nThe star of the meal, the 14 oz. Dry-Aged Sirloin, was cooked to perfection, and the Parmesan Truffle Fries we ordered as a side, were delectable, though we couldn't finish them.\n\nOur only issue, and this was a minor one, was that almost immediately after we were seated, and despite an otherwise pretty empty restaurant, a table of four relatively obnoxious people were seated directly next to us.  This might have been more of an issue if the restaurant had remained quiet, but we must have come at the right time, since in the next hour or so, the restaurant filled up quickly, and the irritating folks next to us were drowned out to some extent.\n\nI would recommend the Capital Grille to anyone.  It's a classy place with a great menu."

We ordered everything he suggested and we were not disappointed. \n\nFor drinks my boyfriend ordered a beer and Erik suggested a pineapple infused vodka drink that was served straight up in a chilled martini glass. It was delicious. The perfect blend of tangy and sweet. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the lobster bisque and the wedge salad. Erik added some sherry to my lobster bisque at the table that really brought out the rich flavor of the soup. I had a couple bites of the wedge salad and it was crisp and refreshing. Both were perfect portions.\n\nFor our entrees we had the Delmonico steak which is their bone in rib eye and the Filet Oscar which was a filet topped with blue crab meat and a Bearnaise sauce served with asparagus spears. Both entrees tasted amazing. The rib eye had excellent flavor and even the slight char from the grill tasted good. The crab meat on the Fillet Oscar was sweet and the flavors flowed together perfectly.\n\nWe also shared the sides of creamed spinach and creamy mashed potatoes. They complimented our meals nicely and tasted really fresh.\n\nWe were too stuffed to try dessert but I had my eye on every creme brulee that passed by. Next time I will make sure to save room for it. We ended our meal with a coffee and an espresso.\n\nThe manager stopped by our table to ask how our meal was which is always a nice touch to see managers engaging with the guests dining in their establishment. There is also a great sense of teamwork among the servers. Many times I saw other servers clearing tables that weren't their own or grabbing dirty dishes out of another server's hands while he was at another table speaking with his guests. It's nice to see the wait staff help each other out and care about the appearance of the restaurant and the service being provided to all guests, not just their own.\n\nIf you're looking for a great meal with a gorgeous view of the strip lit up at night and even better service, come here for dinner. Ask to sit in Erik's section. He'll ensure you have a great experience and leave you wanting to come back again."

The restaurant is located at the Fashion Show Mall just across the hotel. We pick this restaurant based on the recommendation of Yelp and Open table. Reservation was done through Open Table.\n\nThe place is elegant with dark wood paneling all around. It is located at the third floor corner of the building fronting the Las Vegas Strip and the view is gorgeous.\n\nMy wife and I both ordered the Bone-in Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin and shared a wedge salad. We also ordered fresh creme spinach and Vidalia onion rings for our side. \n\nOverall, the service is very attentive and good. The ambiance is great. The portions are big and more than enough even if you are starving.The steak is comparable with the other good higher end steakhouses. I still prefers Mastro's but will not hesitate to come back nor recommend this place."

Starting with the reservationist, Mallory, the friendly greeting from the ma\u00eetre d' and the great Strip view from our table it was an outstanding experience. The service we received from our server Alex was exceptional. He asked about our time schedule and made sure we were on time for our show at The Wynn. We both decided on steak which is not always the case. I had the Delmonico while my wife had the sliced filet prepared with mushrooms and onions; both were delicious. The wedge salad was really nice as their blue cheese dressing is not overpowering.

So when we were in Vegas for our anniversary and needed someplace to celebrate the day, there was no question where we would go.\n\nOf course the table was decorated when we got there and a handwritten note was waiting for us, with a wax seal.\n\nWe almost always order the same thing: lobster and crab cakes for an app, we both have a lettuce wedge for a salad.  I have the filet and the husband has the kona crusted ribeye.  We'll vary on what we have for dessert.\n\nI love the Bohemian there - it's an awesome champagne drink that has raspberries in it.  It's almost worth a trip to the Grille just for that.\n\nAnyway, our experience here was wonderful.  Our minor quibble is the lobster and crab cake weren't quite as good as we were used to, but everything else was spot on.  As they sometimes do, they came out with a complimentary dessert of a small cheesecake and espresso cake with \"Happy Anniversary\" written on the plate.\n\nI really wish they would open a Capital Grille in the Bay Area."

While I've never had a steak dinner here, I have had their Signature Cheeseburger, which is outstanding and definitely one of the best burgers out there.  The meat is top-grade and even has some smoked bacon blended into the meat to add that certain something to make it special.  It's topped with Havarti cheese and served on a toasted, rich and slightly sweet onion roll.  The burger is juicy and flavorful and perfect for satisfying a large appetite.  The fries that arrive with it actually do help to clean the palate a bit with it's more subtle flavor.  I also had their Potatoes Au Gratin, which were creamy and delicious.\n\nI enjoyed my experience here and will probably be one of those restaurants I'll always want to come back to since the burger is so good!"

He got the Gorgonzola and Truffle Crusted Filet Mignon with Cabernet Reduction and he really enjoyed it. He even said he would definitely do a repeat of this.\n\nValet service for Capital Grille is right around the corner from Top Shop and Forever 21.

Having said that, the rating is all relative to the prices, which as others have mentioned are quite steep\n($50 per steak on average without sides), so expectations are high. \n\nWe celebrated our anniversary here, and they do a great job with special touches like table confetti and a hand written note. Service was warm, friendly and attentive.\n\nWe got the calamari to start, which was greaseless and plentiful but honestly lacked a ton of flavor. When eaten with the cherry peppers served on top, there was a nice heat to it, but not a ton of flavor besides those peppers. \n\nSalads were Caesar- which was classic and perfect, and a caprese type salad that was spot on. Could have used a few more basil leaves than just the one it came with. \n\nMy husband got the steak special- a bone in filet that was dry aged. It wasn't that large (10 oz which I think may have included the bone? Not sure). So for $60 you'd pretty much expect perfection. It was flavorful, but was ordered medium and it was medium in some places (where it was tender as it should be) and closer to well done in others (where it was less tender of course). I was having some of this steak and don't mind the well done as much, so I ate those parts. We didn't complain or bring the cooking issue to the waiter's attention, and I'm sure they would've cooked us a new one had we done so. But we had a show to get to, so didn't want to wait. \n\nSide was potatoes au gratin, which was good but not amazing. Had a subtle garlic flavor and nice cheesiness / creaminess with crunchy toppling.  \n\nDessert was comped for our anniversary and was their coconut cream pie. Splendid. It was large and had a tasty, chewy, blonde-like crust. If you love whipped cream, you'll be in heaven with this. \n\nOverall, an enjoyable meal with a great view of the strip. Not a total 4 star, and we'd probably come back, but might try a few other places first."

I was looking for a fancy restaurant for dinner on Saturday night and am really glad that I came across this place!\n\nService: Their service was exceptional! I originally made reservations online for 5:00. We were running behind schedule so I called an hour before and asked if I could reschedule to 9:00, wasn't a problem at all. We arrived around 15 minutes late and were seated immediately. Our waiter was very friendly and it was obvious that he had a thorough knowledge of their menu; he had great suggestions on some of the better items on their menu. The food came out surprisingly quickly and our waiter checked up on us throughout the night to make sure everything was good.\n\nAmbiance: The restaurant has a modern clean feel to it. It felt like we were seated at the best seat in the whole place, our view was breathtaking! Great view of the strip primarily with the Wynn and Encore on one corner and half the strip on the other.\n\nFood: The hero of any restaurant should always be the food and this place really delivers! Their portion sizes are huge, each dish was perfect for sharing. We started off with fried calamari saut\u00e9ed with garlic butter and bell peppers. It was so good that we couldn't stop eating it even though we knew we needed to save room for the main course. Great crunch with every bite. We decided to go with their Delmonico ribeye steak for our main course. One of the best steaks I've ever had. The ribeye was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare! They cut it in half for us which was awesome for sharing. As a side we had their backed lobster mac and cheese! Amazing! Nice crunchy layer on top with generous portions of lobster. Under the crunch the Mac and cheese was really creamy. Almost liked it more than the streak!\n\nLooking forward to the next time I'm in Vegas so I can have another delicious steak!"

I have been to quite a few steak houses ( Boa, Smith & Wollensky, etc.) and this place is by far the best!!! \n\nThe decor is wonderful with dark woods, brass fixtures, and huge Tiffany style chandeliers. There is about a 180 degree view of the city from the 3rd floor restaurant. There is a perfect level of jazz being played through out the restaurant. Just loud enough to be heard and drowned out some of the noise but not to loud that you hear it over your own conversation. \n\nWe were seated immediately in a very private booth with a nice view of the city. Shortly after our server appeared with a basket of warm, fresh breads and butter. The basket contained what seemed to be  sourdough, sesame and poppy seed rolls, a sweet brown bread, and a flat sesame type flat bread. \n\nFor our appetizer we had the Pan Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers.($13) This is the best calamari I have ever had.( and I have put away a few tons of calamari in my life!!) It comes out in a heaping pile which is then french served to us by our server. We squeeze a little lemon on it and that's all it needs. It is not served with a sauce which it did not need anyway. It is crispy and not chewy, sweet from the cherry peppers but also a little heat from them. Just the perfect amount of flavors that result in it not needing sauce or anything else just to be eaten and enjoyed.\n\nThe second course was a Spinach with Warm Bacon Dressing Salad.($9) They split it for the GF and I in the kitchen which was nice. It was a perfect sized salad with the right amount of fresh bacon, hard boiled egg, and red onion. The salad was excellent and it reminded me of the one my great grandma used to make me when I was a kid. Which no other spinach salad has done for me. Another great course.\n\nFor our entrees I had the 24 oz. Dry Aged Porterhouse. ($41) It was HUGE and TENDER!!! The New York Side was so good it reminded me of a filet. Then I tasted the filet side which I could only compare to something just melting in your mouth. It was cooked to a perfect Med Rare. It is not served with and sauce nor does it need it. It is just excellent meat served by itself for you to enjoy. The GF had the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Caramelized Shallot Butter. ($40) It was served on a plate topped with the caramelized shallot butter and two shallots. This was quite a large steak as well. The couple bites I had were amazing. You could taste the coffee but also the sweetness from the caramelized shallots. It was also insanely tender. WOW what a wonderful steak. For our sides we ordered The Parmesan Truffle Fries and the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese.  The fries were awesome great truffle flavor and crunchy but not to oily. The lobster mac was Great!! Excellent flavor and lots of large chunks of lobster. It was so rich we couldn't even finish it. \n\nWe finished off our meal with their signature coconut cream pie and the flour-less chocolate espresso cake. My GF loved the coconut cream pie. I love coconut cream pie but thought this one was good nothing too special. Now the flour-less chocolate cake on the other hand was the best thing ever. Little hints of espresso and raspberry sauce and a thick chocolaty fudge like consistency. AMAZING!!! \n\nThe ONLY bad thing was my GF only ate about 1/4 of her steak so we asked for it to go. You guessed it someone threw it away!!!!! I finally had a reason to give this place 4 stars. Then our server stepped up and said the kitchen was making a new one right now and cooking it to rare so we could finish it off at home and it would come out medium rare!!! WOW that's a save!! 5 stars welcome back. \n\nAll I have to say is please try this place. For the size and quality this place is a little cheaper than some of the others in town and I think it is the BEST. Service is always good and the food never disappoints."

I would have liked another, but not when I'm done eating. She rarely checked on us, and she seemed almost put off by having to serve us. She did come around at the end, offering to take our picture and making small talk.

            "review": "Nice high end restaurant good for business lunch/dinner or a romantic date, or, heck, if you just feel like indulging in some good old American food, assuming your wallet would allow it. Was there last night for a business dinner and sat by the window with some nice view, even though it's not located very high up in the building. It's sitting across from the shopping center so you can also get some shopping done afterwards to walk off the rich meal.\n\nToo bad I didn't snap any pictures, but this was a work dinner and I had to behave...\n\nEveryone else ordered some sort of steak dish except for me. I got the citric glazed salmon, which was juicy, medium rare and cooked perfectly. The steak dishes are pricey but the portions were actually not very huge. Everyone finished all their meat so apparently they were all happy with how their steak was cooked. I did get to taste their beef as I ordered the steak tartar appetizer and it was fresh and tender and seasoned well too.  We also shared fried calamari, lobster macaroni (yum!), steak tartar and grilled asparagus (bland). Loved the warm bread basket before the meal. Fancy decor (classic dark wood) and we shared a bottle of 2009 red wine from Napa.\n\nThe chef sent us three yummy desserts even though we didn't order any: cheesecake (rich and just the right amount of tartness to balance the sweetness), chocolate ganache cake (smooth, deep, chocolaty) and creame brulee (light and fresh custard) with assorted berries. I only have one word for all three desserts: PERFECTION. Not bad if you have a friend who knows the chef. Again I wish I had taken a photo. .."

There isn't much to set this place apart from the rest besides the nationally-recognized name (nothing against chains, but I'm just making a point).  \n\nThe beef here is pretty consistent.  (It never ceases to amaze me at how many times I've had overcooked steak).  I always order the rib eye and on two separate visits, both times med rare was med rare.  Win!  I also tried a friend's kona coffee rubbed rib eye: yet another example of why you should never pay extra to put crap that ruins/asks the flavor of a good slab of beef.\n\nOn my latest trip we had creamed spinach, mushrooms and the lobster mac & cheese.  Creamed spinach was tasty, mushrooms were acceptable, but the mac and cheese was winners!  Next time, I think we'll just have three orders of that.\n\nAside from the mac and cheese, the one thing that really stood out was the pineapple infused vodka.  Well slap me silly and call me Susan; this stuff is B-O-M-B.  For this drink alone, it is worth at least hitting up the bar.  Also, they have an ok corkage policy.  I think it was $35/bottle, with a two bottle max.\n\nAll in all, though, a martini and a side dish aren't enough to really warrant handing over a wad of my cash for a middle of the road steakhouse.  Sure, it's better than Outback, but with competition right across the street, this place has room for improvement.  Just my humble opinion."

In Las Vegas, we waited for about 10 minutes for a table & the service was very friendly & attentive.  The restaurant was crowded & noisy (of course, it's Vegas!).  \n\nI ordered the ice berg lettuce wedge with blue cheese dressing... the combination of the two was perfect & I finished the whole thing.  I ordered the aged ribeye medium rare and a side of creamed spinach (I know, I'm so old fashioned).  It was the best steak I have had in a very long time.   I just love a really good-quality steak without the bells & whistles...  sorry, some people might want to rub kona coffee on a good steak but that's just blasphemous.  However, there are exceptions... my friend ordered the porchini-rubbed ribeye with balsamic vinegar and he shared slice w/ me... it was out-of-this world!  That's what I'll order next time.\n\nThe creamed spinach was also very good... you can taste the quality ingredients. Not the nasty, frozen, formulaic stuff like Boston Market makes.  \n\nOverall, if you are looking for an excellent, high-end steak and meal, try The Capital Grille before you go any of the other high-end steakhouses."

The service, food and decor were outstanding. \n\nWe came here on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday and they truly gave us the royal treatment. They sat us by the window overlooking the Vegas Strip, had the table decorated with birthday confetti and birthday card, gave us complimentary tastings of two drinks, and provided a generous  sampling of their desserts with a birthday candle. \n\nThe server Dominic was amazing and extremely helpful in helping us decide on our meal for the evening. He was a significant contributor to why we had such a fantastic time. Not only was he helpful with food recommendations but he also gave us tips on which casino games were statistically more likely to pay out and also asked some of his colleagues for recommendations on where to go to get the most bang for our buck. We were sort of new to the whole gambling world and appreciated his insights. \n\nThe food was AMAZING. My friend whose birthday we celebrated stated that her bone in fillet was THE BEST steak she had ever had. I had the bone in NY strip with Gorgonzola and savoured it to the last bite. I was amazed that I had almost finished the entire strip. They cooked both steaks perfectly (med rare). We ordered the Brussel sprouts with bacon and the mushroom plate for our sides and really enjoyed both. We were glad not to have ordered something more heavy because we were stuffed by the end of the meal. My friend and I also shared a bottle of red that we absolutely loved also. I am so happy they include ratings for the wines that are rated 90 points or higher so we were able to choose a bottle that was guaranteed to be good. I even took a photo of the bottle so I can try to purchase it elsewhere. The trio of desserts they provided were amazing as well. Our favorite was the coconut cream pie but the cheesecake and chocolate cake were also delicious. I have absolutely no criticisms to offer because the entire experience was remarkable. \n\nThank you Dominic and The Capital Grill for providing such a wonderful experience for my friend's birthday. We will definitely be back."

My server, Eric, was top notch!  He explained various things on the menu since it was my first visit to the restaurant.  He then left me to mull the choices before coming back to see if I had any questions or was ready to order.\n\nI ordered a cup of potato leek soup, the bone in Kona crusted sirloin and the parmesan truffle fries for a side.  Everything was very, very good.  The potato leek soup was creamy and served with a few very thin, slightly deep fried fingerling potato slices.  The soup was rich and very enjoyable.\n\nI ordered the steak blue and that's just the way it came.  It was very good and I almost picked up the bone to gnaw before I let them take the plate.  The parmesan truffle fries were addictive.  If anyone from the FDA comes to this restaurant, the fries will be listed as a Class xx addictive drug.  I hated to finish only a small amount but I didn't want to overdo it.\n\nFor dessert, I got the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  It was very rich and had a good dark chocolate/coffee flavor--strong but not overpowering.  \n\nI gave my compliments to Eric for the staff on such a good meal.  It was a great start to the evening.  The view through those windows along with the excellent food and service make the Capital Grille a real winner."

To start off our dining experience, we always get the Seafood plateau.  It's a ton of seafood and totally worth the $99.  You get a heathy portion of lobster, crab meat, oysters, and shrimp cocktail.  The bone-in ribeye is my go to all the time, but they had a special bone-in filet that was to die for.   My wife and kids ordered that... wish I did too.  It was succulent, juicy, and cut like \"butter\".  If they have it again, that'll be my go to 100% each time.  The sides were amazing as always.  We had the wild mushrooms, lobster mac and cheese, creme spinach, and mash potatoes.  To finish off our dining experience, we had our go to Banana cream pie desert.   A little too much whipped cream this time, but still amazing.   \n\nIf you're asking if the juice is worth the squeeze?  I'd say hellz ya my ninjas!"

During the meal, everyone kept complimenting the restaurant and the dinner experience we were enjoying. We had a wonderful time."

We were seated almost immediately at 7pm on a Sunday night. The server was very nice and answered alot of pointed questions about the menu and content. We both have dietary restrictions so we definitely put him through his paces. He never got frustrated with us even though we shared a few things. We both got salads. Mine was the chopped salad and was delightful. Then I got the filet mignon medium rare and my friend got the lobster tail. Mine was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. Sometimes simple is really best. Thank heavens the steak was way too much meat for me to eat so I didn't have to glare  piercingly at the basket of fresh warm rolls for long. Even so I'm relatively certain they turned to yucky charcoal under my gaze. We were too full to even complain about not getting to order dessert. I took the steak home for a yummy lunch the next day and all was well. Of course we got up to leave and I promptly left the steak at the table....I ran out front and by the time I got back to the table it was whisked away. But all the while they were chasing me down trying to give it too me. I thought that was a nice extra step. Even with the plethora of classic steakhouses out there...I would still go to Capital Grille again if the opportunity and desire arouse."

It is served in a chilled martini glass.  It is pineapple infused vodka.  If you enjoy fresh seafood I highly recommend you order their seafood plateau.  It is in one word, INCREDIBLE!  Worth every $$$ you spend.  Great wine selection and amazing steaks.  The kona crusted steak is killer.  The fish is good too.  Ask for a window seat that faces the strip."

I personally ordered a steak with melted gorgonzola cheese with a Cabernet Sauvignon reduction that was simply out-of-this-world. Their salads are incredible. Their bread \"basket\" is amazing. The view and atmosphere are unequalled, perhaps a direct competitor to Charlie Palmers at the 4-Seasons, but Palmer's has no view. Capital Grille overlooks the Las Vegas Blvd (strip). Cocktails prepared correctly, their wine suggestions turned out to be fabulous. The waiter did NOT bust into conversations, he patiently waited his turn to speak. First class. I just reviewed \"Giada\". What a night-and-day difference between the two restaurants. I highly recommend Capital Grille."

Our server Eric provided phenomenal service, and was the perfect mix of helpful, knowledgeable, friendly and professional.  We also sat at a window table with a great view of the strip, which was a nice addition to Our experience.\nAs for the food... It was, hands down, the best meal of my entire life!  We started off with an appetizer of Pan Fried Calamari and a round of delicious Stoli Dolis. From there we enjoyed the shareable Lobster Mac N Cheese and grilled asparagus.  All of these items were delicious, but the main course of Porcini Rubbed Delmonico Steak blew them all away! It was hot, juicy, delicious, and truly an exceptional dish.  I can not wait to celebrate my next special occasion at what, in one night, became my favorite restaurant in the world!"

I can easily say the only thing impressive was the steak and the wine menu. The kona crusted steak was fabulous! Both steaks were cooked perfectly. The service was wonderful and the view of the strip gorgeous. But I had to give it three stars based on how mediocre the calamari, fries, and Mac and cheese were. Pretty disappointing. The lobster was chewy and over cooked, and was more of a b\u00e9chamel cream sauce than Mac and cheese. The fries were so greasy, and the calamari was just average."

I would go back for these items alone.  \n\nThe only problem we encountered was the empty hostess station when we arrived. Even though we made a reservation, between waiting for the hostess to appear and sitting at the bar, we had to wait about 15min for them to \"put our table together\". I was disappointed to see that when we were finally taken to the dinning room we had been seated at a booth. For a group of four guys, this isn't an ideal seating situation. \n\nIn the end, the food and wine made it easy to overlook the poor service at the hostess station. If you're out there celebrating an important event, I recommend The Capital Grille."

I couldn't taste too much of the coffee flavor but the steak was fairly tender and the portion was huge. The shallot butter was great but I didn't have nearly enough to give the extra amount of flavor it needed. Call me crazy but this steak was not nearly good enough to stand on its own without the saltiness I'm used to. I even had to ask for au jus and even that was pretty bland. For a $47 steak a la carte I expected more flavor, A LOT more.\n\nOn the other hand, the parmesan truffle fries were amazing (as they are at every other place I've had them). The waiter even gave our table of 5 free shots as well as a complimentary dessert trio because it was my friend's birthday. The coconut cream pie that was part of that dessert was so light and fluffy, definitely the star of the night.\n\nWhat can I say Capital Grille? You have 5 star ambiance/service but 3 star food."

We succeeded. The Capital Grill, located at the front of the mall, has a view of the Strip's Encore and Wynn hotels. I didn't have reservations, Yet, the restaurant was able to accommodate me and my partner despite a rather large party who took up most of the front part of the restaurant.\n\nWe also ate there last night for our anniversary and once again they did not disappoint. Starting with the reservationist, Mallory, the friendly greeting from the ma\u00eetre d' and the great Strip view from our table it was an outstanding experience. The service we received from our server Alex was exceptional. He asked about our time schedule and made sure we were on time for our show at The Wynn. We both decided on steak which is not always the case. I had the Delmonico while my wife had the sliced filet prepared with mushrooms and onions; both were delicious. The wedge salad was really nice as their blue cheese dressing is not overpowering. We tried the Truffle Fries for the first time and enjoyed them. Of course we had the stoli-doli which is their signature drink. Love them. \n\nA while ago we tried the Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese and we found this dish to be amazing. The double-cut lamb chops were delicious and perfectly cooked, too. My wife marveled over this bone-in filet mignon with every bite. When we were first-time Capital Grille patrons, the restaurant sent us a complimentary dessert, which we matched with a dessert wine and a port. However, the coconut cream pie is our favorite dessert.\n\nThe wait staff were attentive and provided helpful suggestions on what to order. Those with large appetites will enjoy the steaks. Those with smaller appetites will likely take home a to-go bag. The cocktails were tasty. We were allowed to sip an talk prior to the start of our meal as long as we wanted. \n\nIt's tough to beat the combination of view, service and food that this Capital Grille provides.

            "review": "I ordered their porterhouse steak which was decent but not that good.  The steak had no char on the outside at all, and was a much thinner cut than I am accustomed to.  At $45 the steak should be better.  It is dry aged which is good and compared to the price and quality of other steakhouses I have been to in Vegas it is OK.   Their signature steak is the ribeye but I am not really a fan of ribeye steaks due to their fattiness. The sides were excellent along with the French onion soup. The chef prepared a special complementary appetizer of shrimp tempura which was excellent and appreciated.\n\nThe ambiance is nice, but bathroom is pretty dirty. This restaurant is owned and operated by mega restaurant corp Darden.  The wine list was extensive and farily priced.  Overall a pretty good value if you would like a formal, nice dinner in this town for a non absurd price."

Our waiter was very polite. \nWe were recommended to order 2-3 appetizers by our waiter but we ended up ordering one because we knew we can't eat that much and came here to eat steaks not appetizers. Glad we didn't order 2-3 appetizers because it was just right amount for all of us. We ordered Caramari and it was very good.\nHe also said we should order 3 sides to share with everyone.\nWe ordered French fries, Brussels sprouts and asparagus according to his advise. The Brussels sprouts was on point! \nUpon getting entrees, we were already overwhelmed how big our steak was. We ended up not able to finish most of the steaks and sides. \nSteaks were good, and sides were good but the volume was too much even though two of us shared the one entree. \nI felt like our waiter was recommending many extra food and trying to get more money from us. \n\nAlso there was a big party in the party room. We didn't like people standing right behind us when we were enjoying our dinner. \n\nI made a reservation for this party well in advance but the location of our table was in front of the big screen by the window. It can be pretty at night but we were having hard time because flashing of lights wasn't good for our eyes."

The issue was with the filet mignon I ordered  for 50.00 and is just the meat a la cart. On my first bite I found it dry with no taste and not what I was expecting for 50.00!  I did order a Caesar salad for an additional 12.00 but was just a Caesar salad , nothing special. I should have refused this order\nat that time but by the time I had my dinner the restaurant was busy .."

We were seated by a window with a great view. Rose petals decorated the table. Four of us were served sparkling wine (gratis), and the celebrants were presented with a card. We  dined on chowder and French onion soup with our assortment of fresh breads. The salmon was moist and tender; swordfish delicate and flavorful. Four generous lamb chops and filet rounded out our varied selections. We   shared fantastic au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach. Then the  waiter brought a dessert platter for the anniversary couple which they  shared after extinguishing the candles. We loved the light cheesecake,  chocolate cake, and berries with our coffee. Dessert was also comped.  Wonderful service was provided throughout. Minor criticism: coffee was a  bit weak. This is top notch dining and well worth the price."

While the food was top notch, the service from the staff and particularly our waiter Alex, was just incredible in every aspect.\n\nAlex was very courteous and helpful in describing the menu items, made recommendations on the wine tasting and I think he was generous with the pourings since it was the last day of the promotion and they had some extra wine not on their normal menu.  We were his only table after another party left, so he was very attentive, but his bussers were also awesome.\n\nThe resturant week promotion also contributes to threequare.org which support local food banks so we got to make a positive contribution for our weekend of debauchery.\n\nOn to the food:\nI started out with the french onion soup, it's in a cup, so it's not a huge portion, but it was delicious.  Other folks got the caesar and wedge, no complaints from anyone on the starters.\n\nI had the kona-crusted sirloin medium rare which I recommend.  It's on a hot plate so it cooks for a little bit.  Hint of coffee, but plenty of flavor in the crust and juicy meat.\n\nThe filets also got high marks from the bachelor, and the desserts were pretty good.\n\nI don't like to frequent the same restaurants in Vegas since there's so much great food to try, but when they open a Capital Grille in San Diego, I'll be at the ribbon cutting!"

That's why I'm still keeping the 3 stars for their steaks and side dishes. \n\nHere were what we've experienced that disappointed us:\n\n1 - Front desk hostesses: unfriendly, didn't greet us when we arrived or even say a word; we stood  and waited for 1min and walked closer to them to say \"hi\", then they asked \"reservation?\" without a smile. We said \"Yes, reservation at 7pm\" then they looked at the book and said \"just a moment\" and we stood and waited aside for a good 8min before they led us to a table.\n\n2 - Our female server walked back and forth busy serving other tables and we were seated at the table for 12min, Seriously? You can't just come by to take drink orders or even just ask us to give a few more minutes?\n\n3 - She was very impatience; we wanted to ask for the best bottle of wine for our food, she didn't get us the correct wine menu so she had to go get it a couple of times and gave us a weird unhappy look then she returned and said \"you might need a moment to look, I'll be back\" then walked away. Hence, we waited for another 10min before we ordered our drink.\n\n4 - Food-wise, everything was perfect until dessert; we ordered their creme brule and that's what we always order; however, when it came, the entire creme brule was freezing cold and firm! Usually the bottom egg part is soft and cold with warm top sugar crust that is freshly made to order. It looked and tasted like something they put in the fridge overnight (perhaps someone didn't want it). So we told our server, she didn't even look/check the creme brule and immediately said \"it IS how we do it, you can talk to our manager if you want\"\n\nOh my lord! Really?! That pissed my husband off so badly! So of course we wanted to speak to their manager; the manager came and first he said the same thing that it was how they do it without checking it, we asked him to look closer and he started to realize the weird firmness of the brule. He started to apologize and to bring a freshly made one out to us, and removing the brule from the check.\n\nAs much as we love The Capital Grille in other cities, we will definitely pass this one and not recommend to anyone."

            "review": "When we first started going to Capital Grill, I was really blown away by the quality of the food and the care they put into all elements of the dining experience. Not much has changed.\n\nSTEAK: We ordered the wrong steaks tonight. It has clearly been a while since we've been here. After consulting with our waiter, we we ordered the ribeye, NOT the porcini rubbed rib eye that we love. I ordered my steak \"medium rare plus\". I like that label. I tried to explain to the waiter that I wanted my steak between medium and medium rare. When the waiter appeared confused, I told him that if the steak wasn't medium, I'd rather they erred on the side of medium rare than medium well. He THEN suggested medium rare plus. I don't eat steak out very often, so that designation may be common knowledge to others. It was new to me. The meat was...a bit off tonight, but I chalk that up to my disappointment at not having the right steak. It was cooked nicely and seasoned well, but I was not a fan of something I tasted in the beef and the sauce that accompanied it.\n\nSIDE DISHES: We had a salad, potatoes au gratin, and green beans. We skipped their delicious calamari and seafood platter. Everything was done well. The potatoes were a tad bit under seasoned, but certainly nothing to worry about. \n\nSERVICE: This is where CG usually shines. But not so much tonight. Good establishments can have an off night, or an off employee. But when you come to a place like this, you are expecting polished service. The host was a Professional (capital P). He was on the phone, dealing with clients, directing the secondary host, and organizing the tables around a large party in the venue. All at the same time.  The bussers were attentive and one woman even came and refolded my husband's napkin while he was away from the table. I like all of those touches. The waiter was well meaning, but not up to CG standards. Little things like drinks being poured in the wrong glasses (not our waiter's fault), missed oppotunities for menu clarification, or knowing the daily specials don't amount to much. Unless a guest is less than excited about her meal.\n\nWHAT HAS CHANGED: I don't know if I have changed or CG has. I never saw Capital Grill as a modern \"old school\" steak house before. I did tonight. The dishes were all very typical and expected, but there was a heaviness and lack of ingenuity to the meal. I know a steakhouse isn't looking to wow its customers with modern twists on old standbys, but the food should be impeccable. Beautifully seasoned and cooked. Even though I was directed to the wrong steak, it should have been the best quality meat and  the steak should have stood up on its own. I wasn't and it didn't.  \n\nVALET: It's a mess and they will have you waiting in the heat to pick up your car. Not good, but not CG's fault.\n\nCapital Grill has an old-school feel. The decor is modern and sleek, but the offerings reflect more of what Vegas was than what it is today.  In spite of that, CG is still a solid choice for a delicious meal. A flawed meal a CG is still head and shoulders above many other places in town. \n\nI will be back."

We decided to have a romantic dinner at Capital Grille since we were already familiar with this chain restaurant. After telling them that we were in town for our honeymoon, they asked us why we were in town, we were seated right next to the window overlooking the Strip. I have a feeling that those tables are left open for honeymooning couples. The food of course is great although some of the entrees may seem a bit small portion wise. But the portion of the side dishes make up for it. Arrive at this place good and hungry if you do not want to waste any food."

Upon arrival, we were greeted with heart confetti and a personalized birthday card for my boyfriend. Our waiter for the night was Jeff and he was more an absolute joy to be around. Throughout the night, he came by to make sure everything was going well; not in an obnoxious way either where some servers tend to do when they continuously check up on you. \n\nRegarding the food we had that night, for our appetizer we chose the Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella which was out of the world amazingly good! For our main course, my boyfriend picked one of the Chef's Suggestions, \"Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails.\" Now, I know this was delicious because my boyfriend took his sweet time eating it and raving about it, when usually he is the fastest eater I know. I chose to go with the \"Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon.\" I absolutely love salmon and this was probably one of the best ones I have ever had. We also opted to go for the \"Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese\" and I tell you, it was so delicious if we had more space, we probably would have ordered another one! \n\nAt the end of our meal, Jeff brought out a platter with two desserts to share (as I had requested when making the reservation) and we also ordered two double shot esspressos to have with our dessert. Overall, this was an absolute great experience and we will without a doubt be back here again for many more occasions to come!"

Pair the Porcini with some of its friends like roasted fingerling potatoes or grilled asparagus with lemon mosto and now it's a party! The clam chowder or Caesar salad are both great starters as well. The deserts are decadent & delicious!

And this place is well done.\n\nThe bar area is nicely separated from the dining room and covered in dark wood paneling.  It looks like old money and you feel instantly classier sipping a dirty Grey Goose martini in the bar, which is exactly what we did.  After a drink, we were ready to be seated and start the feast.  The floor to ceiling windows ensure that the view is pretty great from any table in the room.\n\nWe started with oysters that were very fresh and salty.  5 stars.  We also brought a bottle of wine with us and the corkage fee of $25 was definitely lower than some other strip location restaurants.  Everything we had was wonderful but after that martini and a couple of glasses of wine, it gets a little fuzzy.  The only thing I can tell you for sure is the filet was great heated up for lunch the next day!"

I had to once again hold back on eating too much as to not get full before my actual meal came out. There was an assortment of piping hot breads that came with sweet cream butter that was topped with some salt. I know it is just \"bread\", but I can eat that bread basket for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nThen came the calamari with hot peppers. This was excellent as usual since the calamari was the star of the show. They didn't taste frozen as they were soft and tender, they were coated with a crispy batter that wasn't too thick or heavy, and they had excellent flavor from the peppers. They weren't overly spicy but still had a nice bite. I'm glad they don't come with some type of sauce since, in my opinion, would totally kill the flavor of this awesome appetizer.\n \nAfterwards, my steak came out. I wish I had the words to describe how awesome this steak was, it honestly was one of the best steaks I have had in recent memory. I got the delmonico at a medium-rare, a bone-in ribeye, and I wish I was still eating it as I write this review. It was so juicy, it was so tender, and it had so much flavor. It was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of fat on the edges. \n\nAll the accompanying sides that I ordered were a great complimenting addition to my excellent steak. The grilled asparagus was tender and crispy while not being chewy or stringy like asparagus can be. The grilled half lemon that comes with it helps add a bright smokey flavor. The parmesan truffle fries I got were hot, crispy/crunchy and delicious from the first bite to the last. So much so that when I ate the last couple of fries, I almost went into a depressed state of not having any left and actually thought about ordering another order. Then there was the lobster mac and cheese. I have probably eaten this dish over a half dozen times, and it has yet to disappoint. Tender noodles, big chunks of lobster that was in almost in every bite, and a awesome cheese sauce. It was another item that I seriously gave thought to buying a second order of to take home.\n\nMy excellent meal was finished with a cheesecake that had fresh berries and a nice caramelized sugar topping. It was a perfect finisher.\n\nThe service was top notch as everyone was really friendly. Everything that was ordered came out hot, fresh, and correct. The manager came by to see how everything was doing, and all of the staff in general made my meal very pleasant and memorable.\n\nI like forward to another year of coming here and enjoying impeccable food and service."

During the reservation process, they asked if it was for a special occasion and I let them know it was.\n\nWe were not readily greeted upon arrival, but once we were, the service from then on out was amazing. The table was prepared with confetti and a handwritten birthday greeting from the staff. Very nice touch. The view was quite nice as well.\n\nThey also had a small wine tasting prepared for the two of us, and at the end of our meal, they also brought her a special desert tray. The food was wonderful, I ordered the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection. The sides and salad were also very good.\n\nIt was on the pricey side, but it's a high class restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip, so... to be expected.\n\nI really have nothing to complain about. It was a stellar experience and I will return if the urge strikes again, and I am sure that it will."

Restaurant was very nice inside, nice view of the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nWe first started with apps which we had oysters, lobster and calamari and shrimp.  All was very good!! Oysters were nice and cold and being in Las Vegas surprisingly; tasted fresh.  Lobster was served cold but it was very tasty. The calamari was pretty good.  It defiantly had a some kick to it due to the  peperoncini and peppers mixed it. And the shrimp were huge; could use a little more cocktail sauce but the apps were great!\n\nNow on to my entree all I have to say was YUMM!!!  I ordered the sea bass and it was awesome!!! It was cooked perfectly, tasted great.  I would highly recommend this entree.  My boyfriend ordered the steak and lobster and he said that it was just the right amount of food due to if you order some of the steaks they are huge! His steak was cooked perfectly; just the way he liked it and the lobster was on top with some creamy sauce as the base.  \n\nOur sides were corn, Au gratin potatoes and lobster mac-n-cheese and asparagus.  The sides were good I just have to say if you order the corn, Au Gratin Potatoes and the loster mac-n-cheese, it's all based with cream sauce and bread crumbs.  I've heard from several people that the lobster mac-n-cheese was very good but I wouldn't rate it as a 5.  It was alright.  I expected it to be a little more cheesy and the noodles could of been more of the traditional way to where the cheese can get inside of the noodles instead of using a egg noodles.\n\nAll in all, I will definately go there again!!!"

Still, the Cold Shellfish Platter was a great value, and especially the Beef Tartare was fantastic. Entrees were great as well (scallops and Tomahawk Ribeye). \nWould go here again, although at a check of $325 incl tip for two, the above mentioned issues should not have been present."

Crunchy with a little heat and generous proportions) \n- french onion soup -- YES YES YES! If I went back, I would order the crock and not just the measly cup. If your doctor has put you on a low sodium diet, step away (and pass your crock to moi.) \n- butter poached lobster (kill me now) and beef tenderloins  [My meal. Lobster was divine. Not one big lobster tail but a few small ones [like 1/3 the size of the palm of my hand]. Meat was good but not amazing.] \n- Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic [aka rib eye, but double check that. Deeeeelicious. And insanely large at 22 oz. Great flavor at medium rare. (it should be a crime to cook up steak above medium rare. A crime!)] \n- Kona rubbed Delmonico. [the kona rub was all my stepmom could talk about before we got there. Has a coffee-meets-chocolate sort of flavor. And, while it's a \"rub\" like the porcini, the kona comes off as more of a sauce. Seriously tasty but I'm not sure I could personally down 22 oz. of it. Would get this and the porcini or a seafood dish and share.] \n- Asparagus (good - not mushy) \n- side of mushrooms (also delicious) \n- Au gratin (massive. Didn't try it myself but told it was creamy goodness)\n\nRemember: all the meats are a la carte, so be prepared to get some sides. \n\nDessert was acceptable but not mind blowing (and thus I shed a single baby tear). We got the cheesecake (fluffy while still being fairly dense) and the berries with cream (tasty). Both were good -- indeed, some loved the cheesecake -- but I would have appreciated some different options (e.g., a chocolate cake that wasn't super dark and dense). \n\nOh! And the service there is abso-friggin-lutley fantastic. Our dinner party consisted of two men and two women. When the waitress came to take our order she asked us the most genius question: \"Ladies, would you like to order first or last?\"  Is that not awesome! So often I'm expected to go first but, surprise surprise, don't know what I want yet. That simple question let us choose in a seamless way. Fantastic! I only wish I remembered her name! All I know is she loved Garth Brooks! :) \n\nAbsolutely would return!"

They let us tried the creme brulee which was so sinfully good, the cheesecake was delicious, and a chocolate cake.  Free dessert made it even sweeter.  A fantastic first time experience."

At the front desk, the head of the party's name is requested; once at the table, the server addresses the head person by name in an attempt to make the party feel welcome, special, or familiar.  It comes off as lame. \n\nThat said, our waiter was as nice as could be. We started with glasses of wine (a nice Malbec and a pinot noir, reasonably priced at around $10-$12). The caesar salad that followed was decent but forgettable.\nFor the main, I got \"sushi grade tuna\" with ginger rice. The tuna was nice and hugely portioned, but I would have preferred it to be sliced before it got to the table.  There's something unpleasantly animalistic about cutting into a giant hunk of raw meat. \nAs a side, we ordered the truffle oil and parmesan fries, which were fantastic.\nI had espresso pie and an espresso for dessert. Again, both items were decent but forgettable. When all is said and done, I'm 100% OK with this one trip being my last. Nice experience, satisfactory food...but for a bill of $250 for two people, I would have expected a bit more panache."

Servers in bow ties and very businesslike.  We went for the Mahi mahi and the seared citrus salmon. The sauce on the Mahi had an odd mineral flavor.  Not a flaw just not to my taste.  The salmon, always on the menu, was just to my taste.  The French beans and heirloom tomatoes were great.  And don't fail to look at the back page of the wine book (not just the list inside the menu) for the promotions.  Anything that they bought in volume and is not selling during the downturn is about 50% off.  The Byron Pinot was a bargain at $49.

And the tiny little bit that sets it apart from other french onion soups? The baguette they use in the soup stays crispy around the edges the whole crock through. I don't know how.. black magic maybe.. but it's worth my soul. Those crispy little bits that occasionally surprise you give me the motivation to finish the whole thing. And the crock is pretty big. For $10, I've made a meal out of it.\n\nAnother worthy mention: The coconut cream pie with bourbon sauce is out of this world. I don't like desserts.. but this tart.. the bottom is chewy like a meringue with coconut, the custard is rich, the fresh whipped cream is decadent and then bourbon sauce?! Really?! I never order desserts, 100% of the time I would rather order an appetizer. This dessert came complimentary and I'm so glad it did. I would come back JUST for this dessert and a cup of their coffee (which is also good).\n\nOther things I've tried: \n-Lobster and Crab Cakes. Comes with a corn succotash. I wouldn't order it again, it was kind of fishy to me.\n-Shrimp Cocktail - Hit or miss. The first time was good, although a little undercooked (the top was mushy). The second time tasted like glue a little bit. Weird.\n-Bacon and Mushroom Spinach Salad - it was okay. The bacon had that dirty pork taste I'm not fond of and there were too many (raw) mushrooms in the salad.\n-The burger. Not sure which one it was since the boyfriend ordered it, but it was ground sirloin and surprisingly not that tasty. I'd prefer Bachi Burger any day. The fries were just okay.\n\nThey have a nice selection of wines by the glass, a fantastic selection by the bottle and some very delicious hand crafted cocktails.\n\nI recommend sitting at the bar and chatting with one of the many friendly bar tenders, starting with a french onion soup, moving onto the coconut cream pie, and sipping some hot house coffee before you head out."

The pie was essentially maybe a 1/2\" layer of cream-cheese like consistency coconut flavored filling, not very sweet at all, toppedwith a massive pile of whipped cream and caramel sauce with a wafer thin huge coconut cookie. The toppings and cookie were better than the pie itself we thought. Go with the cheesecake instead.\n\nGreat place though! If I had to choose between this place and our \"Go To\" steak house (Del Frisco's), I'd have to give the edge to Del's. The steaks are probably equal, but their desserts, sides, and their similar pineapple infused vodka drink (the V.I.P. Martini) is better and much bigger.\n\nYou'll have a great meal here though."

Although I did stake claim to the melted cheese on the side of the bowl. which peeled off nicely and started the party in my mouth. Salad was good, but not very memorable.\n\nEntrees:  SEARED SIRLOIN WITH BUTTER-POACHED LOBSTER, PORCINNI RUBBED PORTERHOUSE\nHubba Hubba Hubba!  After my first bite of the lobster, all I could think was ... \"Why have I never had lobster like this before, and why would anyone ever want to eat it any other way!?\"  Truly a shell-fish shin-dig of buttery goodness.   My date's steak was amazing and so flavorful! Their balsamic reduction is killer, and my man spent the rest of the evening in beef bliss.\n\nSides: LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE and  SMASHED POTATOES\nTHE best potatoes, evah! Perfectly seasoned and loaded with butter, they didn't need a thing except a delivery device to get them into my mouth ASAP! Thank God for spoons. Seriously spudalicious!  The mac & cheese was super good, though it could have used a bit more actual lobster chunks. Still it was super satisfying, creamy, and catapulted me into glorious cheesey gratification.\n\nDesserts:  RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE and COCONUT CREAM PIE\nJeff recommended the Coconut Cream Pie and boy, was he right! The crust tasted like a macaroon, which was a delightful twist.  A massively mouthwatering experience. My man ordered the cheesecake and it was excellent too. \n\nOur evening at The Capital Grille exceeded our expectations on every level. From the wonderful portraits of Sammy, Frank, and Dean (among other Vegas legends) that greet you as you exit the valet elevator, to the classy service and sublime feast."

The view is great and ambience calm very business like dress code is probably business casual but we actually walked in with jeans and flip flops .  Our server, Miri was excellent, very nice and Served us well. She filled our waters constantly and always making sure we were ok.  I ordered the cheeseburger with truffle fries and the hubby ordered the crab/lobster burger. Both of them were heavenly!! Not sure though if it's cause I haven't eaten beef in like 2 +weeks... But I thought he burger was sook good, I only could eat half but it was defineyly juicy, tender and the bacon added tucked undernthe melted cheese added good flavor.  The truffle fries were to die for ... They came out hot and crush topped with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil... Easily one of the best fries I have ever had!! The crab burger came with some tasty tartar sauce and tasted very fresh not too breast. Mostly crab . I also had a bloody Maria which was delicious as well but would have liked to get a olive or two... overall it was a very good meal for a good price ( considering las Vegas drip coffee is almost $4 a cup) a $18 burger is about right ! Yum"

The restaurant is very nice on the inside, and has windows throughout that overlook the strip.  I recommend asking for a seat by the window, as you will have a nice view.  I really can't say enough good things about the food here.  I believe this was my wife's favorite meal of the trip, and we were there for an entire week.  My wife and I split the caesar salad, while my mom got the spinach salad.   Each was very good.  You can definitely split the salad's, as one if almost too much for one person.  Each of us ordered the filet for dinner, along with a side of au gratin potatoes.  The filet was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  The au gratin potatoes were some of the best I've had.  For dessert, we couldn't decide what we wanted, but ended up ordering the cheesecake.  Since we were having a hard time deciding, our waitress was nice enough to bring a complimentary coconut cream pie.  Each dessert was phenomenal.  This place is 5 stars all the way.  While it's a little pricey, it's definitely worth it."

I started with a few oysters which were fresh and well prepared (cut well, no shell bits, etc) with vinegar (one of my favorites) as well as horseradish and cocktail sauce.\nThe spinach salad was great, nice hot dressing but the spinach wasn't too wilted either. Bacon bits were good.\nI had the steak, of course, which was just a little bit beyond medium rare but very good anyway. I do think their spices on the steaks are not as good as other steakhouses but the meat is great.\nThe sides were good, mashed potatoes and string beans. Sides were a little small for the price, I think.\nOverall, great."

So, after a horrible experience the night before (see my other Las Vegas review), we decided to go to a place that we knew we could depend on.  Capital Grille Las Vegas is right across the street from The Wynn Hotel, so it was very convenient.  The seven  200lb men were very hungry after the bad meal we had the night before, and we weren't disappointed !   \n\nThe bread and the appetizers were awesome as usual.   The spicy calamari is awesome.  Every place makes calamari, but there's is saut\u00e9ed with peppers and it puts a new twist to the dish.  Also, the crab cakes were phenomenal.  The steaks were all made to perfection.  They know how to make a steak !  If you ask for it well done, they don't roll their  eyes and tell you that you're ruining it, or that the chef is going to be mad at you.  Good restaurants know how to make a well done steak tender AND juicy.   I had the  Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic, medium well done.  It was one of the best steaks I ever had.  It was huge, I couldn't even finish the whole thing.  My friends at the table we're fighting for the scraps.  Our waiter and his staff were awesome.   It's hard to keep seven big guys happy,  but somehow they catered to all of our needs.  All in all, it was a great meal and I can still say I've never had a bad meal or a complaint at any Capital Grille."

The wedge salad is a quarter of an entire head of lettuce, drenched in a ladle of thick blue cheese dressing and sprinkled with one-quarter inch cubes of what could be described as \"bacon bits\".  The steak was perfect as usual.  \n\nFor a side dish, the waiter recommended the lyonnaisse potatoes, a mix of idaho potatoes roasted crisp with caramelized onions.  The potatoes were a bit on the salty side, but i could not help but eat all of them anyway.\n\nNow I just need to wait until next January..."

They alway have wonderful soups and specials.  In addition to wonderful steaks I fancy their crab cakes and salads.  The wine list is fairly extensive here.  A nice touch-- if you are wearing black they will switch out your napkin so you don't get white lint on your clothes.  Touches like that make a difference.  One huge complaint--no apparent dress code.  I was in for a dinner service once where I was surrounded by people in jeans, sneakers, and baseball caps.  I don't appreciate that.  If I want to sit around and look at tables of people dressed all ghetto I'd have gone to the Peppermill (Not to knock the Peppermill;it can be fun at 4 a.m. when I am super drunk)  At least Ruth's Chris keeps it classy with a dress code."

They had a hand-written card thanking us for choosing them for our anniversary with heart-shaped sequins sprinkled on the table. We had a lovely view of the empty lot next door, which actually proved to be pretty entertaining. There were lots of drunk girls leaving the dayclubs at wynn/encore in their bikinis, and one guy who climbed out the escape hatch of a party bus and consequently had his entire group evicted from the bus. I imagine the people watching is probably less entertaining in the winter.\n\nThe food is pretty so-so, what you would expect from a chain steakhouse. I had the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails and my boyfriend had the Dry Aged Sirloin. We also had a side of the Sam's Mashed Potatoes. My steak was more medium than medium-rare, which I have found seems to be a problem at many places; I would probably order it rare in the future. The mashed potatoes were melt-in-your mouth delicious and oh-so buttery. When I ate the leftovers in the morning it tasted like I was eating a stick of butter (to clarify, I think that sounds delicious). \n\nWhat really put this from a 3-star to a 4-star review was all the little nice things they did for us for our anniversary. In addition to the cards and sequins, they also made us a dessert plate that said \"happy anniversary\" on it and brought out 2 glasses of sparkling wine. The waitress (Anali? Alani? something that started with an A) was friendly and helpful and really helped make our special day special.\n\nEdit: looking back at pictures, I now remember that we also had the steak tartare. I remember thinking it was good at the time, but it apparently wasn't very memorable."

Our server,who's name I cannot remember but was a rugby player, was extremely knowledgable on both the menu and drinks. Describing in detail about all ingredients and how how everything is prepared along with why they pair well together. He was very attentive and really knew how speak with us and the guest without making it awkward or bothersome. He really made our experience amazing! Sorry I don't remember his name because he really deserves recognition but I'm pretty sure he's the only rugby player there. They also set up our table with some nice decoration and wrote us a handwritten anniversary card.\n\nThe food was on a whole other level of delicious. We started off with the Lobster and crab cakes and the calamari. Both the best I've ever had! The calamari was nice and spicy but not to the point where it was uncomfortable to eat. The lobster/crab cakes tasted fresh and where nicely sized. Our main course was the tenderloins and butter-seared lobster. Best lobster tail I've ever had! The steak was juicy and perfectly cooked to temp. Our side to share was the lobster mac and cheese, let me just say it blew my mind! Not too salty or over cheesed  and had a good amount of lobster portioned in. Our server brought us complimentary dessert with \"happy anniversary\" written on the plate, which was really nice of him. Now I don't usually like cheese cake but this cheese cake was delicious and i loved it! \n\nOverall wonderful food and service! The decor is very upscale and nice with a nice view of the strip!"

It's a simple drink with not a lot of bite, but don't be fooled into thinking it's not potent. The concoction is allowed to sit for over a week in a large glass jar, which makes the vodka taste sweet and smooth. And it goes down easy, maybe a little too easy.\n\nAfter hanging out at the bar for a bit our party of four got a table in the dining room. While not my top choice of steakhouses in Las Vegas, The Capital Grille is still a good, dependable place to eat. It's a national chain and we've tried other locations before (in DC). It's got an old-fashioned, buttoned-up steakhouse feel. The kind of place that is perfect for the power lunch crowd.\n\nAs for the food, most of what we had was very good. The calamari was excellent and crispy. The lobster and crabcakes had large chunks of both crab and lobster with not much filler. The lobster bisque was a little on the bland side. The chopped salad was by far the worse thing we ate. I could pick leaves and weeds from my back yard, toss them in a dish and it would taste similar to their salad. All the steaks (delmonico, filet, and filet oscar) we had were perfectly cooked and seasoned and very tender. For desert we had the chocolate hazelnut cake, obnoxiously big and large enough for four people to share, it was deliciously chocolatey, sweet and moist.\n\nOur waiter did a solid job the whole night, except when the check arrived. He accidentally rung up another tables order on ours. So our bill was over $100 more than expected. For a restaurant of this caliber and a staff that is this well trained that type of error should never happen. But our waiter was quick to correct it and apologized profusely. Not the best way to end dinner, but it still didn't take away from the fact that the food is very good, although very traditional and conservative."

We made reservation for 7:30pm for Saturday.   We arrived a bit early ~ 7:15pm and were told they could seat us closer to our reservation time.  As we walked by the dining area to the bar, we did notice multiple tables that were open.  We were seated at 7:50 after having two drinks, in itself is no big deal. Everything went fine with ordering, etc, but things went astray when our food arrived.  I had ordered a filet mignon (medium rare) and my wife ordered lamb chops (medium).  My filet was cooked fine, however, my wife's lamb chops were over-cooked AND medium rare.  How they could be cooked differently, I don't know.  We waited for the server to come by but he didn't.  After a few minutes, a person came to fill our water and we asked for her to find our server.  A couple of minutes passed and she found someone else to ask what was the problem.  He noted they were not prepared correctly and took them away.  Isn't it the server's responsibility to come and check if we are satisfied with our food?  During this time, I ate about half my meal while my wife waited for her chops.  The manager (Robert Clark) did come to apologize and asked if he could take my filet and re-heat it so we could eat together.  I also asked him to take the asparagus as they were cold and had gotten wilted.  It took over 15 more minutes before our dinner came to us.  Mr. Clark brought my wife's dinner to insure it met with our expectations, which this time it was prepared as requested.  Their second most popular item should not take so long to be sent out, especially if it is for a client that has been waiting so long. The server brought us our bill and apologized.  At the end of the day what's the big deal?  I ate half my meal believing my wife's would be brought within a few minutes, but instead she waited for her entr\u00e9e about 30 minutes after finishing our salads.  This is suppose to be a quality steakhouse. This was the second time this happened.  The previous time, my Delmonico steak was not prepared property and that too took an inordinate amount of time to get back my entr\u00e9e.  In neither instance did we receive more than an apology, taking the entr\u00e9e off the bill, free dessert, nothing.  High-quality restaurants should not only apologize for their mistakes; they should make up for them.  Last, in comparing a similar price-point establishment we have been to Delmonico's in the Venetian at least a half-dozen times and have NEVER had to send anything back.  I could only say the view won't overcome the service again."

It's actually a chain restaurant owned by Black Angus.  Just a little interesting tidbit thrown in there for ya!  He's eaten at the Washington D.C. and Philadelphia location so now, he can add LV to his list of CGs he's been to.  My husband has raved about the quality of food and service he has received from the other locations for months so we decided to give it a try!\n\nA group of at least 10 of us had taken a trip to LV for the weekend.  On our last evening, we had a nice dinner with Constantine as our server.  I kid you not, that was his name.  I thought of the movie, \"Constantine\" which suuuucked!  Anyhoo, he looked nothing at all like Keanu Reeves.  \n\nI was a bit disappointed by the food.  For appetizers, we had the pan fried calamari with hot cherry peppers which came out a bit cold.  The presentation was not impressive as it looked like limp, fried calamari bits strewn about, mixed with cherry peppers.  CG is known for its steaks so for the main course, I had the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Carmelized Shallot Butter.    I was sold on the title of the dish but upon coming out, the meat was dry after stating that I did want it cooked medium rare.  My husband had ordered the Steak Au Poivre which looked amazing and he ate every, single bite of it.  There are no sides that accompany the steak dishes so we ordered fresh vegetables and mashed potatoes.  \n\nWhat saves this restaurant are the desserts.  We tried the key lime pie, creme brulee, and the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  The key lime pie as my husband stated, \"Was on point.\"  It is a pricey place.  Two people would easily cost $150 without drinks.  The view is beautiful so request to be seated near the window.  I'm torn on weather I'd come here again."

            "review": "Beautiful, elegant restaurant with an amazing view. Located on the third floor of the Fashion Show Mall facing the Wynn/Encore, the restaurant's location can be a bit of a journey to find as there is no entrance to the restaurant inside the mall. There is only one door- the front door which is outside- that leads you inside the restaurant, but the food, service & ambiance make the journey worthwhile. \n\nThe restaurant itself is romantic and classic, with mahogany accents and warm lighting, perfect for a date night or special celebration. The night I went was very busy. I made a 7:30 reservation for a party of 4 earlier in the day, and even though I arrived on time, the rest of my party was running a bit late. Thankfully, the hostess didn't cancel our reservation, and said that they would set up our table once everyone in my party arrived. That was just the beginning of the outstanding service my party and I experienced that night at The Capital Grille. \n\nWe were seated in a booth next to the floor-to-ceiling windows that encase a good portion of the restaurant. Our server was wonderful- very attentive, knowledgable and energetic. After bringing out our drinks and the bread basket (an assortment of rolls, crackers, etc.), without asking us, he brought us an appetizer of Shrimp Cocktail, saying he thought we would enjoy it. Enjoy it we did. The shrimp were fresh and plump, and the cocktail sauce had a kick. Very good! \n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Lobster and Crab Stuffed Shrimp- Delicately butterflied shrimp stuffed with fresh lobster and crab, lightly breaded, and roasted with a touch of wine. Good, but not \"Oh my goodness, you've got to try this!\" amazing. I enjoyed the flavorful, meaty filling, but I found the dish a bit dry. It would have been better with more of the creamy sauce. \n\nThe rest of my party ordered:\nDouble Cut Lamb Rip Chops- Four, flavorful double cut rib chops with a side of fruit chutney (cherry, I think). The portion size was perfect, and the owner of this dish seemed to enjoy it, as nothing was left on the plate.\n\nCedar Planked Salmon with Tomato Fennel Relish- A fillet of North Atlantic salmon seasoned with fennel pollen, roasted on a cedar plank and finished with lemon mosto and Tomato Fennel Relish. The fillet size was shockingly large, and while the salmon was fresh, the dish lacked seasoning (due to the simple preparation of the fish, which I'm guessing was to highlight the natural flavor of the fresh salmon). \n\nDry Aged Porterhouse Steak- 24-oz. dry-aged steak. Recommended by our server. The portion was enormous, and while there was a lot of meat, it wasn't the best quality of steak (as noted by the owner of this dish). \n\nSide order of Parmesan Truffle Fries-  Golden fries tossed in shredded Grana Padano, kosher salt and white truffle oil. Crunchy, savory and the truffle flavor wasn't too overpowering. I really enjoyed this side.\n\nSide order of Fresh Asparagus with Hollandaise- Garden fresh asparagus cooked al dente to a most delicate crispness, and served with their own Hollandaise sauce. \n\nSide order of Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms- A hearty blend of mushrooms (Portabella, Oyster, Shiitake, and Cremini), slowly oven roasted with extra virgin olive oil, rosemary, thyme and garlic butter. Delicious. \n\nWe also ordered dessert and coffee to finish the meal. Our server recommended the Fresh Berries in Vanilla Cream- A blend of strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and blueberries in a velvety smooth Creme Anglaise. The dessert was light and not too sweet- a perfect way to end a memorable night."

            "review": "This was our first venture to The Capital Grille and it was a very enjoyable experience. We normally stay away from the craziness of the Strip since we live in Vegas but after looking at their website and having received a $50 off gift card from American Express we decided to give it a try.\n\nAfter a little confusion as to where the front entrance was located we were promptly seated in a corner that allowed us a panoramic view of the strip which was beautiful as we were right across from the Wynn.  It was lunch time however they were not very busy, quiet atmosphere and very comfortable. Our server was very attentive and pleasant. \n\nI normally shy away from crab cakes as I have been sorely disappointed in the past--too much breading or too greasy. However our server explained that their Lobster & Crab Cakes are pan seared then baked in the oven and \"wonderful\". And she was correct. I thoroughly enjoyed them  as they had large chucks of both lobster & crab and not just shredded pieces. For my lunch entree I decided on the Main Lobster Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette which was just as enjoyable. The vinaigrette was light and truly accented the taste of the lobster which included large chunks of lobster as well as the claw meat.  I would certainly order both again... \n\nMy husband ordered a steak with mashed potatoes- his steak was cooked to order and he very much enjoyed his selection as well. \n\nWe are planning on returning as there were several other items that peaked our interest especially on the dinner menu. I am hoping our night time visit is just as relaxing and enjoyable. \n\nMy one suggestion would be to check out their on-line menu to have an idea of what you may want as there are seemingly many tasty items to select from."

They were great, we got stuck in a monster track jam and our cabbie had to go through the backroads so we were running late for the reservation but checking in along the way.  We showed up about 20 minutes late and, fortunately, they still seated us.  It wasn't super crowded at that point but it packed in right after.  \n\nThe decor is nice and relaxing with a chill view.  It's not like a \"fake\" or forced Vegas experience, I don't think.  Just a nice steakhouse overlooking the back end of the strip.\n\nWe got a great waiter - Frankie.  It has to be part of a schtick but he looks and acts like a combo of Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro, ya know, the \"badda bing New Yahk\" thing.  Great guy, funny... very honest about the menu.  He told me the special and then said, \"But don't get that... get this...\"\n\nI'm totally blowing it on this review, as I saved it a while ago but didn't finish it, but I forgot exactly what steak I got... sorry!  But, it was just stupid good.  My friend got a different kind - also amazing.  We had a combo of sides and starters, like salads, mashed potatoes, veggies, etc.  All good.  I get the impression that you can't go wrong here.\n\nI'd definitely recommend but get a reservation - just to be safe.  \n\n\nTip... don't try to find the damn hidden elevator in the parking garage below... you'll waste 15 minutes on a wild goose chase... just walk up the little stairs to the blvd, then take the escalator up."

The server actually said this, no really, \"I felt it with my finger.\" What? You put your finger in my soup? I hope he meant the heat generated by the saucer under the cup of  French onion. The soup was very ordinary. My steak was adequate. Hard to import a restaurant, put it in a place like LV, and hope things will work out. Some of the celeb locations here are hot at times, but they do not keep up a consistent delivery of food and service. Best thing all of them have going for themselves is PR, which means hype."

We were seated immediately to a table that was near the window and nicely decorated with confetti, candy & a card (see pics). \nServer was nice and informative. We started with drinks I think it was a pineapple martini, it was ok, we're not big drinkers so the alcohol was strong and we only had one that we could barely finish lol\n -appetizer hubby got a spinach salad which he liked, and I got the lobster bisque which with each spoonful I died and went to lobster heaven! Lots of sweet chunks of lobster and the soup itself was creamy but light, I would've been happy just having that dish.\n-we got out entree I forgot the names but I think hubby got the ribeye and I got a surf & turf. Sides were mashed potato & asparagus. Steaks were awesome, sides were meh, we didn't finish the potatoes.\n-for my bday they brought out a sampler with writing (see pics) it was delish. The chocolate cake was very rich so it would be good to share and cheesecake was perfect.\n\nAll in all, service was great! Also for u \"winos\" we noticed that if u asked for the wine list they have an expert wine guy come to your table and explain everything u need to know (maybe too much lol). I'd say fairly priced for the quality of food and service you're gonna get."

We like the comfy booth seating and large windows facing the Strip. The service is friendly, accommodating, and attentive. Unfortunately the food does not match up. \n\nAppetizer: the only good dish we had today was the fried calamari with peppers though it was a bit oily. \n\nSoup: French onion soup looked appetizing, but the soup and onions were way too salty. \n\nLunch entrees: Salmon and mango salad with champagne vinegrette had potential, but the salmon was dry on the sides and lacked flavor. The mangos were hard and sour. Previous Yelper had voiced disappointment with this dish too. \n\nChilean Seabass was so-so and a tad dry, but the mushrooms were unbearably salty in the soy sauce. Palazzo's SushiSamba has way better moist Chilean sea bass. \n\nLobster and crab cake burger is supposed to be a top seller, but the crab cake had too much flour. The lobster also was dry. The housemade salt and vinegar chips were good. \n\nSide: lobster mac n' cheese was a disappointment as the lobsters did not taste fresh. The lobster was very dry and far from succulent. I often order this dish at various restaurant, and this was one of the worse ones since the lobster was bad. The mac n'cheese were good though. If you like lobster, go to Top of the World at the Stratosphere for fresh succulent Canadian lobster. \n\nDessert: they were very kind and offered us a dessert duo of chocolate cake and cheesecake. We were hoping the dessert would be better, but unfortunately, the best part about dessert were the fresh berries that came with it. There is a fresh berries dessert on the menu too. I would recommend that. \n\nOverall, the service is great, but the food was disappointing. With so many delicious culinary delights to choose from in Vegas, Capital Grille does not stand the heat. It needs to improve it's quality and taste of food. I have never been for dinner, but lunch was a regrettable experience."

I'd heard of The Capital Grille in DC, and saw this one at the Fashion Show Mall (short walk from our hotel) so I made a reservation online and we went for dinner.\n\nIt was a Saturday night. They were busy, but not so much that it diminished the service one bit. From the personal greeting at the podium (I'd entered my last name online for the reservation, and the hostess used it; the person who took us to our table used it; and our waiter addressed us as Mr. and Mrs. when he introduced himself. I thought that was a nice touch.\n\nOur waiter, Ryan, was everything a server should be. Personable, great sense of humor (while being appropriate at all times), completely knowledgeable of the menu, made great recommendations, and he was extremely efficient. There was also a young lady who ensured we never ran out of water. I think that might have been her only job, and she did it very well. (kidding, I'm sure she does other things, I just didn't see them).\n\nWe started with the spicy calamari appetizer, and it was delicious. We didn't finish it, because we wanted room for the entrees, but I can tell you it tasted nearly as good the next day warmed up in our NewWave. The variety of peppers really made the calamari flavors stand out, this may be the first time I had calamari without any dipping sauce, and I didn't miss the sauces at all.\n\nI had the double cut lamb rib chops. There are 4 of them, about 12 ounces in total. I ordered them medium rare, and they were cooked perfectly. I love lamb when it's made right, and this was as good as it gets.\n\nMy wife had the bone-in ribeye, also medium rare. She loved it, and I had a bite and it was also cooked perfectly. \n\nWe had two sides to share, Sam's mashed potatoes (creamy and delicious) and maybe the best sweet corn I've ever had. It was fresh cut from the cob, as kernels were still together, and they mixed in some peppers and the combo of the sweet corn and spicy peppers was amazing. I mixed some in with the mashed potatoes, and it was great, but I found I preferred savoring each separately instead.\n\nWe shared the chocolate cake for dessert. It was good, can't say we were overly impressed but by then we'd had so much great food it might have just been us. \n\nPrices are high for casual dining (our total with tip was about $270) but well worth it, IMO, for a special night out. The entire dining experience at The Capital Grille in Las Vegas was wonderful - they pamper you, make you feel special, and the food is delicious and the portions are generous.\n\nOh, one more example of the \"little touches\" they do to make your dinner special - we noticed my napkin was white, but my wife's was black, so she asked Ryan about it. He said they match the color to the clothing their guests are wearing - she had on a black dress, and he said that was so she wouldn't end up with white lint on her dress. Makes sense, but I've never seen that at any other restaurant, no matter how fancy."

I'm not complaining on anything i just think at the high end restaurant like this i walk in expecting great service and food, but to say i give 5 will be overrated. i've only had very few 5 star experience and this could well be one of them being in the lovely atmosphere and the service, but i don't think it was a five star food, and even though my steak was cooked the way i wanted it and the decor of the plate was very nice, i've had better steaks, although their sides were surprisingly delicious! i think i think its fair to give 4 stars but i don't know if i'll be back there unless i get invited out."

Cannot say enough good things about the place.\nMy only caveat is that the wines are priced a bit higher than other, nearby restaurants.  The same bottle of Catena Malbec at the Capital Grille was $15 more than at the Yard House; still a great bottle for the money, and one is paying for the experience, but. . . . \nWould eat here again and again.

We decided to go here because they were apart of restaurant week and they were offering the most diverse selection on their pre-fixed menu compared to other places participating. It was $30.10 per person for a 3-course lunch.\n\nMy first impressing upon walking in to this place was... \"YOU FANCY HUH?!?!\" Its located in the fashion show mall, so I wasn't really expecting anything super fancy, but it was. White table clothes, dark wood, wine glasses, and lunch having executives. We were greeted by the host, a not so friendly older lady, who didn't really give us the impression that she wanted us to eat there. But we shrugged it off and the service actually ended up being pretty good. \n\n1st course:\nI went for the clam chowder. This dish was actually a pleasant surprise due to its copious amounts of clams. It had a nice creamy but not too oily soup base with my oh so favorite oyster crackers! The GF went for the french onion soup. I wasn't much of a fan, I thought it was a bit too salty but she on the other hand likes that kinda thing so she loved it. It was the run of the mill french onion soup IMHO.\n\n2nd course:\nShe was starving so she opted for the The Grille's Signature Cheeseburger with truffle fries. This was a very large sirloin patty with smoked bacon, sweet onions, and havarti cheese on an onion roll. If you have an appetite I would most likely suggest this burger because its huge. The truffle fries were delish and friend to perfection. I went for the Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon. It was a large filet of salmon seared to perfection over some asparagus and onions. It was probably one of the most juiciest salmons I've ever had. \n\n3rd course:\nWe went for the usual creme brulee which I think is pretty much the same at most locations. Its pretty hard to do a creme brulee wrong, but of course Capital Grille's was ginormous. And we also got the Strawberries Capital Grille that consisted of fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream topped with Grand Marnier. This was mediocre, some sweeter strawberries probably would have helped the cause.\n\nFor what we paid, we definitely got a deal with the enormous portions they served. It was a nice place but the food wasn't super memorable. Dinner may be a different story."

We wanted a steak and seafood place where we could stay on track nutritionally, eat a great meal, and not spend as much as a car payment. While it is part of a chain, this place had its own personality worthy of our sole big dinner out on this trip.  More importantly, the food was fantastic!  \nI ordered the spinach salad with mushrooms and bacon ($11) and the sliced filet with a fig essence Demi glac\u00e9 and tiny onions (mid $40s). I initially had food envy at the sight of the BF's gorgeously seared scallops ($43) but my filet was fantastic. \n The vibe is very warm and clubby lit by the soft glow of amber pendant lights. Good for a nice dinner with your sweetie or a group of close groups.  This is Las Vegas and the huge windows revealed the over the top advertising that is everywhere.  That was a little distracting but I'm not sure what can be done.  My boyfriend asked, \"What are you thinking?\" To which I replied, \"Just wondering if that's Donnie Osmond in the top high doing high kicks.\"  Just something to keep in mind if you want a romantic spot to bare your soul."

Since we were a large group, we had our own lil room with large portraits of unknown men (two to be exact)....the bf mentioned that it was a $3,000 minimum that needed to be spent. \n\nWe all started off with drinks....my Riesling was not too dry and that's the kind of wine I like. The bf's boss ordered the Coldshell Fish Platter, Pan Fried Calamari and Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella. My favorite out of all of those was the Fried Calamari. I loved how it was a lil spicy, crispy and oh so delicious! YUM! The oysters were HUGE....almost the size of my palm. Everything else was good, but the calamari is what stood out in my mind. \n\nFor an entree, I decided to go with Seared Tenderloin with the Butter Poached Lobster and a cup of the Clam Chowder. The bf ordered some kind of steak and the Lobster Bisque. This lady at the table was raving about the Lobster Bisque and how it had real chunks of lobster in it. The soups and salads arrived fairly quickly and let's just note that the Lobster Bisque....not so awesome. Clam Chowder was definitely WAY better than the bisque. My beef tenderloins were tender and I believe there were 3 or 4 tenderloins plus the lobster. I thought it was tender and tasty, nothing too special. Lobster was cooked well and was very buttery. I was extremely full by the time my tenderloins came out so I'm not sure I appreciated it to its full extent. \n\nFor the sides, we shared everything family style. Creamed Spinach, Parmesan truffle fries, Sam's Mashed Potatoes, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Fresh Asparagus with Hollaindaise Sauce, Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms and Au Gratin Potatoes was what was ordered. Out of everything I really loved the Sam's Mashed Potatoes and the Creamed Spinach. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was probably my least favorite....not very flavorful and just not what I expected it to be. The Au Gratin Potatoes had this delightful crust on top which was pretty awesome. \n\nService was attentive and everything was overall fairly good. Nothing was knock me of my chair awesome, but I thought it was a good meal nonetheless."

I got to the dinner late and had been seated for no less than 15 minutes before I was able to flag down a waiter to get a drink. Then when I attempted to place my order the waiter stood there and argued with me about what I ordered (apparently a co-worker was previously in my chair and moved to another table so I could take her spot). Regardless, I'm perfectly capable of remembering whether or not I placed an order. As such, I do not appreciate being argued with by my waiter and finally told that I would get what he thought I ordered and could deal with it then. When I finally got my well done New York Strip (yes I'm one of those people who doesn't enjoy my meat bleeding on my plate, terrible I know), I find that it is medium rare. Well done and medium rare are not the same thing... not even a little.. there are like 2 steps in between them. My steak was taken back and came back medium... still not well done like I originally ordered. Needless to say I will not be returning."

Like butter to carve into. Nothing fell short in my meal, except for the key lime pie I opted to try. I never had it. Twas my first time and I swear it tasted literally like a key...squirted with lime...made into a pie. Hence, key lime pie. I don't have anything to compare it to other than I will never eat a key lime pie for as long as I live. I will order a filet mignon rare (gulp) if I had a choice between the two. \n\nWith that said...CG did not disappoint (unless you're coming for key lime pie and expecting it to not taste like a key...lime...pie). Service was wonderful! While there are other great steakhouses in and along the boulevard...it's nice that this one isn't tucked into one of the casinos. \n\nA definite potential for steak option along the strip. Certainly recommend! I'd leave the kids at home on this trip, though!\n\nEnjoy!"

I would also take advantage of the offer valet service next to the Forever 21 entrance.  There is a quick elevator that will take you straight to the 3rd floor and into the restaurant.   I was greeted immediately with a smile and escorted to a window table facing the strip per my special request during my reservation.  \n\nI was impressed with the food too.   We ordered the seared salmon, miso sea bass, south African steak, truffle fries, lobster mac and cheese, and a lobster tail served with butter.  My favorite was the south African steak and the miso sea bass.   It was prepared very tendered and you can taste the freshness with every bite.  \n\nOur server, Les Forehand, was exceptional.  He made a good recommendation on our entrees and checked on us quite frequently to ensure we are enjoying our celebration.   He also made sure our drinks are always refiled without our request.   Now the most impressive service i received was his talent in taking pictures of us.   The lighting in the restaurant was dimmed, so he knew the pictures would com out dark.  To ensure our pictures had the perfect lighting, Les immediately grabbed his phone so he can use the flashlight while taking our pictures.  I was so impressed with his help and he did a good job capturing good shots for us.\n\nOverall, i was very impressed with my experience.   My husband also had his bachelor party here and he had a private room with exceptional food and experience just like  my experience.   I would highly recommend having a private special event if you want good service and food.  Bon Appetite!!!!!"

The kitchen reminds me of the one in Hell's Kitchen! Everything looked really nice; nice ambiance and food presentation.\n\nNow, for the food.  We ordered the Wagyu beef carpaccio, clam chowder, lobster mac 'n' cheese and filet mignon.  Btw, the bread basket was good too...nice variety.  The beef carpaccio was OK...a little too much of the wasabi flavor.  The clam chowder and lobster mac 'n' cheese...MMMmmmm!!  Both were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS (I also generally a fan of mac 'n' cheese)!!  However, I expected much more lobster in the mac 'n'cheese.  The filet mignon was alright; whatever sauce they plated the filet with was salty.  I asked for the meat to be cooked to Medium and it was still pretty juicy--I've had much better for about half the price.\n\nIf I was rating based on the main dish alone I would go with 3 stars.

Crammed chock full of political memorabilia, cigar smoke and wine, they also made a killer martini. Since I wore a short skirt, the martini's were free. What got me eating was the curious slabs of beef hanging in the window. \"Dry Aged\" is what they call it. This is not a new way of curing a steak but the very first way, pre-refrigeration, allowing the connective tissues to naturally decompose creating a very tender meat. I had what they call the Kona-Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin (or something like that) and it was fabulous! The meat melted in my mouth. Definitely a must return-to place. Then, I took a girlfriend to the Vegas one and down went the opinion polls even though I ordered the very same thing. Maybe it was the pretentious, lah-di-dah crowd waving $100 bills (newly-minted rubes from down in the holler?), the mall we had to wind through to get here fighting off aggressive Israeli \"Red Sea\" salt-crystal venders, or the over-the-top waiter (\"Eh, gulls, I killa fa yew\") and so-so steak (it obviously wasn't made for Ted Kennedy's gluttonous taste ) but that'll be an Aye vote for DC and a Nay vote for Vegas.

My colleagues and I came here for a team dinner after a long day, and it was definitely a relaxing and pleasant experience.  The decor is muted, somewhat dark, a bit soothing.  I didn't have much interaction with the waiter, but have no service complaints.\n\nMy filet mignon was cooked perfectly and quite tasty, though not particularly exciting flavor-wise (e.g., no sauce or interesting seasoning... but some might prefer it that way, I admit).  The Caesar salad: crisp and delicious.  And the desserts?  Those were outstanding!  From the creme brulee to the cakes... mmmm!"

            "review": "Capital Grille has always been one of our favorite places to go for a \"dress-up, fancy\" dinner.  We usually save dinners at this location for our birthdays or anniversaries.  As all Capital Grille locations go, the ambiance is outstanding and the decor beautiful.  The Las Vegas location looks over the strip, so if you can get a window seat, it's pretty cool.  You're right across the street from the Wynn and located on the third floor of the Fashion Show Mall.\nWe usually get steaks here, as they are awesome.  The Porcini Rubbed Aged Balsamic Rib Eye is my absolute favorite.  The spinach salad with bacon is in my opinion, the best salad.  You can order lobster as an appetizer and they will pull it out of the shell and cut it up in to bite size pieces, which makes for a very fancy app.  The lobster mac-n-cheese is just awesome.  It's rich and has many pieces of lobster, so highly recommend this as a side dish.  The asparagus is also good.\nThe last couple times we've been to the Capital Grille (2014 and 2013), we've been sat next to tables with children.  In 2013, in fact, when we were seated, we noticed a very large party that was coming in soon...as there was a huge, long table prepared behind us.  When they arrived, there were more children than adults and they were out of control.  This ruined the experience.  Last fall, 2014, when we visited for our anniversary, we were sat, and once again next to children...we asked to be moved, and the next table was also next to a child, which, thank goodness was quiet, but the table location sucked.  We believe that an upscale, fancy, expensive restaurant should have a section where they put people with children so the other people that are dining out and celebrating special dates can have a peaceful meal.  Because of these last two experiences, we've decided that we will no longer go to the Capital Grille for special celebrations...this is disappointing, as the food is always good."

            "review": "I came here for lunch on a friday afternoon especially since friends have raved about the truffle fries here and no way can I turn that down.  First thing that caught my attention was the outstanding service that we received.  My server changed out my white napkin for a black one cuz I was wearing black pants and she didn't want lint to get all over me.  I have been to all kinds of establishments and this was the first time I have had this happen to me...5 stars for that alone.\n\nSo 2 of us shared a burger and a basket of truffled fries and a mediterranean salad with chicken.  The server had the kitchen split everything for us which was great.  The burger came out on plates that had holes for their sauce container and let me tell you that was one good burger.  This place sure knows how to handle their beef.  And the truffle fries were good but the only back part is I like skinny fries but it was greatr otherwise.  I can't say the same for the chicken in my salad though.  The salad was great but the chicken was dry as h***....which was why I had to take out one star.  I should know by now never order chicken or seafood at a steakhouse.  \n\nDefinitely will come back again on future visit...the french onion soup looked really good!"

After endless time searching on opentable I stumbled across the capital grille! I've eaten at plenty of their other locations in other cities and I must say that the consistency in excellent food and service has never failed! Upon arriving we were kindly greeted by a gentleman and a young lady who checked us in! I requested a table near the window so we could take in the fantastic views of the strip! We were briefed on our table being ready in a few moments and invited to have a few drinks at the bar! I asked the bartender what was a popular drink and he suggested the \"Stolli Dolli\" YUCK! I don't know how that drink could even be on the menu as a favorite but then again to each is own right? Anyways I went with my regular Hennessy & Sprite and we also ordered a mojito.. Both drinks were just \"OK\" and for $29 I wouldn't expected a lot more needless to say that bar experience was not as good as the dining experience! Once we were seated we were now greeted by our fabulous waiter JEFF! This guy is beyond an amazing and provides some of the upmost world class customer service! He truly made our dining experience a memorable one! The food was delicious! For starters the calamari was out of this world good!! Entrees we went with the Surf & Turf which consisted of I believe a 9oz Lobster Tail and 10oz Filet Mignon, Delmonico Steak and the Lobster Mac N Cheese! Put it this way we had no left overs and even had room for dessert! Above all this experience will definitely have us returning for more!"
