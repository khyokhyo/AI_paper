            "review": "Pizza and beer for Breakfast it was. They open at 11 and we were the first ones there. The pizza and ingredients are all made fm scratch. It's Delicious!  Honestly one of the Best Pizzeria I have ever been to! The personal pizza is good enough, you can order a side salad or butternut squash soup on the side, both delicious!! I would definitely come back here again and again on my next visit to Las Vegas!! My husband ordered the 5 cheese and he loved it! I had the another signature, has white sauce, ricotta cheese blended with other good cheese, spinach and bacon inside. Both pizzas were Very tasty!!"

            "review": "I recently stayed at Aria for a conferece and dined here twice - both of my experiences were good!  I will say, as I have in other reviews for Vegas establishments, it's VEGAS....things on the Strip are NOT cheap, so if you go expecting to spend very little money, you're going to be in for a rude awakening.  I'm only saying this because I frquently see reviews comment on how things are pricey in comparison to what you get/quality.  \n\nSecond, this restaurant is located next to the sports bar so yes, you will should expect the atmosphere to be dominated by sports (not to mention that a lot of people do go to Vegas because of sports).\n\nNow, the food.  The first night I ate here my friend and I shared the wings and a pizza and we each got a shake.  The wings were just okay, the pizza was good and the strawberry shake was Delish!   The second night I ate here I got the chooped salad, garlic knots and yes, you guessed it...a strawberry shake!   The next time I eat here I am going to try the Chef's Selection Charcuterie/Mozzarella....and of course, a strawberry shake!!\n\nNothing really stood out to me regarding service, which means that it was probably fine.  In general, the location is good, the ambiance is cool and I like that there's the option of grabbing a slice to go.  Will be back the next time I stay at Aria."

            "review": "The food was good but very expensive. My friend and I needed somewhere casual to eat inside Aria and because this restaurant was listed as such, we thought that the prices would reflect that. I ordered a whole pizza at $28, but you can walk up and order by the slice for about $5 and change. The Forager Pizza consists of a white sauce and plenty of mozzarella topped with mushrooms, spinach, large pieces of ham and whipped ricotta. It had a balance of salty and sweet but the ham became overwhelming and it could have used a better ratio of veggies. My friend ordered the Spaghetti and added Housemade Meatballs. We both agreed that the spaghetti was tasty but the meatballs were off. The beer selection is fantastic, as is the decor. I just didn't feel that the food that we received exactly hit the mark or was worth the high price."

            "review": "We arrived around 5:30pm headed to one of the shows. The restaurant area was less than 1/2 full, if that.. \n\nThe couple we came with walked up to the bar, during Happy Hour, and got a good price on a couple of drinks and then we were seated. We quickly found out that you had to sit at the bar for Happy Hour prices, otherwise drinks were full price. That put a  limit or an end to what was purchased, with that said the drinks were normal tourist price but were terrible. \n\nNow, the food \n\nWe both ordered a Build your own 16\" pizza with a starting price of $22, for cheese only. there were 3 sub areas of ingredients that could be added. Each area was from $2 to $4 per ingredient. \n\nThe waitress raved about how good this, potentially $40 - $50 pizza was going to be so we went it. Honestly, the food was ok but it wasn't even close to what I would call great pizza. If i had paid $20 for it then i would recommend the place but it's hugely overpriced even for a tourist area. \n\nif you're looking for good pizza at a decent price -- go somewhere else\n\nI don't see us going back"

The beer selection is also good so can't really think of any reason to not give it 5 stars. \nWe had the Margherita and a the Gotham."

            "review": "Have been to Vegas a couple of times in the past year, and each time my girlfriend and I enjoyed checking out the City Center area and all it has to offer. We bought tickets to see the Cirque Du Soleil Zarkana show at Aria. After the show we stumbled upon Five50 nestled away in a back corner on the lobby level of the hotel. The restaurant received some good reviews on Yelp, so we decided to check it out. Now Five50 is our go-to pizza spot!\n\nIt is labeled as a \"casual pizza experience,\" but the ambience of the hotel and restaurant add to its charm. As you walk into the restaurant, there is a long counter that acts as an extension of the kitchen. Here you can place to go orders for pizza and other items. There are also tables just outside the restaurant where you can stand and eat your pizza for a quicker dining experience. The restaurant has definite character and personality. A long curved wall of wooden blocks stacked on top of each other separate the diners from the rest of the hotel/casino. Behind the restaurant is the sports book room where sports junkies can get their fix and gamble on events. There is a circular bar located in the center of the restaurant, along with tv's for your viewing pleasure. The service was a little hit and miss, but overall decent. \n\nThe menu offers eclectic pizza choices such as the truffle pizza (I would recommend this!), soups/salads, and pastas. The pizza is prepared fresh and cooked perfectly. Five50 offers a unique casual pizza experience with good food, and all the benefits of a Vegas establishment."

            "review": "Two course lunch special at 18, not a bad deal. We were staying in the Aria and were hungry before checkout and decided to give Five50 Pizza Bar a try. The service was ok, the food was okay. We didn't have reservations and checked in with the hostess who said there was about a forty minute wait for a table but there were open seats in the bar. We decided to sit at the bar, but soon realized that the service at the bar was super slow. One bartender, ten plus seats. The bartender finally gave us some menus and more than enough time to decide. We went with the two course lunch special: first course: seasonal soup or the spinach and pear salad, second course: mezza luna pasta, personal pizza (up to three toppings), or a specialty pizza. I went with the seasonal soup which was tomato bisque and the Farmstead specialty pizza. The bartender was super sweet but was also super busy which led to a lot of wait time.\n\nThe tomato bisque was served first. It was a mediocre soup; creamy but a tad bland. I would have liked to have a piece of bread or some type of carb to go with it. It was not anything beyond mediocre. After what felt like a long time of waiting, our individual sized pizzas arrived at the bar. The Farmstead pizza is topped with creme fraiche, country olives, prosciutto, arugula and a farm egg. This sounded a lot tastier on paper than when it came out. They are very stingy with the ingredients and my pizza was a bit bland. I was expecting the egg to be cooked over easy on the pizza but instead the yolk on the egg was fully cooked and I was not able to disperse it all over the pizza. Disappointing. I was also missing the ooey gooey cheesiness of a traditional pizza.\n\nConclusion: I should've went with the personal create-your-own pizza. I assumed that the specialty pizzas were the way to go, but that's not true. My boyfriend created a pizza that topped mine by a milestone. Also, we saw many unoccupied tables throughout our meal and wondered why the wait time was said to be forty minutes. The pros about Five50 Pizza Bar is that you can get a whole pizza or an individual slice, the two course lunch special for 18 bucks, and they are open late for that nice greasy slice before bed. The cons: pizza was dry and the ingredients were scarce, the flavors did not blow me away, and you can get a tastier (and cheaper) slice of pizza on the strip. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."

Well, while it was ok, it wasn't the best compared to other places we ate.  First things came slowly and service was only ok.  We split a basic pizza, mushroom and peperoni; the flavor was great but the large slices and semi dried (over cooked maybe) peperoni cut the roof and other areas of my mouth.  I should have cut my slices but the dough was too tough and cutting was not an option unless I asked for a steak knife as I had already tried to cut the ends and gave up.  I love pizza but this just wasn't the best."

            "review": "Living in Los Angeles, but being an east coast guy, it can be trying sometimes dealing with the certifiably awful, tasteless pies Angeleno's call pizza. I wasn't expecting any different of Vegas, but upon a casino shop worker's recommendation we tried Five50 for a slice and a beer one night. We sidled on up to the bar for a late night snack. I had the forager, a white sauce, mushroom, spinach and ricotta concoction, while the wife had the simple five cheese.\n\nWow, good pizza. Really good pizza. No, seriously, really good pizza. So good, we came back the next night and ordered a whole cheese with whipped ricotta and wood oven fired tomatoes. Even better. Really an eclectic take on a classic east coast pizza, done wood oven style with crispy crust. They also had a good selection of pricey but tasty tap beers. \n\nPut aside for a minute that its rather expensive for pizza , a single pie is $25 to $30, and beers run $8-$9 cocktails $14, then again everything in Vegas seems to be pricey these days, this was easily the best pie I have had in LV to date. Cost knocks it down from 5 stars, and service was spotty at times, but certainly not terrible. \n\nRecommended if you need either a quick slice or a whole pie, a single pizza would serve 3, and is plenty for 2. Recommended!"

            "review": "We made reservations at Five50 for 5:30pm on July 16th.  We were greeted by the friendly hostesses. We were escorted to one of the booths - very comfortable.\n\nFirst, we were served breadsticks and Artisan Sparkling Water.\n\nThen I enjoyed the excellent appetizers and salads. The Grilled Garlic Sausage with white beans and fennel salad was my favorite and I also enjoyed the Arugula & Fennel salad. The Tomato Salad and Pork Porchetta were enjoyable too. Note: There were 3 adults a toddler and infant in our party, so we shared the tastes.\n\nOur server, John, was professional, courteous and attended to our needs.\nI told him a type of beer I liked and I asked what he recommended. He said a Ballast Point on tap - smooth.\n\nWe ordered two pizzas, a Truffle Pizza (more than mushrooms) and a Margherita Pizza topped with basil (my favorite of the two). The pizza was not greasy like some fast food delivery places. It was crisp and fine.\n\nHaving something sweet to go with your pizza is a must.  I shared a Fried Zeppole with powdered lemon sugar and limoncello sabayon, and also the Milk-Chocolate-Lavender Custard dessert.\n\nThe architecture was fascinating: the cylindrical features, variety of materials, and choice of artwork. In different areas, you have black and white tiles, a dark wood, a long chalkboard (possibly 2) with menu items and drinks listed, light wood, a mesh of wood or metal.\n\nWe spent just under 90 minutes there. The All-Star Game was on the TV, but the TV wasn't \"in your face\" or the main focus of the restaurant. \n\nAfter paying the bill, and was getting up, I asked our server about the different types of seating, just because I wanted to know.  There is a private table for a group of about 10, some booths like the one we sat in, table seating from semi-private to what I would call \"center of attention\", and bar seating which is well spaced.  As we were leaving, I saw the counter area and the ovens set at Five50 that's [550 degrees Fahrenheit].  I saw Shawn McClain and it was good to talk to him for a few seconds.\n\nIt's an excellent place to eat before an 8:00pm show, or any time for that matter."

            "review": "Came here for dinner when it wasn't too busy, pretty decent food, but I feel it's pretty pricey for pizza.  \n\nWe got appetizers of the fried calamari and the pigs and truffles, i didn't really like the calamari, it was just too much batter and hardly any actual squid.  I did like the pigs and truffles- the spinach was delicious underneath and the sauce they use just brought everything together really well.  Don't be fooled though because it's actually quite small, at least for $24\n\nWe ordered the Gotham and the Forager.  I was definitely a huge fan of the forager, the cheese was cooked to perfection, deliciousness in every bite, i did wish that they had a bit more of the mushroom though.   Gotham is definitely for the meatlovers, it's pretty good too but a bit greasy compared to the Forager, but both definitely worth trying. \n\n\nI wouldn't suggest coming to this place EVERYTIME, but if you haven't been, i would say it's worth checking out. :)  Apparently they have a pretty good happy hour but I don't know the details for it since we went during dinner time."

What I will say is it made for a comical exchange between me and concierge to see if we could get a reservation:\n\n[Curtains part, our hero stands outside in sunny SoCal in front of a non-descript office building filled with boring ass people.]\n\n\"[Man answers phone] Hello, mlife concierge, how may I help you today?\"\n\"Hi, can I book a reservation at Five50?\"\n\"Certainly sir - which restaurant?\"\n\"Five50.\"\n\"Yes sir, but which dining establishment?\"\n\"Er, Five50?\"\n\"[A slight undertone of frustration is sensed in the man's voice] Yes sir, but which of our restaurants are you inquiring about?\"\n\"Five50! The new pizza joint you guys opened a few months ago.\"\n\"[Sincere apologetic tone] Ohhh, I'm so sorry sir - of course, I'll look into that for you right away.\"\n\n[Camera cuts to the man and our hero sitting opposite each other in front of a raging, elegant fireplace in matching burgundy leather armchairs, toasting glasses of finely aged scotch whiskey and laughing heartily as they reminsce about the good ol' days and that one time when the hero called to make a reservation. End scene.]\n\nSo I made that last part up but yeah, no reservation needed. ANYWHO.\n\nLayout of the restaurant is cool, and the divider from the casino floor is made out of wooden blocks stacked on the ends of one another so not to fret, you can still peek through and people watch, i.e. dudes can still oogle at girls dressed to the nines (I myself wouldn't partake in such an activity as a gentleman but good info for the rest of you dogs out there - you get a pass since it's LV after all) ;) Plenty of space so you're not elbowing the table next to you.\n\nMeatballs were really good and garnished with arugula and radish; tender and yummy. Calimari was okay...a little too much flour and fairly greasy. Real disappointment was the pizza; we got the Forager which had mushrooms, ricotta, brussel sprouts and something else but there was clearly a thick layer of oil on top of the cheese; don't think I've ever witnessed oil as a topping, even at fine pizza places such as Pizza Hut or Dominos. I mean, it was so bad the crust was almost translucent...that's just nasty and sloppy work imo. Speaking of the crust, it was baked too long so it was hard to bite into; maybe this place should consider a name change to Five00? I will say the pizza tasted excellent overall, a bit too cheesy and rich for me (lol @ diets), but the flavors were all present and intermingled well.\n\nService was good, though our server was an awkward little deer which was kinda cute and endearing - I'll chalk it up to Five50 being relatively new.\n\nI'm definitely down to give it another whirl, but please, do something about the oil - think of the children! Price is fair for what you're getting, and c'mon, you're balling it up at a pizza joint in Vegas. Watch out Cosmo Secret Pizza, there's a new player in town. And other than the slightly confusing name, it could give you a run for your money and potentially be a future jackpot spot for pizza lovers.\n\nEnded with so many gambling puns - what do I win?"

It wasn't overly greasy it was the average amount. It's suppose to have grease,  that's how a pizza is. \n\nIF you can hold out skip the app. But you'd be missing out. Ricotta cheese is very expensive out here. So I can see why it's $9.\n\nBlanca pizza came with fresh basil on top. Top notch high quality ingredients. Meats added are $4 each & veggies $2. Their mushrooms had so much flavor to them. Yum!"

Being that we are not sporting fans we were quickly annoyed but got over it and settled in at the bar (which was not crowded)  We ordered a couple of cheese slices, caesar salad, and the italian hero.  All were awesome, fresh, and decent in portion.  However, service was lack luster.  Originally my boyfriend ordered the meatball sandwich and out came the Italian sandwich instead.  We didn't care and we have both worked in the industry and understand these things happen but when the bartender looked at us like you have two heads and claims that we didn't order the meatball sandwich, I was a little put off.  Whatever, I was hungry and with that I ordered an additional cheese slice and again I got that look from our bartender like \"Really, you guys want ANOTHER slice, how could you?!\"  It was odd.  Also, our drinks were left empty after we finished our first glass and remained that way for the entire meal, we were never offered a refill (again we didn't mind and god forbid we ask for something else we would like to consume!).\nFood....awesome.\nDesign.....awesome.\nAcoustics......not so awesome.\nService......with an attitude.\n\nFour stars because because we didn't get many items from the menu (but we will be back to try more) and that lame bartender is very replaceable and so I won't judge the restaurant, it's menu, or it's concept on something that is as disposable as a inefficient employee."

It wasn't bad or anything but it def wasn't memorable. We ordered the Gotham pizza which comes with pepperoni, sausage and salami. It was a little too much for me. \n\nDuring the most recent Restaurant Week, I noticed they had a good lunch deal so my friend and I decided to give it another try. After we got there and saw what was including in the deal, it seemed like a better idea to just order what we wanted. It probably came out to the same price and it was good we wanted to eat.\n\nThe garlic knots were decent. Nothing to rave about. The pizza is cooked in a wood fired oven, at 550 degrees. :) This time we ordered cheese and pepperoni. It wasn't bad but like I said, its not my favorite or that memorable. The service wasn't great. It took a while for drink refills and they weren't even that busy. Overall, I think this place is expensive for the quality. Considering the location, I guess it would be less expensive than the other options though.\n\nTip: They sell pizza by the slice. This would be a good option if you're staying at the hotel or need something fast."

Directing me to take it up with the front desk while eye screwing my husband, instead of checking into the issue by calling the front desk, which the front desk at aria informed me was all she had to do.  My husband was disgusted that this girl with piercings and a 90's skater girl/punk look was hitting on him. Just a tip for their cashier staff, hitting on customers while you are a cashier at a pizza place is probably not going to work in your favor honey.

As Chef Shawn McClain's new spot, I had high expectations. I mean he did beat a Iron Chef right?\n\nWe ordered the gotham and truffle pizza off their signature menu; like most pizzerias you can build your own as well. The 16 inch pizzas were thin and crispy and easily fed the four of us.\nOverall the pizza was good but not really worth the $30 they charge. I guess its not too bad considering that one pie can feed two people but I expected more for the price. You can probably get the same pizza at Grimadlis. In the end you are really just paying for the name and surroundings.\n\nThey have a pretty good draft and bottled beer selection. The 50 cent beer happy hour they have from 5-5:50pm is a damn good deal if you are lucky to enough to find a seat. As the 3-star rating suggests, Five50 is a fine pizza joint but there are just so many more worthy places on the strip"

The gotham or the blanca is my favorite... it would be impossible for me to make a choice between the two.\n\nOverall, this place has a fun and casual feel but with an upscale elegance to it... it could easily be an appetizer & a quick drink type of place, or a slice to go.... but I would really recommend relaxing and having an interesting beer and a long night of fun tastes and fresh bold food.\n\nYou're going to want to go back the next day... I did."

Luckily my friend agreed and we had not gone to Aria yet during our trip, and Yelp directed us here.\n\nAdmist the casino and other dining options, located next door to the sports bar area, we were told it would be a 15 minute wait but then called immediately. Score!\n\nWe were seated and given drinks shortly after. We saw the table next to us of 3 young boys (10-12) given 3 large pizzas for the 3 of them! We were in shock as they annhilated all 3 pies! they all passed out right after, and it was fun free entertainment.\n\nMy friend and I shared their caeser salad, which was really good but glad we asked for the dressing on the side. If you're not a fan of anchovies, avoid this salad as it's really strong. They also provide a side of egg yolk for the dressing as well, but we didn't touch it.\n\nWe then asked if we could do a half and half pizza as I'm a white sauce fan, friend is not. The waitress warned us that it would turn pink in the middle and we were okay with that. When I ordered the forager (mushrooms, bacon, spinach) and my friend ordered the margherita, the waitress then told us the whole pink sauce again (within 30 seconds of telling us the first time) and again, we told her it was okay.\n\nPizza arrived not too long later, and can't go wrong with woodfired pizzas. Mine was slightly burnt around certain parts, but it was super tasty. Hit the spot. My friend's margherita was excellent as well. I couldn't even finish 2 of the 3 slices, so we took it to go and it was a great midnight snack. The pizza was around $26 which was not bad at all.\n\nThey also had a huge line for pizza slices to go (and table top seating) which is super smart for people who need a quick bite or craving after drinking."

            "review": "When you find yourself in the more upscale casinos in Vegas, you'll often find yourself pressed to find affordable food. Secret Pizza in The Cosmpolitan is always a fan favorite, but sometimes you just want to try something out. Enter Five50.\n\nI find the line in Secret Pizza always really intimidating when I'm just really hungry for a quick slice, and Five50, located in Aria, is a great alternative. Lines are never really long, and pizzas are just as great. What Secret Pizza lacks in variety, Five50 offers more unique flavors.\n\nStill, I would say the price has something left to be desired. $5.50 is a bit hefty for a slice of pizza, and although it is a large slice, I can't say I was all too happy parting with my cash. Nonetheless, still a very solid pizza place, and it definitely is worth checking out, if you're ever sick of Secret Pizza and looking for a change of pace.\n\nI would just raise one caveat though: beware of the soda prices. I was looking to grab a quick can of soda, and the price ended up being $10 for the combo of a slice and soda. Lo and behold, they charged $4.50 for a can of soda. Whereas I don't mind getting ripped off if offered in tap, it's nearly criminal to try to take that much from a can I can get from a grocery store. $2-$3? Sure. $4.50, please no.\n\nTIP: Get your sodas elsewhere."

The pizzas here are priced in the high 20s and it is a 16 inch pizza which will definitely fill up 2 people with 3 large slices each. Getting one slice is not an option unless you take it to go. Note there are a few standing tables right outside for this purpose so if you don't want a sit down dinner, do that instead! Place is very cute, host staff was okay, waiter was so great (thanks  Wissam -shaved hair with goatee) now to the food. Got one pizza to share half Forager and half Truffle. Got the Forager with Mortadella instead of bacon and it was the most delicious thing ever! So juicy and yummy and so many mushrooms and the mortadella gave it a fresh kick and I'm in love! The truffle was a bit of a disappointment it was kind of dry didn't have many truffles and barely had any sauce all cheese. Another big issue I had... there was way too much oil/grease on both the pizzas. I soaked out the grease with four napkins and my hands were still drenched. Would come back though and would recommend - especially for some late night drunchies!"

I even took my family to Naples's, Italy  this June to eat the best pizza in the world which by the way turned out to be the worst pizza we've ever had and the worst part of our trip. Anyway I've been staying at the Aria for several years now. So when they added a pizza place I was over joyed and hoping it would be good. The restaurant it self is very lively and well decorated. The wood fired ovens make a great back drop as you walk in. We were seated right away since it wasn't that busy yet. We ordered a Pepperoni pizza and Coke's. Yes Coke in Vegas again at a place that is dominated by Pepsi. That was one of our favorite things about this place. But the  pizza was seriously one of the best pizzas i had ever eaten. I only wish I hadn't eaten pizza the 3 days before so I could've went back again before we had to leave Vegas. Our waitress was also very good at her job. I can't wait to eat here again the next time I'm at the Aria. Like most of the places at the Aria it's not cheap but worth every cent. One large pizza easily fed my family of four. Believe me my kids can eat some food. Must visit if at the Aria."

I asked if this was Neapolitan Pizza and the guy seemed annoyed I was asking him a question. He said it was a hybrid between New York pizza and Neapolitan. I then asked him why the pizzas on the counter looked different than the one being made and he said because they are different pizzas. Obviously I knew the pizzas were different because of the different toppings, but I was basically getting at the pizzas have been out for too long that they look completely different from the one being freshly made. I then asked to speak with the manager to tell him about his employee who clearly was annoyed answering questions. He seemed to hear me but at the same time did not offer me a discount or anything to make up for the disappointing first impression. I should have left after this but I still ordered a slice of pizza. I ordered the spinach/ricotta/ mushroom pizza and it was just rich enough without being sickeningly rich. The crust had a sour flavor which is completely different from a New York pizza or Neapolitan. I appreciated them trying to be different but it was a little to sour for my taste. The crust was chewy, all the ingredients paired nicely together, and the sweetness of the ricotta helped balance out the sourness of the crust. I must say the pizza was pretty delicious, but the price is a little steep at almost $7 a slice."

Massive slices of delicious pizza at $5.50 a slice or you can order  lunch or dinner pizza/pasta/salads etc. Located in the Aria hotel on the casino level between the poker room and sports book it gets really busy so try and go at off times. The service is also fantastic as they go out of their way to accommodate any and all special requests. Although  the pasta and meatball entr\u00e9e is  incredibly enticing, in the end I personally love the five cheese pizza (it's a little greasy, but every great pizza has to have some grease). Clearly the high quality of all the ingredients coupled with the proper care in preparing their menu makes the difference. Turns out Five50 is operated by well know chef Shawn McClain (Sage restaurant among others), who I had the pleasure of meeting when he was actually working behind the bar in the restaurant one night. Nice guy, but more importantly- great pizza!

We went there on Sunday around noon to grab some lunch.\n\nTo start off, the girl at the register was extremely rude and seemed as though she just didn't want to be bothered.  We both got a couple of slices of the Mushroom Cheese pizza.  The girl pulled it out and didn't even bother to put it in the oven to warm it up so we assumed it must have been still hot already.  We also asked could we get it to go so that we could go back to our room and eat it and she just handed it to use on a couple of paper plates.  When I asked her could we get it in one of the boxes she looked annoyed and gave us one of the smaller boxes to stuff 4 giant pizza slices into.  Overall probably the worst customer experience I had at any of the restaurants in the Aria.\n\nNow as for the food.  I was again disappointed.  I know it's pizza so I don't expect some high-end gourmet meal but this stuff was just bad.  It was cold, soaked in grease/oil, and almost rubbery tasting.  It's extremely heavy so I do not at all recommend this place if you care about your health.  This might rank among the worst pizza I've ever had and I've had a lot.  \n\nOverall I would highly recommend you stay away from this place. At least when it comes to the pizza they serve upfront.  Even the low end looking pizza restaurant across the street next to the Walgreens tasted better and that was surprising considering that Five 50 is inside the Aria with all those other quality restaurants.  A combination of bad service and bad food is never a good thing.  Not recommended."

He seemed like a nice guy but came off sounding very condescending at times. I really don't appreciate servers who stereotype their tables based on their age and attire. All we ordered were a round of water and didn't get any refills after our initial glasses! \n\nTo be honest, most of the staff was pretty soft spoken as well. I'm not sure if it was because of the intimate/luxury feel they were trying to give but all of the team members in the restaurant were very quiet and quite honestly not very helpful either.\n\nAnyways, we ended up ordering the Gotham and Truffle pizza which were large 16\" pies. Both of which our server had recommended as being popular choices among guests. \n\nThe Gotham was basically a meat lovers wet dream, it was topped with pepperoni, salami, sausage, and a handful of other ingredients. Overall it wasn't bad, but tbh I can't say I fell in love with it either.\n\nThe Truffle pizza was a major disappointment. Beware when you order it, it was very oily and certainly takes a refined pallet to enjoy.\n\nOverall, we were not very impressed by what this place had to offer. Five 50 seemed like a knockoff more expensive dining version of Secret Pizza at The Cosmopolitan and the service was not worth what we paid. It was certainly a 1 time experience.\n\nThe breakdown: (for the price)\n\nService: 2/5\nFood Quality: 3/5\nAtmosphere: 4/5\n\nAll 4 of us shared 2 large pizzas and it cost us $66. \n\nTip* You'll get more bang for your buck by going to secret pizza at The Cosmopolitan."

Excellent d\u00e9cor throughout from their tables, seating up to the lighting overhead. \n\nTheir selection of beer is outstanding, peruse for a while before making your selection or ask for a sample. We were here for an early dinner and ended up splitting the Caesar salad and their Truffle pizza. I can taste the truffle now...mmmmm. Handmade dough and crispy crust, fresh ingredients and don't skimp on the truffle. The servers were very friendly and casual. They have a few TVs throughout the place so you can catch a game if needed, but there is also a Sportsbook right next door.\n\nThey have about eight pre-made pizza selections but you can also create your own as needed. Lunch menu also included a couple sandwiches and pastas.\n\nI definitely recommend for a casual but quality meal. They also have a to-go counter."

Midwesterners beware, this is a thin crust pizza joint!\n\nWe were pressed for time and had a 30 to 40 minute window for eating. The service was accommodating, and they got us in and out just in time. We ordered one pizza, half North Beach half Margherita. The slices were large and thin, so one pizza was enough to make two people full at three slices per person. The pizza was thin crust, but still had a slight chew to go with the crunch which I enjoyed. The North Beach had smoked mozzarella and clams on it, and was described as bbq chicken pizza with the chicken swapped for clams. It was unique with tender clam pieces, but I think they planted a dangerous seed since I found myself wishing it had a dash of bbq sauce! The Margherita pizza was nothing special, just a big basil leaf on each slice."

Nothing should ever close!\n\nWe perused the menu and didn't think it was worth sitting down in the restaurant when it was just the two of us so stood in the line for pizza by the slice.  We got one slice of all the pizzas available...so there was barely any pizza left after we finished.  We came during the rush so you would think they would be preparing more pizzas.  \n\nWe noticed that the person who ordered before us had their pizza warmed up.  This was never offered to us.  The pizza slices aren't too expensive but for how greasy and bland the pizza is, I wouldn't have even paid the $6/slice and would have just starved until the morning and eaten at a buffet.\n\nThe white pizza was gross (cold, hard/flavorless cheese).  The slice with sausage and pizza was greasy.  The margherita pizza was completely forgettable.  Eating here just made me angry thinking about the other pizza option across the way...Accept no imitations.  There's only one true great pizza in Vegas.  And this place isn't it."

Do yourself a favor and get the truffle pizza without the potatoes, and have them add on some of their jalapenos. They get the jalapenos fresh and pickle them. They complement the richness of the pizza quite well. Don't forget to start with their chicken wings accompanied by their homemade bleu cheese dressing. Also, the Five50 chopped salad is a must. Its like antipasti meets salad in a bowl and throws a party. It has so many textures and flavors, and the vinaigrette on the salad keeps you salivating for more. Do yourself another favor and wash it down with a pint or two of their seasonal Citradelic Tangerine IPA made by New Belgium that they have on draft.It is quite evident with even just a small sampling of their food that this is a chef driven restaurant with solid grub and a beer selection to top it off."

There were only about 3 different pizzas in their display window for reheating. We were going to create our own, but paying over $28 for a whole pizza didn't seem like it'd be worth it to me.\n\nWe ended up getting a slice of the Gotham which was huge and NY style, but way way too greasy!! They were generous w/ the toppings though, lots of pepperoni and sausages. Cheese was gooey which I loved. Unfortunately due to the amount of grease, the crust wasn't crunchy at all, but rather soggy. For about $5.50/slice I expected it to taste better.\n\nI probably would come back to try their other slices or milkshakes. The milkshakes seemed worth it for the price!"

It didn't help that we stayed at the Vdara and Five50 is located within Aria; but regardless, it was three damn times.\n\nIf you have been to Five50, you might can understand why. If you have not, let me explain. For one, there's a pizza entree called Gotham (comes with pepperoni, sausage, salami, mozzarella, and grana padano) which is a must. Second, there's a pizza entree called Margherita (tomato, buffalo mozzarella, and basil) which is also a must. Out of the two pizzas that I just mentioned, Gotham is a must-must. It was so bad that when we came to Five50 for the third time, the waiter who we had previously looked at us and said, \"You're getting Gotham today, right?\" \n\n\"You damn right.\"\n\nOther than that, the atmosphere is laid back."

The walk is a little long getting in there, but the food made-up for the long walk.\n\nNow to the food, I was impressed with this upscale pizza place! It had a fun vibe, and the decor was very nice. I tried the polenta with egg! YUMZ!\n\nFor a salad we shared a beet, peach, frisee and hazelnut composition. Beets and peaches! Can't go wrong!\n\nMy favorite was a bread with cheese and garlic sauce! I ate like 3 pieces! Carb overload right? \n\nThe pizza was amazing, I believe it was the Gotham. Pepporoni and sausage. I absolutely loved the crust. It was chewy and crunchy at the same time, and you can just tell there's something different in the water they use. It couldn't have been Vegas water. We don't have crust that good with the water from the faucets in town. Idk what the secret is, but I loved it.\n\nFor dessert we shared an ice cream sandwich and chocolate custard w lavender. The custard was yumz! Got thicker the further down you went:)  Not too impressed w the sandwich. \n\nThe place is friendly and casual, still with a nice ambience. It was child friendly as well.

Crisp on the bottom, yet still chewy, plenty of those great dough bubbles (you know what I'm talking about!), and really flavorful.  The sauce was delicious, not too spicy, not too sweet.  And the cheese was also perfectly flavorful, not super stringy like you get on a gimmicky cheap pizza, and not totally greasy like...well, like on Secret Pizza, a total grease bomb if you ask me.\n\nWe had salads, too, and my beet salad was great.  Something special, if you want to splurge (which we did).  \n\nThe atmosphere was pleasant, no blasting music like you get in some Vegas restaurants now, and there were games going over the bar so it felt comfortable and casual.  The service, in our case, was prompt and pleasant.\n\nSo, yeah, all around, an emphatic five stars for a pizza place.  And I can't wait to go back."

Took over 30 min to get pizza.  We ordered the Gotham.  Crust is very soggy and not even browned on the bottom, despite the edges being burned. Pizza had little flavor and sauce tasted like a spaghetti sauce.  Waters were empty most of the meal. Had to ask for parm and peppers."

I thought Sage was terribly overrated, but I had high hopes for Five50. \n\nWe started out with a couple apps, sampled four different pies (which we we able to do halves on) and finished with a few desserts.\n\nSmall Plates:\n\nPepperoni Arancini- Rice Balls, Red Sauce and Roasted Garlic Aioli. $12. Three small arancinis, they were pretty good.\n\nPigs and Truffles- Pork Shoulder Cannelloni, Bordeaux Spinach, Bechamel and Summer Truffles. $18.  I'm a sucker for bechamel. That intrigued me more than the truffles. This was pretty outstanding.\n\nSignature Pizzas are 16\". \n\nNorth Beach- Clams, Smoked Mozzarella, Sweet Onions, Oregano. By far one of the weirdest tasting pizzas I've ever had. I think what threw me off the most was the sauce. I'm used to a clam pizza with a white sauce. The red sauce did not pair well, even worse was the smoked mozzarella. I felt like I was eating BBQ. It was terrible.\n\nBlanca- Mozzarella, Ricotta, Bel Paese, White Chedder, Olive Oil, Garlic, Basil. This was decent, the ricotta was the best part. \n\nTruffle- Truffle Salami, Bechamel, Parmesan, Thyme, Shaved Truffles. Would you like a side of oil to go with that? Wow, only thing I saw on this pizza was oil. Someone call  the nearest Cath Lab and book a room for me? I couldn't finish my slice, it was terribly overwhelming. \n\nMargherita- Tomato, Buffalo Mozzarella and Basil. This was pretty standard. Nothing to write home about. \n\nAt $28 a pizza, you walk away thinking, \"did that really just happen?\" \n\nDesserts:\n\nWarm Apple Pie & French Toast Cubes. Both made up for the horendous pizza. \nSkip this place."

The chorizo was tasty and obviously a nice quality meat. The Mozzarella was my favorite of the cheeses, but the Burrata was nice and creamy. My only suggestion might be more bread to go with all of the cheese and accompaniments. \n\nThe Gotham Pizza was delicious. The crust had a nice crisp and the crust was just thick enough to hold the meaty toppings. The cheese on the pizza had a nice flavor.

The reviews have been mixed at best and since there are now some pretty legit spots for pizza in LV, I wasn't exactly rushing to try any of this at strip prices.  \n\nThe only thing that was pretty consistent with all the reviews was how good the crust was.  If that's the star of the whole damn pie, I figured I would just be screwing it up by adding things like truffle, clams, rosemary or broccoli rabe.  We went with their margherita (tomato, buffalo mozzarella and basil) with extra cheese.  I definitely wasn't getting good value since all the other pizzas with toppings were only $1-$5 more but we did have 8 beers for 50 cents each so that justified my whole deal.  \n\nThe sauce was sweeter than usual which surprised me upon first bite but it worked.  Cheese was cheese and basil was basil and that was all just a vehicle for the crust.  The crust was really good.

It was a bit too spicy for me, but it was really good too; I had to unwillingly hand over the other half of my slice to my friend. $28 + tip and tax for the full pizza isn't bad since the pizza feeds 4 people. Don't forget to grab a spiked shake! I ordered the Las Vegas Root Beer Float (vanilla ice cream, caramel Butterfinger crumbles, Boylan's root beer) -- it's kinda pricey at $9 + $6 for the Jagermeister, but hey, it's Vegas. I enjoyed my boozy lunch :) \n\nThis past trip, my friends and I just wanted a snack, so we took a look at the to-go display case. There are fewer options to choose from when you're getting a slice to-go, but oh well. Since it was the week of Thanksgiving, they had a turkey confit pizza! It was quite an interesting pizza -- turkey and cranberries with a white sauce. \n\nProps to the executive chef, Shawn Mcclain. Oh yeah, the bonus?

I think the dough was a bit too dense/over-kneaded. The sauce was fine and the cheese was decent without being great. I enjoyed my time here and would give it a 3.5 if I could. I would say this is not a bad place to check out but there are so many other options and $26 for a margherita pizza is a bit on the silly side in terms of price (silly being a code word for ridiculous)- even in comparison to other Vega$ places."

Our server, who was pleasant enough but whose name escapes me, took our orders quickly and brought our drinks right away.\n\nWe ordered the Gotham pizza to share, which was, as we Italians say, \"mezza-mezza\". It tasted great, fresh meat toppings and perfectly cheesed, but the crust was not consistent in thickness. Some slices were evenly thin-crusted from the center to the edges, and some were thick at the edges (the way I'm used to being from NY) but so paper thin at the middle that the toppings and oil soaked through and it all fell apart.\n\nI'm by no means cheap, and I certainly understand \"strip pricing\" in Vegas, especially since I work in the same hotel that this place resides, but the pizza carried a $28 price tag for 6 slices, plus $4.50 each for a 6\" tall x 2\" diameter glass of iced tea that was almost  1/2 full of crushed ice, and I can't help but feel that I could have put that $40 to better use elsewhere for lunch. Also a disappointment (which won't apply to most people but I'll mention it anyway) was the fact that they don't honor any sort of employee discount, making this the first place I've personally been to in the MGM lineup that has stiffed me on my employee ID. Boo for that. All things considered I'd give the experience a 6/10, and I think this will likely be my last time there."

After eating here, I kind of wish I was either drunk at the time or craving a quick bite or maybe buzzed or about to pass out from too much fun because the pizza was just not that good.\n\nFirst off, the appetizer options on their lunch menu is almost non-existent. I saw maybe some garlic bread and salads and meat and cheeses but not even calamari or something interesting? Kind of a big deal, especially since these pizzas take a while to make. We ordered two pizzas, one with red sauce and one with white sauce. The cool thing is that they let you mix two different kinds of pizzas into one if they have the same sauce so we did just that. Half of one pizza had clams and the other was more of a meat pizza. The other one we tried was a white truffle pizza that had truffle salami and truffle shavings sprinkled throughout. Oh my....everything was so salty!! Not to mention that we couldn't eat half the crusts because they were burnt from the wood fire ovens. The portions were bigger than expected but since we don't like wasting food, it just made us eat more of these salt monsters. \n\nWhen this place opened months ago in its infancy, the reviews were not very good at all. I was bummed until I saw that the reviews recently have been much more well received so I thought it was a soft opening type thing. NOPE!!! It's ok - I very rarely eat pizza in Vegas anyways but if someone were to ask me, I would say go to the Cosmo secret pizza place instead.\n\n\nglass half full --- grab a slice that's already prepared with a beer and head over to the sportsbook right next door"

Wonderful ingredients however poor execution, not impressed at all. Will stick to Settebello at least the pizza is seasoned and good!! The bread sticks are a palate killer and ruin your taste buds loaded with grease and spice. Little over priced in my opinion after 2 glasses of wine, beet salad, cheese and charcuterie $100 plus tip, the food and the service were both bland. Step it up we expect more out of a James Beard Chef, especially because Sage is incredible."

One time we went and ordered margaritas, they went back 3 times for being undrinkable.  If they would amp up the cocktails then i'd go back to 5 stars."

            "review": "I was really excited when I heard there was going to be a new pizza restaurant opening up in Aria.  So I dropped in to check out this new pizza joint at Aria called Five50 with a friend after work. It is the second restaurant opened by Chef Shawn McClain (Sage) at Aria, so the expectation of excellent food was high.\n\nThe Five50 name seems strange, but according to them is the ideal temperature for cooking your pizza in the oven (so is that Fahrenheit or Celsius?). And until just last week, 5:50pm was the start of their Happy Hour and the promotion was 50 cents beer.  Now HH is from 5PM to 5:50pm (is it still considered a happy HOUR if it only lasts 50 minutes).  $5.50 might also be the starting price of their pizza by the slice (don't hold to it in case I am mistaken, but it would fit the pattern of this gimmicky name). \n\nThe restaurant is beautifully designed.  It looks great from the outside, although the \"VIP\" area near the back and by that \"wall\" is just too cramp to be fully functional.\n\nService was friendly and efficient. Since the restaurant is still new, it also appears that they have way more staff on duty than are needed.  Will be interesting to see if the staffing level will remain at current level in 2-3 months.  \n\nAfter looking over the menu, which is mostly a beverage menu (the entire outside cover of the menu is the wine, beer, etc menu), while the inside menu consist of Snacks (5 items), Small Plates (your upscale appetizers), Salads, Pastas, Meat & Cheese, and the 8 pizza selections or you can customize your own.\n\nTried the Forager Pizza (Mushrooms, Spinach, Rosemary, Whipped Ricotta) and it was good. The pizza crust was the star, while the toppings were quality it was also  not exactly generous.  If I was hungry and didn't have a late lunch, I can totally finish this 16\" pizza myself and not break a AYCE sushi coma sweat.  So it was not even a challenge to split it with another person.\n\nIf I come back I will want to try their Gotham and Truffle pizzas.  Their Small  Plates and Pasta items sound interesting too, which may actually be the more exciting offerings from Chef Shawn McClain's new pizza joint/craft beer sports bar.\n\nFood:  3.5/5  Quality ingredients used on tasty flat bread pizza, part of the overall tasty crunchy crust was sadly burnt.\n\nCreativity:  2.5/5  Nothing that I have not already seen done somewhere else.  Considering the talent of a chef that bested an American Iron Chef, I know this place has way more to offer in this department. \n\nPrice/Value:  3/5  Casino pricing for the convenience of not having to walk or take a cab somewhere else.  If you want better value for your dining dollars, get a panini sandwich from Jean Philippe Patisserie (in Aria and Bellagio).\n\nService: 3/5  Never had bad experience from any of the wait staff at Aria, but waitstaff could be better trained on what is offered on the menu.  Are breadsticks complimentary? If so, we didn't get any while we waited for the pizza.\n\nDecor:  3.5/5  Hip, upscale decor with dim lighting that fits the overall darker color scheme of Aria (not my style preference, but I just like the brighter more energetic look of other interior decorator's executed vision more).\n\nA-OK and perfect for guests in Aria and CityCenter complex.\n\n(Needs better HH)"

So much that my husband and I couldn't wait to buy a whole pizza to take home the next day. We got the Gotham pizza. I can't say anything about the other kinds because we didn't try those. The meat was very tasty on the pizza and the crust was really nice. I'm glad I don't live in Vegas because I would be going to this place every week.

Went for the Gotham, which is sorta like a meat-lovers with a spicy kick, and the North Beach, which is a pizza with clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, and oregano.  \n\nGotham's tasty, just as expected, especially if you're a fan of pepperoni and/or salami.  The North Beach was sort of a gamble since we wanted to try something different and man, we lost.  We expected a pizza with clams sprinkled onto the pizza, but what you get is actually one clam in the shell per slice.  Yup, 8 slices, 8 clams.  After you eat the one clam, it's just a cheese pizza essentially.  The smoked mozz and sweet onions was very tasty though.\n\nWe also ordered an order of wings after the girl on the phone said it was very delicious, and she was right, it was very tasty!  Not really a buffalo sauce, but it does have a slight kick and sweetness to it.  We were quite glad we were convinced to order it haha.\n\nNow, for the price, each pizza is close to $30 (why we also thought there would be more clams), and for some reason the wings aren't on the online menu when we ordered so we didn't know, but our bill was $90+ with two cokes after taxes.  We knew Vegas was expensive but man, $90+ for pizza and wings was sorta crazy.  \n\nThey sell by the slice as well, but I think I'd rather walk a little more to Cosmo and eat Secret Pizza next time."

Upon further inspection, we determined that the menu looked pretty good, and that it looked like Neapolitan style pizza cooked in a pizza oven- our favourite!\n\nWe didn't make a reservation, and ended up waiting about 20 minutes before being seated.  Funny, because when we were seated, we found that probably 30% of the restaurant's tables were empty.  Maybe they were understaffed on this particular Saturday night?\n\nThe server we did have was extremely slow at everything from taking our order to bringing out our drinks and refilling our water, and then finally taking forever to bring our bill.\n\nThere were four of us, and we each had ceaser salads, and determined that we'd share the truffle and margherita pizzas.  The salads were great, no complaints there, as was the margherita pizza.  The truffle pizza was completely overwhelming, and I think it has put me off truffles for a little while!  Too much truffle!!\n\nUltimately, looking back on how much time we spent debating over which pizzas to choose, I think some of the choices were a little too \"out there\" and there seemed to be something on each one of them that one of our group couldn't handle.\n\nDefinitely wouldn't return to Five50, considering all of the other choices for food in Vegas.  To get more stars in Vegas I have to leave feeling not only satisfied, but like I'd return for another meal."

Toppings were good throughout the first slice but rapidly got dull - lower quality ingredients? Over done? Perhaps just masked by too much mediocre cheese? But perhaps that's too critical. Overall, Five 50 was a great pizza experience with a winking waiter with shmarmy Vegas charm."

Good portion size / price ratio.\n\nPigs & Truffles ($18): Pork Shoulder Cannelloni, Bordeaux Spinach, Bechamel & Summer Truffles. This was delicious but felt a bit spendy. It had a wonderful truffle essence from the fragrant smell to the taste!  I probably wouldn't order this again though.\n\nWe got two pizzas...both SPLIT into halves.  So we were able to try a total of FOUR different pizzas :\n\nTruffle Pizza ($29): Truffle Salami, Bechamel, Parmesan, Thyme & Shaved Truffles. Blanca ($27): Mozzarella, Ricotta, Bel Paese, White Cheddar, Olice Oil, Garlic & Basil. Both were excellent, but the Truffle Salami with shaved Truffles was outstanding! Loved the flavor explosions here!! Highly recommended!\n\nMargherita ($24): Tomato, Buffalo Mozzarella & Basil. North Beach ($28): Clams, Smoked Mozzarella, Sweet Onions & Oregano. The Margherita was good, bit sweet with a nice mozzarella flavor. The North Beach was surprisingly smokey in a red sauce, which was an odd combination in my eyes...I would have much preferred a white sauce for the clams.  I can't really recommend either of these.\n\nAnd to finish, we tried the Warm Apple Pie ($9?): White Cheddar, Oatmeal Streusel & Smoke Salted Mascarpone Ice Cream. Good variation of the classic. \n\nCrispy Sourdough Fritters ($9?): Winter Spiced Cranberry Sauce & Orange Glaze. These were great, but the cranberry sauce was perfect! Just the right amount of tanginess to compliment the fried sourdough.  Recommended :)\n\nWill I be back?  Yes, but not anytime soon I don't believe..."

Two of us went for lunch, and sat down, ordered some drinks, and looked at the menu.  The hostess was nice and friendly, and offered some thoughts on food.  Then our server came.  I believe she smiled 1.5 times in our hour sitting.  A .5 when we sat down (it looked more like a grimace) and a HUGE smile when she brought our check and said I hope you enjoyed your meal (in other words, when tipping time came).  The rest of the time she was angry, or perhaps heartbroken, or suicidal, or I do not know what.  I understand bad days happen.  Everyone has them.  They are rough.  But don't look at your customers like you are annoyed you have them, or angry that they came in.  Especially when one is the nicest lady ever and friendly and cheerful and you just keep scowling at her.  It looks bad.  \n\nThe pizza was enjoyable (a bit greasy, but hey, it is pizza).  The salad we split (which, regardless of what they say, is not that small a salad) was fresh tasting, and I enjoyed it very much.  The environment is nice, and it is an easy to find location.  Hopefully the service picks up."

Certainly, this isn't delivery pizza, and is a just a notch above a CPK. The crust is fluffy and yet at the same time crisp, and the toppings are clearly of a high quality.\n\nWe tried the Blanca with spicy italian sausage and the Truffle as well. We enjoyed both of them thoroughly. \n\nCertainly, you are paying a premium here. 22 (cheese) to 29 (truffle) for a (non gigantic) pizza is at best considered \"casino\" pricing, and at worst, just flat out a rip-off. I don't think I could even justify coming here to spend 5.50 on a slice, as the slices aren't really \"meal\" sized like some places.\n\nWe also had the pork belly appetizer, which, when digested with all the ingredients in a single bite, was just absolutely incredibly. Still, it would be 15 dollars had we been paying ourselves.\n\nIn the end, it wasn't a bad experience at all - in fact, service was really good and we came away very happy. However, the bill without consideration of comps would have been 100 dollars before tip (3 beers too). That's a lot for a pizza meal! It was good, but not THAT good..."

It's located right by the Aria sports book near the Zarkana entrance.\n\nThe Aria signed an exclusive joint venture with the James Beard Award-Winning Chef and Restaurateur Shawn McClain. To have his name behind it, you know this place will receive top notch quality control and ingredients.\n\nThis place makes me love the Aria poker room even more now. (I'm going to gain so much weight from these pizzas everyday LOL)\n\nI believe pizza by the slice goes for $5.50, and apparently they set oven temperatures to 550 Fahrenheit, and at 5:50 pm happy hour starts! (Hence the name Five 50) Pretty catchy I say. Oh and thanks for this information Nelson Q. :p\n\nI tried three 16 inch pizzas with friends. All priced around $27-29. They were the:\n\nTRUFFLE: potato, truffle salami, b\u00e9chamel, fresh thyme, truffles\n\nBLANCO: fresh mozzarella, ricotta, olive oil, chopped garlic, basil, and white cheddar\n\nFARMSTEAD: country ham, cr\u00e8me fraiche, farm egg, olives\n\nI would say the crowd favorite out of those three was the Truffle, definitely a unique pizza! The Blanco was very good as well, and the Farmstead wasn't our favorite. Just the over easy farm eggs on top where the egg yolk starts dripping everywhere wasn't the best texture and consistency to have on a pizza.\n\nThis place is a great upscale pizza joint and I would highly recommend a visit here if you absolutely love pizza and stopping by the Aria! The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is honestly because I've had better pizzas elsewhere in my lifetime. :p"

And too much so. Maybe as an Italian I am just too picky about my pizza, but I like crust that you can fold in half, New York style. This crust was just hard and really distracted from what was otherwise an amazing slice of pizza.\n\nFix the crust and you have guaranteed 5-star pizza.\n\nService was also good and the pricing was good for being in a 5-star Vegas resort.

The Meatballs were small and ridiculously overpriced for only getting three tiny ones and a few tiny plain crostini pieces that desperately needed a drizzle of olive oil.  Tiny portions at high prices were also seen with the admittedly yummy garlic cheese bread that was basically four half slices of an Italian loaf.  It did have a lot of cheese on it, and was great when dipped in marinara.\n\nRefills were provided when needed.  My mint chip shake was garnished with mint chocolate cookies (looked like thin mints) and was very tasty.\n\nService was pretty shaky.

Not a big deal - we planned quite enough time before the show and weren't in a rush.\n\nWe shared everything:\n\nGarlic Knots ($6): Great portion and huge knots. Really tasty.\n\nBeer Mac 'n Cheese ($12 - half order): Again, good portion size and really good - the prosciutto is a nice touch.\n\nChef's Selection Charcuterie (6 for $28): I know it seems pricey, but man was it worth it! They were not stingy with the meat/cheese and we actually got to choose the 6 we wanted. We went with both Burrata and Buffalo Mozzarella, as well as the Humbodlt Fog. For meats we had Mortadella, Soppressata and Prosciutto. Everything was really fresh and SO SO good. i would definitely order this again and it was perfect for sharing.\n\nFinally we got the Gotham pizza ($28): Also pricey, but we both really enjoyed it. It had pepperoni, salami and sausage. \n\nWe ended up with way too much food and were stuffed. They also have good drink specials - I thought the prices for the beer/shot combos were really good and they have a great selection of beers.\n\nThe 2nd time I dined there, I just grabbed a quick slice from the slice counter. The great thing is that the counter is open until 3 AM on Fri/Sat. It was just $5.95 for a HUGE slice of pizza and it was really good. This time I got the \"Forager,\" which has whitesauce, mushrooms, bacon, whipped ricotta and spinach. I've been dreaming about this slice ever since.\n\nOverall, it fits a certain \"niche,\" it's connected to the Race & Sports Book and can be considered a fast casual experience. Or you can grab a slice on your way back to your room - both are great options. I'll definitely be back soon!"

It's just swanky enough to feel like you're getting your money's worth but not so much that you forget that it's still a sports bar with a casual ambiance. They serve Fiji water, which was nice, albeit expensive. All-in-all, with two bottles of Fiji and our pizza, we spent about $45.

It was an easy, comfortable spot for dinner as well as for drinks and dessert after some time on the casino floor. The only problem with Five50 Pizza Bar was that the pizza was no good.\n\nWe came for an early Sunday dinner after driving in from LA with no particular plans. We were thinking about leaving the Aria, which is where we were staying, but inertia got the best of us when we stumbled across a pizza place right by the sports betting station. It was only 5:30, but we were hungry after our time on the road, and the restaurant was beautifully empty.\n\nI liked the vibe of the place. Very much of one piece with the Aria, ritzy and modern with high ceilings and interesting decor, but casual and fuss-free. There was a large bar that ended up being half the point of the place, and service was solid. We ended up coming back with a couple more friends when we needed a place to catch up later in the night. We brought our leftover pizza for them to eat, and our server didn't call us out for having the take-out box on the table.\n\nThat pizza, though, was some of the worst I've had in a while--no contest when measured against others in its price range. These were expensive personal pies, and they just didn't taste good. They were flawed on a basic level, limp and greasy with way too much cheese. The toppings were good, at least. The Catania came with white sauce, garlic pur\u00e9e, Italian sausage, rapini, and roasted tomato; the Forager with white sauce, mushrooms, bacon, whipped ricotta, and spinach. Pretty good ideas, but not enough to redeem the pizzas.\n\nWeirdly, everything else was great. The beet salad was excellent, a colorful mix of local beets with watercress, farro, pumpkinseed vinaigrette, and grissini. One of my friends doesn't like burrata, so we got it with goat cheese--accommodating kitchen, and a nice substitution. When we came back after dinner, I had some kind of craft beer on tap (I forget which, but it was a good one), and partook in a couple of decadent milkshakes. The Vegas root beer float was a satisfying shake loaded with vanilla ice cream, caramel, Butterfinger crumbles, and Boylan's root beer. The mint chocolate swirl mixed mint ice cream with chocolate syrup and chocolate mint cookies--what's not to like there? All shakes were available in adult iterations, but the beer was good enough for me.\n\nI enjoyed Five50 Pizza Bar despite its failure to deliver good pizza. I'd recommend it for an easy drink or meal if you're hanging out at the Aria. I wouldn't hesitate to go back; I just might avoid the signature offerings."

We opted for just a slice each from the counter (options there are more limited than if you were to sit down and order a whole pie). The pizza smelled delicious and I was hungrily waiting for it to come out of the reheating oven.  I ordered the Gotham which consist of mozzarella cheese, grana padano and meats (sausage, salami and of course, pepperoni). The slice is pretty decent sized and thin in height but there was more than enough toppings for it. Unfortunately, it was sooo oily, too oily. I folded my slice to take a bite and quickly, drops of meat oil dripped down. I get it, it's the toppings fault for all that oiliness but that didn't make me want to get another one of those slices. I would maybe go back but for a different kind of slice.. like the truffle potato one or the forager. Fast, easy and affordable late night pizza is always a o k in my book."

            "review": "Certainly cannot agree with the 4+5 star reviews ot this place, since it may be the most expensive pizza restaurant in Las Vegas. We ordered the Gotham Pizza, which is \"supposed\" to include pepperone, sausage & salami, but there was ZERO salami, & only a smattering of sausage. Perhaps a dozen circles of pepperoni. Lots of cheese if that pleases you? For $28 I think customers should expect something \"better\". Onions? Peppers? Olives? Mushrooms?  However, anything above the minimal serving of meat, would push the price well above $30, since each ingredient adds another $2. For those who want to spend $30-40++ on a 16\" pizza, I wish them well. For us -- we go to Wolfgang Puck's in the Crystal Shopping Mall attached to ARIA, & get a better pizza for 1/2 the price."

They char them just enough in the ovens to give it a little flavor and character.  Toppings aren't skimpy and the salads and soups are good complimentary parts of the meal.  Solid craft beer line-ups on draft including local craft breweries and some out of state.  Their bottle craft beers are solid as well. \nNice ambiance, well lit, and upbeat.  Service during the day was a little slow but I can look the other way one since the meal was good."

Featuring a slice counter plus a handful of primi, pasta, salads, and desserts alongside 16\" pizzas cooked in a 550 degree oven the \"style\" of McClain's signature pies falls somewhere between traditional New York slices and a Roman lightly-leavened 'crunchy' crust but with ingredient quality meeting the standards set by Sage the results were largely impressive save for the excessive use of oil and salt marring the Truffle and an unannounced red sauce lending a peculiar barbecue note to the North Beach.  Faring better, a simple Margherita assuredly displayed the restaurant's sourcing with tangy tomatoes and fresh basil while the Blanca shined largely to a thick dollop of house-made ricotta on each slice.  Moving past pizza, a sampling of the cannelloni proved to be my favorite savory of the day, albeit slightly overpriced at $18 for two pasta tubes stuffed with tender pork and topped with creamy Bechamel plus meager truffle shavings while a trio of arancini presented a unique riff on a classic by substituting house cured pepperoni for traditional sausage and pairing it with thick, aromatic aioli.  Never happy to leave a restaurant without dessert, a final pairing arrived at the table in the form of a small apple pie with accoutrements both sweet and savory alongside fried brioche cubes paired with sour cranberry sauce; both sweets trumping any of the savories and a saving grace at the end of a meal that fell short of high expectations."

It took me twenty minutes at the machine. Three cars ahead of me. I should've known, piling on took ten minutes. Luckily the attendant was on hand and she was helpful. Bonus, she remembered assisting me when I came in. The bar wouldn't go up and she even had issues with it releasing up so I could proceed into the garage. Yes, my plate was correctly on the parking meter ticket. Leaving it told me invalid ticket. That was after waiting twenty minutes on the line so I could leave. \nNow, onto lunch (once I finally left the parking garage situation).\nMet some friends yesterday afternoon who were staying at Aria. It was about 12:30 on a Tuesday- not at all busy. Our waitress was far from that. My friend's husband inquired about the soup, and she spoke AT him and then as if he had no idea about soup or food. If personalities were sold, I would purchase one for her. She never returned inquiring if we needed anything additional. When she brought our drinks she basically threw them down. We thought about dessert, espresso what have you. Then we thought about our waitress. Thought it was better in just leaving sooner than later. The pizza wasn't fully cooked, underneath was more on the raw dough end and no brown on the bottom.  It had a nice taste, mushrooms and sausage. Who can honestly not have made a pizza correctly. They did- not cooking it fully."

That's why I recommend that you go with half the cheese. It still tastes great but it preserves the crust. The crust, by the way, is very good. \n\nThe five50 chopped salad was OK. Nothing to write home about. \n\nThe desserts were disappointing. The ice cream sandwiches had potential but the ice cream simply has too much air stirred into it. It's not premium ice cream. A few other desserts were simply not noteworthy. I'd really avoid the desserts. Make your way over to the Aria and grab dessert from Jean Philippe Patisserie. Cannot lose there. \n\nStill, the name of the game here is pizza. And Five50 does pizza well. Keep it simple and you'll be pleased with a five-star pizza."

We arrived at 11am and went to the hostess stand for the restaurant and told her we were there for the My Vegas deal.  She said the restaurant was not open and to go to the walk up place.  We did.  The person there acted confused and started to say they weren't open, but of course, there were pizzas sitting there, so that made no sense.  She told us that the place where they get the beer is under construction so she had to go get the beers from the bar in the restaurant (like 20 feet away).  We're like, \"OK\".  Then she says you can have Bud LIght or 3-2-1.  So what we weren't sure about because she was not very clear and it was really loud in there from the overhead music was if we could only have Bud LIght or 3-2-1 because the regular beer thing was closed or if that is all you get on this deal.  Either way that sucked.  If you're using an offer like this to advertise your business, giving me shitty beer is a sure way to not impress me enough to come back.\n\nNext, to the pizza.  There were four options.  I chose the mushroom and spinach with a white sauce and the husband had the many meats selection.  They stick the pieces into the over to heat them for a couple of minutes.  Then since we were told the restaurant was closed, we took our food to the sports book to eat at a table there.  The pizza was fine.  It's that thin crust type which is not my favorite.  The ingredients seemed good, but between the crap beer and the ok pizza and weird service, I have no desire to return.  Then we were checking out the restaurant hours and it said they opened at 11am... sooooo,  Okay then.  Whatever.\n\nFlakey and meh food and drink in one of my least favorite casinos.

The only problem with this table is the fact that there really isn't much room between the chairs and the \"wall,\" so it seemed like the servers were having a hard time getting around us.  Not a big deal since we made do, but a bit of a design snafu.\n\nThey have a great selection of cocktails, wines, and beers, although it's vegas and I was pretty hungover so I had iced tea instead (this was ok, but had an over-steeped, bitter aftertaste).\n\nSince a portion of our party got there first, we decided to order a couple of salads: we had one with arugula and one with burrata.  Of the two, no contest: the burrata was the clear winner, the perfect riff on your classic Caprese.\n\nBeing that our group was so large, we just decided to order one of each of their specialty pizzas.  In addition to your standard fare like Margherita pizza and Sicilian, they also had a few more unique ones - one with clams, one with truffles, and another with egg!  The pizzas are actually a lot bigger than I thought they would be; they're 16 inches in diameter.  I didn't get to try all of them, but the two I did have were SO delicious: the Forager (with mushrooms) and the Farmstead (the one with egg - mind you, I'm a huge sucker for runny eggs).\n\nTIP: Not sure if it's standard that they bring hot chili oil with the food, but if you don't get it, ask for it.  That stuff is amazing.\n\nBecause we ordered so many pizzas, they notified us that it would take a bit for them to come out.. That being said, they brought out a few of their appetizers to tide us over.  The toasted marcona almonds were good (although not as crunchy as I would like), the olives were really unctious and delicious (but if I could eat one thing for the rest of my life it would probably be olives, so I'm slightly biased), the veggies were pretty standard (good but unremarkable), and the chicharrones are the best darn chicharrones I've ever had (haven't had a wide variety, but these were perfectly seasoned and fried).\n\nThe service was great, although there were a few kinks here and there.  Drinks took a while to refill and such, but it was their second day of operation and the rest of the friendly service more than made up for it."

I really wanted pizza from seeing other yelp reviews so I asked her about the Forager pizza and she said \"oh don't get that, you can't have it to yourself it's way too big.\" Okay, fine, no slices. So I ordered a small salad and stood in the \"slice to go\" line and brought it back to my table. By the way, the lady working the slice counter could not have been sweeter!

Our group of six got a farmstead pizza, a forager pizza, and an order of chicken wings. Wings were decent, although not very memorable. The forager had white sauce, mushrooms, bacon, whipped ricotta, and spinach. The farmstead consisted of proscuitto, creme fraiche, farm egg, and country olives. Both pizzas were pretty good and offered some unique, interesting flavor combinations. They were generous with the toppings although there was quite of bit of grease on them. Some of the slices had quite the soggy crust. At close to $30 per pizza, it's definitely not on the cheap side either. I'll probably try to find someplace else to eat next time I'm in the Aria."

I'm not a fan of pizza, so a gourmet pizza place wouldn't seem to be the best option for me. Fortunately the offered things other than pizza. I ordered the meatball Parmesan sandwich and my wife ordered a salad with grilled chicken. \n\nThe meatballs had a nice taste to them, the bread was perfectly toasted and the cheese nicely melted. The sauce was a little on the sweet side, almost like a pizza sauce, but that didn't detract from the overall taste too much. The chicken on my wife's salad was perfectly cooked and the salad greens were fresh and crisp.\n\nThe waiter was very friendly and helped with menu selections. If the pizza is anywhere near as good as what we had, it is worth the trip for pizza as well."

The food was a little pricey and tasted fine but the server,  she was rude and slow and made our entire table feel unwelcome. \n We came on a Tuesday night when they were not particularly busy.  It seemed there was only one server for about 8 or more tables. We waited awhile until Amanda came to our table.  She seemed highly annoyed and was really short with us.  We felt like we were bothering her.  Two pizzas and two appetizers took 30 mins to appear and someone in a suit brought it to the table.  There was a nice bus boy that refilled our water and was doing all the busy work for Amanda.  I work in the foods industry as did everyone at my table.  We could tell Amanda had a lot of tables but we watched her make this poor bus boy do all the heavy lifting while she just kind of drifted around the dining room.   When one of my group asked her for a to go box, we got  more attitude.  Amanda was annoying,  inattentive and lazy. When I come back I hope she's not there.  The service really overshadowed the food this time."

So I did like that there was a good truffle flavor (I think they toss some truffle oil to enhance the flavor), however there is wayyy too much cheese.  I felt so gross eating, and definitely exceeded by fat content for the week.  If you do decide to try this, I recommend just getting a slice, rather than an entire pizza like we did."

The staff was friendly and courteous and our waiter was very knowledgeable.\n\nWalking in, the restaurant has all the feel of a modern and upscale restaurant, but doesn't feel pretentious or stuffy (we dressed smart-casusal).  They actually have a to-go slice line near the entrance in case you need your late night fix or don't have time to sit down to eat.  The decor is very nice and the restaurant has a warm and inviting feeling thanks to the wood features and Edison lights.   \n\nWe ordered drinks and the porchetta (grilled pork belly) and arugula & fennel salad.  the porchetta was absolutely delicious with a nice mix of salty/savory from the pork belly and tart/sweet from the apple.  The arugula & fennel salad was very tasty, tangy and fresh which provided a nice contrast to the porchetta.\n\nFor main courses we ordered three different pizzas, a Truffle, a Gotham and a Blanca.  I ordered the truffle and it was absolutely amazing.  I tried the Gotham and it was also very delicious.  I did not try the Blanca but my friends said that it was very delicious.\n\nAll things considered, the prices are very fair and it was well worth the experience.  I would recommend this place and we will go back next time we are in Vegas."

We still hadn't been greeted. The large party had their order taken first. I was ready to cry... I was famished and I wondered what it would take to get some pizza. \n\nFinally our order was taken,  but everything took forever... Getting drinks, etc.  we needed a second pizza (I was starving!!!!) and it took a whole again to flag someone down to order more food. \n\nThe pizza was quite good. We had the Margharita pizza and it hada nice light crispy crust , the right amount of lovely tomato sauce, and great mozzarella and fresh basil. \n\nWho knows? Off night?

Enter Five50....a sit down Italian restaurant serving artisan specialty pizza as well as the typical overpriced dishes and a huge selection of craft beer. Sit down with a group and expect your tab to be in the high hundreds. \n\nThen, aria decided to try to be like the cosmo (in my opinion) and added the \"to go\" line that sells slices of pizza. (no, you cannot get a single slice when you sit down inside) there are 3 or 4 types to choose from... Cheese, a meat slice, a veggie slice, and a rotating seasonal slice. I've had all of them. I find the pizza here to be very artisinal, If that makes sense. The crust is more of the wood fire baked pizza or stone fired pizza etc. It's chewy and yeasty and quite good, especially if you're into that type of thing.\n\nAll slices are just under $6 with tax and all of them are good. The tomato sauce is A1...i was thinking in my head that the pizza was a 3/5 but then the sauce really just pushes it to a 4..its probably the best pizza sauce ive had. Not overly sweet, with a nice zest to it and it complements the crust perfectly. \n\nThe overall atmosphere here is kind of weird.. Like I can't walk up and get a slice and feel normal walking through the casino with this pizza. It's right next to the sports bar and right across from the high limit slots...strange. However, I think aria did a nice job of trying to combine their atmosphere with a place for guests to get drunk quick food without leaving their property. It's not my #1 choice, but it's 2nd and it's still solid."

            "review": "REAL RATING: 2.5 stars\n\nI love Vegas. I also believe everyone else does too. You'll often meet people who say they're over it or hate it, however, I believe they're obsessed with it deep down inside. Vegas brings back a lot of great memories - birthdays, bachelor parties, weekend getaways with past girlfriends, taking a roadtrip out there with some of my closest friends, etc. It's one of the few standing places in the world where you can go and do, literally, whatever you want, whenever you want. I've grown to appreciate Vegas more and more with age. \n\nHowever, one thing I don't like about Vegas is how much the restaurants located on The Strip rip you off - average food at a below average quality. Everybody, I introduce you to Five50 Pizza Bar. \n\nThis was my last meal in Vegas during my most recent trip. I was out there for CES (Consumer Electronics Show). A few of my buddies and I decided to have dinner here before my 8pm flight because we were all extremely hungover. Something carby, cheesy and greasy sounded good - PIZZA! Located on the casino floor of the beautiful Aria Hotel and Casino, I thought this place would really impress. However, like many of my Strip dining experiences, I was incredibly underwhelmed. \n\nSHAVED PORK BELLY \"PORCHETTA\" ~ 4 stars ~ $15: Shaved apples, apple butter and celery sitting on top of a thin bed of shaved pork belly. To be honest, the first bite didn't impress me. In fact, I thought it was very bad. However, my friend convinced me to try another bite, which I did. It actually turned out to get better as I was eating it. The reason is because my first bite was dominated by apple flavors with hints of saltiness from the pork. But after another bite, my taste buds settled down the apple taste and the pork belly took over. I recommend this dish as a starter. \n\nFARMSTEAD PIZZA ~ 2 stars ~ $25: Proscuitto, creme fraiche, farm eggs and country olives. Look, if you're going to charge 25 bucks for, essentially, a medium sized pizza with only six slices, it better be awesome. Where Five50 falls flat on their face is their crust. They claim they're a spin on East Coast style pizza, but it's so far from that. The crust was flimsy and doughy. Another thing that sucked? It was WAY to salty. Proscuitto, olives and cheese? Yeah, it was a sodium bomb! The eggs were runny but damn was it salty! I must have downed three glasses of water with each slice. I had to eat it though. My body was in dire need of food. \n\nThe worst part about Five50 was the service. This is a little surprising considering they market themselves as an upscale pizza joint in the middle of a high-end casino and resort. Our server would literally drop our plates and flatware on the table, not gently place them in front of us. He was spilling everywhere when pouring our water. What pissed me off the most is that he didn't even apologize for anything. He wasn't cool. In fact, he was a total douche. I hope he chokes on something (it's Monday, I'm kind of in a foul mood. You gotta excuse me.)."

Great!  \n\nNow, I'm totally happy w/ Five50.  If it wasn't for this, I'd give only 3 stars.  The wonderfully seasoned chewy bread, pitted olives, pear or apple, mustard, love the spicy Chorizo, usually have Dominique pick another meat side to try w/ the goat cheese.

Next thing we knew the waitress came back with the whiskey. She went outside the restaurant and tracked it down and only charged her $10 for it. Fabulous service for such a casual place.

Endless crowds queue up and drop benjamins on brunch and dinner -- but nobody gives a damn about lunch anymore.\n\nWhile I mourn the decline of lunch, I also take full advantage of it.   That means finding the best lunch specials available -- and the lunch special at Five50 Pizza Bar is a perfect example.\n\nI normally wouldn't go out of my way for a place like Five50, since similar concepts are a dime a dozen in San Diego.  What San Diego doesn't have, though, is an excellent pizza-centric lunch special, consisting of soup and personal pizza for a mere $18.  (San Diego also doesn't have a restaurant with Shawn McClain's name behind it.)\n\nWhen I dropped by at around 11:30am on a Friday, the crowd was evenly split between twentysomethings nursing hangovers with take-out, business travelers and solo diners at the bar, and larger families and groups in the dining room.  Five50 is actually very easy on the eyes, with retro-style murals on one wall and cool interlocking wooden brick latticework on another.  Since Five50 is tucked in the very back of the Aria casino, thru-traffic is minimal, making it a surprisingly quiet and subdued place to grab a meal.\n\nLike I mentioned, it's really all about the lunch special here.  The soup of the day was minestrone, which was absolutely perfect -- warm, hearty, comforting, and healthy to boot.  For the pie, I tried the truffle pizza, which comes with salami, potato, and creamy bechamel.  While the flavor of the pizza was good, it was also a total greasebomb.  I also wish the potatoes hadn't been so hard and undercooked.\n\nService is fine in that stand-offish, I-have-no-reason-to-friendly-to-you-since-you're-a-tourist-who'll-never-come-back-here sort of way, which is typical of the Strip. \n\nThat said, I'll still probably come back next time I'm in town, if for no other reason than that lunch special.  Join me in my crusade to make lunch the new brunch!"

The chopped salad was enough to split at 14.00. It was full of Italian meats and cheeses and you even could find some tasty greens. It was mighty good. We also shared the Gothom pizza (priced at 28.00) which was 16 inch topped with a variety of Italian meats. It was thin crust right out of the very hot oven. Tasted like it came from New York and although we were stuffed we enjoyed it to the very last bite.

Next time, I will try the pizza to go (which did look absolutely delicious.)\nMy best friend and I wanted to grab a small bite and beer at Aria.  We decided upon Five50.  For starters, it took a solid 10 minutes just to seat us.  I figured the place was packed, but once we entered the dining area, over half the tables were empty.  Not gonna lie, I was slightly hungover from Saturday night escapades, and was particularly thirsty.  It took a SOLID 15 minutes (yes, I looked at my clock) for any server to even acknowledge us! Once we were finally acknowledged, it took another 5 minutes to bring over a carafe of water.\nI understand that there seemed to only be 3 servers...but again, the place was not that crowded.  The servers weren't in much of a rush either. \nThe food itself was very, very good, as was its presentation.  I got the mac & cheese and my friend got the wings.  If I were rating Five50 solely based on food, I'd give it 4 stars.  The service definitely merits no more than 2 stars though.  While our waitress was friendly, the lack of attention and length of time it took to get our water, food, or really to ask for anything additional that we needed was just way beyond what it should have been.  I'm patient when I need to be (place is packed, servers running around)...but this didn't merit much patience (not crowded, servers chatting it up instead of checking on their guests).\nAs mentioned previously, I'll definitely give it another chance and try the pizza.  If I ever come back here for a sit-down meal though, I'll bring a bottle of water and anticipate delayed service."

I wouldn't get this combination again.\n-Forager (White Sauce, Mushrooms, Bacon, Whipped Ricotta, Spinach): Sadly, this was bland, and I wouldn't get this again.\n-Special of the Day: BBQ Pulled Pork: This was the best out of the three pizzas. The bbq sauce was good, and the pulled pork tender. I would recommend this if they had it as a special again.\n-Vegas Root Beer Float (Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel, Butterfinger Crumbles, Boylan's Root Beer, $9): Good, but you only get a small cup for the price. I don't think I would order it again for $9.\n\nOverall, you can get decent pizza here for a quick meal, but it won't be that cheap.

They decor is red, white and black with hand-written chalkboards around the room. \n\nThe menu has a good variety of apps, small plates, salads, pizzas, desserts and drinks. They are known for their creative milkshakes and floats. Both with and without alcohol. The pizza was hot and fresh and full of flavor. It is a 16\" pie and two to three people can share it. \n\nOur server was very professional and attentive."

            "review": "Given how popular Cosmo's not-so-secret Secret Pizza is for late night eats, I always wondered why more hotels didn't offer something similar.  Especially ARIA, given how far they are from just about everything else.  However, it looks like I wasn't the only one that wondered about that because helllooooo Five50 Pizza!\n\nLocated next to the sportsbook (taking over the old sports grill), Five50 is a trendy pizza joint with both a regular dining room and a to-go counter to get pizzas by the slice.  Both are open relatively late, though maybe not late enough for the post-clubbing crowd (the restaurant closes at midnight, the counter at 2:00am).  Still, they're great for midnight cravings, or people on the go like me.\n\nOf the four types offered, I ordered the GOTHAM since it was simply my kind of pizza - Sausage, Pepperoni, Salami, Mozzarella, and Grana Podano.  Each bite was full of unhealthy, meaty goodness and I liked how the crust was thin, but not soggy.  At the same time, the flavors aren't exactly unique.  I've had others in the past that had more creative and compelling flavors, which brings me to the next point...\n\n...that as much as I liked the pizza, I'd rather spend the money on something I can't get elsewhere.  Yes, it's the Strip, but $6.50 a slice is nothing to scoff at (thank goodness for resort credit!).  Just getting a single slice might not be that bad, but it can get pricey if you're hungry.  If you're with friends, you might be better off splitting a pie ($20-$30) or simply dining in for the full menu (which looks pretty good, I might add).\n\nWhile I would otherwise round up from THREE AND A HALF STARS based on taste, I'm rounding down only because of the price.  Five50 is nice addition to ARIA's collection of restaurants, and I wouldn't mind coming back to try the full menu, but I don't know if I would come back to grab just a slice unless I had resort credit or if I was in a pinch."

The salads are good portion sizes but the thing that I really enjoyed was what they called Pigs & Truffles. This was a shredded pork cannelloni on top of spinach in b\u00e9chamel sauce with some truffles on top.  The shredded pork in cannelloni was awesome, I love cannelloni but it usually comes with ground meats, not shredded. The pork wasn't dry at all and had a nice texture to it. The spinach had a bit of a peppery taste to it and it mixed very well with the creamy b\u00e9chamel sauce. \n\nThe place has only been opened about two month and is buried back near the sports book at the aria but if you are there, give it a shot."

The place is right near the sports bookie in the casino and therefore it's very convenient. This is a good place if you need a meal but unfortunately it falls victim to the price inflation of the strip. 1 Slice is $6 and there might be 1 or 2 beers under $10. You're basically paying ballpark prices. Again, if you're in the Aria and you need a quick lunch this will definitely make do, but you're paying premium Vegas prices for non-premium, albeit serviceable food."

We were going for a later meal, wanted something casual that wasn't a buffet and one of the casino employees mentioned this place had good pizza so the other non-New Yorkers were lured in (as someone who has had fantastic pizza here in NYC and Chicago I was skeptical).\n\nWe were promptly seated (for a party of 8 we had our own private dining area), and our waitress was very prompt and attentive to our table.  They have a small menu, but it catered to our different dietary restrictions (some were doing a Paeleo diet, some were doing low carb, some were vegetarian... it's hard to please 8 women sometimes!).\n\nI ended up getting the sausage and peppers sandwich, the well suited, and a few of us tried the margharetia pizza .   The drink was nice and strong, and was the best part of my meal.  The sausage and peppers sandwich was flavorful, though the amount of bread was overwhelming to the amount of sausage and pepers within the sandwich so it was mostly bread.  The pizza, though we requested it be cut in 8 (usually their pies are cut in 6), was cut oddly so it wasn't an equitable division of pizza amongst our party (so we ended up cutting some slices in half), however the taste was bland and the crust though well done on the edges, could have been cooked a bit more and tasted a bit raw.\n\nSo for a quick casual bite I would say ok, however this wouldn't rank very highly in my list of places to eat while in Vegas."

We had a party of ten, and were told to wait fifteen minutes.  When she finally announced that the table was ready, we were led to a round table in a secluded area, and were seated.  The reason why we waited fifteen minutes is beyond my knowledge, for the restaurant probably had less than ten diners excluding us.  \n\nUpon much contemplation, we agreed upon ordered four pizzas, and two pasta dishes to share.  The pizzas were the margherita, gotham, truffle, and north beach.  The pastas included the ricotta cavatelli, and a secret dish, not on the menu, which featured freshly arrived clams, and linguine.  The pizzas and pastas came out fairly quickly.  The pizzas were all very tasty, my favorite being the truffle and margherita.  One does not get to eat real truffles every day, so they were a welcome treat.  The margherita had a sweet and savory sauce, and the cheese was equally appealing to the palate.  However, the pastas, lacked anything they would deem them of a worthy restaurant quality dish.  The cavatelli was overpowered with a sour and salty lime taste that went into every spoonful.  On the other hand, the secret pasta lacked any flavor at all.  It was bland, and very oily.  \n\n\n-1 star for the disappointing pastas.  \n+4 stars for the excellent service and great tasting pizzas."

It's the kind of pizza that surprises you. You're not looking for much, maybe, as you pass by or running back to your sports betting table, or between dice rolls on the way back from the restroom. But that's the beauty of it...\n\nMy friends and I crave this pizza -- it's the first thing we all mention when talking about returning to Vegas (well, that and the craps tables at Bellagio). Whether at 2am after a long night of dancing, 11am while watching some sports betting next door, or 4pm after a long day at a pool party, the food is perfect.\n\nCrust: Thin -- but not brittle. The crunchy/chewy balance is near perfect every time. They've got their science down. You won't have a soggy slice that drips all over you. It'll hold up without being too tough to bite into.\n\nToppings: All top quality. The italian cured pig varieties on the Gotham and spicy do not disappoint. The mushrooms on Forage are prime. The cheeses are rich. \n\nTaste: Phenomenal. They don't over do it or try to make things too complicated. Even if you get the clam pizza, it's like PePe's -- basics but good. Like any good cooking. Quality ingredients well-done are the best.\n\nService: Always tends to be polite, efficient, and to the point. Heated-up slides taste great and only take 1-2 minutes to get right again.\n\nPrice: .... Five dollars and fifty cents. Very inexpensive. They're selling crap pizza all over Vegas with a Rolling Rock for $7."

Our waiter, who will remain nameless as we were so pissed off we forgot to get it, decided for us that one pizza was not enough. Motioning with his fingers how tiny slices we were gonna get. We looked at each other and I was like, I know how big a 16 inch pizza looks like! But my friend decided to order another pizza, I guess just to make the awkwardness less subtle. NOT! \nAnyway, while waiting for our pizza, the next table's order arrived and I pointed to my friend how having 2 pizzas between the 4 of us would be waaayy too much considering we weren't that hungry and we'll be watching a show for a couple of hours with those pizzas sitting like rocks in our bellies...\nShe got up and cancelled the other pizza. Our food arrived, had a slice each and two slices were left which we just picked on. The server gave us our check and we split the bill of $43. (For 1 pizza and 2 beers!!!) and left a 15% tip despite the lack luster service. We were already out of the restaurant when our waiter tapped us and showed the bill and said, \" Ladies, you forgot your bill.\" I was like, Seriously??? We left our cash payment on our table! Did you even check at all???!!\nI was mortified. The nerve!! And all he did was turn his back to us and walked back to the restaurant without a single word of apology. \nNEVER again!!! No matter how good their pizza was,  not worth being treated the way we were treated. Management take heed!"

They have room, and seem to be pretty used to such things. So if you call ahead they can be sure to take care of you.\n\nThere were some highs and lows to the meal... \n\nHighs: \n\n- Meatballs (so I was told since I don't eat them) However I noticed out of all the plates people were gobbling them up the most. \n\n- Hummus and Veggie plate: Pretty darn good. I wish that they had maybe picked the veggies or did something with them, but I am embarrassed by the amount of flatbread and hummus I ate. I swear if someone even LOOKED like they were going to get it away from me I would growl! \n\n- Olives: Don't order these on a first date or with someone you are trying to impress, or even, act as if you are not a total animal. I always say, let them find that out later with a little time! heh\n\nLows:\n\n- Cesar Salad: Just god awful. Right when we put it in our mouth we all knew something wasn't right. We didn't want to offend out host or anyone else at the table who may have enjoyed it. However, there were a few of us that sort of gave that wide eyed \"Ewww this is nassssssstyyyyyyyy\" look. Honestly, I am not sure what was off, like there was just this foreign sort of something that was not good. \n\nMeh:\n\n- Marg Pizza: I felt it wasn't truly a margarita pizza. I mean it was good, but had too much sauce and too much cheese with not enough basil flavor to really pass itself off as a margarita pizza. I mean, I love sauce and such and so the pizza was awesome. I just think that if you order a marg, then you probably want a traditional marg if that makes sense.\n\nI didn't drink as this was my last day in Vegas before I drove back to SD. The water helped me stay alive though! \n\nOver all I have TOTALLY had worse pizza in Vegas but I wouldn't make a huge special trip here unless I was hosting a little party and needed a place with a great set menu option with a TON of food."

Given our past enjoyment of his cuisine, we decided to try his newly opened FIVE50 Pizza Bar.  Our decision was made even more palatable since we'd gotten coupons for a free slice and beer from MGM's myVegas game on Facebook.  \n\nWe arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday night.  There was no line at the slice counter where pizza by the slice was sold.  We noted immediately that not all pizzas available in the sit down part of the restaurant were available by the slice.  No matter, since the Gotham ($5.50 per slice/$28 for a 16\" pie), a meat pizza topped with pepperoni, sausage, salami, mozzarella, and grana padano was what I wanted and it was on the abbreviated slice menu.  FIVE50's slices are taken from their 16\" pies, which are divided into 8 pieces, so slices received aren't very large.  Also, since they're pre-baked, there's no telling how long they've been sitting on the counter.  My slice was plucked off of the counter and slid into the wood-fired oven at what I'm assuming was 550 degrees to warm it up.  A few minutes later, I received my slice.  The crust was decently flavorful, crispy at the edges, but not necessarily chewy throughout.  I attribute most of the lackluster quality of the crust to the fact the pizza was pre-baked, had cooled down absorbing the grease from the relatively ample amount of meaty toppings, resulting in the crust becoming soggy and limp.  I was pretty unimpressed.  My fianc\u00e9e didn't fare much better with her selection.      \n\nThe beer selection at the slice counter was also abbreviated with only two beers available on tap and a handful of bottles.  It was also surprisingly unimpressive with only one of the beers available (a bottled Dogfish Head) sounding remotely interesting.  Unfortunately, they wanted $13 for it, which combined with the slice of the pizza, exceeded the value of the coupon.  I could've paid the difference, but as a matter of principle, I'd never pay $13 for a 12-ounce bottle of beer.\n\nMy parting thought was that FIVE550 may be a very good pizza joint with a solid craft beer selection.  Perhaps our luck would've been much better had we sat in the dining room, ordered a whole pizza, and tasted a freshly baked pie.  However, you won't get that experience by the slice at the walk up counter.  It's overpriced...expect to pay $16 for a beer and a slice, and it, sadly, underdelivers."

Before I get ahead of myself, I wish I could rate service, food, and value separately, alas, I can not. \nService 3 stars- our server was friendly and attentive, yet had very little food knowledge, and was slightly over bearing. Seriously dude, I know what kind of beer I like, although I appreciate your input, I chose it because I like it, not because \"you suggested it\". You want a gold star?  I get that it's a new restaurant too, but you should know what's in the food, especially since people could have allergies. \nFood-3 stars. Overall the food was alright, but everything was severely under seasoned, with no salt and pepper shakers on the table. Call me meek, but this is a chef run restaurant and I was not about to ask for them. Warm ricotta was just that, warmed up cheese. No herbs, no salt, just some EVOO. Yawn. The calamari looked delicious, until you picked it up with your fork and bam! All the \"fritti\" falls off, leaving you with oily, naked squid. The truffle pizza was probably the best part, although those potatoes, like everything else, really needed to be seasoned. \nValue 1 measly star-$22 for a cheese pizza, are you kidding me?  Even with strip pricing this is a little ridiculous. Our bill came out to be $90 for a snack, an app, a pizza, and a couple of beers. For that cost per person I could eat someplace a little less casual and a lot better tasting. Not to mention, you can get higher quality pizza right next door at Crystals for half the price with better flavor, more variety, and awesome service. \nWas it worth trying out the new spot? Sure.
