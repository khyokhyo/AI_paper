The food can be somewhat inconsistent \n(maybe because we always order delivery or takeout) but its almost always great. \nI love the pad thai (6), it's one of the best I've ever had, and the orange beef,  \nwhich I don't even think is on the menu, crunchy, sweet, zesty, and delicious, \nremember to ask for alacarte if you want a larger portion.\nThey remember me almost every time (no beansprouts) lol, and with their large \ncustomer base that is quite a nice touch. They do however stop answering their\nphone if they get busy and stop taking delivery orders if they do answer. So if \nyou can't get through and its still during business hours just drive over \nand go inside. The prices are great, it is one of the least \nexpensive Thai places we've ever seen. All in all this is our go-to Thai \nplace, although there are a few areas they could step it up a bit, the value \ncan't be beaten."

The people didn't bring even bring us napkins and they never checked up on us. It seemed like they had an attitude, but could be because we got there late. I got the Thai chili noodles I think which were really good and the 5 level of spiciness was perfect."

Sometimes Victor from the Tropicana location is there helping out and he is great.. But most of the staff is rude. The last couple of times we've been in, it has been inconsistent.  We always order the soup..and last time we were shorted on broth.. They made up an excuse that they were changing the portions.. However, today it was back to being the normal portion.. I found a long, curly HAIR in my soup and not only did they charge me for the entire thing (minus a measly 10% for the inconvenience ) but they didn't even offer to remake it for me! I feel that they should have taken care of us..but there wasn't even an apology! We asked to speak to a manager but there were none on duty.. (Apparently, there is never a manager on duty! Who knows what else they do to the food?!)\nWhen we told our server that we weren't satisfied with our experience, she was rude, unaccommodating and uncaring. We told her we won't be back and that they just lost some good clients to which she said \n\"Ok.\""

My bill was $24 ish dollars. \n\nI am surprised by how huge their servings are! My tom yum didn't have any seafood in it:( it also lacks flavor and was very oily. The beef pad see eu was too sweet for my taste, and like the tom yum, lacks flavor. I loved the fried rice that came with the fried chicken. Rice was cooked al dente as well. The chicken was crisp, but I would not be craving for it. \n\nPlace was clean and staff were polite. \n\nOverall, not the best thai place but it was decent."

We're presented with good Thai food at a lower cost than the one across the street.  Compared to all three locations this one is the nicest with the most upgrade in furniture. \n\nMy favorites are still the specials on the board, especially the salmon that I first tried on Spring Mountain.  I've had the Roasted Duck Fried Rice, Roasted Duck Noodle Soup, Roasted Duck Curry, and if they had a Roasted Duck Ice Cream I'd probably be all over that.  But I like eating in rather than taking out or having them delivered because I like to use the spice, sauce, vinegar that's delivered to your table.  The food is greasy but so good, I've also had the Chicken Satays that comes with the peanut butter sauce which was good and I like to judge a place by their Chicken Satay and sauce."

But between us we ordered 2 salads and 2 entrees and only 1 of the 4 dishes was good.\nWe started with the Papaya Salad and Grilled Beef Salad.  The Papaya Salad was mediocre at best, but the Beef Salad was fantastic.  Bright, fresh flavors in the dressing and a nice char on the beef.\nFor entrees we had Duck Pad See Eu and Snapper Pad Ped Snapper.  The noodle dish was awful.  We each only took 1 bite.  It had a funny taste that in retrospect should have prompted me to send it back.  There was just something wrong, like old meat or oil that had me repulsed.\nThe fish itself was light and flaky inside, but the coating was a soggy mess.  It had been fried, then tossed in sauce, but the fried coating wasn't crispy enough so it just ended up with an almost gooey texture that was very unpleasant.\nService was good, but our salads didn't come out at the same time, then the entrees came within just a few minutes of getting the last salad."

I decided to order for delivery. I called at 11 (right when they opened), ordered my food, and the lady said there was going to a $2 charge for delivery because they charge $1 per mile. I don't mind paying it but across the street is not 2 miles, Google maps says the place is 0.4 miles. Then on top of that they said it would take 45 mins for the food. Why? You just opened.. It takes about 10-15 to cook it, and its only 5 min drive to the office. \n\nInstead of convenience, I'm now going to make the drive down the street to another restaurant."

I usually go with a 4 or 5. Sometimes I order a 6, and that can be too spicy for me, but I can handle it. My siblings can go higher levels! \n\nThe service is great.

I usually get a 7 and did that here also. I'd say their 7 is most other places 10! I also got the panang avocado curry with shrimp. This was totally delicious and while still very spicy it was closer to what I  would consider a 7. (I am not a wuss when it comes to spice but my tummy was a'gurgling after this meal!)

I've had most of the things on the menu and the only things I like are the soups, basil fried rice, sticky rice, and papaya salad. All of the entrees I've had were weird and not prepared anything like I've traditionally had, plus they give a huge amount of rice per entree and in the same container so the rice gets all soggy. For the price the soups are a good value but everything else isn't because I don't feel that it's edible. The meats are always a weird texture, almost like they used canned meat or something like in the garlic pepper chicken, ginger chicken, even the fried chicken which has rave reviews was a weird orange and also soggy. How do you serve soggy fried chicken?? I've had more entrees and also ones with beef which weren't to my liking. The only things I have liked didn't have meat in them or had tofu. I'll still come here for the soups and basil fried rice, but nothing else.\n\nUPDATE:\nGave this place another try and it was even worse than before.

The floors looked like they might get mopped once a week with layers of dirt and footprints visible along with the added ambiance of strewn straw wrappers and gunk galore. The rectangular overhead vent was caked with visible dust. The windows were also filthy. The waitresses sat by the counter talking to one another through the meal, so I had to get up to ask for chopsticks and for more tea. That is not really the big deal, but a family of four came in after us and were seated at a filthy table that had not been cleaned off or wiped down before they were seated. If the place was buzzing, there would still be no excuse, but the place was just about empty. Instead of socializing and ignoring the customers, the help could have made sure the tables and the floor were clean. The shame of it is the food was very tasty, but I am grateful I did not see the kitchen."

I miss that diner, it was good food.\n\nIt's not a huge place, but its very clean. There were about 4 tables occupied. One waitress, and one person in the back cooking I believe. I decided to go with the beef Pad See Ew (I can never spell this right). My friend chose noodle soup plus a thai meal she said she can never find here. Don't ask me the name LOL. Later she said it was just OK. My Pad See Ew was really good, sweet flavor on the noodle without that bitterness that sometimes accompanies this when the noodle is overfried. \n\nI will come back, and I will try some other dishes. Easy, cheap cost, good food, good service. A winner in my book for what it is."

That's not a bad thing cuz size doesn't matter...just as long as you can work with what you got. The decor is actually very stunning. It was decorated with all my fave elements: glass mosaic tile, high back chairs with button tufting, and a beautiful chandelier. It was an aesthetic, pleasant surprise to see a mom and pop establishment so nicely decorated.\n\nAnyhow, I've been craving some noodles and I went with the intention of ordering the Thai beef noodle soup. From what I can remember, Thai noodle soup has a much better flavor than pho IMO. As I was looking at the different noodle soups I noticed one called Pork and Fish Ball noodle soup. Man, I am so glad I went with his one--this bowl of soup was absolutely delightful. You get your choice of four different types of noodles, i went with the flat rice noodles for my bowl. It contains pork, ground pork, and fish balls in a chicken broth. It is garnished with fried garlic, which is the one ingredient that pulls all these great flavors together so well. The broth had a nice clean taste to it with a hint of white pepper. It looks pretty simple but the flavors are so good, I didn't wanna mess with it by adding anything to it. I left it unembellished and ate it all as it came. This is one of the few noodle soup dishes that I didn't feel the need to doctor up with hoison or sriracha.\n\nThe ingredients in this soup was reminiscent of what comes in my fave noodle soup dish called Phnom Penh noodles. The Vietnamese make a version of this soup and they call it hue tieu Nam Vang but I have not been able to find a worthy substitute for my PP noodles until now. \n\nGreat prices, great noodle dishes and friendly service. So glad this 3rd location opened up so I don't have to go to Chinatown or the SW for some awesome noodle soup."

The location is very small, but extremely clean and very pretty inside.

I love that they offer 4 different choices of noodles, as I opted for the flat rice noodle.  Other noodle choices include: egg, vermicilli, or thin rice noodle.  Be careful with the little spice rack they bring out, as a little spice goes a long way.  Without meaning to, I overspiced my soup a bit, but it was still wonderful.  I just ended up drinking a lot of water and nursing my runny nose while enjoying my soup.  On my next visit, which will be very soon, I plan to try the Tom Yum soup.  Honestly, everything on the menu sounds great, which offers a full array of Thai dishes in addition to the soup.  They do take out orders, but I'm not sure if they offer delivery."

We were so happy after that first visit that we returned and took along another couple - who may be moving to our fair city - to introduce them to life as locals.  Our experience was less than stellar.  But I didn't update my review then.  On the second visit, I ordered the same salmon dish I had the first time, and it was so bad I had to send it back.  The waitress tried to explain that they use frozen salmon, and yada, yada.  Its replacement was just ordinary.  The other couple were split 50-50 in their opinions of their dishes.\n\nDuring our first visit we wanted to get more information about take-out, figuring that we'd be doing that on a regular basis.  We particularly wanted to know about the soup.  Our Tom Kha was fabulous, and it was such a big bowl that we couldn't imagine we'd get that much if we had it as take-out, but the waitress assured us it was a very big container.\n\nSo on this uncharacteristically rainy night, we opted for take-out from Noodle House.  My first disappointment was taking an ordinary Chinese restaurant-type plastic container out of the bag that was only three-quarters full.  It turned out not to matter:  the soup was so unbearably spicy that we couldn't finish it.  It also had half the amount of chicken that our dine-in portion had.  \n\nFour vegetable spring rolls were decent, but very greasy.  \n\nWe ordered our main dish, Pad Thai, as a chicken-beef-shrimp combination.  It had a \"generous\" helping of two rather small shrimp, chewy and flavorless beef, and some tender chicken.  This dish is usually very bland at other Thai restaurants, but this one was very spicy.  I didn't mind that, since it didn't cause smoke to come out of my ears like the soup did.  But the noodles were rubbery, and if it had chopped peanuts, there weren't enough to taste them.  A disappointment.\n\nI guess it was too good to be true, but we'll go back to the other Thai restaurants we used to go to before our hopes were raised by the opening of Thai-Style Noodle House, which is so much closer to our home.  Those hopes sadly have been dashed."

The tables, chairs, yadda yadda are all pretty good. (Honestly? Asian places are best when they look kinda dirty.) But don't let that deceive that.\n\nThe food? Pretty darn good. I personally had a bowl of Tom Kha, otherwise known as Tom Yum with coconut milk. The chicken was of good quality, although the amount of mushrooms definitely left me wanting more. The broth had a great taste, and for the value, the dish was massive. However, that's also it's downfall. While the broth was rich and great, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Because of it's large amount, the broth by itself is a bit rancid and difficult to eat without any other ingredients, mostly because of its silky smooth texture.\n\nMy sister had the Appetizer sampler, complete with the great chicken kabobs, well made crab rangoons, typical egg rolls, and sadly disappointing fried tofu. It was too thin and dry to properly eat.\n\nMy favorite dish, however, were the flat Thai spice noodles. The beef had a succulent taste, and the fried noodles were delicious and melted in your mouth. It may have been one of the best thai dishes I had ever had -- even the amount of spice was perfect!\n\nThe value alone makes Thai Style Noodle House a must visit.

It was not necessary the flavor I was hoping I would get. \n\nI have determined my favorite item on this menu is the #38 - Khua-Kai Rice Noodle ($7.25). This dish consists of wide rice noodles wok-fried with chicken breast, egg, and bean sprouts. I prefer to substitute the chicken for fried tofu. Any time I come to this restaurant I order a #38 and the N.H. Style Pot Stickers. \n\n---ORIGINAL REVIEW-----\n\nOrder your food ahead of time if you want to take it home because you do have a short wait time. The food is pretty amazing. They have really good Pad Thai here! Their N.H. Style Pot Stickers  are $5.75 and totally worth it. Will absolutely return again!"

Took forever to take our order, because the waiter was as sitting behind us eating his lunch. Ordered the lunch special with yellow curry. 2 stars for the curry because it was decent. But the spring roll and wonton they give you is sad. Had to remind them about the soup because they brought our entrees first, by the time the soup came it was cold so it was a waste. I had high hopes for this place because its close by, but I think I will just drive to Pin Kaow next time."

I was talked into trying the chicken pot stickers and I am glad it happened.  They were awesome.  For a place that serves food relatively quickly and at a good price I was not expecting an appetizer dish to look so appealing.  6 dumplings lined up and topped with two sauces, soy and some sort of seasoned mayonaise.  Add to that green onions and sesame seeds and what a nice treat to add to my main entree order of pad see-eu.  That was good too.  I had a craving for flat rice noodles and this hit the spot.   You better believe I will be back many more times."

The crab fried rice was salty. The Tom yum noodle was pretty good; nicely sour with just the right amount of spicy. The fried chicken was overdone; therefore a bit dry. The Thai ice tea was very good. Most places is too sweet; it was perfect here. Thus earning three rather than two stars."

She even put the sun shade down for the boyfriend & I since it was a little sunny. 1 Star!\n\nOrdered our mandatory Thai Teas, in those large beer mugs. Truly appreciate the amount of ice, some places overload it and it gets watery. Sweetness was on point too. 2 Stars! \n\nFood came right after, Chicken Satay, Chicken Pad Thai (Spice level 6) & BBQ Pork over Fried Rice. Dear lawd, I almost blurted \"Now THATS how it's supposed to be damnit!\" So delicious!!! Chicken skewers had just enough spice and really complemented the peanut sauce. I even put the sauce in my pad Thai. And speaking of that Pad Thai, holy sssshhhhhh, it was everything & more. Spicy but tolerable. Noodles were so flavorful. Chicken was perfectly seasoned. Then the rice and pork BBQ was delicious! The man enjoyed the sweet chili sauce that comes with it while I enjoyed the sweet soy sauce. 3 Stars!\n\nEnded the meal with Sticky Rice & Mangoes. It was really sweet, even the mango. Rice could be softer but I loved it anyway. 4 Stars!\n\nService was so friendly and quick too. Oh and the prices were so ridiculously cheap. \n\nAnd that leads me to 5 Stars! Can't wait to try their amazing lunch special too!"

It had Chicken Satay , Crispy Shrimp , one  Egg Roll, Crab Rangoon, Wontons, and  a tiny cucumber salad. It also came with dipping sauces (sweet and sour and peanut butter ). If I had to pick one thing off the platter the Crispy Shrimp would be my favorite . It is shrimp wrapped in a egg roll wrapper then deep fried. \n\nI ordered the BBQ & Chinese pork Fried Rice  for $6.95. This was plenty to split and also take some home for lunch the following day. The rice was delicious it wasn't soggy and had fresh veggies in it. I've seen some places that put frozen vegetables in their rice which is a total turn off. \n\nThe service was great we had our drinks filled constantly which is important when eating spicy foods.

The lunch special, which is about the same price as a full size entree, includes a gelatinous egg drop soup. Frankly, it was inedible. You have a choice of appetizer. Egg roll, fried wonton, or fried tofu. Never pick the fried tofu. It's disgusting. My entree was Spicy String Bean with Chicken, which was good, but tiny. It was literally smaller than the scoop of rice included. \n\nService is hit or miss; they never seem to answer the phone and they more than happy to make you wait half an hour to refill water or bring your check.. When the restaurant is empty.\n\nIf you must go here, get takeout of a full size entree, steering away from the chinese dishes. They are inedible. Try the noodle or curry dishes.

It comes with just a cup of rice, we had to ask for another cup, which is extra per cup. \n\nSpicy Thai noodles - think of it similar to pad se ew, but with other veggies like cabbage, tomatoes, carrots, onions in it. It wasn't very spicy though. In fact, they didn't ask us about our spice level at all, but maybe then they assumed to go mild. I should probably ask next time. \n\nFor the portions, these were cheap... a few dollars less than the average going rate. The flavor I thought was decent. I don't know what it was about it, but I rarely get heartburn and did. It was odd is all. \n\nService was just OK. We came an hour before their closing (20 minutes before closing is kitchen last call) and when we entered they kinda seemed a bit bummed we showed. They weren't the most attentive given we were the only ones there, but there were take out orders coming through still. I had to walk up to get my bill since the 3 people in the front were all busy doing something. The food came out lightening fast which was a plus, but also was maybe so we can get done fast. \n\nI was confused how this place didn't have a bathroom, but I thought sitting there how weird that was. I did see on some peoples reviews there IS a bathroom. You just have to walk to it on the side or something. \n\nThere's several items on the menu that is unique to them, combined with a great pricepoint that makes it a good cheap option that's in a convenient of a area for us. I'm sure we will be back for more bites."

Feeling under the weather a few months ago and craving spicy soup, I turned to my foodie Jedi Master, Kevin P for sage (and nearby) wisdom. Of course, he knew that this Chinatown staple had opened in our hood. Shares a car park with Smith's/German Bread Bakery, etc @ Rampart and Lake Mead. \n\nThey do deliver, but a GF was kind enough to bring me spicy noodle soup (ordered 10/10 was more Ike an 8, but hit the spot) Like the original, they are known for their duck and it is an add on in many dishes; carnivore friends love it, not my thing. Drunken Noodles are a favorite and tasty and their curries are delicious. Really love that they inquire if you are vegan when you ask a dish to be prepared meat free and their willingness to change dishes for those of us who have restrictions. \n\nThe value cannot be overstated: you easily get two meals from every portion here without compromising great taste. The decor is pretty, service is charming and on point and by now we all know the restroom is outside. Dining in is a lovely experience as the dying art of customer service with a smile abounds here. \n\nOver the course of several months, we've  ordered them in for Board Meetings, spontaneous gatherings and take and go a half dozen times. Everyone is equally astonished at location, quality and ROI. \n\nAlmost glad to have had whatever the strange malady was which haunted my first week or so of year, as Kevin directed me to a clearly outstanding and unassuming place I'll continue to patronize and suggest to others. Now that they know me, I get my 10/10 spicy level and more. Welcome addition to the hood fo sho!\n\nYelp 100 Challenge"

Then they said it would be 15-20 minutes and when we headed over at that Time we still had to wait. The food wasn't even ready.  After another 15 minutes it's ready so we left. When we got home to eat the food mine was not great- I had the pad see ew. The noodes felt like a plastic material and the sauce  was off. I personally wouldnt eat here again even I just for that reason. \n\nIt's also in an awkward location so unless you live next door don't bother making the trip.

If I was pregnant, I would have made my husband drive to Komol just to pick up a week's supply. Unfortunately, I am not pregnant and due to my crazy soccer mom schedule I can't drive their myself. (I barely have time to write this review!) \n\nAnyways, I was still craving some Thai food so I settled for Thai Style Noodle House for lunch since it is minutes from my own.  I have been here twice, ordering take-out both times.  The restaurant itself is decorated really cute.  but take-out is just so much more convenient for me.  Some of my favorite items are Pad See-eu with beef, Green Curry with chicken, and the Panang with avocado and shrimp.  These dishes are full of flavor and the spice levels are just enough to clear my sinuses and make me sweat/ glisten.  My kids enjoy the chicken chow mein (i know, i know...that isn't Thai food).  There is a good amount of chicken and veggies that they will actually eat!\n\nThe items that I did not really care for were the Beef Stew noodle soup and the Chicken Larb.  They were flavorful, however it was just too salty for me to eat more than 2 bites. I chugged my Thai iced tea in seconds, and chased it with a gallon of water. In fact, just thinking about it is giving me a salt headache.\n\n** Note: some reviews state that there is no restroom. There is one around back.  It isn't inside the actual restaurant, but there is one.  It isn't the most convenient location, but there is no need to torture your bladder. **\n\nThe service is quick and friendly, the price is very affordable, and it is around the corner so I'll definitely be back.  (at least until Komol starts offering delivery!)"

No special d\u00e9cor, no dress code. Just real Thai food at it's finest, served by people who know what they are doing. \nFor appetizers, I love the chicken satay, crab rangoons, and their special style of pot sticker, that is not like your classic gyoza at all. They offer Tom Kha, or Tom Yum, with or without noodle, and you also get to choose between 4 types of noodle. Also, they will totally accommodate special requests. I ordered regular chicken noodle soup, and they made it Thai spicy per my request. \nMy daughter loves the pineapple fried rice, and gets it every single time we go here. Its a mix of shrimp and chicken, and is not spicy like other dishes.\nLevel 8 is my go to. It's almost unbearable, but still has tons of flavor. \nMy boyfriend loves the garlic and pepper entr\u00e9e with chicken, and a fried egg. \nYou can get this as a lunch special as well, smaller portion but at a great price! He gets a level 5 or 6, and its just a tad spicy. Average, if you can't handle it, you shouldn't be eating Thai food! \nThe curry is also a safe bet, I prefer yellow or panang. Pretty large portions with the dinner, I had to ask for extra rice. \nI have never once dined here and not been totally satisfied with my meal, the service, the pricing, and my overall experience. I eventually will step out of my normal routine and try something new!"

Plus, it didn't have that fake yellow color egg drop soup always has. My Red Curry was delicious. The pork was tender and the Curry itself had the perfect coconut milk flavor coupled with a great spice that wasn't overwhelming. The egg roll was crisp and full of veggies. Joel's Orange Chicken was also seriously tasty. It's normally not my thing, but it was so tender and not overly sweet. I kept sneaking bites of his chicken.

The prices are very reasonable ($8 or so a dish) and the flavor is the same. \n\nThe decor at this location is much more modern and nicer than the original one in China Town i.e. this is casual date appropriate whereas the location in Chinatown would strike me more as meeting up with friends after having a few beers. Service has always been prompt and the food comes out quick. It has never been busy when we are here but I think that may just be lack of knowledge of this location. Which is good and bad, I like that it is not crowded and it is quiet but conversely I really want them to stay in business.  \n\nI have tried quite a few things, but I always circle back to the Avocado and Salmon Panang. I love that they give a lot of sauce, because I like using my rice to sop up all the sauce and there is plenty to go around. I also get the duck curry quite often, but what can I say duck is almost always good. I always get the Thom Kai (same as Thom Kha Ka - please forgive me if I am not spelling this correctly). The meat, even the chicken, is tender - often times at other places, even at my favorite Lotus of Siam, the chicken is dry, more than likely from boiling the chicken in the broth, but I haven't had that experience here. \n\nThis is a million times better than most cheap chinese places and the same cost as the prices are very reasonable. Although don't get me wrong, cheap chinese has its place in my little world too.  Not to mention they are in the same center as the German Bread Bakery - so if you time it right you could go to both and get morning pastries for the next day too!"

The potatoes were definitely OLD in the curry, my rice was hard, my food got cold really fast and by that time I was so turned off I was ready to go."

            "review": "Dinner Total With Tax: $20.40 - Very cheap! \n\nWe ordered: \n1. Pad thai with chicken (with spicy #8) $6.75\n2. Pad see-eu / pad see ew with beef (with spicy #7) $6.75\n3. Vegetarian egg-rolls (4 pcs) $4.95\n\nTaste: 3 stars - Our takeout pad thai was on the dry side - we prefer our noodles moist and juicy! On the other hand, our pad see ew was cooked very well, the noodles were moist and the beef was tender. Yet, both noodle dishes were lacking much salt and sweetness. We were expecting bold, vibrant, Thai flavors, but instead the flavors of the noodle dishes fell flat. I favored the moist pad see ew over the dry pad thai. The veggie eggrolls were crispy, but sadly not stuffed to the max with veggies. However, their homemade sweet and sour sauce was amazing! I would order extra sauce next time. \n\nValue: 5 stars - Wow! 2 dinner portions and an appetizer was $20! They were generous, even on takeout orders. They didn't skimp on any of the noodle dishes, lot's of meat and lots of noodles. It's hard to find decent local food on a bargain budget, but here it is! \n\nService: 5 stars - The lady was very friendly over the phone and she also gathered up thai bird chilies in fish sauce and jalape\u00f1os in vinegar for us, as we requested. Even though we were the last customers in the door for the evening, she was still happy and helpful. \n\nSpice levels: 2 stars - Not very spicy. The spicy levels here are not true to taste. We ordered the pad see ew with spicy #7. In all honesty, we both felt that it was not a true 7, and more like a spicy #2. It wasn't spicy at all. We could of easily asked for a spicy 10 and enjoyed it. We also tried the pad thai with spicy #8, yes, it had minor heat, but more like a spicy #5. It wasn't spicy enough for us. (Note, we are avid spice fans. We love the burn!)\n\nWould we eat here again? Oh hell yus!! Nothing a little salt can't fix."

Very rarely do I find an affordable place with more then half a dozen items on the menu that I would consider superb. From the coconut chicken soup to the pad thai and beef noodle classics to their signature and quite possibly my favorite dish here, the pad ped  snapper. Seriously, for under ten dollars you can get a warm, delicious thai delicacy, served quickly, with a smile. This place is perfect to meet up at for a quick lunch or to order take-out on the way home. Especially now that the weather is getting cooler again, I'm for sure looking forward to taking home some of their amazing soups and comforting stews."

By no means am I married to one Thai place, but my favorite is still probably the one by my house.\n\nDon't be confused, though - I still enjoy this place every now and again.  We've spent some pretty good time together.  I've actually eaten here a few times but usually I get delivery to my job.\n\nThe pad see ew is absolutely delicious - the flat noodles are nice and well-cooked, tossed with a delicious sauce, chicken and plenty of vegetables (but not too many that you feel like you're getting stiffed).\n\nThe red curry I had when I was super-congested - I believe I ordered a 5 or a 6 (their spicy scale is 1-10) - and not only was it, too, tasty, but it also allowed me to breathe with its well-placed spiciness.\n\nThe pad thai is good and reminiscent of the pad se ew but I felt it lacked a little flavor as I really enjoy that in-your-face peanut sauce that, to me, is a staple of the pad thai dish.  It had a hint of a lemon flavor, which is the biggest reason I dislike the pad thai from Le Thai, but it wasn't enough to completely turn me off to the dish.  Or maybe I was starving that day.  I don't know, but it was gone pretty fast.\n\nEach time there's certainly been enough for two meals (I just happened to really be hungry on the pad thai day) and the prices are quite reasonable.  Delivery time can vary - once I waited almost an hour while another time it was around 20 minutes.\n\nGive it a first date - you may end up going for a second.  =)"

Go slow or you might miss it because the place is tiny.  Really, there might be just over a dozen tables available for dining in.  But that's ok because Thai Style has no problems with doing take-out for you.  If you do dine in though don't worry, the place is nicely appointed!  New tables, chairs, paint.  Good ambiance, especially when it's quiet.  I hear during lunch is when the crowd is probably the biggest.\n\nCame here with the wifey for a quiet dinner one night after we heard their second location opened up here near our side of town.  Really felt like the place was our own, there were only two other tables taken nearby, and on the counter was multiple orders ready for pickup.\n\nThe menu at Thai Style is fairly authentic feeling, with some dishes looking like they may have got a bit of an American touch.  We stuck with what we were hoping was simple and basic, but had a lot of flavor.\n\nI love noodles, but really wasn't feeling Pad Thai.  We instead opted for the Pad See-Eu - stir-fried thick flat rice noodles (almost like chow fun) with egg and Chinese broccoli, all in a sweet dark soy sauce.  This was delicious.  The rice noodles with the sweet soy sauce was heavenly, and was given good texture with the addition of the Chinese broccoli.  It makes perfect leftovers, great midnight snack in front of the TV while watching Breaking Bad reruns!\n\nWe also had the Fried Chicken over Fried Rice - marinated, fried chicken breasts over a bed of Thai Jasmine fried rice.  This was good as well.  I would have liked the chicken to be a bit more flavorful, and a bit of a thicker piece.  However, it was yummy with the Thai fried rice which had egg, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper.  The rice was seasoned easily but just right.  And the portion was huge, more than enough for two people to share.\n\nWe got out of Thai Style with full bellies and some leftover change.  The bill was not bad at all, our total for two entrees, tax, and tip was under $19.  That was a plus!  We will be back to try other dishes, I really am interested in their red and yellow curries.\n\nThai Style runs some amazing lunch specials too, for short of $7 you can get a choice of TWO (yep, two) entr\u00e9e options from a pretty big list, and each lunch special comes with soup, rice, and an egg roll.  Don't want two entrees?  Do just one, and pay less than $6!  Dealio."

For their lunch special, I ordered the panang curry with an egg roll and egg drop soup for under $6.\n\nThe egg drop soup was decent - it lacked a little flavor. The panang curry was delicious and I was able to taste the coconut milk with a little spice, but had more of a watery texture. I'm more of a fan of a thicker soup base with a lot more spice when it comes to curry, but they do give you the red chili flakes to add as needed. \n\nOverall, I like this place especially the price! I will be back!"

Dishes were mainly around $7.95-8.95, which we thought were more along the lines of fast food prices. The portions, however, were remarkably small. You get what you pay for I guess.\n\nWe started off with a papaya salad, at a spicy 8/10. For some reason the portion we got was very very little, compared to some yelp pictures I checked online. Even the cabbage was just a small hunk, but when I asked for more, they were very accommodating.\n\nWe got some sort of veggie stir fry flat noodle, which was good, but could've been better. The vegetables in it weren't great, the carrots were sliced too thin, and the portion was again, too small.\n\nThe last thing we got was our least favorite. It was a seafood pancake, which I expected to be kind of like the ones you get a Korean restaurants, so I was curious about the Thai version. It was seriously lacking in the seafood, way too much starch or whatever they mixed it with so as a result kind of bland, and FAR too oily. I don't rarely blot food with napkins, but I did so in this situation. Also not a fan of the bed of stir-fry bean sprouts it came on, I think raw would've been more authentic? Just my two cents.\n\nAll in all, we really wanted to like it, we kind of liked it, and we hope that in the future they give bigger portions. We both agreed we could've gotten a fourth dish, which shouldn't be the case with any restaurant to feel full unless it's tapas."

My husband and I stopped in last night (Saturday) at the recommendation of a coworker who lives in the area, and we really enjoyed the food - this is definitely a solid place for a good Thai dinner!\n\nIt's a cozy, welcoming place - very modern decor, with two different seating areas - we asked to be on the left side of the restaurant since nobody else was there, which they had no problem with. Someone came over quickly to get our drink order, and we put our dinner order in at the same time since we generally order the same thing every time we have Thai - chicken tom kha soup to share, chicken pad thai (me) and chicken thai fried rice (him) - all at a 6, or 7 if we really feel like punishing ourselves. \n\nOur food came out quickly. Portions are a perfect size - there was enough tom kha for both of us to have a couple bowls and take home a serving for leftovers - husband finished all of his fried rice, but I had plenty of pad thai leftover. The food was delicious - very fresh and at the perfect spice level! Very flavorful. Their tom kha soup had more of a sweetness than we are used to, but it was so good - a welcome change. \n\nAt the end of our meal, someone else came around to check on us and make sure we liked our dinner and to ask if we needed anything. We didn't ever feel like we were waiting for service here, even as they started to get busier. Last thing to mention - prices are very reasonable. I think our bill was just over $20.

Naturally, I did have qualms about giving this location a chance. But seeing as how I've been on a panang kick lately, I thought today would be perfect to try Thai Style's version. \n\nRESTAURANT & SERVICE\nI called to place to-go orders for Tofu Panang (spicy level 8/10) and Chicken Panang (spicy level 2/10 for some people who can't handle the heat ;). The lady who took my order sounded cheerful and she was polite. I let her know that I would be there in 30 minutes to pick up my order. She mentioned how they could have my order ready sooner than the time I estimated. \n\nArriving a minute or two after my said time, I walked into the restaurant and saw my order bagged and ready for pick up at the payment counter. But what really caught my eye was the restaurant's interior decor. At the Spring Mountain location, there's really not much to look at except for the television set that airs Thai news, though this location has that also. However, this restaurant has a touch of class and elegance. Someone must have taken a few interior decor tips from HGTV, because a splash of color on the walls and adding a little bling to the lighting fixtures can do wonders. \n\nFOOD\nWhen I arrived home, I noticed how my food was carefully packaged. The two containers of panang were bagged separately in case spillage occurs on the drive home. A take-out menu, napkins, and two spoons were also included.  \n\nTofu Panang: Many, many slices of green bell peppers and not enough cubes of tofu. The panang had a soupy consistency and was very oily. I tasted hints of  basil and lime, but all together the flavor of the panang was underwhelming. I did like the spiciness, but I was expecting more heat.\n\nChicken Panang: Ditto! Except for the spicy level. \n\nOVERALL\nI'm giving Thai Style Noodle House a 3.5/5 rating. Their panang isn't something I see myself craving on occasion, but it isn't the worst I've eaten. Service, on the other hand, is great and is one reason I would return."

The food is pretty much the same at all locations with the two outside of Chinatown being newer and cleaner in appearance.  Thai Style is my favorite Thai spot outside of the pricier Lotus of Siam.  I think the options are a better value than say Archie's for the typical Thai fare, with some options you might not see at some of the more generic Thai restaurants. Some of my favorite dishes are the beef/pork jerky with this amazing sweet/salty/sour dipping sauce.  The Moo Tod (fried pork) over fried rice is also delicious, with the pork being fried with a hint of sweetness.  The pork comes over a heaping portion of fried rice.  It also comes with a bland soup...which I generally don't partake in...but I'm told it's a palette cleanser.   My new favorite find has been the Three Companion Pork, which comes with sticky rice, papaya salad, and either pork or chicken.  The papaya salad here is a refreshing option for the Las Vegas summer heat.  It's a blend of green papaya, tomatoes, green beans, and carrots sprinkled with peanuts.  It's a bit spicy even when I ordered it at a level 2 out of 10.  My nose was getting runny while eating it, but I kept going back for more until the dish was empty.  I like that Thai Style also offers duck as an option instead of just chicken/beef/pork.  The duck fried rice and duck pad see ew are delicious.  In the wintertime, I also enjoy the beef noodle soup.  The broth is a dark, thick broth with a variety of beef cuts and beef meat balls.  Most items are $7-9 for a large portion."

My daughter ordered breaded chicken ( greasy and gross) My niece ordered yellow curry and was never asked how spicy  she wanted it. I will never go back to this place. I felt like I was in the Matrix dodging bullets. If you want real Thai check out Archie's. The waitress did try to give me something else, buying lost my appetite."

The taste, however was just average. This is your typical Thai food; I felt like the dish was just \"going through the motions.\" The portions were smaller than what I'm used to getting from out of state Thai restaurants.\n\nPros: my dish was actually spicy\nCons: taste, portions, price"

Interior is pretty nice, for a grocery store shopping center location, its on the corner of Lake Mead and Rampart, but the big Smiths Shopping store, opposite end from the grocery store.   Its on the NW corner.   It was slightly tricky to find.   I asked the 'owner' I assume for her favorite thai soup, she recommended her version of the tom yum, I got it with extra fish balls and spice level 5, since my gut is killing me lately, but I was fine after I slurped this yummy goodness down.  The fishballs tasted and had the texture of scallops, I was amazed, that was a surprise. the rice noodles inside a tom yum broth with some chilis and chili oil flowing over the abiss of broth, fish balls(ASK FOR THIS!) and little bits of meat and shrimps.  My buddy had the Chix Noodle Soup and he said it was the best he has ever had.  I had to ding em up on the service.  Its seat yourself and the girl running the place, seemed very stressed out.   She was there with I needed her, barely, we had to get our own napkins once we slammed are faces into the goodness, but that's elementary for a restaurant, bring me a napkin.  Also, my buddy asked for rice and meat and she had no recommendation, she was silent, maybe it was a language barrier.  A host or something would have helped the whole service standard.  Still, the place has a great atmosphere, they are pretty fast too, and the food is different and very tasty compared to the 100+ thai places I have been too, I will go back again and again....Phob gun Reaw-reaw nee khrup ---translation --See You soon!"

Your options are extensive and include all of their curries, unlike some Thai spots that really limit what they offer on lunch special. It comes with soup, rice and a fried treat, and the two picks are served in a nice sized dish. I think flavor-wise they are really consistent with the original location, and this location is definitely up the scale on the fancy factor- white chairs, tile on the wall, was that a chandelier? Although, it is odd you have to go outside to go to the bathroom.\n\nI selected the mint chicken and green curry for my two. The chicken is minced, and the flavor was nice, but I probably wouldn't order it again. I realized I am out of Thai Style practice because I didn't remember the green curry coming with a mountain of bamboo shoots. I am not a fan of bamboo shoots, but the curry still had a fabulous flavor. Next time, I have to remember to order it with vegetables, hold the shoots. And, next time, maybe I will go double curry."

I chose the flat, wide rice noodles. The broth was so satisfying and flavorful. I went with spice level 5 which turned out to be just the right spice level.

It was not that busy so there was no wait to be seated in this nice comfortable booth.\nThere were two waitresses working that night and they both waited on us. They were both very nice and attentive.\nTheir chicken satay had very strong curry flavor but not spicy. I loved it. The peanuts sauce was not just sweet but it had a little spicy taste because the sauce was in some kind of spicy oil. It was good.\nSeafood Wonton soup was nice and flavorful. Came with a lot of rice noodles. It's nice  you can pick noodles from four different kinds. \nI ordered my red curry spice level 7. A bit spicier than regular spicy curry. Usually, they never get it right. I often have to send my curry back to put more spice in. Wow. They got it right. It was the perfect spice level 7 taste. I enjoyed my curry very much. Chicken was tender. Lots of veggies in it. \nI saw two Thai customers eating at this place. (I saw them speaking in Thai with the waitresses.) I figure that means the food here is authentic. I don't think I ever saw Tai people eating at other Thai places. Usually I see a lot of Indian people at Thai restaurants lately. \nThis place definitely is my new fave. Good dessert shop is right next door after the meal!! I liked it here better than Archi's."

This dish delivered on point!!! They were not skimpy on the protein either chicken or shrimp, nice amount of vegetables from bean sprouts, carrots, cabbage, and the clear noodles again nice portion size. I really liked the sauce not really heavy gravy sauce but more light sauce. Not over powering. All the vegetables had nice crunch, al dente, and looked eye appealing just looking at it. It reasonable price. Menu is pretty diverse with lots of pictures just in case not sure.\n\nThe service was excellent. I got seated soon as I walked in. Never had empty glass. The decor is pretty interesting. It had bland look too it. Sure the walls are painted so nothing like cafeteria style. On one side of the walls there couple widescreen televisions. Other then that and one sculpture that sit on the counter. Odd. Yet they have modern look between the light fixtures above and the seats. If you walk in never think going into Thai restaurant. Good or bad? It all about the food for me. In Thai Style Noodle House case am FAN. No doubt plan on making it regular lunch spot for me and trying more of the menu."

I never thought I would 1 star this restaurant, it was my favorite place just before what you're about to read, I swear! \nBut just as I would go to a restaurant with mediocre food and great service, I will not support a restaurant with good food and horrible service. PLEASE, be non bias when reading, thanks.\nOrdered a few panang curries and 2 noodle items, carryout. The panang curries were very watered down and tasted like it, usually it's perfect and that's why we ordered there so often. But hey mistakes happen, no biggie right, right.\nSo... We called... They asked us to drive back the food, for replacements. At first I didnt want to call, because it was 10 minutes there and then 10 minutes back and the rest of the food not messed up would be cold returning home. But I called because every restaurant deserves a chance to correct their mistake. So I called, they told us if we drove the food back they would have our replacements. So I went, because hey, that's $25 of food I paid for and 20 min to get what I paid for right? \nNo problem I guess, seemed like an easy fix even tho it took an extra trip, but that's NOT what they did. \nI walked in and the management immediately, let me say again, \"immediately\" got angry and raised thier voices at me. I was shocked, thrown off and confused. I thought I was just picking up replacements of a few mess ups as I brought the food back like I was told. Walking into a place I go to on a regular and then getting yelled at for something I had no control over (food mistakes).\nSo I cut off both of them yelling at me, and asked them questions. \nI asked why they were mad at me for the mistakes they see and admitted to, no reply from either manager. I asked why would they yell at me, a regular customer, after I drove back and brought back the food as asked. Again no response.\nTHIS IS WHERE THE 1 STAR KICKS IN FOR SURE.\nThey didn't replace the mistakes they made, right they said they would over the phone. Even seeing it for themselves first hand. \nThey had us drive back there then changed the offer to, remaking 1 of 3. WOW, really? \nNot only did I have to wait for the 1 of 3 to be remade, I paid for 3 and got 1 remake (that's not what I was told on the phone), I had to drive back there and waste my time, returned home to 2 cold noodle dishes that are supposed to be served hot.\nReturning home to the cold noodles and 4 hungry friends/coworkers. I walked in feeling frustrated and still confused to why they did that to me, why they got mad at me, the customer. My friends suggested yelp after I explained what had happemed. They said they will back up the yelp, as they were let down on their first experience with the restaurant. \nSORRY thai style noodle house, but I've never in my life experienced such rude and disrespectful behavior from a business I truly once enjoyed."

Took about 15 minutes before anyone came to take an order for drinks. They finally came and took a drink order and little bit after they took out food order. Coworker asked for a lemon for her water but... they were all out of lemons. Good gets there, I ordered the Tom Kha soup. It was delicious! I saw they had stocky rice with mango so I asked to order it but... they were out of mango. Not only that but the guy was rude about it. So anther server brings us the bill and I ask him to please add an order of sweet sticky rice since I remembered I had a mango at the office. He takes the bill and the guy who said they were out of mango looks at me and says \"You didn't order the rice.\" So I said \"I asked him to please place an order of the rice on my bill.\" He rolled his eyes and left  to clean up a table. The other server brings me my bill back and... No Sticky Rice. That means they didn't place the order. We grab or stuff and go. I give it a 2 not because of the food,  but the service was horrible. I might order from her again,  but only if it's to go. They can keep their attitude. I'd rather go to Archi's for thai food. Service is better."

Now I must admit that I wasn't expecting too much, but Yelp's good reviews and my family's overwhelming hunger led me here. I found this to be an extremely well done example of relatively cheap but delicious Thai restaurant. I ordered Pineapple fried rice with chicken, which was absolutely delicious. The chicken and egg were a perfect combination with the fried rice and the pineapple added to the overall flavor. We also ordered Red curry, Spicy Eggplant Rice plate, and Pad See-eu, all of which were absolutely delicious. At the end we had Mango Sweet Sticky Rice which tasted like Kheer, an Indian sweet rice pudding, with mangoes, but had its own unique texture giving it a brilliant taste."

We haven't had Thai food on this side of town and I've been craving some spicy pad Thai noodles! Stumbled upon this little spot all thanks to Yelp! \n\nWe quickly took our seats and our drink orders were ordered almost instantly. The Thai tea was okay, I've had better. I ordered spicy chicken pad Thai. The portion sizes were fairly large. Everything was fresh! My boyfriend ordered the beef soup with rice noodles and he enjoyed every last sip of it. \n\nService was quick and the servers were super attentive. Made sure they checked up on us as well as the other customers in the restaurant fairly often. \n\nAs far as cleanliness, they get an A+! If you could guess by now... I'm HUGE on cleanliness. You can tell the owners and workers take the time out to clean each individual booth thoroughly. \n\nHappy to say that I think I have finally found my \"go-to\" Thai food restaurant!"

That usually speaks a lot.  Boy were we wrong to overlook the unassuming spot.\n\nThe decor is nice / clean lines / open feel.  The server was nice but totally home grown.  She was kind of all over the place.  I noticed there's A LOT of take out that's called into this place.  Nothing like Thai take out!  That's probably what drives this business to stay open.\n\nThe food was pleasantly good.  Not like your average Thai place where everything tastes good but doesn't look good.  They definitely plated with thought.  Things looked and tasted clean and refreshing.  \n\nThe pork beef jerky was amazing!  Not too chewy, packed a ton of flavor.  I was craving soup and the Tom Yum had the perfect balance of spice and citrus from the lemon grass.  It's a great detoxing soup and they were on point with the flavor.  \n\nWe also had the panang pork curry- level 3 which was perfect to taste the deep and rich flavor.  Any spicier you loose the complexity of the dish.  The chicken satay was chicken breast marinated in a curry coconut and not just sated like most places. I appreciate that extra step of LUV.  I wish the dipping sauce had more peanut punch though.  \n\nThe real Winner were the pot stickers.  Nice crunch and dressed up like it was on a date lol.  Looked and tasted like a dish from a nice sushi joint.  The spicy mayo and contrast of teriyaki drizzle and sesame seeds left you wanting a second date!  Lol\n\nAll and all it was a great experience.  Only 40.00 for 2 of us and we had a Diet Coke & Thai Coffee.  Surprised & Satisfied, can't ask for more than that!"

She came back and threw down some plates and silverware.  She was the rudest server I have ever encountered in Vegas.  I have been in the food and beverage field for decades.  I asked for the manager and she laughed and said \"no manager\".  My mom was pretty upset at the service so far so all 6 of us left.

Everyone's favorite (including myself) has been the duck noodle soup, I get mine with egg noodles and add wonton.  For a year or two, it was the ONLY dish I would order...I would look over the menu and tell myself I was going to try something else but always went back to the duck noodle soup..crazy right?  Well one day, I saw a Vietnamese family all order the same thing at the table next to us.  I asked the waiter what they were eating and discovered Rad Na...so I started ordering Rad Na for a while.  It was delicious!  Flat rice noodles with Chinese broccoli and your chose of meat in a yummy gravy..my mouth is watering just thinking about it!\n\nGradually I've worked through the menu, it was been at least 5 years since I've discovered Thai Style Noodle House and I have to say my current crush and my go to lately is their Pad See Eew and their Spicy Eggplant with rice, but the must have with any rice dish (you can find it on their sides menu) is their egg omelette with pork.\n\nAre they the BEST in Vegas? No if you take into account Lotus of Siam, BUT, they are great if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg.

I always put myself in the server's shoes before I rant and rage, but I've noticed that a bunch of Asian restaurants are not so generous on anything extra to make the dining experience a lot more pleasant. Food is always so delicious here, but even if you have a language barrier, there could be better customer service. We ordered the Tom yum, duck fried rice, and calamari. Sooooooooo goooooooood!"

Been to the original Thai Noodle House across the street from the 99 Ranch Super Market long before the owner began opening other locations all on the westside of the valley. This one is number 4 that has been bookmarked since it opened. Of course we expected the cuisine to be the same as the original on Wynn. What really drew our attention were the the pictures of the contemporary seating arrangement. This location is exponentially bigger and lots more roomier than #1.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nS11. Guay-Teaiw-Loard, Stir fried chicken, shrimps, squid, tofu, mushroom with black soy sauce served over steamed flat rice noodle and bean sprout.\n\nS12. Seafood-Tod, Thai fried pancake embedded with shrimp, squid on top of a bed of cooked and seasoned bean sprouts with sweet and sour sauce on the side.\n\nS13. Moo-Tod over Fried Rice, Crispy pork with sides of marinade in Thai herb plus sweet chili sauce on the side and a cup of clear broth for dipping the rice.\n\n34. Shrimp Pad Thai, stir fried small rice noodle with egg, ground peanut and bean sprout with Pad Thai sauce.\n\nS11 Guay-Teaiw-Loard was served first, and the other three entrees followed in order.\n\nThere are only two people who run the front room. So service is friendly and sporadic but not absent. \n\nS11 was off the chart in every which way excellent. It could have been Yu-go's dinner on it's own. \n\n S12 Seafood-Tod was my favorite. It reminded me a little of the Vietnamese omelet appetizer Banh Xeo. This version is much more fluffy,  fuller, slightly chewier in texture and without green lettuce to wrap. \n\nNow midway through our dinner, we just had enough room to sample S13,  Moo-Tod  Seafood and it was then time to ask for,  \"two takeout boxes please\". \n\n34, Shrimp Pad Thai  was never  touched and just when right into the take out box..\n\nWe orderer four dishes because of the great pricing of their entrees. Incredibly affordable. Fortunately, of the three of four entrees we did taste, each was fantastic so I am pretty sure the the Pad Thai wouldn't be that far off from excellent..\n\nBTW the trip this evening to TSNH was seven miles shorter in each direction than crossing the causeway over Lake Pontchatrain"

You get a good size portion of food for whatever entree you order for a really decent price. We had food leftover to take home.

This turned into 20 minutes. No one came back. I had to flag someone down just to take our order.\n\nNext, they did not even check up on us if we needed anything else. (Napkins, refill, if we are doing okay, etc.). The food was bland and was horribly made. Would not recommend. I don't know how this place is getting 5 stars!!\n\nSince no one came by at all I had to go up and find somebody just to get my check. The weirdest part is that this place was nowhere near busy! So why didn't they check up on their customers? Why do I have to walk from my table all the way to the counter just to ask for someone to take our order, get us items, and our check? \n\nWhen I left this place, the server FOUND ME ON FACEBOOK AND MESSAGED ME. He sent me a photo of the receipt and asked if I had put down my real signature. SO INTRUSIVE!!!!!  He also started the sentence when he messaged me with \"I know it's very intrusive.\" UH yeah, I felt so uncomfortable from just this alone. \n\nI would have been open to trying the place again if the staff did not try to message me on Facebook.

My absolute favorites from here is the Tom yum soup, the roasted duck curry and the crab fried rice. OH and the fried shrimp over fried rice, all at level 6 spiciness. I've only gotten 1 out of 3 plates of fried shrimp over fried rice done correctly though so I don't try to order that one too often but I definitely do recommend this place it's one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to"

Along the far left wall, there are three more booths that offer more privacy -- kind of like having your own VIP section. A regal wooden paneling envelops one side of the restaurant dotted with white tufted single chairs. I know they're trying to look modern, but for me, it comes off disjointed and more of a beauty salon look... but hey, at least it's clean! \n\nFood: Of course, my bf ordered the chicken yellow curry. His review of his dish is that they skimped on the chicken and used sweet potatoes instead of regular ones. Fair enough. I had their pad see ewe with tofu. They give you the option of soft or fried, so I went with the latter. Let me just say, this is probably one of the best pad see ewes I've had! (Yeah, really!) It was just the right portion and they sprinkle it with some type of fried garlic on top. Price-wise, they're a little bit cheaper than comparable Thai places, so I was quite surprised. \n\nService was good. It could have been better considering there was literally only one other table besides us there, but the workers seem to be on their own breaks? Not sure, but I'd definitely wouldn't rule them out. We'll be back!\n\nPS -- There are 4 locations in Vegas (Jones, Rampart, Fort Apache, and Chinatown.)"

And... this might sound nitpicky, but... the vibe of the place is kind of bland for me, honestly.  There's nothing special about the way it looks or feels, which isn't something I usually complain about, but I feel like a lot could have been added to my experience if the place had a little more character.\n\nThat being said, the servers we had were friendly and checked in on us a few times throughout the meal, refilled our drinks when we were nearly out, etc.  So, good service.

It's cheap and they give you great portions. the flavors are on point and the food comes out relatively fast. What makes this place different from other Thai restaurants is the different choices of soups almost like a create your own with the different noodle varieties. I would say it's one point below authentic but makes up for the price and portions !"

The place was empty which said plenty to me, but the menu looked alright. The restaurant was extremely sterile and clean. We chose a booth and sat down. When I told the lady we needed a few more moments to order our food, she continued to stand at the table so I felt slightly rushed. I ordered a sliced beef noodle soup with wide rice noodles, a pad see ew, and a basil chicken and rice to split with my daugher. She also ordered a thai tea. I asked to keep a menu so that I could order a to-go item to take home and the server actually told me he needed it back so that was that. The tea came up right away and my daughter commented that it mostly tasted like milk and sugar. The beef noodle soup came up next and was no more than mediocre. The beef sliced seemed rubbery and lacked flavor. The basil chicken was alright, but it the vegetables were extremely undercooked...more like slightly warmed up, but still raw. The noodles in the pad see ew were all stuck together so I packed it up and hope my boyfriend will eat it, or maybe the dogs. Needless to say I won't be returning."

Wait time for the food is never more than 10-15 minutes which is great, however the pictures on the menu are somewhat misleading. I ordered their deep fried calamari twice and both times the portions were really small compared to the picture they have on the menu. There's only 10 tiny pieces of calamari for $6.75. I could get triple the portion for just a couple bucks more elsewhere.\n\nUpon arrival, My boyfriend and I were seated in a booth. The booth that we were seated in was kind of uncomfortable for me bc my seat seemed to be broken? It felt as if I was sliding off my seat the whole time. But it was fine.\n\nAside from that, their pad Thai ($7.25) and pad see-eu ($7.25) is amazing. Very tasty, and I love how you can customize the level of spice to each dish. The portion is perfect for sharing also.\n\nIn conclusion, this place has good Thai food for  decent prices."

But it didn't end there it seem they made a mistake with one of our order and it never came out so we ask them to cancel it because it seem they had  made a mistake and had not put in this order with the kitchen or wrong order was put in. This is when the fun begin, their server didnt even apologize and try to make us pay for the mistake when we told them to cancel it. The server said ok and we told them we will pay our bills. The cashier didnt give us our bill and just gave us a total amount (illegal) which we gave her our card. Then we realize the amount didnt add up so we asked for the bill there is when we found out they charge us for the cancel order and didn't want to show they charge it by not trying to show us our bills. So we had them void the last charge and charge the correct bill minus the cancel order. Still no apology and just yelling from the cashier. We will stop going to this place.

Well this one really ruined it for all the Noodle House spots. \n\nSo my fianc\u00e9 orders the jungle curry with no meat just veggies. The waitress asked him how spicy from 1-10 and he specifically said 2. I even made fun of him for choosing a 2. He does not do well with spicy food. I order the Pad Thai and ask for a level 4. I love spicy food but tonight I was going to take it easy and just do a 4. \n\nOur food arrives and guess what?? My Fianc\u00e9s Jungle Curry tasted like a 10. He started coughing from just breathing in the broth. So of course I had to test it out because what's spicy to him is not to me. He wasn't kidding...I mean his meal was even way too spicy for me. It was inedible. How is it that his food was way more spicy than mine and I ordered a 4?!? I call for the waitress and I explained, she then sends over this guy so then I explain to him. He looked over at me and asked me if I eat spicy food. I replied \"yes, I eat spicy food\"! I told him I ordered a level 4 in spice and my food isn't even  close to how spicy his is. The point is my fianc\u00e9 ordered a 2 out of a 10 and his meal was over a 10. \n\nThe waitress said he is going to bring some of the broth to take down the spice. Umm okay. How about you replace his inedible meal? We are not asking for a refund just food we can actually enjoy. So instead he brought hot water or some kind of broth and sugar?? No joke. See photos attached. How can you even think that's okay as a business owner?? This restaurant isn't going to make it. I'm sorry to say but you're competing with thousands of  amazing Thai restaurants in Vegas that would never treat a customer this way. Be kind to your customers and they will be kind to you. I wish I could say good luck but I don't think that will help."

At first glance I thought the new place looked really cool. Then after taking a seat I realized the atmosphere was very strange. The space felt really big and empty even though there were others eating in the restaurant. The servers were nice, but not very attentive. The food was good, for the price. I had the three companion. The chicken was decent, portion wasn't satisfying, though. The sticky rice was nice and hot. The som tum was alright. Albeit The decor is still \"cool\",  but I rather drive the extra ten minutes to the other location where the atmosphere makes me feel like I'm out eating rather than the feeling of eating alone at home. However, I would still come back to this location of I'm short on time. It's not bad, not great. It's good. 3.5 stars."

            "review": "So, I'm disappointed. \n\nFor me, one of the most beautiful things about living in this town is the accessibility to good food and even better service at all price points at the drop of a hat. \n\nAMAZING restaurants with little to no wait...EVER. I started going to Thai Style Noodle house a few years ago at the Ft. Apache location. They have amazing food, at great prices...it was my \"go to\" for takeout dinners. \n\nTo my pleasant surprise, I found this location near my work. I frequent Soho House and Scoop in the same strip mall (both of which are spectacular). \n\nSo let's get some perspective. My husband and I are in our mid 30's. Both professionals, and eat out 6 nights a week...solid. We don't cook. We go to Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, American, Indian...you name it, we like it. We are true foodies. \n\nTo be fair, the food/price balance here is excellent. I've never had anything but delicious food from the Ft. Apache location. \n\nBut this location.  Ugh. \n\nWe order from this place (from the office) on average once every 2 weeks.  I get the same thing for lunch every time. Every time, I get pad see ew with a level 3 out of 10 spice.   Side note: I put sriracha on my foods, I get the hot salsa at Mexican restaurants...I'm good with spice. But at lunch, with the pad see ew, I get a 3 because I don't want the spice to take anything away from the delicious flavor of the noodles themselves. \n\nSometimes I'm sad and I can't taste any of the spice. I figure, it's ok. Still delicious. \n\nBut today...today we ordered the same. When I opened the box, I knew there was a problem. I could see red everywhere. Every single bite I loaded on my fork had visibly 10-15 specks of red chili flakes.  I took 3 bites and was literally sweating. SWEATING!!  My pregnant coworker who can't get enough spice had ordered a level 5 out of 10 and couldn't even put down 3 bites!!  \n\nWe called, politely explaining that the food was nearly inedible and guess what we got??? \n\nATTITUDE!  \n\nWe were told \"WELL IM NOT CREDITING YOU UNLESS YOU BRING BACK THE UNEATEN FOOD\". Wow??  Who asked for a refund?  We want lunch. \n\nThen when we said \"ok, we can bring it back\" we got a lecture about spice. \n\nAnyways....\n\nWhen we walk in, we get eye rolling from the young man working the counter. And he proceeds to tell us (literally, no exaggeration) \"WE CAN NOT CONTROL THE SPICE. IT DEPEND ON THE CHILLI\". \n\nAre you EFFING kidding?  Have I not eaten Thai food a thousand times?!  Then he refuses to make the food with any spice. \n\nI've never met a ruder person. To be so rude and diva-like to two women who just want some edible lunch!!  \n\nI won't be coming back. I guess that's why this place is always empty. Lol. \n\nI used to feel bad and always suggest it to people. No more!!!  Stay away!!!  \n\nThere are a dozen other Thai restaurants in a 5 mile radius. Go elsewhere!!  \n\nTo management or the owner, take note that customer service MEANS something. And you've lost a customer (and anyone I can tell)."

On my second visit it was not appetizing. The noodles were barely seared and there was a pile of pepper in the center of my dish. If this was my first time here it would be unlikely that I would return. :( I love the food at the other location so much so I may try it again. It could be that they are new and working out the kinks so I may give it another shot.\n\n\n[DECOR]\nI'm a huge fan of the other location on Tropicana and Ft. Apache. This location is a little awkward. It's too spacious and it feels very empty and unwelcoming.\n\n[SERVICE]\nWhen I arrived the server was assisting a to go order at the register. If I hadn't been to their other location I wouldn't have known that I needed to wait to be seated. The server didn't greet me with so much as a smile while she was assisting her other guest or say \"I'll be right with you\". I would recommend putting a sign to the right of the entrance similar to the other location that says \"please wait to be seated\" along with a sofa or bench where people can sit while they are waiting to be assisted. Currently there is just a tall plant there. \n\nMy plate arrived almost 10 minutes after my husbands plate did. I had requested extra sauce and had to repeat my request when my plate arrived, and again after I finished half of my meal. About 15-20 minutes before the bill arrived I finished my Thai tea and wanted some water but the server never stopped by my table. During our meal there were 2 servers and three tables including ours... \n\n[PRICE]\nThe prices are very very cheap. Ranging from $7-$10"

We got Pad Thai, Pad See Eu and Thai Spice Noodle. I love spicy food but I know Thai restaurants don't joke about their spice so I ordered mine a spice of 7/10. The spiciness was just right and I was very happy with the Pad Thai. \n\nThe Thai Spice Noodle was good too, however it had a lot of cilantro in it which gave it too much of a herbal taste for me. To be honest, I thought the Pad See Eu was pretty tasteless... I brought it home for my roommate who was starving and we stir fried it over the wok adding in more flavor.\n\nThree noodle dishes were around $22 or so, incredibly affordable! I would definitely return here for the Pad Thai as it is my favorite Thai dish. Absolutely delish!"

Recently, my go-to, Archi's failed me. Disappointed with their pad thai, I was left to venture out other spots. \n\nGuess what? Thai Style Noodle House does NOT offer lunch specials, but their prices, portions, and taste make up for it! \n\nThe pad thai was pretty good, not the best. It came out with a zero spice level, due to the server not asking \"how spicy.\" I had to ask for the spice rack to cater to my taste buds. I also ask for lime, which they did not have. Um, ok. They had lime juice, which I accepted. \n\nYellow curry with tofu was tasty and they really hook you up with the tofu! The curry did not taste sickly sweet like some other places. \n\nSince my child was with me, I opted for a \"bland\" side dish. I got the scrambled egg with ground pork dish for $3ish. Perfect. It looked and tasted like a Filipino torta. It was a big portion and only dented 1/6 of it. \n\nThose on 30 minute lunches, I would advise calling in your order and picking up. Those with 1 hour lunches, it may not be realistic to dine in either. From ordering to receiving our food, was about 30 minutes. Then you have consider driving to and from, plus actual eating time, paying, and boxing everything up. \n\nInterior is cool, modern, and spacious. Seating is like 90% booths.

You can find Thai Style Noodle House on the southwest corner and right behind the Lucky's Lounge. \n\nWe saw the good reviews on Yelp! and decided to give it a shot.\n\nWow! What a gem!\n\nThings I like-\n\n- Ordered the Tom Yum soup with vermicelli noodles ($6.95), the chicken pad see ew($6.95), and the BBQ chicken fried rice (also $6.95) Portions were very healthy for the price point and everything tasted so yummy!\n- the chicken pad see ew almost had a subtle sweetness to its flavoring that made the dish very tasty! Not overpowering, but still noticeable ...it was just right! :)\n- the chicken fried rice was very tasty and the rice was soft and fluffy!\n- the tom yum was served in a HUGE bowl and this was the first time I've had it served to me in town with the vermicelli noodles. So tasty and full of flavor!\n- service was friendly and competent. \n- the actual restaurant itself is very spacious and is tastefully decorated. Lots of purple and pink!\n\nThings I did not like-\n\n- the soft drinks, once again, served in a can ($1.50 each). Argh! \n\nAside from the whole soda in a can thing, I love this place and will definitely be back on numerous occasions! Great food, in healthy portions, at a reasonable price! This place is somewhere you definitely want to make a point to check out if you appreciate some good Thai food!\n\n4.5 stars!"

Since I get off work around 9pmish.... They are still open and I can get take out for the next day.... And they are closer to my house then Archi's and they are cheaper. Always a good thing!! :)\n\nWell I finally discovered a stir fried noodle dish that freaking rocks and I have never had this dish anywhere else. It's so freaking good!!! This is one stir fried noodle dish that they have been totally rocking it out on....Khua Kai. It's apparently a Chinese influenced dish lightly seasoned with soy sauce, oyster sauce and fish sauce. All I can say is that it's deliciousness! They basically cook the large flat rice noodles with egg and fried tofu in my case and place it like a large pancake over bean sprouts. They serve this with sweet chilli sauce. And I add some sambal for heat.  They almost seem to char the noodles and that charred flavor adds a little smoky flavor to this dish that's top notch!!! For me.... Perfect flavor and perfect texture on the noodles!!(5/5). :)\n\nI'll be going there again soon to see if other dishes that I have not tried live up to this dish. :)"

Of course, I had to come see for myself. I'm surprised it's taken me this long.\n\nWe entered the restaurant and it was exactly as I expected. T shirts on the wall, a couple of small pictures hanging up, old tables and chairs. The 2 waitresses for the night were having their own dinner in the corner but they were quick to give us the menus and take our drink order. I appreciated that. While we looked at the menu, the waitress was kind enough to ask us if we were meat-challenged and then whipped out a vegetarian menu for us to order from. Yay! \n\nOur order tonight:\n\nPapaya Salad : Green Beans, slivered raw papaya, tomatoes in a tangy, sweet dressing with just a hint of spice after every mouthful. I was licking the plate clean. I thoroughly enjoyed this salad\n\nBasil Fried Rice with Fried Tofu : My husband's order. I ended up eating lots of it. The fried tofu tasted divine. Honestly, there wasn't much of the basil flavoring in the rice but I still thought it was tasty. My husband wasn't a big fan as he thought it didn't really taste like how it was supposed to (he swears by Komol's Basil Fried Rice)\n\nGreen Beans and Tofu in a Red Curry Paste : This was my least favorite of the 3 dishes we ordered. It tasted sort of strange...and very much like the red curry paste was processed. My husband actually quite enjoyed it and said there was a lemongrass taste to it that was pleasant but I have to differ on his opinion. \n\nOur total bill (including a 15% tip) came up to 25 bucks. This cannot be beat. Period.\n\nYes, the portions can't feed 16 people and the restaurant might need some interior decorating intervention but I thought the taste of the food was good, the menu interesting, the service friendly and fast and the price very reasonable. \n\nI will definitely be back...maybe for a lunch special or the Khua Kai Noodles which sound so interesting. Komol still ranks my Number 1 in Thai favs but this little treasure has definitely earned a place in my go-to restaurants."

We were seated immediately, and I asked for the Vegan/Vegetarian menu. After much deliberation, I ordered the Veggie potstickers and the Pad See Eu with mixed tofu and veggies.\n\nVeggie potstickers: When ordering, I confirmed with the waiter that these were vegan without dairy and egg products. He assured me they were. When they arrived, they had a creamy sauce on it, so I asked him what it was. He said it was mayo (which I already assumed) and I proceeded to tell him that mayo is NOT vegan. He said he didn't know that, which was alarming to me, because how can you advertise a vegan menu without knowing what things are/are not vegan? He took back the potstickers and brought back another order without the mayo. He assured me that the potstickers themselves were vegan. I ate one carefully and it was okay. Nothing to call home about. \n\nPad See Eu (veggie) with tofu and mixed veggies: really flavorful and filling. The portion size was huge and I got lots of big chunks of tofu. I am very pleased with how this dish came out. It was only $6.95, too! Totally worth it. \n\nOverall, I would come again for the main dishes but not the apps. The potstickers were just okay and I'm disappointed that they were not actually vegan and that the waiter didn't know that they weren't. I'm giving 4 stars because of the potsticker mishap. You can't beat the prices though!"

He's addicted to the beef noodle soup, so naturally, I had to try it out as well. The first thing I noticed about this little place was the Tshirts pinned to the wall, so cheesy and SO THAI! Of course we were greeted warmly with the never fail big Thai smile from the hostess that I've come to expect from the Thais when I meet them.\nThere were computer printout menu items with pictures scattered around the walls as well, and coupled with the Thai TV programming and Tshirts, I was reminded of a typical Thai noodle shop one can find all over Thailand.....(sigh, I miss you).\nI noticed on one of the printouts a picture of Penang Curry with avocado. One of my buddies wanted that, and when I mentioned to the waitress that he was a vegetarian, she quickly produced a completely separate vegetarian menu. That was cool, although he stuck with the avocado Penang curry with tofu. He ordered it at #9 of 10 in spiciness.\nMy noodle soup arrived and was promptly devoured and washed down with a Thai iced tea. The broth was hearty, the noodles soft, and there was a large chunk of baby bok choy, and plenty of bean sprouts to compliment the meatballs and sliced beef. I thought the soup could've used a touch of cilantro, but it was very good and well balanced. I also tasted some of the avocado Penang which I thought would be too hot for my tastes, but turned out to be just right. The flavor was full, yet balanced and the tofu & avocado with the coconut & curry worked well together. The portions here are large, and overall it was a good value for the money. I look forward to returning to explore the other menu items and hopefully finding another Thai gem for my palate."

Flavor was good & very well cooked. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the tails were still attached to the shrimp which made it a minor struggle to eat, but that's the only thing I'd change about it. I definitely recommend the Shrimp Pad Thai and adding Chili Sauce to it makes it even better. The service was good and I'll definitely be going again."

It may be hard to find because there are no parking spots directly in front of the store like much of the shops in the area so keep your eyes peeled.

A small place with not many seats available and we were lucky to get the last table. Undecided I ordered the pas se ew. It was a perfect amount for dinner. Very flavorful and the used Chinese broccoli that tasted like Italian broccoli, which had a bitter taste, I liked it! I also got to enjoy the crab Rangoon. Very creamy and plenty of filling in the fried wonton. So many good looking dishes on the tables next to us, I can't wait to go back to attack this menu!"

I usually love Red Curry, but their version doesn't suit me.  But seriously the pot stickers are pretty spectacular.  \n\nUpdate:  We just ordered the pot stickers again.  I guess you can also get them in a not vegan option.  However, I am not willing to chance it, as the vegan ones are so absolutely delicious.

It's a nice little family joint off the strip in Chinatown. \n\nI get salmon chu-chee off the specials. It's fucking amazing. I usually like trying new things especially if I haven't been to a place too often but this is one of those comfort foods that I have to get whenever I'm in town. The papaya salad is amazing as well. Their spice level is... Thai. Their \"5\" is an American \"10\" which means their spices are double compared to ours. \n\nDidn't have a problem with this place other than that the place is tiny and the kitchen is pretty much in the dining area. So it's kinda loud if you get seated near the kitchen (you can hear the pots and pans rattling as well as the dishes being cleaned) but that's just the venue. You can tell the workers are just trying to make an honest living. I don't know if this is owned by a single family but it definitely gives off a comfortable, \"homey\" environment. No complaints here!"

Everything about it says \"hole in the wall\" except that they take credit cards. The seating area is small, so I imagine it could get crowded here during a busy time, but at lunchtime on a Saturday it was fairly open.\n\nWe ordered tom kha soup with chicken to start. It was a little too strong for my taste, and may have had a little too much lemongrass. Four of us shared yellow curry with chicken, panang curry with chicken, and pad thai. I'd say each of these dishes were between two and three stars. The curries were oily, not creamy, and the chicken at times seemed undercooked and rubbery. The pad thai noodles were too tough and chewy, but the flavoring was very good for the dish. The steamed rice was a little on the soggy side.\n\nOur service was very good, however, and we were checked in on frequently. The pricing here was also very reasonable, which combines to save this review from being two stars, even though in terms of Thai food I really have had better."

Plenty of prawns but light on the taste.\n\nThe panang curry was a huge disappointment for me. the taste was very light and didnt have much of a curry taste.

Away from the strip where everything is overpriced, I decided to drive out of the strip and look for something to eat. Their Pad Thai was only $6.50 or $6.99 and their duck and shrimp fried rice was only $8. But the moment we got our food, it was so much and it smelled really good. So we decided to devour it. We couldn't finish it. Their pad thai, they cooked it well with and peanuts were well spread out with the noodles that whenever you use your fork or chopstick and eat pad thai, grinded/crunched peanuts are spreaded out and stuck to the noodles that you can chew and taste it as you eat the noodles, it's well cooked.\n\nTheir duck and shrimp fried rice is well cooked and tasted really well."

For the price, the portions weren't too bad at all. For the taste and the service, it's a little bit iffy.\n\nWhen I received my order of pad thai, the thing I noticed was a good third of my plate was occupied by bean sprouts and the rest of noodles. They have this illusion that you got a lot of food, when all you got was an average amount. I did not really like how they did that, but it was $6.95, what's there to complain about? The taste of the pad thai was how you expect it to taste, so nothing funky there. When the pad see ew came, a lot more food looked present than in the pad thai. That was a very good sign to me! But the bad thing was that it had a funky after taste that I'm not use to. It's not the typical taste that I have had at other places, and the aftertaste wasn't a good aftertaste either. I don't know if that's how they normally make it or it was just that day, but I didn't like it too much. The fried rice that my friends ordered though, especially the fried chicken fried rice looked pretty epic... I should have gotten that, had I known how much they would give for that. Well, their portions were good, but it didn't really make up for the service that bothered me a little bit. \n\nThe waitresses were nice and served us appropriately. They took our orders in a timely fashion and refilled our waters before it hit the bottom of the glass, but the thing that bothered me was that they rushed our party a little bit toward the end of our meal. This particular location is a little small, and so larger parties are going to have a hard time being seated. My party consisted of 6 and we had a little trouble being seated. When another party came in that was 6 as well, they kind if made it a point they wanted us out to sit the next people. I understand it's a business and they want to make money, but you shouldn't shoo away the customers that you have for the next set. That's fairly rude if you ask me. So after a bit, my friends finished eating and we headed out. \n\nI won't be coming back here under my own choosing. I'm not really big on the service, or the taste of the Thai food, but it's decently cheap for the portions they give you and so if you want value, I will recommend this place, but not so much on taste & service."

When we opened the door, I was surprised to see how many people were dining. First, this place is an absolute hole in the wall... a clean hole in the wall, as certified by the Las Vegas Dept. of Health (love it when I see the \"A\"!). But, who cares?? The food is absolutely 5 stars! We had the Papaya Salad (loved it..though it was certainly not the star of the meal); Poh-Thack with Seafood (a Thai version of hot and sour soup -- I absolutely could not stop eating the soup... heaven in a bowl); and the Penang Avocado (who would think to put avocado in Penang curry?? love it!!) If the food is one of this venue's main stars, the other one goes to the server.

(all for $35 w/ tip mind you!!!....)\n\nBefore I start all I am going to caveat with is the fact that we ate around 6...it is 1am and I just woke from my Food Coma!!!\n\nPortions were Big!!!  Usually I like everything spicy spicy!...we order the Tom Kha medium, and it was a perfect blend of keeping all the flavor without being overpowered...Medium is a good hoice is someone can't handle spicy well as was in our case, De-Ri-Cious!!!\nThe Duck Fried rice was over the top...again great portion size and you could see the large cuts of duck in there, YUMMM!!!\nPad Thai (combo)...portion size was a lil smaller then the previous 2 but totally adequete...great taste\nNot gonna lie, Mongolian Beef was tasty, but nothing to rave about like the previous ones...\n\nok, without even meaning to I totally just listed those in order from: Totally Yummy!!!...to...it was allright...haha!\n\nForgot to mention the service, service was quick and the waitress didn't lollygag at welcoming us or taking our orders!  Water glasses were allways filled...and trust me we were sucking it down (so to speak) after a day in the sun.  I know next time I will totally have to order the Thai Tea.....you could see these large, almost beer mug looking tea's being passed around, but yea....I was totally craving water at that point, LOL\n\nSo overall, food wise, 5 STARS!!!....I ALMOST took it down a star, cuz yea if your looking for the ambiance and the cheeze of chinatown this may not be your spot, go into it knowing it's a holeinthewall, but with that also comes the best food and the best service!!!  Hell I hear during lunchtime it's packed so that has to speak volumes right...and plus for all that food it was only $30 +tip!!!

Buffets are great for dinner or breakfast, but for that other meal of the day or when you are worn out from exclusively eating the priciest food items to recoup buffet cost, this is the place to hit up.\n\nFinding the location is a little tough and parking can be even tougher during noon time, so aim to eat a little off the rush time. The parking lot on that strip is also rather cut throat, so expect some near misses. The seating is also limited so expect to stand outside if you have a large party or during a meal rush. The interior is not lavish by any means, but it seemed to be somewhat upgraded the last time I went. \n\nOur favorites include the green papaya salad, tom yum soup, duck noodle soup, and any of the noodle dishes. One fun highlight is that noodle dishes can be made with duck meat, which is not a feature you'll find at many other places. The restaurant leery Chinese in-laws manage to down a large quantity of food here, which says a lot. As others have advised, this place takes requests for the food to be spicy seriously. If you are borderline in how much you enjoy mouth burning, go down one level from what you would request at other places for your first visit. \n\nThere are Chinese menu items, but we haven't tried any of them. Really I don't see a need for these items since the Thai is so good, but they might make someone who is Thai averse comfortable eating here. \n\nAs a side tip, for Vegas people on a budget, after eating here walk down the strip and you'll find a bakery to buy Asian style breakfast buns for the next day."

My buddy and I were hoping to round out our Vegas trip with some good old fashion Roasted Duck Noodle Soup so we decided to give this place a shot.  \n\nTo be fair, service was decent and I'd give the flavor of the soup a letter grade of a \"B\" but what I just couldn't get around was the ROACH that seemed to be lounging in my bowl.  Wow right?  Roast Roach Duck Noodle Soup!  Grossed out and not wanting to eat any longer, we notified the lead server and showed them my little hitchhiker roach and even though they apologized for the incident we decided to leave.  \n\nIn retrospect, I'm glad I fished the little roach out before I got more than three spoonfuls of soup down.  The soup is a dark brown broth.  I didn't take the time sift through the rest of my soup but I wouldn't doubt it if there were more little buggers in there."

The owners and operators of this establishment were very friendly and helpful (bad Google Maps directions got us lost).

Even though the server lineup has been different every time, they are very fast and attentive.  Absolute top notch customer service, perhaps surpassed only by Jin and his crew at BFG.\n\nThe fried chicken on fried rice is easily one of the top 5 dishes I've had in Las Vegas.  It's exactly what it sounds like, served with a small cup of sweet & sour sauce on the side.  I've uploaded a pic of it and you can see how massive it is.  Probably a good 3-4 cups of fried rice and 2 large pieces of excellent quality chicken, and just for $7.  It's also really good reheated, provided you throw the chicken in a pan to get the right level of crispiness.  \n\nI've also had a pork panang, and once again asked for it as hot as possible and even said \"way above 10\".  After the meal I asked the server and she said she had actually given me an 8 or 9, which I felt was more like a 5 or 6.  Meh, we'll get there one of these days.\n\nI had my first Thai iced tea here and it was awesome.  Can't really compare it to any other place, but as someone who pretty much only likes sickeningly sweet southern iced tea, that should give you an idea where I'm coming from.  Even as picky of an eater as I am, there's so much I want to try on the menu and I plan on probably going back a dozen or more times in the next month for sure."

Some of the other members of my party ordered their duck soup and said it was delicious. Pad thai and pad see ewe are pretty tasty too.  \n\nMy hubby and I use to dine at Archie's off Flamingo as they have pretty good food too, but in comparison to this place, their prices are higher and portions not as generous.  \n\nTIP:  Skip the overpriced Thai/Asian Restaurants located inside the hotels on the strip.  Food is just ehh and not to mention, they hurt the pocket.  This place has pad thai for $6.75 while the Lemongrass located in the Aria Hotel has it for $16-20 a plate. (I am not exaggerating either!)

I don't think it was a good combination with this type of soup.  So I guess I was a little disappointed with this dish.  I also tried to order their duck fried rice, but to my dismay, they ran out of duck, so I had to settle for the crab fried rice instead.  The fried rice did have real crab meat in it, but there weren't that many pieces and the flavour of the crab was not infused into the fried rice, so again I was disappointed.  But then I saw the table next to me was eating the rad na with what looked like wonton noodles and it looked good.  So on a separate occasion, I ordered the rad na to take out.  Now this dish was quite flavourful. Redemption!!  There was just the right amount of gravy in there and although the greens turned a little yellow by the time I got home to eat it, the texture of the gai lan was still good.

What's nice about the noodles is that you get to choose the type of Noodle you want. Whether you want the fat noodles, small rice noodles, vermicelli noodles, or egg noodles. My fiance ordered their beef Thai fried rice and it wasn't too bad. It's not like the Thai fried rice we have had at other Thai restaurants. Everything on their menu sounds appetizing! What's best is that because it's so small... you know they're making it when you place the order. \n\nThis is a small family owned business and the service they provide is pretty amazing. They don't check on you to see if there's anything else you need but they're attentive when you're looking for someone to assist you or need something. \n\nTheir price point is pretty affordable. Obviously comparing the price with Thai restaurants on the strip is pretty outrageous but compared to Thai town in Hollywood, CA it's pretty inexpensive. Our bill for those two items was only $15.04... a pretty good bargain if you ask me! Especially since the food was good.. \n\nCan't go wrong with anything on this menu! Definitely recommend and would be back when we're back in town!"

I only made a delivery order once, and that time, they literally saved me, so yeah I am a fan.\n\nI was dying alone being sick in my hotel room when I was in Vegas for work... I took a day off to rest my body to survive the rest of the week. I was craving for Asian food, but I did not want to leave my room. I started browsing on Yelp and found that this restaurant delivers only for $3 delivery fee, and the minimum order was only $15! I ordered a papaya salad and pad see ew. \n\nWithin 40 minutes, a lady delivered it to my hotel! I had to go downstairs to pick up my food at the valet area, but that was understandable to me as it would take a long time for her to park her car and come upstairs. I was so so so happy that it was easy and pretty fast for a delivery order. Food was pretty good too! It definitely helped me to recover better than any food available on the Strip!"

I didn't have to wait for a table but a lot of people that came afterwards had to wait about 10 min for one to clear up, so if it's during peak meal time, don't be in a hurry if you decide to stop by! \n\nI've been craving pad thai all week and decided to try theirs because of their name - Thai Style Noodle House. The noodles were good, a little thinner than I'm used to but delicious with a nice sweet flavor and were served with a side of raw/fresh bean sprouts which were a nice compliment to the noodles. The pad thai w/ pork was super cheap at $6.95! Wow, what a deal! I will definitely be coming back for more pad thai as well as to try some of their other dishes when I have more time!\n\nService was ok because they were so busy it seemed like the 2 waitresses were overwhelmed most of the time I was there. At the end I wanted to leave so I ended up just handing them 10 bucks as I was starting to get up to go, even though I hadn't gotten my bill yet. Again, don't come here if you're in a hurry...did I cover that enough in this review?"

So a word of advice, go with either Mild or Medium and if it is not spicy enough, add your own spices!  \n\nThe next few times around we are educated in the spice levels.  Our usual go to's for Thai plates are Papaya Salad (Fresh and Crispy), Tom Yum Soup (Delicious with white rice), then something curry or seafood.  Their Tom Yum is bomb...like as in good =)  \n\nService is awesome and this place gets rather busy.

I've been here an embarrassing number of times and I don't think that I will be letting up any time soon.\n\nI can't say I would have ever tried this place if it wasn't for Yelp.  It's tucked away from the main road and is just a tiny little space with only a few tables.  And, let's face it, Chinatown isn't exactly vegetarian-friendly.  Luckily I have Yelp to fill me in - not only is this place good but it has a separate vegetarian menu as well! With a ton of items to pick from!! \n\nI really enjoy the Panang Curry but I have a spot in my heart for Spicy String Beans.  I don't know why I love it so much and I'm starting to question if they load it with nicotine before they give it to me.  It has a lot of flavor and the veggies are always fresh.  My husband switches between Yellow Curry, Spicy Noodles, and Thai Fried Rice and loves them all.  We've also had the Tom Kha soup and Vegetarian Dumplings and they were great as well.  Don't worry, my non-vegetarian friends, there are plenty of choices for you and everyone I've seen dining at the restaurant seems to enjoy their meals.\n\nThings to keep in mind: The place is very small so expect a wait during lunch and dinner rush.  Also, the tables can be a little tight so if you don't like eating close to strangers you may want to come at an off-time.  Finally, and most importantly, they are not joking around with the spice here.  I usually order a \"medium\" everywhere I go and am fine with it and can usually go spicier.  Here, I get a 3 out of 10.  And there have been a handful of times where it was still too spicy for me.  I say to err on the side of caution- you can always add more chili to your food later.\n\nSo, vegetarians, rejoice!  There is another restaurant for you to add to your arsenal.  Just make sure to specify \"no fish sauce.\"  While they are usually good about it without needing to say anything, we did have one experience where fish sauce added to our meals.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in Chinatown looking for a new place to try, get your butt on over to Thai Style.  Just don't be hogging my table during the lunch rush!"

I've eaten at their other locations, but for some reason I think this is the best one.  The place itself is very small with enough seating for about 30-40 people and that's pushing it.  Surprisingly though I've never had to wait too long to be seated here.  Service is always fast and efficient too.    \n \nI have ordered the: yellow curry, panang curry, pineapple fried rice, papaya salad, and chicken & shrimp silver noodle dishes and all of them have been great.  They also serve up a strong and tasty Thai tea too.  However, I think their stand out dish is their pad thai!  The portion size of the dish is extremely generous and I like how they have the pad thai and bean sprouts separate so you can control how much bean sprouts go in.  They also ask you on a scale of 1-10 how spicy you want your dish, which I appreciate as well.  No matter how many other Thai restaurants I try in the valley I will always come back to this one!"

The one on Jones & Warm Springs or the Fort Apache location does not even compare to this one (since this one is the original location). \n\nI ALWAYS get the duck fried rice. It's my favorite dish here. I recommend ordering their chicken satay (sooo good with the peanut sauce and cucumbers , you can always ask for extra of those) , dumplings , and papaya salad for appetizers. Their Thai iced tea is pretty good , it's not too sweet and comes in a large mug just for 2$. I have to also mention that the prices here are very reasonable compared to the portion sizes. The entrees (7-9$) are shareable & enough for two. Probably the only thing I don't like is that food isn't spicy enough. Their spicy level is 1-10 , and whenever I come here I always order a 10 & it's not spicy enough :( You have to add side spices to make it actually spicy. Also , I'm not really a fan of their angel hair noodles they use in their Pad Thai. Pad Thai is usually bigger in size. Their pad see ew is really good though , they use big flat rice noodles and it's cooked to perfection with Chinese broccoli , egg and choice of meat. I like getting chicken and/or tofu with mine.\n\nYou can order most of the items on the menu vegetarian or vegan :) AND they have brown rice available.

The server suggested to try this dish since it was a hybrid of the Thai Basil and Pad See.. Great Portion, Flat Noodles AND Chicken were some of the tastiest I've had!! I usually go for Pork because usually beef and chicken just don't have that Yum factor.. Basil was perfectly balanced through out the dish. No Negatives what so ever!\n\nDuck Fried Rice: I think they used a brown grain rice or some fatter type of steamed rice that was cloaked in their saute oil/soy sauce or whatever they used to cook it?.. The duck  strips and shreds were sparringly spread but just enough to satisfy. Another nice portion and quite tasty as well.\n\nThai Iced Tea: Typical, Creamy and Refreshing especially after all those scoops of red hot chile sauce!\n\nLittle hole in the wall dishin' out  some Big flavored dishes!! Good Service and Prices for portions! I wil be back soon!"

I'm done trying new places, my Thai list is complete !\n\nKomol: Homey, good for dinner with friends, nice atmosphere\nArchi's: Americanized style stuff\nThai Style Noodle House: The perfect affordable lunch spot\nLotus of Siam: Gourmet all the way !!\n\nComparing this place to Lotus is comparing apples to oranges. Ok, so they are both Thai but this is like comparing In n Out to the $20 ribeye burger at Bradley Ogden. For some of the best Thai food in the United States - try Lotus (think James Beard nomination! If you don't know what James Beard is, don't waste the time/money to dine at Lotus). For a great hole in the wall spot that won't let you down, Thai Noodle House is fabulous !\n\nThai Iced Tea : The best rendition I've ever had. At $1.99, a killer deal.\n\nDuck Curry: A bit thin for my taste, but the duck was high quality and really yummy !!\n\nFried rice with Chinese Sausage + bbq pork: well I guess this is more Chinese (they do call themselves Thai + Chinese after all), but regardless, it was delish\n\nPANANG CURRY WITH AVOCADO: This probably isn't authentic.. at all.. but WOW best curry I've had in my life. Honestly. I would put this up against tri color curry from mix zone any day. I will eat here over and over again for this freaking magical stuff ! Creamy, thick, delicious. Now that I've had it I think all curry should come with avocado!!\n\nIn conclusion, this is that hole in the wall Thai place you've been on that quest to find in Vegas. Affordable, well executed, and some creative items I've never seen before ! I would never pit it against Lotus of Siam, but for what it is - it's awesome !"

Noodles, soups, rice dishes, most of them offered with your choice of meat, tofu, shrimp, or duck. Didn't see anything that cost more than $8.95. Big score!\n\nI ordered duck fried rice and papaya salad. The salad was OK, a small portion, nothing very spectacular. I guess since it cost only $5.95, I can't be disappointed. However, the duck fried rice - amazing! I ordered it since it got such great reviews. I can see why! You'll think it looks too saucy and salty, just dig in. I was pleasantly surprised to find lots of tender duck. This dish portion was huge! \n\nFor all you Thai Tea lovers, I saw the next table order a few, they were served in those huge pint glasses! The customers were very ecstatic when those drinks arrived!\n\nThe two girls serving their small room of tables were friendly and helpful. The prices are awesome, so I'm already looking forward to going back for their potstickers and duck pad thai!"

I ordered my food before they even sat down. \n\nAt 8:05pm I ask the lady how much longer for my food, and she had said it's on its way. \n\n8:15am comes around and I ask her again, and while walking away from me she says \"it's coming\" \n\nTo me, I was just wondering why a basic two dish to-go order was already taking up-wards of 30 minutes to come. \n\n8:20pm comes along and they bring out two items to the party of 9. At that point I had asked the lady one more time and she flat out walked away from me and had not given me an answer. This whole time I was keeping my cool, but at this moment I couldn't take it any longer. \n\nSo I stand up and wait right where the cash register is. And finally at 8:25pm they finally arrive with my food. And she just hands it to me and doesn't say anything like sorry for the wait or have a good night or anything. \n\nTo me it was an absolute pathetic display of costumer service. Waiting 40 minutes for two simple items. Love this place but that left a bad taste in my mouth."

Of course, I always have Yelp to guide me to something on the menu that is likely to please.\n\nAs I expected, when I ordered the Noodle House Tom Yum Noodle Soup (fat noodles with a 7 on the spice range), I got a series of questions from the server, all apparently designed to discourage me from my order: \"It's sour.\" she says. \"Sure you want soup?\" she asks, \"That's very hot.\" came her final plea, with a combined look of confusion and compassion (the later to be served after diner).\n\nThe fat noodles were a perfect compliment to the hot and sour soup and a 7 on the spice level sat just perfect with me. A great big thank you to the Yelpers out there, who provided the ammunition I needed to complete my order without the assistance (or even approval) of the server. Don't get me wrong, she did a splendid job and was very attentive to my water glass (Misty and I are simpatico on this matter), she just looked frightened that I would have a coronary and she'd have to cover my tab out of her tips.\n\nThere is a sister restaurant out in my neck of the woods that I will be making regular visits to as I learn more about this Thai food craze everyone's going on about - :). \n\nI figure I got a good ten years left before I have fully traversed the culinary landscape that is Chinatown alone, so many wonderful new flavors for the tongue. The Noodle House is definitely going to become one of my new standards, even if they never stop looking terrified of my menu selctions."

It's a small kitchen! Give them a break!!\n\nPad thai was pretty good, a little sticky. All the noodles got stuck together, but that shows the noodle was not cooked with two cups of oil.\n\nGreen curry was only reason I deduct a star from the rating. It was a little salty and I did not find it tasty at all. I mean, curry should taste complex and rich, but this one did not have either character.\n\nI would definitely go back and maybe become a regular.........also the service was super friendly."

The picture that are posted will tell the short version of this long tale!\n\nThai Style Noodle House is small and can only sit a very limited amount of people. This is not the best place for a party greater than 4-6 people. The table are usually set for two people and if a table with 4 shows they will combine a table for you. They only have two racks of hot sauce  holders which you must share with all the table in the restaurant. \n\nMy table of two ordered Chicken Pad Thai, Chu Chee Salmon, and Duck Fried Rice. I also had the Thai Style Ice Tea. \n\nThe place would have received four stars but some error occurred on the waitress side. I placed an order for Thai Style Ice Tea in the beginning when they ask for drinks. She returns with water for my guest and nothing for me. She places our three orders and I start to wait. Once the chicken pad thai and duck fried rice has arrived I informed her about my miss drink. She recalls and bring me the Thai Style Ice Tea. I highly recommend the pad thai because it was delicious and the thai style ice tea. I was a little disappointed in the duck fried rice since it seem to have more pork than duck. We informed the waitress that we have not gotten the Chu Chee Salmon and she informed us it was coming. By the time we finish the pad thai and was almost done with the duck fried rice the Chu Chee Salmon has arrived. I am guess she has forgot about the order until the reminder.

Alas, no photos because I didn't foresee this meal even happening and because of subpar battery management earlier in the day...\n\nI enjoyed a late dinner at Thai Style Noodle House tonight with a group of 7. We actually had a ~10 minute wait, which turned out to be a good omen (as it usually is). We ate family-style and were keen on trying a lot of different dishes, including the mythical duck fried rice that my friend had recommended. Unfortunately, they had ran out of duck, which was quite disappointing at the time. After making some substitutions, we got to work on the meal.\n\nPad thai w/ shrimp ($7.95): it's pretty similar to every other good pad thai that I've had. It's savory and sweet. There are a lot of bean sprouts on the side.\n\nPad see-eu w/ combination meat ($8.95): as good as any pad see-eu (spelling variations included), with a few different meats that were all tasty, and a nice Chinese broccoli.\n\nThree flavor grill salmon ($8.95): I haven't seen this before, but it's surprisingly good. There's also ground meat and shrimp with this, and it's largely savory. It's served with rice to help soak up all the great sauce.\n\nBBQ pork & Chinese sausages fried rice ($7.25): another delicious order. Heavily Chinese-influenced, especially in the featured meats.\n\nTom yum soup w/ seafood ($7.95): not as sour as some versions that I've had, which I appreciate. Various seafood items, mushroom, tomatoes, and veggies fill the bowl. It is possibly a feat for one person even at a moderately sour level, but it is definitely a treat for a group to share.\n\nPanang curry w/ chicken ($6.95): despite being ordered as a 3, it seemed more like a 4 or 5 to me. Maybe the inclusion of the spicy peppers did it. It's a rich curry that's maybe just a tad salty, but the rice helped to moderate that flavor.\n\nI really couldn't find any fault with the food, and the service was solid too. The only real annoyance (aside from the 86'd duck) tonight was the smell of dishwashing. I probably sat the closest to the back area, and it was a bit annoying. Luckily, it went away before our food arrived, but it could've been worse.\n\nThere might be another hot Thai restaurant around the corner (almost literally), but Thai Style Noodle House hit the spot for me and my group. As I said before, I'll be back for that duck fried rice, and hopefully my phone won't be dead that time!"

I will go as far as saying that if I were to sit down and eat here, it is like eating in the bathroom of a gas station. I'm truly sorry if I just ruined your appetite. Instead, I asked for a to-go order of a papaya salad and a red curry with tofu. The papaya salad was extremely fresh because the vegetables were very nice and crunchy. Love it!!! Similarly, the red curry had just the right amount of viscosity while being flavorful and delicious and full of fresh ingredients. So good that I ate half the container without even realizing it. \n\nI plan on coming back for more as I'm now a  huge fan of the food here!"

She asked me \"how spicy on a scale of 1-10?\" I said 7. Fast forward 8 minutes later, my pad thai was NOT spicy AT ALL. =/ What the.... hmmm.

There's other Thai in the area I usually hit up and if I want to eat at TSNH, there are other locations closer to home. It seemed they painted and it looks cleaner in here than what I remember. \n\nWe started with a appetizer of potstickers. It's standard potstickers, but good. They do a trio of sauces swirled on it, not the typical soy based sauce. \n\nI got a rice plate of spicy thai basil with pork at a 6 level which wasn't that spicy so I doused it with hot sauce. I like my spicy, Thai level spicy and since I haven't been here in a while, I wanted to go middle of the road to gauge it. Still the flavor of it was good though.\n\nScott got red curry I believe with chicken and I took a bite and it was rather good. It was oddly more spicy than mine even though he got less spice level.\n\nService was decent enough. My water was refilled which is appreciated in this crazy heatwave. \n\nFor a appetizer, 2 entrees and a drink for $22, this is some cheap eats. Definitely the prices are great since most is about $7.

He told me that he wanted to take me to his secret Thai restaurant that he thinks is bombb, but doesn't know the name of it because it doesn't have a sign on the door. After I parked and walked up to it, I was like oh duh, Thai Style Noodle House and jumped on Yelp to see what I should get. First off, I recall people mentioning that they may not give lunch menus unless you ask, so we sat down & searched for the lunch menu, but it was nowhere to be found. I ask the waitress & boom, out comes the lunch menu. I think it's $5.50 for 1 entree & $7.something for 2. \n\nWhen my friend orders, she asked him what level spiciness 1-10, but I was still debating if I should go healthy and get a salad or order some yummy lunch specials. It took me awhile to order & the waitress asked me instead if I want mild, medium, or hot for my spicy eggplant with beef and green curry with chicken. I thought that was weird, but I got hot (whatever that means). Lunch specials also come with a choice of eggroll or fried tofu & a little salad. We got home & dug in. The spicy eggplant was nothing special and the green curry was not as basil-y as others I've tried. The vegetables in the green curry were kind of funky, as in, they weren't very bountiful or filling and I have no idea what anything else was other than the green beans (even those I'm uncertain of). Anyway, my other complaint is that \"hot\" was not hot. My 2 year old was digging in, and she's not one for super spicy foods. Overall, I'd say lunch specials are fair and the food was alright. I'd come back to try the noodles someday, if I'm in the area."

I've loved the wait staff, the food wasn't always consistent (as in you can tell it was cooked different - different chefs) but always really good. The yellow curry is the best curry I've had in Vegas, hands down, and I know many people who agree with me. The waitresses were always amazing and sweet. My last two visits have been horrible, though. I noticed there's different people waiting now so this does not apply to those who've been working for a while. When I asked for the vegan menu the young man waiting on me told me I can just use the regular menu. I don't understand why he couldn't just give me the easy to read vegan/vegetarian menu.. I've always gotten it before? I didn't need it because I always get the same dishes, but I wanted to use it to introduce my friend who was also vegan. Anyways when I ordered my silver noodle salad vegan (with fried tofu) the waitress (from what I remember short skinny more mature with glasses but I could be wrong) misunderstood and brought me the fried tofu appetizer.  When I told her it wasn't what I ordered thinking it might've been meant for another table she snapped at me rudely that's it what I asked for. I said no... I wanted my silver noodle salad with fried tofu.. Same as I always order it. Then she rudely snatched the plate off the table. I was appalled by such a rude response.   Second time recently that I came in it was the young man again and he's not necessarily a jerk but it's almost rushed and like we are not wanted there. I felt compelled to update my review because my father who I've introduced to Thai noodle house and who is a huge fan has had similar experiences lately as well. With the rude skinny older lady and other new waiters to the point that he doesn't enjoy going there anymore. I love this restaurant and location and I really don't want it to go down due to the terrible new waitstaff. I'll still go to the other locations in the meantime but something has To be done about the poor new service! Besides that everyone has always been very welcoming and friendly.. I swear it's just the new waitstaff. Love you Thai noodle house and it hurts my heart to lower my rating because this is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas."

I learned my lesson with the papaya salad that medium is blazing hot in Thailand's culture. Despite how delicious the papaya salad was prepared, not even halfway through my taste buds were on fire and my lips were feeling like they were seared off! Lesson learned with that, but the papaya salad was still fabulous, as well as the pot-stickers (the sauces really compliment the appetizer just right!)\n\nMy favorites were the Red Curry Chicken and the Thai Tea. The Thai Tea is a MONSTER, they serve it to you in a huge mug and if your food has a little kick, the Thai Tea is actually a good remedy to cool down your taste buds! This place is very small in size and I hope they will expand it over time, but this has to be one of my newfound favorite places in Las Vegas and the Chinatown area to venture!"

Its such a great place to go for lunch, its really affordable, has great options, and huge portions. The vegetarian menu is fairly extensive. I've tried (and liked) the green curry, eggplant tofu, and pad-kee mao.  Definitely a great place to enjoy a lot of good food."

If Lotus is my classier and more diverse wife, Thai Style Noodle House is my down-to-Earth and no BS mistress.  There are times when I just want to be taken care of, I don't want frills, just delicious, authentic, straight-up Thai goodness.  Those are the times I go to Thai Style.  She's all content, inexpensive, gives more than receives, and I love her.\n\nEveryone loves the noodle soup for a good reason, it's probably the best and cheapest you'll get in Vegas.  But don't forget to try other things, like the ginger snapper or the duck pad kee mao, both yummy!  The squid salad is not as good as Lotus, but it's half the price so there you go.  I'm sure there are things Lotus doesn't do as well as Thai Style.  Oh, am I defending my mistress over my wife?  I'm sorry, sometimes I can't control myself.\n\nWell, there's another thing with my mistress.  She surprises me with how thoughtful she can be.  There's a waitress at Thai Style that has an amazing memory.  I've been there three times, and she already has my preferences tattooed into her memory.  Yep, come on in to Thai Style.  She doesn't have to just be mine."

This is a no frills Thai food restaurant, that is decorated with t-shirts sold to tourists visiting Thailand.\n\nThe food served here is not refined, but is delicious and comforting. I would describe it as the food one might expect to be served, when tagging along with their new college freshmen best dorm buddy (who is Thai, instead of the Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese ones I actually met back in college) going home for the weekend, with or without the nearly obligatory 2-weeks worth of laundry for mommy to wash.\n\nThe service here is excellent when we visited this past Sunday.  It wasn't too busy when we arrived, and the waitress took her time to recommend the various dishes in each section of the menu to try, plus the specials they have posted on the wall by the t-shirts.  I opted for the Chicken Khua-Kai Rice Noodles (even though I really wanted to try their Pad Se Ew) and the portion was decent, and it hits the spot. My friend ordered the Yellow Curry (I like the flavor of the curry and it wasn't too spicy and will probably try it on my own in a future visit).  We also shared the Fried Shrimp Rolls appetizer, that came out piping hot with the Thai Sweet Chilli Sauce, I didn't really care for this appetizer and will probably not try it again in the future.\n\nPrice-wise I was expecting it to be a little less, but I am sure their rent is not cheap, and they must charge enough to make it worthwhile to stay and run their business and continue to serve comforting Thai family cooking to locals and out of town guests.\n\nMy rating thus far is 3.6 stars (rounding up to a 4).\n\nP.S.  Now that it is summer, I wonder if they have the traditional sticky rice with mango dessert?  Man I love those!"

It's a neighbothood restaurant in Chinatown and that's what you get in terms of ambiance. In terms of Quality they are alwys respectful, cheerful and though tend to be more businesslike than friendly they do an excellant job.

We originally were headed to Palms for their buffet, but since it was Father's Day and a Sunday, they only offered a pricy brunch at $22.99 each. Thus, Thai food it was.\n\nLocation: Turn on Wynn and look out for the \"Noodle House\" sign. Parking is located along all the other strip mall restaurants on the main road. The inside of the restaurant is very small; you can see all the tables once you walk into the place. Luckily, we arrived a little before the lunch rush, at 11:30, so we only had to wait 10 minutes for a table for 5. The two servers were excellent at clearing tables and getting people seated, so turnaround was very quick.\n\nFood: We decided to order family style, so we shared the #41 shrimp pad thai, #42 pad see ew w/ chicken, thai fried rice w/ shrimp, #4 special deep fried snapper w/ ginger. The noodle dishes came out in a short amount of time, and they were fantastic! I particularly liked the pad see eww with the delicious flat noodles and the tasty sauce. The snapper was part of a sauce dish (not just deep fried and on a plate like we expected), but it was also delicious, as was the other two dishes. For drinks, we got a thai iced tea, which was a cool treat on a hot 111 degree Las Vegas day!\n\nBest part, the bill came out to only $35 for everything (not including tip). What a steal! \n\nQuality, authentic food, quick service, and very affordable prices. Well- deserved five stars and our favorite meal during our trip! We look forward to coming back next time we are in the area."

Been to the original Thai Noodle House across the street from the 99 Ranch Super Market long before the owner began opening other locations all on the westside of the valley. This one is number 4 that has been bookmarked since it opened. Of course we expected the cuisine to be the same as the original on Wynn. What really drew our attention were the the pictures of the contemporary seating arrangement. This location is exponentially bigger and lots more roomier than #1.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nS11. Guay-Teaiw-Loard, Stir fried chicken, shrimps, squid, tofu, mushroom with black soy sauce served over steamed flat rice noodle and bean sprout.\n\nS12. Seafood-Tod, Thai fried pancake embedded with shrimp, squid on top of a bed of cooked and seasoned bean sprouts with sweet and sour sauce on the side.\n\nS13. Moo-Tod over Fried Rice, Crispy pork with sides of marinade in Thai herb plus sweet chili sauce on the side and a cup of clear broth for dipping the rice.\n\n34. Shrimp Pad Thai, stir fried small rice noodle with egg, ground peanut and bean sprout with Pad Thai sauce.\n\nS11 Guay-Teaiw-Loard was served first, and the other three entrees followed in order.\n\nThere are only two people who run the front room. So service is friendly and sporadic but not absent. \n\nS11 was off the chart in every which way excellent. It could have been Yu-go's dinner on it's own. \n\n S12 Seafood-Tod was my favorite. It reminded me a little of the Vietnamese omelet appetizer Banh Xeo. This version is much more fluffy,  fuller, slightly chewier in texture and without green lettuce to wrap. \n\nNow midway through our dinner, we just had enough room to sample S13,  Moo-Tod  Seafood and it was then time to ask for,  \"two takeout boxes please\". \n\n34, Shrimp Pad Thai  was never  touched and just when right into the take out box..\n\nWe ordered four dishes because of the great pricing of their entrees. Incredibly affordable. Fortunately, of the three of four entrees we did taste, each was fantastic so I am pretty sure the the Pad Thai wouldn't be that far off from excellent..\n\nBTW the trip this evening to TSNH was seven miles shorter in each direction than crossing the causeway over Lake Pontchatrain."

The fried rice was well seasoned all around, had bits of carrots, onions, peas, green onions, and scrambled eggs. The Pad Thai was delicious, a generous plateful of slippery rice noodles with the perfect blend of sauce and heat. I really appreciated the large side of bean sprouts, so that you can add as much and as little as you like.\n\nIt's a very family run place, the tables were all full during lunch service on a Wednesday, with a heavy flow of take-out orders.\n\nThey had some specials on their board that I definitely have to try for the next time, the one that comes to mind is Crispy Pork with Chinese Broccoli :oP\n\nBottom line: amazing, flavorful Thai food, served the way it was meant to at the price sure to appease everyone!"

Walking in the place is nothing to brag about in a sense of atomosphere or ambience, however their food is something to brag about. Going with my trusty old favorite I ordered the Pad-Thai and much to my surprise I was VERY impressed. Just the right amount of spice, sweetness, and peanuty crunch! I also sampled the sweet and sour chicken that was also very amazing. When I am back in town I will be sure to swing back by for some great Asian goodness!"

This place has severely disappointed my gf and me on our recent visit this winter.\n\nWe got there and it is busy as usual since it was lunch time. Servers seemed stressed and distracted, but I won't rail them for that. We sat down and got our menus and it took forever to take our order (10-15 min). We ordered a Tom yum noodle soup and sticky rice. Note that we came in first and got our order down first in front of three other groups who sat down after us, yet they got their food first and ours arrived last after 10-15 min. Maybe they treat their regulars or Thai people better??? \n\nSo my Tom yum noodle soup was just what I expected, but the sticky rice was horrible. First of all sticky rice should be soft and easily chewable, but our sticky rice was hard to chew and majority of it still had rice uncooked!! Raw rice in our dessert? Wtf! So my gf went to the cashier to ask about it, and her response was \"no that's how it is supposed to be\" in a rude tone. I'm sorry, but we have had sticky rice from many Thai places and I have friends who are Thai that I have asked and they all say that it is not supposed to be raw! \n\nServers are completely incompetent and rude. Total disappointment especially after our first few visits. Maybe they should hire that girl who first helped us and made this place our first thing to visit when we go to Vegas."

It is hard to find in the dark, even harder to park as it is on the street at the end of an industrial complex.  It is right across to the East from Chinatown Mall which also has parking problems during prime eating hours.\n\nMy initial attraction to this place was from reviews by a few of my friends.  When I checked in I was impressed to find Misti, the Vegas CM, is the Duchess of this place.\n\nI chose a Thai iced tea to drink.  Even in my limited experience it was only OK but not great.  It got better from there.  As an appetizer I ordered shrimp rolls ($5.95) which were 6 large shrimp in a roll and deep fried with a peanut sauce.  For my entree I chose Rad-na with chicken.  It was very good but I feel I cheated myself of some flavor by ordering it mild rather than 3 or 4 on the spice scale.\n\nIt is definitely a hole in the wall with basic decor.  The service was really great and the two young women were on top of their game while still being able to kid around with the regulars, it is a very comfortable place to visit.   While I was there both a sit down customer and a take out customer mentioned they had driven past the second location to go there because they did not like the food there as well.  I am sure by the comments that they are trying very hard to make them indistinguishable,\n\nI very much enjoyed my dinner here."

The satay sauce that they added was particularly yummy. We then shared the payaya salad mild (thank you yelp reviewers!!!) and it was delicious and still very spicy. I had never had this dish before, and loved it.\n\nThen, we shared Khua-Kai Rice Noodles. A giant portion of stir-fried noodles, chicken, egg, bean sprouts and green onions. All this served in a delicious slightly spicy sauce.\n\nThe place itself is very simple. About 6-8 tables, a flatscreen TV, one cook and one waitress. The place is so small that I kept wondering where they put their ingredients. \n\nThe bill came, $20! We couldn't have been happier."

The server that we had was not the one we were used to. Initially, she was helpful despite the language barrier. When our dishes arrived, it was not what my mother indicated to her. She then became defensive and stated that it wasn't her fault that my mother did not accurately specify what she wanted. \n\nMom sent back the soup which she never touched and the server gave her a hard time. The server never came back afterwards to ask us if everything was okay. In fact, it was the crew member who brought my mother the redone soup and gave us the same \"it's not our fault speech\" when we asked her questions. Mom told me that the soup did not taste like what she had the last time that she went. She suspects that it was the same soup with different garnishes.\n\nThe salad that I ordered tasted fresh and fine, but was missing ingredients that I am used to seeing such as galangal, lemongrass and thai chilies. Instead, I got a sliver of jalapeno pepper and saw that they use bottled lemon juice in the kitchen. In other words, they are charging the same prices, while shortchanging the customer on authenticity. FYI, they do not make their curries in house; they use a curry mix as per their own admission.\n\nI was going to order dessert, but changed my mind after the latter. When it came time to check out, the server ignored me refused to give me the ticket. As a matter of fact, she looked angry and had a stone face while looking sideways. The crew member was the one who checked us out and tried to diffuse the tension. We did nothing to deserve such undignified treatment.\n\nConsequently, we left no tip and will never ever be back there!"

I had mongolian beef with rice and loved it.  My parents had the same and gave it a thumbs up as well.  Three others had variations of the pad thai noodles and said their food was really good. I recommend this place for good eating and saving money.  It's not fancy so don't go in expecting something formal.  The waitresses were attentive and the service was excellent.

You can choose the spice level of your noodles which might be puzzling because it's between 1-10 and a little description of each level would be helpful. The refreshing Tom Kha Khai soup selection was interesting because this tangy potion is typically served in a big silver pot complete with flames but you can also order it by the bowl which I did. \n\nThere's also this interesting mural on their wall that is Vegas-themed.

We ordered padthai, pad see ew, tom Kah soup and papaya salad. They were all very cheap and nicely cooked. In LA, you normally have to pay $10-12 for padthai and they are not even as good. So I was more than happy about this place."

I'm eating it right now.  Literally.  Eating... chew, chew, chew... right now.  \n\nThe shrimp fried rice is pretty flavorful as well.  No soy sauce or other crap is needed.  I got a fried egg on top.  Get that as well.  The egg yolk is the best sauce you can get.  Ever.  Ever ever.\n\nWe also ordered Tom Yum.  I haven't eaten that.  I'm still eating the duck curry.  I also have some edemame sitting here.\n\nAll in all, we spent $30 + $4 in tip.  For what amounts to 2 meals for 2 people, I don't see how this COULDN'T be a good deal."

When I'm craving Thai, I go to this hole-in-the-wall tucked away in Chinatown Plaza. There's never a line and the food comes out expeditiously. There's actually four locations in Vegas and they even deliver. The menu has your basic curries, noodles, and rice dishes along with some chef's specials. Their Thai noodle soup is unique and the large chicken or seafood Tom Yum can serve even as an entree. Best of all, most, if not, all of their dishes are around $6-8, making for a much more affordable meal than Lotus. My one complaint from my last visit was their mango sweet sticky rice, which was less than par. The waitress warned me that the mango wasn't ripe and sweet quite yet, but the problem was with the very under cooked sticky rice. In any case, can't hate too much for a take-out restaurant."

They aren't bringing in drive by traffic, the signage isn't great, and you park in the delivery alley, but the crowd packed in (and sometimes waiting) at lunch speaks volumes of the food and value.\n\nThe chicken larb, my husband's favorite, is top notch ($6.95). It wan't served traditionally with a cabbage wedge, but rather with chopped iceberg. Though this is a little unconventional, I liked the salad quality of the dish. The green curry fried rice ($7.95) is filled with fresh veggies and tender slices of pork, and has a slightly creamy quality. If there was risotto in Thailand, this would be it. I also enjoyed the Choo Chee Shrimp ($8.95) and Spicy Green Beans with silky chicken ($6.75). The Beef Noodle Soup ($6.50) had an exotic favor sweetened by spices, though the beef itself wasn't as tender as I would have liked.\n\nEverything on the menu is so inexpensive you won't worry about looking at the lunch special menu, but if you are dining alone or just not a \"sharing\" kind of eater, these options will allow you to try several different item combinations for under $7.\n\nDownside: If the place is very busy, it takes awhile to get your food. The servers are attentive and polite, however, so there is comfort in knowing it isn't taking forever because the staff is slacking off. My suggestion is to avoid peak times, or order take-out."

But Overrall the flavor was just right!! My huband got the Thai boat noodles. It was good. Good came fast after ordering it. When we walked in about 12 all the tables were taken but one near the door. As we sat there the server took quiet sometime getting our drink orders and food order. When the food came out we still didn't get out drink or forks and spoons.. I think they can work on their service skills.. I can't wait to go back for their food. And their prices were so reasonable for a Thai restaurant!"

Which is cool if you need some porn to read over lunch, I guess, but annoying if you're just hungry.  The map shown here is correct (why didn't I just trust Yelp??) - it's two doors down from Veggie Delight.\n\nSo, yes, they are very accommodating with the vegetarian/vegan requests and happy to oblige.  I went at lunch, but ordered off the dinner menu.  Now, this may have been a mistake simply because they have an awesome lunch special! You can choose an appetizer (fried tofu, soup, or spring roll, I believe - the fried tofu looked awesome!) and one entree (~$5.45) or two (~$7.25).  That's a lot of food for cheap!\n\nWe shared a papaya salad, green curry with tofu and vegetables, and chili basil fried rice with tofu and veg.  We ordered everything a 7 out of 10 spicy, and it was perfect (I do like pretty spicy food!).  First, let me give these folks some love for NOT putting the much-maligned baby corn in any of our food.  The mere appearance of those mutants is always a buzzkill when I'm about to dig into a dish.  Second, the portions were very generous.  I'm a hearty eater as is my friend, and we had enough leftovers for at least one of us to stuff ourselves again.  Third, everything was very tasty.  Maybe not the best I've ever had, but delicious enough for me to eat til I hurt.  Four, the prices! Cheeeeeaaaaaaaap! $6.95 for a huge entree? yes please!\n\nThe ambiance was nil, but the service was friendly and fast, and I don't got to a tiny Thai place for lunch because of the ambiance.  This place is definitely going in the rotation, and next time hopefully I won't forget to order brown rice!"

They use Tomyum as the soup base which they barely dilute it for the noodle soup. Unlike other places where they always dilute the soup base and you don't even taste any favor, you are almost having a real Tomyum soup here. It comes with dinced pork, fish ball, shrimp, and fish cake etc. They were all perfectly cooked! \n\nThis time we also ordered the dumplings as an appetizer. They were ordinary but delicious! They put a bit of spicy mayonnaise on top (most likely siracha mixed with mayo) and that gives the perfect kick to the dish. \n\nAsian food is known to be cheaper but this is extremely reasonably priced with very high quality. It deserves 6 stars!"

The dish has the perfect amount of onions and chicken and rice and seasonings. This dish is enough for two people or two meals for one (which is what I do).\n\nI would also recommend #38, which is sorta like pan fried noodles with bean sprouts and a sweet/spicy sauce.\n\nI've never had the Thai iced tea but it's a nice orange color and from what I hear, it's pretty good if you're looking for a cool refreshing drink.\n\nIt's a very small, quick and inexpensive lunch if you're looking for something new.

They have multiple locations, however, the chef at this location is our favorite! The portions are generous and the flavor is always on point. The ambiance is dive-y and at times the service may seem scattered, but this place stays busy since the food is En-Thai-cing! For lazy weekend nights, we always order take-out from this place without a second thought. The Appe-Thai-zing food keeps us coming back!\n\nItems we tried:\n\n* Beef pad see ew $6.95 - Really juicy! We order this dish every single time we dine here and it's always delicious! They're very generous with the wide noodles. The sauce is an explosion of flavor, mixed with lots of Chinese broccoli, fluffy egg soaked in all of that tasty sauce and nice amount of tender beef. Everything is cooked expertly! Rated: 5/5\n\n* Green curry chicken fried rice $7.95 - This is another dish we can't get enough of! A flavor bomb of deliciousness! The spices and green curry flavor comes through strong, very aromatic. There are long beans added for texture, bamboo shoots, basil, carrots and green bell pepper. We're always satisfied with the flavor of this dish! Rated: 5/5\n\n* Panang avocado $8.95 - This is my first time trying avocado in of a warm curry and let me tell you, it works, very well! The perfectly ripe avocado is added like a garnish at the very end when serving, so it doesn't really get cooked. It adds such a wonderful silky and buttery texture to the curry! I'm a huge fan! Rated: 5/5\n \n* Combo Appetizer sampler $8.95 - It comes with 1 eggroll, 2 crab Rangoon, 2 fried shrimp, 2 fried wonton, 2 chicken satay, 2 fried tofu. It's a good-sized starter for 2 people, maybe 3. I enjoy the Rangoon and also the fried tofu is fried to crispy perfection. I love their house made sauces that's served with the appetizer, there's a peanut and a sweet and sour sauce one; I want to dip everything in them! Rated: 3/5\n\n* Papaya salad $6.50 - It's a traditional spicy and sour salad made from shredded unripe papaya mixed with long beans, tomato, toasted and crushed peanuts and served with a side of cabbage. You can pick your spice level when you order. The flavor was balanced and the spice level was perfect. I really loved their version, but I felt the portion was small. Rated: 4/5\n\n* Pad ped snapper $8.95 (Thai curry stir fried with crispy red snapper mixed with bamboo, bell, young pepper seed, basil and baby corn) - The red snapper filets weren't too crispy and might be from the frozen section of the market, but the sauce is where it's at! The caramel sauce was packed with deep flavor, it was hard not to like this dish. I just wish they were more generous with the sauce, pouring it over rice was awesome! Rated: 3/5\n\n* Pad Thai $6.95 - Their version here will do just fine, but it's not my favorite. I feel that the sauce is lacking much needed, bold tamarind flavor. Usually it tastes like it's missing something. Rated: 3/5\n\n* S11 guay-teaiw-loard $8.25 (Chicken, shrimp, squid, tofu, mushroom, with black soy sauce served over steamed flat noodle and bean sprouts)  - The wide noodles are always a favorite, but the salty and sweet soy gravy was very potent and almost killed the palate. There was a prominent ginger aroma and flavor throughout the dish. However, the overwhelming amount of bean sprouts and the protein was unidentifiable, making this dish unexciting. Rated: 2/5\n\n*PRO TIP* add fried or soft tofu to any of these dishes to add some more protein and another dimension of texture! So good!"

I must say... This is the same restaurant but the quality n quantity is different. The curry was bland n watery and the Thai tea tasted like water down milk. Although this location gives you a bigger portion the quality of the food was not up to par w their sister location... So if you want QUALITY OVER QUANTITY visit their other location on fort apache."

But since we're all grown now, she doesn't make huge family style meals anymore. So. This is my go to Thai restaurant.\n\n\nIt's not fancy, it's not over priced, it's not a new take on Thai. It's pretty much the classics done simply and executed well. Plus the price is definitely right. I'm pretty sure nothing is over $10..I think.. Well..  maybe! If you do seafood it might be.\n\nMy favorites are definitely the same as most yelpers:\n\nNoodle house style pot stickers are always a good start.\n\nNoodle house Tom yum soup with choice of noodles which I get the fat noodles- spice a 10.\n\nMy favorites include: Roasted duck curry 75% of the time, duck Fried rice(ask for chili in it and it makes it even better), the roasted duck soup with egg noodles, fried chicken over fried rice, BBQ park and Chinese sausage fried rice, lad nah, grilled beef salad with a side of sticky rice, their version of pho lol, Tom kah kai, and pretty much everything on their menu.\n\nIt's all really good.\n\nMy only let down was the pork wonton soup I got tonight with egg noodles. Fresh, but a  pretty bland broth.\n\nA huge plus is they can make their papaya salad LAOS style, which I prefer, and it's actually really good :] \n\nWith Ling Ling as the best server ever and down to the padak on the table as a condiment, this place is pretty authentic and never disappoints me. \n\nIdk if this is for regulars but the service is always super sweet. If I don't finish something for ANY reason I.e. Being full or saving for later.. The Ling Ling always asks if i enjoyed it or if I need it replaced if I may not have liked it. So nice :]\n\nIt's tiny so expect a tiny wait at times, the food is worth it, and try not to sit in that center table when it's sunny..\n\nRandom thought:\n\nMy favorite thing about eating a Thai meal is that it's usually family style. I wish they had an options of ordering a bowl or pot of some of the dishes.. If that makes any sense :] but I'm sure there's a reason they dont offer that. Limited table space..?"

Here is the chronology of what happened:\n\nWe initially went to Pam Real Thai just a mile over based on the review.  Looked really interesting, but alas, it was closed because they were only open for dinner.  So we looked up this place on Yelp and decided to head over.  First impression good, there were a couple of party waiting outside for a table for this small joint.  About 100 degrees outside so not too pleasant, but looking forward to the food.  We put our name in for 2, but there was a party of 9 in front that they said would need to be seated first.  No problem.  We wait about 10 minutes, and the big party goes in to get seated.  In the meantime there were a couple other small parties that came around, but we didn't pay attention too much.  Another big party of 8 comes, puts their name in, and waits.  10 minutes or so later, the party of 8 goes in!  I go inside to check out what's going on, and the small parties that came after us are also seated already!  So I go over to the counter and ask them when we were going to get seated, they look at the \"wait list\" and our name is still on it, with people below us crossed out!  What the heck?  They realize, say \"oh\", and says, \"sit over there\" and points to the empty table.  No apologies, just a point of a finger.  Man, food must be really good here to tolerate this, I thought.  We later witness that there is another party getting a similar treatment so notching this one as an inefficient system that has got to get fixed.\n\nService does not improve as the meal goes on, however.  We flag the server down to order our drinks and food, never got served water, and they never checked up on us for the meal.  Onto the meal.  We ordered a Thai Iced Tea, Thai Iced Coffee (no difference as Vietnamese one), Yellow Curry, and Spicy Fried Rice.  In general, everything was good.  But both the curry and rice was too salty.  The dishes were plain, no garnishments, and smaller in size to justify the cheaper price.  So not necessarily a bargain.  Tea was good, no complaints, coffee was typical.  So overall 3-stars for the meal.  If it wasn't so salty, the curry would have been great.\n\nSo throughout the meal, the servers never approached us, we called them EVERY TIME.  To order, to ask for anything, to ask for the check.  That gets a zero in my book and I let the tip speak for that.  I pay for the food, I tip for the service.  Servers should always remember that, I don't care what you get paid.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  They had lone diners, so it is fine.  Whether they can accommodate you..."

Their menu is actually a mix between Chinese and Thai food.  \n\nIt was really disappointing to open the menu and see things like Orange Chicken on the menu.  Really?  Really?!  They don't even have basic Thai appetizers such as angel wings or fish patties.  We were actually debating to leave the place without ordering because it did not have a lot of Thai dishes, but the employees were too nice so I decided to stay.\n\nWe ordered two dishes (because there really wasn't anything else on the menu that sounded Thai, nor appetizing) -- Boat Noodle Soup and Chicken Basil.  The noodle soup had a good flavor, but they did DUMB IT DOWN BIG TIME for vegas locals.  They did NOT have the pork rinds, blood, lliver, and tripe that a boat noodle soup usually has.  The broth was really sweet too, which was overpowering until I added my own chili flakes to balance the flavors.  \n\nThe chicken basil was ok tasting, but wasn't great.  The place definitely dumbed down the spice factor too -- considering we requested \"medium\" for both dishes, the dishes were NOT spicy at all.  Again, I think this place is catering towards a clientele that can't handle much spicy food nor distinguish between Chinese and Thai food. \n\nMy bf pointed out their water is filtered, which is a good thing, and that they \"flavor\" their water with slices of lemons and oranges in the water pitcher.  Just fyi for those picky water drinkers out there.  This also tells me that their soups, most likely, have a better taste because the water is filtered.\n\nI would only come here again when I'm craving (semi) Asian food in Vegas and  cause it's cheap -- for two dishes it was only $14."

I looked all over for my review of the place confirming whether or not I had been, and lo and behold, I find it in my \"Unfinished Reviews\" section.  So, here it is...finally.\n\nThai Style Noodle House offers both Chinese and Thai food, but mostly Thai.  Our party of four ordered a few dishes to share so we could sample a bit of everything.\n\n* Beef / Pork Jerky \"Beef / pork marinated in special Thai herb, dried in one sun and deep fried\" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband is the real expert on this since he tends to get it a lot.  I found it to be just okay though, it was a bit too dry for me.  (Whereas other places make their variation a bit more moist.)\n\n* Grill (Chicken, Pork, or Beef) Salad \"Your choice of sliced meat cooked with red and green onions, mint leaves, ground roasted rice, chili, and lime dressing.\" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband loved it.  I thought it was just okay and lacked something - a bit more sauce and zest would have been nice.  Then again, this is something that the Husband has had a lot of.\n\n* Roasted Duck Noodle Soup \"Noodle with boneless sliced roasted duck and Yao Choy in Thai herb duck broth.\" ($6.95) - This wasn't my top choice to order, and it was just okay.  There was nothing special about the roast duck at all.\n\n* Pad See-eu \"Stir fried flat rice noodle and egg, Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce.\" ($6.75) - This was okay with chicken and greens, although it was a bit flat.\n\n* Red Curry \"Thai red curry with your choice of chicken, pork, beef mixed with bell pepper, bamboo shoot and basil served over steamed rice.\" ($6.75) - We chose vegetarian with soft tofu and I'm always a big fan of Thai curries.  They didn't disappoint here - good flavor and spice.  This was the real winner for me and I definitely would be back to try out their other curries.\n\nWe also had Thai iced teas all around.\n\n* Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice ($3.50)\n\n* Fried Ice Cream ($3.50) - It had a nice crunchy batter with little ruby-like things in condense milk.\n\nThings I do appreciate about Thai Style Noodle House is that there are a lot of vegan and vegetarian choices, and they don't charge for brown rice.  I also like when they offer you a choice on the tofu - soft or fried.\n\nService - it was busy the evening we went and with one waitress, she was kept on her toes.  She was friendly and on the top of her game, but then again, Bobby Y. (a regular) was dining with us.  So I think that may have helped us there.\n\n3.5 stars\n\n(I'm confident that I would give them a four star if I go back and try out their other curry dishes.  But since I've been having them at their Fort Apache location, I can definitely say their curries are yum!)"

I was left with a bitter taste of Thai. \n\n I will most definitely not be recommending this little place. I'm sorry I have to do this but it's just not possible to find anything positive. They use the cheapest/inexpensive quality of meats and its really visible and tasteless. \n\nI always love to have Thai ice tea in every Thai restaurant I visit, and that wasn't even a great taste. I had to request a different drink something that didn't taste like soap :( yes my ice tea tasted like soap! 0:\n\nThe customer service was not really good. I wish they would be more helpful in recommending dishes and so on. Anyhow I have an idea of what I wanted but they didn't provide most of the Thai dishes so, I had to order similar ones that didn't come close to taste nor the look of it all.  \n\nNot a fan :/"

My family and I were on a trip to the Grand Canyon and decided to make a pit stop in Vegas (it just seemed like the sensible thing to do, of course). Having been on the road for 5 hours that day, we refused to settle for any Chipotle or other fast-food restaurant, but we weren't in the mood to drop big bucks at a Vegas buffet. Yelp came to the rescue, and we found this gem of a restaurant in Chinatown! First of all - SO MANY OPTIONS! It took us a while to figure out what we wanted. We decided on the the yellow curry, green curry friend rice, thai spice noodles, and red curry, all of which were exquisite! It was truly addicting, with not a spice out of place. The hospitality was great, and our waiter was keen to give her recommendations and craft her suggestions based on our dietary restrictions. When we got the bill, we were shocked at how unbelievably reasonable the whole meal was. Trust me - this is one Vegas decision you will not regret!"

Now in order to makesure we like something they bring us,  we order a ton of food like crazy. MAJOR NOTE: WHEN YOU SAY SPICY, THEY HEAR BURN BUTT SPICY. ORDER SPICY CAUTIOUSLY. \n\n1. Potstickers - Pretty good, although a little salty. \n2. BBQ Pork Wonton Soup - Very tasty, surprisingly our favorite. \n3. Mongolian Beef - Good, sauce was a little runny and light flavor, but essentially good. \n4. Orange Chicken - flavor good, but more batter than chicken, although it is really cheap so we really can't complain too much. \n5. Spicy Basil Leaf - This is a version of my favorite dish, called other places Chili Mint chicken. At first it was so salty I couldn't eat it, but then I poured 1/2 a cup of the broth from our soup over the dish and it was perfect!! \n6. Fried Banana's and vanilla ice cream - very yummy. \n\nSo all of this food plus 3 Sprites cost us a whopping $44.00, and mind you the dish sizes were huge, most of the plates were still full. \n\nSo all in all, a great hole in the wall Thai place, even though the chef is very heavy handed with the salt and chili."

Once I got to my room at 9:00pm, the last thing I wanted to do was go back to the valet to get my car, or walk around the strip to find a place to eat because that would have taken time and I would have been hungry, cranky, starving and grumpy at 10:00pm while walking/driving around aimlessly trying to find a restaurant.\n\nHere comes yelp to save the day. At this point, I don't care who brings me food. There were some bad reviews but like I said, at this point in the evening, with hungry kids in the hotel room, who cares. So we placed our order over the phone and waited...\n\nThey only deliver to the front valet drop-off area probably because they don't want to take the time to park and navigate the hotel to find your room. That's understandable. The delivery guy called when he was 5 minutes away. We were already waiting downstairs but that was a nice gesture to make things run as efficiently as possible. We expected a guy to roll up and toss us the food through the window but he didn't do that. We were focused on the cars and didn't even spot him until we realized there's a guy standing on the sidewalk across from us holding bags of food. \n\nWe ordered the fried calamari, orange chicken with sauce on the side, wonton soup, wonton noodle soup, pad Thai, panang beef, crab fried rice, and extra steamed rice. The portions were generous, prices were reasonable, quality and taste were average. It was exactly an hour when the food arrived. I timed the exact moment we called in the order. I think that was pretty quick considering they had to make the food, package it, and drive it to us, all within that time frame. We forgot to ask for plates and they didn't ask us either. The only disappointment is that I expected lots of crab meat in the crab fried rice similar to OSHA Thai or at least some lump crab pieces but instead it was just fried rice topped with a scrambled egg/crab mixture. It also lacked the aromatic crabby smell which I love but overall, it did the job. It fed our starving party of 6 dinner in our hotel room and we still had enough leftover for a breakfast snack the next morning."

I remember when there would be a line around the corner of the restaurant, now you can just walk in and choose from the many table available. This place has NEVER had good service, they want you to come in, eat quickly and leave. But people didn't care because the food WAS really good. WAS. There special potstickers are amazing because there are no other restaurants that can emulate it and it's one dish that is still decent. However, I used to come here all the time for Duck Fried Rice and Duck Noodle Soup, but every time I come back, the quality of the duck is terrible and it keeps getting worst. The duck used to be super moist and delicious to eat, but now its super hard, dry and tough to eat and it really takes away from the whole dish itself. Now, I also stopped by to order a Shrimp Fried Rice togo and I was disappointed to open the box that wasn't even half full.....I paid full price for not even half a dish. Not only was it half empty, but there was only 4 shrimps. This place has terrible service, but the food is the only thing that gets people to come back, if the quality of the food keeps going down, people are gonna stop coming. It's a shame because they have very unique recipes for their food, they should do these recipes some justice and make them correctly will fresh ingredients."

The food has always been excellent. I recommend the chicken noodle soup with thin noodles or the chicken pad thai.\n\nTHE MOST ANNOYING thing of this particular restaurant is that they have a Lunch SPECIALS MENU but never say anything and don't tell you about it. They keep it hidden and you have to ask for it every time and when you do they seem upset you asked. It's as if they make commission on lunch sales or something. It make me feel like they would rather have you pay full price for your meal. \n\n\nI don't know if they read these reviews, but here's an idea, include your lunch special menu into you main menu, like every other place, it's good advertisement to get your dinner crowds to come in at lunch time."

I went here 2 times order 4 different kind of foods and its all good. That my friend must be considered superb. Small and efficient. kind of hard to find if you come here the first time, cos its hidden. But its super good and affordable.\n\nCheap, great food and nothing else. Great service, they got the palm juiced and you know what, if you like spicy and you dont know what you should have, get the gway teow lord.!!"

Then I had the beef Pad See Ew, which was decent.\n\nOne tip for folks looking for looking for something different, this place is located in a strip mall that is crammed with Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai and Korean restaurant.

We initially tried to go to Lotus of Siam, which is our favorite, but didn't want to wait 45 minutes to eat so we kept going to Thai Noodle. The location is small with maybe ten tables or so. Service is good. I had the Panang salmon avocado which came with rice, I think it was around $10. Ordered it medium spicy, which was really not spicy for me, but it was delicious. I wouldn't initially think hot avocado as something I would like but it works really well in this dish.  I love that they give you a lot of sauce to because I like soaking the sauce up with the rice. Also, the salmon was a pretty decent size, 3 pieces maybe 1 1/2 inches by 3 inches or so, I was very full by the time we were done. We also had the combo appetizer platter, the satay was good and the food on the app was tasty but most of it was fried so I probably would opt for the pot stickers next time. If you are looking for a good Lotus alternative I would definitely keep this in mind."

THIS IS THE BRANCH TO GO TO-- DO NOT GO TO THE ONE ON FORT APACHE. While the one on Fort Apache is the same owner, it's not the same chef and the food DOES NOT taste the same. This is the original branch and the cooking is SUPERIOR.\n\nThis is a hole in the wall Thai restaurant that's authentic to the point you can see a Thai grandma in the kitchen whipping up your dishes. Everything is so frigging cheap ($5-7 a plate) so I recommend you come with friends so you can eat family style and try a little bit of everything. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is ghetto, so ghetto that I have to warn people ahead of time and assure them that the food is worth it. This is a place you come strictly for flavor.\n\nThings to order:\nDuck curry - slices of duck in a red curry served with a side of white rice. Delicious. Amazing. This dish makes me so sad I live in Los Angeles. The curry is rich and flavorful, the slices of duck are juicy and tender, and it all just melts so well in your mouth. It's a mouthgasm.\n\nThe pineapple fried rice- HUGE chunks of pineapple and whatever meat you choose (I like chicken with this dish). It's prepared correctly in that the rice isn't dry. This dish has nuts in it so if you're allergic, beware.\n\nThe pad see ew - It's a bit sweeter here than in other places, but I prefer that. I choose beef. Once again, it's done well.\n\nThe pad thai - Delicious.\n\nGet my drift? Parking is plentiful, and the service is just fine (cute thai ladies who can't speak English well)\n\nHonestly, just call ahead and pick up your order so you can skip the crowd. You need to try this place. A+++++"

Don't get me wrong, our tastebuds were overjoyed from all the flavor. But is all that flavoring really necessary? I guess that's how some people like their food cooked though; it's just not for us. I think it would've been perfect had they just cut back on all the oil and soy sauce and even left out the msg.\n\n2) Vegetable Stir-fry--Half of our stir-fry dish was made up with rice. They gave us the tiniest portion of vegetables. Like the fried rice, I felt like the stir-fry was just cooked in a ton of hoisin sauce/msg/soy sauce/salt.\n\n3) Thai Iced Coffee--Too sweet! I think they added sugar on top of the condensed milk because that was the sweetest iced coffee I have ever had.\n\nService was decent.

The first thing you notice when you walk in us that is smells like bad breath! Eeeew! Should have been our first red flag!\n\nWe were a party of four on a Thursday afternoon and the place is small and crowded. Waited for a hostess to seat us and was told 10 minutes to wait for a table when they clearly had a clean table for four ready in the back corner. It was very awkward standing in the doorway as people came in and others left. A waitress gave us menus to look at while we stood in the entry way. About the same time a single man (who came in after us) was seated at the table for four that I mentioned earlier. WTF. Really?!?! \n\nWe waited and were finally seated. The menu was greasy and had lots of misprints and old prices scribbled out with new prices written in. Not very professional or appetizing. \n\nThe waitress was rude, slow and acted like our request for a side dish and chop sticks was a big inconvenience. The food was basic and boring. No real flavor. Who the hell serves mayonnaise on potstickers??? The Pad Thai was a small portion and half of my plate was just a huge handful of bean sprouts. The dish does not come with rice here, like it does in every other Thai restaurant in the world. Skimpy. \n\nI do not recommend this place to anyone based off of my experience today. We won't be back. So many other places nearby that truly respect their customers and deserve repeat business! Yuck!"

Since I have been to Volcano before, they are really good if you ask me. The place is small, walked in looked @ the menu, and decided on the larb beef salad. Total with tax was 7.55. I had Larb Salad before @ this place in Austin Tx. and it was to die for. but this salad was pretty small for 7$, and very plane tasting. It had a decent size of meat in there compared to the rest of the salad but for 7$ they could ad more veggies @ least. Veggies aren't that expensive, and put better dressing or something. I doubt I will be back here. Total loss 8.55 cause I tipped the waiter. They waiter filled my water, n it's not his fault the food sucks. The people there where decently nice. IDK maybe I'm just a picky eater compared to the rest of Vegas, in my opinion good food in VEgas is VERY hard to find unless your spending 50$ @ a fancy casino buffet. Which is why I usually cook @ home cause I can't find what I want else where. Austin Tx. and Los Angles have much better food. Good thing I am moving to LA June 1st."

When we walked in the door, the hostess said, \"We close in 20 minutes, and the kitchen closes in 8, so do you know what you want to eat? Because otherwise....\" \n\nWe were hungry, so we quickly figured it out! My friend had the duck fried rice, I had seafood pad thai, and we had calamari as an appetizer. I liked the calamari, it was meaty and piping hot, but didn't have a lot of spice or kick to it. A little sauce fixed that up, though.\n\nMy friend's duck fried rice was delicious! I had food envy for sure, but restricted myself to only one bite. If I go back, I'll definitely get more of that! My seafood pad thai was also good, but again, not much kick. That was my fault for not ordering higher on the spice level. \n\nWe were seated at a rickety corner table. This isn't a fancy place by any stretch, but if you know that going in, you'll be fine. Of course, the service was a bit on the brusque side for us, but perhaps if we'd come in a little sooner, it would have been a bit more relaxed."

I have been looking for some good Thai food, so I decided I would try this place out after reading a lot of the stellar reviews on it. \n\nI will dare say that this place is the next best thing to eating in Thailand, & I know because I have been there more than a few times ;) \n\nI had the chicken noodle soup with a combo of flat & egg noodles, which is just as good as you can get from the best street vendors in Thailand! The broth was definitely very flavorful & they give you all the great condiments to go with it. The sliced peppers in vinegar are awesome! However, it could have used a little more sprouts, cilantro & green onions in the soup. That would be my only request :) \n\nThat is the best part about the street vendors, everything on their carts are fresh & plentiful & you can add as much & whatever you like & as many noodle combinations as you want in your soup. \n\nMy date du jour had the pineapple fried rice & from the look on her face & her comments, she really enjoyed it. After we finished the main course, we decided to split the fried bananas with ice cream & drizzled with honey. WOW!! That delicious little dish is what earned that 5th star :D \n\nI also ordered some pork chow mein to take home with me, cuz I gots to have my noodles! I F**K's with them noodles! I F**K's with them hard!! I have to say, it wasn't bad. \n\nOverall, I would totally recommend this place. The seating is pretty limited & close enough quarters that you can hear every ones conversations :P The decor is almost nonexistent, but who cares, it's a great little spot to enjoy some great food. The wait staff is outstanding in my opinion, very pleasant & helpful. I will definitely be a regular at this place & will not mind the 15-20 minute drive whatsoever ;)"

I tried a taste of it for the first time and it wasn't for me. It did have a good balance of sour and not sour though. \n\nCrab Fried Rice: Really good. Trust me on this one! I will order this one again. If you like dry fried rice instead of sticky this is for you. \n\nSpicy Flat Noodles: It was I expected, but very good! Flat noodles are by far my favorite kind of noodle.\n\nDuck Fried Rice: I wanted to soooo badly love this dish, but it was just too sweet for me. It was cooked with pineapple, and the duck they added was fatty. By no means does fatty mean bad, but it's not for everyone. Wouldn't order this one again. \n\nOverall, I would go back for a bite to eat. Can't beat price, food, and atmosphere. Will have to show my parents when the come visit. :)"

So what's the difference between my first experience and today's? \n\nI came here with another friend of mine who was really craving some duck. I suggested he try the Roasted Duck Noodle Soup with vermicelli noodles, which was what I ordered on my last visit. As for me I decided to try the Choo Chee Shrimp Curry. We also split an order of N.H. Style Pot Stickers. \n\nN.H. Style Pot Stickers: These remind me of some kind sushi roll for some reason, and I think it's because of the sauce they drizzle over the pot stickers; it's like a soy sauce spicy mayo combo. If I'm not mistaken, there's ground pork and chopped green onions in the pot stickers. Not sure about its contents, since we were so hungry we dove right in once the waitress placed the plate on our table; I just remember looking at my pot sticker briefly, then shoving it into my mouth -- I'll be more observant the next time.\n\nChoo Chee Shrimp Curry: Mmm, I thought this one was delicious, and so did my friend. I'm not an expert on Thai food, but from what Google has told me Choo Chee curry is essentially a thicker type of red curry that's used with seafood. The curry was a little spicy and could've needed just a tad bit more spiciness, but it's just as delicious as is. \n\nRoasted Duck Soup: My friend wasn't too crazy about the soup as much as I was the first time around, and he thought it was just OK. Considering how he's knowledgeable about meat and seafood, he explained to me how he didn't like how the duck was prepared. Though I'm only an expert at eating duck and  seafood, I agree that the duck could've been better. The meat looked like it was torn perfunctorily then thrown into the bowl. There also wasn't enough meat. I also mentioned this in my previous review. There were only a few shreds of meat and some skin that floated around the bowl. C'mon, Thai Style Noodle House, can't you do a little better with presentation and quality? Perhaps I'm just being picky..\n\nI'm still a fan of this place, and I do look forward to trying some of their other dishes. Maybe I'll give eating duck from here a break."

Last week I decided to give it another shot and ordered two other Yelp review favorites, the Papaya Salad and Duck Fried Rice.  My thought was I'd counter the unhealthy fried rice with the papaya salad and maybe eat half of each.   The best laid plans of mice and fat men....\n\nWent and picked them up (service both times seemed a little rushed, but not unfriendly).   Prices are pretty standard. \n\n Upon getting back to my office I went for the salad first.  I thought it looked really nice, but I didn't enjoy the flavor at all.  Now it must be said for the 50th time how much I typically do not like salad so maybe it's personal, but I found the bean sprouts in particular to have that dirt taste that they sometimes get.   Or is this the way bean sprouts are supposed to taste?  I love them cooked usually, but maybe raw they taste like dirt.  I didn't get any sweetness from the papaya and I ordered a 7/10 and wasn't getting much spice either.  Maybe I was eating it wrong.  Either way, YELP YOU FAILED ME ON THIS ONE.\n\nBut redemption comes in the form of Duck Fried Rice.  Holy Moly.  Toss that silly salad aside and dig in.  Now it doesnt seem too complicated:  take greasy fried rice, add a healthy amount of unhealthy, fatty duck and voila!  A star is born and a salad is forgotten.   Yeah that half and half plan earlier?  Chucked it in the trash along with the salad, and devoured the entire box of fried rice.  Cancel Dr's appointment for tomorrow and call it a day.\n\nDuck fried rice - 5 stars.  Papaya salad - 1 star.   5+1/2 = 3.   I can do Arithmetic like Bill Clinton."

Upon entering the establishment at 11:30am....not even peak lunch hour...only one table was left.  The menu is extensive with the typical curries/fried noodles/fried rice/chef specialties...and a separate green menu with lunch specials. I decided to try the duck noodle soup with vermicelli upon a friends recommendation...think Vietnamese pho mating with Chinese wonton soup....and voila thai noodle soup (sliced duck, bok choy, bean sprouts, cilantro swimming in a herbal duck broth).   There are four noodle options (vermicelli, egg noodle, rice noodle, wide rice noodle) to pick from. The menu seems very extensive and it helps that the people working there are actually Thai.  The prices are very reasonable...under $7 for most dishes.   \n\nBut be aware small establishment means you may end up waiting for a table...and after waiting for a table...waiting for your food to come out.  Service was extremely slow today and refills of water need to be requested.  The servers were friendly, but just extremely busy.  I would definitely try this place again....as a heads up I was informed the sliced beef noodle soup may be even better than the duck noodle soup."

The tables are very close and some ladies were seated next to us and it felt like they were actually AT my table. That wouldn't be a big deal if they were nice people.

If you have a car or are not afraid to venture off the strip for some cheap, good eats, this is the spot to go!\n\nIt was a lenten friday on our vacation, so we were on the search for some seafood.  We didn't feel like paying $30 for a buffet or eating some fried fish sandwich from a fast food joint, so one of us came up with the great idea to have some Thai food.  Yelp to the rescue!\n\nWe were about a mile from this place, and a 4.5 star average?  We can't lose.  And we definitely did not.  We started off by sharing the seafood tom yum soup, which was delicious.  It had shrimps, mussels, squid, and fish balls.  We ordered it medium, but would have definitely been ok with mild, as we were all dripping in sweat by the time we took our 2nd and 3rd bites.  For my entree, I went with the green curry with shrimp.  I wish there was more shrimp, but the food itself was very well prepared and tasted great.  \n\nOther entrees on my table were pad thai, 5 spiced (?) salmon, and some other fried red curry salmon.  It was meat-less friday remember?  haha  All of us had nothing but positives to say about our dishes.  And, all the dishes were less than $10.  Score!\n\nThe service here is excellent as well.  Seeing our sweat soaked faces, the waitresses were quick to refill our waters and even put the fan next to us.  Lol.  I have never been anywhere that would actually do that for you.  haha\n\nParking is a bit weird here.  I did not see a parking lot, except for the one across the street, so we had to play frogger in Las Vegas chinatown, which was another adventure in itself.  \n\nOverall, food is excellent and I will be back."

Too bad for me...I love super spicy food.  Anyway, both items tasted pretty good.  I was eating hungover, and usually I don't really eat when hungover.  It somewhat curbed my hungover.

Luckily he doesn't like onions so I ate them all and even snuck in a piece of tofu that was really yummy. \n\nFor dessert I usually get mangoes with sticky rice, but this time we went for the fried bananas; a little too greasy for my taste, but wonderfully paired with the ice cream and honey.\n\nI would go here again and I would recommend it to someone who wanted chinese/thai that was cheap and off the strip."

The people there were pretty friendly and I tried to order what got the most press on Yelp.\n\nMy wife thought the pad thai was pretty good, but I got the crab fried rice and it lacked a bit of taste. I put a ton of hot sauce on it and it killed my appetite because I was starving, but I wasn't impressed. \n\nThe mango sticky rice was pretty good. The rice was salty and the mango was sweet. This was the request of my wife's so I honored it. It wasn't bad and the prices were decent based on what you got, but I can't give it 4 stars because of taste.\n\nIt is a good find and maybe if I got something else I would be happier. They feature the hot soup, but when it's 115 degrees outside soup is the last thing you want."

So I stopped by this place to see what the fuzz was all about.\n\nThere were many selections of Thai food and that was the only good thing I found. \nI ordered Pad Kee Mao. Oh boy they did it so wrong with the most basic dish. Pad Kee Mao without a black sauce - it was basically fried thick noodles and it was such a letdown. I was wondering if they just had a bad cook that day or just absolutely had no idea how to cook this.\n\nThe service was just ok. There were 2 waitresses the day I was eating here. One of them was good and another one was just mediocre - didn't pay much attention except when I was about to pay and leave a tip."

Authentic Thai food. So we found this gem.  We had three dishes and I have to say I was well satisfied. The place was a typical hole in the wall but I knew it was authentic since I saw the stack of thai newspaper when I walked in.  We had the boat noodle, chicken basil leaves, and last but not least the combo. Which consist of grill pork, papaya salad, and sticky rice.  Inexpensive and authentic.  I'll definitely stop by again."

The waitress was very patient as I asked a few questions about the menu as I have a peanut allergy and inquired into the ingredients of some of the dishes.  The food was served very quickly. Our appetizer were the vegetable egg rolls.  They were pretty much what we expected.  Most likely deep fried from frozen pre made.  I ordered the shrimp and chicken with silver noodles.  It was very good with a nice mild sauce.  There was no need to add any other seasoning or condiments to the dish.  I am looking forward to returning to try more dishes off the menu.  Definitely worth a visit plus the prices are very reasonable."

            "review": "Before I hit my errands, I need some fuel for my mind and body. So what better way to fill my tank up with my favorite Thai restaurant. I actually drove down the street to drop off my clothes to the dry cleaners and next to it was a Thai place to eat, but even that couldn't stop me from driving another three miles to eat where my heart tells me.\n\nI was greeted ever so kindly when I walked in and it wasn't surprising that almost every seat was taken. Luckily it was only me, myself, and oh yea I that wanted to dine here this day. The server asked what I wanted to drink, unfortunately they didn't have the Chrysanthemum tea, so I did my usual hot tea, but even that is soothing and delicious... tasted like a light caramel tea, but it's really jasmine tea. I was debating on the Duck Fried Rice, since Lily (server) recommended it when I ate there a couple of months ago. But I wanted some soup for my soul, because today was a very chilly and windy day. I ordered the Chicken Tom Yum Noodle Soup, Flat (fat shoe lace) Noodles, since it just makes it more delicious to me... mild (5) for how spicy I want it and this time I didn't want to torture myself as I usually do ha! and extra diced garlic.. what??!? I love garlic ok it does the body good! The soup came out in zero time and I loved the way it smelled. The steam evaporated in the air in slow motion, made it looks so heavenly fresh and I had to take a snapshot of it against the sun.. it just looked so Food Digest front cover magazine-ish. I sipped the soup broth first, it was like liquid nitrous for my engine.. my eyes lit up and made my facial muscles break a happy smile. I literally said Mmmmm gulping it down... Yea tell me about it... sound good right??!? It tasted so good, my own body melted. It had bits of cilantro, diced green onion, bean sprouts, and TONS of chunky sliced white chicken meat. Loved the flat fat noodles... it was just the right amount to make me a full bear, where I could hibernate right then and there. \n\nBut all that time I was enjoying my soup, I was also craving their Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice. I ordered that dessert right after and when it came out.. I heard from the table across from me whispering.. that dessert looks so good!! And then all this time, two guys watched me devour my lunch and then this delicious dessert... I heard him say to his friend.. Dayam that girl can eat!!! Dayam right I can!??!! I'm not shy when it comes to eating and definitely will eat to my heart's content, bet your butt I will! So I just smiled at the guys and kept on eating. I'm enjoying my meal, so let it be! The dessert was the icing on the cake... the finishing touches of a great phenomenal meal. The mango was riped and perfect to eat. Every bite of the sticky rice was warm, soft, and soothing. Loved the coconut milk that drizzled down every time I took a slice from it. The ratio between the mango slices and sticky rice was even to every single bite I took. Absolutely loved this dessert. It's my favorite Thai dessert from any other. \n\nTheir food has been consistent every single time I have gone here and the service is always very attentive and friendly. Refilled my tea without being asked and always came back to see how I'm doing. Loved the fact that after I finished my dessert, the server asked if there was anything else I would like haha I could possibly go for another dessert, but no I'll definitely be hibernating in that restaurant if I did. I always leave so happy and satisfied... No joke. And off I went to do my errands... it was a great day for another great Thai food experience."

It'll be on the side facing Wynn. \n\nOnce we found the place we weren't exactly too sure if we were in the right place because all it said was noodle house but once we got inside the full restaurant name was painted on the left with a cool mural as well. The mural looked like a hole in the wall, which is exactly what the restaurant is. We were seated very quickly and you can easily tell how busy they were.\n\nOn to the food, my boyfriend and I ordered the pad see ew, bbq over fried rice and the Tom yum soup with the think noodles. Sorry no pictures cause we ate it too quickly! The food came out very quick considering a huge family was still waiting for theirs. A little bit of background, my boyfriend is thai and his mom is also a retired Thai chef and we've visited Thailand together twice. So trust that we know good Thai food, and trust that the food here is amazing. The pad see ew tasted just like how his mom makes it. Savory but sweet and with a large portion as well. The bbq chicken over fried rice was my favorite though. The fried rice was really yummy and the bbq chicken came with a sweet and sour sauce that you can dip it in. The Tom yum soup was an okay dish to me, Thai people love their lemongrass and it was a little bit too much for me. We got a level 8 spicy but if you're not used to Thai spicy the level 5 is spicy for Americans. Don't test yourself or try to act cool and get 10... You'll die so don't think about it. The waitresses were very nice and no matter how busy they were they took their time with each customer and checked to see if there was anything else needed. They never rush you to get out but it's courteous not to stay long after your meal so that the waiting customers can grab a seat to eat.\n\nThe Overall, very big delicious portions and this will definitely be our Thai spot whenever we visit Las Vegas and make sure to stop by every time too!"

Also their fried rice dishes are spicy so if this place doesn't warm you up, then oh well.\nThe roasted duck noodle was quite good and tasted different than other broths. I like different things so this was a very nice change of pace for me. \nThe chicken noodle soups are so perfect for combating a cold. You get a good amount of food for a decent price, which makes it an excellent value. \nIt's somewhat small inside, so be ready for that. Maybe avoid peak hours. And if it matters, there are actual Thai people working here. For some reason I like watching them take down my order in Thai. \nAnyways, give it a try. It's different than the somewhat boring Japanese ramen places (those are bold words coming out of MY mouth). Different is good!"

They are deep fried and have 3 different sauces on them, something like a sweet mayo, then a teriyaki, and some sriracha all across the tops! Our waitress actually informed us it was the most popular appetizer ordered. Sold. It was a good mixture of sauces! Thought it would be too much, but it was great together.\n\nSeafood Rad-Na with Wonton\nSaw this cute little dish hand-drawn/written on a piece of paper on the wall near us! Couldn't resist. This dish was decent, but still enjoyed it!\n\nThree Companions (Pork)\nThe pork is soft! It's marinated I believe, and the papaya salad and sticky rice it comes with were all good!\n\nThen, a Thai Iced Tea to go.\n\nOkay, so all in all, both days, both bills were under $35! The portions were large! The service is off the hook! And the environment is so friendly! The waitress with the glasses is wonderful! She remembered us from the previous day!
