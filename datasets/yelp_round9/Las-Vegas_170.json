The display of all the pastries is very alluring.  They even make crepes if you want.  Every time I go into this store it reminds me of My Lovely Sam Soon, a korean series of a girl who follows her dreams of a pastry shoppe.  \n\nI will definitely visit here the next time I'm in Vegas."

            "review": "So who wouldn't love to see the biggest chocolate fountain in the world? It's Vegas so it is only appropriate for everything to be gaudy and that is exactly what Jean Philippe did. \n\nEverything tasted just wonderful and all the desserts are made with great care and attention to detail. My only problem was that there is not seating and the wait staff move at an extreme glacial pace. There is one side for coffee and crepes and there is another side just for desserts. It's never marked which side is which so I had no idea where to go. The worst part is I wanted both a dessert and a crepe and both the lines were long and slow! What on earth was I supposed to do? When I finally got to the front of the line I asked the man if there was any way that I could put in an order for a crepe even though I was on the dessert side and instead of saying \"let me see what I can do\" he huffed and puffed and told me what a trouble it was going to be for him and I should just wait in both lines next time. HOW RUDE! That single moment pretty much ruined my entire experience. Then 20 min later I finally get my food and I have to find a bench somewhere just to eat my now soggy crepe."

I mean that alone is a show stopper right there! Once you've tried their gelato and crepe, you'll be an avid fan just like moi! \n\nTheir crepe is delightful! The batter they use here has just the right concoction. It is perfect in every way. Texture, taste, smell, and appearance! I always get it with bananas, nutella, and a scoop of vanilla bean gelato. HmmHmm..heavenly! \n\nI've been here lots of times. Despite the efforts in wanting to try something else, I always get pulled back to getting my favorites, the crepe and gelato! I promise to try something new next time I visit =)"

Also to add about those macaron's they even stayed fresh and didn't even melt or crumble while we had it sitting in our trunk, through the hot desert we traveled going home. I can't forget these were soft, chewy and delightful!\n\nThird the Iced coffee we ordered wasn't bad at all, it tasted better than what you get at a Cinnabon! \n\nWe had a disappointing stay at the Bellagio but this place was a golden nugget find!"

Be warned however that it takes around 20 minutes to make and not for the rushed.\nWe also ordered the almond croissants- these were flaky, light, buttery, and the perfect amount of almond cream.\nThe creme brulee and the cheesecake were light and delicious. \nWe ordered a large americano but I would skip any type of drinks here and just go for their desserts.\nEverything is pretty pricey- we paid over $70 total but I'd totally come here again."

It's just that everything looked so pretty AND tasty that I had to take document it all!\n\nUnfortunately I didn't get to try much.  We ordered a sugar brioche, almond brioche and almond croissant.  Every single thing was very light yet still rich with flavor (and probably butter and sugar).  The almond brioche and croissants were especially pleasing, given the copious quantities of almonds and almond paste/marzipan, which I love.  The croissant was flaky and not rubbery, much better than what you'd get at typical bakeries or grocery store pastry counters.  We took them to go, and they were still delicious after a plane ride home back to San Jose.\n\nKinda pricey but I wasn't shocked.  It is Vegas, and it is fancy-ish.  Would go back again next time to try the crepes and gelato."

            "review": "Beautiful works of pastry art right in the Bellagio hotel. Jean Phillipe knew what he was doing. It was so hard to choose just one pastry to eat for breakfast. But, we managed to complete this arduous task. My friends and I chose the triple chocolate cheesecake, straight cheesecake, blueberry dessert, Intense (chocolate on chocolate upon more chocolate), and a fruit tart. In addition, we got milk chocolate and white chocolate covered strawberries. They were just too good not to order as well. Everything we chose was absolutely delicious, albeit a little on the sweeter side than I'd like it to be. Thank goodness we had lots to water to wash all the sugar down. But, the quality of the ingredients - down to the chocolate, the cheese, the fruit - was amazing. It was a shame we didn't have enough time (or room in our stomachs) for their other offerings, such as their gelato and their baked goods. I saw an almond croissant (with almond paste inside) that I really wanted to try. Sigh, next time...\n\nThe best thing was we were eating our pastries while enjoying the artwork there. A French woman sculpture in a summer gown towered over the bakery, and the famous chocolate fountain were sights to be seen. So, if you're staying in the Bellagio or just hotel hopping here, please give Jean Phillippe patisserie a try. You won't regret it!"

We splurged and got 4 different flavors of Gelato - dulce de leche, creme brulee, oreo, and mint. The Gelato was truly delicious, however not the absolute best I have ever had. The service on the other hand was horrible... Truly the worst service I have had in a very long time. We are a friendly family and when we greeted the woman with a \"Hello! How's your evening going?\" we got a blank stare... Then when we asked if we could try a couple samples she genuinely rolled her eyes at us. May I add that we were the only people in line as this time. The only words she spoke to us were to tell us our total and even then we didn't get any eye contact. I hope that she was just having an \"off night\" but she made me feel like I was a terrible inconvenience on her evening."

Chocolate waterfall is certainly full of wonder. \n\nNutella brioche is outstanding! Huge too! Everything is right about it, so JP - bravo. \n\nHam and cheese croissant is another big hit! I love the hint of nutmeg in the sauce. The croissant itself is really better than some that I had in France. Impressive! \n\nChocolate crepe is thicker & with firmer texture than what you'd get in Paris, which is what I prefer. Chocolate can be more flavorful and whipped cream isn't as rich or delish as European but American dairy contain less milk fat anyway... Solid crepe in conclusion. \n\nFast moving line. Mediocre coffee honestly. If you are close by, go try it out. Otherwise, don't walk a mile, unless you just want to walk :)"

Pause, for a second, stop drooling, and keep on moving, at the end of the line you can discreetly charge it to your room, or as I do, sell the family jewels, you can't eat them anyway.\n\nOut of the two Las Vegas locations, this one is little more pleasant, as can sit and enjoy your peccadillo in a tranquil, and elegant atmosphere, the one in ARIA is on the casino floor, is hectic & very noisy. That said, you will be equally pleased."

A HUGE chocolate fountain! Okay, you've got my attention. Pastries, ice cream and fancy cakes galore! I had just eaten more than I should at the Bellagio Buffet, so I just grabbed some chocolate covered pretzels for the plane ride back home and a post card of the chocolate fountain (to show off to my friends).\n\nNext time, before I go the buffet, I will definitely try either a crepe or a pastry... and of course more chocolate.\n\nA few side notes: I like the bag they put your goodies in. hehe If you ask for ice water, they give you a real cup with a lid!

To be fair I did not have a crepe or sandwich but did see hoards of people devouring both while barely stopping long enough to chew. I did however get a scoop of straccitella gelato, for the uninitiated this is similar to a chocolate chip ice cream.  We also had a few of the the signature delectables including the carrot cake and a choco-banana type of thing. The single scoop of gelato was more than enough to satisfy my sweet tooth for a while so I asked to have the treats packed up to carry them on the plane. I noticed that there are a few selections of sugar free items and had to get one for my diabetic mother. She said it was one of the best she has ever had. This patisserie is one of the best in the world. Not to be missed but be prepared to pay top dollar for top quality."

Their gelato is creamy and rich and one scoop for me just hits the spot, and is $3.25.  I can't even remember all of the different desserts I've had that are simply delectable.  Their coffee is also pretty decent.  I have yet to try their cakes though, which is definitely something I'm interested in.  It's also a fun place to get foodie souvenirs, they have delicious macarons and chocolates that you can give to anyone, as long as you don't stay outside in the Vegas heat for too long and they melt away...\n\nReally, I have no complaints.

Well to tell you the truth it's just a crepe with Vanilla custard cream.   I suggest you have someone get in line and order the crepe as someone else grabs a table.  The line gets pretty long and seats are limited."

There are signs pointing towards which direction it is located in!\n\nI was actually pretty surprised at how small this place was. I had envisioned to be a full bakery/patisserie with tons of cute little cafe tables/chairs and whatnot, but that wasn't the case. It's like a circular area with the employees/staff all in the middle, and you kinda just walk around the counter to look at all of the pastries, gelato, sandwiches, etc.\n\nOne wall has the famous chocolate fountain, which honestly...was not as big as I had pictured. When people said it's the \"biggest chocolate fountain in the world\" I was thinking like straight up Willy Wonka status. This was totally not the case! Granted, it was a really nice glass display and I really liked that they had dark, milk, and white chocolate pouring in it, but I didn't think it was as mindblowing as I had expected it to be.\n\nAlong the circular walls they have a bunch of packaged goodies like chocolates, candies, hot chocolate mix, etc. They also have some fake cakes on display. I'm not sure if they actually bake fancy cakes here, but the displays were nice!\n\nUnfortunately I had just eaten lunch and wasn't hungry at all, so I didn't any of the pastries although I had REALLY wanted to try some of them out! They didn't have a HUGE selection but some of them looked very tasty! I ended up getting a scoop of the dulce de leche gelato ($3+), and the Jean Philippe vanilla hot chocolate mix ($18).\n\nThe gelato was ok to me. Presentation wasn't the nicest, and also it was really soft...like to the point where it was basically melting! Gross. I wasn't impressed.\n\nI made the hot chocolate mix when I came home, and I must say, this stuff is INCREDIBLE. It reminds me of the hot chocolate at Churros Calientes in Los Angeles. Super thick, rich, and decadent. omg, it is incredible. I'm glad it turned out well because $18 for only a few cups of hot chocolate was pretty pricey! Even more than Godiva and some other high end chocolate brands.\n\nOverall, I liked Jean Philippe but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I was going to be. I definitely would return to actually try some of their pastries and maybe even their crepes (which are supposed to be amazing). 3 stars!"

The chocolate fountain is absolutely beautiful and will have you staring at it for a good few minutes. All of the pastries here are beautifully displayed and all of them look delectable. \n\nThey create amazing cakes and chocolate sculptures here too. They look so fake, but are definitely real. If you really want to appreciate how beautiful it is, just look at it, but don't look at the price... Everything here is a little pricey, but you are in Vegas, right? Just live a little and enjoy!\n\nI decided to go with the Rose Macaron. I think I chose the most delicious dessert possible! It was a raspberry macaron filled with rose water cream and fresh raspberries. It was beautifully topped off with a sugar coated rose petal. It was almost too beautiful to eat...I said ALMOST. The raspberries were fresh, the rose water cream was rich and silky smooth and the raspberry macaron itself had a perfect texture. I can honestly say that it was one of the best macarons that I've had! Absolutely delicious!\n\nI would highly recommend checking this place out if you are craving something sweet. They have plenty of different pastries, gelato, chocolate, and crepes (savory & sweet)."

The Rose Macaron in the dessert case had caught my attention ever since my first visit, but it was a number of trips before I actually ever tried it. The selection of tasty treats--gelatos, danishes, crepes, chocolate confections-- can be overwhelming! \n\nThe Rose Macaron is more dessert than your standard macaron: two perfect, bright pink shells separated by fresh raspberries with a pastry cream filling, garnished with a crystallized rose petal. It's creamy, floral, fruity, and slightly chewy with a bit of crunch all at the same time. My husband could have saved money on an engagement ring by proposing to me with a Rose Macaron in a box from Jean Phillipe Patisserie.

It was amazing to see the chocolate fountain flowing with white, milk and dark chocolate at the Bellagio as its display but found the sculpted dragon made out of chocolate molding with pulled sugar even more amazing!  I see why people are attracted to this place.  Talk about great eye candy!  \n\nMy friend ordered the raspberry tart and the rose tea macaron.  The raspberry tart was basically a crust filled with pastry cream and a tier of raspberries.  That was not something we felt was worth almost $7.  Nothing special.  The rose tea macaron was definitely something out of the ordinary but again didn't retrieve enough of our interest to try it in the near future.  It's basically rose tea infused into cream to give it that distinctive taste.  \n\nI went back the next day to the one inside the Aria hotel and got the fruit tart.  Although it was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, I wasn't feeling much excitement with the pastry cream nor the crust.  For paying so much for a little pastry, I had high expectations that this would be the best tart I've ever tasted.  Sadly, it just \"looked\" great.  \n\nI would probably end up going back to vegas to try their other treats.  Who knows?  I might end up with a favorite!"

That's a lot of cavities!  This is definitely a tourist trap so if you want to take pictures, try to pop in at an obscure hour like 11PM or something.  \n\nThe pastries here are excellent.  I can't speak for their crepes or gelato at this or Aria's location but I do enjoy me an almond croissant here and a white chocolate mocha with soy milk.  Their macrons are decadent as well.  \n\nSo what are you waiting for?  Pop in and get some grub!  This place is amazing!  They were decorated especially adorably during the winter season!"

They should really open a express line for patrons that only want a cup of coffee.  It was really ridiculous that I had to line up for 30 minutes before I can get to the cashier to order my coffee and be told that the wait time for the crepe will be another 60 minutes.  I like crepes, but not enough to be wasting 90 minutes of my precious vacation time to eat a dessert crepe.\n\nIf you want to have a relaxing cup of coffee and some pastries, I highly recommend going to the Jean Philippe at the Aria Hotel instead.  This location at the Bellagio is a total madhouse flooded with tourist."

But what about the....wait for it........lovely chocolate fountain that sits right in a glass enclosure in the front of the business? Yes! Well for me, that was the first thing I noticed. Just a thing of beauty. One of the 7 natural sweet wonders of the world!\n\nJean Philippe Patisserie is your go to sweet stop which is located right in the Bellagio Hotel in beautiful Las Vegas right on the Strip. Yes, they do have I believe 2 more locations in Vegas. This one just stands out to me because it was the first one I tried whenever I come to Vegas. You will find here many a tourist snapping pictures away from their cameras or phones, and for good reason. Just the sight of so much they have here to offer. From cakes, pies, brioches, sandwiches, ice cream, gelato, chocolate strawberries and so much more, you will get magnetized here and want to stay and try just about everything. For myself, I almost did that!\n\nI managed to arrive here with my foodie +1 date approximately an hour before they closed. I figured that was about enough time for us to try what we wanted. She had her eye on the strawberry tart and caramel brulee gelato. I had my eye on a triple chocolate tiramisu liked cake with a small macaron on top drenched in chocolate. Delicious, tantalizing and all around lovely I say. I have not had quite the treat since the last time I went to Milk back in Los Angeles! Inside there is only a small table with a few high stools. Try to grab one or two if you are lucky. We were actually lucky enough to do so. They also have a display of gorgeous cakes that they have designed. All are in glass enclosures that rotate about. Right on top of the register counter you will find such a gorgeous sculpture as well that is sure to please the wandering eye. \n\nFor all that we purchased, it came out to around $19. Not bad in price. You will get hit with the sweet odor of chocolate upon arrival as well as the lovely view of all they have to offer. By far, I have been to many a dessert stop in my life. Jean Philippe Patisserie, in all honesty, ranks in my Top 5 all time. If you don't believe me, the next time you are in Vegas, come and have a look see. Maybe you will want to try some of their cold tasty gelato. Or their soft tasty subs. Or even some of the tastiest pastries you ill ever have on the Strip. Bon Appetit, Yelp!"

I remember when I first received my small package of peanut brittle from Jean Philippe Patisserie. I looked at the label, saw the price, scoffed and thought to myself, this better be some hella good peanut brittle. Who the heck would pay $15 for peanut brittle?!?!?! Uhhh yeah... apparently I would because I bought two packages of it on my first trip to Vegas. I SPECIFICALLY sought out the place JUST for the brittle... but well, like all good places you end up buying way more than you anticipated. \n\nThis wonderful patisserie is tucked inside the Bellagio hotel. Although many people rave about the chocolate fountain, I didn't find it THAT spectacular. Honestly, by the way people were describing it, I was expecting to see the type of fountain out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. But the fountain is a nice addition to the place. They also have crepes, gelato, a beautiful assortment of pastries and desserts, chocolates, and drinks. I left with 2 chocolate brownies, 2 packages of peanut brittle, vanilla sugar, and a fruit tart. I had to stop myself at that, even though I didn't want to! It's like gambling, you have to know when to stop. So if you get a chance, check this place out. I've definitely found one of my favorite sins in Sin City!"

Full disclosure, I didn't get to taste any of the bakery items or gelatos as I have an egg allergy and those items all contain egg, so this is based largely on the chocolate and coffee.\n\nThe chocolate is decent--they use Valrhona chocolate as the base on the smaller chocolates that I had, so you know that's going to be nice for pretty much any chocolate fan. A fellow customer recommended the chocolate coffee beans, which are chocolates shaped like little coffee beans and flavored with coffee, too. The coffee, however, seems a little off in flavor. Mr. Piano had a crepe and liked it, however, so it might just be that everything that they do well is the stuff with egg in it that I can't have. I'm also a little appalled by the miniscule $8 cup of fresh carrot juice? Did I misread that somehow? I know Vegas is expensive, but dang...\n\nWe were there near Halloween, so the d\u00e9cor had that theme going on, and I have to say, the presentation of both the decorative confections and the actual sale confections is really great! Everything looks fantastic--and at those prices, they had better be. The place is fantastic as a spectacle and visual treat, for sure, even if what I was able to have did not live up to any hype. Also, it would have been nice if the workers had a little more knowledge of what did or did not definitely have certain allergens in it (and if the gelato worker was a little less dismissive).\n\nOverall, not a bad place to come and look and maybe grab some souvenir chocolates, but let's say no to the coffee, at least."

It ain't cheap for a VERY good reason. You won't find one as smooth anywhere else, and as chocolaty, yet not too sweet. Don't just take picture of the cool chocolate fountain, get a hot chocolate!

They are always busy so even at 10 in the night expect a big line. Ordering a bit confusing as there are multiple payment stations placed around a circular counter so you need to know what you want and then queue up in the right line.\n\nDuring my first visit I decided to kick things off by getting some gelato. They have a bunch of flavors that look good so I wanted to try a couple before deciding but looking at the large line behind me I decided against it. I was certainly not offered any samples as I stared at the display case nor did I see the customary containers for dumping used spoons that are placed on top of the display counter, so I'm not sure if they hand out samples. Anyway I decided to go old school and get a scoop of stracciatella (which is a fancy name for vanilla and chocolate chips). \n\nTaste-wise it was good but it lacked the silky texture of gelato. This gelato has to be the closet to ice-cream that I've ever had. If they could somehow keep their flavors intact but get the texture and consistency of gelato from Cafe Gelato it would be the best gelato in the world. Anyway I am not a purist and I like ice-cream as much as I like gelato so I enjoyed it a lot. During subsequent visits I came back and tried some more flavors that I don't recollect and found them all to be good but not great.\n\nPricewise it is in-line with what you will pay at other similar places on the strip (Large Gelato around $6, Pastries around $8 and crepes around $11). Overall I liked Jean Philippe but I feel that both their gelato and service could use a little improvement."

I was staying at Vdara, but found that their quick breakfast place had a really long line.  Since I was in a bit of a hurry, I decided to cross the walkway over to the Bellagio and search out some food next door.\n\nJean Philippe was the first place open and the line wasn't too long.  Since it was around 8:30 AM, I didn't get a chance to try any of their deserts.  And since I prefer savory breakfast to sweet breakfast, I went with their turkey and cheese crepe.  As far a crepes go it was good but nothing mind blowing.  In other words, it got the job done but I don't need to go out of my way to come back anytime soon.\n\nI actually had a much better crepe back at the Paris Hotel and Casino several years back, who knows if that place is even open anymore."

They are supposed to be fresh and flaky, not stale and greasy... at 9am in the morning. Were they leftovers from yesterday? I think so, because all 3 of us felt uncomfortable and bloated after eating only a couple of bites. In case you are wondering, it is not a good feeling. There may be some people who like feeling bloated, but I am not one of those. You are an abomination to all my French friends. They wouldn't touch this shit with a 10 foot pole.\n\nSecondly, what kind of an idiot designed your store? You know all the tourists are going to swarm your place like cokeheads at a drag queen bingo event. Why would you design it in a way that does not make sense and backs up traffic into the lobby? Do I really want to knock the diva-acting bitch from Europe who is acting like she deserves to cut in front of the line? Don't make me a cut a bitch.\n\nYes, your cakes are visually appealing. Maybe I would be impressed if I am getting married at the Bellagio and ordered a wedding cake from you. But, I am not tacky enough to do that. I also hope your cakes do not taste like your croissants.\n\nAnd, what's up with the coffee? Is burnt coffee the latest trend? Did I miss the memo? You know, I am not always up to date on the latest food/ drink trends. Hold on, I am getting a call (channeling Dave Letterman)... wait a minute, I am being told that burnt coffee is not the current trend. I've been cheated.\n\nThe only redeeming grace was the nutella brioche. It was very very good. Hence, the 2 stars.\n\nLesson learnt: just because something has a fancy French name does not mean it is good. Now you know. Aaaaand, you are welcome!"

But the result is one big disappointment.  The store decor and food presentation are 5-star but the actual food taste is 2-star at best.  Reckon yelper \"Vi Y\", did anyone actually eat the food before they commented?? or did they simply commented on the decor?  \n\nBeing crepe lovers ourselves, I had a mixed berry vanilla crepe and my husband had a classic savory ham and cheese crepe & a glass of grapefruit juice.  The bill came out to $32, which was rather on the pricey side for crepes, but it was nothing much by Vegas standard (noted their sitdown area is a small, self-served corner with limited seating.  Like a food court). \n\nUnfortunately both of our crepes came out bland.  Nothing extraordinary.  Nothing to write home about.  My sweet crepe was covered completely with too much overly sweetened berry sauce and the vanilla melt in the middle was too much & thick, making the layers so soggy with little to no texture.  My husband's savory crepe was little bit better than mine.  It was severely lacking cheese but at least the buckwheat crepe batter balanced out better with its ingredients, brought out a little bit more flavor and texture. \n\nBut overall, both crepes were subpar-mediocre at best, not made of high quality, fresh ingredients.   Both tasted rather pre-made, pulled right out of a fridge.   Given so much expectation and hype, we felt like both our bellies and our pockets got jipped."

Each dessert is around $6.50, which sounds reasonable except for the fact that you'll want to try all of them!!  My favorite turned out to be the cheesecake with the raspberry on top- It's described as \"cream cheese, graham cracker, and raspberry compote.\"  I just call it nummy goodness.  It's bascially a small moist graham cracker disc topped with a sweet cream cheese which is then topped with this sweet raspberry mixture and encased in what I remember was flexible white chocolate.  I mean, it's so smooth and delicious you're bound to get addicted.  Don't miss it!  Expect to spend at least $40 over the course of your Vegas trips due to repeat visits =)  Also, there's one in Aria and also one in Bellagio.  The one in Bellagio has the cool chocolate fountain.

The real disappointment came with the salmon on the salmon crepe (my go to order). The smell alone was off putting and it was so fatty and fishy I pushed aside and just ate what I could of the now cold crepe. The palmier was still wonderful and the coffee was good just too cold. I haven't given up on this place by any means but they need to keep a closer eye on quality. Even yesterday the brioche was stale at the Jean Philippe in Aria (though the rest was good)."

It doesn't taste overwhelmingly of butter, which I prefer, but it might not be right for those who want a super buttery croissant.\n\nUnsweetened Blueberry Muffin was packed with blueberries and just the right amount of sweetness for a morning muffin. If you have a serious sweet tooth, get the regular one.\n\nGelato & Sorbet: We got a double scoop of Rocky Road and Unsweetened Strawberry Sorbet in a cone. The Rocky Road was intensely chocolatey and contained brownie bites and marshmallow. I'm not a fan of marshmallow normally, but I thought it was nice in the gelato. However, this is definitely a super sweet choice, so I suggest you balance it with something less sweet. In our case, the sorbet was perfect with its tartness.\n\nService: 3.5\n\nThe staff member who helped us with our gelato order was super nice and very patient with all of our requests. She didn't mind letting us try a bunch of flavors, and she gave us an extra cup because we got a double scoop on a cone. However, the staff member who helped us with our pastry order did give us some attitude. My mom requested a different croissant from the one that he originally grabbed for us, and he aggressively dumped the old croissant back into display.\n\nAmbiance: 5\n\nThis particular branch of Jean Phillippe Patisserie located in the Bellagio contains the snap worthy chocolate fountain. The store is divided into a section for pastries and coffee, crepes, ice cream, and tarts and cakes. We stopped by a night before New Year's Eve, but there wasn't a long line for any of the sections. Perhaps we were just lucky?"

Where people walk by and have Willy Wonka fantasies of being Augustus Gloop....the symbol of gluttony to drink from the never ending flow of chocolate waterfalls cascading from one dish to another. The shop has a huge variety of truffles, chocolates, gelato, sorbets, and pastries. \nYou can also have a custom cake made. The pastries are best if you go before 8pm. Usually there's hardly anything left by 10pm.  I've had this decadant chocolate clair which the chocolate just explodes in your mouth coating it with extacy. The cheesecake, tastes like cheesecake. Not overly sweet, small so you feel less guilty, and covered in white chocolate gives a harmonious balance to the palate. His assortment of chocolate easily rivels Voges. \nThey do have sandwiches and stuff. The crepes are pretty fantastic. I had the bananas foster with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. It's not on the menu --- you gotta order it with your creativity. Mmmm it was great with the berry sorbet. Yes....that's made in house too! This place is definitely chocolate heaven. It's really cool to see everyone's reaction when they come in. \n\"Mommy look at the chocolate!\"\n(Pointing at the chocolate falls) \n\"I wanna eat it all!\"\n\"Yea me too!\" \n\nEh....kids=petri dish"

That's my thing. But it was just a big surprising joke that this chocolate croissant from this place wasn't right compare with the price that I paid for. $4.50 for chocolate croissant sure if the filling was full. But this one wasn't at all. The chocolate filling was very skimpy. For the price, this croissant was supposed to be full of deliciousness. But the croissant itself just fell apart when I was eating it, very crumbled. What I can says is the Starbucks chocolate croissant much better compare this one. \n\nMy husband ordered the veggie omelette with fruit & wheat bread but he got the white bread instead. He was just too lazy to deal with the line just to tell them about the wrong bread. The taste of the omelette was just bland. Didn't look tempting at all, it was looked like a cheap grocery store. It was just a egg pancake rolled up with vegetables skattered on top. It cost almost $11 for that and nothing special about it. Even Denny's makes a better Omelete than that. I can make the omelette much much better than that! \n\nSo I won't be back here next time for the breakfast or the croissant but I might try other sweet treats just for the heck of it. \nThis place is just definitely a tourist trap from one famous name, but not worth the pennies that you pay for."

It was so difficult to not get it all over yourself.  The coffee was good and I typically don't like just black coffee with cream and sugar.   \n\nMy only gripe about this place is that it's too small, very inefficient flow...if you wanted cream and sugar or napkins, it's on a counter in the reverse direction of the ordering and paying line.  When you are trying to leave, people are trying to get to the counter with minimal space to move.  \n\nI must come back next time I make a trip to Vegas and visit Jean Philippe Patisserie to try the other selections.  Hopefully, I don't break the bank...a little spendy for pastries."

It's still good as it's not too sweet\n\nSticky bun - I'll repeat myself, delicious!

Everything looked great, but something else I had glanced at earlier caught my attention first.\n\nAt the very front of the bakery behind a sheet of curved plexiglass is a crepe station where you can watch as freshly made crepes are prepared on a hot griddle.  They had two crepes on display, a mixed berries crepe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=Y23VBoGim8Vl8JSUTUQM5w) and a chocolate decadence crepe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=NHqifygfOqSomQpVOprLyQ).  I ordered one of the chocolate ones.  It took a bit of time to be prepared, but the overall product was worth the wait.  The display crepe actually looked better and had a bit more chocolate and a lot more powdered chocolate, but I'm thankful because the crepe I was served was sweet enough.  The chocolate pieces, shavings and glazes were decadent alright and the crepe was nice and chewy.  I didn't eat all the cream as I felt pretty bloated after this dessert.\n\nI didn't stop with the crepe either.  I returned to the counter and ordered a single chocolate-covered strawberry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=S4rtxwJXeLP4BGi5lakoYA) to take with me to eat at a later time.  My strawberry was a bit squished by the time I returned to the hotel, but it was still delicious nonetheless.  I had fun licking the chocolate off the side of the bag.\n\nThe bakery serves gelato also and has a nice assortment of boxed confections on display.  There are other crepe selections also other than the two that were on display.  Jean Philippe Patisserie was the perfect reward to an excellent race."

They also have hot and cold sandwiches and quiche which have garnered good reviews, but would try a crepe over these.\n\nThey also have a yummy almond croissant - buttery, flaky, and full of almond, although much larger than a normal croissant...this could also easily feed two people at least.\n\nThere is a chocolate fountain that was drawing a lot of attention a la Willie Wonka ... Many tourists and kids gaping and snapping pics, but was personally not overly impressed and more nauseated (and I do love chocolate).\n\nDrawbacks: extremely long wait during peak hours or holidays.  Wait was more than 1 hr just to order.  Also, the line was awkwardly wrapping around the crepe station, where gawkers were also gathered to watch the crepe making."

We got a sashimi salad, yes we got a sashimi salad at a pastry cafe and it DID NOT dissappoint. just enough sashimi and it was freshh. I got a portabella panini which was so good .\n\nand of course, we got a dessert too.

So I ordered the snicker cake and the red velvet cupcake. \n\nThe snicker cake was amazing.

The iced coffee is strong and bold, just the way I like it!  The gelato is very creamy and not icy at all.  There are a good number of flavors, but not so overwhelmingly expansive.  You can also sample before you buy, which is very nice.  The pastries are about $4 and are very tasty and actually pretty large in size - definitely well-priced.\n\nThis bakery is very pretty (especially the chocolate fountain), is centrally located, is affordable, and of course makes delicious goodies.

Now, I'm not a big crepe fan, so despite that almost every other person was ordering it, those pancake things didn't \"look\" appetizing to me. In any event, I wanted to try something here, so I got the overpriced blended mocha drink. Too sweet for my liking. I prefer more of a bitter chocolate taste, but the drink tasted like a cheap food distributor-level chocolate syrup mixed with ice. I would not order it again. Overall, the experience was interesting cause of the fountains, but I'll pass on menu items. Also, this place could be a nice hang-out spot to avoid the casino scene, but I've always had difficulty finding a place to sit. I think people come here to look at the fountains and relax, and some don't even order anything. I wouldn't make this a destination spot."

Don't fall for the $9 bottle of water but indulge in the flaky goodness and sticky fun of a caramel pecan roll or dive into the Nutella crepe . The coffee is brewed very strong so if your into lighter roast opt for half decaf / half reg but enjoy !"

Fancy uniforms do not make chefs, and, unfortunately, the world's largest chocolate fountain can only offer Las Vegas style misdirection from the reality that here is a dressed up diner with fancy looking desserts. The simple veggie omelette we ordered was not only so-so, it took an actual 50 minutes from the time we entered the order line to the moment we got to sit down and eat it. 15 minutes was how long it took to get to the place to order, the rest was waiting for the food. When we asked why the people far behind us had gotten their ham and cheese omelette before us, the woman at the register apologized and said orders sometimes get mixed up when they get busy. OK, but sorry, the price for a small 2-egg omelette and a single slice of in buttered toast should have been comped or at least offered at a discount for the unreasonable wait. While we were waiting the coffee machine overflowed onto the floor as the stressed manager tries to relieve the pressure by filling cup after cup after cup with no success. Dark comedy behind the counter for sure. At least the entertainment was free."

But dollar for dollar, I felt my money was well spent at Jean Philippe Patisserie.  The $27 I spent on two crepes and a cafe au lait gave me more deliciousness and quality than any other meal I purchased in town.  \n\nBreakfast is phenomenal here.  Nutella brioche?  Yes, please.  Paired with a well-made cafe au lait, it made early mornings a lot easier.  Excellent bread filled with rich Nutella cream was a decadent way to start the day.  The wild blueberry tart (which they called brioche but I disagree) was good as well.\n\nCrepes are so good.  The savory crepes are made Breton-style with buckwheat.  The mushrooms in my egg crepe were incredibly flavorfill, a mixture of crimini and portabella that was lovely.\n\nI picked up some chocolates as gifts and tried a truffle myself.  Rich, creamy chocolate was just right.\n\nInsider tip: look at the menu before you get in line.  The line snakes around the shop, and they'll ask for you order before you can see the pastry selection, and the crepe menu can only be read if you are standing outside the shop in front of the crepe station.  So decide before you get in line."

So I had to try their other items. What got me was their crepes. Simple I know, the best is the Nutella crepe. I have had this many times from many other places. Jean Philippe by far dominates all the chocolatiering newbs! \n\nThey use the most perfect batter, firm yet chewy, soft and delicate. They top this warm gooeyness with fresh scratch made whip cream! The mixture of the crepe with the warm hazelnut chocolate smothered in cool freshly made cream is to die for! \n\nThis is food porn at its best. We loved this place so much we bought a box full of Jean Philippe goodies to take home to family and friends. This is now one of my first and last Vegas stops!"

It will give you time to check out the amazing cakes on display around the shop. I only wish I could afford a wedding cake like these! Check out the rice krispy treat balls, the truffles and the mini wedding cakes. There's the chocolate fountain that looks like something even Willy Wonka would have been proud of. Four different types of chocolate flow out of pipes in the ceiling, streaming over glass platforms into the floor. You can even buy bottles of chocolate from the fountain. \n\nMy partner got a basic bagel with cream cheese. I figured I'd try my hand at a plain croissant and a chocolate croissant. The bagel wasn't anything special, I guess, but both of my croissants were just about perfect! Flaky and soft, not dry at all.

TIP: Take this time to figure out what you want!! You will not be able to see a menu until you reach the register. The drinks menu display is also awkwardly placed, so that you can only see it when you're on the opposite side of the bar.

The bread was soft, but still had great texture. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!! My friends each got a panini, and they said that they were amazing. Better than Earl's even! ;)\n\nI would definitely recommend making a trip here if you're near Bellagio!!"

One can miss it walking in a hurry. It's amazing to look at. \n\nLots to see from desserts and pastries. Fancy cakes and little desserts. \n\nThere is usually a line. Finally found a point without a line. Staff is quick to help get the orders moving. Staff makes good selections as we elected to try the almond croissant she mentioned. We ordered a coffee beverage. \n\nThe pastry was served warm as if it came out of the oven. Flavors were sweet. Texture was flaky and melted with bites. Finished in almost no time. \n\nThe coffee drink was more on the bold side. However it was sweet in it's right.\n\nGood: fast helpful service matched with tasty pastries match the attraction to the shop.\nBad: always a line.\n\nI'll likely make a return trip to this patisserie. There is another shop in the other casino."

That was until I got to Jean Philippe Patisserie, where the well-formed line was already the center of activity in the hotel/casino that morning.  :)  I grabbed some coffees (they have soy milk - love that - thanks JP) and some muffins and croissants for my husband and some fresh fruit for me.  The muffins and croissants were way too much food for my husband, but there was no way I could limit the choices down for him -- everything looked amazing.  His favorite was the chocolate croissant.  \n\nEven if you don't indulge, go there to check out their chocolate fountain (makes you think of Willy Wonka), cakes or other decorations.

The texture was close to a custard filling.  The cookies were chewy with a hint of almond flavor.  The combination of the custard, fresh raspberries, and cookies blend in very well without being overly sweet.  It's definitely an afternoon treat after all the shopping! \n\n4-star for JP's version of Ispahan."

Seeing all those artfully designed cakes was like watching the completion of a food network competition. Okay, so I didn't try any of the delectable looking desserts, but I did have gelato. I love gelato and while I thought this gelato would be different, it wasn't. I ordered a mint chocolate chip gelato and it tasted really creamy and still delicious so I was still satisfied. My sister ordered the berry gelato and said it tasted like fruit roll up; brings back child-like memories. Now that I think about it, I wish I'd tried at least one of those chocolate desserts.

Behind the green garden there is a small garden of indulgence. Jean-Phillipe Patisserie. ( I believe he is the head chocolatier for Bellagio) Well, the place is spectacular and filled with goodies dripping from its wall and ceiling. Literally. :)\n\nMy favorite indulgence there is the gelato. It is pricey, but so worth it. I mean, hey, you are in a fancy place, you gotta expect to pay a fancy price. At least it's fancifully good too ~.^\n\nWhat is your mood? Something light and refreshing? Something soury to perk you up? Something with umph and rich? fruity? etc etc. You gotta taste them and make your pick. My last venture was for Tiramisu and Rum Raisin. *drool* Perfect combo. My sister chose strawberry and chocolate. The chocolate gelato is dark and rich and taste more chocolatey than a chocolate colored frozen sugar. That, my fellow yelpers, is how chocolate ice cream or gelato supposed to taste like.\n\nIn the Summer I would usually go for the fruity sorbet type, like mango, coconut, lemon. They perk you and chill your body as you stroll out into the hot summer of Las Vegas.\n\nThe place opens late and will fulfill your sweetest indulgence from something cold, something warm, something hot and something crunchy. Cakes, Pastries, Chocolates, Candies, Crepes, Gelato. You name it. They opens pretty late and starts early in the day (in case you play hard and forgot the time of day and realize you need *ehm* breakfast.

Not cheap, but hella good and hella worth it! Love the chocolate combination...it was rich and thick just the way I like it! My friend ordered one of the savory crepes. It was OK- I'm more of a sweets person."

            "review": "Jean Philippe Patisserie is a lovely little cafe & dessert shop with gorgeous decor and a cool chocolate fountain! They have both sweet and savory crepes, gelato, beautiful desserts, pastries, cold sandwiches, hot paninis, and coffees. They also sell chocolates, candies, and other goodies that you can bring home or give as gifts.\n\nI tried the Chicken crepe (savory) and the Exotic Souffle crepe (sweet) and was much more satisfied with the Chicken crepe, which had chicken, spinach, roasted red peppers, and a really delicious dressing. (I think there was probably more but I wolfed it down too quickly to notice all of the individual ingredients.) The Exotic Souffle crepe was basically a crepe with some melted vanilla cream inside (straight from the refrigerator), topped with a mango/pineapple sauce that was a bit too sour and used fruit that wasn't ripe enough yet, and a scoop of coconut sherbet. \n\nThe sweet crepes seem to be the most popular; there's often a crowd waiting in front of the crepe-making area. However, I think the savory crepes are more worth it than the sweet crepes, which are simpler to make (generally, Nutella and maybe some raw fruit). The savory crepes are much more filling and delicious!\n\nI also tried the salmon sandwich, and it was quite good, though expensive (like most other things at the Patisserie). I tried one of the pastries, an almond croissant, which was amazing! It was pretty different from your average croissant; the bottom layer of it was really moist and soooo good.\n\nThe drinks are not really worth it... $5 for a small latte that tastes pretty average, $4 for a plain iced coffee that tastes pretty dilute... Stick with the desserts and non-drinks!"

Now open them. A candy store is for losers, this is place is a candy store on crack. I felt like I was walking into Willie Wonka's factory when I came to this place and felt so overwhelmed. Chocolate, Cheesecake, Fruit Tarts oh my!! After checking out all the wonderful treats, I went with my favorite desert. Cheesecake! Now this was no ordinary cheesecake. I felt like it could have been in a art gallery because it was so beautiful. After the first bite I was in heaven. Literally the best cheesecake I've ever had and probably the most calories I've had but it was worth every bite. So rich and creamy with the raspberries almost making it seem healthy, HA HA who am I kidding, and every bite just leaves you rushing your fork back to it. Amazing! Willie Wonka has nothing on Jean Philippe!"

            "review": "Coming from the San Francisco Bay Area, there's a lot to complain about, but the one thing we excel at is having some of the best, if not the best bakeries/patisseries in the country. As a matter of fact, \"Arsicault\" was just named best bakery in the country by Bon Appetite, no small feat. Others like \"B Patisserie\" are also world class. So, I was really looking forward to sampling world class pastries at Jean Philippe patisserie.\n\nWhat an absolute disappointment.\n\nJean Philippe's flour/butter based pastries are pretty sad. Even before eating one of his pastries, just looking in the glass case, I could tell they were going to be mediocre to average. In fact, looking into his pastry case reminded me of Starbuck's bakery shelf. However, since I was here, I splurged on an almond croissant. The almond croissant is probably the best pastry to test the quality of a baker. A great almond croissant dough will be quite flaky if the necessary amount of butter  is used ( and that's going to be a lot of butter, folks). I can tell you that Jean Philippe really skimps on the butter in his croissant dough mixture. The almond paste was just average and the croissant itself was pretty tasteless. What can I say, his almond croissant would feel very comfortable on a Starbuck's pastry shelf. \n\nArsicault and B Patisserie would literally blow him out of the water. Further, if you're familiar with either of the two patisseries I've mentioned here, and you come to Vegas, just bypass Jean Philippe. You'll be glad you did. If you think I'm being too hard on Jean, I'm not. As a matter of fact, he might want to come to the City to see how we do it.\n\nIf your travels take you to San Francisco, and you're a pastry freak, do stop in at one or both of the patisseries mentioned here."

That's why the recipe for a successful Patisserie is relatively simple.     Yet there is no excuse for making bad desserts.  \n\nWe tried two desserts:   strawberry tart and opera cake.   Both were medicore at best. \n\nThe strawberry tart shell - subtracting the strawberries - was so sweet that even the tartness of strawberries could not offer any counter balance.   Too much sugar. \n\nThe opera cake (it's a French dessert but try one in Vienna ...) is distinguished by a delicate balance of bitterness and sweetness between dark chocolate ganache and coffee buttercream.   The sugar content in this version left us no choice but to just leave it after one bite.  \n\nDisappointing."

I'm more of a dense cake/cup cake person as apposed to a cake that's made entirely of a chocolate/white chocolate shell and filled with creams or mouses. It ends up tasting too sweet and it doesn't seem to satisfy me unless there's actual cake or layers of something I can bite down into.\n\nThe hubby and I only ended up trying two desserts here, one was a chocolate, hazelnut mouse bomb and the other was a cheesecake, which at first I wasn't aware had not \"cheese\" filling but rather something airy and covered in white chocolate (which BTW, I don't care for white chocolate at all because it's not really chocolate.)\n\nSo anyway, the chocolate fountain on the other hand was very cool looking and it was a shame I couldn't try it. The crepe station did look more appetizing so I may try that next time we're in town.\n\nOverall, it was too sweet and airy of a dessert for me and a bit too pricey at about $8 bucks a tarte/cake. But do try something here and maybe you might just end up liking it."

WAY.\n\nI couldn't even counter the sweetness with massive amounts of water.  I had to throw it out.

It was nice to stroll The Conservatory around the corner while enjoying my coffee. \n\nI grabbed some sweets to take home at the end of my stay as well. The raspberry tart (almond sponge cake, pistachio cream, raspberry mousse, brittle, and glazed raspberries on top) was really good. I enjoyed every last bite and the winning flavor combination. The lemon meringue tart had a nice tasting filling with a lightly toasted fluff topping. The only item that I didn't love was the apple brioche because it had an odd flavor and was a little on the dry side.\n\nAs you'd expect the goodies are on the pricey side. Everything in the case is marked so while pricey it shouldn't be a surprise when you go to pay.\n\nThe shop opens at 7 a.m., but doesn't start putting out the over the top desserts until 10 a.m. according to the cashier.

Not sure if it was a fluke, but this was one lemon tart he did not enjoy! \n\nFruit tart -- This tart I enjoyed a lot more compared to the old stale one from Cafe Madeleine at Paris. This had a smoother, creamier custard that I was hoping for, and a light crust that could hold the cream/fruit, but also be broken easily with my spoon. Very tasty. \n\nAlso sold fruit platters, coffee/tea, OJ, crepes, and sandwiches, but the sandwiches didn't seem that appealing. The big draw here were the desserts and gelato. And endless boxes of chocolates on display on nearly every wall of the place. \n\nExpensive, but stay on the strip long enough, and the high prices don't seem that surprising anymore! Extremely limited in seating, and the few tables they do have seem to be pushed against the walls, probably to make room for the people moving around the store looking at the boxes or bags of chocolates. \n\nEnjoyed what I got, to an extent, but was not really wowed by anything. Good, but not great."

I had that moment on a recent trip to Las Vegas.  I had walked through the Aria hotel and casino many times before.  And everytime, I had walked by the Jean Philippe Patisserie and admired its lavish cakes on display.  But I had never eaten there until a couple weekends ago when I went to Vegas for a bachelor party.  On one of the fateful mornings of the trip, we decided to go to the Aria to have breakfast, and at the recommendation of my friends, I ordered the Smoked Salmon Sandwich.  It was hands down, one of the greatest sandwiches I've ever eaten.  The smoked salmon almost melted in my mouth.  The dills and and mayonnaise gave the sandwich an excting and flavorful profile.  The egg on the sandwich added a protein balance to the salmon while making it a delicious brunch entree.  And the sweet bun was one of the greatest breads I've ever tasted.\n\nI kid you not, when I say that later that day, I almost wanted to cancel my other dining plans to go back and eat this sandwich again.  I plan to eat this sandwich at least once a day from now on, anytime I'm in sin city."

I actually prefer getting their savory sandwiches.  But then again, I think their sandwiches are a bit overpriced.  As for their price for crepes, you certainly would think that they are made with fresh fruits, but they are not.  I have had a lot better crepes in Denver for a fraction of that price.\n\nI do, however, like how sanitary and well upkeep the place is.

We barely got any pieces of mushrooms and it was actually too creamy for me. \n\nWe were on a time crunch so we ordered the Exotic crepe to go. However they forgot that we ordered it to go but just added a top to cover it for us. We tasted a little bit of it before we headed out. All of the fruit with the sauce was delicious. The coconut sorbet was really good too and had tons of coconut flakes. Unfortunately they didn't pack the sorbet separately so by the time we got to the car it was a melted mess. \n\nI also ordered an iced caramel macchiato and that I liked a lot.

I didn't try all of the food, but I make my own crepe, instead of getting a crepe on the menu. \n\nLet me tell you...you are DEFINITELY better off getting a crepe off the menu for ~$11. Making your own crepe is $16 and all I got was nutella, strawberry, and walnuts. There are other crepes that have five items in it and it costs ~$11. I don't get it, even for the Bellagio in Vegas, I see no logic.\n\nThe crepe itself was extremely sweet and huge! I needed some coffee or something afterwards. Inside the crepe was the nutella, outside the crepe was topped with strawberries, walnuts, more nutella, and whipped cream on the side. WHOO. Sweet overload. It was good, but so not worth the $16.

We didn't eat the almond croissant until two days later and it was still fabulous - best we'd had - large enough to share. When they bring out the pastries perhaps mid-morning it was a constant procession and you had to leave room in line to allow them to pass through from service door to display case. We went back a couple nights later after a show and less busy. Watched crepes being made while waiting for gelato line - spouse enjoyed chocolate in a cup ($5.25) - looked like cones were available as well. Still plenty of pastry choices - tried the Napoleon - maybe not the freshest but still good. The cafe au lait was very good. Shared limited seating with a couple from Australia. She left some of the fruit filling and all of her whipped cream from her crepe. You pay for the gelato separately but appears the other register at end of line covers the crepes and the pastry/coffee orders. Napoleon and coffee were about $12 - a treat because we were on vacation. Selection far surpasses the tiny Bouchon at the Venetian where we tried a cookie and macarons."

At first, I thought it would be chocolate overload. Boy, was I wrong. The first bite, I was in dessert heaven. If it were not so damn expensive ($9), I would have definitely bought another one.\n\nMy friend and I tried other things on the menu. Creme brulee gelato was too sweet. Tiramisu ice cream, on the other hand, was fantastic. Both scoops on a waffle cone cost a whopping $10. Ugh! We also had the nutella brioche. From afar, it looked yummy. The name itself drew us in. Unfortunately, it was not up to par with the awesome souffle crepe we ate a minute earlier. Tried their white chocolate bars as well. The secret ingredient must be crack because I kept chomping on it while we walked back to the hotel.  \n\nThe place is a spectacle. If you cannot dish the $$$$, at least go there to take picture of the world's largest chocolate fountain. Makes you think of Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. They also have ornate cake creations displayed in glass cases.\n\nTwo negatives about this place were the insane prices and workers. Talk about unfriendly b*tches. Seriously, they should get laid. While we patiently waited for our crepe, the female at the counter looked utterly miserable. Gosh, I would hate my job ,too, if I flipped pancakes over and over and over and over.\n\nBottom line:\n\nYes, this place is helluva expensive, but worth every cent.

Props to the crepe maker, who was working very hard and turning out perfect crepes each time. Right before I left for the airport I returned to get an almond croissant, because they have marzipan inside, but I wasn't impressed with that. I think the butter of the croissant gives the marzipan a greasier-than-usual texture-- no thanks. Might be better fresh, but not to pick up and eat later. Their coffee is good.\n\nA lot of people have criticized this place for the service. I would describe the service here as \"efficient.\" There is a constant line and they are trying to move it quickly. It's true that this was the least friendly service I had in Vegas, but these folks are (almost literally) like Lucy in that chocolate factory episode. They're getting my order right and keeping the wait time as short as possible, so I'm not going to require them to also act like they're delighted to see me. \n\nPrices are... Bellagio. The crepe prices ($11?) are fair enough for something that perfect, but I couldn't deal with $11+ for a croissant turkey sandwich. Still, you're not coming here to get a great deal. You just walked under a Chihuly ceiling and through a fantasy wonderland flower conservatory with a harpist.

I came here with a group of 7 for lunch. Not a lot of seating options, they have a couple of small tables but this is more of a place you order and take to go. They have variety of pastries and gelato you can choose from as well crepes and drinks. Their pastries looked so good! I didn't get any but I really wanted to because they were just gloriously sitting there waiting to be eaten.\n\nI got the smoked salmon crepe and a banana foster crepe to share. They both tasted great but for the price I paid, I expected a bit more. Both crepes are about $12 each and that's a lot for crepes in my opinion. The salmon crepe was delicious, they use a distinct sauce that I found quite enjoyable with the salmon. There was also asparagus inside the crepe that added a nice crunch, but i felt like that they gave too little smoked salmon. The crepe was mostly filling and I wanted more smoked salmon. The banana foster was sweet and the caramel was wonderful but I wished the banana wasn't so mushy because the entire crepe lacked any sort of texture. I also got a mocha and that was pretty standard. To finish off my meal I got a chocolate chip mint gelato and I really enjoyed that. Their gelato was smooth and creamy :)\n\nI did enjoy my crepes but for what they charge, I expected better. I'll be back again to try their pastries :)"

Chef Claude and his team are amazing! They created a delicious work of art, my party guests are still talking about it. This cake exceeded my expectations. It was adorable and delicious. I ordered chocolate cake with pineapple cream cheese frosting, it was PERFECTION. Best cake I've ever had! Picking it up was a treat because the Patisserie is beautiful and has the most amazing chocolate fountain and cake displays. The service is excellent.

But, don't worry, the staff is very good at moving it along.  I started out of the store and it didn't take long at all to get through, maybe 10 minutes or so.\n\nI was there around 10 in the morning, so more of a brunch time than breakfast or lunch.  I had a piece of quiche lorraine.  This was a good sized piece for about $8.  And, it arrives to you quickly after ordering.  I'll say, they need to work on the heating method.  The edges were quite hot, but the middle was near cold.  Not all the way, but certainly cool.  The quiche was very good, great flaky crust and good cheese flavor.  The outside had a nice crispness to it.\n\nThis place, as many note, is filled with sweets.  They looked fantastic.  The prices are decent for the strip, particularly since it's at Bellagio.  Worth stopping if you need a quick sandwich or snack."

My friend settled on the creme brule' gelato and I went with the triple chocolate cheesecake.  She enjoyed her gelato.  My cheesecake was so beautiful that I did not want to cut into it.  The cheesecake was covered by a white chocolate shell.  Once you cut into it, the cheesecake was really soft and yummy.  The graham cracker crust was difficult to cut into while walking and eating at the same time, but it was really good.

The first time for lunch and the second time for breakfast.\n\nFor lunch, I had a turkey crepe with spinach, cream sauce, and parmesan. While I didn't realize that this crepe would be creamy, it was so good, I didn't care what it had in it. It came with a great salad with some kind of creamy balsamic dressing on it - all insanely good. My husband ordered the same thing and we were both extremely happy with our choice.\n\nThe next time for breakfast, I had Quiche Lorrraine and my husband had a breakfast panini. My quiche was really good - it was unsettling how much grease it appeared to have on it, but when you were eating it, it didn't detract from the taste. Sadly, it made it way better. My husband seemed to like his breakfast sandwich, too. \n\nOut of all food options at the Bellagio, this one has the best value out of them all. Hands down. Come here often and you won't regret it!"

The entire sandwich is less than a foot long and is very light in weight, it's cut in half prior to serving, so it looks even smaller.  It isn't overflowing with meats or veggies.  One glance, and you'd think for $11, that I was a sucker.\n\nBut I'm not a sucker.\n\nThe flavors.  MAN OH MAN.  The FLAVORS.  TASTY MUCH?  Why all the sudden weird looks from passerby's?  Is there a piece of basil on my chin?  Sauce on my cheek?  Or is it because of the way my facial expression morphs into a kinky \"O-face\" every time I bite into that sandwich?  And the way my body slumps into the chair as I groan and writhe from culinary pleasure?  My think my head is GOING TO EXPLODE.\n\nTheir tuna panini was so good that this is where I'd go EVERYTIME I had hunger pangs during my most recent stay at Bellagio.  Good thing they don't close shop until midnight (although I'd prefer it open 24/hours!).\n\nIt's funny because I was so enamored with this little sandwich during my stay that I failed to order anything else here.  Next time, I'll be trying out one of their pastry desserts, breakfast items, and gelato.  By the looks of satisfaction on all the other paying customers who were snapping up the sweets, I could tell I'm in for more awkward orgasm-faces during future visits to Jean Philippe Patisserie.\n\nAnyway, a little bit more about the place itself:\n\nJean Philippe Patisserie is tucked into a small esplanade that connects the Conservatory Gardens greenhouse to the resort's convention areas.  Walking up to it is a treat in itself...its main focal point is what Bellagio bills the \"world's tallest chocolate fountain.\"  It's a sight to behold...a massive floor-to-ceiling high fountain system enclosed in glass featuring  flowing white and dark chocolate from multiple dripping points.\n\nThen of course, there are all the elaborately created desserts showcased  behind glass that look more like conversation art pieces than sweets meant to be eaten.  The pair of cartoonish looking giant 4-foot tall rabbits adorning the central work counter in their \"kitchen\"?  Yeah.  Both completely made out of chocolate.\n\nSo if you're passing through Bellagio or are staying as a guest, please, I urge you to stop by and pick yourself up one of their many choice gourmet sandwiches (along with some gelato or dessert too).  For $11, you get $75 worth of flavor."

Just really need to iron out logistics. \nFor all that Jean Phillipe always seems to have a hundred employees behind the counter, ordering process is slow and painful. \n On this most recent visit I came right before closing and stood in gelato line for good 10 minute because sign specifically said that's where I need to go for pastry ordering. \nLow and behold, that's just a gelato line. Pastry cravers, charge ahead and ignore the sign, you can order from an entirely different employee. \n Came back next morning and ordered my apple brioche in peace and quiet at 7 am. My party wanted a crepe. The menu advertised Duce de Leche- um no, apparently \"we haven't had that in a loooong time\". I am no crepe chef, but I can whip one up at home and crack open a can of La Lechera Dulce De Leche in a flash. Or...I could reprint menus. \n Anyway, the whipped cream machine was broken, so crepe orderers were walking away with a giant scoop of gelato on top of their crepe. They all seemed giddy and excited, so I guess it's a good thing...\n All in all- it's a fancy bakery that has everything going for it, but seemingly struggles with operations, which is inconsistent with an overall Bellagio experience."

            "review": "I think trying the gelato for the first time warrants a re-review. Don't you?\n\nAfter a visit to the fall exhibit at the Bellagio's Conservatory and Botanical Garden, I took a short stroll over to Jean Philippe Patisserie to check out their sweets and baked goods. The gelato is positioned front and center near the record-holding chocolate fountain. With the line not so long on a Monday evening, I decided that I had to try it.\n\nFortunately, it didn't cost an unheard-of exorbitant level of pricing even at a Strip hotspot. At $4.25 for a single scoop in a cup, $2 for every additional scoop (although one wonders how many scoops they can squeeze in), and extra for cones, you can surely budget for this selection of classic/safe flavors. I got in a sample of pistachio gelato before proceeding to order one scoop each of my go-to flavors, mango sorbet and hazelnut gelato.\n\nThe pistachio is that artificial almond-ridden stuff that resembles the cheap ice cream pistachio flavor, so I quickly forgot about it. The mango sorbet was nicely tart and rich in flavor, not too far off from the best flavored mango sorbets that I've had. However, it had way too many shards of ice crystals, suggesting some long-term storage issues that should not be present in a premium product. The hazelnut gelato was quite smooth aside from the untraditional but welcome chopped hazelnuts. Fortunately, that flavor was free of ice crystals. But perhaps the biggest issue is the gigantic gelato spoon that forces you to use just a corner or else plow through your dessert far too quickly. This has no place going with this dessert.\n\nThe almond croissant is still lovely, even the day after. Throw it in the oven for a few minutes if you want to restore the crunch or just enjoy the fluffiness and almond paste goodness alone. I also tried their palmier for the first time, which was also awesome and addictive. If you want flaky, buttery puff pastry with the right amount of sugar, this is the way to go.\n\nSo for those keeping score, it's a green light for baked goods at Jean Philippe Patisserie, and a yellow light for the gelato. Certain flavors will do in a pinch, but it's no must-go destination for gelato connoisseurs. As for cakes, chocolates, or crepes - maybe next time!"

Late night- wanted to see if they had macaroons or get some pastries....no macaroons, pastries that were left didn't perk my interest (fruit tarts, eclair).\n\nBro and BF got gelatos and chocolates. Took a bite of their pistachio- nice actually, robust pistachio flavor.\n\nWe got a crepe with just custard and chocolate and chocolates and a raspberry tart BF wanted to try as well. Crepe was good, I like that the chocolate wasn't overtly sweet milk chocolate, more like a milk and dark cross, but I don't think it was priced right for what it is. I spend a lot on desserts, but it's just a crepe. Chocolates good, I liked the coconut which I normally don't but it was subtle. Tart- Alright, there was a pistachio like cream on the bottom and it was nice, but the tart itself was kinda hard, berries were fresh and sweet. \n\nGot teas to compliment.- A-OK- just got standard greens, but were all premium tea drinkers and it doesnt wow like some of the selection at home (NO ready made tea bags, fine tea leaves).\n\nThey were yummy, but not like OMG Imma effing die this soo goood.  It was satisfying enough to curb our after dinner sweet toofs. \n\nOne big shtick I got about this place is that its circular layout makes it eye pleasing but it makes it a clusterfuck when it's busy. People just don't know where to go, they cut cuz they don't get if there's a line. Also since we were getting stuff from all their stations it was frustrating- the chocolate lady told us to order crepes from the crepes, and go to coffee to get our drinks, etc.....WTH?! Can't you ring up and charge us and ticket them our order to make?! I dont think she knew really what theyre doing....surely you dont have to line up 4 times, but whatever we just figured it's easier to split up and not confuse that lady even more.  Yeah, we 4 split up and lined up in each area. BF went to gelato, I got the crepe, brother got the chocolates and BF got teas. Crepe customers vicious, I had to tell someone to step off their order because they helped themselves to the front of the line. \n\nMaybe I'll try it again if I'm here or Aria when it's not busy, but by all means I will walk by and forget it if it's a busy cluster.

Not quite... but for me, pretty close.\n\nI have done the tourist thing and simply walked by to see the magic happening, but I had never had the desire to hop in line and experience the sugar rush. Luckily during my last foray, my boyfriend's little sister really wanted some gelato and we happened to be walking around the Bellagio. Luckily for her and my constant Yelping, I knew where to direct our group.\n\nAs I was sharing my gelato with the love, I decided to let him have some input. The pistachio was calling my name, but damnit, we just HAD to get the cookies and cream... I admit, I pouted a bit. We both enjoyed it... but yes, I am already planning my next descent into Vegas just so I can get to that pistachio! The dulce de leche sounded good as well. But back to our actual choice, it was thick and creamy and as strange as it sounds... not overly sweet. One scoop was not enough (should have gotten the second scoop!). I will know for next time... definitely a place I shall return."

This time I made sure we go to Bellagio JUST so we can try this place out.\n\nWell, it was around 10am and let me say, this place was packed. The wait for the crepes was 45 minutes and thankfully, I'm not a crepe kinda gal. I stood in line and marveled at the wonders of the perfectly created desserts, but since I'm not a dessert fan, I didn't buy any because hubby was feeling ill and didn't want any. I ended up sharing a turkey croissant and lil guy got gelato.\n\nThe cup of gelato was almost 5 bucks. WOW hefty! The turkey croissant was almost 10 bucks, but it was worth every penny. It was the best sandwich I'd ever had. The croissant had a touch of sweet glaze which added such depth to the lovely sandwich.\n\nMy friend bought a rose macaron for a friend and that friend said it was awesome so I guess their sweets are just as tasty as they are beautiful.\n\nDefinitely will return to this place again!!"

The only redeeming quality was their ginormous croissants and pastries. We had everything from the gelato to their crepes and even their pastry selection. (We were there for a week, I ate here a lot lol). Their crepe was horrible - I had the banana foster, and it was this gelatinous banana goo on top of a plain crepe. The gelato wasn't creamy and their chocolates were just bland. The lines were very long, the workers just seemed pissed off and it was very expensive. If I wasn't so lazy I would of walked over to the other gelato stand on the other side.

It's a brioche dusted in powdered sugar and filled with nutella. How can you go wrong there??\n\nNutella crepe - Good. I mean, it's a Nutella crepe. It's not as good as the ones I've had in France, but it's the best I've had in the US, so no complaints. I'd order it again since I'm addicted to all things Nutella.\n\nRoyal crepe - Good if you like creamy savory crepes. I probably wouldn't order it again just so that I could try more sweet crepes, but I recommend it to those who prefer savory.\n\nPain au chocolate - TO DIE FOR. It's everything a pain au chocolate should be. The croissant is flaky, buttery perfection, and there's just the right amount of chocolate in it! Now I'm going to have this hole in my heart where the Jean Philippe pain au chocolate should be since I won't be getting anything of the same quality for a long, long time.\n\nJean Philippe is a must!

Jean attracts lots of visitors because of its floor to ceiling, tri-chocolate fountain. It's really a sight to behold. All of their delicious looking pastries, cakes, tarts, cookies, cupcakes, gelato and sandwiches are on display for all to see. \n\nI came here specifically because of my buddy, Michelle \"Addicted 2 Key Lime Pie\" T. I wanted to try their Key Lime Tart so I could let her know how it stacked up to others we've tried. I also wanted to try their Cr\u00e8me Brulee gelato she raved about in her review. Well, I went to Jean two times and sadly, they didn't offer the Cr\u00e8me Brulee gelato on either of my visits. I was bummed, but that didn't stop me from trying lots of there other tasty items. Here is what I tried;\n\nKey Lime Tart (5 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=uRjFKrymgjFdvSpVWGqh0g\nRose Macaron (4 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=Okeoz6p_hXzhQNJkp7UEPw\nCoconut Gelato (5 stars-Best Coco gelato ever) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=CdlqoKs7fw1gWvtZzZSLfg\nWhite & Milk Chocolate Covered Strawberries (5 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=qcyB1tF3R-Lf8dO3mIVzdQ\nNutella Brioche (4 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=XEVABDOk1fHwdNozXC-Pvw \n\nAs you can tell by what I rated each item individually, I loved everything I ate at Jean. My faves were the Key Lime and the coconut gelato. The Key Lime had an incredible, flaky crust and the key lime filling was both sweet and tangy. The coconut gelato was phenomenal, as was the white chocolate dipped waffle cone it was served on. The gelato was loaded with real coconut shavings. \n\nPrices at Jean were not as high as I thought they would have been seeing that it's in the Bellagio, which was a nice surprise. The folks who work here are all friendly and the long line to get your treats moves quickly. \n\nIf you're in Vegas and looking for some great pastries and gelato, check out Jean. \nYo, Michelle, you better get to Vegas ASAP and get their Key Lime!"

When you're in Vegas you need to, NAY...MUST GO TO Jean Philippe Patisserie. \n\nThere are two locations that my husband and I have been to, the location in the Bellagio with the streaming chocolate fountain from the ceiling and the location in Aria. \n\nWe prefer the location in Aria since it is a larger location and has tons more seating. The Bellagio location is cramped with very little seating. But both locations have their draw so if you have the chance, visit both!\n\nThe patisserie offers an array of items from donuts, to crepes, to ice cream to coffee/espresso to gourmet sandwiches. I haven't had a sandwich from here, but we can attest to the desserts and coffee. Magnificent. Everything looks fake in the pastry cabinets! They're all so perfectly displayed.\n\nThe patisserie also offers pre-boxed confections that we've also purchased to bring home. They keep well and have traveled with us back to Florida without any issue.\n\nI'm deducting one star because of their ordering process. They have different ordering counters for different items. One counter for crepes, one for coffee and desserts, one for ice cream etc. etc. And while this does make sense to break up the crowd, most people don't realize what they're doing and tend to stand around clogging up the main entrance. So, more signage is needed in my opinion."

They have a nice selection of chocolates, crepes (sweet and savory) and gelato in addition to hot drinks.\n\nMy first visit I got a banana foster-like crepe and it was very good, especially the fresh whipped cream which melted into the crepe!

This made a good crepe into a mediocre crepe that was soggy.\n\nThe coffee is pretty decent - the perfect roast has a smoky flavor to help balance the dessert.  We made the mistake and also got a caramel twist without the whipped cream - it was bland.\n\nNote there can be long wait times for crepes - 30 min after ordering is possible since each is made fresh.  I would give more stars if more fresh fruit was used. \n\nYou can also get a pretty darn good crepe over at Paris near their buffet restaurant."

The almonds were slivered and not to many, just the right amount to have flavor in every bite. The chocolate chips were also evenly distributed and did not overwhelm the flavor of the croissant  at all.\n\nWe also ordered the coffee, it was great, smooth and full flavored, seconds were in order for sure.\n\nI took back to the hotel (for my after dinner dessert snack) a Chocolate/Coconut Macaroon. It was about the size of a golf ball.\n\nI'm glad it wasn't bigger because it would have been a shame to throw it all away, Sorry to say the flavor combo here just didn't work for me. Not that I like it very sweet, but the something was missing, maybe the flavor of the chocolate was too bitter, but I'll have to say personally I would not get this again.\n\nWhen we go back to Vegas we will definitely return here, there are so many more things to try. They also have Gelato, bottled chocolate from the fountain, Macaroons, custom cakes (large and small of all styles and ideas imaginable). It was all decked out in fall decor, the staff was helpful but a bit on the rude side.\nIt's a small shop so it get's really over crowded very fast, not much seating inside but there are small tables outside of it down the hall, but I think they are for the restaurant patrons? \n\nSo all in all it's a must try.\n\nTC"

I hop in-line with no clue what I really want.  Should I get the caramel filled muffin that looks so delicious, the chocolate croissant that I know I love, or should I try something new?  I opt for trying something new and though I don't tend to like scones, I gave the vanilla glazed scone a try... I figured if it was bad then I would save some calories.\n\nUpon the first bite of my scone, I knew this is what heaven would take like if it was a food.  The scone was dense but not too dense and it was moist and not dry or crumbly like many of the more commercially purchased scones can get.  The vanilla flavor was powerful but in a very welcome and appreciated way.

On one side you have desserts and the other side you have all different types of food, coffee, and beverages. In addition to gelato and crepes, they have a vast selection of pre-packaged items ranging from chocolate to cookies to rock candy.\n\nWe ended up getting 2 strawberries dipped in 1/2 chocolate/white chocolate, a snickers cake and the napoleon. The chocolate was good and the strawberries were ripe and delicious. The GF liked her Napoleon. She says it was light and not too sweet. It's basically like a vanilla cream wafer type dessert with a cookie on top? I didn't try it myself.\n\nThe winner for me was my Snickers cake. Caramel chocolate wrapped in a hardened chocolate cylinder. topped with some really tasty, toasted almonds and a weird marshmallow. It was awesome! It tasted similar to a Snickers but more refined and way lighter but so delicious. \n\nIf you're in the Bellagio, stop by and try something!"

Chocolate Fountain!\n\nOk, although there's more to this place than the Chocolate Fountain, the fountain really is a spectacle to behold.  The fountain is enclosed behind a glass case/barrier that stretches from floor to ceilling....yes you read that right, it's that big.  And so the liquid chocolate free-flowing goes from tray to tray and you can't help but want to just dip your finger and taste all the chocolate goodness....were it not for the glass separating you from the fountain.  And just for the record ladies and gentlemen, there is plaque of authenticity of some sort that informs onlookers that they are indeed in the presence of the world's largest chocolate fountain!\n\nAlright enough about the chocolate fountain.  Now let's talk about one of my favorite food groups:  Dessert!\n\nMy friend and I had just come from a happy hour and were at the Bellagio to view the Conservatory Christmas display and Bellagio Fountain show.   We were craving a sweet treat, so thankfully Jean Philippe was open!\n\nJean Philippe offers a wide array of sweets for those with a sweet tooth:  Crepes, smoothies, gelato, and individual decorative desserts are just some of their offerings.  My friend and I didn't want anything too filling, so we both decided to each order our own individual cheesecake.  Well, for me it was either the carrot cake or cheesecake.  He chose the oreo flavor, while I chose the plain with a raspberry on the top.  I'm a huge fan of cheesecake, and thankfully Jean Philippe knows how to make a GOOD cheesecake!  The cheesecake itself was encased in what seemed like a thin solid layer of white chocolate, that only added more to the anticipation of that first bite.   And it was definitely love at first bite I would say.  Although I was slightly jealous of my friend, since his cheesecake had an oreo crust while mine just had the standard graham cracker, I would say we both enjoyed dessert because it was gone in a flash.\n  \n\nTIPS:\n1)  There are seating areas within Jean Philippe or in the area adjacent to the Patisserie so you can sit down and enjoy your sweet treat.\n2)  Make sure you know what you're ordering or at least ask the workers questions BEFORE placing an order.   Example:  These 2 ladies thought they were ordering crepes when they actually ordered smoothies.  \n3)  The line can get long so just make sure to bring some patience with you.\n\nBottom Line:   Chocolate Fountain!  Wonderful Desserts.  Chocolate Fountain!  Great Selection of sweet treats.  Chocolate Fountain!\n\nNEXT VISIT:  I'm going to try their crepes."

And it was under $5 for a cup with two scoops of gelato, definitely a bargain compared to the other gelato shops in Vegas!   The crepes here are also delicious, but they are a tad expensive, about $10 if I remember correctly.   They also have a large selection of pastries, which are excellent.  My favorite is their chocolate croissants, it's loaded with chocolate, but it isn't overly sweet!  The butterfly cookies are also excellent.  I have tried their chocolates, which I cannot complain about.  They recently came out with a fruit jelly chocolate, which comes in a pack of 6.  These are excellent fruit chocolates and I would recommend them as a substitute to the regular chocolate truffles.   The prices for pastries and gelato and very reasonable and they taste great.  The crepes are a tad expensive and so are the chocolate varieties, but they won't disappoint you!"

They also have a wide variety of tasty, creamy gelato to choose from too (also reasonably priced.)\n\nThe boyfriend got \"Intense\" which was a dark chocolate mousse covered in a dark chocolate ganache. Oooh divine! There's nothing bad to say about this. At all. Ever. \n\nI got the Key Lime Tart. It had a white chocolate top, with some kind of lime flavored whipped cream, and tangy/sweet lime curd, and at the bottom was a shortbread cookie. \n\nI strongly suggest if you have a sweet tooth, and are looking for something exquisite, try and stop by here on your trip to Vegas.\n\n(Did i mention the gigantic waterfall of chocolates? It's beautiful!)"

I've had a few average things there too, which feel even worse than they probably are given the high prices.  Service tends to be slow there as well and it stems from a lack of an organized setup and an inefficient use of the staff.\n\nThis Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Bellagio is the original Vegas location and it feels very similar.  Like the Aria location, they feature a wide variety of beautiful individual cakes and pastries.  There are also lunch options, crepes and many packaged goods for gifts and such.  I like the setup at this bakery more though.  It is located far from the casino while the Aria location is right in the casino.\n\nI was only able to try the pain au chocolat, but it was good.  The pastry was flaky, crispy and buttery while the chocolate center was smooth and good.  There were many other nice looking items including a very appetizing looking brioche muffin-type pastry that might just rival the citrus pistachio brioche at Bouchon Bakery in Yountville.\n\nPrices were high, but that is to be expected given that this bakery is located in Vegas and that it features very nicely presented pastries and desserts.\n\nLike the Aria location, the service is very slow here.  Part of the slow service is caused by the long lines that this popular spot attracts.  Also, there seems to be a lot of indecisive customers, which is understandable given the wide variety of options you have here.  But the service does feel inefficient.  There seems to be a lot of staff, but the ordering and pickup process is not that smooth.  There were not enough registers open so even though they were taking orders quickly, the cashiers could not process the orders quick enough so the line really started to build.\n\nJean Philippe Patisserie is a great spot for breakfast pastries and their individual cakes also look good.  It might be one of the best shops in this part of The Strip for a sweet treat.  Unfortunately, the service (while pleasant) is very slow.  If that does not bother you or if you can come here during non-peak times, this Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Bellagio is worth a visit.\n\nBellagio offers complimentary valet and self parking."

And, knowing her to be a macaron connoisseur, I had to oblige and buy her a box. Because that's just not right to not have sampled all that is available to be had. I bought a box of 8 macarons and delivered them to the birthday girl.\n\nWe didn't actually eat them for a couple of days. They were surprisingly still fresh -- flaky cookie and soft insides. We tried the pistachio flavor. I wouldn't say that it was bad, but it also wasn't mind-blowing either. It was a solidly average macaron. I didn't get to try the other flavors, but I can only assume that they're probably about the same. A little sad, but I guess not every macaron can live up to be absolutely amazing.\n\nBoyfriend and I also bought a Nutella Brioche to share. The brioche was very light and very yummy, but it was the Nutella innards that made this treat. There's seriously just a pretty good sized glob of Nutella in the middle. Mix that with the soft brioche bread and the dusting of powdered sugar on top of it all, and you've got a delicious confection!"

It's the size of a thumb!\n\nThe first night, I tried the carrot cake because it looked absolutely beautiful and a Yelper below raved about it. Really, Courtney E? Maybe the quality control isn't great here, but this cake was not even *good*. I mean, it tasted like my 8th grade [public school] cafeteria. The carrot figurine was made with something nasty like fondant, or oh maybe cardboard. The white chocolate was sickeningly sweet, and the carrot cake center was way too rich. Cheesecake frosting was all right. \n\nI went back the next night (some people go to Vegas to party, I go to eat whatever not-disgusting things I can find, OKAY?) and got the gelato. Now we're talking! It feels so wrong for gelato to be that good. The dulce de leche is truly amazing, perfect balance of creamy and caramel-y, and the mango sorbet is fantastically bursting with mango flavor.\n\nBought a small box of truffles to take home (to the boyfriend who hates me. After falling off my bike and getting scraped up, I received not sympathy but \"Why are you such a pussy?\") Now I understand where Jean Philippe earns his reputation. Such chocolate, with perfect flavors like rich pistachio and smooth coconut. My only ask is that they make them with dark chocolate (although I suppose you have to sell to stupid tourists, because why would anyone truly cool spend their free time & money going to Vegas?)"

Equipped with a Crepe station and a glass counter overflowing with what looks to be art more so than food the patisseries are complex and rightly so.  Patisserie is Jean's claim to fame.  \nI gave JP's 5 stars.  Based not on the crepes, which are great by all accounts, and neither did i give the pastries consideration. These 5 stars are for making what may be the finest Croissant available in France or otherwise AND for selling the finest prosciutto panini I have had the pleasure of enjoying.  Here's the Skinny:\n\nThe Croissant : I have had many in my life, most have been pretty good.  I mean it seems a simple item right?  The croissants from JP reminded me that simple is sublime.  The crust was golden, sweet, & crisp.  The inside soft, warm, simple. If JP's was the Matrix the Croissant would named \"Neo\".\n\nThe Panini : JP does not make the prosciutto panini that is so, so, worthy of these 5 stars. Truth be told they just throw it on the panini press.  The sandwiches themselves arrive each day from somewhere presumably in the Las Vegas area.  Should I ever find out their origin said companies delivery boy will have an additional stop on his route."

Flavorful to the point some may find it too salty. It's salmon and expected to be a little salty, but just an FYI! All in all, it's worth the ap12! I'm stuffed!\n- Italian crepe. Tempting second choice as it has prosciutto on top, but it was surprisingly low in the flavor department. (Maybe it's cause I ate it after the amazing salmon crepe.) It you want something a little lighter in flavor it's the way to go.\n- berry crepe. Looks amazing. But in all\nHonesty, exactly what you would expect. I think you could get something like this at IHOP. If we come back, we suggested my nephew get something a little more unique.\n\nDo yourself a favor and order something that's not run of the mill. You won't be disappointed."

Before I returned this time around, I read reviews about the souffl\u00e9 crepe and I'm so glad I stopped by to try it! I got the one with warm berry compote and it was so light and amazingly delicious. I watched as they formed the crepe with ease. Then they took out a large disk of premade custard and wrapped the crepe around it to let it melt. Finally, they put a whopping amount of warm berry on top. I could hardly wait to dig in! The vanilla souffl\u00e9 custard in the middle oozed out and it mellowed the semi tart berry taste. What a perfect combination! I'm definitely getting this again when I come back."

The crepe was about $12 and for that amount, yeah, I want it to be less \"soupy\" and it would have been nice to see the cook stuff the crepe in front of me instead of crouching down into a \"fridge\" to wrap it up.\n\nFruit cup was average and the sandwiches were good, just way overpriced for a walk up joint. For the same amount we spent for this place, we could have gone to a French restaurant-but its good if you are just trying to order and go. The line is a bit long but staring and looking at the pastries and chocolate fountain can help distract the time.\n\nI personally wouldn't make this a destination but might consider it again if I were in the area.\n\nThey have a general seating area that is on a first come first serve basis next to the counter."

The husband and I decided to wander off and little did we know we bumped into Jean Philippe's. I have had their pastries before at a different location in Las Vegas but I hadn't had the chance to the see cool fountain. Saturday night was pretty busy and pretty crowded. Plenty of tourist in front of it taking their pictures and not being very kind as far as who's turn it was to get in front of it. You just gotta budge your way in and not care. Unfortunately I did care and wasn't ready to start pushing people around to get a picture in front of it but I must say, it is pretty cool! Its def really neat for kids to look at and for anyone to imagine what it would be like to get under neath it and just open your mouth and let that warm, delicious, fresh chocolate stream pour into your mouth and make your belly have a happy dance. Make sure you help yourself to one of their many desserts... whether it maybe a small cake, gelato or even a milkshake.. that will be the closest you will get to getting some sweet love in your belly since you aren't able to really touch or even taste the fountain (sorry! It's behind a glass window. It would be kinda gross if they just allowed people to dip random fruits and stuff in there. You know there would be that one person that will be smart to dip their finger in there hahaha-- back to the subject though). The place is a bit on the busy side though so make sure you have some time and take a seat near it and enjoy your sweets."

The best way to express my feelings at this moment is to describe it--I feel like I've taken a bite of heaven, and the sugar Gods are dancing on my tongue.\n\nI know.  You're wondering if I'm over exaggerating.  I believe that this place has the best brioche I've ever eaten.  The rest of the stuff is great, don't get me wrong.  The chocolates are lovely and creamy with the right bitterness to the chocolate, and their pastries are light, creamy, and made with love.  Their gelatos are perfect and to add a scoop into a white chocolate-dipped cone is pure heaven.  But this review is given with thanks to that beautiful, lovely, edible cloud of bread known as their sugar brioche.\n\nWhat blows my mind about this brioche is the sugar crystals on the bread.  I cannot believe the texture on this thing.  First, you pull apart the brioche and you see how soft it is inside.  There are these beautiful crystals of sugar all around it that compliment the yeasty flavor.  The sugar isn't hard crystallized sugar, but some sort of cooked down and dried sugar that's broken up again and the brioche is rolled around in it.  The texture of the sugar with the soft interior is wonderful.\n\nThe cinnamon rolls are very popular and fortunately I bought the last one.  Their cream cheese is nice, and the roll looks pretty big.  Nice flavor, flaky outside, and sticky.  I love it.\n\nOverall, great patisserie and one I'll return to time and again.  If you aren't into the flaky croissants or fancy chocolates, steer clear.  Otherwise I suggest a sugar brioche, croissant, gelato, a few truffles and a cinnamon roll for a huge, sweet indulgence."

There was one person who had already ordered ahead of me so I don't know what the hold up was.

We were in line for 30 minutes, and not because they had tons of people in line, they were literally that slow.  So when you walk by and they seem super busy or packed, just know it's that they are super slow and not that they serve that many people.  Three people around me in line left before reaching the counter because it was that slow.  It could have something to do with the fact that \"charles\" who claimed to be the manager did nothing but stand around the entire time or it could be that another worker had a wash cloth and wiped the same three feet of counter not less than ten times and did nothing else.  The only person working hard was the poor lady making crepes.  Charles let this happen instead of doing the right thing and offering to help her.  Guess he's too good to do any real work or get his hands dirty.  The people in front of me were planningo on ordering gelato, but the first three flavors they requested were greeted with \"we're out of th0at flavor\" and then \"we are out of anything with nuts\".  This was interesting since Charles, you know the manager thad stood around doing nothing, seemed to be responsible for keeping the gelato bar full since he stood over it making a list of what was needed.  In all the time I waited, he never brought any of them out though.\n\nFinally, I get to the front of the line and I ask Charles if he is a manager.  He answere \"yes\" but kept his head down and wouldn't even look at me.  Guess he's too good to interact with customers too.  When I told him I felt the service was really bad and that I didn't appreciate that someone that handled money without washing their hands was now handling the overpriced pasteries I ordered, he didn't even respond.  I kid you not.  He was three feet in front of me and he literally pretended not to hear or see me even though he actually replied to my first question (without looking at me).  He should have just said \"f*ck you\" to me so at least I didn't hold my breath waiting for a  response.\n\nI wish I had an opinion about the food, but the experience was so horrible and dealing with Charles was so insulting that I didn't even eat what I ordered.  I gave it to my kids (of course after I made them give me fresh ones because of the ones they first tried to give me with nasty dirty hands)."

These desserts taste as beautiful as they appear.\n\nWe ordered 3 desserts (a triple chocolate mousse, the Snickers-inspired dessert, and some other one), the ones that hadn't been sold out yet. Even though they were the less popular leftovers of the day, they were all divine, in particular the Snickers dessert (which really did taste like a Snickers bar!). I can only imagine what their more popular desserts taste like. Their crepe station and gelato are also very popular, but unfortunately we weren't able to try them. If I ever come back, there WILL be daily visits.\n\nIt also happens to be a very chic little store corner, with the famous chocolate fountains on the side. Of note is during our stay, the fountain actually malfunctioned and started spilling chocolate all over the floor. That was amusing!\n\nJust come here once (but buy some water from a drug store or something first)!"

There's 3-4 small tables wedged into the walls and some very small tables further down the corridor, but it's very much a take-and-go cafe. The curvy, bending mounted wall menu is hard to read when it's over your head while in line, so decide what you want beforehand. The lady taking the orders was pretty rude to me as well. I must've not heard her when she asked me what I wanted and she skipped to the person behind me. \"Excuse me, did you take my order yet?\" I asked politely. \"No.\" She glared at me. Whoa, alright, sorry. She left for a little bit, came back, sighed, and begrudgingly told me, \"Okay NOW I can take your order.\" Jeez, I'll buy some hearing aids next time. All other staff were pretty nice. \n\nI feel like I've listed a lot of cons, but it's not a bad place! It's a beautiful, unique, tasty cafe. The chocolate fountain is awe-worthy. It's hard to resist the urge to break through the glass and just drown yourself in the chocolaty waterfall. Lots of amazing, quirky, gorgeous cakes lining the walls so you have some eyecandy when in line or eating. \n\nOn to food!\nNUTELLA BRIOCHE // Simple and delicious. Soft, tender bread with Nutella injected right in the middle.\n\nBERRY SOUFFLE CREPE // The crepe itself was fine, syrup too sweet for my taste, strawberries weren't fresh, but OH-DEAR-LORD I just have to give the 4th star for the souffle filling. I think I've found something I love more than Nutella. There! I said it. If only they sold that vanilla creme in a double-pack from Costco. Only an inkling of public decency kept me from licking that plate clean. Would've been absolutely perfect if I had the souffle crepe sans syrup with fresh berries and dollop of whipped cream.\n\nSUGAR CREPE // My friend ordered this plain crepe and...it was no good. She hated it and she grew up in France, she knows what a real crepe should be like. It was filled with granulated sugar and sickeningly sweet. Skip!"

Servers are not very aware of ingredients for allergies (if your allergy is severe you may need to be ask a lot of questions)\n\nMy Experience:\nWhen I first went by on a Tuesday around 2:30pm there was a very long line. I decided to come back before we left. I came back at 4:35ish just when live music was starting in the conservatory and the fountains were playing. There was a small line for the gelato and pastries and no line for the crepes. There were lots of pastries available and all of the gelato containers had some in them with a few less than 20% left.\n\nThe crepe took about 10 minutes to be prepared. I got a savory crepe that I customized (because of an allergy to tomatoes and peppers) to include chicken, basil, pesto sauce, mushrooms. (I also mentioned that I wanted mozzarella but I didn't receive any) The servers went over my order and the two of them seemed to be discussing whether or not to charge me for an extra ingredient... one seemed to say no that would be the same as a regular order and the total was $12.95 with tax. I added a $1 tip to make it $13.95.\n\nMy buckwheat crepe was delicious and had a creamy pesto sauce (that I want to try to recreate), the chicken was spiced and my crepe was filled with chicken, tons of basil, and lots of mushrooms. The only downside was that I could tell that there were red spices in the pesto and on the chicken... which normally indicates red peppers of some kind, which I did tell the preparer I was allergic to, but wasn't pushy about. (I am not deathly allergic it just causes my eczema the flare significantly which causes me a lot of pain. And the pesto was soo good it is kinda worth it...)\n\nAll of the small tables were in use but there was a large table and I asked a man for a chair he wasn't using, my 14 month old stood on the chair next to me and ate pieces I cut off for her, she thoroughly-enjoyed the crepe too. We left very satisfied... and had no room left for a pastry... which I decided to save for our next trip but I am regretting.... I want one very badly right now...."

The crepe took a while to make, I felt like I was waiting 15 min, which is really long for ... a crepe. Anyways, not the best savoury crepe I've had but the pesto and prosciutto was nice. Kind of thin but a filing crepe. The almond croissant was great except it was cold. This would've been the best croissant we have ever had if it was warm. Flaky, sweet glaze and something almond paste inside. A bit doughy inside, which I like, but husband hates. $4.25 for the croissant and $11 something so reasonable prices for a big name.

Sign says line starts on the right but to order crepes and omelets it is on the left before the cashier. There is usually a line of people waiting to get bakery items and chocolates on the right so you can bypass them if you just want to order an omelet. Had the ham and cheese omelet and coffee that came to around $16. Omelet I think was around $13 and $3 for the coffee. They make to order and you can actually see them making your omelette or crepe. The omelet was large and plenty for breakfast. Not sure how many eggs were in there and they seemed to have the eggs, ham and cheese preprepared in this plastic cup  and they just pour the contents on the grill. I would guess it would be equivalent to a three egg omelet. Eating there was much faster than going to the buffet but keep in mind the breakfast buffet is $19 so still the better deal. But it you don't want to do all your breakfast at the buffet this is a good option. The coffee as you would expect is French roast. There are tables at the corner and all along the hallway so not too difficult to find a place to eat. They serve on these thick plastic plates and the utensils are on the is shelf across from where you order the omelets."

The chocolate fountain at this patisserie is great fun to look at."

The only thing we requested was a white cake with cream and fruit filling, we left the rest up to the chef. What a wonderful surprise! The cake was not only beautiful but delicious! \nThe outside fondant was perfectly sweet and not grainy at all. The inside had layers of cream, cake and fruit. The presentation was top notch! \n\n2016/17 we forgot to order and stopped by to pick up individual deserts and were lucky enough to be able to get a premade cake. It was delicious as always!!"

I had about thirty minutes before they closed, so I booked it to the Bellagio.  The walk alone was delightful through Bellagio's breathtaking lobby of Dale Chihuly sculpted glass flourishing the ceiling and the patriotic themed flower garden that was just so pristine and impeccable.  \n\nI saw Jean Philippe's Patisserie in the distance, well actually, the chocolate fountain.  Whoa!  Yes, a spectacle that requires you to really look up to appreciate the magnitude of this Willy Wonka-like contraption.  I envisioned myself as Wonka character, Agustus Gloop (\"Let me in, I'm starving!\") and breaking into the fountain after hours and drinking my chocolate heart's content and then getting all sleepy and appearing the next morning inebriated in the window display like \"Chocolat\" character Comte de Reynaud (played by Alfred Molina).\n\nDespite wanting everything, I decided on Dulce de leche gelato.  Just brilliant!  Perfect texture and the flavor was probably one of the best I've tasted outside of Rome.  I savored my treat standing in the rotunda garden, relishing in a flood of sensory delights that are so abundantly Vegas.\n\n#Yelp 365:  044/365"

There was a huge chocolate fountain and many other statues--definitely an attraction for the kids!\n\nThe ice cream was pretty awful... For some reason it melted super quickly...even though we stayed indoors and it was pretty cold indoors. I think it has to do with Jean Philippe because I saw the server take out a tray of Cookies and Cream ice cream and it was already melting. The ice cream itself was alright--it was creamy but the flavors were average. Pretty disappointing, actually. Either way, I got my ice cream fix that day and I was a happy camper :P"

Anyway, I was recently in Vegas (my second home) and every morning and evening, I would walk past Jean Philippe.  Sugar junkie confession: I've tried most of his pastries and I've enjoyed every single one.  So when one of my local friends suggested breakfast here, I quickly said \"of course!\"  \n\nWe shared the Banana Fosters Souffl\u00e9 Crepes and the Prosciutto Pesto Sandwich.  Both were delish!  The sandwich was toasted and the baguette was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The crepes were AMAZING!  I love, love, love banana fosters and the crepes did not disappoint at all.  \n\nNow, the location with the chocolate fountain - well, that's inside the Bellagio hotel.  You can even buy the chocolate from the chocolate fountain (at least that's what the packaging says).  It's definitely a site to see if you're a chocolate junkie like me.  \n\nOh, a must there... their cappuccino!  I did a taste test by having a cup of Jean Philippe and then a Starbucks... the Starbucks cup did not even come close.  So if you're going to spend about $5 on a cappuccino or latte and you're in the area... just spend it here and not waste it on Starbucks.  While in Rome, right?"

There are individual desserts at a few restaurants that will challenge Jean Philippe, but not many. If you don't want to waste your calories on low quality, this is the place for your sugar fix. \n\nThe crepes are excellent. Okay, the crepe is just a crepe, but the toppings are transcendent. I tried the apple crepe. Apples, grape, and pecans swimming in a bath of cinnamon sugar. While incredibly rich, it actually seemed light and healthy. \n\nThe gelato was rich and flavorful. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e actually had br\u00fbl\u00e9e texture mixed in. It was a perfect blend of flavors and pure delight. The pistachio was also well made and one of the best I've had. \n\nThe pastries may not be as strong. Perhaps that is why they are in the back. I tried the Napoleon and was disappointed. The creme was fairly typical and the dough had an odd, bitter flavor (perhaps burnt). I was surprised and disappointed after the excellent quality of the other desserts. \n\nI have mixed opinions on the design of the store. The chocolate fountain was cool and it is fun to watch the crepe preparation. Unfortunately hundreds of tourists stop to gawk and photograph every few minutes. It is hard to even find the line. On the upside, if you find a table you can really enjoy the people watching."

The mastermind behind Jean-Philippe P\u00e2tisserie is Chef Jean Philippe Maury, an award winning French pastry chef who grew up in the South of France. Did I mention that he is the Executive Pastry Chef at the AAA Five Diamond Bellagio? I thought I should slip the \"AAA Five Diamond\" part in front of \"Bellagio\" to emphasize my point. ;) Am I the only one who thinks this is impressive?\n\nJean-Philippe P\u00e2tisserie has two locations on the Las Vegas Strip, one inside the Bellagio and one inside Aria Hotel. I have been to both locations, but only purchased desserts from the one located in Bellagio. All the pastries are made daily at his kitchen inside Aria, and delivered to the Bellagio.\n\nWalking into Jean-Philippe P\u00e2tisserie is breath taking, the interior decor is nothing short of gorgeous. What first catches your eyes is the life-size mannequin on a pedestal, wearing a dress fashioned out of chocolate, then your eyes wanders scans the interior of the pastry shop, where you'll see shelves full of chocolates and confections, even a wedding cake or two, then you look towards the entrance, where you will see a multi-tier chocolate fountain, supposedly the largest chocolate fountain in the world. Lastly, you enter the pastry shop, look towards the display cases located in the centre of the pastry shop... where you will find pastries and a large variety of desserts, beautifully crafted, and you know it is time to let your inner glutton out.\n\nI tried three dessert items: Raspberry Tart, Nutella Napoleon and Opera. The Nutella Napoleon consists of caramelized chocolate puff pastry, topped with chocolate creme brulee and chocolate mousse. The Opera is made of almond coffee butter cream and chocolate ganache. Lastly, the Raspberry Tart...  starts out with almond shortbread tart at the bottom, topped with pistachio cream, raspberry cream and stunning fresh raspberries. All three of these desserts were incredibly delicious and rich. The taste absolutely lives up to their appearance, if not exceeding it.\n\nHonestly, I need stop writing and let the photos do the talking, come to my blog to check them out! ;)\n\nhttp://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/09/jean-philippe-patisserie-bellagio-las.html"

The croissant was a little too dry and flaky outside, but the gobs of chocolate and soft, chewy interior made up for it. The crepe was a good size with quality ingredients and a nice side salad.\n\nOn the second visit, I got the ham, mushroom, egg and swiss crepe and almond croissant. The hard exterior of the crepe was made better by the soft, delicious almond paste inside. The crepe was better than the first one and was savory and filling - also came with a side salad.\n\nMy only recommendation is to change the ordering line up somehow because you order made to order items toward the very end of the line when you pass all the desserts and ready made items on the inside, and chocolates on the outside. This means that lookie-loos are in the way when all you want to do is order and get going. But that's my only criticism."

My last splurge was a grand total of $350.  I can honestly say it was worth every penny.  Okay, don't get scared - I bought a lot of pastries, chocolates, gifts, etc. Just to give you an estimate - prices are on average $3.50 for pastries, $10.00 paninis, $12.00 for clear packaged goodies, $30-70 for the very elegant boxed chocolates. \n\nMy most favorite thing to eat at JP is their chocolate crepe. You can see it in my \"profile pic\" I hope. I love how delightful it is.  Their whip cream is so light and refreshing.  They have this special chocolate sauce they put on top with pieces of brownie drizzled with some chocolate flakes. Perfectionnn! They make the crepes right in front of you, which is kind of cool. \n\nOne of my other favorite items is their tuna panini.  I've never had a better sandwich.  Their ciabatta bread is so fluffy inside and a little crispy outside.  Make sure you get them to toast it. \n\nMy other favorites are their french macaroons, chocolate croissants (to die for), cheese danish and bear claw.

The only downside is that this place is super tiny with barely any seats! They also don't have any bold coffee, medium roast is as strong as they have so you may need to add a shot of espresso like the bf did. \n\nEveryone gawks at the chocolate fountain drip as they walk in but my eyes fell in love with the gorgeous cakes on display! There are some very intricate cakes spinning in the cases along with the ready to purchase mini cakes. If I was about to get onto a flight, I would've brought one of each home!!! \n\nWe both shared an almond croissant and dulce de leche brioche. Wow, the almond croissant was a clear winner.. Crispy on the outside and perfectly balanced almond paste on the inside! The dulce de leche brioche was good too but really sweet with the gooey caramel oozing inside. ;) \n\nWe discovered another location in Aria so definitely check at least one of them out!!"

I had also tried the dulche de leche and nutella ones before, but they were a little too sweet, a little too heavy for me. \n\nSavory crepes: I highly recommend the Royal one. It has a nice creamy sauce that reminds me of chicken pot pie, and mushrooms and some kind of poultry (I forget).\n\nEach crepe is about $10\nEach pastry is about $6\n\nI like the nutella brioche... but the real winner amongst cakes is the Opera (OMG)!!!\n\nThere's usually a pretty long line... so be patient. You would love this place if you like to take pictures of food because everything is sooooooo incredibly beautiful!!\n\nThe location in Bellagio has a chocolate fountain, while the location in Aria does not. Both of them look amazing and serve the same amazing items. I have been to both and I am not partial to one or the other."

They have huge chocolate waterfalls outside, so it's pretty easy to spot as well as being an interesting thing to see in person.  It has a very Willy Wonka feel.  \n\nAs I mentioned, it is totally overpriced, (we paid more than $40 for a crepe, a quiche, 2 coffee drinks and a yogurt) but it's fun and it's good.

However, the sheer selection of pastries and sweet treats won me over much more than the chocolate fountain. As soon as you approach the shop, it's goodies as far as the eye can see! Well, the shop isn't that huge, to be honest, but dang if they didn't make great use of the space in there. \n\nEven with all of the different choices they had in there, though, we went for the croissants, and what a quality decision that was! We got a regular croissant and an almond croissant, but the almond variation completely stole the show for me. It was the sweetest, most decadent croissant I'd ever had, and I loved it. The powdered sugar on top and the sweet filling inside made for a delicious breakfast. \n\nWe also got a white chocolate mocha to \"share\", which was also good! Although, due to our lactose intolerance all around, it wrecked our tummies.

That's going to be an extra 2 hours to work that off in the gym for sure. ..but it's worth it!\n\nAm I the only one that finds watching the chocolate waterfall flow from one dish to another while waiting in line therapeutic? Thinking I should install a fountain like that one day in our home. At least watching that is fat free right?\n\nShop was crowded but line was controlled and I eventually figured out where the line to pick/purchase goodies started by the \"line starts here\" sign. NOTE: There are two different lines, one for the baked good, ie croissants and such..and one for the decadent treats, ie cupcakes, macaroons. Wait time can be short or take awhile depending on how indecisive the person in front of you is. Cashier was nice and pretty patient considering all the inquisitive and indecisive customer after customer(including me) he had."

It was incredible to say the least and I was able to buy a \"piece\" of the fountain to bring back home as souvenirs for my sisters.  I noticed that the chocolate was coming from the ceiling my noted this to my husband who didn't miss a beat and replied that JPP's chocolate must be coming from heaven. :)  Although I'm sure that this isn't the case, JPP's chocolate truffles really were heavenly.  However, the selection at JPP Bellagio is a lot smaller than the JPP Aria so I'll give this one 4 stars :)"

The triple chocolate mousse combines layers of dark, white and milk chocolate on top of a delicate shortbread cookie and covered with a decadent ganache and topped with a macaron. The description may sound like it's too much, but each component perfectly combines with the others into a symphony of chocolate pleasure!\n\nEven the simplest things like brioche or croissant are done extremely well. Break apart the brioche to find a caramel surprise that oozes over the flaky goodness. \n\nLive a little and indulge in a little sweetness."

Then we drove back to LA on a 6 hour drive.\n\nSome two hours later on the road, both my wife and my mother felt sick and had stomach cramps. The sickness and pain intensified and was at its peak sometime around 6pm. While my mother felt better by 8pm, my wife crashed on the sofa and got up at 10pm only to vomit. \n\nI apologize for graphic details but the point of this review is to alert the management to immediately check the quality and freshness of their products.\n\nI believe the salmon (which looked quite pale and was surely farm-raised) was not fresh. It could have also been the mayonnaise (or mustard mixed with it), or combination of both. I felt a strange metallic taste on my tongue when I was eating my own panini sandwich, which also did contain the mustard/mayo mix. In fact I still feel the strange taste in all of my mouth now as I write this at 10:30pm.\n\nDear management, please check the freshness of your produce, or the temperature in your fridge, or vendors you use, as our group poisonning COULD NOT have been a coincidence. \n\nI must also add that the personnel was noticeably nervous and irritated (and this is NO judgement but merely an observation). If they worked over NY holiday and had no chance to rest this could explain their cranky attitude. To say the least, this did not help the painful food experience at all.\n\nI hope this review will prevent further damage to other patrons of this establishment."

I tried their chocolate crepe with rum raisin gelato (added extra), which tasted amazinggg. It was the best crepe that I have ever had...and I've had many types of crepes before in my life. I also came back just to try their gelato, which tasted more like ice cream than gelato, but it was still really good. I also got their rose petal raspberry macaron, which tasted like heaven. They have such a huge selection of cakes and pastries, but if you come here, you MUST try their crepes!\n\nEven if you're not hungry, just walking into the restaurant and checking the place out is a treat too because they've got so many cool designs of cakes...even ones looking like the louis vuitton suitcases! The servers were also pretty friendly, and the stuff they use for the plates are also very nice looking.\n\nOverall, one of the best dessert places I've been to and I'd DEFINITELY come back the next time I go to Vegas!"

The \"Royal Savory Crepe\" made with mushrooms, grilled chicken, bacon and cheddar at $10.75 festooned with vegetables was especially yummy. Because I love chocolates, \"Chocolate Dessert Crepe\" is intense! and it is described as with \"intense\" chocolate fudge brownie chunks and whipped creme. The \"Berry Dessert Crepe\" is fruity. Lots of berries but marinated sweet and topped with whipped creme. Some other time, \"Vegetarian Crepe\" completes my vegetarian conventionality. Variety of hot and cold beverages curb my drink demand. In a contemporary modern stool-like seating area surrounding a circular bar where crepes are freshly made on a hot circular large flat plate surface by an efficient crepe chef lady. Cozy, classy place for breakfast, lunch, snack, or dinner. I just love crepes and it's here I can go for it each time."

Very addictive and roughly a dollar a piece.  They sell in packs of 10 and a tube of 20.  \n\nFruit salad - consisted of mixed berries, cantaloupe, honeydew and pineapple.

I absolutely love hazelnut, so I was excited to try the Nutella Napolean - it was the best dessert I have ever had, hands down! My boyfriend loved his eclair just the same, and the creme brule was also delicious which we shared since we couldn't decide what to get. \n\nI read previous reviews so I knew about the \"steep price\" but realistically, it's not \"steep\" because a regular dessert at most restaurants anywhere, not just Vegas, are around $6-8 each.

It had a creamy white chocolate center and some sort of peanut brittle even further in. Really high quality tasty pastries"

They close at 11pm, so from Paris hotel, we hauled ass to Bellagio to get my fix. The alluring sight of the chocolate fountain art was still accompanied by a line of people ordering last minute crepes and cakes. Ordered my gelato in a waffle cone, and about 8 bucks later, i was a happy MT.

Good variety of pastries, Crepes and of course, Gelato. They also offer a large variety of pre-packaged goods should you choose to take some with you when you leave (the peanut butter chocolate spread is exceptional!). There's always a line but it moves pretty quickly. \n\nPastries are $5-$8, Gelatos are $5 per cup (very generous portion).

There is very limited seating so unless you luck out you're likely taking it to go.  \n\nI would echo what some other reviewers stated about the organization of the shop - you really don't know where to get in line unless you've been here before.  It's not like you can't figure it out but when there are long lines the last thing  you really want to do is waste more time figuring out if you're in the right line while other people hop in front of you."

There always seems to be a crowd oohing and aahing over the flowing chocolate display, which is indeed quite mesmerizing.  I know I spent a good minute or so just staring at all the cascading chocolate and wondering how exactly the whole system worked.\n\nIn any case, the chocolate waterfall is what draws you in, but its the gelato, crepes, and pastries that make you stay.  We got some gelato- the pistachio and the banana.  The pistachio was just okay- they had whole nuts in the gelato, but they were a little stale and rubbery.  The banana, though, was amazing- full of rich, banana flavor with little chunks of banana and caramel.  All in all, the banana was, as they say, the bomb.  At $4.75 for one scoop and 75 cents additional for another flavor, the gelato was a tad pricey but not as bad as the gelato store in the Forum stores, which charged $6 for a small and $13 for a large (!).\n\nWe also decided to get some of the pastries, which looked more like miniature works of art than little cakes.  We decided to get the Imperial, which was some kind of insanely good chocolate cake with chocolate mousse, topped with a chocolate crisp, and covered with chocolate ganache.  The exact ingredients elude me, but they all added together to make heaven on earth.  \n\nBecause of my obsession with carrot cake, we also got their version, which featured a coconut/pineapple cream cheese frosting.  I couldn't really taste the tropical flavor, but it was still a delicious cake.  The cake was very moist and not overly sweet.  Decoratively, the cake was beautiful, featuring a ruffled white chocolate fan with orange accents, a little marzipan carrot and gold foil.    \n\nWhat adds additional points in my book is that they offer sugar-free pastries as well.  When we were there, they offered three choices- a fruit tart, a raspberry napoleon, and a chocolate cake of some sort.  We decided on the fruit tart, which looked beautiful, with delicately sliced and arranged fruit.  I'm not sure how it tasted, since my dad and uncle were the ones who ate it.\n\nOverall, a patisserie that features delicious baked goods, as well as chocolates.  While we were there, the man himself, Jean Philippe, showed up and walked through the cafe to the back!  Very cool.  I didn't get a chance to try the crepes, since we were full from the gelato and pastries, but those will be up the next time I'm back.  This place is definitely on my go-to list for Vegas!"

After taking a gander at the world's largest chocolate fountain (natch) and waiting in line for less than 5 minutes, I had in my hand a plate of the following:\n\n** A raspberry macaron stuffed with fresh raspberries and cream and dusted with powdered sugar.  I admit that I'm still a newbie in the world of macarons, but this macaron was delightful.  It had a beautiful chew -- not too tough or crumbly -- which played nicely with the juicy berries.\n\n** A chocolate, peanut butter, and hazelnut-filled cake lollipop.  This little package of bliss is as sinfully sweet and decadent as it sounds.  Another home run.\n\n** Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  As much as I adored the macaron and the lollipop, the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was by far my favorite.  While I have a history of tasting some underwhelming cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es -- whose burnt sugar top-layers taste like charcoal -- Jean Philippe manages to turn the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e top into a pristine pane of sugary glass.  It's absolutely miraculous to look at, and transcendent in both taste and texture.  The vanilla cream itself is also executed with care and skill.\n\nAs if these three desserts weren't enough -- they were all artfully placed on a base of pure milk chocolate.  \n\nYeah, we finished all of it -- including the chocolate base.  \n\n(Don't judge.)\n\nNeedless to say, my sweet tooth was satisfied.\n\nAll of Jean Philippe's sugar-laden works of art are brilliant.

It was okay... not my favorite crepe, but not terrible either. It had lots of ham and mushrooms and is topped with scrambled eggs. Something about the actual crepe itself was a little odd, the texture was a bit spongy.

There was a little green pistachio macaron on top one of their craft pastries, so I decided to opt for their giant rose macaron - bright raspberry coloured, the size of a hockey pick (approx). with raspberries and custard cream sandwiched in the middle, decorated with a dried edible sugared rose petal on top... pure elegance!\n\nMy first bite into this piece of artwork was soft, and well balanced - sweet, but not too sweet, and nice to have some real fruit as a part of the filling. The rose petal only tasted like sugar, so I left it. It was good to share with my friends as the portion for one person can be a little too much. The rosewater was subtle and although an acquired taste, I thought it was just right.\n\nThe gelato at JP is really something else. The silkiness is divine and the flavours are bursting with flavour and it seems like any flavours combined would still be perfect no matter what. Trying the oreo and the strawberry... I could not have tasted a better pair. If there was a whole tub, I think I'd eat it all. I don't know how the workers can resist!"

I had something called \"Intense\" - chocolate mousse covered in chocolate ganache on top of a shortbread-like cookie ($7).  It lived up to its name and was rich and dark.   My husband had gelato at both JP locations and said it was about the same at both - ok but not great.

The crepe was a nice soft texture and the fruits provided a nice tart flavor. I liked the sweet creamy coconut sorbet most. \n\nCHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRIES\nThe strawberries weren't sweet, but sour and the chocolate was really sweet. The white chocolate was too sweet for my liking and the dark chocolate would've tasted better with the strawberry if the strawberry wasn't too sour. \n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'll head over to Aria instead of waiting in the long lines here, but it doesn't hurt to look at all the pretty displays they have on the way out."

I believe that is inclusive of tax, but I'm not certain.\n\nYou don't really come to JPP for value.

The line starts out the front and you walk in a circle to each station to choose a dessert of your liking.  I picked up a strawberry sorbet.  It was actually one of the best ones I've tasted.  Yes my pick made it look extra messy but that was because I took the pic after eating it.  Yeah it was that good and delicious, I couldn't wait.  \n\nThey're known for one major thing.  Their awesome chocolate fountain display is simply marvelous.  White, dark, milk, just everything flowing down.  It was magical, it was beautiful.  My only sad moment was when I saw that the chocolate fountain flows were bottled up and neatly package.  It then dawned on me that I could not buy it because I was taking the plane home and no liquid is allowed.  NOOOOO!!!  It looked so awesome too.  The pain cuts so deep.  Oh wells I'm driving next time.\n\nAfter the sorbet and fountain part, we got over to the pastries.  Sadly they looked not that good so I opted to get two OJs which were pretty good.  I'm not sure if they are freshly squeezed but still very delicious.  I'd definitely return here again.  My overall impression of the place is nothing short of spectacular.  The main reason is the chocolate fountain.  I went to the other Jean Phillippe in town but only this one seems to have it."

The chocolate was amazing...probably some of the best tasting chocolate I can remember eating. Luckily they give you a generous portion of whipped cream to go along with it, so the richness of the chocolate doesn't overpower the taste of the crepe. The crepes were very light and thin, you can even watch them make them right in front of you too which was nice. Unfortunately the lady making them was a bit rude when we asked of the brownie bites had any nuts in them, but the crepe was good enough to overlook her attitude. \n\nNext time I come here i'd like to try the smoked salmon sandwich or one of their creme brulee desserts (there's multiple kinds). Maybe this place is a bit expensive, but it's Vegas."

Yes it can.\" \n\nWe came to that conclusion when we joined the line about 11:00 one weekday morning during our last visit to LV. So, if you're wondering if it's worth it as you walk by, we'd encourage you to get in line too. A line that actually moves pretty quickly as it snakes around the display counters of pastries, all nicely labeled so you know exactly what to order when you get to the order counter. (And here's a tip:  the line seems shortest at this late morning hour.)\n\nYou know what you've heard about he Almond Brioche at Bouchon? Well, they're good there, for sure. But based on my personal research at both places, I vote that Jean Phillipe makes the best one. Ever. \n\nDrawbacks are these:  If you're looking for a nice place to sit and enjoy your pastries, you're out of luck at this location. There are very few seats and you'll likely need to wander about outside and hope to snag one of the few tables that are in the Bellagio \"concourse\". Hubby and I were lucky to get one and happily offered to share our extra seat with another poor soul who was wondering about, as we had been, looking for a place to land. And if you or someone in your group uses a wheelchair, this is doable but awkward, the line and so on. \n\nWe're headed back to LV in a week or so and this time we'll check out Jean Philippe at City Center. We hear the options are the same and that seating and accessibility are better. But whichever Jean Phillippe location is best for you, be sure to stop in. It is \"worth it\"."

And when we found it...we sure were glad that we had skipped dessert at dinner. \n\nJean Philippe's is a feast for the eyes first. A beautiful glass fountain drizzling white, milk, and dark chocolate cascades stepwise overhead. A mannequin wearing a chocolate dress stands in the center of the patisserie, and breathtaking multi-layered cakes line the walls.\n\nThe pastry cases hold smaller marvels. We chose a trio with creme brulee, a raspberry macaron, and a cake pop that tasted like a gourmet snickers bar. To top it all off, the plate that the trio was served on was made of chocolate. Absolutely top notch!"

It's apparently it's the largest chocolate fountain and is even in the Guiness Book for World Records. It goes from the ceiling to the ground, but it's made up of a bunch of small shelves and the chocolate travels in different paths. There's a dark chocolate path, milk chocolate, and white chocolate, and they intertwine kind of, but they never mix. I thought it was a cool design. It's pretty awesome, and people would just stop walking when they saw it and pulled out their cameras. It was fun people-watching here too. After looking around the shop for a bit, we decided to get a crepe and some cakes. My friend made a good decision and got an \"exotic\" crepe? or something like that... it was reallllly good. The top was warm mango in a mango syrup, and the ice cream was coconut. It was super super SUPER good. Inside I think she said was some kind of berry jam or something? I'm not really sure, but the crepe was delicious. The coconut ice cream was SUPER coconuty and really really good. Twas my favorite part. We also got two different types of cakes. The first one we got was called Opera and it was like a 12-layer cake with all kinds of chocolate and coffee flavors. Oh man, I cannot describe to you how delicious this cake was. It was SO SO SO SO SO GOOD. I even ate the gold on top. The dark chocolate on top was super rich, but the layers were so moist and flavorful. Each layer was something new, so my mouth never got tired of eating it. The truffle on top was decent too, but the cake was the main attraction. So delicious. When I go back here, I'm going to have a hard time not ordering this again even though I want to try all the different cakes there. The last cake we got there, I can't remember what it was called, but it was chocolate mousse with hazelnut and banana flavors. The bottom actually seemed like it had very small pieces of banana in it. It was really good, a lot more refreshing than the chocolate one, a lot less rich, but still really really good. They used a carmelized banana on the top too. Not sure how they made it red, we think maybe just like a red cocoa powder? All the desserts we got there were really good -- my goal is to come back here each time and try all the different cakes there, because there were just so many I wanted to try. They also have other things like $22 marshmallows and good looking coffees and chocolates. Highly recommend eating dessert here. I can vouch for the crepes and the cakes being one of the best I've had."

From the outside looking in, the well-lit interior was small, with foot traffic evolving around the circular glass case overlooking a number of desserts that were on full display. We sat at the small counter to slowly fork into our treats once the bill was settled. The noise level was high, and the room was filled with anticipation. My eyes were much bigger than my stomach on this decadent evening. \n\nThe Triple Chocolate Cake ($8) was layered with chocolate mouse, thick milk and white chocolate cream, and toffee at the bottom for texture. It was the most decadent dessert of the night. The chocolate flavors were multiple and distinct, but also intermingled with a level of balance without it being too sweet. \n\nMy favorite of the night was the Lemon Tart ($8). It was made with lemon custard, vanilla meringue, white chocolate ring, and candied strawberry at the bottom. I wished the crust was easier to cut into. Aside from that, the refinement on all levels was unparalleled. The layer of candied strawberry served as a nice intermediary between the ingredients, but also cut through some of the tart elements of the custard. It was worth getting.\n\nThe Vanilla \u00c9clair ($8) arrived with cream puff dough, vanilla cream, and a thin piece of dark chocolate on top. Unfortunately, the cream puff dough did not taste fresh. I loved the vanilla cream and a touch of coffee to add a nice element of surprise. However, I did not think the price was worth the value, especially given our problem associated with the cream puff dough.\n\nSanti's choice of Pistachio Rice Crispy Ball ($3.50) came with rice crispy that embodied a sweet aromatic pistachio flavor that lingered and intensified along with each chew. It was delicious. I can't wait to try the strawberry flavor on the next visit.\n\nI also had the Ice Tea ($4.25) that tasted refreshing and clean, but over-priced for the size of the cup. Service can be confusing as there were two lines and a lack of clarity on the protocol. Overall, it was still a pleasant experience with a number of shortcomings. These shortcomings had to do with the limited selection of pastries available, freshness of the \u00c9clair, and price. In short, I find the desserts to be balanced in flavor, not too sweet, and made with high quality ingredients. I hope to eventually visit the location in Aria for a close up comparison."

Bf discovered that the window it's behind is made up or multiple panes with gaps in between.  Needless to say, we looked strange sniffing the choclate decadence through the gaps.  Hahahah.\n\nCrepe: got the nutella with strawberries.  Omg so good!  They were generous witht the nutella, the crepe was perfectly thin and they gave a generous dollop of fluffy whipped cream.  So yummy!\n\nBrioche -nutella and dulce de leche: to die for.  Will be aure to get some before i go home.  So much nutella dn dulce de leche in both.  Wish i extra bread, that's how much filling there was! \n\nRoast beef sandwich: bf claims was delicious.  Disappeared down his gullet before i could take a nibble.  I guess that says smthg?\n\nHot caprese panini: pretty good.  The sauce (pesto?) Was superb.  Bread nice and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Just the right amt of tomatoes ... didn't taste any basil ... and the mozarella was a little too chewy for my tastes but i did like how it stretched.\n\nOveall, really good place.  Going to try the chocolate and almond croissants everyone raves about soon.  Can't wait!!"

            "review": "Disappointed. \n\nI really wanted to love this place. Maybe I went in expecting too much? Maybe the local shops in San Francisco have spoiled me? Maybe the notoriety of their \"amazing\" chocolate fountain has become more significant than the actual product?  Regardless, Jean Philippe failed to make a fan out of me and my sweet tooth.\n\nDelectables: (1) Blueberry muffin - bland; not moist at all; I've had better ones from Costco and \"day-olds\" from almost anywhere.  Girl behind the counter recommended this over the blueberry danish (what would that have tasted like? rock?); (2) Triple chocolate cheesecake - sounds delicious; tastes average.  Dark, milk and white chocolate cheesecake with an Oreo cookie crust and topped with a truffle? Sounds too good to be true doesn't it? It was; (3) Veggie crepe - why did this taste like garden vegetable soup smeared in a crepe? I couldn't even tell what veggies were actually in there. I am so confused.  Side salad was A-OK though; (4) I did like the almond croissant. However, the ones at La Boulangerie are better, and half the cost!\n\nCoffee: SKIP IT! Paying almost $8 for a double iced latte is an abomination. There is a Starbucks at the Monte Carlo that will make you better (and predictable) coffee for much less.  If you must though, order two shots of espresso over ice (under $5) and add milk yourself.  Whole, skim and half and half are conveniently located just 2 steps to the side of the main pastry counter.  FYI separate (faster) line in the morning for drip coffee only orders. \n\nCustomer Service: Fast and furious, but generally good. One note though: Kevin, please lighten up. It's not all so bad!  Heavy sighing and eye-rolling when people whip out a credit card - requiring you to do an additional step - is not a great way to earn customer satisfaction points. I witnessed this on two separate days.  You work in a chocolate/dessert shop after all! Try a couple of truffles when the blood sugar gets too low :-)\n\nAmbiance: Chaotic (unless you get there at 8 am)."

And I must admit, I find it nearly impossible to visit Jean Philippe to see the fountain and not order one of the decadent desserts. \n\nJPP sells a fairly wide variety of items from gelato, crepes (sweet and savory), pastries and of course, boxes and boxes of chocolate. I have not had the crepes and have only had small tastes of the gelato... I go for the desserts, pastries and of course, the chocolates! I have yet to be disappointed by anything sold at JPP, even the drinks are delicious. \n\nJean Philippe is almost always busy, but service is always efficent and friendly. There is limited seating within the actual shop, you can find a lot more around the corner headed toward the buffet. Prices are high, as one should expect, it's the Bellagio...\n\nEven if you are not in the mood for a sweet treat (or a savory offering), if you are at the Bellagio, JPP is still worth a visit to see the worlds largest free-standing chocolate fountain. Chances are if you are anything like me, one look will instantly have you craving something sweet!"

The woman who prepared our crepe clearly had been doing this for a while and it was clear that she took great pride in her work with the skill and joy in which she prepared it.  Not over or under cooked, it was perfect.  Fluffy yet tender crisp edges and the fresh lemon along with the powdered sugar was perfect.\n\nWe also shared a Rose Macaroon and a Key Lime pie.  Both were divine.  \n\nThe Rose Macaroon was actually a raspberry macaroon with rose infused cream and fresh raspberries topped with a sugar coated rose petal.  The freshness of the raspberries worked wonders with the texture of the macaroons outer layers and the hint of rose flavor added another level.\n\nThe Key Lime Pie was stunning as well and topped with a lime green streaked candied top over the whipped cream and almond dough.

There is limited seating inside so I took my treat to a table just outside JP, right by the windows overlooking the pool.\n\nThe Bellagio was a crazy mess of tourists that day, but each bite of the dessert trio sent me into a state of total relaxation.  The dessert trio comprised of a mini creme brulee (with the cutest little silver plastic spoon), a raspberry French Marcaron, a Chocolate cake pop with a bit of nutella and caramel.  All served on top of thin plank of milk chocolate. This is so rich, but so awfully good, every bite to be savored.  The flavors so delicious and fresh, textures are perfect.

To the right of the main counter you will see a melange of chocolate cascading down into shallow glass ledges allowing the chocolate to pool and then overflow to the ledge below, somewhat like a waterfall. Random fact: this is the largest chocolate fountain in the world, Guinness Book recognized. Above you a train, and all around will be cakes, desserts, bright colors and delicious smells. And right directly in front of you, will be the Mr. Wonka of Crepes. Pouring, flipping and serving them up warm and neatly decorated. \n\nThis is how it works, go to the register (as the sign instructs) order your crepe of choice or other confection and wait until your name is called. Don't rush the bystanders and start shouting orders to the people actually making the crepes, that's not their job to take your order. \n\nThey have quite the assortment, we opted for: Bananas Foster, Dulce de Leche and Apple Walnut crepes. As we stood nearby taking in the production I realized that the crepes were not actually being made the way I've seen in so many places (my most favorite crepe place is inside Paris Hotel, Le Creperie I should have went there). My disappointment kicks in. Rather than fill the warm air crepe with the delicious choice I've selected. The crepe is folded and slapped on a plate and then the topping is what you'd anticipate to be your filling. So now I'm eating an open faced crepe. I would have much rather enjoyed my sweets neatly enclosed and dusted with powder sugar and served with a dollop of cream. It still of course have a somewhat pleasant flavor, but my palette did not feel completely satisfied, it was lacking a little pizazz. My bananas foster was a little strong (alcohol flavor) and the the sauce was a little runny for my liking. For the three of us to enjoy these crepes it was almost $35 and it really was not worth it, (sigh).\n\nI'd go again, but not my next visit. My next trip will include a stop at Le Creperie!"

I went on a Sunday evening and surprisingly, there weren't too many people lining up or buying but I can imagine the place does loop around. \n\nThe verdict:\nChocolate Cheesecake had a rich, overwhelmingly sweet white chocolate exterior. The mousse-like filling was too rich for me, but I love the Oreo graham cracker! It was a nice complement to the cheesecake. I like the creation just because it is different from most of the standard cheesecakes I have tried and this one tastes more moist, airy, and fresh.\n\nThe Imperial was my favorite just because I felt it was the perfect combination of chocolate, hazelnut, and crunch. Mmmm. This pastry gets my vote :) Try it.\n\nNext time, I have my eye set on the rose macaron and the nutella brioche."

The panini version is just as good but was on ciabatta this time (not sure if that's a new thing or the usual).\n\nChicken panini is a solid 3 stars\n\nButter croissant is a solid 3.5 stars - felt really airy and empty, but it actually had a nice fluffy and ample filling. The entire pastry is topped with sugar making it really sticky. However, that adds a nice sweetness to the croissant. \n\nThe desserts are really pretty and good renditions of classic French pastries. I'm a fan of their strawberry tart. Expensive, but so is all of the other non-ghetto food in Vegas."

I am not sure if it lives up to its description because I think everyone pictures the Bellagio water fountain but with chocolate, and it is not even minutely close to that. Still it is cool and record-holding, and it is right around the corner from the Atrium, so why not stop by and give it a gander?\n\nHowever, the real reason I love Jean Philippe are the savory crepes. I know most people go here to satisfy a sweet tooth and justifiably so, but I do not have a giant sweet tooth. I love the savory crepes. They are yum, served with a salad and a very affordable lunch compared to other Strip offerings. I always recommend it as a quick, cheap lunch for people staying on the Strip. I also have heard from a very qualified source that the fruit tart is particularly good."

I stopped a couple of times during my conference for a quick bite and in general, thought the food was decent. \n\nWhat isn't decent? Their ability to handle crowds/lines. It's a tiny space, lines always seem to be crazy long and they are slllllloooooooww. Disorganized too - there are a bunch of people behind the counter but they seem to be stumbling all over each other and not really getting people through the line. My real issue is that they know AM's are busy, yet everyone has to wait in the big line because there's only one register open. Why not open a second line for those who just want a muffin and a non-fancy coffee? That would speed it up for sure. \n\nOf course, when I pass by at night and there isn't a soul waiting, they have like three registers open. Great planning, right there. Also, I stopped when it wasn't busy and was told it would be 1/2 hour for a crepe - hard pass.\n\nIf you can actually get some food (they seem to discourage this) it's pretty good."

You can grab a pastry and sit and enjoy the great flavors.  The staff is also very friendly and attentive, you will certainly satisfy your sweet tooth here."

They have the outside fountains with their gigantic geysers of thunderous water rocketing practically into orbit. On the inside they have a giant chocolate fountain next to Jean Philippe Patisserie with tons of chocolate flowing like molten lava from exorbitant heights.  Everything else at the Bellagio is larger than life as well, except for the Patisserie.  I am completely dumbfounded as to why they would stuff Jean Philippe's into a tiny, extremely claustrophobic corner.  Whoever designed this shop, should have been boiled in chocolate and encased in its over tempered remains (maybe rolled in coconut) for eternity.\n\nChocolate and gelato are two renewable resources available all over Las Vegas and an absolute necessity for my times spent on the strip.  Jean Philippe has both of these resources along with buttery croissants, napoleons, crepes, and much more.  Their gelato is very good but I mainly go there for the chocolate.  Their chocolate patties are merely good.  Their truffles, on the other hand, are exquisite.  The exterior chocolate casings just might be the smoothest, creamiest, most delicious chocolate I have ever tasted.  The various concoctions Jean Philippe has contrived to fill these wonderful balls of culinary magic, in my opinion, are the most imaginative, blissfully decadent truffle centers of all time.  I can still see myself closing my eyes and basking in the incredible flavors of each heavenly bite."

The displays are stunning and made me run up and down the long cases, from the chocolatier section all the way to the napkins like a Mad Hatter. Even the napkins looked good.\n\nPistachio rice krispie treats. That was new, and though I didn't try it, I did have the Pistachio Dark Chocolate truffle. It was good, but my least favorite item, only because it was like eating pistachio Jell-O pudding housed in chocolate. Bill Cosby would have approved, though. The Earl Grey Dark Chocolate truffle, with the delicate, Chinese-font word \"tea\" printed on it was so good, I exclaimed after each nibble until it was gone. \n\nI also got a blueberry \"cupcake\" - which wasn't a cupcake really at all. Pro-tip: the exterior tan bottom? It's not edible. You know I found out the hard way. It was like blueberry cheesecake all around the outside, with deep purple cake in the center, intermixed with the vanilla bean cream cheese filling. Delicious, but after a couple of bites, it was too cheesecakey to me (not overly a fan of cheesecake) and passed off to my garbage dumpster--I mean, my friend. \n\nBut GOODLAWD. The giant raspberry macaron, filled with vanilla cream and fresh sweet (not tangy!) raspberries was unlike anything I have ever had before. From the sugared rose petal on top to the vanilla bean swirled filling inside, I could not get enough! May be on my top 10 fave dessert list now ^_^\n\n'Hope this wasn't tl;dr, but get your hiney over to one of the Jean Philippe Patiserries STAT. Pretend it's a slot machine that you can't lose on."

This location is much smaller than the one at Aria, but has a constant line for a reason: the pastries, desserts, crepes, coffees, and chocolates are divine.\n\nHordes of people crowd around to take pictures of the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain (according to the strange folks at Guiness), but I was more mesmerized by the fresh crepes, croissants, and cupcakes. We enjoyed a late breakfast 2 days in a row featuring pastries from Jean Philippe and wish we had stayed at the Bellagio longer just to have more.\n\n * Palmier - Flaky, crisp cookie covered with caramelized sugar 5/5\n * Croissant - Light and airy with a butter flavor to melt in your mouth 4/5\n * Almond Croissant - Filling Cr\u00e8me D'amandes; sprinkled with sugar & almonds 5/5\n * Chocolate Croissant - Jean Philippe chocolate + croissant = yum 3.5/5\n * Blueberry Brioche - Surprisingly addictive slice of bread with blueberries 3/5\n * Blueberry Danish - Light shell and heavy fruit jam heaven 4/5\n * Latte - Pick me up of espresso & steamed milk to start the day 4/5\n * White Cafe Mocha - Sweet mocha (espresso & chocolate) with White Chocolate 5/5\n\nThere are two locations and both on Yelp list Aria as the address when in fact the one with the chocolate fountain is in the Bellagio.\n\nJean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio was perfect."

Well I guess it's hard to deal with customers non stop during the day but hey it's your job. Anyway, my friends and I ordered three different sandwiches and they were all delicious. The salmon was fresh and tasted good. The chicken pesto was good as well. The only thing is that if you bring some of the sandwiches up to the room they tend to get cold and the bread gets a little hard. We also had the ham and cheese croissant; it wasn't very pretty but it was my favorite one. We got a side of fruit it was alright. A lemon raspberry muffin for dessert was nice and moist. It's hard to resist ordering everything on the menu when you're standing in line and passing all of the delicious desserts. It can get a bit pricey as well. For the three sandwiches, three coffee, one side of fruit, two juices, and a muffin was about $80. But I guess what do we expect when we order like little pigs. Oink."

            "review": "My review will strictly be on what I ordered:\n\nRose Macaron - Not the greatest, but probably because I'm not a huge fan of rose.  I think there was a drop too much of rose flavoring as it was overpowering on my palette. The macaron itself was fantastic without being too sweet as most tend to be.\n\nPeanut Lollipop - A total different take on a cake pop, which is amazing!  I love the genoise paired with the mousse.\n\nCreme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e - If you're looking for a typical creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e taste, look elsewhere.  This creme brulee is very deep in vanilla flavor with almost a deep caramel flavor.\n\nDulce de Leche Brioche - The brioche itself flakey, sweet, and buttery.  The top was nice and flakey.  What made this heavy was the dulce de leche otherwise the brioche was rich, but light.  In my opinion however, I've had greater tasting dulce de leche.\n\nKey Lime Tart - WOW.  Probably one of my favorites.  Just enough lime flavor without making your face squish up.  The lime curd was nice a smooth and the lime whipped cream was so fluffy and airy which helped to lighten the overall product.\n\nOVERALL: I absolutely adore Jean Phillipe because all of the pastries I've had are somehow full of flavor, yet always light and not heavy.  This is dangerous because that just means you can eat more!\n\nLike I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!!"

I went there three times during my four day stay haha.  It definitely gets crowded here with the long lines and small seating area.  Definitely have someone in your party go wait for a table and have them order for you.  They have a huge variety of coffee, pastries, desserts, crepes, gelato, omelettes, salads, and sandwiches.  It could get complicated as there are three lines.  The right side is the coffee and pastry line.  The left side has two lines (but they sell the same things) and they sell coffee, crepes, and omelettes. \n\n\nCARAMEL TWIST: I LOVED this coffee drink so much.  It was still strong, but not overwhelmingly sweet.  I ordered this every single time. WINNER IN MY BOOKS.\n\nBERRY CREPE: Not overly sweet and it's yummy.  Made to order fresh!  This crepe comes with marinated berries on top and a scoop of whipped cream on the side.  Perfect to satisfy a little sweet tooth.  \n\nMUSHROOM OMELETTE: HUGE omelette with mushrooms scattered around.  It does cost like ten dollars, but at least  they make it seem like they used five eggs to make it haha.  Healthy and hearty choice.\n\nGELATO: I only tried the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and mango gelato.  Both were good, but I definitely could only handle so much of each.  The texture was on point, but the flavors were both on the strong side.  Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was sweet and mango tasted a little too artificial for me.  \n\nALMOND CROISSANT: It was big and yummy.  Inside the croissant, there's a sweet paste.  I definitely needed help finishing it because I can only handle so much sweetness, but it was definitely good. \n\n\nThis place can get a little pricy, but what isn't in Vegas?  I also noticed they had another location in Bellagio too!"

I couldn't stop staring at all the beautiful desserts in the window. \n\nJust a little tip... take a look at the entire window before you get in line to order because you won't be able to make up your mind once you are on the spot. Everything looked amazing and I had the hardest time deciding what to get. \n\nThey have desserts, gelatos and pastries. I ended up getting a scoop of the mango gelato and the hubby got a chocolate imperial. Both were delicious. The mango sorbet was very vibrant, tart and flavorful. The chocolate imperial was rich, decadent and had a hint of hazelnut essence."

We'll definitely be making a trip back to eat here again. It's the only place to eat we have been to more than once. It's basically our favorite quick/relatively cheap/relatively healthy place to get something to eat. I have a feeling every Vegas trip we make, we'll be coming here to have a meal."

It actually tasted like creme brulee (I HATE how creme brulee flavored things taste nothing like it - it's worse than fruit flavored stuff that may or may not even be the same color of the fruit it is supposed to represent).\n\nHOWEVER, this is all about  the savory crepes they have.\n\nMy first tip off that I should avoid them was how there really weren't any reviews when I looked them up on the the ol' phone even though there were 400 + reviews for this place (a total of 26 when I just filtered them online - so clearly not what people come here for). The moral of the story is you won't be able to make any substitutions because they just microwave little bowls of the filler to put in that freshly made crepe of yours. So existentially you are buying yourself a frozen dinner - which is what it tasted like.\n\nYou also get a little blah salad to really round the order.\n\nConsidering the plethora of great food options in the vicinity I was really disappointed."

Their presentation is so enticing that your body just kind of forces itself to go inside and take a look. Of course, \"just taking a look\" is impossible when you're completely surrounded by SWEETS!!!!!\n\nI tried to really limit myself here, since it's not exactly cheap. Out of all the different varieties of desserts that they had to offer, I went with the pastry section because it was the most \"bang for your buck\". I was able to get two pasties for a little over $9 and devoured them way too quickly. At 8:30PM, the pastry selection wasn't really as extensive as the pictures on Yelp. I ended up going with the blueberry danish and the cinnamon roll, which were both really delicious. The blueberry danish was very rich in blueberry flavor and the edges were perfectly flaky. The cinnamon roll was also flaky, had a good amount of cinnamon inside, and was topped off with frosting. Not too sweet.\n\nNext time in Vegas, I'll definitely have to try their gelato or their cakes."

Located right next to the hotel elevators, I walked by it everyday and it's almost a crime not to indulge. Among the items tried: almond croissant, nutella brioche, sugar doughnut, vanille eclaire, macaron, crepe. There's a crepe stand on the side of the patisserie. The ready-packaged biscotti are also very good. My weight may have tipped the weighing scale over a little in the wrong direction, but it was worth it!"

Don't get me wrong, they're all pretty good. My boyfriend doesn't even like chocolate, but he thinks they're the bee's knees! The jelly is encased in this delicate chocolate shell. You pop one of these babies in your mouth, and with the first bite, the shell just completely breaks open to reveal this burst of fruit flavor. The chocolate is perfect. It doesn't overpower the flavor of the jelly, and it's just bitter enough to complement the jelly's sweetness. The jelly is tangy and sweet. For some of the more powerful flavors, one might feel overwhelmed by it, but the experience is over pretty quickly because the pieces are small. Besides the blueberry, I distinctly remember enjoying the lemon jelly as well. \n\nBoth times I have been here, the service was forgettable. I must have picked the right time to go because there was barely a line (perhaps, two or three people in front of me?). The first time, the woman who took my order had the most sour expression on her face. I almost felt like I was being a bother by ordering something. I actually felt a little guilty for making her walk to the display case to grab the chocolate pieces...The second time, the two employees started conversing, making me wait a few minutes. Finally, when one turned around, he seemed pretty nice. He got my order and rang me up, but he wasn't friendly or anything special. The price is also nothing to rave about at $2 a piece. But hey, it's still something worth trying!"

I didn't try the coffee myself as I wasn't feeling like coffee at the time, so that's really just hearsay. (But they have drip machines in the back if that means something to you.)

In 2007, I stayed at the Bellagio so it was convenient to come here. However, all the other years, I've stayed in different places so Bellagio was always sort out of the way. \n\nUNTIL!!!! They opened this in the Aria, the hotel I stayed at back in April. I was excited that I can come downstairs from my room and have my desserts whenever I wanted. Turns out I was wrong. It's closed early. Long lines and the logistics for lines are stupid. You go up to the counter and order, then you stand aside for 45 minutes to get your order, blocking those who are trying to order. There's a narrow gallery line for you to stand in, so not much space. Seating is difficult, you're standing there waiting for someone to leave, but everyone saves their seats and blah blah blah. \n\nFood is pricey here but I don't mind it, that's not my complaint, my complaint is that the food is small for what you pay for. We got a croque monsieur, my husband got some breakfast sandwich and we got macarons to go, it took over an hour to get! Our cup of orange juice was $5 and it was made for an infant, it was so tiny. \n\nSo I say come here when there's no line (But we stayed at the Aria and always saw a line here!) and later in the day. However, they close at 5, so make sure to not come here tooooo late."

I shared with a friend the \"Intense\" flourless chocolate cake and the Strawberry/Lemon Cupcake. Both were delightful.

There are so many things that you can buy here, but they're all not labeled so you'll catch yourself asking, \"What is this?\" a lot. Here are my reviews on the different products. \n\n1. Gelato (Coconut, pistachio, and mango) - Meh... Too sweet and rich. Half a  scoop is enough for me and I'm a sweets junkie. Also, the pistachio hardly tasted like pistachio. 2 scoops for me and 1 scoop for my friend = $9ish. \n\n2. Carrot cupcake - It was very weird. They baked it in a cup and had some kind of divider on top and topped it with dome-shaped frosting. It was tasty though. (They have complimentary candles if you need them). Be aware that they do not look like cupcakes so you will walk pass them without even knowing.\n\n3. Chocolate mousse - Very rich, but what do you expect? It's mousse!  The cupcake and mousse = $13. \n\n4. Marshmallows - I got it because my bf loves marshmallows and I had to try it because they were $22!!! Anyway, my opinion on it is that it's nothing special. Don't get it. \n\n5. Butterfingers - Yummy, but they don't taste like Butterfingers. The taste is not as distinct.  This was $18 and overpriced."

That was certainly the case several years ago when I visited their location inside the Bellagio.  This was the second time I've stopped at their newer location inside Aria, but this was the first time I purchased something.\n\nWhile my buddies were losing their hard earned wages on gaming devices and eye-candy dealers I decided to indulge in another sort of eye-candy taking a mid-day break here snapping photos of Christmas themed confections (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=DELXUM9BD2s0h4e37_gt5Q) and sitting down with an iced mocha (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=95AhWqWjCtxG36p8nBq7xg) and a slice of cake.\n\nI chose the Opera cake slice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=p5YuhVtND3noJCQ6mwU9tA) made up of liqueur-soaked sponge cake, coffee butter cream and chocolate ganache because it seemed like a safer selection than any of the other 20+ varieties of individual cakes, tarts, napoleons and mousses, and I really needed a shot of caffeine from staying up late the previous night and not catching up on my z's in the hours that passed.  I'm normally not a coffee drinker, but I do turn to it rather than to instant energy products.\n\nMaybe because my choice was safe, but the cake slice did not wow me at all.  The flavors all meshed together quite well, but there was no particular component to the dessert that gave it any \"oomph.\"  This was just a sweet slice of cake with, really, nothing special to it.  The cocoa covered truffle that sat atop the cake had an unusually thick shell and the center wasn't as smooth and sensuous as some mass-produced truffles I've sampled.  I actually enjoyed the bitterness and cold from my iced mocha more than I did the cake.\n\nMaybe it was better this way.  Next time I'm in Las Vegas and I walk past their beautiful desserts I know to treat it like I treat other eye candy.  It's better not to sample no matter how delicious or tantalizing they seem to be!"

I knocked off a star for the somewhat confusing layout (there are three separate lines) and you don't realize you're in the wrong one until you've already stood there and get to the front, only to be told you're in the wrong place. Great.  Since I wanted a crepe, they pointed in the opposite direction. So I jumped into yet another line and because of the layout, I wasn't sure if I was in the right place again (didn't see any crepes being made) so I ventured around the corner, saw crepe making and a register and stood there. And stood there, all the while being absolutely ignored. Finally, I asked if this is where I order and the unfriendly girl making crepes pointed to the line in which I previously stood. Kind of stupid since the menu can't be seen from the line so how would someone know what to order?? Based on a recommendation, I already knew what I wanted but had I not, that would have been frustrating. Seating can suck as well. That being said, the crepe was made fresh to order and was presented beautifully.  The display cases are gorgeous, packed full of every type of pastry and confection your heart (and hungover stomach) could possibly desire."

So we settled for a cute cheesecake covered in white chocolate with raspberries on top. I left the store while my husband paid. We got up to the room and realized that we didn't have any silverware. I went back and waited patiently in line to ask for some. I got up to the register and was completely ignored and never even looked at. I eventually butted in and asked for silverware. The woman very rudely told me it was at the other end of the store. I got my silverware and left. I took a bite out of the white chocolate and it was okay, but I when I got to the cheese cake part, it was very gross. NOT worth $9 for such an itty bitty cake. Both my husband and I took 2 bites and couldn't eat any more. There were raspberries in the middle, but they were also no good. I will most definitely never be back!"

The crepes are made-to-order. We opted for the exotic crepe ($11.50) - a warm mango and passion fruit salsa atop a soft crepe with a side of coconut ice cream. I wish the crepes were stuff with the salsa, instead of of just being poured on top. The ice cream itself was probably my favorite item on the plate. \n\nOverall, just an ok spot for crepes.

After some research online, i came down to 3 places that have them (or should have them according to online reviews)- Jean Phillipe, Payard Patisserie, Bouchon Bakery. To my surprise, only Bouchon had the best deal, biggest macarons, and the cheapest price (when comparing sizes).. Jean Philippe should be ashamed of themselves for even advertising the fact that they sell macarons. All they had was puny 6 tiny macarons in a bag (size of a quarter) for $10.. Same thing with Payard. As much as they advertise themselves, and as much aura as they create around them- shame on them too. They didn't have any macarons except for some puny little pre-packaged bags that was way overpriced..\n\nAll i can say, when it comes to getting real French Macarons in Vegas- the place to go to is Boucheron. Jean Phillipe, i give you the lowest score for falsely advertising what you really don't have in your shop. Shame on you.."

In the past decade we have probably tried everything on the menu! Needless to say the only reason we keep going back is because we love their creations.\nOn Saturday we were there with our 5 yr old son who is highly allergic to nuts. As precaution and matter of habit, every time we are in a restaurant we ask if his food contains nuts. We did the same at JPP (and this is not the first time we've taken him there). We got him a chocolate mousse looking thing (the patisserie shelves were almost empty and some items did not have any name-tags on them) and while placing the order asked if it had any nuts. The supervisor says, \"we don't guarantee anything\". That's the strangest answer I've ever heard. Well, no one one this planet can guarantee anything, but since the pastry doesn't have a name-tag and since you guys have made it can you perhaps tell me if it has nuts? Now the guy gets extremely irritated and tells us in a curt tone, \"no, it has no nuts, but we cant guarantee anything\". Needless to say we were very upset by his attitude but not wanting to disappoint a 5yr old we got him the mousse and left. This has to be the first time in 10 yrs my husband left without getting a crepe or some chocolate dessert for himself."

I thought it was going to be a long, tedious day - and in a lot of ways it was. But, some good came of it - I discovered this place.\n\nI'll be honest, I didn't get to explore this place as much as I would have liked to or get to try as many things as I would have liked to. But Jean Philippe was easily the highlight of the City Center adventure my girlfriend went on.\n\nThe place is essentially split into several sections - a gelato area, an area that sells individual chocolate squares, an area that sells some packaged goods, and an area selling deli-type food items and other desserts, including eclairs. The place is fairly large, and even has a small dining area set aside. \n\nAs soon as we entered the area that houses Jean Philippe and began looking at the types of gelato, the woman working was very friendly and even let us sample several types (some places I have been to tend to be stingy about this, so finding a place like this, in City Center of all places, was a breath of fresh air.) I ended up getting a cup of the Oreo flavor, which was just as good as it sounds. \n\nThe place has an excellent selection of gelato, food items, chocolate squares, and everything in between. High prices ($2 per individual chocolate square) and the fact that you have to go through the trouble of going through City Center to get here are my only real complaints. \n\nIf you end up in City Center, whether willingly or not, pay this place a visit (they also have them in a few other hotel/casinos in the area as well.) It will easily be the sweetest part of your Strip adventure - pun most definitely intended."

The vast number of desserts for you to choose from will make any heart skip a beat!\n\nI came here for breakfast (they don't call it sin city for nothing! gotta live it up!) with a few friends and stood in line for about 10 minutes until we made it up to their cases upon cases of delicious desserts. We opted for a raspberry macaroon, a trio cheese cake (milk, white and dark chocolate cheese cake with an oreo cracker crust) incased in white chocolate topped with a milk chocolate truffle, and a scrumptious nutella cake thingy (sorry not to be more descriptive - look at the pictures to see why I was so distracted). All of the desserts were scrumptious, especially the nutella cake!\n\nBottom line, best. breakfast. ever. I love Vegas!"

I really love palmiers, so that's the only pastry I got from this place on my first visit.\n\nThe palmier from Jean Philippe Patisserie is the best palmier I ever had. It's flaky, crispy (still crispy even after being stored in the fridge for 3 days), and buttery. It's not too sweet, and not too buttery. They used high quality butter because the palmier doesn't leave any greasy/fatty aftertaste unlike some other palmiers I tried before. It's perfect for my taste. \nI regret I only bought two giant palmiers because I didn't expect the palmier is that good. I will surely buy more when I visit Jean Philippe Patisserie next time.\n\nI like the location in ARIA better than the one in Bellagio. It's more spacious. The decor is so modern, and it has lots of seating area.\n\nAt both locations (ARIA and Bellagio), I saw people lining up at their crepes station. I bet their crepes are delicious, so I will also get their crepes next time."

Well that really just depends on what you are craving. Hotter than Pompeii outside and just as dangerous? I'd possibly recommend one of the many amazing gelatos they make from scratch. Or did you just wake up with a massive hangover after having a girls night out at one of the nightclubs? Croissant and coffee would make the day a little better.

Doesn't help that I see this place before going up to my room at Aria.\n\nBerry crepe - marinated berries over their sweet crepe and served with whipped cream. The raspberries are added on fresh though. Berries are lightly sweet and tart. I don't like cooked strawberries so I will order it with fresh berries next time. As always, the crepe texture is perfect, slightly chewy, flavorful, and thin.\n\nSmoke salmon sandwich - after reading on Yelp this is THE sandwich to get, I tried it and it lived up to its reputation. This is a cold sandwich (why wouldn't it be with the cold smoked salmon?). The bread is a dill infused bread; inside is a sliced boiled egg, smoked salmon of course, dill spread, red onions which I believe are marinated in some kind of vinegar mix. It's soooo good, the bread is so fresh, but beware and have gum or something after eating it - it's loaded with onions in a good way.\n\nChocolate nougat - my favorite candy from this place. I prefer it over their vanilla nougat as the texture of more chewy. He never skimps on the nuts. Surprisingly, it is not too sweet considering nougat is really just pure sugar.\n\nPistachio nougat - these are individually wrapped and has pistachio paste to bump up the pistachio flavor. They tasted really good, but I prefer the texture of their chocolate nougat.\n\nMarshmallows - they taste like those valentine heart candies from back in elementary. I'm guessing the alcohol in the vanilla extract lent a hand in this. I liked the raspberry flavor best. They are rolled in powdered sugar which creates a little crust all around. It's softer than commercial marshmallows and moist. Nice to try, but won't buy it again.\n\nI noticed this time they offer omelettes now, cooked on the crepe machine, but I didn't try it.\n\nIf there is one sweet thing you try from here, get a crepe. Savory - go for the smoked salmon sandwich."

Nothing disappointed either other than the long line and inconsistency of the lattes. When trying to get out and about as fast as possible in the morning, waiting in a line for 15 minutes for a coffee and croissant is a little annoying. Also, when you're paying a premium for a latte, you kind of expect it to not vary in bitterness and creaminess from day-to-day. \n\nThe big demand on this little patisserie really puts pressure on the staff to preform quickly and accurately on each order. Little mistakes (like the lattes) are forgivable, and for the most part those don't even appear to happen often. Overall, I'm very impressed with how the staff handles the chaos of the morning rush. I probably would be tearing my hair out after an hour of customers changing then re-changing orders, continuous bumping into other staff, and the constant stream of white noise from espresso machines and slot machines. Props to all those who can handle it.\n\nThis really was a golden addition to Aria. It fills a very specific yet prevailing need of it's and Vdara's guest; better coffee then Starbucks and more food options. I can honestly say that without JP, I would have felt there was something lacking in my experience staying at Vdara."

            "review": "Oh Jean Philippe Patisserie (I hope that I have been pronouncing your name correctly), your desserts are visually appealing and equally delicious! Located in ARIA Resort & Casino, this dessert/bakery/chocolate shop is bright, beautifully decorated and definitely hard to miss; even if you're not in the mood for something sweet, your eyes will be drawn to the assortment of mini desserts or you will somehow convince yourself that standing in a long line for gelato will be worth it. \n\nI walked back and fourth in front of the glass cases filled with desserts for about 10 minutes, debating which was worthy to be my first. I had the hardest time choosing only one because every single dessert looked and according to their description card, sounded delicious. How do you decide between Tiramisu, Nutella Napoleon, Cream Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Snickers, etc.? I ended up choosing the white chocolate cheesecake, and oh my, it was amazingly rich and decadent. Once you cracked the outer shell, the cheesecake was very creamy and sweet; although somewhat pricey, it was satisfying and tasted exactly as I had hoped it would.\n\nI was in the mood for a sandwich but did not feel like making my way down to the usual Earl of Sandwich, so I decided to try the Basil Chicken from here. It was nothing out of the ordinary, but it was filling and hit the spot. Aside from the large selection of desserts, there were a variety of sandwiches, salads and other items that would cater to those without the sweet tooth.    \n\nI would often pass by here when walking back to my room and no matter what time of day, that gelato line was ridiculously long. I assume that there is a good reason for the constant line, so I hope that I will be able to try the gelato during my next trip to Vegas. The workers were friendly, efficient, and offered great recommendations to those unsure of what to order. I am glad that I was finally able to check this place off of my bookmarked list, you did not let me down Jean Philippe Patisserie!"

My husband wandered off and then came back to tell me that he already ordered our crepes at the cashier.  Ok.  So basically order whatever you want anywhere.

I ended up going there in the early morning before my flight.  It was ambitious as I was pushing it a little with the timing.  Luckily the Aria hotel was not too far from the Hilton where I was staying so walking was not too long.  It did take awhile to order and get my crepe but the cashier did ask me if a 10-15 minute wait for the crepe would be too long.  \nI did order the veggie savory crepe and did enjoy it but felt rushed trying to eat it.  I would definitely want to try one of the sweet crepes to see how those are also.  \nJPP also does have other items on their menu like pastries, salads, coffee, etc,.. so plenty of items to choose from.\nThey are limited with seats but it wasn't a problem finding a seat.  \nSince the Aria hotel is non-smoking it definitely helps in that you don't taste smoke while eating as the place is not closed off and right next to the tables."

He had studied patisserie from the age of 17 and is a former Gold Medal Winner of the World Pastry Competition, so I trust his recipes and training in kitchen staff. Nothing comes close to their laminated doughs such as croissants, danish and puff pastry desserts. Love the Strawberry Tart with flaky layers of crisp puff pastry, custard and fresh strawberries. All time favorite is the Raspberry Rose Macaron. Great textures, macaron is nice and chewy with perfumy floral notes and a rich vanilla custard filing. There are only a few macs I approve of and this is definitely one of them."

It does not come in a big portion but I never liked eating heavy meals in the morning anyways. \nChicken Cesar Salad- healthy and filling. The chicken is not your typical dry chicken breast flakes.

The cream puffs weren't that good. The filling made the breading outside too soggy for my taste. \n\nBe careful though as the prices do add up quickly.

Their service is usually great but I think this time around they were overwhelmed and getting two pastries took over 20 minutes and the line kept growing. During one instance, the cashier spent over 15 minutes just calculating a lady's total and packing her things to go (it started becoming a bit ridiculous). But I won't hold this against them as I'm sure they have new people to train all the time and they have a lot of customers; but then again,they should be used to it and need to come up with a better system. Overall a must while in Vegas but do expect a bit of a wait."

Note to Patisserie: I know it's late at night and even though you don't close until 2, you have run out of most of your pastries... but please, please take the signs out of the window for the ones that are missing! The longer I stood in line, (total 15 minutes), the more disappointed I got because of viewing the pasty item tags that weren't there that I was actually in the mood for! \n\nAnyway, we finally got to the man taking the orders and he just looked at us and grunted with a pen and pad in his hand. I stared back at him until he finally spoke and said in a rude tone, \"know what you want yet?\" (No, I have been waiting in line for 15 minutes staring at me feet the whole time. A little, \"Hello. How can I help you?\",  would have made all the difference - and by the way, when did we get off the plane in the east coast?) So I told him our Oder and I was debating on coffee, but before I could tell him, without asking if \"that was all\", he went on to the next person. I decided not to say anything and went to the cashier instead.\n\nNo hello from her either, or smile. She looked like she wanted to commit suicide and that being there was the last place in the world that she wanted to be. My hubby ordered a bottled soda and I asked her politely for a glass of ice water. She never acknowledged me or my hubby and went to get our drinks. She wasn't the brightest crayon in the box, because she came back with a glass of ice. I looked at my hubby and he shrugged. So I took the glass of ice, figuring that he could use it for his not-that-cold soda and asked her again for a cup of ice with water. She looked at me like she was about to murder me, than turned around to get it. I was pretty pissed. It takes a lot for me not to say anything, but I decided against it.\n\nWe got to our table with our desserts. The caramel chocolate thing was excellent, the fruit tart, not so much. I've had better at Portos Bakery in Los Angeles (my home). I would have returned here to try some other desserts later on, but won't, simply for the inadequacy of their employees. I don't excuse the lack of customer service for the late hour. I work for the airline as an agent. When you have a delayed flight with an original 10pm departure that's delayed and delayed, then finally cancels at 1am, passengers don't give a crap how tired you are and don't want your attitude. It's your job as a CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON to provide excellent customer service at all times. If you can't do that, get a different job.\n\nYou know, Airline agents are rumored to be some of the most horrible customer service personnel ever (with the exclusion of myself). So Mr. John Phillipe, thanks for giving us a run for our money."

Upon eating the fruit, my abs instantly firmed up. Some of their tarts have fruit as well, so it's basically the equivalent of the produce section at Whole Foods.\n\nNot to be outdone, every time I eat their gelato, I drop weight in my thighs and hips, whether it's their cookies and cream or hazelnut flavor. Perhaps it's because the portion isn't substantial (it's $5.75 for 2 scoops).\n\nI've felt my pecks expand just from looking at nutritious crepes being prepared - that's done far more for me than bench pressing ever has.\n\nBeware though, not everything here is super-healthly, as they also offer salads and a veggie sandwich.\n\nThe decor is stunningly spectacular. I don't know if I've ever entered a dessert establishment that's more enticing - it's like paradise for those with a sweet tooth. However, i think that leads to some viewing Jean Philippe more favorably than warranted. Since I stay near Aria often, this is an easy dessert stop for me, but I wouldn't go out of my way if I'm at another part of The Strip. I prefer Art of Flavors, Holsteins, and Bouchon Bakery, but Jean Philippe is a spot that you definitely have to see in Vegas."

I was in a bit of a time constraints because of the seminars I had to attend. By the end of my 3 day trip to Las Vegas.. I could not even look at a pastry. I ate 3 regular croissants, 2 chocolate, 1 chocolate muffin, 1 fruit salad and a cheese danish. The coffee had a bold taste.. just what I needed to get my day started.  Now about a week after my trip to Vegas, I am craving for the flaky crusts of pastries again.  Mmmmm..\n\nOne negative is the ham and cheese croissant that they offer in the morning. Ewww.. i didn't like it at all. It was way to cheesy. FYI, they only serve a limited menu in the morning, afternoon and dinner. \n\nOne plus that made up for the gross ham and cheese croissant, was that my husband had forgotten his debit card at the register. He didn't realize it until about an hour after he left. He went back to the counter and they knew immediately what he was talking about. One of the staffers said that he turned it into security shortly after he left. So my husband then went to security.. and after some ID verification he had his debit card in hand. Wonderful eh?"

On the strength of the first two items, these are two of the best pastries that I have ever had.\n\nThe almond brioche here is a circular item, unlike other places in which it takes a popover form. The softness of the pastry was like bread pudding. A lot of vanilla flavor going on here with a liberal amount of almond pieces on top.\n\nThe sticky bun on the other hand takes more of a hardworking approach. It is pretty massive with a lot of cinnamon flavor to it. I have been searching for a great sticky/cinnamon roll and found it here. Too bad that it is 800 something miles away.\n\nAs for the sable diamants. These were okay. These look like shortbread cookies, but the flavor in these is very restrained. For a cookie made with dark chocolate, pistachio, vanilla, cocoa and coffee it is missing a sweetness to them.\n\nAside from the cookies, this is a patisserie worth seeking out in Vegas.

One time it was huge flowers made of chocolate then it was sakura and a dragon (that was my favorite display so far).\n\nThey have sandwiches, salads, gelato, macarons, brittles, chocolates, marshmallows, cookies, pastries and yummy and pretty desserts!  You can order special/custom cakes.  They have a display of Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" which is quite scary actually and I doubt I'd want one.\n\nI've gotten macarons from JP.  They come pre-packed in a box with a plastic \"holder\" so you can actually transport/ship them without crushing the delicate macarons.  They come 8 in a box for about $2 each.  They're ok.\n\nLast night we had a Triple Chocolate, Imperial and another chocolate cake.  The labels were a bit off so we couldn' tell which one was which but we're sure about the Triple Chocolate and the Imperial which were amazing.  The Triple Chocolate has a green macaron on top - it's half shiny with chocolate and half matte with cocoa powder and inside is a chocolate mousse and I believe a white chocolate/vanilla mousse.  Then the Imperial...a chocolate sponge cake with hazelnut, vanilla creme brulee and chocolate mousse...mmmmm... My sister got the chocolate cake with a pink macaron shell on top - it was so not exciting that nobdoy remembers what it's called."

I'll be back next month for more cakes for a birthday. :)\n\nThere are 2 lines, one for quick grabs, the other for coffee, cakes, etc.  this line was lengthy but moved fairly quickly. I picked up a chocolate cupcake, red velvet cupcake, tiramisu, chocolate eclair, vanilla napoleon, and raspberry cheesecake. While in line I didn't feel right NOT ordering coffee, so I picked up a Caramel Twist (coffee with caramel sauce & whipped cream).\n\nThe cakes were divine. I enjoyed the vanilla napoleon. It's light & creamy, very flakey. The cheesecake was very creamy and smooth, the sweet coming from the raspberry sauce. My coffee was very fresh & had a nice roasted flavor. I did not have to add sugar which I enjoyed. Everything was lovely!\n\nWill definitely be back!!  The cakes I purchased were $6-7/each. Not for daily visits, but if you're looking for a sweet treat, try here. Well worth every penny!"

I am a sugar fiend, so I will get dessert pretty much every time I eat out. I would say that the raspberry rose macaron and fruit tart, while beautifully arranged and presented, are not worth getting. The flavors did not leave a lasting impression. The crust to the fruit tart was too thick. On the other hand, the savory items, especially the chicken pesto sandwich and crepe (if you like pesto) are a must try. \n\nIt is quite pricey, but I definitely recommend trying this place out if you are in Vegas.

Not only desserts, but delicious sandwiches and different salads.  My boyfriend and I shared a chicken ceasar salad and it  was so delicious.  Generous portions of chicken and just very tasty.  I did try a chocolate mousse with marshmallows on top and a hint of banana.  I would have bought the chocolate eclair, but I knew once I started I would not stop.  I bought my all time favorite which was the coconut macaroons and devoured 3 and saved one for my boyfriend.

However, the chocolate decadence dome shape dessert that I usually order is no longer the same. The chocolate wasnt as smooth and the overly sweet.

I was craving for some dessert and didn't want to pay an arm and a leg on the strip for some sweets. So, I went on to MyVegas page and bought a Crepe coupon for 10,000 points and I ended up saving myself $10! \n\nHow sweet was that!\n\nVery very tasty and it just melted in my mouth. I ordered the Chocolate Crepe with Raspberry sorbet and added some fresh strawberries.Mmm Goodness, I was in Crepe heaven, it filled me up to the point where I had to skip dinner. \n\nNext time I'm at Jean Philippe, I'll try those savory pastries and some sorbet while I'm at it by using MyVegas points to comp my meal."

The rotating layer cakes around the store and special Zarkana display, which are decorated extravagantly, are simply works of art. I was only able to try the Triple Chocolate dessert which is a chocolate mousse with dark chocolate ganache-like coating, white chocolate cremeux inside, and a chocolate filled macaron on top. Needles to say I was in chocolate heaven! The chocolate is so light and smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. If I lived in Las Vegas I would probably come every day. Sadly I will have to wait until next time I visit to try more of Jean Phillipe's creations."

The chocolate croissant is wonderfully flaky and layered with what tastes and feels like hundreds of thin buttery and crispy sheets of pastry that is unlike any other croissant I have ever had (including France and Switzerland).  It is the umami version of texture...layered, airy, and crunchy glory!  \n\nTwo or three wonderful pastries with some coffee/tea and have an indescribable experience here or you can go to a brunch buffet and stuff yourself silly with warmed food platters...choose wisely!"

But you really do get what you pay for - I wasn't disappointed."

Now I understand why the lines are always so long.\n\nLuckily, the line wasn't too bad for us because we went late (around 11pm). However, because we went so late, they were out of a lot things. Boo. So I recommend coming earlier if you want to get their entire selection. (I hear the croissants are TDF!)\n\nThey offer a variety of things like gelato, crepes, chocolates, paninis, sandwiches, salads, pastries, coffee, etc.\n\nWe settled on a prosciutto panini and nutella crepe. The prosciutto panini was delicious and we especially liked the bread - so crispy and buttery. The melted buffalo mozzarella cheese and aioli mayo made it that much yummier, too. The nutella crepe didn't look very impressive at first because it was so simple (literally just a layer of nutella inside with some whip cream on the outside) but it was SO GOOD! The crepe was made well and had this amazing chewy consistency that made me want more. Of course, at $9 a pop, I had to hold back. (Thank goodness our resort credits covered it!)\n\nSo if you're ever in Aria and craving a snack or dessert, I definitely recommend checking this place out. Oh and don't forget to charge to your room if you're staying at any of the Mlife properties because you get points for every dollar you spend at the hotels. It adds up quickly, especially if you're buying $11 paninis and $9 crepes. LOL"

Maybe the French are skinny because they eat these big healthy buckwheat crepes stuffed with salmon and veggies, leaving no space for buffets. The flavors were simple yet highly complimentary: a heartier dill cream to balance the savory smoked salmon, with chopped asparagus for an earthy dimension and crunch, and a blend of spinach/cheese/tomatoes borrowed from classic omelette toppings. In my opinion it's a bit too heavy on the cheese, but overall quite satisfying.\n\nAfter tax the crepe totaled to almost $13, which is reasonable for a quality (and ginormous) crepe. Note that the salmon and chicken savory crepes are the same price.\n\n*Be warned that the savory buckwheat crepes are very grainy to the point that it's almost bitter; you'll probably like this only if you like very whole wheat stuff. If you are not adventurous and/or do not have tastes of a health freak, I suggest the sweet crepes for a more familiar and fool-proof dessert. \n\nService was speedy and professional; it's fun to see them make perfectly flat, perfectly circular crepes and omelettes on the round girdle. While the food display has a clean look, the seating area is limited, uses an ugly marbled pattern on the tables, and faces the neon lights and smoke of the Aria's casino area--I much prefer enjoying my dainty Jean Philippe treats at the dainty Bellagio location."

You want sandwich go somewhere else like Earl of Sandwiches at Planet Hollywood or my newly discovered Cugino's deli. \n\nFor patisseries you have entered into French Pastry at its best. This is the ARIA LOCATION.\n\n+++SEATING+++ They have a nice area where you can order your food, pick it up and find yourself a table. We opted for a standing area with counter but no chairs for people gazing and enjoying view of the casino. \n\n+++SERVICE+++ Simple service, you choose what you like, place the order with the order taker, you are handed a slip and you move along the line, pay and get your order. I think the servers are as cold as French people, no smile whatsoever. Did I say I did not come here for the smiles? Hell, now you know!! \n\n+++THE SWEETS+++\nMy favorite was THE ROSE MACAROON. Soft top and bottom sandwiched with fresh raspberries, rose water, creme. This was a big hit. I would go here again just for this one. $7\n\n+++BLUEBERRY BRIOCHE+++ This was the least favorite. Blueberries filled pastry. The edges were very dry, the taste was kind of bland. $6\n\n+++OPERA+++ This was really good pastry. I thinks it was soaked in espresso syrup, coffee buttercream, and chocolate ganache. It was delicious but little too rich. $6\n\n\nThis was a good experience visiting Jean Philippe. I would definitely come back here and try more of other varieties and most likely the crepes."

You'll know you're close to it when you run into hoards of tourists bumping into each other because they are walking around with their cameras in front of them.   \n\nImagine what would happen if Disneyland imagineers decided to get  into the baking business...this would be the result.  Amazing fondant enrobed cakes in brilliant colors twirling around on tall sparkling chrome vines.  Brightly lit display cases filled with row after row of (fill in a superlative here) desserts.  \n\nFirst off this patisserie is an assault on the eyes.  Eye popping cake displays of Alice In Wonderland colors and movement.  If you eat with your eyes you'll be full before you get within four feet of the counter.  Once there you will be dazzled with art gallery-like pastries and chocolate desserts.  \n\nDiabetics must curse Jean Philippe as they load up their syringes for a suicide mission to the dessert counter.  I am a type II diabetic, but damned if I was going to be denied.  I choose a round chocolate morsel that resembled a chocolate dipped apple.  Even though it was only the size of a plum it satisfied the appetite of three people.  Devastatingly rich chocolate layers of mousse, caramel, ganache and nuts with I'm sure a good dose of butter and egg yolks folded inside.  So worth it for $7.

You stand in a longish line, cafeteria-style, at any given time of day and order from employees dressed in patisserie type uniforms as if this were a Disney joint. It is brightly lit and clean...far from any realistic Parisienne patisserie I might envision. We checked into the Aria three days before leaving Vegas because they gave us two comp nights.  JPP sits at the bottom of the guest elevators...which probably explains its constant flow of traffic: genius location. \n\nThe first day after checking in, I needed a quick fix. My husband wasn't fond of their $11 price tag for a sammie but it is the Aria and I figured this might be the best we'd get.  I wanted a ham and cheese croissant but they had \"run out\" so I got the turkey croissant instead. Holy fartballs...I will never ever ever regret paying $11 for it. That one sandwich alone made me (and my cheap hubby) a captive audience.  We went back repeatedly in the remaining 3 days we had in Vegas and literally having just devoured my last JPP bites, the thought of not having it again for some time makes me ache. \n\nThey offer this super cool service called Gourmet to Go. For $20, you choose a sandwich, salad, and a dessert pastry. You place your order before midnight the day before you travel and they pack it up in a hand carry tote box. Beats airline food by a million miles and considering the high quality and large quantity, I thought it was a pretty good deal. \n\nI got my turkey croissant again with a Cobb, and a Snickers cake. This was all great but the salad is packed really tight into a cup that can get a little tricky to eat without spilling. Still, i appreciate the portion size they managed to get in there.  The Snickers cake tasted exactly like a Snickers but I think there was about a 2mm sponge cake at the bottom.  It was more like a mousse than a cake. I'm not critiquing the great Jean-Pierre Maury at all... simply warning anyone who is looking for a cake in the Snickers cake.  \n\nThe hubby got a smoked salmon sandwich, Asian salad, and strawberry lemon cupcake. He ate his salad first, was saying how good it was, offered me a bite and before I could lean in to get one, he had finished the whole thing! From what I could see, it had nice sized shrimp and roasted red peppers in it. He did let me try his smoked salmon sandwich and his cupcake. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that they are the best I've ever had. Ever. Ever. \n\nAnd that seems to be how they do things there.  I bought a croissant there. It was $4! But it was life changing. Best croissant I've ever had. Ever. \n\nBest cupcake. Ever. \nBest smoked salmon sandwich. Ever.  Maybe best sandwich ever--definitely top 3. \nBest croissant. Ever. \n\nI can't wait to get back to Jean-Phillipe."

WHAT THE HECK????\n\nFinally my husband spoke to her and complained and she finally said she would replace it (with a lot of attitude).

Whether you're craving something cold like ice cream or sorbets, something sweet, like chocolates, desserts, a pastry, coffee or a mocha, this is a really cool, hip, happening place to hang out! Everything here is just \"Yummy!!!\".  Jean Philippe Patisserie is located in the heart of Aria right off the casino floor. It's a cool place to just hang out with friends for fellowship or even people watch LOL. No time to have a seat and relax? Jean Philippe is also perfect for grab and go! Sometimes when I am on the run, I like to just walk through to satisfy my \"eye candy\" hahaha.\n\nThere are ample parking at the Aria parking garage. (Please note if you are parking, the MGM Resorts have started to charge for parking, unless you are staying at one the the MGM Hotels)\n\nBe sure to check out Jean Philippe Patisserie the next time you're in Vegas! Trust me it's that good!! :)"

I had the Opera (chocolate mousse type cake) and a vanilla eclair. THE VANILLA ECLAIR IS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!! The cream is on the thicker side and it's the perfect size for your buck! The cafe latte is very good too, smooth and creamy and perfect with the sweet desserts. \n\nSouvenir wise I got the coconut and chocolate macaroons, white chocolate covered pistachios, and coconut tuilles. Every single one of them was so good! The chocolate is such high quality and not too sweet. Gotta stop by whether you buy something or not!"

All of gelato & pastries are great, with favorites being the hazelnut gelato, strawberry sorbet, and the Nutella brioche.  Their coffees are good too, and much needed with the Nutella brioche, since it is just a brioche FILLED with Nutella. \n\nOf course, with it being a casino location, it is pricey, but quality-wise, very good.  Expect $5 and up for a latte and $4 for a pastry.\n\nIt is also close to the Vdara so if the market cafe at Vdara's not looking too good, make the short trek over to Aria for some legit pastries!"

That line starts by the display and gelatos and were 5 people in.\n\nNo worries, the line moved long and the cheerful crepe maker made the line pass fast.\n\nWe ordered the Black Forest crepe from the savory crepe menu, it had black forest ham, wild mushrooms, finished with chipotle drizzle and topped with scrambled eggs, and the Exotic from the sweet crepe menu which was a crepe topped with pineapple, mango, passion fruit, and a scoop of coconut sorbet.\n\nThe savory crepe was just that, so savory and wonderful blend of flavors. The exotic crepe was also good, the tartness of the fruits contrast against the sweet, light coconut sorbet.

French pastry chefs know how to do their desserts right.\n\nSame can be said about their cheesecake. See my photos again. It was beautifully shaped with a layer of chocolate crust on top. This was also one of the best cheesecakes I have tasted. \n\nI also tried a few flavors of their macarons (see photos), and they were also soft, moist, flavorful and everything you would expect good French macarons taste like.\n\nTheir gelato and sorbet was great too. Oh and so are their sandwich/wraps offering for when you are on the go.\n\nOther items I tasted: opera cake was rich and tasty. Vanilla napolean was so so but I never liked napolean cakes anyway. Chocolate eclair was not what I had expected. There was only a little, dense chocolate cream filling. It did not wow me.\n\nThey also have those standard items such as croissant, morning buns, the like. Then you can also buy chocolates here. With so much variety to choose from no wonder this location is always busy.\n\nDuring that week of conference at Aria Hotel, I visited here almost on a daily basis. Prices are not cheap.

I stayed at the Aria for a weekend and walked by Jean Philippe, only to see crowds of people in line in the store or at the actually bakery next to it. Because we only wanted a small, quick bite before the Viva Elvis show, we decided to try Jean Philippe since we saw people dining on sandwiches and salads.\n\nWe ordered the basil pesto chicken panini for me and the ham panini and good lawd, I think I ate the best sandwich on earth. The basil pesto chicken panini wasn't a humongous sandwich filled with loads of greasy fillers. You could tell they put care in their ingredients and how it's presented to you. The bread was lightly toasted and the overall flavor of the sandwich was delicious and not over \"pesto'd\". My date's ham sandwich was \"delicious\" for a ham sandwich that he thought would be a typical sandwich but he said they flavored the ham in some way  to bring flavor out. \n\nAfter watching people tempt us with their crepes and other desserts as they walked by, we decided to try some of their desserts. We tried the tiramisu which came in a little square shaped container and looked beautiful enough for a photo! The first bite had a savory cocoa, vanilla bite followed by a thin, spongy layer of cake. Thinking I had enough, I saw there was over a half portion left in the little container. That says savory!\n\nAfter a flan (which wasn't too great I hate to say) and a delicious espresso, we were off to our show. But one things for sure, next time we come to Vegas, this place will be a must stop for us!"

All the breakfast sandwiches and pannini have ham on them and the servers told me they were forbidden to remove the ham.

The cheese roll/danish is delicious!\n\nMy husband got the berry crepe as well, which was ok.  It was kinda tart and came with lots of whipped cream.  I've tried their savory crepes before- forgot which one, but they were delicious!  The crepes are about $10.95, kinda expensive for the size you get.\n\nThey have lots and lots of sweets and desserts!  Will have to try their macaron one of these days.  oh yeah, they have the cool-looking chocolate fountain!!"

The macaron is delicate and crisp and perfect and the fresh raspberries are delicious.

What caught my attention was their mini wedding cakes that we considered as an extra novelty gift for some friends of our who are getting married next month. The sell by date was 5/22/14 but the employees stated that they couldn't sell them (which I thought was admirable) but then soon after said that the label was a mistake as they quickly removed all of the packaged mini decorated wedding cakes off of the display shelf. They encouraged us to check out the Aria's Jean Phillipe Patisserie for a possible different variety of mini wedding cakes. NOTE #1 - the JPP retail store at the Bellagio was packed with customers!\n\nArriving at the Aria, I forgot my reading glasses in the room so I needed help in the microscopic labeling on almost all of their packaging - the font is the tiniest that I have ever seen. Our server was Andrea R. \n\nThough my wife and I were loading up our arms with products from their counters one at a time, I asked Andrea three different times to read the title only of the unique candies & cookies that I had never seen before. Andrea was getting increasingly bored and annoyed with my desire for CUSTOMER SERVICE so after the 3rd question of mine she literally walked away from my wife and I and walked around to the other side of the store to chit chat with the server who was the crepe maker. NOTE #2 - the JPP at the Aria had zero customers in the retail store side! When Andrea was finally even more bored with her conversation with her counterpart in lackluster customer service (sorry I didn't get her name) she came over and asked if we were ready to pay! I replied with \"No, I'm still trying to figure out what these things are\". And I went all the way around to the complete other side of the almost circle to the only girl of the three who was actually smiling to ask one last question.\n\nThe complete antithesis to what customer service is - and in a visually nice and hopefully quality tasting store - WHILE THEY HAD NO OTHER CUSTOMERS - and while we spent $129 on gifts!! I so thought of asking for a manager but knew that their couldn't be one managing these three young ladies and hoped and prayed that one of the three of them did not carry that title! And then of course, thank God for Yelp! SO sweat not need to ask for a manger!"

I had one strawberry that wasn't up to par with my freshness standards, but it was late at night so that's to be expected from a fruit tart around midnight.\n\nThe ones in Paris are much better, but when you don't want to walk that far, this place offers pretty tasty options. The only reason I rate this place four stars is because of the prices, but I guess that's to be expected from the strip."

Located in Aria, the place is classy, modern, and decorated with creative sculptures of sweets.  They serve freshly made crepes, sandwiches, salads, gourmet chocolates, gelato, pastries, and candies.  There are two sections, one is where you order sandwiches, coffee, teas, and desserts.  Second, is for gelato, crepes, and chocolates.  All the treats are displayed in glass cases and some are neatly showcased around the area. \n\nThere were so many choices, I wanted to taste everything! I stood in line and my final decision was to get the Sweet Trio.  They gave me a piece of paper then I walked towards the register to pay. The cashier took the paper then presented my dessert on a tray.  After eating, I went back to purchase more items, Nutella Brioche, chocolate Earl Grey, Dark and Milk Chocolate), Madeleines  and Coconut Macaroons.\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=G9xCjFxbWa2VxTgHS6XdXA&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mxqKFzxRuqhf7Q3AUt49Yg&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=PGAxMrxKhjo5yvdAHTvRww&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nrXOCccf6F1N_YbzqX-M9w&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6xC0L6gdE2-4-HxaXw91hQ&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n::Desserts::\nSweet Trio came with Vanilla Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Caramel Peanut Lollipop, and Rose Raspberry Macaroon. It was carefully displayed on a Milk Chocolate Tray.  Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was smooth and creamy, on top was a hard round sugar shell with white chocolate (I think).  The lollipop was coated with milk chocolate and white chocolate swirls; inside was sweet and spongy. The last one is the macaroon, it was small with tangy Raspberries inside.  I would get this dessert again!  Nutella Brioche tasted like croissant filled with Nutella.  The flavor of the Madeleine was a combination of butter and a hint of lemon zest.  It was also spongy and soft.  The coconut macrons was the best I've tasted, it was chewy, sweet, and the coconut was fresh.  The gourmet chocolate was rich with a light Earl Grey flavor.\n\n::Highlight::\nIt's official, this is one of my \"go to\" dessert place in Vegas! I was so EXCITED to be surrounded with different kinds of impressive desserts! There were several desserts I wanted to try, I saw Rose Macaroon, Tiramisu, Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Chocolate Cheesecake, Lemon Tart, Raspberry Tart, Chocolate Cupcake, Strawberry Lemon Cupcake, Blueberry Cupcake, Snickers, Chocolate Covered Strawberries and more! I look forward to my next Vegas trip, this is where I'll be!!!!"

It was their birthday and we had plans in the evening so we wanted to drop something off before heading to the Elite event. \n\nI tried a bite of their desserts because I'm an Indian giver like that. \n\nMom in law has been on the search for almond croissants. It was very good, the croissant consistency is the best she's ever had she claims, but unfortunately not what she wanted. She's looking for ones with almond paste in it, this has a paste that is lighter, eggy. It was delicious, but I guess what she is trying to describe to us is probably Dutch/Swedish/German since they use the heavy paste. Never the less, I want more of this. \n\nWe also go some Blueberry Danish for grandma and it was very lovely crust and the blueberry filling was abundant but the right balance, not too sweet. \n\nThey shared a raspberry tart with pistachio cream on a buttery biscuit bottom and a nutella pastry. I like the tart- its the 2nd time I've had it and though its not my favorite tart in the world, this is not your usual kind of tart. I like that its not a usual pie pastry crust but buttery, cookie like goodness at the bottom. The nutella one is a must do! It was not too much nutella or a powerful chocolate flavor, it had such a beautiful balance and the mouthfeel with the smooth mousse, the chocolate \"wafers\" on top and a crispy bottom was wonderful. One of the best chocolate hazelnut confections I've had and I am VERY fond of that flavor combo. I was fuming that I didn't get another for my fatass to eat and not share. \n\nI bumped it to 5 stars because the service at this location is very good.Here the people were pleasant, asking if they can help, they were quick to keep the line going. It's sad that for a long time, I would not step into Jean Philippe because of our experience at the Bellagio one.  Bellagio was confusing, the service when we went was a clusterfuck and one lady wasn't very nice either- very curt. \n\nThis location has restored this place for me as a solid place to come and get a quality treat. Sure for some it might be deemed \"pricey\", but to me any kind of sweet meltdown will be money I'm happy to spend  and feel alright about going all the way down to the strip for."

Close to $7 for a pastry is ridiculous. I don't care how good it is - and yes it was good but not $7 good. I have eaten perfect pastries similar to this in Japan and even those aren't $7.  \n\nI was eyeing the Napolean but it looked like it had a little too much custard cream so I went with the fruit tart. It was beautifully deorated with raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, slices of apples, kiwis, and pineapple and some mandarin oranges. I know that Jean Philippe aims for quality over quantity and I completely respect that but the tart part seemed a little thin. This was my only complaint as the fruit was perfectly ripened and the custard cream wasn't overly sweet. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww\n\nI also grabbed a croissant which was $4 which was a better value than the skinny tart. It was buttery, flaky and oh so good with some homemade strawberry jam the next morning. \n\nWould I come back? Yes, of course \nWould I get the tart again? Probably not. \n\nI love bakeries especially high quality ones..and I know it in Vegas but I just wish their pastries were a LITTLE bit more affordable.

If you want to spend your meager gambling winnings ( less than $40), spend it here. Their almond croissant was buttery and almondy delicious.  Breakfast sandwich was full of hangover-friendly ingredients. Coffee was perfectly brewed and smooth. One thing which I regretfully did not get to try are their cakes and savory crepes.

During our most recent stay at the Cosmopolitan, we could not let the chance to try JP slip by, so we decided to come to Aria next door.\n\nHave you ever found your eyes sparkling as you come across beautiful dessert decoration? We were wowed. However, once we had our first bite of their Napoleon cake, tasted their gelato, and drank their tea. Disappointed? Yes, very much. Napoleon cake costs $6.90 per piece and it was just not a right dessert with flavors and texture that we were looking for. Glazed icing on top was hard and super sweet. The puff pastry was hard and heavy. The custard was thick and also very sweet. Very disheartening! Gelato was no where close to what I could buy at grocery stores. Iced tea was costly, like $4.95, and tasted like ... yea... I don't even want to go there.\n\nThe world revolving around spectacular chocolate fountains, elegantly crafted chocolates, and magnificent cake decoration ... keeps on moving and leaves no trace whatsoever of us once encountering Jean Philippe. I felt like we were duped by the whole extravagant d\u00e9cor and display.\n\nNever again!"

At Jean Philippe, they shove so many strawberries into the crepe that it's basically bursting at the seams like that movie where the Alien burst through the guy's chest and the Alien started killing people. I don't remember the name of the movie but it definitely had an Alien in it. I liked this crepe a lot.\n\nI've also got to give props to the nutella brioche and the ham/cheese breakfast egg sandwich on a croissant."

We literally went here every morning as it was conveniently located at the Aria hotel where we were staying. They have another location in the Bellagio showcasing their famous chocolate fountain, but I feel like the Aria location has much more variety because it isn't just sweets. This place has everything from gorgeous, handcrafted desserts, croissants up the wah-zoo, sandwiches, crepes, salads and even gelato. I think what I love is variety, there is something for everyone. I've tried the chocolate covered strawberries and they were divine. The chocolate croissant just melts in your mouth, it is so fresh and so scrumptious. My husband could not stop raving about the almond croissant as that one also looks so delicious. Taste matches some of the things we ate in Paris so Jean Philippe is definitely authentic french if you ask me. The sandwiches are all prepared fresh with so many different varieties, we had the ham and cheese croissant (can you tell we have a love for the fluffy, puff pastry?) and it was delicious with some kind of red jam and packed with fresh veggies. \n\nThe atmosphere is very cute, very modern and unique. It is always busy, no matter what time of day you come here as people are circling around Jean Philippe. However, the line moves pretty quickly and within 10 minutes you can usually order and get your items and hopefully find a good seat. This is a must go to for everyone and although the prices are a tad higher than your local coffee shop or Starbucks, you really get what you pay for as the quality is amazing! Everything is amazing and the variety of truffles is insane, and they are all so beautiful. I will definitely be coming here again even if I'm not staying at the Aria."

I probably stopped by here each time to grab a bite to eat. They have a lot to choose from here; crepes, sandwiches, paninis, pastries, gelato, coffee, salads, and so much more. This place is a bit expensive, but being in a 5 star hotel, I can't complain too much. \n\nI got the Italian crepe, which had prosciutto and mozzarella in it. It was sooo good. On another occasion, I had the prosciutto panini which was also good. They put a little bit too much oil and vinegar on it, so while I was eating it, I had to be sure to eat over a plate so that the oil wouldn't drip onto my clothing. I did try the opera one night which was very rich. I was a big fan of the vanilla eclair! I think I ordered it twice if I recall.\n\nThis might be more credit to the hotel security/staff, but one person in my group left their designer jacket here when we left late at night. Didn't realize it was lost until the next morning. Pretty sure the jacket was long gone, but I called down to security to ask them about it. Long story short, someone had reported the jacket as missing and handed it to the lost and found. The jacket was returned to us immediately and all was good in the world once again!\n\nTip: If you have a breakfast crave, head to JP instead of waiting on that ridiculously long and slow line at Starbucks on the promenade level."

You almost don't want to eat it. We eventually tried out both the pumpkin cheesecake and the triple chocolate cake. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, especially when it comes to dark chocolate, but the cake was good for a few bites. It was light and not overly sweet. I do like cheesecake, and I liked the subtle flavors of pumpkin.\n\nI'll have to drop by again on the next trip and try something different. I have my eye on some pastries and breads, perhaps some drinks as well. One thing's for sure, I'll have to win some more money at the blackjack tables to be able to afford more dessert!"

As I was walking toward it, oh my, I started having the \"kid in a candy store\" feeling, and the next thing I know, I was lured toward the food and pastry display. \n\nFinally a day later, my boyfriend and I shared a coffee and a Rose Macaron with Raspberry and Vanilla Cream Filling. Honestly, I wanted to try everything but since I couldn't just choose one, I went with my friend's suggestion. Luckily I bought the very last one in the display. \n\nThe macaron was beautiful and delicious. I couldn't help myself but admire it 360 degree before I decided to take my first bite. I love how it's not super sweet! I also love how they use pastry cream and not buttercream. The coffee was just okay. Oh man, must stop by again and try their other stuff."

What was worse was the fact the lack of customer service and apparently, they, too, don't know which line is for what. I asked the lady making the crepes in the morning where should I line up for crepes? She pointed at the coffee line which was extremely long. I waited for 20 mins and finally got to the register, the cashier made a face and told me I was in the wrong line. I try to explain, but she snapped at me and said, we never accept crepe orders. I felt bad holding up the line trying to explain the mix up. At the end, they took my order, but scolded me for it. It was extremely unpleasant experience being scolded for their incompetence."

Tried the ARIA location, the line is just as big, even at 10am! My boyfriend and I came to try to some breakfast...and couldn't pass up dessert while we were at it. We got a couple sandwiches, some coffee (chai tea latte for me) and a couple desserts. I tried the Trio and he got the red velvet cupcake.\n\nAlthough it was a bit of a wait, it was worth it. Everything from the drinks to the desserts were on point. It was a challenge to find a place to sit, but a couple ladies saw us waiting and got right up since they were just lounging.\n\nThe sandwich I got was the Turkey panini. It was juicy and the bread had a great crunch. All the ingredients were very fresh (the tomato was extremely juicy). I'm not a big fan of mayo but they mayo they used was delicious. Whole sandwich gone in less than 3 minutes.\n\nThe best part, of course, was dessert. The trio featured a rose and raspberry macaron, Snickers cake pop, and a creme brulee, all on a chocolate base. The cake pop was the most surprising as usually cake pops are a dry mess, but this tasted exactly like a Snickers ice cream bar! My absolute favorite, though, was the rose macaron. Best macaron I've ever had. I wish I had gotten the large macaron instead of the trio! The red velvet cupcake was different, but extraordinary. Every layer was rich and flavorful. \n\nEverything in this place looks delicious, I wish I could've tried it all!! It can get expensive once you start adding things up, but everything is worth the price it was given."

I originally fell in love with the Jean Philippe crepes in the Bellagio, but as soon as the Aria opened a Jean Philippe this has become my go to spot for a quick coffee, breakfast or even lunch. In my opinion the one in the Bellagio tends to be over crowded anyway. And minus the amazing chocolate fountain the Bellagio has, as far as everything else goes it's the same.\n\nThey have two different sections. One side is for the crepes where you can order sweet or savory and order coffee and different types of iced drinks. On the other side is a counter filled with different fruit tarts, pastries, cakes, and desserts. They have sandwich options as well that you can customize to your liking. You can have it to stay or go. There's a small seating area as well if you wish to stay and have a view of all the lobby goers place their bets at the slots and tables right across. \n\nI can't attest for their pastries much, since every time I come I have their crepes. But having said that if you are at the Aria do try their crepes! With fruit, ice cream, Nutella, etc. Eat your heart out!\n\nI'm knocking one star off this review because I find the staff to be a little short and rude every time I've been.

We bought each flavor.  I can't recall all of the fruit flavors, but there was raspberry, orange, blueberry, and lemon to name a few.\n\nOther must-try chocolates are the orange marzipan, the crispy chocolate, and the tiramisu.  I think those flavors are square-shaped, unlike the mascarpone truffles.\n\nAlso, try the World Champion Cookies.  They come in a box of 8 cookies and may be dubbed \"Praline cookies\".  They are rich in hazelnut flavor and topped with milk chocolate - yummy!\n\nJ.P.P. also has a good selection of gelato as well as decadent pastries and desserts.

The latino manager guy and the same cashier woman said it was not faulty, when I see the tiny little hole on the top, and the white color cap, they said, is a porcelain, and a good quality. I reminded them it is a polyurethane coated cap, and a mere aluminum body. They believed still because it was white, it was a porcelain. Their ignorance 1/5\n\n6. Later back at home, when I pour some liquid in it at home, because of the poor design, the lid leaks and squirt the hot drink through the mentioned hole, and the side all over.\nThey should never sell anything with faulty design, and it would become the safety issue if this was a hot coffee, and walking or driving with it. Simply you cannot put this in the bag. It leaks all over the place.\n-5/5\n____________________\nIn general, I think the experience in this Jean Phillippe Patisserie @ Bellagio was one of the rare \"annoying\" experiences at entire MGM hotels in Las Vegas, that I will probably remember,  If there is any negative rating allowed, they will get -2."

One place that always give me the happy juices flowing is Jean-Philippe P\u00e2tisserie. Something about the design and the colors of this bakery shop makes me happy. I have been to the Jean-Philippe P\u00e2tisserie in Bellagio, and was pleased with the one in Aria as well. Their amazing concoctions of sweets and pastries wowed me the first time around. The one in Aria though, they had a mildly different approach. Serving more food like items, including sandwiches and pastries, they had more of a variety here. Not only were their pastries and desserts delicious, their sandwiches were amazing as well.\n\nWe ordered the prosciutto mozzarella sandwich. I am a self proclaimed lover of salted cured meats, and prosciutto might be one of my favorite. This sandwich, though it could have used a lot more prosciutto, was a favorite. Don't let my greediness for more meet fool you -- it had plenty of it. The saltiness along with the mild and creamy mozzarella was a match so perfect and clean. The bread was a bit crusy for my liking, but it was still fresh and had a nice texture to it. The touch of basil inside was a perfect addition and made everything come together -- a good snack to share.\n\nWe can't go to Jean-Philippe P\u00e2tisserie and not get something for our sweet tooth. The white chocolate cheesecake was calling my name. It looked so nice and professionally made -- I didn't want to break the shell. Once broken into, the creaminess of the inside and the sweetness of the outside made for a nice treat. The round chocolate ball on top was the best.  It had a deep chocolate flavor and resembled something of a truffle and a moose.  It was a very delicious dessert and a nice indulgence.\n\nThe Jean-Philippe P\u00e2tisserie in Aria seemed more toned down.  Being more of a regular coffee and dessert shop, their sandwiches were a nice addition to the menu. Though it was larger than the one in Bellagio, it didn't seem like it had the glitz and the glam -- it surely didn't have the chocolate fountain of all chocolate fountains.

Here is a small review on each of the things we tried.\nFlan- completely bland and flavorless, came in a pie shell for reasons that I do not understand. Had a tasteless coating of gelatin to give it a shinny finish. Had a texture unlike any other flan I have ever tasted, if your version of flan is this far off, please don't call it flan. Save us the trouble, you lost half the battle by misleading us.\nWhite chocolate cheesecake- once again bland and tasteless, very creamy texture. Although very nicely presented wrapped up in white chocolate, the actual cheesecake is comparable to the Jell-o no bake cheesecakes that you buy as a kit at the grocery store. \nBasil pesto chicken panini- flavorless, and VERY greasy, expensive like everything else here."

The giant chocolate flowers are awesome and the ladies will love the chocolate high heels.\n\nI chose to get a very sweet strawberry tart. Although, the crust was too hard and sticky (I like mine more crumbly in fashion) it was good and sweet. The strawberries were very fresh and had a light honey drizzle with chopped pistachios on top. Inside was a creamy custard. If it weren't for the crust, I'd have given this place 5 stars, but that's just my preference I guess. Now thinking back it was a more jamm'um in your mouth dessert, than a fork and knife dessert. It was tasty none the less.\n\nAnyone who's a fan of desserts has to try at least one (or a few) of their baked confections. He has several other locations scattered throughout the hotels on The Strip. One I hear has a magnificent chocolate fountain.

Great place to take photos and bring a date, especially if she has a sweet tooth lol.\nAs for myself, I don't eat any of the sweets here because I'm on a strict diet, so I can't say much for the gelato ice cream and other mouth watering sugar fixes they offer here, but I did try all of the sandwiches and salads they offer.\n\nHere's a quick list to help you make your choices:\n\nPANINIS - $10.95 - All made with Ciabatta Bread\nTandori Panini - chicken/curry mayo/cucumbers/basil/tomatoes/swiss cheese\nTuna Panini - tuna/mayo/tomato/fontina cheese/spinach\nSpicy Chicken Panini - spicy tomato spread/chicken/swiss cheese/tomato/caramelized onions\nBasil Chicken Panini - chicken/basil aioli mayo/fontina cheese/basil/caramelized onions\nProsciutto Panini (MY FAV) - cured italian ham/basil aioli mayo/buffalo mozzarella/basil/tomatoes\nHam and Cheese - ham/country dijon mustard/swiss cheese/spinach/tomatoes\n\nSANDICHES - $10.15 \nSmoked Salmon (MY FAV) - Dill brioche/caper dill cream cheese/smoked salmon/daikon sprouts/egg/caper dill red onions\nRoasted Turkey - Croissant/butter/cranberry relish/cheddar cheese/alfalfa sprout/tomatoes/roasted turkey breast\nCold Ham and Cheese - Challah bread/mayo/dijon mustard/ham/swiss cheese/spinach/tomatoes\nRoast Beef - Challah bread/horseradish sour cream/dijon mustard/roast beef/watercress/tomatoes/red onions\n\nSALADS - $12.95\nCobb Salad - lettuce/grilled chicken/bacon/eggs/tomatoes/cucumber/daikon sprouts/blue cheese/blue cheese dressing\nWestern Salad (MY FAV) - Bacon,red peppers,cheddar,swiss,corn,red onions,beef steak,black beans,southwestern ranch dressing\nCaesar Salad (MY OTHER FAV LOL) - Romaine lettuce/grilled chicken/anchovies and pecan filled/parmesan/croutons/caesar dressing.\n\nWell I hope this all helps you make a choice! I literally had to type this whole menu myself and wasn't copy pasted as Jean Philippe's online site doesn't have a menu for some reason. SYOY!"

The patisserie is right next to the guest room elevators so it was quite and convenient and I decided to give it a try. \n\nI ordered the ham and cheese croissant which was hands down the best ham and cheese croissant I have ever had. I also had to get something called the Chocolate Intense. Wow! Just wow! It was amazing and very well named.\n\nLater in the day I was checking my bill at the front desk and discussed a couple of the Aria's restaurants with him. When Jean Philippe Patisserie came up he recommended the almond croissant. One guess what I had for breakfast the next day? And it was equally awesome. I also bought a muffin and cookie for the road home. Both were massively yummy.\n\nAlso, there is plenty of seating. Considering the number of people there, I thought I would have a hard time finding a place to sit, but I quickly found a seat and despite the constant flow of people, I didn't see anyone struggle to find a seat.\n\nOkay, now the downside. It is a little expensive, but what do you expect, you are in a 5-star Vegas resort. The ham and cheese croissant, chocolate intense and large soda cost over $20. I had a resort credit so I didn't care. Had I not had the credit I might have docked them a star, but considering the location and how good it was, I'm not complaining.\n\nAlso, the service leaves a little to be desired. While fast enough, they weren't friendly at all and when people asked questions they seemed more than a little put out to be answering them.\n\nStill, with food this good I have to give them 5 stars."

I had a breakfast panini, croque monsieur, and prosciutto panini. Can't decide which of those was the best.\n\nAll in all, I'm so glad this patisserie was in my hotel lobby. The prices were steep compared to home... but what isn't expensive on the strip? Everything I had here was worth the $$$. \n\nSo, if you see something that catches your eye just try it.

They have an amazing chocolate, pastry, and ice cream selection.   Some of my favorites are the chocolate scone, Canelle chocolate, chocolate cheesecake, and chocolate macaroons.  All of the desserts are pretty expensive.  It can add up to $30 quick if you are grabbing a few for you and some one else.  \n\nThe food is pretty reasonable at around 10 dollars a meal but as I previously mentioned, it isn't too tasty in my opinion."

I was so enthralled with the displays of chocolates, treats and the huge glass display of pastries and other delights that I had to stop by.  Even though I didn't purchase any breakfast pastries or muffins, I just know they were probably the best around.  The size of the blueberry breakfast tart with cascading berries put anything to shame that I ate at the Wynn's 24-hour coffee shop.\n\nSince we were there at mid-day we purchased some chocolate and toffee covered bread sticks and coffee.  At first I was skeptical thinking that break sticks would not be as good as chocolate covered pretzels, however, I was proven wrong.  Those treats were so good that I rationed them the entire trip and was seen eating them on the airplane ride back home - I even managed to save 1 for my sister back home, which was a feat of willpower.  The coffee was divine and I was able to bring Jean Philippe's signature blend home in whole roasted bean form.  I will definitely be going back there again just to visit this patisserie next time I'm in Vegas."

Welcome to Las Vegas!\n\nI finally discovered Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Aria Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip earlier last year and still think about all their delightful desserts.\n\nThis place is a mecca for your sweet tooth cravings. I'm very impressed with the delicate and intricate designed desserts behind the window display. Honestly, I have only tried their desserts at their Bellagio location but noticed this selection is at least double the inventory since the bakery is housed here. \n\nMy favorites at JPP is the truffles, macarons ($2.50) and their pistachio flavored rice krispy treat ($4.99). The pumpkin spiced macaron had a bright pumpkin flavor and the crisp outside to gooey inside ratio was perfect. The truffles hands down had to be one of the best. If you know someone who's a huge chocolate fan, buy some truffles and instantly gain \"brownie\" points!\n\nAnd it does not stop there... with a full cafe, gelato bar, crepe station and packaged gifts, this place offers an arrangement of sweet offerings. This will always be my primary choice because of: selection of pastries, the truffles and shorter lines. \n\nThey have several seats and tables for you to enjoy your plated desserts and beautifully decorated seasoned theme throughout the area. My interaction with the staff has been extremely friendly and I never felt rushed to make a decision. \n\nYou'll definitely hit the jackpot at Aria's Jean Philippe!"

Coconut ice cream with the texture and sweetness of shredded coconut and mango compote covering a beautifully made crepe.

Okay, you do NOT get lunch here.  You get desserts, small snacks, and other small things.  No wonder you rated it badly.  If you go to a Starbucks and expect steak and lobster, will you give it 2-stars?  Jeez, come to my Chinese restaurant and I swear if ask for foie gras, I will spit in your food.\n\nThe pastries are great.  Some of the tastes take some time getting accustomed to, probably because they are quite bold in flavor.  They also had vanilla flan which was pretty interesting.  Too bad though, my mom makes them better.\n\nFor a date, this may be a mediocre place to go to for desserts.  For a true epicurean, for whom Jean Philippe went to La Chambre de M\u00e9tiers for, this is THE place for desserts.  If you want a cake, I know that you have to meet with their cake specialist ahead of time to order one.  They are MUCH more expensive than Freed's Bakery, but well worth the money.\n\nOther than that, they have a great selection, so whatever you're feeling like, they should have something in store.  The pieces are somewhat pricey though, so restrain yourself ;)"

I had to ask for a bag, and while napkins were shoved into the handle of the cardboard carrier, there was NO FORK, making the gooey pastry very difficult to eat.\n\nThe pastry itself was a heavily vanilla bean flavored flan atop a flaky pastry crust.  It was also HUGE and could definitely satisfy two people with how rich it is.  A dollop of fresh whipped cream or fruit would have made it restaurant worthy.  It did have more flavor than what Whole Foods offers.\n\nSolid food, but they really need to work on the employees.  Minus one star for the lackluster employees and another for not including a fork.

There are so many savory and sweet food and drink choices that we had to come back multiple times just to try more things.\n\nVENUE: I know there are various locations for this delightful place, but I frequented the one in the Aria Casino and Hotel Resort. The seating area is very small and limited - maybe only 10 or so tables, so if you aren't lucky to grab a seat, get your food to go and find a place to sit. Because it's located right next to the casino, and because there are so many people wanting to grab a bite, the atmosphere is super busy and loud. \n\nFOOD/DRINK:\nChicken Basil Panini: Wonderful. I'm a sucker for anything with pesto. The cheese literally just pulls into string as you take a bite. Bread is crispy but not too hard.\n\nSmoked Salmon Sandwich (served warm): you can ask for this item, even though it's a \"cold\" item, to be served warm. It's scrumptious. Perferct for breakfast - I thought I was going to be hungry after I ate it because it seems so small. But I was actually full after it. Maybe because it was still morning and I was just waking up. Either way it's a great breakfast choice. I wasn't too crazy about the hard boiled egg in the sandwich. Next time I'll have to remember to ask them to remove that.\n\nSmoke Salmon Crepe: Better as the sandwich. Crepe itself had good consistency\n\nDessert Trio: Comes with a macaron hugging raspberries, a peanut butter ice cream pop, and a small shot of cr\u00e8me brulee. Oh and did I mention that the base these all sit on is made of chocolate? Needless to say I didn't finish this.\n\nFourth of July Special: Oh lord this was so tasty I'm secretly hoping that they serve it frequently but just dressed it up differently for the holiday. It's an uncle sam hat shape, covered in delicious butter cream fondant. Inside lemon vanilla cake with a butter cream and strawberries. SO GOOD. Independence day just isn't the same without strawberries.\n\nSmoothies: We ordered one, forgot the name. It had peach, mango, pinapple, and other tropical fruit. It was really tarte (which is good for us because we like it that way) but will probably disappoint those who prefer there smoothies to be on the more sugary side.\n\nSide note, you're going to end of up paying about $7-8 per sandwich. Desserts range from $5-10 as well. There are also other baked good options (muffins, bagels, etc.)\n\nSERVICE:\nIt's crowded and you're in a line. Lol. But the waitstaff and people who were taking down our orders were pleasant and patient and not at all cranky as you might expect them to be after having to deal with dozens of people at a time."

Our first time my friend shared a Blueberry Danish and a Pabana Smoothie.. The danishes are $3.95 and although pricey, it's worth it. There are a ton of blueberries in every bite. The crust is flaky and so buttery. The Pabana Smoothie was pretty good too but really expensive, but they do use a good amount of fruit and sorbet so it's somewhat worth the $9. I shared both with my friend and we were actually pretty full since we didn't have breakfast or lunch. It was just to tie us over because we were going to have a late dinner @ Craftsteak. \nThe next day we grabbed lunch at JP after CES. We got the Berry Smoothie & a Tropical one.. also decided to try the ham and cheese sandwich and one of the chocolate desserts.  \nThey ran out of an ingredient for the Berry Smoothie so it was a bit sour and should've been slightly thicker. The tropical one was okay, but the best smoothie is the Pabana. The ham and cheese sandwich was still warm when I brought all the food/drinks back to my hotel room. I shared the sandwich with my friend; it's a pretty small sandwich to begin with. It was pretty good, but it could've used at least one more slice of ham. It was mostly cheese which was pretty tasty. I don't know which cheese it was, but it had a pretty strong smell. I guess I'm not used to eating cheese. =D Also, the sandwich could've been grilled instead because once it was warmed up, the white bread was pretty soggy. Other than that, it was good. The chocolate dessert, I don't know what it was called but it had a gold leaf on top. I didn't really like it, but it was pretty. I took a small bite and let my friend finish the rest. It wasn't as rich or sweet as I thought it should be. \nStill this place has delicious pastries. My friend wants to go back and get the Ham & Cheese croissant as well as the chocolate one."

Located right next to the casino, this stand is very versatile.  You can pick up breakfast pastries or individual cakes, but you can also get cafe-esque breakfast items and sandwiches.  They also have a gelato bar as well as a selection of expensive but nice looking packaged sweets (for gifts).\n\nI had a few things.  I tried their pain au chocolat, which was very flaky and crispy.  The chocolate flavor was good though the chocolate bar inside the croissant was too hard.\n\nI also had one of their parfaits, which was gingerbread gelato mixed with hazelnut gelato and then garnished with crunchy hazelnuts and spice-flavored gingerbread.  The parfait was topped off with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.\n\nThe parfait was just okay.  The gelato was a little too thick (the whipped cream was also not that great; too similar in consistency to a canned whipped cream though I believe this one was fresh).  Also, while the parfait had a good flavor, I felt there was too much gingerbread in it (and the gingerbread was dense).\n\nService is not rude or lazy here, but it is consistently slow.  I think part of it is due to a lack of staff.  I also do not think it is the most organized spot.  Another issue is that the staff does not seem to notice when a line is building or when customers have been waiting long.\n\nPrices are very high, but it is Las Vegas.  Still, the pastries and desserts here could definitely be better (especially when considering that some of their more ambitious items can run up to $6-$8 each).\n\nJean Philippe Patisserie is definitely overpriced, but you can walk away with a good pastry or dessert here.  I have not found anything here that I absolutely loved, but there are enough decent things where it might be worth checking out if you are in Aria and on the hunt for a fancy dessert.\n\nAria has its own parking structure, which is free.  Valet parking is also available."

While living in Austria (Europe) for 10 years, I have always loved Gelato over American icecream (no offense meant. They are good too!)\n\nThe shop was very professionally displayed with all sorts of baked goods and chocolates, but I went straight to the Gelato line.\n\nBetween a friend and I, we ordered Coconut, Pistachio, Glazed Hazelnut, and Lemon.\n\nThe (1) Coconut was one of the BEST I have ever tasted from any Gelato shop -- it was full of Coconut flavor and texture. (2) Glazed Hazelnut was also excellent: it contained glazed pieces of hazelnut, adding a nice, crunchy texture. (3) Pistachio was acceptable, and contained pistachio nuts for additional texture as well.\n\nI was disappointed with the (4) Lemon, however. Don't get me wrong. Lemon is one of my favorite Gelato flavors, but this one didn't taste right. And here's why: my friend wanted Lemon Gelato. The server gave her Lemon Sorbet. I told him that we wanted GELATO. He said, \"they are both the same.\" Huh? I knew from the consistency that it was, in fact, NOT Gelato. Gelato and Sorbet are NOT the same. *Minus 1 star for that.*\n\nAll in all, this is perhaps one of my most favorite Gelato places. Two scoops for $5. Excellent.\n\nIn contrast, the Gelato stand at the Venetian, Cocolini's, was a complete JOKE! It tasted nowhere near Gelato, and was extremely creamy. Gelato is supposed to be light and flavorful. Two scoops for $8. My friend, who never had Gelato before, found it to be \"blah\" too. I felt so bad, I just had to take her to Jean Philippe (after a friend raved about it). Jean Philippe helped win her back. She now enjoys Gelato.\n\nEDIT 3/31/2011: I was in Vegas last week and stumbled upon another Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio. So, we paid them a visit thinking it would be as good as the one at the Aria. No. Go to the Aria for GOOD gelato.\n\nEDIT 5/14/2012: I love my icecream to have texture. For example, Hazelnut gelato having pieces of the nut, Strawberry having seeds, Coconut having coconut shavings, and the such. They make the gelato taste more natural and provide a welcome break to the same taste after you have licked the flavor over and over again. This place has that."

Over the weekend, we had ordered an 8 inch carrot cake for my friend's surprise birthday party and we had even confirmed the reservation the day of the event.  We went to pick up the cake at the Aria branch and they \"could not find the cake\" and furthermore \"could not find the order.\" Then they accused us of placing the order at the bellagio store and when they called the store there was no record of the order either.  Basically they were accusing us of not placing the order which is ridiculous!! Luckily my friend emailed me a copy of his credit card statement which showed the shop had already CHARGED us for the cake even before we had received the product!! A manager then scurried out looked red in the face and apologized and gave us two boxes of pastries which was appreciated, but the damage was done.  The dinner was delayed, the surprise was delayed, and the rest of the nights festivities were delayed due to a poor management system at one of the elite bakeries in vegas.  I am writing this review not out of spite, but to help your established company not make the same mistake again as this will cause your company to lose great customers not because of the food, but because of the management and system.

I was told there was a 45 minute wait for a crepe. Considering there were only a few people ahead of me in line, my only guess is that the other guests who ordered crepes were patiently waiting at a table or some d-bag in front me ordered for himself and 20 of his closest friends. Either way, I ended up with a sandwich, the rose macaroon, and a strawberry lemon cupcake. Total $25.\n\nRoast Beef Sandwich: Looks like it should be hot, but it's not. Despite that, it was actually pretty freakin' delicious. Maybe I'm biased, but the bread was soft and I love roast beef and horseradish. It was a pretty good size, still overpriced at $11. My guess is that it was made with extra love.\n\nRose Macaroon: I have an aversion for anything that sounds like it'll taste like flowers. But my nephew said that looks good, and you only live once. It wasn't too flowery. I'm a sucker for macaroons, but I think regular sized versions are better. Purely for convenience.\n\nStrawberry Lemon cupcake: + 10 points for looking like the a cupcake from the future. +10 points for not disappointing in the flavor department (not too much lemon, not too much strawberry, not too sweet). + 5 because a spoon required (which sounds like it should be minus points, but I actually prefer cake in an actual cup and using a spoon. Keeps it neat.) I want this to be my next birthday cake. That's how much I loved it."

Love how they have different stations for everything. I have to admit the pastries, Macarons and other treats are to die for, you can get a crazy sugar rush from just standing in this sugar store. Will definitely be back for more deliciousness."

            "review": "+ Sweet Crepe\n+/- Tiramisu\n- Wait/line/ordering system \n\nTheir sweet crepes here are delicious, a good balance in flavor and not cloyingly sweet to the point of cavity inducing. We got the chocolate crepe with the brownies on top and it was delicious! The crepe batter was made just right to make it fluffy and smooth. \n\nFeeling rather ambitious and also hankering for sweets we ordered the Tiramisu. I'm a little torn on it. It doesn't have the strong rum or coffee flavoring Tiramisu is known for. But it felt more like a chocolate based Tiramisu so I was a little disappointed. It was a good little treat. However I think I would turn to other shops for their Tiramisu if you're looking for something less chocolate and more coffee/rum based. \n\nOne thing I wish they could change is how they have their lines or ordering system. We didn't realize there were actually two lines the outer closest to the walkway is more for gelato, the inner one is primarily other sweets and can include gelato orders. When we first walked up it looked like one large line that wrapped around. Until someone pointed out two lines and another register. I think signs or even ropes would help keep the line from going down the hallway. It can get crowded here with the foot traffic, in addition to the line, and those waiting for crepes to be made it is confusing. \n\nI would definitely come again for their sweet crepes, and I'll update my review once I get to try a savory. Until next time Bellagio!"

I had high hopes for it since it seem to come highly recommended from all the reviews on Yelp. It was nice and flaky. However the layer of chocolate was very minimal. I mean I didn't expect it to be drowning in chocolate, but I felt that there wasn't enough chocolate to justify it being called chocolate.\n\n-Almond Croissant: 3/5 This was super sweet! It had a sweet center which I wasn't expecting. Ordered it for breakfast and honestly had to eat it in two servings because it was too sweet.  \n\n-Chicken Pesto Panini: 5/5 This was by far the best thing I ate from here. I love hot sandwiches. The bread was nice and toasty. The cheese was melted perfectly. Plenty of pesto. You can't go wrong when ordering this!\n\n-Chai Tea: 2/5 I'm a lover of chai lattes and this was terrible. It was the most water downed chai I have ever had. Definitely skip this. \n\n-Iced Mocha Coffee: 5/5 I am not a coffee drinker and even this drink won me over. Excellent for a hot day.\n\nOverall, I don't think this is a must for me when I am in Vegas. Certain items are great but the prices are too steep for me."

Chicken, cucumbers, tomatoes, and a light curry sauce, this sammie will hit the spot any time of the day.  \nRoast beef- piled high with rare meat and topped with horseradish with some kick, this was the hb's fav.  \nCroque monsieur-standard recipe, good breakfast alternative.  \nSandwich trio-for those who don't want to choose just one. Smaller versions of 3 classic flavors.  \n\nYou may end up paying as much as you would at the buffet, but at midnight, this place may fit the bill."

In fact, the chocolates didn't taste that much better than those Whitman drugstore candies -- meh. Desserts are also now made way ahead of time so that they are super stale by night's end -- beware after 5pm.

There was a pretty long line of people ordering ice cream, but I came for the crepes and my husband ordered a lemon gelato. I love nutella crepes, and these were absolutely delicious. It was a treat to watch it being made right in front of our eyes too. Every bite of the crepe was divine (as good or better than from Paris!) and worth every penny.\n\nThere were also some gorgeous cakes on display, and they seemed to have a lot of fun candies and other little pastries. If I lived in Vegas I would stop by often to try the entire menu. Sadly I don't, so when I come back it will be for another nutella crepe for sure!"

Each pastry was pretty good, although it was a little pricey (over 20.00 for the three items before."

The macarons were very light and fresh and had very accurate flavor interpretations. There are so many pastries, cakes and tarts to choose from that it will make your head spin! I didn't have the opportunity, nor the stomach capacity to sample everything I wanted to, but I did try the ones that stood out the most to me. Yummay!\n\nI decided to try one of their many lunch options on one of my visits here. They offer about four types of paninis as well as various sandwiches on Croissants. I believe they also have a few salad options to choose from that would satisfy your appetite. For anyone who doesn't want to indulge in the various cakes or pastries, they have a large variety of Gelato flavors to choose from which can also be made into shakes if you'd like. They have various flavors of chocolate Bon Bons as well! The Banana was my favorite flavor And I recommend everyone try at least one.\n\nOverall, I would stop in here everyday that I'm in Vegas again in the future. There were a bunch of other items that I still would love to try. One thing that kinda bothered me but didn't ruin my experience here, was that some of the employees, working the registers n such, are not very friendly and have this miserable demeanor about them, as if they don't really care for dealing with customers. Put a smile on your face and at least look as if you are happy to be there for goodness sake! lol."

You get two big scoops for gelato for $5 and it was extremely creamy and rich, not ice crystals at all which is in essence what gelato is. They let you try the flavors before you decide which to purchase so essentially you can never go wrong with the flavors you pick. I got the cheesecake gelato and I was pleasantly surprised that it had large chunks of cheesecake hidden in the middle. I also got the coconut gelato and it was divine. It was encrusted with chucks of real coconut so in every bite you get some creamy gelato with some chunky coconut, the perfect balance for me. I would go again and again and I would recommend it to everyone."

I like how they have places for you to sit and chit chat or people watch over the casino. The Bellagio Jean Phillipe didn't think it through. The pastries are bomb but SUPER rich. I have a ginormous sweet tooth and I still couldn't finish my creme brulee. Speaking of which, don't order the creme brulee. I am a creme brulee purist, and this one instead of burning the top layer of sugar, separated the custard with a piece of white chocolate and then put a layer of the flan-type caramel on top. You get the same \"crack\" of a proper creme brulee, without the yummy burnt pleasure. Me no likey! In fact, it was quite disappointing. I hate to say it, but even the creme brulee at Yardhouse is better!"

            "review": "Very enticing little sweet shop within the Bellagio hotel.  Its most prominent feature is their floor to ceiling, multi-tiered, sinuous chocolate fountain.   You just want to slide your head under and drink chocolate all day!\n\nThe shop is NOT within the main area of Bellagios shops and dining.  Rather, it is nestled in the walkway toward the meeting rooms and Salon/Tower Rooms.   Just follow the signs toward those areas and you won't miss it.\n\nThere are two walls of appealingly packaged chocolate delights to purchase as gifts -- or to feast on in the privacy of your room's closet! --  while the central area is more bakery/cafe style order and pay.  There is no seating within the store but a lounge area with tables and chairs are directly outside for people watching.\n\nI ordered the following individually packaged items (prices are approximate):\n\nBrownie ($3.50) - oval shaped, moist, light brownie with chocolate chips.  Not overly dense or oily.  If you like chewy brownies, this isn't it, but for a light brownie it had great mouth-feel.\n\nChocolate Coconut macaroon dipped in white chocolate ($3.50) - moist and dense with flakes of coconut.  This is NOT a purely coconut macaroon, instead it is more of a chocolate brownie with lots of coconut.   I liked it but not sure I would buy over and over again.\n\nDouble Chocolate cookie ($3.25) - terrible.  This cookie was obviously made a couple days ago and never removed from circulation.   The cookie was hard and dry.   I went back the following morning and exchanged it for something else.   Management wasn't happy about it but was kind enough to oblige.   \n\nFruit Cups ($8.50) - ok, I know this is not a bakery item but I was impressed with them.  Pineapple, cantaloupe, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries were in good shape (neither over nor under ripe) and sweet.   Now, to have fruit like this in February is a treat!  Ordered it two days in a row and felt less guilty after eating all my insulin spiking treats!\n\nOverall, a fun place to stop and peek if you enjoy the visual appeal of chocolate shops, but the quality of the baked goods is more typical rather than top notch."

This location is not the one with the chocolate fountain (that one is at the Bellagio) but it is larger and has a nice seating area. \n\nJean-Philippe Maury is amazing with desserts. He had a mentorship with Chef G\u00e9rard Bertin (recipient of the \"Meilleur Ouvrier de France,\" the most prestigious pastry award in France), won the Best Pastry Chef of France in 1997, won the Gold Medal in the 2002 World Pastry Team Championship as a member of Team USA, and many other awards. He also worked with Chef Francois Paillard as a pastry chef for his restaurant and shop.\n\nOur Order:\nCroque Monsieur: Baked Ham & cheese topped w/ Parmesan\nWhite Cafe Mocha\nPistachio Macron\nChocolates: Earl Grey, Lemon Tart, Pistachio, Dark Chocolate w/Hazelnut\n\nI typically don't order croque monsier because they're so easy to make but my friend didn't eat breakfast so I wanted to get him something. What's unique is that on the outside of the bread, Parmesan is baked onto it so it had so much more flavor. It was surprisingly good!\n\nThe White Cafe Mocha was on the sweet side but very yummy. There were bits of white chocolate inside as well!\n\nThe pistachio macron didn't have an overpowering flavor. The cookie itself was very soft and slightly chewy.\n\nThe chocolates were all very creamy and smooth. Highly suggest eating right away as they do no hold up in heat at all. The layer in the caramel inside the Darke Chocolate w/ Hazelnut was amazing. EXTREMELY soft and not too sticky or chewy. Made me wish I had bought the mix of caramels (and this is coming from someone who doesn't really like caramels much!)\n\nWill definitely come back as they also sell gelato and crepes! Plus they're open late! :D"

Here, if you earn 10,000 loyalty points you can redeem either a \"Signature Pastry\" or a \"Crepe.\" While that is interesting in itself, the best part is that these two rewards generate a voucher that is good for about $10 in food & beverage credit at Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Aria!\n\n2. Jean Philippe is located next to the elevators leading up to the Aria hotel or really close to Haze nightclub.\n\n3. Jean Philippe is best known for their pastries, but they also serve delectable sandwiches and gelato!\n\n4. Try the chicken panini's they are awesome.\n\n5. JP is also a chocolatier and has many different confections and chocolate available.\n\nJean Philippe is my favorite stop in the Aria. Not only is it \"affordable,\" it is also part of the MyVegas rewards program. Every time my girlfriend and I head to Vegas we will farm loyalty points on MyVegas and purchase the two rewards to use at JP for a free lunch/brunch/breakfast meal. The savings actually add up!\n\nNow beyond the free stuff spiel, I must say that the sandwiches there are excellent. Among our favorites are the panini's. Particularly the chicken ones that they have. We have tried their pesto panini and it is pretty damn good when it comes out fresh, hot, toasty and crunchy.\n\nThey also have a variety of diabetes inducing pastries. If after looking through their delectable mixture of desserts and pastries you cannot decide, I recommend trying their sampler. It comes with a chocolate peanut butter cake pop, a creme brulee, and a raspberry macaron.\n\nSpeaking of macaron, across the way and past the pastries, there is a crepe making station as well as gelato and an area for chocolate and other delicious confections. Their gelato is pretty excellent, though a bit pricey.\n\nIf you are a fan of regular breakfast foods, don't fear they do have muffins and donuts and the like. As well as stuff on the healthier end such as salads.\n\nI have never had a problem at JP with service. It gets busy around the area and it may be difficult to find a seat, but the service has always been friendly and efficient. The reason why I also like this location better than the one in the Bellagio is that it is less busy. This is primarily due to the fact that they don't have the world's largest chocolate fountain running through their store, which means that there are not a lot of people milling about as a tourist attraction.\n\nAnyways, this is a great place to relax, refresh, and eat a nice breakfast, lunch, or light dinner. As a side note, this place is also open til 12 AM!\n\nHappy eating!"

According to them they state all of their items have a warning label saying \"Please refrain for eating if you have any nut allergies\". So anyone with a serious allergy should not even step foot in the place - you can't eat anything.  Not allergic to all nuts, don't trust their labels because they really do not feel the need to actually list the ingredients used. So even though the nuts are listed, there's a chance there are nuts in it, which is why they have their warning label.   So I'm not sure what else they don't list in their ingredients.  They put nuts in cookies, but don't have the type of nut listed (or even mention that there are nuts in the cookie itself).   So again, if you have a nut allergy, don't go here.  Even if you have a concern, the general manger, Annie, doesn't like to address concerns, and will simply refer back to the warning, just avoid any concerns you have.  If you do happen to eat something that has nuts and you are allergic to they type of nut they use, you can likely get a refund for the product through, so remember to keep your receipt, you may need the refund to help pay for any hospital bills."

I love crepes. I get dessert crepes from a couple places near my neighborhood in town for less than $6.\n\nUnderstanding the $11+ price at Jean Philippe because it is in a high end location, I didn't mind paying it. I ordered the bananas fosters dessert crepe. It looked so good, I even found a seat and took pictures of it for my snapchat. \n\nAfter showing off my dessert to all my followers I begin to dig in. You couldn't even cut through it with the fork. I thought, \"what the? Maybe it's rubbery?\" But then when I take a bite, it was crunchy AF!! I gave it the benefit of the doubt and cut through the middle, and it was the same prob. Crunchy taco shell crepe! \n\nOkay so I also get that this can happen. So I kindly go back to the lady who curated my crepe asking her if she can remake it because it was crunchy. All she said was, \"it may have over cooked a little.\" That's it!! I was standing there waiting for anything else she had to say or if she was going to take my plate to remake it. I don't know! All I know is I was standing there for a hot a minute or two before I asked again, \"could you please remake it? I like my crepe soft just like the $5 ones I can get elsewhere.\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes, grabbed the plate of crunchy taco crepes from where I placed it and slammed it into the trash bin. Then she started sloppily making a new one for me. Wow! When I finally got to eat it, it was softer but honestly, the flavor wasn't even worth it for me. Not the money, the asstitude, and the time wasted in line and having to get it remade. the bananas fosters was so dang sweet, I couldn't even enjoy the crepe I had to complain about."

But how can you resist getting a scope with your crepe though? \n\nApparently this is now a fairly popular spot for all those casino goers. Last time I went there it was very packed.

There are two different sections, the first being crepes, coffee, and gelato. The second one is desserts. If you go in the left area, you get to stare at the gelato. Since we had gone to the Bellagio one for gelato just the day before, I decided to not give it too much thought.\n\nI had two rewards to use from myVegas. One was for a free crepe (yay!) and another was for a free pastry.\n\n\n\nCrepe side.\nThey have savory and they have dessert crepes. We decided to get the savory crepe ($11.95). They make the crepe out of buckwheat flour (hence why it's brown). \n\nThe savory crepes:\nForest- Swiss cheese, black forest ham, wild mushrooms fricassee, scrampled egg\n\nSalmon (The one i chose!)- Swiss cheese, pico de gallo, asparagus, fresh spinach, caper/dill sauce topped w/ smoked salmon\n\nChicken- swiss cheese, grilled chicken breast, fresh spniach, piquillo peppers, chipotle sauce\n\nItalian- Sauteed Zucchini, over roasted tomatoes, fresh arugula, ricotta cheese spread, topped w/ proscuitto and basil psto\n\nVeggie- Swiss cheese, feta cheese, veggie saute, chipotle sauce, fresh spinach\n\nTheir salmon was GOOD. The caper/dill sauce reminded me of a strong tartar sauce but damn this was legit. It was heavy but brought upon something light to the dish. Yeah. That's an explanation I would give. Everything else (the crepe, the asparagus, spinach) that was all in there mixed excellently with the caper/dill sauce. I think that sauce definitely makes the dish. The salmon on top? Mhm mhm mhm. The smoked salmon was definitely saltier than I would have liked, but I think that's what smoked salmon tastes like :P It was raw, not cooked, but I like raw hehe. Mix it with the sauce or try to put it in the crepe but it'll become lost. They give a decent amount, but at the end of the day $11.95 is expensive. But it's good :D I wish I took a photo of it haha.\n\nPastry side:\nJust look, see what you like and eat it :P It most likely is good.\n\nAlmond croissant: $4.5- Had a flaky and subtle almond taste. It was strong enough to announce that it was there, but not strong that it overwhelmed the croissant (ie, you knew that it existed).\n\nI forget what the last thing I ordered was! Oh no I must be getting old sigh. :/\n\nIf you have the Aria keycard and enabled charging, you can charge it to your room so that you'll be able to pay for it when you check out.\n\nAlso, this does NOT have the world record chocolate fountain. That is Bellagio.\n\nI love it I love it I love it :)"

We had walked past the patisserie when headed up to our rooms and the brightness of the area along with the cakes really caught my eye. So the next morning whenever i was craving some coffee I decided to head down and get my fianc\u00e9 and I each one.  Whenever I got down there I was able to see the multi tiered cakes up close and they were truly amazing!  It made me wonder how long it took to make them.  After a short wait I made it to the front of the line and ordered two Americanos only to watch them punch something into a machine and have it spot them out.  For the $10 it cost I was really hoping to have the barista take a minute and pull the shots.  The coffee itself was decent but not great.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would not head back here again in the future for coffee.  However I would definitely give it a try if I was looking for a baked good."

She bought a set of 5 truffles and I got one earl grey truffle (stamped beautifully with the word TEA all over it) and the coconut macaroons (yes macarOOns).\n\nThe truffle and one macaroon entered my mouth before I opened my front door.  The tea truffle - unique flavor and delicious.  The macaroon...well...I love coconut and I just recently made meringue-y coconut macaroons in a baking class and ate them for breakfast (eggs for breakfast, get it?)\n\nWell, today it happened again.

Next to the overwhelming selection of visually astounding desserts and pastries, the assortment of outrageously overpriced cold prepared food items including croissant sandwiches, salads, and mixed fruit cups (for a ridiculous $7.50 - WTF) just looks plain sad.\n\nI sampled the dessert trio ($9.90) consisting of scaled down versions of the creme brulee, peanut \"lollipop,\" and raspberry rose macaron -- all served atop a plate made of solid milk chocolate. It displayed a full spread of dessert flavors -- tart and fruity from the macaron, rich and buttery from the lollipop, light and creamy from the creme brulee, and, well, chocolate. Though it was perhaps too saccharinely sweet, the cr\u00e8me brulee was lusciously silky and creamy, while the bland macaron exhibited hardly any discernible rose flavor. The ultra buttery, tender, and completely one-of-a-kind peanut butter \"lollipop\" was my hands down favorite of the bunch, and I'm hardly a peanut fan. I can't even begin to describe the explosion of fluffy, creamy, and rich so unassumingly concealed in a tender chocolate shell, let alone tell you what exactly is inside -- but it was certainly decadent, to say the least!\n\nI also sampled a handful of rather unremarkable chocolate truffles. I would only recommend the fruit jellies, which are an absolute must if you're a fan of fruity chocolate! They may appear dubious, but the blueberry jelly was hands down the BEST piece of chocolate I've ever had. Unlike the bland chocolatey-ness of the other truffles I had, the \"jam\" -- which is closer to an ultra rich syrup in consistency -- packed huge fresh blueberry flavor; thickly layered atop a white chocolate-infused mascarpone cream and wrapped in a thin dark chocolate shell, it was a perfectly proportioned bite of fruity tartness, intense cocoa, and creamy sweetness. I wish I ordered 10 more of these!"

At least the line is linear and doesn't confuse you like the one in the Bellagio.\n\nExpensive, but the taste is GREAT! It's hard to find a decent French patisserie in San Diego, so I'm happy to shell out a little more cash. \n\nSandwich: I was super happy with my prosciutto sandwich. I think it was about $8 and I was satisfied with what I had. The bread had the famous crunch that French people cherish. I'm not a rosemary fan, but the bread had hints of rosemary and was crunchy. They smother a good amount of pesto on the bread and layer the sandwich with mozzarella, basil, tomato and luscious and light prosciutto. It was the closest taste I could have to pan con tomate and jamon iberico in Spain, so I was a happy camper. The sandwich was heated up so the mozzarella was melty which I loved. \n\nLemon Meringue Tart: It was recommended by the worker. I asked her which one I should choose between the key lime tart or the lemon meringue. I would say the circumference of the tart is about 4 inches in diameter, so its a small dessert and you won't feel too guilty after eating it, especially after a sandwich! The meringue was soft and firm with toasted waves of heavenly taste. The lemon was sweet, tangy and tart. They also had a surprise of raspberries inside the lemon tart. The crust was light and airy. A very refreshing dessert. Think the dessert was about $6-8 as well.\n\nTo Go Dessert: Get the Brioche with nutella. It's a hit with customers and compliments a cup of coffee very well. The nutella is nice and gooey inside the middle of the brioche. The brioche is made to look like a bread cupcake with the middle ozzing nutella. It's a favorite! \n\nEating at the patisserie can be a challenge because there is always a line. I recommend that you really look at the choices before you get into line. Your mind goes back and forth as you wait in line passing the sandwiches and desserts. They also had generous portions of salads and other assortments of sandwiches and quiches. When you have made up your mind, then get into line. Anywhere from a 10 min to 20 min wait. Sometimes it is so busy that you might not find a seat at the patisserie. There are many barstools and tabletops, but if it gets too busy and there is no place to eat, you can walk around Aria and find a place to enjoy your goodies. I do prefer eating at the patisserie. Wash down a pastry with their delicious coffee. Again, don't be pissed or upset if you drop 20-$30 for yourself here. Places like this are hard to come by, so KNOW before you go."

They put a lot of berries including blueberry, raspberry and strawberries.  With a bit of whipped cream and coconut ice cream, each bite was like heaven.  The Gelato has little bits of coconut shavings, and was really strong in coconut taste. \n\nFor pastries we got a rose macaron and blueberry brioche.  The macaron had a nice flavour of rose, paired with the fresh raspberries. It was a little difficult to eat since it was so big, kinda didn't know where to start. \nThe blueberry brioche was moist with lots of blueberries.  \n\nWould definitely recommend the crepes if you come here.

They taste just as good as they look.  Of course, the raspberry macaron is a must, but the tutti frutti is divine as well.  They also have salads and sandwhiches, which are quite yummy as well.\n\nIn the middle is a coffee bar and a candy gift shop, with chocolates, marshmellows, etc.  And on the other side of that they have a gelato and crepe bar.  It doesn't get anymore perfect than that!\n\nThe only thing that didn't impress me was the service at one point.  I asked for a macaron and they gave me a fruit tart (and I HATE fruit tarts), and the manager was pretty rude when I went back and asked to exchange it.

The macaron was adorned with a very pretty sugar coated rose petal, and filled with cream and fresh raspberry. I took a bite of the petal, but it actually looks prettier than it tastes. The macaron, however, was delish. The cookie was not too sweet, and the cream and raspberry compliments it very well. The napoleon was also very good, although it was like any other napoleon I've had.

You bite into something dark and rich and sweet and then all of a sudden you reach something that is thin, crunchy, and light.  It's amazing!  The raspberry cheesecake was good, except it might be cloyingly sweet for some, it was almost too much for me.  And finally the tiramisu, Jean Philippe takes this trite dessert to new heights.  It's creamy, light, velvety, sweet, and just bitter enough all in one bite.  If you don't get anything else here, get the tiramisu!\n\nJean Philippe Maury.\nNot only do you boast the largest chocolate fountain in the world at your Bellagio counterpart's patisserie, but you have the nerve to entice me with classic French pastries, cr\u00eapes, and gelato. Fils de pute!"

My biggest gripe about this place is the check out process. \n\nI stood in line for a good 15 mins before anyone came to help. They may have been understaffed the employee who was in charge of the cash register was also making crepes. It seemed very inefficient. \n\nThe chocolates themselves where amazing, you definitely get what you pay for as these chocolates were not made by Hershey. If you are in the Aria or general area, give this place a shot."

Of course, I shared mine with my friend because it was really big and with lots of fruits (we ordered a berry one). We had our whip substituted with lemon sorbet. It was so good and it went great with the berry crepe. We watch them make it right in front of our eyes. \n\nThe place was really nice looking. Made me want everything there but I know I have my limits on sweets and food. hehe. I would probably be a fatty if I eat everything there. \n\nReason to why I didn't give my full 5 star rating because their service didn't wow me. A smile makes a huge difference to me. Saying thank you and not mean it means nothing to me. So ya. \n\nI would totally come back if I'm in Vegas to try out their other stuff and I would totally suggest others to come. It's really good. The crepe alone doesn't taste like much but with the fillings on top it's awesome."

My one scoop of tiramisu cost about $3.75 + tax. It's not at all outrageous, but it could have been a tad cheaper. I don't recommend getting the tiramisu. The caramel brulee tasted pretty good as I stole a sample from my friends. If you are unsure about what to get, you can get samples and test out the flavors yourself. \n\nThis is one of two locations in the area.

It only came with Blue Cheese Dressing, and while that normally isnt a problem, there was already a ton of blue cheese on the salad itself, and I felt like it was a blue cheese overload.  My friend ordered the Roast Beef sandwich, which had also probably been sitting there for hours, but he seemed to enjoy it.  Either that or he was just SUPER hungry.\n\nAfter our food, we decided to try some crepes.  We ordered a savory crepe with chicken and mushrooms, that was just so-so. The crepe was good, but the chicken and mushroom was more liquid than anything, and the flavor was just so-so.  We also ordered a bananas fosters crepe, that was also just mediocre.  Again the crepe itself was good, but there was only a small serving of bananas fosters on top.  The bananas were inconsistent, some were hard and others were too mushy.  The flavor was just so-so.

You can see how the crepes are made in front of you.  It is quite a delicate process.  I also tried the white chocolate cheesecake and that was amazingly good.  The cheesecake has a smooth texture to it and will melt in your mouth.  Eyes will roll all the way back when people eat this.  It was covered with a thin sheet of white chocolate.  Presentation is superb.  I would go back just for the desserts.  \n\nThe restaurant is set up in two sections.  One area is serves gelato and crepes, the other half serves desserts, sandwiches, and coffee / beverages.  The location has a very modern look / design to it and is very appealing.  The glass case showcases all the desserts they have to offer and it just makes you want to order 1 of everything.  I was very tempted to do it too.  I swear every dessert were chanting my name.  The prices are bit higher than what I normally would pay, but hey its Vegas, you win big and spend big.  To give you an idea of the prices, a large cup of soda is $4 (~ 32 OZ).  \n\nCheck this place out for great desserts.

So you know this place is delicious and upscale if you are looking for that epic tasting pastry you been craving for after a long day on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nI have tried this place about over 20 times from the chocolate boxes which is quite pricey but worth it from $30-$50 a box. Some have different flavored ganaches and truffles. A ganache is a type of glaze, icing, sauce, or filling for pastries made from chocolate and cream.\n\nThey also have different crepes flavors, they have two types the savory and the sweet type. The savory for example is the turkey and cheese (which is also very yummy).\nI have tried the sweet crepes multiple times. I would recommend the Nutella one with bananas.\n\nThis time I went to the Bellagio I was interested to find something different so I tried the Summer Delight Smoothie and was it delicious. I came back the next day to try it again. It was a combination of lemon and raspberry sorbet mixed together in a smoothie and was it amazing.\n\nThe desert highlight of my trip!"

The Croissant was fluffy and buttery and the chocolate was decadent.\n\nThey have lots of seating but we always brought back our food to our rooms. \n\nMinus 2 stars for their expensive prices and staff; they weren't very friendly."

The dessert are quite pricey so if you're coming to have breakfast for 2 you're looking to spend around $50.\n\nThe crepes are also very good and you can get sweet or savory ones (nutella and salmon were good), the salmon sandwich wasn't anything special but the turkey and cranberry croissant sandwich was good. The lines here are always long and it's always packed so you won't always be able to find a seat. You can skip the sandwiches and stick to the dessert crepes and pastries."

After waiting 25 MINUTES in line, we get to the register to place our order and the lady tells us it's going to be another 25 MINUTES for our food to come out. Whatttt?? 50 minutes for a crepe? No thanks Jean Phillipe's. The least you could have done was to give your customers a wait time in advance.

I did like the opera cake but only get it if you REALLY like rich chocolate things (it can be kind of heavy towards the second half). I also ordered a cinnamon roll which was not bad; it was more of a danish flaky pastry than the typical fluffy cinnamon roll texture. \n\nOn the side with gelato, we did order a coconut flavored one.

I tried a little of a few different things: the sweet trio, nutella napoleon, and strawberry cupcake.  The sweet trio is probably the best value and the one I'd recommend most.  It was sweet but not too sweet, soft, and delicious.  The nutella napoleon was very delicate, but also very dark chocolate and rich.  Slightly crunchy, I doubt that if you got this one to-go that it would last with the proper texture to your room.  The strawberry cupcake was okay, but too tart for my tastes.\n\nOverall, I was pleased with the variety of desserts they have here, just like the original JPP.

You can also add a scoop of your choice gelato to any crepe for $2. I added on a scoop of stracciatella which was good. However their 'gelato' tasted heavier like ice cream. Guess it depends on the flavor. \n\nAlso had their royal savory crepe with chicken breast, mushrooms and cheese in a cream sauce. Pretty yummy, cream wasn't too heavy to me like Payard's at Caesar's crepe. They also give you a small mixed greens salad on the side makes it not bad for $10.95. I'd eat here again for their savory and sweet crepes. \n\nThe pastries I got was the almond croissant and nutella brioche, both $4. \nThe nutella brioche was a last minute add on because it looked so yummy. I'd skip this one next time. Basically a dense dough with a huge chunk of nutella in the middle. Basically bread and nutella made pretty. \n\nOnto the almond croissant.

Since I am staying at the hotel, of course, we will pay a visit to JP.  My daughter picked up what appears to be a white chocolate bar and it was for $9.50. I also brought two croissants and paid for them at the cafe side.  It came out to a total of $17 something.  I didn't remember exactly how much the change was.  Anyhow, we started to walk back to our hotel room and I noticed the ingredients contained peanut.  Peanut is something that my daughter can't eat and will develop serve allergic reaction if consumed.  I told her I will exchange it after her nap. I don't think it will be a problem since its a very simple exchange.  Oh Boy, I didn't know what's to come was so horrific and humiliating that I am still upset over it.\n \nA few hours later, I went back and tried to exchange the white chocolate peanut bar for a white chocolate bar.  The white chocolate peanut bar was in its original package unopened and in the same shopping bag I purchased a few hours ago.  The male cashier took out the bar and asked if I have the receipt.  I told him that we were never provided with a receipt.  He looks annoyed when I said that. He then went on to say the bar appeared to be broken.  I told him we didn't open it and it was in the same package as we purchased it.  He then replied saying that the manager said \"NO\", we can't exchange it.  He didn't even check the ones on the retail shelf after I told him about the condition.  I was upset since it was only a even exchange and don't know why management made it so difficult.  After 10 minutes, a female manager finally came out.  She looked very annoyed and didn't greet us.  I told her I just want to exchange the peanut one for the one without it.  She wouldn't listen.  I guess I was frustrated and maybe raised my voice without knowing it.  I simply told her that my daughter has peanut allergy and since we accidentally took the wrong chocolate bar and she will not be able to enjoy it.  She said \"You picked it, We didn't pick it for you\". \"There is nothing we can do for you.\"  I can't believe she just said that.  Wow, what happen to customer service?  I showed her the other white chocolate peanut bars with the same pressed condition and she ignored me. She then threaten to call the security on me if I stay longer.  I told her to go ahead and call the security.  I didn't use any foul language or said anything inappropriate to her.  A proclaimed first class pastry shop threaten its own customer if she tries to exchange something. It was unheard of especially in a five star hotel. I was humiliated.  I was horrified by the whole experience.  I was in shock. She then told me I can go ahead and take the white chocolate bar, after all this humiliation and hard work for just a piece of chocolate bar?  It just tells me how rotten the company is inside even when it appears so beautiful and appealing outside."

Two more HUGE scoops of espresso gelato later, I realize that it takes 4 gigantic scoops of gelato to make this ultra-creamy, decadent slice of heaven!\n\nThe flavors mixed wonderfully, and we even experienced a slight crunch in the gelato from the hazelnuts--great texture!  Taste was perfect and so creamy that it almost felt like we were drinking straight gelato!  If you're a gelato lover, you must try this!!!\n\nAs we turned the corner, we saw that they also have a cafe side, where they sell paninis, sandwiches, and coffee.

I went ahead and tried 4 more flavors, which all turned out to be bland, so I defaulted back to cappuccino flavored gelato. I've had this flavor many times in the past and this was again unbelievably bland. The waffle cone I got with it was crisp and crunchy though. \n\nI've heard that the Jean Philippe in Bellagio was much better in quality, so maybe I will try that store next time instead."

The chocolate truffle was smooth and velvety, melt in your mouth goodness. The French definitely know how to create some good chocolate, I've never been disappointed by any French chocolate I've purchased, it's always lived up to it's hype. Def. try out this place if you get a chance. I visited the one in the Bellagio in the past but  I think the one in Aria is my favorite between the two.

Then perhaps they'll be lured in to do some gambling.\n\nSo, don't know where some place is?  Try the casino, that might just be where it is located!  And yup, that's where I found Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Aria!\n\nSeems I lucked out as the line was rather reasonable when I got there for breakfast.  They seem to cater to those who know what they want, as they try to take your order along the way on the counter, so you don't necessarily get to let your eyes do the ordering.  They no longer make almond bear claws, so I opted for the ham and cheese croissant $9.95 for breakfast and an almond croissant $4.25 for later.\n\nWhen I sat down to enjoy my fast breaking, I realized that they gave me the wrong pastry.  But when I showed it to the lady at the register, I was shocked that she returned the incorrectly served pastry back into the case.  Sure, I hadn't touch it, but how was she to be certain of that???\n\nThe ham and cheese was served melty warm, but paid the price in crispness lost.  It was okay but I could have done without having tried it.  (two stars)  The almond croissant on the other hand, I had it at room temperature the next day, and it was just wonderful!  Huge, well filled, crisp on the outside.  I enjoyed every bite!  (five stars)\n\nAnother day I stopped by for a pre-dinner sweet.  Also called \"Life is short!  Have dessert first!\"  This treat was their lemon meringue tart $7.  Sure their prices at first thought seem high, but I realized that generally the portion you get for the pastry isn't bad, cause they're actually larger than they look in the case.\n\nThis sweet repast wasn't too sweet, but it also seemed a bit light on lemon flavor.  There was also a surprise bit of raspberry in there.  (three stars)"

I was even more annoyed when I saw labels for the rose macaron cake say macaroon. However the prepacked macarons were labeled \"French macarons\".  Anthony N pointed it out to me that macaroon is the English translation for macaron; but seriously at Jean Philippe I would like to see it labeled Macaron, especially when they ALSO sell macarooooons. It's like a prestigious french restaurant having \"fat liver\" on their menu instead of foie gras. Luckily my annoyance quickly dissipated when i took a bite of that triple chocolate cake!!!"

I had never tasted one so light, yet rich n buttery at the same time. Nice texture and crunch. I'm not sure if maybe its because store brand brittles arent as fresh as JP's.

I remember having my first iced mocha drink there for nearly $7! The problem is, for certain types of iced drinks, they only offer in Large sizes so you are forced to pay for more than you really want to drink. So my choice was either a small hot mocha drink (which I didn't want to drink on a hot day) or a large iced mocha for double the price. Sheesh. \n\nI do admit they make everything look very pretty, colorful, and whimsicle. If I weren't on a diet, I probably would've tried every single one...well, eventually, if I'd stayed in Vegas long enough. I only tasted their cinnamon roll and it was pretty good. Semi crispy around the edges and softer texture inside, with a thin layer of frosting on top. \n\nI think Porto's - locations in Glendale, Burbank, and Downey (CA) - has similar stuff for wayyy cheaper prices. So unless you want to drink a large iced coffee drink for $7, you might want to just walk by to admire the pretty designs and colors, and then walk away. :)"

It's like a little sandwich shop that serves their paninis and sandwiches on clear plastic plates but it still feels fancy in here lol\n\nTheir smoked salmon sammich is a MUST TRY! Honestly I never ever thought that sliced onion and smoked salmon could go so well together! Well, they smack your palate like no other. OMG. It is the epitome of savory.\n\nBasil chicken panini is also a good choice! Everything was sooo flavorful and their sub/panini is perfectly heated and chewy and not overly dry or crunchy.\n\nOne thing I didn't order myself that I had a bite of was the caprese panini. It was nothing out of ordinary, can't remember much of it but I recommend that you get a caprese sandwich at Earl's rather than here. Til next time :)"

The filling had a delicious lemon pop, the right tang and sweetness. This dessert sported perfectly torched meringue and adorned with fine chocolate work.

Chocolate croissants are to die for - flaky, buttery, and just enough chocolate.  Espresso is great - Had double espressos ($4.50 each) twice.  Lunch - Ahi Tuna salads could not be finished by my ladies - $12 each  They gave me a taste of the Ahi - perfect.  Salad had crisp fresh greens and lots of tuna and greens..  Prosciutto sandwich ($10.50) was easily finished by me, but very tasty.  They have numerous salads and sandwiches to choose from - smoked salmon, and ham come to mind. To the left of the food line are their chocolates, gelato and crepes.  Open 6:00 AM to 12 midnight.   Warning on service: when they get busy, they may screw up your order.  Make sure they write order down correctly - yes, they use a pad and paper as of this writing.  Iced tea is $4.00, but we didn't get them because the server though it was \"iced water\" even though they charged us for iced tea.  This was of course at the busiest time of day, so after a little back and forth I gave up and came back later to the manager, who immediately refunded our money and apologized profusely.  I would gladly pay more for a sit down version of this restaurant to eat the fabulous food.  Their unbelievable desserts decorate the serving and eating area.  Check out the kiosk in the dessert section - you can see a tremendous number of pictures of their cakes etc.  Worth a look."

I decided upon a chocolate cheesecake that was so beautifully designed I wasn't even sure that I wanted to eat it.  It was wrapped in a white chocolate casing that was smooth as satin and melted in my mouth like silk.  I am not a white chocolate fan but I am of Jean Philippe he has the perfect balance of white chocolate and cream so its not hurt your teeth sweet.  On the top was the perfect dark chocolate with the perfect melody of chocolate and some type of liquor, what ever it was it was good.  Now to the middle creamy milk chocolate so creamy and smooth if I closed my eyes I could imagine that I was floating in Willy Wonka's chocolate stream.  I also was able to try a breakfast sandwich (which they serve 24hrs a day) it consisted of 3 grilled slices of fresh baked sourdough bread, the perfect boiled egg (which seems to be hard to come by these days), prosciutto, cheese slices and a heavenly cheese fondue.

I would love to be the one to find a diamond in the rough, needle in the haystack, that elusive hidden gem. \n\nBut, until then, I tell you about the current gems.\n\nJEAN PHILLIPE PATISSERIE is one of those gems.\n\nChef Jean Philippe Maury is truly an artist. He is captain of the US Pastry Team. (I know..., that really exists? - yes.)\n\nLocation: \n\nLas Vegas strip. Inside the Bellagio and inside the Aria Hotel. (This review is for Aria)\n\nArea: \n\nLas Vegas, if you have never been just Google it, there is too much to say about it. \n\nParking: \n\nDifficult and confusing to say the least (but hey, it's free)\n\nGeneral Ambiance: \n\nThis is difficult to describe. First, you have to remember that the PATISSERIE is located inside the Aria Hotel (which in Vegas means inside the casino) so, in general it is loud, smokey, and filled with mostly drunk gamblers. However, once inside the patisserie you are transposed into a different place. It is loud, bright, and exciting almost like an art museum. Sort of... Like I said, it's hard to explain.\n\nCustomer service:\n\nTop notch. Friendly, attentive and very helpful staff awaits you.\n\n======== THE REVIEW  ========\n\n5 STAR equals perfect, and Jean Philippe PATISSERIE is pretty close. The only thing that prevents this place from receiving a 5 star rating is the Aria. Not that the Aria is bad, but, the parking situation sucks. It's literally \"on the strip\", and they allow smoking inside the casino (smoke knows no boundaries). \n\nThe pastries are simply amazing. They are created by a true artist. They taste as good as they look. The one thing I do have to say is... If you want a Mercedes, you're going to have to pay for a Mercedes. This stuff is NOT CHEAP nor INEXPENSIVE. It is, however, worth the money you will spend.\n\nThe ambiance is party and shop and gamble and smoke... and did I say party? There are several places to eat within the Aria, so it's a one stop shop and the patisserie simply adds to that. The patisserie, however, is truly a stand alone facility worthy of its own review.\n\nI would love to have seen the patisserie separated from the casino as a true stand alone location.\n\nThe lines are standard for shops in Las Vegas, not too long, but busy enough to wait. \n\nThe place is clean. I have to give them that. They must pride themselves on that. It's organized, neat, and \"pretty\" for lack of a better word.\n\n======== OVERALL REVIEW ========\n\nClean, great customer service, excellent pastries, decent location garners this place 4 solid STARS. Although it is inside a casino/hotel, it holds its own. Great job!!!\n\n~ therealtred"

Yes they do offer a lot of different pastries, but they are mostly the same with slight variations on the toppings. Anyone who id familiar with french pastries knows they could have a lot more choices, especially for a fancy place like this. Speaking of fancy, even though they cater in high end hotels, the prices are ridiculously high with at least around 300% more than what you would pay for the same quality. It is the equivalent of paying $20 for a burger! I am still giving them a 4-star rating because it is almost impossible to find authentic pastries in Vegas, much less anywhere in the US. Great selections, from salads, chocolates, sandwiches to cookies, you will not be disappointed, and be ready to be in line to order your food; the place is always busy!"

It's stylish and contemporary -- a work of art that seems to arise out of nowhere in the midst of the sprawling Aria casino.  There's no shortage of beautiful things to look at here.\n\nThere's also no shortage of amazing things to taste.  Although savory items such as crepes and sandwiches are available, I'm all about the gelato, chocolates, and pastries.  There's far too much to try in a single visit, so I recommend getting a few small items to sample and share.  In my case, it was an assortment of small chocolates, a raspberry macaron, as well as a small cup of hazelnut gelato.\n\nThey're all absolute perfection in terms of quality.

Its definately over priced i dont think its cause its vegas more like you put a french name on it and it magically doubles in price. Its a pretty cute place to just hang out have a coffee or somethin. Maybe other things are delish i just wouldnt recommend the macroon.

            "review": "A true patisserie is generally focused on the obvious pastry, but they offer much more than just wonderful sugary delights. The setup is confusing because there are two lines to buy the many foods.\n\nOrder the following at the round display case on the left:\n+ Chocolate: I've tried six different bon bons. All were smooth, delectable, and focused on the feature flavor. They are small so buy twice as many than normal.\n+ Omelet and Crepe Station: With both sweet and savory crepes, I'd avoid having the savory crepe again because they use an odd buckwheat batter. The \"Forest Crepe\" with ham, too many saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and not enough Swiss cheese was a weird combination with a spicy aioli. As if the crepe batter didn't have enough egg, a fried egg was on top. Maybe my hangover made me imagine this bizarre crepe.\n\nOrder the following at the straight display case on the right:\n+ Patisserie: Easily tempted to order the many cakes and tarts, don't miss the heart-shaped palmier which had fantastic qualities like crisp, flakey, buttery, sweet, and sticky. The palmier is also sold as small cookies in pre-packaged containers. The chocolate croissant was good, but could have been sweeter.\n+ Take-Out: Pre-made foods like quiche, fruit and salad bowls, and sandwiches. The good take-out roast beef sandwich was juicy and contrasted by the acidic tomatoes and red onions.\n+ Coffee: Sorry, but I don't drink coffee.\n\nYelp reviews misstate that the largest chocolate fountain is here when it is at the Bellagio (see www.yelp.com/biz/bellagio-conservatory-and-botanical-gardens-las-vegas). Also, roughly a third of the photos posted here are the Bellagio location. Perhaps many Yelpers were a hard partying bunch that turned too tipsy to know the difference between Aria and Bellagio."

We also tried the chocolate croissant and some other pastries, everything tasted delicious here!

The sales ladies are not very helpful at all. I asked two different sales ladies to give me some recommendations and both said \"everything is good.\" Maybe that's the truth, but I can't buy everything!!! Anyway, we got some 3 chocolate bars, 3 box gift sets and 3 other chocolate/candy the total comes to $170!!!\n\nFinally had my first bite of the dark chocolate bar.. it was so smooth... loved it! and I'm not even a chocolate person!!!"

The coconut flavor is mild.  Halfway through, I almost forgot I was eating a macaroon because it is so moist, it has the texture and consistency of a brownie or a cake pop.\n\nPalmiers $14 - waiting to be opened but I have a feeling that these will be as salty as their croissants\n\nCaramel Corn - $9.80 waiting to be opened\n\nChocolates - $6 for 2 pieces waiting to be opened \n\nOverall, you are definitely paying for the brand.

We ordered 4- 2 scoops of gelato, 1-scoop of gelato and a nutella crepe for a total of $42.43. Thinking that Mr. Joselito M had a had day, I handed him $45 and told him to keep the change. \n\nWe sat among the beautiful displays and enjoyed our DELICIOUS desserts. The pistachio was excellent, as was the Leche (can't remember exact name), can't remember what other gelato we ordered but the Pistachio and Leche were the best as was the crepe.\n\nSince it was my daughters 18th birthday, I sneaked over to Joselito M and asked him what the price of the birthday cakes were. Again annoyed with me he didn't answer, but I could clearly see he was attending to other customers. I patiently waited until he was free, then again asked him the price of the Birthday cakes. He told me he didn't know and walked away! OMG it was so rude, I followed him over to the next counter and asked again politely, annoyed he turned to me and said \"Thats not my department... ask someone else\" then turned and walked away!\n\nI was so shocked with his behavior, I walked away and left Jean Philippe.

I have not tried anything else here.\n\nWe were checking out the Aria hotel, and wandering around, we saw the amazing cake displays at this little sweet shop/cafe. To my surprise they were selling gelato, which got me excited because the day before, I was not willing to spend $8 on a 2-scoop ice cream cone somewhere else.\n\nI tried their tiramisu and dulce de leche gelato (2 scoops in a cup =~$5). The tiramisu was HEAVEN in a cup. The dulce de leche was good as well but a little too sweet at the end, my throat almost hurt. But hey, 2 scoops for $5 is a pretty good deal, especially in Las Vegas!! I would so come here again for gelato!"

I've tried some of their chocolates which are very good, and a friend once had their creme brulee which he said was top notch as well and cooked well.\n\nBut my favorite thing at Jean Philippe has to be their gelatos/ice creams. They are some of the absolute best ice creams I've ever had as they are just so full of flavor that lingers just long enough in your mouth for you to truly savor the wonder. My friends and I agreed that their cookies and creme was one of the best ice creams we've had in our lives. I'm also a very big fan of their dulce de leche\n\nI should point out that the Jean Philippe at Aria and the one at Bellagio do have slightly different options and some of their flavors presumably rotate.\n\nCan't recommend Jean Philippe highly enough"

The crepes smelled bomb but since the service was so bad, I didn't order one. I asked the lady helping us which crepe was the most popular one. She straight up said she didn't know. I was taken aback by her abruptly rude answer, and she corrected herself, trying to explain that everyone had different taste and that she hasn't tried all of them on the menu. Okay, but don't you work there? Don't you notice which ones are more popular and the bestselling? Can't you ask a co-worker for their opinion? So dumb.\n\nI later went to the other side and got the tiramisu. It was light and tasty, but didn't taste anything like your typical tiramisu. It didn't consist of any ladyfingers and the coffee flavor overpowered the rest, although still remaining a very light dessert.

They're worth it. \n\nThe Bellagio location basically sells the same desserts that are equal in divine taste, but I like The Aria location better for a number of reasons. \n\nFirst, it's easier to order. One half of Jean Philippe is dedicated to ordering beverages and even gelato; whereas the other half is where you can order pastries. Hot beverages aren't bad. Coffee is fine and so is the tea, which can be hotter than the coffee. Don't be surprised if your beverage is equivalent in cost to the pastries over in the next counter. \n\nSecond, there's a designated seating area for customers who actually want to sit down and enjoy their treats. Whenever I bought pastries from Jean Philippe at the The Bellagio, I either had to take them home or \"table stalk.\"\n\nThe cost of pastries are a little pricey and can total and average of $14.00. On my recent visit, a friend and I split a Strawberry and Lemon Cupcake and a decadent chocolate flourless cake aptly named \"Intense.\" The cupcake doesn't resemble a typical cupcake, because it's served in a green cup, and you have to break through the semi-gelatinous strawberry dome and a white chocolate disc to reach the actual cake part. The cake is moist and there are even chunks of strawberries in it, but the lemon was the dominating flavor. My friend ate the cupcake's topping and said it tasted like chocolate covered Trix; I'll have to take her word on that one. Intense had a pink colored macaron placed on top and chocolate squares surrounding the cake; the bottom layer of the cake provided a surprise crunch. Both were filling and delicious, but I'll admit I could've easily finish the two desserts without any assistance.\n\nOverall, Jean Philippe's not one of those places to miss especially if you love desserts."

While I wasn't blown away by my choice of lemon, I can't complain about the price or amount of options JPP has, so that's why I'm giving a four.\n\nI probably wouldn't get the lemon gelato (sorbet?) again because it was super intensely sour -- to the point where my jaws hurt a little bit every time I took a bite. I love sour stuff, but this was a little too intense. This is a very nice place to stop at when strolling around The Strip."

But this location just off thecasino floor at Aria  also has more tables at which to sit in the space and seemingly more savory food choices and a much bigger pre-packaged retail sweets area.  And a nod to Yelp friend Richard S for the heads up that this is a universally accessible location. \n\nCrepes are not usually one of my favorite things, something about the texture,  but  I relied on other Yeeps' reviews to underscore that they were a good breakfast choice at Jean Philippe.  I thought fond thoughts about those Yeeps as we ate because the warm mixed berry crepe was really yummy and plenty for two smaller breakfast eaters to share.\n\nOn another day I might come back here to try gelato from the extensive selection in the sparkling case. Although perhaps not the quiche or other savories as the women sitting on each side of us left quiche and sandwich uneaten, saying each was a little soggy and that they wished they'd picked the crepe instead.  \n\nThe drawback at this location is that while the process of where to stand to order what is crystal clear at the Bellagio store, it seemed a little unclear here on the first visit to the busy Aria location.  Next time we'll know that a) the entry on the right is for seating or exit from seating, b) the middle entry is for ordering food from the glass enclosed food and pastries counter or for making a right turn to walk to seating and c) the entry on the left is for the gelato, crepe and coffee bar as well as the packaged goodies retail display. (Footnote:  If the crepe counter is closed, order crepes at the coffee counter and go back to the crepe counter to pick them up.  At least that was the drill on the day of our visit.)\n\nNow you know if you go.  And we recommend you go.  Almost anything is luscious, but we suggest the crepes of any kind.\n\n."

They can argue they will give you some too. For the most part though they're in the business in taking your money. Jean Philippe is just trying to fit in.\n\n$4.95 for almond croissant or unbelievably delicious cheese danish? Okay.., I was totally down with that. The almond croissant was so good. It was flaky buttery delicious with thick filling of almond paste and crunchy sprinkles of sliced almonds. To die for!! The cheese danish was also as delicious. The sweet cheese filling in the middle was thick surrounded by a fatty laminated danish dough that tasted like heaven and made you run to the gym instantly after.\n\nWhat got me were the  coffees and breakfast sandwiches. I paid $18 for a cup of latte plus a ham and egg sandwich. The sandwich was three slices of white bread, toasted with melted cheese, and a ready to put on a sandwich mass produced food service egg. What the...? \n\nIt tasted ok but it wasn't any better than anything else that was half the price. $18 for coffee and a damn breakfast sandwich was blatant misuse of free market trading. Laissez faire my ass.\n\nThey are so used to taking people's big bucks for minuscule items, that the cashier told me this while I was buying one almond croissant and gave him my cash with my Mlife card at hand.\n\n\"It's just $4.95, miss. That's it. It's just $4.95.\"\n\nEmbarrassed, I put my card away as I felt so not worthy trying to get points for my just $4.95 purchase. I felt so horrible in making that guy had to push buttons, printed a receipt, move his hand to hand me my purchase for just $4.95. Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9, monsieur!! \n\nHowever, that almond croissant.. C'est le doudoune. That meant the tits in french."

I was extremely happy with our choice. The tart looked beautiful, covered with some toasted meringue and a white chocolate ring and tasted just as good. The meringue was light and fluffy and the tart was multicolored, which we did not expect. The crust was a little more compact and a little hard to break, but still very delicious. It is a little costly, so I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have tried it if not for the comp. However, now that I have tried it, I'm likely to make a special stop here on my next trip."

They didn't even heat them up, so that certainly wasn't the cause of the hold up. When we finally got the pastries, it took another 5 minutes to pour us the cup of milk we had ordered when we paid (again, 20 minutes ago).\n\nAs for the food, the almond croissant was tasty, but the nutella brioche was so over the top decadent. I needed a full cup of milk to get it down.\n\nLots of seating. Maybe I'd come back if there was no line, but I find that doubtful considering how slowly they get their food out. I normally think that the star rating should be weighted much more heavily on food than service, but when it's this bad, it dampens the whole experience."

They also make your standard coffee drinks here. \n\nHowever, the crepes have DEFINITELY won my heart here at Jean Philippe Patisserie. My friend ordered a Chocolate Souffle crepe. Basically, they poured the fresh crepe batter on to the sizzling stovetop, moved it to a clear plastic plate, and added custard to the insides of the crepe. Then, they drizzled it in chocolate syrup, chopped brownies, and powdered sugar. Um, YUM! One bite of this crepe and I was addicted! I never had custard inside of my crepe before, and that was what definitely stuck out to me about this crepe! The portion size is definitely shareable, unless you love your sweets all to yourself, heh.\n\nI also ordered a Iced Caramel Latte here, which tasted like your average drink.

After spending a moment figuring out how to actually consume the dessert, I found it to be tasty, but lacking the overall excitement of the tiramisu. It had the creaminess I expected, but the flavor was comparable to any other garden variety cheesecake. And while the presentation was unique, it was difficult to eat. In this instance, perhaps function over form would be preferable. \n\nI would love to return to Jean Philippe to sample the crepes. Unfortunately it will have to wait until my next trip to Vegas. I am happy that I stopped here before leaving though. It's a great place to grab something to satisfy a sweet tooth."

I had just dined at the Aria buffet, and I had so many desserts from there that all I wanted to do was go into a food coma.  All the desserts looked absolutely stunning.  There was so much detail and creativity put into each and every dessert.  I got to try the red velvet cupcake, the cheesecake, and another dessert that I cannot remember.  My favorite was the cupcake because it was probably the nicest looking one.  I was expecting the colored coating to be hard, and was surprised to find that it was actually soft.  It was very rich, creamy, and moist.  Again, it would have probably tasted better had I not eaten at the Aria buffet just a few minutes prior.  \n-1 star because I felt that the staff were irritated that my party took such a long time deciding on what desserts they wanted to get.  I could see the look in their eyes that they wanted us gone because they were taking so long.  I do not understand though, since there was no one else in line, and they did not seem like they were doing anything else anyways."

I figured the actual deserts would be better than most. After dinner in the Cosmopolitan, I came here with a friend to celebrate his birthday. \n\nBerry gelato is my go-to and it was tart, the way I like it. Too tart for my fiance. He really liked the cinnamon roll which they heated for him. Those were probably the best oc what we ordered. \n\nThe macarons were disappointing for $2.25. The cappuccino was bland and the raspberry lacked jam so it only tasted like raspberry essence. The chocolate was only a little better. At least the strawberry piece had fruit filled jam inside. My fiance's chocolate cake was too rich. \n\nOverall, there was a wide variety but it was definitely disappointing. I wouldn't mind paying these prices for high quality dessert but it just didn't measure up. I wonder if done of the newly made desserts are better in the morning. \n\nService was slow. We had to wait in 3 different lines and it was inefficient. Seating is available and self-selected. Remember to bus your own tables."

However, make sure you come early if you want a particular item (like the Almond Croissant) as they do sell out of things! This time around I tried:\n\n-Cheese Danish ($4.25), Croissant ($4.25) phttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-7?select=dqkdPi6K5S-_J6VBw4jANA#dqkdPi6K5S-_J6VBw4jANA]: The Cheese Danish was pretty good, but not as delicious as some of the other items. However, the plain croissant was really disappointing, and had a weird taste to it. I might get the Cheese Danish again but would skip on the croissant.\n-Palmier ($4.25), Blueberry Brioche ($4.25) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-7?select=dqkdPi6K5S-_J6VBw4jANA#pLKoCTqGk01v3AoNUjttjA]: The palmier was amazing! It was a little on the sweet side, but I loved the sticky texture of the sugar glaze and the butteriness of the cookie. A must try! On the other hand, the Blueberry Brioche was just ok, and I didn't like the taste of the marsala or whatever alcohol it had in it. Skip!\n\nI've also tried the coconut cookies they sell in the tubes in the prepackaged items side, and that was just so so. The madeleine was equally disappointing, and the ones from Costco actually taste better. My friends tried the quiche and Chocolate Brioche and really enjoyed it, but I thought the Chocolate Brioche had too dry of a consistency for my liking. Also, the first time I tried the Almond Croissant it was amazing, but this last time it was a little overcooked and not quite as good, but still very tasty! \n\nThere is always a short line/crowd of people here, but the service is much faster than at the Bellagio location. There are also small tables to sit at if you want to eat your food right away. They also sell sandwiches and other caf\u00e9 type items as well as coffee. \n\nAlthough their items are not cheap, it is worth it for the quality. I will definitely be back to sample more pastries (and hopefully their cakes/macarons) the next time I'm in Vegas!"

Since this is my first time, I will try to make this objective and useful to other yelpers.\n\nWe have been to the Jean Phillipe in Bellagio and Aria. The chocolate is great, so the bad experience is really from the service we had in the new Jean Phillipe in Aria.\n\nThis is a true story happened tonight (4/7/10). My kid bought a pack of white chocolate. She did not check the ingredients which has peanuts in there. Like many kids, my kid is allergic to it. The chocolate is in its original package and is not opened. So I thought it would be trivial just to stop by and exchange a different one without peanuts. And it turned out I was so wrong. \n\nMy wife asked the cashier if she can exchange for another one. He asked her for a receipt. But they did not give us any receipt to begin with because we paid for it at the cafe side. So of course we have no receipt. Then the cashier said the chocolate is \"broken\" because the chocolate looks like it had been pressed. My wife went to the shelf and it turned out every pack of the white chocolate look like that. My wife asked the cashier to call the manager. He called the manager. The manager told the cashier on the phone that she would not come out to see my wife, and that the chocolate was \"broken\". They would not exchange it and there was nothing that they could do. My wife gave the chocolate back to the cashier and walked out. \n\nI was waiting for my wife outside the store. When she came out, I could not believe that they would not exchange just a piece of chocolate and that their manager would not even want to see my wife. I mean even Target could do a thousand times better than that. So I went inside with my wife and requested to see the manager. This time after about 10 minutes, a lady manager came out. She seemed annoyed when she came out. My wife was upset because of the way she was treated. Instead of being understanding and pacify her, the manager said she would call the security. To be honest my wife was indeed raising her voice but she was not yelling or using any foul language or being insulting. I thought the first rule of handling customer complaint is to be understanding and let the customers vent out their frustration first. Apparently I was wrong. The lady  manager kept saying she was going to call security. When my wife showed her that all their white chocolate look the same as the one we tried to return, she ignored that. At the end she let us picked a different chocolate. Boy, I never worked so hard for a piece of chocolate, and almost got escorted out because of that.\n\nIn summary in spite of its amazing decor, expect the worst customer service. The chocolate is good. Check the ingredients though, many of them have peanuts, so no-no for many parents. If you want to exchange something or work out any issue, save the grief. They don't care, probably because they have so much business already. Forget about birthday and wedding cakes, their customer services will not back up their products. So pretty outside, completely rotten inside."

This extravagant French patisserie was Jean Philippe's dream.  Along with the extraordinary gourmet desserts were beautiful chocolates, sandwiches, and pastries.  I would stick with the cakes and pastries here.\n\nWe were recommended the Imperial cake and the Chocolate eclair.  Both went really well with the coffee but my favorite was the Imperial cake.  Mmm...  So intricately packaged together - creme brulee, crispy nuts, and dark chocolate mousse all wrapped with a smooth and creamy chocolate ganache.  These desserts are a work of art!  And yes, you will pay for it at $6.50 a piece.    \n\nThis was a delectable and sweet experience for dessert!"

This one has a really good design for seating, while at Bellagio, everyone is fighting for a seat at the limited 3 tables that are off to the side of the shop that are always occupied or the chairs have been dragged to another table so that a family of 6 can dine at a table for 2.  Their selection of sweets aren't are large as at the Bellagio, but for a quick bite this location suffices.  Not to mention it's not far from the sky suites lobby.  I love their crepes, the savory ones comes with a small side salad with a nice vinaigrette dressing.  I always get a box of their truffles to take home with me.  They're so smooth and creamy!"

I always knew they had some awesome sweets and desserts, and that they sold various types of pastries and croissants.  However, if I had known their paninis were so good, I would have come here so much sooner!\n\nAlthough they aren't always busy, there's usually a crowd on Sunday mornings.  Like my friends and I, a lot of people drop in to grab something relatively quick before heading to the airport.  However, don't be scared off by the line; it may look bad, but it actually moves rather steadily.  Finding seats when they're busy, on the other hand, can be a little tough.\n\nWhile a couple of us secured a table, my buddy helped me order the PROSCIUTTO PANINI (~$11).  It looked good on the menu (Cured Italian Ham, Basil Aioli, Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, and Tomatoes), but it tasted even better.  Prosciutto and mozzarella are two of my favorites, but I really liked the aioli and how the bread was perfectly buttered and toasted.  It's a little messy to eat (it drips), but it's delicious!\n\nBased on my sandwich alone, Jean Philippe Patisserie is easily worth FOUR AND A HALF STARS, but I rounded down because of price.  As good as it was, the portion was just a little too light for the money.  Still, it beats the food prices at the airport though.  Now I just have to make my way back to try some of their sweeter treats!"

There are 2 lines; the left one for gelato & crepes (sweet and savory) and the right one for pastries/breakfast items/coffees.  Based on recommendation from a friend, I ordered all 6 flavors of the cupcakes (chocolate, blueberry, carrot cake, strawberry, red velvet, and lemon?) and 2 chocolate desserts (one with a macaron on top and the other was a chocolate mousse).  \n\nThese are not cheap cupcakes, at $6 each they are a splurge.  One lady took our order and gave us the receipt then we continue to the cashier to pay while they're getting our items.  Each cupcake was individually box (very nice) and ready for our 4-hour drive home.  The cupcakes made it home in great shape but not the chocolate desserts.  The chocolate desserts melted but the taste is still so heavenly.  Each cupcake was held in a colorful plastic container instead of the typical paper cupcake liner.  True to my friend's recommendation, these cupcakes are amazing.  Each flavor has a layer of cake, and a layer of flavored-mousse (instead of frosting), then top with colorful gelatin.  For the blueberry and strawberry, there's a layer of preserve.  The cupcakes are not heavy and the size is just right, maybe small for people who are used to Sprinkles but they're not sweet like Sprinkles.  All I can say is they truly are the best cupcakes.  Almost forgot to mention their cookies which are located at the cashier.  Saw them as I was paying and asked the cashier to add one chocolate chip and one double chocolate cookie to my order.  She was really nice (no attitude like other yelpers mentioned) and even went ahead and placed them in the cupcakes bag.  At $3.95 each, these huge cookies (about 5 inches diameter) are a great deal because they are very delicious; fresh, soft, slightly chewy and moist.  There are lots of other sweets but they'll have to wait 'til next time we're back in Vegas."

The last trip we came they had been sold out, this time we arrived on a weekday and were able to try them. They were PERFECTION! The outside was flaky with a bit of crunch because of the light (very light-just enough) glaze, so it crunched when you bit it, the inside was soft and melted in your mouth--OMG!! And I had this Rose flavored macaroon--it was absolutely exquisite! It had the most delicate taste of rose, the almond inside was soft in the middle, crunchy meringue outside..WOW. The nutella crepe wasn't oozing with too much nutella, just enough..We've had those nutella brioches, honestly, they aren't that good, but the plain one is..It's definitely worth going to--it is pricey & there usually is a wait, but we think it's worth it!

While this location may not have the world's largest chocolate fountain like at the Bellagio, I kinda like it better because it's less crowded - which means a shorter wait and they're less likely to be sold out of anything! Plus, the menu and selections at both locations are identical.\n\nDuring our last day in Vegas, my friends and I decided to get some pastries at JP. We went to the original location at the Bellagio first and I got a bunch of pastries there. However, they were out of croissants! Fortunately, when we went to check out Aria I saw that this location still had plenty. While my friends went to gamble, I went to get (more) pastries. Hey, you risk losing when you gamble; with pastries, you always win!\n\nI totally got suckered by the irresistible displays and ended up buying a lot more pastries than I could finish, even with the help of my friends. (Food seems to have some type of mystical power over me.) I got a palmier, apple brioche, croissant (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ&select=2KjxGRE16UT4LSBsq5lSsA), apple turnover, nutella brioche, and almond brioche (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ&select=_5qyR-nH5KbGQOnvAYxuNg). They were on the pricey side - I'd never spent so much money on pastries! All were delicious, but my favourites were the apple turnover and almond brioche. \n\nWe didn't finish it all so I took the leftovers to go in a box, which I carried around with me all day long. Unfortunately, I left the box in the cab to the airport. Epic FAIL on my part :( I got really pouty and my friend said she'd never seen me look so sad..."

The pistachio was to die for.  I mean they got the flavor right on and it even has chunks of real pistachio nuts infused in the ice cream.  I love that.  The coconut was okay but probably a little too sweet for me which means it's way too sweet for the average Joe.  My friends each bought an individual-sized dessert for $7 each.  Add on tax and it's over $8.  \n\nAre the desserts beautifully crafted and delectable to eat?  Of course they are.  Is it worth $8 a pop?  Practically, no.  Unless you're on vacation and spending mode, which we were.  But you can also have all-you-can eat at the Wicked Spoon for $35(?) and eat just 5 equally impressive dessert services and make your money back.

I tried 4 pastries and they were all wonderful:  The Carrot Cake (moist cake surrounded by a centimeter of coconut buttercream frosting, trimmed with white chocolate), Mille Feuille (perfect vanilla custard with puff pastry, topped with fresh raspberries), The Raspberry Macaron (Large parisian macaron filled with fresh raspberries and a custard with a hint of lavender--this one was a favorite) and finally the slice of flan (no, that's not the flan from Mexican restaurants, but rather perfect vanilla custard baked with a buttery crust--yum).  \nI also visited the Jean Philippe in the Bellagio.  They had the same pastries, but the presentation was not as attractive as the Aria's one.  The Aria's Jean Philippe makes you feel like a kid in a candy store.  My recommendation:  Buy one of everything and share with your companions so you can get a wonderful tour of their pastries!"

All I sought was a decent breakfast....  \nAt my mid-level accommodations, connected to low-priced dining and shopping, a good breakfast was HARD to find. Imagine my joy when I happened upon Jean Philippe Patisserie while wandering hungrily through the Aria. The aromas of fresh coffee and hot breakfast sandwiches, the visual of pastries, sweets and chocolates....\nAll flavors of danish were fabulous.  As were the apple blintzes. \nIt only offers counter service, but the quality of fare atones for it.  Sitting aside the casino, you can pass some time watching those few stragglers at the tables who never quite made it to bed the night before as you sip your morning latte.\nNice to have a favorite breakfast spot in the City of Sin. (named for its sinfully good desserts, maybe?)"

The prosciutto panini is SO addicting. Get it and you won't be sorry--you'll be tempted to buy 3 more. That sauce they add just takes it to a whole new level (sorry for the cliche superlatives--I'm a little tired).\n\nThe desserts are great too but one thing I don't like is the amount of sugar in them. Now they are not the sweetest desserts I've ever had but they are borderline too sweet. From a restaurant that sounds French, that's kind of disturbing. France is all about butter and don't put that much sugar in desserts. Generally speaking a lot of desserts in the US are way too sweet."

Smoked salmon was UH-MAZING....thinking about it makes my mouth water now. We came back for lunch and I had gotten a turkey sandwich. Croissant was flakey on the outside but melt in your mouth goodness on the inside. I also got a pain au chocolat to go and a chocolate cupcake for the hubby.

It didn't matter, we just wanted to eat it. We went to the concierge lounge to get cutlery and dove in.\n\nAs beautiful as our cake looked, it did not taste very good. The exterior coating was thick and sickly sweet. It was awful. The interior cake and creme was okay, but not great.

But we shall see***\n\nThere I saw an array of tourists easily gazing upon all the colorful, vivid sweets--plus some sammies--in an equally whimsical & eye-catching ambiance. For maybe 10 or so min of both waiting in line & post-order we ended up w/ a Fruit Tart ($7.50), a 5-in, pie-looking Blueberry Danish ($4), and three coffees (about $13 for drinks).\n\nAdmittedly, regardless of the wait, if you can handle a delay of caffeination for maybe an hr or something, then I do suggest forgoing the cha-chinged brew (albeit smooth) & either go to ubiquitous SBUX (on its own, not so much inside these resorts) or anything w/ \"Illy\" engraved.  As for the pastries, the fruit tart exactly had the superb qualifications of being a delicious semi-healthy indulgence.  The price, though, was considerably steep, especially when you just have to compare it to the sweets in dessert-centric SoCal--which might sound ironic, if you think about it =P.\n\nOn the other hand, I had to save this little paragraph awarded for one half breakfast, perfectly suited for this blueberry-enamored little lady.  The flaky dough was just-right soft with a perfect tinge of butter, and I extol Monsieur Phillippe for using wild, teeny tiny, and outstanding yummy-ness & tartness of this antioxidant-rich delight so magnanimously that I just happen to not bother taking a pic of it =P.\n\nIn brute seriousness I think the one that's blue all over earned a solid four.  Encompassing all others, though, I wouldn't expect so much by not getting too carried away with the long lines--it was quite crowded on a very early Saturday morning--but had very efficient & quick order-by-counter service.  3.5 stars overall, but I absolutely wouldn't mind returning for at least what's on the aforementioned paragraph.\n\n***Okay, it looked like it may not be xP***"

We considered the food at both stores consistent. \n\nMy favorite pastry was the rose macaron - it not only contained fresh raspberries, but also had light cream and a moist shell. However, it tasted artificial and sugary. Furthermore, the rose flavor could be strengthened. In comparison, Laduree's macarons' ginger and rose flavors complemented each other. Laduree's macaroons are better than Jean Philippe's overall.  \n\nMy friends shared the intense chocolate cake, which was creamy and soft, and recommended it to Yelpers. However, in their perspectives, the chocolate crepe was overrated, as it tasted no different from homemade crepes. \n\nI would love to try Jean Philippe's chocolate and other flavors of macarons in the near future.

Fresh made of course. The Forrest crepe comes with a scramble or sunny side up egg on top. It's a piece of art. And it filled up both of our tummies. Don't forget to get a hot chocolate to go with it. They are known for their chocolate. Yum yum yum!"

The chicken crepe was on, the chicken was dry, but the filling made up for it. The menu is slightly over priced for the quality. I expected better, but probably crepe in not their specialty. I prefer the crepe at Paris casino."

Pastries, desserts, and savory crepes all day!\n\nForest crepe: Order it with a sunny side up egg and it's really pretty! Also amazing and tasty...cheese and other goodies in every bite! Wasn't big on the salad dressing, but I didn't order the crepe for the veggies! \n\nBreakfast ham and cheese sandwich: Something like that. It had a whole egg inside, which was cool to look at and also delicious. Wish the egg actually spread to the whole sandwich instead of just the middle, but still good.\n\nFruit parfait: There's this crust separating the fruit from the greek yogurt which reminds me of a soggy (but delicious) crumble. It was actually very good and different from most other parfaits!\n\nWhite chocolate mocha: Very sweet, but you can definitely taste the white chocolate with just the teensiest hint of coffee! Great for white chocolate lovers!\n\nChocolate crepe with oreo gelato: The crepe was not bad, but OH MY THAT GELATO! Delicous! I had never had such good oreo gelato OR ice cream OR yogurt! AHHHH SO YUMMY! Each bite was like eating 7 oreos as it was so full of flavor and the texture was smooth and creamy and oh man. I need to stop before I drool. But yes, try the oreo gelato. You won't regret it!\n\nJean Philippe, I love you so!"

There was a long line at the cafe area and no line here.  However they do serve coffee and crepes.  We went with a savory crepe with ham and it was delicious.  My only complaint was we asked for fried egg on top and got scrambled.  My husband and I both shared it and I thought it was enough for both of us and a reasonable price for a large crepe and 2 coffees.  The coffee was pretty standard but it was all I was looking for in the morning.  The pastries and gelato looked amazing and will make to make a point to try them next time."

Instead of doing a nightcap ritual at a bar, I did a gelato-cap at Jean Philippe!  \n\nI truly made it my goal to try almost every flavor of gelato.  But I ended up finding some favorites, including the stracciata (or something like that it's vanilla with their world famous chocolate) and the mint chocolate chip!  \n\nWhat's more, if you get just a scoop of it, it's actually reasonable for Vegas standards - $3 bucks and some change.  I made a mistake the first night and got a milkshake, since I'm a milkshake fan - that was nine bucks!  \n\nThey have crepes and pastries too.  I might try those out, but I'm seriously in love with their gelato."

They are indeed a very popular item as the line for them is sometimes a little long. But well worth the wait. And I would advise if you order one to share it with someone else as they're pretty big. I also tried their gelato (butterfinger and the coconut) and they were delicious. I could go for some right now yummm :) Their coffees are good, but I'd prefer to go upstairs for Starbucks. Wasn't blown away way the coffee but it's A-ok as the main attraction here is the desserts.\n\nThey have beautiful displays with their delectable confections that you can purchase to take home with you.

On the other hand, there's coffee and breakfast foods, making this a popular place in the mornings for any Aria hotel guest.\n\nFor us, we got their paninis, which was quite delicious. There's a panini with pesto and chicken and the bread is awesome. The only gripe is that even if you get the panini to eat there, they still give it to you in this giant plastic container, which just gets thrown away when you're finished. Oh well."

JPP was obviously a popular choice for breakfast as evidenced by the long lines for service.  No matter.  We were on vacation so we weren't in any particular hurry.  Surprisingly, the line for cr\u00eapes was nonexistent while the line for pastries and Illy coffee was quite long.  So, while I waited to order, pay, and receive my croque-monsieur and cup of coffee, Carol W was getting her made to order savory Italian cr\u00eape filled with prosciutto, tomato, basil, mozzarella, and topped with a basil pesto.  JPP's process for serving customers, though, moved quickly and reasonably efficiently and I received my order in the time it took for Carol's cr\u00eape to be completed.  \n\nSeating is somewhat limited in the small patisserie off of the casino floor.  However, it wasn't difficult finding two seats since most customers just order stuff to grab and go.  As for our food, my croque-monsieur was decently sized, grilled nicely and very buttery (as one would expect from French food) and cheesy.  It was good, but not necessarily transcendent.  I fared better than Carol as her cr\u00eape, while nicely constructed and a generous portion, was WAY over sauced with the salty pesto.  It overwhelmed everything and even threatened to jump plates and attack my sandwich.  Jean Philippe Patisserie does offer a lot of aesthetically pleasing goodness.  Perhaps, we just didn't choose items that put its best food forward!  \n\n3 stars for my croque-monsieur, 2 stars for Carol's cr\u00eape...thankfully, it was free."
