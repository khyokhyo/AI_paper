            "review": "I'm shocked to find this place only has 2 stars on here. I make it a point to come here every time I come to Vegas. Everyone I come with always tells me what a great pick it was. They gave half off drinks which is nice and I always get the pasta primevera. I don't want to hype it up to make it sound like a 5 star restaurant but for the price (and the price of Vegas in general) it's very good. Also nice to watch the rainstorm right outside. Friendly staff, not crowded."

            "review": "Ocean One, you are absolutely AMAZING.\n\nYou know how in Vegas, walking is a must? And you know how walking makes you extremely tired? And when you're extremely tired and it's at least 100 degrees outside, you feel insanely hungry and thirsty? \n\nYeah! Well Ocean One saved my life.\n\nI came here with my parents when we stepped into Miracle Mile Shops and were dying to eat something simple yet filling. We constantly saw ads around the mall for Ocean One flashing $5.99 meals. Not too shabby! So we decided to check it out. When we arrived, we were promptly seated and given our menus. We ordered and our food came in about 10 minutes, so it was quick! But slow enough to let you know they spent some time cooking it. We all ordered from the $5.99 menu because everything sounded so filling already - no need for entrees! Mom was amazed to find that her talapia dish came with mashed potatoes and veggies. Dad ordered a meaty dish, and that filled him up no doubt. I got a chicken caesar salad, and it was definitely very tasty. I loved the chicken and the egg!\n\nOverall, an absolutely wonderful experience. The waiter was extremely friendly and we got to sit in these fancy-looking booths in a fancy-looking restaurant. And our meal turned out to be only $20! Definitely worth visiting :)"

            "review": "This spot is tucked away along Las Vegas strip inside the Miracle Mile Shops. The interior was really nice with a circular bar in the middle and plenty of seating throughout the restaurant. We were seated promptly along one side near large windows with a view of the busy shopping center. \n\nThere is an awesome lunch special here - Each lunch item is only $4.99! There are many options for lunch: Appetizers, tacos and burritos, salads, sandwiches and wraps and entrees, such as seafood and pasta. \n\nI went for the orecchiette pasta with chicken and my mom ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and vegetables- julienned zucchini and carrots. The pasta was delicious! Cooked perfectly al dente, with fresh steamed tasty artichokes, tomatoes & spinach, chock full of delightfully seasoned grilled chicken and plenty of melted parmesan cheese... All in a wonderful white garlic lemon sauce that permeated the dish. Somehow, each bite had just the right amount of sauce. I tried some of my mom's salmon which was pretty good. The mashed potato was fluffy and yummy. The portions for both meals were very generous. \n\nOur server, Frankie was wonderful - genuinely friendly and pleasant. She provided us with everything we needed and took the time to talk with us a bit as well. \n\nI would definitely consider coming back. They also offer $5.99 breakfast, $9.99 dinner and 3 for 1 cocktail specials... Hard to beat those prices!"

We come here when we are staying at Planet Hollywood & even when we're not lol\nAlthough we've tried a few different things on the b-fast menu, we always end up ordering at least a couple plates of Eggs Florentine - They make 'em really good here!\n\nThe service is very fine & generous & the dining area is pleasant while still remaining casual - Great place year after year"

She had the nerve to bring the check mid meal! Ridiculous! I wanted to spill my drink on her bar to give her a taste of her own medicine but opted to just ignore her after my bill came! Will never step foot here again. Mind you I came a couple of months ago and had such a great experience I came back! Go to Mcdonalds before coming here!"

We chose this quaint little place because of the cheap lunch prices. \n\nI had the ceasar salad with chicken (that came with tomatoes and hard-boiled eggs) for only $7.99. My friend had a huge chicken sandwich with fries and that was only $5.99. Very generous portions and very filling. \n\nThe atmosphere is really nice....borderline fancy and casual at the same time. Great place for a quick and easy lunch. Don't expect great service with that kind of lunch price."

Well needless to say we ordered the tuna appetizer along with calamari and the crab cake and stopped there. The food came out and the tuna appetizer looked like 1/5 the size of what was pictured, the calamari was dry, over fried and very small pieces, not much flavor and the crab cake tasted as if it was heated in microwave and not much real crab.  We decided not to proceed with ordering dinner so we asked for the check... the Groupon was \"processing\" so we couldn't use it.\n\nDon't waste your time or money at this place, it looks nice but that's the extent of it."

The restaurant is clean and well decorated considering the $4.99 price-tag for all meals. \n\nService and staff: Staff was friendly and attentive; no complaints.\n\nFood and drink: The food was average to above average. Again, given the price-tag, I can't complain. My friend and I split an appetizer and each of us ordered a sandwich + fries for our main. \n\nOverall impression: Ocean One Bar and Grille is an affordable, fast-service food option ($4.99 for anything on the menu) that is friendly to large and small groups alike."

I ordered the pancakes and hubby the poached eggs.  When I go my pancakes they were lukewarm at best and dry. The server came over and asked if everything was ok. I said pancakes were cold and he immediately took them back to get new ones. He came back within 90 seconds with two new pancakes and bacon. Definitely not enough time to have cooked a new batch. I suspect that they have these already made sitting under a heat lamp waiting for someone to order.  Do yourself a favor and not eat here."

My only gripe is with the service, which was great last time and terrible this time.  We were pretty much ignored, and the waitress only came by when she absolutely had to.  \n\nAnd it's August in Las Vegas.  You could at least ask if we wanted more water (after we drank all of ours 10 minutes in - she never refilled).  \n\nI'll probably go back just because the food is really good.  I'll just cross my fingers that I get a decent server."

We sat Down and the waitress was rude at first site. Gave us water and didn't ask if we even wanted something else to drink and just walked away for 10 minutes. When she came back she saw we had breakfast menus and grabbed them rudely, and gave us lunch ones. I told her the host said we'd be able to have breakfast if we sat quickly. She said some rude comments and told us no. The table next to us was just ordering their breakfast so I didn't get it. Overall horrible customer service!!!! How the heck does the manager let the employees talk to customers like that??? We ended up walking out. The server made us feel so uncomfortable after that was done, we didn't want to eat there!!!!!"

I ordered the Ahi Tuna wrap, Boy ordered the Burrito.  While neither meal was exception and there was to attention paid to presentation, the food was quite good.  The tuna was fresh and the wasabi sauce gave it a nice kick.  It was reminiscent of the Lark Burger Ahi Tuna Burger (which sells for $10, making this wrap a real steal).  I should also note that they did NOT skimp on the fish.\n\nThe $3 Pina Colada I ordered was small, but tasty.  Not terribly boozy, but that's not a problem for me since I'm not a big drinker anyway. \n\nIn a part of town where each bottle of water will run you $3-5, this place is an amazing bargain for really decent food.  It also has a much nicer dining area that once would expect for the price. Give it a shot!"

The mall might be attached to the Planet Hollywood which is too the right of it.  We were able to get a table for the eleven of us without much of a wait.  This was nice considering we had 4 hungry kids.  I was also impressed that we were able to get a table so quickly on a Sunday night.   Prices here were decent which took me by surprise.  It's a nice restaurant, large in size, and a bar in the middle.  After we all ordered, our server brought out some cheese pita bread for us to snack on.  It wasn't actually long before all of our food came out.  I don't think we even finished all the bread.  I ordered the Mahi sandwich, and it was great!  The Mahi was so tender that it was falling out of my sandwich with each bite.  I was also able to have some of the seared Ahi my brother ordered.  It was good, but I'm glad I order the Mahi.  I washed my pallet with a pint of Guinness... aahhh!!!"

When in Vegas, you have an abundance of outstanding culinary choices and we settled on Ocean One after a long day of shopping and we were just passing by and thought let's just grab something here. Shoulda kept walkin.\n\nOur server was kinda funny, though. He looked like a kid and was probably a foreign exchange student or something. Instead of waiting on us, he watched World Series of Poker on the TV. \n\nTheir 2-for-1 drink special is like any other drink special scam on the strip. Small glass and almost no alcohol. I got my 2nd one to go and it came in a kids cup.\n\nMy wife ordered a pizza. The pizzas look impressive. Looks can be deceiving. Had the basil and artichoke....and cheese. Lotsa cheese. The pizza was like a heap of cheese, shreds of old basil, and canned artichoke hearts on one huge cracker separated by the thinnest layer of ricotta cheese. Bleh.\n\nWhile writing this review, I forgot what I ordered. I think it was a chicken greek salad. The chicken was meager and the flavor was greek to me.\n\nPass."

The mango vinaigrette and marinated onion not only blended with the greens, but worked well with their salmon filet that was cooked just right.  The pistachios added crunch and flavor to this dish too.  \n\nThe half pound sirloin burger didn't look like it was half a pound, and taste wasn't all that either.  \n\nThe wild mushroom pepperoni pizza was good in size, but lacked mushrooms and pepperoni.  A crispier crust would've helped too. \n\nAs for the Grilled Chicken Club...I've had better!   \n\nService was above average though.  Tracy rocks!

Next to the Brazilian buffet and in front of the lightening/rain simulation.\nATMOSPHERE: Nice big open place. Looks very nice but the food does not match the atmosphere. I didn't like the tables covered with white paper. It was annoying and cheapens the atmosphere. I felt as though that was out of place considering the overall feel of the place. Booth and table seating available. Very good for groups.\nFOOD: Selection of American food. Very little for vegetarians here except pizza. Mediocre food. Has items kids would enjoy. We ordered the \n1. Mahi sandwich which came with fries. The fish was sooooo bland.... Very disappointed.\n2. Other family ordered the salmon salad and salmon entree, which looked good. Pizza was like cheese on top of a cracker the crust was so thin.\n3. Creme brulee was quite good with a  thicker crispy layer on top just the way I like it.\nPRICES: Reasonably priced for Vegas except for the dinner entrees. It perplexed me that most of the dishes were $8-10 then the dinner entrees jumped to $20+. We decided to try this place since we had a restaurant.com certificate. $25 off of a $50 purchase not including tip, tax.\nSERVICE: Good. No complaints here. There was someone that came by to take our picture and offered a free picture with optional purchased picture. The free picture was on a post card that was a restaurant advertisement basically with our tiny picture in the middle. \nCONCLUSION: Very disappointed. Will not come again. Soooo much better food in Vegas and even in the Miracle Mile Shops."

I thought it was very annoying how customers would walk out in between our table and the table behind me (literally 3 ft away) Do people not know where the exit sign or the front door is? \n\nThe breakfast menu is small and there are absolutely NO SUBSTITUTIONS for anything on the menu. What a fail. My husband and I don't eat pork and he likes steak in his omelettes but that's not an option. Very disappointing how they don't cater to their customers. I ordered the french toast (with no meat) and got charged for an extra egg as a side since they don't substitute anything. I ordered a mimosa and they have a 3 drinks for $10 deal. (Good deal if you like to drink) They will still charge you $10 even if you don't get 3 drinks...what a ripoff.\n \n\nWe waited 30 minutes for our food and so did everyone else around us. When the food finally came, the portions were so small. Our waitress was so slow. We left hungry and we definitely won't be back. There are so many other places to eat.

I had the Pepperoni wild mushroom pizza... Hmm. I don't know, but on a 12 inch pizza, shouldn't you have more than 4 slices of pepperoni on it? and shouldn't you have more than 1 mushroom chopped up into 5 pieces? Now I know why this place is cheap. You wouldn't think it to be cheap from the looks of it. The place looks like an upscale restaurant.\n\nThey need better cooks back in the kitchen. That's all!

We were actually surprised how good the food was, considering the prices weren't ridiculously priced like the other restaurants nearby. I ordered a burger and fries for only $6.99. It was half a pound of sirloin and you have the choice of adding cheese, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and onions and it came with fries. Pastas are around $10- $14 (the mushroom and chicken pasta as well as the chicken penne was very delicious). Filet mignon for only $27.\n\nOur server Milcah was nice and knowledgeable of the menu items. I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for somewhere to eat while you're shopping at the Miracle Mile Mall because it's inexpensive, but also doesn't fall short of taste."

I told the server that i was vegan and he instantly replied with \"what is that?\" with an over the top attitude and looked at me like i'm stupid or that i was annoying him. i explained to him nicely what a vegan lifestyle entitled and we were able to switch the cream sauce to a tomato sauce. He came back maybe 10 minutes later to verify everybody's order very quickly as if he didn't really care but he actually had it down correctly. Another ten minutes later they bring out the food and i'm presented with a plate of pasta covered in a garlic CREAM sauce. i explained to one of the other employees that i ordered it with a tomato sauce because i can not have dairy. He was much more polite than our server. He took the plate back and then they were able to correct it. The pasta was decent once they got it correct but the overall experience sucked ass all because of our server.

Ohhh yeah music to my ears...err wait beauty to my eyes!  We sat at the bar which had several people already there, all of who I will say did have food and it looked and smelled amazing.  The waitress promptly greeted us and offered us up menus to see what we could get for happy hour, which was pretty much everything!  From margaritas to martinis to pina coladas!  Also, she let us know that you can mix and match your 2 for 1.  I had to pinch myself to see if I was dreaming as this is usually not the case - especially in Vegas!  A couple of us opted for doubles instead of getting something different and man were they strong.  The regular drinks were also very good and you could tell there was actually alcohol in them - again not always the case with Vegas specials.  The waitress then starting to chit chat with us a bit and upon hearing we were celebrating a birthday offered said bday boy a free shot.  Again I was blown away by this as this is our third trip celebrating a family member's journey into the land of legal drinking and the FIRST time any bartender offered up a free anything.  We all had high hopes of going back to partake in some drinking here again but alas it did not happen however thanks to the great customer service and the buzz that kept us going for a few more hours...until our next stop!"

When ordering, Waitress would not let my husband and daughter share a hamburgar/Fry combo  Said the price was already reduced so no sharing, no offer of letting regular price be charged so they could share.  So they ordered nothing.  I order the same combo. and only thing I asked was no onions and she told me If she put too many things down the cooks would mess it up so I could pick the onions off.  I could not believe she said that lol I only asked for No onions.  Wow,  alot of confidence in the cooks. ( We really should of walked out at that point but we had already ordered and received our drinks) Anyway I said ok.  However I could taste onion even tho I picked it off, ruined the burgar according to my taste buds.   Outside advertisement it offers a choice for side item and I was never offered anything.  I just asked about fries and she said yes.  Took about an  hour to get our food. They was confused as to what food went where.   My daughter ordered skirt steak and shrimp and even tho it was pink it was tough, as if it was well done.  Quanity nor Quality Was not worth $19 for that menu item.  Salmon Sandwich that my daughters boyfriend ordered and My son childs menu chicken strip was both good.    Now back to the waitress.  Several times when my husband and I was talking she'd come over and interrupt, stood around like she was trying to over hear.  It was weird.   The frozen alcoholic drinks comes out in what looks like a childs glass rather than whats shown in the advertisement.   $76 for one hamburgar combo, shirt steak and shrimp dinner, salman sandwich, childs chicken tenders, two sodas (one was a child size but was charge the adult price) and two $3 frozen alcohol drink and one glass of beer.  Over all, the food, time it took, and most of all the service was NOT worthy of what we paid.   I personally don't recommend this place and we will never eat here again.  The waitress wasn't worth a fast food job let alone a job at a restaurant of this class.  I still can't believe she said for me to pick off the onions.  I said Huh the first time cause I truely thought I misunderstood her.  She repeated the same thing.  LoL  I actually did laugh out loud and SMH.  Beyond bad customer service.  and that's the main reason for lack of stars.  She was about an early 40's lady with black hair in a pony tail.  I shoulda got her name but that was my mistake.  I was still smh about the onion/cooks thing.  I think from now on when ordering at a place we don't kno we will wait to order our drinks with our meal; so if something this bad occurs we can walk out.  Our visit was Saturday 4/09/2016 in the evening."

Can it?  Because if you'd just lower your expectations a bit and understand that for a measly $4.99 you should in no way get your hopes up, you'd be golden, stopping in for a bite during Ocean One's $4.99 lunch special.\n\nAnd that must have been the problem: we expected a little too much from Ocean One.\n\nAlthough the pictures we took speak for themselves--depicting a rather sad looking burger and a very dry chicken--the service wouldn't prove to be any better.  Ours, Rufat, saw our table only three times: once to take our order, a second time (when after I'd called him over) to return with my corrected order, and a third time to drop off the bill.  Truthfully, we'd wished we had just purchased a less than mediocre lunch elsewhere.  After all, Vegas has more than enough to offer.\n\nBesides, a $2.99 soda, when added to the bill, alters that \"deal\" you had imagined receiving.  Your meal now: $8.00.  That's quite slippery of you, Ocean One.  Nice work!  We won't be seeing you again."

I was trying to find a place since my other half and I were seeing two shows to eat in between.

Although the Pizza my other half had was amazing so I would recommend that! However for as cute as it looks it was not romantic, was slow, the customer service was not great which is surprising for Vegas. It is certainly a place to go if you just want to eat something fast, but don't be expecting much. And do not go there for romance even if it looks charming you can go else where to \"whoo\" your loved one. I would even try the place across the way it looked better, I checked it out when we were done eating."

I had been on the Las Vegas Strip for hours and walking from Ebar in Fashion Show Mall toward the south Strip my reliable hunger was kicking in. I was strolling the corridors of the Miracle Mile when this sign caught my eyes. $6.99 for a half pound cheeseburger with toppings in a full service restaurant sounds to good to be true, however, I am cognizant of the fact that Miracle Mile with Planet Hollywood have some decent deals in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. So, I thought, \"what is the worst that could happen if I gave Ocean One a try?\" \n\n    Upon entering the restaurant, I questioned the $6.99 burger. The friendly hostess let me know that it is available for dinner and that it didn't start for an hour (5 PM). \n\n    Fast forward to 5 PM, I reentered the exact scenery and talked to the same hostess. It was obvious that the burger deal wasn't a gimmicks at the exact time that they weren't going to give prime seating to that customer who came here for the $6.99 burger at a table in the restaurant. My choices were at the bar or in the patio overlooking the walking path of Miracle Mile. I chose the patio. The hostess seated me at a table visible to the restaurant so that they would know I'm there. A few minutes further, a waitress knew I was there. This waitress wasn't nasty, enthusiastic, or friendly. \n\n   I had done enough walking. Now it was time to dig in and do some eating. The burger I was eating was nothing like a Smokestack burger down the Strip in Shake Shack, or nothing like a mouthwatering burger at Fukuburger down the Strip in Hawaiian Marketplace, or as thick and juicy as a burger in Outback down by Showcase Mall. With a bottomless Coke this came out to $10.72 before a tip that made Ocean One a far better deal than OVERPAYING for a $17 dry Philly cheesesteak meal at Nathan's or $16.50 for a cheeseburger at the Treasure Island Cafe. The cheeseburger and seasoned fries were good. It did the job by filling me up at a good price where the only gimmick is that I was looking in at the attractive brightly lit dining room from the patio. \n\n     In conclusion I was satisfied just like my wallet was with the $6.99 cheeseburger meal. There are so many dining options on the Las Vegas Strip and so many nights for me to hang out here that Ocean One looks like a one time experience in the near future."

It is not rocket science, it's eggs and bacon, toast and potatoes. Coffee. It met my expectations and for the price, on the strip, I don't think you'll find any better deals. \n\n - eggs were cooked well (sunny)\n - bacon was crispy\n - bread was whole wheat and toasted, not buttered\n - potatoes were not my thing, a little too tatter tot, but that's not a big deal to me\n\nWhat really made this restaurant stand out was Frankie. So, take that into account - 4 stars is because she was so perfect. :)"

The chicken tastes like it is frozen chicken and was not grilled as stated. The frozen mango margarita was a blended margarita with mango flavoring pumped into the glass. So when I drank it I'd either get all margarita or all mango flavoring...gross! I told the waiter I didn't like it. He asked why and I was honest in telling him it was nasty. I guess I still had to pay for some nastiness I didn't drink."

We came around 1pm with a party of 7 and were seated promptly. The lunch menu consisted of $4.99 plates. I was pretty excited about each plate being $4.99. \nCome on. $4.99 lunch plates in VEGAS?!? Yes please! And they have a decent amount of plates to pick from. We ordered 2 appetizers of the spinach and artichoke dip. Really good. I ordered the marinated flank steak cooked medium well. It came with mashed potatoes and veggies. The mashed potatoes were buttery good. It was my favorite part. The steak was good as well! Way better than I expected since it was only $4.99. The service wasn't too great or too shabby. Our server was very friendly though."

On a busy Saturday afternoon in Vegas all restaurants had long lines and the only place that had immediate seating was here. I should have taken that as a warning sign. Plus, I didn't bother reading the Yelp reviews, my bad.\n\n We got seated in the \"patio\" area in the mall along with 5 or so other tables. Next to us was a bridal party with a bride in her tight boob popping dress and veil along with her bridesmaids who had the same type of dress minus the veil and in black. We waited awhile for the waiter to arrive and when he did we placed out entire order.\n\nMy boyfriend and I each got the grilled chicken $5.99 lunch special, the spinach artichoke dip and waters. The drinks and appetizer came out quickly. The chicken came out shortly after. The chicken was good as was the appetizer.\n\nThe one star review is not based on food but the service. We only saw our server at our table once, when we ordered. The reason being was he was at the bridal party table flirting with all the ladies and helping them figure out the best deal for them to drink as much as they could for cheap. I do understand that when you are celebrating a wedding or another special occasion you will get some special attention. However, not to the point where you are giving all the other tables on the patio a big FU.\n\nHow bad was the service? So bad we didn't even get a refill on water. In fact, I had some water bottles in my purse to drink while walking the Strip. Instead we used the water bottles to refill our water glasses.\n\nThe total was $26 so we paid and took off. I noticed when we left the patio area everyone else that was still sitting there looked just as pissed as we were."

When he brings my credit card receipt, the itemized bill magically disappears.  I ask for the receipt and find the $2 charge for hot water and gratuity has been automatically included.  His explanation was that when you order more than 6 total items, the computer reads it as being a party of six.  REALLY??? STFU, right???  Asked for the manager, and literally about 10 min. later, some jackass working the bar, is supposed to be the supervisor.  Just the same unapologetic ass pretending to be the manager, with the same sorry excuses.  \n\nLong story short, had him redo my bill and forgot to tip him.

Don't let that fool you.  It's horrible.  First we ordered an appetizer.  Then I ordered the club sandwich.  Everything came out at the same time.  When the waiter put down my club sandwich I said \"oh that's not mine food, I ordered the club sandwich\". it was mine alright.  Their club is on a plain old hamburger bun with a plain full chicken breast, 2 slices of bacon then covered in a gob of greasy melted cheese.  It was a mess.  Not a fresh club sandwich.  It was disgusting.  I told the waiter that it wasn't a club sandwich and I didn't want it.  He told me too bad.  I ordered it and I had to take it.  Once food was ordered it couldn't be taken back.  Apparently that was the company policy. They don't waste food and his manager wouldn't allow it.  I asked to speak to the manager but he wasn't available and my waiter was the acting manager.  I left the sandwich untouched.  \nAlso, watch out for the 2 for 1 drink special. Another ripoff.  My sister order a glass of chardonnay.  2 for 1, right?  Less than a 6oz pour of cheap table wine and charged $10. Oh, you get the second glass free, but the first one should have been a $3.00 glass of wine in the first place so how is that buy one get one free when both together should have been $6.00.  This place has bad food, bad customer service and is a ripoff.  I guess they think because their cliental is mostly tourists they can get by with this.  So move on hungry folks.  There's so many wonderful restaurants in Vegas and Miracle Mile.  Let places like this go away."

I imagine they cut the cost of food by slacking at a few other things noticeable to a person like me who looks at everything a bit Closer.\n\nEXAMPLE: The Paint on the walls are worn and dirty in many areas through out the restaurant. The vinyl cushions in our booth and in the booth next to us were extremely cracked on the seat and backrest. I was afraid it would tear my outfit as I slid in and out.... I was waiting for a hand to squeeze thru a crack and wave hello at any moment, lol! The ladies restroom toilets are (or were) automatic flush. Guess they both have been broken down for quite a while and now there are laminated signs asking you to flush them manually. There are two different faucets in the ladies restroom also. One sink with a touchlines sensor like we are used to... and the other sink has an old fashioned push and release faucet like the kind we all had in elementary school. It looks pretty jacked up honestly. I have never seen this in a restaurant.....but they also kept two bent forks under the sink for \"repairs\" of some kind. Can anyone say Shabby Chic? Also there are Mix & Matched silverware to eat with in the dining room. I noticed  me and my mothers utensils did not match (not even close, he he! ) But I really don't care about all that. \n\nI would best describe this place like eating at a Ramada hotel restaurant. They are trying to portray \"classy\" ...but fall just a bit short. Not exactly sophisticated either although they are trying their hardest with cloth Napkins and candles on the table to look that way. Regardless...I wouldn't come to this place Celebrate anything...Just Eat.\n\nIts difficult to describe what this place is so I will best describe it as a \"casual eatery\". NOT Date or Celebration material. And I don't understand WHY in the world they would take reservations when this place is not  \"reservation\" material in my opinion. It's like making reservations for Jerry's Famous Deli! \n\nThis place is an uppity Cafe....nothing more, nothing less.  Very nice servers, Comfortable decor, Good food, Cheap Drinks.

I guess it wasn't a fair choice since I grew up with Southern cooking, and bland gravy is a crime. I splashed Tabasco on to make it more interesting.\n\nJust keep wandering or accept that your meal will be very average and very slow. This is nothing above diner food for breakfast. I think I've had better from IHOP."

I ordered a delicious pasta primavera dish and had enough left over for breakfast the next morning (it was that good), and my husband enjoyed filet mignon (though, he notes, it was not the kind you can \"cut with a fork\"). The best part of the meal was the complimentary pita bread, showered in butter and cinnamon (even if it was served after we had started our main course). Peanut butter chocolate cheesecake for dessert was a good choice, though a bit standard in taste. The bill was rather steep, and our waiter was totally creepy (we have since remembered him as the Phantom of the Restaurant). BUT the food was yummy and didn't completely break the bank, ie $50 for 2 entrees and a dessert - in Vegas. \n\nGo to Ocean One if: You want a good sized, quality entr\u00e9e with some great pita bread; you have a few pennies to spend; you crave a quiet atmosphere (albeit it's location in a mall); you enjoy creepy waiters!\n\nDon't go to Ocean One if: you are in the mood for a cheap snack; you don't want to spend more than $20 per person; you have high standards for cheesecake!"

Anyways, service was great. Our server (who happened to serve my wife last time she was here a while's way back - small world...or planet...bahahaha) was quick, on point with all the food, and he accepted our lunch order even though we were 15 minutes before lunch hour officially started. The price: $5. Per. Dish. It's an epic conflagration of great food with good service at an unbelievable, fantastic, jaw-dropping price of epicness.\n\nWe ordered the calamari appetizer. Because it was five bucks. My expectations were low. Because it was five dollars. It came out and the crunchy breading with the deliciously soft calamari and acidity of the marina sauce was great - probably better than most places that I've eaten at in Vegas. Because it only cost me five moolah. I got the flank steak. Which only cost me cinco dinero (hope I got that right). Combined with the sauce, some asparagus, and mashed potatoes, it was a delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite that it came out medium rather than medium rare. But I'm not complaining because it cost five greenbacks. \n\nMy wife got the chicken Caesar salad and somehow got full off salad which seems impossible to me. And the dough necessary for payment was five. So this whole delicious escape from the mile strip of people hawking at you to buy stuff that you don't want but feel like you need because it's thrust into your face cost me only $20.

I waver between 3 and 4 stars.\n\nThe ambiance, look, and layout of the restaurant are as if it is fine dining. But they bring you a plastic sticky menu with very ASSORTED choices.   Pork chops, pasta, mahi mahi, teriyaki?  There arent many choices but all none of them lead you to believe that the restaurant is American, Italian, Greek, whatever. They are all over the board. But it worked for me. I had the goat cheese salad which was plentiful and delicious and reasonable. We also had the spinach artichoke dip which was good and plentiful.\n\nMy husband had a hamburger which claimed was delicious. We also had the 2 for 10 drink specials and they were tasty.\n\nOur server was very nice, knew the menu and offered suggestions, and was efficient. She took great care of us.\n\nI think we would go back but maybe not.  I cant put my finger on this one."

The hamburger was clearly a frozen patty even though the waitress mentioned it was NOT ever frozen to me. I asked before ordering. It was gray which shows also that it's probably old/not fresh. Sadly, even the side salad was disgusting. None of this comes even close to the grossness of the fish sandwich. Holy moley...just opening the sandwich to look at the fish was an absolutely disgusting sight. For crying out loud the place is called OCEAN ONE, and they can't serve halfway decent fish?? It was clearly old/not fresh and should NOT have been served. Buns were stale as well. Spinach and artichoke dip was edible but not good. \n\nThis place needs Robert Irvine or Gordon Ramsay to come in and help. I would be scared to see what the kitchen looks like..."

I said \"two please\" and she grabbed two menus and walked to a booth table, and in the same motion placed the menus on the table and continued walking without even a second glance. At this point I wanted to get up and leave because I hate being treated like my business is not worth the service they are being paid to provide, but alas I decided to eat anyway because the other choices nearby were not what I was in the mood for. \n\nThey offer an \"express lunch\" menu which when I inquired about the express 5.99 burger meal was told it's a 3oz pre-cooked, well done burger patty (Isn't that a slider?) so I went with the 8.99 burger meal instead.

With so many great restaurants in Vegas, skip this one. The only plus was that there was no waiting for a table. Now I know why."

We didn't really want to spend a lot of time eating nor did we want a lot of food.\n\nWe stopped in because I remember seeing an ad for a cheap cheeseburger. We didn't really want a table so we sat at the bar. The bartender lady was high or something. She didn't pay attention to us and she was frowning the whole time with her hood on her head.\n\nWe mentioned the cheeseburger ad and she said that it's 6.99 and that we could add bacon for no additional charge, so we did. I asked her what else came on the burger and she acted like it was a trick question or something. She told us that it came with mayo, mustard, ketchup, lettuce, and onion all on the side. Then she walked away.\n\nThe bartender brought the burgers out, after about 12 minutes. She dropped them and left. The burgers had bacon, lettuce and onions on it. Nothing was on the side.\n\nWe had to get up three times are ask for condiments because the bartender was no where to be found. By the time we got the condiments, the fries were lukewarm, which pissed me off. Well actually the fries was a surprise to me. I didn't know the burger came with fries. Either way, they were cold by the time I got to eat them.\n\nThe burger was dry, even with the mayo. The bacon was undercooked and the fries didn't have a lot of seasoning. Even though the fries were not hot, it still tasted better than the burger. The burger tasted like a boot.\n\nWe will not go back!"

I have walked around the Miracle Mile Shops looking at the menus of various places, but until now, I hadn't eaten in this area.  The Groupon gave me the excuse to go.\n\nI had a reservation for 5 PM, unneeded as it turned out.  I looked at the menu while my server, Tracy, brought my iced tea.  For a starter, I ordered the sesame tuna.  It was  5 pieces of tuna, previously seared and arranged on a bed of seaweed salad with wasabi cream and pickled ginger topping the salad.  The tuna was dry.  It was just stored too long before being used.  The plating was certainly nice but the dryness was very noticeable.\n\nFor the main, I ordered the filet, cooked blue.  The server returned from another table and checked with me to make sure that's what I wanted before putting the order in to the kitchen.  See the photo to see that it was cooked the way I wanted it.  A plus vote for that.  Along with the filet were some mashed potatoes and some yellow and green squash stings with carrot strings.  The vegetables were very good--crisp and not overdone.\n\nFor dessert, I got the Peanut butter cheesecake.  It was good and had a nice peanut butter flavor.  \n\nOverall, the meal was OK.  I'm glad I tried it once but I probably wouldn't come back.  I was disappointed with the tuna appetizer.  Without the Groupon, the dinner would be very similar in pricing to some of the steakhouses at Strip hotels.  There are better choices with nicer atmospheres."

I didn't get the chance to see the reviews on yelp (gasp!) but we were pretty happy with the experience.

My boyfriend got the grilled salmon. The calamari came out sort of looking like a mess, in a pool or marinara and shredded parmesan but it was actually really good. I'd never had calamari like that but it was my favorite part of our meal. The mahi sandwich was great, nicely cooked and the jerk seasonings were excellent. A little spicy but not burn my tastebuds spicy. They came with seasoned fries that looked freshly hand-cut and those were great. My boyfriend's salmon was ok. It came with shredded veggies and mashed potatoes that were also sub-par. But for about $7 each entree, it wasn't bad at all. The service was quite slow, but since the food was great, i think they deserved a better rating than my fellow yelpers had previously given them."

My girlfriend had the marg. pizza and it was bland with no flavor.  Also, they cover up the tables with a piece of paper as if your supposed to draw on it like maccaroni grille.  If you are trying to save on linen costs don't put linen on your tables because then you make it seem like you want your guest to eat at a kids table with paper on it.  I feel sorry for a place that could have so much potential.  I hope in a month or so as I maybe visit it again management reads this and changes."

Three of us had their $6 burger special.  The bun tasted stale and like styrofoam.  The burger itself was okay but not anything fancy.  One of my girlfriends had their chicken pasta dish and she hated it.  My other girlfriend had their margherita pizza and she was not pleased. Service was horrible.  Our waitress had no sense of urgency and did not refill our drinks regularly and after looking around, we came to the conclusion that we were not alone.  The dining room was not very busy at all but it seemed all the of the other diners like ourselves were twiddling their thumbs because of the disappearing waitress that we all had.  The dining room felt dead.  Don't bother going here. It looks pretty and clean from the outside but it's probably because business is slow. Don't waste your time."

Since we stayed at Planet Hollywood this was in the mall connected and easy for Lunch.\n\nThey were not very busy and the service was less than average. There was little follow up with us on the meal progress and little follow up after the meal arrived. Once the meal arrived we had limited service. Plus I have never been to a restaurant that refused to give customers a paper receipt. They only have emailed receipts???? They clearly do not want business from those traveling for business and need receipts for expenses. We can't assume everyone has email or likes email. Plus not all companies will allow an email receipt for expenses.\n\nWe had a group of five ordering. One of my group ordered the seared tuna ahi for his meal. He had only eaten some fruit for breakfast prior to lunch and felt fine. In just a couple hours he became violently ill with food poisoning. He was throwing up and major stomach pain's. He even had to have the hotel come clean his bathroom as the violent and rapid throw up prevented him from making it to the bathroom. I have experience with food safety and I have no doubt it was the tuna from the restaurant not handled properly. However, it's  waste of time to tell them because they will simply say you can't prove it was them, you can't prove it wasn't something else he ate even the day before, you can't prove blah blah blah and they will deny all responsibility. My co-worker spent the rest of the entire afternoon and evening in his room and bed sick. \n\nTwo of the others in group became sick to their stomachs but to the extreme the one did. They felt nausea and stomach cramps the rest of the afternoon themselves. \n\nSince I can not scientifically prove my co-worker received food poisoning from this location; even though my circumstantial evidence indicates he did, I will say eat here at your own risk."

I had a satisfying grilled chicken club sandwich for lunch that came with a nice mound of fries for $5.99. Service was friendly altho not the fastest - it was one woman with a Ukranian accent covering quite a few tables by herself but she was hustling. \n\nBottom line: Nice option for a casual lunch or dinner and people watching in the mall - won't wow you but should satisfy you.

One night my son and I decided to try out Ocean One Bar and Grille.  The prices were surprisingly inexpensive (which should have been my first clue - I mean, even the air is expensive in Vegas).  He was excited to order a virgin strawberry daiquiri, but was sorely disappointed when the waitress told him that all their daiquiri's were pre-mixed in machines.  Oh well - so much for that!\n\nWe ordered a quesadilla as an appetizer and both had burgers.  The quesadilla was certainly nothing special - even the salsa tasted like it was bottled.  Our burgers came out sans bacon and by the time they got around to bringing us a side of bacon, our burgers were cold.  My son ordered his 'medium', yet when he bit into it, there was no pink to be found.  It was 'well' as can be.  The fries weren't even good - they had a slight \"freezer\" taste to them.  \n\nOur waitress whisked our plates off the table while we were still eating (just taking a break).

Literally sat down for 15-20 minutes and no one came with water nor take our order. All the servers were standing around and chit-chatting. We tried to get someone's attention and got ignored.

About 15 minutes later the excellent food arrived via a different server. \n\nWhat didn't arrive was the check, nor any explanation, nor any staff. After waiting 15 minutes after completing the meal I tracked down the hostess. Eventually 25 minutes after finishing the meal, at 10 PM, I was told they had a computer problem and I was not to leave until it was fixed and the bill paid. \n\nI asked how much it was based on the menu prices for what we had. The reply was that this couldn't possibly be determined without the computer, and if I left before paying they would call the cops!  They didn't disclose my maximum term of captivity until they fixed their computer, if that were to take days or weeks. Nor if they would release the kids and only keep the adults as hostages. \n\nFinally 30 minutes after we finished the meal we were presented the bill, but not the 2nd drink we paid for. No adjustment. We paid and went to bed. \n\nJust unbelievable. Got a computer problem? Easy, just hold your patrons hostage and threaten them."

One of the most affordable spots to eat at one the strip - you'll get better deals here than from any fast food joint. \n\nWhether you're on a budget or not, definitely stop by here for their awesome deals. Lunch plates are always $4.99 and you can get different deals for drinks - the best one is 3 for $10 cocktails/wine. \n\nI've tried their spinach artichoke dip, fried calamari and quesadilla as an appetizer. All delicious. For an entree, I always order the chicken with orecchiette pasta. All the portions are good and more than worth their price tag counterpart. \n\nIf you're looking for cheap drinks specials or some good deals on grub, stop on by!"

It's a bit tricky to find if you're trying to locate it from the outside (walked in a few aimless circles religiously following Google Maps), especially with some recent road construction. But if you happen to be snooping midday around the mall area of Planet Hollywood, definitely hit this place up for a great value. \n\nI ordered the grilled salmon dish, which I found to be a lot more appealing than my friend's skirt steak plate (but to each their own taste buds, right?). The grilled salmon came with a small handful of mixed veggies and a scoop of mashed potato, which was complemented with the lemon herb sauce. It was satisfying, although it does leave you with wanting for a bit more of a meal after you finish. Overall 10/10 would recommend, so definitely come here to stay within your budget!"

We were seated immediately and service was quick. Our waitress was awesome and I wish I could remember her name but she was blonde with glasses and the friendliest person we had met all weekend. We all ordered the $3 pi\u00f1a coladas and strawberry daiquiris which were bomb. The lunch menu had a great selection especially for the price and we were all able to order something different. We were expecting smaller portions with the $4.99 price but we all received a lot of food. We ordered 2 spinach and artichoke dip appetizers because it was that good and the salsa that came along with it was my favorite part of the whole lunch aside from the daiquiri. So for fast food prices we were able to nurse our hangovers with a big lunch with drinks included in a nice atmosphere and great service."

We walked from The Paris to Planet Hollywood into PH Shops.  Because we were sick of walking and were past hungry, we decided to try this place.  Not the best selection ever but we ordered a petite filet, medium with garlic mashed potatoes.  I had really low expectations going in...Surprisingly good!  Meat was tender, cooked to our order, nice portion size. The potatoes were good...the veggies under the steak and potatoes were kind of random....overall, good food.\n\nThe server was good...checked on us often enough.  Wine special for between $6-7...I had a glass of white wine.  Nothing to write home about but wasn't horrible either.  They also have a full bar.  Prices were right in the middle...not cheap late night but not very expensive either. \n \nThe thing I thought needed the most work is the d\u00e9cor.  Probably a couple years ago, this place probably looked really nice.  However, it's gotten run down.  The wood floors are ruined and were clearly never taken care of.  The booth seats are run down and torn.  Maybe this restaurant was forgotten about during the Aladdin-Planet Hollywood renovation!\n\nI've seen it before while shopping at PH and never went in.  We were happy with the meal we had there but probably won't make a point to go back."

We were in dire need of breakfast, and we were impressed by this restaurant's advertised breakfast prices (breakfasts start at $5.99 here! This is in MAJOR contrast to the prices elsewhere). \n\nSince we were there at an off-time (mid-morning), the restaurant was about half empty. We were promptly seated and given menus. They offered a lot of breakfast fare, with a lot of omelet options and other popular dishes. We all ordered a variety of eggs/toast/hash brown potatoes and pancake dishes. All were really good, not greasy (the bacon was really good!), brought to our table promptly. No complaints at all.\n\nDid I mention that the prices were really reasonable? \n\nOne weird incident, though: a gal came by our table, large camera around her neck, saying she takes photos of diners at the restaurant as a courtesy and the photos are free and she'd like to take our picture. Our family of four gussies up as best we can (considering we just flew in to town super early that morning and had been walking around for hours, waiting for our hotel room to be readied), and this gal takes our photo. She says she'll return with our complimentary photo shortly, and then she goes to another table to take a picture of the couple there. At any rate, we had ordered our meals and received them and then eaten them, gotten our bill and then paid, and then left. The camera girl never returned.

My first experience was okay, just like any other restaurant, however on my second visit i know I will never be back. \n\nWhen seated, my group of friends asked for waters, with lemons. Our waitress acknowledged she would bring us lemons, and she didn't. While we waited we finished our waters, and when she finally came by our table, one of us asked her for the lemons. The waitress simply made a \"mm\" sound as acknowledgement. She brought the lemons a bit later, and by then, our cups of waters were empty.\n\nWe then asked her if we could have refills on our drinks, and she again took awhile to refill them. Keep in mind we should not have to keep reminding her for refills when we clearly don't have any water or drinks. \n\nSoon after our orders arrived, and we began to eat. Again, no refills on our waters, and not once did she stop by and ask us how we were doing or if we needed anything. Actually, she didn't even come near us, at all, for us to flag her down.\n\nWe talked amongst ourselves and agreed she didn't deserve a good tip, if any. We finished eating and sat at the table, with no bill. We were in no rush to leave, however if we were we clearly wouldn't have been able to since she wasn't checking on us to bring one anyway.\n\nOne of our members got up and asked her for our bill, and shortly later she brought it to us. We were upset due to the gratuity being added to each and every ticket in our group, which consisted of approximately 4$. We strongly felt as if she did not deserve that, so again, a member went to an employee and complained about the automatic gratuity, and asked to speak with the manager. The employee then walked over to our waitress, who was in fact the manager. \n\nWe were amazed to discover this, due to the service being so horrendous and her not knowing any better on how to manage a restaurant \n\nThe manager, who's name was Antonella, be came really snotty and told us there was nothing she could do, and that the gratuity was automatic. We realized there was nothing we could do, so we just told her the service was not worth what we were being forced to tip.    \n\nAntonella then replied (without an apology) that it is not her fault and she had a full house.\n\nWe looked around and the place was half empty. Free tables everywhere. She then turned her back to us once we pointed this out. \n\nOver all, this was a horrible experience and I will be back."

Food is ok, a good value but obviously pretty average taste and quality.  \n\nI've been here before for breakfast and remember their omelets being pretty decent (although accompanied by greasy potatoes).  For lunch, I've tried the salmon salad with orange dressing and penne pasta - both good, but unremarkable.\n\nService could be better.  In addition to being painfully slow (30+ minutes to get our food), my friend tried to substitute a side salad for his fries.  The waitress said this couldn't be done (odd enough), but that she could bring him a separate side salad.  The side salad turned out to be a full-sized salad and was billed individually at more than the price of the sandwich he ordered.  When he inquired, she said there was nothing she could do because the salad \"was no longer at the table\".  Was weird more than anything else.\n\nI wouldn't discourage someone looking for a quick, cheap meal from eating here, and might go back again one day when the line at Earl of Sandwich is long..."

I ordered a quesadilla that I didn't finish because it was just too greasy for my liking. My mom ordered a chicken \"chop\" that reminded me of hospital food. I like that it tasted light and low-sodium but it also lacked in flavor. What really bugs me, though, was the server rushing in and out several times. He came because he had to and left like he had better things to do. He didn't even take my drink order. My mom asked for water, no ice and he said \"okay, two waters...\" and rushed off. Ugh! That bugs me! I don't expect much out of the food for $4.99 but always expect good customer service. Plus!!! They include gratuity! Don't tell me what to tip!"

My husband has the surf and turn and I had sea bass. I haven't had that quality of food in a long time, so we are definitely happy customers. Our server was a young man that totally helped ease my husband's anxiety by changing the tv to men's US vs Mexico soccer on Friday (God forbid he miss a soccer game even on vacation).

I guess it was decent food, but the main trend we noticed was that everything was super salty. My girlfriend ordered the Shrimp Parmesan and it was literally getting a fork full of salt. We had to to-go it and I brought it back to the hotel and recooked it, diluting the dish with water and letting it simmer. It was pretty good after that, but I didn't pay to have to recook my own food. I had the California Wrap which was pretty decent, but nothing special either. My friend had the Talapia and a chunk of his fish was missing from his plate while my other friend ordered a pepperoni pizza that was just tomato sauce and a few pepperonis on a super thin crust. We were pretty unimpressed to be short..\n\nThe only silver lining this place has is that their drinks special is quite legit. This is actually where I'm giving it a few stars in this review. Two drinks for $10 in their special -- I tried the Key Lime Pie which tasted off, but then followed the drink up with their Almond Joy which was basically a disguised White Russian. Pretty good way to wash out the salt in our mouths!"

They are not culinarily adventurous so we looked for a place that would have standard american fare.  The miracle mile had many places to choose from to eat, but we saw this menu and felt it might please everyone's tastes. Little did we know it would only serve the tastes of those who LOVED awful food and \"rip off\" drink specials (suckers.)  \n     We entered what looked like a fairly nice restaurant by a friendly hostess.  Our server promptly came up and offered us drinks and showed us menus. We asked about a two for $10 drink special offered on the menu.  He let us know the drinks listed on the menu were the only specials that evening. All were sweet and made with \"smirnoff\" flavors. I dont drink that brand so asked for my vodka up with olives. My husband tried one of their drinks and our parents stayed with water. We ordered a quesadilla to share. My father in law ordered a burger medium. My husband ordered a goat cheese salad and I ordered a \"Wild\" mushroom pizza with pepperoni.  Sounds good so far, right? \n      About 10 minutes later, our server came back with 2 waters and my martini that looked cloudy and REEKED of vermouth. My husband's \"special\" was a 3-4 ounce drink. It looked like a shot glass with a straw. My martini was supposed to be JUST my vodka up with olives. I tasted my drink and I really do believe (after 8 years of bar tending experience) that I was only served vermouth in a glass. The server came back about 10 minutes later and I told him the issue. He was confused at what I was asking, but took the drink back. I understand some servers arent as educated about this so it didnt bother me too much at the time.\n     10 minutes later a food runner came our quesadilla. Still no martini. We all tried a bite and bit into a large tortilla sandwich FULL of white flour. I've had better at taco bell.  :(\n      3 minutes later we received our entrees. My pizza was only button mushrooms, undercooked cheese, on a lavosh that was also undercooked.  Still no martini. My husbands salad was wilted to the point of mush with a big ball of fried goat cheese.  My father in laws burger was a hockey puck with cold fries. \n     3 minutes after that, my drink came. A martini glass that had 2 olives and some vodka and the vermouth that was originally in the first glass. We were all disgusted.\n     In order to get on with our evening, we asked for the check after waiting for a manager that never appeared, even though they werent busy. On inspection of the bill, our server added gratuity even though only 3 of 4 ate. We signed, left, and will NEVER go back. I'd rather dumpster dive behind McDonalds. \n     We did try to call the next day and alert the \"manager\" of this issue. We waited on hold for 20 minutes before we were hung up on.  We tried to call back to get a busy signal for 3 hours or so.  \n     Long story short, I dont know WHO or WHAT owns this restaurant, but I have a funny feeling it may have been a used car salesman that lost a job, and hired his fellow salespeople to run a \"restaurant.\"\nYou'll get a good \"looking\" place, but get shafted in the end.

Part of our group was already eating here and told us about the $5.99 lunch choices... Just what we were looking for!  I ordered the tilapia with house veggies and mashed potatoes and it was perfect!  The fish was tender and moist, the veggies were delicious, and the mashed potatoes were creamy and tasty.  I recommend it if you are nearby and are looking for an affordable meal."

For drinks, we ordered the Pacific Wave, Mojito, and Strawberry Margarita. The Pacific Wave was served frozen and consisted of pi\u00f1a colada, mango, and melon liquor. It was garnished with an orange slice and cherry. It was sweet and refreshing. I feel like I was on a tropical island. The Mojito was served over rocks and consisted of Barcadi Rum, club soda, and mint leaves. The Strawberry Margarita was served over rocks but didn't really taste good.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the Orecchiette Pasta and Margherita Pizza. The Orecchiette Pasta consisted of orecchiette, artichoke hearts, onions, tomato, spinach, and parmesan cheese in a lemon garlic sauce. The pasta was garnished with freshly grated parsley. The dish was flavorful and had a fragrant aroma. We felt that the pasta was a bit on the doughy side and slightly overcooked as the pasta was stuck together. The Margherita Pizza was a thin 10\" square pizza that tasted like a cheese pizza with shredded basil and sliced tomato on top."

So my friends and I were headed to a different restaurant when we were walking past and saw they had a 3 for $10 drink special and their food was pretty cheap. So we decided to give them a try. The hostess was polite and sat us right away, however, that's where the good service ended. I forget the waitresses name but EVERYTHING she did took FOREVER! Took forever to get drinks, take orders, etc. Not to mention when we drank all our ways, ginger ale, or alcoholic beverages she didn't even take the time to see if we wanted more. Literally everytime we needed something we had to flag her down to ask. It was extremely frustrating. Upon further observation it was very clear she had way too many tables and she couldn't handle it. However the food was pretty good. I got the filet and added on some shrimp and it was only $23 so you really can't beat that. Also it all tasted really good. They really need to work on adding good service to the good food cause that was absolutely terrible."

I have a feeling that she automatically adds tips to everyone's check so she can manage to make a living. \n\nThe food was edible. My husband had far more complaints than I did, from raw vegetables to lack of shrimp on his dish. My food wasn't great, but it was hot and freshly made. \n\nI wouldn't eat here again if given the opportunity.

The most important memory: first time I ever had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nThis restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood Mile of Shops or formerly Aladdin hotel. It's strategically situated in the middle of that long streak of overpriced shops. All that walking gets my buddies and I hungry. What do we do? Eat at One Ocean.\n\nThe restaurant actually doesn't have many walls. Instead, large window spaces make the restaurant feel more open and spacious. A nice touch.\n\nEnvironment: the open feeling of the restaurant is very welcoming. The place never really feels crowded although because of it's location and the setup, it's always loud. If that doesn't bother you, then have a seat and take a look at the menu. The decor fits the personality of the restaurant which is trying to pull off a casual but sophisticated look.\n\nWaiters/waitresses: Our waitress did not go above and beyond the call of duty. She only came to our table to take our order, drop off food, drop off the bill, and pick up the bill. This was probably the worst part of this particular dining experience. Otherwise, there is nothing that really stands out about this employee.\n\nFood: had the half pound sirloin steak burger. The patty was cooked medium well (no pink) and was covered with melted provolone cheese. In addition, it was topped with the normal staple of lettuce, tomato, and raw red onion slices. All together, this was pretty tasty. It had the distinct flavor of a home made hamburger prepared with fresh beef. The restaurant was a little stingy with the steak fries. It didn't look as if they were seasons but a hint of garlic was evident.\n\n\nDrinks: only water. Sorry.\n\nRecommendation: EAT!"

They offer seating inside the restaurant and outside in a faux outdoor scene.  We ordered the Margharita Pizza and a house salad, costing nearly $20.00.  Most dinner entrees average between $8-15 here.  The Margarita Pizza (ours about $8.99) was the highlight of our dining experience, mediocre in taste.  The salad, however, could have been better.  Not much of a flavor to be desired as the Vinaigrette tasted different than any we've tried and they doused our salad in it.  \n\nSumming up this review, I personally would not give this place another try, but to those looking for a fairly quick and cheap meal in or near Planet Hollywood, this a decent stop."

First time I went it was myself and my pops and I we both had the French toast which was REALLY GOOD!!! with scramble eggs and sauage...no complaints for $5.99! SO the next morning I dragged myself out of bed and went back for another great breakfast but the only difference was the service was very poor which was crazy being I was there by myself there wasn't much for the waiter to do! I found myself waiting for a refill on Apple Juice that I desperately needed after a long night of drinking, for 26 mins(YES I COUNTED!..lol) then when I was done with my meal I was once again waiting, and waiting for my check...30mins! really?! It crossed my mind to just walk out but I didn't want jail time added to my story of my bachelor party trip! So all in all good food, decent prices but a hit or miss on customer service..."

I don't think this deal is good on weekends maybe only on select days. \nWe ordered a Stella (on draft) and Amstel light.\nThe skirt steak that came with mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed veggies in a Cabernet reduction. The steak was a little chewy but still good. The sauce was delicious esp soaked in the mashed potatoes.\nThe 3 cheese omelet with house potatoes. The potatoes were well seasoned and crispy! They were really good.\nThe mahi mahi tacos were pretty good and it came with salsa, pico, and sour cream.\nFor 5$ entrees and 3$ beers you can't really go wrong. They had a lot of other dishes on there that is definitely worth a try like the burger."

The whole entire lunch menu includes appetizers, entrees like steak and salmon for only 5 dollars and desserts. lunch is from noon to 5p.m. Normally when food is this cheap it taste cheap, but this is not the case. The food is great and full of flavor. Where can you go in America and get two entrees for 10. Even the servers cant explain how the owner is able to lower prices. Dinner can range $10 for most entr\u00e9es. If you want filet mignon it's affordable at $22. I suggest the salmon salad, lemon pepper salmon, marinated skirt steak, steak quesadilla,chicken lollipops, spinach artichoke dip, chicken Caesar salad, peanut butter chocolate cheesecake and apple pie with cinnamon ice cream.  The strawberry and pi\u00f1a colda are only $3. You can get three glasses of wine for $10 and 3 shots for $10. You will thank me later."

They have great lunch specials at $5.99. I ordered grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and vegetables while my friend ordered the mushroom penne pasta. I think my grilled chicken was better than her mushroom penne dish. The chicken was a little dry, but immerse it in the mashed potatoes and all of a sudden it becomes okay.\n\nThe most annoying part about the experience is that there is a lady who comes over to your table and asks you if you want your picture taken so you can have a souvenir card. However, as much as this sounds enticing, it is a nuisance because once they bring you the postcard, they also try to sell you your picture. Beware, just kindly decline when this lady approaches you. I do not know why they do this. \n\nAlso, the seats on the outside of the restroom are uncomfortable (they are plastic chairs). The seats in the restaurant look much more comfortable and I'd recommend sitting inside."

I was in Las Vegas with a group of friends for the weekend and when we woke up after a long Friday night we were STARVING. We were staying right behind the mile of shops and decided to walk in there and find somewhere to grab breakfast/lunch. We had the choice of a few places, but we liked what was on the special board for Ocean One and decided to give it a try. Boy did we regret that decisions almost right away!\n     The place was not crowded at all. There were customers of course, but many open seats. We were seated right away, but then waited..and waited...and waited. Finally our waitress came over and took our drink order. We again...waited. Once our waters (and other drinks) arrived we were not given a refill for the rest of our meal. I ordered the grilled chicken and mashed potatoes which were actually quite good. Four of the people in our party ordered different wraps and every single one of them said they were the worst wraps they have had. None of them took more than a few bites and we had to stop to get them hot dogs when we left. \n     The food wasn't horribly priced for Las Vegas, but we did wait a ridiculously long time for our waitress to collect our checks and bring back our cards. One of my friends paid in cash and the waitress must have been out of change because she brought back only cash and not the coin change....and rounded DOWN instead of just giving my friend the extra dollar. \n     I won't be coming back here."

The filet was not cooked properly, but you could tell that it was quality meat, which is why I can't give a one star review. The service was ok; nothing to rave about. The drinks were weak. The salmon was definitely not fresh or wild; it was dry and the tomato and onion that it came with was about the size of a quarter...super disappointing. I was expecting more out of the experience.

I had read they had a decent oyster selection, but when we went there were 3 choices. We ordered a dozen of mixed oysters and then a half dozen of fried oysters. The oysters came out chilled and were pretty tasty. I wasn't really impressed with the accompaniments, but I was pleased with the oysters. My problem though was with the fried oysters. They were 1) gritty 2) overly battered (too much batter to oyster ratio) 3) overly fried. This was disappointing. Also as soon as our waiter realized we weren't going for the more expensive dishes he seemed to disappear. We had to ask for our check a couple of times and then waited several minutes for him to come. I didn't appreciate that. Nothing really special and not worth another visit."

Once we were seated outdoors around the corner, it seemed as if we were out of sight and out of mind.  Everything took long from placing our orders to receiving our meals and getting the final bill.  It was extremely stressful being that we were on a time constraint, and had to leave the hotel an hour later.  We had to gobble down our food once it arrived and had asked for the bill at the same time.\n\nOur simple meals consisting of waffles, pancakes and bacon were pretty decent, but the extremely slow service brings down their rating another star or two.
