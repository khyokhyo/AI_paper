            "review": "This was our fourth time to visit Four Kegs and it was just as good as ever.  We originally came after seeing it on TV.  Our favorite things to order are the original Stromboli (pepperoni, ham, sausage and cheese wrapped in the yummiest dough ever) and the Cajun fries.  A large strombolli easily feeds 2 people and only sets you back about 12 bux.  The fries are 3bux and are plenty for 2-4 people depending how much you want to stuff yourself.  Crazy good deal!! Very much a hole in the wall place with great food and people.  We tried the veggie strombolli this last time and it had great flavor.  The restaurant isn't in the greatest area but totally worth the short drive (about 8 miles west of the strip) especially if you go for lunch."

My favorite thing that I always order are the deep fried pickles with ranch and hot sauce. I've never actually had their stromboli, but its all pretty much good, classic bar food."

The service is nice and the food is great.  i always order fingers plain with about 8,000 sides of hot sauce... they never charge for the extra sauce even though its absolutely ridiculous of me to order it.  During football season they offer half priced wings during games... I love how they cook their wings... they are always crispy and good.  I love that this place isn't a PTs or any other typical/ franchise bar... it is definitely a hidden gem... i always call and order food to go and it's always hot and delicious... after midnight they offer half priced pizza and strombolis... it's been on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and since it has it has gotten a lot of visits... see the pin board to let them know where you're from... but it has never changed...always has my vote for go to bar food and cold beer!"

The original Stromboli is a solid 5 stars.  I make it a point to eat here every time I am in L.V.  \n\nAs for the place itself....  I have read other reviews about how seedy it is and awkward the building is.  But until you here what the owner did, one would not understand.  The Four Kegs was a bar that served food.  When Las Vegas passed the law that you could not smoke where food is served, the owner had two choices.  Either close the food section and keep the bar only or do what he did.  Thankfully, he came up with the unique design the encapsulate the bar in the center, which keeps the smoke in the center and completely away from the eating area.  Luckily for me, he came up with he design because I love the Stromboli."

            "review": "Stromboli.......Stromboli........That all you need too know about Four Kegs. After three hundred plus reviews not sure what could add. Try I am..This was my second or third visit to Four Kegs. It not very often come but the few times made it been for some late night grubbing. I came for dinner celebrating a hana ho dinner with my old roommate that was in town visiting. \n\nOther friends joined us so talk about deep fried spread of munchies and naturally some Stromboli. The deep fried food aka chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, and zucchini sticks. Nothing special just your normal bar food. If there is anything worth mentioning about them. I enjoyed that they were nice hot hot, not overcooked, and the hot sauce was good on the chicken fingers. Really the star of the show is the Stromboli. I ordered the full size Meatball Stromboli. Awesome! The size is ridiculous. Even the smaller size it can easily be for two and the large if one person can eat the whole thing GOD BLESS. Once you get the first bite never know just might finish the whole thing. I had two pieces left. The reason find it so addicting. The crust is perfect nice golden brown, the dough is awesome, nice moist and fluffy dough cooked even all around, and the tomato sauce inside is delicious. The filling can choose from few different ones but went with the meatballs. The fillings just as generous with the portions. In every bite had piece of meatball. Just solid solid Stromboli. The prices are super cheap under ten dollars for one. Other things on the menu but if come Four Kegs Stromboli the way too go!!!!\n\nThe place talk about personality. I have no idea the length of time but Four Kegs I know been around for long long time. It really shows in the inside. It truly defines hole in the wall. The bar area itself in super small. They have bunch of poker machines all around and even some separate away from the bar. The restaurant area is off to the side. Talk about hole in the wall. They give you plastic forks and knives. Paper plates. At the end of the day about the food for me. I just think you will find some of the best food in hole in the wall spots like Four Kegs. The Stromboli is one of them. If triple D think it worthy then worth checking out. Just don't expect to be blown away the minute you walk in."

            "review": "One opportunity I wanted to take advantage of while on vacation in Las Vegas was trying one of the restaurants I saw on Diners, Drive -Ins and Dives. My wife and I decided on Four Kegs. \n\nDriving up to it at first glance and it's easy to see which category this place falls under: It's a dive. \n\nBut I mean that in the most positive sense of the word. \n\nUpon entry you are greeted with a smoke smelling bar / gaming room but to my surprise and delight, the dining area is sectioned off completely by windows and doors so the smoke doesn't seep into the dining area. \n\nYou can tell this place is proud to have been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives as there are multiple pieces of Guy Fieri memorabilia on the wall, but it added a little charm to the restaurant. \n\nAs we sat down we were promptly greeted by a waitress (older, friendly lady whom I suspect has been there for quite some time). She was ale to take our entire order without writing anything down and obviously remembered it perfectly. On top of our table there were at least five other groups of people she was attending to yet it didn't affect her attitude or pace in the slightest. \n\nWe started with the fried pickle spears and the cajun fries. Both appetizers were perfect. The breading on the pickle spears was near perfection and seasoned perfectly. It was obvious they use fresh ingredients and high quality pickles. The cajun fries were steak fries (I assume freshly cut) with buffalo wing sauce an seasoning on them. Again... perfect. \n\nI ordered the french dip. My only complaint was that the roast beef was SLIGHTLY dry but that was easily offset by the au jus. Not the best french dip but definitely in the upper echelon of french dips I have tried. \n\nMy wife ordered the fish and chips (Friday Special) and she said it was solid, but not spectacular. She still finished them off and I tried them. Good quality seasoning. \n\nMy step daughter had the wings and, on the kids menu, they wisely put the sauce on the side rather than completely dousing them. She took leftovers home and polished them off too. \n\nOverall, combining the service, freshness and quality of all the food,this is a good four stars. If I ever return I will have to try the stromboli, which seems to get a lot of praise."

I remember eating pizza here with my mom and dad in the late 70's and just like then, I still get excited when I walk thru those old doors and sit in one of those old booths!! This IS old style Vegas, most non Vegas natives can't handle places like this, maybe it's not fluffy enough like P.T.'s or Timbers. Well that's just fine, march your bootay right on down to those places and leave the best damn pizza, Stromboli and ice cold beers in those great old mugs to us that love places that have stayed true to us born in Las Vegas natives for so many years! Done with my rant, where's my Boli."

I don't know if I would travel out of my way for it, but for bar food, this place is shockingly good. The prices are also reasonable and the portions huge. \n\nThe mac and cheese bites are awesome, a little heavy but perfect for sharing. The meatball stromboli is especially huge and surprisingly great for a non-Italian restaurant. The cajun fries are essentially just fries and buffalo sauce, which is obviously tasty but also disappointing. The burgers aren't the best but they're still pretty good and super filling."

            "review": "Waited along time to try this place out. It's a dive bar but not a bad thing. If after 12:00am you have to ring a buzzer but you'll figure out. Location is a bit past Fremont if you take I-15 n. \n\nTo set the stage I live in Hawaii and a good Stromboli is harder to find then a cure for cancer. I'm literally drooling from anticipation, the sauces, cheese, a nirvana of favors, a gooey paradise. \n\nIt was ungodly good maybe because it's been so long. Not the best Stromboli but one of the best I ever had. Sauce not as spicy maybe watered down a bit and the dough although very good, was separating from the cheese like it was previously frozen.  I'm guessing they have to since place is so busy. Place was packed at 930pm at night. Overall worth a trip from the strip. \n\nPros- fianc\u00e9 loved it, her first Stromboli. Beer cold, lemonade good, very inexpensive. 21 for 2. \n\nCons- .99 for marinara sauce to come with the Stromboli are you kidding me, should always be standard. this nickel and dime thing with charging for everything not a fan.\n\nHighly recommend for a one time visit but still on quest to find the best Stromboli,"

They also have some good lunch specials. Prices are decent and portions are big. \n\nPROS:\n-Pizza: It's so yummy and has a good sauce to cheese ratio. I always get it with pepperoni and jalapenos and I love that their jalapenos are spicy, not like many other places where they taste tangy but have no kick at all.\n\n-Stromboli: Generously stuffed, pretty big in size and delicious.\n\n-Buffalo wings: Perfectly cooked, crispy and covered in awesome buffalo sauce. Nothing worse than dry buffalo wings, but you won't have that problem here!\n\n-Philly Cheesesteak: Another hit. Big with plenty of meat and lots of melted cheese.\n\n-Fries: Thick, hot and crispy. Perfect!\n\nCONS:\n-It's a little out of the way and in a weird neighborhood.\n\n-They don't have a hostess stand so when you walk in it can be somewhat confusing if it's your first time. It's worse if it's busy because the waitresses are occupied so you end up just standing in the middle of the dining room or walking around not really sure where to sit or who to ask for a table. Once they notice you though, they're pretty good at seating you right away, it's just awkward for the first few minutes. Just thought I'd mention that. haha!"

When you walked in everybody knew who you were the servers were super friendly, the food was always fantastic, and the beer was consistently ice cold. Can't say the same anymore. I started going to four kegs more than 20 years ago and I just don't enjoy it anymore. The food is crap at best and inconsistent all the time. The servers with the exception of one older lady who works in the back dining room the servers have no personality whatsoever and you feel like you're going into an old time coffee shop most of the time.

This place has been here for quite some time as the rest of the shopping center has died due to the highway expansion this place still thrives.

The outside was nice and crispy but there was alot of dough. I wish there was more meat inside. What was there was good. Not a fan of the sauce on the inside but that's how it was ordered.

Walked in and just a wierd setup for the bar and resturant.  We walked around to the dining room and found a seat right away.  Our waitress was nice, attentive, yet somewhat odd.  Thats normal in some of those dive bars/resturants so no deduct for that.  \n\nBoth of us ordered beer and my friend got his in the mug.  The waitress said it was suppose to be more frosty than it was but as long as its cold beer its good.  So much stuff to order on the menu but I was craving a burger so I ordered the western bacon cheeseburger.  My friend ordered the meatball sandwhich.  Everyone around us seem to be enjoying the food so we were excited to eat it up!!  Lets just say it was pure disappointment.  My burger was suppose to be medium, well it was well done.  It was so dry and flavorless.  The bbq sauce and cheese was the only good stuff on it.  My friends meatball sandwhich was cold.  He only ate half of it because of that reason.  We paid for our food and headed out.\n\nI probably wouldnt check this place out again.  It just didn't leave a good taste in our mouths.  I am all about some good dive, grease food, but this just wasn't the place."

Every time my husband and I go there, we have to order their Hot Wings.\n\nTheir Hot Wings are the \"perfect\" spiciness, in that they have a bite to them but not so much as to numb your lips. Their Pizza is amazing and they usually have some deal going on where it is 1/2 off during Nascar or NFL season. Stromboli there is amazing. Enough said. I also like the fact that you can come and eat there after midnight and get 1/2 off of both Pizza AND Stromboli, which is good if you are a night owl or a clubber. \n\nI live in Henderson, but gladly drive up to the Summerlin area when I'm in the mood for Pizza, Wings, or Stromboli, just for this place.

Don't be rolling over there with your Bling-Bling, Prada Purse or Gucci Sunglasses matter o' fact if you have some yard work, gotta change the transmission on your ride, replace the roof on your crib or clean out your pig pen might wanna do that first, then without showering or changing you should roll over to the 4 kegs for your boli - trust me you'll fit right in, an instant regular.\nI love Diners, Drive Inns and Dives the show so on Guy's advise I put it on the bucket list.  On my last trip to L.V. I made the venture, SADLY, Guy must inhaled too many bleach fumes the last time he got his wig done up.  I ordered the one of O.G. boli's, one meatball boli, a pizza and some wings.  Certainly smelled good when it arrived at the table and they looked perfectly cooked, nice and golden brown on the outside with cheese oozing out the sides - AWESOME! is what I thought.  I was so disappointed after the frist few bites so I tried the other boli, the pizza and the wings it was confirmed - BUST! (WAH, WAH, WAAAAAAAAAAH).  The Marinara sauce that Guy proclaimed to be \"off the hook\" tasted like it was straight form a can (BTW, the cook looks like he just got out the joint, charged me extra for the marinara sauce - thanks buddy!) The dough which I feel is the most important, was bland and too \"doughy\", meaning it was thick/heavy and fills you up fast.  Pizza I've had better from the freezer section of the supermarket and the wings - NOTHING special.\nSeriously, I don't mean to be a buzz kill and I for sure don't understand why most of the reviews are beyond 2 stars but I supposed we all have different taste buds.  With that said maybe you should give it a try and judge for yourself, my humble advise plz re-read the first paragraph and roll with a buddy (preferably Vin Diesel).  Paz!"

The aroma of stale spilled beer.  That smell is earned at places like McSorleys in the village (Manhattan- one of the oldest continuously operating bars in America), but not here. I don't think they have re-invested any of the profits they have generated from DDD back into their facility or business.  \nPlenty of parking in front. \nThe siren-song of the DDD fame drew me in, but unless I hear of improvements, I will not come back."

For my to go order, you pay at the bar then proceed to a room that should be limited to employees only. \n\nThe Sicilian pizza was hard and disgusting. I even tried to improve it's flavor with ranch. Ranch usually makes everything taste better.Their cajun fries were recommended, so we had that too. It seemed like they took soggy fries and dumped hot sauce all over. Their chicken fingers and fried zucchini are the only reasonable options. \n\nI know this place is a local institution, but it's not for me. Everything is not for everybody."

I had eaten at a different restaurant every night all week and was getting ready to get on the plane and get out of town.  I had Four Kegs on my list and was determined to get in one last DDD before I left town.\n\nI used GPS to find my way here. It is definitely a dive type bar.  It is on the side of a strip mall.  There are no windows, and there is a sign saying \"over 21 only\" and \"after midnight, ring bell for entry\".  Shady.\n\nUpon entering, you are in a typical looking bar with (because it's in Vegas) some video gaming machines.  It smells of smoke.  Off to the left, there is a glassed off area where you can go through a door and be in a small dining room area (with no smoke).  \n\nSince I had to get on a plane in 3 hours, I didn't want to overdo it, so I just got the meatball stromboli as recommended by others on Yelp.\n\nIt was very good, but I can see why people complain.  Northeastern folks are used to a certain kind of stromboli (and Italian food in general).  Midwest and west coast people really don't know anything about the East coast pizzerias and subshops so they have no preconceptions going in.  \n\nThe bolis here have a very buttery crust, almost like a pizza hut pizza.  The fillings are home made and the meatballs are salty but good.\n\nIf you are from NY/NJ, please forget about your preconceived notions of what a stromboli should be and just enjoy it for what it is,.  I liked mine a lot and finished the whole thing.\n\nNote that they don't call the sauce \"marinara\", they just call it a red sauce, so just order that if you want to add an additional dimension to the boli.  I ended up not using half of it, but it wasn't bad.\n\nI would come back with friends to hang out here, it's a very laid-back place.\n\nThe parking lot was full, if that means anything."

This definitely fits the bill of a Dive.   Wifey and I have driven past this place countless times and kept telling ourselves, yeah, we need to check that place out.   Well, we finally did a few weeks ago after attending Big Dog's Winterfest.   \nThe place is very easy to find.   it is right off the Jones exit.   You can't miss it.   We found a place to park pretty easily.   The place wasn't that busy for around 8 pm on a Saturday night.   We walked in and went past the bar area, through the interior doors to the dining room in back.   \nWe we quickly greeted by an older friendly Asian lady.   We grabbed a seat and she took our drink orders pretty quickly.   We looked over the menu, but we were on a mission for one thing, Stromboli.   Our waitress brought out the drinks very quickly and we placed our orders.   I got the meatball 'boli and wifey got the standard 'boli.   Both came out in about 10 minutes which was pretty quick.   And yeah, they were awesome.   We totally enjoyed ours.   It may not look like a lot of food, but it is.   We both got to go boxes.   \nOverall:\nFood - Excellent Stromboli. \nService - Terrific\nVibe - Divey\nDrink - it's called four kegs because they only have 4 beers on tap.

We come there late because we both work late.The staff usually is always friendly and they have really nice specials for a late crowd.The neighborhood is a little iffy, but I have always pretty much felt safe because they usually keep the riff raff out.That being said you can imagine my shock and dismay when we went there last night and was treated like complete trash by one of their staff members.I believe the guys name is Shane but I'm not certain.I don't personally know this one particular guy because we usually get the heavier set guy, Rob, who is nothing but nice.I believe I have seen this guy a few times on our way to the back to enjoy their pizza when I don't want to sit at the bar.So anyway at first my ex jokingly rang the boor bell more than once with a smile cause he and the bartender are usually cool...he was thinking he'd at least get a laugh.So someone comes on the speaker and says: \"you two wont be getting in here ringing the bell like that.\" So we patiently wait a few seconds with smiles and we still aren't being let in.I then ring the bell once again and then the door opens by this other bartender we don't normally see....he then looks at my ex and says you aren't allowed in here anymore.At first we think its a joke cause you just never know with guys and we know we have never done anything except act silly with the bell...then when my ex says, \"Really? Why not?\" the guy just unleashed in this angry fury with the foulest language I have ever heard from any employee ever telling him why he wasn't allowed in there anymore. Every other word was the f word and any and all other variation of the f word along with some other belligerent and ignorant things he could say. Apparently he was pissed off that the last time my ex was there that he only gambled 50 cents per hand or something......he accused him of scamming and on and on and on...so the two start arguing because my boyfriend then speaks up to defend himself and it keeps escalating and escalating.....I then finally try and intervene and I'm say \"Why are you speaking to him like that? And asked him who he thought he was talking to like that.  He then says it again but now putting me in it...yous aren't allowed in here anymore.  I was like, \"Dude I don't even f'ing know you, dude\".  I then go on to say that we always come there and sit in the back and order pizza...he then goes, \"Yeah, yous come in here and order your cheap f'ing pizza.\"...and blah blah blah....this of course makes zero sense to me 'cause why offer a special if you are going to accuse your patrons of being cheap when they order it....then I asked if he was the manager...he then lied and said yes....my ex after giving him the finger several times in his face and saying \"F*** off\" asked, \"Are you the owner?\" Again he lied and said yes. I know one of the the owner's names is Mario. So, without warning this guy then starts shutting the door with me standing in the doorway. I mean he is literally hitting me with this door to close it. I could have been injured and for what? I am seriously considering pressing battery charges against this guy because of it.You don't go and behave this way and then you try and assault me with a door? Here's the thing: you have the right to tell us we are banned from your property and for what reasons, but you certainly don't come off talking to people in such a belligerent way unprovoked. We just came there for pizza after working, and if there was a problem then you address it in a calm matter, not like that. And to go as far as trying to close me in a door. It wasn't as if we were trying to force our way in. I was just standing there during the argument this guy started from the moment he opened the door and went off. All of this should be on camera if the establishment tapes what goes on. I can't imagine having an employee that talks to and treats patrons this way. Now I can understand if we came in there messing with other patrons and acting like complete fools, but we didn't. To be that mad cause someone didn't play $1.25 per hand the last time they were in there?  Wow...and oh, one last thing. He tried to involve the other bartender by yelling \"Such and such, doesn't he always bring his cheap ass in here and do this?\"  Well, the bartender who knows us and is always friendly wouldn't even answer. He just looked over and you could tell he wanted no parts of this behavior. Anyway, of course, I will never set foot in that place ever again and I'll be sure to let all of my friends and family about this. Why spend your money at a place where employees are allowed to behave in such a way?  As far as battery charges.I don't know. I'm still seriously considering it.  I don't take too kindly to being assaulted by doors."

They also have great specials, like half price 'boli during football games, 5 of us went in to watch a Cowboys game, each drank 8 beers(at $2.25), so 40 beers total, then we ordered 3 'boli's and 2 orders of wings and the bill was like $130 for all that(gratuity included). The service was great and this place is a great place to watch sports in a laid back atmosphe!"

They are known for their strombolies.  I have to say this was one of the best stromboli's I have had.  It wasn't so much the ingredients, but the taste of the dough. The dough was really tasty and soft.  Love it and would definatley recommend it to anyone that wants good food for a CHEAP price!\n\nFriends had the wings and said they were very good as well!"

Saw the Stromboli on tv and thought I'd give it a try.  I'm Italian and have eaten a few in my day.  Was in Vegas for a conference.  BEST STROMBOLI OF MY LIFE! I got the meatball and hubby got beef& cheddar.  Prefer the meatball but the crust!! OMG!  flaky, buttery even.

The bar area is very smokey and unpleasant.  Luckily you are just in there for a second before you head into the restaurant.  The restaurant is dark and nicely ac'd.  Actually it's kind of cold in there.  There was a nice older lady working there and she was very pleasant.  She didn't got our order right and she was the only one working.  I ordered the stromboli.   It was loaded with cheese and the dough was crunchy but had a texture of good bread.  I would like it slightly less cheasy but that's personal prefference.  The sauce had good flavor and it's huge.  I ordered the large and I'll definitely get two meals and I'm a big eater.   I would stick with stromboli.  My friend ordered the club sandwich and it was not what I expected.  The bread was good but the ham was not the best.  I would give it a four if you stick with the stromboli and value for dollar.  I'll try some other stuff and re-review."

This establishment is definitely a DIVE and the food I tried was on par for that category.  My girlfriend and I ate at the bar (there is seating seperate from the bar with booths).  We asked the bartender what patrons ordered the most and what she recommended.  Which led is to try the turkey and swiss stromboli with a side of marinara sauce, macaroni and cheese potato wedges (came with a side of ranch) and the BBQ chicken tenders (came with 2 celery sticks and a side of ranch).  \nBest item to worst: ranch dressing, macaroni and cheese wedges, chicken tenders, and turkey swiss stromboli. \nStromboli: The stromboli bread was tasty, the swiss cheese good, but the turkey meat was horrible.  The turkey tasted like the cheap Budig sandwich meat.  The pizza bread dough and marinara was so good which leads me to believe that the Sicilian pizza would be a better choice or the original stromboli (I do not eat pork so that was a no go to try.)\nMacaroni and cheese potato wedges: palatable bar food\nChicken fingers: typical frozen flat style bar chicken tender.\nRanch and celery: the ranch was \"on point\" above average (better than Buffalo Wild Wings' ranch) and at least the celery was fresh.\nAtmosphere: We sat at the bar which was enclosed with glass partitions (smokey fish bowl) separate from the \"family friendly\" dining area and banquet room.  There is non gaming bar seating available and a separate area to the side of the bar for gaming customers.  The staff was  attentive and pleasant in typical dive bar fashion (By pleasant I mean authentic but not an over the top artificial attempt to be nice)\nHonestly, I would not recommend this bar to friends or family unless they happen to be on that side of town and want to watch a football game (Dallas Cowboy Fan Bar according to a decal on the bar mirror) or want a moderately priced drink for around $6 (grey goose and cranberry) The local dive bar that I frequent is Rum Runner.  In comparison it was on par.  Dive bars are described as an informal, unglamorous, bar for local residents to drink and decompress with the convenience of mediocre food.   This fits the bill.\n\n\n***Disclaimer: I went here on my low carb cheat day for a snack and had high dive bar food expectations since Guy Fieri reviewed this place."

Some people would call this a dive bar (it's a little dated, but isn't that part of the charm?), others would call this a locals place (like Cheers), and others might call this a sports bar/video poker bar (front smoky part). It might be all of these things, but what matters most here is the food. \n\nMy husband said he ate here 10 years ago and that it was really good. I looked this up here, and saw that Guy Fieri had this place featured on his show DDD- LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, that show! After checking out the menu and seeing the reviews (STROMBOLI was mentioned many, many times), but having questions, I had almost made up my mind (hee hee).\n\nAfter passing up the smoking section (the bar part) and entering the Dining Room (there are 2 parts, the bathroom is in between both parts, in the hallway, next to the big red sign reading \"DINING ROOM\"), we chose a table, except the table was reserved at 6:30, so we moved against the wall, with the trophies- there were a ton of them. Looked like there were several other groups here, and a party was taking place. There was a cake and other supplies set up underneath the TV, which had sports on. \n\nWe all ordered different items. My husband ordered the medium square pepperoni pizza, I ordered the chicken philly with mushrooms, onions, and peppers, came with steak fries, my husband's uncle ordered the steak sandwich came with steak fries, one friend ordered the chicken wings, but she didn't want fries, one friend ordered the original stromboli (this is what I wanted to order, but this one had assorted meats and I'm sure the sodium content is extremely high. WIsh they had a ham and cheese one alone). The bill was a little over $55, so the prices were reasonable. (We mostly had soft drinks and one friend had a couple beers.) \n\nI've been craving (I'm pregnant) a really good sandwich lately, and this chicken philly was extremely satisfying. The chicken pieces (good quality) were seasoned, the cheese was melted- ooey and gooey (yum), the fixings made it a good sized sub sandwich. I only ate half because it was very filling- it was stuffed! Everyone said that my philly looked good, and I admit it was one of the best philly's I've ever had. The steak fries were ok, weren't crispy (I love crispy skin-on fries), but weren't greasy, either. I'm not too crazy about thick steak fries, probably my least favorite. What I ate, I peppered and ate with ketchup, but I had alot left over (seems like lots of restaurants give a ton of fries these days). \n\nMy husband's pizza was pretty big for an individual sized pizza, and the crust was kinda on the thick side (I prefer thin), but it looked good. I don't like pepperoni and being pregnant, I'm not supposed to have too many things with nitrates, anyway. I had a small bite of the corner of the slice, which had cheese- it was good. Because it's thick, I probably would've only eaten two slices of it. He only orders the pizza when he comes here (took some slices home). My husband's uncle's steak sandwich looked good, too, and he wasn't talking much, so I think he enjoyed it. The friend who ordered the wings, said that she only orders this whenever she comes here, and she's been coming here since she was a little girl, with her family (she also said that it looks the same just like it always did). The friend who ordered the stromboli (the 4 pc. order), said that it was good, but could've been more seasoned with herbs, and that the marinara sauce could've been warmed, it was cold. She finished it, though. She also said she'd order the chicken philly next time.\n\nThe service was pretty good- our server was nice and attentive. The server checked on us several times and offered us refills and brought us boxes, too. \n\nWould I come here again? Heck ya! It's all about the food. Sometimes, ambiance doesn't matter, because the whole point of going out, is dining (the food, baby). I've always found that casual places are more laidback. Inexpensive really good bar food- you can't lose here. If you're a local, try it, you'll like it. If you're a tourist, come here, because it was on DDD (we found some really good places from watching the show) and then realize you'll come again the next time you are in Vegas."

We showed up not really knowing what to expect and were greeted with a small bar where everybody knew eachother.  there were 3 stools open and we sat down.  Rich the bartender immediately greeted us and asked what we wanted.  we had 3 ice cold(and i mean ice cold!) coors lights within seconds.  we told him we had a reservation at 7 and he asked if i was Bryan.  i said yes and he said he'd just serve us at the bar.  2 hoops games on tv, ice cold coors lights and the recommendations of Rich for food was what was on tap for the next couple hours.  along with our 30 ice cold coors lights we crushed lumpias(a fillipino combo of an eggroll and taquito), wings and of course 2 original and 1 beef n cheddar stromboli and an epic pizza with everything on it.  the food was awesome.  the Stromboli was incredible.  good enough for us to ask if they could make a couple to go.  i took it home the 5 hour drive the next day to LA and rebaked it for my wife and kid and it was just like being back at the 4K.  \n\nWhat an experience!  I will be back everytime i go to vegas.  Rich, Marilynn, Mario....THANKS FOR THE GREAT TIME!  \n\nBryan, John and Rob"

A middle aged woman who is obviously high or drunk (or both) should not be handling drinks and serving food.   She spent more time smoking and texting than she did serving.  Great tip, get your grub to go and avoid the circus behind the bar.  Food is a 5.  Atmosphere is a 1.  Bartender is less than zero."

Service was friendly and prompt.  We placed our drink order and got those right away, then placed our dinner order;  we had the original Stromboli and the fully loaded pizza.  As we were ordering, our server also told us that we got 1/2 off the pizza because the Nascar race had just come on...excellent!  Food came out in a timely manner...relative to what we ordered.  The Stromboli was excellent, and the pizza was very good also.  Their crust is very good...I'll assume it's the same for both items.  Stromboli was filled with just the right amount of ingredients...not too few, not so many that it's overwhelming.  We have been to a few Triple D places but kept missing this one in Vegas, but we're very happy we finally got there!."

Big MISTAKE!\n\nHere's what we had:\n\n$1.75 dinner salad - all wet half head iceberg ($.50 extra for ranch)\n$12.99 steak and shrimp - massacred new york steak, ordered medium, came out rare and was still dry. Sent it back and they microwaved it to well done. Beer battered shrimp. Everything tasteless.\n$15.99 large pizza - pretty good, nice sauce, good amount of toppings, overall acceptable.\n$7.99 chicken wings - basic order wings, hot sauce, ranch. Okay.\n$16.99 bbq ribs - sold as hickory smoked but there was nothing smoked about them (unless the cigarette smoking line cook counts?) They're baked and slathered with salty sauce. Side of cajun fries, not what you think, fries coated in hot sauce, huh? Weird thought, tastes yuck. \n$3.99 kids grilled cheese and fries - better than the steak. \n\nNow, you walk into this place in a desolate area of north vegas, about fifteen minutes on freeway from strip, and the smell of old grease is over powering. The place reminded me of county jail with glass walls separating the \"dining room\" from the bar. You would think with all the good publicity from Guy that they would have made some improvements, but, no. \n\nI wouldn't eat here again\n\nThink nostalgia went more into the triple d pick than the food."

We tried the fried mac and cheese, mini corndogs, and of course the original stromboli. Fried mac and cheese... very very good. I've had this dish in chicago many times, but this is the best one I've had. It's fried in egg batter rather than just breaded, and the pieces are small and manageable. Mini corndogs.. well they were just mini corndogs. Stromboli was so good! I'd also like to add that they make these from Scatch so you can add/take out things to your hearts desire. \n\nLastly... the price... amazingly cold draft Coors light set us back $2 each (on a Saturday nigh no less), and 4 beers + our food came up to only $28 with tax.. not bad at all. \n\nIt is just bar food, but it's bar food done right!

Both of these were the highlights to my evening. The mac and cheese bites could be bigger, so they are less greasy overall, but I enjoyed how piping hot and melty the cheese was. The cajun fries are just fries tossed in buffalo sauce. I love buffalo sauce, so this is a win for me, but it should probably be more aptly named. \n\nOn to the entrees: we then ordered a meatball stromboli, and original stromboli, a pepperoni pizza, and an order of chicken fingers with fries. The chicken fingers were typical frozen chicken. I would not order these. The strombolis and pizza were okay. I did not like the sauce. It was like a canned tomato with some sweetness. It needed herbs and spices and less sugar. The doughs are good, but the sauce needs some serious work.\n\nOverall, I won't be back."

Four Kegs gives you the impression someone stopped caring about the business 35 years ago. Robert Irvine would flip out.\n\nPrimo, I'm not a fan of carpets where you serve food. They make a joint have a murky smell, especially if you have a typical deep-fried menu. \nSecundo, the place is cramped and feels smaller because it's very strangely divided. And tertio, I didn't know where to look! The kitsch carpet pattern, the overly decorated walls, the 60s PepsiCo lit menu boards or the giant screen tv's?\n\nI ordered a Tom Collins and my hubby a Killian's on draft. It wasn't bad, but very basic. The Killian's came in a chilled glass, but it was a strange half-wine, half beer-mug type, which made no sense.\n\nWhile on my way to the bathroom, I did notice a Guy Fieri autograph.

            "review": "So my sister recommended trying their stromboli since her classmates have said nothing but good things about it, plus Guy Fieri made the trip out there for his Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives show. Turns out Mr. Fieri knew what was up with that place. \n\nLet me start off by saying that if you're trying to eat here and you think its close to the strip, you couldn't be more wrong haha. It's allllllll the way toward north Las Vegas out in the cuts. It's right off the freeway though, if that helps. If you can get past the appearance of the place, then you're good to go.\n\nWhen you walk in, its basically a small casino and bar with a few TVs blaring different sports games. Yep, total dive bar status. The dining area is in the back, and surprisingly the staff here are pretty nice. The dining room was close to empty, even though we showed up at 10 in the evening. My sister and I split a large classic stromboli while my cousin got the half turkey and swiss stromboli. It actually took awhile for our food to come out, but it was worth the damn wait. Something about the bread/crust made the stromboli delicious, beside the fact that the ham, cheese, pepperoni, and sausage made it good enough as is. Yeah, the bread was definitely what made the stromboli. Word of advice: ask for a side of ranch to go with your stromboli and you won't regret it. Well maybe you will because you may feel more gross afterwards, but the combination of those two are amazing. \n\nWorth the drive, worth the wait. Like I said, just try to get over the appearance of the place and it'll be fine."

The bolis are as delicious as promised and the lunch cheese steak special was a fantastic deal (Included a soad/tea and fries for about 7 bucks) . The dough on the bolis is just heaven. You can taste the homemade authenticity and care that goes into the preparation of each boli. Four Kegs is a bit of a dive, with only about ten tables but with food like this you will definitely want to venture away from the buffets and pricey fare of the Strip.\n\nEqually as amazing as the food was the cheery and friendly service we received from Kelly. She was sweet, knowledgeable,  helpful and fun! She made the experience even better by cracking jokes and just being relatable and friendly.  We left feeling like friends and definitely will be back next time we're visiting Vegas. I couldn't recommend this joint any more highly if you're looking for great food, reasonable prices, amazing service and a Cheers-like feeling in the heart of Sin City.  Kelly rocks!! Go visit her and enjoy some amazing food while you're at it! \n\nSide note: a lot of people have been confused by the directions/location. We saw a sign for Four Kegs near a vacant McDonald's building and were a bit confused at first but with just a quick spin around the parking lot we found it with no problems."

First and foremost, patrons are required to walk through the bar which has cigarette smells that have been here for 40 years.  it is disgusting.  I've been there twice and there were several old worn out bar patrons that probably occupy a stool every day.  That is the biggest turnoff for me  Once behind the door to the small restaurant, it's quirky to say the lest.  The service was very good and friendly.  The food was good and arrived quickly. i had a patty melt and it was delicious and juicy and served on marble rye.   I am a loss to figure out whey when there are so may choices in LV for restaurant and folks would choose to go to Four Kegs.  This confirms that there is a lid for every pot an it takes all kinds of places to make the world happy.    I'd never chose to go here, but if a group wanted to go I would hold my nose to get into the restaurant and have some good food.  This is certainly not a place fork people who want to eat healthy."

            "review": "\"The original sports bar and restaurant\"? If by \"original\" you mean old, this sports bar fits the bill. Located in a nondescript part of town off the strip, we weren't sure until we actually walked through the door whether this spot was actually still in business. Once we entered, we were confronted with a rather uncomely and smoky bar area; taking our chances, we proceeded to walk through a narrow passageway that opened into a back seating area with tables and booths. Very quiet. Strange layout, I must say.\n\nBeer is cheap (e.g. Shiner Bock for $2.50). We happened to come in during a game, so pizzas were half off. However, we wanted to try the famous STROMBOLI, so we ordered a small original one to share ($8.49). It was pretty good! I was expecting something dry and tasteless, but the dough was soft, crisp, and perfectly baked. CHICKEN WINGS ($3.55) were cheap and decent.\n\nOverall, having had low expectations for this dive bar, we were quite satisfied. There was an elderly couple across the room who ordered a large pizza (remember, it was 50% off). I think they only ate one piece between the two of them and packed up the rest to go. Smart idea if you don't want to cook dinner! The booth behind us consisted of a middle aged woman and her elderly mother: they enthusiastically ordered a TABLE FULL of dishes as if they were a gang of college jocks. I just saw the waitress bring them dish after dish. I think it was the mother's birthday or something. Or maybe just the daughter's annual visit. In any case, as we left, satisfied with our snack, we were somehow cheered and warmed by the memory of two grown women pigging out on some good ol' comfort food."

As a vegetarian, this is probably not the best place to eat.\n\nThe atmosphere here is definitely diner-y and very dive-y, but not a problem. Although, smoking is permitted in one section of the bar, giving it that extra touch of dive. A plus is that the bathrooms were super clean. The women's anyway, the men's apparently had a floater.\n\nThe vegetarian options were slim, though I was grateful for them actually having vegetarian options. I got the veggie stromboli and shared the fried mac and cheese wedges with a friend. The rest of the bunch had pizza, various other strombolis and hot wings. I think the biggest hit was the mac and cheese wedges. Although not what I had expected (the wedges were filled with good ole blue box mac n cheese :/) they were still appetizing. My veggie stromboli on the other hand was not good. It was full of raw ass onions, FULL. There was no sauce, and when I asked for marinara poor Marge (what we felt the waitress should be named) was too busy to grab it.

It had a thin dough which is something few places do.  I like it the way it was made because you're not eating so much bread.  The filling was ham, cheese, pepperoni, and tomato sauce.

It looks like it hasn't changed in decades, but not in a bad way, more like this place is a no frills institution. The one thing that did change is the barrier of the front bar is smoking and the dining is completely glassed in so no need to avoid it if you're smoke sensitive! \n\nWe were a bit confused how this place kinda works for to-go so we get a ticket at the window and pay at the bar, but once we figured that out we got out there fast. \n\nMeatball Stromboli - definitely good, the meatball was tender and definitely homemade. The actual dough had some crunch on the outside, but was chewy inside. I enjoyed it enough. \n\nTurkey, Ham and Swiss Stromboli - this was just okay. The BF didn't like the type of turkey slices they used in this. I felt it needed something, I say go for strombolis with red sauce in it. \n\nWe didn't know how filling these will be so we got a large meatball and a small turkey and that was way more than enough. We had left overs. \n\nWe also got some chicken tenders and fries. These are typical bar tenders and taste like many bars so definitely premade, but alright anyways. Their medium sauce is more vinegary than spicy. \n\nI'll probably be back for a meat and red sauce based stromboli and probably won't mess with anything else."

My personal favorite is the turkey and swiss stromboli.  Another option includes a beef and cheddar boli.  No veggie option as of yet - sorry vegetarians of the world.  \n\nThere's also no doubt that the service can some times be lacking, especially around 2 am.

Definitely not a place for \"dive bar\" seeking hipsters - stay in Silverlake if that's the case!"

We split a stromboli and an order of wings.  First of all the stromboli was excellent. The dough is crispy on the outside but tender and pillow soft on the inside.  We order the original which came with a variety of Italian meats.  The meats and sauce are fine, but the dough is what makes this stromboli the best I've ever had.  Once it cooled down from molten hot we devoured it in about 5 minutes.\n\nThe wings were also fried to a crispy golden brown and tossed with their wing sauce.  The sauce was a basic buffalo sauce you can find at just about any place serving wings.  The sauce was good, but we ordered medium since the wife does not like her wings too spicy.  Next time I'm there, I'll have to try out their hotter sauces. Overall the wings are good and I'd recommend them to anyone that is at Four Kegs and in the mood for wings.  However, the stromboli is something I would go out of my way to get."

I've gotten the \"Original Boli\" many times (marinara sauce, pepperoni, sausage, mozarella) and it really needs to be tried once for anyone visiting Vegas. Ask for extra marinara sauce and dip your way to 'Boli heaven. \n\nIt's about 15 mins off the strip, and incredibly unassuming (very, very divey looking inside & out) but trust me; it's worth it."

I have had a few myself being an East Coaster....  \n\nThis place is definitely a dive, the decor looks like it hasn't changed much since it opened in 77.  But it is a dive, by definition.  It is an odd layout too, bar up front and a few doors leading to what looks like the back dining room.  Note that there is smoking in the bar, this being Vegas and all plus various video type slot games...\n\nWanted to watch Rutgers dominate Iowa St. in the bowl game Friday so sat at the bar.  Owner Mario was behind the bar and was speaking to everyone (except me, newbie here) by their first name.  Definitely the dive bar now, almost Cheers like. :)\n\nReviewed Stromboli options with Mario.  Went with the original, small.  More than enough for me since I didn't have a fridge in my hotel room for a Large, double sized, for only $4 more.  Must say that it is nicely crispy on the outside.  Was maybe just a little too much dough thickness than what I like but the crispiness was a big plus.  Downside was that it doesn't normally come with extra dipping sauce, extra charge is what I recall on the menu, should have asked for that anyway even though there was sauce inside already.\n\nIt was a good 'boli for sure overall.  Not my personal best 'boli but very good.  And I also liked owner Mario, mostly because how he was genuine and how I saw him treating everyone, including me.  On the way out he asked to check in with him gain next time I am in town.  Looking forward to trying another option and increase my rating..."

I was really disappointed with the lack of big TV's here and the way they were laid out.\n\nUpon entering there was a small bar area with limited seating. There was also an area which seemed like restaurant seating and then another room that you could call the banquet room. Anyway, the bar area was packed. So the hostess took us to the banquet room area which had about 4 TV's (I think). We couldn't see all the games so the hostess said she could take us to a different area. It had the same issues, you couldn't view all the TV's and they were small TV's\n\nAfter reading the reviews on Yelp, I decided to try the fried pickles and original stromboli. The pickles and stromboli were good but nothing that would give you that \"wow\" factor. My friends ordered the wings that were on special. Those too were good but nothing spectacular.\n\nI must say that we did see the pizzas here and they looked really good!\n\nHaving the words \"Sport Bar\" in your restaurant name, one would  think they would have tons of big flat screens.

The original stromboli that everyone raves about- didn't impress us that much.  If you live in a major city, you can find a stromboli in your home town just like it and in many cases - better.  We did like the dough, which is a huge part of any stromboli.  It's nice and browned, with a buttery flavor to it.  Other than that we were not impressed with the fillings here.  It was mostly an average quality black forrest ham, although there were supposed to be pepperoni and salami in there as well.  No other flavor really stood out.  Black Forrest ham isn't an italian meat, not sure why they are using it here when you have so many great Italian cold cuts to chose from.  The stromboli also could have had more cheese and marinara sauce.  Only 3 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#aHBeyIiUwWA0g3ATNPnR5g\n\nIf you are going to come here make sure you get the Meatball Boli.  Four Kegs meatballs are very tasty.  Surrounded by the excellent golden buttery crust, this one was a winner.  We ordered a side of marinara sauce to dip in and I suggest you do as well.  It's not an amazing sauce, but I found a little dip went a long way.  It could have used a few more meatballs in this boil as well, especially since we were sharing.  4.5 stars for the Meatball Stromboli.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#xhW180LRrXist_kfJBrl-Q\n\nMy wife rocked the boat and got the Chicken Philly.  I wanted to try the Philly cheese steak since a few people have raved about it on yelp.  But she loves a good a chicken philly, unfortunately this one was just kind of average with green peppers and onions.  Nothing too remarkable about it and it made her wonder why we drove here.  Also the potato salad was very sweet and blah. 3 stars.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#m47QUO5PiUWFKIVpjdKciA\n\nMy daughter had some kind of fried mac 'n cheese nuggets.  Yuck!  If I never ate one of those again it would be ok with me.   It was clearly Kraft Mac -n Cheese balled up, breaded and deep fried.  Her fries were very uninspired as well.  Based on what we tried, I found Four Kegs to be a one trick pony with the Meatball Boli.  Perhaps pizza is good here, since they have a good dough and seem to know what to do with it.  I'd say Four Kegs is best for locals only."

Loaded with thin sliced beef griddle with just the right amount char to add great flavor, and peppers, onions, mushrooms, and provolone. The bread really made this sandwich a homerun. The fries were good, but a little underdone. A nice thick steak cut but could have been a little crispier.  The beans tasted like baked out of can style.

I prefer it with less toppings to enjoy the actual pizza. The strombolis are made with fresh ingredients but to me seem pretty average. I ordered the Cajun fries, buffalo spicy with a smell of vinegar. Yum. All of their salad dressings are home made and the blue cheese is thick and has red wine vinegar in it. I'm still undecided about it. \nThe burgers are good, salad was average. Chili seemed like it was straight from a can with fresh cheese and onions on top. Hot link was a good quality meat. \nNot everything here is fresh, for sure some frozen appetizers and a few corners cut, but OVERALL you'll get decent food if you know what to order. \nOh and it was fun pissing off the cowboys fans during the game too :) gotta love a place that you can watch the game at!"

I dug the inside and the vibe.\n\nI was directed to order from the kitchen counter; a 10 minute wait. Not bad. I've waited longer at some places. Paid at the bar and the bartender asked if I wanted a drink (declined.)\n\nGot home and finally got to taste it. The smell was spot on what I'm accustomed to. The taste is very similar, but it's not exact. I think it's the cheese. I ordered extra cheese so I won't next time. I also think they might use American cheese? (Shame on you, if that's the case.) The cheese takes away from the flavor but overall, I would definitely have it again. And I recommend getting it WITH onions.

Everybody ordered stromboli's, as they are the specialty and the recommended choice of Guy Fieri.  My order was a veggie stromboli, hold the onions.  When the food arrived, everyone was pleased and the order was right except for one thing: our waitress noticed that they cooks had added onions to mine.  She immediately noticed this and went back and replaced my order.  i told her she could take the one back with onions, but she said they would just toss it and I could take it.  Great, my friends said they would eat it later.  So my order came right the next time, it was pretty good (not amazing, though) and we were four happy dudes.

(i'm still convinced its a bad dream) A: yep, had it for over 10 years now..\nOMG  I found a bar in Vegas that serves Shiner on drapht. .simply unbelievable! .\nThose who are not from Texas and have no clue what shiner bock is need to head over to the 4 kegs and try it, words alone can not explain my enthusiasm.\nAnyway, Yes, the place is old, located in not the best neighborhood but all that is to be overlooked, the food is not bad at all, very traditional, prices are good to fair, and most important, shiner on tap, I thing I just found my new favorite dive."

            "review": "No no no! Terrible food & bad service. We stopped here because it had been featured on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives and we were thoroughly disappointed. A table that got seated after us got their appetizers before us. We had to ask again for our appetizers after we got our food. I ordered The Kegs Club w/ fries. The fries were cold, as was the bacon on my sandwich, which makes me assume the bacon sits pre-cooked in kitchen. They used american cheese, no option for cheddar, swiss, etc. Didn't even bother to stick the sandwich in the microwave to melt the cheese. My boyfriend ordered a stromboli, it was comparable to a calzone you would buy in a high school cafeteria. We took one bite each, & asked for boxes. We decided to get a quality meal elsewhere, and & at the very least save that food for a 2nd rate lunch for work tomorrow. The waitress brought us boxes & a plastic bag. She had trouble opening the bag up, gave up, & tossed it in my general direction while walking away.  The place was not particularly busy when we went in, I can't think of any reason other than low standards for why the food was so bad and we received barely any attention from waitress. Dont let the tv show or the other good reviews draw you in, thats how we were fooled, and led us to waste money & some of our last few hours in las vegas."

I like that there is a door that separates the smoky bar from the dining room. I have tried a lot of food here, what I like the most is definitely the pizza. The pizza's are sicilian style, with a thick, buttery crust that's cut into 8 squares. One of the pizza's they offer has 7 toppings of your choice, so we usually double up on all the ones we like, and ask for the pizza well done. It comes out excellent every time. Don't forget to ask for a few sides of their delicious homemade ranch for dipping. I also like the cajun fries, which are just fries tossed in hot sauce, but they are pretty tasty. Pro tip: All pizza's are 1/2 price after midnight. If you haven't been here yet, do yourself a favor and check it out."

My dad used to play for a softball team sponsored by Four Kegs so they had fond memories. \n\nWe asked for a pitcher of beer but you can only get one of their special glasses. Fried Mac n cheese was yummy, the Stromboli was huge and packed with meat. I liked their pizza the best. Supreme with tons of toppings and very doughy Sicilian style. That is how my momma made pizza growing up. \n\nI appreciate that they section off the non-smoking area. The waitress made us feel right at home and completely rolled with the \"dad jokes\" my father likes to spout off. The place also is much smaller on the inside than it looks from the outside, probably due to the layout. Lots of charm, great food, and even better service."

They also can use a better bbq sauce for it.\nI also had a med pizza with 7 topping add pineapple and that was 4/10 didn't care for it much felt like it was a little soggy as well.\nLast but not least the famous strombolli which was a 7/10 it's was actually pretty good I wish I got just a few of these and not the rest.\nSo pretty much I recommend if you go to get that for sure.\nNow back to the dirty dining situation this place could use some love. It is pretty dirty and old for sure. The bathrooms were dirty as well with the booth that we were sitting in because the seats were not wiped throughly. Now for the kitchen I couldn't see much but just seeing the back steel panels on the wall you can see layers of build up of dirt. The best part is that it had finger print streaks so it made it more noticeable.\nNow for the environment it's not my kind of environment especially if I was to come for the tvs because they had these little 20 inch Vizio tvs in the corners that I didn't even realize was there and there was only a few of them. But hey the prices were pretty awesome and the drinks were only $6 each overall I don't think I would come back just because it could use a cleaning and touching up on some food and environment."

Judging from the outside it doesn't seem very family friendly since we had some kids with us...the group walked in apprehensively but were warmly welcomed by the staff. The staff directed us to the dinning area,  it's not the prettiest of places but once you eat their stromboli you forget all about the look. As a group we decided to try the stromboli, hot wings, pizza, antipasto and several children menu selections.  The hot wings are beyond hot..if you like crying you should try them. The antipasto dressing was delish..next time we will order two antipasto's. All in all...we enjoyed the food, no left overs which is a good sign.

            "review": "How could you not love a place known for strombolis? This place is a hidden gem outside of the strip that I've been wanting to go since they were on DDD.\n\nThey have a few different kinds of stromboli (and even a breakfast one!!!!). Between me and a few other people we tried a 3 of them and I have to say the meatball one is by far my favorite. We tried the beef and cheese one (or something like that) and the original one (or something like that) and the meatball was really just perfect. The small size is good for a normal person, but if you're like me, the large will do. Actually splitting a large stromboli between 2 people is the best deal. If I remember correctly, the small was around $8.95 and the large was $11.95. \n\nService was pretty decent here and the food was prompt. We got a couple appetizers including cajun fries, which were basically fries in buffalo sauce...I don't really recommend this. Just get the regular fries. We also got the fried mac and cheese or whatever it was. That was awesome. I would get those if I went again.\n\nAlso if you get a beer, it comes in this ice cold mug that makes it one of the most refreshing beers. Or if you're like my sexually confused friend and want a bloody mary, they have those too. It was actually my first time trying a bloody mary and it was pretty good...note to self: don't get \"buffalo-ed\" when you're having one...it's not a fun drink to chug. If you don't know what \"buffalo game\" is, look it up.\n\nIn conclusion:\nGet a large stromboli for 2 people.\nGet the fried mac and cheese or whatever it was\nGet a beer.\nGet the meatball stromboli"

Smells like an old cigarette butt actually. I don't smoke so that was a big negative to me! So we take a couple seats at the bar. Bartender was a dick. Didn't ask us if we wanted anything to drink. Just slapped some menus in front of us and said Holler when we are ready to order. Um, we didn't say we were gonna eat here and we really wanted a drink. Bartenders there must read minds! So we order our food. Bf had the wings and fries and I had the turkey club. Food was a 7 out of 10 for both of us. I really dislike that they serve food on paper plates. It's just tacky to me. I had to take off the lettuce and tomato because it was very very soggy! Other than that my food was fine. Bf liked his wings. But he said they were really salty. So maybe they can scale back on the salt next time and bf will be happy! \n\nNow the staff... Like I said, bartender was a prick. We had to flag his rude ass down because he did 3 that is THREE trips around the bar and never 1 time asked us if we wanted a drink or even water for gosh sakes! Nope! When we did get drinks there was no syrup in my Sprite. It was all carbonated water. YUK! I took a big drink too :( but after 15 mins I finally got another Sprite! So then my bf puts in a $20 bill into the machine in front of him. The bartender looked at us and said, \"if ur gonna gamble, don't expect me to be at your beck and call when u want to cash out after you win $10 bucks! What is this dudes problem? So my bf had already put the cash in when I reached over and pressed cash out. Screw this jerk. I'm not giving this place my money with him working there. 8 long minutes go by and the bartender is staying on the other side of the bar on purpose. So I waited to the 10 min mark and I got up and told him I want my money, we need to go, and please! He said he will be there in a min. Another 6 mins go by and I got up again. I told him I needed my money so I can leave and get home to my child. So he said \"oh ur one of those huh?\" I'm one of what I asked. \"Oh never mind lady, I'll get ur money!\" Well, not wanting to get the bartenders ass beat and my bf thrown in jail, I didn't tell my bf what the asshole said until we got home. We tried to ask his name a couple times before we left and he kept saying his name was jack then whispers his last name is meoff. So he was saying his name was jack me off. Class act buddy. I know damn well he didn't think of that all alone in his pea size brain! \n\nSo the 2nd time I came in I asked to be seated in the dining room far away from that bastard bartender. I ordered my food to go. That was a much better experience because I didn't stay there very long. So word to the wise!!!... Go in, or call in would be way better! Order your food and don't stay there 1 min longer than u have to. Oh, don't u dare gamble either  because they clearly don't want people to. They'll treat you like shit if you do! \n\n1 last thing that is actually positive and I'm so grateful for! The 2nd time we went in, there was this man who was waaaayyyyy too drunk. Bartender should of cut him off 10 drinks ago but didnt. Not surprised! The man was sitting in the bar area when I got there and came to dining room after about 10 mins. He told the waitress that he went to the bathroom and lost his seat and there's no place to sit in the bar anymore so he had to come to the dining area. So he ordered another beer and 2 shots. Waitress came back with 1 beer and a big glass of ice water and a glass of Coca Cola. Told him to finish his LAST beer, drink some water or soda and she is calling a cab right now. He was angry when she said last beer and was even more mad that she wouldn't give him shots of hard alcohol. She told him point blank, \"be as mad as u want pal but you are not killing someone I love because u are not adult enough to know when to quit!\" There were only 7 people in the dining area and we all started clapping and thanking her. She probably saved a lot of lives when she did that. She got a $20 tip from me on a $9 tab. And I know the other patrons did the same. I wish I could remember her name. I'll stop in one day after work and see if I can get it and I'll update my review with her name. Oh, the man finished his beer and 3 glasses of water. Handed over his keys to the waitress and said he would be by tomorrow morning to get his car. Thank god! \n\nI've been living in Las Vegas for 15 years. I've seen the inside of bars/diners probably 1000 times no exaggeration. I've also seen probably 2-4 thousand idiots go stumbling to their cars to drive. And never once have I seen a bartender, waiters or security try to stop them. Never cut them off and don't give a flat f&@k! But she did and for that I am internally grateful! Karma will be good to her! \n\nFor whoever has gotten this far on this review, I hope  you found this useful."

Its a total dive, in the back of a strip-mall casino/bar. Its open 24 hours, seats are uncomfortable, the menus are older than dirt, but the food is really cheap and really good. \n\nWe split an original stromboli, a small or medium pepperoni pizza and some buffalo chicken strips. Everything was good, but the stromboli is  excellent, best I ever tasted."

There is no hoopla or marching bands. Just a large strip mall in the middle of the desert with a lot of other businesses trying to get by. Park in front and see that there are no windows and like three doors to choose from. Pick the middle one and enter right into the bar and wondering if I am in the right place... Anyway, make my way around back and get seated. This is a tiny place and a bit of a maze but all the more charming i guess...\n\nService here was incredible and the food even better. Had great help in choosing wasn't disappointed in the Original and the Beef and Cheddar. Wish I could have sampled everything but this alone was worth the trek in the hot Las Vegas sun...\n\nThere is nothing else to add except that their stromboli is perfection or to quote Guy... \"money.\""

We were looking for something different.\n\nWe google searched Drive-ins Diners and Dives to see if there were any restaurant visits in Vegas, and we found Four Kegs.  It was about 10 miles from where we were on the strip, and the drive was worth it.\n\nOur waitress was very nice and sweet.  She recommended the Stromboli and the Philly Cheese steak.  Coming from Chicago, its very hard to find anyone else's pizza-like food to be great.  While I will say the Stromboli was very very good, I think their Philly was very memorable, and enough for two people to eat.\n\nWe went back a second time w/ family who live locally and we all had a great time and great meal."

I talked some coworkers into going and a group of 8 of us hit it.  When we walked in the restaurant side we were promptly ignored even though the waitresses looked right at us.  We walked around a few minutes looking for an open table large enough and since we were in her way she decided to split us into two smaller tables instead of scooting them together.\n\nThe menu selection was good, but our food took forever to get.  The waitress eventually said one of the two cooks didn't show up, so we relaxed and continued watching the Masters.  Once the strombolis started arriving they all looked good.  Unfortunately, 3 were undercooked (raw dough) and 3 were barely warmed through, but at least the dough was cooked.  I think the other 2 guys were too hungry to notice anything wrong.  When we started complaining, there was not much of an apology from either waitress.  One didn't say anything when she took one back to the kitchen and the other just said something to the affect of \"not sure why, they were cooked long enough...\"  Obviously not!\n\nThis place is a bit far from where we usually stay when we visit Vegas each year, so when we are back in town again I doubt we will take the time to try it again due to the uncooked food and waitresses that don't care enough to apologize."

I was surprised that he found this little divey spot amongst all the other bujee places LV has to offer (...and I don't ALWAYS mean that in a negative sense, at times I do).  I believe that he discovered it on the show, \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,\" hosted by none other than Las Vegas' own, Guy Fieri. \n\nWhat was shocking was how close this place is to my office too.  I totally overlooked this place thinking that it was just a local watering hole for neighborhood.  Once you enter the establishment, you will notice the bar area.  To the right, you will see the walkway toward the rear where the dining area is.  \n\nBe aware that if you are the type that can't eat around cigarette smoke, this may not be the place for you.  There is a non smoking area, but the smells tend to linger through the vents.  Still, once you taste the Stromboli here, it may be more than worth the health hazards.\n\nI have to say that although I am an avid fan of the original Stromboli (large of course), there are tons of other dishes that is offered at 4Kegs, I just haven't tried them first hand but seen some friends order it and vouched its legitimacy.  \n\nThe large Stromboli could be shared by two unless you are really hungry.  I tend to put in a phone order and just swing by to take it back to the office.  But one thing to note is get extra marinara sauce (a little up-charge is included tho).\n\nAlthough, the joint is a pretty run down local spot in dire need of a make over, to some, that may just be what many patrons respect, an official 702 mainstay.  Definitely divey but worth it."

Since we were in the LV area, we couldn't resist but to stop here for their original Stromboli. It tasted just as Guy described it...the crust was crisp on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside. Add ham, pepp, mozarella cheese, and marinara sauce and it's like a match made in heaven. SO GOOD!!! \n\nThis place is probably the last D on DDD...it was a total DIVE! About 10 mins from the strip, this \"sports bar\" sits in a partially desolate shopping center in a very questionable area. Luckily, it is right off the freeway for a quick getaway...if needed! :) The layout of this place is a trip...it kind of reminded me of a cul de sac of a street. You enter and you are at the cul de sac which is their bar area...on both ends there are doors leading you into their dining area which I can describe as being on the outskirts of that cul de sac. They are divided by half of a wood paneling wall on the bottom and the other half is plexi glass where you can see from either side...imagine a bank with bulletproof windows????!!! I know very strange. \n\nThe staff is really friendly and the service is A+. Our waitress said, \"Guy must have sent y'all cuz I've never seen you in my life!\" LOL! The menu was pretty extensive...pizzas, pastas, burgers, sandwiches, chili fries, pitchers of BEER, etc. The prices were very cheap for the amount of food that they serve. Overall, I would definitely come back when in the area to try the rest of their food, esp the pizza!!!"

Our waitress also forgot to put in our appetizer order--we reminded her and it came after the meal. \n\nThe one forgotten stromboli finally made it to our table AFTER everyone completed their meals, and it was ICE-COLD in the middle. \n\nThe manager never compensated us or apologized for THEIR screw-ups.

While flipping through the channels the good old Food Network pops up and I see my favorite show, Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives, while half watching the show and checking up on e-mail I hear something about Las Vegas and a place where the host spent many a moon at during his youth.  So as I'm watch'n them make up a Stromboli my mouth is totally watering, once the show is over, I picked up the cell phone to give my parent's a jingle.\n\nAfter getting all the details on directions and address and my explanation that this place could be a total \"dive\", I mean it's located in a strip-mall, they trekked over to see what this place was all about.  As they walked in the door they were greeted by a happy-go-lucky gentleman who said right away, \"Oh, you must have seen us on the Food Channel!\"  They nodded in agreement and their new best friend Mario led them to the small-ish dinning room toward the back of the \"casinodivebarrestaurant\" much to their delight the \"back\" of the bar was packed with people, an old wives tale my mom believes that if there are plenty of \"locals\" the food must be good.  As Mario cleared a small table for my parent's he continued to entertain/chat with them, he even cut off the football game on the TV's to turn on a VCR recording of the Food Channel episode where they were featured!  Much to the chagrin of some of the \"regulars\".\n\nMy mom had the buffalo wings, I'll preface to say she often drinks Tabasco instead of coffee sometimes in the AM.   Well, after munch'n on the wings, even she had to admit to my dad they were a bit \"zippy\".  My dad got worked over by some kind of sandwich to which he mentioned it was HUGE and very tasty.  Strangely there were no leftovers....\n\nSo, you might be wondering why I'm Yelp'n a place I've never stepped foot into.... Instead of getting some lame t-shirt from Vegas, I got a STROMBOLI!!!  WOW!!  Nice move parental units!!!  Even reheated in the toaster oven this bad-boy was out freaking standing!!  A very nice crust, plenty of goodies inside and it was re-born, via toaster oven, nicely even after a 2-3 hour flight from Vegas!!\n\nThe place is open 24hrs, whew, needless to say, it's on my \"todo\" list the next time I'm in town!!"

They weren't chintzy with it which i liked. next, the wings were so unique. They we're like chicken patties, which i thought i wasn't going to like.. but actually [to my surprise] i loved them.

There's also this really friendly lady kind of roaming to make sure people are being helped and doing okay. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes the cook walked to our table to let us know the food was ready.\n\nThe Stromboli were 12.99, I believe, each. The wings were 8 for $10.00 I believe. \n\nWe paid, took it to go, and then we were nicely thanked as we left.\n\nIt was a standard and nice interaction done with smiles and that definitely went a long way for me. I appreciated the overall friendliness. \n\nWe got back to the house and dug in. I didn't read the whole get marinara thing until after I got home. Fortunately the Stromboli were still amazing without the extra sauce. The dough was what made it for me. Definitely different than a calzone. We got the original which was like typical three meat pizza ingredients and then a beef and cheese one. Both of the choices were spot on. Each is about the size of HALF of a pizza but they are stuffed. They both fit in one pizza box. The wings looked unassuming and standard but were nicely done. They were not breaded and slightly crisp. They were good but nothing to rave about. \n\nI honestly don't have any complaints. The only tiny minor gripe is that the end pieces virtually had no toppings stuffed into it. The dough was so good I didn't mind too much.\n\nI'll definitely be back for some Stromboli."

Had the original stromboli with ranch and marinara on the side, pepperoni pizza, and zucchini chips. Everything was delicious! So much food and it was all around $35. We even had enough for left overs for the both of us. We sat in the dining area and bypassed the bar part of it. When I first walked in I wasnt so sure of the place. It looked like a small smokey bar. Once we went thru the dining area and saw families and others packed sitting enjoying their meals I was like ok they're busy. What brought me here though was the fact that its down the street around the corner for my house and my friend mentioned Guy Fieri recommended it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives so of course being a foodie I had to check it out. I cant wait to tell everyone about it and come back! By the way the hostess was super attentive, kind, etc. I cant say enough about this place!"

I loved it last time I was hear\n\nAtmosphere - Yeah it is bar which serves food.  We sat on the right side when you come in.  They have three TVs with sporting events on, we watched the Mets dominate the Dodgers.  I did not even notice the smoke, like some reviewers commented, but I think the new laws (probably three plus years now) prohibit the smoking in a place that serves food.  I think that is why they have glass walls around the bar, but these walls made for a strange feel to the place.\n\nFood\n  Appetizer - Onion rings, nothing special they were just there. \n\n  Main Course - Went with the original Stromboli again, so did my parents.  We all loved it.  I should have ordered one to go.  I wish I could get this rolled up pizza in Reno!\n\n  Dessert - I was stuffed after eating that Stromboli!\n\nService - Our waitress changed the channel on the one TV no one was watching to Fox Sports so we could see the Mets Dodgers game.  Mary Beth was great, fast and funny.  What more can you ask for from your server. \n\nFuture - Sure, I love the Stromboli."

I had to read a sign to get directions to the restaurant seating area which by the way is in the very back of the bar. The seating was very small. The waitress looked at me and my wife standing there waiting to be sat down. After about 5 minutes she stated \"You know its seat yourself right\" WOW! My wife and I sat down and we ordered. I had the house stromboli and my wife had chicken wings and fries. My wife ordered her wings naked with no sauce. Her order came out great. My stromboli was OK. It was very bland and lacked flavor. I was really dissappointed. The waitress asked me what was wrong and I explained to her the situation. She then left my table and returned with a pizza sauce for the stromboli. She said this was what was missing. I then asked for a re-fill on my water and it came 12 minutes later. The stromboli still was just OK nothing great as I had herd and wanted it to be. The customer service sucked. Thumbs down to Diners Drive Ins and Dives for this recomendation."

That cheesy swiss is so good I can't enough so I like to order one to go so I have some the next day.  There are two other things that are a 'must have' when I go to Four Kegs, besides beer. The Cajun Fries (which seem more like Buffalo Wing Fries) and the Fried Mac n' Cheese.  I know that Fried Mac n' Cheese is more of a thing these days but this was the first place I had ever tried it and in my mind, it is the best!  Those little triangles are perfectly fried and the Mac n' Cheese is so cheesy and delicious I could eat a couple of orders by myself.  It's perfection (when I'm not counting calories)!  The drive from my house to Four Kegs is a bit of a distance but it is always worth it.  I have never been disappointed nor has anyone I have taken there."

Not to worry, the Four Kegs is just on the other side of the parking lot.  There tend to be disturbing (or disturbed) individuals in the parking lot so hurry inside.  \n\nOnce inside, you will be instantly disoriented by the odd shape of the room, an overpowering smell of cigarette smoke, and a dozen or so of the individuals your mother warned you about.  Hang a quick left and go through the glass door by the takeout counter.  You will instantly be comforted by the fresh air and friendly wait staff.    You'll find yourself in another odd shaped dining room reminiscent of Talladega Nights.  Strap on a Ricky Bobby smile and order one of the 4 draft beer choices - thus the name Four Kegs.  Finally order your Strombolli, enjoy your beer, be thankful for the safety of the dining room and plan your eventually escape back through the bar and parking lot.  One thing you will not be disturbed by is the Strombolli - delicious.  Some may be surprised that you will be eating it off of styrofoam plates but at least the utensils are metal.\n\nIn the words of Nelson Mandella, \"I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.

Huge sandwiches overflowing with gooey artery clogging yumminess.  Lots of thinly sliced steak on my Philly sandwich.  My mom got the Italian Stromboli and took half home (I ate it for her later lol).  I hear the Sicilian style pizza is great so that's on my list for next time."

            "review": "I can't think of a more Americanized version of an Italian dish than stromboli, so it is only appropriate that the Four Kegs, a humble sports bar, would have the best version in Vegas. After hearing about these strombolis on one of our favorite Food Network shows, 'Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives,' my husband and I decided to visit this hole in the wall. Upon entering this particular dive we were shocked at the popularity, but upon discovering that draft beer was only $2.50/pint we immediately solved the first part of the puzzle.\n\nNext came the salad ($1.75). It was a watery mess of iceberg and iceberg, which was so bad I couldn't bring myself to finish it (and I always finish my salad). At least it was fresh? At this point, we were hoping that something redeeming could come out of the kitchen. We were then hit with the Cajun fries ($2.95), which, seeing how there was nothing Cajun about them, should have been described as vegetarian chicken wings. I love Frank's Red Hot and ranch dressing just as much as the next Mid-Westerner (I feel I can pass judgement on the use of these ingredients because my husband is from Missouri and I've spent ample time perfecting my Velveeta cheese dip making abilities) but soggy fries just don't cut the mustard.\n\nFinally the stromboli ($8.49) arrived. Stroboli, believe it or not, is also the name of an island off the coast of Sicily, which is a noteworthy place because of its continuous and patterned volcanic eruptions over the last 20,000 years. The stromboli at the Four Kegs isn't quite as miraculous, but was an explosion of tastiness nonetheless. The exterior was crispy and browned, and the filling was appropriately cheesy, meaty, and saucy. Is it hard to make something taste good with these components? Not really, but the expertly constructed crust and price makes this dish a winner. The technique of Mario is to be commended, because he is able to thoroughly cook every bit of the crust without burning it  or leaving a trace of doughiness. This is a feat most bakers in the States would have a hard time accomplishing. We only finished half of it, but I give it a solid thumbs up.\n\nOverall, I will label the Four Kegs as a cheap place to get a filling and above average meal, but stick with the Stromboli and beer. I promise you'll leave happy if you follow those words of advice."

Maybe it's \"good\" when you are on a moderate to heavy state of lubrication. The boli came out and the cheese was not melted and the dough was doughy. Sent it back and they just threw it under the salamander, which if you know how these work, it basically burned the top and didn't really do anything else, like solve the problem of unmelted cheese and uncooked dough. Ordered a side of ranch to help choke it down and they charged $0.50. That in and of itself is perry. Since the boli didn't come with marinara the least they can do is not charge for the ranch unless I'm asking for 20 of them or something. I now remember why I haven't been here for a couple years. I wish yelp would have a personal memo section for restaurants so I can make notes for places I like and dislike."

We saw the triple D episode for this place again a few day's before New Year's 2011 and decided to go on New Year's Eve Eve.....big mistake since it was just on TV and it was the night before a holiday. Being that we never been we didn't know how everything worked, like seat yourself. We finally found a table (we were told the place had been busy since 11am and here it was 5:30pm) waited about 20 minute's just for someone to come get our drink order. There was only 2 waitress' working and you could tell they were not used to it being as busy as it was. We finally ordered our food and it took a hour to get our food. Good thing they gave us cracker's to munch on while we waited. \nWe ordered a large original Stromboli, basket of fries and salad to share between myself, my husband, our 3 year old daughter and my mother in law. It was enough for all of us and had a slice of Stromboli and fries left over to bring home. To be honest it didn't WHOA us and it wasn't horrible but hard to say if we were just so starved from waiting that we didn't care. \nNext to us was our waitress' family and they informed us that it's never that crazy and doesn't take so long to get food. We might go back to try them again before we move this summer to another state to really say if the food was good or if we were just so STARVED that anything tasted good. \nBeing the situation at hand is why I gave 3 stars. If it hadn't just aired right before a holiday and it was this crazy busy and under staffed I would have only given 1 star but since it was this way in hope's I gave them the benefit of the doubt."

This place has gotten really popular due to being on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. Does it live up to the hype? Absolutely. \n\nThey are known for the Stromboli here. I cant recommend these things enough. They are cooked to perfection and have a great flavor and some amazing crust. I like the Original Boli but my wife loves the Meatball Boli. So we always get two smalls and split them up. Meatball is actually starting to become my fav but again both are really good. \n\nThe fried mac and cheese here is another staple that we get. Pair those with a ice cold Killians Irish Red and you got a great meal on your hands. The prices here are really reasonable and the portions are great. There wings are decent but I'm kinda of a wing snob....so I'm tough to please. \n\nIf you wanna get away from the madness of the strip and enjoy some great food and some good beers with a nice local feel. Get to Four Kegs. One thing I will warn you about is that if UNLV is playing this place can get packed. Next time I go I think I am gonna try the pizza. Get in here throw some money into a machine order a ice cold beer and relax....CHEERS"

When I first started going here, I asked \"When does the kitchen close?\" \"Christmas!\" was the reply. So get your grub on here 24/7. 364 days a year. I've read some comments about the smell when you walk in... It smells like smoke, beer and floor cleaner... Up front. In the dining room, it nice and clean. The bar is partitioned from the restaurant to allow smoking. There is a second entrance to the right if you want to avoid the bar all together.\n\nNow, I won't knit-pick the menu. It's all pretty good taken in perspective. The Stromboli is aces, especially after a few beers. I like to get the chicken nachos at the bar sometimes. You cant complain about the portion size on those nachos. Burgers are pretty good too. Only odd thing is they put red wine in the blue cheese dressing and some servings have a little more wine then others. I'd rather just have plain old blue cheese.\n\nI have literally sat at the bar for several hours with 2 or 3 friends. Eaten, had 3 or 4 drinks a piece and been handed a bill for under $60.00... Beat that.\n\nOkay, here's the hipster deterrent portion of my review. No valet, no PBR (I don't think) no hookah bar, no safe space or trigger warning alert system. Just a decent little local public house that is chill and affordable."

Maybe if the bar was cool I may be a bit more generous but the bar's a dump, the dining area's a dump and the food sucks. Here's my story..,\n\nYes, Vegas, baby, indeed. I LOVE eating at nice places but I make shit money, so after eating at a couple more expensive places my gf and I found this place that Guy 'The Tool' Fierio or whatever his name is featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives... WHY? Did he pick this out of a hat? I imagine it wasn't his decision but who the hell's decision was it?\n\nWe decided to sit in the trashy dining area because the bar was full of dirty old men. I couldn't decide between the meatball boli or the classic boli so I asked if I could get a side of meatballs. They don't do that. I have no idea why. I want to buy more things from you but I can't because it's not on the menu. You have meatballs but I can't buy them unless they're in a stromboli. Whatever. I'll go with the classic and I will live to fight another day. My sexy ass, hot chihauha momma got a club sandy with fries and we got stuffed jalepeno poppers. After 15 mins we started to wonder if our poppers fell victim to an incompetent waitress. She was nice but brought out 'entrees' out after 20 mins then told us that she didn't remember that we ordered poppers. Oh...there they are...sitting in the window. At least we got them, I guess?\n\nMy gf's fries were cold, the meat in her sandy was dry and the poppers were whatever. I took one bite of my boli and asked for a box. It was piss poor. They cut it weird, the bread was hard, not crispy but hard for some reason, the cheese was.., weird? And the marinara was bland and tasteless. We packed it up, left a couple bucks tip and headed east to try Lotus of Siam. We're literally waiting in the parking lot for them to open now so we can get a real meal. Review to come.

            "review": "I have lived in Las Vegas for 15 years and have been to Four Kegs countless times, but this is the first time that I can remember ordering anything other than stromboli.\n\n(Back story: We planned to go to lunch at Triple Play, which had the best club sandwich in town, but when we pulled up, IT WAS CLOSED! Like, fencing around the perimeter closed! I am still reeling over it...)\n\nThat said, my heart was set on a club sandwich, so we headed over to Four Kegs, which is not too far away. Pretty crowded for a Friday afternoon, and it seemed like a good mix of locals and tourists, the latter of whom were all dining on the aforementioned stromboli. After ordering our usual beverages (Killian's for him, Shiner Bock for me -- both ice cold on tap), we took a look at the rest of the menu.\n\nMy husband had the daily special, fish and chips, which was not much more than three frozen filets dropped in the deep fryer along with a side of fries. Nothing to write home (or here) about. \n\nI, of course, had the club sandwich. Although it's unfair to compare this club with the heavenly (and now defunct) club from Triple Play, this still wasn't quite what I had envisioned. All the usual suspects were there -- ham, turkey, cheese, lettuce, and tomato on rye -- but the bread wasn't toasted, it was cut in half (instead of quartered), and there were only two pieces of bread instead of the traditional (IMHO) three. Don't get me wrong; this was still a tasty sandwich. And I may be knocking it down a grade because I am still in mourning for my Triple Play fave. But while I will now be on the lookout for a place with a great club sandwich, I already know that THIS is the place for a great stromboli. And that's what we'll both be ordering next time. (My tip on that: Order one original and one beef/cheddar, and split them.)"

They are efficient and friendly, and I'm sure they have seen and heard it all. The food is simple but good. My friend and I had stromboli. They were good and I'd say worth the trip from the strip."

I don't know what rock these people crawled out from under. Many (not all) are nasty looking with stained clothing and missing teeth. But friendly, really friendly, so if you can get past their appearance you'll be fine.\n\nUpon entering Four Kegs you walk into a dingy bar, and entering another set of doors leads you to a dining room straight out of the 70's (or maybe 60's, what do I know?). It's separate from the bar so you can bring kids in here. The furniture is old and rickety, booths need to be reupholstered and this place definitely needs a facelift. Hell it's probably been around longer than most of you reading this have been alive. \n\nThe food - typical bar menu with lots of fried food, finger foods, burgers and sandwiches. Over the years, our kids have ordered pretty much everything off the menu, including breakfast, Overall the food is very average - nothing spectacular.\n\nThe crown jewel of this shithole is their Stromboli and square Sicilian pizza. The pizza isn't the best, but I think it's a step above the chains. I really like the crust, which compares to the crust at BJ's or Numero Uno. Not as good, but trying to be.  I'd take this over a pizza hut any day, but Broadway Pizza is way better. I've been eating it for almost 20 years now and it hasn't changed one bit. \n\nPapa D has been eating the Stromboli here for over 30 years and swears by them. Actually I believe this was one of his hangouts in the 70's! I don't think it's all that, but he loves it so I go to keep him happy. I prefer the pizza. \n\nYou'll always have lunch available the next day as the portions are huge - the small stromboli is big enough for two people.\n\nDiner Beware - this place is a DIVE. I've been eating here for 20 years, I'm a fan,  and yet I still cringe when I walk in the door."

The menu has a vast array of appetizers and sandwiches, and entrees. We had to go in for the \"Boli\" which what they are famous for. They even have vegetarian Boli for the non meat eaters. We went for the Original and it was off the GOT DAMN CHAIN!!! The crust was light, crispy, and absolutely delicious. I never had a crust like that. Crispy, and just salty enough. The sauce inside was outstanding. Just the perfect amount and not over flowing so you can pick it up. The cheese was fresh and tangy and the Salami, ham, and suasage were just flavor explosions. Also we had the wings. Crispy and sauced just right. The sauce had the right balance of heat and buttery goodness, Also weren't drenched in the sauce so it was easier to eat. All the food looked great, as we were watching the crowded dining room get served. SO many things to try so you won't be dissapointed. They definetly have something for everyone. Can't wait to go again with the homies and have a a few drinks and some outstanding food. Until next time, Let's Eat!!"

The veggies were deeply breaded and served with ranch and a spicy honey mustard. The wings were big. I'll give them that, but the meat was not super tender.

I would recommend this if you are in Vegas and trying to find great Italian and not wanting to do the tourist thing. This is definitely a locals secret. If you are hoping for a nice place to eat. I wouldn't stop here. If you are looking for quality food and don't care about the ambiance. I would say this is a most. Three stars only for service but 4 stars for the food.

Soaked in hot sauce and served on foam plates.  Most any large chain restaurant will have much better food and served on real plates.  The \"boli\" was undercooked and plain.  Tasted a little bitter/sour.  Pizza hut or any national chain has better pizza based fare than this place.\nSave yourself the trouble and avoid this experience."
