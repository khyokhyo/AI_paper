I just tried the happy hour for the first time a couple weeks ago and that was lovely as well. The bartender served us and she was fantastic, attentive and made great suggestions. My date enjoyed everything he had and he had two of the cocktails, their signature drinks that I can't remember the name of and they were both wonderful. Love this place, and I am a for life customer!"

            "review": "I will never eat here again!\n\nDear Adam Gomes, General Manager, Via Brasil Steakhouse,  Las Vegas, Nevada  8917\n\nI have been a customer at your restaurant for many years and my wife and I, frequent your establishment at least four times a year for dinner in addition, at least that many times and enjoy your Happy Hour.\nI thought I should reach out and contact you before I post my commentary on my experience at your restaurant on New Year's Eve.\nI was contacted by your representative a few days before New Year's Eve and I was instructed that payment was required in advance in order to secure our 9:30 PM reservation. I was also told that a higher than normal price will be charged.  I was fine with that and agreed to pay in advance. I was told that you were serving dinner, at a lower price to other patrons that were served earlier that evening and for those that wished to attend for NYE, would be served in a party atmosphere with music, desert bar and a champagne toast.\nPer the request of your representative, I arrived at your restaurant just after 9:30 PM.  I want told I had to wait for a table.  I was not pleased I had to wait to be seated even though I pre-paid for a reservation at your request. You did not accommodate me upon my arrival as expected. I was not seated until around 10:10 PM!  Your service and planning worked to collect payment in advance but you did not provide the service you demanded advance payment for!\nYou usual sumptuous salad buffet was lacking in some of your normal variety and, even more disappointing, was the fact that many of the dishes remained empty.\nThe music that was played by your DJ entertainer was not matched with the demographics and age of your clientele that was in attendance.  It was an obvious and blatant error and was further evidenced by that lack of your customers on the dance floor.  How anyone as a professional can be so far off, is beyond belief.  This should have been recognized and immediately corrected.  Nobody seemed to be in charge and more importantly, nobody seemed to care.\nAt this point in time, I feel like I need to find another restaurant to take my steady stream of business to.\nAs a courtesy, I wanted to voice my experience to you in advance of posting this on any social sites.\nHopefully you will learn from this horrible failure that evening and make changes in the future.\n\nI wrote to Adam Gomes and his obnoxious wife, Anna, on two separate occasions in order to elicit some response.  They never responded and that only indicates that they do not care about customer relations!  I will NEVER eat here again!\nI suggest you do the same!  They don't care about their customers!  There are too many other great restaurants nearby."

It was just okay from the reviews I expected more . The staff super friendly and accommodating. The sangria I ordered was pretty good as well.  The meat was either salty or not enough seasoning.  Salad bar not to many things ehh. For $50 per person I mean we tried about 4-5 different meats from the 21 different kinds they had and it was enough to form our personal opinions.  Always wanted to try one though so hey a 1st for everything.  Maybe it'll be your own cup of tea not ours though."

            "review": "Sweet i've found me another happy hour that is both enjoyable and not wallet busting.\n\nStarted out with a Passion Martini (Sky Passion Infused Vodka and Muddled Strawberry)\nVery girly looking drink with the reddish pink color and bits of muddled strawberry but it's light and has a pleasant sweetness to it without any bite from the vodka. Well balanced but not very pronounced in the passion fruit flavor. I tend to order drinks slightly on the sweeter side and this caught my attention because i have a soft spot for passion fruit. Had i payed attention and actually read the rest of the menu i would have ordered the Passion Fruit mojito.\n\nWe came from another nearby restaurant taking advantage of their happy hour and someone suggested that we hit up Via Brasil's since it's pretty close by so i didnt order very much.\n\nGrabbed a Asparagus Risotto that was decent at best. It tasted more of a rice in a heavy sauce with some asparagus bits instead of an actual risotto.\n\nAdditionally while browsing the menu (regular menu not happy hour) the Brazilian style kale soup caught my eye and i ordered one of those. The broth was very bland and the sausages they threw in had no flavor at all. Also the kale was julienne so there was no big chunks of kale instead there was a huge mess of kale slivers. I was in the mood for a soup and this one didnt meet my expectations but then again who orders soup in a Brazilian style steak house?\n\nI plan on coming back here in the near future. Since it was my first time here i didnt know i can order the same cuts of meat by the ounce and pay for it that way instead of doing the entire Brazilian steakhouse dining experience"

            "review": "Recently, my family of 4 (my wife, two kids-9 & 6, myself) celebrated my wife's birthday at Via Brasil.  She had been there once before, but this was the first visit for the rest of us.  I had trepidations from reading so many comments about how \"formal\" it was, and how it was not good for children.  Both of those comments could not be farther from what we experienced!\n\nWhen I made reservations online, I clearly indicated that we would have two young children, maybe just to see if the restaurant would give some indication of their reaction...but within 10 minutes, I got a phone call to confirm the request and welcoming our children to dine with us.  At that time, I also mentioned that it was my wife's birthday, and they graciously said they would \"do something\" as a surprise.  Yes, I know this is becoming perhaps an all-too-familiar 'perk' for restaurants as well as many diners (to have to hear Happy Birthday chanted several times during their meal!).\n\nThe decor is upscale and suggests the kind of place with some snoot appeal, where people may come to be seen, but let's face it, this is a suburban restaurant, and what restaurant would risk alienating the down-to-earth folks with an overly haughty attitude these days?  Via Brasil gets it just right in that the 'hardware' is upscale and formal, but the staff and service is engaging and friendly, without any pretentiousness whatsoever.\n\nWhen we arrived, I immediately noticed many parties with children...although I couldn't help but note that they all seemed to be seated in the front section of the restaurant, and that maybe the staff was consciously trying to keep the back part of the large open dining area somewhat kid-free and quiet.  It didn't matter to us - the entire dining room is beautiful, and the food is the same regardless of what GPS cell your table is in!\n\nAs for the food, I rated it 4 stars and not 5 just because there were some items that were not quite as superlative as others.  Everything happened as others have mentioned:  you sit for a short while, order drinks, and build up a little more anticipation, but then it's a bee-line to the buffet, which had more variety than the average casino/hotel buffet.  Salads, soups, and various hot dishes (stroganoff, a curry dish, a risotto, seafood paella, etc.), along with appetizers that were presented well and tasted great (carpaccio, asparagus,  etc.).  NOTE:  The captain had come over shortly after we were seated to let me know that our 9-year old would be given a very reduced price for the entire meal (around $15, I think), and she would be able to eat anything she wanted (all meats, etc.), and that our 6-year old would not be charged at all.  While I don't know if that's their standard policy, I felt that was more than fair, and certainly goes a long way to encourage \"family dining\" at this restaurant from time to time.  The waitstaff was great in handling our children, too, always stopping at each one of them to see if they, too, wanted to try whatever cut of meat they were offering on each round.\n\nEven as we were coming back with full plates of appetizers, freshly grilled meats were being 'walked' around the tables, and the noshing (if one can 'nosh' on meats!) started right away.  Before we knew what hit us, we had cuts and slices of so many different types of meats...and most of it was excellent.  All of the beef offerings (rib eye, picanha, flank steak, garlic picanha, and the prime rib; we passed on the ribs because they were too huge and wouldn't fit on our plates at the time) were fantastic.  My wife enjoyed the lamb chops immensely, though I wish we had stuck around for the leg of lamb to make its rounds.  The other offerings - turkey, pork, and salmon - were a little hit-or-miss, probably because I prefer my meats less 'garnished', and these were typically crusted or sprinkled with parmesan or wrapped in bacon.  Actually, I enjoyed the salmon, though many may find its smoked flavoring a little washed out and bland, and its texture a little pasty instead of flaky (imagine cooked small roe!).  The sausage didn't do anything for me...but then again, I'm not a sausage fan.\n\nBefore we knew it, almost 2 hours had elapsed, which is saying a lot when dining with 2 children!  They had sampled quite a few meats, too, and while it may not become their favorite restaurant, I think the \"bigness\" of the experience kept them from becoming restless, and they both said they enjoyed VBS.\n\nI'm running out of room here..so I'll just say LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!  They also remembered my quick comment about my wife's birthday, and delivered birthday wishes as requested!  Definitely a place to consider for all occasions, but do plan on spending a good deal of time and money (around $150 for the entire experience, even with the generous discounts for the kids, and we aren't wine drinkers).  I hope this place stays around a while!!"

The turkey is probably my favorite but the prime rib and picanha are also what I look forward to when we go. The meat comes around faster than you can eat it. My daughter loves the salad bar and goes just for that.\n\nTips: The Sunday brunch is the best deal out of all of them. It is $25 with many of the same meats along with breakfast items.  If you sign up for their email newsletter they will send you $5 off coupons for brunch. They will also send other coupons now and then for dinner."

            "review": "Holy meat!   I discovered this place during an off-strip trip to Las Vegas.  This place is very much in the vein of Fogo de Chao in Los Angeles and other major cities.   Our visit occurred during Carnaval season and as a result we had a great time with all the dancers they brought in and all the beads and decorations at the tables.  It was a very festive atmosphere the night we ate dinner here.   \n\nThe biggest piece of advice I can give about this place to newbies is \"don't eat for a day prior to going.\"  Cuz, you are going to want to gorge yourself on all the yummy meats.   Everywhere you turn there is a waiter carving up some kind of yummy morsal of meat.  If you haven't been to one of these meat fests, the general idea is that you sit and waiters bring meat to your table and carve off what you would like to try.   They keep coming until you tell them to stop. When you are seated each person is given a set of green and red cards.  You put the green card out when you are ready to eat and you put the red card out when your pants can take no more. \n\nWith chicken, beef, pork and more, you simply can't go hungry.  If you need some veggies they have the greens covered in a large salad bar which you can visit to your hearts content.   The food was really enjoyable and I would go again.    If you make it out of this place hungry then surely hell has frozen over.  Good eats, good times!"

The food was so yummy.  The salad bar wasn't your typical lettus and dressing either.  They had pasta, roasted veggies and other different dishes.  The meat was a little plain, but the chutney they provided to put on it made up for it completely.  My husband and I tried the rack of lamb, beef wrapped in bacon, turkey breast wrapped in bacon, prime rib, chicken drumsticks, and the beef ribs.  The only thing we didn't like was the lamb, but then again neither of us really lamb to begin with.  My husband also tried the salmon and he loved it.  The service was also great.

Brunch was a very different experience, grilled meat was very good of course but service was way off. Nobody explained the brunch menu and there is no printed menu; waiter forgot drink orders; waiter was very slow to check on table - not enough waiters appears to be the problem. I never did find out if they serve their vegetables for brunch in fact I'm still not sure what defines this as brunch. There was a waffle station, the salad bar with some non-brunch type hot items in the bar and the grilled meat. Really didn't meet up to our expectation. Also 30 minutes late in seating us from our reservation time. Fix the service, create a real brunch menu and add waiters. And fix the problem with not honoring reservations at the reservation time."

Place wasn't overly crowded which was nice. Our oldest was given a fuzzy coloring board which was really cool. Our baby was given a light up bracelet which he really enjoyed. \n\nTheir buttons are small- colored red and dark blue. They should really change those colors. We were passed over many times (we were sat in a corner). The salad bar was skim pickin when I went up but they did have muscles and clams which I enjoyed. \n\nThe food was just \"eh\" as I didn't find myself wanting or needing more of well anything. Out of the norm for a Brazilian steak house! The meat didn't really stand out for me and that was disappointing for the price. They do have seafood additions but we only had shrimp pass us accompanied with the steak and the clams/muscles I mentioned previously.  Having refills on my sofa was nice compared to previous places. Their bread is delicious and stays warm.\n\nI don't think my family would be back though based on the main course not wowing us. It's just a waste of hard earned money in our opinion."

            "review": "This place was much better than Texas de Brazil and not to mention a little cheaper.  The BF said that all the meats were really good and not as tough as TDB's meats.  The salad bar had a little less selection in the vegetable area, but there was beef carpaccio (better than Brio's apparently), mussels, and other seafood selections not offered at TDB.  The passed meats included picanha, rib eye, flank steak, leg of lamb, rack of lamb, bacon wrapped turkey, chicken, baby back pork ribs, beef ribs, salmon, and Brazilian sausage (I couldn't stop laughing when the BF told the guy with the sausage how much he \"love[s] Brazilian sausage\").\n\nThe sides that the AYCE Rodizio dinner comes with are mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, cheese rolls, cinnamon sugar bananas (yum), and others upon request (just ask your waiter) all included in the set price.  The only thing that wasn't included was dessert.\n\nBefore coming I visited their website and signed up for their weekly newsletter and received an e-mail for 20% off  their Rodizio dinner for up to 4 people - awesome, now we can do a double date with our friends.\n\nThe service here was really good.  Our water glasses were always filled, and they asked (before we had to ask) if we would like more Coke - a very rare experience.  We were looking for the lamb so we asked the flank steak guy and literally 1 minute after he left, the lamb dude showed up - amazing.  \n\nAlso they have a mini-Rodizio offering AYCE 5 meats (picanha, ribeye, lamb, turkey wrapped in bacon, and salmon) for only $18.95 (Available in the bar and patio area only).  Might go back to try this option... too bad they don't offer the Brazilian sausage.  haha"

            "review": "Like a recent Yelper's review of Via Brasil, I dont give 5 star reviews often but Im thrilled when Im able to.  In my book, to earn 5 stars means a restaurant has mastered its niche.  That is, a hamburger stand could certainly earn 5 stars like a fine french dining experience.  Its all a mater of context.  That being said, Via Brasil is definitely a 5 star Palace of Food.  \n\nI have eaten at plenty of Brazilian Churascarrias over the years and I can say Via Brasil takes the cake over all them.  I recently went on a weeknight with my nephew to celebrate a new job and we were immediately taken back by the amazing synthesis of upscale and casual in the same environment.  The restaurant is beautiful or being in a Summerlin strip mall.  They have their salad bar in the center of the restaurant and a small, but comfortable bar off to the side.  The restaurant is ringed by windows and while there isnt much a view, it does get beautiful colors and light during the sunset.  The staff immediately sat us, described how the restaurant worked and the fun began.\n\nThe first thing we were greeted with was this soft, warm cheese bread that was fantastic.  We then approached the salad bar and soon found out that salad is but a small component of the overall spread.  This \"salad\" bar had warm dishes as well like Ravioli, scalloped potatoes, stroganoff and a sort of seafood Ciappiono, all of which were delicious.  As for its cold selections, there were pasta salads, fresh mussels, beef carpaccio, caprese and a host of other amazing & fresh foods.  I had to be careful, otherwise I was going to get full just on the salad bar so I limited my intake although I could have easily just partook in the salad bar all evening.  In fact, I think its an option for around 20 bucks for those not inclined to enjoy the rodizio selections.  \n\nAfter the fabulous salad bar, we began the meat parade.  Using a small disc thats green on one side and red on the other, we flipped it green and a constant delivery of protein was soon ambling its way over to our table on skewers where the waiters slice it off table side.  For a couple items, like the suckling pig and the salmon, they actually to table side carving off a cart.  The meats were amazing with special recognition going to the bacon wrapped turkey, salmon, garlic sirloin, parmesan pork loin and flank steak.  \n\nAs if the meats werent enough to chew on at this time, more waiters flooded our table with a selection of side dishes like mashed potatoes, fried plantains (bananas) and broccoli.  They have more sides like beans, rice and fried Yucca should you want them as well.  I cant recommend the fried Yucca enough as it was a perfect compliment to the meat.  Think of it as a less starchy, slightly sweeter steak french fry.   The total amount of meats that made it to our table was 16 and once you get through the whole roster they invite you to request any of them to come back out for more.  No mas for this guy...if I didnt have gout before, Im sure my body was one more bite away from developing it!\n\nWhile there is a desert menu, I couldnt even think about it.  All I wanted to do was get home and throw on some elastic pants.  While I may have been in pain, it was a good pain and worth the effort.  The staff at VIa Brasil is top notch and took time to explain every dish for us and the preparation.  I found the prices to be reasonable for the Brazilian Churascarrian dining experience and especially for the quality.  Its essentially 40 bucks a person for the full shabangabang.  I cant wait to get back and explore their wine menu next time (nephew is under 21 so we decided to go the soda route) and I hear they have live music on the weekends!  It may take 2 months to digest all the food and once it is, you can definitely bet  I'll be back.\n\nAs a bonus:  its so refreshing to have a restaurant of this quality in the neighborhood without having to deal with a casino/resort!"

The brunch is a great value ($19.99 for adults if you join the e-club) and the Brunch has: Breakfast food, Salad Bar.....and of course the MEATS! They also have grilled pineapple which is awesome. If you do the Brunch.....ask for a \"Filet Mignon Benedict\" and be prepared to have a little slice of Heaven. This place is very similar to Texas de Brazil, but I think its more affordable and the atmosphere is more laid back. Dinner is a little more.....around $40 per adult, but the food is always GREAT and I have been here many, many times.....never a bad experience."

I was dressed down because I eat better when I feel more relaxed.  I made it a point to eat everything on the menu and I told our host/server that.  Certain items on the menu have to be requested.  The salmon and passion fruit sauce was so good.  I enjoyed every piece of yummy protein and they still have the best salad bar evaarrrr.  I really enjoyed the prime rib also w/a side of horseradish.  The cheeseball bread cleared my taste buds/pallets each time.  \n\nAfter that, we saved room for dessert and they brought the cart around.  I got a passion fruit mousse and my friend got creme brulee.  After paying for the meal and leaving a $30 tip we stayed and caught up a lil bit longer.  I saw the salmon cart go around and had to get another piece.  =]\n\nGood stuff good stuff, haven't been here in over a year and I believe the price may have jumped.

They have a small salad bar compared to others, but the options are different and you have a nice variety of soups, sides, and salad toppers.  We also loved the many side dishes that we can order with our meats:  rice, beans, veggies, mashed potatoes, fries, and I know I'm leaving out a few, but look at how many you can have.  And its all included in the price.  Some places only offer you bread, bananas, and mashed potatoes.  \n\nThey also have two areas where you can have large groups, receptions, etc.  I think we might have found where we are going to have a rehersal dinner.  Its perfect and everyone can enjoy some great food."

Small shrimp were also offered.  Side dishes were served three times before WE had to ask for other items which are included on the Sterling menu.  \n\nClever:  fill 'em up with the cheap stuff so they are too full to consume the expensive meats.  Not so clever at all.\n\nWhich featured menu items were never voluntarily offered and did we have to ask for?   lamb chops, prime rib, ribeye steak, salmon.  One serving of each meat received, never a morsel of the salmon.\n\nThe value just isn't there; no ambiance/music; manager and assistant managers walked around slowly in circles, never once stopping at our table to test our satisfaction.  \n\nBe advised:  choose Texas de Brazil over via Brazil."

Very open with an understated, modern feel. Not too fancy, not too casual. The service is good. Not outstanding, but good.\n\nI was here for brunch. Again, the prices are fab. Less than $25 for AYCE salad bar, meats, omelettes, benedicts, and waffles. And then an additional $15 for all you can drink bloody marys, mimosas, bellinis, etc. Needless to say, I filled up fast.\n\nThe salad bar is on the small side, but I liked that they also had hot offerings, incluidng a lobster bisque soup, steamed clams, and rigatoni alla vodka. The vodka sauce was quite delicious.\n\nFor the meats, there were numerous offerings. A couple were really good. Others were just ok. And others were eh, I'll just leave the rest of it sitting here on the my plate. Unlike some of the competitors, Via Brasil has warm pineapple, ham, chicken, turkey, etc. But the red meat is truly what it's all about - and it's what tastes the best IMHO.\n\nIf you somehow still manage to have room after all that food, there is also a dessert cart where you can select from an array of desserts, I had the cheesecake. The cheesecake itself was fine, but the berries were a bit too tart for my liking (and I love tart and sour things too). I'm not sure there's really a point to getting dessert here.\n\nIn the end, I'm still a bigger fan of a competitor place. But I can definitely see myself coming here again for brunch."

Generally I always come away thinking \"should of gone to fogo\".\n\nVia Brasil is the first place where I have come away thinking \"better than fogo\". \n\nI will assume you are familliar with the concept of a churascaria and not explain the concept and what not, here is a point by point break down of item/winner. The service at both is excellent blah blah blah\n\nCheese bread- Fogo. Via tends to be a little drier and the individual cheesey poofs are smaller. They are also not served as piping hot.\n\nLime aid- fogo by default\n\nBlack Beans- fogo- actually has linguica/pork in it. \n\nOther sides- Via and it isn't close. They have way more options (including Yucca fries, street food etc).\n\nCaipirinha- Fogo. It is more consistent, comes in a nicer solid feeling glass, and they dont have fruit flavored options which is a plus.\n\n\nMeat\nPicanha- this is just about the only meat that fogo wins. While picanha at Via can be great, it is inconsistent where as every single god damned time it comes around at fogo it is life altering.\n\nBeef Rib- Via. It is never dried out, and since this is one of my favorites I view it as pretty important.\n\nBottom sirloin- my other favorite- fogo. They have similar cuts at Via occassionally but no salt encrusted cheap ass bottom sirloin... god its so good\n\nTop Sirloin/Alcatra- Via- it comes thicker here which means you can still get more slices that have a crust and are medium/rare\n\nSausage/Linguica- Fogo\n\nPork Ribs- i never get these at either place, mediocre always\n\nParmesan Pork- Fogo by default\n\nFrango/Bacon rapped- Via- oftne when i get these at fogo the bacon is not cooked/crisp but the meat is over cooked- a sure sign that they have been left in too long away from the fire. Not so at via\n\nLamb- I don't relaly eat this either when there is so much beef available but dining companions tell me fogo is better\n\nRibeye and Garlic Beef- these are very similar and both are better at Via"

The salmon took an hour to serve, after informing us it would take 10 minuites. When it finally came, it was too dry, so a waste of money and our time waiting.  They came around only twice to serve two  shrimp at a time, which was served an hour inbetween. The Rodizio Prime, listed more meats than what was actually served. They kept serving the same three meats.  We asked our server to change one of the orders to the Prime because we had been waiting a long time for the salmon. The server didn't appologize. The manager spoke to us, who didn't seem to understand the frustration of her customers, nor cared that we were unsatified with the service. She was not friendly and for a bill that was over $500.00, was debating with us for a $10.00 reduction on the bill. They were not busy, so the lack of service was no excuse. The side dishes are all you can eat, but they never came around to ask us if we needed more. I was very embarrassed, because I recommend this resturant to our out of town quests, who actually paid for the dinner. I will not be returning, neither will the other quests in the party. Too pricey for the poor service and what a rip off. Make sure you count the types of meats they serve. They list alot, but only bring out a few."

If you are not familar with the concept these brazilian steakhouses are an all you eat motif with a salad bar and then meats on long skewers are brought to the table and you can have as much of them as you desire.\n\nMost of the meats were hot (not all) and flavorful.  There was prime rib, steak, chicken, sausage and some I am probably forgetting.  They also include in the price all of the side dishes you want, served in a family style fashion, meaning enough for the whole table.  The sides were OK but not that special.\n\nI actually found while the salad bar had many choices along with soup that making an old fashion salad was not an option.  But if the salad bar is your thing you are going here for the wrong reason and paying way too much.\n\nWe were celebrating a 60 year anniversary for my girlfriend's parent and they made us feel special and catered to the 80 year olds well.\n\nMy biggest complaint and one which really lasted with me was that the servers and our waiter while seeming polite were actually rude when it came to interrupting on-going conversations at the table.  None of the servers or the waiters seemed even remotely aware that when they come to the table with questions or food to say \"excuse me\" or wait until they were noticed and instead they proceeded to talk at us with no regard to what was going on at the table.  In some ways I am betting they see this as being attentive but if the same thing happened any other place it would have been classified as what it was, rude.\n\nIn my opinion and this is what Yelp is all about, the staff was poorly trained in this one area.  They were otherwise quite gracious.\n\nOne last issue and while it was only $7, we had purchased a restaurant.com certificate for $3 which was to cover the first $25 of the bill.  They informed us they were no longer accepting the certificates and offered us a $15 discount. How you can decide to cancel an offer we already paid for is beyond me and they tried to appease us but ended up cheating us out of a few dollars, just not cool.\n\nFor those who love beef and who can afford over $40 for dinner this place is still a great experience and be aware as others have written that unless you want to pay dearly for water be specific and ask for tap water."

Personally, any time I can support a local business I am all over it!  The dinner menu consists of two choices. Regular menu which is AYCE for $34.95 and the Deluxe Menu that is AYCE $49.95. The difference is the deluxe menu has premium cuts of meat, and seafood. We decided to go with the deluxe menu, and I am not sure I really knew which was which to be honest, everything was really good! I guess maybe if we had done the regular premium meat would have whisked on by? \n\nIt was all really great! Mountains of meat, a few beverages and somehow managed to save room to split a dessert!

My boyfriend made reservations for his mom's birthday and he told us that we needed to dress \"smart casual\" which was on the website or something. We were all like.. \"wtf is smart casual?\". Anyway, it definitely isn't a jeans and t-shirt type of restaurant. The atmosphere is very nice and they have some nice waterfall type thing. It wasn't too busy for a Saturday night but it the live jazz music really set the mood (versus the corny christmas music they played while the two musicians took a break I'm guessing).\n\nI started off at the salad bar which isn't only limited to \"salad\". They had rice pilaf, beans, beef carpaccio, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, ravioli, risotto, and more. Everything was delicious and I was quite excited to try the beef carpaccio since I have never before. Really good and the saltiness of the parmesan cheese made it more palatable, in my opinion. (I love raw fish but always iffy when it comes to raw meat)\n\nThe waiters come around with their sticks of meat. My favorite was the sirloin.. omg.. it was soooo juicy and delicious. The flank was tough, dry and had no flavor. The prime rib was excellent. I have never tried lamb before and boy, that was goooood. I didn't get the chicken but I did try the bacon wrapped turkey which was ah, okay. Nothing special. But boy, that sirloin was winnahhhs! I'll be dreaming about that for a long time!\n\nFor dessert we got passion fruit mousse (too rich and sweet for me), creme brule, and flan. I am not a dessert person whatsoever.. so to me.. it was all too rich and sweet. \n\nService is beyond excellent. They are very polite and quick! Always a \"your welcome\" when saying thank you. We asked one of the guys (manager, I'm guessing -- he was wearing a suit) for the fish since we hadn't seen it yet, and not even one minute later, the salmon came around. The bf's sister asked for the dessert menu and again, the desert cart came around within just a few seconds! \n\nOverall, their food is awesome and their service is even more awesome. Since the bf and I are poor college students, we can't afford to eat here too often.. but I'm glad that we decided to take his mom here.. the experience was definitely worth the money!"

On our last visit we ordered the signature Brazilian drink the caipirinha, delicious by the way, and when the manager came around to check on us, she noticed our drinks were not being drunk, and asked if they were made to our satisfaction, the truth is with all the food; the amazing salad bar with its impressive variety & the yummy side dishes you get to choose from & the parade of seemingly endless meats served by friendly gauchos, the drinks got overlooked!! We forgot all about them!!! But major points for noticing that there may have been an issue with them. \n\nI know this isn't the only churrascaria in town. There are several to choose from. Texas De Brazil in town square, good. Same exact concept but different vibe. Very hustley & bustley. A very different pace than Via Brasil. And certainly not as friendly. And I once used the restroom there...to wash my hands before my meal. And it was not a good experience. Someone had some major issues in one of the stalls and I couldn't get the horror out of my mind all through dinner. There is also Fogo de Chao which I've never tried but can't imagine it to be better than Via Brasil. Via Brasil's location scores points too...not in a busy mall or on the strip. \nGreat brunch & happy hour specials as well. If you like meat, this is your place!! And if you don't, you can order just the salad bar portion which has a good variety of hot food too! Last time they had steamed clams on the bar!!! Jackpot!!"

That's nothing to be ashamed about.... it just means the restaurant was nothing great, but not terrible TO ME.  Yelp is a site for posting your opinions.  But some guy named Dustin J. had to send me a private message saying:\n\n\"We are very sorry that Our Happy Hour is too expensive for you. \nPlease visit McDonalds, Taco Bell and other fast foods if this is too expensive for you\"\n\nIt took me a minute to figure out what restaurant he was referring to, but when I found 20 photos for Via Brasil, I figured it out  Congratulations, guys, I will never return to your restaurant and will make sure nobody I ever talk to does either.

There are some lapses in attentiveness, but they get overwhelmed during peak business hours.\n\nThe brunch is phenomenal. With $17 all you can drink mimosas, bellinis, strawberry kir royales, mango champagne, white wine spritzers, and sangria. You cannot get a better deal. $6.50 is not a bad deal either, but you might as well go all in and enjoy yourself. \n\nThe meat selection consisted of 9-10 different cuts of different animals. The picanha, garlic sirloin, prime rib, and pineapple were the group favorites. If the rodizio attendants don't come around regularly enough, you can ask the waiter to send them over.\n\nThe salad bar was where I found them to be weaker. I wish I could say that something stood out, but it was all relatively standard. The omelet and waffle bar does make up for it though. They do need a secondary waffle iron, because it was backed up for a majority of the time."

Its tender slices will melt-in-your-mouth. Another personal favorite is the tangy chicken. \n\nI've never seen a salad bar that has fresh lobster bisque or watermelon topped with diced jicama. The little bites of Brazilian bread are delectable dipped in the bisque! \n\nTry the caipirinha--a Brazilian cocktail--but sip it slowly as it's nearly straight alcohol. The light refreshing taste can fool you! \n\nSunday Brunch features a good selection of their most popular meats, along with a \"made-to-order\" omelette and waffle bar and the gourmet salad bar. The mimosas delightfully round out the brunch. \n\nFor tourists, Via Brasil is worth the cab trip off of the Strip to see what else Vegas has to offer. For locals, it's a slice of heaven!"

The experience of dealing with incompetent hostesses and a staff with no knowledge of a proper restaurant reservation system deserved 1 star. However, the experience consisting of the food and the waitstaff service (after waiting 50 minutes and then finally getting seated) was 5 stars. So to balance it out, my rating is at 4.\n\nA little delay and backup of seating times on big holiday weekends is understandable. However, the Mother's day brunch reservation system was highly unorganized and every single party (whether a 2-top, 4, 6, or very large party 10+) waited on average one hour after their reservation time to be seated. Many people were very upset, some left, some (like us) stuck it out and the feeling was very chaotic.\n\nThat said, the waitstaff and the quality of the food really came to the rescue. Once you were actually seated it was business as expected. The quality of the food was outstanding and some of my favorites were the beef carpaccio and turkey wrapped in bacon.\n\nI will also give management credit for giving us several gift cards and complimentary desserts as consideration for our extremely long wait.\n\nI'm not sure if I have confidence in Via Brasil's reservation system to go back for a holiday weekend meal, but for a casual meal with family or friends, I absolutely would."

We had a reservation that I showed up 20 minutes early for but was sat an hour after our reservation time. Another party that had a \"3:30pm\" reservation arrived 20 minutes late and was sat before us. I understand it was a holiday but I do feel that management could have been a little more prepared and not made us wait so long. When we were finally taken over to a table, it was small, not fully setup and there were 7 seats for a party of 8. When we asked if we could use the small table next to us we got attitude and said it was reserved. I said we had a reservation too and have waited for an hour. The lady said \"oh so now you have 8 people\" very rudely. I said no, we always had 8!! Finally after a bunch of back and forth (which should have never been) we were able to pull the table over and add to our table. Maybe they could have comped one meal or the drinks for the inconvenience  but not even an apology, just attitude!\n\nThe plus, the meats were really good and the guys carving the meat were very friendly. Could have used more sides but our server was busy and understandably since it was a holiday. \n\nMaybe we will come back, just never ever again on a holiday. \n\nManagement - take note, when you realize your guests are upset, don't respond with rudeness and attitudes. Offer a free drink or desert. Make up for the bad experience so that you will have return guests!"

Unless you're a vegetarian, this place is amazing.\n\nIf you've never gone to a Brazilian steakhouse before, it's quite an experience. It's all you can eat and you are given a card that's green on one side and red on the other. If you want them to bring more, then green side up. If you're full or just want to take a break, red side up. Of the 18 different meats on the menu, almost all are carried around on what can best be described as mini swords. If the waiter sees your card is green side up, he/she will stop, slice you off as much as you want, and then make way for the next waiter. A few of the bigger items, like beef ribs and salmon, are brought around on a cart, but the same principles apply. The service style is called \"rodizio.\"\n\nI've found that the skirt steak, top sirloin, and leg of lamb are the best, but it's entirely subjective. Most of the steaks have a similar seasoning, which has a slight salty taste, but everything is very good. \n\nThe best way to approach this massive intake is to focus on the meats first, then finish off with the salad bar, because let's be real here...you aren't going to get your money's worth if you do it the other way around. The salad bar is well stocked with dishes ranging from meat and seafood entrees to various veggies to appetizer-ish items. They usually have calamari salad and hearts of palm, so I'm always satisfied. \n\nThe drinks at this place are top notch too. There is a respectable wine selection and an assortment of Brazilian drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The two worth mentioning are the guarana and caipirinha. The first is a soda that tastes like Red Bull, and the second is the national drink of Brazil. I was expecting the second to be more of a, well...drink, but it turns out it's just straight liquor with a splash of lime juice and sugar. It's got a really good flavor, however, it'll definitely wake you up if you're aren't expecting something so strong. \n\nThe dessert cart merits a look before you decide to call it a night. I'm sort of a tiramisu pig, and theirs is worth trying. I won't say it's the best I've ever had, but I also have impossibly high standards in this field. Theirs is, without a doubt, more than good enough to warrant ordering again. They have creme brulee, cakes, mousses, and a few others too. Come to think of it, their desserts are pretty much what you would expect at an Italian restaurant. \n\nI would rate this place as one of my favorite restaurants in all of Las Vegas, but I can't really go there too often since it's a little cost-prohibitive. Dinner for two with drinks and dessert will run you about $120 after tax and tip. That said, they do offer some specials that will appeal to more budget-conscious diners. Mon-Thurs from 5-7, they have a limited (meaning only 5 meats without the salad bar) all you can eat special for $18.95 per person, served in the bar area and patio only. They offer the same special on Sat and Sun from noon to 5:00 as well, so you don't really have an excuse not to try this place.  \n\nMake sure Via Brasil is on your radar for your next special occasion. You won't be disappointed."

Yes, the price was $36/person, but it was worth every penny.\n\nEven though they gave us some broccoli, fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheese bread, I barely ate any of thee carbs, since I had to save room for the MEAT.\n\nI did make sure to save room for the salad bar, since it included salmon with a passion fruit sauce, salad, peppers, portobello mushrooms, marinated mushrooms, caprese salad, meats/cheeses, beef carpaccio, chicken salad, seafood salad, etc.  I ate just a few small selections from the salad bar, since I was all about the meat.\n\nOMG.  I was in heaven.  I tried anything and everything that was steak.  The Picahna (Top Sirloin) and Garlic Picahna were to die for.  So juicy and delicious.  They even had a different type of garlic steak, which was also good.  I also tried the Prime Rib, Lamb, and Flank Steak, but I mostly filled up on the Picahna and Garlic Picahna.  I'll admit, though, that the Flank Steak and Prime Rib were delicious, but my only objective was to eat Picahna. \n\nThey also had garlic bread that was almost immediately snatched up after the server came out from the kitchen.  It tasted like it was garlic sourdough bread.  Whatever it was, delicious.\n\nI didn't really want to bother eating the Pineapple and Ham, Ribs, Pork, Chicken, or Sausage, so I really can't comment on those.  By the time that the Salmon was brought out, I was just too stuffed.  Next time.  \n\nI also saved some room for dessert, since I saw a couple of ladies pushing around a dessert cart (even though it was a little extra, it was worth it).  It was all over for me once I saw that they had tiramisu (among other things)...I just felt like they were taunting me with their dessert selection, since it seemed that they were pushing the cart around in front of me while I was enjoying my meat.  I did, however, have the tiramisu, and it was worth the wait/saved space.\n\nThe wait staff was great, although we did quite a bit of waiting before they refilled my water and before they brought out the check.  They did come by quite a few times to ask if we wanted more wine, though.  \n\nI'll admit that when they came around, the staff was quite attentive.\n\nWe also received a $20 gift card to be used toward dinner.  \n\nI would've probably given them 5 stars, except for the few gripes that I had about the service.\n\nI can't wait to come back."

It was quaint, only about 30 people but we were all well tooken care of. Anna was amazing and helpful from the very beginning and was extremely accomodating towards our every need. Anna let us bring in decorations from the night before the event and said they would set up for us the day of the wedding as long as we explained how we wanted everything set up, so we didnt have to stress over it because it is \"your special day\" as she said. They also have hookups for audio/video from a laptop for music etc plus decorative lighting for the walls. All the waiters and bussers were on top of their game that night especially Felipe. He constantly asked if we missed any of the meats or needed more sides. We had a two hour open bar and he definitely made sure we had enough to drink. Even though I had a drink already he let me know the open bar was about to end and if I wanted another Long Island, im in Vegas so how could I say no to free liqour? The bartender also made sure the drinks were nice and stiff. I will recommend this place to anyone in Vegas and will be back in the near future! Hats off to the staff, your service will not be forgotten."

It was more average than anything compared to their major competitors.  The pros were the shrimp, salmon, side dishes.  I also liked the spaciousness of the restaurant and the tables not being too close together.  \n\nThe meats were okay but nothing special. My lamb chops were very small and very over done. The salad bar was also pretty small compared to the other places.\n\nI found the constant upselling and pressure to buy drinks and dessert a little annoying.  It was okay at first but then became constant.  The assistant waiter and support staff was very good.  The speed of service was very good also.  I'm not sure I'd go back and have mixed feeling about this place."

            "review": "I was recently having a conversation with some people about this place. For some reason, we were also talking about Groupons. I said that if a Groupon ever came up for Via Brasil, I'm jumping on it. Lo and behold, a Groupon appears days later. It was a sign.\n\nI'm pretty sure Via Brasil takes up the space that was formerly (and quite briefly) a Makino's. It's a nice, large, and elegantly decorated restaurant. As soon as you step inside, you know you're in for a culinary treat.\n\nAfter you're seated, they explain the red/green system - green of course meaning that you're ready for meat! My card stayed green for most of the night. To put it succinctly, Via Brasil serves up some of the most amazing cuts of meat I've ever eaten. Sure there were some items that weren't quite up to par, but most of it was absolutely awesome. To be honest, it's all quite a blur. They just kept coming and coming and coming. And I just kept saying yes yes yes!\n\nSurprisingly, I didn't enjoy the bacon-wrapped tenderloin that much. It was the weirdest and most unexpected thing. I actually thought the bacon got in the way of the flavor! On the other end of the spectrum, the last cut I received was some sort of garlic-infused meat. Looking at their web site, I think it is the \"Noble Cut of Picanha in Garlic.\" Wow. I was full by that point, but that didn't stop me from getting a second cut. It was the perfect ending.\n\nIf I ever go back, I think I know what strategy I would employ. I noticed that the cuts of meat I enjoyed most were light and very much on the rare side. The cuts I didn't enjoy as much tended to be dense, which caused them to be not as tender and way more filling.\n\nOh I should mention the salad bar. You might think one would ignore it. The reality is, you need something on your plate to balance out that meat. It's really much more than just a salad bar and the choices are mostly delicious, but definitely use that only as a complement to the meat. You are here for the meat!\n\nOne thing I didn't realize is that dessert is not included. I couldn't resist getting some of their Tiramisu. It was pretty good, but not sure it was worth the extra $8. I know it's a silly thing to mention since the Rodizio meal is $43, but it's good to know.\n\nOK this is long enough. Way too long. FOUR STARS!"

            "review": "I have come to this restaurant many times, and I have seen it go from barely ok, to good, to great... and it may now be sliding back down to just \"ok\" when it come to their service. And please don't get me wrong, I will be brutally honest in this review, but this is only with the intention of helping the leadership team at this restaurant identify some disappointing shortcomings I saw during my last visit. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, this restaurant has worked hard to become a really great churrasqueria in Las Vegas, but yesterday's visit left much to be desired. Let me explain. Hosting several family members for the holidays, I was torn as to what restaurant I could take them to so they could experience a \"wow\" dining experience, so I chose Via Brazil since they had previously earned my business with great service. In fact, Felipe (our usual waiter) is one of the friendliest and most welcoming waiter there.\n\nHaving said that, this visit was disastrous! It started with a long wait for meats to come to the table, then the waiters were slow, uninterested in serving us and borderline rude. For example, after trying to cut a piece of meat off the skewer onto my plate, a waiter spilled steak fat onto my shirt... No big deal as it was an accident. What really upset me was the waiter was completely unapologetic and only asked me if I wanted something to clean myself up with.  With an obvious YES as my response, he walked away for close to ten minutes and the sent a different waiter with a rag to clean up the mess. Really?! You spill food on a customer and this is your attitude?\n\nThe second disappointing mishap was their digital frequent diner program. I have been a member for a while but this time it seemed I annoyed the waiter when I asked him to credit me with the visit. In fact, he denied the free desert I had earned (despite there being no disclaimer on the promotion) and then proceeded to give my family members grief about using their frequent diner app because it was \"downloaded on the same day of the visit\". Are you telling me this restaurant spends money in a rewards program only to have its staff discourage diners from using it? That's a shame. \n\nLastly, here are some other turn offs from the visit: dirty coffee cups, table was not bussed throughout the visit and waiters' appearance, service standards and demeanor left much to be desired. \n\nPlease fix this!"

I really enjoyed the Caprese salad mmm yum and they have bottles of the best Olive oils around that you can use. My boyfriend really enjoyed the roasted peppers and eggplant. This is just listing a few as they have close to 35 items in their hot and cold gourmet salad bar!\n\nFresh omelet station, eggs benedict or eggs any style for your own creation made to order, and Belgium waffles made fresh as well!\n\nYou are given a rodizio marker for your table and when you want meat brought to your table you place it on the green side, and when you have had enough or are working on what you have then you flip it over to the red and they will not come to your table.\n\nMmmm yum they also give you a side of fresh mashed potatoes and some delicious fried bananas which were the best I have ever had in my life!!!!!!\n\nThey have a cart of fresh banana bread and another bread,  however once she said banana I knew I must have and did not hear what the other was. It was the best banana bread I have ever had the pleasure of eating! I had seconds on that for sure!\n\nThe brunch is rodizio style so there are 6 choices of meats coming around at all times to make the rounds to your table. They are generous and are constantly on the move making sure you are satisfied and have everything you need or could ever want! \n\nList of meats cut table side. Top sirloin, tenderloin wrapped in bacon, turkey wrapped in bacon, prime rib, chicken drumsticks, smoked ham and pineapple. Keep in mind this selection is only for brunch, their dinner service has closer to 16 meats. \n\nThe bacon wrapped turkey was an explosion of flavor all up in my mouth! The prime rib was delicious and melted in my mouth like butta!\n\nThe service was Amazing, everyone on staff catering to our every need, refills of iced tea galore, my glass never even had the chance to get half full at any point! \n\nThey cleared plates, brought plates, folded our napkins back up every time we left the table, they were on it! This restaurant for sure values and appreciates their customers!\n\nHeather was an Amazing Server by the way, her smile and sweet, helpful, knowledgeable personality was refreshing. If I owned a restaurant I would love to have her on my staff!\n\nThis was a real treat for my sweetie and I also was my first time for rodizio style meat service it sure was a winner!\n\nWe will be back because I know I will be dreaming about this place and be itching to get back really soon!\n\nThe best service ever in all of my dining experiences I swear! I told my boyfriend that I feel like a Queen totally treated like royalty in every way! They totally spoiled us with anything and everything, I am still Amazed and super happy with our experience. \n\nTop quality food and very tasty and creative!"

Not good for kids at all or picky eaters at that since the variety was limited. (Think alot of cheeses and weird pasta dishes...) I wouldn't come here again unless some else paid, and the desserts and drinks were extra. So a family of four (2 adults, 1 child and 1 free/infant), with drinks came to $160+ tip.

In fact, I think it's a very nice restaurant with very nice wait staff (including bussers, hostess, waiters, everyone!). On both of my visits I was pleased as punch with the service and the arrival of the meats/cheese bread/condiments/beverages. \n\nHowever, on my second visit some of the magic wore off from the first visit. I went here for a birthday dinner with my fiance. On a Saturday night I made a reservation, expecting the place to be busy, but it definitely was not. Kind of a plus for us, except for the fact they sat us out in the middle of the floor. I was kinda disappointed with the seating and hoping we could have been seated in a more secluded part of the restaurant, but it was okay...\n\nAs for food. The meats were okay, minus the salmon, which was delicious. I tend to skip the sausages and chicken-type meats when I come to a Brazilian steakhouse. I must say though, I think all of the meats were overly-salty. Cooked well? Yes. But just salty. I went through three glasses of water.\n\nThe salad bar I think is okay, but not as good as Texas de Brazil.\n\nOverall I'm saying it's an okay place. It is cheaper than Texas de Brazil. It is more intimate than Texas de Brazil. I enjoy the ambiance here. I wouldn't NOT reccomend Via Brasil, but it will probably be awhile before I go back."

But we still got pretty much the full, regular treatment.\n\nThe restaurant is really beautiful, and there is a long, but very narrow, outdoor patio.  Of course it was too cold to be eating outside, but I wonder how this would work with the Brazilian rodizio concept.  I imagine it would be more trouble than its worth.\n\nWe really liked the salad bar, with its huge assortment of items, most of them pretty tasty, and I tried very hard not to pig out.  But with such a vast assortment, even a minuscule tasting of everything adds up to a substantial portion.\n\nThe meats, though, left a lot to be desired.  The first one served to us was the turkey (or was it chicken?) wrapped in bacon.  It was so salty that I couldn't eat it, and it wasn't just the bacon;  I took that off, but the salt permeated all through the meat.  The rest of the meats were mostly tough, oversalted, and lacking any flavor, except for the beef ribs, which were really good.\n\nService was difficult; it was hard to get a waiter's attention, but this could be attributed to the group set-up.  I wouldn't downgrade the restaurant because of this, since it may not be totally valid.\n\nThis wasn't the first Brazilian rodizio restaurant we've been to, so we have others to compare it to.  It's fine for the money, and we'll likely come back.  But first we'll try some of the competition in town, which seems to be growing weekly!"

I probably don't have the stomach capacity for this place, but even though I had to skip a few of the selections, I cannot complain. Even the salad bar items were top notch and had more than just the typical carb fillers. I took small portions of mozzarella, mushrooms and roasted peppers as my sides and sampled a couple of the \"hot\" items like asparagus risotto and coconut chicken (both excellent).\n\nI tried most of the meats, bowing out at times because the service was almost too fast! I could barely keep up, having to temporarily flip my coaster to \"red\" to avoid plate overload. Everything I tried was tender, flavorful and served up hot and fresh from the skewer. Definitely bring your appetite and a lot of cash- this restaurant is not cheap. Bill for two, with tip, easily topped $100 AFTER the $50 Groupon certificate. Worth every dime. I wish I could have crammed down more than two bites of flan and a small Cappuccino for dessert. \n\nAtmosphere was chic and ambient and I cannot say a single negative thing about any of the staff. Nothing was \"over the top\", but it is definitely a nice place for an excellent meal.\n\nI have not tried any of the other Brazilian steakhouses in town, but I've been to a few on the East Coast- Via Brazil tops them all so far. Be sure to try a Passion fruit caipirinha- dang, that's a good drink. I only needed one, I assure you."

Gerry, our waiter even made a point to special order me some lamb chops....WOW!\n\nI cannot exactly tell which meat was my favorite...My wife said the Tri Tip was the best, but the chimichurri sauce made them all beyond words delicious.\n\nForget the other Brazillian Steakhouses and go here."

We had calamari, lobster bisque, asparagus lemon risotto, Brazilian cheese rolls, and a sampler of fried goodies including meatballs and shrimp empanadas. We also sampled red sangria, passion fruit mojito, caiphirina and wine. And topped it all off with chocolate mousse. \n\n$54 for 4 cocktails and loads of food with leftovers to take home. Everything was delish. The fried items were slightly indistinguishable from one another but tasty nonetheless. Calamari was cooked perfectly with two yummy dipping sauces. Bisque was salty, rich and dreamy. The cheese rolls are especially delightful soaked in the aforementioned bisque. Chocolate mousse was rich and creamy. \n\nWe had a lovely cushioned sofa and table on the patio. The service was great. Very friendly and over attentive. \n\nWe will definitely be back, and soon!"

            "review": "It's sad but I have to knock off a couple of stars for Via Brasil.  First, they would not take my groupon, claiming that the Sunday before Valentine's Day was a holiday.  If they are going to have liberal interpretations of holidays, they need to put the exact dates on the groupon.  It's not like the groupon lasts forever, like restaurant.com certificates do.  Just figure out the dates for the period that the groupon is valid and put them on there.  Voila, problem solved.  In addition, they had the server give us the bad news.  The manager needs to step up and deal with those things, not leave it to the poor server.  I contacted Groupon and, fortunately, they gave me my money back.  Groupon is so nice about stuff like that.\n\nSecond, the service this time was slow and strange.  It took a while for our server to notice that we were out of drinks.  Meanwhile, the same guy kept coming by over and over and over again with lamb chops even though we had refused over and over and over again.  He was seriously acting like a zombie.  A zombie with lamb chops on a very sharp metal stick.\n\nThird, at the end of this month they are adding an all-you-can-eat pasta option for $22.95.  I think this automatically makes this place less classy.  It also shows me that they are getting a little greedy because the food cost for pasta is so low.  It's going to be like a pricey Olive Garden with people running around with sharp metal sticks with meat on them.  Plus, if the servers can't handle drinks consistently, I'm not sure they can handle AYCE pasta.  Unless the pasta comes on sticks.  :) \n\nOn the positive side, the salmon, which is served from a cart, was excellent.  Nicely cooked with a tasty mango sauce.  The man serving the salmon was really enthusiastic and nice.  He even remembered when he came back a second time that we had already had the salmon and appropriately asked if we'd like some more.  Also, the woman operating the dessert cart was super nice and helpful.\n\nI'm bummed that I had a mediocre experience after so many good ones.  Via Brasil, I think we need some time apart to work things out.  Hopefully time heals all wounds."

You're better off going to Samba or Fogo de Chao where the service and food exceed Via Brasil's by far. This awful and regretful experience began as follows (this is a short version of what happened as I've omitted several other problems we experienced).  I had a fairly large party bringing in a fair amount of business into this unprofessional establishment.  When it came time to pay for the check, methods of payment were provided.  The waitress came back to my table and hand selected her choice of credit cards (neglecting the ones she didn't want to use) and OVERCHARGED each card by over $60 per card which EXCEEDED the check amount.  When I asked why she conducted the transaction this way she simply said, \"that's just what I was told.\" I immediately asked her to correct the charges and provide correction for the wrong doing.  She came back twice still charging credit cards incorrectly.  To make matters worse, the manager lied and ended up charging me an unauthorized deposit.  The manager said the money would be placed back onto my credit card in 24 hours.  To this day, the money has yet to be refunded AND they charged an amount different from what was said would be charged.  The manager was rude, unprofessional and incompetent. She clearly doesn't know how to correct her wrongdoings so  she unprofessionally rushed my party out the door. This was by far the worse dining experience I've ever had.  If I were to rate this negative stars I would.  I highly advise anyone who is thinking of going to Via Brasil to avoid it and spend your money elsewhere. I would also urge the owner to fire the current manager who was present during our dining experience and hire a manager who is capable of handling and conducting him/herself in a professional and intelligent manner."

Lobster bisque is a must and my favorite cut of meat would be the picanha (sirloin). I could come here to just eat just those two items and will be more then satisfied. Finishing off with a Midori infused lemon zest ice cream was just overwhelming of lemon zest. Flavor is there but I would not recommend this unless you like eating lemon rind. Why I dropped two stars was because they were out of spinach and hubby saved room for dessert and the dessert he ordered was 86.

            "review": "Superb service and mouthwatering choice meats at Via Brasil Steakhouse! I have been here several times. The restaurant is always clean and beautifully adorned with plants. The bar is located near windows with a great view. They have tables that are privately located for special occasions or centrally located near others and the cold bar. The cold bar is kept fresh and immaculate. The presentation is artistic - the chef's definitely take pride in their work!\n\nI absolutely love their daily gazpacho. It is usually served in a small shot glass as a sweet sampling as they are generally made with a fresh seasonal fruit like cantaloupe or watermelon. I generally ask for a teacup to be sent to me tableside, so I can enjoy a bit more without taking five or more shot glasses. The cold bar has a hot section as well where they serve some seafood pastas and seafood soups. Their hot soups are very tasty. I don't partake in the pasta dishes since I am there for choice meats. \n\nI love the system typical of all local Brazilian restaurants that allows servers to know when you are ready for more meat. A circular color-coded yes/no card indicates when food should be offered or when servers should bypass the table. This allows the guest time to eat some of what they have before going back for more or from being bothered when full or not ready. It also allows the service to flow throughout the restaurant as serving staff carries choice meats that are hot and sometimes heavy.\n\nThe choice meats are broken into two categories of prices. There is something close to six select meats on the higher priced selection than the lower one. The price difference is $10.00, and it is worth the experience. Prior to service of meats, you can select from sauces and sides you'll want with your meal, and these are unlimited. I usually order saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and the plantains. These are great choices.\n\nI love the lamb chops, salmon, shrimp, and filet. They are my favorites! My favorites require more of the server's attention because most of these are not usually items that just make the rounds randomly. The lamb is cooked to order, so when you are ready, they will make it. The salmon is also typically not out often because it gets cold quick and is served on a wooden fire plate for flavor with a sweet sauce that makes it like a finishing selection to lead into dessert. I usually get the salmon last for that reason. The shrimp come out on a sizzling hot plate. The filet is well... a well seasoned choice meat. Although it is not meat, one item that is served is fresh hot mozzarella! I can be absolutely full and have a least two of these! This is a must try! \n\nWhat stands out among the other Brazilian restaurants in town are the service standards. The restaurant expectation is that any guest that gets up from his/her seat should come back to a folded napkin and their seat pushed back in if left out. I love the concept of dining and being treated like a valued guest. I wish more restaurants invested time in winning my patronage. Additionally, there is a managerially presents that is not obtrusive to guests. They use hand signals and eye contact to keep watch on staff and draw attention to details. This is excellent training because when a guest motions, the servers are more observant. I have dined in restaurants were eye contact and body language was ignored due to ignorant waiting staff, foreign customs, or poor training. This prompts guests to get out of their seat or call out in a restaurant - tacky.\n\nMy favorite server is Fidel. I usually ask for him when I visit. Although all the servers in this restaurant work seamlessly together, Fidel stands out among the rest. When I ask for something like my lamb chops, he puts that order in and checks back with me as to when I can expect them. When I am done, he asks if I want more. When I tell him I am ready for my Salmon, he goes to the kitchen for that as well. He makes sure my water is never less than half-full, he pushes and pulls my chair out when I get up or sit down, and he never seems to act as though he is rushed or bothered. He never makes me feel like I am eating the entire restaurant out of their lamb chops or shrimp. He truly makes me feel like I am his only guest. \n\nDefinitely come to this restaurant hungry! Five-stars well deserved."

My faves were the beef ribs, garlic top sirloin and filet wrapped in bacon. I love the option to choose your sides, too (yucca fries were great). They also had servers going around with some type of baked mozzarella and hot garlic bread. \n\nThe only thing that bothered me early on was the GM (the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars).I received a buy one get one free email for being part of the e-club. I gave my email when making the reservations. Apparently they wrote the email address incorrectly but the GM approached us at our table (as we were barely starting to eat our salads) accusing me of using someone else's coupon because my email wasn't in their database. I repeated my email address to make sure he had the right one but he didn't bother listening or double checking. So I said I can show the email on my phone and he immediately said I probably had someone forward it to me. After showing the email on my phone which was obviously sent to me directly, he realized they wrote the email wrong. He didn't really apologize for his mistake nor his approach. It made us feel uncomfortable but we chose to ignore it so we could enjoy our meal. Other than that, all the servers and front staff were very friendly. A sincere apology from the GM would have been nice."

The variety of food and the taste was outstanding, even though it is not the main reason for visiting Via Brasil, it was a nice treat and helps break up the all-meat-fest.\n\nI enjoyed almost all the BBQ meats that was served by the waiter. But I really like the sausage, the lamb, chicken hearts (not on the menu, but you can ask for it, as it is one of the things served in this kind of restaurant in Brazil). I didn't care for the baked salmon, even though the passion fruit sauce that was served with it was good).  But you should definitely pace yourself and try everything and find out what you like and ask for more if you still have room in your tummy.\n\nThe servers were all very friendly as they make their round with whatever they bring out from the kitchen and identifying what it is so you don't have to guess. \n\nIf you have room for dessert after your meal, they have a dessert cart to help visually entice you for some after meal sweets.  I tried their Coconut Flan, and thought it was good.  I liked the creamy richness and the coconut flavor.\n\nAs a nice restaurant in Summerlin, they probably should have more customers, but when I went they weren't too busy.  So making a same day reservation just hours ahead was not an issue for me.  I spoke to the manager and he told me they were getting more business with the Groupon promotion (and they just recently ran another Groupon offer) so the strategy is working.\n\nAnyway, because of the awesome service from the waiter to the manger, and the good food I will definitely be back.  And having more Groupon to use will keep my tummy and wallet on my future visits. \n\nDecor: 5/5  The self-serve salad bar was nicely decorated and kept clean.  The restaurant was sophisticatedly (is that a word?) decorated.\nFood: 4/5  Overall I am very pleased with it.  \nService:  5/5  Servers were friendly.  The manager that made the rounds and speaking to the guests was genuinely friendly.\nLocation:  Great for locals living in the SW, but will be too far of a trip if coming from the Strip via a cab.\nPrice: 4/5  Definitely take advantage of Groupon or other offers when available.\nAmbiance: 5/5  Very classy and upscale, yet very relaxing as well."

As soon as we enter we were kindly greeted by the hostess and taken to our table. Then as soon as we sat down the waiter was already filling our water glasses and welcoming us. We then made our way to the appetizer bar which is full of tons of different appetizers, soups, and salads. My favorite from the appetizer bar was the chicken marsala and the lobster bisque. Once, we were ready for meats they brought out so many different flavorful meats and all of them were exceptional ! Once we were so stuffed from all the food, they brought us out cheesecake with a candle in it and sang happy birthday. By far the best birthday dinner that I have been to.

Anna Gomes, the Event Manager, is truly a dream to work with. Weddings are hard anyway, and it was even more complicated that I was planning from Chicago. But Anna was always very prompt and patient in responding to my barrage of emails. \n\nWhen I was heading to Vegas for my bachelorette party a few months before my wedding, she made time to personally meet with me and give me a tour of the restaurant. I took a huge leap of faith and booked this place without seeing it. From the pictures on Yelp and Facebook, I was pretty sure I knew what I was getting myself into, but there was always a nagging fear in the back of my mind that I had fallen for good advertising. Especially because the price was so cheap, I was worried that the restaurant would be cheap looking. Well, when I finally saw the venue, I was BLOWN AWAY by how beautiful it was. The pictures absolutely do no do it justice. The place is very elegant inside. I especially love the giant waterfall! \n\nThe day of, everything was set up exactly how I had requested it, down to the color of the lights. Anything I asked for was immediately put into place. For example, I asked the guestbook table to be moved three different times (small bridezilla moment, I guess) and it was done immediately and without complaint each time. During the meal, my father mentioned to Anna that my sisters hadn't gotten the chance to try to filet mignon yet, so Anna personally went to the kitchen to find the servers with the filet mignon and led them to my sisters' table. Amazing! \n\nThe food was incredible. My husband spent a couple years in Brazil and is very particular about Brazilian barbecue, and he was blown away by the quality of the meat and flavor. We all were! It was such a great dinner. The servers were constantly making their rounds, everyone ate until they were very satisfied. Dessert was delicious too! \n\nThis is the perfect atmosphere for a wedding, people still can't stop telling me what a fun wedding it was! And the price was absolutely unbeatable. You only pay for food, there is no additional cost for reserving the rooms. Based on that, you would think they would try to hurry you along or squeeze you into a smaller space so there would be more room for restaurant guests, but that was absolutely not the case. The number of guests I had could have fit into the large party room, but Anna was worried it would be a tight fit, so she also gave us the adjoining space, for no additional cost! I truly felt like her main goal was to make sure I had a wonderful time. Take it from a bride on a budget, there is no better deal for a wedding. My husband said we can go back to celebrate our anniversary in Vegas and we'll definitely have our celebration anniversary dinner here. I can't wait!"

I can not say the food was bad but for the price should have been much better. The prime rib, top sirloin and flank steak were all the same tough. The staff was the only part of the evening that was good. Very attentive and helpful. If this place was only $20 instead of $43 I would consider going back. For the little extra I will stick with Texas de Brazil."

We waited 45 minutes past our reservation.  We got a bunch of excuses as to why we were not being sat. Anna was rude and obviously overwhelmed with taking care of a large crowd.  She may want to apply at McDonald's. She is definitely out of her league here.  Was a shame. Was looking forward to eating here since we read other reviews about the food.

I would like if the cuts of beef were in rotation more or equal to the other meats (turkey, chicken, etc.) The lighting and mood is very dark but still has a nice feel. This is definitely the place, I feel for a more casual and slower paced dinner vs the hustle and bustle of some other restaraunts. I have also attended the Sunday morning brunch, surprisingly that was much more busy -- make reservations!!! The Waffle and omelet station was tucked at the end of the cold buffet, one lone cook with a Waffle iron a few topping and a pan for the omelets. As busy as it was there should have been more people to help, the guy at the table next to us eventually cancelled his order because it took way too long. All in all this place isn't on the top of my list but it's not too bad."

I've been to approx 5 different churrascaria restaurants in 3 different cities, but this is by far the best. I love everything here, especially lamb, garlic sirloin, fish (salmon), fried banana, risotto, and caramel flan. This place does train their service stuff well. You may feel that someone is always watching you when you eat, but as soon as you finish eating, drop a fork, or empty the water glass, someone always come right away to accommodate your need. I asked the server if he's got any lamb, and even though there was only 4 of us in the restaurants that time, he went back to the kitchen and prepare one just for us. Managers are also very friendly. Ambience here is sophisticated... subtle Brazilian music, spacious floor plans, contemporary objects, perfect for someone's birthday party or dinner date. I'd love to come back soon, but first I have to digest the food first."

Our party of 14 people were charged 200$ per card without our consent when it should have been 126.00. The manager wasn't apologetic at all she kept sending her server out to deal with us. After messing up the bill not once but twice they still over charged my sister. They placed a 70$ deposit which was promised to be returned to her account which never happened and completely overcharged her by $275. After over an hour of waiting for the corrections to be made on our cards the manager finally made her way out and blamed her own server for charging everyone incorrectly. It was down right inconsiderate and poorly ran, you would think they would comp a meal or take something off however a thing.\n\nWhen calling back a day later to have them correct the charge the host said there were busy and couldn't take our call. They are also RACIST, when calling back a 3rd time the person who picked up referred to our party as the \"big black polynesian family\" and was so rude.\n\nStill a week later and nothing has been credited back to my sisters account. We will continue with legal actions and report this restaurant to the better business bureau. No one should have to be deal with such ignorant people and be charged for the incorrect bill."

At $45.99 per person I would rather give my money to Texas de Brazil any day. That being said the service was excellent but some of the meat either wasn't cooked enough, cooked too much, or actually tasted good. It was just intermittent on the food front. I'm not a salad eater so I can't comment much on the salad bar but that I tried some meats and cheeses that were ok. A lady came around with a alcohol cart and a man then came around with a dessert cart but I don't drink much and was too full for dessert it looked good though.

Large, not too sweet, lightly crisp and not soggy.\n              - French Fries/Onion Rings/Asparagus by request only.\n       - Beef Ribs - So meaty, they cut you a piece off the bone. It's perfectly seasoned and is the only meat I had thirds of. It has just enough fat to melt in your mouth. \n       - Top Sirloin - My second favorite meat. However, the edge slices do tend to be a little salty. The inside slices are just right.\n       - Prime Rib - Very moist. One of the juiciest pieces of meat I've ever had. No homo.\n       - Grilled Salmon with Orange Creme Sauce - I usually hate cooked salmon, but the orange creme sauce was delicious. It must of been made with fresh oranges because it tasted like freshly squeezed orange juice, but as a creme.\n       - Flank Steak - Juicy, but a little bland next to the other meats. \n       - Garlic Steak - Same as the flank, but with a garlic flavor.\n       - Pork Tenderloin with Parmesan cheese - Thin layer of fried cheese around a normally bland meat. It was definitely something I didn't mind trying. \n       - Sausage\n       - Beef Tenderloin and Turkey, both wrapped in Bacon - Mostly just tasted like bacon.\n       - Leg of Lamb - A little dry, but it could of just been the piece I got.\n       - Chicken drumstick\n**Recommendations**\n       - I would definitely recommend this place for a nice evening out or a special occasion. The price is a bit steep, but you're paying for food and an experience."

So the owner called undercover mystery diners to find out.  I could not hold my curiosity and visited the restaurant with my wife for dinner. This is an upscale Brazilian steak house where they bring in various types of meats to your table and you serve the side orders from a buffet like table.  Environment is trendy, upscale, food pretty good.  You can get different cuts of beef, pork, chicken, sausages and even lamb.  You have full bar and service is good. I recommend you get reservation during weekends but wait time is not bad either.  Price is typical at par with other Brazilian steak house not wickedly expensive and not cheap either.  This is a good place for romantic dinners and with family or friends.  I strongly recommend this restaurant."

The salad bar was pretty good, but the meats were strictly \"meh.\"  So many of the non-red meats were super salty.  \nYesterday we went for the Sunday brunch because we had an offer for a free pitcher of bloody marys or mimosas.  We ordered the bloody marys and they were delicious.    There are fewer choices of meats for the brunch, but all of them were very tasty and fresh.  My favorites were the top sirloin and the prime rib.  For sides we were served fried plantains and some very bland mashed potatoes.  I guess for the brunch you don't get to choose sides.  The salad bar was very nice.  They had caprese salad, which is always a plus for me.  Also, the caesar dressing was very good!  To start the meal you are offered your choice of cheese rolls, banana bread or zucchini bread.  We got a basket of cheese rolls and munched on them throughout the meal.  \nMy biggest complaint is that there was no dessert included in the brunch.  I didn't have a lot of room left, but it is always nice to finish off a good meal with a little something sweet, imo.  We had zucchini bread and banana bread for dessert, but they didn't quite do the trick."

The salad bar was fresh and the lobster bisque was ok, if a little flat.  But we don't come here for the salad, so I turned my card up and said bring on the meat.  The favorites were the pork loin (surprisingly tender and flavorful), the lamb, the pork ribs, and the fillet wrapped in bacon.  The fails were the chicken and turkey which were dry and appeared overcooked.  Also the salmon was bland.  The rest of the meats included beef ribs, sirloin, strip steak, and sausage.  \n\nThey come around often and mostly ignore the button, asking you anyway.  The sides are not very good and you don't really need them as your salad bar should give you the illusion of eating something healthy.  Pace yourself and don't be afraid to say no or come back later.\n\nOf note: Kids are 14.99.  Happy Hour is 5-8 pm daily and includes a selection of appetizers and drink specials.

Food coma notwithstanding I am so glad we did.\n The food was perfect and nicely timed, we never felt rushed and the staff was some of the best I have ever seen. I like rare meat ( ok stop making faces!) Our waiter figured that out pretty fast and started bringing me the nicest meat on a stick to taste ;)   My absolute favorite was the flank steak!\nOne little snafu misunderstanding about the Yelp check in if it was for a desert each or only one per table (how we even decided to try desert after all that deliciousness!) and they took both off the ticket. \nAbsolute great place and will definitely find another reason to go there again!"

I've eaten at a place similar to this on the Strip called Pampas Brazilian Grill in Planet Hollywood but Via Brasil is so much better! They have more buffet options here like: Seafood Salad, Mushroom Ravioli, Asparagus Risotto, Tabbouleh just to name a few. They also bring warm side dishes to your table like fried Plantains, fried Yucca root ..(tastes just like a french fry..it tastes like it's good for you too), broccoli, and mashed potatoes. They also bring out their warm rolls that taste like soft warm Cheez It's ..those are addicting! You must keep control of yourself or you will be too full to taste their wide array of meat that they bring to your table. Some of my favorite meats were the sirloin, prime rib and I don't usually say this but the lamb was very tasty! The Pineapple Sangria that I had with the meal just enhanced all the flavors in the food. This was so worth it!"

Rice better at Via.\nCaipirhina - Via wins for smoothness of this classic drink from Brazil.\nCheese bread - Fogo gets the nod for lighter and fluffier dough.\nMeat - tie. You will prefer some cuts at one locale over another but it's a wash in the end\nSide dishes - Fogo wins here. Via has no fried polenta and their fried bananas pale in comparison to the maduros at Fogo.\nDesserts - too full, couldn't eat any at Via.\n\nBottom line: Fogo is still the standard but you will not be disappointed by Via and I wouldn't hesitate to go to Via again. Luv that Brazilian churrascaria."

My favs were the turkey wrapped in bacon and the filet wrapped in bacon. There's 16 different things that they bring around. I got to try 14 out of the 16. Didn't get a chance to taste the chicken breast and the salmon. But trust me, our stomachs weren't missing the last 2 items. It was pretty much at max capacity about 15 minutes BEFORE we stopped eating!\n\nYou also have access to a salad bar that includes items with shrimp and lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was a bit watery to my liking, but I can't complain since it's free! At the beginning of your meal, you also get bread cheese balls (YUM!) and brocolli and mashed potatoes. I would recommend eating only 1 cheeseball and skipping the veggies. You will thank me for it later when your stomach is maxed out and you've only tried 10 of the 16 meats :)\n\nDid I mention that they have IMPECABBLE service? Everyone from the sommelier, the water boy, the waiters, and the roving meat holders were incredibly attentive and accomodating. And it's not like we were high rollers either. We were your regular run of the mill folks. But they treated us just like we were VIPs.\n\nWe will be making a visit out here on every single Vegas trip!!!"

Now if it was jack in the box, I would totally get it.\n\nFurthermore, no manager came to ask us as to how we were doing? Or offer some compensation or apology for being out of the main menu dishes. Let me remind you, it was a party of 4 with drinks totaling more than $250 plus tip.\n\nNo effort was made to apologize for not having the menu items in stock. Now, if they were charging $20 a plate, they would have got 5 stars. \nBut for $50 a plate, I expect better service. I do understand that things go wrong, however, no effort was ever made to correct it.\n\nWe had no interactions with the manager whatsoever.\n\nShrimp was never served until begged for."

Along with Fogo de chao, this salad bar is quite possibly the best in town. The meat...now, I am not a connoisseur of steak, but I could tell a difference in not only quality of the meat, but also the taste from other Brazilian steakhouses. The overall quality of the meat seemed lower than at other places; I felt it to be quite rough, even though I asked for medium cooked slices. By comparison, fogo, and even Fleming's, was very tender. It was okay at best in terms of quality. In terms of taste, I found the ribeye (sniffle) to be salty! The RIBEYE! I literally had to spit it out, it was that bad. The lamb was salty as well and it irritated me. The New York strip steak and filet mignon were dry...VERY dry. This saddened me even further :(\n\nHowever, the top sirloin was amazing, I could eat that all day...\n\nAll in all, via is a good place to eat... But for the price, I don't think it's worth it; for $50+, fogo is the better choice."

That is about enough time to  forget about my last meat hangover and prepare myself  for the next meat hangover.  I always have this dooming feeling that this place is going to shut down, because it was unprofitable due to me and my husband eating atleast 5 lbs of meat, EACH!\n\nDespite being somewhat buffetish, I think the quality remains high and consistent. Frankly, I am very discriminant about what I eat from the \"buffet bar\", while it show freshness, chose wisely, most of it is just filler and distraction from the more expensive meat.  I do eat the beef or salmon carpaccio and sample the soup and hot appetizers... all decent.  However, a little plate of roughage doesn't hurt and can be a welcoming break from the continuous onslaught of hot sizzling meat coming your way.  The meat and variety is awesome especially if you desire red meats. \n\nI notice a few cost saving changes that I think make total sense.  The table side, side dishes are smaller portions but still you can order as many as you want and I am pretty sure if you finish and want more,  they will bring you more.  Shrimp cocktail at the buffet is composed of small shrimps, where as before they were large ones.  Now the large shrimp come tableside, which are brushed with a delicious garlic sauce.  I didn't see much of a raw seafood selection anymore. \n\nService was \"good\" this time, but in the dozen and half  times I've been here, I've never had less that good service and more often than not it has been excellent and cordial.\n\nP.S.  read the fine print. if you have the recent Groupon offer, be aware it is more like buy one meal at full price get one half off.   If there are two of you, you cannot use two coupons, but you can use two coupon If you have four people.\n\nJust go and enjoy."

The first time we went all out with the boys and it was amazing, we even had a vegetarian with us and he loved it. The meat was perfect the waiters were attentive and very friendly and best of all the drinks were made perfectly. There side dishes are superb and you should definitely order them. The fried bananas are damn good. \n\nThe second time with the couples I noticed the same staff was still employed. A very good sing in my opinion. The food again was spectacular and we enjoyed our meal with some excellent wine. We have a Brazilian BBQ in Palo Alto, Pampas, but it's more expensive and not nearly as good as Via Brasil. This place is reason enough to go to Vegas.\n\nOh and it's not overpriced at all. Not for the food and service you receive."

They are Brazilian cheese buns dusted with parmesan cheese.  There were excellent!\n\nI started with the salad bar and took items sparingly.  I tried the cold, sliced portabello muchrooms, one tomato caprese, asparagus risotto, two small artichoke heart halves, and two large shrimps and a piece of fish from their hot seafood mixture.  This was the extent of my salad bar foray as I didn't want to fill up on salad.  It would be a great dinner in itself.\n\nI turned the coaster to the green side meaning bring on the meat.  Before they started that, a waiter brought three dishes to the table - one with 3 fried plantains, another with mashed potatoes, and a third with green beans with garlic.  These were my vegetables to go with my meat.  A lot of food to accompany a lot of food.\n\nI didn't try all the meats as I was filling up before they had a chance to bring everything to my table.  I liked the small sausage, the first meat I tasted and it was excellent.  Beautiful seasoning.  Then I had two thin slices of rare prime rib which was excellent also.  I had both the chicken breast wrapped in bacon and the tenderloin wrapped in bacon.  Both were very good.  The seasonings were perfect.  I am a salt user extraordinaire, but I salted nothing except the mashed potatoes and green beans.  I had the garlic picanha (top sirloin) and it was superb!!  I also had one slice of beef rib which is sliced from a rack of rib (large--not baby back) and served on a separate small plate. \n\nSince there were only two tables occupied in the restaurant, there weren't several guys walking around distributing meat like rodizio restaurants.  Two guys were tasked with the serving.  I didn't get the pork loin and I forgot Tony's mentioning of chicken hearts--damn, damn, damn.  Well, something to look forward to next time.\n\nAfter all this, I did hold back so I could try some dessert.  I had a slice of peanut butter, chocolate chip cheesecake.  Oh yeah--great!\n\nService was impecable.  My iced tea was refilled often, staff was always around to answer questions or see if you needed something.  I was greeted at the door by a delightful young lady and she also bid me a kind, smiling farewell!\n\nThe place is very nicely done.  I love the wine rack that goes almost to the ceiling.  I could see the super ladder inside to extend and reach the highest shelves.\n\nThis is a great deal with a Groupon.  The Groupon was $21.  The regular price for the rodizio is $42.95.  I'm not sure I'd be back for the full price, but the Groupon certainly makes it a great deal.  Come on Groupon--let's get anohter Via Brasil.  And you know, I'll probably go back and pay the full price if one of my friends from out of town who loves rodizio comes to Las Vegas.  We'll go together!"

I praise Via Brazil to everyone I know saying how great the quality of meat and salad bar drinks and dessert. \nAlso, the facility is beautiful but the service is \"okay\" overall everyone is very nice but I was very disappointed the last time I was there.\nOn 11/7/14 (Friday night) I made reservations for my a birthday dinner for my boyfriend and his father... I called the day before making the reservation. Lets just say it was a process. I was put on hold for a moment after letting them know I needed to make a reservation, all fine and dandy right? A moment later a woman got on the phone with a very thick accent. As I was giving my information she could hardly understand what I was saying. I had to spell out every word. She started to get frustrated and I could tell so I asked if there was someone else I could talk to, she put me on hold without saying anything and another woman got on the phone. This lady spoke better English and the process sped up. Near the end of the conversation I let the second lady know that it was going to be a birthday celebration and specifically gave her the names of the two men. \nWe arrived there early so decided to have a seat at the bar before dinner. The bartender was very nice and told the boys happy birthday after I had mentioned it. (2nd person I told) \nThen we went to our table and the dinner was very good as usual. After dinner they bring around a display of desserts that you can choose from. I thought maybe you have to pick a dessert then they put in a candle or something. I then loudly announced \"birthday boys what would you like\" as the waiter was standing next to our table. I casually said maybe some cheesecake? The waiter left & we were waiting for the celebration, instead the waiter brought the check which in total we spent over $300 and told us to have a good night...\nAs you can see there was no birthday celebration, candle, song, or anything of that nature.. VERY DISSAPOINTING.\nWhen we were walking out my boyfriends mother and I approached the front desk person and let them know that we did not receive any birthday dedication and we were sadly disappointed seeing how I specifically made the reservations for this occasion and not to mention spend over 300 dollars!! \nShe then said \"im sorry, next time\"........\nNext time?? We did not make a scene or call the manager but I know now not to use this place for celebration. The customer service overall was rough and I thought for a higher end steakhouse we would get some type of acknowledgement."

They pay attention to fine details.  For example, they periodically bring you a clean plate to start over with when you have meat scraps littering your plate.  \n\nThe meat quality is excellent and the servers always tell you that if you aren't ready for a meat they have, they will be sure to bring it back around later.  Additionally, one person at my table wanted one last piece of filet at the end, and they fired up a fresh skewer of them, just for him.\n\nWe went without a reservation, which was refreshing.\n\nGO to this place!

However, the salad bar was lacking in everyway it lacked 90% of what texas de brasil had. period. It sucked to the 10th degree. Whats the deal with ordering the side dishes separately, why not just place it in the salad bar. Its management trying to control cost i believe or trying to make you feel your getting more than usual than other places. Lastly the WAITER was nice but the way they present the way you should eat was shocking. Here is what the head waiter said. i will paraphrase \" go ahead and eat the salad bar first and when you done i will bring another plate so you can start eating meat\" REALLY SERIOUSly ???U never want to say fill yourself with you pathetic salad bar and when your almost full then you can eat meat. WE WERE AMAZED AT THAT REMARK. I guess it came from management because you never say that to a customer. you should just simply say enjoy the salad bar and start eating all the meat you want. This place is a bit pretentious they should just keep it real and not try to be something better than \"the other guys\" because it was not."

With that said, I have been to other Brazilian places in town and this is probably the best.  It looks nice inside and the food quality is quite high.  The price, while \"high\" in a general sense, is pretty competitive within the Brazilian market.\n\nSo why not five stars?  To be sure my last visit was quite recent and quite good.  But, in the past, I have experienced some of the knocks others have noted.  Specifically, waiters that seem to walk right by my table while I sit there, sometimes for a long time, waiting for more meat.  Also - in the past I have also experienced a certain level of \"grief\" when trying to use a coupon that this place sent me!  If it's a problem, don't send it to me!  \n\nHopefully these things have been corrected, I did not experience them on my most recent visit I am glad to say, and I probably will be back in time.

My picky toddler loved the lobster bisque (she ate free). The meats started coming and maybe because it wasn't so busy it almost seemed like they were trying to get rid of the meat. As for the taste, some were nice while others were tasteless, too salty or very over/under cooked. Maybe we should've spoken up, but at that point- it didn't really matter. For the equivalent price of other establishments that provide the same service, I expected more. There was nothing really wrong...

And no, I am not going to pay for dessert after stuffing my face with 20 kinds of meat.\n- Salmon was okay but the passion fruit vinaigrette really brought a nice break to the meal\n- Bacon wrapped turkey was meh\n\nOverall, I think you should go here."

Via Brasil Steakhouse was not really impressive either, as I had a huge stomach ache after eating here, but not because of filling up so much.  \n\nA lot of the meat was fairly tough and mostly not that flavorful to me.  However I did like the beef ribs, as they were cut off the bone and delicious.  The salad bar is decent, but if you come to a Brazilian steakhouse for the salad, I would go to Texas de Brazil first.  There's more variety for about the same price.\n\nWhat makes this restaurant stand out however from other Brazilian steakhouses is the immense amount of sides you can order, which are all complimentary.  Normally, you get a few different sides and the rest is at the salad bar.  Here, there's tons including bananas, different vegetables, fries, and other potato fare.

We asked for a table for three. The restaurant was completely empty and had 3 tables seated. The hostess asked us to wait by the door for a few minutes to \"see if they had anything available.\" We were a bit taken back since the entire place was empty, but patiently waited. About 15 minutes went by and the hostess just stood there staring out into space and wouldn't sit us for some reason. \n\nIt was so frustrating that it seemed like they did not want our business. Being that we were so hungry we decided to just leave and drive 30 minutes to Texas de Brazil at Town Square. Totally worth it because they were super happy to help us and their service was phenomenal. \n\nI promised myself I wouldn't come back to this restaurant because I think customer service is the most important thing for me and this restaurant clearly needs to focus a little less time staring in to space and more time focussing on employee development and training."

My husband paid the extra $$ to get the \"best\" meat, of which he got none. Our waiter was amenable until my husband started asking where the chicken hearts and Leg of Lamb were, then he was conspicuously absent. After asking three different people for these items the manager showed up. Things went from bad to worse. He proceeded to make inane excuses and argue with my husband as to why the chicken hearts etc were not being served. About this time the \"leg of lamb\" appeared. Leg of lamb it was not. My husband knows leg of lamb. It got so ridiculous we ask for our check, with still no apology, and proceeded to leave. On the way out I stopped to get the name of the owner so I could complain. I noticed the girl was looking over my shoulder I turned in time to see the manager gesturing to her! He rushed over at this point and told me he was the owner and to take our business elsewhere! No problem $158 down the drain. If this gentleman was the owner I feel sorry for the employees and anyone who dares to venture into this ripoff, sorry excuse for a Brazilian Steakhouse. Would we return? NO!"

Anna did an amazing job coordinating with me and, as I live in Canada, it took a bit of time to get everything organized, but she was always patient and enthusiastic about our dinner.  We had about 30 people and we decided to go with the semi-private room.  The food was awesome and our waiter was on it and had a great attitude having to deal with so many people. In our group we also had a lot of people who had never been to this type of restaurant so it was a fun experience.  Having a buffet style dinner works really well for large groups but unfortunately many buffets are sub-par.  I read other positive reviews of Via Brasil and I must agree the food is awesome and you get value for the price.  Our party was staying at the JW Marriott down the road and Anna was able to organize a shuttle for us as well. Overall a great experience and once back in Las Vegas we will make sure to go again."

            "review": "So, my fellow yelpers - \n\nBoth my hubby and I have a tradition - since we both have b-days in September, we usually will just go out to a nice dinner to celebrate \"our\" days.\n\nHubby suggested this place, after doing some research, and also hearing the word from co-workers. So in being a yelper, I of course came to yelp to check the overall rating. Then I happened to see the word 'buffet' in the description, and instantly had this nail going down the chalkboard kind of sensation. Stomach kind of lost its appetite a little, and I held my breath about what this meant - but being a good trooper - said nothing and just went along for the ride, figuring I'd at least give it a shot before saying anything.\n\nSoooo, we pull into the plaza where this little gem is hidden, and I was taken back by the very fancy appearance of the building. And from the exterior looking in, I could see a little waterfall feature, so right away my mind was thinking - this is gonna be interesting!\n\nRight upon entering the hostess was very pleasant and very happy to chat it up with my little one in a full blown conversation about her markers! (mind you my little one was the one having to show it off to begin with, but i give kudos to the hostess for entertaining my little one's need for discussing her markers)\n\nOur hostess went and placed us right next to the waterfall, as my daughter kept talking about the waterfall behind the bar too, so we were very happy all around for seating.\n\nThen came the onslaught of attention - really - i mean talk about being pampered little pooches - you name it, there it was! (I have been to some top rated restaurants (names will remain anonymous - not into bashing anyone here), and the service rendered tonight seems to just put some of those other restaurants to shame!!!!) A gal could get used to this kind of pampering for EVERYTHING! Back to the subject - the service. Let's put it this way - short of having a personal massage at the table to throw me into utter 9th heaven, I was well on my way heading there!\n\nFor those who have never dined here: you are assigned a table 'captain', whose sole job is to make sure your service is being met for all needs. He will explain to you how things work for the food. You get two cardboard chips, one side says \"no meat\", the other \"more meat\". You flip the chip according to wether you want meat or not. If you don't want it - there is the 'salad bar' you can visit, to get your delight of heaven: sauteed mushrooms, grilled portabellos, shrimp ceviche, lobster bisque, varieties of risotto, salad, fine cheeses, bruschetta, beef carpaccio, and a few other items.\n\nSeriously though, service is impeccable. You drain your water cup, it is refilled before you know it (and sometimes without you even realizing it). Drop a napkin, a new one magically appears before you. If you even have a slightest bit of a question on your face, suddenly there is your 'captain' ready to assist you. These guys (and gals) are good! You finish your appetizer, they are ready to help clear your table to bring on your entree. \n\nIf you wish to feast on the meat side - well then just flip your chip to \"more meat\"! Then comes the never ending (unless you flip your chip) selection of meats! Prime Rib, Turkey, Sausage, Chicken, Lamb, Tri Tip, Sirloin. Here's a great part - you are given at your table setting a pair of tongs (originally thought it was for picking your own bread out of the basket, but nope was wrong), to help grasp the meat they are slicing for you off the oversized kabob sticks! (sorry best way to describe them). The meat is all roasted on large skewers in open flame, which is then brought from table to table, and you are served table side. All I can say is YUUUUUMMY!!!!\n\nOh and let's NOT forget the sides you can order as well!:\n\nGrilled Asparagus (hate to admit, but these guys were a little on the scrawny side, no where's close to what you would see in the grocery stores) - smeared in  olive oil mixed with garlic. Hmmm. yummy!\nFried Bananas - cinnamon, sugar, and something else all nicely fried up! I recommend this towards your dessert end.\nYucca Fries (pretty tasty! Never had it before, but I liked it!)\nThere was more for sure, but can't remember them all at this point. My brain is clouded with all the good eats I had!\n\nAnd juuuust when you think you can't stuff anything else into your bulging tummies - the DESSERT cart winds its way to you upon request! By this point my belly is bulging, my eyes are bulging, my brain is on heavenly overload, and yes I'm getting dessert by golly (special celebrations only come once a year!)!\n\nI dove for the chocolate cake. My daughter picked out the blueberry cheesecake. Neither of us regretted our choices! (ok hubby had no input cuz we felt 2 deserts was best, and our little one was already pining for her blueberries (thanks to Dora the Explorer).) Trust me, YUMMMMMM. Yelp is telling me I'm out of space (NEED MORE SPACE DARNIT!!!) P.S. Kids under 5 are FREE! :)"

There were a number of made to order sides too - we tried the asparagus, mushrooms, plantains, broccoli, fries, mashed potatoes and everything was very nicely cooked and seasoned. We ordered a bottle of wine to go with dinner - their selection was large, and the prices ran the gamut from inexpensive to crazy! The meat was, as I mentioned, amazeballs. We tried just about everything, and they were awesome about serving well done meat to my daughter and I and medium well and my son and hubby. Our favorites were Tri tip, New York strip and the lamb.

We finally gave up and set our credit card on the table.

One of our friends ordered the chicken skewer appetizer and it was severely undercooked.  It came out half pink and white with pink juice dripping off the chicken.  Our friend thought the pink juice was from the sauce so she took a bite.  She tried chewing it but she ended up spitting it out cause she said there was something hard in the chicken making it inedible.  So she took another bite but ended up not being able to chew that piece either as she then realized it was still raw.  We flagged down the server who was beyond busy trying to accomodate our entire paint night group of around 40 guests by herself, which was ridiculous.  The server was notified and took the undercooked chicken back and our friend ordered some more bacon wrapped shrimp and fries which were both good but took quite awhile to get as was our drinks.  I ordered a white wine sangria, which was pretty good but took about 20 mins to get.  At the end of our paint night event the server brought us our bills and failed to take off the undercooked chicken skewer.  We brought it to her attention and she said \"oh, you wanted that off your bill?\"....Uh YES since it was RAW & inedible!  So she said she would check with her manager.  She comes back with another server and let us know that the manager could not take it off since some of it had been eaten.  We all stood there dumb founded and informed her that two bites were taken however both bites had been spit out since they were raw.  Our friend then asks to speak w/ the manager.  The other gal that was w/ our server comes back and informs us that she was able to get the manager \"to bend\" and was able to get it removed from the bill.  WTF...\"to bend\" to remove undercooked chicken that was inedible!!!  First off this entire experience was rather poor to begin with.  Clearly they were understaffed and management should know better than to have one server handle almost 40 guests by herself w/ one busser, hence the reason my freaking sangria took 20 mins to bring out.  Additionally the manager should've come out and apologize personally for the undercooked chicken, thats a health hazard & just plain nasty.  And lastly, the servers need to bring out itemized bills to all their guests, as we were all given just the credit card signature receipt only.  I had to ask for an itemized receipt.  Perhaps this business should invest in hiring qualified management instead of cutting corners by inadequately staffing the restaurant during peak times resulting in poor customer experiences."

The salad bar is filled with great selections, and the meat is prepared to perfection, no matter how well done you desire it.  Service was very attentive, and came to the table frequently.  A great place to go for a quality meal to celebrate, or take a date, or even just have a nice personal dinner.  \n\nSo tonight I was looking at Brazilian Steakhouses on Yelp, and another reviewer mentioned this place.  I live on the other side of the valley, so I was a little hesitant to make the 30 minute drive when I have a couple of places on my side of town.  Well as soon as I took my first bites, I knew it was worth the drive.\n\nThe salad bar had a few different dishes in addition to the standard Brazilian Steakhouse fare.  That being said, after a quick trip around it, I didn't grab much, after all, I'm here for the meats.  \n\nAs soon as I sat down from the salad bar trip, I was greeted by the gauchos who brought me several kinds of steak, pork shoulder, and turkey wrapped in bacon.  While I like my meat more on the well done side, there were cuts for every preference.  Once I made it known to the gauchos that I liked the meat more well done, every time they approached my table they offered me the well done portions.  \n\nMy server was constantly present refilling my beverage and asking if he could get me side dishes,  Unlike the other places I've visited, here you have to request your sides, but they're included in the price.  They have several options and of course they're all unlimited.  \n\nAs it said on their menu there are a couple of things you have to ask for, if you would like to have them, including chicken hearts.  From the first trip I took to a Brazilian Steakhouse, I learned to like the chicken hearts, so I made sure to request them.  When they came, they were plentiful and flavorful.  \n\nThe only suggestion I have is for them to leave a menu or list of the meats so you know which ones are upcoming, and when to not fill up.  \n\nThe atmosphere was great, the gauchos and servers were very attentive, and most importantly the food was flavorful and delicious.  Well worth the cost, and the drive from anywhere in the Vegas Valley.  \n\nWith the prices and the drive it is unlikely this is a weekly destination, but I'll definitely be back for special occasions.  It's also a great place to come when you just feel like celebrating a Wednesday night off (or whatever night you feel.)"

They offer mojitos (classic, or muddled with fruit), and also caipirinhas.  The caipirinha is a pretty strong drink made with lime juice, sugar, and an alcohol made from sugar cane juice (tastes kind of like light rum).  You also have the option of having this with muddled fruit.  It's great with kiwi, and extra lime.\nThey do get really busy, so service can be a little slow."

The quality of everything there stood out. I highly recommend loading up a separate plate with their grilled portobello mushrooms. These go so well with the meats to come that you'll want to have a plate there as a side.\n\nBack at the table, the meat on a skweres started to arrive. They had salmon, beef ribs, top sirloin, skirt steak, lamb and I'm sure I'm missing one other. Different parts of each skewer were cooked to different temperatures so if you preferred medium rare and someone else at the table likes medium well, they can accomodate this without a problem. \n\nAll of the meats were excellend but for me the best by far is the skirt steak. Be sure to save room feel free to request it, they go out of their way to be accomodating.\n\nThe only minor criticism is that my son felt the meats were a bit on the salty side. I didn't notice this but he's always been more sensitive than I to salt. \n\nOverall, highly recommended. At $45 it may be a bit pricy but if your a dedicated carnivor with a good appetite, you'll be glad you went."

            "review": "They only get 2 stars because the owner needs to learn some serious people skills! I have eaten there twice, the first time was on a week night and there were only about 8 tables seated. Everyone bent over backwards for us, which I expected because they had the time to do it. We liked it so much that we decided to book their New Year's Eve Party. We were 5 minutes late to our 10:30pm reservation and then stood for almost 10 minutes waiting to check in because a large party was standing in the entryway. The hostess (turned out to be the owner) saw us standing there and ignored us. When we finally got to check in she told us that they had given our table away so we now had to wait. After waiting 10 minutes I asked how much longer it was going to be because we had been told the food service stopped at midnight. I couldn't understand her answer because the DJ music was so loud. When I told her this she started screaming at me that I could stop yelling at her and that if we didn't like it we could walk out because she didn't need people like us. When I tried to explain that I was speaking loudly because of the music she cut me off and screamed at me some more. The other hostesses and guests were in shock. So I decided to ask her name. Her answer was that she was the owner and I could call her the owner or I could get out. Since there were no other options for dinner at that point I asked how long it was going to be and she said she had to find somewhere to \"put us\". We were finally seated last after she seated 6 groups that came in after us. We reached our table at 11:05 and then sat for another 5 minutes before anyone came to the table. There were at least 5 open tables in the section we were in so it was pretty clear there shouldn't have been a problem \"finding somewhere to put us\". The hostess who did seat us apologized repeatedly for her behavior and said she was sorry there was nothing she could do. It was clear from our conversation with her and other staff during the night that outbursts like this are a regular occurrence and the staff are used to trying to make it up to guests who do stay and eat. I guess it should have been a warning when I saw her grabbing party favors out of a guest's hand and yelling at the woman that she could only have 1 item per person. \nOur server was wonderful once he realized we were his table. However it was clear the staff bringing the meat around had no idea how to navigate a full restaurant. My plate was constantly empty and we spent half the night craning our necks trying to find the closest meat server. The salad bar was the usual which surprised me for a party that they were charging so much extra for. It is tiny compared to other Brazilian Steakhouses we have been to and both times they have hit a big pet peeve of mine. They put the salad dressing in front of the tray of salad so lettuce drops into it during the night. By the time we got to the salad bar the dressing was full of lettuce, which is a health code violation. It has happened both times we have eaten there, so it is clearly not something they care to keep neat. The meats were so salty that I had to ask for center cuts. And after being promised they were serving food until 1am, they stopped bringing meat around at midnight. They put out a dessert buffet at midnight. By 12:20 there were about 20 items left and they were all stale like they had sat out all day before being served. The worse part was they didn't have any more so several people didn't even get dessert which was included in the higher price for the party. We finally had to ask for more fried bananas. Once the server realized we hadn't gotten any dessert he brought us something from their regular menu. \nThe last thing that bothered me was on the check. The check had been rung up under a different server's name. When I asked about it we were told that our server was the \"second\" on a team and the name was the \"leader\" of the team. I asked where the leader was, and was told she had already left the floor for the night. I thought it was tacky that I was expected to tip a \"team\" of servers when only one person had spoken to us all night. I am not talking about leaving the bussers and such out. I don't think someone who never even spoke to me should get a tip from me. Especially someone who has already gone home even though we are still seated. \nWe won't be going back unless someone else is buying for certain. If you do go, make sure it is on a slow night so you get good service and pray you don't cross paths with the owner."

We had a groupon and wanted to use it, so that was the biggest incentive, plus payday meant I had money to spend.  The long week at work also meant I was ready to relax and eat good food.\nWalked in and our table was ready.  The service was amazing!  Since it was our first time, we had to learn a little about the process.  Everyone was very attentive to us all.  We got clean plates every so often, and water was refilled before it ran out.\nThe food was delicious.  My 3 year old could not get enough.  The salad bar had risotto, salad, seafood, mushrooms, rice, and other inviting items.  There were also side dishes you could order.  We got fries for the kids, and asparagus and collard greens for hubby and I.  Then came the meat!  When I turned my card over to green, the servings came nonstop!  There was skirt steak, top sirloin, pork rib, beef rib, prime rib, bacon wrapped turkey, bacon wrapped beef tenderloin, pork tenderloin, chicken legs, frog legs, my  favorite corn, and I don't remember what else.  By the end of dinner, my 3 year old kept asking for more steak!  They brought some out just for him.  For dessert, we had the creme brulee.  It was a huge portion that all of us could share.  It was nice and creamy, not to sweet and was a nice finish to a fantastic dinner.\nFor all four of us, our bill with the groupon came out to 73 and change.  I tipped 20.  The pricing is great especially since the kids are free.  I definitely think it is worth the money.  If you want to go to Via Brasil, but are on the fence or think that it is a lot to spend, I would say GO GO GO."

She even went so far as to use racial slurs and call the lady the \"C\" word!!!  After that, the manager followed the customers to the front door where she continued to harass them.\n\nIt's bad enough when your food service sucks but to treat any customer that way is inexcusable.\n\nNot a chance on earth we will ever return to this God awful place."

            "review": "Extremely disappointed with this place after our visit last Sunday for my grandmothers 75th birthday. There were 7 of us and we all ordered the Sterling dinner which is $49.99 per person. The Sterling, which is the more expensive choice, offers 21 meats including bacon wrapped filet, porterhouse, lamb, strip steak, etc. All the meat you can want plus unlimited sides and salad bar, sounds good right? WRONG! \n\nI'll start off with the salad bar. It was very tiny compared to its competitors. There was a small section of lettuce and toppers to make your own salad, some specialty cold cuts and cheeses, a few hot items and some cold salads. Blah. Nothing stood out, but obviously the salad bar is just a filler. Skip this if at all possible. \n\nThe sides. They have a good selection, but again nothing really stood out and these are also fillers. We got the steak fries, which are not the thick fries they are actually skinny so I don't know why they call them steak fries, fried banana, mashed potatoes, yucca fries and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. All served with your meal, and unlimited.  \n\nThe \"rodzio\" style dinner left something to be desired. As I said we all got the Sterling dinner. Of the 21 meats on the menu, we may have tried 15 and that's because they did not offer the others. We were offered shrimp, garlic bread, and flank steak a ton of times, yet the expensive meats such as the filet were offered sparingly. When they finally brought the filet to the table everyone opted for some. It was wrapped in bacon which was hardly cooked, so it made the filet chewy and overly salty. Most took the bacon off. When they came around again we asked if they could make the filet without bacon, and they said sure and it would be 10 minutes. No problem. I am not joking when I say we did not get the filet for a good 40 minutes even after we talked to a manager who said she would get it out to us asap. She did mention that the filet had been offered to our table 3 times, which is interesting that they keep track of that. I guess to throw it back in your face when you complain? I'm sorry.. Is $50 a person not enough to warrant more than 3 trips to our table with the prime meats? Disgusting. \n\nSide note the place was not busy at all, we went Sunday night at 5:30 and there were maybe 8-10 tables so I am not sure what the deal was. Most of the meats we did get were good. I enjoyed the top sirloin and the filet without bacon. I can't look past the bad service and the fact we weren't offered all the meats that we paid for. Looking at their menu now, I never saw the lamb shank, pork ribs, tangy chicken, salmon, or Brazilian pork. They sat us at a big round table at the back of the restaurant in the corner, I kinda feel like we were just shoved off to the side and ignored. Oh and another thing is be prepared to eat in the dark. They have the lights down so low, you can't even tell which meat is which and what your eating. Super annoying. I get wanting to have ambiance, but they go a little too far. \n\nAnd finally the icing on the cake is that we told them it was grandma's birthday and wanted to get her a piece of cheesecake, her favorite dessert, and they brought caramel flan. What the hell! She doesn't even like flan. It's like they didn't care to accommodate any of our requests at all. We were paying for the dessert, although it should have been comped after spending $350, but they still couldn't get it right. Extremely, extremely disappointing. After expressing our concerns to the manager she did take $10 off everyone's dinner, which is the only why I gave them a star. But that won't save them. Texas DE Brazil from here on out. I'll never step foot in this place again."

The red sangria was also good. Our only complaint is the coffee.  It tasted like instant.  Extremely strong and as soon as It started to cool down it was sooooo bitter.  I understand most people are not ordering coffee so why not have one of those single cup machines.  The only other thing was they had fried rice to go with black beans.  A nice white rice would have been so much better.  Our server was Vinny and he was amazing.  He was very attentive and took his time with us. We have been to another Brazilian steakhouse on the strip and Via Brazil kicked their butt with the food and service.  We will most definitely be back!"

There were 8 people in my party for happy hour.   I have been to this restaurant several times for Happy Hour in the 3 years I have lived in Las Vegas.  They have recently advertised their restaurant quite aggressively.  I will not (nor will the other people in my group) be going back again.  After sitting there for almost an hour and repeatedly asking waiter for a drink (even water would have been nice), we finally got our drinks.  I ordered a Corona with lime and was brought a Stella something or other...not what I ordered.  Others ordered wine and were served something  other than what they ordered. The food orders were all mixed up. Some people got their food right away and were finished eating before others even received their food. Then when we tried to pay our tabs and leave, the waiter brought the wrong credit card to the person asking for hers (scary!)  We asked for the manager who took 30 minutes to come to the table.  We were trying to explain our frustration, but she was looking over our heads at the table next to ours because they were complaining to the waiter as well.  She never once tried to make things right.  I asked for my credit card and my check.  She said she had to run my credit card first.  I told her I never I intended to use my credit card for payment, that I was paying cash, and that the waiter was holding my credit card \"hostage\".  All in all, it was a terrible experience and neither I nor my friends will be back to this restaurant."

The steaks beats Sls, Lawrys many expensive steak houses on the strip and in the casinos such as Bellagio, Encore, Aria.

Other steaks worth trying like NY, Tritip, Garlic steak, etc... they all come juicy, hot and delicious. I will never go to a regular steak house ever since their steaks will get cold half way due to the large steaks they serve. This is the inherent advantage of brazilian steak house.\nAmbience - 5 stars. It is cozy and family oriented. It is not a bar. We always feel very welcome here. This is our 5th time in 3 months."

Impressed with nice spread and variety on salad bar so much that we decided to skip the roaming waiters with their luscious cuts of meat, poultry and fish. Will have to come back for that part of the menu!  The service was excellent, very friendly and accommodating servers! They also have a great cocktail bar setting and a Sunday brunch that is well worth the small price!!"

            "review": "Like most Brazilian steakhouses, Via Brasil features an elegant dining room with excellent service. I usually skimp over the salad bar, but the appetizers were really good. The spread had the perfect mix of charcuterie, salad, and vegetables. I enjoyed the crab ceviche, beef carpaccio, and the various assorted grilled items. But, in all seriousness, I was here for the meat, not the salad bar. \n\nVia Brasil jumps to the top of my list for one of the best Brazilian steakhouses for their meats. I loved that the skin of the chicken drumsticks were perfectly crispy. All of the beef (top sirloin, tri-tip) was perfectly medium-rare. One of my biggest gripes about Brazilian barbecue is how salty all their roasts are, but I found all the meats to be well-seasoned without being over-seasoned, especially the crusts. The flavors were amazing. Also, baked cheese? Love it! The cheese paired wonderfully with the meats. \n\nWhat didn't I like? The rotation of meats didn't come frequently enough and at one point we were at a standstill. There were no ribs, lamb, or fish offered that evening. The other disappointment was the cheesecake for dessert. They actually ran out and I got one of the last slices, but it was far from what they labeled \"NY cheesecake.\" It was heavy and generic. I should've gone for the Brazilian doughnuts with ice cream. \n\nI'll end with a positive note. The tableside basket of cheese-baked bread balls were simply amazing. Single-most addictive item on the menu."

It was much smaller and nothing tastes great. The best part was the bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's. The meat was okay nothing to fav over my favorite would have to be the garlic steak.

            "review": "My hubby has a birthday coming up and he wants Texas de Brazil for his special dinner. Since we had been to TDB before, and not tried Via Brasil even though it is in our area, I figured we could give it a shot. I did have an A-OK experience, but I am glad it wasn't his actual birthday dinner or I would have been disappointed we didn't go to TDB. \n\nThe \"Rodizio\" dinner is priced at $45.99 per person. A 50 plus item salad bar is included, and you get to try 18 different meats that meat carvers bring to your table on skewers. You can choose if you want what they have and how much. If pink meat isn't your thing, you can request any of the meat be cooked to to your liking. They give each person there own round paper disc that you turn to green when you are ready for more meat and then you turn it to red until you are ready for more or are simply done eating. I was impressed by the fact that the side dishes were included with the meal. They had like 16 to choose from and you can pick as many as you like. That is a nice touch! They ask that you tell them your sides when you first get there so they can start preparing them. \n\nSo I am not a vegetarian at all, but I don't eat a whole lot of meat. Tonight was my night to shine as the carnivore I am not. I absolutely succeeded! I first went to the salad bar. I wasn't impressed. There were a lot a seafood options which is great, but not for someone like me who doesn't eat seafood. I didn't feel there was a lot of options for a salad however the veggies they did offer were fresh and delicious. I put some \"Caprese Salad\" on my plate and that was actually very good. As we finished up our salad, the sides we ordered arrived. The \"White Rice\" paired nicely with the \"Sauteed Mushrooms\" and the \"Fried Banana\" was good. Then the meats started coming! I have to admit that the \"Top Sirloin\" known as \"Pichana\" that they claim is the star of the meal was not good at all. The meat was tough and flavorless. The \"NY Strip\", and \"Prime Rib\" were the same, tough meat and flavorless. Then came the \"Bacon Wrapped Turkey\" and THAT is delicious. I'm a huge fan of bacon and the bacon really added a nice flavor to the turkey. Then came the \"Garlic Filet and \"Bacon Wrapped Filet and these two are the star of the meal to me. The filet was so tender and flavorful. I like my meat cooked well done so the server took note of that and made sure to bring me pieces with no pink. I liked my meal, but can't see coming back and paying full price again. Maybe if it were a deal they had going on or something. The meat at first was not good, and the salad bar was not great. I know this isn't TDB, but I do have to compare it because they both have the \"churrascaria\" thing going on. And the salad bar at TDB is worth just eating that alone. The sides were decent, but I only enjoyed a few types of the meat so I'd rather spend the extra to have TDB. \n\nThere is a Happy Hour here at Via Brasil Monday - Sunday from 5-8 pm in the patio/bar. Every Sunday they have a \"Sunday Brunch\" from 10 am - 2 pm and have different specials for the brunch so you might want to call and ask if there is a theme for that day. They have several options for events and banquets too."

In sum, it wasn't very crowded for lunch, very attentive service and the meats were very juicy and NOT overly bloody which I was happy about.  The salad bar was stocked with everything from basic caprese salad to a fancy steamed seafood pot.  I liked the cheese rolls and fried plantains as sides.  Plus for broccoli!  LOL. I like my veggies.\n\nI am not a connoisseur of meats, but I think I had sirloin, turkey wrapped with bacon, sausage and skirt steak.   I didn't like the garlic beef which wasn't as tender as the test.   It was all tasty and the service was top-notch.  Everyone from the main host guy to the beverage servers were very polite and attentive.   It is a bit pricey if you order drinks and dessert, but my husband is a bbq fanatic and I let him have his day.  Overall, it was a good off-strip find, but make sure you are hungry so you can make the most of the price."

They easily honored our request, even the Hostess helped us move our drinks to a center situated table. \nWe all ordered the Sterling level. \nThe cheesy rolls, p\u00e3o de queijo ... ehh, I have certainly had much better. They were a bit too gummy and seriously under baked inside.\nThe salad bar, again...ehh. Much to be desired. As a ranch dressing fiend, it did taste housemade which was nice. But many items from the salad bar were overly and unnecessarily salty, imo. The beef carpaccio has two dabs of green olive puree, not sure why. I was told the lobster bisque was adequate, not great. \nService -- really was very good. All of the servers, runners and the meat skewer guys were helpful, informative and stopped to check on us the entire evening in a not-so intrusive way. \nLooking at their menu posted online, we pretty much had every option at some point in the evening. Including leg of lamb -decent enough, baby lamb chops, sooo cute, but overcooked. Brazilian pork was moist if you asked not for the crispy part, melted mozz - all of the good parts of a pizza.\nSides were okay, mashed potatoes, asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, fried bananas. The spinach was not completely wilted, perhaps that was a cost savings procedure? \nWe all opted for dessert and espressos and cappuccino...passion fruit mousse - not my thing, but not terrible. Flan, no caramelized sugar sauce, but again not terrible. Chocolate mousse....slightly disappointing. It is one of my few dessert weaknesses...almost could not taste the pudding that was definitely whipped in.\nIn all, disappointed especially because of the proximity.\nBrunch or happy hour seem to have better reviews, perhaps would have been a better visit. :-/"

To make up for it, my 101st review is on someplace stellar!\n\nVia Brasil is on point!  Really a very good place to have a protein-filled dinner!  Calories?  Who cares!  With over 14 types of meat to choose from and a stocked salad bar with over 30 hot and cold items to choose from, you're gonna wanna get a taste of everything Via Brasil has to offer!\n\nWe started our meal with their warm Brazilian cheese buns which were gooey and tasty.  Our server also showed us that with each meal besides the all-you-can-eat salad bar and the meat, we also had unlimited choices of any of their side dishes that came from the kitchen.  I can't remember the entire sides menu but we ordered:\n\n-Sweet potato fries\n-Collard greens\n-Fried bananas \n\nWe placed our sides order in before we were escorted to the salad bar.  This was another treat.  It seems Via Brasil is on par with Texas de Brazil on salad bar selections, and there was many high quality items to choose from:\n\n-Caesar salad \n-Grilled peppers\n-Marinated portobello mushrooms\n-Hearts of Palm\n-Caprese salad (pretty good, creamy)\n-Seafood salad\n-Fine cheeses\n\nAlong with the salad bar are six hot dishes that are offered, on this day we tried:\n\n-Mushroom risotto\n-Fish in lemon butter sauce\n-Rice & beans\n\nAll the salad bar items we sampled were fresh and pretty good.  I love a good salad with marinated fresh grilled veggies, brings on a sense of balance before you attack the meat like a t-rex!  Via Brasil's beans were super good, I loved the smoky flavor with the addition of the hamhock in the mix.  I had two bowls!  The only thing I missed from Via Brasil's salad bar versus Texas de Brazil's (and I should be ashamed in saying this) is that at Texas they have California Roll sushi on the line.  'Faux-shi'...for shame!  I dunno, I guess I just like having the option of eating it if I want to!\n\nShortly after we got our salads our side dishes arrived.  I enjoyed the tart of the collard greens, and both the sweet potato fries and fried bananas were good.  We finally flipped our little marker to green and off we were to the meat races!  We sampled just about everything on Via Brasil's menu that night:\n\n-Garlic picanha\n-Sausage\n-Flank steak\n-Tenderloin wrapped in Bacon\n-Beef Ribs\n-Prime Rib\n-Leg of Lamb\n-Salmon\n-Chicken drumsticks\n-Chicken hearts\n\nJust about everything was excellent!  I noticed that Via Brasil uses a bit less salt than the folks at Texas which made the flavor of their meats a bit more appealing to my palette.  I loved the garlic picanha and their flank steak, juicy and tender.  The prime rib was great, just be sure to ask for a thicker cut!  The beef ribs were very good with their house BBQ sauce, I was eating part of a slab like Fred Flintstone!  The leg of lamb was not 'lamby' at all.  I had a small issue with the salmon, it was on the dry side.  But the surprise of the night was the chicken hearts, man were those good!  Reminds you of a Japanese izakaya because of that grilled flavor.  We almost ate an entire stake of these ourselves!  I am no stranger to exotic food!  Give it a shot and try it...you just might like it!\n\nAnd don't forget to ask your server to bring their chimichurri sauce for your table!  It's a must for your meat!  The mix of olive oil, garlic, lemon, parsley and other herbs gives your meat that punch of flavor which will ignite your taste buds.  Super good!  \n\nVia Brasil also does offer various dessert choices but after the meat attack we went through we were too full to order anything, I'm thinking maybe next time?  And yes, there will probably be a next time.\n\nService was very good here, our server was attentive, kept our glasses full, and answered any questions we had about the salad bar or the types of meat they served.  And don't forget to join Via Brasil's e-club!  You receive news on special events and promotions, as well as possible BOGO coupons on your birthday or anniversary!  Always a plus in my book to save that dough!\n\nI missed the old Makino that used to be in this space, but Via Brasil has done a great job taking over.  We left happy with joyous memories, and our bellies full of food.  Food that alas, will force me to work twice as hard in the gym to burn these meaty calories off.  Uh...I work out!!"

The food is delicious ---  flavorful and options are aplenty. The variety of foods at the salad bar is great. The best bread (the little balls with cheese inside) I've ever had. But, hands down, Via Brazil has the best happy hour menu, food and drinks, in town. Love this place!"

First and foremost the place is casual...saw people in t shirts and flip flops on a Friday nite. :) The \"salad/appetizer\" bar is a meal in itself and the place to start off. Be careful NOT to overeat at the salad bar because it is easy to do with the 25-30 items !! When you are ready to begin the main course, you simply turn over a coaster to \"green\" and the servers with skewers of 15 plus meats come by and you can say yes or no. When you want to be left alone, turn your coaster to \"red\" and they won't bug you. Look at staying around 2 hours and pace yourself !! Excellent choice for special occasions.."

            "review": "At Via Brazil I like to describe my experience as tasty and classy!\n\nAt this extremely sophisticated Brazilian steakhouse you will find a wide variety of exotic cuts of meats, salads, drinks and desserts. At Via Brazil, you can be sure that you will be treated like a king, please keep in mind that my review is very accurate as I been polishing it throughout the years that I  have been going there. In addition, I would never be writing a review like this if I didn't truly believe that this restaurant is able to provide the experience that I'm describing here. This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, as you can see that I've been going there a lot.\n\nNow, for you all that are questioning why is that Via Brazil have so many 5 star reviews, yet there are some random people out there that will rate it one star, please read with attention the following paragraph :)\n\nAs I have stated initially, Via Brazil is a classy, sophisticated, yet affordable Brazilian steakhouse. However, some people will try to take advantage of its \"all you can eat\" system, which allows you to pay a fee \"per person\" in order to take advantage of its rodizio. In Portuguese, we say \"mas que coisa de pobre em?\" Meaning that some people will try to take advantage of the system, by buying only one rodizio, while saying that his friends will \"only be having drinks.\" Really? You come to a classy steakhouse with your girlfriend and friends and subject yourself to such situation, trying to share expansive meats with everyone in your table while paying for only one person? \n\nI think my message is clear here, this place is amazing, their foods and service are 5 stars, but sometimes business like this will get people trying to take advantage of their system. But they are a minority, as most people that go there are classy and educated people like you and me :)\n\nVia Brazil is the best steakhouse in Las Vegas, period. They have the best happy hour in town, awarded many times for different magazines. In addition, I write because I feel like this is the right thing to do. Don't you think that if those people writing bad reviews really cared about creating a social media rating system that is truly accurate, they would at least be truthful in their statements? This is how we build an awesome Yelp community, by rating good place and helping bad places improve by writing reviews, taking pictures and being helpful! \n\nI write this because I love food, and Via Brazil is my favorite restaurant in the entire world. Luckily I work hard so that I can afford to pay for it and feed my wife, friends and family at Via Brazil when I wish too.\n\nFinally, my tip for you who are new at Via Brazil follows:\n\n- Start by eating some \"SALGADINHOS\" followed by a traditional \"CAIPIRINHA\"\n\n- Second, eat some \"PICANHA\" and \"FRAUDINHA\"\n\n- If you like sea food, they got you covered, their salad bar has the best \"LOBSTER BISQUE\" and steamed seafood. \n\n- If rodizio is just too much food for you, try their happy hour deals and I can guarantee to you that you won't be disappointed.\n\nI hope you all enjoyed reading this review and please remember that if you are looking for a great night with great people and great food, then your night starts at Via Brazil Stakehouse! Remember to make reservations on special holidays like Valentine's Day because they do get really busy! Tell them you are going there because you read my review and maybe you get a free Caipirinha! I'm joking... but it's worth it a try ;)"

I found myself comparing this place to Texas de Brazil in Town Square all night long.  And here is my verdict....The salad bar at Texas de Brazil is better, fresher, tastier.  However, the meats at Via Brasil are superior to Texas.  The meats are not as fatty and just taste better.  My favorites were the prime rib, top sirloin and beef ribs.  Both atmospheres are very nice, clean, and beautiful.  Another observation I made was that the staff at Via (the waiters, the guys that cut the meat, the managers, hostess) were much more professional, courteous and all around nicer than the staff at Texas.  I really liked this place.  I went on a groupon so I ended up paying $50 for 2 people."

Had trouble finding parking in the lot directly in front of the building. It's a big shopping center so we parked on the other side. We came just a couple minutes before our reservation at 6:45 and the male manager rudely told us it would be a ten minute wait. Okay well I guess we will go to the bar. The bartender was very friendly and efficient. We waited closer to 20 minutes for our table. \nOut server Dante provided really good service as well as his two assistance. He had one guy who only seemed to do beverages and another one who picked up our plates and bring more side dishes. The sides were okay, a little under seasoned. The fried bananas were so good. They had the right amount of sweetness. There was constant stream of meat but it seemed be a lot of the same stuff. The sterling meal promises an upwards of 20 or more meats but I didn't feel like that was the case. The meat were well seasoned and delicious. The salad bar was okay, probably on the lower end of the spectrum. The salmon and chicken Marsala seemed to have been sitting there awhile. It was not very good. I wanted to try the flan but I was stuffed."

            "review": "If you've never been to a churrascaria or Brazilian steakhouse, your first experience will likely be 5 stars simply from the wow factor of unlimited sumptuous meat being carved table-side and the opulence of a lavish salad bar that could serve as a meal in itself.  Pretty much everything I say onward will likely be inconsequential.  However, if you've been around the block a time or two as I have and want the tale of the tape between two local heavyweights (Texas de Brazil(TDB) vs. Via Brasil(VB)) going at it for twelve rounds, let's get it on!\n\nRound 1 (Ambience) \nThis may come down to personal preference since there is definitely an upscale vibe with soothing waterfalls and romantic lighting upon entering VB, but not sure if I liked the feng shui of the salad bar in the middle without any partitioning of the tables into separate little rooms for added intimacy.  TDB definitely has a more upbeat vibe with a casual bar area where you can await guests and separate little rooms although definitely more crowded and noisy since it is more bustling with turnover of guests.   Winner: Push\n\nRound 2 (Cheese bread)\nIf you took the most perfect cheese puff and turned it into bread form, this is pretty much the pinnacle of that transformation.  TDB has a slightly cheesier flavor, which gives it a slight edge.  Winner: TDB\n\nRound 3 (Salad bar)\nFor first-timers (or as I like to call them, churrascarookies), you never want to overfill your plate on the salad bar, as tempting as it may be.  However, it's good to wet one's appetite on some items to balance the meat fest to come.  I felt the overall quality was superior in the salad bar at TDB since they offered lobster bisque and focused more on artisanal cheeses and light seafood/veggies options, whereas at VB, there was one too many pasta options like cheese ravioli and other pasta salads, which are like underhanded tactics to fill you up to limit your meat intake.  Winner: TDB\n\nRound 4 (Beverages)\nVB took a knockdown in this round since the waiter sat us down and presented us with options for water(still or sparkling?) and upon choosing still, he charged us for two bottles of some premium water at 7 bucks/bottle without clueing us in about the option for tap water since we assumed it was complementary.  They also failed to carry Antarctica Guarana, the most popular soda in Brazil and something I look forward to anytime I venture into a Brazilian restaurant.  TDB would never allow the water fiasco to occur and always carry my non-alcoholic beverage of choice.   Winner: TDB\n\nRound 5 (Opening meats)\nSurprisingly, VB opens with a baked salmon served with passion fruit/mango sauce....not what I expected but really good, and the table-side presentation was a nice touch.  Usually at TDB, they start you off with some non-premium beef wrapped in thick bacon or some heavy pork/chicken option.  Winner: VB\n\nRound 6 (Lamb)\nLeg of lamb was sufficiently juicy and came with a nice mint jelly, but TDB offers multiple cuts including the lamb chop, which was unavailable at VB.  Winner: TDB\n\nRound 7 (Fowl)\nVB definitely had some interesting options including chicken, duck, and chicken hearts (upon request), whereas TDB only has a single dry chicken option which I tend to pass over to allow more room for other meat options.  The chicken and duck were very succulent and tender, and well seasoned here.  Winner: VB\n\nRound 8 (Brazilian sausage)\nLike the cheese bread, fairly standard and not being a huge sausage connoisseur, I'm not the best judge on this one.  Winner: Push \n\nRound 9 (Side dishes)\nTaking an intermission from the meats, I think VB offers some additional Brazilian sides like fried/boiled yucca root and sauteed turnip greens which have a more stir-fried crispy preparation compared to the stewed version in soul-food.  Traditional favorites such as fried bananas and mashed potatoes are present at both.  Winner: VB\n\nRound 10 (Beef)\nMaybe it was the pace of the meats brought to our table, but I felt that the overall quality of the beef cuts were superior at TDB since there were a few cuts that were overly dry and tough at VB although certain cuts were very tender/flavorful.  WInner: TDB\n\nRound 11 (Service)\nWaitstaff definitely more attentive at TDB and the pace of the meat parade was more even, so I didn't feel like I had to overcrowd my plate and lose track of which meat was which.  The TDB meat carvers also wear a uniform that gives them some more professional flare, which I appreciated.  WInner: TDB\n\nRound 12 (Value)\nSomewhat tied into service, the server initially took our groupon voucher at the beginning but conveniently left it off in our final bill until we reminded him.  Taking account the variety/quality of meats/salad bar, would have to give slight edge to TDB.    Winner: TDB\n\nBy decision,winner of this fight goes to Texas de Brazil,but don't count out Via Brasil in a rematch.  A new fierce challenger has recently arrived into town(Fogo de Chao), so a TKO may be in our midst!"

Especially if that time is a 9 pm reservation because according to Open Table at the time the \"reservation\" was made, it was the earliest time available for a party of 2. AND especially since Via Brasil called me to confirm the reservation yesterday afternoon. \n\nUpon arriving (15 min early, I might add) we discovered several other seemingly disgruntled couples standing outside of the restaurant. We walked in to check in for our 9 pm \"reservation\" and were told that \"unfortunately\" they were running behind and were only just seating people with 8 pm reservations meaning that our 9 pm reservation would actually be sat closer to 10 pm. \n\nSo, the reservation wasn't really a reservation...it was call ahead seating booked through Open Table? For Valentine's dinner?  Riiiight. \n\nSo, thank you Via Brasil...you actually did us a huge favor. Rather than waiting until nearly 10 pm to eat in your obnoxiously loud and crowded restaurant, we went across the street to Honey Salt and were sat right away.  We had an amazing meal for probably half the cost of what we would have paid at your restaurant. Funny thing about Honey Salt...they recognized the couples eat out at a nice restaurant for Valentine's Day and actually brought in extra tables to accommodate more patrons...GENIUS! Bonus points...they handed out roses to the ladies. Honey Salt is our new fave joint near our house. Separate 5 star review coming shortly for them..."

I've driven by countless times but failed to visit until recently. Located at the corner of Charleston and Ft. Apache, the outside looks impressive, but the interior is even more so. It's large, open, and elegantly decorated.\n\nIf you want all-you-can-eat meat, there are two options. \"Prime\" is $39.99 and includes many basic items like garlic steak, BBQ baby back ribs, chicken breasts, drumsticks, flank steak, pork, and sausage. The higher end option is the \"Sterling\" for $49.99, which includes everything in the Prime option plus NY steak, lamb chops, leg of lamb, filet wrapped in bacon, salmon, and rib eye.\n\nMy favorites were the lamb chops, filet in bacon, grilled shrimp, trip-tip, and short ribs. \n\nFor those that only want the salad bar, you can get that for $24.99. The salad bar has an impressive array of hot and cold dishes, although some turned out to be not so great. The beef carpaccio was under seasoned. Curry mussels were spicy and also felt gritty. The lobster bisque was creamy with rich flavors.\n\nFor dessert the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was textbook perfect with a thick layer of sugar coating the top and creamy custard underneath.\n\nIt is a bit pricey (for two adults and one kid we spent well over $200), but if you're fond of Brazilian steakhouses, this one should be on your list."

True it helps that my husband knows which meats are the best and which are more just filler meats but the sides and meat were both better than any of the other places.

Beautiful room - more restful than the competition and very attentive service and friendly bartenders. . \n\nHappy Hour customers agree with me it's the best one in Las Vegas even with their recent price increases. .  Beer, wine, well drinks, mojitos and Capirinhas  range  from $4 - $6 dollars during HH.   HH Food is generally  small plates with some entree alternatiaves.   . Very large HH menu.  Some of my favorite dishes: Caesar Salad 4.50  (best in town and good portion) you can add chicken or steak to make it a meal.  Beef Carpaccio 6.50,  Asparagus Risotto  6.50 (large portion), They also have small portions of the steakhouse options which are yummy.  Restaurant has a lot of options for group events as well (Private dining room etc...)\n\nThis is a family run operation.

One is $39.99 for 85% of the menu. The other is $49.99 and you get to add on unlimited rack of lamb, shrimp, filet mignon, table side cut ribeye, salmon, etc. Since it's main competition is Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brasil which are both $49.99, we all decided to do the premium dinner anyway and get the full experience (note, Pampas and Bertollucci in town are garbage. AVOID).\n\nPROS:\n-Excellent quality meat, very tender and flavorful. Better than Fogo and way better than that Pampas dump, about as good as Texas de Brasil (town square).\n-Great service, they're friendly, you tell them what you want, they'll bring it cooked exactly how you like it, even if the entire table likes it's meat cooked differently.\n-Beef carpaccio on the salad bar! -was very good and all you can eat. No other place has this.\n-Lobster bisque on the bar was excellent, actually better than the bisque at sterling brunch.\n-Grilled shrimp had a nice scampi flavor and they are generous with it as they come around.\n-Fried, melted mozzarella with oregano, takes me back to the beach in Rio. Delicious and no other churrascaria in town offers this as well. It's good! A must try...\n-The atmosphere is nice and the tables are well separated so you feel like you have your own space as opposed to some of the madness at Texas de Brasil. I like the smaller dining room feel and private space.\n-The rack of lamb was large and meaty, bigger than most and cooked perfectly.\n\nCONS:\n-The pao de queso (cheese bread) wasn't totally hot and fresh and fluffy like I'm used to. My advice is to limit yourself on this addicting, cheesy ball of dough anyway, so not a big deal.\n-The banana that I requested them to bring at the end of the meal desperately needed more brown sugar and perhaps a little caramel and a touch of cream. It wasn't sweet like the ones at Texas de Brasil.\n-The accompanying sauces are hard to find and should have their own place on the salad bar to grab. I had to ask for mint jelly, the Brazilian style orange colored traditional steak sauce was no where to be found. There wasn't any horseradish (I forgot to ask) and the chimichurri sauce (which was on the salad bar) had next to it such a tiny, yet deep condiment dish that all the good stuff settled to the bottom and it seemed I was dipping the meat into oil rather than being able to dig into that good green stuff. Advice for next time would be to ask for all 4 sauces up front before the meat parade starts your way.\n-Seldom do they offer discounts like Fogo de Chao and the occasional ones I find for Texas de Brazil.\n\nOVERALL:\nThe quality of meat, the grilled shrimp, the lobster bisque, the beef carpaccio and the melted mozzarella are what puts this place towards the very top of the Brazilian steakhouse Vegas cluster. I was very pleased with the service and food and we all walked out a perfectly happy, bloated mess."

The salad bar was not bad but some of the items (eggplant, mushrooms, and the hot chicken should have been changed out an hour before we arrived. All were dry and hard).  The meat they're famous for was either raw in the middle or, if we requested slightly more done was served very well done. Certain items must be requested. I asked for lamb chops. 4 times over 40 minutes before I was served 2 overdone chops. I asked twice for more bread. It never arrived. There were plenty of waiters around so there was no excuse for the lack of service. I have heard the Brasil Steak house at Town Center is better.

When I  woke up, I wondered \"what the hell happened?\"  Meat Feast is what happened.\n\nYes, that is a true story.  Yes, as someone referred to it below as a \"food parade\" is true.  Did I love it?  Absolutely.\n\nWe had a group of 8 people.  I did not know what to expect about going there.  But the waiter explained everything to us. They have a salad bar thing- salad, pasta, etc. so I went over there and got a few things.  \n\nAnd then the meat came. \n\n It started at a slow pace and quickly picked up to where I had like 10 pieces of meat on my plate, but didn't want to pass up the meat guy when he came to the table.  Eventually, I had to turn my thing over so they didn't offer me any more meat.   And it was damn good meat.  I say meat, because I had so many different types, its very hard to remember all of it.\n\nWe have some friends that are Asian and from Hawaii and they asked about chicken hearts.  Within 10 minutes, the meat guy came to our table with chicken hearts.  (not something I would ever try again)  But how accommodating!  \n\nEveryone was really nice and willing to answer any questions!\n\nRecommendation: wear stretchy pants- you'll need it.\n\nIt's been a year since I have been there... I think it might be time to go back!"

We got there and it was buffet style, all u can eat salad, and various meats brought to your table and sliced onto your plate.  Appetizers were brought to our table also. The atmosphere and food is impressive and they've got 5 stars so far until I get the bill. They charged extra for desserts and drinks which it was assumed came with the buffet. $7 per dessert and about $3 per drink which made the bill about $30 more than expected. Those hidden costs were pretty underhanded because they even brought the dessert cart to the table and asked what we wanted for dessert. It would be just as unfair as finding out that the various poultry meats offered contained an extra charge.There were no menus and nobody told us drinks and desserts wouldn't be included in the buffet. I hope you scammers go out of business for pulling that crap."

Amazing salad bar with a variety of veggies, cheeses, meats, soups, and entrees for you to eat in addition to the Brazilian style meat service.  The veggies are fresh and delicious and the area is always spotless.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this place.  The food quality is excellent.  The meats are perfectly charred and seasoned and the server will cut you a portion depending on how cooked you like it.  \n\nSides are great too.  We always get mashed potatoes, broccoli, asparagus, and the plantains.  I'm surprised more people don't go.  The price is actually very reasonable for any restaurant let alone one that serves you so much meat (expensive) and has the level of service they do.  My favorite restaurant in the Peccole Ranch/Summerlin area."

Super pushy! Made me feel like she didn't want us to be there. She was annoying the other 4 tables next to mine with the same thing, asking REQUESTS. The Restaurant wasn't busy at all and one thing that I saw that grossed me out was, the same manager ( Ana ) made one of our meat servers clean the floor because he dropped some blood from the meat in the floor. Then she made him come back and serve us.\nThat for me was the end of the line! Health department should take a look at this. If she does this in the front of the house, can you imagine what goes on in the back? \nThe good news is that FOGO DE CHAO will open a Restaurant in Summerlin really soon.

So we didn't have any drinks until we flagged the waiter 30 mins after we first sat.  The food was ok. Although we were there for quite some time, it was the same meat choices  (Brazilian sausage, Chicken Hearts, flank steaks) that came around.... Where was the Shrimp, Picanha, ribs, filet migon, NY strip, Prime Rib, Blackened fillet, other traditional Brazilian meats, etc? We accidentally spilled gravy  on the table and even though it was seen by some employees, they did not assist us.  We didn't even get a refill on drink unless we asked, and when we did, it would be at least 15 mins before we got the drinks. We were getting frustrated and so we just called it quits for the meats and ordered our desert, I actually timed it and it took 36 mins to get desert. With that's said, we went ahead and asked for our check as soon as we got our desert in hopes to get the check back sooner than later. We also noticed the table service was horrible, there was at least 3 to 4 tables that were empty for at least 30 mins or so. We started to wonder why they didnt clear the tables sooner as we saw the large crowd at the entrance waiting frustrated. In my opinion, I believe they had plenty of personnel working, I think the problem was with the leads or section managers not managing their folks."

We hung out at the bar with a lot if other angry people with delayed reservations. Management came and went, never really providing much of an update and obviously had little concern for what was going on. We heard cuss words. Not very professional at all. \n\nSince we were seated about an hour late, the salad bar was beyond picked over. There wasn't much left and it was messy. \n\nThe side dishes were skimpy. The spinach was salty. Other sides were ok but very small. \n\nThe meat servers never seemed to make it to our table. They circled through the tables on the same pattern, and always ran out of meat just before our table. Awesome. In an hour, we had only been served meat three times. Wow. \n\nI checked in on Yelp, which offered a free dessert, only to be told that they would NOT honor the free check in coupon because it was a \"holiday\". Well....THEN WHY DO you HAVE a check in coupon?!?! The dessert we did have was disappointing (watery Tiramisu). \n\nWe have been to all the Brazilian style steakhouses in Vegas, and loved it. Viva does NOT do Brazilian steakhouses justice. In fact, the poor service and bad food make the other steakhouses more appealing. Viva makes McDonalds look appealing. \n\nI can honestly say that we will NEVER be back and we will tell all our friends, family and coworkers about our horrible experience here. Cannot believe this restaurant will be in business much longer treating customers like this. HORRIBLE."

Texas de Brasil might be more saltier with their meats compared to this place or you can say this place had less flavioring on their meats. Their salad bar was small, and didn't have much varieties like Texas de Brasil. This place has nice decor and pretty upscale. Overall conclusions: Texas de Brasil is better."

I had an ODORLESS black dye on my hair (no bleach) that needed an hour to process and I was hungry, so tried to kill 2 birds with one stone. I sat at the bar cause it was more causal but apparently my hair dye was offensive as the owner exiled us to the back of the restaurant behind a fountain next to the sliding doors that had a crack with all the cold air coming in. We were freezing and humiliated. Are they even legally allowed to do that?! I went and apologized to the other people at the bar for bothering them assuming someone complained, but they said they didn't notice or care that I had dye in my hair. So, it was definitely the call of the venue alone. Rude! Needless to say, I won't be going back. At least the bartender was nice about it.

We finally had to point out a table that had been sitting empty for over 20 mins to the host team. One of the main hostesses just rolled her eyes at the other hostess for not seeing it. We were finally seated at 11:10pm. We watched as one other lonely couple also waited as long as us because the hostess gave away their reservation. We witnessed \"cousins of a waiter\" (a party of over 15 people) getting sat without a reservation long before us. We gazed at three empty tables in the bar- which would've suited us fine- but nobody was smart enough to come up with an easy solution. All we really wanted to do was sit down and eat and enjoy time with our friends that were visiting. Where was management in all of this? I started to feel sorry for the staff, all of whom seemed entirely overwhelmed and tossed to the wolves.\nA staff member told us that the Manager was too busy waiting on tables and leaving other waiters high and dry with very few tables on this incredibly busy evening. A manager never checked in with us at all the entire night, even after we expressed our dissatisfaction to our server- Girardo. He did the best he could and was pleasant enough. \nThe food was okay but the $80 fixed price NYE meal was a big joke, and I would not recommend it to others. The sides were pathetic. The top sirloin was very good. The whole experience was rushed, which was unfortunate as we were trying to spend a nice evening out with out-of-town guests. We had to rush and get everything we wanted from the salad bar before they took it all away right before midnight and changed to desserts. One of my friend's is a vegetarian, so she was counting on another trip up but before we knew it it had been whisked away.\nVery hard to justify a $360 bill for four people after the bad start to our dining experience. Over half the restaurant brought their children and they were all running wild all night long. I understand that some families want to be together on NYE, but would you let them go crazy like that on a normal visit to Via Brasil? The music was entirely too loud, we couldn't hear each other at the table. All in all, we couldn't wait to get out of this place and never come back. Definitely leaving Via Brasil in 2013. We won't be back- EVER."

He completely ignored the situation for about ten minutes literally walking past us and in circles for about another two minutes until he finally asked if we are ok ??

The concept of having a server come to your table with a cart of roasted meats was a new experience for me, as well as a confusing one.\n\nI ordered from their Restaurant Week menu, which is also their regular \"Rodizio\" Select menu where you can eat 10 types of meats and order from a list of side dishes. You also have all access to their gourmet Appetizer Bar. For $4.00 more, you can order from an expanded menu that offers additional meat selections. \n\nGourmet Appetizer Bar: My favorites were the caprese salad and grilled zucchini, but I'm giving a thumbs down to one of their stuffed bacon wrapped items that was too bready -- obviously, not a favorite cause I forgot the name.\n\nMeats: The process to me was confusing. It seemed as though my boyfriend received more than myself because he ordered from the expanded menu. Oftentimes, I had to refer to my menu to find out which meats I can have before I embarrass myself by requesting something that I can't eat. Each cut of meat that  I did try was tender, flavorful, and extremely salty for my taste.\n\nSide Dishes: We ordered yucca fries, asparagus, and sauteed mushrooms. The latter was the best out of all the sides. \n\nService: Our server came by twice: once to hand us our menus, and once to take our order for the side dishes. After that, I just saw him standing to the side talk to other servers. Lastly, one server laughed at me as I took a photo of my food (Uh, REALLY?)\n\nOverall: Despite the salty meats the food was fine. What concerns me is the lack of professionalism of the service delivered by staff."

Yesterday I took my husband there for Father's Day, what a huge disappointment..  We kept returning because the service was always so nice and of course the food is delish. But yesterday the service was nothing short of TERRIBLE. The waiter stopped by only a few times. That meat service was only coming around every so often. Not constant like before. They were rotating the pineapple around like crazy though... The meat service was VERY slow. We tried to order the sides (mashed potatoes, etc) and the server tried talking us out of it since he said the kitchen was taking forever to get them out. We ordered mashed potatoes, asparagus & fried bananas. We were brought out asparagus and mashed potatoes, no bananas. We did not get our sides until the end, after we were done. We were so fed up with the service that my husband asked for the check and wanted to leave. The meal took 1.5 - 2 hours (and not due to the fact that we wanted it to last that long) to get our slices of meat to fill our bellies.  The check was $160 for 4 people (brunch prices, we typically spend over $200 due to dinner prices) and we felt so ripped off. We expect a certain level of service when we pay that amount of money for a meal... not to mention it ruined my husband's Father's Day meal.  Don't think we will be returning."

When we arrived, the party was hopping! They had hors d'oeuvres set up, and the bar was packed. I asked a waiter if the setup was all for us, the party goers, and he said yes. So, we grabbed a plate and some snacks and found a table. I went waited in line for the bartender,  who had to be flagged down by no less than three people, since I'm apparently invisible, even in full Victorian garb. Once I finally got our drinks, I returned to our table only to find a bill for $58 - for a freaking salad bar! Sixty bucks for a salad? Are you kidding me? I had yet to take a single bite, so I called over a waiter and asked him what was going on. Same one that told us the hors d'oeuvres were part of the party, only now he acted like I was dumb. Told him no way in Hell was I paying $60 for a salad bar. Especially since I hadn't even found the salad, only the hors d'oeuvres for the party. He called over a manager, and he told me that they weren't for us. What? We asked first!! Bitchy waitress chimed in and said we were picking food off other's plates.

Happy Hour is daily from 5pm-8pm in the bar and patio area.  \n\nFOOD: \nCaipirinha's (Kiwi and Strawberry) $5 each - their kiwi flavored sugar can liquor is so good!  The Caipirinha is Brazil's famous drink and I love it!! Its sweet and super strong.  I really liked the two separate flavors and it didn't hide the kick that you get lol My only problem I had with the Strawberry was that I would have loved if they strained the strawberry bits out.  Its kind of hard to drink when every two seconds I have to clear the straw.  \n\nChicken Tenders $5 - The chicken tenders are tender and moist ^_^ they make good tenders lol And they come with a side of Yucca Fries which I love.  I am a great lover of french fries and every time I have Yucca fries, I wonder how come other restaurants cant make them too!\n\nBrazilian Fish and Chips $4.50 - The fish was extremely moist and flakes really easily which is a good thing.  My only issue with this is that it has a fishy taste to it which makes me wonder how fresh it is. \n\nBrushetta $3.50 - You get four piece of brushetta topped with feta, tomato, and top with lemon dressing.  Its pretty good and the size of each brushetta is pretty large when most restaurant serve you something pretty small.  The only thing that could make this really good was that they need to toast the bread.  I love bread, I love bread that i just eat straight up with their crunch exterior and super soft chew interior... their brushetta was that but its not very stable when you're trying to lift it up to take a big bite when the lemon dressing is soaking through.  \n\nSausage & Yucca $5 - Yucca fries are the bomb! When we place this order, i thought were were going to get these chubby little sausages (no idea why i thought that lol) but what we got instead small little sausage slices (about size of nickels) that were sauteed crispy.  The flavor was good but was surprise that the form they came in.  Whats really good is if you take the slice sausages from this place and put them on the brushetta lol\n\n\nSERVICE:\nThe staff are very attentive ^_^ Since there wasnt any cocktail tables or bar stool open, they had set up two of their patio table behind the bar (small corner hidden behind the waterfall bar).  I think because we sat in this corner, we got better service lol cause the waitresses had to always remember to stop by. \n\nAnna, one of the owners and event planner, walks the restaurant and the bar area and checks on the guests as well.  She is actually the reason why my fiance and I booked our wedding dinner at their restaurant.  \n\nThe table next to us (the only other patio one in our little corner lol) had 3 guests that got their food quite quick but was missing their Caesars Chicken Salad (which looked pretty good and the size was large which I must remember to try next time).  The waitress apologized for the delay as there was a mix up in the kitchen and brought the salad ASAP.  Anna came by and offered them complimentary dessert for their delay on their one order.  I thought that was pretty nice since the guests didnt really seem to mind and that Anna was so quick to hear about it. \n\nWILL DEFINITELY BE BACK FOR HAPPY HOUR AND CANT WAIT FOR OUR WEDDING DINNER TO BE HELD THERE!!"

Unlimited sides were a nice touch, although they were out of yucca fries by 6pm, so we didn't get any :-(.\n\nWe paid for the upgrade so that we could sample all of the meat. I think we only counted 7 or 8 different meats, and the shrimp and ribs only came out once, so not sure if it is worth the upcharge or not.\n\nMy only complaint is that they had a wedding reception going on when we were there, and the music was extremely loud. Loud enough that it fought with the dining room music, and sort of put a damper on our ability to have conversation. \n\nDespite the minor inconvenience, we will be back."

The first had a coupon for themselves, good only for th two of them. That was fine. I ahd a coupon with a different deal good for me and up to 8 others I wanted to use for me and my friend. But because we were sitting at the same table they told us we could not use tow coupons. I explained clearly that I did not want any one of us to benefit from both coupons and that it was no different than if we just had them seat us at separate tables and they said sorry, not our policy. After much haggling we were allowed JUST THIS ONCE to use two coupons at one table. COME ON!"

            "review": "Our initial trip to this highly rated (Zagat) Churrascaria did not begin well when the greeter did not seat us immediately or even after 10 minutes despite the fact that we had a reservation.  Three parties who arrived after us were seated ahead of us. Explanation given was that they wanted to clear a nice table for us....hmmm.  A comped desert from the manager soothed our feelings however. \n\nThese style of Brazilian steakhouses which have sprung up around the country in recent years charge about $40 -$50 for an endless serving of 20 or 30 different types of grilled beef, lamb, chicken and fish. You basically strap on your feed bag and let 'er rip.  Quality of the meat in these establishments is hit or miss and quantity comes before quality here.  Lots of sides are included.  The meal is actually pretty good if you contain yourself and select the different cuts of meat wisely. At Via Brazil, we liked the filet mignon wrapped in bacon, the NY strip, the chicken drumsticks, the beef ribs, the flank steak, and grilled asparagus.  Suggest you avoid the garlic steak and tri tip -- tough and chewy during our visit. Some of the meats were over seasoned -- too salty -- and the cooks need to have slightly gentler hands on their salt shakers. \n\nA salad bar is included and I would say it was average at best and inferior to what we have experienced at Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil, two competitor chains. The selection of cold and hot salads was not as varied and numerous as we have seen elsewhere. The selections they did have were tasty and fresh however. \n\nOur party of three ordered the Sterling meal and the Prime meal plus an ala carte salad and fish entree.  The Sterling meal costs an extra 10 dollars and there are premium meat selections (lamb chops, shrimp, NY strip) that come with it. In my opinion, worth it. \n\nA pretty good meal and pretty good table service and I recommend Via Brazil without reservation.  Decent value for a good meal, not perfect but a nice restaurant nonetheless."

Odds are your taxi ride will cost more than the meal itself.  If you are sick of the buffets and looking for a meat coma, this is the place.\n\nWalking in, we felt we came under-dressed as the place had an upscale feel to it.  A nice place to go when you are all dressed-up  But Monday night seemed pretty slow and the few people there were all casually dressed.\n\nSalad bar had some interesting items such as carpaccio.  The quality of all the skewer meats we tried was excellent.  Every piece we tried was flavorful and amazingly tender.  While there are 18 choices offered on the menu, we maybe saw maybe 12 of those 18 rotating through (but again, that may have been due to it being a weeknight).\n\n18 styles of meat offered on the menu:\npork ribs\npork loin\nribeye\nsalmon\nsausage\nchicken drumsticks\nlamb chops\nturkey with bacon\nskirt steak\nsuckling pig\npicanha (top sirloin)\nchicken breast\nflank steak\nbeef ribs\ngarlic picanha\ntenderloin in bacon\nleg of lamb\nprime rib\n\nDesserts were top-notch as well.  I had the creme brulee which was a fairly large order and was probably one of the best I've ever tasted.  My friend had the coconut flan and that was an excellent choice as well.  Save room for dessert if you can.\n\nService was excellent (on the weeknight).  Skewers came by quickly and waiters came by frequently to refill drinks and ask if we needed anything.\n\nHighly recommended."

The main reasons for my ranking was due to the price and the taste of the poultry items and salmon.  The bacon wrapped turkey was horrible...dry and overly salty.  I usually go by the mindset that anything wrapped in bacon is awesome, but that did not hold true for that item!  All the chicken items I tried did not impress and I made sure to pass on them the rest of the night.  The salmon with their mango sauce was ok , but the salmon was dry and didn't have much flavor either.  Now, the red meat options were amazing and well seasoned and prepared.  From the bacon wrapped fillet to the flank steak I could not get enough of the red meat items.  The wait staff was very good and constantly providing clean plates.  The salad bar was your standard Brazilian fare with nothing special, but for $45 a plate I would expect a more robust salad bar and better tasting poultry items.  I've had much better options from Brazilian restaurants that charge $25-$30 per plate. And what the hell is with the garlic bread on a skewer?"

Everything was going fine till at the very end as I finishing up my final drink.  We ran individual tabs and I already paid my tab.  Apparently because I was one of the last to leave the table I was accosted by a Via Brasil employee about someone else in the group whom I did not personally know who did not pay her tab and the employee demanded me to pay her tab.  I told him I already paid mine and I shouldn't be penalized because of a deadbeat I didn't personally know.  Then I started being treated like I myself was a deadbeat because the whole staff subsequently circled me and threatened the police on me if I didn't pay.  I looked around and noticed everyone else in the group was gone.  I had no choice but to pay and I ended up doing so by slamming the money to pay for the deadbeat's tab on the table and I let them know that they were over the top on me and they don't care about potential future business they could have received from me.  I let the group leader know by email about the experience later that night and the next day she did meet me and paid me back, which was nice.  Over the next several days I called Via Brasil to speak with the owner to discuss my bad experience because the staff was so hard up about collecting the money from me even if I did not personally owe them that money...I was told each time the owner was not there and I left messages that went unreturned.  The same occurred with an email I sent to the owner.  Via Brasil should be ashamed for hiring people who will use extreme measures to get their money even from people who don't personally owe a tab left behind by someone else."

Then we received our check. They billed me for the whole table and again for my half of the bill. I understand it was busy but to try bully us out and then screw the check up. The check was over $250 plus another $125 not including the drinks we had waiting to get our table. We had our firm party here last year. Guess who is not coming back. Just to be clear we were just four adults quietly enjoying dinner."

However, the salad bar leaves a lot to be desired.  They also don't have very many choices of beef cuts.  Being that it's steakhouse, I was expecting more than what was offered. So basically, the menu is quite limited in my opinion.  I honestly don't see myself going back on my own dime - it's too pricey of a place to casually waltz in just to satisfy a craving.\n\nOverall, I remain team Texas de Brazil."

The hostess welcomed us, and wished my wife a happy birthday.  The service, as usual, was spot on.  The head waiter checked on us on a regular basis, making sure we had everything we wanted/needed.  The wait staff refilled our drinks without being asked to do so, and despite what others have said, the \"premium\" meats came by on a VERY regular basis.

Most of the meats too tough for my liking. \n\nAdd that with the slow service -- I was left waiting for more options with a green card flipped over.

            "review": "I try not to hand out 5 stars until I've consistently had a great experience. But this place is on track for the extra star, as based on our experience this weekend, the fella' and I will be back.\n\nWhen trying to pick out where to eat, I could tell that steak was what was calling to my dinner partner. He picked out this place, and we went on a whim. So Saturday evening, no reservation, we just walk up to the booth and ask for a table. Gal doesn't bat an eye, and offers us a table immediately. She does pause to check and make sure we're okay with a high traffic area next to the buffet, but we aren't picky and it was next to a beautiful towering wine rack.  \n\nDue to the odd location of our table, I think we were overlapped on our server, as we had two different guys coming by to check in and joke with us. They didn't overlap too much though and it just meant we had great service! \n\nI've never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse, so I can't compare with other places. But generally, the servers were super welcoming and informative, the salad bar average to good and ohmygosh the delicious meat just kept coming. They had certain items that kept swinging by, but the guys would also check in to see if we wanted to try anything specific off the menu. We had purchased the shorter list of meats, but we didn't even make it through the whole taster list. What I did try was delicious.\n\nI didn't knock any stars off for this next bit. I know that I tend to be a perfectionist, so don't expect any place to completely satisfy me. But, just in case, here's my 'eh' list. \n\n=The salad bar had some delicious items. (Charcuterie board/endive goat cheese) But there was a lot of stuff that I didn't try because I didn't want to fill up on average looking stuff. Not bad looking at all, just higher end average. Of what I did try, the only eh was the Greek Salad roll thing , which was kind of odd. The meat was actually kind of an afterthought and sort of hamburger like in consistency. \n\n=The Brazilian Sausage: Compared to all of the delicious cuts of meat, it was kind of tough and not worth the room it took up in my stomach. I think if it were part of a breakfast meal or an appetizer in another style restaurant, it would be really good, so this one's just a major personal preference. I can see why it's on the menu, it's just not for me. \n\n= The chicken was just a hair on the dry side. This is being super nitpicky though, as it had great flavor. Like, I wish that we weren't so full so I could have had a full piece instead of splitting it with my fella'. \n\nNow that the 'eh' stuff is out of the way, the great list:\n\n=The cuts of meat were tender, flavorful and even though we didn't bother getting any sauces, they stood well on their own. I especially loved the tri-tip, but everything we tried was a well made presentation of the cut. I enjoyed that they were easily able to give me medium rare and my fella' could get the disgustingly rare slices that he loves as we've had many struggles with those requests at lesser restaurants. Also, the bacon wrapped turkey is an unexpected treat, so even though it isn't a red meat, I'd highly recommend trying it. \n\n= The 'courtesy breads'/fired mozzarella, as well as the grilled mushrooms that we ordered as a side were tasty. I only regret that there is so much food I had a hard time eating more than a few bites of anything and tried so little from the side menu. \n \n=The Rigatoni Ala Vodka from the salad bar was spectacular. I love Vodka sauce and have had an 'eh' experience with a few higher end chain Italian place lately. My first bite was an entirely unexpected delight. I earnestly wished that I was just in an italian restaurant so I could devour a plate of the stuff, but sufficed with the token amount I'd procured to taste. \n\n= Service was amazing. I never lacked for food, water or attention. I also really loved the decor. Something about the large open space and pseudo-Greco Roman accents just vibed with me. Plus, in our little odd table, I felt like I had the whole place to myself and it was refreshing. \n\n=The dark Brazilian beer had a rich, full bodied taste. I was a little sceptical of a bottled beer, but I didn't regret choosing it over a glass of wine, as it had a great flavor that complimented the meats. \n\n=MMM! Passionfruit Mousse. It was the perfect end to the rich meal. Light, flavorful and it melted in my mouth. I was glad I had restrained myself from digging in so I could have a little space for a treat at the end."

I made reservations originally through opentable.com because I know how packed this place can get. Upon arriving my friend and I decided that we instead wanted happy hour. I couldn't do an all you can eat meat thing that late at night... The tabletops are seat your self kind of thing and our waitress was super nice! I loved how honest she was with certain items on the menu that we would get ready to order. Proceed with caution on a few of these things because it's not made the normal way you may think because they Brasil way has a twist. For example the crab cake that they offered is prepared in a way that isn't necessarily the cake form most people are use to. The Caipirinha is Brazil's national cocktail which reminds most people of the mojito! I'll tell you what, It's no drink for the lightweights! This drink offers a nice punch so be prepared if you want to indulge in a few because they WILL sneak up on you!  Happy hour has a wide variety of finer foods and also some entrees. The drinks though are limited to just the Caipirinha's.. Our food choices consisted of a few sliders (Angus & Filets) the Brazilian fried chicken and the blackened salmon dish that came with saut\u00e9ed spinach. Everything was delicious except the Brazilian fried chicken.. Overall everything was great and I have no found a new spot to add to my list for happy hour deals during the week!"

I also ordered a side of sauteed spinach which is my favorite and it was awesome. For dessert i tried the brazilian doughnuts; oh my they were delicious. Warm and soft and served with vanilla ice cream. After dinner the manager Anna came to check up on me and told me about their new lunch menu which i can't wait to try.

We agreed on all of the prices and everything was set in stone for my wedding reception. I gave her my credit card and asked her to charge the rest of my balance after I knew the final count. She responded to my email thanking me for giving her the credit card information and said she would charge my card. I was coming from Delaware so I wanted to take care of all of my payments before I arrived in Vegas so there wouldn't be any surprises. \n\n  All seemed to be going well during the reception. Everyone was having a good time and the waiters were attentive. All up until my brother comes up to me and tells me how they asked him for a credit card to pay. EXCUSE ME?? I went up to the manager and told him I paid Anna before I left. Oh, and where was Anna by the way? Not there of course. She didn't even show up to oversee anything. I told him I didn't bring my credit card with me. I thought all of this was already taken care of and my credit card info was in Anna's email. In the end, my parents had to give THEIR credit card info because I didn't bring mine stuffed in my dress (and mean, what did they think?) It was very upsetting and embarrasing. After emailing Anna the next day she tells me they don't normally charge your credit card until after the reception in case more people come than you plan. So why the hell didn't she tell me this?? Then I would bring my card with me!! The Dj ended up eating (and he was the only extra person we had) and of course we had no problem paying for him, but if they had just said that night \"We need (so and so) money for your DJ it would have been a hell of a lot easier than them saying \"We need thousands of dollars to pay for your entire reception party. It was very disorganized and handled completely incorrectly. And I still have yet to get a sincere apology out of anyone.     \n\n    I regret having my reception there and wish I had gone with Pampas on the Strip or El Segundo Sol. Both had excellent communication and were very helpful. Honestly, even if it's a little more expensive it's worth going with somewhere on the Strip because after paying for transportation for all of your guests to get all the way to Via Brasil it evens out anyway! Also worth noting, we had our welcome party at La Salsa Cantina and it was EXCELLENT! Great service, the sweetest people to work with, and we had a blast! I even paid a little too much on my deposit because we had less people than I anticipated and it was refunded within a day. \n\n   Oh and one more thing...They still owe me $100! They had me down as having an extra guest that I didn't have. After emailing them 3 times to tell them this I don't feel it's worth my time, but just thought I would note that screw up too!        \n  STAY AWAY!!"

But even when our cards displayed 'no meat' they still came around. The waiters were nice, and me not having been to a Brazilian Steakhouse before, when I asked what the meat was, they explained. We had a lot of talk with the waiter, because part of our group also came from Holland, and he talked with us and it was all a good time. \nI had two glasses of Chardonnay and it was a very good white wine, very soft and fruity. \nThe meat was amazing, I recommend you try the chicken hearts when you dine there, they are pure heaven. They have a lot of good stuff there, my advice is just try it out! At the salad bar I had gotten some cheese, and what I thought was meat, but it turned out the be cheese as well.
