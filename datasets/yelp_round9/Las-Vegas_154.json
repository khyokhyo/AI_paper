            "review": "Decent Italian at a decent price.  Off the strip, couple of miles south on LV Blvd, just a bit past the airport.  I can't speak to the claim that it is like \"old Las Vegas\" but the Bootlegger does provide good food and drink.  I had the chicken Saltimbocca and was very happy with it.  The side pasta with Alfredo sauce was a bit heavy with the richness of the cheese in the chicken, if I had it again, I might ask for red sauce or garlic & oil instead. Service for a group of eight (2 kids) was excellent and friendly.  I would certainly go back again."

            "review": "We came on a Wednesday evening because a contact lens company wanted to wine and dine us. For drinks, I had an Italian margarita. Appetizers, we had fried calamari and a fried vegetable platter. My entree was 16oz NY steak and shrimp scampi and my gf had the 10oz steak and shrimp scampi. For dessert, we had cheese cake and tiramisu! Full course! what what! haha\n\n- Easy parking. South of the strip. Near South LV outlets\n- Elegant vibe. Pianist playing classics. At one point, there was a live singer. I was surprised they did all this on a Wednesday. \n-  Great service. Multiple servers. Nice recommendations. Quick refills. \n- Italian margarita gave me a light buzz. Nice amaretto flavor, sweet and sour.  \n- Funny that we order American and not Italian. It's an Italian restaurant. \n- Calamari was average. Salty\n- Vegetable platter was good. I enjoyed the mushroom and zuchhini \n- I ordered my steak medium and it came to me medium-well. Fail. Gf ordered Med-Well, and it came well done. 2x fail. I guess next time I'll order med-rare to get med! haha\n- Otherwise, steak was seasoned nice. Not the best steak, but no real complaints\n- Scampi was amazing! Flavor was strong. Loved it. Wish it came with a bit more. I'm not sure if I'd pay $12 for it myself though. \n- The potatoes were presented in slices stacked on top of each other, which I have never seen before. Delicious taste and wonderful texture. \n- Cheese cake was ordinary. Far from Cheese Cake Factory. More like buffet-style cheesecake. \n- I had a great time. Nice ambiance. Video poker if you're bored. Good recommendation for a fancy dine out."

She approached the birthday girl in the middle of dinner asking for payment in cash ASAP because she was leaving. She also was fixing her hair in the mirror in the middle of our party which a lot of people noticed and also found tacky.  The food was ok. It's been better in the past.  I was disappointed. So, have a party somewhere else."

The eggplant was tender yet toothsome. And the marinara sauce oh oh! So good. The lasagne ... Some of the best I've had ever. I have eaten a few in my day. Our waiter Richard was spot on.  We each had red wine with dinner and the price was a little spendy. Over $70. We'll be back. They also do breakfast and lunch. Can't wait to try those."

This place is the talk of the town, so it's been on my list for a while now and I'm glad I was finally able to make that journey to the south end of Las Vegas Blvd.\n\nMy boyfriend and I turned it into a spur-of-the-moment date night, which are my favorite kind of date nights. At first glance, I was nervous that we were a bit underdressed in just t-shirts and jeans... (Y'know how some famous Italian joints can be)... The building had a string-lit courtyard and I could hear a live band covering ol' Blue Eyes from the parking lot, but to my surprise, this place is the classiest casual spot I've ever been to. I mean, it seemed to be the neighborhood's after-work spot, which makes me like it even more. Nobody cares which fork you use first!\n\nThe menu was incredible! Pricy, but there's so much to choose from. The boy and I decided to go out on a limb and try something new as an appetizer: Braised Pork Neck Bones. Tbh, it kinda weirded me out at first but the pork was so delicious and fell right off the bone, all while soaking in a flavorful broth that begs to be sopped up by toasted garlic bread. We also ordered classic bolognese and manicotti as our entrees, which were so yummy and came with the biggest portions - Perfect to take home and nuke for lunch the next day.\n\nAll in all, I'm a fan of the Bootlegger. Decent prices for delicious food. I'll be back!"

Rat Pack-ish...its what i expected out of a vegas italian joint - it did not disappoint."

The garlic bread is to die for! \n\nAll the servers and bartenders are super easy and helpful. We never had to ask for refills, they were always full. \n\nMy husband loves their alfredo with butterflied shrimp.. sometimes he will get chicken instead and always with a whole bowl of parmesan cheese. \n\nI heard Mondays were the busiest nights there since they do live shows."

We were told there was a 2+ hour wait if we didn't have a reservation so we would have to sit in the bar...where the bartenders are your server but they are completely overwhelmed and provide little to no service.  We had to get up and stand at the bar to get drinks refilled, to request the bill, etc.  While we're eating a party of 4 was waiting in the bar - they walked in and were seated without a reservation within about 30 minutes...ummm wow unbelievable.  Food was underwhelming.  The pizza bread bites were not fresh although they had good taste.  Chicken parmesan was nothing special and quite bland, eggplant fritti was blah.  Only good dish was the shrimp scampi.  Service is SO HORRIBLE.  No attempt to resolve, instead everyone we talked to just said we're really busy.  Glad you're so busy, but I'd tell any potential new customers to stay so far from this uninspiring dinning experience."

I got the worst case of the sh**s EVER from the linguini with clams. I guess I should know better than order a seafood special. It can sometimes mean \"please eat this, so we don't throw it all away\". The 3rd time I tried this place, was on a grave shift (mind you , this has been a while ago, and perhaps is not the same bartender) We were completely ignored for the ONE other patron. Had to beg for a drink, wait 45 for the food and beg for the check. I'm a bartender too...You missed out on a hell of a tip!"

He said there were no more menus and he was backed up but would come see us eventually. No pink lemonade or beers because their pipes were broken. I think our waiter is actually a bus boy. (103 Starsky) Ordered 2 double tall drinks.. I asked if they were talls and he clearly heard me and walked away. Charged for double talls  but received shorts. $16 each. Gave us our check 15 minutes ago, has yet to come back to take it. Had to walk to bar to get waters.. In short don't come here. Would have given 0 stars but that's not an option."

Made reservations through Open table and they called the day of to confirm. The restaurant itself is dark with a bit of an old school decor. Huge bar area separate from the main dining room. I loved all the old photos, of whom I assume are all family members. There's a piano in the main dining room but we were too early for the live music. \n\nLoved the garlic bread and sauce to start. I ate wayyyy too much of it and they happily brought us more. We chose the cheese ravioli and lasagna, both of which were delicious and tasted homemade and not frozen. Enjoyed the house salad, and had a delicious lava cake for dessert. \n\nI did mention my husband's birthday on the reservation and no one acknowledged it, but they did give us the dessert for free - it was taken off the check as \"Birthday dessert.\" I feel like fewer places are doing that these days. \n\nThey have what seems like great specials between 3 and 5 daily. They include a salad, lighter fare portion, and dessert, I think (not to mention that delicious bread) for $19. We'll be back to try it for a late lunch/early dinner!"

The singer will be performing at the Smith Center on August and I am going to make a point to hear him in concert again with friends. \n\nMy group had fettuccini Alfredo and egg plant Parmesan and we all had Mozzarella salads. My only comment on the food is the slice of tomato on the salad was flavorless. Now let me tell you about the bread they serve..,sooooo good! Served with marinara dipping sauce. Could be a meal on its own. \n\nWe didn't eat dessert, well we will be back and leave room for dessert. Total cost $150 for 4 people with wine and salads. Best Italian meal we've had in Las Vegas."

We arrived there at about 10 PM after watching the David Copperfield show at MGM Grand.  The restaurant was not crowded and we had no problems getting seated.\n\nSomeone else mentioned on here that it took a while for the food to come out but the wait was worth it.  They were correct.  The food was EXCELLENT!  Everyone enjoyed the entrees they ordered and the appetizers and dessert were just as good.  Our waitress informed us that everything was freshly made and that is why it took so long for the food to come out.  She was an excellent waitress and as we were in no hurry, waiting for the food just allowed us more time to enjoy one another's company.\n\nThanks to the reviewer who informed us it would take a while for the food to come out.  Thus, we scheduled dinner after the show because of this.  \n\nOur thanks to all of the posters on Yelp.  It made planning for our trip seamless!"

The service was slow but in a relaxing way because we weren't in a rush and it meant all of the food was fresh. The food wasn't spectacular but it was very good and above average for sure. It was a nice option for a meal off the strip. \n\nAs much as I enjoyed my dish, I will say the lasagna was the way to go. I can definitely see why they call it their house specialty. I ordered the pollo Francese which came with a side of fettuccini Alfredo. Really enjoyed the light white wine sauce and the chicken was a thicker cut of breast than usual but saut\u00e9ed well. The fettuccini was thankfully on the lighter side of takes on pasta with Alfredo sauce. Not the most memorable meal we had but surely one we enjoyed."

Ordering Mid-rare and getting one under or one over can be ok, but taking it to well is just gross. I didnt say anything to her, not sure why.\n\nThis time was around by boyfriend wanted to go. Im always happy to give second chances. Although I love the \"were keeping it old vegas look\" food just mediocre, and service was almost non-existence. \n\nI had my camera out and was taking pictures of my man when our server asked if we wanted a photo together, mind you we wernt dressed to impress so I  said no, any girl would we looked like shit. Our server nearly insulted us by assuming we were \"hiding\" or \"cheaters\" when we didn't want a photo and kinda chucked away. WTF. Anyways to food and drink.\n\nDrinks: BF-MAKERS OLDFASHION (just ok, think they added sugar?!)\n              ME-MAKERS MANHATTAN UP (delicious)\n\nAPS: CALAMARI- very nice\n          EGGPLANT FRITTI- Love eggplant but breading on it sucks.\n          MUSSELLS DIAVALO- eh. Not good. Too much tomato sauce.\n\nThey served the same marinara sauce with the bread( which was good), the calamari, the eggplant fritti, and I swear they just dumped the same sauce over the mussells and heated it.\n\nWe wern't going to get an entree but I was still hungry and we didn't have anything to cook at home so I got a pasta. \n\nPASTA: BUCATINI W PANCETTA, PEAS, AND CARBONARA-not bad. Hey I am no aficionadoon pasta but I didnt think that the bucatini was a right choice for this pasta, I meant a bucatini would hold a chunky meat sauce so much better than a no so thick carbonara. Overall it was yum, I took it home to finish:)\n\nProbably not going to give it another whirl, I am not a food snob I just know whats good and what I like. I dont discourage others to eat here, there are tons of people I know who love this place, for me its just not my style. CIAO"

The family pictures give a sense of being at grandmas house for some good home cooking.  \n\nThe inside of the restaurant has pictures of Sinatra and the Rat Pack all over.  There's also a piano and someone singing live most evenings.  The servers are properly trained and know what they're talking about.  Wine menu includes everything you might need and the mixed cocktails are strong.\n\nBut the food is what blew me away!  I can make a meal out of their breadsticks alone.  They're lightly brushed with oil and garlic and served with marinara.  I decided to get spaghetti with meatballs and it was just perfect.  They used a bolognese sauce instead of marinara and it complimented the pasta really well.  The best part is soaking up the sauce with the bread at the end.  Also decided to order the tiramisu as it was recommended and it was a great end to a perfect meal.  \n\nI'm a fan and have added Bootlegger to my Vegas favorites"

However the manager needs to take a lesson in customer service.  He could learn to smile and be less abrasive.  \n\nOur service again was incredibly good. Vito didn't miss a thing. He was attentive and didn't miss a thing.  \n\nThe food was hot and delicious.  Everyone loved it. The large appetizers samplers are $22.00 and can easily serve 4. The chicken picada is excellent.  \n\nThis place is quite pricey but the ambiance is perfect for a Italian romantic dinner date."

The only down side was they charged a gratuity for my party of 8. To me, that's incentive not to give good service because you get a automatic tip. So with that said our service was just ok and could have been much better."

Even when i know I cannot give my best, I make the effort to make sure I own the guest and accomidate them as much as possible.  My performance directly effects my lively-hood!  I may not be a consistent guest of the Bootlegger Restaurant but I have been eating there and brought several guests with me since they were at their old location on Tropicana and Eastern Ave.  From now on . . . I will not refer anyone to the bar whether it is shift change or not.  I came in on a Sunday afternoon at 4pm.  I asked about happy hour and food service at the bar.  The host having no knowledge of the happy hour menu directed me to the bar (totally ok with because I too am a bartender).  I asked the lovely brunette bartender if I could sit at one of the hightop tables - yes was the answer.  I asked about happy hour and dinner food service at the bar - she specified nothing other than she would get me a food menu.  I asked for a wine menu which she got. I waited 10min. to order and I had to step to the bar to order.  I just went downhill from there.  Her replacement Diane came in who was very nice but neither of them were attentive either in taking my order, following up to see if I needed anything, which I had to approach the bar to do (the only thing I asked for was extra vinegar for my caprese salad) and the bar was empty aside for some return guest from the brunettes home town.  Did I mention that when I asked her if I could get another glass of wine for my dinner, her reply was that legally she couldn't serve me because of being off the clock.  This I understand but it didn't stop her when she sat with her friends from her hometown and served them after I had placed my order.  I still had to ask Diane for another glass of wine.  My entree was dropped not even halfway through my salad so by the time I finished my salad, my food was totally cold.  Did I fail to mention that neither the food runner, busser, bartender asked me if I needed anything or even if the food was ok?  I had to ask to have my plates cleared.  During the hour and a half I spent there . . . I have always boasted about the food, since I was a kid.  The service in the dining room has always been great.  I guess that is where I will make the effort to sit from now on.  Bummer!"

The night we were there, they had a piano player (the vocalist who was scheduled to perform never showed up by 6:30 when we were finished eating even though she was supposed to go on at 5:30).\nThe Food: The food service starts with delicious hot bread on the table. It is accompanied by a red dipping sauce (don't remember what it was - just that it was very tasty). Very good and very easy to fill up on the bread if you are not careful. My wife and I decided to share the wedge salad to start. While I frequently get a wedge to start a meal, this had to be the biggest wedge I have ever seen. It was loaded with bacon pieces and lots of tomato with a good bleu cheese dressing. Very delish. Based on several of the reviews on Yelp, we decide to share the meat lasagna. The portion was huge - definitely dinner for two if you like to share. Lots of meat, lots of cheese. This was good but not great. We came to celebrate a birthday. Our waiter brought over a slice of delicious chocolate cake (see the photo - nice presentation). We also got an order of 3 cannolis (we were a party of 5 - one slice of cake wasn't going to make it around the table for a taste!). Also excellent.\nThe Service: Our waiter came to the table almost immediately. Since we were first timers, he gave us some of the history of the restaurant and some recommendations on the food. The waiter, busboy and food runner were all very attentive. The food came out well timed. 5 star service.\nThe Ambiance: We came in as a party of 5. They honored our reservation - a major plus in my book. As I said, the flavor of the restaurant is definitely \"Old Vegas\". The tables are very nicely spaced so you are not on top of the next table (there were some very long large tables in the main room that I assume were for large parties rather than strangers forced to dine together family style). Having a pianist playing background music was delightful.He was very good even without the vocalist).\nI really enjoyed my dining experience at Bootlegger and will definitely return. I was torn between giving a 4 star and a 5 star review but rounded down because of the missing vocalist and because the lasagna just didn't make the 5 star mark. But it was close."

Both dishes were great! They were both on the richer, heavier side, so if you go, go hungry. We also both had the minestrone soup, which was delicious and hearty, and the bread bites they bring with marinara was a great touch.\n\nIf you want old Vegas feel with quality food, go to this place ASAP.

That alone makes this a great spot.\n\nThere's a nice bar area and then a large restaurant area complete with old-school Vegas lounge singers during certain times. The atmosphere is just fantastic. Just dark enough, those great curved booths, waiters wearing ties, lots of families and couples, etc.\n\nThe bread that each table automatically gets was delicious. Little square bites that were very buttery with some garlic. And served with a great red sauce for dipping (definitely not a marinara).\n\nWe opted for pasta dishes, of course. The basic spaghetti with meat sauce and the salmon on a bed of penne pomodoro. I was a bit confused when no sides were offered for the spaghetti (even though it says it comes with one at the top of the menu). And then with the salmon, I was asked if I wanted pasta or a potato. Well, since it is supposed to be a pasta dish, why would I get the pasta? But alas, I didn't question it and didn't say anything when the food arrived - I had no pasta on my plate, just a piece of salmon and a baked potato. Thankfully, the salmon was delicious and cooked perfectly. And while basic, the spaghetti with meat sauce had a good flavor. \n\nThe waiter was very nice and checked on us several times. And despite it being packed, we never felt rushed.\n\nThis is definitely a place worthy of a repeat visit. Both a great place for a date and to take family visiting from out-of-town."

I like the Panetti bread that they serve, especially after a late night and cocktails!  I am a consistent cat, and always get the same item; the saut\u00e9ed Italian greens, they are always, always amazing and prepared fresh.  \n\nI like the old mafia vibe while dining, and the staff is super friendly and always willing to accommodate, this place reminds me of the east coast in a good small town way.  \n\nIt is a lovely casual bar, I am always happily surprised at the friends I run into there.  \n\nMajor drawback, they don't have avocado? w.t.f., I like salad.  I have also only been here between 2am-6am, so graveyard is obviously when I recommend for, I can't speak for the regular people hours of operation."

Served with a fatter than normal spaghetti noodle! Would have love larger pieces of pancetta, but it was more of a bacon crumble. Clearly the chef's spin on the dish.\n\nService was attentive, no complaints there. \nLoved the live music! I would go back just to hear the old \"rat pack\" style music being sung live.\n\nThey do dinner specials from 3PM-5PM - too early for us.\nBut maybe just perfect for you.\n\nOver all - A great evening!"

I have been to many different Italian Restaurants in my lifetime but NEVER EVER have I been to one that gave you a plate of spaghetti with ONE little meatball! That is not Italian. Italians are very generous with their portions and give you either two or three good size meataballs! The guy who sat us needed some lessons in customer service. He had no personality whatsoever! My husband is really outgoing and greets everyone with a smile. This guy that seated us had the most deadpan facial expression I have ever seen in my life. I read some of the reviews and wondered if maybe the ones that gave this restaurant 5 stars were friend or relatives of the owners of this place. I just don't get it.\nThe food was nothing to rave over and the service was just average. I'm sure I will not be returning to this place. If you want a nice place for good Italian food and more than one meatball go to Dean's place or Minutos!"

After a long day of paper work and packing, we wanted something small and not too expensive which is why we skipped eating on The Strip. \n\nWhen I see a place is open 24/7, I'm not expecting fine dining prices EVER. Unfortunately, the prices aren't listed on Yelp and we didn't see a menu outside. If I had known that chicken fettuccine alfredo was $19, there's no way I would have stepped foot in the place. \n\nThe lobby looked extra upscale, but the mannequin of a guy sitting at the counter scared me when I walked in. We showed up at 10:30 PM, so yeah, it was late and I was tired. \n\nOnly the bar area was open this late. There were some obnoxious people at the bar being loud, but I guess that's what you expect in Vegas on a Saturday night, I just wasn't expecting that with how fancy the lobby was. \n\nThe prices are insanity. I told my boyfriend that I was uncomfortable ordering anything, so we decided to split. He ordered the fettuccine alfredo and when prompted if we'd like salad, he said \"yeah.\" I told the waiter to just bring us a wedge salad ($9). \n\nAfter we ordered, they brought us bread squares and a thin red dipping sauce that was good. I've never seen bread served like this so I wonder if it's made in house or if it's frozen and heated in the oven. It still tasted good. \n\nThe wedge salad comes with \"Maria's\" blue cheese dressing. I wonder if it's the same as \"Marie's\" blue cheese dressing from the cold section of the grocery store. There must have been half a jar poured on our salad - it was swimming in dressing. There was maybe 2 teaspoons of bacon on it.. Brio makes a much better, fresher and flavorful wedge and you get a lot more actual blue cheese crumbles and bacon on it. \n\nSometime between the salad and the entree, they turned out the lights completely so we ate in the light of the bar tvs. \n\nThe fettuccine alfredo came out with a nice looking pounded chicken breast on top. Unfortunately, the sauce was flavorless. For $19, that better be some of the best fettuccine alfredo that I've ever tasted. This was not. I took a few scoops and let my boyfriend eat about 3/4 of the dish. My non-Italian mom makes killer alfredo, so why can't this joint do that? Disappointing. \n\nOur waiter was very good, but the food was lacking, it was extremely overpriced and we were sitting in the dark during our meal. This is not my idea of fun. \n\nWhen we got up to leave, the front door was locked and it had a sign that said exit through the bar. We ended up on the patio and then figured out where the exit was. Embarrassing! I did notice all of the couples we walked past were also sharing one entree. It's just too expensive!"

The server was friendly and attentive but the food wasn't anything special.  I had some chicken and artichoke pasta dish.  I had to really add a lot of salt, no flavor and the chicken was rubbery.  The sauce was watered down and lacked flavor.  My dad and fiance didn't care for their meal either.  I thought the entrees were high in price for the value and quality of the food.  If you're looking for SUPERB Italian food at comparable prices, drive south on LVB to Marinelli's at M Resort and Casino (about 3 miles) and you'll fall in love with the fresh, decadent food."

The card was our choice of a free app or bottle of wine. We were seated right away which was great because I was cold from walking in a dress and heels to the place and was pleased to get to sit right away. It is a 24 joint with a wonderful atmosphere. I loved hearing the singer/piano player throughout the meal. There were several groups there for birthdays and such and he sang to them. The table next to us had several people at it and they must have ordered a whole cheesecake for the birthday girl. We chose the wine even though the waiter said he recommended the apps and said the wine was bad. I disagreed and enjoyed it. We chose a white Chardonnay. Maybe he just thought it was cheap but I liked it and my husband didn't complain. It was a wonderful pregame to the Silverton we were going to after dinner. The waiter told us about our favorites and said if we came with the classics on our mind that was fine but that they had some unique things too. I went with one of the unique ones and it was yummy. I don't remember the name of it but it was a chicken rolled in salami with cheese and came with a nice side of pasta Alfredo. I loved it but didn't finish. My husband got the Lasagna and liked it too. I didn't bother tasting his because mine was so good but offered him some so he could try it.He liked it too. I just had a wonderful time getting buzzed and enjoying the scene while eating one of my favorite types of food-Italian! Price wise-not cheap not expensive. Depending on what you got it could be expensive but my dish was $24 for the unique dish. Rick's was less for the typical dish. We enjoyed the free wine greatly and was too full for dessert. The cheesecake from the other table was tempting however."

The pasta was rolled around the meat, with the sauce compacted onto one side of the dish. We didn't find the meat until we had eaten all the sauce, so we were left with a pile of pasta and dry meat. It was unappetizing. \n\nI also had a turkey sandwich, which was fine, as far as turkey sandwiches go.

It's delightfully pleasant, and the music with the singers makes me feel good .  They play anywhere from Sinatra to Mario Lanza and just classic melodies paired with decent Italian dishes.  5 stars all the way- tip them if you enjoy it music.\n\nI've been here a few times, sometimes to host, sometimes just to have a meal to satisfy the big appetite.  Think American portions with a flare of Italian to it.  Here's an example, the little bread knots that come out is drenched in butter, a bit of garlic, but still eat them.\n\nThe pappardelle bolognese, thick egg noodles, filled with ground beef, thick red sauce and a very filling dish.  If you're feeling up to you, add a side of meatballs, it's overload, but I've devoured that meal on a hungry night.  This is my favorite dish.  4 stars.\n\nOther times, I have ordered the lasagna, a little different than you traditional layers of pasta.  Individual sized dish, with the lasagna baked into every dish, a massive amounts of cheese and meat.  Can be a bit salty, with a overload of carbs, fats and protein.  3 stars.\n\nI don't recommend their white pinot noir house wine, because didn't go well with my food.  I couldn't finish the glass.  To each's own.  1 star.\n\nCome with great company, enjoy massive amounts of food, not the most authentic Italian taste, but still decent.  If you want to sit in the main room, make sure you make reservations, because it can get pretty packed.  Read their history on their menu, it's a pretty interesting one."

It gave me that old Las Vegas feel which made the entire dining experience just great. We walked to the front & a young Man by the name of Roman assisted us to our table. He had to be the most sharp knowledgable young man I have ever encountered. We asked him what is good on the menu & he gave us several suggestions ... It was apparent he was very aware of everything on the Bootleggers Menu. We ended up playing the safe route and went with the classic spaghetti!! Amazing, Roman had told us that the meatballs were some of the best in town & he was not wrong. The brief encounter we had allowed our family to enjoy the meal & the priceless ambiance of the Bootlegger Bistro."

We were anticipating some amazing old school Italian food, as we are big Anthony Bourdain fans and if Anthony Bourdain featured this restaurant on his show, we figured we were sure to have some sort of sublime tastebud experiences. \nWhen we walked in, the hostess gave us a chilly look and said, \"Do you have a reservation?\" in a snotty voice. To which we responded, \"No.\" She acted annoyed, even though the place was about 1/2 full, if that. And come on, honey, it's a Monday night, and it's Nevada. Whatever.\nThe waiter was similarly standoffish, but warmer than the hostess. I ordered the primavera. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper, and it was still pretty bland. I figured since I ordered a vegetarian dish, maybe I'd ordered the wrong thing. But my other buddy had the meat lasagne, which, seriously, is a dish that's tasty at 80% of all Italian restaurants one would eat at. Not so much with his. He barely finished it, and he usually eats like a horse.\nFood was not disgusting, just ok. Again, may I say bland? Unimpressive? Weak? I actually didn't see the episode where Anthony Bourdain ate here. I will lose the respect I have for him if he ate here and said, \"That's good.\" \nBootlegger: That's not good."

Our group of 6 walked in and said hello to the two people at the desk (The tall skinny kid and a blond lady). They literally looked at me, didn't say a word and began talking to each other. No hello, no Ill be right with you, just completely ignored. \n\nWe were finally seated after they were done with their conversation. There was a large party of 20-25 people right in the middle of the restaurant. This group was very loud and disturbing the entertainment of the singer and piano player. They should have been sat in the back room so not to disturb the other diners. \n\nOut of our group of 6 only 1 liked their dinner. We had a large pizza, veal parm, NY steak (2) and osso bucco. The pizza was terrible, the osso bucco was like none I had seen before. Very small over cooked pieces of meat instead of a large veal shank. Neither person cared for their steak either. The lava cake for dessert was super rich and not enjoyable. \n\nNot sure what happened to this place. Just a bad night? I hope so but for the prices they charge the food and hospitality did not come close. Will be taking a break from here for a while."

Let just say I am a true Vegas fan. \n\nBack to the topic at hand: Bootleggers. \n\nI am a fan of as well and would visit this restaurant again. This was one of the restaurants we found that was open late hours and when you are in Vegas, partaking in Vegas activities, late dining will occur. \n\nWhen we drove into the parking lot, the restaurant had curb appeal and we were happy we found a descent place. Once you go in, the inside decor and ambiance was very different from what the outside appearance will have you believe. First, not sure if it was because it was  late, but when we enter the bar area, it was dark. It was really dark. Reminded me of some secret hiding place one will arrange to meet up. Like an old mafia style movie. \n\nOur waiter was the bartender so service was a little bit slow. But his personality and attentiveness made up for his slowness. \n\nThe menu has typical Italian meals and is decently priced. The food was good. I ordered the lasagna and although I have tasted some delicious lasagna, I can say it was decent, filled with seasoned meat and flavorful red sauce. Mama would be proud! \n\nI will definitely eat again at this restaurant and recommend it to anyone looking for a late night dinner in Vegas."

Aside from the typical cafes at the casinos, this is a pretty chilled place with classic Italian food. They've been opened 24/7 since the 1940s. A definite mom n pops shop kind of restaurant/bar. \n\nI had the cheese and meat ravioli with their special sauce. It's good and there's no complaint but of course I'm not like blown away. I would say that they're classic comfort Italian food. Aside from this we also had the steak & eggs with potatoes. This on the other hand was pretty amazing. The potatoes were well seasoned (herbs). Steak was pretty well marinated. A definite good breakfast. This is way better than Denny's or Ihops quality for sure.\n\nBasically a nice place to chill in the wee morning that is off the strip. Very laid back with awesome people and service. If you don't want fast food or pay for those overpriced cafes...then this is the place to crash."

Once the bartender dude glanced at my phone and saw my two star review he avoided me like the plague; I had to ask the runner for more garlic bread, hence the downgrade to one star.

Oddly, it's also open 24 hours; however, I've only been for lunch once and dinner several times. \n\nMy friend loved her Seafood Diablo, appetizers are good, shrimp was amazing I don't know what they do to it but it's awesome,  wine is always good :), osso buco got an A in my book.

However, the prices on the menu fooled me into thinking I would be getting something amazing. I ordered the spinach alfredo primavera and my husband ordered the lasagna. Because of allergies, I asked the waiter to exclude pine nuts from my pasta, but this request was not granted. \n\nIt only took about 5 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food. Although this is usually it good thing, it was evident that it was already made and just put on a plate. This is exactly how it tasted. We truly expected to wait a bit and enjoy the music from the harpist, but we had no wait.  When the food is delivered, I instantly noticed the pine nuts and didn't bother complaining. I took a bite without devouring a pine nut and I was interested in correcting my order because it tasted bland and old. I feel like that plate is a joke, just offered in case a vegetarian shows up. It came with vegetables that were soggy and candied red peppers. These candied peppers actually made me chuckle because I never expected to see them in the pasta. \n\nAlright, alright, I will calm down. Now onto the lasagna. There was nothing really terrible about the lasagna. It was pre-prepared and tasted like \"mom's\" left overs. They cut a really thin slice and laid it on it's side, similar to how a cake wedge on it's side would be. Each bit contained a different bite of the lasagna, either all ricotta or beef. I don't agree with the presentation of the dish, but it was definitely the delicious. \n\nMy husband and I ended up sharing the lasagna and did not touch the spinach alfredo anymore. We were still hungry and finally got to my favorite portion of the meal. Tiramisu!!! This was delicious, moist, and just the perfect amount of coffee flavor. The display was beautiful and I am craving it now as we speak. We ate dessert and listened to the most amazing harpist I have ever heard, Mariano! \n\nI will be back, but I will come for desserts and awesome music. I'll be skipping the overprice pre-prepared main course."

            "review": "I find this restaurant utterly intriguing in theory. It is a 24 hour establishment known for its \"old-style Vegas\" vibe. There's not much of that sort of thing going on out here, so I was game.\n\nBooze and the promise of good \"red sauce\" Italian-American eats (plus a Groupon) brought me to the Bootlegger late the other night. Overall, I think this is a solid 3.5 star place.\n\nThe hot, fresh garlic bread was a hit. I thought the red sauce served along side was just a tad thin and missing an ingredient or two. Not a bad base sauce, but not bursting with flavor. The bread was a perfect accompaniment to the big ol' cocktails we started off with.\n\nOur hot Antipasto appetizer came out very quickly, was nicely presented and of a good size for two. I truly enjoyed the toasted meat ravioli (but again with the lackluster side dish of red sauce) and wished there had been more of that and less of the other two selections. The calamari was just okay. The shrimp scampi was rubbery and really didn't have any taste at all despite the pool of buttery sauce. I don't quite understand how scampi sauce can not taste like anything- it's garlic and butter! Two of my favorite things, together in a bowl. I could not taste any garlic nor butter. I really wonder what's in that sauce; it could have been yellow water for all I know. I took a bite of one shrimp and let my less discriminating husband polish off the rest of it. \n\nFor our entrees, we both had veal scalloppini with fettucini alfredo. The veal medallions were tender and tasty, with sauteed mushrooms mixed in. I got the impression that the sauce from the veal was a slightly modified version of the alfredo sauce on the (nicely al dente) pasta. There was very little distinction of the flavors, though both sauces were passably good (better than the red, for sure). Maybe a little bit of salt and definitely some fresh grated parmesan would have set the dish off. The portion size was just right and left us with just enough room to share an outstanding and large slice of tiramisu. \n\nThe staff and service were fine, not over the top, but attentive/friendly enough for me. I did like the dark, fairly romantic atmosphere and oversized leather booths. The Bootlegger reminded me a lot of some of my old Italian spots in New York, which is nice. The meal felt expensive, even with the Groupon, so I don't know how often I'd make a special trip for these hit-or-miss eats, but it's always handy to know about an extra late night choice."

            "review": "I didn't know where to take my stepdad for dinner and saw this little Italian Restaurant.  I was expecting a restaurant but after entering the door, there was a bar with TV and was almost confused.  Part of the restaurant looked very elegant, from the tables and chairs, and decor looking like it came from the Queens dining room.  But then part of the restaurant had a English pub feeling to it.  Another hiccup I had was the very dim lighting in the restaurant.  My stepdad had to complain to me about how he couldn't read his menu.  It could be his old age or I might have to agree that the lighting was the problem.\n\nWe sat down and since we were only looking to eat light, ordered salads.  My stepdad ordered the Iceberg Wedge.  It had, as per the menu, \"Wedge of iceberg lettuce, crispy pancetta, scallion, chopped egg, tomato concasse topped with Maria's bleu cheese dressing.  I ordered Isalata di Casa.  It's prepared, as per the menu, Endive Saald with candied walnuts, gorgonza chees, shaved pear, tossed in house vinaigrette dressing.\n\nAfter we got our salads, my stepdad looked at his and looked at mine.  He looked a little disappointed and as a good daughter, I suggested we switched.  It was a little hard to part ways with my Insalata Indivia because it looked amazing.  But I wanted to make sure my stepdad had a good time.  Tasting the Iceberg Wedge, I  regretted swapping my salad instead of asking the waiter to change my order to the Insalata Indivia.  Maria's bleu cheese dressing combined with all the other ingredients was just too rich and too much to handle.  I almost wanted to throw it in the trash if there was one next to me.  There was just too much going on with the salad.  Luckily, I was able to taste the Insalata Indivia and was very impressed with it.  The colors and the flavors combined were perfect.  It was simple and was perfect for my pallet."

The linguini with clam sauce is awesome. I ordered a ravioli with cream sauce and grilled chicken breast, OMG it is to die for. I come here for dinner whenever I'm l\nlas Vegas. The price for 2 people (dinner) including 2 well drinks, an appetizer and 2 main course for $80. The service is good but there's room for improvement. The atmosphere is casual Italian dining."

The main restaurant is good sized and comfortable, complete with old-school Vegas lounge singers during certain times. The atmosphere is just fantastic. It's just dark enough with comfy curved booths.\n\nThey serve bread almost automatically when your seated. They call them Panetti's and they are one of my favorite things!  Panetti's are little square bites and are usually very garlicky and buttery. They serve them with a special red sauce for dipping. It's definitely not just a plain marinara. \n\nThe Fettuccine Alfredo is one of my all time favs. The alfredo sauce is SO delicious, tastes fresh and seems like it's made from scratch.  If it isn't, I better not find out where they buy it.  Because if I can buy it, I may never go out to dinner again.  My guy loves their lasagna, which doesn't come the way most of us would expect. They make HUGE pans of this layered goodness and serve big slices of it on it's side covered with red sauce.  But on this night, my guy had the house salad and the Pork Chop Marsala, a 12 oz. bone-in pork chop in Marsala mushroom sauce, served with rustic roasted potatoes and broccoli.  He was in heaven!  The pork was cooked the way he ordered it, and was moist and tender. I know, because I HAD to try some, of course!  \n\nOur waiter, was on top of things and very friendly to us. Eddie, our busser was a great guy! I had asked him some random questions and he was so helpful and nice to talk with. Throughout the evening I saw him interacting with numerous costumers and he always had a smile on his face. He's clearly a hard worker and takes pride in what he does.    \n\nAs a lifetime local I highly recommend you taking the time to try this old-school Vegas treasure."

            "review": "What a disappointment! Maybe this review is biased but I'll tell you why and let you take it into consideration. Las Vegas is my hometown, I moved away several years ago but my family is still there and I return a few times a year. After my father sold his restaurant my family would go to the Bootlegger Restaurant when it was located on Eastern Avenue. I always enjoyed their food. That location closed and they are now the Bootlegger Bistro on the south strip. The first time I went there it was for lunch on a Saturday with the entire family....my sister and her kids, my brother with his wife and kids and myself. We were all seated in a party room but they never told us that the \"sisters\" would be rehearsing their lounge show singing act. It was loud and they couldn't sing very well, not a good experience. My brother apologized because he highly recommended this place and said their food was worth it. The food was pretty good still but listening to the sisters still gets a laugh when ever I bring it up. We've had other meals at the Bistro over the years and seemed to be going down hill over the years until the last time. \n\nWhen my (then) girl friend and I decided to return to our hometown and get married last January we settled on having the reception at the Bootlegger Bistro, not only because my family had been meeting there for years but because one of the part owners was a high school friend of both of ours. On the night of our reception the service was rushed and rude at the begining when they were serving drinks. At one point my wife was standing in the way of one of the servers while serving a drink and the drink ended up on my wife's wedding dress. The server looked at her like it was her fault for not getting out of her way. The food took forever to be served, I think it was because the drinks were seperate and they were trying to make more money out of my guests. We finally got served. I had the Seafood Fra Diavlo. I only got half way through my meal and had to run to the bathroom. Later I heard that others had the same symptoms, needless to say it wasn't a good experience on my wedding night and for a few days after. Because they were late in serving dinner they rushed into clearing the dinner plates before people were done eating. Maybe that was a good thing. \n\nThe part owner of the Bistro was also a friend of a few of our guests so when we arrived we all asked if Ron was there. We was there but after waiting to see him all evening he couldn't pry himself away from his band and recording studio to say hello to his old friends. I dropped over $1000 in his restaurant, got sick in his bathroom and he didn't have the common courtesy to say hello. I held off on writing this review because I didn't want to write angry. It's been almost 10 months and I can't wait anymore. I'm Italian and I guess some things I won't get over. If you are thinking about having you're special dinner at this place be warned.....they don't care about anything but your money."

We were greeted with warnings from the staff that the kitchen was slow.  Seems that a lot of their kitchen staff had recently walked out do to a request for higher pay after being on one of the TV shows. The meals we ordered were fantastic so they must still have some of the good staff. \n\nIt was a bit pricey for my tastes and we were scoping them out as a possible after weeding meal place.  We may go back for that meal as they did give us a buy one get one coupon.  \n\nIf you don't mind paying a bit more, I would truly recommend their food and ambiance.  Hopefully they will have worked out the kitchen staffs attitude and patron's won't be required to wait so long."

We got in fairly late and so strolled around 9:30pm.  Because it was so late, we were set in a dining area right next to the bar which was fairly busy and so a bit noisy (main reason for 4 stars instead of 5).  That being said in the main dining room they had a pianist/singer who was very reminiscent of the Rat Pack in their heyday.\n\nWe were a party of three and ordered two of the chicken parmesan with their house made Bolognese and angelhair pasta.  I ordered the pappardelle with the rose sauce (bolognese with cream) which was insanely delicious and rich.  The portions were large and we all took left overs.  The scrumptious bread likely didn't help.  I also ordered a blood orange Cosmo which was tasty and strong.\n\nWe were too full to order dessert but the double espresso and cappuccino were nice.\n\nThe bill was $100+ and worth every penny.  We will make sure we return when we visit Vegas again."

            "review": "Five stars for my entree! The first impression of the restaurant tells me we would be coming back each time we visit Vegas. I think the name did it too. Our friend's Uncle introduced this place. We came here for late lunch/early dinner, so the place was a bit quiet but it was great to have the restaurant all to ourselves and a few others. There's a Harp player entertained us on the stage, nice! It's a dim light place with cozy atmosphere, surrounded with maroon color. We were seated at the booth, very comfy! We ordered a seafood platter to start: calamari, shrimp, ravioli all together on a big plate. We also had a caesar salad to share. It seems like everywhere we go these days we can't help but ordering a caesar salad to start. Something we love to try in many places. So, for those restaurants that are out of caesar salad, you're out of luck! Anyway, after all that, hubby had his eggplant parmesan and I had my favorite spaghetti with clam sauce and I asked them to make me a spicy one with red sauce. My God! They listened! And they listened well! On top of their listening skills, they also made me the best mouthwatering red sauce that is out of this world. You gotta try this one if you love spaghetti red sauce with clam taste. Usually I would order seafood with red sauce but this one had major clam taste. They chopped those clams and also gave me enough clams on the shells, so my spaghetti was swimming with clam red sauce, killing the swimming team of the Olympic! OK, just order that. I'm a red sauce drinker! I mean eater! So, when a restaurant makes me red sauce for my spaghetti, I'm a bit picky because I taste many different red sauces all my life. This one was really good. The seafood platter was just OK but my entree was terrific! Cecilia was our waitress for that afternoon. Service was ok, no problem. One thing  to keep in mind, Uncle Bert ordered chicken parmesan but when it came out it was a sandwich parmesan which he didn't enjoy as much. I think would be best to inform the guest if there's 2 types of chicken parmesans, so that he knew which one to order. After our meals, we hit a jackpot with the plate of 3 desserts due to Uncle Bert's birthday. Cecilia did it good, she made Uncle Bert's happy. I tried it but didn't think I could handle more than my entree. It was the best experience plus great Harp musician. Definitely would come back. Five stars for my entree. The rest was OK but not bad. Make sure you put it on your next eating list! Btw, they open 24/7. You know where to go when you're hungry!"

It was my mother, her bf, my brother and I. They had ordered chicken dishes and my brother and I ordered a pizza to share. (They have amazing pizza) The entrees came out, 20 minutes later (after we are starving) our pizza comes out. I ordered the pizza that had pepperoni, cheese, and mushrooms because we are simple. It came out with all kinds of stuff on it. Peppers, onions, olives. I immediately told the server that we didn't order that, he looked absolutely offended and said yes you did. I said no we did not. He asked if we wanted that and I said no. He left. 10 min later he comes back with the pizza menu and begins to argue with me telling me I ordered the pizza Classico or something and I kept telling him I did not order that. I ordered the pizza with pepperoni and cheese. He continued to argue 5x with me back and forth in front of other guests that I'm wrong and he wrote down pizza Classico. He told me \"you may have thought you ordered that one but I wrote this one down\" I was absolutely shocked when he spoke to me that way. I'm completely offended at this point. I told him to go get a manager after 5 minutes of arguing basically screaming at me. The manager then came and comped our meal. Well my mothers meal because I didn't get to order the pizza. I am extremely upset because the food here is amazing and I waited 45 min for a pizza and did not even get it and had to leave. I'm appalled at the behavior this server had. I'm a server myself and the guests are always right. I have been in positions where the right dish did not come out and I simply apologize and get whatever they want because regardless if I am right they are enjoying dinner with me and I am not going to argue with a customer. Aside from this at the beginning I ordered a Mountain Dew. He said they don't carry that. I then looked in the menu where it specifically said under beverages Mountain Dew. I pointed he told me \"oh that's wrong, a lot of things are not right on the menu\"... what the hell am I suppose to think? 5 min later he brings me a Mountain Dew and apologizes and said \"I don't study the menu\"\n\nI have no words for the disrespect I received this evening. I don't recall his name and I wish I had gotten it. I did speak to the manager who apologized but regardless there is no reason someone should speak to a person that way let alone a guest. I am 23 years old and serve myself and would never disrespect anyone that way in or outside of work. Absolutely disgusting the way he speaks to people and ruined my mothers birthday dinner."

She said, \"[other restaurant] is shit, this is way better.\" Customer service tip - when someone mentions their favorite place, and you tell them it's shit, you A) had better be prepared to back that up with a quality sandwich, and B) know them pretty well, since a lot of people are unaccustomed to that type of treatment in restaurants. \n\nI had the Philly cheesesteak equivalent of the McRib, my co-worker had the most uninspiring spaghetti and some sort of sausage (but made fresh, onsite, daily!) that made him wonder if he had actually eaten anything.

First, the (very) good part. The history of the Bootlegger is alive and well on the walls and the decor. We sat in the old booths where apparently many of the early Las Vegas icons may have sat - fun to chat about. But better yet, one (or more) of the video monitors plays continuous clips of Las Vegas in the 60s and 70s - again, fun and entertaining.\n\n2. Now, unfortunately, the food was simply bland. No Italian bistro should have bland food at any point, it's a fundamental flaw or here, 'the kiss of death.' When an Italian place serves a generic tasting sauce, it's time for one of those TV shows to enter the picture and accomplish some major changes.\n\n3. We ordered Eggplant Parmigiana and a chicken dish, Pollo All Angelo. Each of ours dishes had no taste to it other than a series of generic ingredients, of the canned type, placed together and heated. The pasta was a bit undercooked but okay.\n\n4. At one point the two servers both disappeared for about 5 minutes after another group came in. The bartender was 'quietly' yelling, i.e. arms up in frustration, looking all about, making the gestures along with some additional bar guests seated nearby.\n\n5. Unexplainable part. I had ordered a Coke, it was normal. Then middle of the dinner, I ordered another one, refill, it was strangely different, much more syrup-like.\n\n6. In sum, the food was ~ I sincerely dislike saying this ~ bland at every point, the service was fast-food like, meaning adequate but intermittent definitely, but the atmosphere was pleasant. Unfortunately, that is not nearly enough to return. I would rather eat great food at a dive or 'hole in the wall.'\n\n7. As for some of the other reviews I see here - I highly suspect one or two as possibly being 'affiliated' with the place. The words just seem too simplistic in one case, too broad in another. Now, if I hear there was new management and an improved menu at some point, we may re-visit, but no time soon. \n\nStrange thought here - knowing that so many famous people had eaten at the Bootlegger in the prior locale, and hearing about this place for, well, decades, I was looking forward to a good dinner with my wife. It simply failed. The irony is that I had just shared with my wife that Olive Garden doesn't essentially cook anything, no grills, but uses microwaves to re-heat all the pre-packaged items sent to each store."

We arrived with a large group which had many from different walks of life to include at least 1 waiter from competition.  I was shocked to learn that their early dinner choices came with salad included but since we weren't there during that time,  salad was not included with the meal.  My date and I had chosen to order iced tea which cost $3 each,  we did not get a refill throughout dinner. I had the Pollo Angelo which was good but not great and at $24 I expected great.  My date ordered pizza which had a disclaimer of taking 30 minutes to cook abs which he tried to order early so we did not delay anybody else's meal.  We had to ask for a bread refill several times with only receiving the requested refill once, again a sign of an inattentive waiter like the iced tea.  We ordered the cannoli for dessert and for $7, I expected more wow with the taste (presentation was fabulous). And since we were part of a big group,  18% gratuity was automatically added to the check,  which I felt for service was closer to 15% with even that being generous for the service provided.  I understand we were a large group but I felt treated like a guaranteed gratuity. Dinner took 2 and a half hours from being seated to being finished which again felt a little excessive.  I understand that people have off days and perhaps that was the case for the waiter but I will have 2nd thoughts about giving this place a 2nd chance."

(and this place is open 24/seven, so you can get your Italian food fix anytime you want!)\n\nBrittany was awesome in assisting me with deciphering the menu. Determined that the chicken marsala was in order, so I ordered that up. Came with a side of fettuccine Alfredo (delicious). I know you can drink marsala wine but seriously, if they would bottle this chicken marsala sauce I would drink it out of a glass or a cup or a shoe or whatever!\n\nBut the real winner in this whole breakfast/lunch/dinner was the bread basket. Think of little pillows of dough that are brought out to the table with marinara sauce... they was fantastic! \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\nSatisfied? Yes\n\nReturn? Yes\n\nAdvocate? Yes"

After visiting this place I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.\n\nThe food is terrible. I'm not sure I ever had a worse Italian meal. Everything on the cold Antipasti plate must have been purchased at a supermarket. Nothing fresh! It came with pieces of Oscar Mayer style Salami and Bologna, canned artichoke and peppers. Sadly that was the best part of the dinner.\n\nOrdered the Chicken Marsala with Ziti and meat sauce. The Ziti with the meat sauce comes on the same plate as the Chicken Marsala which isn't the best way to do it because the two sauces run into each other. That was the least of the problems with the dish though as the Marsala sauce was a watered down mess. The meat sauce wasn't much better. The thick piece of chicken wasn't cooked in the correct way either.\n\nMy date ordered the Veal Osso Buco and when they brought that out I thought it must have been a joke. Four tiny medallions of veal that I'm not even sure was on the bone. It looked and smelled so terrible she didn't take a bite. I did however and regretted it as it tasted like a TV dinner Salisbury steak. \n\nTo be fair the place was packed, the service was good, they had a great lounge singer and people around us seemed to be enjoying their meals.  However there must be better Italian restaurants on the strip. A couple of locals recommended Battista's Hole in the Wall if your looking for old school Italian place that actually serves good food but unfortunately I didn't have the time to try it out so I can't confirm.\n\nI will sum up this review like this-If your looking for a great old school Italian meal similar to what you get on Arthur Ave in the Bronx NY then this in NOT your place. If your looking for a authentic looking Italian place with good music and Olive Garden style food then you found your place."

I've been to this restaurant a few times now, and try something different each time. The shrimp cocktail, baked penne, chicken francese and of course the papperdelle bolognese are all great choices. *They do charge extra if you decide to share a meal,  which I think they could do without. And my absolute favorite is the Panetti bread, reminds me of good garlic knots back in NY. The bartenders are really friendly and the servers are accommodating and nice too."

What does not mean? Well not some crappy amateur crap show that is for sure. Amazing entertainers throughout town come to bless us with their amazing talents along with the house band on Monday nights. We were lucky enough to hear professional singers belting out any and everything from Sinatra, Jackson 5 and... Yes... Even a little Pink Floyd action. You can sit in the bar and have an amazing and attentive service or if you prefer sit at a table for a full dinner experience.... Oh the food\n\nSo the food... Yum!!! First... I LOVE the garlic knots with sundries pesto they serve upon seating. Next, I am a ridiculous lasagna snob and this one sure fits the bill! However, I also highly recommend the stuffed mushroom appetizer. Takes a little longer but so worth it since they are made to order as opposed to sitting around all day. And believe it or not... The ribeye is amaze balls! I recently took my dad to a celebrity chef's steakhouse and practically needed a chainsaw to cut the meat. And two days later pops ordered a ribeye from Bootlegger that was amazingly tender and juicy... And for half the price even!!! Also good to note, they are open 24/7. Although I have never had breakfast there, I have heard it's pretty damn good!"

Interesting, but i'll stick with the pasta!\nOne advantage that Vegas definitely has over my years in California is the late-night tipsy food spots.

The best thing about the Bootlegger is that they serve 24 hours. With that said, it is not the full menu, but a pretty good menu.\nI do not like eating before a show, I get antsy. I want to enjoy my meal, with my friends and not worry about time constraints before getting to my seats. I rarely eat at casinos, because let's face it. I am a local. A born and bred local. I know what the the Strip was like in the good ol' days and this Vegas is not the good ol' days.\nIf I want to hear live music, I can at the Bootlegger. If I see a show on the Strip and want to eat afterwards. I can count on the Bootlegger. The only bad thing about the Bootlegger is so far away from The Smith Center, but I will still drive on the crowded I-15 to eat and have a wonderful relaxing time at the Bootlegger.\nI am so glad that there are still places that do Vegas the way Vegas used to be."

Needless to say, our waiter had to bring us another batch since we finished our bread so quickly. For the main dish, I ordered chicken marsala which was very flavorful with the sauce and mushrooms.

Olive Garden has better food at a much lower price. However, if you are looking for the live entertainment, perhaps this place is for you."

I've been here every time I visit Vegas and I've never been disappointed. My brother's wedding reception was also here and they still had stellar service. They are just south of the airport on Las Vegas Blvd, maybe 10 minutes from the strip if you hit traffic.\n\nYou sit down and before the second butt-cheek hits the chair, your bread is on the table. Very soon after that your water. I've had several different entrees there and every single one of them have been great! I love their breakfasts too.... especially at 2pm. LOL Their service is exceptional. Their food is always wonderful and I've managed to hook my family on this place too.\n\nI was particularly impressed when they hosted my brother's wedding reception. Even though there was a selection of pre-determined items to choose from, because I'm vegetarian and not a fan of alfredo (thanks to my meat eating brother, this was the only veggie meal in his selection), they had no problem offering me something else and offering it to other people as a selection as well. I loved this. The only complaint I had, as my brother's photographer, was that the lighting was so dim, the pictures were hard to take.\n\nThe only thing I haven't had here is dessert. I'm going to have to change that."

The old school style still exists but I'm afraid to say, it's lost its charm and quality in the kitchen.\n\nBeing raised in NY, we pride ourselves on quality pasta dishes. Unfortunately, the veal parm I ordered was dry, the sauce, marinara was just okay but seeing it served with angel hair pasta told me that the owners & management have taken their eye off the ball. At least you're not paying LV strip prices.\n\nThat said, if you don't mind loud drinks at the bar, average service and average food then why not give it a shot. My guess, you're at least 50% assured of getting a decent meal."

We have been coming here for 10 years and have never been so offended at their absolute indifference to any semblance of customer service.  Usually a nice family-operated restaurant with family friendly atmosphere.  Not even close today.  \n\nCalled ahead on a Sat night at 5:40pm to check the wait for 4 + baby.  Was told no wait and arrived within 10 minutes.  Was offered the \"lovely\" table right next to the kitchen...  Totally unsuitable for 3 adults and an active 4 year old, so asked for a different table.  Was told by the blonde hostess (who was the one who answered the phone when I called) that all the other empty tables were reserved for reservations, and we needed to wait 30 mins for a different table.  I guess when I called \"no wait\" was only for that 1 table and she failed to mention it...  Seriously?  She and the bearded host offered no alternatives and wanted to do nothing for us, and they seemed indifferent to losing our business when we walked out.  I guess they are doing so well that they can turn money away.  Lucky them.\n\nThey were so rude, I wanted to give them zero stars, but, alas, you can't do that on Yelp.  Such a shame that they don't think that customer article (or general good manners) are an important part of the restaurant dining experience because the food is better than your average American Italian fare, but, as everyone knows, American Italian places are a dime a dozen, so it shouldn't be too hard to find a new spot.  Open to any suggestions, since we are clearly looking for a new place..."

Tables aren't too close, it's not too loud.\n\nThe wine list isn't the most extensive or diverse, but it makes due. You'd just love to see some more international flavor, though.\n\nAlso, the bread was okay. Not great bread - it's kind of in little squares. I prefer a big fresh loaf coming out of the oven personally.\n\nFor the positive - my entree was fabulous. I had the pappardelle with bolognese.  Sauce was spot on, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The portion was really good size, especially for the price, so we definitely left full.\n\nWe ordered creme brulee for dessert, though in fairness, I was so full from everything before, that I couldn't give it an accurate assessment.

Food is good --traditional Italian restaurant like many you'd find in New York neighborhoods (that is meant as a compliment!)  Pasta, baked pasta (like eggplant parm), chicken and veal (sorrento, franchese etc. etc.)  In fact all the usual suspects at prices much lower than you'll find on the Strip.    Don't know why it is called \"bistro\" there is nothing bistro or French about it.  Bootlegger sticks with the \"Old style\" with pianist and general atmosphere reminiscent of the \"good\" old days.   Room is darkish, ornate in that Little Italy style and has a largish bar.  Walls adorned with pics. of honored grandparents who started a restaurant when Vegas was more than a little different than today's mega-hotels and Disney-land casinos.\n\nNot for hipsters or people who like \"adventurous\" food--but good if you want a meal that is familiar, good and inexpensive.  Service is prompt and professional and wait staff are experienced.\n\nIt is close by one of the outlet shopping centers and is open 24 hours a day--which seems odd--but there you are."

Ask the server who by the way is always kind of rude (ponytails and piercings) Anyway asked about the Scampi and was told that's the way it always is !! When I said that I order this every time and there is usually more. The bartender Who is a really nice guy came over said that the server is Right !!! Not wanting to argue I just said that you just lost me..paid my bill and left...Will never be back !!\nWife enjoyed her spinach ravioli.. But at this price and.all the other Italian food options time to move on.\nProblem is that there is no management at night."

Service was quick and very friendly and helpful. Bread was small cubes of fresh bread with light oil and herbs and tasted amazing. I ordered the pasta with meat sauce and Italian sausage. It was a huge portion, enough for two meals. It was hot and the taste was fantastic. All throughout the meal they had great service without being overbearing.

It's quite fascinating. \nAlthough the overall dining experience was exciting, the food didn't convince. Everything was soaked in oil and very heavy. The portion size could be called generous and the taste was OK, but nothing more than ordinary. \n\nThe major drawback, however, was the very limited assortment of vegetarian dishes - despite a very large menu. Even the Minestrone is cooked with a bacon broth and has sausage included. Amazingly, when I asked about the origin of the broth, the server claimed the Minestrone to be vegetarian because the bacon could be removed after the broth was cooked.\nTo add insult to injury, there is almost nothing a vegan could order. I totally argue that a restaurant in this day and age (in the western world) should be inclusive and also cater to vegetarians and vegans."

A co-worker mentioned this spot and the name made me think of some kind of sports bar or western barbecue joint.\n\nWhen we walked in, I thought I would be too underdressed, but the environment has a casual feel to it.  It's almost like one of those really nice restaurants with the really good food that you want to go to, but you really don't want to get dressed to the nines beforehand.  Well, then you have found your new Mecca.\n\nThe seated us and the nicest waiter that I have encountered in Las Vegas took our drink orders and brought us a plate of bread bites with a bowl of homemade marinara sauce to dip.  Oh my gosh...the marinara sauce is the best I have ever tasted.  The person I was with is more of an Alfredo sauce fan, but she loved it also.\n\nWe placed our orders and they brought out my Chicken Parmesan.  The chicken was lightly breaded enough so that it added to the flavor very well, but didn't detract from the fact that it was a moist piece of chicken.  They included a side of angel hair pasta with marinara that was delicious and the entree was so big that I had enough for the next day.  We also ordered tiramisu to go and it was the best I have ever eaten.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this place.

            "review": "I was invited here for dinner with the promise of being entertained by the most talented lounge singer in Las Vegas. Of course, how do you say no to that? The Bootlegger bistro is an old-school Vegas landmark whose owner was once a powerful lady in this town. The moment I walked in the door, I looked around and noticed that I was the youngest person in the dining room - everyone else had a good 20 years on me. No big deal. I've always been fond of the elderly - with their interesting stories and life experience. \n\nMy friend Doug pointed to the gentleman playing the piano and said, \"there's Jimmy Hopper, the man with an amazing voice!\" \n\nI nodded then proceeded to order a bellini-tini and the tomato-basil bruschetta. My friend ordered some old-person's drink involving cognac and the escargot appetizer. This is an Italian restaurant with the typical Italian faire on their menu. I eyed an item that sounded delicious, the spinach ravioli in marinara sauce; unfortunately it was under the gluten-free section. After a moment of hesitation as I don't have Celiac disease and ultimately have no reason to order a gluten-free item, I decided to get it anyway because spinach and cheese sounded just way too good. At this point, my friend asked for another cognac drink and the fish of the day (mahi mahi with risotto and asparagus).\n\nI thought the bellini-tini was great and that made up for the mediocre bruschetta appetizer. My friend, being a gentleman, offered me some of his escargot. They tasted pretty good! I don't know how much they cost but there were 4 or 5 of them on the plate so this is a fairly small item.\n\nWhen my ravioli arrived, it was pretty delicious; the filling was perfect although the pasta pockets were a bit chewy because of being gluten-free I guess. Over all though, this is a fairly healthy item while being a huge entree so you are definitely getting good value for the price paid. \n\nI also got to try my friend's dish. Oh man, this item was so freaking good! The mahi mahi was flaky, moist, perfectly seasoned and the sauce it was in didn't overpower the fish. But you know what the best part was? The risotto underneath the fish. I could eat a whole bowl of this risotto! Yummmmmmmm! \n\nMeanwhile, Jimmy Hopper was over there belting out scores after scores, both oldies and songs he had written himself. Indeed, this man has a great great voice. My friend encouraged me to request a song so I did! Guess what song I requested? Royal. Yes! You're probably thinking, \"whhhaaat?! She's crazy - requesting an old-school Vegas lounge singer to sing a pop song!!\" But oh no. I'm not crazy. Because moments earlier, my friend told me that he heard Jimmy sang Royal yesterday and he was blown away at his rendition of Royal. So of course, my expectation was very high.\n\nJimmy read my request note, chuckled to himself and said, \"Oh man. I'm still working on this song because there's a lot of backup singing and I'm a one-man show.\" So Jimmy then journeyed on to another oldie and finally, he turned on something from behind him and started the first notes of Royal. I was ecstatic!\n\nJimmy had modified this song to make it his own while still keeping true to the original melody.  This man is a genius. I LOVED this version of Royal! Where do I buy a CD of this particular song? \n\nLater that night, I was blown away again at Jimmy's musical ability when he started singing an opera song. Is there a musical genre that this man can't do? Hat's off to you sir! I'm so impressed!\n\nOkay, so if you are too cool for jazz and lounge music, there's a bar area that's on the other side of the wall where you can just sit and have drinks. \n\nCome here for the music, ambience and the laid-back atmosphere. The food, though good, is just a bonus."

Big overstuffed booths, professional servers all dressed alike with formal attire, classic dishes that are expertly crafted. \n\nThey start you with these addictive garlic bread bites that are covered in garlic and olive oil.  Be careful or you will fill up on them before your entree arrives!   \n\nWe had a starter of fried calamari and I have to say it was one of the top 5 best I have ever enjoyed.  The portions are generous and the quality of the food is top notch. After the garlic bites, starter and an entree we had no room for dessert.  \n\nIf you want a classic Italian dining experience, you should take a trip to south Las Vegas Blvd and give this joint a try.  I know we will be back again."

I am not a fan of mushrooms, but they had nothing but wonderful things to say.  They have a pretty great early bird special that the group took advantage of.  By the way, if you order soup, don't expect a little cup.  You get a large bowl of delicious minestrone.  After that and appetizers, it's almost impossible to complete your meal.  I had the capellini, which is great fresh and great microwaved.  The rest of the group had eggplant parmesan and spaghetti, meat lasagna and spaghetti, and this chicken and mushroom with fettucine plate.  Everyone was full and happy with their choices.\n\nI would love to return on my next trip to Vegas."

My family and I got here early and decided to go in to the bar located in the main restaurant area.  Drinks were pretty good along with our bartender Frank (sorry if I got the name wrong)   He was definitely an A+++ bartender .. very responsive and quick with service and a smile.  While we were sitting there I overheard the couple behind me send back an appetizer of calimari (unsure of the reason so I dont want to speculate) but also the steak was not cooked properly.  My brother had come in the previous night to try out the food and complained about the chicken being super dry.  I think the cook/cooks may have had an off day because the restaurant was packed when we left at 6 to go to our reception.  That many people filling the tables so it can't be all that bad.   The reception food was pretty good as I wasn't really expecting much after the complaints.  The steak however had good flavor but I had to chew and chew and chew..  WOW.. it was defintely fighting back.  The lasagna came in what I can only call a cheese form.  Small squares that held together tightly.  At first I was telling my family that this is kinda weird and spongy but after eating it I realized wow.. this is genius.. Everything in the lasagna stays together as you eat it so you aren't losing anything.   I guess I could compare it to Italian dim sum although it wasn't a dumpling . Great ITALIAN dishes however from what I was hearing a redo on steaks, chicken, and appetizers may be in order."

The outside of the restaurant/bar beckons at night with it's pretty lights and false promises. I was craving Italian and it was after 1am. Yelp was temporarily down or I wouldn't have even bothered with this place. The atmosphere was nice upon arrival. We seated ourselves at a booth. The server was pretty nice but his service was so slow. We both ordered the fettuccini alfredo. The bread with marinara sauce which was served right before the pasta was horrid and literally dripping grease. The food came quick but the service after that was really lousy. We waited almost 20 min. for the server/bartender to come back around to ask him for refills on ice tea. The fettuccini was so bland bland bland. I had to force myself to eat it. I left more than half the food on my plate as did my companion, who is not a picky eater. The guys in front of us, at the bar started smoking up a storm. Between that and food, which was not settling well, I wanted to just get the check but couldn't spot an employee which is strange for a bar. I could've up and left and noone would have noticed. Total bill for two fettuccini, two iced teas, (which were $4 a piece) was almost $40. subtotal. The price of the food was not even worth it. I wish I would have bought 2 frozen dinners, Marie Callender's fettuccini alfredo, on the way home and called it a night. It would've been cheaper, quicker, and tasted better, and that's sad. This was the worst Italian meal I've ever had in a restaurant. I've always wanted to try this place. I'm so disappointed. So, $48. later, I feel queasy and compelled to warn anyone with taste buds to stay away. If this was the last place on Earth that served food, I'd starve. No joke. If you really dislike someone recommend this place to them. No that's cruel. Try Carmine's Little Italy. The food is just as expensive, but at least worth it. Ugh! Even my burps are gross."

We flagged a waitress down and she did tell us that they were super busy and understaffed...so even if we chose to stay, which we did not, it would have been a long wait for food too. \n\nSo I have been looking forward to coming back here since I have heard good things,  and obviously we came on a bad night the first time.  Well, not sure this was much better. The staff was very friendly when we sat down. I ordered the eggplant appetizer, which was good.  Then I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo with no meat on top. \n\nThe Fettuccini was very thick and had formed a film on the top from obviously sitting too long. I tasted it, and it was luke warm. I immediately lost my appetite for it.  Another person at my table had the same problem with her Alfredo.  She mentioned it to the waiter, and he offered to give me a fresh plate of pasta.  Well, ok.  I'd love a hot fresh plate of pasta. While I'm waiting, the waiter made a point to come tell me that the cook stuck a thermometer in it and it was 140degrees. Ok?! And!?  I told him the bottom of the plate was warm, so maybe it touched the bottom. So a few minutes later, I get my same plate of pasta, boiling hot!  That would be great, except it was obvious he put it in the microwave, because now the fat had separated from the cream, and the plate of pasta was all oily. Wow. \n\nAnyway, the manager did come over and apologize and take it off my bill. The eggplant was decent, and the other waiter Alfredo was super friendly. So, I think this place has potential...so I will give it 3 stars for now."

I asked a guy who I believe may have been the manager on duty that night if they offered military discounts and a NO would have been better then what he gave me.\n\n\"We do things occasionally on certain holidays and we give out coupons at certain timeshares or on the streets with timeshares\".  REALLY????\n\nA place that offers a higher level of respect to Timeshares where you are picked up off the streets and offered a timeshare  presentation in exchange for a coupon to this place but Veterans who gave their lives for this country don't warrant anything other then on some special hilidays???\n\nIf the food would have been better maybe I would continue to support this place even without a coupon or discount, but after that answer and the quality of the food, I see no reason to return to this place like ever.  I guess they get enough business from tourists.  \n\nI would recommend stopping in for a drink and looking at all the old Vegas memorabilia, other then that there  are much better places to eat at that appreciate Veterans and locals."

Bread with marinara sauce is put out on the table when you are first seated and it is sooooo good!! The pasta dishes are all good. My fave is probably the meat ravioli. Caesar salads are cold, crisp, and have the right amount of dressing. I seriously can't think of anything negative about this place. I also love the old fashioned feel of this restaurant! Come during the evening and they have performers singing and playing piano in the main dining room; I can't recall if this is every night though.

When I asked about a certain wine, the waiter said he didn't care for that one and offered me what he thought was a better wine.

It was a large appetizer for just two people.  the Caesar salad were crisp and flavorful.  My husband had chicken masala with fettuccini Alfredo.  VERY tender and wonderful.  I had the pork chop which was on the bone and a huge meal.  The scalloped potatoes were wonderful.\n\nJust before 6:00 a pianist showed up and played some lovely music.

Almost as famous for it's major Vegas star clientele, circa 1950's, as it is for its quality true Southern Italian cooking, you'll get a whopping portion of each, the former on the walls, the latter on your plate.     I've always found it interesting that Big Stars rarely go to those overly decked-out eateries that the rest of us go to when we want to feel like glamorous stars.  I guess they get enough of all that fussing and fakery on stage.  When it's time to fuel up, they gravitate to these relaxed, homey, clean-but-not-dolled-up ma 'n pa joints and saloons, and for some reason, usually Italian. The one caveat is that it must have character that has organically evolved over years of many and diverse cheeks having lovingly brushed those well-worn leather seats.       Last night we lost our res. at Hugo's in the Four Queens, which I've also given a 5-star rating, because I couldn't pull myself, nor could my husband drag me, away from the damn Wheel of Fortune slot.  So we had no choice but to limp, financially beaten, and emotionally bruised, into the Bootlegger at 2 a.m.   It's times like that when only deep fried food will do, and lots of it.  Everything is \"flash\" fried so it's crisp and clean tasting.  What I especially like is that there are different coatings for the fried foods so they don't all taste the same, UGH.  The eggplant is flash-fried in a breadcrumb and parm coating, while the calamari is dipped in an egg batter.  Reasonably priced and a good go-to off-the-strip hideaway for those special times when the rest of your day at the gaming tables really sucked."

Nothing was done, nor was an apology given for improperly cooking my meal. The Piano player was good and played requests.

We ordered:\n\nEggplant Benny\nFrench toast\nHouse stack pancakes\nFried ravioli with marinara\nLasagna\nBasilico pizza with artichoke\nPanetti breads and marinara\nCannoli\n\nI used to go to the Bootlegger as a tourist when it was at its previous location of Trop and Eastern.  This was the second time I've been to this location.\n\nMeeting at 10:30 so we could try some breakfast items before breakfast service starts, the best of the three items we tried was the eggplant Benny.  This was a unique take on eggs Benedict with the base being eggplant.  I am not a big pancake person but I did try some of this and found it to be light and of good flavor especially with the imported (from the Northeast) pure maple syrup one of the group carries with them for breakfasts just in case a place serves syrup made by someone's aunt.\n\nOf the lunch dishes we ordered, the ravioli were very good.  The menu says it's a light breading and it was.  The pizza with artichoke was adequate.  The crust was not crisp but this is their style.\n\nFor dessert, the cannoli were standard except for the fact that they had and orange zest flavor to the filling which unusual to find at most Italian restaurants.  It gave a fresh taste to some rather standard, crispy shell cannoli.\n\nThe panetti breads with marinara was a bit of a disappointment for me.  They were too doughy for my taste.\n\nThis is a solid place for either breakfast or lunch although I'd go for lunch more than the breakfast selections.  It's a 24 hour place with video poker at the bar and it's a step up from the normal 24 hour places that dot the Las Vegas Valley."

I couldn't understand what happened to the big portion, enough for 2 days and 2 people size lasagna everyone is raving about. I guess Slater thought we wouldn't notice and didn't I tell him we were hungry? (See photo) the description was meat lasagna with meat sauce and there was noting of the sort. I think there was ground sausage and mostly bread crumbs the meat sauce was straight up marinara. As a matter of fact, I thought he brought as the veggie lasagna and verified with Slater that it was in fact their \"Meat\" lasagna. I think they also forgot the lasagna noodles and tried to cover it up with a huge slice of mozzarella that encased the entire 2 inch by 2 inch piece of Lasagna. The deficient piece of lasagna looked more like a large one side ravioli with a huge piece of government cheese on top. The sausage & peppers sandwich was an assemble of 2 pieces of crunchy peppers ( 1 piece red & 1 piece green at one end of the sandwich and caramelized cold onions at the other end. They didn't even bother to throw the 2 in a pan to hear and combine then with the marinara sauce before putting them in the roll. The marinara sauce on the side? Nothing on the bread roll and barely toasted. Did I say I was on a diet?  Atmosphere is clean and fresh smelling. I would expect some garlic wafting out of the kitchen especially since there are  many large family posters everywhere. Not my mommas house."

We should have guessed what was going to happen when the GF asked if one drink had Tequila or not. Another 15 minute wait for him to find out and bring my beverage and another 10 minutes for hers\n\nAfter drinks were ordered we ordered an appetizer and was told \"I'm not sure if we have any of that left, let me go check and I will be right back\" this time he was only gone 10 minutes and said \"we can make that for you, do you still want it\"? Well yes that's the whole reason we sat here and waited for you to come back! \n\nIf you are counting that's 40-50 minutes and we have only been given two glasses of water and a soda.\n\nWe had empty drinks on our table about 40% of the time we were there. Waiters, Busboys and others walked by our table and ignored our requests for assistance to get refills or our bill. (Actually a younger kid seeing our distress did get us refills and our to go boxes) I know the other waiters had their tables but a simple \"I'm sorry I will send Aaron over right away\" would have been nice\n\nWe had some good food but sadly not great. I had the Seafood Diavolo, the seafood was fresh but the sauce was a weak bland sauce when I had ordered it medium I was expecting it to have a little bite. If I can convince myself to patronize them again I will try it hot.\n\nThe Antipasta Classici, was what he was worried about not having any more and was quite exceptional. Best part of our meal was a plate of sliced meat and cheeses? \n\nOur server only came back once to our table and that was to give us our bill. There were empty tables everywhere and we should have been given more attention, just like the tables around us. \n\nThe best part of our meal was the guy playing the piano and his sexy singer belting out classic lounge act songs. The singer bantered with a few tables making them part of the show. The two of them were  a nod to classic Vegas and actually did elevate our experience from a horrible one to a mediocre one.\n\nWe may be back but it sadly won't be the first place I recommend to my friends or family."

I understand that we were seated outside, however, I have eaten at other restaurants before where their patio seating is CLEAN...I guess it doesn't happen at this place.\n\nOverlooking the dirtiness, I wanted to give Bootleggers an opportunity to prove my impression wrong through their food.  As the waitress came out, I saw that her uniform (which was black) was quite dirty also!  Her black apron and shirt was smeared with some red sauce (spaghetti maybe?) and white powder (cocaine maybe?)...Really not appetizing.  I did notice that the inside dining had very dim lighting, so maybe she didn't realize that her uniform was that dirty.  Nonetheless, it's not something I want to see.  \n\nShe took our drink orders and handed us the menus.  Even those were DIRTY!  A friend of mine had a coffee stain on his menu and we all had water/sauce stains throughout the pages....They should really clean those!  We should have left then and there, but NO!  I wanted to let Bootleggers redeem themselves through their food.\n\nThe waitress came back quickly with our drinks, complementary mini garlic rolls, and took our food order (she was quite friendly btw, which was a plus).  I had the mozzarella caprese and deep fried cheese ravioli.  \n\nThe garlic rolls were not really warm...well, let me take that back.  They were warm on the outside and cool on the inside.  Meh, let's say I wasn't a fan.  The mozzarella caprese and deep friend cheese ravioli were both were pretty good.  Nothing exciting or exceptional though.  The caprese needed more balsamic glaze.  They just squiggled three lines on the plate.  The cuts of mozzarella were nice and thick, so was the tomatoes.  The deep fried cheese raviolis came with marinara sauce.  There was a good crunch to them.  However, once again, these dished were forgettable...which is better than being bad dishes, I guess.\n\nOverall, I don't think I will be returning.

Unless you call ahead and make sure Ralph is not working. Then, there is actually a bartender who takes care of you and is a decent guy. The food is good if your at the point of the evening that you no longer taste. However, the seafood pizza is exceptional! Anything else I'd recommend you to stop by the freezer section of 7 eleven and microwave it."

It was a Table for four with a chair crowded onto the end in the walkway. Two of us ordered the same item and 20 minutes After ordering we were told there was only One Available. \n\nSo even though it was my wife's Birthday Dinner, she gave it up and ordered a Simple House Salad instead, while I just Ordered Soup out of frustration. The other three in the Party got the dishes they wanted and the food finally arrived at 9:30PM - two and a half Hours after we first entered the place.  Even their Garlic Rolls were not refilled after initially bringing a small bowl for five people - I guess they were hoping they could sell appetizers.\n\nI have many times taken out of town guest there, always Arrogance and Drama and some waiting, Yet Never again. Even my out of town guest stated after we left and all we had been through they would never recommend this Restaurant to anyone and tell them to be sure to avoid it. \n\nThey have enough business and they don't care - so why should We. \nIf you go for the Food, it's above average, however be prepared for Arrogance and Long waits with a (Owner) Host that always makes the place Frantic."

Bootlegger did an EXCELLENT job of accommodating our party. From the moment we walked in the service was excellent, professional, and friendly. From the charming hostess to our very friendly and efficient head waiter, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. The food was great - large portions and very good. If you're looking for a Michelin type food experience (we weren't) this is not the place for you. There's live entertainment (piano/singer) that could easily be cheesy but was anything but. The singer  had a great voice, was talented, and knew his craft - a true professional. The Bootlegger is like what Las Vegas used to be - the good parts. Overall, an amazing experience that we would be happy to repeat the next time we visit. \n\nIf you're looking for an authentic Vegas dining experience off the Strip you cannot go wrong with the Bootlegger Italian Bistro. Great job!"

My husband made reservations for us to eat here because he said they get busy around 7:30pm and when we got there, they were packed! The atmosphere was nice, dimly lit, some dressed up and others went in jeans. There's a pianist playing as well and he sounds dang close to frank Sinatra!\n\nThe service there was outstanding! They took our drink orders and orders quickly and the meals were prepared in a timely manner. The portions of the food were great too, I got a pasta dish with clams and it was enough to feed 2 people. Food was delicious!!! It was hot but not enough to burn you and the amount of clams they placed on my plate was plenty! They also start you off with garlic squares and a marinara dip as well. I didn't care too much for the dip because I couldn't get the tomatoes on there, it was more like you had to scoop out the pieces on your garlic square.\n\nThe reason why I'm giving this place a 5 star is because of the service. The waiter was great but I have to commend the runner that tended to our table. This gentleman was working his buns off from one table to another and was constantly helping others as well. He refilled our drinks quickly and was asking what else we needed. I didn't get a chance to catch his name but he was great and for that reason, the restaurant earned another star."

At first it was because a friend informed us that Ruth Brown performed there Thursday nights and we had to go before she died. So we did, and it was great, and then she died as predicted. (I assume they have other fine entertainment but I will let them live in peace. RIP, Ruth). \n\n Anyway, we went once when I was not in the mood for Italian, so I ordered the rib eye special and it was one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. I also agreed to go on one of the rare occasions when Babygirl and I were on a diet, so we ordered the light entrees: her fish, me chicken. They were both well cooked, moist and delicious, and served with on beds of spinach with sides of steamed broccoli and whole wheat pasta with marinara. We hardly missed the cheesy stuff.\n\nBut, mostly we keep coming back because they serve hands down my absolute favorite lasagna in town. (At least since the old Venetian on West Sahara closed down. Sob.)  Rather than a square like is usually served, their version is more like a slice of a tall layer cake, with one of the layers being a big, rich section of ricotta filling. YUM! It's served lying on its side with sauce and melted mozzarella bubbling on top.\n\n Unless, of course, you're my sister. In that case, everyone else's lasagna was as described. She inexplicably got a cold one. So, she sent it back and the waiter brought it out heated, but it had suffered from its sojourn in the microwave and was now \"too soggy\". So, she flagged the waiter down yet again and sent it on another trip to the kitchen. This time, the brought her out a new one, which was hot and fresh, but by then she had consumed enough of someone else's chicken that she was no longer hungry. It looked like a prime target for scavengers or tasty leftovers, but there was no competition for it. Guess we all put in enough time in the restaurant business to figure no way was that coming out on the third run unscathed.\n\nAnyway, it wasn't the lasagna incident that cost the fifth star (Bad experiences follow my sister around like a black cloud. I promise you it was her and not them).\n\nNo, the lower rating is due to my pet peeve: Lasanga is priced reasonably enough at 17 or 18 dollars, but it does not include a salad. Or even bread. You have to buy an order of garlic knots. Nothing I hate more. Jeez. Raise the price a couple of bucks and throw me some damned lettuce. We'll all be happy."

I mentioned to Joel I'd like to go there and on a Tuesday he surprised me with an early dinner. \n\nBootleggers Bistro is located on Las Vegas Blvd and it's been there forever! Since we were there at 3:30 pm on a Tuesday the place was empty. Which was fine with us. No waiting and they still had some excellent tunes from Sinatra to Louie Prima. It's a dimly lit place with a large bar. They also have a small stage with a piano. \n\nOur server was on point and quickly poured out water and handed us menus. Bootleggers has all the Italian classics. Since I can eat very little these days it's become a whole new way of ordering. Joel and I decided to split an appetizer and an entree. We picked the Antipasto plate and the Baked Penne. The food came out super fast. First, the Antipasto plate which was huge! It contained the best marinaded mushrooms, bell peppers, and chickpeas. Plus, it was filled with ham, salami, pepperoni, provolone, and fresh mozzarella. I was in heaven. Then it got better when they brought us out their epically awesome garlic knots and the marinara sauce was seriously life changing!! Our waitress brought out our piping hot Baked Penne. This is one of Joel's favorite Italian items. It's probably the best Baked Penne we've ever had. The ricotta cheese was so sweet and creamy and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  The sauce and meat the mealies in your mouth along with the bites of cheese and pasta. \n\nWhat an amazing meal! I can't stop thinking about every part of it. I seriously will be back ASAP!! The service rocks, the ambiance is romantic ( even at 3:30pm) and the food is mind blowing!!! For your next date night go here! You'll for sure impress. Bonus, Bootleggers Bistro is open 24 hours!!"

He was outstanding in his attentiveness and friendliness.  He gave us some great recommendations for our meals.  He was truly great.   Steve also mentioned it was their 65th anniversary in Las Vegas.  It is the oldest run restaurant here even though it's changed its location a few times.  \n\nI tried the Salmone which is pan seared salmon w/seafood ravioli in a lemon butter sauce.  Delicious and so tasty!  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  It was light, flaky with the sauce that complimented it perfectly.  Before the entree was brought out, tasty Panetti bread is brought to the table with the tomato basil dip.  Delightful!   Included with your entree is a soup or salad.  The caesar salad was great.  There wasn't too much dressing drenching the toppings.  It was nicely done.  \n\nWould I dine here again? Absolutely!"

Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the live singer perform, but we did get to hear his wonderful voice through the speaker system. \n\nFor food, I had their house salad (way overpriced for what it is). For the main course, I ordered their lasagna, and wow, it's delicious, cheesy, and plentiful! I could not finish it, even if I tried. No room for dessert, either, sadly.\n\nThe ambiance was quite nice, with the feeling of old Vegas during its mobster days. You almost get a feeling this was the place you'd find those guys hang out in. Our waiter was nice, but it did take a while for him to get us situated with drinks, writing down our orders, etc. Other than a slightly slower service, all was well, and I would love to come back the next time we're in Vegas."

As you walk in you feel like your back in the 60s with the big leather circle booths for 2 or 4 which gives it a nice romantic feel and periodically there will be a man playing the piano and singing it's really the perfect setting. There food is amazing it really doesn't matter what you get you'll be pleased. This time I got Alfredo and gnocchi's and it was amazing the sauce was thick and creamy and the gnocchi's cooked to perfection. The servers are great always around to get you what you need and the refills keep on coming without you even having to ask. The price is very reasonable especially being in Vegas on Las Vegas boulevard 3 miles from Mandalay Bay. If your a local check this place out! If your a tourist take uber or a taxi (which usually is only $5-$9)  and you won't be sorry. You will not find this kind of Italian food on the \"actual\" strip I can promise you this I've been looking! And this by far is the best!"

On a Sunday night, my friends and I attempted to find quality Italian food and found the Bootlegger Bistro sitting in a loud corner of not much else. The atmosphere was dark and the music all over the place. At one point they started to play 90's rock after getting tired of playing the same jazz hit 5 times in an hour. The service was lacking. The waitress seemed to have forgotten us much of the time and sitting there, we distinctly thought we could smell a waft of the good old ganja. She seemed really happy anyway...\n\nVic called for the Bootlegger Hot Mixed Antipasti. Bland. The Toasted Ravioli might as well have been slightly stale pasta flavored Playdough with very basic marinara used for everything that night. The House Specialty Shrimp wasn't exactly special. Though the calamari was not bad. Not over cooked and normal enough to be edible.\n\nI ordered Manicotti Infornati because I love ricotta wrapped in pasta and served with marinara, but I found that the ricotta was underwhelming and the marinara was lacking in herbs. My main course was overall a thorough disappointment considering that the plates were priced a little heavier than I like. (I like inexpensive. Inexpensive is the joy of students). \n\nWe waffled back and forth on dessert and in the end, we succumbed to our dark love of sweets. One was a Cannoli that had a strong taste of orange liqueur. Maybe Grand Marnier. The liqueur taste was strong, but for once, I was pleased and even infatuated with it. But that's if you're an orange flavor lover like me. The moment of sheer beauty and bliss however, was our Tiramisu. Absolutely fantastic and the reason why this restaurant has 3 stars. There was a distinct flavor of alcohol, but it was superbly balanced with the sweetness and that richness that is Tiramisu. It was in a word: transcendent. I have never found Tiramisu to be an appealing dessert till now, but every time I near Vegas, that will be one of the highlights of all my trips. The Tiramisu.\n\nIt's actually 2.5 for the price range.\n\nV reminded me: the either discriminated against us for either age or race (not sure which) because the hospitality was definitely lacking with only our table as the host floated from diner to diner except our group and shook hands with everyone as they left except for us."

However, after looking at the menu I decided to try the Italian Benny...normally I'm not a fan of eggs Benedict but the description was enticing....I really liked it! Not something I would want for breakfast everyday but it was a nice change. My hubby ended up ordering one of their regular breakfasts with a side of pancakes....The pancakes were awesome! He saved me a bite and we started joking we should order another side because they were so good!  Their italian bread served with breakfast is pretty delicious too!\nKind of a smokey, old Italian, bar feel....it wasn't very busy that morning so they just sat just right off the bar.

The food is also delicious (our last Italian place went downhill, and the one before that closed - so on the lookout for a new one - this is the place!).\n\nAs I stated, the d\u00e9cor is really great - old school Italian with reds and dark woods.  The service was also really good - my glass was never empty and they were very patient with my toddler and able were able to provide her with a cup of milk with lid and straw.  Some of the more expensive restaurants can't accommodate this, so I always bring a sippy cup just in case.  \n\nThe food was phenomenal.  If you're looking for classic, great tasting Italian food, look no further.  Everything was tasty.  We first got a couple of platters of the Hot Mixed Antipasti of which I was able to snag a shrimp and calamari - both were really good, and the accompanying marinara sauce also had really good flavor.  For my entr\u00e9e I got Baked Penne (easy to share with a toddler), and my husband got the Pork Chop Marsala - both dishes were really good.  My husband really would have preferred Chicken Marsala, but this was a good substitute.  The Baked Penne was also really good, and I had to stop myself from overeating!  \n\nThey also served bread with olive oil - my little girl gobbled that up!  As did everyone else at the table.\n\nOverall, a great experience - would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good Italian dinner.  Place was also great for a large party - they provided a table with plenty of room for everyone.  I've been here too with just a friend, and they have wonderfully private booths."

I recommended we go to Bootlegger since I hadn't been in so long!  She was hesitant since she has never been...I asked her to just trust me...\n\nWe were sat right away on a Saturday night!  Score!  The dining room was packed, we literally had the last available table.  \n\nAs we were just getting seated a man began singing and playing the keyboard on stage in the main dining room. My daughter was mesmerized by the atmosphere as an older couple stood up in the middle of their meal and began to slow dance. \"Mom, can people just stand up and dance in here?\" I giggled and said, \"yeah!  Isn't that cute?!\"  She threw me the thumbs up and clapped really excitedly for the couple when the song ended. Cute. \n\nI ordered the Salmone, a grilled salmon (explained to me by our server as \"flown in fresh daily\") w/seafood ravioli and my daughter ordered the cheese raviolis from the kids menu.  We also split the Caesar salad. \n\nHonestly I thought the Caesar had too much dressing. But my daughter ate it all up!  If my kid will eat a full size salad and ask for more, I'm thrilled! \n\nOur main course took a while to come out, but like I said it was busy. When the food finally arrived it was hot, beautifully plated and I was very impressed with my meal. As my daughter started working on hers, she said, \"mom, I know why the food took so long. It's because they were making sure it was JUST PERFECT!  It's sooooo good!\"  As she was finishing up her meal I asked, \"what's better, Bootlegger or Brio?\" she said \"Bootlegger!  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this place a 20 out of 10!  The kids ravioli was JUST enough for her. No leftovers and I wasn't begging her to finish another bite to earn dessert.  (Trust me, a real Mother's Day miracle!) \n\nBeing that it was the eve of Mother's Day, I allowed her to pick a dessert off of the menu for us to share. Despite the pressure from both myself and the waiter to select the Lava Cake, she went with the Cheesecake drizzled in raspberry sauce. It was very good.\n\nOur check was $66 including tip, not bad. Service was great despite the time it took for our main course to come out. The complimentary garlic bread they have come out is just as delicious as I remember, and their marinara is AMAZING. I'm not sure why I haven't ventured to this place for a meal during normal dinner hours, but with rave reviews from my little one and no complaints from me, we will definitely be back! \n\nP.s. The mannequin at the front used to freak me out!  Totally didn't even see it this time when I walked in but in the middle of dinner Chloe goes, \"mom, there was a really weird guy at the front when we walked in. He kept staring at me and I waved at him but he didn't wave back. Did you see him?\" I chuckled and said, \"that's just a mannequin, Chloe! Don't be scared. He's a statue and won't wave back to you.\" She laughed at herself and said \"oh. I was really scared of that guy.\" lol"

We ordered some bottled water (suggested in vegas), and started off with some bruschetta, which by the way was really good. It was toasty perfect starter. The BREAD that they serve here is so good! I think I ate most of it before my meal came out.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the perciatelli alla carbonara\nwhich is described as \"smokey bacon w/ fresh peas & cracked black pepper in cream sauce\" The pasta was pretty good but really heavy so I couldnt finish it. but my friends really enjoyed their meals. I had some food envy with the friends shrimp scampi. Almost wished I ordered that.

She seemed irritated if someone wasn't sure what they wanted immediately.\n\nThe food was the saving grace. My Seafood Diavolo was so divine. Packed with seafood and it came extra spicy- like I asked. My main gripe with Italian restaurants is that the rarely do spicy. Also the shrimp were huge and really tasty. Cooked perfectly. \n\nThe Sinatra-esque singer was delightful in the background. All in all a great place to dine if you stay away from the bar."

From the looks of this place, I expected something Olive Garden-ish (watered-down misinterpretation of Italian food). \n\nThe restaurant itself looked like something out of a movie -- an old school Italian-American restaurant set in New Orleans or Old Vegas on Halloween night. \n\nQuaint yet sizable with a cozy darkish ambiance, this would be a great restaurant to take a date! Or friends! Or family! Or anyone you want to have a good time with!\n\nThe little bread rolls they served were cute and delicious -- small curled up snail-like rolls drenched in olive oil and peppered with \"Italian seasoning\" (my palate isn't sensitive enough to distinguish the elements). I ordered spaghetti with the red meat sauce. My dining companion had fettucine alfredo with shrimp. The portions were generous and the food was FLAVORFUL + super satisfying in a home-cooked sorta way. I was in heaven! My fellow diner was enjoying his meal too. The fettucine alfredo was delicious! Tastebud nirvana!\n\nI will definitely return and order the same thing next time. The spaghetti with red meat sauce was too good!\n\nPs: The staff and service were impeccable! This place was a sweet find. :)"

            "review": "OMG! This place was suggested by a friend who lives in Vegas for my husband and I when I asked for a good restaurant not too expensive (around $50 per person). This place is wonderful! We opted for the fixed price dinner. It was $46 per person and included an appetizer, salad, entree and dessert...one for each person, so we got two different things and shared. We tried the calamari, fried meat ravioli, caesar salad, caprese salad, Chicken Saltimbocca, Veal Parm, cannoli and tiramisu. First of all, the wait staff is lovely and friendly. Glasses are filled promptly. The little garlic bread \"knots\" and marinara are to die for (and they'll bring more if you eat them all)! I've never really been that big a calamari fan. It's usually a little too greasy and rubbery. This was light, crispy and not rubbery at all. I could eat a plate of the fried meat ravioli. Salads were both fresh and delicious. Our entrees were amazing. The pasta on the side of each was obviously fresh made and cooked. Their sauces (especially marinara was about the best I've ever tasted). My husband loved his cannoli and I haven't eaten my tiramisu yet (too full, but I'm eating it tonight with leftover meal). The portion sizes are large. The atmosphere is great. Feels like an old Italian style restaurant, but it's in a new building and is kept up beautifully. The singer with piano accompaniment was so enjoyable. We absolutely loved our experience and would go back when in Vegas again. Highly recommended!"

I stopped in for lunch on Sunday and was greeted by this mannequin that holds a sign.  It said to seat myself. \n\nI sat myself.\n\nAfter a few minutes someone came with menus.  The menu is 8 pages long and has the old school feel to it.  I just watched Bourdain scour the Italian countryside eating pasta, so I ordered a vegetable plate and some fettuccine Alfredo.  I was really excited.  I was.\n\nThe appetizer arrived after about 12 minutes with fried ravioli and some grilled veggies.  They were soggy and the mushroom cap was leaving that grey water on the plate.  Not bad, but not good either.  The ravioli was okay, but not to die for.  We waited another 10 minutes for our pasta - vegetable lasagna with alfredo sauce and my fettuccine.  \n\nVegetable lasagna, dear readers, isn't just broccoli sandwiched between layers of pasta and swimming in sauce.  There are other vegetables out there, like eggplant, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions...I could go on and on.  The lasagna was sad.  I mean it literally looked like it was crying on the plate.  My alfredo was sandy, and when I say that I mean the sauce had grit in it that grinded like sand between my teeth.  I stopped halfway through in fear of digesting alien fragments.  \n\nWe did not get the bread that was supposed to come with our meal, either.\n\nI paid over $50 for lunch to eat crap.  I was very disappointed, felt like I was raped of my money, and honestly did not have the best time in the restroom that evening.  Needless to say I will never EVER returrn here again.  God willing."

They also have live music I believe around 9PM which adds to the ambiance. I'd say it has a very classic Italian feel with dim lighting, candlelight, & professional waiters. \nBut the important part is the food. I've been here I'd say 3-4 times now, and have ordered something different every time, and I have liked everything. the dinner salads are huge, the chicken piccata is delicious, spaghetti and meatballs a safe and yummy choice. My in-laws ordered the baked penne, and bolognese, both delish. The bread with marinera before your meal is great, warm and always tasty. The only gripe is the desserts we ordered were just ok. Good not great. The cannoli's had a citrusy flavor, and chocolate chips, which to us was just a tad odd tasting. FYI, the bar has video poker, if you like playing while you drink.\nAll in all, this is a great Italian restaurant, the staff is always attentive and the food delicious. We will be back for more!"

            "review": "Let's start with a little back ground information on myself and italian food. My Uncle's side of the family is full italian and can cook so I have had plenty of great authentic italian food over my lifetime. Bootleggers is the first italian restaurant, that I have been to, that produces great tasting, authentic, italian food. \n\nThis place really portrays old Vegas well. You feel like you just stepped back in time to when Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin ruled the Strip. This place is one of the coolest spots in Vegas. They even have a nice piano player and lounge singer on most nights and they are open 24/7.\n\nNow for the food. They start by giving you their garlic bread rolls...or thats what I call them. They are freshly baked garlic bread that is cut into squares before baking, so they resemble a roll. The rolls are served some classic marinara sauce that give them a great taste, but don't fill up on the rolls because the portion sizes here are pretty big. I ordered the spagettig and meatballs and my wife got the chicken Fettuccini alfredo. A true test to any italian restaurant is their meatballs. Every italian restaurant I have been to has meatballs that taste like dog food and yes this includes the regualrs like Olive Garden and Buca de Beppo. Bootlegger's meatballs are fantastic. They taste very similar to my family's recipe and therefore made me feel like I was at home. The spagetti was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of great tasting sauce. My wife's meal came out great too. \n\nThe price of the meal was very resonable, with most entrees costing between 13-18 dollars. The service was average but acceptable. This place is a must visit not only for the food but for the great ambiance."

The food is pretty good but it is on the more expensive side because you're paying for the experience versus than the actual food (which is why I'm giving them 2 stars vs. 1). However, my last trip to Bootleggers will be my last due to their terrible customer service.\n\nA co-worker stopped by after work on a Friday for dinner and drinks. Everything took way longer than it should, but it was pretty busy and there was a performer on stage so we didn't mind too much. The problem came after we left when I checked my credit card statement and realized they charged both tickets to my card. No big deal, I figured I would just call and Bootleggers would fix the problem since it was their error; boy was I wrong. After getting the run around from the manager for three weeks, I finally got the name of someone in accounting who finally looked into my concerns. After she researched it, the manager finally called me back and told me that they would only take the extra charge off my credit card if my co-worker called Bootleggers and gave them her credit card information because we were still liable for the charge. Then they told me I had to be the one to tell my co-worker about the screw up. They wouldn't even take responsibilty and call her themselves to resolve the issue.\n\nI work in customer service and under no circumstance would we ever ask the customer to fix something we screwed up."

Every time I called, the event manager was not in and I was told to call back later. After a month of trying to call, one of the managers gave me the email address to contact Denise the events manager. She was out of town, so I spoke with Ron. Ron said come in any time and someone will show me the room. My mother-in-law and I went there, FELL IN LOVE with the room, and spoke to 3 people who said it was a Wednesday and its slow and no reservations have been made for 12-12-12. I finally got an email back from Denise a week later, and she told me the date is open, people have inquired, but no one put down a deposit. She also sent me a contract which stated the prices on the web site. When I went to call her, she was at a wedding show, and would not be in until monday. So Danny showed me the room again, and took my $1,000 deposit. After a few more emails trying to contact her to set up a meeting so I could pay in full the rest of the package, she emailed me back saying she would only rent the room to me if I paid $150 a person which would come out to $15,000! (because of the 12-12-12 date). I called her and basically got the reason why : Another couple who inquired AFTER I put down the deposit was willing to spend $150 a person. So I was BACK BURNER because my package was just a basic package stated on the website and they could make more off of someone else. WOW.....they don't honor their deposits! And they don't care if you have family that got invitations flying in from all over the country..... or that you hired a celebrity entertainer that doesn't return deposits. \n\nDenise did say that she would return my deposit in check form, but I paid cash so I called Danny and he pressed to give me cash back.\n\nUnfortunately,  they lost more than my business over this. A lot of people who were coming most likely would have rented the venue for business on a monthly basis. Or that they could use my celebrity entertainer as a marketing tactic. I will warn them NEVER to book the copa room because of this terrible experience. And the grooms family who have been customers since the 80's will never eat there again."

My hubby and I came here and we seated in a cute little cozy half booth by the bar . Able to talk but still hear the singer in the other room. Prices are about $17-30 an entree . This place is open 24/7 which is awesome in Vegas !!"

Don't be bashful take your drink over and sit at it,, it's really cool.\n\nPrices are so reasonable and service is so good you can't get hurt giving them a try.\nThey can get slammed at times so take that into consideration if the service slows down a bit.\n\nExtremely tight video poker machines.

I think, this is the vibe the restaurant is going for - based on the decor and of course location - but I would not recommend for out-of-towners looking to catch up w/family or friends over dinner...at least on a weekend night, far too loud & far too obtrusive.  however, if you're looking for a vegas-y dinner not directly in the midst of the strip, and don't need to catch up w/anyone, this seems like a good place to go."

Our server was in training and being trained by someone who never provided her name, to keep it simple I'll call her \"The Trainer\". At the end of our meal we all asked for boxes. The Trainer brought three boxes, which was accurate, and it went downhill from there. The Trainer was standing right next to me holding the boxes, she began asking my friends about their meal, completely normal. My friends had the gnocchi and I had a Philly Cheesesteak. As the trainer was talking to my friends, she walked around the table in the opposite direction from me. She provided my friend to my right her box and proceeded to do the same for my other friend. As she stood at the opposite end of the table from me, I wondered if maybe she was just into the conversation and forgot to hand me my box. I soon found out. She sat the last box on the corner of the table, farther away from me than necessary. I waited a moment, thinking she would realize that she hadn't handed me the to go box. She never did. She watched me reached across the table, trying my best not to let my shirt fall into the food, to get the box. She never apologized and never acknowledged the fact that she didn't sit the box near me. Being black, I am aware that racism still exists. I was aware when I walked into the restaurant that I may have a negative experience. Despite my best efforts to remain positive, I was still proven wrong. I am not condemning the entire restaurant. This was one individual who unfortunately is representing this restaurant. This was my first experience at The Bootlegger and unfortunately it is my last."

Not in a bad way, but with wind blown hair, jeans and tops.  The front door person wanted to seat us in the bar and when we informed her that our friend was under 21 we needed to be seated in the dining room.  As she lead us to the dining room she was getting a \"look\" from who appeared to be a supervisor who said (quite loudly)  \"BAR SEATING\" and she let him know why we would not be sitting in the *i'm guessing* more casual area.  My friends and I are all also heavily tattooed females, and the look on the waiters face as he approached us was very disgruntled.  We ordered our food, kind of odd choices since we are vegetarians.  we ordered appetizers and salads, all to please come out at the same time.  The waiter never returned to our table, not one time.  The bus boy did his best to fix the errors in our order, half of which never arrived at all, he managed to make it turn out ok.  Being in a service (tipping) industry as well, all three of us each personally gave the busboy an over 20% tip for his friendly service.  I will most likely never go there again."

Stopped in for lunch and had a very pleasant server named Janie. No complaints on service with her at all! Food was ok in taste but nothing like I remember it! Caesar salad was really good but overpriced for lunch.  Next, came the issue. My daughter ordered cheese ravioli with their rose sauce rather than marinara. We didn't wait an unreasonable amount of time before our entrees were served, but my daughter's plate reached the table with marinara sauce rather than rose sauce! She told the server and Janie did recall the request.  The dish was remade with the correct sauce and of course we ate in shifts because I was finished with my lunch by then.  My daughter requested to speak with the manager regarding a discount on the meal for all the inconvenience.  The server said she would \"get the manager\" and she graciously apologized for the situation.  The so called manager NEVER came to the table and told the server he \"wouldn't discount or take off anything.\"  I've never seen such poor customer relations in ANY restaurant I've been to! What makes it worse is that he had no sack to do his own dirty work! He had the server come over and convey his answer! She was very nice and apologetic and I felt bad that he even put his employee in an awkward position. But we will not be going back to The Bootlegger nor will we recommend this place to visitors. This town is built on its reputation of CUSTOMER SERVICE and not just the product being sold!  Furthermore,  too many good Italian restaurants in town to frequent one where you're business isn't respected, appreciated OR wanted!"

The waiter became defensive when I commented it's proper to wait until the guest is done with the first course and I felt he was basically challenging my request.

The atmosphere is old-school, with read semi-circle banquettes lining the wall.  There was a pianist playing (who was later joined by a singer - they were great).  There is a large center bar in the dining room, with video poker if you're so inclined.  As a note, there is poker but no smoking - a literal and figurative breath of fresh air!\n\nOur beverage orders were taken quickly enough, and we had time to peruse the lengthy menu.  There are options for everyone, including healthy choices and gluten-free selections.  There's a prix fixe menu as well, just in case you brought your eating game.\n\nMost of our drinks came, but not all.  Our server was standing at the table when the drinks were brought over and he sort of scolded the busser for not having the full order.  As if that wasn't awkward enough, he then proceeded to tell us that the busser has been working at Bootlegger for 20 years and is still only so-so at his job.  It was a very awkward interaction to say the least.  But enough about that and on to the food.\n\nWe ordered the escargot appetizer - snails in a garlic butter sauce, stuffed into a white mushroom cap.  The mushroom and the sauce were delicious.  The snail was slightly chewy.  Overall it was better than average.\n\nI also ordered a caesar salad.  Not only was this not worth the $9 menu price, but it was definitely not good.  I believe it was made with a mix of iceberg and romaine, which is not only atypical, but also kind of crappy if the price is so high.  There was also something just off about the salad.  I wasn't able to put my finger on it (and neither was one of my dining companions who also had the salad).  It tasted like there was either oregano or dish soap in it.  Sadly, I'm not sure which.\n\nOur entrees were next.  I ordered the pappardelle bolognese.  It's a heaping mound of pasta - easily enough for two if you've had an appetizer and a salad.  The taste was declicious with a very rich flavor.  The pasta was great too.  My dining companions also had great tasting meals (the chicken parm and the chicken insalada).  All told, our entrees were extremely large and filling, reasonably priced, and great tasting.\n\nWe rounded out the mean with a coffee and an espresso.  Our server brought the espresso out and the coffee was missing.  When the server came by with the check he asked \"did the busser not bring the coffee?\"  I guess he had to round out the awkardness for the evening.\n\nI would defintiely go to Bootlegger for take-out again.  The food is great.  The entrees are large enough that you can probably have half for dinner and the leftovers for lunch the next day.  The value is exceptional (we had cocktails, the appetizers, entrees for three, and two coffees for under $150).  The service when you are dining-in is a little strange - or perhaps that was just our experience."

The building from outside looks new but when you get in, it looks like old Las Vegas. \n\nI ordered the very basic and ordinary Spaghetti Meatball (Note: it only came with one meatball). It wasn't bad. It didn't taste out of the can. The meatball was tasty. I wish they could've added a couple more since the meatball looked sad and alone on the plate. Their breadsticks were ordinary. Cannoli was surprisingly good. It had that orange flavoring in the cream. \n\nMay or may not be back."

I planned a Wednesday girl's night out (6 of us) for mani/pedis and drinks afterwards at Bootleggers because of it's proximity to Vanity Nails & Spa (which was wonderful and great prices). I called ahead on Tuesday to first verify that they had a separate lounge area from the dinning area so I would know if reservations would be necessary. When I spoke to the waitress on the phone she let me know that they were indeed separate spaces so I did not make reservations. \n\nOn Wednesday the Girl's night of mani/pedis went as planned, wonderfully, then off to Bootleggers around 6:30pm on a Wednesday. We had to stop and ask someone how to find the entrance first, they had outdoor seating but there were no doors open on the north side. We stopped what was apparently a phenomenal piano guy that provided us direction to the street facing entrance (mind you we hadn't even started drinking yet). \n\nWe walk into the entrance and saw a dinning sign that stated to wait to be seated so we moved past to the bar lounge area where a sign said seat yourself. The bar was full so we started looking for an open lounge table next to the bar. Many of the tables were reserved so we found the first one that wasn't and sat. \n\nWe sat there for less than 5 minutes and a waiter walk up to us and asked how many were in our party, we replied 6 total. He then followed up that the \"lounge\" table we were seated at was reserved and we would need to wait 40 minutes to be properly seated. Mind you there was no room at the bar so already Girl's night was coming to an awkward silence. What were we to do, awkwardly wait in the hallway for all the 50 something's to finish dinner so we could be \"properly\" seated or head out and find a new spot. Needless to say we left for Buffalo Wild Wings where there was plenty of bar seating and Girl's night could resume. \n\nI'm not writing to say that Bootlegger's isn't good, from all the recommendations on this site it would appear the garlic bread and marinara are fabulous but through some haphazard, awkward and confusing encounters or lack there of I won't be back and nor will the other 5 girls. I don't know if it's a \"woman\" thing or a \"personality\" thing but when go into a restaurant/bar lounge with no greeting or direction and I try to figure out what to do based on signs and logic and it doesn't work out in my favor I tend to not ever want to revisit that location."

I love the old Vegas feel and romantic ambiance, very cozy and intimate setting for date night; however, if you sit in the main dining room with the piano player (who's really entertaining, btw), it can get a bit loud. But at least you have your choice of sitting in the bar area (cozier) or the main dining room (more family oriented). The food is great - I usually order the meat ravioli with rose sauce (a must try) but I've had a couple other dishes as well that did not disappoint (spaghetti with meatballs and the fettucine). My wonderful significant other introduced me to this place and I'm hooked. Best part: they're open 24/7 :)"

I would love to give this place five stars but I believe that taste should play a big part in ratings. \n\nSo here goes, start with the positives. The location and ambiance are excellent. Parking is plentiful but scantly lit. Upon entering past 1am, as I do constantly, you have to ring a bell and be buzzed in (Something I really have grown to love, reminds me of old Vegas etiquette. If there were a password, I would have given this place an automatic 5 stars). Bootlegger's eating areas are dark, candle lit booths, very awesome. The service was definitely impeccable, each waiter introduces themselves with a business card, and pretty much never leaves you unattended.\n\nNow, the food. *sigh*\nI expected much better after all the reviews I've heard and read. We ordered the lasagna, a tomato/basil pizza, and pomodorro. The red sauce is old style, heavily spiced but still tastes like it's missing something. The pizza was decent, dough was soft yet crunchy with the same red sauce used on the lasagna. The pomodorro is what disturbed me, a simple recipe that's hard to ruin, the tomatoes were passed there ripening. I am willing to give it another try, it may have been that their tomatoes turned and got into all the sauces in my last visit, but we'll definitely have to see.\n\nGive it a try if you need a different spin on 24/7 dining which is seriously why I love Las Vegas so much."

A great starter.\n\nNext I had spinach fettuccine primavera which is broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, roasted garlic and zucchini with pine nuts in a light broth. There was a nice flavor of garlic through the dish complemented but the fresh taste of the beverages and the deep sweetness of the tomatoes. Served piping hot this dish exceeded all expectations and really reminded me why one can have a vegan dish and lose nothing over not having meat.\n\nHad no room to try the dessert which was disappointing.\n\nAdditionally service was prompt, quick and courteous.\n\nMy only criticism if I have any was the place was heated too high which made the atmosphere a bit uncomfortably warm.\n\nBut very highly recommend."

We ordered Martini's and a bottle of Pellegrino. The Garlic Rolls arrived before our drinks! Our server, Alfredo (yes that's his real name) was prompt and very helpful! We started with Bruschetta and a side of meatballs. The Bruschetta was fresh and delicious and the Meatballs were the best I've ever eaten!! They were moist and bursting with flavor!! We then ordered salads Caesar and Caprese. Fresh and delicious!! We also ordered a bottle of Bongiovanni Barolo, which Alfredo suggested decanting (Good Call because it had sediment). It was Amazing and paired nicely with our entrees - Lasagna and Seafood Pasta. The Lasagna was the best I've ever had and the Seafood Pasta was packed full of Calamari, Scallops, Shrimp and Crab. My only complaint is the shrimp was slightly over cooked. For dessert we ordered the Cannoli - to die for!! I also wanted to mention the piano player. I didn't get his name but he had a great voice and was a dead ringer for Sinatra! I requested Tom Jones but he didn't know any of his songs and he said he would learn for our next visit."

Our server was very friendly and a good kid, but just didn't quite perform to my expectations.\nWe walked in and were seated in the dining area by the bar, which is just fine, but he took a good 4-5 minutes before stopping by with waters and to take our drink/appetizer orders. He was very apologetic which is nice, but the place wasn't horribly busy and I needed me some aqua. The food runner brought us the amazing garlic knots and yummy marinara dipping sauce, and our server took our order and we enjoyed some nice conversation. It was a great ending to a good weekend. \n\nOur food arrived and I was salivating by this time, even after we destroyed two plates of the garlic knots. I ordered Chicken Piccata, which was pretty solid, but not the best I've had. My lady had the baked penne and she said it was very delicious as always, and her dad had the chicken Marsala. He's an excellent chef/caterer having owned AND cooked in at least 3 different restaurants in his day and he could not stop talking about how impressed he was with the \"high quality Marsala wine\" they used in the preparation of his meal. He said it's one of the best he's ever had, and that's saying something. Something that was a little annoying, is the water glasses are very small, and I drink lots of water with my meals. It ran empty for at least a couple minutes 3 times during the meal. It would be nice to get some bigger glasses, or maybe he could keep just a little better eye on his tables. Not a huge deal, but when you're eating steaming hot Italian food, sometimes you just need some damn water a little quicker.\n\nThe reason my review isn't 5 stars is the slight lack of service, and my piccata just being pretty good and not \"as good as it gets\" like 5 stars says. I'm a big fan, and will definitely come back as it's always a solid place for some great Italian food, and I love the atmosphere, and it's close to home.\n4 really solid stars, probably closer to 4.5.\nThanks bootlegger!"

In the meantime she was schmoozing the large table for obvious tip reasons.  There were only 3 of us since our daughter met us for dinner and the waitress had dollar signs in her eyes rather than service signs.  Both husband and I have waited tables before and are excellent tippers, but knew what was going on so she got a whopping 5 dollar tip from us.  An hour and 20 minutes later we were finally able to leave after getting the manager so we could get our bill and by now the restaurant was full and he had the audacity to say he was going to look to see when our ticket went up (like I was lying when I said we waited 45 minutes for our food and an hour for my salmon).  Anyway, my husband rates this place a 0, but knows I like it okay so took me there.. Now we're on the same page.  \n\nGlad I'm a local so I can spread the word.  Was fun sipping on one beer and ice cubes since filling up my water glass was too much for our waitress.. It's always more frustrating when you watch the other diners she's laughing with and running around for knowing they're having a good experience for the evening.  Bummer for the 20th.  No more going out on anniversaries..  With a smaller party you just get ignored when there's more money to be had elsewhere.  Shame on them."

They were pretty oily, but because I was hungry, I grabbed the smallest one on the plate.\n\nI chose the linguine with white clam sauce.  When it arrived, it looked like linguine with canned clams poured on top.  There were 4 fingernail sized clams in their shells, but that was it.  The rest of it looked like canned clams.  A big difference from the same dish I recently ordered in Seattle, where there were a ton 'o clams, all in their shell.  \n\nKudos to our server, who was very nice and polite.  But the food?  Just don't order what I had.\n\nShould'a gone to The Yardhouse...."

Jenny D. and I were on a double-date and didn't realize it was Monday night Cabaret open mic, which was a nice little treat.  \n\nThe last few times I've eaten at Bootlegger's, I was NOT impressed with the pastas.  The only thing I had ever liked there were the pizzas, but Jenny had gone in a week before and was ranting and raving about the Diavolo so I decided to give it another chance.  I ordered the Osso Bucco and my date ordered the Lasagna.  OMG my Osso Bucco was SO GOOD.  Instead of one giant shank, it was 5 small ones.  The meat was fall-off-the bone tender and so full of a robust flavor.  It came on top of risotto and asparagus.  I completely cleaned my plate.  Unfortunately I was too full to try my date's lasagna but he said it was the top 2 best lasagnas he has ever had.  \n\nIn addition, we ordered the Caprese salad, bruschetta, canoli, and tiramisu.   The only thing I wasn't very impressed with was the canoli.  It tasted a bit like artificial sweetener.  \n\nEverything from the food to the service was great.  We lucked out because a reservation for a booth got canceled and the hostess (ma\u00eetre d'?) sat us there.  It was a primo spot with a clear view of the cabaret.  We had an amazing time."

He directed us to our server who could answer all our questions. Our server was not familiar with the menu and informed us that he had \"only\" been working there a few months. I'm sorry, but in a few months, he can learn about the menu. He did not attempt once to find an answer to our questions and basically just said \"I don't know\" and left it at that. He wasn't too thrilled about serving us. I had the eggplant frit which had no flavor. The pancakes were far from fluffy soft and hot which I think pancakes are supposed to be. The mozzarella sticks were decent. The complimentary garlic knots had a good flavor but by the hard and chewy texture, I would guess they weren't fresh out of the oven. Won't be back and won't recommend it to anyone."

The food will not rock your world but it is pretty good for a restaurant that has been around for like 50 years and is open 24 hours.\n\nThe service is always good and they now take reservations which is also a plus. They just recently changed the menu and have added gluten free choices. I was pretty excited about this as I eat gluten free. I asked the waiter how they were and he said it tasted like crap and was mushy. okay- well thanks for being honest and I will order regular pasta. =)\n\nI always start with the Antipasti Classic. I will say that they used to have to different sizes ( small and large) and now they only have one. It is really small and if you are with a group, you will need to order 2. I wish they would have kept the different sizes. It is amazing no matter what size. I also order the Calamari Fritti which is pretty good, I can't complain at all.\n\nFor my meal, I always order the angel hair pasta with the rose sauce ( which is almost like a vodka sauce). Add a little hot pepper to this and OMG- pure goodness. The BF always gets the Papperdelle Bolognese and it is so good.. It can compete with some of the top restaurants I have been to.\n\nThe only thing I was disappointed with this time was the desserts. They changed the menu and the options are not very good. Hopefully they will be changing it to something better. Maybe add a mud pie or coffee ice cream cake."

Hubby had the lasagna, a big, giant portion. I had the Pomodoro Salad with grilled chicken, it was fresh and delicious, just oddly constructed as the \"pomodoro\" (tomatoes) were on the bottom of the salad, but it was tasty just the same.\n\nBootlegger is an exceptional value for the money, especially considering that it wasn't a $50 cab ride from the mid-strip (as is Capo's - which is just as authentic and excellent, but the value of the meal declines when you factor in a round-trip $50 cab ride) We are from the East Coast and the whole experience was authentic and enjoyable."

When I ordered linguine and clams, the server offered the following three sauces: \"red, creamy, or red.\" I assumed she substituted a \"red\" for \"white,\" and answered her with \"white.\" What she brought back was a CREAMY linguine. Absolutely saturated with cream, guaranteeing an upset stomach because I was unprepared. I was very saddened, but didn't feel like complaining because she was otherwise nice and attentive.\n\nBut cream? I have never seen an offering of linguine and clams with cream. Usually it's a white wine/olive oil sort of sauce. Maybe that's somebody's boat, but it's not mine."

We were seated in the bar area as they had closed the dining room, and as soon as our food arrived, one of the employees sat at the bar, not 10 feet from us, and lit up a cig (this employee appeared to be management, the way he was dressed). Next thing ya know, two other employees did the same, so we were sitting there engulfed with smoke while trying to enjoy our dinners. I asked our waitperson if it was legal and I was met with \"ummmmm, it's just what they do when it's after hours.\" Keep in mind this establishment is open 24/7, when is after hours? I did not want to make a stink (all pun intended) and asked to be moved, and we were seated outside. By the way, this is not a bar that you would consider you could smoke at in Vegas, this really is a part of the restaurant.\n\nIMHO this was just lame. We were not the only people dining there, and there was no consideration for the patrons. These employees (two waitpersons and the gentleman that appeared to be management) never asked the diners if it would bother them, they just sat down and had at it.\n\nWhen we walked in there was some great music and again the food was very good, however I do not think I would return.

There was such a variance in reviews that I was skeptical because in that scenario I usually side with the one starers. \nMy experience....\nBootlegger bistro def has a vintage feel, not sure if it's that \"old Vegas \" feel people talk about constantly or the decor or the older clientele and piano playing guy singing our favorite Sinatra tunes and hits of the 80s. Anyway, calamari was delish ( not too fishy and gross like Kona grill)- I just wished they had an aioli dip because I'm not that into marinara. My linguine and clams with white wine sauce was really delicious in every way. It was made perfectly. This is a dish that is either terribly gross or absolutely superb. They definitely have a superb linguine with clams! So good in fact the members of my party were all eating of my plate to sample and get seconds of delicious pasta. They aren't even seafood people so that says something. My friend had lobster mashed potatoes which may have been a limited special but were equally as amazing. The tiramisu was good but definitely not the best I've ever had and the cappuccino was a must have. I didn't try the NY steak because I don't like meat but everyone at my table said it was really tasty. Only minus- the food took somewhat long to get to us which was ok because we were watching the entertainer sing, eating bread nuggets and debating over which song we should request. I'm a creature of the night and love the dim lighting. I wonder if its this way during the day? That would be awesome. Overall, great place to take a date or anyone you want to eat with in a dim lit intimate atmosphere that's not awkwardly quiet."

So my husband's mom came here for the holiday from Florida and I wanted to take her there Saturday night.  Unfortunately, this time was NOT a good experience whatsoever.  My pasta which should have been baked and come out piping hot and was barely warm.  Had to take almost the whole thing to go so I could properly heat it myself.  My mother in law ordered the cod and you could smell it the minute the waiter brought it to the table...extremely fishy and it cost $22 so needless to say she was very disappointed.  On top of all this, my water glass sat bone dry until I was finally able to ask my waiter for water.  When we told him the fish tasted fishy he acted surprised???  Really, I could smell it arriving and he delivered it.\n\nWe will try going to this restaurant again but it will be awhile."

Minestrone wasn't on the menu but after asking the server he came back with the best minestrone I've ever had.  Fast forward to regular dining hours, the minestrone tasted different but it was still very good, not sure if the first time was because I was so drunk and soup just hit the spot.  Nonetheless, the pasta carbonara was cooked perfectly, the calamari was cooked perfectly and the rest of my dining crew enjoyed the pizza like they always do.

The ambiance was perfect.  \nMy pre-dinner extra dry vodka martini was perfectly prepared and my fiance's \"Italian\" margarita (a house specialty) was delicious.  The bread bites with marinara sauce were a great into to our meal.  \nMy veal Parmesan was exceptional and the lasagna my fiance had was probably some of the best I have tasted.  We had the Creme Brulee for dessert even though it's not really a Italian dish but it is my favorite and it was fantastic.

Ultimately, I went with a delicious Bootlegger sub with meats, cheese, tomato and olive oil. The guy at the counter suggested that I order it hot which I did and I was happy he suggested it!

As always service was top notch, and our group devoured the hot garlic bread knots with marinara served on the house. Each of us tried a house salad (yummy) and something different like lasagna with meat sauce, steak, pork chop, fish & Alfredo, all meals were great, no complaints. I always get the lasagna, it's so creamy, meaty, and cheesy I can't bear to not order it! We ordered up 2 bottles of good red & had to pass on desert. Our waiter took care of us perfectly throughout the meal. Great place never disappointed. Food quality high."

Hung out in the bar while we waited and had a couple of glasses of red wine. The house red was very good. We got seated right near the piano, where a guy played classic Vegas music. My husband ordered the Veggie Lasagna, and he said it was the best he had ever had - even better than mine! What?!?! LOL! I had the Pollo Angelo, which was awesome. I told the waiter it was my husband's birthday, and for dessert he brought him the Chocolate Lava on the house, which tasted amazing, especially with our 4th glass of red wine :-) I would recommend this place if you like a darker, very romantic ambience for dinner. Food service, food, ambience all excellent!\n\nSo why only 4 stars instead of 5? Well, like I mentioned we got there at 7:00. I checked us in at the hostess desk, and she rolled her eyes and said: \"Your reservation is for 7:30, your early and I can't seat you until 7:30\". I said, yes, I know we're early, I just wanted to let you know that we are here. We will wait in the bar until you'e ready. She doesn't say anything, just points to the bar and looks back down to her reservation book. I started giggling, and thought, oh crap, I hope this isn't a prelude for the evening. Well, thankfully it wasn't. From the minute we headed to the bar until we walked out was fantastic! Please don't let the not-so-friendly hostess fool you, we will definitely visit this place again."

She sounded very good!\n\nI was in the mood for a baked dish and couldn't decide between lasagna and baked penne.\n\nI decided on the house blue cheese salad and their recommendation, the lasagna.  I also had an Italian Mule which was a great start.\n\nThe salad was very good, plenty of blue cheese dressing with mixed red and green lettuce.  They brought some bread bites as well.  The bread bites were good, but I added some salt to give them a little flavor.  The marinara dipping sauce wasn't bad but I like tangy or sweet and it was a little bland.\n\nWhen the lasagna came, it was a generous portion, however it was different than any lasagna I've had before.  Most lasagnas are layered with pasta, cheese, beef or sausage, sauce, then another layer, etc.  This was a large, concentrated mound of meat on the right (probably sausage and beef combined), a lot of cheese on the left (I'm sure ricotta and ?), and one piece of pasta covering the top.  I'm not certain this was the way it was supposed to be or if this piece somehow got cut incorrectly but the flavors were completely separate from one another and didn't have that good lasagna combination of flavors.  It was also too little pasta for a lasagna dish. I ate some but since it wasn't what I expected, I wrapped up the leftovers.\n\nI considered dessert but decided to forego it for another time.  I will try the baked Penne next time and see how that is.  Overall it was 3 stars."

It's not unusual for major show headliners to come here and participate in the entertainment experience. The musical entertainment here is really enjoyable and when you combine that with great food, well you have a place that you'll want to come to over and over again. For the visitors to Vegas who might just be shopping a block away at the Outlet Mall, don't miss the Bootllegger Bistro. What's cool about this restaurant is that you really can pick to dine at whatever price point you would like- You can spend a little or a lot, that's up to you. We've had great times inviting special friends to join us for dinner to celebrate many good things that have happened and we've been here in the middle of the night when we had to wait around before going to the airport. I remember reading the menu in the early hours by flashlight and having a fun breakfast while playing some video poker.

I've been in during all 3 shifts many times and I would have to say that graveyard is probably your best bet or atleast it used to be (haven't been in that late in awhile).The morning/lunch shift is pretty god awful when it comes to service.. The bartender who's name is Diane ( which I had to call and find out since she never even introduced herself) is easily one of the most neglectful and unprofessional bartenders I've ever come across in a town filled with plenty of terrible bartenders..she spends most of her time in the back corner of the bar playing on her iPad or laptop and if shes not checking her facebook shes busy bullshitting and complaining with the blonde waitress about work or her personal life.. God forbid she checks on the 2 customers she has at the bar who may need something..\nSwing shift is pretty terrible too. The two blondes behind the bar need to be replaced as soon as possible.. Everytime I've ever been there (usually on a Friday or Saturday) whether its busy or not its always a nightmare. They have no idea what they're doing not to mention they are both extremely rude. It's too bad that this place has become this bad. My advice get some fresh faced staff to replace the miserable cancerous ones that are slowly killing your business one dissatisfied customer at a time.."

For desert I got the canoli. With a hint or orange and not too sweet chocolate it was awesome! All in all I will be back at least 2 times a month. Oh don't forget to try their bread. It's a party in every bite. Just remember to add 5-15 minutes of cardio to your workouts after. This not for calorie watchers. Go see Fred and have him guide you through Italy in LV!"

The entertainment was outstanding, the food was good (for the most part) but the service was so disappointing, it overshadowed the entire evening. I can understand a few items getting overlooked during a dinner, but it almost felt like a practical joke how many mistakes were made. Reversing drinks, not offering refills, leaving dirty dishes and glasses when refills did finally arrive...not checking back to see if the entrees are satisfactory.. I could go on (and there was more) but my point is made. You can go to Denny's and keep your drinks filled and your table bussed. I would hope for that much at a restaurant of this level. I did relay our experience to the assistant manager and she took my phone number to pass along to the general manager. In keeping with the theme of the night, I never heard back. Even with great musical acts performing, I don't think that would be enough to draw me back."

Our server was not very attentive and very curt. He came by to take our order and again to leave the bill. The bus boys were amazing though, they kept filling our drinks, brought our food and bread. If I could have given the tip to the bus boy instead I would. The kitchen moves pretty fast, food was ready fairly quickly. The live entertainment was great for the short time they actually played. I may never come back, I'm still unsure if I'll give them another shot at my money."

            "review": "After reading the reviews, I decided to have dinner at the infamous \"Bootlegger Bistro\". This place let me down. I was completely disappointed. \nNEVER AGAIN!!! Trust this review. \n\nFor starters, the bread was good, but the marinara was terribly oily. I couldn't even dip the bread in the marinara, without my bread being drenched in oil. \n\nI ordered salmon Alfredo, with a side Caesar salad. The ceasar salad was good and fresh. Upon receiving my main food, I noticed it was a shrimp dish with pasta, which was COMPLETELY different from what I ordered. \n\nThe server Stephen (who was really nice) advised me to keep my order, as the chef was preparing a fresh piece of salmon for me. Although I was upset about getting a completely different order, I had faith that Stephen would deliver.  As I ate the shrimp dish, I discovered that it was actually shrimp scampi (shrimp saut\u00e9ed with garlic in butter, olive oil, and white wine and parsley over pasta) and not a creamy sauce like Alfredo is. So, for my server to replace the shrimp with salmon and leave the pasta, would have been pointless. I advised Stephen and he advised he would bring me salmon Alfredo. \n\nAfter receiving the dish, let me tell you....the salmon was seasoned and cooked to perfection and was pure deliciousness!!! . The alfredo on the other hand was NASTY!!!! It lacked flavor, was gluey, watery and tasted like it was out of a can. Uggghhhhh!!! Worst I ever had. \n\nI advised Stephen. Stephen apologized, bought the bill and advised he couldn't do anything about the dish, but took off my Caesar salad. At this time, I noticed the price of the shrimp dish was more than the salmon Alfredo, which is what he charged me for. I informed Stephen that I was charged more than what the I initially ordered. Stephen said, \"The shrimp dish and salmon is the same price. The bill is still correct.\" I paid the bill and left the resturant. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I felt conflicted about what Stephen told me. I parked and walked back into the resturant and checked the price. I noticed I was charged more than what I had originally ordered. REALLY????? Stephen over charged me for my meal....and was too lazy and incompetent to charge me for the actual meal they F'd up!!!!! \n\nI advised the manager on duty, Roman who was completely unprofessional. I WILL NEVER eat here again. What a waste of money. If you want good Italian food, go to maggiano's or Giada's at the Cromwell."

No big deal, easy fix, cashier was very nice about it. \n\nWhat kind of rubbed me the wrong way was the manager rushed in, started correcting my order on their point of sale terminal, slammed her keys down, and sped past me, through the dining room leading to the hallway, and never even once smiled or acknowledged the mistake. While I understand the floor was a little busy at the time, I would have appreciated somewhat of a acknowledgment. \n\nStill waiting on the food, and the manager just ran out the takeout doors, cigarettes in hand and lighting up as I type, right outside the door. Still no food yet. I can't make this up. This is incredible.\n\nBased on reviews here, it seems like a nice place that truly wants to give that vintage experience, however I feel that my experience missed the mark.\n\nEdit: So disappointed. Menu advertises the chicken pesto panini as coming with lettuce and tomato. Check the picture I uploaded. No lettuce, no tomato, a smudge of sauce, and barely any fries. All this for 11 dollars is seriously upsetting."

The service is so beyond excellent!!\n\nWe started out with the house side salad and it was absolutely delicious. I tried the house Italian and the blue cheese and oh my! Both were absolutely delicious. Especially with the small garlic knots ;-)\n\nI ordered the chicken scalopini piccata and asked for linguini with extra sauce instead of the fettuccini Alfredo. My husband ordered the osso buco and our friends had the eggplant Parmesan.\n\nThe piccata was very tasty and the portion was very large.  I tend to prefer my piccata a bit more lemony, but the sauce was layered while subtle.  The linguini was sadly not al dente; while I did not ask for it to be, I expect good Italian restaurants to automatically serve pasta al dente. That's the only reason I gave this restaurant four stars instead of five.\n\nThe osso buco was absolutely outstanding!  The risotto was slightly crispy and the intricate flavour very nicely accompanied the robustness of the meat.  The heavy dark sauce exploded with flavour.\n\nThe eggplant Parmesan was traditional prepared and served with one of the best marinara I have ever tasted. Absolutely outstanding!\n\nWe ended the meal with tiramisu and hot molten chocolate cake. The tiramisu was light and delicious, but the lava cake was the clear winner - wow!!!!!!  Foodgasmic!!\n\nSo if you want a delicious dinner in a great setting with fantastic service, come here!"

I was lucky enough to be with a party that reserved the large private building in the back. The decor was elegant, complete with chandeliers and historic pictures. \n\nFor dinner, I tried the \"Salmone,\" which was pan seared salmon served with salmon stuffed ravioli. What interested me most about this dish was the squid ink black ravioli shells, which were light but slightly chewy. The salmon itself was slightly sub par, being dry and lacking in the typical juicy flavor of the fish. \n\nOverall, the environment was nicely decorated, and the food was interesting enough. If you have a car, it's worth the trip off the strip. If not, I'd hunker down at an establishment with better flavor."

The CHICKEN they used on it was absolutely great at Bootlegger, however. Very juicy and flavorful. \n\nService was good or great in all three instances. Even on a busy Saturday night when the prom kids were out with their dates. And as a bonus I could actually taste the gin in my cocktails. Worth going and not a bad choice lunch or dinner."

It took 5 minutes to receive menus, finally also greeted by the bartender, Fred. The two of us ordered drinks. Then the calamari and smaller portioned bar \nlasagna. 15 minutes go by and we get our calamari.. Not bad, not amazing. Garlic knots were dry. We then see a large lasagna come out, but the bartender immediately told the runner it was the wrong size. (And we heard it) He takes it back.. 30 minutes go by.. I ask if our food will be ready soon and the bartender quickly says, \"Yes, soon.\" A smaller version comes out but it's quickly whisked away by Fred as he mumbles frustration under his breath and goes to the kitchen. We see a small female manager and ask her for the check, she says yes but that we need to wait for the bartender to come back. He comes back, says not ONE WORD to us and drops the check. The lasagna was taken off. Okay, fine, but as two people that work in the industry, you keep your customers in the loop. He said nothing, no apology, no acknowledgment whatsoever. And it would maybe be understood if we were rude, but in fact we were too easy and he assumed they'll leave if I don't say anything to them. Ruined our night, spent 1hr 40minutes for nothing. What a coward and so unprofessional."

            "review": "In the two years that I've lived in the Vegas area, I've frequently heard good things about this place -- mostly along the lines of it being a very good, old-school Italian restaurant & having live music most (if not all) evenings.\n\nI FINALLY got there last night, for dinner with a friend.   \n\nWhile the owners & I guess the recipes go back 60+ years, their current location is basically in a modern strip-mall complex along Las Vegas Blvd.\n\nThey have a small outdoor seating section, which actually would be a lot of fun on a nice day or night, but we opted to sit inside on our first visit, to get a better few for everything.\n\nWe arrived at about 6:30PM on a Thursday, easily found parking by the front door, and were promptly seated (no reservation).\n\nThe interior is pretty nice -- lots of old photos of the family on the wall, a nice looking bar section, and then a couple dining sections.  We were seated in what was probably the main seating area, since it was where the small stage with a Baby Grand piano was.  Ambience was pretty classic -- dark red tablecloths, red walls, etc. while customer attire ran the gamut.  I was there in jeans & a t-shirt, some groups were semi-formally dressed, and one table had people in shorts & a t-shirt.  \nI don't think the management really minds much, however now that I know what the place is like, I would not personally feel comfortable just wearing shorts, a t-shirt & sandals.   This was a spur of the moment dining location for me, & while I wouldn't feel uncomfortable going back in casual attire, if I know I'm headed there, I'll at least wear a nice shirt, but even with that, the staff is still dressed nicer than at least 50% of the clientele.\n\nAll the staff was very friendly & professional -- shortly after we were seated, we were offered ice water.  Our drink order was taken when the menus were delivered, and pretty much as soon as we were ready to order, the waiter was there to take it.   Right after our order was placed, we received a gratis appetizer of 'garlic bread balls' & marinara dipping sauce -- good stuff!\n\nMy friend ordered meat lasagna, and I (a vegetarian) ordered a side salad, and spaghetti marinara.\n\nMy salad arrived within about 5 minutes, and was very good, albeit nothing too special or elaborate.   About this time, a young woman, accompanied by a pianist, started signing.  It was a nice touch, but not too loud to prevent a conversation at our table.\n\nAbout 15- 20 minutes after we placed our order, or entrees arrived, and we were both offered Parmesan cheese added to the top.\n\n  My friend said his lasagna was very good, and I know my spaghetti was too.   Spaghetti with marinara sauce & Parmesan cheese sprinkles is pretty basic of course -- as a hapless bachelor type, spaghetti with marinara sauce is one of the few meals I can actually make at home  -- but their marinara sauce is clearly something freshly made & the result of true, old-school Italian family tradition -- you won't find that sort of flavor in a can or jar at the grocery store...\n\nQuantity of both my pasta & my friend's lasagna was good.  By no means was it 'family-style,' nor did we have any leftovers, but the portions were enough for two good-sized adult males to fill their bellies.\n\nIt AMAZES me to think that this place is open 24/7!   I'd live to get there at 2 or 4AM sometime, just to see how if it's still a classy-casual kind of place.    I expect the late night/early morning operation is subsidized by video poker machines (& players) at the bar.\n\nMy one & only complaint?   The prices.   Call me a cheapskate -- it's very true that as someone who lives in the LV area who likes dining-out, I need to be careful with my meal budget.  But I also know that for $15 or less at some casino buffets, I can get my fill of a large variety of decent food plus a drink.  That fact is always in the back of my mind, though I am not trying to compare a relatively cheap casino buffet to a meal experience at a very nice, old-school Italian place with linen napkins & waiters wearing suits & ties.\n\n$16 for a plate of spaghetti marinara?  Well, I'll reluctantly say OK to that, but only because of the overall ambience plus live music.  $3 for my iced tea (free refills)? I can live with that.   But I was surprised to see that my tasty but nothing-extraordinary side salad was $8.   In my experience, at many comparable places, that salad would have been included in the price of the entree.  This place is not some touristy place on The Strip that can get away with charging a lot simply because tourists have been programmed to expect to pay a lot while in the LV area for vacation.  It's almost like there's a surcharge for wanting to eat healthy...\n\n Our stomaches were pleasantly full so we passed on desert this time.\n\nI absolutely do expect to be back -- curiosity may have me stop by if I'm hungry & in the area at 3AM one of these days, or if I'm on a somewhat casual date, it's a nice lunch or dinner option."

We arrived early for our reservation, and the host and bar waiter were somewhat discourteous, which made us feel not necessarily welcomed.  The host partially made up for his dicourteousness by seating us in a booth near the live entertainment.  \n\nOnce seated, our waiter, who was a sommelier, was five star! He made great food recommendations and paired a perfect wine for us. The live entertainment, Frank Bugati, was a Sinatra style vocalist/keyboardist who was great and what you would expect a Vegas lounge act to be.  The food was four star and traditional Italian."

The restaurant is located south of the Strip, about 10 minutes drive south of Mandalay Bay.  \n\nOrdered lasagna and  minestrone soup.  Also got some comlimentary garlic rolls that were pretty decent. The soup and lasagna were merely okay, not really stand-outish.  Filled me up but nothing special.\n\nOverall, I would say that Bootlegger is an okay italian place that's open 24/7 if you're craving a late nite fix, but not really a destination place."

However it is added to your bill for $25, then they tax and tip it +18% and plus 10%, and then take the $25 off.  You ultimately pay $7-$8 for it.\n\nLet's get to the real issues.\n\nMy wife is very particular about raw meat. She eats nothing less than little pink with brown.  I went through the motions of having the waiter describe what medium is, (red with pink), and medium well is (little pink with brown).  My wife was delivered a raw steak bleeding on the plate.  We asked for flash fry... Plate came back extremely hot... It was microwaved.  Classy.\n\nI was charged $12 to add shrimp scampi to my steak.  My steak came with an onion ring and 3 asparagus. No Scampi.  When the check came I asked about the $12, and he insinuated the scampi WAS on the steak.  This was soooo insulting.  I had to prove it did not come on my steak which was easy to do as I ate less than half as it was a tasteless NY bone off.  They have no steaks Bone-In.\n\nThe Antipasto salad  was also an issue.  I don't like olives, and didn't eat any and was fine.  My wife however threw up the whole night mostly olive and tomatoes... Maybe from the raw steak??? Who knows... My poor wife...\n\nLastly the auto gratuity for my family with 4 kids. (4, 6, and 8 years old)  Seems tacky to force gratuity on such a bad experience and mostly kids at the table.   It took over 10 minutes to get the check adjusted as he started over the bill to adjust the tax and gratuity.  Somehow with 4 kids the bill was over $200 after adjustments.  :( (reminding you there was no alcohol on the tab as the wine was \"free\")\n\nDon't go here.  The food isn't that good, service even worse.  Waiters with memory of a goldfish and then insulting you by not letting you give a deserving tip.  With service this bad, forcing gratuity is the only way they would get tips."

I ordered the Maria's saltimbocca for the main course and the meal takes a little longer to prepare but was it worth the wait?

They have gambling at the bar and overall it seems like a classy, nice place. The pizza and salad were really great and tasty and the pasta was pretty good too. I'm only giving it three stars because some (not all) of the waitstaff and bartenders tonight were incredibly rude to our group. We had a very large group of extras doing background work for a tv show and we were placed through out the restaurant and bar to set the scene. I heard the waiters bitch about it twice and the bartender kicked some extras out of their spot to let some other rude patrons sit there. That's unacceptable behavior! Whether bootleggers was paid to host this place for the show or offered it up for great exposure the staff shouldn't be taking it out on us background. If they have a problem they can take it up with the managers when the event is over. You can't kick background out of their seats when they are being filmed for so many reasons, most important being continuity. If it were me she would have told to move I'd have told her off and to take it up with someone else. She let her patrons disrespect the background extras as well, incredibly rude. Not to mention the drunk girl sitting by herself (not part of the background group)  they clearly over served that kept harassing extras."
