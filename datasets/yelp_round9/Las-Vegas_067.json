But could be due to the large room and many tables to wait on. staff was friendly.\n\nThings I enjoyed:\n- Sauteed pea shoots were good (order with waiter)\n- Fresh egg tarts (made to order)\n- turnip cakes were warm and fresh, but were not served with the brown sauce"

I had the cashew nut shrimp with a side of white rice, which is extra. It was simple, yet tasty. I have enough for breakfast tomorrow. The waiter checked on me often, and even gave my my leftover tea in a soup container, along with my food. The thing I hate is how the restaurants reek of cigarette smoke. This makes me eat my food fast, just to get the hell out of there! I know its not their fault, but damn! Meal was 22.00 not bad at all. They also said they don't use MSG which is great, because I'm allergic to it. Would come again if ever in Vegas, but I will wait another 16 years, like the last time I was here. LOL"

            "review": "We've tried some dim sum spots in Las Vegas and KJ at the Rio is our favorite. It still doesn't top what we're used to 2,500 miles away in NYC's Chinatown, but it's close enough and satisfies our appetite.\nThey have a good variety of dim sum and it's served hot like it should be. The soup dumplings are one of the best items, though this past Saturday they weren't very tasty. Maybe just a bad batch? Other favorites are the sesame balls, egg custard tarts, taro buns, pan-fried chive dumplings, and dumplings with peanuts inside. I wish they had sticky rice, the kind *not* wrapped in a leaf. We tend to go early to beat the crowds, so I'm sure we might be missing out on some variety that tends to come out later as mentioned by other Yelpers.\nWhat makes it stand out for us is the restaurant is clean, stroller friendly, and the cart ladies are nice, unlike NYC! I guess some might consider that part of the experience but I'm over it. There's always a lot of Chinese patrons, always a good sign.\nWe haven't tried enough of the regular menu to comment on it yet, but I've had the beef pan-fried noodles and they were excellent!\nSome things I don't like are how they charge for tea. Getting your check added up can take a while. We just walk it up to the back desk ourselves and pay there.\nChinese food is generally supposed to be cheap, so when I see outrageous prices at Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas (for example: bowl of won ton noodle soup in NYC - $5, Vegas Strip - $15!) it makes me nuts. KJ is a little pricey but worth it since it's currently the best place in town for dim sum."

The juice dumplings were a bit below average, and my favorite radish cakes were cold from being left out. Besides that, the seafood dumplings were my favorite (which has a clear exterior, and had a medley of seafood inside). I've heard that Ping Pang Pong is the other place that's also really good. \n\nService was quick, and they went out of their way to go get dishes that they had stopped serving. Awesome! After ordering a ton of items in a group of 5, it came out to $25/pp and we were stuffed with a decent amount of leftovers for a whole meal. \n\nIf I'm craving dim sum in the future, it'd be a close call between here and Dim Sum Cafe."

            "review": "Worst service ever. Went there on a Saturday night for dinner at about 6 pm. We got seated and waited about 15 minutes for someone to come ask us what we wanted for drinks so we tried to order food at the same time and the server just walks away. We ordered 4 dim sum plates, roasted duck, and beef chow fun. \n\nThe dim sum plates came out first. The ribs undercooked with the meat pink, shrimp was also undercooked. As for the beef chow fun, they half assed cooked it, from what it looked like they cooked the noodles separately and the beef, vegetable and sauce just getting dumped over. Sorry I'm not stupid, I eat it enough at other places to know that the noodles aren't white if it has been mixed with the sauce. Roast duck was super dry. HORRIBLE SERVICE and FOOD preparation. I couldn't even get a refill on water either. No racial but my gf and I were maybe a few of the couple asians(like 7) in there with the majority being white. When it came time to asking for the check it was like waiting in line at the dmv. C'mon now half the restaurant was empty and these fools can't even get me a bill? We really thought about just getting up and leaving. This place must treat people like this all the time cause they probably know tourist will stop by once but sorry I'm a LOCAL and not going back. NEVER AGAIN."

Servers are not really friendly and try to push everything.  They don't know how to explain what's in the dishes either.  Depending where you sit, you may never get some of the popular items since they are gone on the first several tables.  However, the Dim Sum is pretty good and the meals I've had were relatively cheap."

            "review": "Yay for Dim Sum! We were pretty excited. Both myself and my friend were on the hunt for good Dim Sum, having eaten it in SF and NYC. So, after asking for suggestions, I decided it was time to give KJ a whirl.\n\nWe were seated immediately and offered beverages (water and hot tea). The carts were slow to visit our table, but it was forgiven after I finally got some food in my belly. It was a bit difficult to understand the employees describing items, but fortunately I knew what I wanted. It did create an issue when I asked questions or requested specific items and I received the wrong information or wrong items. I asked three times if the cart had TURNIP Cake and I was given Taro Cake without realizing it. I asked for Shrimp Shumai, but I was given Shrimp Ha Gao. I asked for Char Siu Bao and I got a confused look. It felt like they weren't even listening or attempting.\n\nAnyway, we really enjoyed the Char Siu Bao, Shanghai Dumplings, Shrimp Ha Gao, Fried Shrimp Wanton, Turnip Cake, Beef Rice Noodle, Chow Mein, and Baked Salty Egg Yolk Cream Bun. They were all SO, SO delicious. Extremely filling, but I could've just kept eating.\n\nThe prices are wonderful as well and just such a fun atmosphere. I love small plates type of eating, no matter the cuisine. Yum! I would highly recommend the dishes above and go with at least three people since most of the plates have 3-4 pieces. Also, you're able to try even more!"

They know exactly what you want and they make it their duty to make sure you're the first to get it when it's ready!! ok, jk...they're not psychic, BUT they do get you what you want if you mention it, even if it's a whisper. I softly mentioned a few items that I was waiting for, at different times, and all the waiters seemed to overhear me. AND AHOY, off they went to find me my treasures! yum yum yum! \n\nQuality of the dim sum here is SO much better than the ones in Chinatown, so why bother going far off the strip? Food here actually reminds me of eating dim sum in hong kong! and it's on par with other authentic dim sum restaurants in San Gabriel Valley, where all the asians are. You must get the melting custard bun! Don't hesitate, just grab it because it sells out within a minute, no joke!! Don't repeat my mistake of just ordering one and realize it's sooo good that you want more. THERE WON'T BE ANY LEFT and you'll have to wait another 20 minutes :(\n\nThe only reason why this did not get five stars because I'm too cheap to eat here all the time. Prices are really high for dim sum; for example, it costs $30-40 for 9-11 dishes, depending on size of the dish."

Unfortunately he did not tell me that the dim sum standards in  Las Vegas were so low. \n\nI give them a 4 for getting me a place to sit quickly however after that the points go down quickly. It was over 5 minutes before a waitress came by and asked if I wanted something to drink. \n\nThe carts though plentiful only came by one out of four times.  The overall selection was somewhat limited and the flavors (or lack of) were not even close to the levels that got me to love dim sum. The chicken feet were undercooked and no flavor. The ribs were more fat then meat and again flavor lacking.  The shrimp were just average. \n\nMy recommendation is to go down to Spring Mountain Rd and try another type of Asian food which has much better flavors. There are a lot there with much higher quality, fetter taste and good prices.\n\nSo eat well Vegas but just by here. \n\nT"

He was staying at the Rio which was a major downgrade from the Delano LOL BUT this gentleman showed me Vegas the right way, where you're not supposed to be in the room anyway so it doesn't matter to much where you stay as long as you have comfort sleeping accommodations LOL.  So after a night/morning on the town we got back to the Rio at 10am , gambled and smoked cigars and finally went to sleep. At 2ish pm we were staaaarving. I wanted Hash house a gogo on the property but these mofos close early. WTF! So I started checking the hours of all the eateries in the Casino. We decided on dim sum. \n\n  \n    Came down stairs and walked right on in. No wait, which is nice because we were starving! The service was nice, a little language barrier but overall we understood each other even though we did order something off the cart we didn't want (his fault) LOL. It was some tripe dish and I'm not about that tripe life HAHA. Ok maybe in  Bon bo hue soup but that's about it :p We ordered some dumplings, fried rice and two meat dishes.  Even though I don't recall our items, I recall them all being quite tasty. I was very satisfied and got full fast! \n\n  This was a great hangover meal and if I'm in the same predicament  , I'd come back :p"

We came at 12pm, so I'm sure most were just made.\n- I would definitely get the shrimp rice noodle and crystal shrimp dumpling! My FAVES!\n- For desserts, get the egg custard and tofu pudding!

I was also surprised to see that our party of 6 could be seated right away considering we were there on a holiday weekend during peak dinner hours.\n\nHowever, what really bothered me was how scatter brained the wait staff was. The table next to us was waiting most of their meal for their order of fried rice to come out. So much so that when we got our order, they thought that it was their order (so did we...and even the waiter wasn't sure so he had to go back and check). We also asked for our sweet & sour soup to come out first (as it should) and yet it came out 2nd and only after we asked our waitress where it was. \n\nThis just seemed to be the place's MO. On several occasions we saw servers come up to our & others' tables with food in their hand not sure if they were to put them down or bring them to a different table. \n\nIf the are able to straighten this out, this restaurant would be a great place to check out while at the Rio. However, until then, if I want some good Chinese food, I'll just drive down the street a bit & visit Vegas' Chinatown."

He said he had just discovered this restaurant was at the hotel and said they had amazing Dim Sum. It is rather hard to see although it is right across from the entrance to the World Buffet. It seems to get dwarfed by it's surroundings. If there is one issue with this place I would have to say it's in the communications area.\nWe asked how the Dim Sum came since the menu did not say if it was priced per piece, two pieces,etc. The current waiter ( we saw three total in a little under an hour) then told us Dim Sum is only served until 3 PM ( maybe they should change the name of the restaurant !) We decided we would just order something else. The menu is quite extensive. We landed on Mushu Chicken appetizer and Shrimp Pan Fried noodles. Waiter #3 came back and asked if we wanted the Pan Fried Noodles Cantonese style...crispy dry noodles on bottom and sauce on top? I said yes, that's the way I like it.\nThe Mushu came out very quickly. It was love at first bite. I can honestly say it was the best tasting Mushu I have ever had. Flavors were perfectly balanced, sauce was light and both the meat and veggies tasted fresh. A delight!\n Waiter #3 returned to ask if I was sure that's how we wanted the Pan Fried Noodles reminding me it was dry at the bottom and sauce on top...I said I was sure. Then he came back one more time to ask if we needed silverware...we said no, we are fine with chopsticks.\nThe Pan Fried Noodles came out rather readily thereafter. They were wonderful as well. The noodles were tasty,slightly browned on the bottom and crispy throughout until the top sauce softened them. The sauce was again perfectly balanced in flavors and very light. We told the waiter that everything was really good and he nodded politely. They are not big conversationalists here but are quiet and polite. Either way, the food was superb.\n I heard quite a bit of yelling in the kitchen and they seemed to be well staffed with servers and runners and it did look like maybe they were putting forth managerial effort to keep the kitchen from getting backed up. There were a lot of Asian diners and I believe the wait staff is trying to make sure that non-Asians know what they are getting. Some people are upset if it not like American take out Chinese food...and it's not...much more authentic...and it is really good...and I will definitely return."

Waiters still pushed carts from table to table up selling items we wanted or to pass up. Our table came to order the following dishes:\n\n- Pork siu mai \n- Calamari\n- Chinese broccoli\n- Pan fried noodles with chicken\n- BBQ pork bun\n- Rice noodle wrapped with beef\n- Roast duck \n\nAll these items were very tasty. The rice noodle wrapped with beef, calamari, and the pan fried noodles with chicken were my personal favorites. The rice noodle dish was something new to me, but reminded me of my love for beef chow fun. The pan fried noodles were semi-crispy but soft and paired well with the tender chicken.\n\nService was not the greatest. It gets busy to a point where your table maybe forgotten. One of the waitresses spilled water on my friend and apologized. \n\nOverall experience: 3.5 stars"

They did ask if we wanted to share a table with others, we declined.  It was weird to have a Mexican waiter asked us what kind of tea we wanted to drink.  We sat for over 10-15 minutes and only two carts came by our table with nothing of interest to us.  We were really disappointed with their food service or lack of it.  The dim sum was okay, but not a very wide selection of dim sum to choose from.  There were a lot of items that were missing from the usual dim sum fare.  We didn't see any desserts carts at all.  The taste wasn't bad, but definitely not as good as those dim sum restaurants in L.A.  So only 3.5 stars from me."

I ordered the lobster egg rolls.  Waited 15 minutes before (I think) waitress told me they were out of lobster egg rolls (not exactly sure what the reason was her  English wasn't great..but she blamed the chef.)  My partner was almost finished eating his mongolian beef meal by that time.  My vegetable order- which was placed less than 3 minutes after my partner placed his Mongolian beef order- was also delivered 15 minutes after he was served (again she blamed the chef.).  The final nail on the coffin was I asked a half an hour before my check came to have a mango pudding saved for my dessert. The pudding was on the dim sum menu which ended at 3PM.  Waitress said she would save one.  Then half an hour later I was given the check with no mango pudding.  Had to track down the waitress who said she was already over her shift time and was supposed to leave at 3PM and she said she was told pudding was sold out. I asked her why she didn't save me one as she had promised and she just made excuse after excuse that everything was the chef''s fault and not hers. She didn't want to pull one until I was finished with my meal.  I wasn't offered any discount for the lousy service.  I was told the manager leaves at 3PM for me to make complaints and it was 3:15 at that time. It is now dinnertime and I have again been told the manager isn't there and to call back tomorrow.  Although my baby bok choy in garlic sauce was delicious, both the spring rolls I had substituted for the lobster rolls and my partner's mongolian beef were awful.  The beef was very chewy. The only thing great about the place was the ambience which is much better than KJs original restaurant on Spring Mountain Rd.  Same bad, uncaring  service though. Save yourself the stress.  If you are not Asian and can't speak or understand their lingo it's nothing but frustrating.  Only one person there spoke English well enough to understand and he was outta there by 3PM."

These places reside in the older hotel casino places that are designed to attract more value-minded Chinese people who are looking for cheaper limit gambling and are comfortable having something familiar and convenient without having to leave the premises.  We were attracted to KJ because someone told my wife that they had the best dim sum in Vegas, but that just makes me feel more leery of the local standards for such food...\n\nThe dining room is large and expansive, especially when compared to PPP.  The feel is like that of an 80's style HK or Cantonese dim sum house complete with old school push carts making their rounds.  On the day we went, the dining room wasn't half filled at 1130am, but ebbed and flowed while we were there and seemed busier by the time we were finished.  The crowd was not very diverse, about 95% Chinese which was probably a good sign actually...\n\nThe three of us each picked the items that we liked although I wasn't feeling particularly adventurous this day as I only went for the items that I personally wanted.  Usual staples such as haw gow and siu mai I didn't even bother trying myself this time.  Some of the items were disappointing because they were not piping hot like the Vegetarian Pan Fried Rice Noodles (haw fun) and the Fried Turnip Cake (low bok go) was downright cold, to the point that we had to ask them to return it to the kitchen where they reheated it as opposed to replacing it with a fresh one.  The service didn't balk when we asked them to do this and was polite and attentive all around and the push-cart ladies were mostly cheerful...\n\nI had the Sticky Rice (new my fon) wrapped in leaves and the Thousand Year Egg Porridge (pay don sow yuk juk) and was generally satisfied  although both of them were not particularly special and maybe even a little flat or bland tasting...\n\nI found the Green Tea Buns surprisingly good.  Their outside texture was not unlike a pineapple bun with a crumbly, crusty top but the flavor of the filling was not quite as sweet as a pineapple bun.  Two out of three of these on the plate had a lighter color than the third one which I can only assume meant that they came from different batches...\n\nSince it wasn't too crowded during our visit it was nice that we didn't have to fight over the items in the carts with other patrons, but the bad side is that you worry about food turnover and items becoming stale and in some cases cold.  I was generally satisfied with our experience although nothing particularly felt special or stood out to me, but my expectations could be affected by my experience with places like Ping Pang Pong where I had very low expectations but was pleasantly surprised, and then coming here after being recommended to us.  I would return but probably not come out of my way, aside from being in LV in the first place..."

KJ is certainly a very welcomed new addition.\n\nLocated in the Rio Hotel off-strip, KJ is actually just across the street from the Gold Coast Casino where Ping Pang Pong is located.  I can see some friendly competition there LOL!\n\nKJ is a bit more upscale; the ambience is nicer, and of course the place is newer.  The service we had was also actually very good for a Chinese dim sum place.  The last 2 times I was in Ping Pang Pong I actually found the service rather chaotic.  So this is definitely a +1 for KJ.\n\nThe dim sum was above average, and actually really good by Vegas standard.  The congee rivaled some of the best in the SGV.  Pork spareribs were yummy and there was more meat than bones.  Cool!  Bean curb wrap was good and so was the steamed taro cake.  We also liked the beef balls although I found the Chinese bbq sauce flavor a bit too overwhelming.\n\nThe basic staples - har gow and siu mai - were only average.  The har gow skin was thick and mushy and the shrimp filling didn't taste fresh.\n\nThis is really 3.5 stars  but in Vegas we'll need to keep our expectations reasonable, so I'll give it 4 Vegas stars."

This restaurant located right across from the buffet, so we made the wrong wrong decision to fill our stomach.\n\nService: We waited for some time until someone came up from the restaurant to assign us a table. The dinning area wasn't full at that time, so obviously they were  understaffed. It was also very hard to get waiters' attention *any time*. I asked for something not on the menu to get a vegetable dish and also asked how much it would that be. The waiter told me it would be $10ish. Then he suggested Treasure Island Pea Sprout. I assumed it would have a similar price and didn't ask further. However, we found that this dish costed $10 more expensive. They also forgot our dimsum order, which was also printed on the bill. Given that this restaurant didn't even have a line waiting at the door, this mistake is not acceptable. \n\nFood: Their food was on the salty side, such as seafood eggplant in a claypot, Cantonese style beef. They taste good with rice, though. The green bean dish we got was half raw. Chow fun and Yang-chow fried rice was good. However, they are not even par to average in the line of Chinese food IMO. It could be that I am spoiled by SF  Chinese food. There's no free dessert, but there are fortune cookies when checkout. \n\nPrice: This place is overpriced given the food quality and service. \n\nIf you are craving for Asian food, I would recommend dropping by the Asian food court around Chinatown mall on Spring Mountain Rd. Food/price is much better/more reasonable there."

Do not come to early because the all food might not be ready yet, do not come too late otherwise there might not be anything left.

When you do come around the before mentioned time, the thongs of antsy Chinese people will bum rush the hostess stand. Get your number and back away slowly. No one needs to get hurt. Stand too close to the podium and you will get stampeded. \n\nIt is hard to go wrong when you come with a group of eight people, load up the lazy susan and still walk away with a relatively small bill. The food is good and was steaming hot when it hit the table. The taste was some of the best in town. The only complaint is that they ran out of so many dishes. By the end of our lunch, the meager pickings would not satisfy the avid dim sum goer. \n\nThe food: all the classics are solid. Har gow, shu mai, chicken feet, veggies in bean curd wrappers, pan fried noodles, and veggies sauteed with garlic are all tasty. The desserts are the star here. We were warned to save room for all the sweet treats. In the end, half of them were out and we were disappointed. No sesame balls, no soft bean curd, only eight sad faces.

The wait for a table was maybe 10 minutes as I went during prime time for lunch (around 12pm). After I was seated at my table, I ordered the usual things you'd usually get when you go dim sum. Siu Mai, Steamed chicken feet , and sticky rice wrapped w/ lotus leaves. Very fresh, flavored well, and steaming hot ! When even I say hot, its HOT. \n\nThe chicken feet were flavored well. Not over seasoned, though tendons still a little chewy (could have used a few more minutes in the steamer) but still pretty well done. \n\nThe pork siu mai was topped with some masago (capelin roe). Steaming hot. Flavor was good. The pork was \"chewy\", not in a bad sense but it has a slight resistance that shows it was made properly. There is a fairly decent size shrimp piece in there as well, that was not over cooked. \n\nThe sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves was nice. Wrapped normally with a few lotus leaves. Did not fall apart as i was taking the leaves off. Flavored well, good amount of ingredients inside the sticky rice. \n\nAfter a few other items were ordered, ranging from a few different buns, shrimp rice noodle, pan fried chives dumpling, and egg tarts. \n\nThere were two types of buns i had ordered. One was called (directly translated) leaking sand bun which was made with i believe a salted egg yolk mixture which when you pull apart the bun, the rich, egg yolk mixture oozes out. perfectly made. that's the result you'd look for when you get this bun. hot from the oven, before the bun itself soaks up this yolk mixture. very delicious. \n\nthe other bun (directly translated) is called the snow mountain bun. Has a white crust on top with i believe a lotus filling. Very good. Nice and hot off the cart. \n\nThe shrimp rice noodle was well-made also. Good thickness to the noodle and a good sized shrimp lined in the middle of the noodle, topped with a soy sauce that was prepared to be slightly sweet. \n\nThe pan fried chives dumping is one of my favorite items to get. Parts of the outer skin layer crispy due to the pan fried technique while the size is still nice and soft. The filling had ample amounts of Chinese chives, shrimp, and pork. Seasoned really well, not overpowering the natural tastes of the chives or meats. \n\nLast but not least, is the egg tarts.. Fresh out of the oven, nice flaky golden crust with a glimmering, shiny egg filling in the middle. The crust was warm and flaky but still unable to taste the butter? they use to create the flaky crust mixed with a bite of the the slightly sweet egg center. One of the many favorite dim sum items or snack items among the chinese communities. \n\nUnfortunately this was my first meal, so I didnt get to order much before I was stuffed. I will not hesitate to come back again for another round of dim sum. \n\nA little suggestion, try going with 4-6 people in your party if you want to try a good amount of the dishes they offer during lunch. Lunch is served between 10 AM and 3 PM. Don't hesitate to go early or late ! They will specially prepare the item of your choice even if you don't see it available on the cart. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable, especially considering this restaurants sits inside the Rio Casino & Resort. The prices are as followed:\n\nSmall: $2.28\nMedium: $3.18\nLarge: $3.98\nSpecial: $4.98\n\n*edit*\n\nI went again recently. One thing to note was the service was quite lacking. Forgotten orders or took a while to serve us."

For a place with Dim Sum in the name, that advertises hours of 10 am- 2 am you would think they served Dim Sum all day.\n\nSettled for the chinese food instead, Chow Fun, Mongolian Beef and Sweet N Sour Pork (figured I could spice it up with chili paste and make it taste similar to Szechuan which I prefer).got back to my room only to discover they gave me fried rice instead of Chow Fun, but I was too tired to go back. Not that it would have mattered because it was all so bland. Even the pork! I mean, how hard is it to make Sweet n Sour Pork. The fried rice was nothing but white rice layered with raw cabbage, julienned white onions and beef cubes. No sesame oil, no soy, no carrots, no flavor. Even the chili paste was bland. If this is the top in Vegas I'd hate to see what the rest are like."

On this recent mother-daughter trip to Vegas, I knew I had to find a way to include this somewhere in the itinerary, and luckily my Vegas local friend pooky b highly recommended KJ.  \n\nLocated inside the Rio, across from the Carnival World Buffet, this Cantonese cuisine restaurant that's been opened for only two months offered just what we needed: delicious and better yet, reasonably-priced dim sum for lunch. I'm very impressed by how the steamed items were seriously piping hot and fresh, with a good amount of variety to choose from. Of the things we tried, shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, tripe, beef wrapped in flat rice noodle, tofu flower dessert, pan-fried shrimp and chive dumplings, they all tasted absolutely fabulous, maybe even exceeding the flavors of some dim sum restaurants in San Francisco. \n\nMy only gripe is that if you are a solo non-native diner, the cart ladies may easily pass you up. You really have to be assertive if you want them to stop by your table. Other than that, service was pretty good and I'm sure my mom really enjoyed it, which was the most important thing. She liked it so much that she even took a stack of business cards to bring home to distribute to her friends!"

About 6 minutes later the food started arriving fast. Here is the scoop on our food....\n\nSpring rolls....tightly wrapped and super delicious.\n\nHot and sour soup...huge bowl, best I have ever had..took some home.\n\nScallops with seasonal greens....omg! So good and so many scallops, had broccoli cooked perfectly with mushrooms, onions and red pepper flakes...so good.\n\nBeef tenderloin app...different as the beef is chilled and sliced thin. Comes with pickled veggie strips that are amazing.\n\nSweet and sour chicken...huge portion and so tasty.\n\nYou can get a bowl of steamed rice for $1.00 as a base .\n\nThe servers are quick and polite though not overly friendly ( they were busy) .\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is nice and room comfortable.\n\nI took off one star as they did not offer even fortune cookies for desert and did not seem very welcoming ( again maybe because they were busy) but for the price, the could offer fortune cookies after the meal.\n\nI will for sure be back though."

The younger servers dressed in polo shirts are pretty nice and will do what you ask.  However, we had one lady in the standard button-up and vest. I'm assuming she's been working here for a while.  Well, if you're working at a casino restaurant, you should know how to treat customers.\n\nWe asked our server for drinks. They didn't have Pepsi, she said they only had diet pepsi and other sodas. Okay, cool. So we ordered two other sodas and a water. However, when we came out, she only brought one soda and two waters. We said thank you and apologized, and that we actually asked for another soda (and not the second water). So she rolled her eyes, huffed, threw her hands up and said, \"Can you guys order all at once?\" She pointed to the kitchen at the back of the room, (we were seated near the entrance) and continued to say, \"I just came all the way from over there.\", making it seem like getting drinks was sooo hard for her to do.\n\nMy dad apologized to her and explained that she must've heard us incorrectly. Before she left to get our soda, my dad apologized again. Not our server. Must be a generational thing for him to apologize to her for the miscommunication, but she definitely should have not given us an attitude about it."

More of a \"community\" type meal where you share orders. \n\n1.) We always start with the CRAB MEAT & FISH MAW soup. This can serve about 7 people (small bowl) but honestly I can never have just one! Not too salty with a porridge type texture. A must try! (8/10)\n\n2.) A hidden gem that's not on the menu, you have to ask for the FRENCH BEEF. It is not a large dish, but the meat is seriously cooked and seasoned to utter perfection! Another must try. (10/10)\n\n3.) We also get the crispy PAN FRIED NOODLES, which is honestly more of his favorite, are crispy noodles that soften with the sauce it is topped with -- comes with vegetables, shrimp, scallops and fish. This is his go-to... He swears by it! (9/10)\n\n4.) To add some veggies into the mix, you can't go wrong with CHINESE BROCOLLI WITH OYSTER SAUCE. A generous amount of the steamed, leafy stalks with a side of the brown sauce (a little goes a long way!) (9/10)\n\n5.) I personally am not a big fan of the SALT & PEPPER PORK CHOPS, but it's something he always orders too. A tad oily for my taste and honestly too salty. I'm not a big fan of pork or super oily and salty foods, so this is just not for me. (3/10)\n\n6.) Probably one of my newest favorites is the BEEF CHOW FUN. Wide rice noodles with tender stir-fried beef with bean sprouts & onions... So savory. I can eat just one order and nothing else, it's that good! (10/10)\n\n7.) I'm a big fan of fried rice, and I must say this place has amazing CRAB MEAT FRIED RICE. It's not too oily and is not too salty... A good portion and pairs well with anything you order! (9/10)"

It's not complimentary, I think it's like 3 or 5 dollars, but it's unlimited refills, and nothing goes better with dim sum than hot tea.\n\nSo there are carts rolling around the place that are loaded with goodies that you can just pick and choose which dishes you want. Definitely if you are going here, I would recommend ordering the har gow (shrimp dumplings), shumai, pork bao, and coeng fan (rice noodle rolls). And, save some room for dessert, their egg custard tarts are fantastic, as well as their green tea and taro buns. But, always be open to trying new things, that's the key to dim sum.\n\nNot everything I thought was stellar. First, the XLB or \"soup dumplings\" are not very appetizing. There is hardly any broth inside, and it's basically all wrapper. And, the char siu baau is pretty average, with it tasting more of sauce, rather than pork. And sometimes another issue I have, not all the dim sum are piping hot, which I feel should be.\n\nOverall, this place is really great, with the positives greatly outnumbering the negatives. Some people have told me that this place is comparable to some of the best dim sum spots in cities that have a large dim sum presence.

If you like the original KJK in Chinatown, you'll love this NEW one in Rio.\n\nThe YELPY Version:\n\nYesterday afternoon, my friend and I decided to give the new KJK a try, and was delighted by how good its dimsums (we had 4 different kinds, at $1.50-$3.60 each) and the \"Seafood Noodles\" ($15) tasted! Happy to report that our dimsums were as good as those we had in the best of Chinese dimsum restaurants, and the noodle dish the same quality as that from the ORIGINAL KJK in Chinatown. For our wonderful afternoon meal, the tab was $28, including Tea and Tax.\n\nBy the way, the quantity of the dishes was pretty good, too. After all those tasty dimsums, as delicious as the plate of noodles was, we could not finish it, we flipped a coin for the leftover, and darn, my friend won the toss and took it home!\n\nThis huge restaurant was ~80% full around 2pm, and we were not surprised. My friend and I are regulars of the original KJK, and we will definitely frequent the NEW one as well - when we have a craving for dimsums and/or want to dine in a more \"plush\", upscale setting.\n\nAlthough this NEW KJ Kitchen opened only very recently in Rio Casino, its ORIGINAL location in Chinatown has been a favorite for local Asians (and some smart and some \"Well Informed\" Westerners) for years - for its very tasty Chinese dishes at reasonable prices. That small, popular (thus) crowded, original KJK in Chinatown was not well known to most tourists other than those lucky Asians from Los Angeles, however, perhaps because it is NOT listed on the TripAdvisor Network? Now, the NEW KJK in Rio will be a TREAT to the TOURISTS, as well as to the LOCALS! In addition to its traditional, great tasting Chinese dishes that it is famous for, the NEW KJK also offers a variety of delicious dimsums, all at moderate prices, which the original KJK does not.\n\nPeterskis, Apr 2012"

            "review": "\"At the end of the day I am at peace because my intentions are good and my heart is pure.\"\n\nLet me get to the heart of the matter... KJ is easily the best Dim Sum that I've experienced in Vegas. Formerly, I visited a few spots, mostly Ping Pang Pong, Cathay House, and Orchids...all because I had my heart set on something specific. These establishments often had items I would enjoy, but also would routinely break my heart with other underwhelming items. KJ Dim Sum & Seafood does everything as good or better than the rest. It's not that my heart skipped a beat upon tasting KJ's offerings, but after experiencing several quality items on my first visit I had a change of heart with both my dim sum expectations and my restaurant choice.\n\nI never claimed to be an expert in anything Chinese...but if you'll allow me to wear my heart on my sleeve for a moment, I did read a Wikipedia Page on Dim Sum, so with complete, absolute, and total uncertainty I can tell you that Dim Sum (dmsm; \u70b9\u5fc3; \u9ede\u5fc3) could maybe, perhaps, and even possibly be translated as: Touching the heart...a gesture from the heart...how it is that one's heart is so...a gift from the heart. The gifts at KJ Dim Sum & Seafood include Har Gau (Shrimp Dumpling), Lau Sa Bao (Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun), Shrimp Rice Noodle, Daan Taat (Egg Custard Tart), Fried Shrimp Balls, Siu Mai (Pork Dumpling), Taro Bun, etc. These are some of my favorites to satisfy my bleeding heart, but if I truly bare my heart, there are many other items I've enjoyed at KJ over several visits as well.\n\nAs others have noted you need to time your visit right, so bring some patience and your heart of gold. It is actually better to have to wait in line a little if you are looking for the largest variety and freshest food. This waiting period can be a great chance for a little heart-to-heart with your dinning companions though. When they are busy they obviously turn over more food, so the carts are re-filled quicker. There is also a better variety during the busier times because they know they will find someone willing to take all of the different types of items the kitchen produces. If you're a man after my own heart, this variety is welcomed in dim sum options. In contrast, if you come too early or too late, the food will sit on the carts a little longer and the number of different items made will decrease...and in this case, absence does not make the heart grow fonder.\n\nKJ is known for their food, not their service. Their service has even been know to break your heart from time to time. However, there are levels of service that can be expected. Like many Chinese options at this price point, the service will not be that great. For best service, the faint of heart would do well to bring a Cantonese speaker that doesn't mind being vocal to nearby carts. If you are out of luck there, then ask questions...even a group of white folks can manage to get what their heart's desire without too much difficulty, but you need to be proactive. If you can't be proactive simply say a prayer, cross your heart...and hope to die?...actually just point to things that look good.\n\nSo boldly follow your heart as you venture in to KJ Dim Sum & Seafood to eat your heart out! I sincerely hope, from the bottom of my heart, that you enjoy the experience. And if you don't rest assured that dim sum isn't really all that expensive so it won't hurt the bank that much and after all, a heavy purse makes a light heart.\n\nDisclaimer: Sorry to reiterate the heartfelt sentiments so often in this review. I was listening to Crazy on You by Heart at the time of writing."

Although their chrysanthemum tea was really good, their food was alright. Also, they charge for hot tea so make sure you don't mindlessly agree to hot tea when they ask you. In socal, the tea was always free.:(\n\nThe best dish we had was the beef chunks that was still sizzling as it was placed on our table. Everything else wasn't worth mentioning.

So there was no excuse.\n\nMy husband and I ordered soup, mongolian beef, and steamed rice to share.\n\nAfter 15-20 minutes, no soup had appeared. But our waiter dropped the mongolian beef on our table and before he ran off, my husband reminded him that we had ordered soup. More time passed, and no soup. Also, no rice had been delivered to us, so we couldn't really enjoy the Mongolian Beef, which was getting colder by the minute.\n\nFinally a different waitress stopped by and we told her we were waiting for our soup.\n\nShe disappeared into the kitchen, and finally our original waiter came out with the soup and served it to us. We reminded him about the rice, and he said the rice wouldn't be ready for five minutes.\n\nWe ate our soup, all the while our beef dish sitting getting cold, and still no rice.\n\nA different waiter stopped at our table, and we asked for rice and she said it was ready. Eventually someone brought it to us.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, but being from the Bay Area, it's nothing above average.\n\nBut the service pretty much ruined the meal for us.\n\nAlso, it was very overpriced. $13.95 for hot & sour soup, the other soups were $19.95. Mongolian Beef was I think $12.95.  All the food at the Rio is overpriced though. See my other review about their \"All American Bar & Grill.\" Another bad experience. I would be really afraid to have Dim Sum there and not know how much you were being charged until the end. Oh, and the family at the table next to us got into an argument with the waiter about their bill at the end of their meal.\n\nWould definitely not recommend this place."

I wish that I'd stuck to that instead of making an impromptu detour to try out this nearby restaurant.\n\nKJ Dim Sum & Seafood is conveniently located near the Valley View entrance of the Rio. Just park outside (assuming that's allowed/available) or in the \"Carnival\" parking garage and it's a quick walk that won't even take you by any slot machines.\n\nToday was the Monday following Easter weekend, and peak lunch was exceedingly busy. I would guess that the vast majority of their clientele today was Chinese tourists. We had a roughly 20-minute wait for a table for two (important: keep the \"raffle\" ticket which the host gives to you). After we were seated, we received a small a la carte menu, which we simply ignored. The dim sum carts arrived promptly.\n\nMy favorites today were the cheong fun (rice noodle rolls with shrimp) and the egg tart. The rice noodles were fluffy and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The sauce complemented the dish just right. Make sure they cut it into smaller pieces for you. The egg tart was one of my last bites, and even though I was full (and bored with the other items), my taste buds were thrilled. The flaky crust and hot egg custard that unexpectedly started to melt on the tongue were fantastic.\n\nThe chicken feet were pretty good. I'd order them again. The turnip cake was fine, with a bit of a crisp on the outside and enough seasoning throughout that it might be enjoyed on its own. The har gow (shrimp dumplings) were tasty, but the shell was too easily torn apart, making it hard to fish out of the metal container.\n\nThat's about all that I'd reorder from today's choices. The shu mai was disappointingly bland for some reason. The shrimp balls were even worse. They were too hard and something was very off about the interior. Either there was too much flour, or the shrimp was too mushy. It just wasn't the typical juicy shrimp interior, and the mayo sauce should not have been wholly necessary to rescue the shrimp. Finally, I'd have to classify the taro dumplings as another letdown. They were smaller than expected, and not as flavorful. I appreciate that they weren't dripping with oil, but that's not why I eat dim sum.\n\nPrices are were $2.28-$3.98 per dish, and $1.00 per person for hot jasmine tea. Service was surprisingly decent, with quick responses to such concerns as lack of soy and XO sauces on the table, requests for a to-go box, and closing the check. All of these were positives, but not enough to outweigh the boredom of the majority of the meal.\n\nKJ Dim Sum just didn't live up to their reputation. This would be a 7/10 if I could rate it that way. I don't get decimals in this 5-star scale, and the disappointments today outweighed the few positives, so I'm saddened but content to round it down. I'd easily stop by again to ask for egg tarts and possibly cheong fun to-go, and that's about it."

I love dim sum, and I have been used to the best in Manila because of our proximity with China.  But when we moved here to Vegas, it's been quite a challenge looking for good dim sum.  Thanks to the suggestion of a dear friend, we've decided to give it a go.  The first thing you immediately notice is the vibrancy of the place.  High ceilings, uncrowded tables, red walls, soft lighting and very clean/crisp table cloths.  So often you see dim sum places pay little attention to details. (The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)  \n\nWe came early thinking to avoid the crazy rush hour which we did, but unfortunately could not order anything off the dim sum menu since the chef arrives at 11:15am.  Make sure you go after that time of you want to enjoy their fried rice, noodles or other entrees.  But you will have plenty to choose from the dim sum carts whizzing by - from congee/rice porridge with century egg, silken tofu, fried shrimp wantons, egg custards, taro cakes, pork buns and dumplings.  Our favorites were the steamed pork buns, hargaw or shrimp dumplings and the sweet spare ribs.  They tasted like they were all freshly made and although they still do not quite compare to the stuff we grew up with, esp from Binondo (Chinatown)... they are the best dim sum I've had so far in Vegas.\n\nIf I had one small quibble, it's that the soy sauce in their Kikkoman jars did not taste like Kikkoman.

The fish dish took a long time and we were joking that they must have gone fishing. When it finally came, we were mostly full. Then came the bill, and there was a $104 dish! We were really surprised and asked what it was. It was the fish! It was supposed to be $38/lb, and the fish weighed 2.7 lb! The fact was none of us heard that it was $38 per pound. The bill was presented to us by someone we had not seen, and the waiter was nowhere to be seen. When we questioned the bill, another person came up and said something like \"of course it was $38 per pound...\" No apology even for confusion or anything like that sort. We paid the bill, feeling cheated. Now coming to think of it, the fish could not have weighted 2.7 lbs. I often steam fish myself and a 2 lb fish is already pretty big, and our fish that day was at most 2lbs.\nI would give it no star if possible."

First of all, just because you sell appetizer sized portions of certain foods does not make you a dim sum restaurant.  Having eaten in San Francisco at some of the best Dim Sum locations where the food arrives on carts and you choose what you want for small prices, I was a bit surprised to find that this is nothing more than a chinese restaurant with some unusual items on the menu like clay pots.  The prices, while good for chinese food are not great for dim sum and you won't be able to try 20 different selections unless you want to spend a ton.    The food we ordered was mixed.  The lobster spring rolls had decent chunks of what appeared to be lobster but had no lobster taste to it.  In fact, they were ultra bland.  The walnut shrimp was tasty as was the sizziling seafood which included scallops, calamari, an unidentifyable fish, shrimp and more.  The sweet and sour pork was also lacking in flavor but was not overly soggy.  They are less than generous on the rice portions.\n\nI agree with other reviewers that services is lacking and there is absolutely no atmosphere in this place so don't expect a romantic meal.  I am sure there are better Dim Sum locations within 20 miles of this place."

When I notice I left my wallet in the restaurant, I immediately went back to restaurant in 2 minutes, the table cloth is already changed, and I asked if they see my wallet, they said no. (I don't think the other guest took it because they were old couple having their vacation and they were sitting faraway from our table.)  I know I should make sure take care of my wallet to myself, but I am sure that I left my wallet there. I wanted to check the camera, one of the waitress talked to me she had to ask with her boss. She told me to come back next day. I was thinking if nobody (employees) took my wallet then I will just let it go. But I am 90% sure that one of them took my wallet. next day, and the day after next day, she refused me to take look at the record of that day. The reason is just because her boss is busy. This restaurant is the worst experience that I never had in my life."

One dish has little food on it. i started to eat at this kj restaurant at 10:30, and i f**king only ate got 4 plate in 2 and half hours!!!!!!!! finally, i asked the server if they can order my food for me, they say, go check the food cart, but where is the f**king food cart.!!! i finally take the to go, because i cant sit at there any more."

I have been coming here shortly after they opened, so it has been a couple years now. Time to write them a review. \n\nFood- everything I have tried was fresh and yummy. I personally love leek and taro, so I really enjoy their leek items here. I have the following list that I order every time I go.\n\n1.Teochew Dumplings (\u6f6e\u5dde\u7c89\u7cbf)-- I enjoy their Teochew dumplings every time I go. This is a dumplings with clear noodle wrap and filled with leek, water chestnut and pork.  \n2.Pan fried Leek Dumplings(\u97ed\u83dc\u9905)--love their pan fried leek dumplings as well. It's perfectly made with enough leek and meat to make it juicy not dry.\n3. Shrimp in rice noodle wrap (\u8766\u8178\u7c89)-- this dish tastes the same at most dim sum places you go but their shrimp is a decent size. This item is on a must list whenever I go to dim sum as well.\n4. Fried Taro pastries -- the crunchiness of the outside and the moist/ soft taro inside, yummy!!!! This dish is not a dessert, the taro inside is seasoned with salt and other stuff. \n5.Shumei -- their shumei is decent. I would say it's better than most places in Vegas but somehow I still love shumei from Jasmine inside of Bellagio the best. \n6.Shrimp dumplings/ Haogow-- it's also a must ordered dish when I go to dim sum. It's not too bad here also. \n7. Sticky rice wrapped in leaf -- I love sticky rice and this dish here is decent as well. Definitely give it a try.\n8.Pineapple Buns -- I order this item from time to time. They have green tea flavor now which is different and interesting.\n9. Tofu Dessert soup -- I love tofu and they are very generous with the portion. Silky tofu in ginger and sugar soup. Yummy.\n10. Last not least. The famous Egg Tarts -- I love love love their egg tarts here. Majority of time when I ordered, it's hot and fresh like they just came out of oven. I have not tried egg tarts from golden gate bakery but this is one of the best that I tried before. Although I do wish they have Portuguese egg tarts here! \n\nServices-- they are usually busy so they are not as attentive as I would like them to be but they are usually very friendly even though you don't speak Cantonese. Unlike some other places in town, if you don't speak Cantonese In a Cantonese restaurants, you get some kind of attitude :/. \n\nEnvironment -- the place is big and clean. Also its got many TVs in here. \n\nAll in all, I love this place. When I visited Koi Palace in SF (the famous dim sum place), I was not happy with an hour wait, the attitude was bad and the food was just okay. KJ dim sum you rock!"

But yesterday was the last and dual final time I will be coming here.  \n\n1st - they now charge $1 per person for tea, which normally I wouldn't mind, I understand tea gets expensive and can add up.  But the jasmine tea tasted like hot water with a hint of color to it, no Jasmine taste what so ever. \n\nService is slow and servers all looked unhappy. I'm Chinese, and trust me I'm used to Asian restaurants with bad or no service, it just comes with dining at an Asian restaurant. Especially Chinese.  But this has got to be the worst I've had in a long time. \n\nSat down, was asked what kind of tea would you like. Not aware $1 per person. I ordered the stream rice rolls with cilantro n green onion with the server.  15 minutes went by, not a single food cart. Entire restaurant 4 carts, steam cart, congee cart, miscellaneous food,  and Chinese broccoli cart.  The ladies were pushing them like the wheels were broken or something!  Finally the stream cart came by. We ordered 8 dishes my Mom, boyfriend, n myself) figured we load up since it took so long.  The same cart with the same food came by 3 times after that, no new items.  I asked for steamed tripe, and shrimp rice rolls and she looked around at the other carts and said \"I don't have it.\"  \n\nI finally get my order of cilantro and green onion rice roll, only to see a plan ol' plate of steam rolls, no herb. I told the lady I wanted cilantro n green onion. She walked up to the waitress that I placed my order with and told her next time not to write the word white in the order, white means plan. The waitress then comes over to the table and says, \"the lady just started working a few days ago so she made the mistake. We have to make your another one.\"  In the meantime, no other carts came by but the 4 carts that had nothing that sparked my interest. Asked for egg custard tarts, nothing. Not a single one to be found. As time pasted, I got more and more frustrated as I watched the lady bring out cilantro green onion rice rolls to all the other tables that were seated AFTER us!  The table next to us had 5 orders of egg tarts delivered to their table.  So I decided to place one order and ask for the check...we were fed up at this point. \n\nThe waitress took the check to tally up and added the order of egg custard to the bill.  She came back and said 15 minutes wait for the egg tarts.  So damn frustrated I said NO!  I can't wait anymore, I have to leave now (by now it's 90 minutes).  She walked away, went up to the cashier, came back n said ok 6 minutes ok because she already added the tarts on your bill.  I finally said fine and agreed.  15 minutes later...no tart in sight and the waitress kept dodging our table because she knew I was trying to get her attention.  Finally got her attention and she went to get them. I felt played for a fool.  \n\n$50 later and we were all still some what hungry. Because of this almost 2 hour lunch, I was almost late to work.  \n\nNEVER EVER EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!"

The rest ordered sodas or water, so in addition to a $6 tea bill, we also had a $6 soda bill.\n2. Their menu was not available because they were changing things, so when we ordered chicken fried rice off the menu, we had no idea how much it cost, and we were shocked to see our bill for $13.95 for a small plate of it.  \n3. There were no prices on the dim sum either. Not even dishes marked A, B, C, D and no price points on any paper indicating what dishes A, B, C, D might cost so we were ordering blind.  When we asked, the dim sum cart ladies did not speak any English.\n4. The dim sum cart ladies were scamming us by stamping our paper for more than they placed on our table.  I had to watch that stamping process very carefully and question everything (with hand gestures) and for some reason, we ended up being charged for 5 A dishes, 9 B dishes, and 4 C dishes, which is odd because the same items I order at other dim sum restaurants seem to be A dishes with an occasional B or C dish - again I felt scammed.\n5. The bill for 4 adults, two children for lunch was $89 plus tip.  Typically when we eat dim sum at other restaurants with our Chinese friends, we have 5 adults and two children and our bill averages only $50-60, which is why we love dim sum so much.  There is usually so much value for the price.\n6. Some of the food was good, but some of the hot food was cold.  Not impressed with anything.\n\nWe will never eat at KJ Dim Sum again.  There are just too many other great and trustworthy dim sum restaurants to eat at and those restaurants offer English menus with prices in plain sight so customers know how much they are paying and are not shocked by the bill."

The dim is a little pricey but that's expected being that it's inside a casino.\n\nSo tonight we decided to stop by for dinner.  We weren't too hungry so we just ordered crab meat with fish maw soup and their \"Imperial Peking Duck\".\n\nSoup: it was ok. Nothing special compared to other soups at restaurants in LA. $20 a bowl.\n\nDuck: This was a total rip-off and I'll tell you why. The dish alone is $42 bucks !  That's about $10-$15 dollars over other restaurants in the area.  But we accepted the price since we knew Peking duck comes 2 ways and that would sort of make up for the price.  The usual crispy skin with bao buns and then minced duck with lettuce wraps is usually how the dish is served.\n\nSo they bring out the duck and it is the \"complete\" duck, meat and skin and all.  So we asked about the minced meat part with lettuce wraps.  They informed us that it would be extra charge.  $15 dollars extra to be exact.\n\nThe waiter kept telling us that they don't do it like LA restaurants. I don't know what he's talking about since restaurants in the area do duck 2 ways when you order Peking duck. I don't care where your at. When you order Peking duck, it is always served 2 ways and not charged EXTRA. The price on the menu is the price you pay!\n\nAnyway.  We settled with what we had and asked about ordering more bao for our duck. We only wanted a couple more. The waiter first told us that you have to order by 3 or 6.  Then he comes back after checking with manager that minimum order is 6. The baos' are $.75 per !  \n\nAt this point we were totally dumbfounded and furiously frustrated by how badly we just got ripped off and how this restaurant tries to nickel and dime you with their outrageous extra charges.  \n\nThe waiter, sensing our great disappointment, offers us free dessert. It was taro with tapioca and was good, but not enough to dissuade me from writing this poor but deserving review.\n\nThe food was good and they did try to give us some sort of comfort with the free dessert.  For that, I give them 2 stars."

            "review": "My husband and I went here on Sunday morning for dim sum and was extremely disappointed. Here's why: (1) Their system for seating customers. When we got there at 11 am, it wasn't too busy. There were three parties ahead of us to be seated. They gave us a number. One of the members in the party after us must speak the language because he was right next to the hostess and kept asking her about when they would be seated. The next thing I know, our number was skipped and they got seated. We thought maybe it's because they have a bigger group and it was a bigger that table came available. Then she started seating other people that came after us. My husband told her that she skipped our number and then she seated us. (2) Little variety. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant with a large aisle. The whole time we were there, the same two carts came through. I asked one of the ladies if they had chicken feet. Instead of saying that she can have the person come over, she said \"later\". Later never came. (3) Service is poor. It was hard to flag down a waiter for refills or for questions. Once they seat you, the waiter does not come back to check on you. When we were done with being disappointed in the food and service and ready to leave, we could not get the attention of a waiter to check us out. My husband gave up and took our check to the register himself to pay it. This is one of the rare time that we did not leave a tip.\n\nOn the way out, the line was out the door. In my mind, after what I just experienced, it is NOT worth the wait."

Many of those reviews seemed to be based more on the staff than on the food, quality, or quantity.   My wife and I were greeted and seated within 30 seconds of arriving.  Tea was offered and brought to our table in under one minute.  We did have to request water, but refills were automatic and timely.  Multiple carts were always in motion and accessible.  The english of the wait staff was a bit difficult to understand, but it added to the ambience (and was much better than my Mandarin or Cantonese). Staff smiled, made recommendations and remained friendly throughout the meal.  Prices were based on food portions, small medium or large, ranged from $2-5.  Overall, very reasonable.  Favorites were any of the dumplings, shrimp, pork or chicken and the pork stuffed sticky buns followed by the sweet tofu dessert.  We left, completely stuffed like good Americans, for a total bill of $42.  Highly recommended."

As we all know, gambling drains the hell out of everyone and definite stimulates our appetite.  I am a frequent stayer at the Rio and fortunately for myself, dining at KJ has to be one of the most nostalgic experiences I've had.\n\nLet's get one thing straight:  This is not an average Chinese restaurant.  The place is pretty decent in terms of size and has the patience to deal with people that don't really have that patience.  I seriously admire the service staff for putting up with people don't have patience.  They are quick, friendly, and extremely hospitable and that goes without saying that this is the most important aspect of a restaurant.\n\nFood is awesome.  How awesome you say?  Well besides the traditional types of dimsum, you also have to count this restaurant for dinner.  I've had some pretty interesting experiences as well as some nostalgic ones.  You have classic stir fried dishes like Kung pao, as well as individual dishes like crispy chow mein with gravy.  Though that is more of the American side of Chinese cooking, there are some delight-able treats that they have here for an authentic Chinese palate.  I hate to say if anything is truly better than anything else, but they have the best steamed chinese fish that I've ever had and let me remind you that I am a VERY picky eater.  Be warned though, the price is expensive (40 USD for a pound).\n\nAlthough I won't eat Chinese food everyday but I can appreciate it as it has always been something I've grown into.  If you're around, you just have to stop by and try it for yourself.  I'll be back when I return to my gambling habits once again!"

The restaurant is located inside of a off-strip hotel (RIO) so it's reasonable to expect that a lot of patrons who dine here are guests of the hotel and a mix of locals. I am the latter and neither myself or my dining guest were of Chinese nationality.\n\nWe were sat in the middle of the restaurant during a moderately busy Sunday early afternoon and were quickly approached by the food carts (we had no qualms with the delivery of food, with the exception that some dishes were served cold when they should have been hot). \n\nA waiter then approached us once and asked for a drink order. Other than that, there were no efforts made to check on the table. We tried several times to flag down a waiter to get some basics (chili sauce, soy sauce, napkins, etc.) and were met with quick turns of the head as if they \"didn't see us.\" After several minutes of being what we felt were purposely ignored, we noticed these same waiters were very attentive and visited several times the tables seated with all Chinese or mostly Chinese guests. Finally I was able to get the attention of a gentleman I assumed to be the restaurant manager who asked if we needed something. After requesting my simple condiments I received an eye roll from the gentleman and then an \"ok.\" After observing him going back and fourth to other tables after waiting 10 minutes for the delivery of two simple items, we noticed he went back to the main reception desk and stood there, not making an attempt to deliver the items to us. We then had to literally almost grab a hold of another waiter before they acknowledge our presence and again requested our simple condiments, that were then promptly delivered. The (assumed) manager then walked to a table of women sitting next to ours and proceeded to have a full on conversation, even going so far as to sit down at their table and socialize. I did notice on two occasions that he did glance our way and give a rude, irritated look our way as they proceeded to talk. At this point both my partner and myself were fed up with the incredibly rude, purposeful lack of service at our table and asked for the check, which they were quick to get us and wisk away as soon as we put out cash in. When the server looked in the pocket and noticed that I had given 3 $20 bills on a $58.35 check, she asked if we were ready to pay and I nodded yes, she then stood there for a few seconds with a look that almost said, are you kidding with this? no tip? which was purposeful on our account. \n\nThis may sound like a rant, and it is, but I want to make it perfectly clear that we were treated with indifference and rudely the entire experience, for what seemed no other reason than that we were not Chinese. \n\nFor a restaurant located inside of a hotel to provide this sort of service to it's guests and guests of the hotel is unheard of. This experience reflects poorly not only on the restaurant but the hotel itself. \n\nSo my suggestion, if you are not Chinese, then don't dine here because they obviously and clearly do not want your business. Next time, I'll go to a establishment on Spring Mountain."

Maybe they have better food on the weekends,  u tell me. And they had maybe 5 carts of different things going around,  3 being tofu & congee & chinese broccoli. We got 6 dishes off of the first cart. Thinking theres gonna be more,  there wasnt. What we got was pretty much their staple. And the restaurants was 1/2-3/4 full,  but only have one cart of each going around is a bit slow to me.. But whatever idc. Just disappointed in the fact that there wasnt as much options. I can get alot more dishes at other dimsum spot ive tried in the midwest. And i had to ask for certain dishes because it wasn't on the cart (even tho i saw them bring it to other requesters). \nMy favorite thing there is probably the egg tarts. So much flavor abd u can taste the custard in it,  alot of places dont hit that right spot for it.  Their dessert is probably what i would come back for if im really craving it. \nService is bad,  which i knew coming in, no expectations there.

The size of each dumpling was smaller than you usually get elsewhere.\n\nCrab & Shrimp Dumpling - This was one of my favorites from what we ordered.\n\nMediocre / Nothing to Write Home About: Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, Steamed BBQ Pork Buns, Chinese Broccoli, Shrimp in Rice Noodle (the rice noodle portion was a bit on the thick side and the shrimp was a little sparse)\n\nPass: Fried Calamari - this tasted like it had been deep fried yesterday and nuked in the microwave. Not fresh at all. Veggie Dumplings - These actually have shrimp in there, but the veggies and shrimp didn't taste very fresh.\n\nThe one saving grace was that it was inexpensive - our bill pre-tip was $65 for 7 people, but you also get what you pay for.

I am happy I got to go again for dim sum with a Chinese speaking friend.  There's no language barrier and they often know what to order or what to avoid.  Such was the case Saturday with Li Ly, our friend who is moving back to San Francisco and the reason 7 of us got together for brunch.\n\nWe had shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, sesame balls, sweet buns, and some good shrimp balls.  I don't know the Chinese names for any of these, but they were generally good.  \n\nWe had fairly good service although Li Ly had to dig her heels in and get the service we needed.\n\nI like the room.  It's well appointed and the decor is bright and roomy."

Wonderful selection, wonderful textures and flavors.  My only issue is that most of the women with the carts speak only halting english.  As an adventurous dinner, this is heaven since I often won't have a clue what is being placed on my plate.  what will be inside my dumpling?  Pork?  Shrimp?

When I went to KJ for the second time in about a week with a friend, my husband made me get three orders of the mouth watering treat to go. He said don't bother coming home without it. True story.\n\nKJ Dim Sum is located in Rio, across from the Carnival World Buffet. Tip: Prime parking is if you turn on Valley View, there is a parking lot and garage that is MUCH closer than if you enter through the main entrance.\n\nThe restaurant is large and can accommodate large groups. Just be prepared for a wait if you go during prime hours. The wait staff is good. They kept checking that our tea pot was full every few minutes.\n\nThey have a great selection of dim sum, a lot of the usual that I get in other dim sum places in town. Surprisingly, the prices are very good for being in a casino. I wish I knew the names of the items I love... I just point to whatever looks good! I love this fried seafood ball that comes with a mayo dipping sauce. Their shu mai is also very tasty. But like Tony T. said twice, and I will also mention two more times, the Baked Salty Egg Yolk Cream Bun will win you over!"

It is located right across from the Rio's Carnival Buffet, so if you paid too much attention to the line of people waiting for the buffet, you might have to bust a U-ey like I did earlier today.\n\nThe dim sum selection is pretty vast.  They have all the usual popular dim sum items and some rare gems (highly recommend #32 Baked Salty Egg Yolk Cream Bun is a nice dessert to finish off your meal, but we also used it as our intermission break).\n\nThe food were hot every time we ordered it off the dim sum cart and the servers were friendly and timely in refilling tea pots, getting us extra hot sauces and napkins, and clearing away empty plates.\n\nOverall, the food was good. Perhaps not as great as the top dim sum destinations up and down California. However, their Baked Salty Egg Yolk Cream Bun (it is so good I am mentioning it twice) with their golden liquidy center is reason enough for me to designate KJ Dim Sum & Seafood as my reigning Las Vegas dim sum spot.  \n\n(Review was based on dim sum experience only, but they do have a regular Chinese restaurant menu offering as well).\n\nAmbiance:  4/5  Airy, dining environment with pleasing decor.  \n\nFood:  4/5  Overall good. \n\nValue:  4/5  Competitively priced.\n\nService:  4/5  No complaints.\n\nParking:  4/5  Parking garage, valet at the Rio.

I find that other places lack certain things like the fried taro, fried shrimp balls, sticky rice, and the steamed tofu wrap filled with chicken. Prepare yourself for an MSG-induced food coma because this meal will knock you out no matter how much tea you knock back.\n\nOf course, given that they're located inside a casino, their prices are higher than a typical dim sum. Their spacious dining area is clean and decorated well, yet still has the atmosphere and buzz of a traditional Chinese restaurant. With all the waiters and pushcart ladies quickly making their rounds, their service runs as smooth as the wheels on the metal carts. Be sure to park on the west side of the Rio so the waddle back to the car is shorter!\n\nThough it's a tad more expensive than usual, the scrumptious food and tip-top service solidify its claim on the best dim sum in Vegas in my book. Now if you'll excuse me, it's time for me and my happily full stomach to rest and digest."

Brightly lit, clean interior with great service too.  In my opinion the dim sum here rivals those of Seattle and San Francisco Chinatowns.  Even the tea (goke fah or chrysanthemum) was fragrant  and high quality.  Our total bill before tip came to about 70 for seven people, and we ordered lots.\n\nSome standout items included curry fish balls, sticky chicken rice, beef balls, Siu Mai, black bean spareribs, and fried bean curd filled with shrimp.  All of these items had just enough salt and weren't too oil - in fact all still had good texture.\n\nA minor miss is the beef chow fun.  Beef was seasoned well and there was plenty of \"wok breath\", but the chefs here sliced up the rice noodles.  Most of our group were used to llonger wide noodles, and I tend to agree - it would make the dish better.  Imagine eating pasta with spaghetti sliced up and you'll notice the difference!\n\nStill, extremely good quality to price ratio and authentic dim sum.  Service was great and the food does come out fast!"

The Mongolian beef was kind of slimey almost as if it came out of a can. The sweet n sour pork was decent but the noodles were greasy. Even though the service was great... Food was not.

If you go early you'll probably get slammed with people or get lucky and find seats super quick. Aside from their super oriental interior design the service is superb. Being Asian American has its perks, I can order in Chinese and sometimes point of course. \n\nThe dim sum ladies are everywhere. If you find a cart pushing towards you better order as much as you can because everything looks super delicious. It's delicious, only reason I always come back to the rio. \n\nMy favorite couple dishes are the marinated ribs and the meatballs. You can also order the proteins, but the desserts 10/10. Taro bun and the red bean puddings are my two go to desserts. \n\nService, food and the atmosphere really adds to the overall dining experience.

However, being in the Rio Casino, I would think that KJ would make more of an effort to elevate their level of service.  At the least, I would think that the Rio would demand a minimum level of service standards to uphold their rating as a top level hotel.  \n\nKJ fails in the level of service, but there aren't many dimsum restaurants in town to compete with so they probably get away with it.  It's disappointing but hopefully somebody else decides to open up a dimsum spot that provides the same level of food but focuses on a higher caliber of service than that found at KJ."

Admittedly a 'standardized' menu featuring solid renditions of the classics but little innovation it would be easy for me to dock points for issues such as tepid duck or small, slightly overcooked shrimp but taking into account the nature of cart service compared to the menu style common to the elite of the SGV or BC nearly every dish we selected was nicely prepared and ample in portion, the total bill for 11 selections ringing in at $45 before tax and tip.  Speaking to specific must orders, particular favorites particularly well done would include both the baked salty egg yolk buns and the even more impressive steamed version of the same, but most of all the golf-ball sized crispy shrimp balls served along semi-sweet Chinese mayo sauce - the rich, supple interior so good a second order for 'dessert' proved mandatory."

In the end, we ended up at the place 3 times during our 5 day visit and we weren't even staying at the Rio hotel !\nFirst visit was actual Dim Sum.  Compared to Toronto, the prices are very reasonable/similar.  Selection at times can be tricky since it all depends on what cart comes by your table.  Within 5 mins of being seated at our table, we had tea & food on the table and we were munching away. Flavor and presentation were good and what you would expect.  We were especially impressed with the BBQ roast duck (skin was really crispy !)  In total our bill for 4 people including tea & tip was around $55.\nWe also went two nights for dinner.  We ordered off the regular and Chinese menus. (You might need to ask for the Chinese menu).  The size of the dishes was good and very tasty.  The selection was also quite impressive and we managed to order dishes which suited all tastes.  Along with our dishes, we received complimentary soup of the day, rice and dessert.

We asked our waiter, once he finally arrived, to recommend something and went with his suggestiins. The lobster egg rolls were pretty good. Watch out because the center stays hot for a long time. The rest of our meal was quite ordinary,  not bad, just nothing special. I will pay good money for a good meal and this was either over priced or under flavored. All in all, it was ok."

It was chinese food, dim sum. Because this restaurant is located in Rio hotel, so there are plenty of parking space, and What I saw was when it was time of lunch, There are  a lot of people wait in line. It was a large dining room, and a lot of table, dim sum was different from other cuisine, dim sum was reheat and stored on a cart, waiter will show me what is on cart, and introduce each dishes, different dim sum have different price, also when I sit down, waiter will ask you what kind of tea you like. \nEgg custard bun appearance is bright yellow pebbled bread, taste of egg custard bun  was  long lasted sweet, and inside of bun was watery mixture of egg yolk, flour. And the texture of bun was crispy and sticky outside, watery and smooth in the inside. It's low middle note, after taste was a little bit sour. Another dish I have tried was steamed chicken feet, appearance was oily bright brown, taste was mild sweet and salty, texture was gummy and sticky. I also tried lotus leaf rice, appearance was lotus leaf rolled sticky rice and chinese sausage, and salty duck egg yolk, mushroom, so the color was colorful, taste was sweet for rice and sausage , salty for duck egg yolk, mushroom was sweet and umami, texture was sticky. Steamed shrimp dumpling was kind of pink color, it was semitransparent outside, and taste was umami and sweet of shrimp, texture was gummy dumpling skin, tender for shrimp, it's well balanced.\nOverall, it was great experience dining in KJ dim sum & seafood."

            "review": "Forget what you've heard, this is the best dim sum restaurant in Las Vegas! We enjoyed every single item that we grabbed off of the carts and have no complaints. KJ Dim Sum is my absolute favorite place in Vegas to get dim sum.\n\nI consider myself to be picky when it comes to dim sum, we just moved here from California and we were spoiled with many heavy hitter dim sum restaurants close to home. Since we've moved here, we've tried almost all of the popular dim sum restaurants in Vegas: Orchid Garden (2/5), Chang's (3/5), Cathay House (3/5) and also Ping Pang Pong (3/5). Yet, I would still easily recommend KJ dim sum as sum' of the best dim sum in Vegas! \n\nIt's located inside of the Rio, right across the way from the Carnival World Buffet. We arrived around 1pm on a Saturday. They were bustling but we didn't have to wait, they were able to seat us right away. They were quick with rolling the carts by and were quick to grab us our drinks and tea. I was extremely pleased with the service here. \n\nNow let's get on to the best part, the food! \n\nShumai - they were very moist and had great flavor. A nicely done shumai for sure. 5/5\n\nHar gow - so much yum! They make them amazing here. Super delicate clear wrapper and steamed to perfection. The shrimp inside tasted amazing. I can eat 10 orders of these! 5/5\n\nFried taro puffs - these were little fried fluffs of taro. The taro filling tasted good and the exterior was fried well and flaky. 5/5\n\nBbq pork bun - the buns were small, glazed and sticky. The bbq pork filling inside was just enough but super flavorful and moist. We enjoyed them! 5/5\n\nBbq pork bao - (the one that looks like white clouds) it was piping hot and steamy, very fluffy, and the filling was moist. The bbq pork flavor is great! We devoured these little morsels and also saved some to eat later as well. They were still amazing after siting in the container and at room temperature. 5/5\n\nShrimp noodle rolls - these were perfect! I enjoyed the soft, moist and tender noodles. The shrimps inside were flavorful as well. 5/5\n\nEgg custard tart - I was completely taken back by how they stayed warm at our table the entire time! It was extra custardy, super crazy moist, velvety buttery, and very flaky. I was in heaven! Omg. It's the best egg custard tart we have ever had! I grew up eating these babies in California, but man these win them all. 5/5 \n\nTotal damage with a coke was $25! That's a good price for 2 hungry adults. We love this place!"

Their dim sum rivaled some of the places in LA and definitely beats any of the places in Las Vegas Chinatown. I haven't tried the KJ in Chinatown for dim sum but their dinner is pretty decent.  \n\nThe place is clean and the waiters are respectful. I like that even though they are in a casino, they kept the traditional food carts on the floor. That's what makes dim sum, dim sum. Food comes around pretty often and they have a good selection. \n\nYou know this place is good when Chinese people are eating here and they went out of their way to come to a casino to eat."

Fortunately, the shumai was DELICIOUS. the second i bit in, my mouth automatically went MMMMMMMMMM. it was uncontrollable. \n\nthen our gf's pan fried noodles FINALLY come out.........guess what comes out? TWO beef pan fried noodles!!!!!!!\n\nmy gf pointed it out that she ordered the seafood noodle........and it was hte most awkward exchange ever. the waiter pauses \"OH No my mistake.......\" pauses and looks at her.......and did not immediately even offer to take it back........and my gf is just like it's fine don't worry about it (she obviously didn't want to wait while we were almost done with our food) and he has a sigh of relief an djust leaves it.\n\nNO one comped her meal and he didn't even offer to take it back and just looked at her to see if she would just accept it!

They would explain what each plate had and what was in each dish. \n\nI liked the shrimp (don't know how else to say this, so excuse me) balls. They were cooked well and very tasty. There were things that looked like wontons with chicken and spinach in them, that were very good. The tea was okay, but the servers were definitely on their job; constantly checking on my drinks, but not in an annoying way. Tried this rice that was in a giant leaf thing, didn't care for the flavor. Had this dessert that was made with sweetened egg, and it was delicious! I also liked that the portions were small, so you could try multiple things. \n\nMy friend said that there was some pressure from the women with the carts, so I'm not sure if they work on commission, or maybe they need to empty their carts in a certain amount of time, or what. If he were not a confident man, I'm sure this would have made for an uncomfortable vibe, but him and I laughed it off. Will definitely be coming here again."

There are also favorites that are suitable for others that are not too familiar with Chinese food. I recommend the Beef Chow Fun and Won Ton Noodle soup.  They even accommodated my dining partner who was allergic to some ingredients, when requested to not add any sauce to a shrimp dish and to simply steam it they complied.  \n\nThe only reason why this place is not getting a 5 star is because of the price of their dishes.

            "review": "Although the term \"dim sum\" is in the name, don't assume they serve it all day or that you can order it in the early afternoon. They run out of dim sum almost every day. The sooner they run out, the sooner they can charge for full meal orders. There are better dim sum houses in the Bay Area and LA. It can be extremely busy. On all 3 of my visits, most of the patrons were asian, speaking several dialects of Chinese. That was taken as a good sign, as dim sum is of Chinese origin. \n\nFood\nAlthough the menu is pretty big, the food is average to pretty good. The entr\u00e9e  recommendations are roasted duck (1/2 serves 2 people), #4 fried beef rice noodles, and saut\u00e9ed beef with orange, extra crispy. I haven't tried the soup but it didn't look great. Dim sum highlights are short ribs, BBQ pork buns, crispy shrimp balls, and egg tarts. I can't really recommend anything else. The rest is ok. \n\nService\nWhen busy, the chaos sends the staff into panic mode and anything can happen. The manager, an older Asian man speaking Cantonese and Mandarin, in a dress shirt and Lacoste sweater vest was rude to people in at least 3 languages. Our server was a nice woman from Hong Kong. Many of the bus staff seemed slow to help and quick to argue with other staff. \n\nIt's a fun place to watch people, staff and customers when it is busy. There's always some little drama. For the best value, go early for dim sum. Be prepared to wait. Try only recommended dishes. Call ahead and ask about dim sum availability, wait time, and hours. They all seem to change with seasons and holidays."

If you have a special request or item you are looking for, just ask and the servers spring into action to find it for you. Our drinks never went empty and the quality dim sum for the price was shocking! I pay double for dim sum in San Francisco. Couple of tips., you can gain entrance to KJ by the parking lot of the RIO and avoid walking through the casino. It is open 24 hours on Saturday nights so you can always get your fix. And they do take out orders!!! If you want a quick bite late at night, swing by grab some yummy steamed delights and head on out. I would definitely recommend it and will be back for more pork buns!

We came in just as they opened at 10AM. The service, as with most Chinese restaurants, was fast and clipped without much friendliness.\n\nDue to the earliness, there weren't a ton of carts out yet. We ordered our usuals of dumplings and shumais along with chicken feet, tripe, and pork buns. There were no vegetables out yet, which was a bummer as we were looking forward to some Chinese broccoli. \n\nOverall, the food was not as I would've expected. Dim Sum back in Virginia was definitely better than the dim sum here. I think I would only go back for cravings but otherwise it's not something that needs to be checked off on your travels through the hotels."

Piping hot and fresh, good flavors, they had my favorites but u do have to order the steamed egg yolk buns which are yellow colored on the outside too unlike the Lai Wong baos. Really good lo Mai gais sticky rice in lotus leaf too bc they actually have the salted duck egg unlike a lot of other cheaper dim sum places. All the customers were Chinese mostly speaking Cantonese too so we know where it's at. My favorite steamed bean curd roll was so hot it nearly burned my tongue as u bite into it with good light perfect sauce. Mmmmmm. They didn't have the taro Mochi or the goji berry jello though nor the matcha baked buns so darn. Taro buns were just ok for me, I guess I prefer them in Mochi or savory dishes. With a lot of really solid dishes here, I may have to come back to eat the e-fu noodles or even something different like shanghai chow mein. I was too full to order the Jia Leung Chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle with hoisin and regular sauce since I had to order another of the egg yolk buns bc they were so good and I ate 4 out of 6 between my husband and I...pig.... Very happy with the food and will come back again hopefully with more people so I can order and try more dishes!!"

I had roast duck and expected quite more for a casino restaurant.  My duck was soaked with water and wasn't cooked thorough enough for the meat to fall off the bone.  Sorry, but duck isn't that hard to cook.\n\nMy second opinion is that of the staff.  They speak very broken English and it was very hard to communicate about what was on the menu.  I had to make an uninformed decision on what to order, because nobody could understand me.  I also felt rushed to order.\n\nMy iced tea tasted stale and was never offered refills.  I came here with another couple and we felt somewhat ignored.\n\nMy final complaint was that when the entrees did come, they came separate which is rude for guests who are trying to enjoy each other's company.

We were seated right away and got bombarded with carts (of course).\n\nHere's a breakdown of what we ended up with:\n-har gow\n-shu mai\n-rice noodles with shrimp\n-mushroom dumplings\n-char siu bao (steamed pork bun)\n-sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf\n-xiao long bao\n-scallop dumplings\n\nOf what we got here's what I would recommend, xiao long bao, har gow, and mushroom dumplings. The rest where okay and some were not that great. The notable bad dish was the rice noodles with shrimp, which was definitely off. For the noodle dish, usually the shrimp is especially sweet and the noodles are wrapped up but separate. These noodles seemed overcooked because half of the noodles seemed to have fused together.\n\nWe get darn good dim sum at home, so this was a little bit of a let down. I'm also tempted to take away another star for service because even though we were seated promptly and got our food quickly it took FOREVER to get our bill and after getting it for someone to take it. However, I am in a generous mood so I'll say that they get a 2.5 and round up to 3.\n\nKj Dim Sum will definitely satisfy a dim sum craving, but it's not that great. Not sure what else Vegas has to offer in terms of dim sum, but hopefully it's better than this.\n\nStar #1: Flavorful food. Some of them were good, some not so good.\nStar #2: Food causes cravings. No, not these ones.\nStar #3: Price worthiness. Yes, decently priced dim sum.\nStar #4: Decent service. It's okay.\nStar #5: X factor (ie amazing service, ambiance, creativity, etc). Not really."

So it was hard to ask any questions, unless the hostess happen to come by. So with that said, communication can be difficult, if you want something in particular. \n\nThe Hum Bow's were not the normal BBQ ones, they had a different taste, my friend and I didn't really like them. I like the bread Hum Bow's, but did not see any when we were there, I asked for them, but never got an answer. \n\nCongee was really good, like most places we get. The shrimp noodle rolls were really soggy, this wasn't that good. The siu mai was good, nothing different that I could tell. The Har Gow, shrimp balls were good as most places. The seafood bundle pack, the soggy wrap items were very good, one of my favorites.\n\nWe had a custard or egg dessert where the yoke was suppose to be runny, but it was hard and over cooked. The tripe was very good, there was another tripe we got in brown sauce, it was average.\n\nI really need to do pictures, but I think every gets the drift. The place seems a little pricey, but I wouldn't know, as my friend picked up the bill.\n\nOverall, the place was good, I will definitely go back to try other entree's, but the lack of communication makes it difficult to ask for what you want at times."

I visited KJ Dim Sum & Seafood the day after I visited  Ping Pang Pong. I arrived at both restaurants late for typical dim sum. I also showed up at both locations with 2 different sets of people who'd never had dim sum before. The difference in the experiences was night and day and difficult not to compare. It didn't help that both restaurants are across the street from one another Ping Pong Pang is in the Gold Coast which reeks of old smoke, cheap liquor and the sweat of desperation. The other is in the Rio which may be as old as the Gold Coast but it's kept itself in better shape so you aren't turned off by your experience and your nostrils aren't assaulted with funk before you even get to the restaurant. KJ  Dim Sum is also close to the exit of the casino.\n\nWe were seated fast and maybe because we were late and they were empty the trays came often and fast. What didn't they have? By the time my cousins came back from the restroom our table was pretty much covered with dim sum and my mouth was full. By the way you should know that the restrooms are a bit of a trek from the dining room so govern yourselves accordingly.\n \nThe food was good so I'll be honest I didn't really want to stop and explain what everything they hadn't seen before was. Can I just tell you I'm tempted to give this place a 5 because they had duck. So few dim sum eateries have duck and their duck was delicious. The only drawback was that the duck was a little on the cold side and filled me up so much that I couldn't really do much but peck at the other dim sum dishes we ordered. What I had, I enjoyed and was prepared in a style I've become accustomed to over the years. My newbie cousins actually asked where dim sum had been all their lives. To which I explained that much of America has been deprived of quality authentic Chinese food which is a crying shame.\n\nWhile I found the prices at Ping Pang Pong to be a little bit higher than I'm accustomed to. I walked away from KJ Dim Sum feeling like I got a deal. I might just stay out at the Rio on my next visit to Vegas so I can eat there every day of my stay. I don't like having to travel miles for good Chinese food. Call me spoiled. If you have only have a chance to choose one of the two go with KJ Dim Sum. Looking forward to my next visit to Vegas to sample the other Dim Sum Spots."

After handing them my credit card, we have to sit there more than 20 mins waiting to get back my credit card. I don't know what the hell they were doing with my credit card.\n\n3 days after that (which is today), I saw KJ Dim Sum charged me twice. WTF? I had to spend 30 mins calling my credit card customer service to dispute this transaction. And it will take time to resolve this. \n\nWILL NEVER GO TO KJ DIM SUM AGAIN."

It also comes with Chinese Donuts on top. Pretty good.\n\nEgg Tart: They didn't have this on the cart but I asked for it and she got it out from the kitchen so it was fresh. It was good but not the best I've had.\n\nSiu Mai: This was alright. Nothing special about it.\n\nHar Gow: This was alright too.\n\nSpare Ribs: They cut the spare ribs really thin and it was really tender.

The filling inside it was good and the sauce was thick and not watery. \n\nService was eh. They took a long time to give us our tea and for the carts to come to our table.

I went here just to check it out and get some different scenery.  If you like the one on spring mtn this will not disappoint.  It is not as crowded as the other one and has the same great food.  The only downfall is that it is priced slightly higher since it is in a casino, but locals get 20% off the bill, so I guess you almost break even (what more can you ask for, but to break even in a casino).  This KJ's does however have dim sum...please try the taro bun pastry...soooo good!  Same great food & alot of the staff from the one off the strip.  Enjoy!"

We turn around and lo and behold there was KJ Dim Sum & Seafood restaurant with several tables available.  We were seated quickly and the servers gave us plenty of attention.  We ordered and the food came quickly.  We were surprised that the dishes were relatively inexpensive.\n\nWe had a little time to look around and enjoy the atmosphere.  The restaurant is decorated in bright and cheery reds - red carpet with what appears to be butterflies fluttering about the floor.  The carpet contrasts with the shiny black chairs and the white walls which are covered with large black frames filled with brightly colored pictures and 4 flatscreen televisions.  It's not quite enough to convince you that you're in a sports bar, but they get the job done.\n\nThere were four occupied tables near us. At three of the tables the occupants were  speaking Chinese and eating Chinese style (eating rice out of the bowl, and other items off their plates).  I always have more faith in the quality of the food at an ethnic restaurant when at least some of the other customers belong to the ethnic group.  DJ Dim Sum definitely makes the grade in this respect.\n\nFirst they brought the potstickers, hot and tasty - perfectly done, then the egg flower soup.  The coconut shrimp was pretty tasty and in no time we were on our way, tummies full and taste buds satisfied.\n\nI'd definitely come back!!"

After skipping many chances to eat here last summer (for free), because of the one bad prior experience here, decided to give it another chance this year for a late night feast with a buddy. The food passed my taste test that early morning and I came back for two dim sum meals in the next four days before leaving town. Didn't hurt that only had to pay a little cash for tip each time. \n\nMy buddy wanted a glass of wine, but the waiter said they only do bottles and promptly brought us over a bottle before we even necessarily agreed to it. Oh well. No complaints.\n\nI started off by getting an order of potstickers. So what? Asians can order that too. They were crispy and perfect at 1:30 in the morning. \n\nHK style seafood noodles were great and so were the honey walnut prawns. I mean I've had better versions of both, but these were pretty solid for a Chinese place inside the Rio not that the standard is set anywhere respectable. \n\nToo many dim sum items to go through over the two binge outings, but two of the standouts came from their dessert cart. Big fan of their green tea buns and also their egg puffs were solid. Most of the savory items were delicious and fresh and piping hot both times.\n\nIf you come at the open, I'd suggest closer to the front (away from the entrance) so you get first crack at the carts. Some of the tables take forever and it's agonizing to wait those extra two or three minutes. Patience has its place in this world, but not at dim sum.\n\nBe greedy and get all the good stuff before you have to wait another round. It's worth it."

It's exactly the same as all the other dim sum places we've had in Orange County:\n\n- Hit or miss dishes (some dishes were overcooked so the skin on the dumplings were way too soggy)\n- No service for the meek.  Speak up (raise your hand) or you'll sit there without hot sauce, soy sauce or iced water the entire time\n- Semi-aggressive sales ladies trying to get rid of their wares\n\nNo one dish really stood out except maybe the stir fried rice noodles which didn't come with much except scallions and onions (no meat) and cost $6.95.

The guy looks at me like I'm an idiot and says Dim Sum is only mornings. \"We're authentic\" he says with an attitude normally reserved for the French.\n\nFair enough, I think. I've been to China, I know the drill. This is traditionally a morning thing, although they didn't give me grief when I was in Hong Kong asking for it for a later lunch, but whatever, we're going authentic here.\n\nIt would seem that the authenticity ends with the serving times, because the food was about as authentic as Panda Express. I'll say it falls more between PF Changs and Panda Express, but I don't think you'll find any Chinese willing to use the word authentic to describe any of those establishments either. \n\nTo be frank, the food kinda sucked. And the service was practically non-existent. The food came out quick, which is good, but keep in mind no one else was ordering. But then it got dropped off, no asking if everything's cool, and the guy then heads back to a table where the servers seem to be eating their dinner. \n\nIt's cool, I know everyone has to eat, but I don't think I'm being overly snobby to say that if our waiter is taking his dinner break, give us another waiter. After a 5 minute attempt to politely get his attention, I finally got up to retrieve a bottle of soy sauce myself. Not the end of the world, but not the type of service one would expect for a $60 dinner for two. \n\nGetting the check was a near similar hassle, but thankfully I was able to divert his attention away from the big TV long enough to drop that off. \n\nOh, and you know how when you get fortune cookies, not here, they're to \"authentic\" for such Tom Foolery, but at other low quality places? You know that thin strip of paper inside the cooke that was your fortune on it? That's about the amount of lobster in their \"lobster\" egg rolls. \n\nThe place blows. If you're in Vegas looking for a decent Chinese place, as a local I'd recommend Red 8 in the Wynn. It's not really any more expensive, it's much nicer, the servers are top notch, bordering on hovering, and the food is genuinely authentic, and fantastic. Tell them I sent you, and get a free blank stare of non-recognition. But seriously, that's the place for Chinese here in town."

I'll be the first to admit that the meatballs have been mixed with too much cornstarch. The cheung fun has way too much rice noodle compared to the meat filling. All the meat items kind of taste the same. Oh and the XLB come in little foil cups which = not good in my books - and the fact that they serve XLB in the first place but that's another story. The pinepple bun/runny egg yolk buns often leak too and they look exactly (suspiciously) the same as the ones that you get @ East Ocean.

Rather than small chunks of shrimp/pork... it was like they just threw pork and shrimp in and processed it together...\n\nThe chicken feet was not bad.  But it wasn't as soft as I like.  Maybe that's a preferential thing.  It felt like it wasn't that fresh.  Maybe that was the problem with the texture.\n\nSpare ribs with black beans.  Again, flavorless.  It was the typical meat:fat ratio you get at most cheap dim sum restaurants (read: cheap, high fat, low in meat).  But again, the meat itself was very bland.\n\nMy buddies had the rice noodle wrapped in shrimp, i opted to just try the rice noodle wrapped in bbq pork.  The rice noodles weren't bad, but the meat... lets just say I think the meat:fat ratio was again off (read: STOP FEEDING ME SO MUCH FAT!!!)  This was also very flavorless.\n\nWe got the bbq pork buns.  My buddies did not seem to enjoy that either... and they eat anything.\n\nTo sum it up:  I think this restaurant was catered towards non-Asians.  Food lacked bold Asian flavors typically savored and it was a huge disappointment.  I think the dim sum that they offer in the Rio World Buffet would've more satisfied my craving.  And no, I'm not exaggerating on that."

The ladies pushing carts were really nice and were patient with us since we were a bit indecisive on what we wanted.\n\nThe dim sum was ehh, not my cup of tea. Most things tasted alright, and nothing stood out. \n\nWe waited for forever for a waitress to take our bill and no one came. They totally ignored us probably because we were younger than the other customers. My friend had to walk up to the counter to get someone's attention to pay for our bill."

We had shared the day with a wedding as well so it was chaotic. I can't really tell you about the food that night because it was gone by the time I would sit down so I'm assuming it was delish. We started off with the jelly fish cold cuts platter and it went into assorted dishes such as steamed fish, roast pork, more seafood and veggies. Overall, I could tell everyone was happy and full. \n\nNow dim sum, I can tell you more about. I like that it's at the entrance of the Rio so you don't have to walk across the whole casino to get to it. The casino itself doesn't smell too smokey and did I mention that it opens at 10 am? We just went this past weekend and ordered our favorites. Sticky rice, turnip cake, pineapple bun with custard and with coconut, bbq pork buns, the two staples of dim sum (sew mai and hai gow) and tripe, etc. The dim sum is always delish and even though we spent a good $35 dollars it was well worth it. Service was good considering it just opened for the day and it was a Chinese restaurant. I like that it is clean and nicely decorated. \n\nOverall, KJ is my fav dim sum place and I definitely love it!"

First impression - I like that the restaurant feels inviting. One spacious, modern, open room, not a hole in the wall.\n\nTo my dismay, my feelings changed as soon as I tried some of the dishes. The food was disappointing. I regretted my craving choice. Most of the things we ordered were cold or just awful. The worst one was the beef spare ribs. So greasy, fatty, gummy, and boney. My shrimp wontons were cold. Chow fun were short pieces and dry, just the opposite of how I like them. Those ribs left a horrible taste in my mouth the whole day. The only thing that were decent were the shu mai and the shrimp flat rice noodle.\n\nOther saving graces were the decor, no wait, and the excellent service even though I'm not Chinese. The dim sum ladies were nice, explained what some of the items are, the server checked up on us, etc. \n\nOur bill was $38 for two before tip."

The food was pretty good, I've had better dim sum the food wasnt as hot as I would like, maybe it is due to the fact by the time it got around to us it was cold already.  The decor was nice and the servers we did encounter were very nice.  Main complaint they never brought us anything to drink.  We had to search out our waiter, we would ask the servers with the carts for water and they said our waiter would be around but that didn't happen.  We saw the waiters were cleaning off another table and we got their attention and asked again for water.  Needless to say those waters were not refilled either until we tracked someone down again.  We were never offered tea until we were already halfway though our meal.  The highlight was the coconut buns for me but they were not hot and I think we would have been better off going across the walkway to the buffet which when we were there had no line."

For travelers like me, the logistic was convenience from the Strip, and the hotel was less rundown than triple P one block west.  The interior beautifully decorated in a big dining area with different sizes of table in column formation.  They got about four different TV on the wall playing sports and Chinese dramas on mute.\n\nFor Dim Sum, they got the flavor right with carts flying all over the place, they do seems a bit lacking on the grill stuff, and they are using metal baskets instead of bamboo, which retains excessive water in the dim sum.  However, quality wise still decent for what they got in this town, definitely cannot compare with California level.\n\nThey open until 2am, but they do not seem to have any late night special after 9-10pm like most locations in town.  Regular dinner was ok, nothing exciting about it.  We got some Black Bean Beef Chow Fun and a Seafood Tofu Pot.  Both were very good compare to my home state, but just ok if you use Vegas standard.  The bill came to about $50.\n\nKJ Dim Sum at Rio was a solid Dim Sum place with some flaw for their dinner.  I would still come here again for Dim Sum brunch, and probably not dinner."

Black bean chow fun was very slimy and tasted like super market microwave instant food.   Salt and pepper fish was all batter with very little fish inside.
