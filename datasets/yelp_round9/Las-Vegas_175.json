Appetizers were pretty fabulous too.  I got the bone marrow flan.  My friends were all drooling while i ate it.  Careful, its very rich, so i suggest you don't eat it all by yourself.  Be prepared to max the card out on a dinner for 4 though.  Is anything cheap in Vegas?  Nope!"

            "review": "Delicious restaurant, Expensive, but a must go if you love great steak!  We started with maple glazed pork belly which was good but a little saltier than the pork belly I've had in the past I wouldn't recommend it.  However, the entrees, sides and drinks were delicious. My husband had the Japanese Wagyu Ribeye which was top notch and I had the petite filet mignon which was great. I ordered a side of sauce which was completely unnecessary so save you couple of dollars.  I will say though if you like bone marrow that is a must add to your steak.  The spinach with quail egg and the polenta were both notable.  My drink was called show me love and it was refreshing. CUT will put a dent in your wallet but well worth it for a special occasion."

            "review": "When I first went to Cut awhile back I LOVED it, so I was so excited to return. My BF and I went w/o a resi and sat at the bar. The food was as delicious as I remembered but it took FOREVER. Over 45mins for our salad apps (no cooking required). Our drinks came pretty quickly so I don't think it was the servers/bartenders unless they forget to put in our orders... Then it took another 45mins to get our steaks - by the time they arrived we weren't so hungry any more. It was a really bummer, and the worst thing was the complete lack of apology or even acknowledgement of the delay. We were asked by a manager how everything was and I said that it was tasty but the wait had been much too long and he made a cursory apology. It was really frustrating. A $400 dinner for two needs to be a better experience - a lot better. Such a bummer :("

            "review": "We arrived 15 minutes before the kitchen closed (which probably wasn't real popular with the staff). Even with our late arrival, we received fantastic service. The bread and butter (can't remember what kind) was great to start. We also had a number of sides, but the fact that I can't remember what they were, might say something.\n\nItems ordered: \n\n-Shrimp Cocktail (deconstructed) - This was as fantastic to eat as it was visually appealing.\n\n-American Wagyu Rib Eye Steak 10 Oz (med rare) - Very good, but a little too charred on the outside\n\n-Lobster - Perfectly cooked, melts in your mouth\n\nOverall, the food was very good and the service was exceptional. In fairness, I am writing this review after my completed trip. This meal was consumed on the first night and probably was knocked down a star because of the incredible meal I had at Strip Steak (Mandalay Bay) later in the week."

            "review": "Disappointing. The steaks were ruined by over-seasoning. Everything--the side dishes, steaks, appetizers--was way, way too salty. It was like someone in the kitchen accidentally dropped an entire container of salt on the brussel sprouts in particular; they were so salty, we didn't eat them. \n\nTwo of our steaks were cooked incorrectly, which is quite frankly unacceptable when steaks are $50+.  The Kobe beef was very tender, but again, ruined by excessive salt and seasoning. \n\nI can't recommend CUT. My friends and I spent hundreds of dollars on an underwhelming meal that just simply wasn't worth it."

We feel we know good restaurants and steak houses.\n\nTried Cut on a a whim after looking at different steak house reviews for Las Vegas.  With a ton of steak places we decided to go to a place that received decent reviews and was within walking distance of our hotel.\n\nI got the petite filet, wife got the American Wagyu Filet.  As we said, wife said it was best steak she ever had.  Though her 6oz steak was $85, she said worth every penny.\n\nMy steak was awesome, cooked just like I like it.  Service was great and attentive, but not over bearing.  \n\nThe place is pricey but if you can treat yourself to one good meal in Vegas, try Cut."

I got lots of attention from my host and even had the honor of sampling wonderful Japanese whiskey as well as the meat selection. Really made my trip unforgettable. The meat is flavorful and high grade. If you are unfamiliar with how it should be, the sever are fully knowledgeable and educated in everything they serve there. Truly impressive and a must revisit place."

Granted, given the price, it's not something many people could have on a regular basis. But if you're looking for a fancy night out, a special dinner, this has to be on your list of considerations. \nThe wagyu sashimi is a starter you HAVE to try. Super tender, not overly seasoned, it's more filling than it looks. \nThe crab cakes are also super fresh and delicious. \nI was recommended the Taste of New York, which is a sample of their different steaks. Although they're all really good, I would recommend skipping it and just going for the 100% Japanese Wagyu Rib Eye. Definitely take advantage of the additional ounce option for a better deal. The texture of the meat is unlike anything you've ever tried, guaranteed. The add ons I'm actually not too fond of, but to each their own."

            "review": "I hadn't eaten here before but it reminded me of Teemu Selannes near my house. The only thing I would change is making the menu more family style. Here the menu is presented in a way where you feel like you need your own steak and a side or a starter. When it's best to share a larger cut and try a few sides. They had very unique and flavorful bread choices. I had steak three times this week and this was the only place that didn't over cook my steak. It had a nice flavorful seared crust and a large amount of thick buttery red meat throughout the center. A member of the staff brought mustards to try with the steak (apparently this is an Austrian thing) I never ruin meat with sauces. I did try it though and for some reason you can taste both the meat and the mustard independently in your mouth. Still not for me but very interesting. They have very lovely delicate desserts. It's a wonderful treat and I will be coming back. If you're going to stay in a five star hotel you want a five star meal to go with it. This is the place to go."

I thought maybe they sat the wrong people or something.  Perhaps they thought we were VIP members of a royal family????  Nope!  Let's start from the beginning...\n- made my reservation on OpenTable and i typed in a small note that this was our 15 yr anniversary and just hoped for a nice table which to us meant maybe not too close to the kitchen where it might be loud....  I didn't think much of it.\n- arrived to find they had set up a beautiful, quiet and large romantic booth just for the 2 of us. ELEGANT IN EVERY WAY!\n- looked at the menu and saw that it had been personalized and printed especially for us and under our name which was just so sweet\n- lovely and attentive staff checked on us regularly and made sure glasses were filled and our needs were met at all times\n- I had the filet mignon and my wife the NY ribeye (I think)... these quality steaks were BEYOND!!!! JUST BEYOND AMAZING!!!  \n- we were so full and satisfied at the end of the meal we decided to pass on the dessert... The Cut Staff would not accept that on our special night and brought out their favorite dessert COMPLIMENTS OF THE HOUSE, with the words \"Happy 15th Anniversary\" written in chocolate... WE LOVED IT!  \nDon't know what else to say other than....    Thank you, CUT!!!  You made our anniversary a night too remember!!!!"

This may be a pet peeve of mine but why label something corn fed beef when all of the beef in the US is corn fed save for a few that are grass fed.  I was there with a big group and only half of the group got their food and most of them were almost done with their steak by the time my half of the table got the food.\n\nThe bread they served was great but even that was doled out like it was gold. We asked for some bread about three times before we got it. A 120 meal should taste better and get better service."

            "review": "I've been there twice with my friend and wowed both times. The ambience and layout of the restaurant is sleek. The eating area is perfect for a date for two or larger party - and the booths are big enough (and far enough away from one another) to allow for privacy. The service was spot-on. You are attended immediately, and the wait staff watch attentively to serve the next plate as soon as you are finished. Aside from the atmosphere/service: FOOD IS OUTSTANDING. My first visit I tried something new and rather adventurous: Bone Marrow Flan. It was SO delicious. Paired with capers, mushroom marmalade, and parsley: a taste of heaven. And served so beautifully in the bone itself! A+ to the aesthetics and taste. Such a perfect prelude to the beef! But, there was more goodness to come. Prior to placing any order, you are presented a mouth-watering platter of beef for your choice. My first visit, I tried the USDA PRIME Rib-Eye (from Nebraska). Second time, I went for gold and ordered the American Wagyu Filet Mignon. And I'll tell you: THE BEST STEAKS I EVER HAD! What really stands out is the dry rub. Every piece of meat will melt in your mouth. I have no idea how they prepare those steaks, but CUT is the only place where I can finish an entire steak (because it's so darn good), and you really note a difference in flavor and excellence in cooking technique. The waiters never rush to take your plate during the moments you take a little \"break\" from eating. As the name of the restaurant: every \"cut\" of meat will be full of flavor and have you thinking: this place is truly a \"cut above the rest.\" So, if you're skeptical of price: it's worth every dollar. You'll eat one of the most delicious steaks/meals EVER, and talk about it to all your friends! If you're a steak lover, you will be happy you went. My only advice is don't fill up on the complimentary bread: save it for the steak! Another note: you can order bone marrow as a side to your steak. Keep in mind, one serving is enough for 2 even 3 people as you'll use sparingly since it's very rich, but OH SO GOOD!"

What brings me back to this place is the kobe steak sashimi.  No gastronomical adventure in Vegas is complete without this dish.  If you're a carnivore, it is not to be missed.  If I could eat only one thing in Vegas, it would be this."

            "review": "I was really excited to try this place as I had heard a lot of great things about it.  I went with a group of nine hungry people and tasted the following items on the menu:\n\n- Bone marrow flan\n- Bite of the bone marrow dumpling in ox tail bouillon\n- Kobe rib eye w/house made steak sauce on the side\n- Mac n cheese\n- Tempura onion rings\n- Creamed spinach\n- Saut\u00e9ed spinach\n- Caramelized corn\n\nUnfortunately I was less then impressed.  The place was swanky as expected and the service was right on point (except one huge thing that happened which I'll mention in a bit) but the food was sub par.  I liked the decor but the only thing was that it was difficult to get into and out of the seats as the chairs were heavy and hard to maneuver around...not a big deal though.  I was most disappointed by the food and service.  Let's say I wouldn't recommend this restaurant out of all of the other restaurants on the strip.  \n\nThey first served three or four different types of breads while waiting for our appetizers.  I tried their pretzel and onion bread which was so delicious and warm.  I started off with the bone marrow flan served with toasted bread which was tasty.  I also had a bite of the bone marrow dumpling which was good too.  Then the steaks came out and it was a disaster!  One of the most important things about the preparation of any type of meat is temperature, as we all know, ESPECIALLY at a steakhouse and let me tell you, it was a complete wreck.  I had ordered a medium-rare steak and it literally came out medium-well while my friends who ordered medium steaks came out borderline rare.  After trying to suck it up and eat my well-done steak, my friends told me I should really tell the server.  I finally got myself to tell him (I don't ever send food back to the kitchen...I feel so bad) but he told me that my steak was medium-rare like I didn't know what I was talking about.  It was pretty ridiculous because it was no joke, wayyy overdone.  I didn't push it and ended up trading steaks with my friend who ordered a medium and got a borderline rare steak.  On top of that, I didn't think the steak was flavorful enough and there was nothing special about their house made steak sauce...to me it was like bbq sauce.  With that said, I would like to note that other than the steak incident which was terribly handled, the service was great.\n\nAs for the sides, their mac n cheese, creamed spinach and corn were very tasty while the onion rings were not so great (but then again they're just onion rings) and sauteed spinach was bland.\n\nI would like to mention that a lot of people did enjoy their food so it may have just been the temperature of my steak and how they were unwilling to do anything about it when it was obviously well overdone but COME ON, we're at a steakhouse right?!?!  And honestly, I've tasted way better steak...I really wanted to like this restaurant but it failed in my books."

For the steak, it seems the servers really push wagyu on you. I got the American wagyu filet ($85 for 6 ounces, which is plenty of food for me) with carmelized shallots and cipollini onions. We got sides of the fries, Mac & cheese and kale for the table. Overall the food was good, but I found it a bit over priced."

Its still a blur how we managed that journey but dinner itself was unforgettable.\n\nI booked a 6:30pm reservation that morning and was seated promptly when we arrived. Suzie and I both sat in our cozy booth and selected 3 appetizers, a steak and a dessert. \n\nFOOD:\nBone Marrow Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Sala: Our favorite! Delicious, creamy and full of flavor. Absolutely divine!\n\nMaple Glazed Pork Belly, Asian Spices, Sesame-Orange Dressing, Dancing Demon Plum Compote: mmmm mmmm finger licking good! It was delicious and the meat was mouth watering and moist.\n\nBig Eye Tuna Tartare, Wasabi Aioli, Ginger, Togarashi Crisps, Tosa Soy: Delish!  It was refreshing, lightly crispy and a great balance to our other two, heavier appetizers. I love wasabi aioli!\n\nU.S.D.A. PRIME, Illinois Corn Fed, Aged 21 Days\nBone In New York Sirloin 20 Oz* - One of the best steaks I had and it wasnt even wagyu. As usual I love my steaks rare and it was perfectly, juicy and like butter when it hit the knife. I'm still dreaming about it right now. \n\nRaspberry Stuffed Doughnuts, Dark Chocolate Sabayon, Raspberry Stracciatella- Nothing special. Wish I ordered something else. It was a bit plain for my taste and I'm a sucker for donuts.\n\nSERVICE: \nWe had excellent customer service and our waiter was professional, personable and an overall very chill guy. None of that prententious bs. \n\n \nIn conclusion, everything but the dessert we selected was delicious. I will definitely make an effort to come here every time I visit Vegas.

We were greeted & seated promptly & immediately given a extensive wine list.  We're not into wines, but enjoyed the  specialty alcoholic & non-alcoholic cocktails  We were offered many types of house breads.   Ordered the Bone Marrow Flan appetizer which was very smooth & tasty, but felt the mushroom marmalade was salty.  I order the Nebraska 35 days Ribeye,  which was for some reason also appeared a bit salty for my taste.   I've had many better steaks in the past for less costs.  My wife had the Pan Roasted Maine Lobster, which was good.   I must say the service was excellent.   Had many different staff tending to our table.    The reason I can't provide a higher rating is high cost versus the overall food taste."

We picked this one looking at photos, most steakhouses that had reservations around 9 just didn't look like that dark, upscale, cool restaurant you want.\n\nThe food was pretty great, pricey but what do you expect. We ate way too much and it was mostly all great. No significant complaints but they didn't get our \"slightly dirty\" martini right. The first two (one for each) weren't dirty at all that we could tell and my boyfriends second one (just one for me) he requested a little more dirty and it was FILTHY. he was ok with it but I thought he should have sent it back. I think our other waiter (there was a bit of a team) overheard me say it was too far the other direction and asked him when I went to the ladies if it was ok, and he is too nice to be honest and drank it."

Restaurant was beautiful, service was commendable, food was delicious. \n\nSince it was my birthday my sister-in-law treated me by splitting the New Zealand ribeye, which was $180. I was hoping it was going to be better than the American Wagyu I had tried last time, but I was a little let down. Although the flavor was amazing and the steak was cooked perfectly, the texture did not seem any more tender than any other well-cooked American ribeye, so not really worth the additional cost to me.\n\nMy friend ordered the pork chop, since she had not been impressed by the steak on her previous visit, and I would have to say it was pretty awesome. It was a huge portion, with the bone, seasoned deliciously and perfectly moist and tender. It was such a large portion that she cut it up into snack size bites to take home and I must say that the pork did not dry out and was still delicious when we snacked on it for breakfast the next morning (that would explain the meat in my bed!)\n\nWe also shared amongst the four of us two of the bone marrow appetizers, a side of the mushrooms and a side of the macaroni & cheese which were all delicious. \n\nThey bring a tray of different breads to your table and you get to choose which one you like before the place it on your plate. They also roll out a cart of their prime cuts of beef to show you the marbling and educate you  more on the meat. The water glasses are filled before they even get 1/4 full. Our server did take a little long to bring out our check to us, but no biggie. It was a good first dinner during our weekend in Vegas."

            "review": "My review will strictly be on what I ordered:\n\nBone Marrow Flan - Probably the best flan I've had thus far.  They had obviously taken the time and finesse to make sure the bone marrow was cooked evenly.  The texture was luscious, melt-in-you-mouth, and rich.  The mushroom puree alongside was fantastic and brought each bite a bit more earthiness.\n\nU.S.D.A. PRIME Dry Aged 35 days - TRUE steak/beefy flavor.  Tasted like a nice steak straight from your own grill, just with a bit more quality to it.  \n\nAmerican Wagyu from Snake River Farms - Fat was nicely marbled throughout, without being too overwhelming.  Great beefy flavor throughout.  \n\nTrue Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef from Miyazaki Prefecture, Kagoshima - While each bite was TO DIE FOR, I could only handle just a few.  Heavily marbled to the point where that flavor you anticipate from a good steak is lost.  You know that fatty strip alongside a ribeye? That's what the entire steak tasted like.  \n\nChocolate Souffle - As someone who focuses in patisserie, I was hesitant trying this, given that were were in a steakhouse and typically speciality restaurants lose focus on all other items.  I was wrong.  The souffle was beautiful... light.. airy... yet so decadent at the same time.\n\nOVERALL:  Amongst the 3 steaks I've tried, I prefer the American Wagyu.  It still delivered a marvelous beefy flavor that you want from a steak, while delivering a slight richness from the marbling.  Well balanced in my opinion.  \n\nLike I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!"

            "review": "I must confess, I'm not big on steaks.....unless it's covered in A1 or some sort of sauce or sandwiched between pieces of bread.\n\nTheir BONE MARROW ($17) was the reason why I convinced my friends to check out Cut with me. I've been on the hunt for good marrow dishes in HNL for quite some time now and was excited to hear of a place that serves it during our trip. I was very disappointed to find that it was actually a \"bone marrow FLAN.\" \n\nThe precious, delicate marrow was scooped out, mixed with custard and possibly baked or steamed. What saved the dish was the mushroom tapenade (reminds me of the mushroom duxelle you find in beef wellingtons). The toast points were not even toasted, so it didn't really hold the flan well at all. \nBone was washed clean and scrubbed (see pic). Really not worth the $17.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/J4CATH00YZrq8Bne2S4_cw?userid=lsSiIjAKVl-QRxKjRErBeg\n\nThe other appetizers were worth mentioning:\n\nKOBE BEEF SASHIMI WITH SPICY RADISH SALAD ($22) was really good and made me almost forget about my sad marrow dish. The steak melts in your mouth and the citrusy sauce evened out the spicy bitterness of the salad.\n\nThe BEEF CARPPACIO ($22) was also very tasty. It was a little thicker than what I expected for carpaccio but it was the perfect bite along with the shaved black truffle, fennel and parm. \n\nI got the ORGANIC POUSSIN ($34):\nRotisserie-styled with trumpet mushrooms. I was worried b/c it looked very dry, they left out the \"natural jus\" sauce that was promised on the menu. But all was forgiven when I cut into my tasty, juicy bird. Everyone tried and loved this dish (one friend even took my drumstick, bastid).\n\nThey were even satisfied with their Wagyu steaks ($160 for 8oz $40 for each additional 2 oz.....say what?!), even though 2 out of 3 were overcooked."

Uncomfortable & they kill the ambiance of an otherwise decent restaurant.\n-  beef filets, even when prepared medium rare, were dry.\n-  when your food arrives there are a ton of waitstaff, but drinks were refilled too rarely & some in my party didn't get new silverware after the appetizer utensils were cleared.\n-  bernaise sauce was kind of weak.  I'd expected more.  The shallot - red wine reduction was tastier.\n-  they told us we'd reserved the \"banquet room\" and when we should up it was just two long tables standing next to one another in the middle of the dining room.  We wanted to do toasts for the groom but couldn't really without ruining everyone else's dining experience.  Kinda felt like they misrepresented the space, it wasn't at all what you'd think of as a \"banquet room\".\n\nGood stuff:\n-  most everything else positive!\n-  one of the best pork chops I've ever tasted\n-  very generous portions (if I'm paying 38 bucks for a pork chop can I really say that?  I say \"yes, I can\".  It was big, juicy, and the size was enormous.  worth the money).  Each of the sides were large as well.  Unless you're super hungry and just a glutton in general, you should plan to share the app's.\n-  raw Kobe app with Asian spices was a bit too salty, but the flavors & texture was otherwise satisfying.  \n-  poached egg, asparagus, & bacon app was awkward to eat but was sinfully tasty!\n-  mash potatoes were good but the $25 addition of black truffles didn't do much for me\n-  Wine was served properly and efficiently\n-  Tara, our waitress, we perfect.  She dealt with my group of buddies professionally without being cold.  She gave us honest answers to our questions and made sure to stop by frequently to see if we needed anything.\n\nWith so many good dining options in Vegas and me not being a big beef eater, I may not return, but if I do, I'm definitely getting that pork chop again. OMG that thing was tasty!"

Yes, you are looking at about $130 for a steak, and no, there are no sides with it, but this will be the best piece of meat you have ever put in your mouth.

The staff knows their meat and wine so feel free to ask lots of questions or let them guide you through the rest of the meal. Make sure you round out your meal with some of their great seasonal sides.\n\nThat's it, it is that simple! Just remember to thank me later for pushing you to get the Wagyu, and hate me later because NO steak will ever live up to this one! \n\n*One last note...If you are that person that does not order their meat medium rare [to each their own, I guess], then take your big boy money down the hall and go to B&B for some pasta instead. No reason to waste that beautiful meat by having them over cook it."

As a vegan, it's probably not in the forefront of my mind to head to a steakhouse, but for someone special who happens to complete my puzzle, even though he is the polar opposite of me,  I'd go just about anywhere. \n\n\nTell me why I couldn't get a reservation for 7 on opentable? We made it for the early bird special (meaning, I don't even know what it's like to eat dinner early I.e. 6) and to our surprise was empty.... Until.... It hit 7, and for good reason too! \n\nFirstly, let me address the decor, beautiful lighting fixtures, modern feel with throw pillows at the booths and it's nice and dim to set that romance.\n\n\nNext, the wine... Scotch, bourbon and mixed drink list is extensive, get ready for that, they also have a cocktail waitress making table side drinks to order.\n\nThe service! So pleasant! Knew everything about the entire menu and could recommend some great dishes for my... Selective taste.\n\nHe ensured the table was promptly serviced, I also really appreciated the bread selection which is also table side, I could not enjoy any of it but! My date said they were divine! \n\n\nThe fooooooooddsd firstly, when I tell you a $36 selection of vegetables have never tasted so good, I mean it! Roasted to perfection! And that asparagus!!!!! It was like heaven on earth, grilled with just a hint of liquid smoke flair (tasted like it but our waiter said hickory wood will do that)\nI just wish it was more asparagus than anything else lol. \nMy honey said his steak was perfection and because it was his birthday, he had some desserts coming to him! the most wonderful touch was the card sitting at the table when we got there. Signed by the staff.\n\n\nI would recommend this place to everyone. \n\n\nI would love to make this review longer, but there is not enough time in the day!"

It's as if the entire cast of Thunder from Down Under are waiters at CUT by day and male strippers by night.  Except at CUT they only serve wagyu beef and not a big heaping pile of greasy muscle man-meat.  \n\nThey like to play old Bruce Springsteen music while you enjoy your steak.

It's supposed to be marbled with fat -- that's where you get the flavor. And it's supposed to be charred dark on the outside -- it's not burnt but quickly charred to keep the flavor & juiciness in. \n\nThat said, our meal at Cut was one of the best dining experiences we've had in a very long time, if not ever.\n\nFirst, we got a great big booth, just the 2 of us, and the atmosphere is very nice -- modern, hip -- even the music is classic rock. I love the little pedestal sinks in the bathroom, and he loved the dining room chandeliers.\n\nA breadstick basket with cheese sticks arrived -- delicious -- followed by the best gougeres (cheese puffs) I've ever had. They were made of/in puff pastry, which is unusual, & so good. Then, after we ordered, the bread tray with fantastic pretzel bread & focaccia, which we devoured, knowing damn well the meal would be filling. And, oh, it was.\n\nHe had the tuna tartare with avocado on top -- a healthy & delicious portion of both. I had thinly slices asparagus on brioche with a soft-boiled egg & bacon vinagrette on top -- oh my god, it was amazing. I absolutely devoured it. All the flavors came together and made for orgasmically explosive bites.\n\nThen his dry-aged 16-oz bone-in rib eye & my pork chop. Both were thick, juicy, moist, cooked just right, and fantastic. Our onion rings on the side were a bit superfluous, but, dipped in panko, we had to eat them cautiously so as not to fill up on such deliciousness. \n\nSomehow, we made room for dessert, and good thing. Best chocolate souffle I've ever had -- served in its own little sauce pan. His apricot/blackberry crumble, with a shortbread crumble, wasn't so bad either. :)\n\nAs for service, it was perfect. It was timed just right so that we got our appetizers pretty quickly but had some time to digest before dinner. The servers were all attentive, and there were many of them, and the presentation was fantastic, very old-world steakhouse elegant with tableside presentation, dishes all served simultaneously, and everything presented just right. He also loved his martini with blue-cheese-stuffed olives. Both our wines were great. A little pricey by the glass, but that was no surprise.\n\nWe were a little hesitant to try Cut because a) it's not so cheap, and b) Wolfgang Puck has spread himself a bit thin over the last 10+ years, and some restaurants have suffered because of it.\n\nCut is not one of those restaurants."

The cocktails, steaks and sauces were superb, and the modern space - think West Elm modernist - was a sophisticated variation on the usual steakhouse decor.  Our appetizers were good, but not as impressive as we would have hoped for a dinner with a $300 price tag.  My shaved hearts-of-palm watercress salad had a nice blend of flavors but the way the ingredients were cut gave it a clumsy mouthfeel.  My fiancee's tuna tartar was much better - but not exactly original.  Overall, it's a good steakhouse, but they ought to make an even greater effort to distinguish themselves as a modern steakhouse alternative, such as greater attention to the subtle elegance achieved in both rare ingredients, atypical blends of flavor, and tactile qualities in their starters.  We did not get dessert but hear they are really good.  Wine list good also."

We are serious Foodies, and are certainly not afraid to spend serious bucks on a delicious meal. With that being said, I do believe this is the most I have ever spent on a meal for 2 people. \n\nAmbiance - 3 Stars - \n-Different decor than your normal steakhouse. Lots of metals/mirrors gave it a bit more of a modern feel Leather benches (if you're lucky enough to get a booth) with leather table tops were nice. We thought the decor was a bit \"cold\" due to the usage of sharp edges and more modern materials. \n-The seats in the middle of the restaurant did not seem appealing at all. The chairs looked like something you would sit on in a conference room at your office. \n-It is LOUD in here. There is not an lot of space, and the use of hard materials   everywhere causes sound to bounce in every direction. They could really use some sound absorbing materials on the ceiling to cut down the noise. We were lucky to be sitting right next to each-other in a booth, because if we weren't we would most likely have been shouting across the table. \n\nService - 4.5 Stars - \n- Immediately seated at a nice booth, with reservations. Wait staff was attentive. Items were brought to the table in a timely manner. Steak was carved and plated table-side along with the side dishes. Sides were also refilled by the wait staff as they were consumed from the plate, which was a nice touch. \n\nFood - 3 Stars - \n- All of the items brought out prior to dinner were quite good. Bread sticks, cheese pastries, and the assorted bread tray. We did not get any appetizers as to not spoil the, assumed to be, spectacular cut of beef we would receive for our main course. I would give the \"breads\" an overall 4.5 stars. The focaccia and pretzel roll were both really tasty. The bread sticks were buttery. The pastry was buttery. And of course, the bread was served with butter topped with Rosmary and smoked sea salt. \n- Main course: 34 oz. Wagyu Porterhouse for 2. Sides: Cavatappi Pasta mac & Cheese, Qubec Cheddar, Shaved Baby Squash, Wild Field Mushrooms. \n- Wild Field Mushrooms: 5 Stars, these were delicious and a great addition to the steak. Generously Buttered. \n- Shaved Baby Squash: 4 Stars. Nothing too special about this, but it was a good change of pace from all of the butter used on everything else. Fresh & Crisp, seasoned lightly. \n- Cavatappi Pasta mac & Cheese, Qubec Cheddar: 3.5 Stars. It got old, quick. A good take on Mac & Cheese. I'm always a fan of Mac that uses more elegant cheeses than just yellow cheddar or even american, but this didn't have that \"comfort\" feeling you normally get with Mac. After one spoonful it gets old. Thick, cheesy, buttery. \n\n- 34 oz. Wagyu Porterhouse for 2, served medium-rare: 2 Stars. This isn't the first time that we have had a Wagyu porterhouse at a steakhouse, and we had high expectations. Unfortunately they fell very short. Even before choosing a restaurant we knew we wanted Wagyu. It was served with 5 different sauces. We sampled them, but normally don't take sauce with our steak - as the beef itself should be the star. \n\n After all the build up from the waiter about how the steaks are 100% Wagyu, and our past experiences with Wagyu and Kobe - I was SERIOUSLY excited. My first impression was that it looked small. I would say we were served something more along the lines of 24-28oz. It was not a \"pretty\" cut of meat, it looked a bit beat up, grizzly, and fatty. When he brought it out my heart sank, and I immediately knew this was not going to be the mouth watering heart melting piece of beef we had set out for. \n\nThe steak had just the right amount of salt/pepper/garlic/onion on the outside. The beef itself, however, did not live up to the hype. The Filet portion was extremely tender, and decently flavorful (for Filet). The Strip portion had around the same flavor quality as the Filet, unexpected. The beef did not have that glorious taste you would expect from a fine piece of meat like this, especially for the price. When you're paying triple digits for a steak, you expect it to be superb. The overall flavor profile for the steak was Butter. The beef was not rich tasting at all, and was actually quite bland.\n\nDessert - 5 Stars - We didn't order anything, but the hotel concierge made note that it was my Fiances birthday. They brought out a generous slice of the Banana Pie which was absolutely amazing. Served on a plate with a scoop of ice cream, and Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce. Dessert was probably the best part of the meal.\n\nCost - 4 Stars - It's inflated, but it's Vegas. \n\nMaybe our taste buds were off that night, or we actually did receive a sub-par cut of beef, I'm not sure. The Asst. GM, Matt, gave me his card and assured us the next cut of beef we received from them would surpass our expectations. With all the 5 star reviews, I would probably give it another chance."

Here, You basically pay for the name and for the cool white collarless blazers the hostesses wear.\n\nReservation at 5:30pm right when they open for dinner. Empty restaurant but we weren't seated until 5:45pm. This indicated that the staff had trouble prepping so they need to up their game and readiness.\n\nExperience at the beginning was great. The manager brought out the choice meats and we were promptly served bread and water.\n\nSlow considering the fact that they were cooking steak and serving a large party all at once. Outside of all of these factors, it was STILL slow. \n\nFood was mediocre. Overpriced for what you get. Honestly, the appetizers we got (mac and cheese, potato puree etc, wagyu sashimi) were better than the actual steaks and meat courses. I've eaten at $$ to $$$ restaurants with better service and quality. I've also eaten at similar $$$$ restaurants with better service and quality. What's crazy is that I didn't even feel this way when I ate at their other location in LA. It's just a step down and difference in the same chain that I wouldn't have expected from something with Puck's name on it. It's almost like vegas cheapened this chain just like everything else. It's equivalent to Flemming's or even outback slapping wolfgang's name on their steaks and expecting people to pay.\n\nIn a nutshell, the vegas branch could be great but it isn't. It's just mediocre. Guess they figured that all the wasted people wouldn't notice. \n\nIt should be noted that this experience is only indicative of the Vegas branch of this chain. The one in LA has ALOT better service, staff and attention to detail. But maybe it was because we actually ordered Japanese wagyu there. \n\nWhat this tells me is that at the vegas location, quality of service is based on what you order and amount of money you put on the tab. This is sad and unsustainable because you're still paying money regardless of what you order. \n\nIf you're looking to enjoy this place to the fullest, either go to the one in California or order the most expensive thing on the menu when you go to the Vegas location."

Beef tartare and the wagyu carpaccio salads were great appetizers.\n\nThe 16oz aged beef was ordered a rare+, and was prepared with care. The exterior char was good, although some silver remained with my particular cut.\n\nOverall I would come back again, it was a good experience."

This is a true steak house with many cuts of high end meat including both American and Japanese Wagyu beef. The service was impeccable and the manager stopped by twice to make sure we were ok with the table location and then again to ensure our satisfaction. My friend has a soy allergy and they accommodated her allergy by pairing a special sauce that was soy free. The American Wagyu was my favorite out of the tasting plate. I don't know how I will ever eat another piece of meat without comparing to Cut!!! The prices are best for those with deep pockets.... Worth every penny!"

I wasn't overly impressed, but the restaurant is a nice spot and less stuffy than say Michael Mina's restaurant in the Bellagio. \n\nBread - Cut loves bread. With a variety of assorted rolls, cheese bread and pop overs, don't fill up on bread or you'll be disappointed \n\nWe shared the Brussel sprouts and beet salad 'to accompany our mains, the wagyu beef. They have a variety of cuts, both American and imported which you can select from. \n\nThey serve the steak with a variety of mustards, which makes for a fun pairing game. I will say, Alexanders on SF serves Wagyu with a variety of salts, which I preferred to mustards. \n\nMy only complaint would be that you need to select at a minimum a 6 oz cut of steak. I prefer having 4 oz and it's such a waste to leave wagyu on your plate! \n\nWine list is extensive with very helpful staff who assisted with pairing and taking photos of us (ha!). \n\nAs far as Wolfgang Puck restaurants go, I still prefer Spago to Cut. But you won't be disappointed."

The food is as you would expect, inventive and adventurous. Not everyday you get to try steak of this quality. \nIt is missing the fifth star because the food, while very good, it isn't THE best in Vegas. Also, the service is very, very Vegas - snooty without class, make you wait in line outside the club even though their is no one inside kind of crap. Not everyone there is like that, but enough of them are (especially at the hostess stand) to make it annoying."

It's been a week since I was there, and I can't seem to justified the mediocre (at best) steaks we had!  I also grill steaks at home and have frequented many steakhouses, therefore I expected at this price point, I should be satisfied with what I pay for.

The GM lied to my dad to get us to have dinner at CUT. The GM was extremely rude & got into an argument with my father & my husband. Unbelievable!

The Waygu was overcooked, ribeye tasty and both sirloins my favorite of the 4 (I actually liked the Washington best because it was kind of sweet which sounds weird for a cut of beef but it was really different and tasty).\n\nWith that being said, I thought the sides were EH...cream of spinach my favorite, fingerling potatoes kinda crappy (I think I've had better at Outback), mac n cheese ok, mashed potatoes kinda like Boston Market, you get the idea.\n\nThe wine selection was excellent though and so was this cocktail I got called Pins and Needles that's a gin drink served with cucumber and egg white.  It's only about 1/4 of the way full when you get it which is certainly disappointing but I guess standard for a top notch steakhouse (or big name I should say) but definitely delicious and refreshing.\n\nBest part hands down was the service.

But you know what they say, you get what you pay for and I had an AMAZING food experience here.\n\nSTARTERS:\n*Complimentary bread - There 4 types of breads, 2 which are made in house.  The 2 breads made in house and is delicious is an onion bread and a pretzel bread.  However, the pretzel bread is a must try!\n*Bone Marrow Flan - Mmmm!!  At first I was a bit sketchy about how it sounded when our waitress explained it but I'm so glad we ordered it!  The bone marrow is scooped out and mixed with various ingredients to have the consistency of flan and placed back inside the bone, served with parsley, onions, and capers with a side of mushroom marmalade.  A must order!!\n*Maple Glazed Pork Belly - YUM!  The pork belly had a slight crisp on the outside while still remaining tender and moist in the inside.   Bartlett pear compote is place on top of the four pieces that created fantastic taste that wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.\n\nENTR\u00c9E:\nA Tasting of NY Sirloin ($145 plus additional $40 for 2oz. of Australian Wagyu) - In my defense for ordering a dish at this price, my friend and I shared it.\nNOTE: They can split your order on two plates for $6 or they can just give you an extra plate for you to split it yourself at no charge.\n*Australian Wagyu (2oz) - DELICIOUS!  I'm not a meat type of person, but I was absolutely blown away by the meat just MELTS in your mouth!  This was by far, the best of the three tastings.\n*Nebraskan USDA Prime (4oz) - YUM!  This was my second favorite tasting of the three.  Although the steak didn't melt in my mouth like the Australian did, the Nebraskan was still juicy and flavorful.\n*American Wagyu - Good, but my least favorite.  The marbling of the meat wasn't great as the other two pieces of steak.\n \nSIDES:\n*Bone Marrows (Add to the cuts) - GOOOOD!  The bone marrow is already scooped out for you so you don't have to do any of the work!\n*Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg - YUM!!  The organic egg comes on top of the creamed spinach where they then mix it together upon bringing it to your table and adds an additional yummy flavor to the dish.\n\nDESSERT:\n*Strawberry Shortcake - Mmmm, dessert!!  The strawberry shortcake was delicious!  A scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and strawberry sorbet is placed in between two pieces of shortbread and on top of a warm strawberry mixture.  Of course you can't forget about the whipped cream on the top.  Simply delicious!\n\nSERVICE:\nPhenomenal!!!  Sometimes you can expect rather stuck up waiters/waitresses at finer restaurants, but not here.  The staff was extremely friendly, attentive, and even had brief conversations with us.  They all made this dining experience a truly great one!"

But every once in a while the strip produces a place that is just so damn good that you can't hate on it.  Cut is one of those places.  I have very high expectations when I go to Wolfgang Puck's restaurants, and have been disappointed at some of my most recent meals at his more casual places in Las Vegas.  But Cut came through with one of the best steaks I have ever had.  \n\nCut is a very modern steakhouse located in the Palazzo right next to the Casino.  The decor is dark, yet very squared and modern in dimensions.  The waiters are all dressed in professional, modern uniforms, and the food is served in a minimalist plate presentation.  The whole restaurant theme is executed very well for what Wolfgang Puck is trying to do with Cut.  \n\nThe steaks are shown to you on a cart, much like a lot of steakhouses do.  But Cut has a wide array of steaks to choose from that differentiate them from most steakhouses.  They have Japanese Kobe, American Wagyu (Kobe), Nebraska Corn-Fed, Prime, and a couple others I am forgetting.  Basically you can get whatever kind of steak you want.  You will be paying top price for these steaks, as the cheapest steak is around $55, but you will get what you pay for, which is an amazing steak.  \n\nI went with the Nebraska Corn-fed Prime Ribeye, bone-in, and got the Tuna Tartar to start.  Both were amazing.  The tuna was of very high quality, and was perfectly seasoned.  The Ribeye was caramelized nicely, and it was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  You couldn't ask for anything more.  The best part of the meal, of course, was the bone.  Ordering the bone-in Ribeye is always the key to ordering a great steak.  This is because when you embrace the animal instinct inside of you, you will find that chewing on a bone is one of life's hidden treasures (dogs know how it goes).  \n\nWe ordered a great Napa Cabernet Sauvignon to go with the steak, and had a great meal.  I have not been back simply because I can't afford to have a meal like that every day, but I plan on going back next time someone wants to go to a steakhouse.  \n\nGood work Wolfgang! You came through, again!"

Saturday night at 7:00, we expected the place to be crowded, but to my surprise it was only half full.  I had requested a \"nice table.\"  They sat us in a small alcove with a view of the entire dining room.  This is now my favorite seat in the house. \n\nOur waitress was very friendly and helpful.  Their wine lists are now all on iPads, which allow for easier navigation of their selections.  You can sort the wines out in anyway you like, making it easier to find what you want.  We each ordered a different cut of the American Wagyu steak, filet, rib eye and strip.  Three different sides, fingerling potatoes, broccoli rabe, and creamed spinich with quail egg.  Service as always is impeccable.  Each dish was brought out at the same time and a server to each plate, presented us each at the same time our food.  As expected with the Wagyu, the quality of the steaks dictated the rest of the meal.  Our steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare, juicy and above all flavorful.  Seasoned perfectly, enough to enhance rather than take away the beefy flavor.  Excellent crust.  The steaks are much richer than normal steaks, that despite the smaller oz, we were very full after the meal with leftovers of our sides.  \n\nI was a bit surprised as I felt like I had a better experience the first time.  Again I feel that the overall quality of all the food in Vegas has gone down a notch.  Either that or I am not as easily impressed anymore.  Still we had an enjoyable dinner and a great experience, despite the beating my wallet took after.  Will I return? If I get lucky on the craps table."

I didn't want to write this review because the waiter was so nice!\n\nOne thing I love about CUT is, they don't have a traditional bread basket. They have someone come to your table with a whole tray of options! My favorite is the pretzel bread. They will also bring a plate of different kinds of mustard to the table...I used the first one (not spicy) on the pretzel bread and it was delicious. We were seated in the lounge area in the front of the restaurant because when we made the reservation, the dining room was booked. It was very busy and it seemed like most of the people in the lounge were eating dinner, not just having drinks. \n\nI ordered the boneless filet (oscar style), brussels sprouts and potatoes. The filet was undercooked (I ordered medium) but I didn't send it back, in fear that it would be overcooked. I would rather have a little too much pink, then a well done steak. My biggest complaint was the oscar style. It looked different than any other restaurant because the asparagus was cut into tiny pieces and it was mixed in with the crab meat and b\u00e9arnaise sauce. It was more of a mixture on the top of the steak, instead of layering, how you usually see it. The main issue was the hard crunchy pieces in the oscar style!! I don't know what it was but I was afraid it was something gross. It was disappointing and ruined my dinner.\n\nSince I was still hungry after not being able to enjoy my steak, I ordered dessert. The waiter recommended the banana cream pie and said it was their signature dessert. It was pretty yummy and even though it's not big, I would recommend sharing it with someone.\n\nCUT was one of my favorite steakhouses and I used to recommend it to everyone but after Tuesday night, I can't say that anymore. To top it off, the hostess didn't greet us when we walked in....but when we walked out, I said goodbye and she didn't say anything! Another hostess walked up and said bye right before we were out of the door."

The presentation of raw meat as you order was unappetizing too. Would not recommend this place out of all the amazing Vegas options."

            "review": "Disclaimer:  Our reservation was coordinated through a mutual friend and GM of The Source, a Wolfgang Puck restaurant in DC.\n\nWhen we were in Vegas a month ago for the cigar convention, we had heard from a ton of people that we had to try CUT.  We got a reservation and decided to hit the bar beforehand.  The bartender was incredibly polite and had a real good time talking to him.  We tried some new shots and had some excellent Manhattans.\n\nThe GM/Host let us know our table was ready.  After being sat, and introductions, they showed us their wine list, which is on an iPad.  It was very easy to pick the Bordeaux that we wanted (2005 Chateau Gracia).  While we waited for that, we put in an order of appetizers (Maryland Blue Crab and Jumbo Shrimp Crab Cake and also Pork Bellys).  Both were excellent, but I could have eaten that crab cake all day long.\n\nOur wine was brought out exactly as it should have been.  Presented to the person who ordered it and then poured to the others from there. Myself and a friend ordered the 28 day Rib Eye, and our other friend ordered the Wagyu. For sides we had the squash dish and I think potato something.\n\nCrumbs from bread never lasted long.  Someone was always there refilling glasses or cleaning the table.  We knew a lot of people that week and many stopped by.  The staff took notice and never attempted to interfere or rush us to the next part of our meal.  A good friend from a neighboring table decided to buy us a bottle of wine, and once again the iPad menu came out.  The wine can be pricey, so I simply opted to choose a region and allow them to choose the wine.  The Waitress was accommodating and polite throughout the process informing the gentlemen we had chosen a Bordeaux.  The bottle we received was a 1999 Chateau Leoville Barton which went excellent with out meal.\n\nNeedless to say, between the Manhattans and the wine, we were all feeling a little good at this point and perhaps even a bit loud for the restaurant.  That being said, we were never asked to be quiet or leave.   Later two desserts were brought to our table that we did not order, we're still unsure if these were from the chef or from our friend who we had been at the bar with and had since returned.\n\nI have never had such a beautiful meal or wonderful service.  The gentlemen who took care of us most this night was Pasquale, when I return I will definitely request him."

Our table was ready and set up beautifully for our large group, and the staff was extremely friendly.  My date and I ordered a salad for an appetizer, two filets, and mashed potatoes for a side.  The salad was ok, the steaks were over cooked and we had ordered them medium and they were well done and the potatoes were also ok.  All of the people in our party that ordered steak agreed that it was all overcooked.  Our uncle ordered the bone in ribeye medium rare and actually sent his back.  He told them to simply sear it on both sides and it still took about 10-15 minutes, in which the rest of the table was getting close to being finished with their meal.  When I made the reservations, I notified the staff that we would have two birthdays and they made a special complimentary dessert with their name on the plate, which was a nice touch.  In addition, when I also told the staff that we would have separate tickets and they informed me that it would take an additional 30 minutes, once the tabs were handed out.  That was definitely a true statement.  I feel like the meal/restaurant is overpriced for the quality; however, I gave CUT a 3-star for the staff."

For my main I had the American Wagyu Rib eye. This was the best steak I've ever eaten. I did order the creamy horseradish sauce but didn't really need it. The flavor of the beef was more than enough. We did order the Mac n cheese which was awesome and the spinach which was ok. The steak was amazing so I couldn't even think about the sides too much. To top things off we had the banana cream pie with banana ice cream. A must try it was so delicious. The many different levels of flavors infused with banana. This place lived up to all the things I've heard about it."

The bartenders, while sometimes overly busy and not attentive the way a dedicated server would be, have always been very nice and definitely knowledgeable when it comes to the food and drink menus.\n\nThis is, obviously, not the place to go if you are a vegetarian. In fact, it is not the place to go if you aren't eager for beef. The star of the menu (and what takes up about 3/4 of the menu) is the steak. I appreciate how the different types of beef (Illinois, Nebraska, Kobe, etc.) are separated into different sections on the menu. And it was nice to be able to order a 10oz petite NY strip. The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly - very delicious. Definitely seemed a bit over-priced, though.\n\nAnd, of course, no steak experience would be complete without a sauce and a side. I ordered the bernaise sauce, which was pretty good. However, the portion size for the sauce was ridiculously small. For the side, I had the mac 'n' cheese. It was great, but not $21 great.\n\nThe amuse at the beginning and little desserts at the end were great. And the breads were excellent too. And the drink menu is really good - decent selection of cocktails, wines, and beers. I was very happy to find a blanc de noirs on their wine list.\n\nOverall, even when dining at the bar, it's a good fine dining experience. And the steaks are definitely great."

Would you believe they have the audacity to charge FIFTY DOLLARS PER BOTTLE!?\n\nTo add insult to injury, the cocktails (while good) are both overpriced and undersized.  I guess it's all part of the Devine Plan - you're supposed to stay sober and focus on the food, the service and the ambiance ;-)\n\nThe ambiance matches the excessive price tags perfectly; it's an upscale, modernized rendition of an old school, traditional steak house.  If you've got your tuxedo or white dinner jacket handy, you'll feel right at home; you will not feel overdressed in a suit and tie.\n\nThe service here is very attentive, but their system leaves a little something to be desired.  They employ a tag-team approach, with one server being \"lead\" and the other an \"associate.\"  The hand-offs between them made me think of an old-school comedy team, but they somehow managed to carry it off.  While our \"lead\" had all the charm and poise of an IRS Auditor, his \"associate\" was sophisticated, charming, and gave great drink recommendations (though he didn't' warn me I'd have to order CUT's cocktails three at a time to equal the size of a normal cocktail).\n\nThe star of the show at CUT is unquestionably the food; the steak in particular!  Here's what we had:\n\n- Five different kinds of bread; the pretzel bread is completely legit, but the Focaccia bread http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cut-las-vegas?select=-IQgtg2DS9XxTGB_VxtDjQ and the bread sticks http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cut-las-vegas?select=SbAY5tKxmF3_j5kU18EWWg make my heart beat faster!\n\n- Bone Marrow Flan (Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cut-las-vegas?select=zciKCOnSRbA-Ov9PCjBFOA \nI was hoping this dish would rock my world, but it didn't; it was good, but not as awesome as I'd hoped.\n\n- Wild Field Mushrooms & Japanese Shishito Peppers http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cut-las-vegas?select=pt6bjjx0DZ3KNE08m3iONA \nPart of CUT's \"A\" game for sure - this dish is completely delicious, and a perfect complement to the steaks.\n\n- Tempura Onion Rings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cut-las-vegas?select=PAZhHHsyKuHjmtmPgVagKQ \nThin, crispy, well salted goodness!\n\n- \"A Tasting Of New York Sirloin\" http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cut-las-vegas?select=dNPNiWAUK_H1PRwcu8bGiw \nThis steak sampler wasn't on the menu when we got to the restaurant, but I'd seen it online and asked for it.  All three cuts were exceptional:\n\n o U.S.D.A. PRIME, Nebraska Corn Fed, Dry Aged 35 Days, 4 oz\n o American Wagyu Beef From Snake River Farms, Idaho, 2 oz\n o True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef from saga prefecture, Kyushu, Japan 2 oz \n\nHowever, I was surprised that it was the USDA cut (the most inexpensive of the three) which tasted best.  These steaks were entirely other-worldly, and worth the price of admission all by themselves.\n\n\nFor me, I think the upscale ambiance, attentive service, and excellent food counterbalanced the ludicrous corkage fee, skimpy cocktails, and hefty price tag well enough that I have no qualms rating this a four star restaurant.  \n\nWill I come back?  The next time I'm in Vegas after robbing a bank and attending an AA meeting, I'll be back for sure! ;-)"

            "review": "WOW!! I am officially a fan of this restaurant!! A week after going there, I'm having major cravings of all the food I tried there. If funds were not an issue, I would eat here every week.\n\nThe place itself was nice, chic, a little upscale but not too stuffy. I liked the decor though it was a little dim (i like to see exactly what i'm eating!) We got a few complimentary treats - first, 3 little cheddar cheese cracker things ( one for each of us.) They were good but it was kind weird because they were so small and kind of tasted like those little goldfish crackers. There was also a bunch of these long, skinny, crunchy breadsticks. They were ok.  We were also able to choose from different breads that they had. I chose the pretzel bread and the focaccacia. They were both really good but the pretzel was especially good with this spicy horseradish mustard sauce they had. It might have been a wasabi mustard. I don't remember but I know that it was very good!!!\n\nThe menu was a little intimidating, as I am not exactly a steak connoisseur. Our server tried to explain the menu and how they cooked the steak but I had no idea what he was talking about and I was also not really paying attention. We opted out on the appetizers to keep our bill down but regretted that when we found out our steaks would take 45 minutes before they were ready. I decided on the USDA PRIME, Black Angus Beef 12 oz. Ribeye from Creekstone Farms in Arkansas City, Kansas - Aged 28 days ($58)  with chimichurri sauce on the side, which was a couple bucks. My boyfriend ordered the NY Sirloin - 8 oz. American Wagyu / Angus \"Kobe style\" Beef from Snake River Farms, Idaho ($85) and his brother ordered the Australian 100% Wagyu Beef from Oakleigh Ranch, Alexandria, NSW. 6 oz Rib Eye ($145.) We also got 3 sides - Yukon Gold Potato Puree ($12) French Fries with Herbs ($12) and Cavatappi Pasta \"Mac & Cheese\" - Quebec cheddar ($21).\n\nSo here's the breakdown - My 12 oz Black Angus Beef Ribeye dominated my boyfriend and his brother's steaks. It was massive. So if you are super hungry, that would be a great option. I ended up giving a lot of it to them bc I couldn't finish it. Anyway, I ordered a medium- well and I should have paid attention to the server because it came out more done than I would have liked. I later learned that all the steaks sit an extra 10 minutes which makes it a little more done. I should have had it done Medium instead. So it came out pretty firm but it was still absolutely delicious!! There was so much flavor in this steak that I didn't need the chimichurri sauce at all. The flavor from the steak overpowered the chimi sauce!!\n I didn't taste my boyfriends American Wagyu NY Sirloin but he said it was very good and he was happy with his choice. Now the best thing on our table was the Australian 100% Wagyu Beef Ribeye.  I was very lucky that my future brother in law shared his steak with me. It was honestly one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life!! My mouth is watering thinking about this steak. I've never had Wagyu beef before but after tasting it, it makes any other steak seem so average!  Wow - literally, I cannot even describe this steak. It was so rich and buttery. It really just melted in your mouth. I'm going to make a plan to go back and order this buttery goodness to myself  in the near future.\n\nAnd now the sides. The fries were ok. Pretty good but we barely ate them so next time we won't be getting those. The mac and cheese was delicious!! It came out way too hot and burnt your tongue but it was very very good so I didn't care. lol. The potato puree was phenomenal. It's in my top list of best mashed potatoes EVER next to Old Homestead's garlic mashed.  \n\nSo yeah, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves a good steak!! It was a little pricey (with a couple glasses of wine and soda, tax, tip and all it came out to well over $500 for 3 of us.)  It was worth every penny!!!"

The last night of our three day binge of Vegas to celebrate my 30th birthday and the close of my \"roaring twenties\" decade.\n\nWhere does one go for their last meal in Vegas let alone the last meal of their decade? \n\nBeing the dedicated researcher that I am, I found that CUT by Wolfgang Puck had the reputation of being one of the best steak houses in Vegas, if not the country. I took a chance and booked this restaurant as the capstone of my trip and hopefully a delicious finish to the decade.\n\nAnd boy, did it not disappoint.\n\nWhen we arrived, my buddies and I were ushered by a young, pretty hostess to a VIP table with couch seating replete with accent pillows overlooking the entire restaurant; almost as if we were seated at the head table and the entire restaurant was attending our party. We opened a parsimonious menu that listed a total of approximately 18 entrees, all steaks, all aged between 21-35 days. One of my buddies ordered the Nebraska cattle 14 oz New York strip (aged 35 days). He was a big guy yet he was barely able to finish his meal.\n\nNow allow me to get to the most important part... The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of their menu: authentic Wagyu beef imported from Japan's Miyazaki Prefecture. \n\nOur server presented our table raw Wagyu and \"American Wagyu\" (composed of a cross breed of Wagyu and American cattle) cuts of ribeye and New York strip to demonstrate the marbling of these impressive specimens of meat. An opportunity was presented for me to check off one of the loftiest items on my bucket list: a Wagyu steak dinner. The price of an 8 oz ribeye cut of one of the most sought-after steaks on the planet? A cool $155. \n\nDespite the high cost of this privilege, I couldn't turn down an opportunity to enjoy what would likely be one of the greatest meals of my life. Another buddy of mine took the plunge with me on this life-changing experience. We both ordered identical items: the 8 oz ribeye (medium rare), a side of seasoned french fries, and creamed spinach topped with a fried egg accompanied with a glass of Malbec. Solomon in all his riches never could have ordered a more decadent meal.\n\n40 excruciating minutes later, our meal was at last presented to us. I sliced off my first piece and as I completed the first bite, it felt like the Heavens burst forth and angels were singing the Hallelujah chorus in rapturous praise. Fellow Yelpers, I was not eating a steak. Oh no. This was God speaking to us. Delighting in us. Cutting into the steak was like cutting into marbled butter from Heaven, with the meat dissolving in my mouth; absorbing into my very soul.\n\n***\n\nT'was a meal that I will never forget. As we finished paying our bill, the manager of the restaurant came and thanked us for patronizing his restaurant though I'm sure it should've been us thanking him. A wonderful meal to cap off a wonderful decade. I'm not sure how many more decades the Good Lord has in store for me. However, if He should choose to allow me to choose my final meal on this Earth, I would like to travel back to this restaurant and enjoy one more time that which is truly a gift from on High."

Once the restaurant got crowded, it was tough getting our server's attention (which is odd for a high end steakhouse because it isn't like they have only one server for the whole restaurant). We ordered our food having pretty high expectations. We were pretty disappointed. I had the bone in rib eye, cooked medium. It was very chewy and did not taste very well seasoned. My girlfriends had the same and their rib eye steaks were also tough and chewy. The two that had the bone in filet said theirs was a little better but not seasoned enough. The sides and dessert were probably the best part of the meal but since this is a steakhouse, the steaks should have surpassed everything else on the menu. I will not be coming back here."

I came to Vegas to interview for a job and the guy who recruited me took me to Cut for dinner. It was very, very good.\n\nI ordered two different Bourbon drinks- I think both had ginger- they don't appear to be on the menu anymore but one was similar to the Samurai they serve now. Both were delicious. \n\nI got a pork belly appetizer- it came with a raspberry sauce on the pork that was incredible- one of the best pork belly dishes I have ever had. \n\nI alwyas get bone in ribeye and potato side when I go to a new steak place for comparison purposes. The steak here didn't have as much of a crust as I would like but it was seasoned well and the meat was very well cooked. The potato puree was smooth, not lumpy, seasoned well. \n\nFor desert they brought us free baked Alaska because they \"like to take care of thier locals\"- I wasn't a local yet but with food like this I was well on my way to becoming one. It was excellent- baked Alaska is a personal favorite of mine and this one was very well done. \n\nLet me say one other thing- the bread. Bread can be a good way to distinguish good restaurants from great and Cut definately nails it. They have a few different types that seem to rotate from what I can tell (pretzel is one of the best) and they bring it around on a cart. You can get whatever you want, as much as you want. This is good- it avoids fights to the death over the last pork belly bread a la Gordon Ramsay Steak. \n\nI have since been back 3-4 times and enjoyed it thoroughly every time. \n\n\nA general note on Vegas steak - some of the negative reviews of Cut are just ludicrous. They didn't have A1? Well guess what, you are gonna get A1 almost nowhere when it comes to fine dining. The steak came by itself on a plate without any circles painted on the plate or sliced up vegetables constructed like legos into an art piece? ITS A STEAK HOUSE. Seriously, if you have no idea where you are going its not really fair to post a negative review that boils down to \"this place wasn't the perfect hybrid of Sizzler and Alinea I was hoping for\". Steak places in Vegas are producing a very specific product to compete with a very specific set of restaurants. If you want a cheaper place with A1 why are you going to cut? Similarly if you care about plating why are you going to a steak restaurant? Use your brain."

This was honestly the best steak we had ever tasted. 6 ozs sounds little, but for the quality you are getting, it is absolutely phenomenal and wouldn't even care to have anymore because it becomes very overwhelming due to the tastiness, juiciness, and tenderness of the meat. Cooked perfectly at Medium. \n\nWe also ordered Pee Wee Potatoes as a side, which were also fantastic. (Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside). Paired well with their 4 different dipping sauces they bring out with your steak.\n\nThe grand finale was the Banana Cream Pie. Tasted like heaven in your mouth.

While the ambiance was nice and their wagyu steaks were quite good, it fell very short of expectations and we left extremely disappointed.\n\nOur server was super nice, but the service was mediocre at best. We ordered cocktails shortly after we were seated and 20 minutes later the cocktails had still not arrived. This was after the server had come back several times to showcase the beef, explain the menu, and even take our orders. I had to ask another server to check on the cocktails for us and they finally came 20-30 minutes after we were seated. How long does it take to pour a beer and make an old fashioned? All the best steakhouses I've been to in the past serve their cocktails promptly so patrons can enjoy them while chatting and looking through the menu. While not a huge deal, I could already tell this wasn't going to be a great dining experience.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered their signature three steak tasting menu (about $130 each for 10oz of steak!) I ordered mine medium with little char and my husband ordered his rare with regular char. When the steaks came out, it looked like they had mixed up our steaks. Mine was heavily charred on the outside while my husband's had very little char. We asked the server if the steaks were mixed up and they brought out the manager. Things got a little chaotic as he talked with the server and the two other people who brought out the steaks. Finally the manager talks to us and tells us he's pretty sure that the steaks are correct and that the reason there is more char on my steak is because the kitchen had to cook my steak for longer since I asked for medium. This didn't make any sense because the charring happens afterwards in a broiler and shouldn't affect how the steak is cooked on the inside (as explained to us by our server at the beginning of the evening). We finally cut into the steaks while all the staff watches and it became very clear that the steaks were switched. They apologized and switched the plates, but I found it very annoying and patronizing that the manager tried to explain the mix-up by making up an excuse for why the steaks were cooked improperly in the first place. Again, not a huge deal, but at a top-notch steakhouse, you really expect only two things: 1) that they cook their steaks properly and 2) that they don't mix up the orders. But now after all the confusion, we were left with two cut-up steaks that were originally served to the wrong people.\n\nFinally, the biggest disaster was my father-in-law's order. He ordered the bone-in ribeye medium rare. When he cut into it, it was very clearly medium. He isn't one to complain but I told him that if it wasn't cooked perfectly, he should return it. He eventually shows the server who agrees that it is overcooked. They take back the steak and my father-in-law has to wait another 15 min while the rest of us are eating. When the steak comes back out, it is very clearly rare. My father-in-law even remarks that the middle is still cold! He showed the server again and the server admits that it is obviously undercooked. He asks us if he should take it back to throw back on the grill, but at this point my father-in-law is so hungry and the rest of us have already finished eating our three bites of steak that he just resigns himself to eating his cold, raw steak. How does a world-class steakhouse mess up a steak *twice* in a row?\n\nThis was definitely the one low point of our Vegas trip and afterwards we couldn't stop thinking for days how much we regretted going to CUT, especially when there are so many other great restaurants in Vegas. For a $600 meal, you expect impeccable service and perfectly cooked food. Instead, we had to wait 30 min for cocktails, listen to a manager make up excuses instead of admitting a mistake, and watch my father-in-law eat two wrongly cooked steaks while the rest of us were already finished with our meals. Overall it was a terrible experience and we won't ever be going back."

The atmosphere, experience, food, and wine selection are all on point. The head chef came to our table to see how our meal was, and everyone said it was the best steak they ever had! We had a group of 18 techies who vary in tastes, and not one complaint! The mushrooms topping the steaks are amazingly flavorful and seasoned perfectly. The wine selection covers some of the hardest to find bottles anywhere in the U.S., and literally spending insane money for a steak when there are so many steak options in Vegas,  (did I mention we have been there repeatedly?) makes this my top steak restaurant- hands down. For business or romance, special occasion or high end night out in Sin City- if you want to dine like a high roller and have the best wine and meal, this is well worth the expense!!!!"

I was pretty much all black on the outside and medium in the inside, not tasty at all. I placed an order for my friend who was running late, same steak and his came out looking much better. At this time the bartender/waiter noticed that I was scrapping the char off the steak and informed me if I wanted another one. I told him it was okay since we had go to XS and there would not be enough time. Left about a quarter worth of steak on the plate with most of my sides since it ruined my experience for a last night. Never coming here again.\n\nGood thing we had bottle service at the club, that made the night better."

They bring out the meat so you can see the different types of cut, this is the only restaurant I've seen do this. The ambiance and decor is very modern and trendy and the service is good. You share the sides, and we normally go with a large party so we are able to order mac/cheese (which is the favorite), spinach with egg, mushrooms, and a bunch of others. My favorite appetizer is the tuna tartare. \n\nBe sure to look at the wine list because we ordered 2 $700 bottles of wine thinking they were the regular bottles and not a limited edition one. Most of the desserts are fabulous. Definitely a great steakhouse that offers Kobe beef."

My BF and I had the pleasure of dining at Wolfgang Puck's newbie this last weekend.  It is a spin off of the Beverly Hills location, but a lot easier - at this point- to get a reservation. \n\nThe decor is very modern and sexy, lots of deep purples, black, silver and mirrors- with kind of a rock vibe as they played classic rock all night long. There was a lounge/bar in the opening room of the restaurant, followed by a large open dining room and a smaller space behind a half wall.  The service was superb, there were at least 7 people involved in taking care of our table- server, sommelier, GM, host... the list goes on. Everyone was extremely helpful and you could feel their excitement and anticipation of being apart of a new restaurant. \n\nWithin the first few minutes of sitting down we were brought a selection of breads, homemade and purchased from La Brea bakery- my favorite was the pretzel!  We ordered a bottle of Spanish red Artuzu, which I had never had before, but was surprisingly tasty and affordable. Their wine list was many pages long, for those of you lucky folks who have hit it big and can spend your dough. Soon after, the cuts of meat that were featured for the day were brought to our table for viewing; I never thought big hunks of blood could look so beautiful, but they did.  The menu highlights particular selections from 4 sources, so that one can choose based on palette preference and budget.  The USDA Prime was the least expensive, followed by USDA Prime aged 35 days, American Kobe and 100% Japanese Wagu.  We chose the USDA Prime 34 oz. porterhouse for 2 and were not disappointed. Although my curiosity is killing me about the $80 6 oz. filet : )\n\nAs we waited for our steak and potatoes....we wined, sampled the pork belly appetizer and were given a hot gruyere roll- yumm!  When the entree arrived the steak was cut table side for us. It smelled amazing and was top with fresh thyme for an added effect.  The portion was larger than we expected and divinely cooked- a little pink with no char outside as I had requested. We ate it all!! Unfortunately, that left no room for dessert, so I cannot comment on that. But I was so satisfied it didn't matter.  \n\nThings are great now, and I would go back to CUT, but can only imagine that things will get better as the staff, kitchen and hotel gets more practice."

It was simply one of the best dishes I've ever had anywhere.  Then, we decided to get the porterhouse steak for two.  Caveat.... the waiter told us that we are supposed to order the steak one notch rarer than we normally would like it because they let the steak sit for 10 minutes after its done so it will cook a bit more.  Since the hottie and I are both medium rare people, we ordered the porterhouse rare.  It looked and smelled amazing when the steak finally came to the table!  Truthfully, I thought the steak was kinda in between rare and medium rare.  But the filet mignon portion may have been the best filet mignon I've had.  So tender, so juicy, with a flavorful crisp on the outside.  YUM!  The New York portion was also very good although a bit too rare for me.  We also ordered three sides... creamed spinach, tempura onion rings, yukon potato puree.  I thought they were all ok but nothing to write home about.  All in all, a top notch meal."

I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. \n\nAfter allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! \n\nShortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. \nParmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.\n\nBone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!\n\nSteak Tasting \nAmerican Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!\nUSDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. \nAustralian wagyu from Blackmore -\nWorthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a b\u00e9arnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.\n\nWhite corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish \n\nDessert\nBaked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!\n\nBanana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.\n\nBefore we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! \n\nService was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!\n\nBravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! \n\nYou bet ill be back for an encore! \n\nUntil then...\n\nHappy Eats!"

Eating at Wolfgang restaurants can be cliche as far as what's expected, but Cut is mind blowing for endless reasons. The service was impeccable since Brian, my waiter really worked and expressed his efforts. Although I felt bad since he was seating, he really did try his best. Everyone was extremely attentive. \n\nThe ambiance is very dark/intimate but I also felt a modern office type of vibe. I thought it was rather tacky that there were large framed portfolio head shots around the restaurant of actors such as Brad Pitt. Really threw me off since the concept of the restaurant did not mesh well with those portraits. Who cares ? \n\nThe bar area is very tight, it was too small for my liking. \n\nThe food is ultimately what one should care about. Be warned to throw them Benjamin's for a quick sensation in that mouth that is worth it. As soon as you are, like all Wolf Gang establishments, you are greeted with an assortment of breads. \n\nLooking at the menu may seem daunting but don't stress out, just order something that won't surprise you. There are many cuts of meat that are offered but it would be best to order the Waygu. It's hard to describe through words but wow, it was very tender. It was also a generous cut. \n\nSadly, I was not a fan of paying $2.00 for dressing up the meat aka you get to choose from the following...\n\nHouse Made Steak Sauce       \nWasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter       \nShallot-Red Wine Bordelaise       \nArmagnac & Green Peppercorn       \nArgentinean Chimichurri       \nCreamy Horseradish       \nB\u00e9arnaise  \n\nI was not trying to F up my order by exploring different sauces so I was smart enough to pick something I am familiar with which was the Chimichurri. It went perfectly with the Waygu. If you are on a budget, the U.S.D.A. PRIME, \"Double R Ranch\", Loomis, Washington, Corn Fed, Aged 28 Days New York Sirloin 12 Oz is another good option. \n\nThe side options were not that impressive, as far as the options go. I couldn't go wrong by ordering the Yukon Gold Potato Puree. Yes, this intact did melt in my mouth. Very rich and creamy. \n\nI also recommend the  Maine Lobster, Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp \"Louis\" Cocktail, Spicy Tomato-Horseradish. The combinations of this palter worked really well and the presentation was very impressive. This actually takes a long time for preparation which you will understand why after that first sip. \n\nI don't know if I would return here just because there are too many other restaurant's to experience. I have not a single complaint."

They were extremely attentive of the patrons in the restaurant and served every table with respect and were quick on fulfilling any type of request, water, bread, etc. \nIt saddens me to say, but I wasn't a fan of their steak. Maybe because the server kept emphasizing how deliciously mouth watering melt in your mouth their steak were, that I had it wrapped around my brain that it'll be just that perfect within one bite. However, it was far from it. I had the American Waygu Angus \"kobe style\" steak and Tony had the True Japanese 100% waygu beef. We both thought both steak were good with their sauces (Chimichurri and horseradish) but it wasn't mind blowing.\nHowever, what was surprisingly delicious there was their creamed spinach with fried organic egg. The server brought it out showed us the plate with creamed spinach and one egg cooked sunny side up nestling on top of it, then he excused himself so that he can quietly mix the egg into the spinach. Such an odd combination but it works. It was unbelievably good. I can't emphasize that enough. Their pretzel rolls stood out the most amongst the bread basket. Smear a bit of the three complimentary concentrated mustards over it and you'll have yourself better than ball park east coast pretzel.  \nOverall, like I had stated earlier, their service is phenomenal. However, the food is something we would have to revisit and give another try. But, I don't see it happening anytime soon. So hopefully, if you're there, you'll have a better experience with the food. \n\n\nFYI: The bar and bartender in the front is awesome. The best tasting french martini I have ever had. =)"

Especially, if someone else is paying for it. \n\nPlace is small, help is efficient, but you can detect an air of errogance, and the prices are certainly very high for what you receive. But, it is in Palazzo, and someone has to pay the rent, so it is the general public.\n\nQuality was fair at best. I went with a business group of 8. All ordered steaks. The portions were small. My steak looked the size of what I would usually ask for a doggy bag to bring home to my dogs.\n\nMy former business partner paid for the group. This just prooves that a \"free meal\" doesn't always taste better. \n\nYou can do a lot better than this place. I would not hesitate to suggest Del Frisco's over this place on any day."

I arrived about 15 minutes late and the waiter was still able to get my order in on time, so even though this place is an expensive dining experience, there still not so stuck up to accommodate you.\n\nWe weren't able to get a seat in the restaurant because they couldn't accommodate our size so be careful if you have more than 8 people, you'll likely be sitting in the lounge area. The guy I was sitting next to ordered the Waygu sampler and I received the NY strip from Nebraska, medium rare.\n\nThe steaks were prepared to the right tenderness so no complaints. One strange thing I found is they do a seared crispy steak on top and generously season with Salt. Perhaps some people like it that way, but I wasn't one of them.\n\nAs a steak aficionado, I thought the steak place in the San Francisco bay area to be better. For instance, the waygu at Alexander's was far above the quality of the steak here. But overall, it was still a good experience."

Unfortunately, the food just doesn't get over the finish line and the service, which wasn't bad necessarily, definitely dropped off when the dining room for filled. Steak was good, but I've had better cuts of filet at a lower pricing point (over 100 for the filet), including the filet flight at Guard and Grace in Denver only 48 hours prior.  However, this is Vegas and the restaurant is on the Palazzo so its a bit of apples and oranges comparing.\n\nIt was also quite cold in the dining room.  Noticeably so.

Unfortunately I don't have that kind of money to blow... \n\nCut is expensive and by expensive it's not like your average expensive steakhouse... This here, is not the type of money you can blow on steakhouses unless you won a good amount in the casinos. The cheapest and smallest steak will cost you about $60... High 60s. I don't think I ever got treated to this luxurious fine dining. \n\nTo spear my BF from hundreds of dollars I chose the cheapest cut and style of meat. The filet mignon, age dry to something days from some mid-west state. It was very tender and perfectly cooked. It didn't have much seasoning in it so you can taste just the meat, but they put sea salt on the table and a bunch of mustard. I don't get the mustard... They said it was a Austrian thing. But once you sprinkled some sea salt on, it was excellent. We also had the tuna tartare and it was amazing! Good recommendation by our waitress. \n\nIf you're celebrating something or won big, come to cut for one of the finest aged steak!"

He said it has declined at least 30% since his last visit.\n\nAlright, onto my review.... knowing that many celebs frequent the LA restaurant, and having heard my husband's review.... I was expecting a delicious sophisticated meal at an expensive restaurant.  It was pricey, but none of the other things I had hoped for.\n\nThe martinis we ordered came with a choice of blue cheese, jalapeno, or pimento, I chose blue cheese having had them at a different bar.  The martinis were OKAY.... but after drinking down the vodka, started to smell like vomit.  Not the best way to start my meal.  \n\nThey brought a huge platter of raw meat to our table and began to explain where they were from, etc.  Being a carnivore, I was not turned off by the display of dead animal, but I can see how it might be offensive to some.  We opted for the bone-in filet.\n\nThey came by with a tray of fresh breads and we chose the pretzel and pumpernickel which were fabulous, but cold.  I expected this tray of fresh bread to smell like a bakery and for the warm slices to melt in my mouth... not so much. (however the butter, that they said was from France was room temperature and easy to spread!)\n\nThe sides--\nCavatapi Mac and Cheese was baked with a delicious sharp cheddar, was pure comfort food and worth every calorie.\nCreamed spinach with Organic Egg (not sure if the spinach was organic, but they make a point of saying the EGG is...) good...not great.... but I love anything with an egg over medium....\nFingerling Potatoes with bacon and pearl onions were awesome.  Wish I had them now for breakfast.  Comfort food, thick chunks of bacon and the pearl onions I could eat for days....\n\nOverall service was very efficient but lacked any personality.  They aren't the snobby servers of elite fine dining places, and they aren't the overly helpful staff of.... let's say a casino cafe.  They seem uncomfortable, and in a restaurant that is designed like a dark cafeteria, they need to do something to warm the place up a bit.  The decor was moody and the design pieces well chosen, but I would prefer a little different floor plan for this type of hype.  Every diner should feel like a celebrity in a place that charges $60-$185 a steak.\n\nEnjoyed the food and atmosphere of Craftsteak much more.... but then I guess everyone can have an off day."

I'm not sure if this happens often, but we kept getting free small samples. Our server brought what I think was a small pao de queijo and two pieces of chocolate throughout the dinner, which was really nice/neat of them. We had the golden apple salad, which was refreshing and light. We also ordered the tuna tartare which did not seem very fresh and I would not recommend. While they offer other entrees, their steak selection is glorious. They have wet aged 21 days, dry aged 35 days, cows from all over the country and even from Australia. Personally, I think wagyu beef can taste too gamey so i don't really prefer it as much (I know I am weird). I really love a good bone-in rib eye so that is exactly what I ordered. Because it was wet aged and bone in and prime, it was super greasy and juicy. The meat itself was cooked to perfection. Slightly charred on top and very juicy medium rare prime meat on the inside. I didn't order a side, but I think this is where you should get potatoes to soak up all the juice or you save your bread to eat along with the steak because the meat itself and the juiciness can actually be too much after a while. I ended my meal with the chocolate souffle which was very rich. I really enjoyed my meal here, but I wouldn't name it one of my top favorites only because I didn't really care for much else on the menu. Steak alone great, everything else ehh."

Someone from our party ordered grilled fish, and at table side, the helpman meticulously removed the head, backbone, and proceeded to scrape off the lateral bone bits from the previous fillet' meat. Impressive. So this is a problem, because:\n\n(1) I ordered the 21 day dry aged, bone in Rib Eye medium rare, in a restaurant that is called \"cut\" most likely referring to the expertise of the meat offerings, it came out with a blood pool beneath the meat, and after tearing into the center (after the edge was curiously grey in color) I found a hot pink color, with obviously heavy textured content all the way through. \n\n(2) No one asked me how my food was, nor did anyone personally stop by at our table once the food was presented. \n\n(3) Across the way, my buddies ordered the 35 day, dry aged filet, which upon exposing the centers showed a beautiful purple smooth center, with a red halo ring to a blackened crusted exterior... a proper medium rare, as ordered. Slap in my face for what I got.\n\n(4) Later in the meal, as we were finishing, the waiter dropped by to ask my two buddies with the fiet how the food was. No one asked me how my food was at any part of the meal, and now I was experiencing a shun as the rest of my party was being asked. They handed me a check for the menu price of $65.\n\nDon't talk to me about that I didn't say anything, or that \"how are they supposed to know?\", I've never had the $100 steak, but if you charge me 4 times what I can get at Applebees, I shouldn't have to bring it to your attention, just like if I can't afford this place I shouldn't have to ask how much it is before I sit down. $65 is not an assumption. It's a statement.\n\n I go to restaurants because I can't grill a proper medium rare myself. That is my statement. That $65 price tag, that's your promise you know what you're doing."

Appies:  Steak Tartare, Butter Lettuce Avocado Salad and Big Eye Tuna (there were more I just lost consciousness after those).\n\nMeat - most of us had the American Waygu.  Amazing meat and cooked to perfection.  The sauces we ordered were a very nice addition to the meat.  Might want to just order a few as the flavors tend to get lost in the party.\n\nLastly, we had just about every dessert.  The Fuji Apple and the Strawberry shortcake were my favorites.  Hats off to the Chocolate Souffle as well - cooked to order and was spot on.  The service by our waiter along with Marino could not be matched.  I have dined at all of the Puck properties and this rates in the top 3 - maybe top 2.  Bring your wallet or expense account because perfection does have a pricetag.  If you are going to eat a fine meat meal once a year - this is the place regardless of the price."

I was also surprised that the presentation was not better.  We essentially got a steak on a big white plate.  Sides came in a white bowl.  Was surprised to have to pay for water for the table, but was the cheapest part of the meal :)  Food was pretty good, but I wouldn't say it was the best steak I've ever had.  Tuna tartare appetizer was phenomenal.\n\nService was outstanding, probably the best I've ever had.  They brought a wrong side, and gave it to us free, and quickly brought out what we had ordered.\n\nSo you have idea of price....it ended up being nearly $500 for two people, including a $120 bottle of wine, one appetizer, two steaks, two sides, two bottles of water, and $75 tip.  No dessert."

Got the 20 bone in Rib-eye, Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp \"Louis\" Cocktail, Big Eye Tuna Tartare, Wild Field Mushrooms & Japanese Shishito Peppers, Artichoke side dish, fingerling potato side dish, and veal tongue starter.  \n\nThe steak was cooked just right and tasted great.  Note, there wasn't any salt or pepper on the table and we didn't need it.  The cocktail was a creamy dish no cocktail sauce in this dish.  So if you like creamy, this was an excellent starter.   The tongue was like butter, melted in your mouth quality.  Very good.   Tartare was served with thinly sliced avocado on top.  There was a wasabi sauce along with some thinly sliced toasted bread.  The presentation was beautiful.  Sliced radish/cucumber on one corner of the square plate, wasabi on another, ginger and some kind of sprout on the other corner.  A lot of tastes in this one dish.  Mushroom dish was very tasty.  Don't know what type of mushrooms but they went well with the peppers.  Potato dish had nicely caramelized potatoes and some pieces of nicely caramelized fatty pork.  Nothing special about the artichoke dish.  Overall, we had an excellent meal.  Service was great.  I definitely will go back.  The bill was $226 for three people."

I was hoping they'd take it off the bill, since it was way overcooked, but they didn't.  When I'm paying $300+ for two people, you'd think they credit you for something you had to send back.  Other than my husband's over-dead steak (for which we have to dock them 1 star), everything else was on point.  We had a killer table, and the staff was exceptional.  My steak was like butter, our two appies (pork belly, asparagus) were incredibly tasty, and the bread... Oh the bread!!  (my mouth waters thinking about it).  Oh, and our drinks... I sucked down TWO Samurai Swords (with a hand-picked chunk of proper ice); well worth the $25 each.  Even though my husband's steak was sub-par, we'd probably still come back in the future.

I've been to a few high end steak houses(Maestro, Mortons, Flemings, Ruth Chris, Delmonico) and the cut I had is by far the most unique flavor I've ever tasted.  The outside had the perfect charred crisp, and the inside was perfection.  The texture was so different from other Rib Eye's I've tasted.  The inside had the consistency and texture of Sushi.  It was delicate and chewy, and would melt in your mouth.\n\nThis might be strange the way I'm reviewing the steak here, but its the only way I can describe it.  Its the best steak, in terms of texture, that I've ever had.  The sides were OK, but nothing to wow about.  I'd recommend saving $$$ by not ordering sides, and just order a larger sized cut.  Had a nice bold Cab to go along w/ the steak which only enhanced the experience even further.\n\nThe service was what you'd expect from a high end establishment.  Didn't have any problems, and the timing of the entree's were on the dot.  The decor is more contemporary and sleek, which isn't what you'd expect.  It was very nice inside, but didn't really match the food that they were serving.  Can't really explain it, just go and check it out yourself.\n\nOverall, I'd come back again.  Well worth the $."

It's so completely overpriced and waaaay too much beef for one person to eat. The two best things I had on their menu weren't even their \"dry aged a million years\" steaks. It was the chicken and Kobe Steak Sashimi. I could eat those two things everyday for a year. \n\nIf you're debating between the regular steak and Wagyu, spend the extra money. You can absolutely taste the difference. But both are not worth the money you'll spend here. I honest-to-god feel like I've had better steak at Morton's - tastier, more tender, way better value.\n\nIf I could have a re-do at this place I would've ordered family style.

My other friends got steak to themselves and none could finish it. So if you're super hungry, you will get your food worth.

Cozy, warm and elegant settings set up a fantastic first impression of an exquisite high-end meal to come.\n\nStarters:\n\nGlasses of Red wine\n\nBread basket: a variety (4 or 5) different types to choose from.   Breadsticks, Focaccia, pretzel bread, and more.\n\nHot Goug\u00e8res - addicting warm gruyere cheese puff pastries.  We wanted more but thought it would be wise to save our stomachs for the rest of the dinner.\n\nAustrian Oxtail Bouillon - with chive blossoms, chervil, and bone marrow dumplings - delicious dumplings with tender oxtail,  just enough to stimulate the gastric juices for a hearty steak.\n\nMain Entree':\n\n20 oz Bone In Rib Eye Steak - aged 21 days and IL corn fed beef.  This steak's grilled over hard wood and charcoal then finished over a 1200 degree broiler.  This giant slab of rich, but \"uneven\" marbled rib chop with a thin layer of char and sear - juicy but not as tender (medium rare).  An above average steak but not blown away.  American Waygu or the True Japanese 100% Waygu Beef may have been a better choice, albeit at double the price.\n\nSide Items:\n\nCavatappi Pasta Mac n' Cheese - as the server approached our table, he stumbled and DUMPED the mac n cheese all over the table, splattering bits and pieces of the hot plate on my suit and her dress.  The manager apologized and proceeded to clean up the mess and scolded the server*.  The second serving came 10 minutes later, piping hot.  A great side item to have minus wearing it as part of the attire.\n\nCream Spinach with Fried Organic Egg - Creamy but not much different from other restaurants.  Not certain the egg really added that wow factor.\n\nDessert:\n\nApple Stuffed Pumpkin Doughnuts with Maple Whipped Cream and Pumpkin Gelato- before ordering dessert, we asked if these doughnuts were dense or more airy like a beignet.  The server hesitated and said \"yes, they are light and fluffy like a beignet\".  WRONG!  these were very dense and heavy.  Bad information and though tasty, it definitely not what we wanted.  Our feedback to him about misinformation didn't go far.\n\nAt the end, they comped the dessert for poor server performance.   They didn't do anything for an impending dry cleaning bill though.   No second visit planned for the future.\n_____________________________\n*Not clear if he was the manager but we did overhear him burn the server in the kitchen, \"you f&#$%n idiot!\".  I expected to be comped more than just a measly dessert but alas a $180+ meal would be too much for them to bear?"

The meat was so tender and so fatty - it was unbelievably delicious.  At first, I could not imagine what type of meat would cost $160 for 6oz, but one bite of this completely blew me away.  A few more bites of this filled me up, as the meat was so rich.  Luckily, my boyfriend had the traditional USDA Prime Ribeye 16oz so we shared our meats.  For those who has no one to share with, I would recommend the tasting menu (Japanese Wagyu From Kagoshima Prefecture 2 Oz, American \"Kobe Style\" From Snake River Farms 4 Oz, U.S.D.A. PRIME Dry Age From Nebraska 4 Oz) so you have a sampling of all 3 levels of meats and you will not be overwhelmed by the Wagyu.  \n\nThe quality of the meats was great, and obviously this was a very expensive meal.  Without any appetizers, wine, sides, or dessert, our bill came out to be almost $300.  Oh, they also bring around a bread basket in the beginning, and you have the option of many many different types of breads.  They were all delicious!  There was also some complimentary dessert and they were just as amazing.\n\nOverall, this was a great dining experience.  I've been to quite a good number of steakhouses, and this is my favorite so far.  I plan to come back here again and also visit the one in Beverly Hills since I'm from LA.  Oh, I dont remember why we didnt have wine but please make sure you have some with your steak."

Fires, whipped potatoes, excellent mac and cheese, and an off the menu selection that our server informed of us......asparagus(it was great!). A friend in our group is/was a newbie to the whole Vegas Steakhouse experience, so I gave him a few pointers. I've read that Cut seems to over season  the steaks and puts a big too much temperature on them. So, order the steak with \"light seasoning\". Mine was cooked medium rare. While it was a good steak, the seasoning forms a bit of a tough crust, combined with somewhat dull steak knives, the first cut was a bit of a disappointment. \n\nFor desert,  the group split the chocolate souffle, which was excellent and served with a sweet cream and caramel. \n\nSo, why the three stars? I get the ambiance angle, I really do. Its Vegas, its an experience, I have no problem paying that the Vegas rate for a steak is.

Should you be so brave as to go in a large group, I recommend placing one person in charge of communicating with one waiter, after everybody orders initially. \n\nAmbiance & Decor: It was dark and I was way too hungry to take note of it and to care.\n\nSummary:\n\nFood: Steak. \nService: Get it together, people. \nAmbiance & Decor: Hungry people don't care. \n\nI would not recommend the experience of eating here in a large group, but if you do, please make sure you have effective communication with the wait staff."

            "review": "So the BF was in Vegas for the first time for his birthday and he picked CUT as his expensive steakhouse dinner.  We were not disappointed.  Wolfgang Puck figured it out with this place.\n\nFirst off, love the atmosphere in here.  Clean lines, dark but not too dark lighting, and they had some good tunes going.  Mostly classic rock but interspersed with a few more recent rock songs.  I was glad it wasn't boom boom boom techno for once.\n\nWe were immediately seated when we arrived and things started happing in rapid fire succession.  Bread was brought to the table.  The waiter took drink orders, recommended wine, and went through the menu.  Someone else brought an amuse bouche.  It was a bit overwhelming overload there for a bit but all for a good cause - to get us food and booze!\n\nWe started with the bread.  There were some crispy bread pieces covered in cheese, maybe Parmesan?  It was so good we ate all of it.  Then we started with the maple glazed pork belly with Asian spices, sesame orange dressing, and apple compote.  4 pieces of decadent, amazing pork belly perfectly offset with sweetness from the apple.  We LOVED this.  We also tried the shrimp and crab (or was it lobster) cocktail which had a creamy sauce holding it all together.  I'm not much for creamy sauces so that's a personal preference, but it was still very good.\n\nSo they bring out the steak cuts and show them to you and explain the differences.  I had already decided in my head on one thing but after hearing about the Wagyu steaks from the USA and Australia there was only one way to go: the tasting that included 4 oz USDA PRIME aged 35 days steak, 4 oz American Wagyu \"Kobe Style\", and 2 oz Australian Wagyu.  I just couldn't resist trying each of them against the other and deciding if they were really all that.  We ordered them up medium rare with sides of parmesan polenta and creamed spinach with fried egg.  The tasting came with sauces for each steak.\nUSDA Prime aged 35 days: really good steak but harder to cut because of the marbling.  I didn't eat all of this one because I wanted to focus on the other 2 cuts.\nAmerican wagyu: at first, this one was my favorite.  It was buttery smooth with a great flavor.\nAustralian Wagyu: this one was even more rich and buttery in flavor and soon became my absolute favorite of the three.  i finished all of it.  Probably the best steak I have ever had in my life ever...including at my favorite steakhouse in Dallas.  Next time I believe I'll just fork out the cash for this cut alone.\nCreamed spinach: good, fried egg made it different than the usual, but just good, not mind blowing.\nPolenta: perfectly cooked, cheesy, great side for the steaks.\n\nFor dessert the BF ordered some sort of table side crumble that came with market fresh peaches and blackberries in it  I don't know what it was called but all I know is that I have never had fruit that fresh and sweet and delicious.  Not a single blackberry was sour, the peaches tasted like they came straight off the tree.  It was an amazing dessert.  They also sent out a baked Alaska for the BF's b-day gratis and it said \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate on the plate.  Fun.\n\nThe price is commensurate with the quality food you are getting which means this shit isn't cheap.  But it is worth it.  I left here stuffed and happy and pleased that the $$$ spent matched the enjoyment had.  Give this steak a try, you will not be disappointed."

            "review": "I love CUT so much. I could probably end this review there, but its heavenly goodness deserves an actual descriptor.\n\nI practically, and sort of literally, live in Las Vegas and this is one of my family's go-tos for our joint favorite meal: steak.  They serve excellent quality meat and good preparation.  Sometimes I look at my own pictures and drool a little because I remember how fantastic the marbling is.  And what's more, there's a cut for everyone.  I love the Illinois corn fed rib eye because it tastes like cow, and my father loves the softer Wagyu style, among others.  We've tried most of the steaks on the menu, and I've never been disappointed before.\n\nAs if that were't enough for me, I like everything before and after the steak, too.  The pretzels are pretty much fantastic, especially with the assorted mustards (the other breads are good, too).  Heirloom tomato salad was great when it was on the menu, but there are a lot of other good choices too, like the warm asparagus that I love so much.  The sides are admittedly not CUT's strongest point, but it's not so bad and frankly, they're really not important.  If you care that much about sides, you may want to go somewhere that actually plates your steak.  Here they serve it to you as it is: solitary in its meaty glory.\n\nDessert is surprisingly strong here, too.  Last I went, we ordered a souffle, baked alaska, banana cream pie, AND a warm berry cobbler.  Everything was good.  I ate to a point of serious discomfort because I couldn't stop.  It was too good.  Admittedly the souffle was sort of standard fare for a \"good\" chocolate souffle, but everything was clearly very, very good. Very.  I would be hardpressed to pick a favorite.\n\nAll in all, if you can afford the price, go. Get a wine pairing or a cocktail. It's all good."

They did not disappoint! On the phone they took our info and asked if we were celebrating anything special. SO we had the best seat in the restaurant. Special round booth facing the crowd. We were in our special area which made it extra nice. THe ambiance and decor was modern- hip. They were playing tribe called quest... its like they knew we were there. lol.. anyway... our attendees always checked on us, refilled our water, replenished our bread and butter ( I chose the pretzel bread- yummy!). \nService was great! \n\nBeing on a budget we skipped out on the starters and went for cocktails instead. We got 2 Moscow mules which was impressive and served in copper cans. \n\nMy husband got the 20 oz bone in rib eye aged 21 days- medium rare\nI got the 16 oz rib eye Nebraska corn fed 35 days- medium well\nOur sides were creamed spinach with egg on top, yukon gold mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese with a fancy name I cant recall right now. \n\nAll were amazing. We also ordered the house steak sauce for $2. It went very well with the steak but didnt use it too much because honestly it was seasoned to perfection already. \n\nThere was a big difference between the 21 and 35 days. The 35 days was obviously more tender but my husband still enjoyed his bone in. \n\nAt the end, we got a complimentary desert strawberry shortcake served on a dish that had \"happy anniversary\" written on it. WHAA WHA WHA. It was nice!\nOverall, had a great experience, great staff and service!!!"

That said, we had a large party and required 2 tables side by side so this is understandable. Actual service at table was good, not great. 4 stars. \n\nFood: everyone got beef and everyone was VERY underwhelmed with the quality. The cheapest steak on the menu is ~$55 (a la carte) and they were fairly grisly, and honestly didn't taste all that good. For that amount of money, I should be able to cut my steak with a fork. The appetizers were good, not great.  Sides were also good. 2.5-3 stars\n\nOverall: save yourself the time and money. I've been to many very, very good/nice restaurants on both coasts, and I am completely happy spending $230 on a meal, but this was absolutely not worth it.

You definitely don't get that feeling at CUT. \nCUT was pretty obnoxious in their service, clumsy, and timing was way off, almost like we were putting them out.\nCocktails are skimpy and overpriced!\nWine list has many very expensive choices but only one or two moderately priced wines. \nSide dishes were good.\nThe final LOL, was with the check they brought out a complimentary mini tray of 3 mini bite-size cookies for the 4 of us..

            "review": "This Thanksgiving Season, I have much to be thankful for.  Sadly, my 11/22 anniversary celebration at Cut Steakhouse is NOT on that list.  To begin, despite a reservation made one month earlier, and verbal/telephone confirmation with hostess 2 days prior to my arrival at Palazzo, we waited well past our reservation time, while a table was setup, WAY in the back of the restaurant.  I realize  this group of Asians bear no resemblance to Daniel Craig nor Giselle Bundchen, but our dollar bills are still honored just the same by US Treasury.  \n\nOur waiter, Richard, was condescending and unhelpful, with comments such as \"For those of you who have never had USDA Prime meat before\", to \"That's ALL you are having?\".  I wonder where/how Rich acquired such superb profiling skills so as to allow him to so quickly form such conclusion within minutes of meeting our group, or if such comments are designed to \"upsell\".  Or did he assume we are all vegans, judging from our group's lithe physique?  Haha.  Either case, I personally find it deeply offensive.\n\nLastly, my $140 10oz American Wagyu (4 oz prime, 4 oz Wagyu, 2 oz kobe) was definitely not USDA Prime A5 so loudly proclaimed by our waiter.  The prime was chewy.  the Wagyu was full of veins.  The 2 oz kobe was the only tasty item on my selection.  (Caesar and onion rings were quite good though).\n\nIn summary, other than being assigned a terrible table despite 30 days advance reservation; dealing with a condescending waiter; and eating mediocre steak for an exorbitant price, I thought the lighting was exceptionally romantic!   \n\nBottom line, I have had better.  Very disappointed!"

For our steaks it was hard to pick just one (which by the way, they do a tasting of 3 as well...which would be smart if you have never had wagyu before, totally worth it). He had the filet and I had the new york sirloin of their American Wagyu Beef from Snake River Farms Idaho. AMAZING!!!

Our reservation for 7 was for 7:30p but when I stopped in at the restaurant to check in at 6:30, I was told that our table was ready anytime we were.  Good thing, as this was quite the leisurely meal, we soon found out. \n\nWe were seated at the farthest table in the corner of the room. The seating arrangement worked nicely, although I nearly took out a waiter and a patron as the hostess attempted to make conversation over her shoulder with me, while whisking us through the restaurant.  \n\nOur servers introduced themselves to us and asked about drinks.   We requested a wine list and started to peruse the menu.  Shortly thereafter, we received the explanation of the beefs cuts and what we could expect to taste, as well as how their meats were prepared.  This should have been my first clue for my own meal.  \n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity(nearly a half hour), our waiter returned to collect drink orders.  3 glasses of red wine (2 cab, 1 pinot), a beer, and 3 waters.   We waited 10-15 minutes for those to arrive, and then went about ordering our food.  Once ordered, we received breads - oooooh so delicious(I'm sure you've read about them here on other reviews)!   Breadsticks on the table proved to be messy to eat, as parmesan flaked everywhere.    \n\nWe ordered a few appetizers including the beet salad, apple salad, and butter lettuce salad, pork belly, and the maryland blue crab & shrimp cocktail.   Each were delicious and stood soundly with excellent flavor and texture. \n\nOur group ordered all different cuts of beef, including the PRIME porthouse for 2, petit cut filet, and more.  For 7 people, we also ordered 4 side dishes - 2 potato puree and 2 mac & cheese. \n\nThis is where things started to fail.  \n\nThe meals were served to the wrong diners, to start.  Once the first plate was incorrectly set down, the rest of the team of servers failed.. including one server who set down my \"pork\" in front of me, which was not pork, but Bone in Rib Eye.   What??  ugh.   From there, there was some swapping of plates and a quick discussion of what went where.  Chaos. \n\nThe sides were then served to each diner.  I'm not certain about you, but I like more than a tablespoon of potatoes when I'm served a 20oz Rib Eye.    That's all that was available, though, so we made do.  The potatoes tasted delicious, as did the mac & cheese, which was stringy and difficult for the waiter to serve. \n\nThe kitchen seems to have a problem cooking their meat to the correct temperature.  The petit filet my friend ordered medium, was rare in the middle. I know this is an easy thing to have happen to filet.. but this is CUT.  A $52 piece of meat should be prepared correctly!   \n\nMy Rib Eye? Wow.. very sad.  I had to physically SAW THROUGH the char on the steak to get a piece that was not hard and crusted over, and overseasoned.   I'm not a fan of charred meat to begin with but a light char on this piece would have been appropriate.   I was sad to have to leave hunks of  meat behind because they were too tough to even cut through, despite having paid $64. \n\nThe Porterhouse for two, for the bride and groom, was cooked inconsistently as well, even though it was ordered medium... one side was rare and the other medium/medium-well.\n\nWith three diners only drinking water, one would think that the servers would be attentive to their glasses and watch for empty.  Heck, we've seen better service at Applebees when it comes to water.  My husband is a stickler for having a drink at all times, and the service here was an epic fail in that department.  It was so random, the servers would come by, fill up one water glass and neglect two others on the table.  I expected that they ran out of water, but no.. they just moved on to another table and poured more water for another patron.  What the heck?\n\nBy the end of our meal, we'd lost a server completely (hadn't seen him in quite a while), and the other, more jovial one, was notified that we were disappointed that they couldn't keep glasses filled, and that the service was lacking.  \nI've eaten at numerous high end places in my day.. this is not one we'll be returning to, sadly.  I have found other steakhouses in Vegas to be as comparably priced with excellent cuts of meat and far better service. \n\nWe were seated at our table at 6:30p.  We finally left around 9:30p.  While I'm glad they didn't rush us through, I can now see why they didn't have a reason to."

The service is second to none, and the food is excellent. If you are looking at prices, this is not the place for you, but if you are looking to splurge a little and have an excellent experience, get after it!  My GF and I shared an appetizer, a steak, and a dessert because we knew we would not finish our own, and we had one of the best dining experiences we could have imagined.  The wait staff is very polite and will not rush you through a meal like many others do. \n\n*Note, if you like Ruth's Chris, you may not like this place because the meat tastes like beef instead of butter. If prime rib is your favorite, this is probably not for you, but if you like a real steak, this is the place to be. \n\nThe beef is always perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. I would not recommend getting anything that is cooked more than medium rare because they may not know how to do that. Real steak should be eaten rare to medium rare... not medium or well. \n\nAlso, we had the most memorable dessert ever. It was a baked alaska as recommended by our waiter. \n\nI walked out of here wanting more and I can't wait until the next time i get to put that succulent piece of red meat into my mouth!\n\nTry the bone marrow appetizer. it is to die for!"

We were presented a bread plate, though it was fresh and tasted great with the butter and grey salt, it was cold. I forgot about it once I took a bite of the pretzel bread. Then we had the Kobe Steak Sashimi.......simplicity, single most sexiest thing I've ever eaten. The main course, Wagyu Porterhouse, Nebraska Rib-eye and Porterhouse. It was charred, cooked rare, finished with sea salt and garlic butter. Both the porterhouses were grassy, a bit gamey and melted like butter. I couldn't believe what I was eating since we had a bad experience at SW last time we were in Vegas, and that was a joke. \n\nThen came the service. In a city run by restaurants, hospitality is what sets them apart. At CUT it sets apart from the world. I don't even know where to start, but having your own busser doesn't hurt nor having a hot plate presented at the same time with 9 other runners. \n\nHands-down the best hospitality I've ever received and one of the best eating experiences in my life."

Overall, was not disappointed at all.  I started with the tuna tartare appetizer and it was really delicious.  Ultra fresh chopped tuna, topped with some thinly sliced avocado and pressed into a circular mold.  Not sure what exactly the sauce drizzled about the plate was but, it matched the tuna perfectly.  As I sampled tastes from everyone else's plates, it was clear that all the dishes were very well conceived.\n\nThere are a number of aged cuts of prime beef from a variety of sources.  I chose a 28 day (I think!) dry aged NY Strip from Nebraska.  While it was very flavorful, this is where the .5 knockdown comes.  Just a wee bit past the medium rare I ordered.  At these prices and with Wolfgang Puck's name attached one certainly expects absolute perfection and this was a very slight misstep.  Normally, I would have sent it back but, we  were trying to make a 9:30 show so, that was not an option.\n\nOverall, I would not hesitate to return although I think next trip, I'll keep trying some of the other pricey steak joints in Vegas.  What the hey.... I like variety!"

            "review": "For a highly rated restaurant and supposedly one of the top steakhouses in the area, this place really fell short for me. Everything was underwhelming, from checking in to the food. First impressions are everything. The hostess did not greet us when we walked in. Instead we awkwardly stood in front of her for awhile and told her we had a reservation. Maybe I'm being picky but since this is a nicer restaurant I would have expected her to acknowledge that we were here to celebrate a special occasion (which we noted on our reservation). But nope, no acknowledgement. \n\nThe ambiance was kind of interesting. It's dimly lit but has a \"business meeting\" feel to it, especially with the swivel chairs (which I'm not sure I like at a restaurant...). Nothing romantic or date-like about this place at all. \n\nFor food they start you off with different types of bread. The first is a stick bread with parmesan--not bad but very flaky and you will get crumbs everywhere. Next you get to choose 2 from an assortment of bread they bring out. I don't recall the names of all of them but the pretzel bread was my favorite. They also brought out a 3rd one which looked like it should've been flaky but was actually very soft when you bite into it. \n\nFor our meal, we ordered the bone marrow flan appetizer, the bone in 20oz ribeye cooked medium rare, and a side of creamed spinach with egg. The bone marrow was really good. The plate comes with a marrow, capers, and little pieces of toasted bread. Very delicious when you put them together to eat as a toast/sandwich. The ribeye, which should've been the star of the meal, was very disappointing. Their style of cooking here is to sear the outside of the meat so that it looks almost black. Unfortunately, the sear caused the meat to be tough and dry. Since when are medium rare steaks supposed to come out dry and without ANY juice coming out? It might be telling that they also bring out an assortment of mustards/sauces for you to enjoy along with your steak. Perhaps to mask the intense sear?? The creamed spinach was also a disappointment. Insanely small portion (and these are meant to be shared???) and the egg is just mushed up into it. Nothing special.\n\nOverall, my husband and I were very disappointed in our meal. I had high expectations for this place and this place fell very short. If you like your meat seared until it's black, then maybe you would enjoy this restaurant. Otherwise I would suggest you go spend your money someplace else."

I've been to hole-in-the-walls where the decor & presentation of the food don't do the taste justice. Unfortunately, CUT is quite anti-climatic as the taste doesn't measure up to its fancy decors and delicate presentations. \n\nWhen I walked into the restaurant I was immediately impressed by its edgy and modern atmosphere, and was prepared for a 5-star dining experience. The food was expensive and I felt like I was paying more for the \"looks\" than the food itself. I ordered a medium-well petite filet mignon but turned out to be well-overcooked. My friend ordered a medium filet but it was more cooked than her liking so she sent it back. But when her second steak came, it was medium, closer to medium-rare, and the middle part was cold. She didn't finish her steak. \n\nPositives - I have to say service was great. When my friend sent back her steak they didn't try to push back and didn't charge us for the new steak. Also, the bread here is amazing.\n\nOverall, I don't think CUT is as good as some of the other steakhouses for the price, bu it definitely looks nicer."

Our server suggested some good wine pairings, and I enjoyed my Merlot. I think the wine was the only thing I was satisfied with after my meal.\n\nService was (for the most part) decent. The manager was nice and took care of the steaks for us. However, I would have been willing / would rather have paid good money to eat some good steak.\n\nHowever, I would highly advise you to spend your money elsewhere.\nHeck, even a TV dinner steak would have been better than this mess.\n\nTry going to Craftsteak or one of the other upscale steak establishments in Vegas instead - there are much better options for premium steak where you'll actually be able to chew what you order."

            "review": "Came here for the final night of my vacation in Vegas.  My friend is a huge steak person as I am not.  But I did inquire a little around town and found out there are pretty much 3 steak houses to visit on the strip - Cut @ Palazzo, Craftsteak @ MGM and surprise! steak house @ Circus Circus.  Originally I booked my reservation @ Craftsteak considering we had a 9:30PM Ka show, but after reading a bit more reviews and have been @ Craftsteak, I decided we should try out CUT.  (Switch @ Encore which is where we were staying was also considered, but after seeing the reviews we passed, I still would like to try it next time)\n\nThe four star rating is for the overall dining experience.  I would say the ambiance and service @ CUT deserves a full 5 star.  Our waitress DEFINITELY knew her stuff.  The restaurant is very nicely appointed, dark decorations but doesn't feel too uptight like the old steak houses in NY.  It has a nice modern feel to it.  We got seated by the door in a very comfortable booth area.  Waitress came by and explained EVERYTHING on the menu including the wine/drinks which came on an iPad.  She was the reason why I feel this restaurant deserved the outrageous bill that came at the end (more on that later).\n\nBeing a steak house, the main thing is the meat itself.  And this restaurant has some of the best selections.  The shining star is Australian and American Waygus/Kobe.  Basically skip all the USDA crap and go straight to those selections, you would not regret it.  You do indeed pay for what you get, my friend ordered a 6oz Australian Waygu NY strip while I had the 6oz American Waygu Filet Mignon.  6oz may seem like a small size, but trust me you would not need more, I could not finish 1/2 of mine.  The Australian Waygu definitely was the most buttery steak I have ever tasted, every bite feels like you are going to pass out from just biting into it.\n\nAll of the side items are a-la-carte, and they add to your bill exponentially.  The best is definitely the wild mushroom add on.  We also ordered a few other items - Cauliflower (definitely recommended, yum!), creamed spinach with poached eggs (I wasn't a huge fan) and gold yukon potato puree (pretty good mashed potatoes but nothing to write home about)  We finished the meal with a banana cream pie/ice cream rendition, it was good, but not exceptional.  It could be however at that point I was pretty much passed out for a food coma.  The food was tiny in amount but felt so very rich that I couldn't take another bite.  i also felt that the sauces (we had chimi churri and wasabi) were too salty since the steaks were already flavored with fleur-de-sel (which they also brought to the table, a very nice touch).  It was just too much of a good thing in this case I think.  The food was simply too rich for my taste, which is one of the reasons I docked 1 star from this otherwise amazing establishment.\n\nThe other reason I took off 1 star is the price.  I have been to some outlandishly expensive restaurants, but this place is not French Laundry :)  The bill for 2 came out to be around $480 (including tip), with just 1 glass of wine.  Was the steak good?  Absolutely.  Was it $480 good?  That one I have to think for a bit and I think the answer is probably no.  So if you do decide to go, be choosy on the side items and add-ons you wish to have, because they do add up very quickly.  Also ask the waitress for how the sides accompany the overall palette, I have a feeling if I do ever go back again, I will be choosing SOMETHING that's lighter so it can offset the richness of the other parts of the plate.\n\nIn summary, to finish off a very long review, I would come here if you are a steak fanatic and have a bit of money to drop.  It's like everything in vegas, you can do it on the cheap OR outlandishly over the top.  You can guess how this one fits :)"

From the service to the food, to the ambiance and the servers attitude our dinner experience couldn't have been better.  \n\nIt was New Years' Eve night and we got in early to the restaurant. Got seating in the bar area, which was perfect for us, we enjoy people watching as entertainment with our meal. And there was plenty interesting ones to watch that night.\n\nThe service was prompt and not the typical stuck up manner found in the old school steakhouses, but easy going, polite and humorous.  \n\nWe shared the generous portion of the Porter Wagyu and ordered a couple of starters (they are quite petite in portion) and sides.   True to the reputation of a great steakhouse, the Porter Cut meat was tender, juicy, and just right - medium rare. It's buttery and tasty. I could almost say that it melts in my mouth, but then not really :) you still have to chew the meat a little. It is after all, meat, not ice cream.\n\nTo close the menu I chose the Chocolate Souffle. My review on that is: Ooohhhhh YUMMMMMMMM....~ *insert food-gasm here*\n\nHave I had better chocolate souffle? I don't think so. Not yet. So for now, CUT has the crown. We scraped clean the souffle in 5 minutes top!!  Not to worry, the second night we were there, I savored it longer.

If you're going to drop $250 on a dinner for two, this is how to do it.  \n\nSteaks are not easy to make well, and even the finest steakhouses can't always guarantee a flawlessly cooked steak.  But my bone-in ribeye was flawless--nice and fatty and tender with excellent seasoning and flavor.  Even better was my wife's petit New York, which was tender and rich and meaty.  Never thought a New York could beat a ribeye, but I stand corrected.  The sauces were also good, but if you're a real steak lover, you don't need them.  The steaks stand their ground on their own.\n\nAppetizers and sides were also knock-out good.  We ordered a burrata and prosciutto dish that was soft and flavorful, and a bone marrow flan appetizer that was meaty and rich and light, all at once.  Delicious.  For sides, we got the spinach and garlic--nicely done, with lightly seasoned spinach that's cooked, not wilted--and the fingerling potatoes, which came sauteed with delicious bits of roasted garlic and chunks of thick-cut bacon.\n\nService was also very competent, if just slightly on the overeager side.  Our waitress (Tara) was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable--she could probably teach a class on the marbleing of Wagyu beef.  She stopped by often to chit chat and check in, which was nice, but we would have liked just a bit more privacy.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic experience.  Among the top three steaks I've ever had, and very possibly the best."

We happened to be walking by to eat at different restaurant and just stopped in to see if they had open seats - which they found for us after a few minutes - but I'd imagine that this is not the norm.  Collared shirts and nice jeans / slacks are standard wear, but since this is Vegas, there were several people in t-shirts and shorts.\n\nEach table had two waiters to keep us satisfied.  They would recommend specific cuts of meat and sides to go with what we were looking for, and not just the most expensive items on the menu.  When the meat came out it was on a plate by itself; an impressive reminder of what was the main point of this meal.  The sides were scooped out afterward by the waiters onto our plates as they described all of the ingredients that went in to making that dish.\n\nDidn't make it to dessert, but they let us take away some of the food we didn't finish, which made for a delicious snack after a night out.\n\nHigh Points: Grab two or three friends so you can share side dishes and appetizers.  They're delicious, rich, and you'll want to sample all of them, so go with a group and try a bit of each.  Even the lesser-priced cuts of meat are still phenomenal; I can only imagine what the Wagyu steaks are like.  Try the mac & cheese; it'll blow your mind.  Creamed spinach was also very good.\n\nLow Points: Your meal will be over $100 without trying very hard.  The corn side dish was nothing remarkable; avoid it in favor of tastier sides."

The detractors were fairly few, but I'll call them out right here.  1, the wine list, though fairly extensive, had unreasonable pricing on the lower end bottles.  I understand the mark-up system, but there should be a more reasonable option for those who need it.  2, the cheese plate was not good.  It was not balanced, and just needed a little fixer to be right.\n\nThe bad news out of the way, it was a tasty place to dine when you're craving red meat.  I had the bone marrow flan appetizer, which was rich, buttery and flavorful.  The presentation was also very nice.  My main was the Indian spiced short ribs. I had a major mental disconnect on this. Beef and Indian spices?  Seriously, isn't Shiva going to rain fire down for this?  Well, if she does, it would be a pity, as the flavors were wonderful. The texture was perfect.  I also tried the lamb chops which were juicy, flavorful, etc.  Another person at my table had the new york, and it was also excellent. It had a good char, deep flavor, and was properly cooked. The other people at the table I was at actually requested to have their meat fired again, as their definition of steakhouse medium was actually a proper steakhouse medium well, but I wouldn't fault the restaurant for their preference for meat, which in my opinion is over cooked.  The restaurant was very accomodating to their needs, and provided excellent service."

There's all these different types of beef which the waiter carries out in his arm to show you (while in his Armani-looking pin striped suit of course).  He does a pretty good job explaining the differences and qualities of the beefs.  I don't remember how much my specific steak cost, but I'm sure it was expensive and whatever the price tag was, i'm quite sure it was worth every dollar.  The ambience was dark and had some blue strobe lights if i can recall correctly.  Almost like a stripper joint, except without the poles and 100x classier!  All I can say is, I had a blast, and If I were to go to Vegas again, I would damn well make sure to stop by and eat here again.

I'll comment upon a cost based rating below.\n\n\nThe food was quite good and well prepared as one might reasonably expect from an establishment at the Palazzo/Venetian. Considering that even the Grand Lux Cafe delivers above average fare with great execution at moderate prices, one would expect no less at Cut. The steaks were all prepared at the desired wellness (in this case, all medium rare) and were sufficiently rested prior to being served so that the juices did not run all over the plate upon slicing into the steak.\n\nThere was a dizzying array of cuts and types of beef offered, from prime grade domestic beef (aged for varying durations) to domestic wagyu (oxymoron?) to New Zealand wagyu (alas, no wagyu from Japan).\n\nOur party opted for the domestic wagyu, which was priced moderately between the domestic prime and the NZ wagyu. The cuts include rib eye (my personal favorite), filet and NY sirloin. All cuts were, again, exactly prepared. Taste and tenderness were excellent although the beef examples shown to us at the table were not as well marbled as the NZ wagyu (domestic beef was not sampled to us).\n\nThat being said, the steaks were not really differentiable from prime grade steaks at other upper end steakhouses at half the cost (or more). Nor did it seem better than the prime grade steaks available at Costco prepared by sufficiently skilled home chefs. And, it was noticeably not as good as wagyu in Japan (whether it be from Kobe, Yonezawa or the like).\n\nStill, it was an excellent steak that was prepared very well.\n\nAll told, however, the 4 stars for an overall, cost considered experience, is generous. The service, as others have noted, is largely impeccable if not a little too familiar. The food is excellent. But the pricing is outrageous when similar quality can be had at less than half the price at other esteemed establishments. Not just for the steak but for the sides. $12 for a small side of mashed potatoes? Even if they are my favorite Yukon Golds, it's not like the potatoes are made of gold. Cost considered, I would have awarded 3 stars at best -- excellent food, excellent service but average value at best.\n\nIf you're on vacation or on an expense account, go ahead and splurge once. I did just to satisfy my curiosity of domestic wagyu. It's a great dinner if you're price insensitive. But if you expect the dinner to match the price, you may not have your expectations met."

The Mashed Potatoes were okay came out a bit cold had to tell them to heat it up a bit. The bone marrow which all my friends recommended me to try, was certainly something I have never ordered. It's like a piece of fat that feels like flan. If you like fat then you'll surely love the bone marrow. That texture was a bit off for me. I do recommend this to fans of high end steakhouses.

Almost painfully serious about beef, servers here bring out a platter of raw kobe and wagyu cuts before you order, to show the differences in the meat. \n\nYour taste buds may not be as sensitive as your eyes, though: we actually preferred the 21 day wet-aged Illinois Prime bone-in rib eye to the American Wagyu/Angus New York Sirloin. Cut's ample offerings also include several 35 day dry aged Nebraska Prime as well as True Japanese Waygu (Kobe) choices (all are grilled over hard wood & charcoal then finished under the broiler). \n\nIn fact, Cut's menu seems overly eager to please (or overwhelm) with an excess of options in starters (12 the night we visited), side dishes (13), desserts (7) and even sauces (8), though many were excellent, including the maple glazed pork belly, big eye tuna tartare \"sandwiches\" with wasabi aoli and bar menu's knishes and kobe sliders; and wasabi-yuzu butter and whole grain mustards were both remarkable. But the creamed spinach topped with fried egg was almost too rich and the potato tart tatin was mostly just big and bland. The deconstructed nectarine and plum crumble, served with a house-made \"50 bean\" vanilla ice cream was nice, but far too big a portion to end such a meal.\n \nA nice selection of original and classic cocktails, but their wine list is a bit pretentious and overpriced ($15 for a glass of Argentinian Malbec? Really? I'd pay that much for a magnum of it in the store)\n\nIn short, CUT has one of my favorite lounges on the Strip (sexy, sleek, just dark enough, fitting for either romance or business rendevous), some fantastic appetizers, and a great cocktail menu. CUT has one of my least favorite dining rooms on the Strip (like an 80s office, stiff and steely), and good meat--but not quite as good as their orgiastic presentation lends you to expect. I didn't dislike it, but was not wowed as much as I have been at Craftsteak, Carnevino, and even BOA, all in the same price range. \n\nP.S. At these prices, you can afford to make the sauces complimentary."

The pretzel bread and foccaccia were marvelous! We skipped appetizers since we wanted to concentrate on the beef. My sister and I shared the American kobe-style rib eye and the Japanese wagyu rib eye that the kitchen split for us. We paired the beef with sauteed onions (great), sauteed spinach (also great) and the fries (very good). I preferred the Japanese rib eye, and my sister preferred the American rib eye. This was a great way to taste two different yet similar cuts of beef. The crust added a nice texture and great flavor to the beef. Even though I didn't need dessert, I chose the coffee semi freddo and donuts that were wonderful. Definitely plan to return to CUT on my next visit to LV."

My most recent visit was by far my favorite, and it probably had something to do with consuming 8 oz of Japanese Wagyu. I think it has ruined steak for me forever.\nMy husband decided to take out one of his clients to dinner and we opted for CUT located inside of the Palazzo. The decor isn't mind blowing and it is pretty straight forward, but the food makes up for it. I also was not super impressed with our server.  We started off with a bottle of wine ($75 a Cab of client's choosing) and American Wagyu Beef Sashimi. The appetizer was okay, and I would probably opt for something else at my next visit. They brought bread regularly and although not overly busy, the service seemed very slow and almost disorganized. We were able to start a second bottle of wine by the time our server came by to take our full order and go into his spiel about different types of steaks, the marbling, aging process, etc. \n\nI went with 8 oz New York True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef From Satsuma Prefecture, Kagoshima, Japan. It is initially offered at about $140 for the 6 ozs and then each additional 2 ozs are about $40. Well worth it getting the extra 2 ozs, and if you are splurging you may as well leave full. This was the most delicious piece of meat I have (or probably) will ever have. I know that I had a side as well, but everything faded out during that first bite of the buttery, savory goodness that was the steak. \n\nMy husband had the American Wagyu and it was amazing how appreciable the difference in taste and texture was between the two. We topped off the great meal with some gelato. Well, I am glad my birthday is coming up!"

The sides were super small and he said you would need a couple...well, at $22 for mac n cheese SIDE (which was small), I felt robbed! Smallest steak starts at $55 and is strictly the steak...no sauce or sides. \n\nThe whole time I felt like I was being rationed food! Bread guy gave us 2 small slices to share!

Im not a huge fan or wasn't a huge fan of Chef Puck  but whoa this steakhouse is incredible. Most possibly due to the amount of energy and detail going into the service here. \n\nWe threw down for the Kobe ribe eye! $140 big ones. Incredible experience. I'm not sure if I would do it again however...Kobe steak has a very soft I would say foie gras-esque texture. A teeny tad bit over bearing if you want to get into a good texture of steak. Ahh I know ! Get your friend that doesn't or hasn't tried it to order it..come on you can convince them with the ol' \" you have to try everything once in your lifetime \" line...THEN you order the ribeye which was also masterfully done. Even their cornfed Iowa steak offerings are as good as you will get. \nAlso did a ton of appetizers which is our 'm.o.' Seafood salad was a standout ! \nDesserts...masterfully done...i actually base my whole meal around getting to dessert.\nOverall damage with wine : 6 people $850\n\nOnly reason it doesn't get the 5 star is the items on the menu don't stretch out into the creativity zone. This was a religious steak experience by all counts however. What they do there at CUT they do well...damn well ! A definite check out !"

            "review": "This is the Wolfgang Puck steakhouse, and supposedly impossible to get a reservation at in LA.  So on a weekend in Vegas, we all decided to try this place out. Sure, it was expensive, but how often do you get to dine out in such a nice atmosphere?\n\nThe rooms were dimly lit, and tastefully decorated. We were sat in the inside room, away from the main dining room. Not sure why, but after about 20 minutes I was glad, because our group of 9 quickly became very loud and disruptive (read: drunk).\n\nWe first got a choice of maybe 4 different kinds of breads - I tried the onion focaccia and the pretzel, both of which were soooo good. I am a bread fanatic myself, and I have to say, these were amazing! The pretzel was more like a roll with pretzel covering, and it tasted like there was about a stick of butter in the dough - it melted in my mouth. And the focaccia was very flavorful, in just the right way.\n\nThe group ordered a myriad of different dishes, which was great because I got to try a little bit of just about everything. I got the porterhouse to share, medium rare like I always get my meat, and it came seared on the outside with a peppery rub, and delicately tender on the inside. It was cooked very nicely. I ended up scraping the meat off the bone... haha.\n\nThe scallops, albeit only 4 came on the plate, were exquisite.  I don't know if I would have felt okay with paying about $10 a scallop, but they were definitely the best I've ever had.  I had a bite of the American Wagyu, which was very buttery and definitely tasty.  The japanese wagyu ribeye was even more buttery. They had very high quality beef overall, but some of them came with a little too much salt rubbed on the outside. I don't know if I'd pay $200 for a steak, but it was definitely tasty.\n\nI do have to say, I think my favorite dish of the night was the kobe sashimi - you get 3 thin slices of kobe beef sashimi in a soy sauce vinegarette or something - and it was so delicious. The sides, on the other hand, were just okay. The garlic steam spinach wasn't anything special - I think we would have been better off getting creamed spinach. The mushrooms were good, but then again, I always like mushrooms. We also got some potato side, but I don't remember which it was, and it wasn't all that good.\n\nMost of the food was prepared and presented very nicely. Which is something you would expect out of an establishment like Cut. But service was a little slow and they ran out of the wine that was ordered (I didn't drink it) and had to bring out a different but almost identical one (why couldn't they just notify us in the beginning if they only had one of that kind?). They ended up giving us free dessert at the end of the meal, these teeny bite-sized squares of fudge, cashew, and lemon. The lemon was very tart and was my favorite.\n\nDefinitely a great dining experience, but I wish we had gone with a more intimate group. I'd give it 5 stars, but I just don't think there should be any drawbacks in your night when you're paying this much for a meal."

We were on time and greated by the hostess when we walked in. Restaurant and lounge was full. It was CES week so Vegas is usually jammed that week. The hostess originally tried to seat us in the lounge. I was like \"nah\". Moved promptly to a nice table in the back of the dining room near the private dining room (which was full with employees from one of the companies at CES). Kind of off to the side it was nice and quiet so I could talk to my parents. The table was off balance and every time we tapped it, it would tilt. One of the servers fixed that quick with a folded cocktail napkin right after I pointed it out. Good. \n\nFinally unto the meal. My parents do not drink so I rarely do when dining with them. No problems. A round of diet cokes for all. Typical bar soda in a high end restaurant. There were a few different servers. Everyone works together. The main server brought out a tray to show of the differences in the marbling meat. From Kobe beef to Wagyu and the dry aged. \n\nSome breadsticks on the table were ok. The bread is awesome. Pretzel bread with the different mustard's they put on the table are excellent. They served 4 other types of bread too. All fresh and flavorful. My dad loves his bread. So we had the bread guy come back and fill our plates 3 times throughout the meal. For an app we all split the pork belly. Very tender and cooked well. Enough for two not for three. \n\nThen for the steak action. I know my steaks. My first job, a week after I turned 16, was in an old school meat market. All through high school and college I worked in numerous meat departments of retail establishments. So with that said I obviously had to get the New York sirloin tasting. Three portions, three types of cow. At the time, CUT had legit A9 Kobe beef from Japan on the menu. They gave you 2oz. Awesome! Melt in your mouth. Crazy flavor I have never tasted before in beef. 2nd portion was 4oz of American Wagyu beef. Totally different. A little more beef flavor. The last, was the 4oz portion of dry aged prime corn fed sirloin. Again different in flavor and texture. Most beef like and recognizable.  Still a mighty fine steak. Seasoned well with some S&P (salt and pepper). That's all you need for a high end steak like these. I ordered these medium. Cooked fine. Finished hot. Some different steak sauces were served along side. I tried them each but the steaks did not need them.\n\nMom got a 21 day aged 8oz filet. Def looked bigger. She likes it \"mooing\". She did not finish it so I took control of the situation. Dad got a strip steak. Not sure on the size or aging. \n\nIn a nice steakhouse sides are a la carte. No prob. Served family style works. We got Yukon gold potato puree, creamed spinach with an egg on top ( which was broken and mixed in upon serving), and the onion rings. Everything was served at once, with multiple servers all explaining everything from the types of steaks we ordered, the sauces, and the sides. They served the sides on our plates and we enjoyed. It was steakhouse overload for me. I freaked out and sent all the staff away from me. \n\nWe were all stuffed from all the food. We did not have dessert. Next time. Thanks to my dad for picking up the tab, as he always does."

Pricing is steep and will hit your wallet hard however when you are in Vegas then you are better off using your money for food than gambling. With that mind, and I do not gamble much, I decided to eat my money instead of gambling it. We made reservations for a 9:00PM Table and were seated on time. The atmosphere is very trendy and had enough class to celebrate a very special event. Our special event was caused by the money that was burning a hole in my pocket. I'd rather put that money on a dining table than on a blackjack table. Cut Steakhouse seemed to be the spot to do just that.\n\nI started with a Lobster Bisque soup and it was as good as it can be in any other world class restaurant. It didn't taste anything special or out of this world however it was delightful and got my appetite going. As always, we ordered a bottle of Cabernet and began to set ourselves up for a feast. We had some appetizers as well and for the life of me I can't remember (Six months ago) and therefore I conclude that the appetizer portion was not memorable. \n\nJust before ordering the main course, they bring out all these cuts of meat on a well decorated food cart so that you can get an idea of what you will actually be eating should you order from what was displayed. Nice touch and very few restaurants do this. The other one that comes to mind is Shula's Steakhouse in Pennsylvania. So, you see all these cuts of meat right in front of you and that got my juices flowing. From that dog and pony show, I was expecting my main course to literally come from out of this world. I ordered a dry aged bone in Ribeye steak and asparagus. We continued sipping from our respective glasses of wine and were mentally and tastefully prepared to devour what lay ahead of us. Our order showed up in a timely manner and I began to eat. The steak tasted good but it was NOT great. It was not from out of this world however it was in line with most fine steakhouses. The hype on this steakhouse was so great that this place falls short in meeting your expectations as far as food is concerned. I urge everyone to go to the Cut Steakhouse however I must also add that if you eat at a fine dining place on a regular basis then your expectations will be greater than what Cut Steakhouse can meet."

I had the waiter arrange a wine flight for me, to which he paired a predictable, but delicious, Riesling from Germany.  It was a nice crisp start considering I was in for an incredibly rich meal.\n\nWhen the waiter presented the raw meat I was smitten with a Wagyu Rib Eye, and demanded it be mine.  I topped it off with bone marrow, and waited like a famished lioness.  I asked the waiter for a spicy red, and he sent me a full and spicy Bordeaux that I couldn't wait to wash down with my meat.  I am a carnivore of the worst kind, and love my meat to be as rare as possible.  For this cut I opted for Medium-Rare bloody, and received medium charred.  The fatty marble goodness I anticipated had evaporated.  What was left was a dry, grey, and chewy piece of meat.  I summoned our waiter, and he was appalled and embarrassed.  His profuse apologies, could not appease me.  I did not yell or make a scene, because that would be counterproductive, and let's be honest, it's not his fault.  I was PISSED at the cook who left that gorgeous piece of meat sitting in the oven too long.  It takes a professional idiot to kill Wagyu, and the lack of respect for a valuable product is unforgivable.  Feeling sorry for me, my mom offered to share her beautifully prepared New York Wagyu while I waited, but I wanted her to fully enjoy her meal, so I snacked on the potato gratin, and asparagus sides as I festered about the ruined meat.  \n\nOur waiter returned with a new piece of meat, more apologies, and offered to comp my meal.  I told him that was ridiculous and unnecessary.  I was angry that a product was wasted, not that I would have to pay for a meal.  What was delivered was sinfully delicious.  Tender, juicy, and melt in your mouth.  The bone marrow was buttery, fatty, and a bit iron-y.  It was great with the beef.  Accompanied by the Bordeaux, it was fantastic.  The sides were pretty forgettable and generic, and maybe that was part my fault for ordering them, but c'mon, protein, starch, and vegetable...how could you mess that up?!\n\nI don't love dessert, but my mom wanted something sweet, so we ordered some chocolate concoction that wasn't memorable.  I had a lovely Spanish Port that I enjoyed more than the dessert.\n\nWhen we got the bill our persistent waiter had removed my wine, and the dessert.  So I tipped like a Rockefeller, and thanked him anyway.\n\nI'm giving three stars because I do not respect a restaurant that believes it is acceptable to send out an overcooked piece of meat to a customer.  First, you have disrespected the animal, and the purveyor from where that meat originated.  It took hours of work and plenty of money, to raise, feed, clean, massage, slaughter, and ship that animal.  When you disrespect the product you disrespect the entire process it took to get that product on the table, as well as the customer, and your profession as a cook.  Three stars."

You have to go into it without price limitations to truly enjoy it, but once you get over the sticker shock, you will have an absolutely spectacular dining experience.

            "review": "Yes I'm a meat lover.  Call me a caveman, I just love to eat a big juicy steak.   Being in Hawaii we are a little limited to steakhouses but I have been to most of them at least once.  Morton's, Hy's, DK's, Ruth Chris, and also other with steak like Kincaids, Shoreside Grill, and even Ruby Tuesdays.  Well, you get the jist.   I normally will opt for a Ribeye whenever possible and then maybe a NY or T-bone.  I like my meat to be juicy and have some fat so I normally don't get a filet.\n\nBeing we were heading out for Vegas I wanted to have a date night with my wife and get a good steak.  I asked my friend, who is a seasoned chef.  He lived and worked in Vegas for some years after grad-ing from the CIA and working at the Greenbrier among many other accomplishments both abroad and at home.  I figured he'd be the best person to ask for an honest opinion.  He recommended a few places we could try but said if given the choice we should go to CUT.  That sealed it, CUT it was.  I checked Open Table to see if I needed to book way ahead but it seemed like we should be fine booking a day in advanced.  Great considering we hardly know where we will be in Vegas day to day and hour to hour.  Once we were out there and could plan our schedule, we were able to lock down a reservation that would work for us.\n\nWe headed out a little early not know how long it would take me to find the parking garage and not know how far we would have to walk to get from the parking to the restaurant.  CUT is in the Palazzo hotel.  Parking was a breeze.  They had a guard asking where you were going so I guess maybe they restrict the parking to guest and customers.  We found a parking pretty close to the elevators which is amazing for a Vegas Casino.  Needless to say we had some time to explore before going to the restaurant.\n\nWe had a reservation at 9 and got there about 10 minutes early.  They were pretty packed.  They didn't have a regular table open yet but did offer us a table off to the side in the lounge area.  We decided to wait for a regular table, not wanting to miss out on the whole steakhouse experience.  We did go to the bar to kill our 10 minutes.  One think that irritated me at the bar was when I asked the bartender what kind of beer they had he immediately stated that they don't carry anything domestic like Bud Light or Coors.  Did I f**king say that's what I wanted??  All he had to do was provide me their drink menu, which is on an iPad for customer use.  Snooty bartender,  he should be happy I payed for those drinks with my total bill and didn't have to tip him separate.\n\nOnce seated we had the best service.  Our waiter was Chip and from what we saw, he was probably the head waiter as he was directing most of the other workers as he did his job.  He was very knowledgeable about their menu offerings and offered in-depth descriptions about everything they served.\n\nThe menu was a head turner.  They had so many things that sounded delicious.  One of those places you wished you were with a large party so you could sample more.  We decided on the Warm Asparagus, Poached Organic Egg, Warm Bacon Vinaigrette on a focaccia bread as our appetizer.  Along with that we also got  to pick from their selection of homemade breads and also got a couple or long parmesan coated breadsticks and butter puffs, or something like that.\n\nFor the main dish my wife got the Indian Spiced Kobe Beef shortribs which they slow cook for 8 hours.  They were very succulent and rich.  They had a distinct Indian flavor but not too overpowering.  It was also not very spicy at all.  The meat was so tender it was almost falling off the bone.  It was actually too much for my wife to finish.\n\nAfter Chip had explained the different lines of meats they carried I was sure I would need to get their sampler to get the best taste of what they had to offer.  I got their \"Tasting of New York Sirloin Sampler\".  It came with a 4oz of Snake River Farms American \"Kobe\" style beef, 4oz USDA Prime 35 day aged, and a 2oz of Blackmore Ranch Australian Wagyu.  It also came with a medley of different sauces and spices I could add to it.  None of which I needed to use.  They season their steaks with sea salt and black pepper.  It was seasoned perfectly so that the saltiness and pepper was not too overpowering and let the flavor of the beef shine through.  It tasted amazing.  And to be able to taste these 3 different lines of beef side by side really made it easy to see and taste the difference in quality.  All being top notch but clearly easy to rank.  Might make me come back for more Australian Wagyu on a future trip.  We also got a side of their mac and cheese that was suggested by the waiter.  Talk about rich and creamy, definitely a grown up mac and cheese.\n\nIf you ever are in Vegas and in search of a great steakhouse.  Make sure to put cut on the shortlist.  You definitely won't be disappointed.  Happy eats!"

The bar seating is quite expansive.  The entire front of the restaurant with lots of seating.  \n\nWe had a 7 p.m. reservation and no wait at all.  Seated immediately.\n\nThe best thing about this place was the awesome wait staff.  We had some great waiters who really were professional waiters.  They pulled out my chair (which ooops I missed ladies, never sit facing the door) and of course they were very knowledgable about the menu.\n\nOk, the wait staff was awesome, but so was the food.  We ordered the proscuitto with figs and some kind of fresh cheese.  The cheese was to DIE for.  Fresh figs in season - to DIE.\n\nI also had a glass of a lovely pinot which they brought out in its own caraffe to pour into my glass.  Very classy.  \n\nI got some 6 oz Wagyu monstrosity and had point reyes blue cheese and onions on top.  The waiters brought out the meat to look at.  It was delicious.  I think $135 for my steak?  Something like that.  But man was it worth it.  Especially with the carmelized onions and blue cheese.\n\nThe only negative I would say is the music.  They were playing Tom Petty and some other stuff that just didn't seem to go with what I would picture as an upscale restaurant.  It was a little off...\n\nI wish we had room for dessert.  We didn't.  \n\nIt was also our last night of the trip, so we were soooo full and sunburnt.  I really loved this place, but would have loved it more if I didn't have a steak the night before."

I haven't gotten into the swing of yelping often but this is one of those experiences that is so terrible that you just have to write about it. And actually, I went months ago, but looks like I never finished my review.\n\nCame here with a group of 14 girls for a bachelorette party. We had spent weeks picking out the perfect place for dinner and were really looking forward to our meal. They go through the motions of being a five star restaurant but you can tell they definitely don't think you're a five star customer. You might think we're a prissy/snooty bunch but I assure you, we could have eaten hot dogs and been happy but we chose a nice place so we could have a memorable experience.\n\nStarted with the bone marrow appetizer. It was tasty as marrow usually is, you can probably share it since it came with two pieces and it's so rich. I had the Australian Wagyu. Good quality meat though I've had rib eye prepared much better. It's just a slab of meat on your plate, not to mention overcooked. Presentation points: 0. *shrugs maybe I wanted to be impressed since it is a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, oh well. \n\nThey suggested that we get sides to share for each half of the table. There was a misunderstanding when a waiter began to serve out sides on our individual plates that was actually for the other side. Even after asking him to stop, he ignored our request and kept serving away. One of the head waitresses came over to ask what was wrong. She told us that all sides were supposed to be family style and left it at that. Family style is fine but if that's the case, don't put it on everyone's plate if they don't want to eat it, especially after we asked you not to. Her tone was so extremely rude that many of us were taken aback.\n\nMaybe it's because we were a large group but I can honestly say that I have never been treated so poorly at any dining establishment. We even talked to a manager and I can't even bring myself to tell you their response. SO disappointing. The only reason CUT is 'memorable' is because I can't forget how unhappy we were when we finally left. Poor attitudes, poor communication, poor service all around. \n\nNever again. And anytime a friend mentions Vegas, I tell them to stay away from CUT. Really not worth the price you pay."

The meat was so buttery and the delicate asian flavors of the sauce was a perfect pairing.\n \n2. Bone Marrow Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad - Very good but did not have that intense marrow flavor that I like. I also did not like the accompanying parsley salad as it overpowered the flan. However when eaten by itself the parsley was a good palate cleanser. \n\n3. Warm Asparagus, Poached Organic Egg, Warm Bacon Vinaigrette - Nice Salad very good flavor. Hard to mess up a dish with those ingredients.\n\n4. Nebraska Corn Fed Ribeye - Not a very thick steak, which I always prefer. The crust was overpowering due to the amount of char. Way too much char in my opinion.\n\n5. True Japanese 100% Wagyu Ribeye - Thicker than the Nebraska Ribeye but served in two pieces which I thought was odd. The meat was heavily marbled and very tender. The Wagyu steak did not have a very meaty flavor, more relaxed and clean. Again though, the charing on the crust proved too much. \n\n6. Yukon Gold Potato Puree - Very good, recommended. Creamy and buttery. \n\nThe service was excellent and the ambiance is very nice. We had a very large and comfortable booth. Our sever was very professional and his support staff was very attentive. Overall, a good experience but the prices are very high, be prepared to spend. The steaks were too heavily charred for me.

The service was great, the food was terrible.\n\nI've been to all the major steakhouses in LA and LV...except for Cut.  My friends recommended that I try it out because it has been one of their favorite destinations for steak.  Trying to put the hype aside, I went in there with an open mind and a large appetite.  I was sold on the American Wagyu Ribeye, ordered medium-rare.  When it came out, it was probably closer to medium than medium rare.  Not a deal breaker.  I took my first bite...gristle.  Yes, I know ribeyes tend to be a little fatty, but this was chewy...to the point where I couldn't chew anymore and had to spit it out.  The next bite is right in the center, where I think it would melt in my mouth (wagyu!)...and gristle again.  Ok, it's been established that this steak does not melt in my mouth as promised.  The third bite is when I realized that I'm not tasting the meat, but instead just a bunch of seasoning...mainly salt.  \n\nI thought I might have had a bad steak, but I asked around the table (7 of us) and everyone agreed with me and had the same feedback.  There were talks of Cut having an \"off night,\" but I stand pretty firmly on this: an establishment like Cut does not have an \"off night.\"  If it did, it wouldn't be THIS off of a night.\n\nNeedless to say, we paid the bill and vowed never to come back.  Ok, maybe not never, but it will be a while before I can take the plunge again and pay close to $200 for what's supposed to be an amazing dining experience."

Thus, for the price, I would rather go to Mastro's (at the same time, I am not going to turn down a comped steakhouse run though haha).\n\nSo why would I choose Mastro's over this place? \n\nWell first, don't get me wrong but the service here was very good, better then most places, but it wasn't nearly at the personal level that Mastro's is at.  Our server explained the menu, brought out a sample plate of the rare cuts of meat (have to say I kind of wish other steakhouses had this), and explained each cut.  Moreover, the service overall, was very attentive....however I still was not \"feeling\" the place.  Maybe it was the decor or maybe the presentation, but I have to say there are definitely better places to choose from in Vegas for a fine dining experience.    \n\nAs for the steak, I got the New Zealand Wagyu Beef From Kato Farms, Hastings, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand 8 oz steak for $140 with an additional 2 oz for an extra $40.  It was 10 oz of pure bliss...with a few gripes.  First, the steak come out lukewarm. Personally, I find this to be kind of disappointing as I like my steaks to come out piping hot.  Luckily, the steak had the nice charred outside with a juicy pinkish/red inside, medium-rare just the way I like it.  Second, and probably the most taboo thing, the plate was cold, warm at best.  Which top-notch steakhouse serves their plates like this?  I mean I can let by the fact that the steak was warm, but a cold plate is just unacceptable as now you are forced to eat your steak and sides quickly lest it cool down.  Thirdly, the presentation of the sides was simply awful.  I could present my own buffet plate nicer then they do here.  And when the servers scooped the sides onto my steak plate I felt as if I really was walking through a buffet line...  You would think for a couple hundred a plate that this place could present their food better.    \n\nDecent place to grab a bite or bring a date if you are staying at the Palazzo, but not someplace I would specifically come to on a whim as there are lots of better steakhouses on The Strip (for example Strip Steak at the Mandalay Bay)."

Those were all really good, the beef sashimi was probably the best followed by the bone marrow. No point in getting bone marrow on the side if you get the appetizer. These appetizers can be split amongst 4 people. For sides we tried creamy spinach and mushrooms. The creamy spinach was really creamy....not my cup of tea.

Maybe I should have after you read the Bad and the Ugly below.\n\nThe Bad and the Ugly - I had such high hopes to finish my stay in Las Vegas with a great steakhouse experience.  What a disappointment.  The rib-eye I ordered was cooked perfectly and oh so tender.  The first bite was heaven.  After three or four bites I realized how salty the steak was.  Before I finished half of the steak there was so much salt on my palate I could barely taste my wine and other food.  I had to drink the entire 750 ml bottle of sparkling water I ordered.  Because of the salty meat I could finish neither my meal, wine, or the cocktail.\n\nThe waiter did remove the cost of the meat from my bill but I didn't care about that.  I wanted a great steakhouse experience and was sorely disappointed.   Wolfgang, this establishment needs some of your personal attention.\n\n(I updated my review based on the response I received from management; professional and courteous as you would expect.  I will indeed give CUT another try on my next trip to Vegas and am confident that it will be a much better experience as others here have raved.)"

We were greeted immediately upon walking in and our table was ready for us shortly thereafter. The server was outstanding, really he was. He did a wonderful job of making sure my wife and I fully understood the menu and the different cuts of beef. His assistants were just is fantastic, neither of our water glasses ever reached empty and they were always checking on us.  The reason I am knocking them down two stars though is because I didn't really care for my steak. Our server did warn us that they \"generously\" season their steaks before grilling them and he was not exaggerating. All I could taste though was the pepper and salt mixture and the true flavor the beef was not enhanced it was simply masked. For the money that we spent here I definitely do not feel like we had a meal to remember. That being said, the atmosphere and service were top-notch."

Very cool atmosphere, wine and drink lists on iPads, they bring out the cuts of meat for you too look at so you know what you are choosing.  Diverse appetizers and salads, but for main courses, if you do beef, stick with that.  They do it really good.  Would recommend to anyone, but it is upper priced compared to most."

The front desk staff were very pleasant and welcoming. \n\nTheir wine list is extensive and you will find something you like. For dinner I started with the butter lettuce with blue cheese and champagne vinaigrette. It was outstanding and unfortunately the best part of the meal. For my main I had the petite filet mignon. It was good but not outstanding. No sides for me but I had to order the Valrhona chocolate souffle. Again, it was good but not memorable. I had to return my espresso as it had an odd taste to it. They gladly took it back as I then requested a black coffee.\n\nMy 5 stars for service is based upon Sam being my server. He was outstanding from beginning to end. I noticed he pampered all of his guests. He really made me feel like a VIP and CUT is lucky to have him.\n\nFood was fine -  service was excellent. I would return and give the food another shot-as long as Sam was my server!"

Decided this would be a nice splurge for our 3 year wedding anniversary and it certainly was. I was glad I read a bunch of Yelpers reviews before going as it made it MUCH easier to choose what to get and all that. \n\nWe went with a 9pm rez after seeing Phantom. Both of us had intentionally skipped lunch in anticipation and I even went to the gym 3 days in a row haha. The atmosphere was pretty loud. Not exactly the most romantic place but no big deal. The vibe was more fitting for the HRH all-suites tower than Palazzo. \n\nGot a booth instead of the stupid swivel chairs thank god. Wife started with the kobe beef sashimi which was awesome. Pretty much the best carpaccio ever. I could've just eaten the beef sushi-style. I got the big eye tuna tartare after reading everyone's recommendation and it certainly did not disappoint. \n\nAfter reading SO many raves about it..I went with the 10 oz American Kobe ribeye. Wow! You gotta love the marbled, fattiness of the beef. My wife got the regular filet which was also excellent and the difference in how both meats tasted was really interesting. We could only manage to eat half of our steaks but I'm SO looking forward to the leftovers today!!  \n\nThe price of the mac and cheese was ridiculous. I was looking for an asterisk on the menu that said it came with a foot massage or something...tasted awesome anyways. Also went with the broccoli rapini for the other side. Went well with everything. Skipped the sauces and didn't miss them. \n\nFYI..they don't do a locals discount anymore. Whatever..no one comes here to save money. \n\nWe've been to so many steakhouses in LV....I can't say it was the best one we've been to but it was really great."

I had just dined at Alexander's( http://www.yelp.com/biz/alexanders-steakhouse-cupertino#hrid:zgOk0ixxx8Fog1FdFDMgKA/src:self ) a few weeks prior and LOVED it, so I had super high expectations for CUT.  We had a party of eight, so we called in for reservations ahead of time. \n\nService here is definitely outstanding.  There were so many servers waiting on us, I couldn't keep track.  Our water glasses were always full, and your napkin would always be folded if you got out of your seat.  Our waiter brought out a platter to display the different cuts of wagyu beef....Kobe vs. American...so we could see the different marbling.    \n\nFor my first course, I ordered the Roasted Baby Beets, Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese, Pistachio, Citrus, Micro Basil,  & Mint.  I originally was going to get the USDA Prime bone in rib eye steak, but it was only $20 more for the American Wagyu rib eye....I was sold.  I added the wild field mushrooms to top off my lovely piece of steak.  Our table also ordered Saut\u00e9ed Baby Spinach, Soft Polenta with Parmesan and Tempura Onion Rings.\n\nMy beet appetizer had a very nice presentation.  It was very colorful, and all of the ingredients complimented each other very well.  All of our sides were very tasty.  The polenta was nice and creamy, onion rings were crispy, and the spinach added the \"healthy\" factor to our meal.\n\nThey prepare the steaks over a hard wood and charcoal grill and then finish them off in a broiler.  My steak was cooked to a nice medium rare, and it melted in my mouth.  The steak had great flavor, but I didn't really care much for the charred flavor from the broiler.  The wild mushrooms I added went well with my steak and kept it moist from the sauce.  I wasn't able to finish my steak and gave it to my friends who had the USDA Prime rib eye.  They were amazed and could totally tell the difference from the Wagyu.\n\nThe only disappointment I had here was that they didn't have foie gras as an add on to your steak.  I was spoiled by Alexander's, and left the restaurant craving that melt in your mouth foie gras.  I was so expecting a 5 star dinner here, but I just couldn't give it to them.  Please add foie gras to the menu!"

Restaurant is inside the Palazzo hotel, which in my opinion is one of the top three resorts, didn't stay here this time but many other occasions and this place never disappoints. \n\nOn to the restaurant.. Made my reservations here about three days in advance and they did call to confirm my anniversary celebration. The restaurant itself is modern in d\u00e9cor and medium sized. My wife wasn't too fond of the table settings - seemed to be more appropriate for outdoor patio furniture as opposed to fine dining. \n\nWe both had the bone marrow flan which was good.\n\nMy wife loved the sea bass and described it as the best she's ever had. Kudos for me ;)\n\nI unfortunately was disappointed on my long awaited steak. Ordered the dry aged rib eye good portion size, however it came out lukewarm. I ordered it slightly above medium and some portions were still a little bloody. My waiter was nowhere to be found and after being almost halfway into the meal (was hungry,) he only offered to warm it up which after the fact, the dinner completely lost its appeal. The quality of the steak was good however some portions were not seasoned properly to the point where I had to add some table salt. Frankly I regrettably found my meal to be mediocre.\n\nOn a positive note; the drinks and sides - especially the mushroom saut\u00e9 was very good. I even liked their house steak sauce as such condiments usually should not be accompanied with fine meat. \n\nAfter our meals, we were treated to strawberry shortcake as our anniversary treat which was much appreciated although the waiter basically forgot of our purpose of celebration there and was asking if we wanted our check. \n\nTo sum up our experience, the restaurant didn't really provide the high end vibe, quality or service we usually experience at other steakhouses such as Mastros, Ruths or even Fogo. Too bad because we live in LA and were anxious to dine again at the CUT location in Beverly."

I had a bone in grass fed NY strip (20oz) that was cooked to perfection.  I specifically requested no sauce, with a dash of salt and pepper since I am a meat elitist, and I had no problem finishing the whole steak.  I loved their sauces, but most seemed to overpower the terrific flavor of the meats, so I would recommend not using the sauces, especially if you are opting for a special cut.  As for sides, they tasted pretty standard in comparison to other steakhouses.  I would recommend the potato puree and the spinach.

But sadly, I was hugely disappointed.\n\nFor a 6 oz steak that costs $85, I expected a lot more. I ordered the American wagyu filet mignon, medium rare. What I got was definitely more rare than medium rare.. most of the steak was red. I even started to question if they gave me the right steak, because it wasn't anything near amazing, like I expected after reading some yelp reviews about the American wagyu.  It was kinda tasteless, didn't melt in my mouth at all, and was even slightly difficult to swallow. Mastros in Costa Mesa is way better..\n\nOther reviews on what we ordered:\nAppetizer: bone marrow flan: this was pretty good. It had a lot of flavor.. even the salad on top was delicious and refreshing amongst all the heavy things we ordered. Not a lot in terms of quantity but very tasty. I think it's popular because it's so unique. Good but didn't amaze me. \nAmerican wagyu filet mignon: see above. This was ok... sad to say.\nAmerican wagyu ribeye: what my bf ordered. He always gets the ribeye and I always get the filet mignon, which is nice because we get to try both. His ribeye was ok. Not as fatty and flavorful as ribeyes usually are. A disappointment as well.. didnt have much flavor.  \nMaybe we were supposed to order some toppings for our steaks to give them more flavor, but we wanted to taste the steak on its own since it's supposed to be such good quality. I guess that's what the sauces and salt (that they offer) are for. I'd rather the chef perfect the steak's flavor for me, though, since they're the pros and we're paying so much. \n\nSide: wild field mushrooms: this was ok. I would have much preferred other mushrooms. I wouldn't order this again. Be careful when you eat the big green pepper as it can be very spicy!\n\nMac n cheese: this was actually really good! Not your typical mac n cheese. I loved the texture of the macaroni\n\nWine: I forgot the exact one I ordered, but it was a cabernet sauvignon, which I always get. It was okay. \n\nService was pretty good. They explain the cuts of meat to you, comparing Japanese wagyu and American wagyu. The servers were very efficient and seemed pretty busy. You should definitely ask questions if you have any. They were more than happy to answer my questions. \n\nIn the end, our meal was $300 for two people (appetizer, two steaks, two sides and a glass of wine). I wish the price were justified by an unforgettable meal, but I'm left feeling pretty unsatisfied. I didn't even bother to look at the dessert menu, which says a lot. Trust me.\n\nCome here to experience a Wolfgang Puck restaurant if you wish, but just don't get your hopes up."

            "review": "CUT is a top notch steak house, with a nice variety on the menu.  Compared to many other high-end Steak spots in town, it's good, but not the best.  While my group really enjoyed the meal, there were many misses on service and execution.  \n\nFirst the Bad:\n\nWhile we were there with a large group on a Friday night, drinks took 15-20 minutes to come out each time.   This was discouraging, since most of the time one likes to enjoy the symphony of flavors found in pairing food w/ wine rather than sipping after the meal.  The side dishes are tiny and expensive ($12) even by upscale steakhouse standards.  We ordered as the waitress suggested, and found that we ordered too little.  Many of our steaks were not cooked to our requests.  I had the 9 Oz. American Wagyu Ribeye ($88), and ordered it medium-rare.  It came out Medium.  When I brought it to the server's attention, she paid it no mind.  \"It's still quite good medium,\" she responded.  For a place that specializes in steak, any imperfection in it's preparation is a huge concern.\n\nNow the Good:\nThe Bone Marrow Flan appetizer was magnificent.  Unctuous, rich, beefy, orgasm of flavor.  I've never had bone marrow executed so well; it was the most loved item of the night, judging from our table's \"Mmm's\" and \"Damn that's goods.\"  \n\nThe Maple Pork Belly was also incredible.  Rich, smokey, bacony goodness; I could have eaten another order, but didn't want to spoil dinner.\n\nThe Manhattan (while it takes a while) was perfect.  The Whiskey-cured Cherry at the bottom of the glass just teases you with flavor, it is the best Manhattan I've ever had.  \n\nDecor:  Lot's of textures, generally straight lines fused together to create a stylish yet welcoming setting.  It is well-lit, and bright, which isn't something many steakhouses can say.  I like to see my food in all it's vibrant color, and the ambience at CUT allows for that special situation.\n\nCUT is a special place, but when compared to similar estabilshments, it doesn't shine as bright as one would hope."

I ordered the ribeye and shared sides with our party creamed spinach, mushrooms and mac and cheese. Honestly, none of it was memorable. Felt that the steak was too heavy and lacking flavor. I didn't even finish an eighth of my steak. :("

This most recent visit this past Sunday was by far very disappointing.\n\nWe got there at 10 and we were seated promptly. Then the waiting game began,  we waited about 10 mins before we got menus,  someone said  we waited 25 mins...it seemed like that but I'm clocked it at 10. Then we waited to get water and took forever to get our wine.  I grant it was 4 of us and only 2 were going to be eating but everyone was going to be drinking.\n\n\nWell we finally got the menu but took another 15-20 mins to place our order. One person order NY strip, I order the A5 Japanese Wagyu NY strip 8 oz portion.\n\nAnd a side of potatoes . Ohhh and a butter lettuce salad and pork belly bacon as an app\n\nSo about an hour 20 mins we got our steaks...\n\n\nThe cook did not do the A5 justice, ordered medium rare, but the outside was charred...not a flavorful char but burnt char... first thing you taste is burnt meat.. then steak... that kind of ruined the steak for... parts were over charred some not...\n\nPotatoes arrived a couple mins after.\n\nI should of sent steak back but I didn't want to wait another hour... plus it just wasn't worth the wait. \n\nFinally we settled up and walked out at 1215 am... 2 hours later that's long time for 2 steaks and one and 2 apps\n\nPlace was not even busy..many empty tables.. not sure I'll be back.... maybe there Beverly Hills location will be better"

The steak came out under cooked and the waitress said it was because of the bone?  If Im paying 65-100 for a steak it better be cooked right.  Appetizers weren't bad.  Overall not a bad experience but you can get better for the price."

            "review": "Let me preface this review by saying I really struggle giving 4 stars. Yes, the food was good, and the service was great, but I just don't think you get a good value at CUT. There are better places nearby with equally good food and better atmosphere. So here's the info:\n\nAllergen info - I'm gluten free (BF is not) and they were amazing about all my questions. The server knew exactly what I could have, and every time they brought my BF bread (which was insanely often), they were apologetic that it had gluten in it. \n\nAtmosphere - Yes, as other posters state, it's quite chic looking inside. But it's also very LOUD. Like super loud. Like so loud even the waiter can't hear you. And they have you look at an iPad for drinks, which seemed interesting at first but was really just kind of cheesy. \n\nSteaks - I had the Illinois petite filet and BF had the Nebraska ribeye. Both were cooked perfectly with excellent texture and flavor (although my filet was a bit too salty from the rub).\n\nSides - The polenta was delicious with so much cheesy goodness. I could've made a meal out of it alone. The broccoli was outstanding! It had just a hint of a kick from red peppers. Soooo yummy.\n\nWine - selection was average but a bit pricy, even for Vegas. They had too few bottle choices under $100. Variety overall was just too limited. \n\nService - was excellent. You never wondered if they were going to fill your glass. They were just there! We definitely felt well taken care of. \n\nExtras - we chose not to have dessert, but we were pleasantly surprised when they brought out some little bites with the check. They brought gluten-filled ones for my BF and brought me a little scoop of sorbet. It was great. \n\nAll in all, the meal was great, but there are so many places that are a notch above it in a city like Vegas. I give it an A, but the ambience definitely knocks it down a peg. For my money, I'd rather go back over to delmonico's just across the path for an A+ experience."

Exceptional customer service, presentation, and food. Our husband and I had no complaints whatsoever. We ordered the veal tongue and bone marrow flan which were definitely interesting but tasty. We ordered the American wagyu ribeye and filet mignon and it was hands down the best steak we have ever had, I can only imagine how the Japanese steak tastes. You MUST spend the extra $2 on the sauces they recommend for that specific steak it makes a huge difference. Also try their baked Alaska dessert. Amazing. Definitely recommend trying this restaurant out."

Could not have been fresher or tastier in any way. Perfection on a plate.\n\nSides. Mac & Cheese Gratinee...Again as good as it gets. Perfect blend and taste throughout.\n\nPeas with ramps and sunchokes....again perfect in every way. A unique side dish full of flavor and texture.\n\nDesert. Banana cream pie...there is none better ANYWHERE. this is a must.\n\nSteaks: NY Strip and Kobe Filet....Well to be honest they were good not great. They were nice size steaks with decent to good flavor and tenderness. BUT CUT THE SALT BY 99% and it would have been much much better. It was inundated with salt. So everything else was very very good. The steaks drpped the experience for us."

We had a reservation, arrived on-time, and were seated promptly. The waiter was extremely knowledgable and attentive. He explained the menu thoroughly and answered any and every question we had. His recommendations were great and his overall demeanor was friendly and nice. When our food arrived he was joined by several other servers who dished out our sides. The overall presentation and service was very good - I felt quite pampered :)\n\nNow onto the main thing - The Food. AMAZING!! The cheese puffs were delicious, as were the breadsticks. The pretzel bread was wonderful too. But the main course was a grand-slam. There were 4 of us, we each got a different cut of steak and we were all in love with what we ordered. We each got a side to share, and I loved them all, especially the macaroni and cheese but MOST OF ALL the creamed spinach and egg. I was the one who ordered the spinach, based on what other Yelpers had said and that dish did NOT disappoint!!! It was fantastic, and I wouldn't have ordered it had it not been so highly rated by others on here, so thanks Yelpers for helping me step out of my comfort zone and try something new there. \n\nBy dessert I was too full for much else, but we got a banana something? and a lemon something? - sorry, I'm being super helpful here, I know - but both were good. But nothing compared with the main meal. It was out-of-this-world delicious.\n\nI should note, here that there was one negative - our waiter forgot our friend's salad. She brought it to his attention, and he apologized and offered to bring it out with the meal, but she declined. But I noticed on the bill that he comped us our desserts, which was a nice touch.\n\nThe bill came to roughly $450 or so for the 4 of us, so no, not cheap but worth it! I think everyone should splurge on a fantastic meal every now and then, and I'm glad we did that at CUT. It was wonderful."

For those of you who don't know what a Dark and Stormy is and are wondering what the hell ginger is doing is doing in a drink....it's basically ginger beer (much more of a ginger flavor than ginger ale), black rum, and lime juice. Try one, they're tasty and refreshing.\n\nAnyway, as for dinner, we started off with the crab & shrimp cocktail. It was ok, nothing spectacular.\n\nThen came the steak. I opted for one of 21-day aged steaks. These are the cheapest on the menu and are not the dry-aged ones. I had the bone-in ribeye. Now I know dry-aged is better than a normal aged steak (wet aged), but a) it was the end of my trip in which I had already spent a ton of money and wanted to go for the cheaper option and b) I've had plenty of good ribeyes that were not dry-aged. Well, it was kinda tough, too lean for a ribeye, lacking fat marblization, and wasn't exactly bursting with flavor. Overall it was an ok steak, just not what a ribeye should be and therefore disappointing. \n\nThe creamed spinach side was ok and the mac and cheese was pretty good. \n\nWe skipped dessert because we had a show to catch, so I'm not sure what I missed out on. \n\nI'm sure the dry-aged steaks here are better and I'm sure the wagyu is quite good. But a good steakhouse should still have a good wet-aged ribeye. So in comparison to other upscale steakhouses, this is mediocre. I guess maybe all the people ranking this as one of the top steakhouses in Vegas had the better steaks on the menu (dry-aged, wagyu)."

I have no shame, I LOVE MY MEAT!\n\nI've been to Del Frisco's, Delmonico's, Craftsteak and Mon Ami Gabi and I can say hands-down that CUT blew these highly rated Vegas Steakhouses OUT OF THE WATER!\n\nOn Thursday, 7.29.10, my friend and I arrived on time for our 6 PM reservations and were promptly seated. \n\nFOOD/DRINKS:\n*2007 Pinot Noir ($17/glass): I forgot the name b/c it's not listed on their online menu, but this Pinot was recommended by our waitress. It had the perfect balance of berry flavor w/ a slight acidity to balance the richness of the food.\n\n*Complimentary Bread:\n-Cheese sticks: OMG! The cheese sticks were sprinkled w/ parmesan cheese and baked to a cheesy crisp. \n\n-Pretzel Bread: SO GOOD! Nice and crusty on the outside and pillow soft layers in the inside.\n\n-Onion Focaccia: YUM! It was like layers of buttery bread woven around sweet caramelized onions\n\n*Bone Marrow Flan ($17): YUM! What a genius take on bone marrow! The flan was like velvety smooth custard w/ prominent bone marrow flavor (beefy richness) w/o an overwhelming oiliness that bone marrow tends to have. The mushroom marmalade added a layer of savory sweetness while the warm toasted added a nice crunch.\n\n*Maple Glazed Pork Belly ($17): MmMm! The pork belly was perfectly crisp and smokey on the outside and fork tender and soft in the inside. The pear compote added the perfect amount of sweetness to balance to saltiness from the pork, while the dressed arugula added a layer of citrusy peppery freshness. \n\n*A Tasting of New York Sirloin ($145 + $40 for an add'l 2 oz): Shared among 2 people.\n\nBefore we ordered, the steaks were beautifully presented on a platter while our waitress explained the differences (i.e. marbling). All the steaks are lightly seasoned w/ their House Sea Salt, charred to seal in the juices, and then grilled to the perfect tenderness. Each cut was served w/ an accompanying sauce chosen by the Chef. \n\n-Australian Waygu Sirloin (2 oz): OMFG *Faint*! This was BEST effen steak I've ever had in my 28 years! With gentle strokes from my knife, the AW cut like a piece of butter and juices dribbled down from the pores of the meat. The AW had a crisp crust and the meat melted in my mouth like a triple cream butter. It was so full of FLAVOR from the intense marbling and it wasn't overly seasoned so you can taste the actual waygu.\n\nBearnaise: Added an add'l layer of richness w/ a hint of citrus flavor\n\n-U.S.D.A. PRIME Dry Aged Nebraska (4 oz): SO GOOD! It's a little leaner than the AW, however, the taste is not sacrificed. Just like the AW, the steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare) w/ crisp outer crust and juicy tender center. \n\nChimichurri: Added an herby freshness w/ a touch of sweetness\n\n-American Waygu from Idaho (4 oz): Although it was a perfectly cooked and seasoned steak, it was my least favorite of the three. This is to be expected after sampling the other steaks which had much more marbling and flavor. \n\nHouse made Steak Sauce: Added a sweet and spicy tang\n\n*Sides:\n-Bone Marrow ($9): OMFG! As you bite into the gobbles of marrow, the beefy oily goodness just bursts in your mouth and showers your cut of meat w/ yet another layer of richness.\n\n-Creamed Spinach w/ Fried Egg ($12): YUM! The spinach was tender and the yolk from the egg added the perfect amount of creaminess w/o being too heavy.\n\n*Strawberry Shortcake ($14): The perfect ending to our meal! The shortcake was warm and crisp on the outside w/ soft layers in the inside. The vanilla ice cream added a sweet richness while the strawberry frozen yogurt added a tart sweetness. It was the perfect balance of taste, textures, and temperatures; hot, cold, creamy, sweet, and tart.\n\n*Complementary Dessert:\n-Salted Carmel Fudge Bar: After stuffing myself w/ rich laden foods, the richness of the fudge was just too overwhelming for me.\n\n-Whiskey Cashew Brittle: OMG! The cashew was perfectly toasted and crisp, while the brittle was sweet and crunchy w/ a hint of the whiskey. What set it over the top was the flakey, buttery phyllo dough crust.\n\nSERVICE:\nFLAWLESS! Our waitress was friendly and very attentive. She was well-versed w/ the menu and made excellent recommendations. Orders were promptly taken and the food was brought out like an orchestrated symphony. The other wait staff looked like intimidating nightclub bouncers but were very sweet and checked on us numerous times to make sure everything was perfect. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nCUT is not your grandpa's steakhouse. It's modern and sleek w/ ivory basket woven walls, glass square box lighting, abstract gun metal d\u00e9cor and black/white scenic pictures.\n\nCUT is a MUST go-to for steak connoisseurs! It's not cheap, however, a meal at CUT is one of those \"life experiences\" that you cannot put a price tag on..."

The food was good, the presentation was imaginative and the service was some of the best at any restaurant I've ever been to. The atmosphere is very modern but not uncomfortable. (Ask for a booth as the regular tables and chairs looked not-so-pleasant). \n\nThe prices are pretty high but the quality and presentation makes it (almost) worth it. Don't expect to get out of here without paying at least $200 on a dinner for two. We had 2 appetizers, 2 steaks, 2 sides, 2 glasses of wine and 2 dessert and our total check was around $275.00 (before tip). We didn't go for the crazy expensive meat, just the \"regular\" filet mignon and bone-in ribeye. The steaks were good and the wood fired cooking gave them a nice flavor. The steaks come with a few different sides of mustards (I've never seen that before at a steakhouse). \n\nAs others have noted, I found everything here to be extremely salty. It was like somebody knocked over the salt bowl into the food. I had the squash as a side and it was coated in salt. The steak was crusted with salt. The steaks came out with a small bowl of extra salt and a spoon! The butter for the bread is topped with salt, as is the bread itself (pretzel and foccacia is where it's at, ya'll)! If you are looking for a salt lick, this is the place for you. Next time I am going to ask them to tone down the salt in my food, it was almost unbearable but not to the point of making the food inedible.\n\nThe wine list is abysmal but we were told the corkage fee if you bring your own wine is a very steep $50 (that's what the French Laundry in Napa Valley charges)! Luckily there were some good options of wines by the glass -- we opted for the Hall cabernet for $19 a glass. Totally worth it."

In the past, I have not had the best experiences at Cut yet the valued opinions of several people on Yelp and Chowhound keep me coming back to this place to give Chef Puck's people another chance. \n\nLast night some friends from the good 'ol days were in town and invited me out for drinks ( can't even count how many times they've been in town in the past and we were unable to meet-up ) - finally, and luckily, we were able to hook-up. After several drinks and lively conversation going down memory lane, it was time to absorb the large quantities of alcohol we consumed with some serious eats. \n\nWe first walked to Delmonico's - booked solid ( good ! ) then to CUT - a 15 minute wait. A nice cocktail at the bar ( further inebriation ) and whisked off to the dining room. \n\nI'll limit my review to what i ate ( with one exception ) \n\nstarted with the bone marrow flan with the mushroom marmalade and parsley salad - Damn ! and i mean DAMN - that was good ! very minor issue - no parsley salad - WHO CARES ! \n\nI had the sirloin three ways - basically american, american kobe and japanese wagyu - perfectly cooked, great flavor, we all agreed, surprisingly, that the American Kobe had the best flavor. \n\nHad sides of mushrooms, asparagus and the mac n cheese. The fav - the M&C - of what little i had of it since one of my fellow diners held on to the serving spoon for dear life and used it to shovel the M&C into her piehole ! \n\nThe only comment on one of my dining mates main entree - the short ribs - slow cooked for a million hours with pumpkin curry, blah blah blah - the curry was too strong, also too sweet. funny thing is, the dish reminded me of my mom's home-cooked saurbraten ( given Chef Puck's lineage is this coincidence ? or was i too drunk to know any better ! ) \n\nOverall, I was very pleased with the meal but damn it ! I felt bad because my friends flipped the bill - as we all know this place ain't cheap ! they kindly insisted given my past generosity to them when we first became friends - i was very flattered by this - it's nice to know i had a positive impact on the lives of others ! \n\nHappy Eating !"

This a steakhouse that combines top quality meat with very mediocre cooking to produce mediocre tasting fine steak.  i.e. a total waste of fine ingredients.\n\nCUT uses the same intense 5 spice rub for all its steaks.  This marinade is delicious and does a great job on adding flavor to a nice cut of steak you'd pick up at Safeway or Whole Foods.  But when you are ordering a $135 cut of marbled and hand fed wagyu beef that or corn-fed prime Nebraska beef this is NOT the right way to prepare fine meat....we could barely taste the beef underneath the intense spices so but for the texture it might as well have been a $25 cut of sirloin from the corner store.  \n\nUnfortunately this overcooked style is common to most Wolfgang Puck restaurants.  As another example, the Kobe steak sashimi was prepared with a lovely soy vinagrette but then doused with so much of the sauce and with added salt so that  it was basically impossible to actually taste the steak underneath the small pond of sauce in the plate.\n\nAfter having dined at many fine steakhouses around the world we were looking forward to a great meal with some great local and imported cuts of steak, but instead paid almost $200 a person for a mouthful of spices smothering some otherwise  fine meat.  What a shame!\n\nOn a positive note, the service was very good and the decor and ambience of the restaurant are top notch."

I don't know what I expected going in, but I guess I'm used to Wolfgang Puck, his manic Euro-accent and his overpriced airport pizzas and didn't expect such a modern and impressively delicious restaurant. \n\nThe decor is very hip but not uncomfortably so -- I didn't walk in and immediately start second-guessing my own wardrobe and sense of cool. It's also tucked away from the casino so you feel like you're in an actual restaurant vs. hearing the ching-ching-bloo-ba-doo-blee-bloo of slot machines in the distance. \n\nWe got seated and waited five minutes at the most for the waiter to come by and greet us/take our order. Not a big deal -- he even acknowledged us right away and said he'd be right with us. We didn't think anything of it, but apparently the staff felt it was a big deal because they offered to comp us two glasses of wine and our dessert at the end of the meal for the \"inconvenience.\" I was blown away by the hospitality. \n\nBut enough about the service, let's get to the food, damnit! I had a kobe beef carpaccio appetizer that was absolutely delicious -- it had great Asian flavors and was mouth-meltingly delectable. The steaks were also fantastic -- they recommend ordering one under what you're accustomed to (I eat medium rare so I ordered a rare) because the steak temperatures can rise due to their cooking methods. My steak turned out perfect. The waiter recommended a pairing sauce but the meat was so good that it didn't need it. For sides we went with the creamed spinach (best I've had at a restaurant) and macaroni and cheese (so good). I can't exactly remember the dessert but it was also pretty good. \n\nAll in all, while CUT is one of the more expensive restaurants I've eaten at, the food quality and service make the cost completely justified. One of the best high-end steak restaurants I've had the pleasure of eating at."

EVERYTHING from the service, atmosphere, and food was Perfect!  We paid a pretty penny for our experience here but it was all worth it!!!  Plus when you are Vegas, you throw that budget book out the window as soon as you land.\n\nLet me start by telling you that our servers Ben and Chance were very very attentive and not overbearing and annoying whatsoever.  They catered to our every need and recommended some great selections in our food choices.  Chance even gave us some advice on some great Dim Sum restaurants to visit as well!  They even walk you to the bathroom instead of telling you where it is....pull out your chair for you...and even place your napkin in your laps.  They also bring samples of what the cuts of Meats look like before you order. They have traditional cuts along with expensive Waygu beef for those of you feeling like a high roller.  The service was amazing!\n\nNow on to the food...I eat steak pretty much on a daily basis and go out to quite a few steakhouses. I can tell you that CUT by Wolfgang Puck is THE BEST STEAKHOUSE in Vegas!!! I had a traditional Filet Mignon aged for 35 days medium rare and it was cooked to Perfection!!! It was crispy yet tender.  Juicy but not leaking. It was just...perfect!  I also ordered the Lobster on the side along with Macaroni and Finger Link potatoes and I can tell you that it was THE BEST we have ever tasted.\n\nI will definitely be coming back to CUT next time I am in Vegas!  Wolfgang Puck has definitely put his name on something spectacular!"

A great deal of salt was required just to bring it to a reasonable level of flavor.\nThe service was abysmal. Only 6 tables were occupied but getting attention was a constant effort.\nThe wine list is good but criminally overpriced, as are the steaks. The wines by the glass are rudimentary and show no imagination or care.\nThere are so many better steak joints here, both on and off the strip, that CUT just doesn't make the cut (okay, now you can shoot me).\nGo to Mastros, or Joe's, or even Envy for a better steak at a better price."

The American Wagyu is just fine for me but again that is a taste issue.  Their Nebraska corn feed steak is no better than any steak you could buy at any steak house but will still probably cost you twice the price at Cut. Salads, appetizers, and deserts were all good to excellent as Wolfgang usually does.\nWaite staff was very attentive, knowledgeable about the steaks, and friendly.  \nSo why 3 stars you ask?  \n\nCONS:  The dining room is getting a little dated over the years.  I found the seating and table to be uncomfortable.  The pricing is obscenely high even for Vegas.  Extensive but extremely expensive wine list for the majority of selections.  Noise level the night I was there was very loud as there was a large business meeting / group eating there that evening (often there is).  When  you spend this type of money on a meal  everything should be spot on!  \n \nPROS:  Overall excellent food and good service.\n \nYes I still recommend and would return."

Given that the place has the four dollar signs, I thought it would be top notch. My girl and I got a bone marrow flan, American wagyu filet mignon and ribeye with Mac and cheese and wildfield mushroom on the side. The bone marrow flan was very interesting and unique. When I first heard about it, I was very confused. Flan is supposed to be sweet, but this particular one was cooked in a bone marrow. Me no comprehender! The bone marrow was good. That's all I could say. It's hard to explain so jus try it lol wildfield mush was aiite. It had that typical mush taste with a lil saltiness. Mac and cheese was cheesy and creamy on a decent level. Now the finale 'drum roll' the steaks were okay.. My ribeye was so plain that I thought maybe I was supposed to get a sauce.. And the thing is the meat itself wasn't exquisite like the waiter explained. It jus tasted like usda black angus prime beef in my opinion. There was nothing wagyu about it. For that reason, I give this restaurant three stars. Nothing extraordinary. Just plain."

So then I decide to order a chilled tequila to go with my Stella, which replaced the Heineken, in a martini glass straight up and a patron next to me takes an interests and asks the bartender, I'll have what he's having only to have a draft beer given to him.\n\nNext we are finally seated in a HUGE booth that had a view of every seat in the room, nice, but we are only a party of two, so it was a little much, but no complaints.  After a half hour of watching every party larger than two being seating and served in the room our waiter finally got around to taking our order, and mind you our drinks are now empty, and he never asked if we wanted another round, \"just do you know what entrees you'd like?\"  Unbelievable for what's suppose to be a classy joint.\n\nFinally the food arrives, I ordered the bone-in rib-eye medium rare only to have it still mooing, no sear or seasoning on it and my wife ordered the filet mignon medium rare only to have hers served medium and dry, so after an hour and a half of this lack luster performance we decide to forget about sending things back because we only had a weekend in town and only god would have known how long it would of taken them to re-fire our dinner, but figured instead we would something to management on the way out.  My wife asked to speak to the general manager instead of me doing so because I was ready to break him in half for ignoring us for wanting to speak with him about what we had just experienced at this fine dining establishment, but that turned out to be a joke as well, he offered nothing but excuses and no apology either, but would give a free appetizer next time we came in.

I had heard much about it and were looking forward to seeing if the hype lived up to the expectations.  Overall, food and wine were excellent but the price would probably keep us from going back soon.\n\nFor appetizers, my husband chose the tuna tartare and I had the butter lettuce salad with avocado, bleu cheese and a herb champagne vinagrette.   After we ordered the waiter informed us these were two of the most popular and I can see why. Both were fantastic.  The waiter brought around 4 different types of fresh bread.  I had the onion focaccia which was excellent, and my husband the sourdough which was also good.\n\nFor the main course, I had selected the 6 oz American Wagyyu filet mignon, and my husaband selected the Petite New york cut, both prepared medium rare.  My husband thought his was a bit overseasoned with pepper, but I thought his tasted good.  My steak was excellent, one of the best I have ever had.  But $75 for 6 oz is a lot of $$.  I think most people who probably eat here aren't necessarily concerned about prices. The steaks come with three types of mustard for dipping, two of which were excellent.  We also go the house steak sauce (by far the best of all the sauces) and a herb shallot red wine bordelaise that was tasty also.  All sauces are served on the side so that you can try a variety. \n\nOur sides were the Mac and Cheese and creamed spinach with organic egg.  Both were excellent.  The egg gave the creamed spinach a really nice texture, and the mac and cheese was a bit of a twist on an old staple.\n\nWe were stuffed so didn't order dessert, although they gave us some small bites of lemon and chocolate bars which were just enough and tasted excellent.  \n\nOverall this was a great dinner, but we ended up spending over $400 on just the two of us, so it would be hard to justify going again."

I have to say, the only thing I would be disappointed about, was the portions of the dishes, for the price, it could've been bigger.\n\nThe entrees were delicious, all the steaks were cooked to perfection, and we all had different cuts.  The side dishes were delicious.\n\nThe dessert was delicious, what can I say?  They also gave us the booth seating that had the view of the whole dining room, was intimate and at the same time, we were able to see everything.\n\nWe had a great time, it is pricey, but for the 5 of us the bill came to under $600, so not too bad and we had cocktails.\n\nI would definitely go again."

Ordered 2 sauces but didn't end up needing them as the steak was fantastic on its own. Took the additional caramelized onion topping and it went very well with the steak. Highly recommended - I am definitely returning.!!"

The service was impeccable from the moment we walked in their door. We stared with a couple of cocktails. My wife had the Monroe's Passion (which is an incredible drink) and I had a 30 year old single barrel bourbon Manhattan (which was the best Manhattan that I have ever had), We had an incredible appetizer (Langostino w/Cavier) and chose the 32 oz. USDA Prime Porterhouse for two, It was the BEST steak we have ever had. It was grilled to medium rare perfection and the attention to the correct amount of seasoning was spot on. We also had their Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg that was a perfect side dish for the steak. We had expert assistance from the CUT sommelier Christine Barr in picking out a great bottle of French Bordeaux red wine. For dessert my wife had the Baked Alaska and I had a special dessert for the evening which was a Gold Sugar Sphere. If you ever have the opportunity to have dinner at CUT in the Palazzo Hotel while you are in Las Vegas, do it without hesitation. There is a reason why Wolfgang Puck is such a respected chef and business person. He is one of the pioneers of his field and he is certainly one of the best. The next time we are in Las Vegas we will go back to CUT for sure!"

Our server had just about a -2 personality on a scale of 0 to 10, it was just bland and boring (the experience and the food). Apparently  the corn is what everyone is crazy about. If the best thing on your menu is corn, I think you should revisit things...\nJust my opinion.\n\nWe ordered tuna tartar, corn salad, poached egg and asparagus, the crab louis appetizer. Everyone at the table got steak (rib eye, filets) and someone got the sea bass, which they de-bone for you upon bringing to your table on a cart, which was pretty neat.\n\nI ordered my steak medium, confirmed that it would be \"pink in the center\", no blood. The steak showed up burnt on the outside, so I was really itching to cut into this thing. Sure enough, well done. I think it sat under a heat lamp for nearly 20-30 minutes. The staff was really apologetic and brought me a new steak quickly, but I wouldn't expect anything less when paying $65 for 8oz of meat. It still didn't blow my socks off.\nFor sides we ordered: mushrooms, corn, brocollini and a couple others - they were OK.\n\nFor a good steak, head over to Mastro's - always. You can't go wrong.\nThis place just did not do it for me."

As far as ambiance goes, it does lack that \"wow this is special feeling\" you get from special views or environment's (I'm thinking of Bartolotta @ Wynn, Hugo's Cellar downtown in particular). However, Cut more than makes up for it through the service & food.\n\nCost: 3. When I'm Vegas, I have a tendency to ignore menu prices altogether and I hope most of you end up doing the same.  Cut's expensive, just like the rest of Vegas' Strip restaurants are.  Accept it for what it is, and hope blackjack goes your way.\n\nFood Quality: 5. In the \"what's your last meal alive scenario\", I always think of myself as more of a seafood person.  That said, Cut surely makes me rethink my preference.  Filets, Rib Eye, Steaks we all got were outstanding (across the board, from the basic 8 oz filet to 35 day ribeye).  Some in our party also did the Sirloin tasting, which is probably one's best option looking back to be able to try a few different items.  Sides & sauces were all exceptional.  The questionable: appetizers. Crab & Carolina shrimp was great, but felt like others we ordered were more average, mainly the oxtail/bone marrow dumplings and tuna tartare.  All that said, if you avoid the appetizer minefield you're in for a real treat.\n\nService: 5. We never had problems getting drinks almost immediately, two in our party were late and the staff was more than accommodating, and our waiter was very knowledgeable on best menu options for individuals.  In other words, we didn't get upsold on more expensive wine/steaks at any point and the service was very accommodating.

Unfortunately, our table wasn't ready yet which is not the restaurant's fault; however, they offered us a seat at the bar area and gave us complimentary wasabi peas, peanuts, and olives while we waited.  We were seated immediately when the time rolled around and got a booth that faced the dining area - great for people watching.  The ambiance is a bit loud and rowdy, but the dim lighting made it feel quite romantic as well.  We had two servers that night, and they offered us complimentary bread, parmesan breadsticks, and some puffs, which I didn't try.  The waiter also brought out the tray of raw meat so he could explain the different marbling in each of the steaks.  Quite impressive and definitely something I've never seen at any other steakhouses.\n\nI ordered the petit cut filet mignon 8 oz cooked medium well with the house made steak sauce on the side.  For the sides, it was family style so we shared the asparagus and brussel sprouts.  I liked how they portioned out the sides for us. I must say, I was originally planning to eat half of my steak because 8 oz is too much for me, but after one bite, I was hooked.  The top and bottom of the steak were crunchy and crispy while the middle was nice and soft.  The contrast of the different textures in every bite was amazing. What made it even more amazing was their house made steak sauce.  It was tangy and flavorful, and I noticed that I would dip each slice generously into the sauce.  So good I can drink it. :)  Wish they sold it because I would have brought back a bottle.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate souffle, which was pretty big.  Once they brought it out, the server sliced a hole in the middle and poured whipped cream inside and placed a spoonful of nutella on top.  It was delicous! We finished it all in less than 3 minutes.  You would think that would be the last course to end the night, but nope! They offered us a plate of mini desserts - marshmallow, meringue, lemon tart, and jelly - on the house.  \n\nOf course, the price for the dinner was outrageously expensive, but that's a given when you're eating at a steakhouse in Vegas. I thought it was worth it, and you should too. \n\nTip: the restaurant is located inside the Shops at the Palazzo."

I went here as part of my boys bachelor party.  Let me start with the dinning environment:  Very clean with a slight industrial feel.  The swivel chairs were a very nice change from the clunky wooden chairs you see in most places.  It also helps to get my fat ass in and out of the table a lot easier.  Trust me.... after this meal.. you kinda wanna roll back to your room for a cigarette.\n\nAppetizers:  Bone Marrow Flan, Kobe Sashimi, and Maple Glazed Pork Belly. \n ALL ON POINT~!!!  The bone marrow flan was so rich and buttery.  It literally makes your eyes roll back as you take a bite of it off the small crestini.  The Kobe sashimi was fresh and light.  The beef was velvety dressed with only a little olive oil and capers.  This is a must try.  And then came the maple glazed pork belly.  Sweet.... savory... rich... flavorful.... wow....\n\nSides:  Creamed Spinach and roasted potatoes.   \nLet me preface by saying... I am not a fan of creamed spinach in any variation.  So to me, this dish was bound for failure.  The spinach was topped with a fried egg that was mixed in table-side and served to us.  The rest of my table loved it.  I was not a big fan.  No slight to the chef... just personal preference.  It was good, but not my cup of tea.  The potatoes however were great!  Roasted simply with some onions and garlic.  Sometimes good technique and simplicity just win out.  And this side was a prime example of that.\n\nMain: American Wagyu New York Steak\nIf you go to a restaurant like this, you dont order the chicken.  You shell out the money and get the best that they offer.  The American wagyu choices were organic beef from Idaho, I believe.  The moment my knife touched the soft medium rare beef, I was sure that my knife and fork were the luckiest utensils in the world.  They were the first to make love to that meat.  I have never in my life tasted beef of this magnitude.  The flavor was so unique and undoubtedly unforgettable.  The beef melted in my mouth as I could not believe something that was only rubbed in salt and pepper, had this much flavor.  Like I said before, If you come here.  Go for the American Wagyu.  Pricey?  yes.  Absolutely worth it?  Hell F***ING YES~!!!\n\nWine:  Malbec.\nRan the decision by the sommelier and she said that was a great choice.  Great wine with the meal.  Soft flavors, smooth finish, not too much bite.  The wine was a hit with the table.  But at this point.... everything was a hit from this place.  \n\nCongrats Alex!  Hope you enjoyed your last meal~!!!"

And the service was excellent, the server was very charming :-) so one star for that. They have a wide selection of wine and drinks. But for the price of over $100 a person, the rib eye steak ($61) was a lil overcooked, and the caramelized onions contained too much honey, making it for a overpowering sweetened flavor. I ordered the true japanese wagyu beef from kagoshima ($160) and although I know that it is suppose to be so fatty and that's why people enjoy it, I personally felt that it was way too fatty towards the end, and couldn't finish it because it upset my stomach. I don't really know how anyone can finish a whole one to themselves. I guess it would've tasted better if it was shared where everyone takes only a bite or two . The lamb chop ($48) was waaaayyy too overcooked, but yet we saw many tables ordering it. Although i don't particularly enjoy flan, everyone seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed the bone marrow flan with mushroom marmalade and parseley salad. Most of the sides with your entree is about $12-13 each side, the potato puree, onion rings, sweet potato puree, french fries, soft polenta with parmesan, creamed spinach with fried organic egg...etc were good but I felt that it was nothing special.   Their garlic bread appetizer and tuna tartar was delicious but not worth $24 a plate. The shrimp  in the shrimp cocktail was not fresh and i've had better garlic fries at gordan biersh.The one appetizer we ordered 3 plates of, one after another, because it was sooo amazing was the kobe steak sashimi (definitely worth $22 a plate, and I suggest this is a must try! but for those that don't like eating raw meat, trust... it'll change your whole view on it) - Overall great experience, but I just feel that it is nothing special especially for how costly it is- and too much hype."

            "review": "There's a couple of things to mention first: \n1.  I don't tend to like Wolfgang Puck restaurants - at least not since dining at Spago in the mid 90s.  He puts his name on a lot and I don't know that he pays attention to any of his endeavors.\n2.  We can be food snobs - we live in San Francisco and visit Vegas frequently.  We have dined in many fine restaurants over time.  We always have high expectations in restaurants where the per head bill is over $100.\n\nSo what was our verdict?  While we had very high expectations, we were not prepared to be totally blown away, which is what happened.\n\nIt really was a perfect evening.  The service, which is done in teams without anyone missing a beat, was incredibly attentive but NOT intrusive.  The food was superlative.  The atmosphere was hip, modern and pleasant.  \n\nTo start, don't fill up on the bread - and there's lots of it - from Parmesan covered breadsticks, to cheese in puff pastry, to the bread basket with pretzels, breads and foccacia, you can make a meal of the bread.\n\nThe food was also not as expected.  It's hard to put inventive twists on normal dishes, but they managed to do so.  The Tuna Tartare had unique flavors, came with great toast crisps and wasabi aoili.  It also had beautiful slices of avocado on top and presented as a perfect terrine.  Normally portions for appetizers, particularly raw tuna, are very small - this was not.  And the taste was outstanding.  I had tuna tartare the previous night at another great restaurant and it didn't compare.\n\nThe Asparagus Salad was so nicely presented it was almost a shame to cut into it.  Each of the very thin, tender asparagus spears were perfectly lined up on a piece of brioche with a perfectly cooked poached egg gently placed on top.  \n\nI had the dry aged Nebraska Rib Eye (boneless) 16 oz.  It was a beautiful piece of meat, perfectly char grilled medium rare and with very little fat.  It was juicy, tender and perfect.  My wife had the Korobuta pork chop.  Korobuta pork is the kobe beef of pork.  It was also moist, juicy and tasted great.  Our sides?  Fingerling potatoes with bacon confit and Onion Rings.  Both of them were perfect, but the tempura onion rings were phenomenal.  \n\nNow my wife is a chocolate snob - she has very high standards for chocolate desserts.  She was driven to orgasmic delight by the chocolate souffle.  I, who don't like chocolate all that much, thought it was great too.\n\nI had trouble deciding between the lemon filled doughnuts and peach/blackberry crumble with 50 bean vanilla ice cream.  The waitress steered me towards the crumble and it was wonderful... they bring it out in a hot metal baking dish and spoon it into a bowl at the table.\n\nWe found out why the waitress steered me away from the doughnuts... it was my birthday and they brought me out a birthday dessert sampler which had, among other things, a lemon custard filled doughnut... the waitress was great about not spoiling the surprise and allowing me to enjoy both desserts I wanted.  \n\nSo some final thoughts: \n1.  Don't go if you aren't prepared for a very expensive evening - it's not cheap.  If the price tag will ruin your experience then this isn't the place for you.\n2.  The wait staff was excellent.  We were never steered to the most expensive items, she listened to what we told her our tastes were and made recommendations based on that.\n3.  If you have a martini, the blue cheese stuffed olives are incredible.\n4.  There is a big difference between wet aged, dry aged and kobe beef.  They explained very well all the differences and will help guide you to a great experience if you let them.  Let them know your preferences in seasoning as well as in flavor and cooking style.  They really will try to do it your way...\n5.  A la carte is what every steakhouse does.  As annoying as it is, Cut isn't the only one to do it.  If A La Carte will bother you, then this may not be the place for you.  \n6.  This is both a great place for a romantic dinner and a great place for a group get together.  \n7.  This is a great place to just go and enjoy a fine meal and let the troubles of the world (and the losses at the tables) melt away.  Go and enjoy!"

I was a bit skeptical when I made reservations because I think WP has over-extended himself in Vegas now... is it 6 restos he has?\n\nThat being said, I think he does a fabulous job here.  A group of 5 of us came and the table consensus was that the steaks were amazing.  Awesome decor, very masculine, and I loved the spinning chairs.  the wine list is extensive and excellent... for those on expense accounts, you can have your choice of \"esoteric wines\" to boot :)\n\nThe group ordered a variety of salads to start, and I had the apple salad with walnuts and dates - unique and delicious.  Crisp and tartness in the apples offset with a hint of cinnamon.\n\nFor steaks, a variety was ordered around the table including the porterhouse, NY Sirloin and a friend ordered the scallops.  I went for the American Wagyu after the server showed the different cuts (the Japanese Wagyu looked a little too fatty to me).  The steaks were excellent - nicely flavored and well cut.  It was my first time ordering a Wagyu and the meat is a bit fattier than what I'm used to with the marbling, but it was delicious.\n\nThe sides were a bit weak - these are served family style here so we had fries (very good), the broccoli (so-so) and the mushrooms (so-so).\n\nIt's pricey but I thought it was worth every penny... even my cheap-ass husband agreed, aside from the sides.\n\nAnyone who's also on a low-carb diet should consider forgoing it for the night... there are a few breadsticks to start, but this is followed by a bread service which is excellent.  A server presents a selection of breads on a platter... you MUST try their special bread.  It's got a soft pretzel with salt like taste and is TDF.  Can't wait to come back."

We went to Vegas this weekend and after Rehab we all put 100.00 down on black and won so decided to celebrate here. The server brought out some pretzel bread and foccachia which were both awesome. We started with Kobe Shashimi and the Bibb Lettuce Wedge. The Kobe was hands down the best thing I have ever eaten. It was soft and silky and the micro salad on top of it went perfect. The Bibb was good too but no one really cared for it because the kobe was that awesome. We all got the 20oz prime bone in ribeye, some mac and cheese, potato tartin, and garlicky spinach. The mac and cheese and potato were awesome but the spinach was just ok. The steak was cooked perfect and we even had the bone marrow put on top which made everything melt in your mouth. The service was awesome and our tab was 325.00 for 3 people with no alcohol. I highly recommend this place!"

We got an array of appetizers, the pork belly was probably the run away winner.  The majority of us got the dry aged ribeye, which is smaller than the other option.  The flavor is much better on the dry aged version, it's worth the extra price and losing a little in terms of the size of the steak.  The service was excellent.  We never were wanting for a wine pour and our water glasses were never empty.  \n\nI will say that Carnevino is my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, with the riserva ribeye being my favorite steak ever.  This is also located in the Palazzo.  But, Cut is excellent, right up there with any steakhouse in the city.  If you are at Venetian or Palazzo, both Cut and Carnevino are highly recommended.  Keep in mind, Cut is expensive, so plan accordingly."

This time, it was the Las Vegas location (in the Palazzo) that was going to have to try and match my prior experience, and I have to say, they exceeded my expectations. My three friend who also were with my for our guys weekend in Vegas also thought this was the best steakhouse they have ever been to as well.\n\nOnce again, the atmosphere is very modern for a steakhouse, but I like that, its nice for a change. The staff is tremendous, but this is no shock for a restaurant of this caliber. I can't comment on the sommelier because I selected are wine, but he did present it very professionally (did the whole little swirl in each glass pre-pour trick).... have to love excess. For appetizers, we orders some type of butter lettuce salad which was very good and a couple of the tuna tartare appetizers, and this is by far one of the best tartar's I have ever had. I essentially forced my table to order a couple of these because of how much I enjoyed it last time I had it (they also loved it). This  may not seem like enough for four men in Vegas, but that leads me to the bread. Our table easily consumed 5  Focaccia Loafs, 6 Pretzel Loafs, and 3lbs of butter....I don't think I need to say anymore on the quality of the bread. Everyone ordered NY Strip's, mine was from Nebraska, and once again, it is the best steak I have ever had (their seasoning/rub is out of this world). No dessert for us... we were too full.\n\nAfter my second visit I can comfortably say two things: 1) This is my FAVORITE STEAKHOUSE and 2) I hope to God they are going to build one in Chicago."

After a couple drinks I started to get impatient due to my hunger and slight drunken state.  So to prevent myself from saying or doing anything stupid I didn't talk.  Our fine hostess who reminded me of Lisa Loeb brought us to our table which was smack right in the front.  Sucky location if you tell me.  So our waitress gave a presentation/quick tutorial on the different steaks available.  \n\n(NOTE:  If your willing to splurge, get the Wagyu beef.)\n\nSo they have Illinois dry aged.  Then Nebraska raised beef also aged.  Up one level to American Kobe beef, and the ultimate, Japanese Wagyu beef.  You can clearly see the uniform marbling of the meat and fat.  (Fat is important, which gives the beef the taste)  I've only had Kobe once, and not here but to describe the taste is like eating butter and melting in your mouth)\n\nFor starters, we had a selection of various breads and cheese puffs.  Which were to die for.\n\nAs for my order, I had the Illinois, BONE-IN rib-eye medium rare, with a side of creamed spinach.  MY friends ordered the eggplant gratin, corn, mashed potatoes and vegetable mix with morels.   The food was off the hook!

            "review": "We had a very disappointing experience at CUT this past Saturday night.   Both service and food were not what should be expected at this price point.  \n\nNot surprising, given that it was a Saturday evening and a holiday weekend, the restaurant was busy.   However, that ought not be a surprise for management and staff and if there are not enough folks to provide service, then do not book as many tables.   And possibly skip the sort of silly \"meat presentation\" that seems to take a fair amount of time and effort. \n\nWe ordered cocktails almost immediately upon being seated.  A few minutes later, we saw a bar cart that was going to certain tables, but never visited ours.  We would likely have utilized it, as it took a solid half-hour to get our cocktails.  Not a great start.  \n\nOur waiter was very nice but appeared way over extended.  He indicated at the outset that he and another server would be helping us but the other server never appeared.  \n\nThe menu is fine, but a little unimaginative.  My partner wanted a steak, but I did not and the other entree choices were just not very interesting at least as described.  I would have expected a restaurant of this caliber and serving a diverse and international clientele to have a vegetarian entree, but there was not one.  And although they touted the fresh white truffles on the menu (and I would have ordered them) there was no obvious place for them--no pastas or risottos were offered, for example.  \n\nWe ordered two starters, the butter lettuce salad with avocado and champagne vinegarette and the asparagus with a poached egg and bacon dressing.  The butter lettuce salad was exceptional and the dressing was perfect.  The asparagus was less successful--the asparagus itself was undercooked, and thus hard to cut, while the poached egg was overlooked, which defeats the purpose of runny deliciousness.  \n\nThis should have foreshadowed what was coming next.  We had ordered the 12 ounce ribeye, the tuna tartare, and three sides (potato pur\u00e9e, mushrooms, and brussels sprouts) for our main course.  Again, the restaurant seemed overwhelmed, in that it took about fifty minutes after our appetizers were cleared to get served.  During that time, we were pretty much ignored which was a loss for the restaurant as we would have ordered another round of cocktails.  \n\nWhen the meal finally arrived, it was immediately clear that the steak was way over cooked--it was supposed to be medium rare and was way closer to medium well.  We had to wave down a passing server who acknowledged the fault and took the steak away to be replaced. Meanwhile, we snacked on my tuna tartare and the side dishes.  The potato pur\u00e9e is very solid, and the mushrooms (which at twenty one dollars were a pricy side) were also good.  The brussels sprouts were over salted to the point of being inedible.  \n\nWhen the steak finally reappeared, it was a very good piece of steak, but the kitchen had again blasted it with salt, using the large salt crystals that are so in vogue.   It was a shame because that compromised the excellent quality of the meat, which was cooked perfectly--this time.   \n\nWe then got the check which came with some complementary small candies.  As was the case throughout, service was well meaning but slow and muddled. \n\nAt this price point, and this being one of the flagship restaurants of the Puck empire, the experience should be top notch.   At several points, people recognized service shortcomings (our waiter, when acknowledging a half-hour was a long wait for a cocktail) but little seemed t be done to correct them.   Even on the Las Vegas strip, guests should not be treated as though they are fungible, or should consider themselves lucky to be there.   Indeed, for many people dining at a restaurant like CUT may be the anticipated highlight of their vacation or visit and the restaurant and its staff should try to fulfill that anticipation for every person that walks in the door.  We won't be back (this was our third visit) nor recommending CUT for visitors.  A shame, because the room is interesting and the concept of a hipper steakhouse appealing---but you can get that all at STK and probably should."

            "review": "My friends and I recently dined at Cut to celebrate forthcoming nuptials.  Not that I needed an excuse to come here, but the only thing better than good food and drink is good company.  On to the review.\n\n*Beef*\nThe quality of the beef was very impressive, but not world class.  The best thing on the menu was ribeye wagyu from New Zealand.  The marbling was not comparable to more upscale wagyu, like Tajima, but for the uninitiated, the beef served at Cut is more than sufficient.  I ended up ordering ribeye from a wagyu/Angus crossbreed.\n\n*Preparation*\nThe steak was cooked perfectly.  Moist and pink, with the appropriate amount of char.  The mustard sauce was the best.\n\n*Drink*\nAbove average beer menu for a steakhouse.  I started the evening with a tripel from Westmalle; the citric, yeasty notes went well with the appetizers.  The steak was paired with a generic pinor noir from Oregon.  The scotch menu needs some serious revamping.\n\n*Sides*\nUnimpressive, but Cut doesn't offer course menus, so it was expected.\n\n*Dessert*\nI had a generic souffle.  Nothing to write home about\n\nOverall, the perfect place to have steak with the guys.  It's not a dining experience as much as it is a place to get your steak cooked properly."

The waiters go above and beyond... they're helpful, pay attention to detail, and educate (a bit too much... i don't care if Voss water is from Norway!!)  Service wise it was what you'd expect from a top notch steakhouse.  They bring out the steaks on a platter, of course pointing to the most expensive Waygu Ribeye and recommending it very heavily.  \n\nI went with the bone-in ribeye and was disappointed.  Granted, I'm very particular of my steaks and steakhouses.  I kept on thinking how I could make a better steak myself.  I ordered the steak medium rare, but it was more of a medium cook.  It had a dryness that didn't bod well with me.  I was surprised the marbling and bone didn't give the steak much flavor either.  \n\nSides were good.  Mac and cheese was mac and cheese.  Solid, but nothing special.  Potatoes were good, went well with the steak.\n\nI've heard some people say that they love this steakhouse, which I find surprising.  With so many other great steakhouses in Vegas, I wouldn't come here again."

            "review": "Every review says to expect good service, but I did not know how truly outstanding it would be. I brought my partner here for our anniversary and we have never been treated so well at a restaurant. As an interracial lesbian couple with a big age gap we are used to some quizzical looks or even questions, there was none of that here. Every member of the staff treated us with the utmost respect. The meal service itself was like a well choreographed ballet, which is harder than it looks. (reminded me of that episode of Will & Grace where Jack gets Will to be his cater waiter). The servers were charming and funny, not pretentious or stuffy in the least. My girlfriend has a serious Gluten allergy and they were so gracious about accommodating her, they never acted as if it was a hassle. They even had the pastry chef make a gluten free Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 which was presented very nicely. This was a big deal because my baby used to love souffl\u00e9s but hasn't had one since discovering her allergy a long time ago. \n\nOk, on to the food... \nLobster- We don't eat beef or pork but I brought her to this steakhouse for the lobster with truffle sauce. It was every bit as good as it sounds. It is lightly roasted in the oven which gives a much nicer flavor than your typical steamed lobster. They cut it out of the shell and serve it table side, very neat! Truffle sauce was a tad sweet for me but she loved it.\n\nJidori rotisserie chicken- wow, they presented the whole bird, which was impressively cooked to perfection, then they took it back to the kitchen to carve it up for me. Very cool indeed. The sauce is not gluten free but they let me know in advance so I did not accidentally poison my girlfriend by sharing it with her. The chicken was nicely brined. Brining makes such a big difference and causes the chicken to be verry juicy, even the breast! This brine was a little bit sweeter and less herby than the Thomas Keller Bouchon one. The chanterelle mushrooms had a nice Marsala flavor to them. \n\nButternut Squash with crispy leeks- Delicious as it sounds, but it's a very rich and filling side dish. I think it also had pumpkin seeds and parsnips or something. Roasted just right, not too browned. It's gluten free. \n\nMy gf also loved her Sauvignon Blanc and I couldn't handle anymore booze so I had a nice pot of mint tea. \n\nPretzel and onion focaccia bread were crazy good but I wish they were served warm. Portions are huge, I was shocked to be served a whole chicken, lol! The food is very rich and they sure don't skimp on the butter. I don't eat beef, but there was some large T bone steak that people around us kept ordering, it smelled heavenly! I'm so glad I opted to come here instead of one of those stuffy French places where every dish is the size of a postage stamp and costs $40. When I like something, I want more, damn it!  So that concept does not appeal to me. I'm a petite girl but I eat a lot and I have no interest in spending $800 on my meal alone. You can bet your sweet ass I will be back here the next time I'm in town. You must try Cut, especially if you are celebrating something or you want to treat someone to a perfect dinner. After tip (tip extra because they work hard, take pride in their job and they deserve it), expect to spend around $100 per person, probably more if you are ordering bottles of wine or doing the Japanese steaks. The only thing that did not impress me was the corn fed beef on the menu. Um, hello...Food Inc.! Those beasts need their grass!"

Given that it is fine dining, we also expected excellent service which was significantly lacking. \n\nWe were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated promptly for our reservation. We had 3 people and were handed 2 menus and left to ourselves for 15 minutes before offered water. We asked for another menu and there was no apology. \n\nThe breadbasket was a nice touch with my favorite being the focaccia. The hot gruyere cheese puff was a bit sour and not to my taste.\n\nI ordered the filet medium and my friend had the ribeye medium rare. We were given the filet medium rare and ribeye medium. This I find unacceptable for such a reputable steakhouse! The waiter's response when we pointed out this discrepancy, was \"So...what do you want me to do about it?\" \n\nWe didn't want to sit and wait another 30 minutes for fresh steaks to emerge...so we actually just traded steaks. The steaks were perfectly seasoned, moist, and one of the most flavorful I have ever had.  That being said, I found the service almost offensive and will be trying somewhere new before returning."

            "review": "At one point, this might have been a Wolfgang Puck establishment, but it's now slid into being a Wolfgang Suck establishment. *chortle*\n\nWe came here for a friend's bachelor party, because he'd specifically requested that we get a great steak. The place he chose to get it at was CUT. We put on our fly gear, and headed on over. Our reservation was honored, and we were prepared to have a great meal that was befitting of the weight of the celebrity chef's name and the hefty price tag.\n\nOne of my friends ordered a Caesar salad, that he said was great, but pricey. He also got the maple pork belly appetizer which we all agreed was amazing. \n\nThen the meatsplainer (not his official title, as far as I know) came out to illustrate what each cut of steak looked like, and the marbling characteristics of each of the various dry-aging lengths. I went with the 14 oz. 35-day dry aged New York sirloin. To complement it, I chose 2 sauces: the Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho butter, (Which is actually Wasabi Yuzukosho Butter. Yuzukosho is a fermented paste made with yuzu, a Japanese citrus fruit, and kosho, chili peppers. If you're ever at an izakaya, it's the green paste that isn't wasabi.) and the Red Wine Bordelaise.\n\nBefore our steaks arrived, we were treated to a number of delicious breads. First some long pretzel sticks, second was a basket of really good cheese bread, (a much better version of the stuff that you get at a churrascurria) and last was a selection of bread that we were supposed to use with this roesmary, roasted black pepper, and French salt butter. I was totally jazzed about that.  It turns out that the butter's basically flavorless unless you get it with the small patch of seasoning that's on top of it. This would be a harbinger of things to come...\n\nI tend to like my steaks a little more cooked than most people, but when ours arrived, even my sensibilities were on alert when I saw the dry mass of meat on my plate. The menu says that they sear their steaks in a 1200 degree broiler. That hunk of flesh on my plate wasn't seared, it was charred. Unfortunately, our table had enacted harsh penalties for cell-phone usage during the meal, so I have no photographic proof of this calamity, but, I think everyone was kind of disappointed by the way their steak looked.\n\nI cut into mine, and while it was tender, it was bland. One of the guys in our group would say afterwards, \"You want to take that first bite of steak, and to just be like 'Oh my god, this is amazing', and that didn't happen.\" No seasoning on the steaks as far as I could tell. Maybe it all got burnt off. Who knows.\n\nI used the entirety of the butter sauce on my steak. The boredelaise sauce was pretty good, but since my steak had no moisture to speak of, I needed to put the richness back in. It's great that the sauces are good, but it seemed like my steak was just a vehicle for sauce. I could have had chicken and it honestly wouldn't have changed my experience at all. I would have been equally disappointed by the food.\n\nWe chose 4 sides to go with our food, fingerling potatoes, sauteed baby spinach and garlic, artichokes, and mac & cheese. Our waiter had told us that these sides were large, and sharable. They're tiny and overpriced. I think our group of 8 maybe got a spoonful of each. The artichokes were ok, but that was mainly because of the bacon. There were maybe 30 fingerling potato halves on the plate. That's not a lot of potatoes. They were ok, I was using them to figure out which sauces I liked best, but that was like $16. In what world can you justify charging 50 cents for a single steak fry? The spinach was freaking pathetic. Boiled spinach with undetectable garlic. If there's ever a version of Throwdown against Wolfgang Puck, I'm going to challenge him to make his sauteed spinach with garlic, and I'm going to win by unanimous decision.\n\nThe service was great, I have no complaints about any of that. This review is all based on what I feel was an average steak at high-end steak prices. I asked my friends afterwards what they thought, fully expecting that this group of more savvy steak connoisseurs would tell me how much better their choices were, but to a man, the entire group said that it was \"just ok\". This wasn't the worst steak I've ever had (that distinction is held by Delmonico's...which is oddly enough in the same section of this hotel...) but it's definitely in that bottom tier.\n\nWould not recommend for any occasion."

CUT fit the bill!\n\n1.  Service - 5 Star.  Very proactive, a whole team to help you, support you and to give you suggestions. Very knowledgeable and helpful when you cannot pick that right cut of meat.\n\n2.  Bread and Water - Nah, you are not in prison.  But the bread they come out with is really great and of course you have your choice of ice water (tap water) or bottled.  We're local so we stayed with the ice water.  But, the bread is really great. What was it, not sure... Yet, I give it 5 stars.\n\n3.  The Food - \n\nBone Marrow Flan and Steak Tartare - OK, we were being a bit risky with these two and they were simply awesome. The flan was moist nuggets of marrow that you put onto thin pieces of toasted bread.  The steak tartare was so delicious. 5 stars\n\nKobe Beef Short Ribs - Great flavor, not so great texture. I actually thought the indian spices on this were a good mix, and I like indian spices.  However, the texture of the meat was more crock pot vs. slow braised.  Meah, I have to give this two star.\n\nBone in Filet Mignon - Now, how many times can you say you had a bone in Filet?  Sure for a rib eye or other cuts, yet I never had it in a Filet. Our friends had this and I have to say, that this is 4 star for sure. \n\nThe ambiance here is very nice, elegant, yet comfortable. You do feel that you are seated in an open area due to the seating arrangements, so it seems less intimate, however, the lighting and all makes it just right.  The place is a bit noisy due to the loud music that they pipe in, otherwise, nice. 4 start here.\n\nPrice wise, the place is typical of a strip steak place, expensive.  Worth it overall."

The place looks really nice and modern inside. The service was amazing. Probably the best service I've ever had.\n\nOur server was very helpful and they start off by showing the different CUTs they have by bringing them to the table. So we decided to go with the kobe beef sashimi and american kobe filet and the 100% japanese wagyu ribeye.Now if you don't want to go with the kobe, the prices are actually really reasonable for a nice steakhouse. But if you want to splurge, definitely go with Kobe. The japanese ribeye was $180 for 8 ounces. The american kobe filet i believe was around $70-80.\n\nFirst the bread. the breads that they give you are really good. Nice to munch on before your meal. We started off with the beef sashimi and it was definitely more than I expected. Very plentiful in my opinion. I was expecting like very thing slices but the servings were very generous (maybe even a little too thick). I really enjoyed it. I think it was a perfect starter. We also ordered a side of the spinach. It was really good as it was almost soup like. The spinach was so finely chopped up but had a really good taste.\n\nI have to admit when you pay for a steak that costs $180 you want something big and juicy. What came was really small, BUT.. it was awesome!!! by far the most tender steak ive ever had. The way that the outside was charred perfectly but left the inside so tender and buttery was amazing. The same with the filet. The size of the steaks look small, but after finishing them, you definitely feel full. Steak just doesn't taste the same anymore.\n\nNow for the price, for 2 steaks 1 side and 1 appetizer, after tax and tip, $350. Well most of it was for the japanese kobe. Would I pay $180 for it again, maybe. If it was $100, most definitely. But I can't argue that it was the best steak I've ever had. Overall it's my favorite steakhouse so far.\n\nMaybe we shall visit it again this weekend =)\n\n***update***\n\n*The Filet Mignon Carpacio was the best appetizer I've ever had. It's not cheap but it's pretty awesome!*"

I made reservations and after some confusion with the hostess, we were finally seated at a table. BEWARE: when making reservations, please confirm that you want to sit in the dining room, not the lounge area. The \"lounge\" area is simply the front lobby where people come in and check in. For a nice steakhouse, I do not expect to sit in the front and have the whole world walking by watching me eat. Sorry if it sounds pretentious, but the \"lounge\" area does not have the same ambiance of the dining area. Anyways, after speaking to the manager, who was definitely someone who cared about our concerns, comped us our drinks for the rest of the evening. Very nice. Now for dinner. I've been to several upscale steakhouses, but I have never seen a sampler (or steak flight as I called it. LOL) of sirloin steaks. American Prime, American Kobe style and Japanese Wagyu. I've never had wagyu, so I thought this would be perfect to try all 3 meats side by side and figure out which one was the best. Apps were also amazing too: onion rings and cream spinach were ordered. When the meat arrived, I think I wet myself. The aroma alone could convert any vegan I know. Each meat was cooked medium and heavily seasoned (FYI- don't add any salt till you try it). The American Prime- 10+; the Kobe 10++; and Wagyu 9. The Wagyu is a little too rich for me. The kobe is just a perfect middle between the other 2. My gf ordered the fillet Mignon and she too was in love. I paired that with a glass each of the 2 Cabs on the wine list (the ones that you could buy by the glass). Sorry, I cant recall the vineyards. The meat was so good, that I actually recommend that you do not add any seasoning or sauces and drink water instead of wine. The meat alone is perfect and does not need anything else to add to it. My opinion of course. And the service alone was top notch. Its a Wolfgang Puck restaurant: you expect service and food to be the best. This place met and easily exceeded my expectations. However, the price is a little high, but worth it. This is a 2-3 times a year place to go for me. This is something I couldn't do monthly. The bill came out to about $300 for 2. This did not include the 3 glasses of wine and 1 mixed drink. Definitely want to check out the one in Beverly Hills in the future. So if you are lover of steaks, CUT is definitely a place you need to check out."

It's tucked inside the Palazzo near the casino and shops leading to the Venetian. Step through the doors and you're transported into a very friendly, contemporary and modern atmosphere, which I loved. \n\nI had reservations, which I strongly suggest, so there was no waiting to being seated at our table. The inside decor is very modern and sheik. The ambiance and lighting are very on par with what I would expect to this type of restaurant. \n\nAfter being seated, you get to peruse their menu and look at the options you have for appetizers and entrees. You can also order drinks via iPad when your server gets to you. Your server also brings out a giant platter and explains the cuts and types of steak that you can order! Very informative!\n\nShortly after ordering, the bread platters are brought around and you're asked which types you want. Being the fatty that I am, I asked to sample all of available breads.. heheh. My favorite was the cheesey bread! Eat as much as you want. \n\nNow onto the star of the show.. the steak. Oh wait, a very honorable mention goes to the supporting star, the bone marrow flan. What a perfect medley of flavor and texture to make this appetizer definitely a must try if you come here!\n\nFor steak, we opted for the American Wagyu, one rib eye and one sirloin. Both were cooked and served close to perfection. Definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life. The crust/sear on the steak was great and the flavor and doneness inside was amahhhzing. I would definitely recommend this type and cut of steak.\n\nOverall, the ambiance, amazing food and superb service match the price tag that comes with CUT. For just two people, the bill altogether (with tip and tax) came out to nearly $300. No drinks were had that night too, mind you. But definitely an experience and meal to remember. and hey, you're in VEGAS! Go big or just go home already.\n\n(FYI. If you choose/ask for 'still' water, they serve you VOSS water. Each bottle costs $9, mind you. That was an unexpected surprise when the bill came..)"

            "review": "The 2016 WSOP is winding down.  That means time to celebrate the successes!  What better place for a bunch of guys than one of Vegas' top tier steakhouses.\n\nConsistent since it's opening, producing quality starters and offering outstanding cuts of cow.  This is cut.\n\nOpen with a warm veal tongue, barely cooked, toothsome, dressed with a salsa verde that heightens the minerality is a must for tongue lovers.  Great contrast to the richness of the other top starters.\n\nContinue with a bone marrow flan.  Think of a savory flan, cooked in a beef bone, but instead of cream, the richness is from unctous bone marrow.  The accompanying mushroom marmalade adds tremendous earthiness and complexity.\n\nThe tempura chesapeke bay soft shell crab with black garlic chili aioli and cucumber salad is equally good.  The lighest, crisp, not oily coating near perfect.  Bite into it, and it oozes it's moist, creamy goodness.  The aioli perfect to add dimensionality, the cucumber salad, refreshes the palate for the next bite.\n\nNow the beef.  Cut offers a great selection of aged USDA prime beef from different producers across the US along with Snake River Farms (SRF) American Wagyu and A5 Miyazaki brand Wagyu.  All very well trimmed.  Aged examples are very tender with only a mild bleu cheese funk and punched up umame.  All are seared over a wood burning fire and finished in a broiler to give a sweet, bitter, smokiness.\n\nExcess food trivia:  when referring to Japanese wagyu, beef reared in different prefectures and towns equates to a brand.  Differences in brands can be staggering due to genetic variations in the breeding stock, climate, and rearing.  Miyazaki brand consistently scores in the top five.\n\nTip:  Japanese wagyu is solid by two ounces, six ounces minimum.  The beef is best enjoyed if cooked thick then sliced.  Add up the number of servings for the table and share the single cut.  (Our party of six ordered 24 oz as a NY Sirloin and shared it).  \n\nComparing the NY Sirloins; the Illinois corn fed 21 day aged is the Classic American steak.  Beefy, juicy, with some bite.  The Nebraska corn fed 35 day aged is more tender and has a gentle, funk to the flesh.  The SRF, very tender, rich with the fat coating the tongue, slightly sweet.  No umame finish.  The A5, very sweet, extremely tender, the fat is not oily but very clean, lacking viscosity.  \n\nWell designed sides.  The tempura onion rings for the dry aged adds crispness and sweetness, the wild mushrooms and shishito peppers dressed with mirin and yuzu, excellent in refreshing the palate and enhancing the sweetness of the Wagyu.\n\nOutstanding wine list focusing on US producers.  Some vintage depth.  Vegas resort pricing.\n\nExcellent steakhouse service, friendly, efficient, accommodating, and as talkative or unobtrusive as your party dictates.\n\nNot an inexpensive adventure.  Like with most top tier steakhouses, the meal is an indulgence in calories, fat, and $$$$.  Credit card roulette anyone?  This is Vegas!"

            "review": "I used to frequent Cut a lot, but for some reason, I feel that the quality of steaks has decreased over the years. I think a lot has to do with the amount of seasoning that Cut puts on the steaks, a little too much for my preference. I've had good and bad meals at Cut and I think it really has to do with the amount of seasoning that I get (even when I ask for less seasoning). The rib eye is really good and so are many of the other steaks that I have had here. I've been to Cut for birthday parties (large groups which they can handle) and with small groups. Cut is definitely on the higher end of the steakhouses in Las Vegas as it is in the Palazzo Hotel and so the cost per person is higher than some of the other steakhouses that I have been to. Service is great and very attentive, although the one time we tried to bring a bottle that we wanted to open (for a birthday, it was a bottle of Johnny Blue Label), they wouldnt let us open it. Overall,  a good steakhouse, but there are better places to go in Las Vegas."

While I believe CUT's food is near the best in Las Vegas, I actually believed Delmonico's had a slight edge with service and I am just a big fan of ribeye in general.  \nHowever, this past week, the impeccable service at CUT made me a true believer.  The general manager Gianni Toffonello is extremely professional and did all the small things necessary to make our dining experience truly amazing.  \nWe were there last night to treat our good friend to one last blissful dinner before his deployment to Afghanistan.  Among the people in our group, we tried the Japanese Kobe, American Wagyu Filet, and Waygu New York Sirloin.  The quality of the beef was apparent with each bite.  And most importantly, there was no flaw in the service.  I am a HUGE believer in customer service and I believe that when my friends and me are treated with respect, it makes me want to share my excitement about the restaurant with the rest of the world.\nI have no doubt that I will be returning to CUT during my next trip to Las Vegas.  It is now a staple of any Vegas trip."

Erin, the server, was helped by about 6 others and was so attentive without being pushy or intrusive. There were four of us at the table, and we each had two cocktails. The bartender is quite talented, and knew how to make our favorites as well as produce some of the more creative and refreshing drinks I've encountered. Each was truly high quality and delicious.\n\nAppetizers: We were served amuse bouches and various breads with butter - each was a fantastic mix of flavors. We ordered the burrata with prosciutto, melon and fig. Cannot remember a better, more outstanding bite of food. And the tuna tartare, aside from being the best presentation I've seen of this dish, was also fresh, buttery, and delightful.\n\nWe all ordered the grass-fed filet mignons. What a spectacular steak, expertly prepared and just lovely. The sides - spinach with garlic, roasted fingerling potatoes with bacon, and mac-and-cheese were elegant, tasty, and complemented the steaks perfectly.\n\nDessert (can't remember, however!) was also wonderfully presented and served, and a great end to our dinner.\n\nIf you are in Las Vegas and looking to have a luxurious, satisfying experience, try CUT."

And while I think that I've had the best of the best, and the worst of the worst, I must say that after all my years on this earth I feel like I have wasted them all until I ate at CUT. \n\nI'm exaggerating, yes. But you know what? One bite of a steak at CUT tasted like heaven. Here I was, lalala-ing about how I've had so much good food in my life, and then one bite of a petit (haha) NY strip steak made me want to jump out of my seat and sing from the rooftops and fields in Europe. Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!\n\nI guess I've been selling myself short... I've never had a dry aged steak before. I never thought steak would taste so good, let alone without soy sauce (filipino thing). It was grilled on some wood grill and then fired in a billion degree oven with all these spices. Ahh, yes. And the peppercorn sauce that I got along with it? DELIGHTFUL. HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. The side dishes: fingerling potatoes with bacon confit and caramelized pearl onions, mac n cheese, sauteed spinach, creamed spinach... all very good too. My cousin and I indulged in that yummy bone marrow flan... all delightfully good. The side dishes may not have been a good idea, as it was a struggle to even finish my steak. But I finished it. If my steak was $55 dollars, all of it better be in my stomach by the end of the night.\n\nI don't exaggerate the greatness of CUT... the next night I found myself at a restaurant back home in SF and I pretty much ordered the same thing: steak, sides, etc. Once I took a bite and swallowed that piece of meat, I sighed. CUT basically ruined steak for me. Not that the steak that I was having at the time wasn't good, it's just that it didn't have the same juiciness and tenderness of the previous steak. It made me question my eating habits, the way I choose my food, the way I live my life. Ugh, it was so delicious. I need to come back here."

I was happy to just enjoy my food, though. I enjoy a glass of wine, but I don't consider myself a connoisseur, so when I started with a $13 glass of wine, I was very happy to not get the upsell you often do at restaurants of this quality.\n\nI started off with the Bone Marrow Flan and was absolutely stunned. I would say it was the best appetizer I have ever had, anywhere. For dinner, I had the 8oz filet (medium rare, of course) and the tempura onion rings. My one complaint is that the onion rings were pretty flimsy in comparison.. I didn't expect large ones, but they were basically onion straws, and it was a strange consistency as a result. However, the taste was outstanding.\n\nI loved that the steak came with different mustards. It seems silly until you try it, but it really reflects on Wolfgang's Austrian heritage, and they actually added a ton. \n\nI'm not normally a dessert person, but they had a pumpkin and apple beignet that I couldn't pass up. I'm glad I didn't, it was cooked perfectly, warm and just  decadent.\n\nThe servers worked great in a team and were so friendly. They didn't try to sell me on anything I wasn't interested in, but every time I needed a recommendation, they were available. That's awesome.\n\nOverall, I would say it was on the level of CarneVino and would make my decision difficult next time, but thankfully I can hit both."

While I prefer the dining room, there wasn't much choice in the matter, since they were booked solid until 10pm.  The lounge was nice, but the seats could use A LOT of improvement.  My back and legs ached before we even received our entrees.  Even a couple cocktails didn't numb the discomfort.\n\nComfort aside, the food and service were on the mark.  We ordered five appetizers:\n\n1.  Fava bean salad - my wife didn't like it when she went last time, but this time one of my buddies actually enjoyed it.  Go figure.  But seriously, why pay $15 for a bean salad?!?\n2.  Big Eye Carpaccio - not bad, but it felt like such a waste of good tuna to be fixed up.  I would have preferred it sashimi style, but that's just me.  \n3.  Maple Glazed Pork Belly - just as yummy as it was the last time.  And I again wish I had just ordered 4 of these for my entree.  I would compare this to sweet, salty baconny goodness.  \n4.  Kobe Sashimi - everyone on the table loved this we did two orders.  Call me a purist, but I really would have liked less...flavor.  Like the big eye, there were just too many flavors going on around such a great central ingredient.  The sauce muted the beefy goodness.  On the plus side, this was butter tender and really tasty.  \n\nWe each had different cuts of meat, and everyone was happy with what they had.  If I remember correctly, my friends ordered a filet, New York Strip and Illinois Rib Eye.  I had the Nebraska Rib Eye.  All steaks were ordered medium rare and all were perfectly cooked.  My buddy who had the Illinois (bone in) Rib Eye and I swapped pieces and we both agreed the Nebraska was far and away superior in flavor and tenderness.  \n\nFor sides, we only had the creamed spinach and pureed potatoes.  The egg on the spinach could have been cut up better because the pieces were pretty huge (picking nits on that one, eh).  The potatoes were really nothing special and were seriously lacking in flavor; maybe they just need to add some bacon to that thing.\n\nI did order a bottle of Kaesler Avignon Syrah, which went waaaaay to fast.  It felt like our server just wanted to empty the bottle out as quickly as possible.  Maybe I'm just a pretentious wine snob, but I like to let the wine in my glass open up before pouring more.  Is that too much to ask?  Despite this perceived flaw in service, everyone was attentive, friendly and quick (maybe too quick?).  \n\nActually, looking back on my previous review, I should have given CUT 5 stars for that visit because this time round it was a step down."

If you're considering this place, Nine, StripSteak, etc, just skip CUT and book one of those.\n\nHere's how things went down. Brought a nice bottle of wine from the cellar, no problem with the $100 corkage for a magnum. Instead, we get \"you'll need to leave this bottle here and I'll get it authorized that it's not on our list\". It's not. I knew that if you would have asked. And instead of being subtle, you do it loudly and obnoxiously.\n\nThen we got from zero to 100. Great server, great assistant, excellent salads x6, then the first 1/4 of the steaks were great, on par or above the the best I've had. Then comes the \"issue\". We get the fire alarm sounding a screaming siren and a flashing strobe light that was about 6 billion candlepower. We stop eating. We ask what's up. We are told, It's a \"hotel thing\" and there's nothing that can be done and we should try to enjoy our steaks.\n\nWe can't. The girls bail from the whining siren. I ask if there's a solution. This time, I'm annoying them. And yes, this light is about 10 feet from our table on the ceiling. It's blinding and the grinding siren is killing me. I fully understand that the restaurant has no direct control over this. BUT, instead of stopping by the table with a quick apology, or an explanation, or managing expectations they watch our girls leave. I ask again, this time they're annoyed. So, we ask for the bill. 2/3's of $300 of beef sitting on plates, and 1/2 of a $450 bottle of wine sits in a decanter. \n\nThe server tells us we're great guys and he'll bring us the bill. I go puke. Literally. The strobe lights have gotten to me (as had 2 Gin martinis). We get back, siren still going, lights flashing. We pay the bill - $500 and we brought the wine. Server let's us know how great of a deal we're getting because he only charged us a 1/2 corkage. Huh? So, we leave a couple hundred dollars of wine behind, don't get more than 1/2 into our main dish and the $50 is making up for it. \n\nSimply addressing things, \"hey, step outside, come back when it stops...\", or \"hey, what can we do to make this tolerable\", or \"hey, this sucks, sorry\". Instead we got indifference, a large bill, walked out on a great bottle of wine, and figuratively slapped on the a$$ on the way out with a dent on the AMEX."

Had the Maryland blue crab and Carolina shrimp for starter- crab was fresh and sweet, texture of the firm shrimps combined with the soft avocado was well balanced and the horseradish added just the right amount of punch to the sea flavors. I like my meat with more flavor and some texture rather than totally melt-in-your-mouth , so I decided to go with the U.S (instead of Japanese) wagyu filet mignon. This was tender and flavorful for a filet mignon. I asked for medium and it was cooked to perfection - well seared on the outside and beautifully charred which gave it that smoky flavor and pink in the middle with the juice retained. Creamed spinach was slightly weak in flavor for my liking but Mac-n-cheese was great. We paired the meat with a Darioush signature range cab sav- good amount of depth but still easy to drink and fairly affordable."

Perfect for people watching and giving us a great view of the restaurant. \n\nWe were immediately greeted and offered water, these crispy and delish cheese sticks along with an amuse of a cheese puff pastry. \n\nOur server inquired if we'd like a recommendation for wine and we always like to go with a professional recommendation. He chose well, with a lovely bottle of CADE, which is owned by Plumpjack and was the perfect Cabernet for our meal! \n\nOur server described the food with beautiful and mouthwatering detail. We took his recommendation of the Wagyu carpaccio with this delightful sauce that complemented it perfectly along with their pork belly... which was perfectly fatty and the right amount of crisp. \n\nThe real showcase, as you've seen from everyone's photos is their beef and on this evening we chose the Japanese Wagyu.... and OMG I have never put anything that delicious in my mouth before. \n\nWe have had American, Australian Wagyu previously.... but they don't hold a candle to the Japanese. This steak was butter.... just melted in our mouth. \n\nChef recommended medium (which at first we said no, no.... we like RARE), but they convinced us that medium would still be red and juicy... but the fat will fully melt and it will be so tender. \n\nTHEY WERE RIGHT!!!!!!!!! It was amazing.... purely amazing and something every steak lover NEEDS to try. \n\nAcross from us was a large party (great people watching), but better than that, we got to witness the pure production from the team as they sliced their tasting menu meats table side and with the grace of a well choreographed danced, the five servers.... served. It was so impressive the party gave them a round of applause and then asked to take their photo. \n\nYou can tell the restaurant team is a true TEAM. Every single person we encountered from the host to the busser to the various servers to the manager... was hospitable, friendly and not the least bit pretentious or judgy (unlike SW at Wynn... see that review). \n\nOur Banana Cream Pie Brulee was the perfect finish to our exquisite meal... accompanied by a deliciously sweet and cold wine (the varietal and winery I forget) and our cappuccino's were expertly prepared. \n\nWe spend a lot of money at CUT and I can say, without question, it was probably the best meal I have ever had.\n\nWe will recommend friends to go and we will be back on each of the three planned visits we have remaining this year. \n\nThe Palazzo and CUT are all you need... \n\nTreat yourself... it's worth it!"

Since the bone marrow flan was talked about in many reviews, we decided to try it out, and DAM! It was fucking delicious. Definitely not for everybody, though.\n\nFor my steak, I went with the 35 day dry aged ribeye which was insanely good; especially the house made steak sauce. You definitely have to try the mac and cheese. Totally worth the long wait. It also feeds 3, along with most of the sides.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with this restaurant, and felt it was well worth the extra money I shelled out to eat here."

Yes, they are masters in the art of up selling but what do you expect from a restaurant like this.  \n\nVery modern in appearance but yet seemingly sophisticated. The sommelier was very helpful in picking wine and actually recommended one of the less expensive ones for our table.  \n\nThe food was OK.  Appetizers we had beef tongue, asparagus and carpaccio. Everything was OK.  One guest at our table really liked the tongue.  The asparagus was a little bland and the carpaccio was good according to everyone else.  I did not care for it.  \n\nI ordered the bone-in ribeye.  It was a good cut of meat but I felt it was a little bland as well - - Hence the 3 star rating for a steak house.  I have had better steak at other places.  Another guest got the butter poached lobster which was actually pretty good.  Waygu beef was ordered at our table and he said that it was excellent.  So the reviews were mixed at our table with everyone getting something different.  \n\nAll in all a decent but not overly awesome steak place in Vegas.  The prices are steep but what else do you expect?  It's worth a try but be prepared to spend some of your gambling money if you go here."

You definitely get what you pay for - food is pricey but absolutely delicious and very good portion sizes. Service was impeccable - our servers, Alyson and Mark were very attentive, personable and knowledgeable.\u00a0 I wasn't sure what to order when I got there but took Alyson's recommendations for drinks and entree and both of them were absolutely amazing.\u00a0 I asked for a drink similar to a mojito and she recommended one of the specialty drinks which was delicious - it was a vodka drink with lychee and other citrus flavors - very smooth, not too sweet or strong, and perfectly chilled. I drank 2 of them!  They brought us a selection of house breads and we each got the pretzel roll and onion focaccia.  Best bread and butter I've ever had at a restaurant!  We ordered the pork belly appetizer and weren't disappointed!  It was so full of flavor and was presented beautifully.  For our entrees, I ordered the rotisserie chicken (it's literally a whole chicken) and my boyfriend ordered a 10 oz Japanese Kobe rib eye. The chicken was the moistest, juiciest, tender and tasty chicken I have ever had.  The Kobe steak literally melted in your mouth and had the richest taste - it was simply seasoned with their house blend of seasoning and cooked to perfection. We got 2 sides to share- the broccolini (without the pepper flakes since I'm not a fan of spice) and the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was so rich and flavorful and the broccolini was absolutely delightful! Definitely recommend both of them! \n\nI think the only thing I would have changed would have been to go to dinner hungrier because I was full after only eating a quarter of my entree!! Although, we  brought the leftover chicken back to our hotel and ate it on the plane ride home the next day and it was still amazingly delicious and moist!  \n\nI wish we had had room for dessert because I'm sure their desserts would have been top-notch like the rest of the meal! \n\nIf you can afford to drop some serious money on dinner, this is the place to go!  Highly recommend! We'll definitely be going back the next time we are in Vegas!"

Chairs could be nicer...similar to office chairs.  Other than that, love the look!\nTotal incl gratuity: ~$125 per person\n\nI waited a long time to finally try this place!  They start you with these parmesan bread sticks that are to die for...our party was literally fighting over them. haha.  They also have a nice little bread selection, one of which is a pretzel bread, which was very good.  The blue crab salad came highly recommended from a friend.  Great choice.  It was fresh and the ingredients came together for a very good start...crab, shrimp, louie dressing, tomatoes, avocado...just nice chilled yummy seafood goodness.  Upon reading reviews from fellow yelpers, I decided to go with the Nebraska ribeye topped with bone marrow.  It was considerably more flavorful than the Illinois fed ribeye.  I thought the meat was prepared well though not sure if it justifies a near $80 price tag.  I tried the Illinois fed ribeye...not bad, seemingly a little tougher than my Nebraska.  All of the sides our table shared were amazing.  Had a small portion of the mac n cheese.  It was a scoop of yummy cheesy heaven.  The creamed spinach was topped with a fried egg, which is what really caught my attention.  Very good...would order it again!  The service was very professional, very nice.  They kept us replenished and happy with the drinks and bread.  My friend packed up her steak to go and the waitress even threw in a couple extra pieces of the pretzel bread for her to go (good hangover food for the next morning).  I was pleased with my experience at CUT and kept thoroughly full through the rest of my trip in LV.  There are a lot of choices when it comes to meat in Vegas so I don't know that I'll make my way back here soon but it was a very memorable enough meal!"

Indeed, I browse the beef section at every market just to check the quality and marbling of their steaks.\n\nIn my mind, the \"perfect\" steak has always come down to a 28-35 day, dry-aged, USDA Prime Ribeye, cooked Rare to Medium Rare with a dash of sea-salt and fresh ground black pepper (What can I say, I'm a purist).\n\nTODAY, I say with good authority... that the perfect steak... is whatever they're serving over there at CUT.\n\nWell lets get some context - we started off the evening getting a couple of cocktails at the bar while watching USC football dominate Ohio.  I look to my left and who should be standing next to me?  WOLFGANG MOTHER-EFFEN PUCK!!!  Yes, Wolfgang Puck hangs out at his own restaurant and apparently was routing for USC - Go figure.\n\nAmbiance of the restaurant is great.  Suitable contemporary decor for a more modern steakhouse.  Lets get down to the food:\n\nTHE BAD:\nThe side dishes are horrible.  \nHerb Fries... absolutely nothing special.  \nCheese Polenta... quite disgusting.  \nCream of Spinach... not much better than what you can get in the Frozen food section.  \nFingerling Potatoes... are actually quite decent.\n\n\nTHE GOOD:\nThey have an amazing mult-course assortment of bread starting with breadsticks, baked cheeseballs, onion bread, and my personal favorite, the Pretzels.\n\nTHE AMAZING:\nIf you're not planning on having a steak, don't come here.  In fact, I'll take it one step further and say IF YOU'RE NOT PLANNING ON HAVING KOBE BEEF... DON'T COME HERE.  The regular USDA Prime steaks are great, but you'll find steaks of similar caliber elsewhere.  The two people who vouched for mere USDA Prime Ribeyes were torn with regret by not spending the extra $25 for the \"Kobe Beef\" upgrade.\n\nPersonally, I can only speak for the medium grade Kobe (American-Raised Wagyu cattle).   Unbelievable flavorful and tender  They say Kobe beef melts in your mouth, and honestly, it really does.  I tried a bite of my friends USDA Prime Rib Eye, and I SWEAR... after having a bite of Wagyu Beef, dry-aged USDA prime meat taste like Sizzler.  $85 for an ala carte 10 oz Rib Eye American Wakyu Steak may seem steep, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.\n\nMost people got the Taste of New York sampler which included 2 oz of Authentic Japanese Kobe Beef, 4 oz of American Wagyu, and 4 Oz of USDA Prime.  Of course, the purpose is show Americans how deprived we are by having mere \"steak,\" while our Japanese Friends have \"STEAK!\"  The taste of this Culinary sampler - $140 for 10 oz of meat.  Yep, $14 an oz.  \n\nBut according to all those who ordered the sampler, the difference between Japanese Kobe and American Kobe... is even bigger and more noticeable than the difference between American Kobe and USDA Prime.  In other words, I have still yet to taste the best of the best.\n\noh Wolfgang Puck, why must you torment me so with your ridiculously expensive, but oh so delicious cuts of Kobe Beef?\n\nThe total cost for 11 of us... almost $2,000."

Apparently the chef didn't get the memo because my steak came out as black as coal, charred to a crisp, and well done for sure. Literally... I had to use the knife like a saw to cut through the steak, certainly not melt in your mouth like they advertise. Once you cut into it the steak was dry and chewy... I am not stretching when I say I have had better steak at Outback! Several other people at the table commented on how hard it was to cut their steaks, how black and charred their steaks were, and how hard they were to chew. \n\nI also ordered a crab salad with my meal which was $30 bucks and tasted really bad... the crab was good but everything else they mixed with it including this mushy cheese mixture was horrible. I picked out the crab and left everything else. Other people in my party ordered the asparagus with egg, the heirloom apple salad, and the butter lettuce avocado salad as appetizers and said they were just ho-hum. \n\nThe side dishes are ridiculous, they are supposed to serve 3 but really only serve 1 and are expensive... we had to order 8 side dishes for 10 people and we only got a few bites each. Their potatoes were watery and not very appealing, their mac-and-cheese was okay but I don't think it was any better than Kraft's mac and cheese, and their tempura onion rings were blah... they should call them flavorless onion strings! \n\nI realize this review has been quite harsh but come on Wolfgang, we expect more from you! When you are spending $200+ per person the meal should be truly amazing and not a charred small portioned mess!\n\nThink twice about going here... there are so many other amazing steakhouses in Vegas that far surpass this one."

I would say Carnevino is the best, but Cut is an excellent place to go. Excellent and attentive waiting staff. They did an excellent job explaining the items on the menu. When we ordered our salads I noticed there wasn't a Caeser salad on the menu, but it was no problem for them as their chef made me an excellent one even though they don't have one advertised. Steak was excellent. Wine service and selection was one of the better ones in Vegas. I would definitely put it on my list of \"must eat\" restaurants in Vegas. They also show you the steaks before they cook them."

We were there during CES (the biggest convention of the year) and just about every decent restaurant around was closed for private events. By the time we found Cut it was 7:45pm. There was a bit of a line, but somehow they got us right in. We sat down and I informed our server Chip of my time constraint. With a no problem attitude Chip went in full streamline mode and immediately informed his co-server. Even with the time constraint it didn't feel like we were rushed and Chip provided a pleasant experience. We both took his steak recommendations along with the greens and cauliflower and were more than happy. I cannot say enough nice things about the professionalism and courteousness of the staff. Oh and I made my show with 2 minutes to spare. If you have the opportunity I can't suggest a better place for a good steak. And ask for Chips, he is great."

I don't know if the restaurant mis-executed but our steaks were generally over-cooked.  My steak in particular was very over-cooked.\n\nBone-In Rib-Eye, Illinois aged 21 days 20 OZ ($64) - below average, 2.5/5 -  They over-cooked my steak. I ordered medium-rare and the steak came out medium to borderline well.  The insides were dry and it was not tender.  The exterior seared portions were charcoal-black and very crunchy.  Again, I don't know if they mis-executed my order but I was pretty disappointed w/ my steak.  This is also a small nitpick - I also prefer the steak came out hotter; I know you are supposed to let steaks sit for 5 minutes before serving but my steak was very slightly colder than I enjoy.\n\n\"White-corn\" Salad (Special) $20 - average 3/5. The salad \"leaves\" are replaced w/ corn (so it's like you are eating a bowl of corn).  Topped w/ baby tomatoes, goat cheese, and a type of mayonnaise-cream mixed w/ the corn.  It tasted okay.  I think they used too much mayonnaise/cream 'cause it tasted too creamy.  \n\n-The sides are served family style so we ordered a few items; Potato Tarte Tatin $19 (Pretty good), Mac & Cheese $12 (excellent), Yukon Gold Potato $12 (average), Tempura Onion Rings $12 (Below average). As such, I'd recommend the Potato Tarte Tatin & the Mac & Cheese.  Everything else was average.\n\n-Free parmesan bread sticks.  Also taste average but presentation is beautiful.\n-Free cheese-puffs bread.  Taste average but beautiful presentation.\n-Free-  4 types of bread (cheesy bread, pretzel, wheat and another I can't remember) .  Most of them are standard/average, but again, presentation is beautiful.  The pretzel was pretty good tho.\n-The steaks also come w/ 4 types of dipping sauces (mustard, hollandaise, French mustard, and another I can't recall).  I typically don't use dipping sauces w/ my steaks but it's an option if you fancy.\n\nService is great, 5/5.  Ambiance is very modern & nice.\n\nTIPS:\n-Corkage $50"

(Good thing too, because his flight arrived 30 minutes early) You can still order off the dining room menu at the bar if you would like, as our server instructed me to do. I was ordering seared tuna off the small bites menu and she kindly informed me that the dinner version of the dish was much larger and the same price. The atmosphere in the lounge is trendy without being pretentious and you can easily just stop in for a drink if you want to. \n\nThat being said, I wasn't very wowed by the food. I do not think I would commit to a full dining experience here. The tuna serving, while massive, was largely unimpressive and flavorless. While my friend, a die hard carnivore, enjoyed his Kobe beef sliders, myself, a mostly herbivore didn't find them to be special. It takes a good steak for me to be impressed and I have to say that I wouldn't be willing to order and pay for one of the steaks here. \n\nMy conclusion...hit the lounge for a more casual and faster paced meal. Or just for some drinks. If you REALLY love steak then maybe consider the dining room."

The wait staff in the restaurant was friendly, but the steaks took forever to come out (40-45 mins).  I ordered mine medium rare and it came out unevenly cooked but mostly rare.  Due to the lighting I thought I just got a chewy bite, but when I looked closer my meat was rare.  I sent it back with the waiter, complaining that it wasn't cooked to medium rare.  The manager came back over with my steak asking, \"so you don't want medium rare because this is our medium rare\" pointing at where I cut into the steak.  I was flabbergasted that he was questioning me as it obviously wasn't cooked properly.  My colleague at the table who ordered medium rare and got medium rare settled it, \"he asked for medium rare and I asked for medium rare, so which is wrong.\"  The manager left the table on that note.  I was so upset that I canceled my steak not knowing what would happen to it after it left my site and given the manager would rather question me than the chef.

It's that tiny little disclaimer that no one tells you about and I found out after reading Open Table's website. I think that is ridiculous but that's a whole different topic in itself.\n\nI've eaten at Cut while at a Bachelor party but eating with a group of guys is obviously different than eating with your lady who doesn't really eat steak. The service was remarkable - from the hostess to the multitude of servers. Our server brought out various cuts of meat and informed us of the process for each one. You could tell the server really liked his job because of his enthusiasm for each cut. \n\nI ended up getting the Petit Filet, a ton of sides and a nice Gin cocktail. We also ordered some wine and their sommelier brought out a new wine machine that pokes a hole into the cork of the wine bottle so they wouldn't have to open up the entire bottle for one customer. We were their guinea pig (or they said) and it was her first time doing a table side opening. It's an interesting concept but if you do not have an open bottle to compare the two, the whole thing is kind of pointless. \n\nBesides the steak, their seasonal corn was probably the best thing on their menu. The server highly recommended it and I would so as well. Their corn was so simple yet so flavorful (only flavored with olive oil, salt & pepper, sugar). I would probably pass on their creamy spinach and it honestly did not need the egg on top. \n\nIt was a very nice meal and I would definitely come back."

However, for the price you pay and the caliber I would expect from Wolfgang Puck, I was disappointed in the reason you go to a steakhouse: the meat! I'll start with the pros, though:\n\nPros: Excellent service. I had to wait for my party in the cocktail area and was promptly served bar snacks like duck confit popcorn, homemade salt and vinegar chips, olives, and a glass of wine. After we were seated, the waitstaff was very attentive, took care of all of my food allergies, and we were served in a timely manner.\n\nThe sides and appetizers were incredible. The Crab Louie, butter lettuce salad, mushrooms, and creamy polenta were among our favorites. The cocktails and wine list were excellent as well. It was the best Cosmo we had the entire trip and the best pinot noir!\n\nCons: The steak. I don't get it. It's a steakhouse and when you're paying $85+ for a Wagyu steak, you'd expect top notch preparation. Our steaks tasted like lighter fluid. It was Pittsburgh style, so it was charred on the outside, but instead of being searing in butter, it just tasted like gasoline. I didn't even finish my 8 oz filet and neither did others in our party. \n\nOverall, I was disappointed, especially considering I frequent the Cut in Beverly Hills quite often. I would try another steak house (of which there are numerous in the Palazzo/Venetian alone!)."

There's a location in Beverly Hills, CA, but I've walked by the location inside the Palazzo hotel countless times without even a glimpse at the menu. This time around -- we were about to meet Kobe Bryant in person and it was close to my wife's birthday -- so I figured why the heck not.\n\nI had already braced myself for the high prices, but it's another thing to see the menu in person. After they rolled out the cart showing all the different types of meat and all its marbling glory, I chose the American Wagyu / Angus \"Kobe Style\" Beef ribeye from Snake River Farms (SRF). It's not quite on the level of the Japanese Kobe beef that everyone hears about, but it's still good... I hope.\n\nI requested the ribeye to be cooked medium, and it was fantastic. Well seasoned and charred on the outside, while juicy on the inside. I loved all of the marbling throughout the meat, which gave it that intense, rich, and beefy flavor. \n\nThey even provided a wide array of complimentary sauces and salt for the steak -- but it shouldn't even be touched. I had a tiny taste of them all, and I made funny, squishy faces with each one. Just enjoy the meat, and nothing else. But overheard on the table next to ours, \"can I get some BBQ sauce?\"\n\nThe meat was good, but I'm a bit of a meat connoisseur, and even I thought there wasn't a HUGE \"OMG\" earth-shattering difference in taste between the Prime steaks vs. the American Wagyu/Angus Kobe Beef that I just had -- $88 for a 9 oz piece of steak. I was curious about the Australian Wagyu -- but at sky high prices, I will continue to be curious for a while.\n\nThe wife had the 2 lb lobster, which was absolutely delicious. After it was nicely presented at our table, the waiter delicately pulled out all of the tender, juicy lobster meat and presented it on the plate. As he was about to toss away the lobster shells, my wife quickly said, \"wait can I have those, I want to suck on the head.\" Yup, she said that. The moment was priceless, but the waiter was expressionless. What a putz.\n\nSo yeah, that's how the Asians do it -- not wanting to waste any morsel of meat and flavorful brains, guts, and juices from the shell. There was more meat too -- just took more work. We had the risotto for the side, which was creamy and buttery and the perfect compliment to our entrees. For dessert, they gave us a complimentary baked alaska -- a mixture of ice cream and meringue. Overall, a splendid yet extremely pricey dining experience."

Every time I step into Cut  the culture of the restaurant is prevalent in each one of it's staff members. You will receive prompt  and very cordial service from the beautiful hostess staff.  The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable in their menu and their confidence in their preferences is much appreciated.  They really listen to what you desire to feast on, and will work with you to find what's best for that occasion.\n\nThe Meal:\n\nBreads-  I tried two of the many breads they had to offer, the focaccia was a bit to soggy for my liking so I only took a bite and placed it aside, BUT the pretzel bread bites they offer are pretty amazing.  You know the feeling you get when you spend 10 dollars on a pretzel at a ballgame and you feel like you are chewing on a rope?  Eating this pretzel at Cut will make you regret eating any other pretzel rendition of any type in your life.  If pretzels were like Highlanders and there could only be One, this would be it!\n\nSides- Onion Rings-Being from Texas I love all things fried, the onion rings were good but I was hoping the cut of the onion would have been bigger.  The presentation was beautiful as they stacked the onion rings on top of each other about 8 inches into the air.  The tempura fry worked well with the onions as the batter was light and the salt was melted into them. Nothing to go crazy over here.\n\nBrocellini- typically I order some sort of a grilled asparagus variation to accompany my steak into my stomach but I wanted to change it up and try something different.  The brocellini was sauteed and came with a few sun dried tomatoes and it had a mild vinaigrette drizzled on top to  cut some of the sharpness of the vegetable.   It looked as good as it tasted.\n\nThe Main Event- I selected the 20oz. aged bone in rib-eye and it did not disappoint, this is my go to choice for steak due to the good fat content this cut has.  If you like your steaks on the rare side be wary because this cut will be extremely rare more towards the bone due to the nature of the cut.  I was recommended to get the steak cooked at a medium rare and it was fantastic.  The steak was seared perfectly on both sides and it was cooked consistently throughout. I got the bone marrow as a compliment to the steak and they give you an ample amount, using it as spread accented each bite perfectly.\n\nDo yourself a favor and the next time you are in the City of Sin, get yourself a piece of Heaven at Cut."

With so many great dining choices, how does one go about choosing a place to satiate their appetite as well as tantalize their tastebuds??? Being that I was in Vegas for my bachelor party, I didn't find this dilemma too challenging. I figured...I'm with the guys so let's do steak and martinis. With my objective in mind...I set out to find a steakhouse worthy of our patronage. After considering such places as Craftsteak, N9ne, and Delmonicos...CUT was the restaurant that won me over. Such decadent offerings as the braised pork belly and bone marrow flan is what ultimately lured me here. \n\nWe missed our 7pm reservation because we missed our flight out of SFO. We arrived in Vegas a little past 7 and considering it was a Thursday, I figured that it might be slow enough for them to squeeze us in on a later reservation. So I call the restaurant and they are able to accommodate us with a 9:30 reservation. My first impression was \"Awesome!,\" because I was so looking forward to eating here and would have been been a major let down if I wasn't able to. Given that this place closes at 10:00, I was worried that we would be rushed through our meal and quickly ushered out of the resturant, and that the whole experience would be ruined because of it. Much to my pleasant suprise, it was quite the contrary.\n\nService was stellar from beginning to end. What we had to eat...\n\nAppetizers: \nBraised pork belly - this was delicious and wonderfully fatty without being overwhelming\n\nEntree:\n14oz aged ribeye with bone marrow topping - one of the best steaks I've ever had. Seared perfectly on the outside with a light char and a juicy pink medium center. There is a generous amount of bone marrow and it is rich, fatty, and flavorful. Each bite of my steak would be accompanied by a piece of marrow. I found this delectable and euphoric at first, but after awhile it did get a little too rich for me. I still loved it however, and highly recommend it.\n\nCUT was my first experience in Vegas of fine dining and with the number of high class restaurants, each with their own prospective celebrity chefs, my expectations were high and I'm glad that CUT did not disappoint. Food, ambience, and service were all meshed seamlessly. \n\nI'll be back most definitely."

            "review": "Excellent food and equally excellent service and experience.  The GF and I were looking for a nice steak house while we were in vegas and after reading through a bunch of yelp reviews we finally settled on Cut... mostly due to the wide selection of Kobe and Waygu selections... I mean if you are gonna go all out, go all out!  \n\nTHE ORDER\n\nWaygu Ribeye - 5 out of 5 - Wow.  The nicest, most tender and most flavorful cut of Ribeye I've ever had.  I was so looking forward to having an entire cut of Waygu and it didn't disappoint.  The steak had a nice char and was well seasoned.  It came out perfectly medium rare.  It was so good that I literally took my time savoring every single bite.\n\nWaygu Filet Minion - 5 out of 5 - Equally good.  Oh so tender and flavorful.  If you like Fllet Minion this will blow your mind.  I can't recall my GF ever being this excited over a steak she's ever had\n\nWasabi-yuzu Kosho Butter Sause - 3 out of 5 - This was an additional sauce you can have on the side of your steak order.  I was expecting a big burst of flavor, but it was much more mild than I expected and didn't hold up to the steak as well as I would have liked.  It added more of a \"richness\" to the steak but not as much flavor as I would have liked.\n\nShallot-red Wine Bordelaise Sauce - 5 out of 5 - Wow.  I've had some wine sauces before, but this one may be one of the best I've ever had.  There is a sweetness and an earthy depth to this sauce that perfectly compliments a steak.  Really it is an excellent and very much worth it.\n\nWild Field Mushrooms Topper - This was another option that you can have on top of your steak. My GF added it to her filet minion and absolutely loved it.  The mushrooms perfectly good.  They had a nice texture and flavor and really went well with the steak and Shallot-red Wine sauce. \n\nCavatappi Pasta \"mac & Cheese,\" Qu\u00e9bec Cheddar - 4.5 out of 5 - Very nice addition to the meal.  The portion size is equal to that of an entree so there is plenty to share.  The mac & cheese came out with a nice crust on the top and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  The sauce creamy and rich and oh so good.  One of the better mac & cheese's I've had.\n\nApple Stuffed Pumpkin Doughnuts with Maple Whipped Cream and Pumpkin Gelato - 5 out of 5 - Yeah...it's just as good as it sounds!  The apple stuffed doughnut was airy light.  The maple whipped cream adds a nice subtle sweetness and the pumpkin gelato was seriously out of this world.  It really doesn't get much better than this.\n\nSERVICE\n\nIt is really everything you would expect from a top flight steak house.  Everyone from the servers to the busboys are top notch and give everyone personal attention.\n\nOVERALL\n\nWhile the prices aren't for the feint of heart, it was worth every single penny.  Highly recommended to anyone who is looking for a nice upscale place to eat."

We were greeted immediately.  The hostess was ready for us, and the person who escorted us to the table was ready.  As we followed him through the restaurant to our table, pretty much every restaurant staffer stopped what they were doing for just a few seconds to turn to us and say 'Welcome.'  I felt more welcomed stepping into that restaurant than I have anywhere else that I have ever visited on land (fancy cruise ships have this level of service as well).  The restaurant is designed so there are a number of smaller spaces walled off from one another, and this is BRILLIANT, as it cuts down on the noise level.  If you have anyone in your family that has a challenge having a conversation in a restaurant, they have a better chance being relaxed at Cut.  The waiter was A+.  The food and drinks are simply put -- art that your eyes will enjoy before your mouth does.  It's just a remarkable experience, and worth every penny. My ONLY suggestion is regarding the bread guy.  Ours seemed a little like a deer in the headlights, and never came back to us the entire meal.  But that is small in the scheme of things.  Cut is so much better than the experience I had at Spago in Beverly Hills a few years ago.  I look forward to returning in the future when I visit Vegas again.  Congratulations, Mr. Puck!"

Their complementary birthday cake (a caramelized cream coating over ice cream and a tart bottom-type thing) is nice and unique.\n\nMy only complaint about this place is that they can really improve their sides. Their sides aren't bad, but they just aren't too memorable nor too impressive (especially the mac and cheese). The egg + spinach is a bit too watery, but the root veggies will complement your steak well. The side portions are big - I recommend 1 side order per 2 persons. \n\nAll in all, this place is a must go if you're in Vegas!"

Everything else was because of the experience.\n\nI went in a large group for a friend's birthday.  Service took a while and when our food came out, the waiters mixed up a few orders and put the entrees in front of the wrong people.  Now, I like steak as much as a normal person, but often times (and especially when there's no bone), it's hard for me to tell different cuts.  Same with some of my friends.  So we start to eat and realize that the orders are wrong.  People didn't want to touch stuff that other people already touched so we complained and they went to prepare entrees for those that already had theirs \"soiled.\"\n\nAlso, all of this doesn't include that they forgot one order, and tried to ameliorate the situation by cranking out a steak as fast as they could.  It came out bloody (no, the person ordering it didn't ask for it that way or anything close) but instead of having them heat it further, two people at my table traded dishes to keep everyone happy.\n\nThe birthday boy was obviously not happy, as his steak was one that was affected.  IMMEDIATELY after all of this occurs, the waiter comes by and says \"I'm so sorry for all of this.  Can I interest you in a glass of wine?\"  The birthday boy, thinking that it was a freebie to make him happy, accepted.  But lo and behold, at the end of the night, the wine made its way onto the bill.\n\nObviously, overall very, very, very dissatisfied with the way services went.  You could say that having a large group (we had 10 people) is difficult to handle, but for a top tier restaurant, this should be easy.  Plus, it wasn't even busy that night!  There were empty tables all around us.\n\nBut, the food was good.  Not the best steak I've ever had, but good nevertheless.  Didn't have any of the bone marrow that one of my friends ordered but that was supposed to be one of the best things to eat.\n\nI don't think I'll come back here again.  Especially with a large group."

            "review": "This was my second time at CUT and it was just as great as my first experience. This time I tried:\n\nThe American Wagyu Porterhouse -- This is a LARGE steak. I think it was like 32 oz. I ended up splitting with one of my friends. But I can definitely eat the whole thing myself if I wanted to. The filet side was amazingly tender. Unfortunately it was literally like 2 bites. The New York portion was also very flavorful and juicy!\n\nOther things I tried were the Mac and Cheese, Brussels Sprouts, Creamed Spinach, and Fries. I'd say that the Mac and Cheese and Brussles Sprouts were my favorite. Seriously the Mac and Cheese is amazing. I was also able to try a bite of the Kobe Steak Sashimi, which was delicious. It melts in your mouth. The only complaint was that the sauce was a little salty, but overall a great dish.\n\nOn thing to note based on my 2 experiences at CUT is that they tend to slightly overcook the Ribeye steaks. On both occasions anyone who ordered a Ribeye (Medium Rare) commented on the fact that it came out closer to Medium. It not too big a deal since they are totally willing to accommodate, either offering a new steak or removal from the bill. I think often times they try to bring the steaks out all at the same time and with the Porterhouse being much thicker, sometimes the ribeye comes out a little over. Honestly the steaks are so tender and juicy it really doesn't make too much a difference. Despite this little flaw, CUT is still one of the BEST steaks I've ever eaten.\n\nI still look forward to trying the 100% Australian Wagyu Beef. One day I shall return and try that!"

That's a tough order considering our experience at Charlie Palmer Steak was 5 stars and one of the best dining experiences we've ever enjoyed. \n\nCUT is really expensive, let's get that out of the way now. If over the top expensive isn't for you, don't bother b/c who goes to a steakhouse to order the short ribs or the chicken, simply because it's affordable? \n\nTheir hostess is cute as a button, but she makes Aubrey O'Day from Celeb Apprentice seem genuine. I mean, fake smile is standard, I get that, but this gal was just blowin' skirts up left n right.\n\nThis place is all about service, food and apparently wine, but I don't drink b/c my boy is Bill W and all, so that's neither here nor there for me. Bobby,our very astute and proper waiter, offered up a few non alco beverages. A ginger-ale and pineapple number that was really good and a very VERY tart cranberry option. Both were a nice touch for peeps who don't get down with the booze. \n\nBefore you actually order, they discuss the menu in great detail. Our waiter, Bobby, seemed a bit aggressive, but I think that's just b/c he knows his stuff and has a great understanding of the menu, so once we realized that, it was easier to understand the in your face approach. They have this giant plate, with a black napkin draped over it, loaded with all of their cuts of beef. They describe each in great detail and of course, attempt to get you to choose the most delicious, expensive cut. \n\nBread: Numerous options, all made in house\n\nCheese Puff: they have a technical fancy pants term for this, but it's a cheese puff and boy is it delightful!\n\nFoccacia: Caramelized onions infused in the soft and chewy bread, excellent\n\nPretzel Bun: I had my doubts about this, but they were incredibly soft, chewy and also made in house\n\nChoice of Cow: 35 day aged Nebraska NY Sirloin and Ribeye, which Bobby helped us choose\n\nThe meat was cooked to perfection, it was tender and juicy and succulent. Ribeye had a bit too much fat, but not a big deal. NY seemed to have less. They offer up a selection of house mustard (s) b/c apparently Wolfy loves to slather mustard on his steak. It's a nice touch, but I could do without b/c the dry rub they offer is very tasty. \n\nSides are not included, but we had to get sides. \n\nMac n Cheese: gooey, delicious and it is served piping hot. Eat it fast b/c the cheese starts to dry up and get gummy pretty fast. \n\nFingerling potatoes: are served with roasted onions and my favorite, slab bacon! Like large cubes of fatty swine, so delicious and just melt in your mouth goodness. \n\nWe had to pass on dessert b/c we killed every bite of dinner, but the dessert menu does look desirable. Bobby one upped himself and brought out a few nibblets of goodness. \n\nChoco: Rich, creamy dark chocolate ganache over graham cracker crust. Very rich, but very good.\n\nCaramel: This was heavenly. It was like a tiny bite of pecan pie mixed with nut brittle and I loved it. Nice and sticky and oh so scrumptious! \n\nThat's a wrap and if you made it this far down the page, thanks for reading my novel. Cheers mate!"

They only had a table in their lounge (vs the dining room), which we actually preferred.  Very cool bar, modern but comfortable lounge with normal tables for dining.  \n\nWe started with a bottle of prosecco that my wonderful friend had sent for my birthday, gougeres and several types of bread with nicely salt and spiced butter. We split a butter lettuce salad, which was good start.  A side of butternut squash, which came with roasted celery root and leek, was just delicious.\n\nWith our steak, and the addition of two more friends, we ordered a bottle of red -- it was a challenge to find a recession-friendly bottle among the three- and four-digit prices.  We skimped on wine and went with a ~$50 bottle of Malbec that did the job.  \n\nBack to the Wagyu -- they bring out the entire sizzling skillet and carve the NY strip and filet so you get a few of each.  Comes with the house steak sauce and a Bernaise, though absolutely not necessary.  The savory juices (and frankly fat) spread through your mouth with each bite that is pure heaven.  \n\nMy wonderful friend also sent a birthday dessert, which we swore we all had no space left in our body for, until we had the first bite of banana creme goodness, and proceeded to devour the rest.\n\nMeal was culinary bliss for about two hours, despite the struggles of my corseted friend.

Being the spontaneous couple that we are, we didn't make reservations and the restaurant was packed with no open table.  Our charming hostess then suggested a seat in the \"lounge,\" which we obliged.  \n\nThe Lounge was basically the waiting area outside the actual eating area, right in front of the bar.

We started off with a couple glasses of wine and a generous assortments of bread (pumpernickel, pretzel, and a couple other choices), then boyfriend ordered the 8 oz. New York Sirloin with horseradish sauce and a side of creamed spinach.  I had the Rotisserie duck and split the spinach. First off, let me say that I was totally jealous of boyfriend's order.  It was wonderful!  The steak was more medium than rare, but buttery and really delicious.  I could have skipped the horseradish (not stingy enough), but it's okay, because the meat was so flavorful that I wouldn't care to mask it with a sauce anyway.  My duck was delicious.  The gastrique was a bit too sweet for my taste, but the meat was tender and the skin was nice and crispy. \n\nThe portions for both plates were generous and more than enough for both of us.  The tab at the end of the meal was pricey; however, the courteous wait staff, out of this world food and generally great experience made it worth every penny.  Definitely looking forward to going back next time we're in town."

In my opinion CUT and SW are nose to nose, with the next steakhouse a distant 3rd (I've been to several).\n\nThe only thing about CUT, is I only recommend you order the American Wagyu beef from Snake River Farms.  They have \"lesser\" USDA steaks that just don't stack up.  I must emphasize that my review is dependent upon ordering the American Wagyu.  They also offer True Japanese Wagyu that I'm sure is great, but I haven't had it.\n\nThere are 3 American Wagyu steaks to choose from, and I recommend either the 9oz Ribeye or the 6oz Filet.  I get them both medium rare, and they offer contrasting flavors that are excellent.   CUT does a char on the steaks.  At first I wasn't sure about their char, but I was hooked on it after one bite.  The filet is as tender as they come, while the ribeye explodes with flavor.  Some ribeyes at lower end restaurants are filled with fat, while the Snake River Farms ribeye has a perfect amount.  I eat every bite of the CUT ribeye, while I usually leave a large amount of fatty pieces at lesser restaurants.\n\nHere is my recommended order:\n\nBread:  Pretzel (awesome!)\n\nSalad/Appetizer:  None\n\nEntree:  American Wagyu from Snake River Farms:  Filet OR Ribeye prepared medium rare.\n\nSides:  Yukon Gold Potato Puree.  They also have an amazing corn dish, but hasn't been available every time I've been there.\n\nDessert:  Chocolate Souffle.  Highly recommended if you have room for it!  It's big and should be split with someone."

I love a good steak and I love trying good steakhouses. I am no expert, but I have had my share of great steaks, good steaks, and meh steaks. I hate to say this this, at the end of our meal, the Cut just simply didn't cut it for us. We were there to celebrate the New Year, which made it that much more disappointing.\n\nLet's start with the good. Service was great. Our waiter was very polite, and he was knowledgeable with the different cuts the restaurant offered. The staff was attentive, quick to refill your drinks and The breads that they offered - a pretzel bread and a focaccia bread - were really delicious. They have a nice twist by putting a fried egg in the creamed spinach, and their mac-n-cheese is nice and rich.\n\nNow - to the bad, and specifically to why we came here in the first place. The steak itself. My friend and I both ordered a ribeye. We both expected nice, juicy, fatty steaks. What we each got was a dried, bland piece of meat. I even tried to reason it that it was a New York steak - but even calling it a NY steak insults a NY Steak. I have had better NY steak elsewhere. Here's a question for you - how do you not overcook a steak but still keep it dried? We trusted the chef's recommendation and had it done medium-rare, and it was certainly pink in the middle, but where's the juice? To be honest, if we didn't get the peppercorn sauce it would have been rather hard to eat the steak.\n\nLook, let's be honest here. You come to a place like this - you know you are gonna drop some $. That's a given and we accept that. What's not acceptable is the quality of the \"steaks\" that were served. I'm willing to concede that it was during the holiday season and maybe the chef was busy and overlooked something, or maybe they just had bad cuts of meat. But am I willing to try this place again? Not likely. Delmonico's is just next door."

I had just eaten at Carnevino a week or so prior, and I wouldn't put Cut in the same league, or even approaching it.\n\nWe ordered similar items here that we got at Carnevino, beet salad, cocktail and wine, American wagyu ribeye and the fillet.  These items all seemed to be a large step below in quality and flavor in comparison.  In fact, we had bigger portions and more food and drink at Carnevino than Cut, yet the price and total bill came out to be much higher at Cut.\n\nAdditionally, unlike Carnevino, the atmosphere at Cut was massively trendy and unwelcoming.  So trendy, that when we asked for a wine list, we were presented with a stupid iPad to search for something suitable with our meal.  At that point, I was ready to deduct a star from my review just based on the pretentiousness of this.  But the food and price of everything did a suitable job in reducing my rating.\n\nWhat I find weird is that I have had Snake Rivers farms meat on many occasions and regularly bought it at my local supermarket in the Seattle area.  It is good stuff, and it was always worth paying a little extra for the quality.  It wasn't outrageously expensive compared to other store meats.  But Cut prices their Snake River Farms American wagyu meat so high that it is offensive to me.  At those prices I should be getting genuine, pure Japanese Kobe beef.  \n\nBased on the overall dining experience, there are so many other better steakhouses to go other than Cut.  Carnevino of course being the best.  Others include Vic and Anthony's, which actually had a BETTER fillet that was not American wagyu at a third of the price, Mon Ami Gabi, Todd's Unique, Stripsteak, and many many others.  At Cut you are paying for the Wolfgang Punk brand, and not an amazing meal.  \n\nAlso take note, Cut no longer offers a local discount when I asked, which made me hate paying for this meal even more."

We've tried most of the offerings and the fliet and bone-in offerings (my go to steaks) are all excellent. Add sauces and sides for extra money to mix and match to your taste. There's no wrong decision here.\n\nBreads, often overlooked at steak houses, are varied and delightful. Just don't fill up and miss out on the awesome meats! Japanese Kobe, American Kobe, American Corn-Fed, Prime and pretty much anything else you can imagine are on tap if you can afford them. We did some tastings of different meats too, little bites basically and some of them ran $60, so be prepared to shell out big bucks for the privilege of dining here.\n\nSo, it's a special place and worth the money, just not somewhere you'd want to go as your regular place. There are several expensive wines and several that are decent values if you know your wines or trust the sommelier to ferret out the values for you. Fantastic for a special occasion."

What a great steak.\n\nWhile we each ordered sauce - I had the bearnaise (yum), my friend had the horseradish (good) and my sister had the steak sauce (a bit sweet for me) - we truly didn't need it... what your server doesn't tell you is that they will bring out various mustards - lavender, etc - and that the mustards are just as good as - if not better than - the sauces.\n\nService was impeccable.  Attentive but not in your face.\n\nMy cocktail was okay.  I think it was called a Hemingway.  It didn't blow me away.  Neither did the mille-feuille the three of us shared... It was okay, not great.  A let down, actually.  The cream was delicious but a mille-feuille translates - literally - into a thousand sheets.  As in \"lots of pastry.\"  And this had maybe 5 sheets.  Maybe not.  I would have skipped the dessert and gone somewhere else.  Finally, the sides were a mixed back.  The creamed spinach was good, but not great.  The yukon potato puree was tasteless... the peppers and mushrooms were DEEEEELISH.  Please, do everyone a favor and order them.  mmmmm.\n\nSo, 5 stars for theservice, the meat, the bread and the salad.\n\n4 stars for the sauces.\n\n3 stars for the cocktails and sides.\n\n2 stars for the dessert.\n\n4 stars overall...

The bone marrow probably was a bit too much for the wagyu, to be honest.  The onion rings were thin and crispy, while the spinach was decent.  I tried Husby's bone-in ribeye but it was not cooked medium-rare and it was a bit tough.  I would have expected a much better cut of meat for the price.

            "review": "Wolfgang Puck's CUT is like the high school tease that you finally go out with & discover she's all style, no substance.  Smokin' hot in a black mini & heels, but lousy in the backseat & mindnumbingly boring.\n\nSome say you're buying ambiance.  WELL, F@#$ AMBIANCE.  I don't care if I'm in a garbage dump with a Tijuana donkey show across from me.  If the food's incredible, I'll return!  I go to a great restaurant to have the chef strap me down, force me to curl my toes & close my eyes, throw my head from side-to-side & moan, \"ohholymotherofgod... thatissoooooogood\".  And I'll pay top dollar for that kinda domination.\n\nBut once you cut through the illusion they've created, it's really difficult to ignore how ordinary the food is at CUT relative to great steak restaurants in Vegas.\n\n1) 'MEH' STEAKS\nWhile the type of beef might be important,  I strongly believe the quality of a steak dinner originates in large part from the chef's preparation.  In Texas, a good broiler can make any cut of beef great & so I use the steaks I've had there as the benchmark for quality & taste in Vegas.  Frankly, the way my steaks have been prepared at CUT to date, you could have the Samsonite gorilla throwing them on a grill & they'd come out pretty much the same.  Lacking character & distinction.  \n\nOne of the best steaks I consistently have is at a chain restaurant in Texas.  For $28, I get a hot-off-the-grill Ribeye with melted blue cheese & garlic butter over it that sizzles with an aroma that would bring you to your knees - along with a baby lobster tail & Idaho potato that's so good, you take the rest of it home.  Meanwhile the scent CUT's purported $160 Kobe beef rib eye doesn't even make me the least bit excited - and it's ala carte.\n\n2) BEEN-THERE-DONE-THAT EXPERIENCE\nY'know, the experience isn't even unique.  The concept itself is unremarkable with the exception of their usage of an interior decorator that apparently got his or her training from \"Design Within Reach\".  'Prime' sells differing types of beef just as CUT does.  So does 'Craftsteak'.  Frankly, none of this matters because 'Envy' at the Renaissance grills a steak that beats the hell out of anything the others produce.\n\n3) LOUSY VALUE\nWe're not even going to go there.  Suffice it to say that the total bill for me & my wife during the last visit I had at CUT was an absurd $330 for two cuts, a couples sides, an appetizer and some drinks.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nAfter 2 visits, I won't be going back.  This experience was clearly not an anomaly & I'm standing pat on this review.  This is a fundamentally average steakhouse with hellacious prices & nothing about it compels me to return.  While the menu looks heavenly, it's partially because it was written by a sales guy, w/ marketing terms sprinkled generously throughout like \"Warm\", \"Kobe\", \"Wild\", \"Roasted\" & other superfluous adjectives to describe otherwise typical dishes.\nHere's a few other restaurants that definitely know how to prepare a steak better:\n- ENVY THE STEAKHOUSE  (As long as you don't expect ridiculous artwork or overly dramatic mood lighting, this will be great)\n- STRIPSTEAK (Service here is consistently slow here so be forewarned - you're going for the steak, not the service)\n\n3-Stars.\n\n--------------\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF CUT:  OBSERVATIONS FROM A SALES GUY...\nThe psychology of restaurant sales & operations is amazing here.  I'm really impressed:  It's clear that they've hired a restaurant consultant to optimize revenue because CUT is practically designed from the ground up to extract cash out of fools with money.  \n\nIf you hadn't already picked up on it, CUT's environment - particularly, their menu - is a very sophisticated marketing hook intended to imply that ordering 'good' isn't 'good enough'.  Everything about the menu is designed to extract a few extra dollars from you.    \nHere's the menu:  http://www.palazzolasvegas.com/assets/pdf/CUTmenu.pdf\n-- Notice that the menu uses a font that 'blends everything in'... including the prices?  (This is the exact same menu as the restaurant)\n-- Notice that the menu lists beef from most expensive to least in each category?  \n-- Notice how easy it is to 'gravitate up' to the Wagyu over the other two, thus having you pay $12-16 more.\n-- Notice how if you decide on the Ribeye, your eyes immediately gravitate to the Nebraska Corn Fed 16oz at $61 - $5 more than the Illinois.\n-- Notice that if you're on an expense account, the \"True Japanese Wagyu\" is boxed out to highlight the most expensive item on the list?\nNo one wants to \"buy the cheapest item\" at a supposed swanky restaurant like that which CUT implies.  The menu silently tries to upsell you to 'more expensive beef'.  It also tries to make you forget about the prices.  $9 for a few blue cheese crumbles?  $12 for a SIDE DISH of french fries?  \nNormally, I have an appreciation for this sort of mindf-ckery even when it's being done to me however, CUT takes this to an insane levels."

Water glass filled constantly, waiter coming by to check on us numerous times, and the bread waiter came by three times to offer his goods. My bone in rib eye was cooked perfectly. I got the bernaise sauce on the side and it was great. The Mac & Cheese was fantastic. I have nothing but positive things to say and would go back again."

From the hostess to the wait staff, to the decor of the dining hall and the table side service, my meal was great. \n\nThe steaks are what you aim for at Cut. They have categories of cuts with elevating prices based on their age and what they're fed. They also have a very competitively prices wagyu if you wish to try that cut. I had the prime rib medium rare and it was as exceptionally cooked as you could hope for. The sides were ok, with the spinach with egg topping the rather dull cauliflower by a good amount. The complimentary dessert, opening breadsticks, and bread were also a nice touch. The drinks are overpriced and although prepared table side during the meal, which adds to the evening's activity, my old fashioned was pretty light and not worth the $19. \n\nOverall I would say Cut offers a top notch steak experience at about $15 less of a price point for each cut for the same quality than most other places on the strip. This was a very quality meal and I would recommend Wolfgang Puck's restaurant to all. This is my second try of his restaurants in Vegas and he has yet to disappoint."

In the past, we paid $25-$50 corkage which was fine.  Cut limited us to only 2 bottles for 6 people.  We had 5 people, and of course we wanted to sit together, so we negotiated to get 3 bottles.  We tried to split tables as we get 2 per table, but they wouldn't let us do that.  So, we agreed to open 3 bottles.  They would charge $50 corkage.  That's $50 to open and drink a bottle of wine we brought to the restaurant.  They would waive that corkage fee if we bought a bottle from them equal to or greater in value than $50.  \nSo, we sat down and ordered our first 2 bottles of wine for $50 each, minimum.  Another person appeared and told us that, as our wines may have been worth more than $50, we would have to buy a bottle from them equal to or greater in value than each bottle we were opening.  Scott said he had bought his 2 bottles for about $10 in the 1990's.  Who knows what they're worth now?  They appeared prepared to haggle over the value of our wines.  This was such nonsense, we finally just got up and left.  They didn't try to stop us.  \nLast year, Carnevino accepted us without such stupid rules and we were allowed to bring our own wines.  We were told this is Wolfgang Puck's rules, so we had no choice.  In reality, they just wanted us to pay for hyper inflated wines from their wine list - they charge 4 or 5 times the market price of a wine - and also pay them for over priced steaks, together with terrible service.  We left, found Morel's, a much better restaurant, and enjoyed our wines and a great dinner.  The wait staff was attentive, helpful and appreciative.  Cut is not a place to eat if you want to be treated well, unless you have a huge wallet and willing to unload it there.\nNone of our party will ever patronize a Wolfgang Puck restaurant in this lifetime.  We encourage you to do the same."

A previous reviewer mentioned how the servers seemed modelesque, but I didn't get that at all.  There were servers of all shapes and sizes when I went.\n\nMy boyfriend had their sampler thing, which had 3 different cuts of meat.  He felt that the Wagyu ruined \"steak\" for him for the rest of his life because it was just so delicious and tender - he would never be able to eat regular steak again.\n\nI had the 10 oz ribeye American Kobe and loved it.  It was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Although I really wanted the Wagyu ribeye, I just couldn't bring myself to fork over $180 for a cut of meat.  Maybe next time.  They also brought us out a bunch of sauces on the house, so you really don't need to order any sauces on the side at all.\n\nThe sides, although good, I felt they were lacking.  We got 2 sides: pureed potatoes and mushroom.  The potatoes were average and the mushrooms I felt were a tad overly seasoned.  At first bite, they were delicious but after that, you just can't eat another bite cuz the salt just seems to overwhelm.  I would've preferred a simpler mushroom dish.  They could also spare to serve up larger sides, seeing that they start at ~$20 each.\n\nOverall, the experience was great.  The dining room was dimly lit and quite romantic - very chic, very modern.  At the end of our meal, the server brought us some complimentary desserts too.  Best perk of this restaurant - they serve pretzel bread!"

Received waters in a few minutes and a menu.  Waited another 10 minutes to see a guy walking around with a tray of bread to only have him offer it to the table to our left and then the table to our right.  He did make eye contact as he passed us but did not offer anything.  Another 3 minutes passed and another waiter dropped off a few Parmesan bread sticks out of nowhere at our table.  Another few minutes and nobody to take our drink order or food order so we left.  Passing the hostess as we stepped out she did ask what was wrong.  We told her we were tired of waiting so long to even order.  Mind you the restaurant only had about 10-12 people dining so no excuse that they were just too busy.  Walked around the corner to Del Monico's for a much better experience.  \n\nThe indication that the restaurant was empty on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend should have been a big giveaway hint.  And, the \"American\" kobe???  Is that like a piece of Kobe Bryant's ass?"

There were also other people that would come to our table to check on us and offer assistance all throughout the meal.  When my sister asked where the restroom was, a gentleman actually escorted she and my mom to the ladies room.  Nice touch.\n\nMy negative review is for the steak/kitchen.  We ordered our steaks medium well.  We received them medium rare.  No big deal.  We sent them back to be cooked a little longer but what we then received was a charred MESS!!  I mean my steak was completely black!!  You could not cut the top of the steak with the knives they provided!!  CRAZINESS!!   And to top it all the inside was STILL red!  I have never had a steak come out to me looking like that.  There was no excuse.  \n\nMy family and I were there to celebrate my sisters birthday.  We previously had an awesome experience there so we wanted to re-create that wonderful night.  Well it's true, you can't go home again because this time the kitchen truly screwed up.  The flavor of the meat was fine but trying to eat that bitter char on top was not working for me.  Truly ridiculous.  2 of the steaks we just sent back and did not get a replacement because of time, we had already sent the steak back once.  So a couple of us just ate sides for my sisters birthday dinner.  \n\nThe management did provide desserts on the house.  That was nice of them but really we just wanted to get out of there before the deli closed :-/  We were hungry!!!\n\nI loved CUT so much the first visit that I would have loved to give it more than 1 star this time.   Again the service was impeccable.  The atmosphere is chic and welcoming.  But seriously, the person that burnt those steaks up is ridiculous and should not be in a kitchen.  Even on my stove at home I wouldn't have demolished a steak that way.  I understand that everyone makes mistakes but that was terrible.    Only thing redeeming about the visit was the excellent service and the way it was handled.  But you make reservations for a special occasion simply for the atmosphere.  I wanted good food."

Even though this place isn't horrible, I'm giving it 3 stars because not only have I tasted better steaks, but because I know Wolfgang Puck restaurants (and worked at one), and I know the caliber they are capable of, and this restaurant doesn't reflect it.\n\nTrust me, I did not cheap out at this restaurant.  A buddy and I started off with steak tartare and the apple salad.  Let me tell you now, this was the most flavor I tasted through our whole time at Cut.  These two dishes are common in Puck's restaurants, so I decided to get them.  I'll admit, they didn't disappoint me.  I can't say the same for the meat.\n\nThe steaks weren't bad like overcooked and petrified, but I wish they had more flavor and more juicy.  I ordered the tasting of NY sirloin, where one of the meats was supposedly dry aged for around a month.  The kobe, which was naturally the juiciest of them all, was still a bit disappointing.  Not enough flavor and it tasted like it was cooked by the British.  My friend had the USDA Angus porterhouse, and he was disappointed as well.  The portion was right on the spot but like mine, it didn't have much flavor.  Then again, he comes from Texas, so maybe I can understand his disappointment, coming from the land of American meat.\n\nI can't remember what dessert I got- if I forgot, it probably wasn't that spectacular.\n\nAnyways, the service is fine.  The bussers and servers were very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu, which I appreciate because that really is our standard here in our city.  Even the bussers need to know the specs of the dishes- the ingredients, the way they're cooked, and the way they're supposed to taste.\n\nI should've called them out for lying though, because the dish I ordered wasn't \"great\" or \"fabulous\" or any other positive adjectives they could've used.\n\nOh, and as usual, the decor at Cut is very stylish and modern, as with any other restaurant that Puck has.  Don't let that fool you though.\n\nJust to let you know, Puck's empire of restaurants has expanded super quickly, that although service is still up to par, their roots from  fine dining and their delivery of the raw epicurean experience has somewhat diminished.  Vegas seems to have turned Puck into more of money-hungry business undergrad rather than enhancing who he is as a world-renowned European chef.  This is not just based off of my experience at Cut, but as my experience as a diner at several of his restaurants and as his former employee.\n\nSo yeah.. am I a vampire?  I stay up super late, totally not a morning person, and I like my steaks juicy.  I guess I'll just leave it to the French to serve me my steaks."

Service was 5 stars, the sides and the dessert we ordered were really good, however, I had to knock my rating down two stars because the star of the dinner, my wagyu filet, wasn't as good as I expected.  I was a little turned off when our sever brought out waxed examples of the different kinds of beef and explained the differences between kobe, wagyu, the marbling, etc.  To me this felt like they were trying to upsell me, I've never seen this before at a steak house, only when a place brings out their waxed trays displaying their desserts.  I would've been more okay with this if he asked us if we'd like the dog and pony show, because I already knew all the differences and already knew I was going to order the wagyu.  When my steak arrived, it was completely crusted with a blend of salt and other seasonings, now to me, a fantastic cut of wagyu shouldn't be covered in salt and seasonings, the meat should be so good that you need to add very little to it.  When a place salts as much as this place did, I question their quality of meat.  On top of my wagyu filet being super salty, they brought out three more little cups of different salts.  Holy saltiness, I couldn't even consider adding any more salt to this meat.  My wife's regular filet that she ordered was way less salty and tasted better than my wagyu, which made paying the extra for mine a very sad tale.  Most likely I won't return because there is plenty of competition in Vegas that will indeed not make me regret ordering the wagyu."

Service was solid, as I expected. I mean, really, at a place like this, you have certain expectations - and CUT meets, just doesn't exceed, all of them.\n\nI give a particular nod to the hostess, who managed to seat us in the dining room rather than the lounge despite our very last-minute reservation on a Friday night. Her reasoning? We dressed for the occasion. Amen to that. I still cannot get with people wearing tshirts, jeans and flip flops to these restaurants. I mean, really, can't you change after your day of gaming? Ew."

I had heard there was a pre-theater menu, but the waiter informed me that doesn't exist anymore. Before you order, a server comes around with a tray of (fake?) slabs of meat and explains the difference between the Japanese and American Wagyu steaks. I decided to order the American Wagyu ribeye and my bf ordered the American Wagyu filet. We decided to go with the mac and cheese as a side. The waiter said that the Mac and cheese used 7 year old cheese. \n\nThe full bread service here is amazing. A server came around with a tray full of a variety of different breads. The pretzel bread was my favorite; it was so soft with just the right amount of salt. The server had told us to expect a 30 min wait since the steaks are made to order, but I don't think I waited more than 15 min.\n\nDon't expect a fancy presentation with the steak. It is literally a piece of meat in the middle of a white plate. We both ordered our steaks medium rare, but I found my bf's filet to be more on the rare side. My ribeye turned out perfect though. It was flavorful and tender with just the right amount of fat. \nThe mac and cheese was delicious. It tasted more like a pasta dish than just regular mac and cheese. \n\nAt $88, this is by far the most expensive steak I've ever had. Was it worth it? I'd say yes!"

As we 11 of us head to Cut Friday evening we enter the upper level high tech looking CUT in the shops in the Palazzo.  A drink at the bar the check is easily transferred to the table which is a simple thing but not always easy at some of these places.  Bravo. \n\nSeated at table that REALLY CAN'T Fit 11  10 was pushing it but they could not accommodate us any other way so we make due.  Menu is different than your standard steak house for appetizers and sides while every type of steak, type of aged, time of aged, type of beef from True Kobe to American Kobe is available to you.  \n\nWe select a good bottle of wine ok 4 of them...and off we go...\n\nVariety of breads but the absolute winner is their pretzel Rolls OMG Good.\n\nAppetizers in no particular order\n\nCaesar Salad Top Notch with traditional dressing. \n\nBig Eye Tuna Tartare no my thing but those who had it said it was simply outstanding. \n\nCombination Maine Lobster, blue crab & Shrimp cocktail between Polenta was truly out of this world \n\nbiggest winner.. Homemade Burratta cheese with a pesto sauce that made you go HOLY COW!   All winners...\n\n11 hungry Hombres 11 steaks of all types I'll try to do my best on the reviews. \n\n3 Wet Aged 21 Day Bone in Prime Rib Eyes.. All grilled than Broiled and perfectly cooked. Taste was as it should be through and through not 1 complaint.\n\n3 wet aged 21 days Bone in 20 Oz NY Strips... I had one of these steaks and the two to my left and right were much thicker cut than mine while mine equally as tasty lacked the thickness debt that would have made this a never forget type steak. \n\n1 21 Day wet age 8 oz filet was sent back ...  said was just blah nothing to it...  I'll get to how it was retuned shortly. \n\n2 35 Day Dry aged NY Strips no Bone were good but could not compete with the wet aged cousin served earlier. \n\n2 Gentlemen split the 34 oz American WAGU for two and came away saying it was one of best steaks ever. \n\nSide Dishes: \nSpinach with Garlic was exceptional \nFries were very hot and tasty with some truffle oil\nReal winner was the Mac & Cheese that was hands down the best ever tasted. \n\nSide note the service here was nothing short of SENSATIONAL... From Appetizers to entrees if you have 11 guys and 7 sides 18 people show up to serve you each with a dish in hand to present your steak and serve sides simultaneously.  THE BEST Presentation of service I've ever seen.  \n\nEven returning the steak when the new one came out fresh sides were delivered to the person who had the off steak.. NICE TOUCH\n\nAll and all pricey YES - Can we have 2 bad steaks out of 11...Not something you wish for... but that keeps it from the 5 star rating should be 4.5  Atmosphere excellent and service was truly some of best I've ever seen.. Highly recommended."

Ordered a couple bottles of wine, the waiter nicely elucidated several aspects of the offerings, etc.  Appetizers were very good to excellent, the service attentive but not overbearing.  Having an enjoyable evening.  I ordered a prime bone-in ribeye.  It came cooked perfectly, but when I went to cut into it, it was so tough I had to mildly struggle to simply cut off pieces.  Should have returned it immediately, but thought perhaps I had just cut into a small bad part, and also didn't want to put a damper on everyone's evening.  To put it mildly, this was far and away, the absolutely worst steak I have ever been served in any restaurant in my entire life, and I am 75.  How this could possibly be labeled \"prime\" is completely beyond me.  If the worst steak I ever had was rated 6 on a scale of ten, this steak, at best was a 2.  Would not recommend this restaurant, especially given the $$$$.  A good evening ended on a very sour note."

I ordered the lobster for the table and I regret not ordering the entire thing for myself because it was outta this world good. just thinking about it makes my mouth water thank goodness im going back in two weeks to dine here again! =D We all ordered the steak i think everyone got the ribeye, as for the steak it was not nearly memorable as the lobster. I dare say CUTs lobster more than rival lobster at gary danko and french laundry. For apps the yummiest items that comes to mind is the pork belly and the bone marrow. the crab cake and apple salad was pretty good. french fries were french fries lol nothing else to say about them other than that. i did love the onion bread and the pretzel bread and i loved how they let you eat as much as you please because i LOVE onion bread cant get enough of it. we ordered i think half the sides on the menu but only thing really stood out were the spicy peppers. For dessert they gave me a baked alaska for my bday YUM! it was perfect way to end the meal. We ordered the souffle because i can never say no to chocolate souffle however it did fall short of expectations. I have to say Gary Danko and Alexanders makes it better. The banana creme pie cake was fantastic, so yummy you could really taste the fresh banana. For a group of 6 girls ordering an app, entree and side plus a lobster for the table the bill came out to be 150 a person of course given the exception that my girls wouldnt let me pay for my portion. Least to say it is obviously an expensive place to dine at but WORTH every penny."

HOWEVER, CUT proved me wrong that sometimes IT IS worth it... if it's at CUT.  Now, when a non-steak lover says it's worth it, I think it's worth trying out. Don't ya think? LOL\nWe started out with the bone marrow flan as recommended by other yelpers.  YUmmmy!\nI got the wagyu beef.  It was buttery goodness.  I forget what size I got, but it looked tiny!  However all the richness of the wagyu beef filled me up more than enough with two sides.  \nThe servers are attentive and they will educate you on all types of meats available and the different tastes, so you will have all the information before you decide what you want.\nBe sure to make reservations on yelp/ open table before heading over.  You will be less likely to get seated without reservations.\nDefinitely a must in Vegas when you feel like $plurgin and living it up~~~\nI live in Los Angeles, where we have CUT in Beverly Hills, but I'll be going back to the one in Vega$ real $oon!!!! :)"

It was a tad dark in there but that seems to always be the theme for steak houses.  We had a party of 8 and an excellent server.  (I don't remember his name bc it's Vegas and I was drinking!)  He started off by showing us the tray of all the different cuts and types of steaks they offer.  We ordered drinks then apps and entrees all at once.  He was being assisted by another female server and I think a third guy was helping out as well.  We started with cocktails and a round of shots which was my kind of start to a Birthday celebration!\n\nI don't remember what everyone ordered since it was a big table, but everything I tried was great.  I had bites from the tuna tartare, the heirloom tomato salad, the Alaskan King Crab & Carolina Shrimp\"Louis\" Cocktail, caramelized yellow corn, and the Filet Mignon.  When I tried single bites of things off the appetizer or salad plates I felt it needed salt, but when you made a complete bite of all the different elements on the plate, it was great.  And as for the steak.  It was delicious.  Great flavor and so tender. \n\nEven though the food and service was spectacular there were a couple things that I found odd which is why I didn't add that 5th star.  When I first arrived I needed to use the restroom and the doors to the toilet area were floor to ceiling.  All I could think about was the Seinfeld episode when George Costanza recommended that they extend the doors at Yankee stadium all the way to the floor.  I of course chuckled bc I love Seinfeld and any time I can reference back to it, I get happy.  But then I started to feel encased in a really clean and upscale porta potty.  Ok enough toilet talk, but yes I found it weird!  The second thing was after our drinks came they brought a few plates of bread for everyone to share.  I grabbed a pretzel roll which was cold so I wasn't sure why it was served with butter that wouldn't melt.  I then proceeded to peel the top of the roll off to try it, and my appetizer was set down in front of me.  I guess it was good that I didn't like the roll b/c the timing of these two offerings was off.  \n\nI'm not sure what our total bill was, but I'm guessing not cheap!  Our overall experience was fantastic and I would recommend if you want to splurge and indulge, this is a great restaurant inside the Palazzo to pick."

Don't be afraid to ask for your recommendations!  As with most other steakhouses, it's a la carte.  Great sides accompaniment and I liked everything we ordered: Herb french fries, wild mushrooms, creamed spinich, and brocoll-rapini.  The wine selection is fine and wide, with many choices by the bottle or glass.\n\nThe only other memorable part are the prices, ranging from $50-$120. It is definitely HIGH, so make sure you are having a good day at the tables!  But seriously, this is one fine dining experience.

After being seated, they came around with the Japanese and American Wagyu beef to show what the different cuts looked like. They then brought out bread (cheese bread was amazing!) and took our orders. \n\nWe started with the Alaskan King Crab and Carolina Shrimp Louis which was delicious, but at the $29 price point it was definitely on the expensive side. I would probably forego ordering this next time. \n\nI ordered the 9oz American Wagyu and my family members opted for two orders of the 35 day aged ribeye and a filet. The american wagyu beef was definitely more tender and rich in flavor than many of the beef steaks that I have had, but I guess it was not as amazing as I imagined it to be. I ordered medium rare and the steak came out perfectly medium rare with a nice crust to it. They also bring out a tray with dijon mustard, mustard with horseradish sauce, and seasoning salt which is a nice plus. \n\nDo keep in mind that the steaks are a la carte so things can get expensive fast. We also ordered the asparagus and potatoes for the sides. They were good, but not amazing. \n\nAll in all, the service was great and food was delicious, but for some reason I did not get that \"wow\" factor. The downside is that this places is slightly more expensive that other $$$/$$$$ steakhouses that I have been to such as Mastro's in SoCal, Harris' in SF, HOPR in SF, and Town in San Carlos, CA. For 4 people, we ended up shelling out a little over $400. \n\nWould I recommend this place? It is a great restaurant, but after dropping $400+ on 4 people, I wanted a little more from this place.

I'm not a big fan of steak houses but thought Cut would be different.  For the record, I didn't order the $28 an ounce kobe, I did order a dry aged new york sirloin.  It was a big piece of meat and that's what it was.  It was dry, flavorless, and very average.  I just wasn't impressed.  The wasabi-yuzu sauce was a nice compliment for the steak since it gave it some flavor.   For appetizer, I had heirloom tomato salad which I again thought was very average.  The salad was $21 and the steak was $59 and I don't think it was worth it.  For that same price, I could have ate somewhere else and probably had a tasting menu of some sort.  There wasn't anything spectacular about the meal, it just felt like over priced steak and salad.  \n\nThe service was relatively good, they were attentive and courteous.  The decor was somewhat depressing.  Perhaps they were going for the dim lighting of a steakhouse which is fine but I felt it didn't go well with the chairs and tables.\n\nThere were three of us and the bill was $336.

The maple glazed pork belly was incredible. I couldn't convince them to get the bone marrow flan so we had the crab and shrimp Louis. It was ok but I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nFor sides, the fingerling potatoes were very good and the mac and cheese is worth the $21. Two sides was enough for three people. For dessert I had the chocolate souffle. It was outstanding. The raspberry filled doughnuts were excellent as well. I sampled the black forest cake but wasn't too impressed.\n\nThis place is for special occasions and I'm glad we tried it. Oh, and get the pretzel bread when they bring it around."

The bus boy asked me how it was, I said it was not good, and he asked me if I wanted a new one, which was a lot better. That is why I'm giving them 2 stars. Out of 5 steaks ordered at our table, 1 person enjoyed theirs. For the price, they should be doing a lot better.\n\nMy brother, frustrated with his half of the porterhouse (~$150) put $200 down on the table and said \"I'm going to Chipotle\". He was just so confused by the quality of the steak that he didn't want to send it back to try another one.\n\nThe ambiance is also not my bag. It's a huge, noisy mess hall.\n\nI've been to Delmonicos, right down the hall, and I would recommend that place. Great steak, great ambiance."

Nice cocktail menu.. creative mixologists at work...I had the asian pear martini and my hubby the traditional ketel one martini a little dirty..  for appetizer the pork belly is a must try.. it is cruchy on the outside and buttery tender in the inside..perfection.. the butter lettuce salad it's amazing.. if you can believe that a salad can be amazing you should try this one.  With an array of choices from the meat menu could be quite intimidating but the servers are highly trained to help you make the best selection.  I chose the bone in petit filet mignon and my hubby tried the kobe filet both charred to perfection on the outside and buttery in the inside.. melts in your mouth.. WOW !!! worth every penny.. for sides we had the brussel sprouts and the spinach both excellent and for dessert the fig cake with gianduja ice cream YUM !

The texture and taste was really good. It was the most tender piece of meat I've ever had; so buttery and even though it was a small 6oz, I felt so full after eating their delicious bread and the steak with their sides. Their mac and cheese is so creamy and rich that I could only eat one spoonful of it.\n\nAnd what made the dining experience even better was their service. We never felt neglected. They came by often to check on us and I am not kidding you when I say our wine glasses were never empty.

Cooked medium rare, slightly overcooked, yet melts in your mouth. Perfect. Tasty. We got a few sides for the table, nothing too memorable. It looked like my gang was happy and enjoying the evening, all decked out in suits and ties, and that's all I could ask for. Perhaps it was just the male bonding that made this experience worth it.

This was one of the most disappointing steak experiences we have had. \n\nService started out amazing- super friendly server who explained everything. We were planning on getting a rib eye - probably Nebraska and aged. The server told us that the American waygu is her favorite and the best in the menu. That being said we went with it. We ordered 2 extra ounces for my husband which made the steak around $130 for one steak. \nBread tastes great, especially the pretzel roll but it was all cold. My husband and I found this odd. \n\nThe food came and unfortunately it was disappointing.  The steak was sooooo wood charred tasting. It almost tasted like camp fire. It was not tender and was actually hard to cut. It was not very warm even. It lacked salt. It was, to put it plainly, a mediocre steak I could have bought from Costco and prepared at home. \nThe Mac and cheese was some of the best I have ever had. The Brussels sprouts were good. \n\nHere is what really made this drop down from 3 to 2 stars. The server who was so attentive and friendly NEVER CAME BACK. Not one person asked how the steak was or we would have asked to have it warmed up a little. The assistants filled our water but never asked. We sat not touching our plates for at least 10 minutes when we were finished before anyone even came over to take the plates. It was truly disappointing. Finally once all was fine the server dropped dessert menus but never asked how it was. We wanted to get out of there and just handed her our card. The service and food lacked. If you want steak in Vegas do smith and Wollenskys or something else but don't waste your money on a $130 per person steak here."

I am not a fan of raw beef, but the tartare was very tender and just melted in my mouth. I thoroughly enjoyed my bone-in ribeye with bone marrow and wild mushrooms. Steak without bone marrow is just not as tasty. It was a perfect medium rare throughout and the side dishes complemented the entree well. We had sauteed spinach, mac n cheese, shisito peppers, and artichokes. The mac n cheese tops Morton's hands down. Creamy, with the breadcrumbs. It was a great suggestion by our server. I also tasted my date's dish of lamb. The crust was great and the sauce put me in heaven all over again. \n\nThe best part of the evening for me is always dessert.

They start you off with five types of complimentary bread (my favorite was the bread sticks). I ordered the 12 oz Rib Eye Steak medium rare...I couldn't find anything wrong with it except that it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. We split a bunch of sides including the French Fries with Herbs, Potato Puree, and Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg. The creamed spinach was arguably the highlight of the meal!\n\nWhether it's the sexy ambiance, impeccable service, or perfectly cooked steak, CUT is sure to be in the discussion for best steakhouses in Vegas. The Venetian/Palazzo is my favorite resort to stay at in Vegas, and if I'm not feeling adventurous for food one night, I know I'll always have a perfect meal waiting at CUT."

That said, CUT was by far the best steak I've ever had in my life, and I've been fortunate enough to eat at some pretty good steakhouses.\n\nOf course I knew my tab was going to be expensive going into the meal, so I let any inhibitions about money at the front door. I ordered a medium 8 oz wagyu petite filet ($100) with no sauces or rubs - I wanted to truly experience the steak and its flavors. When the steak came out, it was a perfect medium in the center, well marbled, tender, and felt like it was literally melting in my mouth. I normally eat incredibly fast because my line of work requires it - but this meal I ate as slowly as I ever have to prolong the experience as long as possible. I'd probably still be at the table now, 48 hours later, if it weren't for the fact that my steak was getting cold.\n\nIf you can foot at least $150 a head, I highly recommend CUT for your next Vegas trip. The food was to die for, the staff well mannered and professional, and ambiance terrific. I live in LA and can't wait to try the one out here now."

They just seemed annoyed when we asked about our table. \n\nOnce seated, it was another 15 minutes before anyone came by the table for a drink or food order. At that point, we asked to speak to a manager. He apologized and comped us two drinks. Unfortunately, the service did not improve. Nobody came by to get a second drink order. Basically, nobody ever came back to check on us and see how we were doing.

            "review": "Holy Cow!  No, really - my experience at CUT was one of enjoying a sacred piece of beef and all of the well-prepared accompaniments that a group of friends feasted on over a bachelor party weekend.\n\nOur dinner at CUT is more aptly described as an experience rather than a meal, and the experience began with the incredible service that the restaurant staff provided.  Our group of 7 was seated immediately upon arriving by a smiling, attractive hostess, who also places your napkin in your lap.  You are given a menu and can order drinks, and then a cart with the various cuts of meat is wheeled out in order to provide a brief, yet informative, beef tutorial.  \n\nTwo aspects of the service particularly stood out: \n\n1) Attention to detail - our group ordered two bottles of syrah, one from Washington and one from Australia to compare the two.  The wine server (I don't know that she was a sommelier) brought out our glasses, brought out the bottles and offered them to the guy who chose them, and upon his approval, swirled each of our glasses individually before pouring the wine.  I understand that this is how it is supposed to be done, but it is a practice I do not see in even the few nice restaurants I've visited.  I appreciate that CUT pays attention to these intricacies.\n\n2) Graceful and dignified - One of the guys in our party received a steak that was cooked to medium rather than the medium rare that he ordered.  when he brought it to the attention of the waitress, she handled the situation with the utmost ease, quickly looking at the steak and agreeing with him that it was not cooked to his specifications, then finding out how long it would take for another to arrive at the table, inviting my friend to continue to enjoy the one on his plate, then promptly outperforming her ETA by bringing out a new, perfectly cooked steak in just a couple minutes and delicately removing the partially eaten one.  Often, when someone you are dining with brings improperly prepared food to the attention of the waitstaff, it becomes an uncomfortable scenario.  The reaction of the staff at CUT makes it apparent that this is only due to poor training at other restaurants.  Even when other restaurants agree with you, the situation is often prolonged, creating awkwardness.  CUT has figured it out, and came out with a save that only enhanced their reputation.\n\nNow to the food!  We ordered the kobe sashimi, bone marrow flan, and the Austrain oxtail bouillon as appetizers.  The sashimi was fantastic (wish I had grabbed more as the plate went around!), the marrow flan had this incredibly rich umami flavor, though the texture is something I have only grown to appreciate in the last couple years.  The oxtail bouillon was good, but my least favorite of the appetizers.  The waiters also bring around a bread platetr with several different offerings - the pretzel bread was delicious and the carmelized onion foccaccia was tasty as well.\n\nAs we finished savoring the aptly-named appetizers (they are certainly not substantive, but they live up to their name with an unparalleled distinction), a fleet of servers came to the table with all seven of our steaks.  It was quite a sight - I think I heard The Ride of the Valkyries in the background as they approached.  I had ordered the bone-in rib-eye, and upon first sight, the steak was well-seared with a fairly uniform char across the surface.  The smell was amazing.  The servers also brought the french fries, spinach, and mac and cheese that we had ordered as sides, which were all great (I think these might be the best french fries I've ever had in my life), but at that point were mere distractions from the glorious cuts of beef in front of us.  We all cut right in and upon first bite you could tell that everybody was happy.  The steak is well seasoned with salt and pepper - there was no need, in my opinion for any sauces or accompaniments on top.  However, I had ordered the the Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho butter, and thinking of the flavor of the steak and the sauce is making my mouth water right now.  Worth every penny.  One quick note: I had the 20 oz Illinois bone-in rib-eye, and while it was a delicious cut of meat, I tasted the 16 oz Nebraska rib-eye that another friend ordered and I must say that the extra 2 weeks of aging make an amazing difference in the tenderness of an already tender piece of meat, and are well worth the relatively nominal price difference.\n\nIt took all of my concentration and will power to finish because I was so full by the end of the meal, but every bite was a celebration.  CUT wrapped the meal up well with several small pastries and cookies after they had cleared our plates, rounding out a truly memorable bachelor party dinner.  I think our meal ended up running about $1400 (so $200 per head), but the experience and quality of the food as a celebratory event was well worth that price.  I will be back!"

It came with slices of brioche so you could smear the delectable bone marrow on it. The brioche looked like small triangles of wonder bread, but definitely did not taste like cheap wonder bread. I'm sure a stick of butter was used on each slice, but it was delish! The bone marrow-delish!! \n\nThen we had the pork belly. Sweet and smoky. Very tender. Another must try! \n\nThen for our main entree, my friend and I both got the Tasting of New York Sirloin. The USDA prime was very tender and delish. The Japanese Wagyu-AMAZIING. so tender. Melted in my mouth. But I've never had it before, so I might sound a little over zealous. But seriously, amazing. Too bad the tasting only comes with 2 ounces of it. The American Wagyu. Meh.

Hey, there's precedence of the MVP going to the losing team: Jerry West in 1969 in the NBA Finals, Chuck Howley in 1971 in Super Bowl V (and now CUT).\n\nThe steak here is unlike any I've tried. It is a triple-threat, five-tool star player as they would say in the sports world. While there were several cuts, ages, and locations to choose from, I went with one of their more popular ones, the 14 oz NY sirloin aged 35 days from Nebraska. The aspect that makes this steak so magical is the crust. Oh, my god, dat crust! It was so crispy and charred on the outside with great seasonings while maintaining the perfect medium-rare on the inside. You can have additional sauces and toppings, but plain is all you need for flavor. \n\nService was excellent as would be expected from a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. We added on a couple of classic steak sides including the creamed spinach with fried organic egg and Yukon gold potato puree to round out our meal. The addition of the fried egg was a nice touch to an already delicious side dish. Bonus points for the complimentary puff pastry and small bite desserts to end our meal.

I will keep this short because my visit to CUT was over Labor Day weekend so it's been a couple of months, but what I do remember is a restaurant which goes off primarily its name and association with Wolfgang Puck.

You break them off at the ends and eat it like a biscuit. The service was very good, though I've had better at a competing establishment on the Strip.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that I got very sick the next morning from my steak. It couldn't have been anything else because I did not eat for the rest of the night afterward. I ordered the Kobe beef selection which was $80 more or less. The portion was small, but filling enough with the sides and complimentary chocolates added in. I will give the guys at CUT credit where it's due - they were able to get my steak medium-rare, exactly as I had ordered. However, my stomach was in bad shape when I woke up several hours later..

It was so good that I took the time to chew each one carefully and savoring each bite. I didn't ask for any sauces on it since I want to taste the meat itself. \n\nYou do, however, get an array of mustard based sauces in small cups. I thought that was neat, and the cheese sticks?! and the bread?! We also got the pepper and wild mushroom side, and the onion rings. Amazingly delicious. I didn't notice anything different with their \"french\" butter though, it tasted like regular butter with some sort of powder spice thing on top. I'm drooling now, thanks a lot CUT. \n\nbtw, the service was on point and you will come out FULL. So go in with an empty stomach, you'll love it."

My husband took me to vegas and this was on my list of MUST eat restaurants. \n\nHeres what I remember... we ordered the waygu sampler... and had a variety of sides...mac and cheese....and i dont remember the rest.... the meat...\n\nhow to describe the most delicious meat you will eve rhave. there was US waygu, Japanese Waygu and an Australian waygu. This plate did not come cheap. But the meat was so tender it was like i coudl have used a butter knife to melt through it.\n\nthe wine sommelier came to help us choose a red and he aerated and poured it for us using 4 seperate glasses. it was insane. over the top. but i felt very spoiled.\n\nafter the worlds most amazing dinner my husband asked if i could go in to the restaurant and meet the head chef as it was my birthday and i love big executive kitchens. I was told yes! I went back, the hwole staff was line dup to meet me and the head chef as well. We shook hands, talked a bit about food stuffs and got a photo. When i returned to my table a special dessert was brought out for me for my birthday. :)\n\nI have very fond memories here. and i believe my husband does too...mainly of the bill but he also enjoyed the food. im ruined for life. no other beef will ever trump Waygu beef. And cut is a fantastic place to celebrate a special occasion...as longas your okay with the insane price tag."

After a long debate we ordered the warm asparagus with poached organic egg, blue crab shrimp \"Louis\" cocktail, bone in rib-eye, pan roasted lobster, and mac and cheese. Everything was AMAZING except for the lobster. It was suppose to be 2lbs but it looked like a 11/2 lb (We sell live lobsters at my family restaurant). The lobster was not tender, it was chewy and that could be because they over cooked it a little. It was edible but I will never order it from here again. Do yourself a favor and eat here if you have not been here before."

Super juicy and seasoned just perfect. I added the caramelized onions and they were absolutely delicious! The mac and cheese that is made with four different cheeses was just to die for! It was so creamy and all the different types of cheeses made it taste so good! The other side we got was the creamed spinach. I liked it but probably would not order it again. It was very good but not as creamy and thick as I would of liked it. I like that they put the fried egg on top thought that was going to be good, but I would of preferred to have taken it off. They stirred the fried egg in, which added crunchy edge and I would of rather of kept that soft creamy taste throughout! \nOverall amazing experience and service was impeccable! A must try in Vegas!"

Bring money or try to win at the casino. Yes, most of the places in Vagas are bucks, but I left feeling we spent a lot of cash for an ok meal. \n\nWe started with a crab type salad. It was overly laden with mayo really diluting the taste of the crab. The greens that went with it were nice, but the mayo pretty much killed really enjoying this dish. Had to cut it with some of the pretzel bread which was very good. \n\nMy wife and I both had the steaks from Nebraska. They were good, but I've had better. Especially from Del Monico across the way. We also had the mac and cheese to go with it, which was good. \n\nWhat irked me was the wine list. Almost no bottles for under 200-250. That is essentially where the prices started. You would think for a steakhouse, you can can a wealth of choices for a bottle to go with your steak, but the list was way over the top expensive. We ended up getting a bottle they offered by the glass which turned out to be a great wine and cheaper, but I typically dont like to drink Pinot with my steak dinner. I'm not cheap either as I was looking to spend cash eating while in Vegas (Alex Restaurant at the Wynn, AWESOME)\n\nI would skip going here and go to Del Monico across the way. You wont get the sleek, hip modern atmosphere there but you'll get solid service, a better steak, and a wine list with a ton more choices."

It feels chic and not like a traditional steakhouse but it does't lose focus on what makes a great steakhouse great -- the steak!\n\nThe parmesan bread sticks are amazing (free). The dry aged NY sirloin is excellent and they cooked it perfectly medium rare -- highly recommend it. They got the perfect sear on top too. They don't have real Kobe beef here but the wagyu they did serve was quite flavorful. The cream spinach was great though portion was pretty small. The tempura onion rings were okay. You won't leave hungry here at least.\n\nThey do a great job with the overall experience though. They come out and show you the top cuts of meat and explain it to you. They also do a great job pouring the bottle and decanting it while explaining what to look for. The ipad drinks menu was a little weird cause it was so bright compared to the rest of the place and menus. \n\nI think it was a great spot. Not exactly cheap but that's what you expect at a steakhouse."

We fell asleep. \n\nI dined at CUT in Beverly Hills and loved it, the quality, and the service. Two months later when I was in Vegas, recommended CUT because I knew the quality of the meat and the cooking of the meat would be on point.\n\nWe waited for everything, and honestly, just bad service. Had to keep asking for things that weren't brought, sit with empty water and cocktails, and as stated, we all literally fell asleep waiting for them to clear our plates and bring the check. This lead and secondary server idea didn't work for us. The main waiter barely came over at all, and the second waiter while well meaning just seemed stretched, and he too disappeared for long periods of time. It was like they were always coming late for every part of the meal. Maybe it was where we were on the far end of the main dining room where they placed us (we did have a reservation). Even our drinks took forever from the time we sat down, both ordering and receiving. \n\nThe fact other reviews here are positive on the service, just makes me feel even worse that we were unlucky. At about $200/person, we expected better service. It was a special occasion.\n\nThe food and drinks were good, very good. The meat likely the best morsel I've had in my mouth in a good while. It was cooked perfectly. We were satisfied with the food.\n\nI would have emailed you directly, CUT, but your website doesn't list an email address."

We started out with appetizers and ordered the Bone Marrow Flan, American Wagyu Sashimi, Prime Sirloin Tartare and Roasted Weiser Baby Beats.  What can I say; I was in heaven already with the appetizers, very nice indeed. The Bone Marrow Flan just melts in your mouth; the flavor is like no other I've tried.  For the main course I ordered the Wagyu Filet Mignon, which they don't always have but it was a special night and they were lucky to get three entire cows flown in from Japan.  The normal cut on the filet is 6oz but I added an additional 4oz for roughly and additional $135, the temp was medium rare and it was cook perfectly. In addition, I enjoyed the Bone Marrow Flan so much; I decided to order a side of Bone Marrow for my steak.  I've been a hunter for over 30 years, so steak is what I do.  I've processed and cut my own steaks from the leanest of animals that run this earth and when I tell you that the imported Wagyu Filet was the best steak my palette has ever tasted, you can take that to the bank.  The atmosphere was very nice and upscale, the service was exceptional and it was a very nice touch bringing the steaks to the table to see the marbling.  When I have clients in town and I want to show them a good time, this is my go to place of choice.  If you are a connoisseur of fine meats and are truly on a quest to find the best cuts of meat possible, the \"CUT\" is a restaurant you should have on your must try list."

This is one of most expensive meals I have ever eaten, so if I am going to spend nearly $300 on dinner (w/o wine or other drinks) then it better blow me away. It fell woefully short of that. \n\n1. Bread selection-2 out the 5 we were offered were tasty. The rest were bland. The cheese pastry puffs were great, but then they were ruined in a way by being too spicy for bread.\n\n2. Drinks-I don't drink alcohol but the Arnold Palmer I ordered was way too sour. The second try was better, but was too sweet. I had to ask for more lemon and water it down to be enjoyable. \n\n3. Salads/appetizers-I ordered the seafood salad with lobster, crab, and shrimp. The top portion was tasty (I don't know how you could go wrong with the Holy Trinity of shellfish), but on the bottom there was this weird pudding/custard type of stuff that was way too sweet and took up most of the volume of the dish. For a $31 appetizer/ salad I felt that I deserved more than a little bit of seafood on top of a white mystery substance. My wife ordered the pink lady salad. It was good but dressed too lightly. All I could really taste were the TART pink lady apples. If I was to serve this salad I would have gone heavy on the almonds and cheese to balance out all of the tartness of the apples.\n\n4. Main dishes-My wife ordered the Dover sole. She can't tolerate garlic. There was quite a debate about the garlic (or lack thereof) in the sauce that goes over the fish between the wait staff and the kitchen. Finally it was revealed that the sauce hasn't had garlic in it for a few months, so she got the sauce. Her fish was deboned tableside, which was a nice touch, but meant that she had to eat her main before everyone else's meals came out so the fish wouldn't be cold. I had a bite and it was really tasty, but her complaint was that after eating her main, she was still a bit hungry as it was small. \nI ordered the Nebraska Rib Eye with a red wine reduction sauce. I would prefer my steak a bit warmer (I ordered medium) and with less spice rub. Also, the red wine reduction was just sweet-no saltiness or richness of a pan sauce like I make at home. The mustards were great to have at the table, but why would these be necessary? Mustard is usually used to cover up the taste of old meat! Having salt along with the mustards was smart and I used it. My steak sauce was lacking salt, so once I added the salt it was tasty. Definitly the most expensive steak I have ever ordered, but the not the best I have ever eaten, so yeah-a let down. Also, the other two ribeyes at the table had LOTS of grisle and fat. Mine was more lean and the fat rendered out more thoroughly.\n\n5. Sides- We ordered quite a few. Creamed spinach, my favorite side at a steakhouse was the most disappointing. The egg added to the spinach tableside ruined it for me. It tasted like a spinach and egg breakfast burrito. Not good at all. Whipped potatoes were very bland (lacking salt or butter). No one at the table liked them. Brussel sprouts were very good, but had so much sweetness they were like candied vegetables. The best side dish by far were the roasted sweet potatoes with curry spice. Very good, we ordered another one. The other side dishes were unmemorable. \n\n6. Dessert-I would skip dessert and go somewhere else if I dined with them again. My wife's berry tart was tasty, but she couldn't finish it. Way too tart and sweet. My banana cream pie was just OK. The bananas tasted a little under ripe and they were cold. The crust was not good. Nothing special here folks. Again, for the prices, you would expect to be at least pleasantly surprised, but no."

The decor was really nice in here.  It had a modern feel. The lights were dimmed which created a very relaxing and intimate setting. Perfect for a romantic dinner. We got a nice booth and a really attentive server named Carlos.\n\nDecor is nice and all, but we all know the food is really what matters.  After we ordered, another waiter came around with a platter of different breads. I got one wheat bread and one pretzel type bread. Apparently, the pretzel bread is their specialty. I could definitely see why. It was soft and delicious.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the \"A Tasting of New York Sirloin\" ($140). It comes with different types of New York sirloin:\n\n- Japanese Wagyu From Saga Prefecture 2 Oz\n- American \"Kobe Style\" From Snake River Farms 4 Oz\n- U.S.D.A. PRIME Dry Age From Nebraska 4 Oz\n\nAll 3 steaks were really tasty. Definitely, some of the best steaks I've had in my life. However, the best out of the 3 was definitely the Japanese Wagyu. So freaking good. It was nice and tender. My steak knife cut through it like butter. I can see why they only give 2 oz. too. Two reasons: 1) its the pricest per ounce and 2) I think since it's sooo rich and tender, if you get too much, it might be too much of a good thing.\n\nWe also got potato puree and mushrooms as sides and they were good too. But seriously, the steaks made my night.  Hanging out with Kristin C. was cool too I guess :)\n\nOverall, this place is great for special occasions. I might just have to go to CUT in LA just to get my Japanese Wagyu fix."

What can I say that hasn't already been said?\n\nThe space is beautiful and modern.\n\nThe cocktail and wine menu is presented via ipad so you can filter by price/country/grape/etc. I expected a varied wine list, but I was pleasantly surprised by the 2 delicious cocktails we had. Very well made and presented with cool huge ice cubes. Bonus points for having some inventive mocktails in there!\n\nYou already know the food is delicious. We followed all the yelp recommendations and they are spot on:\ntuna tartare (great, as expected). \nBone marrow flan (a must-try. I was scared to try it, but the waiter talked me into it and I'm so glad he did! It's a custard...a baby step to straight marrow).\nPretzel bread (It really is not an exaggeration to say, \"best pretzel roll of your life.\") \nNebraska ribeye (great steak. Duh)\nPork chop (this will surprise you - it's so smooth, not chewy, lighter than a steak)\nCreamed spinach with egg (a unique flavor, love the twist on the steakhouse classic)\nMushrooms & peppers (the surprise of the meal. Loved it)\nBaked Alaska (very good, but potentially too sweet. Not that I didn't eat it of course!)\n\nThe service was great the entire night, and I think that is what really set this experience apart for us. Everybody was friendly, offered great recommendations, anticipated every need, but not pushy or intrusive. They really made us feel like VIPs.\n\nFor all our food, plus cocktails, wine and dessert wines....$350. Obviously it's expensive, but seriously worth it for a splurge meal. You could easily conserve by splitting a main (it's a ton of meat, neither of us finished), skipping dessert, and having only one glass of wine each."

Japanese Kobe is the best though - so go for that if you just want to stick to the best.

I made reservations a week ahead for 8 PM on a Friday night.  \n\nThe atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is modern.  The menu isn't cheap,  the steaks avg from $60 - $200.   I ordered the Rib Eye Wagyu/Kobe beef which was $85.   For the side items, we ordered mac and cheese, potatoes, and spinach.   It took awhile for the food to come out, so we loaded up on the breadsticks and bread they are complimentary.  \n\nOut came the steaks..  It was cooked beautifully.  It was seared and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I got the sauce from Argentina and this complimented the steak very well  It was a perfect amount of food, and the hightlight of the evening.  \n\nI will recommend to all!"

My husband and I love a good steak, and after being here for a year, our good eats are all starting to blur together. And not that we want to be food snobs, but the bar is set pretty high for us now. We decided to try CUT for my birthday, and I have to say it was one of my favorite steaks in Vegas. \n\nYou don't need to spring for the Wagyu in order to have a delicious, cuts through like butter steak here. My corn fed petit 8 oz filet was cooked to perfection! We also had the mac and cheese, carrots, and potatoes for side. The pretzel bread is so good, and they bring the bread selections around multiple times. Service was warm and friendly from the hostess stand to just passing waiters on the way to the restroom. I also really appreciated they had a Burgundy on the wines by the glass selection. It was pricey, but it was nice to not have to commit yourself to drinking an entire bottle just to get something other than a North or South American red.\n\nCUT has definitely earned a place on my \"Best Of\" list."

I got the American Wagyu ribeye and was not disappointed (well, it was a thinner cut than I expected but that didn't affect the quality). This is what a steak should taste like. The appetizers were terrific and the chocolate souffl was really good although I was so full by then I could barely eat it. One thing you must try is the Bavarian pretzel that is offered from the bread selection - it is FANTASTIC! The service was friendly and surprisingly casual. After receiving our menus we never really felt ignored or had to wait for anything. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and made some good suggestions but a tad too many to begin with. We were very happy with the wine we eventually chose.\n\nThe atmosphere is modern and very hip. This is a typical \"upscale\" Vegas restaurant - you see people in everything from suits to t-shirts to shorts (yes, I'm talking about you... the guy with the woman dressed to the nines - can't you at least clean it up for dinner??). Probably not a great place to take kids but really there aren't many nice restaurants in Vegas that are. Parking is not a problem as they offer valet at the hotel.\n\nGreat food doesn't come cheap and this is no exception. If you're willing to drop a couple Franklins per person on a terrific dinner and you love great steak this is not to be missed."

Fresh, salty, sweet perfection.\n\nMy husband had the heirloom tomato salad with Humboldt Fog goat cheese, white anchovies, and Tuscan olive oil which he seemed happy with.

Jasper ordered a green peppercorn sauce that he never ended up using because the steak was so flavorful. I had some creamy horseradish sauce that was divine.

The steak was cooked perfect.  The chocolate mousse cake for dessert was excellent.  They even brought my girl a little birthday dessert with a candle.  CUT has been featured as one of the top 3 steakhouses in Las Vegas and there was alot of hype and buildup going into this place prior to my dining experience.  I think that's where I deduct one star was because the hype was so great.  Don't get me wrong, everything was extraordinary but I guess it's kind of like when a movie comes out and everybody raves about how it's so \"great\" then when I finally see it I just think it's ok."

I sat on the end so I got to see the waiters serve wine, prepare someone's lobster from shell to plate, refill Voss sparkling and still water, etc...\nAmuse: cheese puffs...nothing special.\nCocktail: can't remember the name, but it was citron, sweet n sour, limoncello and amaretto..with a cinnamon-rimmed glass...soo good\nWine: Bottle of red, yummy- not sure what is was because it was picked out before I arrived, went well with beef of course\nBreads: Choice of pretzel, onion focaccia, pumpernickel, and sourdough. I went with pretzel - very soft and yummy, but not warm.\nAppetizer: Tuna Tartare...super delicious reddest tuna I have seen, covered in beautiful avocado slices and masago, with 4 corners of plate covered with baby sliced radishes and cucumbers, ginger, wasabi, and kaiware sprouts + togarashi toasts\nEntree: The disappointment of the evening.  I ordered the 8-hour slow-cooked kobe beef short ribs \"Indian style\" - served on pureed mint \"raita\" and corn puree.  The curry sauce was wayyyyy too strong...ruined the meat flavor and made it hard to stomach.  The meat was cooked well but really, I could barely touch it.  I know it is a steakhouse so I probably should have gotten a steak, but my stomach didn't agree with that idea so I went with something easier to chew :)\nSides: I picked out the wild mushrooms and shisito peppers which I thought were amazing.  I also really liked the cavatappi mac n cheese, and the tempura onion rings.  Didn't try the fries.  The sauteed spinach and polenta were tasteless.\nDessert: Ice cream sandwich with cherry coke float (I only tried the float) and bruleed banana cream pie (I had some banana with chocolate caviar crisp things, that much of it was tasty).\nThe servers brought out more little rectangular bars that I had no room for, but one was \"upscale Snickers,\" key lime pie, and chocolate fudge.\nService: Very thorough.  Intimidating when sides came out as each side had a waiter bombarding each person at the table with \"Do you want some of this?\"  Water was refilled ASAP, and all of the servers knew who had sparkling and who had still.  When cocktails were finished, the glasses were removed quickly.  Servers were friendly, information on each steak was provided before we ordered, and the waiters made sure we knew what sides were ordered when it was our turn so we could get something else for the table.\nOther: The other person who ordered short ribs didn't like them either.  The lady who ordered lobster said it took so long for the server to take it from shell to plate that it was very cold.  Also, they delivered 4 types of mustard and did not explain who or what they were for, but charged for other sauces.\nSummary: I would return as everything but my entree was flavorful and the service was decent.  The drinks were great too.  I would probably work out for 8 hours and fast so I could fit a steak in, but at least my kobe was tender - if it was just in the mint and corn purees and without the curry I bet it would have been simple and fantastic."

            "review": "We came here in a group of 5 for my boyfriend's birthday dinner.  The cocktail menu was featured on an iPad, which was a very cool concept.  I ordered the \"Lots of Love\" cocktail, which was a good mix of sweet and sour.  We ordered the American Wagyu porterhouse for two ($190) with wild field mushrooms and bone marrow.  As for sides, we ordered the french fries with herbs, creamed spinach, and the mac and cheese.  The house bread served at the beginning is delicious, especially the pretzel bread with the butter.\n\nWe were told it would be 15-20 minutes for our steaks to arrive, but it took about 45+ minutes.  The servers cut the steaks for us, and even served our sides to us.  I must have had really high expectations because I thought the steak was only mediocre.  The sides, especially the mac and cheese and wild field mushrooms, were excellent though.\n\nOverall, I thought Cut was just another average steakhouse.  There was nothing really \"special\" that stood out from it.  I've experienced better at STK and SW in Vegas.  Although the service was consistent, (they constantly picked up our plates and refilled our waters) minus waiting longer than told for our food, I'd definitely look into other options next time I'm in Vegas."

            "review": "I made my bf make a reservation about a month before our trip to Vegas.  We studied the menu quite awhile beforehand.  It's important to carefully consider what to eat if you're going to spend a few benjamins!  We started with the Maryland blue crab and Maine lobster \"Louis\" cocktail.  This was surprisingly fresh.  You can taste each of the crab or lobster when separating them into their own bite, but taking in a little bit of seafood, avocado, microgreens and tomato - everything just melds together.  I would have never guessed that the extra creamy bottom layer was panna cotta.  I wasn't into the ultra thin parmesan breadsticks or gougers (too much cheese), but was a bit more enticed by the bread selection.  I choose the onion focaccia, which was a bit salty and super soft, but the onions were sweetly caramelized.  I stay away from pretzels in general, but tried a bite of my bf's roll - best pretzel ever.  Also there's no salt on it.  The menu online offered a bone in filet, but was not currently on the menu.  After having more than a few prime filets in the past couple years, I decided to take it to the next level with an American Wagyu filet and topped it off with wild mushrooms.  Absolutely the most tender meat that has ever melted in my mouth to date.  My bf had the dry aged New York topped with bone marrow.  The marrow pieces had a fascinating shape and texture, looking like gnocchi but bursting like gelatinous blobs.  We shared the creamed spinach with fried organic egg.  The egg adds quite a bit of extra richness.  Splitting the appetizer and sharing one side gave us just enough room for dessert.  The carmelized banana cream pie with valrhona pearls was a delight.  The pearls were like little crunches with a layer inside the slice and scattered on the plate.  There was also a scoop of roasted banana ice cream for cooler contrast.  With the bill arrived yet more sweets of a piece of incredibly rich truffle-like chocolate and not as sweet, chewy cashew caramel.  Overall, an amazing meal.\n\nService was very good, but not perfect.  The d\u00e9cor is way modern.  I'm not sure I like the swivel chairs with mesh bottoms.  Also I wore a super short skirt, so I felt a bit self-conscious.  Not to mention the mirrors all around, although they let me see what was happening all around without having to swivel.  Now I gotta go downgrade some of my other steakhouse reviews..."

We went there to celebrate my birthday and someone else's. \n\nI enjoyed the service by Carlos who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. After viewing the menu he returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts they all look very enticing.\n\nMy husband and I ordered the bone marrow flan appetizer as well as the Maine diver scallops both were a blissful combination of ingredients and love, simply unbelievable. I will be craving this for months to come. I ordered the Petit Filet Mignon and my husband ordered the ribeye steak. The beef was perfectly tender and seared. For the sides we had the Brussels sprouts and Mac n cheese delicious. \n\nFor dessert we had the Baked Alaskan it was to die for. \n\nDefinitely coming back on our next trip to Vegas. Service was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But I have to say Carlos made all the difference!!"

The king crab/ shrimp appetizer I didn't care for as I thought there was way too much mayo but my fianc\u00e9 liked it. This place gets 4 instead of 5 stars as the hostess gave me a hard time about all the booths being reserved except for the one by the cold a/c / door and I sat there half of dinner watching those tables remain empty- (we had a reservation too)- we were celebrating being newly being engaged (which we let them know it was a special occasion) and had hoped for a quieter table- the server was awesome and the food was great but the hostess could have used some work."

We went in on a saturday night labor day weekend w/o reservations and ordered sirloin and ribeye with pork belly and heirloom tomatoes as starters.  waiter brings a huge plate of raw meat stacked on top of each other and begins explaining which one is which; this is a cool show but that's about it.  steaks were a bit overdone probably because the surface of the steak was real hard to begin with; i'm sure their meats were good, but just their cooking methods are questionable.  Pluses: oregon pinot was excellent, pork belly was better than the steak, heirloom tomatoes were great as well.  This is the 1st time that the starters were better than the entrees.  Alexander's and pinot brassiere are better imo."

They still put you close to other tables however.  The chairs swivel like office chairs.. very cool. We arrived 20 minutes early and were seated immediately.  We came dressed casually.. \n\nThe prices are more.. $10-$20 more for the steaks.  I remember the WAGYU I had was the best steak I've ever had, so I decided to pay up for something I know is good, than risk it on a new steakhouse that could be mediocre for maybe 15% less. \n\nWhen describing these steaks, I'd say that they're very high end quality, but the way the season them is like no other.  I would say it's like they put some kind of meaty butter flavor on them, but lock in the flavor with the char.  The butter doesn't fall off like at ruth chris. I've never had a steak like this before.\n\nWe ordered two petite filets. I was amazed because the aftertaste was similar to the wagyu I had before. It's from the seasoning they use on all their steaks. One of the steaks wasn't charred as well throughout the entire piece.. this was a very minor detail though. The seasoning is really good.  They did give us 4 sauces for free that we didnt get at the BH location. I tasted them and didnt like any -- they were extremely strong, and the steaks are so good any sauce would ruin them IMO. One of the bread pieces I tried wasn't as good -- they put onion in it, and it was cold when it was served warm in BH.  I tried the pretzel bread and it was very good. The cheese bread was my favorite, but I wish they refilled them! The service was noticeably better here. We got refills of bread, and drink refills promptly.\n\nWe tried the creamed spinach.. and wow, I have to say it was very buttery and salty, but was excellent.  We tried the french fries before and thought they were mediocre so the spinach is a better choice.\n\nThey were out of the japanese wagyu filet.. If they had it I would've ordered it.  It was the best piece of meat I've ever had.\n\nAfter just eating at del friscos the day before, these steaks were worth the premium.\n\nOn the receipt, we got a coupon for 25% off about 4 or 5 other wolfgang puck restaurants on the las vegas strip.\n\nWe can't wait to go back to the CUT in BH.."

            "review": "One of the best, if not the best, steakhouse I have been to. We went here a couple of weeks ago while in town. I was skeptical as I have been to a few Wolf Gang Puck restaurants in the past with mixed results, but Cut is a grand slam. \n\nThe restaurant isn't very big, I would highly recommend a reservation, which they make easy to do via Open Table. The service from the very beginning was fantastic. All the servers were very attentive and Mark, our main waiter was excellent, I would highly recommend being seated in Mark's section. His recommendations were spot on, he was attentive but not over bearing, and very friendly. \n\nThe seafood Louie appetizer and the tuna tartar were excellent with great flavor. They serve a variety of bread, all of which were clearly freshly made and they were delicious. \n\nNow the most important part, the steak. All of our steaks were cooked perfectly, seasoned well and we all agreed were the best we have had. They serve a selection of mustards and sea salt to compliment the steaks. I would have to say that the American Wagyu Beef was worth the extra money, melt in your mouth tender and incredible flavor. \n\nNot wanting to forget the dessert we had to try the Banana Cream Pie. This dessert is life changing. Just the right size, balanced flavor and we all cleaned our plates despite being stuffed from dinner. \n\nIn the end this place is really expensive, but you get what you pay for and it's definitely on the list of places to return to."

We got a few complimentary bread appetizers. I ordered a beer. The drink menu given to me was an iPad. The waiter straight up gave me an iPad as a menu--that was a new experience.\n\nAnyway, we ordered 2 steaks and a couple of appetizers. We got the Maple Glazed Pork Belly, the Bone Marrow Flan, a Filet Mignon, and the Australian 100% Wagyu beef steak (the most expensive thing on the menu). Was it worth it? I guess so. To be honest it kind of tastes like a regular steak. You really have to concentrate on it to taste the difference in quality/texture/etc. I'd recommend getting any quality meat rare as possible. If it's truly a high quality cut of meat, then the rarer the better because you'll get the true taste of its origin and chances of developing some disease from undercooked meat is very low.\n\nWe got no dessert.\nRight before we went in the restaurant my friend would a quick $100 on blackjack so it wasn't a hard decision to get the $150 steak."

            "review": "CUT was one of the best, if not the best steakhouse experience I've ever had.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was a very nice decor - somewhat minimalist, but a bit trendier I'd say than the traidtional wood panelled steakhouse, but not in that i'n your face' all style, no substance way. I think Id say very classy. The area was a dimly lit (but not overly so) open space with relatively high ceilings and good spacing between tables. Also, for those gentleman hoping to impress a lady friend, the pictures on the wall of brad pitt and denzel washington (depending on your gal's preferences) combined with the wine selection should help your cause. CUT is good for various purposes - for example, in the room I was seated, there was a large table of friends (10-12 of mixed gender), a date (me, haha, look at me, right?), and a table of about 4 elegant, but young looking grandmas (love seeing a bunch of grandmas out to devour steaks!). \n\nService was friendly, attentive and considerate. They start with the iPad wine and drink selection, which is great for two reasons: (1) the date looks at me like I'm classy trying to pair the correct grape and vintage for the type of steak we are getting, while I am actually just sorting from lowest to highest price and obviously going for the cheapest bottle they had (see above, the whole Brad Pitt thing, fine wine is no longer needed).  (2) I can obviously check to see if Clash of Clans is also on the iPad so I can make sure my village isn't being raided while I go out for dinner. One thing I will note on the service, I get they are trying to educate the consumer, but the meat cart ala Mortons 1998 is really not needed. But who am I to tell Mr. Puck how to run a restaurant - He did afterall, have a guest appearance on the show Las Vegas in ohhh 2005, which really upset me that they never finished it a made a season 7.  \n\nAnyway, the menu was very interesting, and I kinda liked the different categories of steak. For appetizer we went wtih the crab/shrimp/avocado thing, which was one of the best appetizers I've ever had in  my life.  I would say def give it a try. Also the bread selection and butter was excellent.\n\nSo on to the steak - we went with the Weygu ribeye, and I had the Wegyu sirloin sampler, medium rare.  both were cooked perfectly and were some of the best steaks I've ever had.  Also, I love when you get a plate with a hunk of meat on it (in my case, 3 lil guys), and not a whole bunch of garnishes and silliness which is an attempt to mask the fact you aren't getting a good steak. So you can order sauces on the side (mine came with sauces), and the sauces were all really good - for the bread and the onion rings (which were very good by the way, not too greasy). Because, while I am not going to judge, these weren't really the kind of steaks to put sauce on. The otherside we ordered was creamed spinanch - also excellent.\n\nI had the mango gelatto white cake thingy for dessert, which was just ok - I don't know if it was the dish, or just my palate, but figured Id try a dessert anyway.\n\nLastly, the price - $$$$, as you probably already know.  It's very expensive, but in my opinion, well worth it for a special occassion. Maybe I'll have good luck at the slot machines and be able to splurge for it again, but until that time, I guess I'll be choosing between Denny's and the Outback on the Strip."

CUT includes great little touches such as amazing pretzel bread and tasty Parmesan cheese sticks before the meal and warm cookies served after dessert. The wine and champagne were delicious and the service was impeccable, but the food really stole the show! \n\nI had the burrata appetizer and it was melt-in-your-mouth creamy and delicious; a fantastic combination of flavors. I also ate about five of the pretzel rolls, which I started to regret once the entrees and sides rolled out. But they were really delicious so I didn't regret it thatttt much.  \n\nFor my meal I ordered the Japanese Wagyu New York cut and as the waiters described it was incredibly tender. It does melt in your mouth but I found that sensation was mostly because the meat has so much marbling. I actually preferred my colleague's Wagyu Rib Eye because it was less fatty. \n\nWe ordered the following sides:\n--Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg- Creamed spinach is my go-to steak side dish and this one did not disappoint\n--Cavatappi Pasta Mac & Cheese- Easily some of the best mac and cheese I've ever tasted\n--Polenta with Parmesan- Good but not the best\n\nAnd desserts, all of which were fantastic:\n--Creamsicle Baked Alaska\n--Fuji Apple & Medjool Date Crumble\n--Valrhona Chocolate Souffl\u00e9\n--Banana Cream Pie\n\nOverall I'd highly recommend CUT for a special night out on the town."

Perfect steak and appetizers, great wine list, and I would say one of the top wait staff service experiences I've had in my entire life. I had the steak sampler that included some wagyu, American wagyu and I think a New York steak... Includes a selection of sauces. This was the best steak I've ever had and came with really enthusiastic service. If you are in Vegas it's definitely a must eat if you like steak and have some money to spend."

Hands down the most observant and thoughtful staff. Most of the food was great except for my Steak. My husband and I are big time carnivores! We love steak always go to Mastro's and let me tell you we will continue to go there for our steak. I ordered the American Wagyu For $88th and only 9 oz. I ordered It Medium and it was tough dry and totally lacked flavor. I was so disappointed. But I ordered it so I didn't want to complain so I didn't. So I'll say this for great drink , appetizers and bread go to Cut. But it you want an amazing high quality steak go to Mastro's! Wolfgang sorry your steak just didn't do it!"

It's like watching a movie with a great beginning but only to fall short at then ending leaving the viewer unsatisfied and wondering what happened?\n\nWhen a starter is so great, it sets the pace for the rest of the meal -- thinking that everything after can ONLY get better. WRONG. My SO's ribeye, as he described it, was \"charcoal on a stick...\" My filet was kinda tough, dry and lacked flavor. Totally not like the bone-in filet at Mastro's. At Mastros, it's so tender and velvety and melts right in your mouth. Mmmm... mastro's.... Oh wait, this is CUT.\n\nThe starters: weiser farm's cavallon melon, prosciutto di parma, fresh burrata cheese, tuscan olive oil & the bone marrow flan, mushroom marmalade, parsley salad was delicious! The creamed spinach was nothing spectacular and I didn't appreciate the egg on top. Don't get me wrong. It was edible just not exciting. Neither was the morels... this was WAYYYYYYYY salty. What could have saved the meal ended up with more disappointment. Dessert was okay. Seemed like a cheap rough version of a delicate mille-feuille (even though they call it a tatin), served with gelato and berries. Booooo..... I give the whole experience maybe 5 of 6 out of 10."

The portions were much larger than expected. They even start you off with a huge selection of bread, so don't make the mistake of loading up on carbs. In regards to the steak, we had to try the American Wagyu Beef. I ordered a Filet Mignon (6 oz) with caramelized onions and the peppercorn sauce. It was the best steak I've ever had. It was so moist and perfectly cooked. We got the creamed spinach and mac and cheese as sides, and this was way more than enough food. To top off our meal, we ordered the banana cream pie, which was fantastic. They also served some small dessert samples which were okay, but I would recommend trying one of their house made desserts."

Those who wanted their meat cooked longer got theirs just as they requested. I also has a wonderful roasted squash soup with chanterrell mushrooms. Simply the best I've ever had.

Coming to this restaurant was just too convenient to pass, and the fact that it is a Wolfgang Puck restaurant made it that much more of a desirable dinner choice. \nWe were sat very quickly and within minutes we had a wine menu in front of us. We both chose a Malbec that was so amazing!!!\n\nWe chose 2 items from the Appetizers section but I don't remember their names.... One had oxtail and bone marrow dumplings? It was really good, weird, but good.\nAnd I chose a Baby Beet salad with this insanely delicious cheese on top. \n\nSo far, dinner was great!!!\n\nWe got the Porterhouse Steak for 2 as our main course with a side of cream spinach and mac and cheese. The steak was perfectly cooked. It came with all these different types of sauces so it made it fun to go through such a large piece of steak. \nThe spinach was.....ok. Not my favorite! But the hubby to be really enjoyed it. And the mac and cheese...... it is worth the extra few bucks. OMG.\n\nOverall the experience was great, I can see why everyone is so amazed by this chef and his restaurants. They did not miss one detail. Everything was perfect. \nOne thing I noticed that I absolutely loved, all the waiters serve the food at the exact same time. There was a table of 8 gentlemen next to us and when they got their food, 6 or 7 food runners rounded the table and once they were all set in place, they set the plates on the table simultaneously. I liked that.\n\nI'd like to go back some time. Maybe try the Beverly Hills location"

As for the food, the steak is ok relative to its peers (Morton's, Ruth's Chris, etc, etc....), the potato puree tasted muuuuuchhhh better, and the cheese breadsticks were probably the best!  Chocolate souffle was also so so (perhaps it's because I am comparing to one I've had at the Phoenician resort in Phoenix and have yet been able to try another one just as good).

I had such a memorable meal here that when I started looking at my pictures again, it immediately made my mouth water! \n\nWolfgang Puck may have an empire of restaurants and you'd probably dismiss him as another celebrity chef trying to make another dollar but CUT is everything you'd want in a modern steakhouse: classy atmosphere but not over the top, food is well executed in both flavor and techniques, flawless service and of course, break the bank prices. \n\nWhile the bf chose to order an ahi tuna tartare with sliced avocado and tobiko (wonderful!) and a ribeye (heaven!) off the a la carte menu, I went with the prix fixe menu instead.  Roasted beet salad, Petit filet mignon with mac n cheese and braised winter veggies.  Dessert was a banana cream pie. Everything was perfect.\n\nBread is usually an afterthought but this is important to me. A restaurant like this can't achieve 5 star status if all the details aren't thought of.  You can munch on perfectly crisp parmesan sticks, pillowy soft onion focaccia bread or one of their housemade rolls.  All are outstanding! I'm a huge bread person, I can give up rice but not warm fresh out of the oven bread. \n\nAnd the cocktails here? amazing! even a simple gin & tonic is well made. I remember having the BEST Aviation cocktail my taste buds have come into contact with.  Not a lot of places carry Creme de Violette, let alone make an Aviation the way it should be. \n\nWolfgang Puck has outdone himself. This restaurant is truly, a CUT above the rest."

I ordered a $200 magnum bottle of Frogs Leap which was very reasonably priced.  When the sommelier came by and started opening the wine he actually freaked me out.  He started pouring a little bit of wine into each glass just to coat it, decanted the rest, and basically treated it as if it were a $1300 bottle of Chateau Margaux.  Mid-way through his process I stopped him to double check that I hadn't accidentally ordered the next wine on the list (some $900 bottle) as I was not paying for the meal but was given the honor of choosing the wine. He laughed and actually thanked me saying that I had given him the nicest compliment of the night.  \n\nFrom there on out, the rest of the meal was wonderful.

We got there about 10 minutes prior so we decided to get a drink and wait at the bar. The hostess came up to me when our table was ready with a really nice compliment.\n\nI didn't like how we were seated in the open, near the aisle, to the restroom, but I didn't get a lot of traffic walking by so it did not seem to bother me later. Our server came by as soon as we were seated. We were given these delicious thin bread sticks that had some type of cheese melted on it. We then placed our order.  After placing our order, another person came by and gave us a choice of other breads they were serving. I believe they served 5 different breads= prezel bread, onion foccaccio, walnut bread, port bread, and pumpernickel bread.\n\nFor the appetizer we ordered the bone marrow and pork belly. OMG.. Bone Marrow was delightful. It was served with some type of mushroom puree which gave some earthiness to the creamy marrow. We also ordered the pork belly. Pork belly was a bit crispy in the outside and I love the texture of the inside of the fat. The dish had a balance of sweet and spicy.\n\nI ordered the American Wagyu Filet Minon medium rare with a side of bearnaise. It was perfectly charred on the outside and medium rare in the inside. I took a bite without the sauce. I could taste the smokiness and the salt and pepper. The steak was phenomenal. The piece of steak literally melted in my mouth like butter. I did try a bite with the sauce and of course the sauce was delish, but you really don't need a side sauce with these steaks. My boyfriend ordered the USDA Prime Nebraska corn fed Rib Eye at medium.  Same thing.. Absolute perfection.\n\nWe had the mac and cheese as our side. I didn't think much of the flavor because I was so into my piece of steak. \n\nWait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely recommend this place."

The tables aren't as tight, the service is a bit more on point and I do get a kick out of seeing the bits of cow before it goes in to get cooked. We tried the bone in ribeye and the wagyu tasting trio. Considering how small the pieces of the trio look, you will get full since the ounces do add up. It's hard to eat wagyu while you're eating anything else- the marble meat just melts in your mouth and makes all other meats feel tough and blah. Fatty fatty wagyu, what have you done to me? \n\nThe steaks were good (even the ribeye was decadent the next day, cold but delicious). However if I were to compare the quality, I would say that steakwise, Craft edges out ahead. I felt their cuts were cooked to more of a flavorful end. The ribeye was a little dry (I got medium) and the wagyu was good but lacked the umph that I got from Craft's fabulous skirt. (The Craft's ribeye was good too, but the skirt was amazing for the price.)\n\nSides were typical, water was refilled and we had a good dining experience. The place gets filled up after 7:30 so reservations are recommended!"

These men in black are awesome, though, and the service is what you'd expect for a meal that costs as much as an Ikea sofa.\n\nMeal-wise this place is all about the Wagyu, Japanese or American. If you don't get this looking at the menu, they hammer the point home by carrying an armload of Wagyu to your table, so they can dazzle you with the marbling. \n\nI've had Japanese Wagyu in both Japan and the States, and while I've come close to weeping with joy several of those times, I didn't feel compelled to shell out $160 for an 8oz rib eye. So I went with a 20 oz bone in rib eye from Illinois, much to the chagrin of our waiter. The girlfriend got an American Wagyu sirloin. My rib eye was decent, but not great (Damn you, Illinois!). The American Wagyu, however, was awesome. \n\nThe appetizers were okay, but the side dishes were amazing. I found it annoying that they charged for sauces. They bring you an assortment of sauces for free anyway. Can't tell you about dessert, because we were so stuffed that even an extra molecule of souffl\u00e9 would've given me a hernia."

Made reservations on OpenTable and got seated at a large round table in the back when we arrived. It was like our own little area. \n\nIt's difficult not to leave impressed. The waiters and waitresses are amazing here. SO attentive. They offered a variety of complimentary breads on a tray and we were able to select as little or as many as we wanted. Get the focaccia for sure. That was the favorite among the table.\n\nI can only speak for what I personally ordered... The U.S.D.A. Prime Rib Eye Steak 12 oz ($59). It was delicious!! Cooked to perfection with a fine crust to give it that extra texture but, be warned, there's tons of fat. On the plus side, fat equals flavor! You can also choose from a list of sauces to compliment your meats. I got to try their Armagnac and Green Peppercorn as well as the Spicy Red Chimichurri ($2 each). Both tasted great with the rib eye. One was enough for 2-3 people. I had a ton left over.\n\nAll the meats are served a la carte. The table got a double order of Mac & Cheese ($19) and it was TO DIE FOR! So glad we got a double. We also shared an order of their Creamed Spinach ($12) and Wild Field Mushrooms ($22), which were just alright to me. One order for seven people left everyone with only a couple bites of each side. You can see in the attached pictures.\n\nWolfgang Puck knows how to do fine-dining well. The atmosphere is elegant and perfect for celebrations or a nice date. Just wished it didn't dent the wallet so much. I always cringe a little when I see that four $$$$ sign, but you're paying for quality I suppose!"

With some dim lighting and a upscale feel, you know you aren't on a college campus anymore. \n\nLets walk through the list:\n\nFood: The steak was AMAZING!! We ordered a side of mashed potato puree and mac & cheese with our steaks. I didn't get the Wagu even though they made it sound like a godlike cow. I went for the U.S.D.A. Nebraska Cornfed cut with an Argentinian Chimichurri. The steak was perfectly cooked and just busted with flavor in my mouth. The mashed potato was very light and smooth, while the mac & cheese was very rich. All of which served with mounds of bread and parmesean encrusted sticks\n\nService: This is what set CUT apart frmo anything I've experienced. The service was so on point I honestly thought they had to serve in the military before they could be considered for a position here. Everything they said was articulated very well, and my glass was never even HALF EMPTY - always with cold water etc. \n\nThe most impressive part was the serving of our food and at the end of our main course. They came around with 1 server per 2 people and served the entire table with our food and sides in a span of about 15 seconds - ridiculous. \n\nThen, as soon as the last person's fork hit the deck on their meal, they immediately asked if we were finished and cleaned out the whole table with multiple servers in about 5 seconds. I honestly couldn't believe it, and it was a spectacle to see. Very personal service and much appreciated - worthy of Mr. Wolfgang Puck for sure.\n\nAll in all, I would give this place more than 5 stars if I could. Shoot, I could give it 5 stars just for the service, thats how awesome the experience was. I cannot wait to come again!"

Our table of four had three different steaks and a roast chicken dish and each one was perfectly cooked and complimented the wine and sides creating flavor sensations. \n\nWhile the bar was not crowded, it was inaccessible because they let people dine at the bar, and it's just not big enough for that. This takes the fun out of having a drink at the bar before or after your dinner.  To get your drink, you have to reach over somebody who is trying to enjoy their $200 dinner.  Awkward.  \n\nService was shockingly spotty.  We sat at 8:30 (three of us had drinks from the bar) and by 9:10 our fourth still didn't have her cocktail.  I only realized how long it took because we were waiting to toast an anniversary, the occasion we were celebrating.  Forty minutes is way too long to wait when the restaurant is not shy about charging $24 for a Cosmo.\n\nI didn't like how the steak salesman (beefomillier?) interrupted our conversation to explain to us why we should buy a 6 oz piece of wagyu for $200 without so much as a \"hello.\"  But by this time I was aggravated about waiting for the cocktail, so my patience was wearing thin.   But really, he's not helping you decide what to order, he's only selling the six most expensive items which are on his cart.  At Morton's, they bring a sample of each piece of meat to show you to help you decide, and take your order right then and there. \n\nI liked how they present the food, all four dinners hitting the table at precisely the same time.  That's the level of service we expected.  I did not expect them to completely forget my side order of mushrooms.  \n\nI pulled the manager aside to discuss and I guess he agreed because he comped us $170 worth of drinks and sides.  We never saw our waiter again.  The manager brought us our check."

Easily the best steak I've ever had. \n\nI've also tried the True Japanese Wagyu. I loved this steak and thought it was amazing, but I didn't think it was better enough to justify the much higher price tag over the American Wagyu.

But unfortunately, I just like you. 3.5 stars.\n\nOne of our friends had said this is his favorite steakhouse and he eats here every time he goes to Vegas. So for our annual Thanksgiving dinner, I suggested Cut as the place for my family to dine. We all walked away saying we would not come here again.\n\nService - Top notch!\nAmbiance - This is a tiny restaurant and it's decorated nicely, but the music was classic rock and didn't really fit the feel of this place.\nThe food - Hits and misses, which i'll get to.\nPrice - About $1000 for eight people, which is pretty average for a steakhouse.\n\nBread - You are given crispy breadsticks coated in parmesan. Tasty, but very messy, the parmesan flaked off all over the place. \nYou are brought a plate of four choices of bread, you tell them which ones you want, and they are served to you by a waiter. I had the pretzel bread and the onion focaccia bread. Both were awesome. \n\nStarters - They don't have soup! I really wanted a soup, but there are none on the menu. Bummer. My friend ordered the Butter Lettuce, Avocado, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Champagne-Herb Vinaigrette Salad. I had a couple bites and it was very good. \n\nSteak - Our friend had told us to splurge and get the Japanese Wagyu Ribeye. It's $155 for 8 oz. He said it was well worth it, so BF and I split it. Japanese Wagyu is apparently not for me, it's just too buttery and literally melted in my mouth. I like steak I can chew on a little bit. I don't fault Cut, I just think it isn't my thing. My friend ordered a Petite Filet with Blue Cheese and I tried it, I liked his filet a lot and wish we had ordered that instead. Everybody else said their meat was okay.\n\nSides - Brussels Sprouts - great flavor, but too undercooked for my taste. Not served very hot. Creamed Spinach topped with Fried Eggs - Just okay, also not very hot, and I could have done without the egg. Mac & Cheese - Good flavor, but the noodles were slightly gummy and also, this wasn't hot. \n\nDessert - We didn't get any, but my friend ordered the Chocolate Souffle and it was amazing. Definitely the best part of the meal. \n\nIt wasn't terrible, but there are so many steakhouses in Vegas, many of which I think are a lot better. When you are dropping $125 a person, you want to enjoy everything you eat, and that didn't happen here."

We went with Cut because of the WP name on it, but it really was the best. We wanted at least 1 romantic splurge dinner. my life loves steak, and I wanted her to have the best. she ordered the ny sirloin and I got the rib eye. she like her steak well done..(i know), and I had mine medium. we also each ordered a glass or their syrah and a side of the mashed potatoes. The menu is steep, but I am happy to throw down money for at least what i consider the best tasting steak you can buy. I think that steak should be the most expensive meal. The portions were extremely generous..we forced ourselves to finish as their are no leftovers in vegas..no microwaves-minifridge use. I will really get a hotel with a kitchenette next time. the syrah was flavorful full bodied, great compliment for steak. we can down some wine, but the bottles were out of our price range..(80-35000 dollars!)yes i got the zeroes right. they have well aged wine here so it can be expensive. the service was excellent. Do not order an appetizer because they will bring you soo much bread and cheese and bread sticks...no appetizer needed, save belly room for your steak. My steak was charred just the right way, just the right amount of pink and chewiness. the sauce tray they brought out was also fun to try. one had like a ginger bread taste, one was dijon, and another was like horseradish..one other too. Our waiter were great. they seem to work as a team and your table is hardly every un attended. the layout of the restaurant is smart for that. they can visually make sure that every customer is eating or if they need something...great. go!\n\nps: anything, rib eye or ny sirloin good enough..do not need wagyu to be amazed"

I actually liked my friends rib eye about 4 times more than my delicious felit, and since the rib eye was so huge she didn't mind sharing with me at all! Thank Lanz! the creamed spinach was really good pretty rich but delicious.\nTo top off this beautiful meal the manager sent us a desert out on the house, that was a super 5 star thumbs up!! The infamous \"Banana Cream Pie, Fudgesicle \"Ice\", Chocolate Sauce, Valrhona Pearls \" this was slamming my taste buds around like a UFC bout was goinng down in my mouth, so many different textures and layers as you eat it and the little pearls of chocolate were rockin.....

The one where a celebrity chef opens an outpost in Sin City only to neglect it and have the quality of the product suffer as a result. As an example see Spago and Postrio or other celeb restaurants like Mesa Grill. Cut bucks the trend successfully by offering some amazing steaks and fabulous accompaniments.\n\nWhile I didn't think the cheese ball amuse bouche was anything special, the bread selection was very good. Particularly good were the pretzel bread and focaccia. The fresh burrata (with prosciutto, raisin-rhubarb compote, and arugula) wasn't something that was very memorable. The cold, stringy consistency of the cheese wasn't appetizing and the subtle flavor made the dish forgettable. The maple glazed pork belly, however, was an unbelievable mix of sweet and savory flavors. It could have benefitted from a little more pork fat to add to the texture and taste, but overall it was one of the best pork dishes i've had in a while.\n\nFor our entrees we had an 8 oz. petit cut filet and the 16 oz Nebraska corn fed rib eye. We ordered some wild field mushrooms with the filet and got a side of fingerling potatoes to share. We ordered both medium rare but the filet came out closer to medium. They were both beautifully charred, providing a flavorful crust to the steaks while keeping the centers juicy and tender. \n\nService was solid, although our waiter did disappear for a few stretches. However, the guy refilling our water was always around. It seemed like after every sip of water he was there to fill it back up to the top.\n\nThe decor is hip, trendy, and modern. Quite a contrast to most other steak houses in Las Vegas. The music was more safe and mainstream, as they played a lot of U2, the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and Cold Play.\n\nThey give locals a 20% discount off of food, so if you are Nevada resident make sure you ask about it when you order.\n\n4.5 Stars"

There was a tray of bread options as well and a wine list on a tablet. \n\nThe dining room is beautiful, I thought the pillows on the seat was nice. The only thing missing was an outdoor space with a view.\n\nEverything is a la carte here, so be prepared for that. My 28 day aged New York strip was delicious medium rare. My husband's American Wagyu Black Angus hybrid New York Strip was delightful as well. We chose creamed spinach topped with an egg  and fingerling potatoes with bacon as sides. \n\nI couldn't finish more than about a quarter of the 12oz steak, so the kitchen boxed it up to go with some pretzel rolls to go with room service-eggs the next day.  A great idea!\n\nFor dessert, we debated on going to Jean Phillipe at the Bellagio, but wound up staying for blueberry upside down cake.  It was very good, small but sharable, and the plate was dressed with \"congratulations\" in chocolate :)"

            "review": "If I had gone to the Outback or the Sizzler, I probably would have given this place 4 stars.  But at $75-$150 per steak (plus extras), I expect a significantly higher quality.  I didn't get that.  I had a steak that was ok, not prepared exactly to my liking, and quite a bit of gristle and tendons/ligaments.\n\nI like my steaks to be prepared rare.  And by rare, I do mean rare.  That is a cool to warm red center.\n\nI ordered the 16 oz. bone-in filet mignon.  It came out somewhere between medium-rare and medium.  After a couple of bites, I complained to the waiter.  Rather than offering to replace the steak with one to my liking, he explained that their unique cooking process drained all of the visible blood from the steak, and so even if the steak appeared to be overcooked, it was in fact rare.  Perhaps I was too polite, and should have called bullsh*t on the spot, but I accepted his explanation and continued to eat the overcooked steak.  It was not rare.  It did not taste rare.  And no matter what kind of magic Wolfgang Puck thinks he can work with special cooking techniques, a rare steak should look like and taste like a rare steak.\n\nWhile most of the steak was fairly tender - as you would expect a filet mignon to be - there were areas of tendon, ligament and gristle which were simply impenetrable by the standard steak knives they offered.  Since my complaints were already rebuffed once, I chose not to complain again.  I'm sure Wolfgang's mignons would have had another excuse to offer.\n\nService was good, and the side items were good.  (The wild mushrooms to top the steak were well worth the extra $12, and were perhaps the best part of the entire steak).  The wine was also good, although I prefer to be handed a more traditional looking wine list, and not an iPad where I have to navigate the various screens.\n\nThere are plenty of top notch restaurants in Las Vegas that are worth $300 for a dinner for two.  This is simply not one of them."

            "review": "I actually was a really big fan of Cut.  I have told a number of people in LA that if they are going to grab a steak in Las Vegas- this is the place.  My first experience the quality of service was amazing from the hostess to the server to the back server- it set the bar.  Their American Wagyu steaks are fantastic quality and while their sides are at a premium, they deliver- especially the mushroom and shishito peppers and mac & cheese.\n\nThis last visit on Thursday night- everything was going well until my medium rare steak came out medium well to well done.  I always cut into the middle of my steak to check- so, I immediately caught the mistake and called my server over to get another steak cooking- this is where Cut started handling it wrong.  The server immediately grabbed the steak and said he would have another one cooked, but did not acknowledge that I was right to ask for another one to be made and no apology.  I'm definitely not the guy that wants anything comped, but I'm also the guy that doesn't want to be made to feel like a horse's patoot when my $80 steak is obviously miss prepared.\n\nSo, my entire family ate their meal while I watched- the server didn't even bring me an empty plate to maybe eat some of the sides during the wait.  So, I finally got my steak after everyone at my table had finished- it was excellent.  But, to add insult- the back waiter asked in an accusing manner, if the steak was \"cooked to my liking\"- of which I replied- \"yes- you mean- did you guys cook it medium rare\".  The back server made me feel like I had been a difficult guest versus a guest that just wanted to have a nice dinner with my family and would have enjoyed to have eaten that dinner at the same time, but understands that mistakes happen- but, now was being made to feel bad- when the restaurant blew it.\n\nAs I was paying my $600+ bill, I asked my waiter why he did not apologize or maybe get a manager to apologize for messing up my first steak and worse- making me feel like I was being difficult.  I asked him if either of the two managers knew that I ate my dinner at a different time than the rest of the table.  He said that they had been informed.  It was not busy-it was 7pm on a Thurs with a dining room 25% filled- the managers were struggling to find things to do.  \n\nI wish Cut the best and think that their servers are great and their food is even better.  But, they need to change their policy of how they handle guest complaints.  Their managers and servers need to know it is OK to say the words- \"we are sorry\"! Most guests that can afford to eat at restaurants in the CUT price range are not looking for something free- but, they are almost all asking for the service and food to be done right.  Usually if a spend a few hundred dollars on a meal, I want to feel good about it- they made me feel like an ass.  Thank you CUT for the awful night."

Before the steak arrives the bring a trio of mustards and sea salt to accompany your steak.   I personally have never dipped my steak in any type of mustard but considering the quality of everything I have eaten I decide to try the mustards.  These are amazing mustards that perfectly compliment the steak I tried all three and I can say they are all excellent.  Most important \"the steak\" it is worth every penny one of the best in the United States if not the best.  If you follow me you already know I travel the country hunting for the best steaks I can find!!! This restaurant might stop my travels it is far far better then even the best steak houses.

The Steaks were perfectly cooked but was my biggest disappointment. I went with the The USDA Prime Nebraska corn fed Ribeye and sampled the American Wagyu which my colleagues had ordered. My Ribeye just lacked flavor, plain and simple. On the side we shared the Potato Tarte Tatin, Broccolini & Cavatappi Pasta, \"Mac & Cheese\", Quebec Cheddar. None was anything special, nor should have they been as the show here needed to be the Steak.

Throughout the whole meal, we didn't get the service you would expect from such a place. The staff seemed very preoccupied everywhere else. I didn't care for the portraits of stars on the wall.\n\nI ended up ordering the True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef Rib Eye 8 Oz*. It was the most expensive dish they had and I can understand why. I had it medium rare and every bite I had, I chewed thoroughly because it was just so juicy in a fatty way. I savored it. The only problem with it was that it was too juicy/fatty. My taste buds were getting overwhelmed at about 6-7 oz into the steak. I usually eat 12-16oz steaks so I wasn't full with just that steak but the last oz or so, there was a huge diminishing on return for the steak. 1 less oz and maybe knock off a few more dollars on the price and I would say it was perfectly worth it.\n\nI also had the mac & cheese and the bagna cauda.

Our friend had a seafood platter that they forgot to put in so it took awhile, and the crab had way too much mayonnaise.\nFor my entree I went with the $75 6 oz American Filet Mignon.  The filet was excellent and the sauce on the side brought out the flavors of the meat. For a side I picked the cream of spinach with the egg. The flavor of the spinach was good but just didnt go great with my steak. My bill was $150 and I didnt even have a cocktail.

Unfortunately, CUT was primarily the only option (Mina's has it but we ate there the first night).  So, the only real reason we went to CUT was because it served Wagyu.  My biggest complaint is that its a Wolfgang Puck restaurant and I haven't really had much success with those.  Nonetheless, we dove straight in to taste our first wagyu.  \n\nPros:\nThe Japanese A5 wagyu is everything it is cracked up to be.  I think I'll never look at steak the same way.  It has sortof ruined my tastes for other steak.  I got the ribeye and it was amazing.  The steak litterally melts in your mouth.  You can almost push your tongue on the roof of your mouth and a thin slice of wagyu almost melts.  It is pretty fatty but an amazing cut of meat.  Something every true meat afficionado HAS to eat if they ever want to call themselves a meat eater.  Easily a bucket list type of meal and this was a box that was crossed off for me.  Amazing steak.  They really hit it.\n\nPros: \nExcellent appetizers.\nReally one of the few steakhouses on the strip that serves true japanese wagyu.\nService is fairly good.  Reasonably attentive.  \n\n\nCons:\nChef Wolfgang does not cook in the back.  So please don't tell me that chef Wolfgang is making those mustards that they serve as an amuse bouche.  Really!  I mean, really?  Is that your amuse bouche?  Different types of mustards that I can dip my pretzel looking like bread in?  \nThe decor is more out of a 70s cookie cutter box where Dirk Diggler is gonna do some blow on the tables before they head out.  Really didn't like it as much as I wanted to.  It feels exactly like the location it is, a restaurant in the shoppes in between two great casinos.  \nThe wine by the glass selection is horrible.  Actually, the selections of wines by the bottle isn't very good either.  I ended up drinking a scotch and just dreaming of the steak I ate.  \n\nIf it wasn't for our decision to eat wagyu, I wouldn't have eaten here.  Although it did allow me to eat the steak of my dreams, the wine selection is poor, the decision to serve me mustard and tell me that Chef Wolfgang in the back decided to provide this for us really kind of put me in a different mood.  Heck, maybe he was in the back (Sunday night) but for some reason I'm thinking he wasn't.  I know Mr. Puck is from Austria, but mustards?  Maybe I'm missing something and I don't know the history of mustards and steak.\n\nIn the end, I feel like I'm a part of the assembly line machine that is the Wolfgang Puck establishment and this just happens to be a steakhouse.  I don't feel any real personality in this place nor any vision with the food.  I have to admit, the steak was excellent but I think the steak speaks for itself, its everything else that I'd rather not hear."

The next day, visiting me in the hospital, they raved about the quality of the steaks, being from overseas. I knew that next time I was in Las Vegas, I would need to go.\n\nWhat luck that several weeks later my boyfriend did extremely well in a WSOP event, and we returned to Las Vegas and made another reservation at CUT for mid June.\n\nWe were seated a booth with a leather tables and service was quick and prompt. We knew we wanted steak, but my boyfriend and I have very different tastes in wine, so the sommelier came over to help us with the (very) awkward iPad wine list. She helped us pick just the right wine that met our desires. \n\nAfter ordering our wine, we got down to business. For appetizers, we had the Kobe sashimi and the Roasted Beets with goat cheese. They actually balanced quite nicely, as we knew we had a lot of meat ahead of us. \n\nFor our main courses, I chose the American Wagyu filet, normally 6 oz, and added an extra 2 oz for extra. I love Kobe filet for it's melting butter like quality, and this cut was no exception. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and it was the quality and taste I would expect for a $130 steak. My boyfriend chose the New York Sirloin tasting that consisted of the dry aged American sirloin, American Wagyu, and NZ Wagyu. He ordered it rare and it came slightly over rare (which is acceptable, because these cuts were THICK) and they were epic. Just meaty and buttery at the same time. My steak-loving boyfriend was in heaven. \n\nFor sides, we had the mac & cheese, and spring peas with bacon. To be honest, we didn't eat much of those as we focused primarily on the steak, but both were good - also rich and bacony! \n\nAfter some excessive meat consumption, I saw a souffle float by to another table. I had to dig deep down, but I never regretted the chocolate souffle. It was rich but airy at the same time. I didn't even look at the other desserts, but it was one of the best I've had. The small little cookies and tarts were a nice little treat we had wrapped up to-go that went nicely with our coffee for breakfast the next morning.\n\nThe service was extremely attentive and water refills/bread requests came quickly and discretely. (Yes, the bread was that good too). My one disappointment is the overall atmosphere. The overly slick design and mirrors everywhere made me feel like I was in an HGTV show instead of a restaurant.  When I think steakhouse, I think a little more comfortable and a little less \"sleek.\" That said, I also deplored the amount of  people taking pictures...man people, don't use flash in a restaurant, I like to eat my food without blinding. If you're so consumed by where you are, please avoid me at all costs.\n\nOverall, I recommend CUT if you have money to splurge but you'll be sure to enjoy your meal."

This isnt Outback or Black Angus where you get more a value for your dollar-but a premium steak restaurant. \n\nEverything is a la carte where you can order for yourself, or share, including the main courses and/or sides. A great place to dine if you have the extra money to spare. Definitely a place you should experience."

We had originally made reservations for a party of 8 but later realized we didn't count a few people.  Luckily, Cut was able to accomodate us but instead of being in the dining room we were now seated out near the bar.  Service was as good as the BH location and the delicious parmesan bread sticks didn't disappoint.  After ordering a few bottles of wine for the group, the appetizers began coming out.  We ordered the bone marrow flan which didn't seem as flavorful as I remembered it being.  The beef carpaccio didn't disappoint!\n\nOrdered the prime rib eye http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cut-las-vegas?select=in0KN-y0agu9Gr8UOrwMzw#qwXO8aGWOqPqCo1jU93GWg along with a few sides for a few of us to share .... creamed spinach w/ organic egg, mac n cheese, and the sauteed mushrooms http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cut-las-vegas?select=in0KN-y0agu9Gr8UOrwMzw#hG1z92uuzB-O4bI1KQUGUA.  As with the location in BH, Cut has a tendancy to overcook their steaks so since I like my steaks rare, I order it black and blue.  Mentioned this to the other people in our group and a few listened and a few didn't."

Again...no flavor, plus the wait was so long in between appetizers and entree that I kinda lost my appetite.  The sides we had did not blow me away at all - both the mash and creamed spinach with fried organic egg were so so...I make a WAY better mash...sad to say but I bought into the hype and maybe there was too much expectation there...don't think I'll be going back."

First, a word about the non-food-related items about this restaurant. The dining room was unusually dark. For a place that seemingly prides itself on the presentation of its entr\u00e9es, I would think that there would be sufficient illumination for a diner to marvel at the appearance of each plate. This was not the case. Upping the wattage in the dining room wouldn't hurt-the restaurant can certainly afford it given the prices. Fortunately, the dark room was offset by the warm and enlightening servers. They were patient, courteous, and knowledgeable.\n\nAs to the food, on the evening I chose the Cut, I did not have a huge appetite. Therefore, I opted for the petite filet, with no soup, salad, or appetizer. I ordered the steak medium to medium-well. When it came out, I immediately saw that it was cooked to perfection! I'm not too keen on bloody steaks, but because the Cut finishes off each streak with a final 1,200 degree sear, all the juices were trapped in the meat, and did not ooze onto my plate. \n\nJust when I thought that this place couldn't get better in view of the flawless preparation of my filet, the taste was out of this world. I don't recall chewing the steak at all; instead, it dissolved in my mouth. What a wonderful texture and flavor!\n\nThe side I chose was french fries. It's hard to screw those up, and the Cut's were crisp and light.\n\nMy major complaint about this place, and the primary reason it did not get five stars, is that I was charged for each refill of Coke. Really? I can get instant refills at Wendy's if I eat in the dining room...surely the Cut doesn't need to scrimp on the lighting or refills.  Bottom line, wait til payday, eat here, and drink water. Cheers!"

Asked the waiter to take it back, he did. Then, three minutes later someone else came back and said \"did you ladies cut the steak in the middle because most often times, steak is rarer in the middle but cooked on the outer portion. But it's ok, we'll go ahead and make you a new one\". (Great...we thought)\n\nAnother three minutes go by and he returns with a new ribeye. We cut it up...it was RAW (not rare because there is a difference). The middle/ temperature of the steak was still cold. I asked the waiter and he said he will send over the manager. Manager was the same person that took our steak back the first time. When he arrived i asked if he was the manager, he replied \"no, i am just the guy in a suit\" (oh, great...we have ourselves a smart one!!) I pointed out the steak is raw and it is still cold. He said, \"that's what you ladies asked for and that's what the chef made\".\nI replied rare...NOT raw. \n\nEnd of story: he said he will \"take the steak off the bill\". \n\nThank you Cut for a wonderful dining experience, we learned a great deal about steak!"

Was very excited to try CUT by Wolfgang Puck for the 1st time. \n\nI made our reservation right when they opened at 5:30pm. We were seated right away, greeted by our servers immediately, our drinks and Parmesan covered bread sticks came out right away. We were then given 2 bite size biscuits with a strong cheese flavor to kickstart our appetites. Next came a choice of bread, I had 2 pretzel buns with their delicious butter. My husband tried the pumpernickel with raisin and the onion bread. Both were good except he preferred the onion better. My husband ordered the Austrian Oxtail Bouillon to start while I opted to eat my 2nd pretzel bun. Lol! Bread and butter is my thing! \n\nFinally our main course! The hubs ordered the Nebraska rib eye which is a hybrid of the Japanese and American wagyu. I chose the Nebraska filet mignon. Mind you these cuts are their mid priced selection of prime cuts. Ordered both medium rare. Both our steaks came out perfectly medium rare and well rested so when you cut into it, blood didn't end up covering your plate. And that crust!!! I didnt need any other seasoning or sauce cuz the crust was just perfectly lightly seasoned for my taste (I try to limit my salt intake and don't like to add any salt). The sides we ordered were creamed spinach with organic egg and the most awesome tasting Japanese mushrooms with shishito peppers. I have never had such tasty mushrooms before! Definitely a must try!\n\nLet's talk about dessert! Hubs ordered the baked Alaska which I tasted and it was good but I definitely enjoyed my chocolate souffl\u00e9! One of the better souffl\u00e9s I've had! Note, allow 15-20 minutes for the souffl\u00e9. Dinner was definitely a splurge but it was expected and it was definitely NOT a disappointment. Highly recommended!"

I expect to receive a good experience based on what I pay. My credentials have no culinary background and I cook at home probably 3-4 times per week depending on how busy my work schedule gets.\n\nThat being said, I had an amazing time a CUT.\n\nFood (5 Stars): There are a variety of steaks to choose from and the most expensive being the Wagyu beef, an amazing marbled piece of beef with fat infused in that allows the meat to melt in your mouth. I ordered the Rib-Eye wagyu beef which was a full 8-9 ounces of beef. Our group also ordered the sides that you can share: Creamed spinach, white asparagus, Japanese mushrooms, and potato fingerlings. All of these side orders were amazing. My favorite had to be the creamed spinach with the sunnyside egg on top. It complimented the steak well and I could've had more of it.\n\nHere comes the steak: a juicy succulent piece of steak charred and cooked to perfection! About half way through the steak, my friend said \"It's so rich that I feel nauseous.\" It was so good and for those of us who have not been able to experience really good food on a regular basis, it can definitely be overwhelming. I would eat this steak again and again and again. I felt really full afterwards, but not sick to my stomach. It was majorly satisfying.\n\nService (5 Stars): The waiter were great. They brought out cheese bread sticks, foccacia onion bread, and the pretzel bread that all went well with a great piece of cheese. They also joked around with us because I have this obsession with mayonaise. Overall, a friendly group that waited on us very well. They even included a little mini dessert for us which included a mini macaroon and chocolate bar. \n\nBottom Line: It's a hefty price for fine dining, but it was worth it for the food and experience!"

The vibe was relaxed and there were still a lot of diners close to 11pm when I arrived. \nI didn't want to order too much food but wanted to get a taste of what the steak hype was all about. I ordered a tuna tartar to start with, a 35 day dry aged ribeye, mac'n cheese, and a Hoagarden to wash it down with. \nThe tuna tartar was fantastic. Fresh tuna pieces, creamy avocados, and had a nice mildly spicy after kick on the palate. The mac'n cheese was the best I've tried. Definitely a wonderful comfort food with lots of creamy cheeses melted over perfectly cooked pasta (I think it included 4 different kinds of cheese). \nAs for the main, I have to say I was disappointed with the med cooked Ribeye steak. About 1/4 of the cut was fat around the outer edge. Some other slices I tried had chewy fat pieces in them and the rest of the meat was just ok but I didn't think there was anything special about my steak. I think a great steak is just that. There's no need to try to get more flavor out of if by finishing it with melted butter on top or to bring 4 different sauces out to make it more tasty. You might as well put some A1 sauce on the table if you're going that route... It defeats the whole purpose! \nOne of my favorites, Delmonico's Steakhouse only 5 walking minutes away, serves a far superior Ribeye with similar service and prices but there's no harm done in trying new places."

We were originally not even going to eat here becuase we thought it may be too much of a time crunch, but were talked in to it by the hostess on the phone, so we consented and made a reservation.  So multiple times they had it in their notes that we had to get out in time for the show.  Then night of reservation, we let the hostess know again on our way in that we were seeing the show later and also let our server know.

I've been trying to get the manager to call me back to see about getting some kind of compensation as the restaurant caused us to miss the show, and they will just not be considerate and get back to me.  I talked to him once, night of after the fiasco happened and he said he would \"assess\" the situation and get back to me, and has yet to do so, and we've tried calling him 4 times since, and no return phone call each time because he's \"too busy.\"  So my recommendation, if you want a nice meal out (like we did) before seeing the show, go elsewhere!  **If you see this CUT, it'd be nice to get a call back and get something figured out...I'd be more apt to leave you a better review!**"

I would have to say that the decor and the food lived up to all the hype.  The decor is elegant, yet hip and the swivel chairs and mirrors everywhere give it a real fun vibe.\n\nWe started with the pork belly and Louis Shrimp and Crab cocktail.  They were both light and delicate with intense flavors.  I then had the 10 oz American Waygu (kobe) Strip Steak and my wife had the 21 day aged Filet.  The meat lived up to all of our expectations.  We both had trouble finishing after eating the starters but could not waste the delicious meat.  I would have to recommend splurging for the Waygu steaks or even the Japanese Kobe.  At $80 a steak, the Waygu is definitely worth a little more after trying both.  Don't get me wrong the filet was great, but hard to compare after eating the Strip.\n\nThe reason I can't give it a 5 is because we somehow managed to get the server that must have just got promoted from the \"B\" team.  We could tell the server to our right was top notch but our guy just lacked in so many ways.  He started off by taking our drink order and seriously not bringing it back for ten minutes (place was not slammed).  The table next to us was sat after us and had drinks and bread at least 5 minutes before us.  The sommelier  ended up having to go to the bar to get them for us.  It doesn't seem to hard to pour McCallan 15 yr in a glass but I digress.   Then our guy left the meat stand they put next to the table to show the different Cut's off at our table for 15 minutes until I had to ask someone to get it out of there.  We asked for recommendations and they were lame.  This website did a better job.  My wife asked what temp he recc'd her filet be cooked at and he said \"Med\".  Where are we?  And then he recommended steak sauces with these fine pieces of meat.  \n\nFor the price of the bill, this guy should have been much, much better.  The food was amazing and we had a great night, but I will probably try a few other steakhouses in LV before I venture back."

This was the healthiest Rib Eye steak I've ever seen or eaten which was not my goal here.  I also watched as other steaks were served around the room and I never said \"wow that's what I should have ordered\".  Guess I've been spoiled by too many great places where the sizzle and smell of fantastic steaks going by tease all your senses.  \n\nThere is only one reason I can think of do Cut.  If you want to impress a client or customer this is the right kind of place - it's exotic with enough varieties of aged steak for anyone to have a \"new\" dining experience. In hindsight I should have tried one of those cuts.  Everything here is expensive - I'm sure most of Cut's customers are putting this meal on their expense reports.  You will spend anywhere from $100 to $150 per person.  \n\nJust today I read other reviews here and saw the ladies group that was insulted with the question of whether they had a \"money issue\" because they wanted to share a variety of entries.  This did not surprise me.  The all male wait staff has an aire of arrogance about them - these guys really take themselves way too seriously.  It must come down from top management because they all appear cloned.  Maybe this is a style that appeals to most high end customers.  Personally I prefer a waiter that could be more friendly and informal.  But I've seen these same bionic waiters at other expensive places so it must be considered proper.\n\nRegarding atmosphere Cut has a cold contemporary feel.  Again I suppose many other high end customers might like this motif.  Personally I'll take a place with cushy chairs and oak panels or brass rails or even red drapes, napkins and tablecloths!  The hard feel of glass and plastic doesn't put me at ease to rest comfortably and enjoy.  Probably the idea is to keep folks from lingering too long.       \n\nWith so many great steak houses in Vegas I won't ever be going back here.  I've read many of the positive CUT reviews here on Yelp and it makes me think these people have never experienced a really outstanding steak dinner.  Too bad for them!"

The sides are yummy.\nMy advice is, if you really want to enjoy your meat and the sides, don't lose your time with the starters. They anyway give you a variety of breads and cheese gougeres.\n\nThe service is great, they are on top of their games and accommodate any dish to your preferences.\n\nSo, if you are in Las Vegas and craving meat, Cut is the place"

Maybe I was expecting too much?\n\nAnyways, stopped by here during our Vegas vacation, expecting to \"treat\" ourselves.  We asked the waiter for suggestions, and he recommended the bone marrow flan and kobe sashimi to start.  I personally thought the bone marrow was TO DIE FOR.  On top of the toasted brioche = YUUUUUMMMM!!!  I would get this again.  The kobe sashimi was my husband's favorite, but for some reason, I didn't really find it appetizing.  Don't get me wrong, I am full out Chinese and can stomach lots of stuff (tripe, pork blood, etc), but the raw meat plate made me a little queasy.  Anyways...\n\nFor our entree, the waiter raved up and down about their waygu.  When in Vegas, right?  So we shelled out $80 for the rib eye.  Totally not worth it, in my opinion.  I've had better steak for half that price.  The sides were OK - creamed spinach and mac and cheese.  Very rich, didn't even come close to finishing.\n\nAll in all, don't think I'll be visiting the LA branch anytime soon.  Maaaybe would go back and try the regular steaks, cuz their waygu really wasn't worth it in my book.\n\nService was great though.  Have to give them credit.  I did like the ambiance - cool lighting, very modern.  Lots of large tables for groups."

I can say that it lived up to my expectations: if you only have one steak this year, you'll want to order it at Cut.\n\nI opted for the three-course tasting menu, which gives you the chance to sample all thee types of beef. Once you get to the hybrid or Waygu portions, you won't be able to look at the USDA choice the same way (it's sort of like flying first class). Our side was the brussels sprouts, and I started with the beet salad. Dessert was strawberry stratageliata and a chocolate fudge brownie. I'm not a huge dessert person, but these were phenomenal.\n\nAbout the only thing that detracted from our meal was when a party of six kids dressed in shorts & spray-on tans was led to a nearby table, and we noticed one of them was carrying a six-pack of Coors which was consumed during their meal. Yes, I get it that Vegas does not adhere to strict standards of etiquette, and this group probably had more money than Croesus, but it put a damper on our dining experience. For the amount of money that one pays at Cut, I would think the bar could be raised a bit higher."

The waiter did mention this upon ordering, so I thought try it. I am picky when it comes to steak and am weary of steak rubs on prime/ wagyu steaks. Sides were pretty good we had the onion rings and mac n cheese. Sides were plenty for 2-3 people. They get the extra half star for the dessert. I had the berry cobbler...delish!

And I'm not some rube who orders their steak medium well, and thinks Ruth's Chris is the end all for steaks. What we ordered:\n\nStarters: \n\n- Big Eye Tuna Tartare, Wasabi, Ginger, Togarashi Crisps, Tosa Soy: \nDelicious, but I wouldn't say a \"must order\"\n\n- Warm Asparagus, Poached Organic Egg, Warm Bacon Vinaigrette:\nSounds simple, right? Well, a guy comes out, breaks the poached eggs for you and pours the warm bacon vinaigrette right there in front of you, so that it hits the asparagus just seconds before it combines and hits your mouth. It was delicious and I would recommend!\n\nEntrees:\n\n- American Wagyu Beef Rib Eye Steak \n\n- True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef Rib Eye \n\nMy boss and I decided to try the American Wagyu Rib Eye and the Japanese Wagyu Rib Eye, cut them in half, and share, so that we could compare the two. As a person who loves rich food, I must say that the Japanese Wagyu was actually a bit too fatty for me. \nOur server had went over the differences of the meats before we ordered, and had indeed told us that the Japanese Wagyu was fatty, even bringing out various cuts of the raw steaks, showing us how the fat runs through this type of meat, so we weren't unprepared for it. \nMy American Wagyu rib eye was absolute PERFECTION. I ordered it rare plus, as did my boss with his Japanese cut. It was rich and perfectly fatty, in my opinion. The Japanese cut, being more of a delicacy and more expensive, made sense to me, it just wasn't my preference. I have a friend who LOVES to eat the pure fat pieces that hang on the sides of meat.  I could see him totally loving the Japanese Wagyu.\n\nSides:\n\n-Mac & Cheese:\nPhenomenal. I would believe that night it had truffle in it, and it was perfection. Definitely an indulgence that you must try\n\n- Curry Spiced Cauliflower:\nReally good, but I don't think the flavor profiles went well with everything else we ordered. \n\nOur server was an absolute delight. I can't remember his name, but I think he said that he was originally from Southern California. He looked about 30 with short brown hair and really knew what  he was talking about. If he or anyone from the restaurant is reading this, thank you. He made our experience wonderful. He had a great personality. \n\nThe ambiance in the restaurant is very lovely. Sitting down, I immediately felt like I was in a high class establishment and would be in for a treat. Overall, this was a heavenly experience that I hope I can take part in again someday!"

Once seated we were given menus and asked for our drinks.\n\nThe decor is very nice and simple, beautiful tables and SWIVEL chairs!!! That's probably because after you're done eating, you just wanna turn to you're side and get up. While waiting for our waiter, we were offered a variety of things to munch on.\n\n1. Parmesean bread sticks- great crisp texture and nice cheesy taste.\n2. Some kind of deep fried cheese ball- Also tasted good but we let them sit for a while so they were a little cold.\n\nWe got our water glasses filled and were offered the wine list. We picked out a 2000 Bordeaux and proceeded to order our meal.\n\nWe decided on 2 appetizers and two sides. The appetizers were:\n\nKobe Steak Sashimi- WOW, this was GREAT. Possibly the most tender and flavorful piece of beef i have EVER eaten. The Radish adds a great texture and went very well with the spicy saucy stuff at the bottom.\n\nBig Eye Tuna Tartare, Wasabi Aioli, Ginger, Togarashi Crisps, Tosa Soy- This was good, the Aioli was excellent and the Togarashi chips were wonderful. Overall a very successful appetizer.\n\nOnce the appetizers were finished, the steaks came out. I go tthe bone in rib eye prepared rare. Also with my steak, I got the bone marrow!! I will tell you that it was one of the best cuts of meat I've ever eaten. It was cooked perfectly and had a great crust on it. The meat was very tender and well seasoned. The bone marrow on top was a wonderful addition to my steak. Eaten alone it was very fatty and rich, but eat it with a bite of the steak and it was heavenly. Also, went very well with the Bordeaux.\n\nOnce the steaks were set down, our sides came out. We opted for:\n\nCreamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg- BEST spinach I have EVER eaten in my LIFE. It was creamy with bits of egg white and egg yolk in it. They cook the egg over easy and break/mix the egg into the spinach table side! YUMMMMY!\n\nSoft Polenta with Parmesan- This was good but the spinach was so damn good, I didn't really pay much attention to it :D I just know it was good!\n\nVery nice place to eat if you like steak! I'll probably be back, maybe to the one in LA."

My current favorite is Morton's due to their Cajun ribeye. Now let's get to this review...\n\nCUT has amazing ambience. We were seated at a booth where the waitress kindly pulled out the table so that we could sit with ease. Throughout the whole dining experience we had a very attentive waiter who made sure we never went thirsty or needed anything.\n\nI thought it was interesting that they had a woman who made special cocktails at your table. We didn't have any as the drink I ordered could only be ordered from the bar. I had a Sazarazz which was very good but not for the faint at heart.\n\nWe had the pork belly appetizer and it was good, even though I typically don't opt for it (boyfriend's selection). A man came around with a bread platter where you could select which bread you wanted. I personally loved that because not everyone likes the same bread. The bread was tasty and we had no complaints.\n\nAs far as the meal, I ordered the ages 12 oz Ribeye medium rare and my boyfriend got an aged NY strip medium rare. The waiter was awesome and informed my boyfriend on which NY strip was better as far as flavor when he asked. Sides included macaroni and cheese and fingerling potatoes.\n\nI felt that that we both enjoyed the meal but it wasn't necessarily the \"best steak we ever had\". When served, the steak came with a platter of various toppings which included a custom steak sauce, sea salt, and another sauce I cannot recall. The steaks were cooked perfectly and we had zero complaints. The macaroni was very good but the fingerling potatoes were just okay. I personally don't care for fingerling potatoes but I let my boyfriend order them. Sadly he wasn't the biggest fan either.\n\nConcluding the meal we were offered a small platter of desserts. We sampled them all and they were tasty. We didn't go for a full dessert because  we were way too full.\n\nOverall I felt that the service was amazing. There was never a time were we wondered where staff were or needed more of a particular item. Also, the bartender who makes drinks at your table was kind enough to take pictures for us. I really appreciated that she took a few to ensure we like them."

We were helped by three servers.  Our main server took our order and educated us on the different kinds of meat.  Another server dished out little nibbleys throughout the meal.  And then the third server brought our meals out and even dished out our sides onto our plates.  Nothing but the best when it comes to service.  It would only make sense since you are dropping bucco bucks.  \n\nNow onto the MEAT.  The main waiter makes a presentation on the different cuts of meat as well as describes the texture of said meats.  I ordered the 14oz Nebraska corn fed NY strip steak.  I made it to order this piece in particular because my fiance is a Nebraska boy.  As for him, he ordered the 10oz American Wagyu.  And to company our steaks we ordered yukon gold potato puree.  The steaks were unbelievable to the point where we pretty much forgot about the potato puree.  It was that serious!  If you are looking for impeccable service and food, CUT is your place."

Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious.  I especially enjoyed my steak and martini.  However, the service was atrocious.  We waited a good hour before our dinner came out after ordering it.  We had ordered drinks during this hour (about 10 minutes before our steak came) and the drinks arrived 20 minutes AFTER our food came out.  So we had all this delicious food with no drinks available.  My cousin prefers a glass of wine with his meal and I prefer a martini.  We were all nearly done our meal by the time the drinks came out.  That ruined the dinner for me alone.  Next time, Craftsteak it is!"

Of course no tables available, but we were lucky as there was a love seat table in the bar area that was open.  So my date and I were seated there.  We ordered very simply... no wine, no alcohol, just an appetizer of pork belly, a side of mushroom/peppers, and a bone-in, 39-ounce American Wagyu rib-eye for 2.  Pork belly was good, mushroom/peppers were beyond excellent!.  The rib-eye was utterly fantastic!  We got it medium rare and it's a LOT of meat, but it's like butter.. just melts in your mouth...  The only downside of getting it medium rare for that much meat is that it's so much meat you gotta eat it quick or else the middle pieces get a bit cold.  Perhaps eat the middle pieces first and eat the outside pieces last.  Anyway, it was an awesome relaxing dinner... we were right by the entrance so we could enjoy ourselves, have good conversation, enjoy the food, people watch, be the envy of all the carnivores walking by... etc.  Service was great... they gave us some free chocolate snacks at the end.  It was expensive, but because we didn't order any alcohol, it was only $280 total.  Best date ever!"

The signature cocktails are incredible. I've been here twice and both times the food was fantastic. They bring cuts of the different types of raw meat to your table to show you the different quality of the meat. I'm sure it has been said before but this is one of the best dining experiences I have had.\nThe meal started with an order of lovely cocktails. During the meal, we were brought out a variety of freshly cooked bread, and everything that touched our lips was to die for. The steaks were both cooked to absolute perfection and the seasoning was perfect. The mac and cheese was the best we had ever had. Overall, a fantastic meal of high quality and taste. Highly recommend."

We got to the restaurant at 9:20 after a CRAZY walk down the strip past some sort of motorcycle mayhem and rowdy New Years Eve crowds and all I wanted was to sit down and sip a cocktail. The host told us that because we were late we would have to wait an additional 20 minutes to be seated which I found interesting because once we did sit down, there were plenty of vacant tables around us. Ooh well... \n\nThe rundown: Started with a delicious glass of house red wine while drooling over the menu. To drink, we went with a bottle of champagne to enjoy throughout the evening (sadly I forget the name but it was wonderful!). We started with the tuna tar tar and each had a steak selected by my boyfriend with the servers recommendation. For our sides we went with the creamed spinach and macaroni and cheese. The creamed spinach was not my favorite. I felt like serving it with a soft egg was a little over the top and did nothing for the flavor. The macaroni was not something we would typically indulge in (especially after champagne, tuna, etc...) but came so highly recommended by the server that we couldn't pass it up. In a word-AMAZING! We were both way too full for dessert but managed to finish our champagne after the stroke of midnight. \n\nFinal thought: \nI atually had higher expectations...\nGreat service, delicious bread selection, pricy, better steaks at Maestros \n\nThank you for a great night CUT \nHappy New Year"

We were checking our bill and upon closer inspection, they printed out the $8 to look like a $0. We asked the server about it, he didn't even need to check the bill and knew what was going on and proceeded to fix it for us. Shady, I wonder how many people were jibbed from this.\n\nOtherwise, the American Kobe style rib eye was the best piece of steak I have ever had. Having already had A5 (highest rated cut) kobe/wagyu beef in japan and Hong Kong numerous times, I was skeptical that any other beef would excite me, however the American Kobe had the best of both worlds. The marbling and fat of a Japanese Kobe beef and the beefy robust taste of a Angus beef. I would choose the American Kobe Style rib eye over Japanese Kobe/wagyu steak.\n\nDon't bother with the tasting of Sirloin, I ordered that and ended up enjoying my girlfriends American Kobe rib eye instead.\n\nThe bone marrow flan and desert were pretty good as well.\n\nIf it weren't for the shady billing I would definitely give this place a 5-stars."

Also got the side of bone marrow and mushrooms that was good too but I wouldn't get the bone marrow side again. My favorite was the bone marrow flan appetizer.

            "review": "SOOOO DISAPPOINTED!!! This may be in part because I was expecting this to be amazing so it really fell flat. \n\nThe decor was nice. The service was...interesting--as we had a server in training working alongside our server. Our actual server was great but our trainee completely butchered our meat (and not in a good way). While struggling to sloppily cut our steaks from the bone and leaving half of it still on the bone, he kept inappropriately joking about the meat and bone in an attempt to distract from his lack of skill. Wtf. After he \"presented\" the meat on the plate in what should have been an appealing display, it looked like someone had chewed and spit the meat onto our plates. I was completely put off but starving and wanted to get back to nurse my daughter.\n\nBetween 4 of us we had ordered two of the American wagyu porterhouse steaks (34 oz each) along with the creamed spinach (bland and not very creamy) and French fries (also bland and mushy). They brought breadsticks and a nice selection of breads. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. I didn't have any as I'm gluten intolerant but after inquiring I discovered they have a gluten free sliced bread which was brought out to me 5-10 minutes afterwards. After that came the cheddar biscuit which everyone said was like a bite of heaven. Probably the highlight of the meal. \n\nWhen our steaks came out one was significantly smaller and thinner, which is the one my fianc\u00e9 and I shared. The instant I saw it I suspected we inadvertently had been served the prime porterhouse instead of the wagyu porterhouse but I put the doubt out of my mind since a restaurant of this caliber should not make such a mistake. Boy was I wrong! The meat was not melt in your mouth tender as wagyu should be. In fact, it was really tough, tendonous, not evenly marbled with the fat, and overdone. The servers did not come back for a long time so we just continued eating as we were starving and had to get back to the kids. But when my cousin and I swapped bites near the end of the meal so I could determine if they were the same meat quality I discovered it was most definitely not!!! At that point we had nearly finished everything with no follow up by the servers so I felt it was too late. In hindsight I should have spoken up because when you're paying $200 for a steak you should get what you're paying for.\n\nMaybe I'm spoiled because I've eaten prime, Kobe, and wagyu steaks in NYC, Chicago, Vegas, LA and Dallas...this didn't even come close to measuring up to what I've had as far as the quality of meat, flavor, service and entire experience. It's the most disappointing meal I've had in the past year and a half and that's saying a lot because we eat at a variety of places including hole in the wall and mom & pop establishments. I would never return and never recommend anyone looking for a great steak in Vegas to come here. Choose more wisely than we did and go to any of the other superior steakhouses on the strip."

We had to wait a bit for our table which we didn't mind, and we were seated at the best one in the house.\n\nThe GOOD:\n- Service seemed pretty on point the entire night, both from our server to the bread lady to the guys filling the water cups.  Server was very knowledgeable about wines & food.\n- Bread was RIDICULOUSLY good.  I highly recommend the pretzel bread & foccacia\n- Decor, presentation, ambiance was nice - feels like a fancy restaurant (but with upbeat music & less stuffy)\n- Steak itself was delicious - not the best I've ever had (I am partial to Morton's), but it was cooked correctly and very flavorful.  I tried both the American Wagyu (tasted like a cross between bacon & steak), and the traditional filet mignon.  I liked the filet better.\n- Sides - 2/3 were very good - I'd recommend both the mac and cheese and fingerling potatoes roasted with bacon and onions.  I'd skip the squash.\n\nThe BAD:\n- This place is ridiculously overpriced, even for Vegas.  Some of the sides we ordered here (which one side could probably feed 2 people) were about $20 bucks, and our steaks were in the  mid $70s.  I've definitely spent more on dinner before and have felt great about the food and service I received - I did not have that same feeling this time.\n- They give you an ipad to order drinks and wine.  While we originally thought it was cool, it ended up being totally cumbersome and dissuaded us from ordering cocktails (we did have lovely wine though).\n- Upselling - When the waiter brought over the meats to show us, he only brought over the American Wagyu & Japanese Wagyu beefs - e.g., the most expensive steaks on the menu only.  I felt like this was a little obnoxious - if you're doing a steak demonstration you should be demonstrating all cuts of meat regardless.  As As I don't even like Wagyu beef I was a little bit put off by this.\n\nThe UGLY:\n- So after all was said and done, for two apps, a bottle of wine, 4 steaks and 3 sides, the bill came out to about $430 dollars.\n\nThe REALLY UGLY:\n- WHEN THE WAITER BROUGHT OUR CHECK OVER, HE TOLD US TO \"make sure you fill out each of the three lines I wrote x's on\" - which would be the tip, total, and signature.  I thought this was the single most obnoxious thing I had ever experienced after dropping over $400 bucks on a meal.  I ultimately tipped the waiter exactly 20%, would have tipped him closer to 25-30% if he hasn't felt the need to point the fact I needed to tip out to me, and in retrospect I feel like I should have been closer to 15%.  As a person who has worked in the industry and frequents different bars and restaurants, I'd immediately fire someone who suggested this to a patron.\n\n--------\n\nTL;DR - I'd pick another steakhouse - somewhere where you get a bit more value for what you're spending."

But there were a few shortcomings that, taking into account the expensive prices charged for every item ordered, should not have occurred.  An Alaskan King Crab & Carolina Shrimp \"Louis\" was very tasty until I bit into a stray piece of cartilage embedded in the app.  The cocktail sauce was largely composed of tomato-tinged horseradish, which added an interesting spicy element to this dish. \n\nA 6-oz. medium-rare Snake River Farms Idaho American Wagyu Filet Mignon with stellar Bearnaise Sauce and a superior Red Wine Bordelaise Sauce was indeed tender and very good, but not the best steak I have ever tasted.  For the price it should have been!  Two pounds of Whole Roasted and somewhat sweet Stonington Maine Lobster with Black Truffle Sabayon and Lemon Butter Sauce split between us nicely rounded out our entrees.  But complimentary rolls unfortunately arrived at our table ice cold.  \n\nFor sides, assorted Wild Field Mushrooms and Hand Cut French Fries with Herbs were nicely prepared, and Cavatappi Pasta Mac & Cheese with Quebec Cheddar was smooth and cheesy.  But rather thin cooked Asparagus spears with Brown Butter were on the bitter side.  For good measure, 2 salts and 2 mustards, which were fun to experiment with, were brought to the table.  I liked the Black Wine Mustard the best.\n\nFor dessert a shared generously-sized Valrhona Chocolate Souffle with Creme Fraiche and Grandula Ice Cream was a good finish, but the souffle tasted somewhat bitter rather than sweet.  A complimentary but unnecessary melty Chocolate Chip Cookie was excellent.\n\nService by our waiter and several assistants was attentive and exemplary, and Diane's aversion to pepper and char was graciously accommodated.  Iced Teas were regularly replenished without request, and for 3 minutes I watched a server at an adjoining table painstakingly debone and prepare an entree of Dover Sole for another guest.  Seating at a table for four in a contemporary setting was comfortable and spacious enough to support the several dishes that often follow my wake when first sampling fine dining in a high-end restaurant.  \n\n4-12 stars overall on this initial foray to Cut along The Venetian's Restaurant Row."

LOL\n\nComplimentary bread was delicious. They had focaccia, pretzel, pumpernickel, and sourdough. The pretzel was my favorite.\n\nBone marrow flan - So decadent, yet light at the same time. Wish we got more toasted brioche for it, though. (It's OK because the waiter came back and gave more bread and it worked just fine.)\nAsparagus, poached egg, and bacon vinaigrette - Simple and yummy. I would get it again.\n\nBFF and I split a bone-in ribeye. It was OK. We've had better.\nFriend had the petite filet mignon. She finished it, so I'm assuming it was good?\n\nFor sides, we got:\nWild mushrooms with shishito peppers - Too sweet and not enough savory.\nCreamed spinach - It was OK. I've had better.\nFingerling potatoes - This was really yummy! My favorite of the sides.\n\nThe food was good overall, but we ordered too much/got full off the bread and apps, so we only had a few bites of the steak and sides. We asked to pack up the leftovers but they only came back with the steak. When we asked where our sides were, they said they threw them out. WTH? Why? We honestly had like a few bites of each. They threw away like $50 worth of food. :( The waiter offered us coffee after and we thought it was his way of apologizing for throwing away our food... until we saw the bill. He charged us for that, too.\n\nThe food was good. But I think I'll get my steak somewhere else."

Simply a FAR cry from $520 for two people...\n\nBOTTOM LINE : im sure people have 5 star experiences here, but for the price it needs to be a guarantee- so be aware u are rolling the dice coming here. \n\nI was absolutely ready to spend the money, enjoy the service and food of a $500 meal--I sat down 'all in'...and by a $250 steakhouse for two people standard, I would give it 2-3 stars. Sides Are Tiny!!!! And we are NOT pigs. \n\nServer was nice, but pretentious and took a looong time to get to the table, drinks were an eternity between ordering, and rushed thru the beef selection 'tutorial.'  He had too many tables for what you're paying. And for $500, there Should not be any by the bathroom seats. But there are. Other types of servers step in, but it's obvious they are there just for their little piece, not if u actually need something. \n\nAppetizers were a BIG disappointment, as were the sides, fingerling potatoes--super dry. My husband liked the spinach a lot. \n\nI got the hybrid NY strip--a good steak by grocery store steak standards. But too chewy and tough in the end for what I expected. Banana cream dessert was 5 stars which is the only reason it gets 2 instead of 1 stars. In short, they take big advantage of the tourists and Wolfgang name."

However after trying a few other steakhouses in Vegas (such as Gordon Ramsay), its definitely not the best.  \n\nI won't go into detail about all the sides (although the Mac and Cheese they have is AMAZING).  The issue I had was with the steak itself.  When I go to a steak house and order a steak, I am expecting to pay for a good piece of quality beef.  I want to \"taste\" the flavors of the meat.  Unfortunately, some restaurants feel the need to season (and possibly over-season) the meat.  This is where CUT falls short.  To me, they over-seasoned a great piece of beef so that all I could taste was the seasonings.  The actual meat flavor was eliminated.  It is a travesty to do this.  \n\nOverall, the restaurant is great.  Service was awesome.  Sides were good.  Atmosphere is good.  The steaks however left a lot to be desired.  \n\nBottom line:  If you are going for the steak, there are better steakhouses available."

The BEST part was the dessert! Since I mentioned it was the bf's bday, CUT comped us a dessert, a baked alaska and wrote \"Happy Birthday\" in chocolate on the plate. Baked alaska is officially my new favorite dessert!! I'm still dreaming about eating it!!\n\nI def recommend going to CUT for a special occasion since it is a bit pricey.

Loved the wine/cocktail list via Ipad.  \nAmbience:  Great vibe.  Music was not terribly loud.  Nice contemporary feel to the restaurant\nService:  Great!  This was expected and delivered.  Always someone waiting on you.  The food flowed nicely through the courses.  The only delay came at the end when we were waiting for our bill\nDrinks:  They have a great selection of wines.  But what was more impressive was their scotch selection.  If you are a scotch fan, you will be truly impressed.  We tried a few of the recommended cocktail (one was a scotch cocktail and really good) and was not disappointed.\nFood:  Excellent!  Started off with the Bone Marrow Flan and Tuna Tartare.  Very tasted.  I love their bread selections.  Ended up splitting the Nebraska corn fed rib eye and the American Wagyu Porterhouse for 2 (there was 3 of us in all).  The flavors were amazing.  You need to have them cook it at least Medium (we had it Medium-rare plus) to truly enjoy the flavor.  For the sides, we had the mushrooms, brussel sprouts, and Mac n' Cheese.  We were very satisfied with the meal.  Dessert was great as well.  We had the banana cream pie.\n\nAll in all, Cut did not disappoint.  The ribeye was one of the best steaks that I have had.

The dimly lit restaurant itself did not appear to be that large however it was comfortable. The prices were quite a shock, but we dove into the menu anyway. I started with a butter lettuce salad with cherry tomatoes, large chunks of bleu cheese, avocado, basil, chives and a sweet yet tart vinigarette I can't quite pinpoint an exact mixture of. The salad was bliss! I'd have to say it was my favorite part of the meal. For the main course, I had a medium rare big eye tuna steak (I don't eat much red meat). It was done very nicely and melted in my mouth. My associates enjoyed steaks. The exact cuts they had escape me, however I did try a bite and it was delicious. The vegetable dishes were also beyond amazing! We had the onion rings, squash & corn. I couldn't get enough of the corn. Perfectly seasoned in a way I had never experienced! For desert, we shared the chocolate souffl\u00e9 and a banana cream creme brul\u00e9. I have to say I preferred the souffl\u00e9, but both were exceptionally fantastic! Finally, the service was perfect. My water glass was never empty. Our server paid close attention to our needs. Cut is fine dining at it's absolute best! A highly recommended experience!"

Both seemed overly salty and far too crusty (burnt?) for our liking.  In addition to the steaks, we ordered creamed spinach and mac n cheese for our sides.  The mac n cheese was okay, but the creamed spinach was... yakk (yakk = disgusting).  I just couldn't eat it.  It comes prepared with a raw egg that cooks from the heat of the spinach and I could have done without the egg.  Actually, I could have done without the creamed spinach entirely.  \n\nWith tip, the bill came to a whopping $200+, and I walked away feeling utterly ripped off.

My bf had already been there a few months prior but we decided to check it out again anyway. My bf and I got there early and grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for our other 2 friends. Nifty way of ordering drinks...via ipad app. Very smooth and sleek. We were seated at a beautiful center table. Loved the decor, chairs and tables. Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. He showed us the cuts of steaks and went through the menu with us. A nice selection of warm breads were offered. I personally loved the house pretzel bread. In terms of the steak, I decided on the rib eye while my bf tried the rib eye wagyu. Both were excellent. My friends got the table side porterhouse which was impressively cut in front of them. I didn't really care for their technique of cooking the meat in butter so that it would be crisp on the outside. Just because it made my meat taste like it was burnt. I really enjoyed my bf's cut of meat. It tasted like my rib eye but softer. For dessert we all shared the banana cream pie (a rendition of it). They had also acknowledged my anniversary with my bf and kindly gave us an extra dessert at the end of the meal. A nice touch! Total bill came out to about $500 (yikes) which included 2 appetizers, 4 steaks, a dessert and probably 8 drinks.\n\nI enjoyed the service, the wine/cocktail selection, the ambiance and most importantly the food!

Hub's and i had spent the last week hiking our butts off in some of the nearby national parks and wanted to treat ourselves to a delicious steak dinner and since we'd been meaning to try Cut for a number of months now and could never manage to get a reservation we decided it was time to pre-plan and give it a go. The food was mouthwatering - a choice of warm breads to start (my favorite was the pretzel bread), the appetizer, steak tartare, served with a quail egg and mustard, was so amazing we fought over who got the last bite! Our entrees, fillet mignon's for the both of us, were cooked to perfection and accompanied by creamy wild mushrooms and fingerling potatoes with large chunks of smokey bacon  - to die for!! \n\nService was disappointing and at times rude and dismissive, bordering on offensive. Upon arrival (we had a reservation) the hostess ignored us, we were sat in the corner of the restaurant right next to the kitchen even though the restaurant had many empty tables and upon asking to be moved were told they could not accommodate us, our waiter was dismissive and inattentive and even forgot our order and had to return to us and ask us to repeat it, our sides were brought out quite a while before our steaks and were almost cold by the time our steaks arrived and to top it all off the table next to us was fawned over and provided very attentive service by the same server. Now, I don't expect perfect service everywhere I go but when your paying $400 for a dinner you expect the service to be at a certain level - after all, in restaurants such as this, your not just paying for the food, your paying for an experience. \n\nThere are too many amazing steakhouses in Las Vegas to deal with bad service and we will be taking our business elsewhere in future."

I have been here about 2 years ago and sat at the bar and remember the service and food was great.  Saturday March 21st after a rough day at the sports books, I recommeded this place to two friends of mine as our annual steakhouse. Had a drink at the bar prior to our table being ready. This was a sign.  Barely acknowledged, and 2 of the 3 drinks were incorrect. 10 minutes after initial order we had drinks in hand. Sat at our table about 10:30pm. The gentleman that proceeded take our water and wine order was great and we had our wine our without a hitch. Waitress came by a few minutes later to tell us about the Wagyu. Personal preference is Wagyu is better cut and cooked sliced or cubed so I proceeded to order the Bone-in Ribeye. My friends ordered the Sirloin and Strip I believe. We ordered 3 sides to split. Here is where it goes downhill fast. Gentleman that initially helped us comes by 10 minutes after we ordered to tell us they are out of the Mac and Cheese. Ok, dissapointing and curious why the waitress didnt tell us and it took 10 minutes but still anxious for some good steaks coming. Almost done with the wine, we noticed its been 40 minutes we noticed the waitress has not come back by the table. The initial gentleman came by once to top off our wine. So I called him over again and asked about our food. He goes to check on it comes back and says he told the waitress and manager of our wait. I would expect either the waitress or manager to come by so I ask him to have them come by our table to express our concern.  The waitress comes by and she says that she placed the order in the kitchen at 10:57, its now 11:40pm. She says that the food will be out in about 8-10 minutes.  Ok, someone slipped up or they are backed up, happens. But the restaurant is only about half full for the last 30 minutes. OK consensus now is that the service is not on par with a good Steakhouse but a simple diner. Interesting enought the steaks come out about 3 minutes later, the apps a full minute afterwards. Still optimistic I cut into my steak and WOW! Overcooked, dry and room temperature. Two bites and I asked the gentleman helper to get the manager asap. (Never saw the waitress again). Of the other two steaks one was average at best and the other was very below average. My friends are starving and decided to eat their steak, I could not eat more than two bites. Here is the most frustrating part. Generally good restaurant and pricey, so figure this was a total fluke and the manager would be completely empathetic. NO! He came over and just the expression is that he was annoyed that he was present. His initial comment was  \"how can I help you\". I told him the whole story and his response was \"I will take that into consideration for next time, what would you like me to do know?\". I could not belive the smug attitude and told him to please take away my steak. He did no remorse, of course they didnt charge me for my steak but he didnt even assure me that he would not (I wanted to see if they would try so didnt say anything). He simply proceeded to leave.  I didnt want anything more, but expected from this type of establishment to be offered a free coffee!?! Well again the gentleman helper came by 10 minutes later when we were all done and offered me an espresso. My feeling is this place is overrated, turn and burn.  Use their name and location to get people in and dont care if you come back. The service is on par with a diner at best, not a Steahkouse. By the way all the sides (fries, cream spinach, onion rings) were terrible as well. -Ken"

What steakhouse doesn't have America's #1 steak sauce? When you are paying $150 for a steak you should be able to chose the steak sauce you want with it, instead of being looked at like your crazy for wanting to put a little A1 on their so called high end piece of meat. \n\nThen they have a bunch of creepy male waiters wearing all black and when they are serving you, they lean into your personal space. It makes dining a horrible experience. \n\nFor a high end restaurant in a high end hotel on the strip in Las Vegas you would think they would be able to hire a few female waitress so that people don't feel like they are being served by some creepy club security guards! \n\nAs for the rest of the food it was mediocre and definitely not worth $1000 for a party of 4!!\n\nI am only comparing this place to the other high end steakhouses I go to. And this will be one that I will not be returning to."

If you plan on coming here, keep your expectations in check and have in the back of your mind that you're paying an additional 25% for the Las Vegas dining experience; if you do that, you'll be happy.\n\nOnto the highlights of our meal -- the service. My golly the service was spot-on. I felt like royalty dining with the Duchess of Cambridge. When you leave your chair and leave the napkin on the seat, they come by, remove and give you a fresh new one -- it's the attention to detail that makes the service amazing. \n\nThe complimentary bread was fancy bread that was served table-side with a server placing each bread on your plate ever so gently. However, it was not warm bread -- stone cold bread. I was confused. Most high end restaurants serve bread warm because it just tastes so much better warm. \n\nOnto the reason we came: the steaks. 4 of us came here, we ordered the:\n1. [2x] American Waygu Ribeye 9oz ($88 each): This should have been the star of the show but it was not. Before ordering your steaks, the waiter actually brings raw steaks wrapped neatly and explains the different cuts of waygu and basically sells you on the more expensive cut. We ordered it. Call me a steak-snob, but for waygu, I was expecting melt-in-your-mouth bites -- it was more tough than I expected. It was only marginally better than the 35 dry aged ribeye, and certainly not $30+ better. \n\n2. [1x] USDA PRIME, Nebraska Corn Fed, Dry Aged 35 Days Ribeye 12oz ($63): This was a solid cooked ribeye. No frills, no overselling. Delicious ribeye.\n\n3. [1x] Filet Mignon: This was surprisingly the star of the show. It was the melt-in-your-mouth experience I was expecting (and for a fraction of the waygu price). \n\nPROTIP (SERIOUSLY PROTIP): If you have a reservation, call ahead, ask to speak to a manager and ask him/her that you want to do \"the sampling\" of the waygu. If you're convincing enough, they will make a dish with a 2 oz cut of the regular dry-aged ribeye, 2 oz cut of the American waygu ribeye, and 2 oz of the Japanese waygu ribeye. (At least 2 people in your party have to order this) Had I known this going in, I would've done this so you can taste the differences in steaks.\n\nPros: Service is impeccable\nCons: Oversold on the waygu (good steak, but not \"out-of-this-world\" great)"

It was a fabulous night with delicious food. \nFour (out of six) of us got the wagyu beef. I got the petit filet and still couldn't finish it with all of the sides we ordered. The steak had a wonderful crispy outside. Slicing the meat was a smooth as slicing butter. Every bite was decadent. I did enjoy trying the mustards with the beef.\nWe got the bacon potatoes as a side -- again so very rich. The only thing I wasn't wowed by was the creamed spinach...I've had better. Another friend had ordered the mac and cheese. I had a bite, but was so full that I felt I couldn't totally enjoy it...I do recall it was flavorful.\nThe service and presentation was top notch. \nI would highly recommend The Cut to anyone...it's pricey, but totally worth it. Best steak I have ever eaten!"

I tasted the true deal KOBE off of my husbands plate and it was way to rich for my blood. He agreed that it was excellent but he also preferred the Snake River...thanks Thomas Keller for making us dream of Snake River for a year.

We asked for the sommelier to help us pair wines with our food. She was incredibly helpful and mindful of our requests and tastes. We'd see her a couple times before the night was over; she poured our bottle and also later on when we asked for her help again with dessert wines.\n\nThe food was amazing. Our first course was the Tuna \"Toro\" Tartare with spicy crisps. It seemed somewhat of a waste to take delicious toro, the most sumptuous and fattiest part of tuna, and slicing it into little bits rather than eat it 'pure' with a tinge of soy sauce and wasabi. But it was worth it! \n\nAs for the steaks, we elected to try the tasting plate with three different types of the same cut. The fats melted perfectly and they all had great flavor, distinctive from each other.\n\nThe sides, potato puree and honeyed root vegatables, were phenomenal.\n\nFor dessert, my date and I came to an impasse. A delicious impasse. He got the chocolate souffle and I had the banana cream pie. The pie tasted like air, incredibly yummy tasting air. It was so light! \n\nAll in all, the experience at Cut was really great. What made it was the staff. Throughout the night, we had a few different people other than our server check in with us. We had the opportunity to chat with them too. I always appreciate that they take the time to do that."

Coming from West Hollywood we have a number of great steakhouses close to home but I had never been to one of Wolf Gang's restaurants and was really excited to see what the fuss was about. From the minute we walked through the door I knew why everyone raved about this place. The staff was friendly and welcoming (which was refreshing compared to the usual pretentious attitudes you often get here in LA.) We were seated in the bar and treat to comp. rosemary popcorn and marinated olives whiles we waited for our table, which was ready at the exact time of our reservation. \n\n\nOur waiter was knowable and took his time explaining the menu. He offered helpful suggestions and was prompt and attentive throughout the entire meal. We started with the Butter Lettuce salad and Maple Glazed Pork Belly. They were both excellent choices. The pork belly was sweet and melted in your month.  For our Entree we decided to share the Tasting of New York Sirloin (American Wagyu, USDA prime aged & 100% Japanese Wagyu ) The Japanese Wagye was delicious but VERY VERY rich. I'm happy I was able to try this but don't think I could eat an entire steak. The USDA prime aged was my personal favorite. The steak was served with three sauces. These weren't necessary because all the steaks were flavorful and perfectly seasoned. \n\nFor our sides we got field mushrooms with shishito peppers and the Mac &Cheese. The Mac & Cheese was definitely on the heavy side but I was delicious and so cheesy! I could eat the shishito peppers every day. \n\nOf course, by the end of the meal we were way too stuffed for dessert. Our meal was rich but overall an excellent meal. CUT did not let us down.

All of the waitstaff is very attentive and well trained such as asking if it is ok for them to cut the fried egg that was on top of the asparagus appetizer. There was refilled water and wine before you could barely get through half of the glass. The staff earns every dollar of the gratuity here.\n\nFor an appetizer I ordered the glazed pork belly. Honestly, if they could have just loaded me up on that I would have been satisfied. It was very tender and flavorful. Others in my party ordered the tuna tartar and the warm asparagus. If you're a sushi fan then the tartar is for you. The asparagus dish was different than I expected but very tasty.\n\nMy main course was the 12oz ribeye cooked medium-rare. The steak rub used is a tad on the salty side but the tenderness and steak flavor is out of this world. For sides the table ordered the pureed potatoes and the creamed spinach w/ fried egg. The all star here was the spinach. I liked the texture the fried egg gave to the creamed spinach. \n\nDessert was banana cream pie. Overall a very solid dessert but compared to the rest of the meal it was the weakest. If I go again I will probably get the chocolate souffl\u00e9 instead. \n\nBe sure to make reservations and just relax and enjoy the service. Save your allowance and treat yourself to a night at CUT.\n\nAlso, I was under the impression that one needed to dress up a tad for this place. That was not the case. We spotted at least a couple of people in shorts and a baseball cap. But of course their money spends the same as mine."

The service here definitely deserves 5 stars, but not the rest. \n\nThe bone marrow with the mushroom thing on the side was SO GOOD!  It's nothing you've ever had in your life before. The bread was also toasted perfect, which complement the texture of the bone marrows perfectly. I, however, just eat the bone marrow straight up!\n\nMy bf and I also got the ox tail soup..... he says it tastes like something I know how to make.... which is kinda true, except I don't purify my soup @ all.  The soup was like 3 stars; nothing spectacular at all. \n\nSteak is next on the menu. We ordered porter house, so that we can share and compare it with the ones we had a Mastro's & Ruth Chris'. I didn't really like it because they let their steak sit. The FOBBINESS in me has to have everything pipping hot to taste fresh and good, so not my kinda stuff. The steak also tastes a little flavorless..... It doesn't have the deep meaty flavor that I excepted and got from Mastro's age beef. \n\nThe steak also came with 3 different kind of freshly made mustard, a French sea salt, a hollandaise sauce, and another sauce.  I don't know, that's just too many sauce for me to think about with my meat!  I just want MEAT and good tasting MEAT, so all those sauce just ain't giving the steak it's day to shine!\n\nOn to the sides, we got sauteed mushroom, which is unlike the usual sauteed mushroom you get.  The mushroom are wild mushrooms, so it's very different. And, too much butter for me. We also got potatoes as one of our sides, which I had none cause I don't eat pork (sorry to all those I offended).   \n\nIn summery, VERY FANCY kinda place, VERY OVER THE TOP SERVICE & PRICE TAG.  Nonetheless, if it's just about the steak, I would still give the award to Mastro's!"

These snacks were actually not a good reflection of what was about to come. The wasabi peas just tasted stale, like from a bag at the asain market. I had a bailey's coffee while waiting and it was perfect. Once seated our waiter describes the different cuts of meat amd explained Wolf Gang's beliefs in his WELL program- meaning they try to adhere to safe meat practices, humanely prepared, locally resourced, grass fed etc. \n\nThe service was amazing and the food overall was delicious. Their prices are reasonable for a typical quality steakhouse. They had a server for each main course which I thought was a nice touch. \n\nThe bathrooms were amazing- sorry I have to always give props for the bathrooms."

Ambiance is great, wine selection was great and was excited to try the food.\nThe one thing that really annoyed was how the server told us to order the appetizer at the same time with the entree. We're hungry...what's the big deal with wanting to try starters as we're perusing over what type of steak and sides we wanted? \nBesides that, service was excellent. These guys are professionals, attentive and clearly passionate about there jobs. \nOk, now for the main spotlight! The steak. I ordered the American Wagyu petite steak. Maybe it was a little too much hype? Not sure, but it was all right. Personally, I didn't think there was anything stellar special about it. I've read all the reviews stating how it's the \"best steak\" ever and I think that statement is a little overrated. \nNevertheless, I say it's worth checking it out just to at least give it a try and decide for yourself. After all, you just never know till you give it a try. On a final note, a must try is the tuna tartar. Skip the bone marrow flan. Pork belly was on the salty side. If you don't order anything else, just trust me...and get the tuna tartar!"

DO NOT get bottled or sparkling water, it is $9 each, which is ridiculous, house water is free, stick with that. However, started with the Maple Glazed Pork Belly, which was very delicious, I would highly recommend. Then me and my Fiance both got the American Wagyu, Snake River Farms Idaho New York Sirloin 8 Oz. I got the Yukon Gold Potato Puree on the side and he got the Hand Cut French Fries with Herbs for his side. All of it was ridiculously tasty, I was very happy with everything I ate. The $400+ bill I was however not so pleased with which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I do however recommend this place. (However, Carnevino's steak was better!!!)"

After a few minutes the waiter would come by with a selection of breads for you to choose from.  The onion bread and the buns with the cross on them were both excellent, but I am sure that the other ones would have been just as good.  \n\nI would have to agree with the other reviewers, I had the Wagyu 10 oz. steak cooked to medium and it was quite easily the best steak I have ever eaten.  Yes it was $85 and the most expensive steak I have ever consumed, but worth every cent.  My friends steaks were also excellent but deferred to the Wagyu after we traded pieces in our own steak \"taste test\".  They offered various \"sauces\" for your steak on the side for you to put on, but as far as I was concerned, why mess with my meaty mass of perfection?  \n\nSince everyone wants their steak cooked to the way they like it, the wait staff indicated it would take about 25-30 minutes for our food.  I appreciated that since we wouldn't be sitting around wondering when everything was coming.  \n\nThe sides are ordered separately and  were also very good.  As a group we got the mashed potatoes and some mushrooms.  Think of the sides as a good opening act to your favourite band.  They were enjoyable but let's face it, you are there for the main act!  \n\nService overall was very very good.  The wine and water glasses never got below half and our server took the time to explain the different cuts of meat to those that had more questions."

We decided to try this restaurant due to the fact that they served True Japanese 100% Japan Wagyu which is really hard to find.  Most place serve either American kobe, American wagyu or Australian wagyu.  Rarely do they serve authentic wagu. \n\nReservation: Reservation was not bad at all.  You could easily make reservations the day of.  However, i would suggest making it several hours in advance just to be on the safe side.  The more last moment u make the reservation the later the time it seemed like. (I had gotten a reservation at 8pm but when i called around 7 to add 2 more people it got pushed to 10pm)\n\nLocation:  Cut was located inside the Palazzo hotel on the Lobby floor.\n\nDecor:  The decor was very nice.  It had somewhat of a modern theme.  Like with most fine dining restaurants, it had a slightly romantic dim light setting.  However it was not quiet nor too loud which was really nice since you can actually have a conversation with  your date or friends and not feel like your talking to loud or have a hard time hearing them.\n\nFood: \n\nBone Marrow Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad - This dish was delicious  and cooked perfectly.  It was evenly cooked and the mushroom marmalade complimented the bone marrow very nicely.\n\nTrue Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef from Miyazaki Prefecture, Kagoshima-  What can i say about this dish except that it was truly melt in your mouth delicious.  This was probably one of the best steaks i have had.  Typically for steaks, i have meat cooked at a medium rare but this time i asked the waiter how i should have this cut cooked since it was my first time eating 100% wagyu.  His recommendation was medium.  His reason was that it would allow all the heavy marbling to melt and absorb into the meat.  Cooking it medium rare may not melt the marbling completely and may leave it chewy.  As a result i went with Medium and i am glad i did.  The wagyu came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  I love the fact that they charred the top and bottom slightly so you get an initial flavorful crunch and then as u sink your teeth further into the meat it slowly melts away.  8oz was just perfect enough to get you full due to how rich it is.\n\nI will def be coming back again for some more bone marrow and wagyu."

The worst part has to be the service. It was very slow to start. My friends have been to CUT in L.A. and they were surprised how lackluster the service was in comparison. The servers tend to like to shove themselves in between you and the people next to you, typically surprising you and brushing up against you.  It was not acceptable. It made the meal continuously awkward.  I got the sashimi tuna steak and was suprised to get roughly 3-4 slices of sashimi (about the size of a medium sushi piece). The outside was mostly seasoned with salt and the whole thing lacked any real flavor besides that.  I understand the place is going to be pricey but I couldn't help thinking that I could have gone to an excellent sushi place and got great sashimi for half the price. So I guess take my opinion with a grain of salt since I'm the guy who orders fish at a steak restaurant and is supervised when it's not too great."

I've been to Las Vegas at least 7 times since I turned 21 and although it is very pricey, it is well worth it. \n\nNot only was it my first time to Vegas but it was also my honeymoon, the hostess asked my husband and I if it was a special occasion and when we arrived they made the entire experience one of a kind.\n\nWe ordered some drinks at the bar before our reservation, the bartender was very friendly and talkative and even gave us a coupon for 25% off our entire bill which was very helpful since we ordered a TON and spent well over $300.\n\nThey sat us in the front of the dining room facing everyone else with a huge table fit for a king in our own huge nook in the wall, the service was excellent and not snobby at all. At the time I was just beginning to become adventurous with trying new food. The bone marrow appetizer was amazing and left me craving it years after my visit. The steak for 2 was just like steak flavored butter, it ruined all other steak since.\n\nI will add on a side note that my husband went as far as to save the steak bone and flew it  all the way back to Alaska with us so my dog Zombie could also get a treat from Wolfgang Puck. I think that in itself should sell you on this restaurant, even if its only to try an appetizer."

We had a few nice appetizers that were presented beautifully and tasted just as good, as well as the stake samplers.  The steaks were great, I have to say the wagu tasted good but not that different, I have always have heard it would be drastically different, but this was not the case, it was not from Japan, so maybe that's the case. We also had a great bottle of wine that the waiter helped us choose.  \n\nThe bill for the 4 of us was a whopping $800 but good thing this was a business trip and it was all expensed:)  I'm not sure I would come back on my own dime, it was good but not earth shattering."

The steaks were some of the best we've ever had, EVER... and we eat at a lot of great steakhouses!  They are smoky and delicious.  My filet melted in your mouth, and people will say that all the time about steaks, but I mean LITERALLY disappeared in my mouth.  It was unbelievably delicious.  Herbed fries were a great side to share, beet salad was a good starter.  My only complaint is the wine list, they really could use some more moderately priced options.  There is NOTHING reasonable on that wine list.  The bartender, Chip, made awesome cocktails and was extremely knowledgable about wines and spirits.  All in all, an amazing dining experience."

I don't think the steak needed any condiments.  I ordered the Wagyu (grass fed) 6oz filet mignon with wasabi mustard, he got the USDA (corn fed) 8 oz filet topped with mushrooms and Armagnac and green peppercorn sauce.  They do blacken the steak which may put they temperature a little higher than what you're used to.  I got med rare, and could've went a little less, he was happy with the medium.  The meat was so tender and juicy.  I don't think paying $20 more for the Wagyu was worth the flavor, but it's nice knowing the cows were fed grass.  We picked the brussel sprouts with bacon as the side, the bacon chunks were pretty big.  We ordered a bottle of pinor noir from Oregon which went really well with the meat, unfortunately I don't remember the name but I can recall the label.  We finished with coffee and split the \"baked alaskan\" which had a raspberry sorbet and a chocolate cake. They also give chocolates and brittle with the bill.\n\nThe service was outstanding, the atmosphere was wonderful.  Though this wasn't the best steak I have eaten.  The experience was fantastic!  Reservations are a must on weekends."

Or I would say the deficiencies are in areas you would not think they would be in.  For instance they took our reservation for 16 and then when we showed up said that we had to sit at two different tables.. which the bachelor was not happy about... Then our table was a round table and it was so rickety. If anyone touched it, it would shake violently. They gave us bread and after we finished eating the bread they decided to bring out the sauce to dip the bread???? And when we asked for more of the pretzel sticks to eat they never brought them out. After 3 separate attempts of asking for them and them apologizing they still never ever brought them???\n\nThe little easy things were all wrong, that's what surprised me with this place.\n\nWhat about the food? IT WAS AMAZING!!!! I had the 16oz bone in Filet Mignon at the waiters suggestion and it was amazing. Cooked perfectly, soft and tender and had an amazing flavor. I tried the Australian Waygu Kobe beef that the bachelor ordered and it was unreal. It was so tasty.  The mac and cheese, fingerling potatoes, mashed potato puree and corn niblets were top notch! I had a 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon and it was very tasty as well. I spent about $110 after tax and tip and it was well worth it.\n\nNow if they can only get the simple easy details right... Like NOT having a rickety old table in a high end dining establishment."

The decor is contemporary minimalist...I came here for the steak, celebrating my birthday. The welcome host provided a most courteous pleasant and special experience. Our menu had a personalized inscription of my birthday celebration, nice touch! The Host ( I forgot his name, he was a tall, lean Asian gentleman) was very friendly and attentive to us. He provided helpful suggestions as to what items to order. Our designated server brought us a tray of the various cuts of meat. Gave us his recommendations, which essentially were the most expensive cuts on the menu. We decided to order the filet mignon and the sirloin $80-$89 respectively, the in house made bread were delectable, for an appetizer we shared the bone marrow (I've had better). For sides we had the mushrooms which we're the highlight of our entire meal. The steak was well cooked to our temperature: medium rare but just did not deliver on taste. The fact that they provide sauces to enhance the steak, means it is lacking flavor...any true steak connoisseur knows a good steak needs NOTHING! The Host recovered our dissatisfaction with a complimentary dessert, (I forgot what it was bc frankly it wasn't memorable) but I appreciated the sentiment. Nevertheless, for a $400+/meal for two, I expected my palette to be enticed and it disappointingly was not. This steakhouse just did not make the CUT, ironic given its unfitting name! \n\nFor a better experience that equals the food quality and taste, may I suggest Alexander's."

High five to Wolfgang Puck for an exceptional dining experience - delicious food with professional & attentive service.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/J4CATH00YZrq8Bne2S4_cw?select=G2-vNaQFSCP9bN7z-xJVUQ\nWhile waiting, we enjoyed various samples of bread - my favorite was the Bavarian pretzel.  Slightly salty, sweet, and an incredibly soft texture - divine.  \n\n\nPrior to ordering, I loved that the waiter rolled out several variations of the raw cut beef to demonstrate the difference in Kobe Wagyu & American style Wagyu (mixed with Angus to give it a meatier texture).  \nMy entree was the Petit Filet Mignon (USDA Illinois) served with the Argentinian chimichirri sauce, a light and springy taste with shallots, garlic, and cilantro.  Perfectly cooked at medium and absolutely delicious.  Refrain from biting the screen:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/J4CATH00YZrq8Bne2S4_cw?select=YXCIjyzzVH7Cb9vr-cifGg \nThe fiance also loved his American wagyu rib-eye with kosho butter sauce.  While part of the meat was slightly tough, the thicker end of the rib-eye melted in my mouth.  It's not necessary to order an additional sauce with your meat, since they also bring out three condiments for you to use anyhow.  \n\nI do recommend sharing the sides family style with a group - at about $12/side, you get a significant amount of delicious fare.  Our group of four split three sides: the delicious creamy Mac & Cheese with Quebec cheddar, the sauteed wild field mushrooms, and the butternut squash.  All were incredibly savory!  The best and most amusing part of the dinner was that we had three waiters (one per side dish) hovering next to us individually to explain what the dish was and proceeded to scoop it onto our plate before shuffling to the next person - it felt like culinary musical chairs.  If fighting over equal portions of a dish is an issue, this eliminates that problem...\n\nAmbiance is very modern and sleek.  It is pretty dim, but it wasn't too bothersome for us.  Similar to the sauce, ordering dessert isn't necessary since they brought out a plate with decadent filled chocolates.  An exquisite way to end a satisfying and indulgent meal."

When I go to top-end steak-houses, I expect top notch service and was not failed for the first 3/4 of our dining experience. But on the back end, the attentiveness wasnt there once our main course was served (he quit filling our wine for us, took a while to clear the plates, took even longer bring dessert menu, took a LONG time to bring check). And we had a later reservation, so it wasnt like he was in the weeds.\n\nThe crab and shrimp appetizer was good, but nothing outstanding. The Asparagus app was very good though. The butter lettuce salad was just ok to me. Im not a fan of the blue cheese with a vinaigrette salad, but the gf wanted it. My opinion on this is purely just my palate...Im sure other would think it was very good.\n\nThe steak...was ok...good, but nothing special (at this price point). I actually enjoy steaks at some other places better (craftsteak, for instance). It was cooked perfectly, but I didnt really care for the lack of seasoning. I know some will argue that point, but that was my main problem with the steak, it lacked seasoning that really brings out the flavors. I suppose its better than over seasoning though.\n\nOur sides were the mac and cheese (outstanding!!!!) and some roasted corn or something like that. The mac and cheese was absolutely fantastic and I would go back just for that, but the corn was disappointing. It had some of the hard parts of the cob still attached. while I appreciate the effort of freshly peeled corn, I guess I just wanted to see it done well.\n\n\nOverall, I enjoy trying different steakhouses and this place ranks with the others in their price point. It wasnt my favorite, but it was still good. If you are a steakhouse fan like me, its worth trying out."

When we finally did get our entrees the steak was some of the worst I've ever had. Dry, overcooked, just awful especially for $78 or whatever egregious amount they charge.

Its pricey but since the first time was so goood, I had to come again and make sure I wasn't dreaming before... here's why CUT's sooo great:\n\nSERVICE:  The waiters and waitresses go above and beyond to make sure their guests have a wonderful experience. They're attentive and came right over when they felt like we wanted/needed something. My friend and I ordered a bottle of riesling and loved it. Unfortunately, we forgot to get the winery it was from and decided to ask the waiter. He wasted no time to find the name for us and came back with all the information we would need in a fancy little envelope. The little things people do always make a big difference. \n\nFOOD: The bread is DELICIOUS!! There's a man that comes around with a platter of different types of breads you can try. I've tried all of them and my faves are the onion bread and the pretzel. SO GOOD. We got two appetizers, bone marrow and kobe sliders. The bone marrow was pretty good, it was very creamy and topped with a sauce that added some saltiness to the dish. The kobe sliders were topped with sweet pickles and sauteed onions. The meat was soft (of course). For the main dishes, my friend ordered a 20 oz. USDA bone-in rib-eye with bone marrow. It was huge!!!! It was cooked perfectly to his liking. My other friend ordered kobe spare ribs. She said that the meat was nice and soft too, but the flavoring wasn't her style. I got the japanese kobe wagyu ribeye with bone marrow. OMG. LIKE BUTTER, probably because there was fat throughout the meat. It was soft, very, very, VERY soft. I mean, I knew that japanese wagyu meat was soft, but this practically melted in my mouth. I'm still contemplated whether it was a bit too soft... haha. I dunno. The first time I came I had the American kobe ribeye and I might like that one more just because I don't feel like I'm eating butter... :)\n\nAnyway, CUT is amazing.

The steak was bland with little to no seasoning. I had to coat it with some sea salt, cracked pepper, and a little butter. \n\nThe asparagus was not tender enough and lacked any real flavors. I was in shock when the bill arrived and I noticed that 7 stalks of asparagus cost $21!! The Mac and Cheese was nothing to write home about either, it was $19 for a decent sized portion. The Potato Puree was bland, it literally tasted like mucky potato and cost $12. \n\nI know we were going with the expectation of spending a lot of money, but for the money I was hoping to be blown away. I still believe that a place like LongHorn Steakhouse or Texas Roadhouse had better tasting steak.\n\nIf you are looking to spend and arm and a leg for sub-par food, then I would suggest going to CUT."

For me the high notes on the meal were the complimentary bread and butter and the salad, not really something that should be my takeaway from an expensive steakhouse.  \n\nThe staff were fine, they provided great timely service without being obtrusive and never rushing us.  This was very appreciated and also a high note.  The ambiance of casino steakhouses always throws me off as you can be dressed up or dressed down and it's all good.  My friend and I were dressed a simple business casual, seated next to a couple that were in tshirts and shorts, meanwhile there were some businessmen with women in full on party dress glam.  It's very dimly lit and dark in there and the tables have springy chairs that remind me of office desk chairs, kind of unexpected (they swiveled and reclined) \n\nThey bring out some cheese straws before you order and then a basket of gougeres and then they come around with a cutting board with a selection of various breads.  I had the pretzel and the multigrain, both were excellent along with the sweet cream butter provided.  For dinner we shared butter lettuce salad with blue cheese avocado and champagne vinaigrette,  6oz of the Japanese Wagyu New York, sauteed kale side, and fingerling potatoes.  \n\nThe salad was very good, served whole leaf and dressed perfectly.  If this was the end of my dinner along with the bread I would have left satisfied.  The steak was presented in a 4 oz strip and a small 2 oz chunk charred almost black on the outside and sitting in a pool of it's own rendering fat and bits of char starkly in the center of a large square white plate, Not really an attractive presentation, I was not expecting the $165 order of meat to come in two chunks. We ordered med rare and it was more rare on the inside and charred on the outside, especially since they were cut into two.  It was tender and rich, but streaked with tough chewy fascia and was exceedingly salty.  It was hard to taste the beef flavor, you definitely got the rich oily mouth feel bursting with each bite, but so much salt.  The sauteed kale was also very salty, as were the fingerling potatoes.  The potatoes had that distinct taste and texture of potatoes that were cooked, cooled, and reheated, it's a subtle stale taste and sticky texture I find offputting. \n\nThe dessert was a beautiful presentation of strawberry shortcake, thin biscuits layered with quenelles of ice cream and stewed strawberries.  The stewed strawberries were very tasty with concentrated berry flavor.\n\nAgain, the staff were very timely and friendly, no issues at all there and appropriate for the pricepoint of the restaurant.  However the food was disappointing, especially the expensive steak."

Impeccable service, classic decor, and dare I say...orgasmic food!\n\nWe arrived with a reservation and were seated immediately in a large banquet. The host moved the table out so that no one had to awkwardly shuffle in. The gesture was appreciated, as were the accent pillows for back support. The seating is one long banquet along the two main walls and a row of tables down the centre. The dining room feels intimate with low lighting and muted decor. \n\nOur waitress was lovely and knowledgeable. Like many other steakhouses a sample plate of the cuts are brought to your table and reviewed. She explained all the cuts of meat without making you feel like if you didn't order the Wagyu (which starts at $150 for 6oz) that you were a Neanderthal of the food world. Have to say the Wagyu did look amazing with all its marbling...add that to the bucket list.\n\nThen came the bread. With a special waiter just for it. 5 types were offered. They all looked great, but I chose a pretzel bread. The butter served with it was from France and it was explained to us that it has a higher fat content than American butter. It is sooooo worth it. It was crusted with a Rosemary salt that gave it a little zing. At the first creamy taste, let's face it, the bread became a butter delivery vehicle.\n\nIt got better from there.\n\nApp: we shared the butter lettuce salad. So fresh. Light. A great start to a meal you know will be heavy.\n\nMain: Illinois filet. Done to a perfect mid rare. Unbelievably tender. Served with a selection of mustards. They were an interesting accompaniment but really not necessary as the steak alone was so flavourful.\n\nSides: Peas and pea shoots. OMG. I have never loved a pea more in my life. Saut\u00e9ed in butter, but perfectly crisp. Texture added from the shoots took them to the next level I think.\n\nOnion rings. Yup. Was surprised to see them on the menu. But these are not your fast food grease circles. Think more along the lines of high end Japanese tempura. The house made ketchup that comes with was great - tangy more so than sweet.\n\nWe were too full for dessert but we were brought a small complimentary selection of petit fours. A very nice way to end the meal.\n\nThis place is expensive, but no more so than other Vegas steakhouses on the strip. And it was worth every penny. This is a meal I dream about."

            "review": "Definitely experienced better and definitely NOT worth the money. \n\nKey problems:\n1) Waiters were good and attentive, but talked a little too much and tried to push the most expensive items too hard.\n2) Steaks -- I ordered medium.  I got medium well.  I like medium well and generally dislike sending things back luckily for them.  But when you're paying over $60 for a steak, it should be cooked exactly how you ask for it.  This did not appear to be a one steak problem -- my wife asked for medium and then got medium rare.  Again, she likes it both ways, but pretty much inexcusable at a place like this.  I note that the waiters did NOT even ask us if they were cooked to our liking.  Most good places they'll even watch you cut into it and see what you think.\n3) This goes with out saying, but the place is unquestionably overpriced.  If I'm going to pay over $150 per person plus tip, it should be a pretty amazing meal.  This one was good enough, but nothing really wowed me.  \n\nBut the kicker was the $8 \"Special Occasion\" fee added to our bill.  My wife had mentioned it was my birthday that day.  At the end, the waiter asked us if we wanted desert.  We said no thank you because we were too full.  But the waiter decides to bring over a sliver of baked alaska with happy birthday written next to it.  It was a nice touch until we get the bill and were CHARGED $8 for a SLIVER of desert THAT WE DID NOT ASK FOR.  Yes, $8 was a small percentage of our bill.  Yes, I enjoyed the touch of desert.  But bringing someone desert they specifically declined and then charging them is simply unconscionable and totally classless.  That's Vegas for you I guess, fake classy."

Waiters came over and we were provided water bread etc.  The wygu beef was paraded but we passed.  It was the beginning of the service degradation. Did not know it was mandatory. The wine list came and even by NY standards it was outrageous.  The second mistake was made when I ordered a Darioush which was below the expected price point of the wait staff. I thought it was a great pick and went with it despite a suggestion of a wine 5 times the price. \n\nAppetizers were shared - strike 3.  The tuna tartare with Avocado was ok.  It had a too sharp fishy taste for me so I ate very little - luckily as it was off and even that small piece did the damage ( later that night). The other dish was the pork belly (2orders as uu get only 4 pieces and we were 5). \n\nFor entrees it was steaks all around.  I chose a medium rare NY strip. It was tasty but overcooked. The one end was thicker (about 1/2 inch piece) and that part was ok.  I told the waiter when he came by and he promised he would tell the chef.....   Nothing more was heard.  So you are welcome, your steak will be cooked the way you asked for it when uu go.  Two other steaks were also overcooked.  Sides consisted of the mushrooms (special dish - excessively salty), broccolini (salt), cauliflower and creamed spinach.  \n\nThe overall bill was probably one of the most expensive in my life - I have eaten at Michelin ranked places in Paris for less.   \n\nWould I go back?  No.  \nShould you go? If you have an expense account and are willing to endure the scorn of the staff if you don't spend enough, you should still not go.  It's not worth it.  \n\nAvoid."

What can I say... the food, service, and atmosphere was all superb!\n\nOnce we got to the restaurant we were seated right away by the hostess. Our waiter came by and handed us our menus and explained alittle about their steaks. The whole staff was pretty knowledgeable. \n\nWe started the night off with a bottle of wine. Cut has an extensive wine list! They have their wine list on an ipad and so the list is actually very overwhelming. Upon asking our sommelier he recommended us a bottle of their Heitz Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon since we were all going to get steak... and this wine did not disappoint... It was so good! :)\n\nWe started off the night with their Steak Tartare (4/5) ... wow so amazing.. loved the mustard sauce that complimented it... We had their American Wagu Ribeye (5/5) and their American Wagu New York (5/5). For sure the New York was drier than the Ribeye as expected. But both were some good quality meat. They were cooked just right and seasoned to perfection. The meat just melted in your mouth... OMG I am salivating while writing this review. Definitely get the American Wagu if money is not too much of an issue. I have friends that came to CUT and had their regular cuts and they weren't too impressed. So definitely get the American Wagu... you wont be disappointed... For us the Japanese Wagu looked way too fatty... So that's why we opted for the American Wagu... \n\nFor our sides we got their Brussle Sprouts (4/5) and their Mac &Cheese (5/5)... The Mac & Cheese was definitely on the heavy side but I loved it! Loved the cheesy-ness of the whole dish... they had such a great combination of cheeses to make this dish... it did not disappoint... but definitely you can't have too much of it... \n\nFor dessert we ordered their Banana Cream Pie which was amazing (4/5)... They were also nice enough to give us an extra dessert (the Baked Alaska 5/5) because it was one  of our friend's birthday! We didn't even ask them but they brought it out on the house! Definitely loved that. \n\nAll the staff members were polite and did their job immepeccably. They weren't snobby or rude.. All were very down to earth and made our experience at Cut memorable. I would definitely be back here if it didn't damage my wallet too much! Nom Nom ^^"

It is expensive I am not going to lie.  Steaks are probably like $80+ dollars.  \n\nI ended up sharing a piece rib eye with somebody else because we don't eat alot and it's not like we lived there so we couldn't take it with us or anything.  I think ALOT of us ended up sharing because of this reason and portions were sized enough where we can share.\n\nThe steaks were cooked perfectly and they were good.   We had bone marrow to top off which made it even better.  \n\nNow when it came to sides - obviously restaurants like these you order them separately on the side.  Because there was so many in our party, we liked a variety and wanted to just order whatever we wanted and share.  \n\nThere was a waitress there that gave us a hard time about that and even had to nerve to ask if it was a money issue.  We knew what we wanted to order and we were going to share accordingly ourselves.  That comment alone made the entire party pretty angry and the experience bad.  $1700 for about 14 girls?  I think that obviously we weren't complaining about the money.  Somebody in this business should know better than to say that.  I wouldn't go back even nor do I recommend this place.  Wolfgang Puck was a name that you pay for.  There are far better places with better steaks and better services."

This place is AMAZING and was the best out of the 4 we tried!!! We both had the American Wagyu beef (filet mignon and NY steak), with potato pur\u00e9e and roasted brussel sprouts. The meat was so tender, juicy, and seasoned perfectly, plus it had a wonderful sear on both sides (no need to add any extras/sauces). There is definitely a difference between your \"everyday\" filet mignon and American Wagyu. If you come here expect to splurge, and in my opinion it's pointless to get any cut of beef of lesser quality than the Wagyu. \n\nThe pur\u00e9e was delicious, very creamy and great flavor. The brussel sprouts were roasted with bacon and pearl onions - another very tasty side dish. We ordered the butter lettuce salad as an appetizer and loved it. My husband, who doesn't usually care for salads, would order it again in a heartbeat. It comes with a spectacular champagne vinaigrette that ties all the flavors together. For dessert we had the chocolate souffl\u00e9 and banana cream pie. In addition, they bring you bread with dinner. Of the 4 choices we recommend the focaccia and pretzel bread...delightful! \n\nOverall this place has superb food and great service. We are definitely going back the next time we are in Vegas.

It is pricy, though, so make sure you're okay with spending big bucks on a great dinner. Worth every penny, but be warned."

Back in the heyday of our economy, people would splurge and head to restaurants like this to spend $140 for a 3 pieces of 4oz. 'kobe steak sampler', and then be forced to spend another $12 to $15 per additional side.  When I went here ~3 weeks ago, my Radiologist buddy dropped ~$500 for his meal--he had the Kobe sampler, 1 side, and had 2 to 3 glasses of wine and a desert (we as a table had split up the cost of all the side dishes).  If this seems exorbitant/bit of highway robbery to you, that's because it is!\n\nIt'd be one thing if the food was orgasmic.  I personally have a hard time justifying overpaying simply for the title \"Kobe beef\" on my dinner plate.  And unless the prices here included little women with soft hands massaging my toenails, I cannot say that the food was worth it.  Perhaps if they cut their prices in 1/2, maybe.  \n\nAltogether, I'd avoid CUT like the plague, unless you are taking that pretentious materialistic kinda' date that is more impressed with how much you CAN pay, rather than the actual quality of the food."

This, is marketing/entertainment at its pinnacle. From the display platter, you will clearly be impressed with how well the Australian waygu marbles, even in comparison to its American counterpart. While I \"settled\" for the American wagyu ribeye, the buttery texture and the sweet yet savory flavor of the meat was better than steak I've had previously.\n\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter was witty, but not chatty, and apparently has a photographic memory of the Wikipedia page on waygu beef. \n\nThe setting was spacious yet extremely intimate. We were seated in one of the side booths, which could have easily sat a party of 6. The booth was filled with plush pillows. Food coma? no problem, simply take a nap and continue eating afterwards. \n\nOur order of two drinks, tuna tartare, one USDA prime bone in ribeye, one American wagyu ribeye, and one side of field mushrooms and shishito peppers came out to $305, counting tax and tip."

We came right as they opened and they weren't busy at all; believe me when we left, it was packed in the resto and lounge!\n\nHad a couple of drinks at the bar and their bar food alone was tasty. Popcorn cooked in duck and bacon fat. Unpitted olives. Bar nuts. A few negronis and couple vodka sodas did us good at the bar.\n\nOk. Where do I even start? I feel like we had everything on the menu. \nCouple bottles of wine and couple decanters are beautiful. One of the decanters was so intricate that it looked like a Chihuly piece of glass art. Very impressive!\n\nStarted with their maple glazed pork belly and tuna tartare. My favorite pork belly is at Goyemon and this, obviously, blew that out of the park.\nButter poached lobster with truffle emulsion topped with truffle shavings was everything.delectable.in.life.ever! If there's ever a time to splurge, it's during truffle season!\nThe meat tasting with the best cuts of meat (waygu, rib eye, filet) was L I F E changing. They brought out all the cuts of meat and to see all the marbling and taste the butteriness of the meats was outstanding. \nBUT, my favorite of the night was the Colorado rack of lamb. Prior to discovering rib eye, lamb was my go-to meat anywhere and everywere; and Cut's lamb just reignited my love for it. SO stellar that I can just taste it while I type this.\nSides: mac and cheese, spinach, Brussels. Heck, what didn't we have. \nThis goes for the dessert spread. Geezus.\n\nLiterally, had so much food that I was in a food coma for a couple days -- and we had lefties.\n\nFrom the time we were seated, our service was top notch. For service alone, I wish I could add 10 more stars to this review. Every move from putting each course on the table to pouring the wine was synchronized. Service was a show! That's what really set Cut apart from other restaurants for me. \n\nOther than vacations and adventures, please please treat yourself to the meal and experience that CUT Steakhouse is."

I got the tasting that included Wagyu.  This is where I think most people accidentally pick the wrong thing.. they'll go for something that is Illinois NY strip, etc. but this place is known for the tender Wagyu.  The side dishes were really good.  The artichoke and cauliflower were amazing.

The meat itself was okay, not juicy at all even though it was definitely pink inside.  I'm pretty sure something is wrong here. Dry aged steaks are still supposed to be juicy even though some of the water is lost in the process, right? Well Cut got my steak wrong or is just wrong in general. I suppose that there strong selling point is the Kobe and maybe I should have ordered it, but then why even have the other dry aged steaks on the menu? Anyway, I was disappointing with how dry and burnt and tasteless my $60 dry aged bone in ribeye tasted and probably wouldn't come back.

Onion focaccia, pretzel roll, and pumpernickel as well as cheese encrusted super long and thin bread sticks. Wow, so good.\n\nWe all had an appetizer. Mine was a crab/lobster dish that was so good and the best of the lot. My wife had the apple salad which she loved and mom had the beet dish.\n\nWe all had steak or course. I didn't see the steak sampler on the menu which gives you a 2.4 oz portion of 3 steaks to try, some aged domestic, a kobe domestic and a Japanese Kobe, so I asked the waiter and the chef went ahead and let me have it. All were amazing. There is a VERY distinct difference between the domestic and the Kobes to be sure. The Kobes are much marbled and the flavor is more subtle. Between the domestic Kobe and the japanese Kobe the difference is there but not enough IMO to justify the price difference. In the future I will probably go for the domestic Kobe because it is in the sweet spot of price and flavor.\n\nMy wife had the domestic Kobe ribeye and my mother had a domestic aged strip. All were amazing!\n\nSides: We shared creamed spinach, brussel sprouts, sushito pepper dish. All wonderful.\n\nWine: We shared a bottle of Pinot Noir which was excellent.\n\nDesert: We shared 3, the banana cream pie dish, the chocolate souffle and lemon cheesecake which was AMAZING.\n\nThe Service was 5+/5, Food 5+/5 Probably our best experience so far at CUT!

The decor and service is what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber...top notch. There was a beat that was missed by the staff and everything was perfect. With regard to the food, I had expected a little more. \n\nWe started with the Big Eye Tuna tartare and a special of Blue crab claws. The tartare was excellent however there was really no wow factor and nothing that set it apart from something you would find at any other restaurant. The crab was just that...crab claws. Basically a bowl with some crab claws...they weren't even pre-cracked. As much as I love going through cracking shell fish, this wasn't the restaurant I was planning on doing it in and again I had hoped for something more than simply claws. \n\nNext up were the sides (I'll save the steak for last). We each picked something and got the French Fries, Onion Rings, Swiss Chard and Autumn root veggies. The Chard and the root veggies were good but the fries and rings were completely disappointing. Easily something we all took a taste off and could have been happy not having any more of. Again nothing special here and no wow factor. \n\nFinally the steak. I ended up with the bone in Rib Eye from Illinois...rare. This was a fantastic piece of meat. My only complaint here was that they went a little heavy on the seasoning. \n\nThe wine list was incredible. I didnt want to hold the table up as I picked a bottle but i honestly could have read through it for a good 30 minutes. I stayed in the sub $100 range for a bottle and was able to pick an excellent one...but beware as there is little choice in that category. \n\nIf I go back I would stay out of the appetizer and side sections and just focus on the meat...and ask them to go light with the seasoning."

Being served by 5-6 servers at the same time we felt like royalty. It was my friend's 21st birthday and the GM offered us limo rides to any clubs we wanted. Too bad we had prior engagements."

But unlike most places I've been in Vegas, I felt the value was there even compared to top steakhouses in places like San Francisco, New York and Omaha. (Yes, Omaha).\n\nThe service was impeccable. What really set it apart for me is when I was looking for a spot to set down an empty appetizer tray and the sommelier - not a busser or waiter - grabbed it and bussed it. Really impressive.\n\nAll the food was up to the highest steakhouse standards. I didn't spring for Kobe beef but I didn't regret that. My steak was excellent and cooked as ordered.\n\nWe had a large group, ~18, and they did a great job accommodating us at two neighboring tables."

Half of our party was served their first course (there were 12 of us) and the other half didn't get served for 20 minutes. We had to point out that we were still waiting and the staff looked decidedly annoyed with us. Our waiters were neglectful and surly.\nThis is my second time at Cut and will be my last...it better be, or shame on me!\nCut does NOT make the cut."

I made this reservation about two  months ago and for the simple reason that my wife is from Nebraska and Cut serves a very nice corn fed beef from NE. We had it in Beverly Hills and loved it and the service.\n\nWe checked in at the front desk and were shown to a table right in front of the kitchen door. We were told its all we have. Wrong, I don't want to have a great dinner interrupted by servers going by our table every minute. Either poor design or greedy management. I was asked to wait in the bar and we should have had dinner there...great service in the bar. I was then shown to another table that was better...so they told me. No staff will go through here....wrong again, but I just wanted to eat at that point. \n\nFood is good. Wine list amazing, so i can't ding them on any of that. I just felt during the whole meal that I was not spending enough. Very subtle, but it was there. No bottle of wine? No dessert? Hmmmm, how about the $50.00 steak I just ordered. \n\nI get it, big rent and expensive brand. I think i will go back to the Palm where I feel appreciated."

So long as you're OK with the prices, I'd definitely say put CUT on your list of considerations. \n\nIs it deserving of its #2 steakhouse in Las Vegas fame? It certainly is believable. The filet I had was WAY better than the one I just recently had at Morton's in Schaumburg, IL (Chicago) an offshoot of the original Morton's and absolutely legendary for their steaks. It also easily KOs SW in the Wynn in the first round but there are plenty of other serious contenders in Vegas. Perhaps it was a one time wonder but I once had an absolutely amazing filet at the steakhouse in the Luxor, a place simply known as \"The Luxor Steakhouse\". In any case, the steaks at CUT are truly suburb! \n\nSo why four stars and not five with all this hype? While Wagyu steak is typically expensive and CUT's prices weren't higher than the norm here, their other dishes and more regular cuts are quite a bit pricier than usual. Also, the location is a bit away from the typical Vegas energy and excellent being in the shopping area between The Venetian and The Palazzo. I personally prefer the Beverly Hills setup and location. \n\nWhat I ordered: \n\nApple Martini - good not great. A bit weak for my taste and no ice crystals floating on top. \n\nMaple Glazed Pork Belly Appetizer - made with Asian spices, sesame-orange dressing, and Bartlett pear compote this plate was delish but not on the same level as the best pork belly dishes I've had. Still, definitely recommended. \n\nPetit Cut Filet Mignon 8 Oz - being a fan of the leaner cuts over the Wagyu, I ordered this USDA PRIME, Illinois Corn Fed, Aged 21 Days steak rare and it was served cooked to perfection. As you should have gathered from the above, I really loved this steak though I did find the pepper seasoning just a bit strong. The pepper crust is something to note since this is not the standard way of preparing a filet mignon at a lot of places. Of curiosity still to me, is how the USDA PRIME, Nebraska Corn Fed, Dry Aged 35 Days 10 oz would have compared to the cut I ordered. \n\n\nWhile I didn't order CUT's Mac & Cheese made with Quebec Cheddar this is something I would have loved to have tried. Since I didn't notice they had this dish until later, I thought I would mention it here so the same didn't happen to other Mac & Cheese fans out there. \n\n\nEnjoy..."

They bring a bread basket and ask what type of bread you would like. My suggestion: say \"all, please\". They were all very yummy. Service was great, their drinks were great and service was excellent. My husband and I thought their sides were good - not excellent but good. Definately check this place out when you are in Vegas. Apparently there is a Cut in LA that is really hard to get into. We went to this restaurant in early June and it wasn't very busy but I imagine they will start getting busy soon."

Instead of the usual beef carpaccio i always ordered i decided to try the different appetizers that were offered where you don't see at restaurants.\n\nI started off with the warm asparagus with poached egg and warm bacon vinegarette and the maple glazed pork belly with asian spices, sesame, orange dressing, bartlett pear compote. Let me tell you how delicious these appetizers were. I would never have thought that an asparagus dish for an appetizer would be this yummy. And the pork belly? WOW simply tasty and not too salty. Both were perfect to start our meal.\n\nI ordered the tasting to NY sirloin: American Kobe Style from snake farm rivers 4oz, USDA Prime dry aged  35 days 4oz, and Austalian Waygu  From Victoria Falls, Australia 2oz. Oh MY GOODNESS, i don't think i can ever order a regular steak anymore. All three were so tender especially my favorite which is the waygu. Melts in your mouth. This place is a little pricey but it's worth it. \n\nLOVE CUT! Favorite steakhouse!"

Some were outstanding -- clearly of the standard you would expect in a high-end steakhouse, let alone one associated with Wolfgang.  Others were of the caliber you might find a Sizzlers.  Not that they were bad or rude, but more of the \"I'm here to bring you your food.  Here it is.  Now shut up.\"  We would go through stretches of time wondering if anyone was coming for a drink order, next round, and so on.  The people who brought out the main course were top notch.  They knew their craft & wanted to make sure we were happy.\n\nNext less-than-positive:  What's with all the nickel & diming?  I'm $70 for a steak.  Do you really have to charge me a dollar for a sauce?  I mean, seriously.  When I visit fast food in bad parts of town, I get why they charge $.50 for extra sauce.  But here?  Seriously?  \n\nAnd no refills on soda? I guess that 12 cents they have to spend on syrup for soda would really set them back otherwise.\n\nLast complaint:  Of course you can request your steak at the standard raw/medium/etc., but I was surprised I couldn't get my steak \"rare plus.\"  Given I find that in less prestigious steakhouses, I was surprised they wouldn't do it here.\n\nAll that said, the meat itself was on par with what I would expect.  Not the best steak I've ever had, but very, very good."

It was as if we were sitting on a sofa.  We began the meal by ordering their pork belly and kobe steak sashimi.  The pork belly was simply outstanding......very fatty and super tasty with tangy hoisin sauce.  The kobe sashimi was buttery......very tender.\n\nFor our steaks, we had the 10 ounce wagyu rib eye and the 20 ounce bone in rib eye.  Both steaks were awesome...the marbling in the waygu was very fatty.....meaning so flavorful.  For our sides, we had the creamed spinach with an organic egg and herb fries...both very good and blended perfectly with the steaks.\n\nFor desert, we had the baked Alaska, banana pie, and date cake.  All three were excellent.....the sweet flavors ended the meal perfectly.\n\nThe service was OUTFUCKINGSTANDING!
