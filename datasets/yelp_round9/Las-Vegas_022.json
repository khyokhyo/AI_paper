Crab cakes were good, bisque was ok but not too flavorful more creamy... The salads were nothing special and definitely wouldn't order one if it didn't come with our entree. Compared to other steakhouses we weren't overly impressed. Service was great though!"

My beef Wellington was absolutely amazing - I wish I had the budget to eat here once a week. Their sommelier is extremely knowledgable, and the servers are all friendly and outgoing. The rose at the door? Just the cherry on the sundae."

            "review": "OUTSTANDING!! \n\nLocated in the Four Queens Casino, it reminds you about the glamour of how Las Vegas used to be. Every staff member is dressed in 3 piece suits, polished and friendly. They give every lady a single rose upon entry. The decor is old school Vegas with the brick work and stained glass light fixtures. It's dark and it's the perfect spot to have an intimate dinner date. My BF made reservations for my birthday so we were seated right away. \n\nThe dinner starts with a delicious bread basket and drinks. My vodka martini was nice and strong and the left over drink was served over ice. The amount of drink they gave me was close to 3 glasses full. A+ for me!!!\n\nNext, someone comes to your table with the salad cart full of options. Toppings included tomatoes, onions, eggs, croutons, mushrooms, artichokes, etc. Their Cesar dressing was amazing!! They make the dressing fresh so you can really taste the anchovies and all the other spices. My only gripe was the server poured waaaaay too much dressing over my salad. After finishing the salads, they serve you a raspberry sorbet to cleanse your palate for your main course. \n\nI ordered the seafood trio which came with a jumbo lump crab cake, Chilean sea bass and grilled shrimp. The crab cake was full of crab meat and flavorful. The sea bass was so flaky and moist. The shrimp was lackluster compared to the other two and a tad bit over cooked. My BF ordered the rib eye medium rare. Perfection!! The steak was tender and cut like butter. Super juicy! \n\nYour dinner comes with a light dessert consisting of two chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots served with fresh whipped cream. The whipped cream was the best part! I could have licked the bowl, but I held back. Lol! Of course they do offer more decadent desserts on their menu. As a bonus, our server Oscar brought me a chocolate lava cake for my birthday! \n\nThank you to the staff of Hugo's Cellar for making my birthday special. This will definitely be a spot to visit again!!"

We consider ourselves fairly sophisticated Foodies who cook at home almost all nights.  We want our restaurant meals to meet our expectations.  Hugo's Cellar did just that. From beginning to end, from Rose when we entered to noisemaker when we left..this was an exceptional meal and experience!! The staff were perfect, the food was amazing and this was worth every penny!  Our first trip there..not the last."

Reviews for Hugo's cellar were really good and the Chateaubriand and lobster for two sounded like just the ticket for our celebration. The setting is lovely, dark and romantic. The meal started off nicely with a wonderful salad served table side but unfortunately the experience went down from there.  We were quite excited when we saw the nice sized lobster tail and were fully ready to enjoy.  The steak was ordered mid rare and served medium and the poor shellfish was overcooked to the point that no amount of butter to dip it in was going to help.  The staff was semi solicitous and asked if we wanted replacements but we opted to just take our desert to go and make an end to the disappointing meal."

Tucked away in the basement of one of the oldest casinos the four queens. The experience from start to finish was all top notch. \n\nGreeted and seated with a rose in a quaint booth we were welcomed with water and a warm hello. Offered a predinner drink and warm bread. \n\nWe started with escargot which was served hot and fresh. The table side salad was a real shocker. The salad is an entree in itself. With numerous toppings available the experience of the way its served is memorable. \n\nWe enjoyed the table side flambed duck and filet mignon with shrimp skewer. They were both very delicious. \n\nThe experience in itself made this an extremely memorable dining experience. I would definitely  recommend this restaurant."

            "review": "First of all, this was my first \"Old Vegas\" dining experience and it was fantastic! I had SO much fun. It actually made me wonder why we started to move away from this type of dining. Thank goodness there are still places like this keeping it classic.\n\nThe hotel offers free valet and self-parking (four hours with validation) and it's just a quick walk down Carson to Fremont.\n\nWhen you walk down the stairs from the casino floor, you really feel like you're in a cellar. There's a small lounge/bar area near the host stand. Even if you're here for dinner, I'd recommend some time at the bar with veteran bartender Dean. What a personality! Tell him what you're in the mood for or what you like to drink and he'll make you something new and name it on the spot. Your cocktails also come with their own refills - a beautiful crystal bucket filled with crushed ice and a carafe of whatever you're drinking. I had the Raspberry Lemon Drop and it was great; the right balance of sweet and liquor. Also only at the bar are complimentary mixed nuts, adorable heart-shaped water crackers, and spreads: Chicken Liver Pate and Smoked Cheddar with Bacon and Pimientos. The pate was amazing! I could have sat at the bar all night eating pate and crackers.\n\nIf you're a lady, you receive a fresh red rose prior to seating. They even have vases at each table to place your rose(s) while dining. Then, when you're ready to leave, they wrap the stem in foil to take with you. They do this EVERY DAY! \n\nWant to know what you should eat? Anything that involves table-side service! After all, you're here for the Old Vegas experience. Gosh, it is so much fun. Especially if you have the honor of dining with server extraordinare Victor. He's been here since 1983 and you'd never guess it with the amount of enthusiasm he has for everything! \n\nWe started with the Table-Side Salad (this comes with all entrees or $19 a la carte). The cart has all the salad elements and you tell your server what you'd like and they put it together. If you're with Victor, just have him make your salad. If you're not picky or allergic to anything, tell him to put whatever he wants. It's quite the show and he is extremely entertaining. I had a blast just watching him make the salad! And the salad had EVERYTHING. Romaine lettuce, tomato, red onion, mushroom, anchovies, bay shrimp, marinated artichoke, hearts of palm, hard-boiled egg, parmesan, blue cheese, roasted pine nuts, and croutons. There are three dressings: Caesar, Creamy Pepper, and Honey Orange Walnut Vinaigrette. Victor recommends an unique combination of all three, so of course, I said yes. The salad was delicious. This is a must!\n\nWe shared the Duckling Anise Flamb\u00e9 ($40). The duck is roasted with licorice spices and herbs, then flamb\u00e9ed table-side. More of that table-side action. It's also topped with a Grand Mariner duck confit mandarin orange sauce. Served with wild rice and roasted vegetables. The duck was delicious and I loved the sauce. \n\nAll entrees come with bottled water, assorted breads (cheese-toasted lavosh and rolls) and rose-shaped butter, their famous table-side salad, fruit sorbet as a palate cleanser (we got adorable mini cones topped with lemon sorbet), fresh vegetables, choice of roasted garlic whipped potatoes, red potatoes with parsley, or wild rice, and chocolate-dipped fruit (strawberries, baby figs, and dried apricots). I mean, WOW. \n\nWe finished with Bananas Foster ($18 for 2 people) which is also flamb\u00e9ed table-side. Served with vanilla ice cream in a beautiful goblet and long, slender spoon. YUM.\n\nIt was an amazing meal and even better experience. I really didn't understand the hoopla, but now I get it. Service was IMPECCABLE. Each table has TWO servers and a bus boy. Everyone is so professional, crazily attentive, and importantly, thrilled to be there. Our drinks were never empty, our table was always clean, and one time I didn't even realize I dropped my napkin when I stood up and before I knew it, there was a new, folded napkin waiting for me on the table! By the way, if you weren't impressed enough, all the servers have culinary training for their table-side cooking! I truly cannot wait to come back - no need to wait for a special occasion!\n\nNotes: They tend to get busy every night, so reservations are recommended in advance. It's a popular spot for locals and visitors!"

The women are greeted with a beautiful long stem red rose and you are treated like you are the only people in the restaurant. The food is great, but that is to be expected. The sommelier is knowledgeable and charming. The servers are quick, attentive and unobtrusive. I highly recommend the restaurant. The only criticism I could make is that it can get a little smoky from the casino above. Well worth every penny and will definitely do it again."

Everything is still good, it's just that we can find better places for less money now.\n\nMarch 14, 2016 = Party of 5. I order what I always get, Filet de Boeuf - Atlantis, which is a bacon-wrapped filet served with lump crab and bearnaise sauce. Steak was cooked perfectly & bacon was tasty. I was a little disappointed with the sauce. I got crab meat but not much sauce so everything was dry because of that.\n\nOne thing I can't say anything bad about is their salad. It's made to order & you get tons of choices. I absolutely love it every time. \n\nIf you've never been, I feel like it should be on a list to do. But we've gone multiple times now so the luster has rubbed off."

Then I found Hugo's Cellar, quite by accident. ~ Let me say that this was the BEST meal I have in a long time. \nThe service was exceptional, the food was wonderful. The tabe side salad service and the chocolate dipped strawberry & fig desert was perfect. The prices were a little high, however the dishes came with salad, sorbet, small sides, main course and petit fours. The atmosphere reminded my parents of the old days ~ cozy & quaint, the only thing missing was the \"Rat Pack\". I must say, we were so pleased to find this gem in a downtown casino restaurant. The only other thing I would say is make reservations! \n\nI am so glad I found Hugo's Cellar on Yelp!"

            "review": "I was nervous about finding a nice downtown restaurant.  Everything looked either very old or dirty.  I came across an advertisement in the Las Vegas tour guide for Hugo's Cellar.  It looked like the only decent place to eat, especially after leaving all the good restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip.  Hugo's is located in the basement (cellar) of the Four Queens Hotel.  Once you get through all the smoke and slot machines you are there. \n\nAt the bottom of the stairs the lady is given a red rose.  After receiving the rose you are walked to your seat and the rose is placed in a vase until after your meal.  Your seated in a cellar.  The cellar is surrounded by all red brick walls and pictures.  All employees are wearing suites or tuxedos.  You are immediately served a glass of bottled water, given a menu and list of the specials.  Before you receieve your appetizer and meal, there is a man pushing a salad cart.  He will prepare your salad anyway you like.  After you eat your salad you are given your appetizer and than a small scoop of sherbert.  You receive your meal.  After your meal you are given a desert tray with choclate strawberries and a couple of other delights.  \n\nMust warn you.  Eat slow.  They serve you a tremendous amount of food.  I ordered scallops, which were cooked perfect!  I have never been more happy with any restaurant.  Be prepared.  I never had a to ask for a single thing.    \n\nIf you love wine, they have a huge selection.  Salad, Bottled Water and desert tray is complimentary."

If it were, then it might be pricier than Craft or Cut. \nYou get five star service for a the price of a four star place, and that makes a huge difference on your bill. \nThis means you can splurge a little and get wine or a cocktail, and maybe even a signature dessert. \nThere's a hired wine expert walking around and he answers any questions you may have, or he just pops out of nowhere and gives suggestions on what to drink. Pretty cool. \nLike the wine guy, all the waiters are experienced, personable,and funny. They've all been working there for a looonnng time and probably have some great stories. \nThe food was magnificent and the best part is is that sides and salads come with the meal! The salad is made right in front of you, and it's a yes no process that feels like an interrogation. LOL. \nThe filet mignon was thick n juicy and cooked perfectly. The sides were white asparagus and mashies and tasted fine. \nBecause they bring chocolate dipped fruit after, I decided to try something different and got the kona experience. It looks like a science experiment when they bring it out, but it's basically coffee percolating  in front of you. Kona coffee is some of the best in the world in my opinion, and it tasted divine when it was finished. Pretty cool. If you want a real dessert, then I'd say get the banana foster that's made right in front of you. \nThe service alone is reason enough for me To go back and I love that it didn't break the bank either. \nIt's a gem in the city of sin for sure."

I don't have time to rewrite it this second, but until I get a chance to update my review, just a few words (ok the review ended up longer than I expected, but that's kind of my MO):  \n\nExcellent.  Classic.  Amazing service.  Old-school charm.  Some of the best food I have ever had anywhere in the US or abroad (I had the filet and shrimp aux poivre, the steak was tender, the sauce delightful, the shrimp and steak both perfectly cooked).  The table side salad service was a show in itself - the guy who does it (can't remember his name) was born and raised in Las Vegas and has a wealth of knowledge about its history and funny personal anecdotes to tell if you are the kind of customers who want to hear that stuff (we were!).  It is worth going just to chat with him about old Vegas, Elvis, and the Rat Pack.  The meal and the experience were well worth the price - unlike other places in Vegas the price of your meal includes sides, bread, salad, and dessert (a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries, apricots, and a few other goodies).  You can order a dessert off of the menu, they looked delicious, but we were so full and so satisfied by the complimentary fruit that there was no need.  Drinks were very reasonably priced for a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nOur dinner here was THE HIGHLIGHT OF OUR TRIP to Vegas.  You won't be treated with this kind of sincere, genuine kindness and class anywhere else!  Don't let the old casino's cheesy facade and dated interior fool you, this place is top notch.  The ambiance is completely different once you go down the stairs to Hugo's.  They even give ladies a perfect, long-stemmed red rose upon entering the restaurant.  I felt like a queen when I dined here.  Everyone was so nice and friendly and welcoming - the employees, the other customers, EVERYONE.  It was like something straight out of a movie.\n\nIf you have only one splurge dinner in your budget while you are in Vegas, skip the strip and come here.  Seriously, you won't be disappointed.  They've been in business this long for a good reason."

The ambiance was great the service was outstanding.  Each lady received a long stem rose (which lasted for almost a week.)  The presentation for my martini was perfect.  (It was really a double for only $12).  The second part of the drink was in it's own carafe and in an ice bucket.  The table side salad service was very nice.  The fact that the entrees come with matching sides is appreciated.  \n\nMy actual rating for this restaurant would be 4.5 stars.  That is because the particular entrees that we had (I had the duck--she had the New York) were only good (not WOW).  However, the overall experience was so positive, that we will be back next time we're in Vegas and will try other dishes."

They explain everything to you in detail and also make recommendations. No notepad is needed the waiters remember everything in their heads.\n\nFood also comes out at a good pace, none of those 1 hour waits between appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I dare say after you are finished with your food about 10-15 minutes later the next course arrives.\n\nMy friend and I each ordered the lobster bisque,  plus crab cakes for appetizers, then the seafood combo (crabcake, scallops and salmoln i think) and I forget if I had cheesecake or apple pie. My memory is a little fuzzy.  The food was delicious, but the entree was a tad on the small side for the price.\n\nAlso order the coffee for two, it gets brewed right in front of you in a fancy contraption.\n\nThe meal came out to only 150 before tax and tip.

If you want to step back in time and experience Las Vegas dining before the uber expensive restaurants on the strip started becoming the norm, come here. The restaurant is inside the Four Queens, a few steps down below from the bustling casino floor. \n\nOnce you get to the bottom of the stairs, you are presented with a dim, old school, romantic restaurant. We arrived 30 minutes early, but were seated right away. But before we started walking back to our table, my wife was presented with a very gorgeous long stemmed red rose, quite a nice touch for starting a romantic dinner.\n\nWe started with Hugo's Scampi to share and chose the Chateaubriand and lobster for two for our main course. For some reason, the appetizer took quite some time to come out. A number of servers did apologize a number of times for the wait. We were served our salad a short time later, still waiting on the appetizer. The appetizer showed up right when we finished our salads. The scampi was good, just a little confusing how four shrimp took so long to be served.\n\nOur main course was served a few minutes after our appetizer was delivered. The Chateaubriand and lobster were presented on a large platter table side. The meat is sliced and the lobster removed from its shell. We ordered the chateau medium rare, but it was more towards medium/medium well, almost like it sat under a heat lamp for a little too long? Regardless, it was still tasty, just didn't make quite as big an impression as a chateau usually does.\n\nWe were presented with chocolate covered strawberries after our main course, but were given a small chocolate mousse cake by the chef for our anniversary. A very nice touch and the cake was absolutely delicious. We tried to finish the cake because it was so good, but at that point, we were ready to pass out from the meal. Thank you to the staff who paid attention to my reservation notes."

We had a party of 6 had no problem getting a reservation and when we walked in all the ladies received a rose..aw..The wine menu was extensive and the sommalier was very helpful in choosing a wine for the table.  The menu had many choices we all ordered something a little different and each enjoyed our entrees.  As starters we got escargot and lobster bisquit - they come to your table and make a salad to your liking.  The portions are huge!! and it comes with dessert, chocolate covered strawberries and fruit.  The coffee was a little weak but was served with wipcream, cinnamon sticks and chocolate mint sticks.  We loved our dinner and it was a very old school setting."

Every woman who enters gets a rose from the host.  The table side salad is to die for and I'm not a salad guy.  They basically roll this cart over and you choose the toppings........  Tons of baby shrimp please.....\n\nThe food is wonderful and if you take a date there you'll impress him/her.  You'll also get the old mafioso feeling in the clubby environment."

To begin with, the ambience is very nice and relaxing. The service is top notch. When you order an entr\u00e9e, it automatically comes with a lovely salad that is made at tableside to your liking and then, after your entr\u00e9e, Amuse bouches are served as a dessert and this is complimentary. \nAlong with the bread basket and fresh butter before this, there is really no need to order appetizers or a dessert unless you can pack in a lot of food.\nI have ordered the filet mignon which is outstanding. I have ordered the rack of lamb with Indonesian sauce, which is delicious. I have ordered Hugos chicken, and it is really good. The salad before usually comes with Romain lettuce and occasional combinations, with three choices of dressing including Cesar or ranch, and several vegetables and condiments can be placed on the salad at your request. The salad is always outstanding.\nI have had dessert here for a couple of times and they are delicious, especially the black forest. The Amuse Bouches are chocolate covered strawberries, white chocolate covered figs, and milk chocolate covered apricots with fresh cream in the middle. Absolutely delicious. The coffee, regular, is brought to the table with cinnamon sticks, fresh cream, and any additions that you would like.\nThe price is always affordable for a restaurant of this caliber. Women always get a rose, red and longstem. This is one of the classiest and most romantic restaurants that one can go to, where excellence in food preparation and taste is always right on the money. This is a must!"

We arrived without a reservation and were able to accommodate us immediately. The maitre d' handed the ladies in our party a long stemmed rose and treated us like royalty. Our server, I believe his name was Anthony, was a true professional. He got us all excited about the meal we were about to experience. \n\nOur meal was something that we are still talking about.\n\nit began with cocktails and a salad server arrived with a basket of fresh breads and built our salads tableside. We had over a dozen toppings to choose from and several dressings....so good!\n\nAfter the salad we were served a mini sorbet to cleanse the pallet. I think mine was raspberry and it was so ideal after eating the anchovies in the salad.\n\nJason and I ordered the Chateaubriand for two and lobster tails. it was served with baby new potatoes and fresh spring vegetables. Our chateau was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. It burst with so much flavor that it made us both pause and look at each other with the look of satisfaction, kinda like the look you have after some really good circus style sex. \n\nOur friends ordered the rib eye and they were completely amazed with it! We all said over and over how that meal was the absolute best meal we had all ever had.\n\nWe thought our dinner was over. But, to our surprise \"Anthony came over with an assortment of chocolate dipped fruits (strawberries, figs & apricots) and REAL whipped creme, and the dessert tray. We ordered two desserts from the tray and they were both served with REAL whipped creme and were TO DIE FOR!\n\nDuring dinner we were talking about how we could just feel how good the coffee was going to be and sure enough. The coffee was so yummy!\n\nThe service was IMPECCABLE! We did not want for anything. Several times we commented on how we had NEVER had service like this EVER before, EVER! We felt as if we were waited on hand and foot! Our drinks were never neglected and we did not have to look for our server once. He was there every time we needed him and was not intrusive at all. \n\nWe are going to back to Vegas just to eat here again!\n\nBravo Hugo's Cellar!"

            "review": "I was really looking forward to dining here... If there is one thing I truly don't mind splurging on it is good quality dining. To begin, I loved my long stem rose, traditionally classy. Nice touch. Problem#1: I was looking forward to a glass of wine to find they only have house wines available in glasses. All others are bottle only. That is a bit inconvenient for me, since my bf doesn't drink wine and a bottle would absolutely have me in ruins if I were brave enough to try to drink it alone. But ok, not a huge deal. Problem #2: My bf ordered 12yr or 18yr Jameson whichever they had available. A few moments later he came back with a glass of whiskey on the rocks, and informed us that they only had regular Jameson so that's what he brought out. Yuck. This set the mood for a bit of a disappointment right out of the gate... \nWe ordered our meals and continued our evening festivities without further awkward moments but when the food came out I was left a bit disappointed again. Problem #3: I ordered the rack of lamb, which was actually really tough and not even the slightest tender at all. My bf ordered a steak and after trying a bite it was ok, but not nearly the quality of cut I would expect from such a renowned steak house. The rest of the night was fine. Great service and later the server explained to us that the mix up with the whiskey was that he was not very knowledgeable about the difference between the whiskeys and had been given the drink to serve by the bartender so he simply went with it. Which is understandable. I paid the bill, tipped accordingly regardless and called it a night. The experience was superb as far as service was concerned but the food was more like quality I would expect from somewhere very generic. I've tasted better food at BJ's for 1/4 of the bill. We have been to Joe Vicari's Andiamo at The D casino just around the corner from here and it was by far a better steakhouse by a long shot! Downtown in general has some amazing dining but this place definitely fell short of the list of favorites. Doubt I'll ever be back."

We eat here perhaps twice per year and he remembers our names and the wine we had last visit.\n\nThe evening focuses around the salad cart with over 15 different items  and three home made dressings tossed table side by Victor the salad master.  Thereafter there are the old time standards, rack of lamb, veal oscar, steak diane, etc.\n\nI had the veal oscar with crab , white asparagus and a wine demiglace, it was tender and very good.  My wife had the salad and shrimp cocktail, she wasn't very hungry, it too was nice.  My mother rounded out with the swordfish simply grilled, tender and good.  We chose a very nice, and nicely priced ($65.00) Spanish Cabernet \"2003 Torres\" mas la planta.\n\nYou are served a berry sorbet in a mini waffle cone between courses and finish off with chocolate dipped strawberries  and figs.  Yes, we were stuffed but had the banana's flambe anyway.... a must.\n\nListen to me!!!  If you go to Vegas you MUST come here.

Well Hugo's is the complete opposite of that!  However in this case I just love the old school Vegas feel of the joint.  Low ceilings, brink walls, dim lights...don't care...love it!\n\nFood is really good, not \"Celebrity chef\" great.  I am always comped so value is hard to put a finger on.  All meals come with a made at table salad and with sides included, plus a small dessert at the end.  The size of the meals means that starters or extra desserts are really not needed.  So for $35 to $50 you really get a complete meal.  Based on that I would say value was good.\n\nLOVE the prime rib, bone in strip, rack of lamb and King crab legs.  Other seafood dishes are solid if a little under whelming, all the steaks are prime and it shows.  Made to order salad is great and a mini meal in itself.\n\nSpecial shout out to the Sommelier from England who is just so friendly and very funny.  Tell him what you like and he will find a great bottle for you.  He always has a bottle of Kim Crawford out that back for us.  Love it!"

We were a bit skeptical based on its location, but our fears were quicly calmed---great place!\n\nWe arrived a few minutes early, but were quickly seated...and just like previous posts indicate, I was given a long stemmed red rose upon entry. The ambiance is old school, dark steakhouse, but very romantic.\nWe had the fabulous salad cart as our appetizer...I had caesar, and the hubby had a sweet walnut vinaigrette. Both were outstanding---shrimp, egg, croutons, peeled tomatoes, fresh mushrooms, and loads of parmesan cheese were at the ready. The cocktails were great---I had a martini that really was like having 3--one glass, then they gave me an individual carafe on ice to refill my glass as I needed. Bread basket had a nice variety of breads, but we were partial to the house special cheese lavosh--yummy! For entrees, the hubby had the 16 oz ribeye, cooked to perfection. I had the filet Atlantis--a succulent beef filet (huge!) bacon wrapped, served over lump crab meat with bernaise on the side. It was like butter! We enjoyed the chocolate dipped fruit tray, and also tried a chocolate almond cheesecake---so full! The coffee was excellent, and came with neat little goodies--cinnamon sticks, and chocolate mint swirl sticks.\n\nWe also had Anthony as our server--one of the very few true local Vegas people in town! He was very personable and professional... he had a great helper named Eric who was very attentive, and excellent at making sure we were happy all evening. What a great value for 2!!!! Our bill came to $144--that included 4 premium cocktails (grey goose and bacardi), coffee, salads for each of us, 2 desserts and 2 beef entrees with potatoes and veggies---4 premium beverages on the strip alone would be $50 bucks, the steaks would be at least $50 bucks each, plus salads at $12 bucks each, then desserts @ 9 dollars each, not to mention that each potato and veggie side would be  about $9 bucks a piece, then add the coffee..well over $220 bucks! We had a great experience, and will definitely return!!!"

This is old school Vegas, baby, and don't forget it. Hugo's is situated within the bowels of the Four Queens casino, located smack dab in the middle of the Fremont Street \"Experience.\" The Four Queens is a retro-New Orleans style place. No need for pirate ships, mock Parisian towers and the like - gambling is the focus here with good food (at Hugo's) an added benefit. \n\nOnce you make your way past the slots, check-in area, and cashier, you walk down a set of stairs to Hugo's. It is a throwback to another time - red brick walls, large hair on the hostesses, and lots of flambe-food prepared tableside. I arrived an HOUR early (my fault - I'd driven in from Utah and didn't set my watch back an hour) and had to wait at the small bar area. The bartender brought me a portion of pate which was nice. I finally sat down for dinner which was very good - but not great. \n\nGood things about Hugo's Cellar:\n- Retro Vegas subterranean fern bar decor;\n- Good wine cellar with selection of half bottles;\n- Delicious Filet and Shrimp aux Poivre;\n- Hugo's Tableside Salad - you get to pick the stuff!\n- Cheese Lavosh! (kosher?)\n\nBad things about Hugo's Cellar:\n- Need a guide with GPS to find the place in the hotel;\n- Elderly hostesses seem a bit 'uncaring;'\n- Side dishes bland;\n- Service efficient but impersonal;\n- Valet parking pretty slow.\n\nI'd go back to Hugo's Cellar if I wanted a 'break' from the mega-restaurants on the Strip that are named after famous chefs (who rarely, if ever, cook in their kitchens). I'm glad I found Hugo's on Chowhound - I think it is normally 'locals only'. Worth checking out. Major yang decor with low fu design. Wear a tux with ruffled baby blue shirt to feel 'connected' to ghosts past in this place. Check it out. 4 stars."

            "review": "4.5 Stars... Really, really good, but not *quite* \"as good as it gets\" because of a few small flaws which may have been flukes.  (Plus if I leave an empty star spot, my boyfriend whose favorite place in the world this is may take me back again to try it again in hopes of me being able to up my review, teehee!)\n\nWe came on a date here on our first trip to Vegas together, and it was an amazing experience all around.    We had reservations so when we arrived we were promptly seated after my being greeted with a long stem red rose (which they do for all their women guests).  It's located beneath the  Four Queens Casino, and it's fun and a bit impressing to walk down the steps out of the noisy casino into the relative calm of the restaurant.   The atmosphere is dark, elegant, romantic, and classic feeling. \n\nThe service was top-notch:  friendly, personable, just the right amount of refined to make you feel like you're eating somewhere fancy but not so much that you feel they're talking down to you, and on top of their game from start to finish.   The sommelier  was the same one that boyfriend remembers seeing when he came with his parents in his youth.   He was very nice and knowledgeable so I really hate to say this, but he ultimately ended up steering us into an off-menu wine that we *liked* but didn't *love* and that was significantly more expensive than the wines we had been looking at.   That's part of the missing half-star.\n\nIt was my first table-side custom salad experience and I am now sold on it and think every restaurant should have one.  I ended up with a bed of greens topped with shrimp, hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, pickled red onion, blue cheese, pine nuts, caesar dressing, and parmesan.   There were lots of other toppings that I passed on, but I don't remember what they were - sorry.  I just remember these because it surprisingly ended up being one of the best salads I've eaten and I've duplicated it at home several times now.\n\nWe ordered the Escargot as a starter, and it was melt in your mouth delicious. I love that they served it in an escargot dish surrounded by the perfect amount of sauce with the puffed pastry on top.  It made for a much cleaner presentation and easier to eat, rather than having to fish around in a sea of butter to fish out what may be a mushroom or an escargot.  Easier for those who are slightly squeamish about the idea of eating snails too:  less interaction and more enjoying the flavors.  This dish was beautifully balanced, light, savory, and just perfection.\n\nFor our entrees we ordered the New York Strip, and the Rack of Lamb (and we split them).  The portions were generous and they both came with large sides of beautifully cooked vegetables and creamy mashed potatoes.  The rack of lamb was cooked to perfection and was such a treat.  I loved the Indonesian style sauce that came with it, but the boyfriend preferred it without - which was fine because the sauce was on the side.  I would definitely order this dish again and highly recommend it.    The New York steak was good - very good, but this is where it fell a bit flat for me.  I have to admit here that I've had better steaks that I've made at home - mind you, I've made some VERY NICE prime steaks at home so I'm a pretty hard sell.  Don't get me wrong, It was very good but not quite as good as it gets, so this is the other fraction of a missing star.  I did enjoy every bite of it (eventually, bc there were tons of leftovers lol).  NEXT TIME I plan on ordering the duck - apparently that's all they served when it first opened and everything else has been added over the years, so I'm betting they've got that down to perfection by now.  (And the boyfriend is going to order the lamb again and I'm going to make him share it with me.)\n\nAfter the meal they brought out a plate of complementary chocolate dipped fruits which was a very pleasant surprise and also the perfect 'little bit of something sweet but not too heavy because I just pigged-da'hell-out' end to the meal.\n\nAll in all it was one of the favorite meals I've ever eaten. If I was reviewing a less expensive restaurant it would definitely be five stars - but given its price level my expectations are extremely high.  Even so, it only fell the teeniest bit short of absolute perfection and I can't wait to come back and have a 5th star wooed out of me.  :)"

This was recommended by multiple people for where my husband and I to go for our anniversary. First thing is that the host was very nice n the rose was beautiful. But this point on in the evening was not so beautiful. We sat at our table for 10min before anyone came over to us. Most places ask if we have ever eaten there n introduce or give suggestions - none was done. Both of our servers had no personality at all. When we ordered I know you get to choose your sides and server just walked away before I could say. My husband n I both ordered filet n shrimp. We ordered our filets medium. I know meat shrinks but this came out half the size of a card deck and the 3 shrimp were very small. The whole plate was covered in this sauce/ gravy. We had the crab cakes that were decent. Bananas foster for dessert- it was so so;( I know the restaurant is old in a casino but if you don't like the constant smell of cigarette smoke like me, you will not enjoy smelling it while you eat . Our main meals was not worth $58 each...We had one app to share n dessert . No wine or alcohol... Our bill was $200. If the food was great or service was great I wouldn't mind the price but Neither was good that we would ever come back or suggest this place to anyone!"

            "review": "So today's adventure found us headed to Vegas and looking for a good spot for dinner. Leave it to our VP Jeff who lived in Vegas for many years suggesting a very nostalgic spot known as Hugos Cellar in the Four Queens.  He was looking for a place that still maintained a Rat Pack feel to it and we definitely found that at Hugo's this evening.\n\nThe restaurant truly is located in the cellar of the Four Queens and the second you descend the stairs into Hugo's reception area, it feels like you're walking into a set of a very dark and broody dinner scene of a Coppola movie.  They do give the ladies in your party roses and I'm not quite sure if that makes it romantic or just a little creepy, which isn't so bad either--if you're into creepy. :)\n\nWe had reservations for 9pm, arrived a few minutes early and were seated without waiting at all.  Host and servers were very friendly and seemed to be on their games--especially Michael, our salad and dessert chef.  Unfortunately, although coming across as very professional, our waiter on the other hand, was very slow and not very attentive.  Drinks took forever and it was another HOUR before we were even asked for the next round.  Appetizers were delicious but so slow to get to the table.  We even had to ask to put our orders in because we were never prompted to in that first hour.  Our entrees didn't arrive until almost 1 hour and 25 minutes later 5 minutes before they closed.  We had an upset table to say the least.\n\nOnce our dinners arrived, the mood began to lighten because of the quality and presentation of every dish.  My NY steak was done PERFECTLY medium and was incredibly tender and perfectly seasoned.  I ordered it with the au poivre sauce that needed just a smidgen of salt but after that was pure heaven.   I went with the red potatoes and steamed vegetables as my sides and they came out still retaining their crispness and wonderfully moist.  \n\nAfter that meal you have no idea how much it pains me to give it three stars but the waiting was handled so miserably that I just have to deduct two stars for it.  \n\nHugo, please read this and make these errors right in the future.  I would love to give you another try, but unless there's some assurance it's been addressed, I'm back to the strip to my regular steak places....."

The crab was tender and they didn't jip us on the crab meat! Just enough without taking away from the taste of the dip. The salad is great! I had the creamy pepper dressing (similar to ranch) and it was delicious. Made to your liking... awesome! By the time our actual entree came we were ready! I had the Veal Oscar which is perfection. If you like veal or want to try it, get this dish! Also, your meal comes with chocolate dipped fruit, and IT IS GOOD. But if you are too much like me and my boyfriend you'll get a cheesecake to send you over the edge! Absolutely delicious and creamy.\n\nOur drinks were great, they even serve you a whole drink and pour it in the rocks for you so you're actually getting enough alcohol. Hard to find in Las Vegas.\n\nThe presentation of everything is divine. A rose for every Lady to put on your table. The servers and wait staff are extremely pleasant. Oscar and Carlos were wonderful they really are a great representation of this restaurant.\n\nWould absolutely recommend this place over and over again. Loved every minute of it. A great meal and beautiful ambiance, the Old Las Vegas feel is all over this great underground nook.\n\nGreat for date night or even a girl's night! Love this place!"

Screw those guys.\n\nFlash forward to our next night's meal at Hugo's: a classy (70s Vegas classy), pampered evening where we ate the best food of our lives.\n\nLadies get a rose at the door, the youngest waitstaff have been there for 10 years (some of the guys have been there for 20). You get warmed hand towels, sorbet to cleanse your palette, salads are served up at your table...and the meat--oh the meat--is some of the best I've ever had in my life. I've heard they have an amazing wine selection as well, but we chose to go with some of their martinis which were to die for and plentiful. Sure it's $14 a martini, but they give you a carafe with the extra from the shaker so really you're getting 3 drinks for that price.\n\nLocated in the cellar of the Four Queens Hotel on Fremont Street this place screams Old-school Vegas. I was channeling Sharon Stone in Casino the whole time. \n\nNo nickle-and-dime---you pay heartily, but you get a lot. It's worth every penny for the ambiance alone. Love it!"

Quickly the seasoned veteran servers began their well rehearsed procession of drink orders, sommelier service and menu consultation. \n\nOne of only a few restaurants that dares to serve French Bordeaux I'd give Hugo's 5 star just for that! Our Martini was served up in a large carafe in a chilled bucket and I'm pretty sure the phrase \"three martini lunch\" was coined here.\n\nThe food: Excellent all around. A little too much butter for our diets but expected.\n\nThe most remarkable about our evening at Hugo's was the service. We felt as if dining at a friend's home, never rushed or bothered with constant \"how is everything.\" The table-side salad server had been there for 31 years, the sommelier 14 years and all others so kind and welcoming, professional on a level to best those at the Wynn!"

Before you get your main course they bring you a small ice cream cone of raspberry sorbet to cleanse your palate. It was soooo good, so I ate the entire thing haha. Who doesn't love desert before dinner? I ordered the Filet Mignon and my husband had the Rib-eye.

The sizzling platter of chicken shrimp tuna and filet that you make yourself is the most unique experience I have had while dining. That is just an appetizer, the real treat is the tableside salad with many ingredients to choose from with choice of incredible dressing. The NY strip is just delicious. The meal is completed by a chocolate display of figs and apricots and strawberries. One must experience Hugos for true dining"

I've celebrated birthdays, dinner before the bachelor party, night out with the guys, and perfect dinner with just the wife. They start with a salad made table side (even have anchovies if you request for them). Escargot is our favorite appetizer. The quality of the Entrees and sides are first class. At the end they give you chocolate dipped fruit and freshly whipped cream. \n\nService is always top notch from the time you arrive until the time you leave. I have recommended Hugo's to everyone that goes to Vegas and no one has been disappointed."

All the times I've been to Vegas, I would have never considered dinner Downtown, but I was game. We called ahead to find out if we could bring wine, and as long as it wasn't on their list, the corkage was only $10. Walking in to the Four Queens is like going back in time to the days of Old Las Vegas. The smoke filled casino was crowded with cowboys in town for the Rodeo, so all the employees were dressed in western gear.  That is until we walked down the stairs into Hugo's Cellar. Talk about Old School Steakhouses. All the waiters were dressed in tuxedos and the dark space was reminiscent of days gone by.\n\nThe minute we walked in the room we were greeted by the hostess who handed me and my girlfriend a red rose. Our husbands were already impressed. When we sat at our corner table, they provided us with a vase for our flowers so they stayed fresh. The waiters were all very helpful, friendly and well informed, and the sommelier certainly knew his wines. Surprisingly one of the obsure bottles we brought with us was on their list, so we chose not to pay the exhorbitant corkage for that one. To say their wine list was impressive would be an understatement.  We all ordered steaks, which came with the salad cart and sides. Everything was absolutely delicious. The 3\" thick filet mignon was almost tender enough to cut with a fork.  I chose the gorgonzola sauce to go on top, but to be honest the steak didn't need anything to make it better. My suggestion is to skip the sauces and dig right into the prime beef.  We skipped dessert, although their list looked great. However we got chocolate covered strawberries as our final course, which were very tasty.\n\nAll in all we really enjoyed Hugo's Cellar and would definitely recommend it to anyone taking the time to head Downtown instead of staying on The Strip."

It's miles apart from the noisy, packed casino floor.  It's more like the old school top notch Vegas restaurant, not a chain, outstanding steaks, service and ambiance.  I was not dressed in a suit, but was not treated any differently because of it.  The salad table-side was wonderful, and my steak and shrimp combination outstanding. The whole experience was one I recommend. Too many of the Vegas restaurants are chains, over priced and cater to well-heeled tourists. I would imagine that this hidden gem has been here for years and will be here for years to come.  Don't let the low budget tourists on Fremont Street deter you."

We had about three different waiters helping us and each one was so nice and clearly put service first.  We had the crab cake appetizer which was amazing.  The salad that each meal comes with was one of the best parts.  They make the salad tableside individually for each guest.  There are many toppings to choose from or have them all.  My boyfriend doesn't like salad dressing so they offered to freshly squeeze lemons onto his salad, he loved it.  \n\nFor the meal I got the filet mingon with bernaise sauce.  It was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever had.  The bf had the beef wellington which was also amazing.  Even the masked potatos and veggies that it comes with are great.  They brought a hot towel to wash your hands with before dessert.  Then dessert is a complementary chocolate dipped dried apricot, fig, and strawberry.  One of each for each guest.  And fresh whipped cream.  It was so good.  We will definitely be back here.  It is also perfect for a special occasion."

The restaurant is in an unusual lower part of The 4 Queens Hotel which does kinda feel like your in a cellar.  We had a booth along the wall.  The service was top notch from the beginning to the end.  We had a busser that brought bread and water, a server that took our order, a man that had a rolling salad bar that had tons of goodies to choose from that he made at your table.  I ordered the bacon wrapped 10 ounce filet and crab, I talked my husband in to the Chilean Sea Bass.  Both entrees were served piping hot and they were delicious and cooked perfectly.  The portions were huge on the fish and the steak was def at least 10 ounces.  Both our sides came with the entree and both were very good, I had garlic mashed and he had rice.  My glass of wine was very reasonable at $6 a glass.  The best part though was my husband ordered a martini and it came and included a crystal ice bucket to hold part of the martini and keep it cold..  REALLY IMPRESSIVE idea (we think any way :))! With the meal, they included chocolate covered strawberries and figs, that was a nice touch..  We both had an entree, I had one wine and he had 2 martinis, our bill without tip was $149, which I felt was fair for the level of service and all the little extras we seemed to enjoy.  Def not somewhere you'd probably go once a month but I saw a lot of folks celebrating anniversaries, great place for special occasions.   I would have given it 5 stars had the bathroom not been FOREVER away... this type of establishment should have its own restroom but it is old and space is limited so I doubt it's an option."

While the entr\u00e9e seems to be a bit pricy (around 50), it comes with delicious bread, customized salad and dessert, which usually cost around 10 to 20 dollars at other restaurants.

            "review": "\"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.\" - Steve Jobs \n\nThis was my third visit to Hugo's Cellar. I first came to Hugo's back in 1994 for my Junior Prom in high school. I came back a few years later around the turn of the millennium. This final visit was with my love and a couple of our best friends, as we needed a place to eat before seeing the Las Vegas Philharmonic at the Smith Center and felt like the charm of Hugo's might go nice with the evening. \"Old School\" comes up in 92 other reviews...for good reason...this most recent experience matched my old memories of Hugo's pretty well. In fact, as we spoke to Gene the salad guy and John the sommelier, I realized that some of the staff had been there for all three of my visits.\n\nYou come to Hugo's for a different feel. This is a traditional steakhouse, void of modern nuances, but with character and flair of a different era. Hugo's is a traditional place, especially for those of us born from the late 60s to the early 80's, because it has held fast to elements of charm and service that are unique. At Hugo's you will find a sommelier with wit and charisma in John, table-side salad from the refined skills of Gene, and service that continues to impress in yesteryear kind of way...such as raspberry sorbet from a miniature cone and table-side Cherries Jubilee for dessert. \n\nYou can easily enjoy better food in Vegas at this price point, but it won't come with the same feel. Hugo's has a classier feel than old-school counterpart Golden Steer, and is significantly better than the other old Vegas classic that is Pamplemousse Le Restaurant."

It was our first visit to the Cellar and it was a wonderful place for an old style Vegas meal.  Each of wives was presented a rose when we arrived.  Our salads were prepared individually table side - I did not know places still do that.  We are non drinks so we did not have that service. The prime rib was delicious. The table service was good. The after dinner chocolate tray was good. Our friends were happy with the meal and so were we."

This place was recommended by a friend who ventures to Vegas quite often and suggested it as one of our splurge evenings.  And splurge we did...\n\nHow classic to offer every lady a rose as we walk in the door, an add on that made me giddy and smiley the minute I walked in the door.  It makes a lady feel special.  The menu is Old World Steakhouse, no surprises here, steak, seafood, salads and everything you would expect from a Steakhouse.\n\nThe choice for the evening:\n\nTable-side Salad - romaine lettuce, peeled tomato wedges, marinated artichokes, sliced mushrooms, blue cheese crumbles, toasted croutons, crushed eggs, red onions and bay shrimp.  \n\nEscargot En Croute - Six plump escargots sauteed in shallots, garlic, burgundy wine, fine herbs and topped with puff pastry.\n\nPalate Cleanser - Raspberry Sorbet - A refreshing sorbet before steak time!\n\nFilet de Boeuf - Atlantis - A ten ounce filet wrapped in bacon served on a bed of lump crab with Bearnaise sauce.\n\nIncluded dessert - Chocolate covered fruit, strawberries, figs, and apricots.\n\nThe table side salad was a fun experience. A sweet man presents himself with a cart full of fresh ingredients and asks how you want your custom salad.  He makes your salad with flare and finesse.  The honey walnut vinaigrette was unique and gave a kick to the exceptional salad.  \n\nMy first experience with Escargot and I have to say, may I have another.  I always thought Escargot would be gross which is a total error on my part, they were salty, rich and buttery.  A squeeze of lemon and I was in utter heaven.  Jenn + Escargot = Happiness.  Now if only I had someone feeding them to me...\n\nThe Filet de Boeuf was cooked to my requested temperature, medium with crispy bacon encrusting the outside.  A ten oz. filet is a huge portion and I was pleased to take each succulent bite and sop up the Bearnaise sauce on the way to my mouth.  The crab claws were buttery and cooked nicely and I loved sucking every last drop from each claw (sorry, no picture of this, I know you want one).  A menu doesn't need to be complicated when you can execute a steak this perfect with the right amount of seasoning.\n\nYour meal comes with chocolate dipped fruit, which we took to go since we were both stuffed with the best steak of our lives.  If you so desire, you may order additional desserts, one of which is Banana's Foster flamb\u00e9ed table-side.  If I was hungry, this would have been my additional dessert of the night.\n\nService was impeccable and I wanted for nothing the entire evening.  My mind was read without me knowing it.  Dinner was paced well and everyone was attentive to our needs at every turn.  Well worth the splurge anytime."

He told me to drive safe and we will see you soon. The place itself is beautiful with an old school charm. It's classy and welcoming. They give the ladies a rose as soon as you enter and then walk you to your table. \n\nService was great. Honestly its the best service I have ever experienced. You start out with their bread basket with butter designed into a shape of a rose. It was very pretty and the bread was fresh and warm. You ordered then the salad bar would come to you. The guy made our salads to order right in front of us. He had it down. He went through the toppings while having a full conversation with us and he never missed a beat. The salad was fabulous and my husband ate all of it if that says anything.  He is a meat and potatoes kind of guy.  \n\nOur entree's were so delicious. I had the Beef Wellington and my husband had a steak as well.  Mine was like cutting into heaven. It was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. My husband loved his steak as well. Served with mashed potatoes and a vegetable melody, it was all very very good. \n\nOur complementary dessert was chocolate covered figs and strawberries with some whipped cream. I was completely stuffed by then. Our waiter mentioned to the Chef that it was our Wedding night so they sent us out a lava cake! I was so surprised by this. It was so good. Words seriously can not describe how delicious this was. They packed our left overs and put them in a nice bag to go for us. I ate my steak the next morning for breakfast and it still was like heaven. \n\nI hated leaving here because it was such a beautiful night and everything was so delicious. It was the perfect way to start out our first night together as a married couple. I cannot recommend this place enough. We will forever put this on our list of places to eat when we are in Vegas.\n\nSide note: Every employee we spoke with has been working there for years. I'm not talking like 3 years or so. The least amount of time there I heard was 7 years. They joked around and called him a young pup. Our waiter had been there for 30 plus years! It was his anniversary and he said they took very good care of him. I love hearing about places who take care of their employees."

First of all the hostess seem perturbed when I showed up a half-hour early and told her that our reservation is minus one.  She seemed even more perturbed when I came back and said we are now up to our original number which was 7.  You think this is the first time in Vegas history that a group has shrunk because someone wanted to keep chasing their money and then thought better of it?  We still had 7 people ready to drop some cash.  Anyway, they seat us on time which is the last positive thing I'll say in this review.  After sitting down it takes around 10 minutes to order our drinks and when we ask to order wine they won't let us until the wine steward comes over.  After another 10 minutes the steward comes to our table and tells he'll be right back.  That was the last we saw of him.  By this time almost 30 minutes has expired and we haven't even ordered appetizers.  (One importnt warning to others, the pricing designation you see is not even close.  All steaks were in the $50 range with the cheapest thing on the menu being chicken for $36.)  Look I live in LA and I've dined at plenty of expensive restaurants but for these prices I expect more than a dining room in need of a serious remodel and service that  wouldn't even cut it in the islands.   The service had this forced formality that became comical after a while.  When they brought us the bread basket they acted like they were presenting us the damn Hope Diamond.  Finally, after 30 minutes of not seeing our original waiter or the wine steward we got up and left.  We politely told the hostess what happened and she seemed unconcerned.  Honestly, I was glad she didn't try to talk us into staying because it wasn't happening.   Obviously, I can't speak to the food but for the prices and level of service there are HUNDREDS of places in LV that are a lot better.  I'm sincerely glad others enjoyed it.  I get that places have bad nights but life is too short for another try."

Tucked underneath the Four Queens Hotel in downtown Las Vegas, this place is the ultimate old school \"wine and dine\" your woman joint (complete with a complimentary rose for the lady).  One of the things I like most about this place is that you actually have a snowflakes chance in hell of bringing your own wine to enjoy here (as long as you're cool to the sommelier and don't make a scene about it).  No chance of doing this on the Strip.\n\nDid I mention \"old school\"?  They bring the salad cart to the table and prepare it a la Lawry's style right in front of you.  Beware of eating too much of this as it's definitely a meal in itself.  The steaks here are aged just right and don't disappoint.  The lamb is excellent as well.  I tried a bite of the sea bass once and it was pretty damn good.  The service is impressive and don't be surprised if you get someone who's practically lived and worked there his entire life.  It's really cozy (get a booth), schedule plenty of time here to relax and enjoy your meal, and get to know your server as they have all sorts of stories to share w/ you if you wish.  Definitely an older crowd plus a lot of regulars so if you want glam, stick to the Strip....but if you want a unique old school Vegas experience, this is definitely it.\n\nPricing is what you'd expect for LV but maybe a little cheaper.  Make a reservation in advance for sure, especially if you're coming from the Strip.  Nothing sucks worse than paying taxi fare only to find you're paying another taxi the same on the way back hungry."

Sure you might be able to find a better steak, but you will never be able to match the price, atmosphere, and quality that you get at Hugo's Cellar.\n\nTo start, $40-50 a plate might seem pretty expensive and is what you will pay for a steak on the strip, but the price includes a salad, sorbet, starch, vegetables, and chocolate dipped fruit.  Try packing all this in on the strip where everything is al a carte and you'll easily be running around $75+ a plate for the same quality.  \n\nTo top it all off, the atomsphere at Hugo's is like taking a step back in time into an older, classier Vegas.  From the indulgent menu, to the waitstaff, to the decor of the cellar, it feels like you've taken a step back in time to Old School Frank/Sinatra Rat Pack Vegas.   If you can get over that it's in the Four Queens, this will surely be a place for you.  \n\nI've been here every year for the past 6 years on dates, family celebrations, and just for a good meal.  The waitstaff are always the same career waiters, the service is always attentive and friendly, and the food is always incredibly delicous and bountiful.  It's really the only reason I even make a trip to downtown Vegas, but I'm always glad I do.   \n\nCome here if you are in the mood for a classy environment, an old school vibe, and a fantastic meal at a great price.

This is always my family go to place and where we bring out of towners for a nice dinner.\nWe used to frequent the Burgundy Room before they closed but Hugos does not disappoint! Great place for a romantic date, celebration dinner, or just a nice night out.\nWomen are always presented with a rose on entry which is a very nice touch. If you're drinking wine, you have a sommelier with a tastevin to taste the wine before you drink it. You have a salad cart that comes around and you are able to pick all the toppings you want along with dressing before they toss it for you.\nThe meal is always outstanding. Steaks and chicken always have great flavor and are cooked to perfection.\nAfter your meal you are given chocolate dipped fruits for a final touch.\nIf you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor!"

After asking the waiter how to order the steak for it to be pink we were told medium. The medium ribeye came with no pink.  We sent it back and the waiter rudely asked if anyone else had a problem with their food. He said he took it off the bill as we didn't want to order something else at that point.  The bill came with a $19 charge for the salad that came with the meal.  When the manager was called over he told us it was because she ate the salad. Really?   Salad that comes included with the meal is $19 when your steak is over cooked???  And the manager argued with us when we said we didn't feel we should pay $19 for the salad.  Eventually he agreed to take the salad off the bill but as he walked away he said \"really\"?   I have never been treated so poorly in such a beautiful restaurant.   What a shame."

Your greeted at the entrance with a long stem red rose ..you're seated and they have a vase for you to hold your rose until you leave. You get a taste of some breads.. and the butter is shaped like a rose!! They keep your water and drinks full all the time. The staff here is amazing!!!! So nice and constant watching your table. It's pricey!! But so worth the special night.  They pull out a salad cart and make your salad table side. I loved it!! After your salad they bring u some sorbet to cleanse your palate and a hot napkin for your hands. My friend had lamb and his wife had steak and shrimp it comes with garlic red potatoes asparagus and rice . When the plates are placed before you,, you will want to get your camera!! not only is it delicious!  the presentation is gorgeous.your dessert is included it's chocolate. Dip figs strawberries This a place to go . And very candle lit . Sorta under ground. You won't be disappointed here :)"

I enjoy food, and sometimes the sweet and savory dishes I am craving are not offered in the same place. So, last night, I was excited to eat Hugo's heavenly Banana's Foster after my meal. I had talked up this dessert and this restaurant to my girlfriend, and she was excited to see what all the fuss was about. We drove across town specifically to come to Hugo's Cellar and enjoy some wine and dessert. However, after being seated and taking our order, a manager-looking guy comes over saying that they do not serve dessert only and that we had to either order an appetizer or go find room at the bar... um... ok... I brushed it off and said \"oh no problem, we'll order an appetizer.\" After we ordering our appetizer, they come over with the Banana's Foster. Confused, I ask \"is that for us?\" and the server says \"yes.\" But you guys made us order an appetizer???? The server says \"Oh you wanted the appetizer first?\" (really???), ok so he takes back the dessert and brings out the appetizer. We're not even done eating the appetizer when another guy comes over asking if he can take it away. I let him know that I am still working on it. They just keep making us feel uncomfortable. We felt rushed. As far as I could tell there was no one waiting to be seated, plenty of empty tables, what's the rush???  I mean it's not like we came for the free bread! We ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer (THAT YOU FORCED ON US), and dessert... what the hell??? When we finally get our dessert, we are not even two bites into it when they bring the check and return back trying to cash us out. Are you serious??? At that point we were just like \"ok, we get it, you're trying to get rid of us, here's our card.\" It's not even like the restaurant was full! It's ok if you don't want clients coming to just get dessert, that's fine. But man, they could have handled that much better! I was mortified that I talked my friend into coming to eat here, and then get treated this way. There are many places to get a great meal in Vegas, ones that don't require walking through a seedy area of town, to pay big bucks, and be treated badly."

It's in the Four Queens which meant we had to walk through a huge line waiting for the $7.99 Prime Rib at the restaurant next door.  This should have been my first clue this wouldn't be the steak I was looking for.  The atmosphere is very old school and probably good for your parents anniversary but not great if you're under 40.  But I was here for the meat so it wasn't really an issue.  The first problem though was the beer list wasn't very extensive (mostly domestics) and the server didn't know much about the imports.  My buddy ended end with a wheat beer with apple flavor which was not something he wanted.  Mine was a Samuel Smith Pale Ale which was quite good.  I ordered a medium rare New York Strip with a warm center and a crisp exterior and my friend tried the salmon.  First was a salad they prepare table side but it lacked flavor.  The steak was a little better but still not the mind blowing experience I was looking for at $50 a steak.  The salmon was also run of the mill."

You could be if you came to Hugo's Cellar. \n\nThe Four Queens in located downtown and not in the best of areas. We pulled up to the valet and no one was there to greet us. We waited a while for someone to finally show up to park the car but thats another story. Hugo's is located in the center of the old casino, down stairs. It is downstairs and dimly lit. A classic old  Vegas style steakhouse. \n\nWe were greeted by the Matre'D and seated in a half booth in the back. Our waiter arrived quickly to greet us and take our drink orders. After that, we didn't see much of him. He did return for our entree orders and then not again until we were finished with our food. I loved the salad cart. You are able to customize your salad with several different items and dressings. The person making the salad will ask what dressing you want and then go through all the toppings. The salad was excellent. \n\nFor our entrees we chose the prime rib and the rib eye. They were both good,  but nothing I can't find at any other steakhouse without having to deal with downtown. We had the chocolate lava cake for dessert which was good. \n\nI didn't find it as great as others, but I have been to a lot of great steakhouses. There is no reason to go out of your way to go downtown if your just looking a great steak dinner or romantic evening out."

It would be endless amount if text to read, so let me try to shorten this review.\n\nI've known of this restaurant for years, but never eaten here. tonight I finally remembered about it and off we went.\n\nFirst, you wouldn't know this place existed unless you probably heard about it word of mouth. If you follow my reviews, have some extra bucks to spend, treat yourself to this luxury, superb meal. You will not be disappointed.\n\nSecond, decor. Once you make your way through the smoke filled casino and hundreds of gambling lunatics, you'll find yourself either tip toeing down a small flight if stairs or taking the elevator one short level down to this dim lit, classic feel entrance where you'll be instantly greeted by multiple service people. From there you just wait to be seated. Once you get taken in, you'll enjoy the classic, wooden, dark coat feel the place has, along with clean patrons and great smelling food. you'll walk by a walk in wine cellar that is fully stocked, amongst a sea of tables that aren't on top of each other, I would say perfectly spaced out, then you reach your destination.\n\nI would suggest to instantly ask what the market price is for the king crab. it should average between $90-$105 for the 1lb dinner. \n\nI had ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, wrapped with bacon. also ordered the spinach artichoke dip...let's get on to the food...\n\nfirst up was wine list. I find myself now looking for some Opus One, which they had 2011 vintage @ $395. Great pairing with dinner, but I wanted 2013 so I passed on the wine. they have a wine handler though that handles any request you might have pertaining to the wine and champagne. pretty awesome.\n\nThe spinach dip came quickly. real fresh and delicious, pouring over the bowl it was in. the flavor of the dip was great. had a good taste of cheese with the mixture of the artichoke and spinach. very good.\n\nnext came our table side salad. you choose the ingredients you want on your salad, where it's then tossed in front of you with your choice of dressing. again a perfect salad. reminds me of a mix of Lawry's spinning bowl salad with no spin and table side guacamole you would order at a Mexican restaurant. salad was great. no issues there.\n\nnext, the waiter handed us lemon sorbet ice cream. this made me chuckle. he said it prepares the pallet for taste. how fancy is that!\n\nso after the dip, salad and sorbet the filet arrived and I was very happy with it. it kind of looked like a baseball steak with how big it was, but it was all filet mignon, wrapped with a juicy slice of bacon..can't go wrong. when I cut into this meat I couldn't believe how perfect it was cooked. the outline of the cook compared to the red was flawless. Once I dove in, I just kept going at it non stop until I hit something...a bunch of crab meat! I completely forgot there was crab stuffed into the meat! was like getting a little bonus for eating this delicious steak.\n\nafter the dinner, your treated to more goodies. a chocolate dipped strawberry with some dipped fruit. then they offer you dessert, but it's not needed. you should be completely satisfied by meals end.\n\nlook, once I finished what I could, I was left fully satisfied, 10/10, no complaints at all...and I tried to keep this short with this review.\n\nall of the staff is ultra friendly and courteous from the hostess to the servers to the runners. no issues at all with them.\n\ncheck out the picture. I don't usually take photos but this dish deserved to be archived with the rest of the photos on here to show what this place has to offer."

My boyfriend had ordered a McCallan 12 year on the rocks and when they brought out the glass, it was FULL! Like when you order a water or soda type of full loll \n\nWe ordered the seafood platter for two as an appetizer. It came with Alaskan king crab, poached lobster medallions, and jumbo shrimp. They bring out two sauces and the yellow one was more delish imho. After this, they brought over a table side salad bar and the waiter makes it for you right then and there. We had a guy named Victor and he was very entertaining. After all this, we were brought raspberry sorbets to help cleanse our pallets. I had gotten the 16 ounce ribeye and the boyfriend got the 16 ounce new York strip. They both melt in your mouth.\nThey also bring out complementary dessert- chocolate covered strawberries, figs, and apricots. All good!

They do a cool made to order salad at your table and the waiter doing it really seemed to enjoy his job. But he was so super loud and obnoxious. The salad was cool, but just not very tasty. The dinner was about $100 per person, I tried the Filet & the Lobster Tail.

I encourage if anyone has any issues with Richard to report it to the hotel management, I wouldn't be surprised if your skin is dark or if you're not as well dressed that he will tell you the tables are full from reservations or treat you similarly.\n\nThere are no restrooms in the restaurant, so you need to go out and to the casino floor, Jeans assistant gave me brief and accurate directions and I returned to find a fine glass of Moscato waiting for me which I ordered to pair with the escargot, which I might add was the best I had since Paris.\n\nThe salad was custom crafted and the rack of lamb was cooked exactly as requested\n\nI tried to go to the bathroom a second time after getting my lamb, and then Richard blocked my way, he insisted that I must leave a credit card before leaving, even though I left and returned before, as well as I had left personal items, including my phone, in plain site on the table.  It was clear that Richard was profiling me because he thought I was of lesser class. \n\nI am absolutely insulted.\n\nI gave my card frustratingly and returned to finish my meal, the hostess that seated me originally apologized for Richards behavior and ignorance, I asked Jean if Richard had a manager I could speak with but was told unfortunately that he was the manager and I had no point of escalation. Jean also apologized for Richards behavior, it seems I'm not the only one he mistreats.\n\nI finished my meal, and I thought I would go to the floor quick and drop $5 in the slots while I let my dinner settle as my phone battery was low and I was catching a redeye out that evening, since I had plenty to drink already I brought my water, again leaving personal items on the table.  Richard again blocked me this time and insisted I must leave the glass, not asking where I was going or if I'd return, I felt like dumping the water on his head but unfortunately couldn't without possibly getting a customer wet.\n\nWhen I returned, my table was cleared, obviously they don't want me eating their wonderful selection of dessert, and Richard had Jean's assistant clear my table, he apologized for this and I could feel it was sincere, I never received a single apology from Richard, hence the label pompous bigot."

She did not ask for anything nor did she want anything. A manager, named john answered the phone and NEVER said that they were sorry, but only said they he would refer it to \"risk management.\"\n\nTwo weeks later a man named John Navitidad, called my girl friend. It is not necessary to go into a long dissertation on his attitude but the man can only be described as an old complete jerk, since he stated that he has been doing this for forty years. He as much as accused my girl friend of making up the story. She tried to explain to this hostile man that she wanted nothing but to inform the restaurant so that they could check out what she ate but he kept referring to \"her claim.\"\n\nSo I would say to future diners, be aware.

After an extended wait for entrees, with empty wine glass in hand and watching tables that were seated after us receive their meals, we were finally presented with our steaks. Upon cutting into her's the wife realized the pastry portion of the Wellinton was still doughy and the steak very very rare. My prime rib was one of the fattiest cuts that I have ever encountered. I realize that Prime rib is a marbled cut but this was mostly fat! Entrees were accompanied by overcooked veggies and lackluster mashed potatoes. We seemed to have no less than 3 people waiting on us at one time or another, at least until the steaks were served, yet none bothered to ask how was our meal and thus couldn't complain. My wife peeled off the dough and ate the outer, more done portion of the steak.  I would have had another glass of wine but never got the chance to order one. Had to basically tackel \"a\" server for the 2nd glass prior to the entrees.  Never saw the servers again until we disgustedly asked for the check. The only high points were the salad prepared tableside and the shrimp cocktail. Hence the 2-Star score for Food. \nSub-par Service and Food.

It was what we expected from a place that is often described as \"old Vegas.\"\n\nWe got the crab cakes and lobster bisque to start.  Loved the cakes, the bisque was not as big of a hit.  The famous salad cart came next.  The ingredients were good, but not great.  I will say the bleu cheese is of excellent quality.  A good, solid salad.\n\nI ordered the ribeye and my wife got the filet with a bleu cheese topping.  I was surprised by the quality of the ribeye.  Not much marbling and just not a great cut.  My wife's filet on the other hand was fantastic.  The crust was excellent as well.  This steak was superb.  The garlic mashed on the side were also excellent.\n\nThe wine list is reasonable but not extensive.  \n\nOverall, it was the experience we hoped for.  You can get better food at a lot of places in town, but it was a wonderful night."

Might feel a bit sketch walking down a dark hall into the \"cellar\" but as quickly as you reach the floor from the last step, you are greeted with great smiles and a rose for the females. Make sure you make a reservation before coming in, or you may end up waiting a bit. Luckily, while waiting, you can enjoy yourself to some tasty beverages! The bartender is this cocky but not annoying and sarcastic guy with all the right words and moves to keep you entertained. Once you are seated in, you can definitely tell this is a higher class dinning event. The menu is packed with such good delights! Extremely pricey, but money is no object when you bite into their delicious dishes. \n\nOne thing that sets this place apart from all the rest is the amount of servers that will be in your service. You have your water guy, then a mixed drink/beverage guy or John the wine guy, who really knows his stuf, and then you have a salad/dessert guy and then your main wait person. If you tell John what kind of wine you enjoy, he will suggest the finest wines for you to taste, which he also wears this cup thing around his neck to taste the wine before he serves it to you to try. These are definitely not your average cheap wine that you can easily buy at the store either. \n\nThe salad is prepped and made right in front of you with lots of options as to what you wanted in it. After is the hot tasty meal, which never fails to disappoint! I had one of the more popular lobster dish called the Queens Lobster, that apparently is the favorite of the staffs. It was amazing! The portion was too big for me to finish so I had boxed some to eat the next day and it was just as tasty the next day as it was fresh the day before. For desserts you have an option to pick from the menu and from the cart of delectable goodies. I don't remember the name of the desserts we had but I do remember having a show for it. It was some sort of sundae that was flamed and roasted in front of us. It was spectacular!\n\nAfter dinner, you can walk around Freemont and watch the experience. This year, they had a zip line going down from a tall building down the street all the way to the 4queens. It's another way to get the full Freemont experience after being pampered at Hugo's.\n\nOh and make sure you are dressed to impress when you walk into Hugo's Cellar. This is not a casual attire type of place. Hugo's is definitely a MUST when visiting Vegas! I can't wait to go back next year!"

Take steps down to the Underground Dungeon of a True Throw Back in Time Vegas Mob Style Dining Area.\n\nEvery Lady that steps foot in here, receives a long stem red rose.. Brownie points already! We didn't have a reservation but we were given a table in literally a minute and the place was filled. The host was a jokester, had a great sense of humor that definitely set a positive vibe and loosened things up.  2 Servers(1 Server & 1 Assistant Server, Not Busser) immediately pulled out our chairs, and greeted us with much enthusiasm! Without wasting time, they poured their own in-house bottled water into our glasses. Within seconds, our bread basket (basic dinner rolls and  lavash) was dropped off with butter that had been intricately sculpted into a rose bud! \n\nMenu offered a wide variety and every other entree I grazed at was so appealing. But I was sold on their 21 Day Dry Aged Top Shelf Rib Eye that is char-broiled and served with mushroom ragout and bordelaise sauce.  My girl orders Hugo's Chicken - breast of chicken stuffed with a sun dried tomato pesto and roasted garlic sauce. Both dishes included sides of veggies and mashed potatoes. Not only that, the order also came with their Custom Made Salad and Dessert!!!!! \n\nShortly after, a gentleman with this hunky salad cart rolled over and started to toss the  salad and asked what additions I cared for, about 15 different options! I added, creamy pepper dressing, onions, tomato, egg, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, parmesan cheese and croutons (they had anchovies and nuts too..). The lettuce, onions, extremely juicy tomato was farm picked fresh, artichoke hearts and hearts of palms added that lucious subtle flavor, egg, parmesan cheese and croutons just complemented each other wonderfully!! This disappeared in minutes.. \n\nThen one of the servers handed us over a tiny ice cream cone with a scoop of raspberry sorbet! Nice!\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, the servers came over with our piping hot plates of steak and chicken. The Steak was a chunky piece of meat that had Flawless grill marks checkered throughout. Fork tender and their mushroom/bordelaise aujus makes this Steak Unrivaled by Most Other Rib Eye's I've Ever Had!\n\nThe chicken had an aroma that filled the air with garlic and sundried tomatoes. As good as it smelled, it tasted even better! The stuffing/sauce flavors were expertly balanced with the chicken. Undeniably recommended!\n\nThe included sides were small but were a satisfying amount of vegetables, mash potato and pamesan crusted tomato that were all very good.\n\nWhen we were done, the servers boxed our leftovers and bagged them for carry-out.\n\nNext came the dessert tray, with an assortment of divine looking Treats.. We passed since we had our Chocoloate Covered/Dipped Strawberries, figs and apricot with their homemade whipped cream to come to the rescue! It came swiftly on this propped up cake stand, exactly what we needed to end the night right! Semi-sweet chocolate, flavorful fruits and fluffy whipped cream equals dessert Greatness!\n\nWhat an Experience! This place has Romance written all over it! Candle-lit dim dining room, Accomodating A+ Service, and Most Importantly this place doesn't Break the Bank! Just be cautious not to crack open too many bottles of Wine!!"

Okay, it was mainly the amazing salad (mixed at your table, to your specifications) that grabbed our attention. But, the rest of the meal and spirits were great as well.\n\nWell, from what I can remember (in between shots of Patron), I had a great salad and steak. The salad (did I mention it was amazing?!) was fabulous. Okay, maybe it was just the alcohol was talking at this point, but we all thought the salad was wonderful! Besides being made in individual portions and with whatever we liked, it was tossed thoroughly and not overwhelming in the dressing department at all. My steak was cooked well, seasoned just right, and helped combat the alcohol demons coursing through my veins at the time. Just remember that saying, \"Beer before liquor...\"\n\nLike many of the other reviews state, this place is kitschy and 'old school' in terms of the decor. Set in the basement of the Four Queens Hotel in downtown Las Vegas, this place is something straight out of a 50s, 60s, or 70s movie. It's rather dark inside, but that only serves to heighten the mood: cool and chill. I felt like a high-roller in this place. It's classy and sophisticated...even though you're in the heart of Sin City itself! Service was top-notch and overall, we had a spectacular meal.\n\nI highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good food and doesn't mind having to travel 'off the strip' in order to get it."

It was a Friday night and checked open table and thought we would check Hugo's.  Fortunately, they had a no-show for a reservation (reservations are HIGHLY encouraged!) so they were able to squeeze us in.\n\nWe waited in the lounge while our table opened up and met one of the most amazing bartenders - we ordered a Side Car (made his way) and Harvey Wallbanger, which were both fantastic.  They also had some very nice \"munchies\" at the bar.  I would definitely return to their lounge just for drinks.\n\nDinner was fantastic!  They have a very classic menu with amazing service.  Every single person who came to our table was friendly and well versed.  Our Sommelier was quite entertaining and we invited him back to join us for a toast.  The freshly tossed salad was impeccable.  We considered ordering dessert, but were so stuffed especially with the delightful little treats served at the end of the meal.\n\nMy only \"complaint\" was that some of the clientele did not dress appropriately for the venue (as noted in other reviews).  Downtown Las Vegas has come a long way with some great new options, and this one has remained true to its origins with service and quality befitting the heydays of Las Vegas.  This is a true gem that I had heard about for years and am glad we made it there to enjoy.  I will definitely return again and recommend it without hesitation for a special evening."

Then my aunt remembered where the \"other' place was that they wanted to eat @ on their last trip out there.\n\nIt is located in the lower level of the 4 Queens Casino in the old downtown area on Freemont St.  Upon arrival in this little basement restaurant, the ladies were given roses to take to our dinner table.  The place was very seductive looking, w/ very low lighting and some nice jazz playing softly in the backround.\n\nThree waiters took turns pouring our Evian water, handing us menus, and taking our cocktail orders.  The menu was a great mix of top notch seafood and Grade A cuts of meat.  I ordered the Tournados Hugo.... two 5 oz filets wrapped in bacon and topped w/ foie gras sereved w/ a delicious beef stock reduction.  Dad had the swordfish, aunt had the scallops, mom had veal oscar, and uncle had the veal chop.  \n\nBefore dinner, your waiter comes tableside w/ a salad cart and prepares each salad separatly!  It's like going to the salad bar without actually getting up to go to the salad bad.  Friggen Awesome.  \n\nAfter the customized salad, the table is sereved a mini sorbet ice cream cones to cleanse the pallet.  Raspberry sorbet to be more specific.  How cute and delicious.  \n\nAll of the diners were A- or better.  my foie gras left a bit to be desired, but that is about the only thing i could find wrong during the entire dinner.\n\nThe prices look pretty hefty when you first sit down and look @ the menu,(most dinner are $40 and higher) but you have to realize how much you are actually getting w/ this dinner.  The amount of food was perfectly stuffing.  And even if you don't want desert, they bring you a tray of chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots w/ whipped cream!\n\nOther nice things:  Martinis come in small, iced carafes, so you can drink and then pour more when you are ready.  A wine steward actually brings your wine directly from the wine cellar, not your waiters.  Nice to have a wine steward so they can answer any questions you may have about your fermented grapes.\n\nWhen in Vegas, GO~!"

The service was top notch with many attending to our every need.\n\nBUT the mediocre food could not make up for all of the above. I ordered the Filet Boeuf, which is a bacon wrapped 10oz filet with lump crab meat. My husband ordered the NY strip.\n\nHis NY strip had great flavor and was a tad under cooked for medium but my filet was way undercooked. I've been to plenty of nice steak places and have ordered my filet medium. This place turned it out pretty much rare. The steak was very thick and did not have enough charring on the outside as usual and was raw.\n\nThe lump crab that the steak sat on, was mixed with what appeared to be a dry stuffing mixture and it was dry. I didn't care very much for the texture or flavor.\n\nThe green beans were cooked well but had no flavor and the mashed potato was firm. They scooped it with a ice cream scooper and it could have been a little softer.\n\nThe meal reminded me of when you attend a seminar or a mid price ranged wedding and they serve you mediocre food that is luke warm.\n\nAlthough the price is great considering a table side hand tossed salad, all the veggies, bread, chocolate covered fruit tray, and bottled water are all included with the entree and not a la carte like most places, the value really isn't there if the steak isn't done right.\n\nI don't know if it was a fluke with my steak having been undercooked but the overall meal left little desire for me to return for a second trip."

We ordered escargot for an appetizer, and it was really nice.  It boded well for the meal to come, that's for sure.\n\nThe tableside salad - lackluster at best.

Iceburg lettuce, mushrooms, pine nuts, tomatoes, artichokes, blue cheese ... eh, it was ok.  \n\nThe sommelier seemed to really know his stuff.  We took his recommendation, and he wasn't wrong about that.\n\nI ordered the beef wellington - medium rare.  It came out medium.  The sommelier advised us that it was, in fact, medium, but that it would take another 20 minutes to get another one .... so I ate half of my medium wellington.\n\nWe were never actually offered dessert.  Too bad, because my husband really wanted to try the bananas foster.  We were, however, able to order some cappuccinos, and those did not disappoint.\n\nIt took a long time to clear off the tables between courses.  I'm not sure if that was because the place was busy ... or not.  Also, my water went unfilled for a long time; I eventually had to ask the server for more water.

I suggested we try Hugo's Cellar as I had read some good reviews on Yelp.\n\nWe made reservations with the snooty maitre d', and headed off to the casino bar to have a few drinks.  Ugh.  Snooty maitre d'.  Oh well.\n\nI tell you what, I was impressed by the quality of the food at the Cellar.  Everything was outstanding.  My steak was fabulous.  They make individual salads to order at your table - the poor salad dude had to ask everyone at the table what they wanted on their salad, one item at a time.  Playing twenty questions with the salad guy got a little tiresome, but he had a good sense of humor in dealing with our (my) general drunkenness.  Artichokes?  No.  Olives?  Yes.  Anchovies?  Shit, why not?  Croutons?  Yes. Hippopotamus?  What?  No.  Etc....\n\nOur waiter and the sommelier crossed way over into the Land of Pretentiousness, making them easy to mock for a drunk guy such as myself.   Having said that, I've got to say that the service was very good, especially if you like pretentious servers.\n\nEverything was included in the price of an entr\u00e9e, including the salad, a starch, and even chocolate-covered desserts.  Did you know that apricot is pronounced \"APE-ri-cot?\"  I didn't.  Really, you did?  No shit!  I'm from the Midwest, sue me.  I don't really care for \"APE-ri-cots,\" so I gave mine to a fellow diner.  And I giggled like a little girl every time the waiter said \"APE-ri-cot.\"  Not a good performance by me, I have to say.\n\nWe were there late in the evening and were among the last folks to leave.  This gave me the opportunity to actually see snooty maitre d' guy step out of character while talking to water refilling guy.  Snooty maitre d' guy actually seemed like a decent guy, which was nice.\n\nLet's bring this home.  I thought the food and service was outstanding at the Cellar.  And the entr\u00e9es were all priced at around $40-$50 or so.  Very good value.  I would highly recommend this place, and I'll try to be sober next time I make an appearance.  Really.  I promise."

As soon as you walk in you are greeted by someone who hands you a rose (as long as you have b00bies) and then you are taken to your table. The ambience is wonderful. The place is dimly lit and everyone is dressed up in suits. \n\nThe waiters are all very friendly, although that could be because I was about 60 years younger than anyone else in the place....and I'm not exaggerating. \n\nApparently, they specialize in martinis. I didn't have one. I'm just putting it out there :)\n\nAnyways, the salads are awesome! There is a salad cart that comes to your table and your salad is completely customized. I can't recall all the options but here are a few: bay shrimp, egg, bleu cheese crumbles, croutons, onion, tomato, and pine nuts. As for dressings they offer caesar, pepper ranch, and a really good honey something rather vinaigrette (which I opted for). Not something I usually go for but I'm glad I did. It was delicious! \n\nTo start with, I had the shrimp cocktail, 3 jumbo shrimp with cocktail sauce and a super yummy remoulade. That really made the dish!\n\nIn between the appetizers and meals, they bring over a tiny scoop of lemon sorbet on a mini cone to clease your palette. I have never been to a place that did this before but I thoroughly enjoyed it!\n\nI also got prime rib, prepared medium rare. It was very good. You can also get them crusted with bleu cheese or horseradish, which I accidentally forgot to ask for :(\n\nTo top the meal off, the include chocolate covered strawberries, apricots, and figs. Really special touch.\n\nI loved it here! The ambiance was really amazing and it is definitely a place to go if you are celebrating something special! Be prepared to spend some coin though. Really worth it"

Should have left then since Hugo's announced right away how blatantly they had changed. I was livid and told this cretin about his attempt at larceny.  A turn out this guy is also the manager. After this glorious beginning it got worse. I've been going to Hugo's for years and loved it. My previous reviews have been sparkling. We generally bring our own wine and because they carry the brand there is a $25 corkage charge. I have never paid that charge but reflect the non-charge in the Sommelier's tip. Both the Sommelier and the mgr. assured me there would be no corkage charge. There was a charge. No problem, the Sommelier paid for it. Next was the salad;a great salad served at your choice of ingredients at the table. This was the meal's highlight. The server was pleasant and good and the salad perfect. We ordered the Beef Wellington and lobster tails. The tails were $90 but Australian tails are hard to find. No chef needed here, tails were great. The Wellington meat was perfect but the liver crust was shoddy and almost liver free. That never happened before. However, over all the food was very good. The waiter was ridiculously silly and lazy. Kept muttering something about serving ladies first. We had ordered the 2 dishes to share and explicitly requested the beef be cut at the table so my wife could get the better-done ends. We attempted to get the vegetables we wanted not the m\u00e9lange they wished to serve. This waiter refused to do that; a first at a \"fine restaurant\".  The meal was not split, nor the meat carved at table. Like the vegetables I gave up the meat carving but insisted the meal be shared in the kitchen. A very unappetizing dinner was had. Oh,there has always been a 20% discount available through the casino which owns the place or at the 2 for stands in town for a small fee. Well they reduced it unilaterally to 20% on one entree. I am only upset at the people who have, in the past, gone here because of my reviews.  This place is now only for people with low to no self esteem, masochists and really ignorant tourists. My hope is that this review will cost at least as much business as the good ones I have given. Oh! I tipped what I was given. Zilch. I wish more people would assert themselves. It still cost close to $200 for a miserable dinner.  A note. Hugo's cancelled my reservation after I had been there. It took a while to figure out why. Turns out that if one has not been at the restaurant one can not review that restaurant on Open  Table. That is a problem that Open Table should fix in my view. However, Trip Advisor is a much better place to review a restaurant. I can not believe the pettiness this place, Hugo's, resorts to cover up some thing that never should have happened."

I had heard such great things, I'd read so many of the raving reviews and I just couldn't wait to go there. The bf and I went last night for a belated Valentine's dinner.\n\nI wasn't expecting it to be difficult to make a reservation, but the earliest seating they had was at 9:00 pm. That's later than I like to eat dinner, but hey, we were willing to for the experience. Upon arrival I received a long stem red rose and there was a vase on the table to hold it. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, passing several booths and intimate looking tables, many of which were open.\n\nThe menu looked amazing! We really struggled to decide what to order. We asked the market price on the 2 Broiled Alaskan Lobster Tails ($89), as well as the lb. of Alaskan King Crab legs ($110 or $120 - I can't recall). We decided to share the lobster tails as well as Filet de Boeuf - Atlantis (Ten ounce filet wrapped with bacon; served with lump crab and b\u00e9arnaise sauce) ($62). Up to this point everything is good, the atmosphere, the service, etc.\n\nThe table side salad arrived and I ordered Caesar dressing, tomatoes, egg crumbles, artichoke hearts and hearts of palm, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. It looked amazing! And the taste? Fishy. I didn't get it. I didn't add the shrimp. Maybe they use anchovies in their dressing, but I typically like that. For whatever reason my salad tasted fishy. I ate most all of it anyway.\n\nThey seated a party of 6 adults directly behind us, and a party of 6 or 7 young women directly behind them. What started out as a nice romantic evening turned in to loud conversation and boisterous laughter from the surrounding tables. Then when their salad service arrived the waiter was talking louder than everyone trying to take the orders. We sat and ate and complained about the noise, but there was nothing we could do.\n\nWhen our meals arrived they looked so delicious! They removed the tails from the shell foe us and brought heated butter. The first few bites of the filet were good, but not very tender like you would expect filet to be. I kept finding bites of fat from the bacon that surrounded it. By the time we got to see the center of the steak it was obvious it was not properly cooked. We ordered medium, and not only was the center bright red but we both had bloody plates. We didn't send it back but we should have. We didn't finish the filet but we brought it home for leftovers. The lobster was actually pretty good. It was cooked perfectly, not at all rubbery. The mashed potatoes were delicious, but the asparagus was a let down.\n\nThey asked us if we wanted coffee after dinner, but didn't ask if we wanted dessert. I didn't, but I thought it was a little rude that they didn't offer. Instead they did bring out our plate of chocolate covered strawberries, apricots and figs. The strawberry I had was good, the bf said his had little flavor.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't the hyped up experience we were expecting. The food was meh...  and not properly cooked. The service was good, but the atmosphere was ruined from the noise. With tax and tip it was basically a $200 dinner. For that price I'll go elsewhere next time."

After realising our party was under-dressed for the steakhouse at the top of Binion's (turns out they frown on guys in shorts, even with good shoes and decent button-up shirts - Sorry about dressing for 100+ degree heat!), we wondered around just trying to find anything (turns out one in our group turned out to be kinda picky). I had \"a feeling\" for the 4 Queens, so we went in there and found Hugo's Cellar. \n\nSheer Perfection. \n\nGreat Style (You enter by going down a staircase. The brightly-lit hussle-bussle of the casino disappears as you descend into nice subdued lighting, beautiful brick and wooden pillars),  \n\nOld World Hospitality (the ladies all received long stemmed red roses and were seated by the staff), \n\nGood sized Portions ( the drinks, from the bar that seat 5, come in 1/2litre carafes in little ice buckets, so you're getting about 2+ drinks for the price of 1).\n\nOur service was over the top outstanding. Eddie, our congenial bartender fixed superb drinks, from uber-standards, The Manhattan and The Cosmopolitan, to the faddish Raspberry Chocolate Martini. Sue was at the podium as Matre'D. She optimized great service with her balance of candor and professionalism.\n\nI've had lots of good food and I thought the food here was very good. The table side salads were all done in the same bowl; so you're right, it's not going to be pure flavor of your particular choices. Eh, we all thoroughly enjoyed our salads anyway.  Two of us are Veg; you might be surprised by the great meals made from just veggie sides at your typical high end steakhouse. Hugo's didn't disappoint and they fixed up quite decent plates for us. Others in our group had the swordfish and a porterhouse. Everyone was pleased with their meal.\n\nAt the end of the meal they brought us chocolate covered strawberries; each one was about the size of your fist. Interestingly, we had had fist-size chocolate-dipped strawberries the night before at a wedding reception and had been impressed then.  And yet, the ones at Hugo's were bigger and sweeter.  Crazy...\n\nHugo's has become a permanent stop every time we come to Vegas."

It's quiet even though it's right next to the casino - the only complaint I had about this is that due to the smell of the smoke from the casino, it seemed like they were overcompensating with some sort of air freshener to get rid of the smoke smell.  This just resulted in a mixture of perfumed smoke smell in the entryway/bar of the restaurant.\n\nThe dinner we had was very good - we mostly opted for steaks, but the fish I had was done perfectly.  However, our waiter was just running through the motioned and you could definitely tell he was bored and did not want to be there.  That definitely put a downer on our experience there.

For an \"old school gourmet restaurant in a romantic atmosphere\" why is there NO dress code?! I don't want to sit next to a party of college kids in shorts and tank tops! All the elderly people understand this is a place you dress up for. Secondly, this restaurant seriously needs to move away from downtown. Four Queens is a trashy gaudy casino in the ghetto of Vegas. When the elevator clunks and jerks when it moves the three people it will fit, and there are people wearing gang colors just hanging out in a group looking at all the cars park, it kind of makes you say, \"I don't care how good the food is if I think my car might get broken in to.\"\nIf this place moved to a nicer neighborhood, and maybe had an upstairs/downstairs to separate the average tourist from someone actually having a \"night out\" like an anniversary, then I would recommend this place, but not as it is now.

You could imagine our disappointment when 7 of us dined & were not able to order an appetizer along with our drinks without first ordering our meal. The assistant manager begrudgingly agreed after much discussion to grant us that request. It took 20+ minutes to receive, during a not-packed evening. Our servers were apologetic & attentive as usual despite that Jon, our favorite sommelier, was not there. My husband was ready to call Andiamo's at the D where we had had a terrific dinner for 10 a few weeks before. After dinner we requested our leftovers but when we got home, we found just a portion in each box. Normally, I'd ignore that but not after the condescending, boorish treatment by the assistant manager earlier. He responded scoffingly: Do you expect me to drive over & deliver them? I responded that I wanted the manager to call me the next day so I could explain the evening's experiences. Well, it's been 11 days. I get your message loud & clear, Mr. Assistant. Instead of Hugo's we will dine with friends, business clients & family at our other favorite restaurants: Bouchon, T-Bones, Andiamo's, Botero, & so many others."

Two of our friends had arrived just ahead of us and were already sipping on old fashioneds...I am not an expert on cocktails by any means but these old fashioneds were not the best I have tried.  \n\nAll the staff at Hugo's Cellar, from waiter to the sommelier, John, were friendly and professional with a welcoming manner. John was wearing a small metal bowl to taste all the wine he opens for the night...what a lucky guy with such a pleasant manner. We were already in an incredible mood when Gene, the Salad-mixologist, topped it up with this engaging preparations...he's been working at Hugo's Cellar over 3 decades...patiently and kindly aqurairing our preferences for the table-side salad making. He offered three different house made salad dressings, as wells as anchovies, hardboiled egg, lettus, shrimp, onion, mushroom, tomato, croutons, blue cheese, parmesan cheese, hearts of palms, pine nuts...Gene literally brings out a cart full of ingredients and asks for your likes and dislikes. Then, he prepares and mixes it right in front of you...very freshly special.  \n\nBefore our entree, we received a Raspberry Sorbet cone to cleanse our palettes. For the entrees, my love and I shared the Trio of Seafood, and a Filet mignon.  The seafood came with sweet potato, white and green asparagus, stuffed tomato, Crab cake, Shrimp, and Sea bass...the taste was all alright, but the presentation was lacking in some parts. Our Filet was cooked perfect for our request, and came with mashed potato, asparagus and a duo of mushrooms...it all tasted average. We also received a complementary dessert tray with chocolate covered strawberries, dark chocolate covered apricots, and figs with white chocolate...there were all good but not so stimulating as to promise our return visit...but we loved Hugo Cellar's wine selections and services from the beginning to end... \n\nI am grateful to Hugo's Cellar for keeping the old Vegas setting...adoring the ladies with a red rose, and the authentic service...but not so much for the food and presentation."

Place was very busy and service was terrible.  Only bright side of the service was John the Sommelier.  Only thing neg about him was it took about 30 minutes for him to come to our table.  Our waiter rec we skip him and just let him pick us a wine... he brought out a Robert Mondavi I smirked and said please go get the Sommelier.  He rec a great bottle from Napa.  So 1 hour into our evening and we have our wine and bread still waiting on the shrimp scampi and the crab cake.  The whole night it felt like we were forgotten about was very disappointing.  Finally the apps arrive both tasted good no complaints.  This time we are almost at 2 hours in the cellar and I'm beginning to get inpatient but the rave reviews I have read on Yelp had me looking forward to our main courses.  They arrived I ordered the 16 oz NY and the wife ordered the beef wellington.  The 16oz NY was VERY disappointing not sure they seasoned the steak with any salt and pepper.  It was cooked prefect medium rare which is what I ordered but was missing flavor.  Also I expected a much better quality of steak.  I would have graded the steak Choice or select far from the dry aged prime discribed on the menu.  I ate about 1/4 of the steak the mashed potatoes were very buttery and fatty.  They shimmered in the lighting.  My wife ordered the beef wellington and she was pleased with the taste and flavor of it.  I tried it and also thought it was very good.  finally finished the main course 2.5 hours into the evening had to rush out to make it to our 10 O'clock show.... Never again unless you like a 2.5 hour dinner I would look somewhere else.  Don't order a NY steak you will likely be disappointed."

I have to say, this dish was almost perfect. The chicken itself was perfectly cooked, the sauce was fantastic, the mushroomsoh so good, the only let down...And pretty much the only let down of the night was the potatoes....They were actually good, however thepresentation really was ...well stupid, it was clear that they came straight from a water warming pan to my plate, via an ice cream scoop,why take the time to make a great dish and then just take a scoop of potatoes and plop them on a plate...Silly.\n\nYes I am picking at little things, the meal really was that good.\n\nthe wife had the Sea Bass, a nice dish, though I am not a fan of Sea Bass, so we will have to take her word for it.\n\nAll in all, a great meal, with great friends."

We had honey-walnut vinaigrette on our salads.\n\nI ordered a beef wellington and the husband ordered a Filet de Boeuf Atlantis.

            "review": "It was a Friday and I had made reservations two days in advance.  The place was busy. Nonetheless, we only waited 10 minutes to be seated.  I received a long stemmed rose, like every other lady in the house.  Hugo's Cellar has a classic, vintage, old Las Vegas feel. Some patrons were dressed in coats while others were in shorts and flip flops.  The place is compact with a low ceiling and dim lights. Waiters have to squeeze the carts between table spaces.\n\nI had lobster bisque for my starter while my husband feasted on the bread. The lobster bisque was ordinary, but I was not fazed; afterall, this place had stood the test of time in an ever changing Vegas restaurant scene.  People must come here for a reason.  We each had the Hugo's Table Side Salad. It was salad prepared by the salad master who comes around in a cart.  He was such an expert, but the busy house kind of made the whole making-the-salad-in-front-of-you experience feel rushed. The salads were good but, I would have loved some other kinds of greens apart from lettuce.  For the entrees we had the Atlantis (Filet de Boeuf) and the Rack of Lamb.  The filet was seasoned perfectly and perfectly cooked, medium, spot on with the desired doneness.  It was the most tender piece of meat I have ever had and believe me, I had been to many a good steak houses in town (Golden Steer, Ruth's Chris, Carnevino, The Steak House in Circus Circus to name a few).  It literally melted in my mouth. The Rack of Lamb was equally spot on.  I ordered medium well and it was cooked to how I wanted it done. This place, REALLY knows how to cook meat! The sides were very good too but were more like backup dancers to the stars of the entrees.  Some might say, that is how it should be.  For dessert we had the famous table side flamb\u00e9ed Bananas Fosters and a cappuccino.  Wow! Recalling my experience is making me hungry. \n\nThe wine was a memorable experience.  They have an extensive wine list but their Sommelier, Jon, was nice enough to recommend the last bottle of 2007 Paul Hobbs Cabernet in his possession.  Mind you, this wine was not on the wine list, and it was flattering to be in on this little secret. The wine complemented the entrees very well.  \n\nThe only thing that bothered me throughout the whole experience was the heat in the cellar.  It was hot down there! Perhaps it was because of the number of patrons in addition to table side cooking.  \n\nWhile this place is pricey, there are reasons to justify the costs. All the portions of meals, including the dessert and cappuccino were HUGE!  I do appreciate the complementary bottled water, the freshly baked breads, the sorbet to cleanse the palette and the chocolate dipped strawberries, apricot and figs.\n\nHugo's Cellar is a survivor for a several reasons. Their service, how they treat their meat, their wine list, how they embrace the classics (like giving roses to the ladies and keeping a good menu) are all note worthy. Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience.  I do see myself coming back on a non weekend, just to see how things are."

The salad service resulted in a customized choice of items and dressing, which I liked a lot. \n\nMain courses -- Those who got Prine Rib absolutely loved it, and based on the bites I stole, I agree. Stupidly I got the seafood trio, and I will comment on each item. The crab cake had a lot of filler and was very average. The Chilean Sea Bass was begging for a Miso glaze. The shrimp was over-cooked and rubbery. My bad for ordering seafood in a steak place. Just go ahead and get meat!!\n\nLoved the old school vegas vibe, and seeing downtown. Go here when you have time to explore Freemont Street--super fun!! Definitely go here!  Be sure to order the beef!"

The mood is very casual and dim. They seated us in a more private area all the way in the back. Our reservation was at opening, so it wasn't crowded. They have a good variety on their menu and the party had the prime rib, Chilean sea bass, chicken, ravioli, and I had the rib eye. The steak was OK. Wanted a little more flavor to it and it was a good size. Oh, and the salad that's included in the meal was made to order. That was nice. I had the creamy peppercorn with egg, shrimp, croutons, and pine nuts. Very delicious and simple. They serve bottled water as well as part of the meal. Then a complimentary dessert of chocolate covered strawberry, white chocolate covered fig, and chocolate covered apricot. After the meal, we only needed the small dessert with a cup of coffee. The coffee was served with a dark chocolate stick and cinnamon stick. Made the coffee flavorful. The experience was nice. The servers were great! Very attentive to our needs and cordial.

The locations a little odd in the bottom of the four queens and the decor maybe getting a little dated.  However, I thought the service was a solid 5 stars and the food 4.  \n\nThe table side salad was nice and the server Victor was such a character.  I'd order the salad just to talk with Victor, he is what I would expect to be a classic Vegas persona.    \nIn between the salad and main course they bring out the tiniest lemon Sorbet to clean your taste buds.  Never had something like that before and thought it was a nice touch. \n\nMy lady friend ordered the prime rib, which was huge.  She thought it was good but maybe a tad tough.  That sucker had to be over a pound.  \n\nI opted for the beef Wellington, I thought it was good, better then the Wellington at Gordon Ramsay steak at Paris.  Ramsays steak is really good,overall better, but Hugo's to me is classic Vegas.  They aren't wowing you with the decor and a fancy meat cart.  It's excellent service backed up with good food.  \nThe price was actually really good, when you consider the meal includes salad and sides."

Request the Sommelier to get expert advice on wine pairings (try the 2006 Meyers Cabernet if still available) or be adventurous and let the chef select your meal. If you are like me and like to share dishes with your date, just order your own meal and divide the portions yourself.

If you want a more heavier desert then Hugo's has a desert tray for your selection (added cost).  We had a party of 6 and a 18% gratuity was automatically added to our bill.\n\nThe service and food was excellent as commanded by the price of the meal.  The Cellar is a little dimmer than it should be.  Tables are lit by candle light to add a romantic ambiance.  Personally, I think a little more lighting is needed.\n\nI had the prime rib 16oz cut.  There were only two choices of prime rib on the menu, 16oz & 24oz.  Frankly, there should be another choice for prime rib.  I recommend a 10 oz cut be added to the menu because the 16oz cut is too big.

The hostess was very kind.\n\nThe waiter was quick to my table, friendly and explained the menu very well.\n\nHow about some whipped butter with an assortment of fresh bread? YUP.\n\nFor those who enjoy wine, Hugo's has a sommelier...wine stewart. If wine knowledge isn't your thing, it's ok...there won't be a quiz.  Sommeliers won't make you feel stupid. They're available to help with pairings and a deeper understanding of wine IF you want.\n\nWho doesn't love a table-side salad cart? Many fresh and chilled salad fixin's to choose from.\n\nYou may be surprised with the raspberry sorbet pallet cleanser. This is not common.  You might think...WHAT, dessert comes first? No, this is how rich people eat.  LOL.\n\nLet me circle back to the waiter and service. I like a waiter who will not only make suggestions, but damn near insist you eat a particular menu item.  Of course, we the customer have final say, but it shows the waiter will go beyond normal service.\n\nYou can order sides, but Hugo's isn't cheap.  They will provide veggies and starch with your main course. Also, they have sauce options for meat items.\n\nThe dinner concluded with an assortment of complimentary goodies, including chocolate covered strawberries and FRESH whipped cream. I was caught off guard. I thought I was suppose to choose one of many treats on the dessert tray. Nope, they were all for me! I understand Hugo's offers a pretty amazing Banana's Foster table side show.  I don't how people do it. The other courses are not small.\n\nFollowing dinner, both the waiter and hostess insist I come back...as if I was a celebrity or high roller. I was given a business card with the hostess' name and phone number...the restaurant phone number.\n\nI will DEFINITELY give them a call.\n\nNOW, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND LOOK THROUGH ALL THE PHOTO'S."

This time we did not plan ahead and we asked a local while we were cruising downtown- he suggested Hugo's Cellar. \n\nLet me first say I was very surprised to find a romantic and quiet restaurant just below the casino floor of the 4 Queens. There is a stairway down right next to the buffet, so I was a little nervous going in.  We had a party of six all dressed downtown casual, but they did not bat an eyelash and were able to seat us immediately. They even handed each of the ladies a long-stemmed red rose. \n\nThe food was great. Especially the table-side salad. (One of the best restaurant salads I've had.) The service was even better. Despite our casual attire, we were treated very well and had excellent service by our server and enjoyed a great conversation with an outstanding sommelier. \n\nThank you Hugo's for delivering an outstanding meal without the usual snobbery of this type of high class establishment."

It was supposed to be a touch of class, upscale, romantic, elegant restaurant, but it is not even close to that. First it's located underground of 4 Queens old casino, and with old (fake) brick wall, musty smell of a carpet and decor and stuffed with the cigarette smoke coming from the casino, the whole place is more kitschy and tacky that anything else (even more with roses for ladies at the entrance).\nSecondly, food is far too overpriced. $62 for seafood trio consisting of 2 shrimps, 2 scallops, 1 crab cake. The crab cake tasted so weird, (couldn't identified spices in it) and a lobster bisque was too salty. To make long story short, this was our first, last and never again time."

We got there 30 minutes early to have a glass of wine (the house wine is Franciscan) and enjoy the complimentary pate and nuts at the bar.\n\nThe table-side salad is the best - I'm probably the only girl on earth who loves anchovies - and they have toppings like bay shrimp, blue cheese crumbles, and hearts of palm.  The honey walnut dressing complements the salad.\n\nMy hubby and I split one of the chicken dishes, wasn't in the mood for steak, and were pretty full so we took the rest to go.  \n\nThe best part of the dinner are the complimentary chocolate covered strawberries and dried fruit they give you - the staff was kind enough to make it to go for us. \n\nOverall - definitely worth the $$"

The reason I'm not giving 4 stars is that I ordered the double filet with foie gras, as did my boyfriend, and his was rare but I couldn't tell the difference with my medium order.

I did get a rose but the place seemed as unpretentious as you can get.  There were people in jeans drinking Bud Lite everywhere!  I felt overdressed in my casual dress and hubs in his kakis and button down.  \nAnyway, dinner STARTED off great.  We were greeted immediately, drink orders brought promptly, dinner ordered in no time flat.  Bread basket arrived (bread just okay, nothing special) and salad cart whisked over.  We got started on our delicious salads (so fun getting to custom order at your table from the salad cart!)\nThen it was like 'poof', everyone disappeared!  We couldn't get a drink refill or even a glass of water to save our life.  We were so desperate we even tried to get a drink from the food runner (of course he just mumbled something about tracking down our server but never did).  To make matters worse, we were sandwiched between two very large, very loud & drunk parties so we had to shout at each other just to have a conversation.  \nDinner was perfectly cooked - I had the seafood trio, he had the prime rib.  Both excellent, no complaints there.  The chocolate dipped fruit was kind of lame (dried apricots dipped in chocolate?  not so good) but whatever, it came with the meal.  We didn't get any sorbet after salad so maybe they stopped doing that?  I dunno.    \nFinished our fruit and sat around for another 20 minutes until my husband finally started waving his credit card around trying to catch someone's eye.  20 minutes later bill finally arrived.  Brought by the salad guy.  Ridiculous!  Had to leave because we were so parched.  \n  \n4 stars for food, 1/2 a star for service and ambiance.  I'd spend my hard earned money somewhere else!"

Hugo's is located in the Four Queens down in Old Vegas. As mentioned before, all women receive a long-stemmed red rose, they even have a vase at the table for you to put it in while you are dining. The maitre d' looked alot like the actor Michael Caine, perhaps a distant cousin??. He was very sweet and welcoming though. \n\nI ordered a steak and the other half ordered duck, that ended up being flambeed tableside. I loved the salads that were made tableside too. I was beginning to feel bad for the guy that went around making each tables salads. He probably felt like a robot. Tomatoes?, anchovies?, shrimp?, blue cheese,? choice of dressing? Our server was wonderful. All of the food was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. All meals come with chocolate dipped fruit and whipped cream, as well. The whipped cream was superb and decadently homemade. They even offer a regular dessert menu, but we didn't get to that because we were simply stuffed. \n\nThe only regret I had was that I was not able to bring my rose home on the airplane with me, for fear it wouldn't survive the journey/get crushed. I took pictures of it though."

I waited patiently as the bartender tended to one waiter after another.  I finally asked him for some cheese and crackers and he totally ignored me.  The hostess knew that I was getting hot and she sat us right away.\n\nNow I don't know the intricacies of the food industry.  But apparently, this place does everything the old school way and they do it top notch.  I had to listen to my friend describe how a butter rose was made, how time consuming it was to make a good bordelaise sauce, and how the napkin under the creme brulee was a difficult fold to make.\n\nI was still pissed about the bartender ignoring me.  Plus, I question whether or not they got my order correct.  I ordered the rib eye steak medium rare.

Even though reservations are not required, it is helpful to ensure you get a table during the peak dining hours.  What are those in Vegas?  Between now and then...  There have been times that we messed up and didn't call ahead, and we waited.  Then, other times, we were seated right away.  It's Vegas and all about the gamble, right?\n\nThe rose upon entry for the ladies is such a nice feature.  Late in the evening when you walk around downtown, it's interesting to count how many roses there are floating around.  That Hugo guy must have been a huge romantic!  Probably has a lot of children as well.  (wink wink)\n\nThe food at Hugo's has yet to disappoint.  From the salad cart where you get to pick what goes into your salad, to the entree's served fresh and hot, to the complimentary chocolate-covered fruit.\n\nAll of this luxury, and a wine list to make any oenophile happy with the varied choices.  Stuck on which wine to choose? Help is what the sommelier loves to offer.  They are easy to spot because they have the gold medal hanging from their neck.  Just kidding, it's a tastevin used to sample before your first taste to ensure the wine is proper to be served.  Another nice touch.  For mixed drink fans, the bar makes solid drinks, not shy on flavor or punch.\n\nThis is a place where it is perfect to dress to impress.  One of the nicest restaurants in town, you want to look sharp.\n\nWe just wish they would bring back the original Hugo's chicken."

We went to the Four Queens Casino in old Vegas and followed the stairs down to Hugo's Cellar. We were greeted by the hostess and the ladies were given red roses. Nice touch, except now red roses remind me of death, after V for Vendetta. Anyway, we were promptly seated. The restaurant was busy but there was no line. The waiter seemed annoyed that only two of the five of us ordered drinks. I might have ordered a glass of wine but I just can't justify spending nearly $20 on A drink. We told the waiter we were all going to share some appetizers (to start). The salads are made fresh at the table and are $19 each. (No, the croutons were not golden.) I said we would share a few. He was totally put off... OH NO, you can't share the salads... we would have to charge you. Heck, I thought that's what the $19 was?? Anyway, the salads were tasty (I snuck a bite of my dad's when the waiter wasn't looking) but small. The crab cakes were average, the shrimp was DELICIOUS and the blue cheese stuffed mushrooms were tasty but strong. We were still really hungry but not enjoying the ambiance enough to warrant spending $50+ a plate, so we decided to get our check. All in all, we were in and out in 30 minutes, and spent over $100 (pre tax/tip) on 2 side salads, 3 appetizers, and 2 domestic beers, so Hugo's should not have been annoyed at the quick table turn, yet they seemed almost hostile that we left after appetizers."

The salad alone is to die for. I could seriously go and just have them make me the salad. I dream about that salad. And needless to say, service is always impeccable. Highly recommend that you try this old school Vegas gem."

The staff was friendly enough, but they need more training to pull off a high quality experience.  They were Denny's quality servers. Took a lot of the romance and fun out of it.  Also we were quoted \"policy\" that we order appetizer and meal at the same time.  A clear effort to turn over tables quickly.  Similarly priced places would never do this."

Waiter (Michael) was good, we were seated promptly (party of 10); food/ambiance/bar does not compare anymore to other leading steakhouses (Flemings, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, etc.).\n\nThe wine 'sommelier' is an A-HOLE!  We asked about a bottle of Les Dix Cab, he said it was very good,  blah, blah, blah...we ordered two bottles - he came back with 'the only one we have left'...I know my wines and this was clearly undrinkable...I let others taste it at our table and they agreed.  When I asked if he tasted it (with his tasting cup hanging around his neck) - he said he did.  Trust me, I watched him open the bottle, pour my tasting...he never tasted the stuff.  It was awful - this last bottle must have been stored in the alley.  He turned into a real prick in a hurry....first of all don't lie to me, and secondly don't treat the customer like dirt.  He took it back, brought out another 'recommendation' (Whitehall Lane Cab - it was better, but not great).  He poured it and never ever came back to our table - a real, walking, talking A-Hole.  Funny thing was, when the bill arrived we did not get the detailed breakdown - I swear to God I was charged for the bad bottle of Les Dix, but we were celebrating my wife's birthday and my daughter's engagement and I was not going to raise a stink.  They had the balls to put areas on the bill for tips for the Wine Steward and Waiter after already adding 18% for our group - no problem with 18% for a group of 10, but I put a big fat ZERO in for any other tips just because that Wine Steward was such a JACKASS!\n\nSalad cart is not what it used to be and is over-rated!\n\nYou can spend the same elsewhere and have a much better experience.\n\nNo space in the bar for a comfortable pre-dinner cocktail.\n\nHugo's is officially in the cellar for me and I cannot recommend it.  Food was not as good as Flemings."

Outstanding service from Greg Gene and Eddie. They were so fun. Martinis were recommended and enjoyed by all , from the raspberry lemon drop to the extra dirty, and those cute little ice buckets for your carafe!\n\nTable side salads were amazing. Was sad when my plate was empty. Everyone had some sort of steak or the duck. Excellent meal. I enjoyed the cellar cut prime rib. Outstanding. Still thinking about it the next day. The cherry on top was the bananas foster prepared right at your table. Best I've ever had.

Isn't that place super old and run down?\" Well it is! But this place is located slightly underground when u come in and look for it u go down a set of stairs and end up at the front of the restaurant. It has to be the most romantic place I have ever dined at. It's very old school with the brick walls and the servers dressed in two piece tuxs. The ladies receive a rose when u come in, so cute! The tables or booth have a cute candle light area with a single flower vase for your rose. And surprisingly, my man knew the manager who he worked with at a different restaurant, so it was nice to run into someone we knew there he kindly got us a booth in the corner which was perfect! Richard is the manager, and he was kind enough to buy us a drink for my mans birthday! \n\nNow onto the food/drink service - I got a raspberry cocktail (recommended by our sever, so didn't get the name) and my man just got the house cab. Our servers were David (I think) can't remember his name because he didn't really make an impression on us, sadly. But his partner Victor, lat me tell you, he's been there for years, he's an older gentlemen but such a great person! He was the highlight of our night! He was attentive and had a great sense of humor with everything. So thank you Richard for giving us his station just as u recommended he was really great. If u plan on going in, ask for victor u will love him!! Ok so u get bread service they drop off a basket w about three kinds of bread and then u get a cute rose shaped butter (to make it more romantic) hehe. Then we got seafood on ice for two as shown in picture below. It was good nothing special since it is a simple appetizer but it was still yummy. Then you order your entrees and you get a table side salad service! So Victor starts it for u and he just kinda goes down the list and u answer yes or no if u want it in your salad and he makes it right in front of u and he's funny you're guaranteed to laugh with him. Then you are served your salad, u get to choose from three kinds of dressings and he tosses it for u. It comes with every entree! So then u finish your salads and the busser comes and serves you a cute little raspberry sorbet on a cone it's called a \"palette cleanser\" I believe and that was cute and yummy. So they do that before u get your entree. Then u get your food and ugh it's amazing! It comes w a garlic mash and few veggies. I get a ribeye which I personally love ribeye so I always get that (done medium) and my man got a filet (medium rare), it has a name to his entree which we couldn't pronounce it n I let alone can't remember  lol but it all tasted great! (See photos) then we finish our food and move onto dessert. You get a complimentary platter of fig, chocolate strawberries, & apricot. And then we got a birthday dessert it was a chocolate cake that I didn't eat bc I don't like chocolate lol. But the dessert we did order was AMAZING!! It's called a banana froster and it is made table side. Omg I have never had anything so amaZing! See pictures. It has alcohol in it, bananas, and ice cream. U must get it if u dine there!! And before I forget, as Victor made our banana dessert, there was a couple next to us celebrating an anniversary, so with the left over he put it in a little bowl and hands it to the couple which I thought was a sweet touch! They did love the dessert and thanked us for ordering it hehe. My bf joked to myself and said \"should we split the bill for dessert haha. But not really we would never do that and it was their anniversary I'm so glad they enjoyed it as much as we did!! Overall everything was great from when u walk in to when u leave. Sorry if I don't go into too much detail about the food I didn't exactly study the menu and remember what was in it but the service was impeccable. We will definitely return! :) don't forget to ask for Victor!"

Let me be perfectly clear that it is in the Four Queens Hotel, a dive hotel on the old strip with the parking lot to match.  That said, when you step down the stairs into Hugo's Cellar you are in an entirely different environment.  Ladie's are greeted with a rose and the setting is very romantic (dark wood walls, candlelight).  Service is excellent and they have some great sommeliers.  They have a very good wine list and serve complementary bottled water, as well as a nice bread basket with cheese-toasted lavash and rose-shaped butter.  Their salads are the highlite, included with your meal and freshly prepared on a cart at your table.  Toppings like hearts of palm and bay shrimp and delicious dressings- try the orange walnut vinaigrette.  You are served an intermezzo sorbet to cleanse the palatte (raspberry on a mini cone).  Dinner is very traditional- chicken, fish, and steaks served with a potato and vegetable.  Not especially gourmet or cutting edge, but very old school classic and part of the experience.  They offer traditional desserts such as bananas foster prepared tableside, and they bring a complementary dessert of chocolate covered strawberries, dried figs, and apricots served with whipped cream.  This restaurant is great and remeniscent of old Vegas, definitely a must try."

During the time we looked at the menu, a server arrived with a bread basket.\n\nTwo of us decided to split the escargots en croute and I ordered the 10 ounce NY Strip steak done blue.  When the server came with the escargots, he cautioned us that the cast iron was very hot and we should let the escargots cool a bit so as not to burn ourselves.  As he was saying that, one of the escargots decided to \"blow off steam\" and it exploded out of the pan onto my sweater along with some garlic butter.  I took the snail and put it on my plate.  Our server removed the plate and brought me a clean one.  We all had a good laugh.  He was correct, they were very, very hot.  They're really not en croute--rather, they're topped with a piece of puff pastry.  My recommendation would be to put the pastry aside on your plate, eat the escargots, and then use the pastry to soak up the garlic butter remaining in the small wells.\n\nWhen our server cleared these dishes, he told us he mentioned to the chef what happened and there would be something extra at the end of the meal.  Then he brought the salad cart and one by one made the salad according to each person's desired items and dressing.  I was a bit disappointed that bleu cheese was not an option so I opted for the ranch and he put extra bleu cheese crumbles on top.  The salad was good and it certainly is an old school way of doing salad.\n\nIn between the salad and the main course, we were brought lemon sorbet in a miniature cone as a palate cleanser.  Nice touch.  The it was on to the main course.  Garlic mashed potatoes or rice were the two choices (there was a third I didn't understand what he said) and I chose the garlic mashed.  There was a small baked tomato and some white and green asparagus.  My steak was cooked properly and was tender.  The vegetables were were good but I couldn't help but think how nice it would be if they had a baked potato cart like the salad one.  What a way to get baked potatoes.\n\nFor dessert, we were brought a chocolate mousse cake to make up for the flying snail and the standard tray of chocolate covered strawberries, and some apricots, and figs dipped in white and regular chocolate. Two of us had coffee and we were brought a dish of chocolate sticks, cinnamon sticks, whipped cream, and sugar to go with the coffee.\n\nService was very good during the meal.  The rose for the lady in our party certainly is a nice touch.  Now that I finally did Hugo's Cellar, I can say it was A-OK but I'm not sure that I would come back again."

It is for the calm atmosphere, the elite service, and the food!  \n\nI've dined here twice in three years.  The first time impressed me and made me want to come back.  The second time (last week) made me list Hugo's as my favorite restaurant for a great salad and meat entree.\n\nBoth my wife and I agree that the made-to-order-at-your-table salad was absolutely  the best salad we've ever had!  I liked how they brought my cocktail (a gibson) in a small carafe - and it must have been a double - because the extra is stored in a dish of crushed ice on the table  so it doesn't get warm or watered down.  Now that's something very few places do for you.  A classy touch that's worth bonus points.\n\nOther Yelpers have validated that the food - from the bread basket to the chocolate-dipped fruit - is expertly prepared, presented, and tasty, so I won't go into that.  But I would like to compliment the staff.  We had a team of three servers waiting on us, and they were smooth, efficient, attentive, professional and warm.  Combined with the quiet atmosphere, subdued lighting, and luxurious cellar ambience, this is a place that will not disappoint if you're weary of the hustle and noise of the Strip.\n\nTo add frosting to the cake, you get a discount on one entree at Hugo's if you have a player's club card from the Four Queens Casino upstairs.  Free validated parking at Four Queens as well!  What more could you ask for on a great dining experience?"

The steak at Denny's tastes better.    And, to top it off, my friend's stomach started cramping after dinner.  He threw up his dinner and immediately felt better.

The menu is pricy but so much is included. A $53 filet also comes with mashed potatoes, vegetables, bread, salad, and sorbet in between. This is a steal in an expensive town like Las Vegas. The salad is prepared table-side, which is a very cool experience! I'd recommend their house orange vinaigrette. We were served by Carlos and Victor - great guys with lovely personalities and an unparalleled dedication to Hugo's patrons. \n\nThe food I'd rank a 4.5, just because we've had slightly better steak in our hometown of Houston.

Save yourself some money, buy your wife/girlfriend a rose somewhere else and take her to dinner with the money you save. We had reservations and were promptly seated. The service was slow and our waiter forgot to bring the drinks we ordered not once but twice. The salad cart was presented and was an uninspired performance by the waiter, it was just a job to make the salad---go-hum just another salad for a group of tourists. After a wait of about an hour after ordering our food it arrived hot and correct. We had a party of four and 3 of the 4 meals were good (not great ) and the fourth meal was a steak that was so full of gristle it could not be eaten. When we brought it to the attention of our waiter he basically blew us off, when we pressed our dissatisfaction with the steak for the second time he sent the manager over to our table, the manager reluctantly took the unbeaten steak off the bill but was obviously not happy about it. It was a marginal experience and I can not recommend Hugo's Cellar from a service standpoint, the food (3 out of 4 dishes) was good but not spectacular. There are too many other places in Vegas for fine dining."

We thought the Four Queens looked a little seedy as we walked in, but the clubby dark decor that greets you as you enter the cellar tells you this is a special place. Lighting is romantic and dim. The hostess greets each lady with a long stemmed red rose which they place In a vase for you. Various breads, lavash and spreads adorn your table along with butter shaped as rosebuds. \n\nService is spectacular. John, the world's friendliest sommelier has been there for 20 plus years and always seems to remember me (I've been there 3 dozen times in 9 years. Sometimes a few times a week, sometimes with longer spans) he makes great wine selections and we happen to share a great love of Perrier Jouet Fleur du Champagne. Even when I don't order wine, he stops by to visit, a fine British chap. They are also famous for their delicious martinis which come with a mini decanter. Your water glasses remain filled and your waiter is assisted by the salad carte guru and at least one bus boy, and of course the fabulous Sommelier. \n\nI dont order appetizers any longer but the hot stone app was fun. The salad carte which is old school table side has a dizzying array of ingredients and I always go with the parmesan pepper dressing. Usually, I pack half to go. Next an intermezzo of sorbet palate cleanser is served prior to entrees. I usually go for the sea bass en papillote prepared table side and steaming hot tender with a side of potatoes and vegetables. Other diners rave over the chateaubriand for two, prime rib, lobster virtually anything on the menu and enjoyed them thoroughly. Again I get half of my meal to go.\n\n I love this place so much that when my best friend called to ask where to make reservations for our party of 8 next week when visiting from Hawaii to celebrate her hubby making Full Bird Col in AF, his birthday and reception of a Bronze Star; there was no hesitation in my selection. I will call ahead as I frequently do to to ensure John has a bottle of Perrier Jouet Fleur du Champagne on ice to greet us. \n\nAfter dinner, a platter of dried fruits with white and dark chocolate and dipped strawberries with cream is presented. This is where all of my to go boxes come in: the bananas foster is DIVINE a show in and of itself with flames nearly scorching the ceiling as the perfectly caramelized bananas are served up over vanilla ice cream, the air perfumed with a hint of lingering cinnamon. Heavenly. Plus, I have great leftovers for lunch. \n\nThe service is professional, seasoned and on point without being obtrusive. When you leave, your rose is packed up for you along with wonderful memories of a fabulous meal. You could easily pay more at traditional a la carte steak houses but why? Hugo's is a veritable institution and you will walk away happy and sated. And wanting to return."

Yes, sir, this place is as good as I remembered.\n\nThis restaurant is in an unlikely location. It's inside Four Queens. Downtown Las Vegas has drastically improved over the last few years but admittedly I still hold my purse close to me when I walk around. I would highly suggest to valet your car because the garage elevator was broken and I had to go down four flights of stairs in heels! Hey, if you're going to a fancy schmancy restaurant, you might as well splurge on valet!\n\nOnce you get to the restaurant, ladies are given a single red rose. The restaurant is dark and has a old school Vegas feel. We were seated in a booth, and I appreciated the romantic ambiance. Waiters were all wearing tuxedos. They even poured water with a certain flair.\n\nMy favorite part about this place is the table side prepared salad. It comes free with your entree and you get an array of toppings to choose from! They give a cute mini raspberry sorbet to cleanse your palette. I ordered the ribeye steak and my husband got the Chilean sea bass. We both savored every single bite and still had leftovers to take home! \n\nI'm not sure if it's because they knew it was our anniversary but we got hooked up with lots of desserts! We got an assortment of chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots to dip in whipped cream. Then we got a chocolate mousse cake that was melt-in-your-mouth amazing! Oh my, my mouth is watering just writing about it.\n\nIf you're looking for romance, good food and great service, you can't go wrong with Hugo's Cellar!"

Think close booths with pretty light fixtures, dim lighting, people's heads huddled together, soft whispers. It's that kind of place.

The service is impeccable - old school charm meets modern dining, like free salad (!) and a complementary light sorbet afterwards to cleanse your palette. \n\nMost memorable attribute?

Kind of out of place downtown, but still a great atmosphere away from the downtown chaos.\n\nDinners range from 40 to 60 bucks but that is misleading because you get a Huge table side salad where you pick the toppings + bread + 2 sides + sorbet to cleanse your palate + dessert sampler = Great bang for your buck.\n\nRecommend hitting the mob museum for a few hours then dinner here for another few hours and you have a whole night of entertainment!"

            "review": "We ate here last night and, sad to say, it was less than stellar. We called for a reservation at 5 hoping to get in at 7:00. It was short notice I know. At first, Rich, the manager said not until 9:00. I said ok we'll go somewhere else. Then he said we could come at 6:30. Great! I wish we hadn't gotten in.\n\nLet me start off my saying this is not a cheap restaurant by any means and we knew that. When we walked in as per usual, they gave me a rose. They give Roses to all the female guests.\n\nWe ordered drinks which were fine. A little light, but not bad. For an appetizer, we had the escargot which was really good. I was none to pleased when the dirty dishes remained on our table for an extended length of time. I finally stacked them and put them by the edge of the table hoping one of the 3 people taking care of us would notice.\n\nErik was our head waiter. He disappeared and I called over Oscar to order a bottle of wine. He stated he could not take orders for bottles of wine only the Sommelier could. We had to wait for him. That was about a 15 minute wait. I've known the sommelier there for years and mentioned to him I wasn't too pleased with the service so far. He said I should tell Rich, the manager. I decided to wait it out and see how things progressed. They went downhill from there.\n\nI ordered the Veal Oscar and my husband ordered the filet. First, they give you a salad made table side. It is fine. It is a lettuce salad with your choice of dressing and toppings. \n\nMy veal came and it was awful. It tasted fishy. I didn't say anything to my husband, but told him to try a bite. He said the identical thing. I tried his steak. It was dry on the ends and you needed a lot of sauce to get it down.\n\nI had to track down Erik again as I was not paying $49 for bad veal. When I was able to get him and told him the veal was bad, he got rather indignant and stated that the only thing he could get to me was the prime rib. I guess it was sitting there. I did not want prime rib. He got very angry, took the plate and walked away. I just shared my husband's steak with him.\n\nI told John, the sommelier, about the altercation with the waiter. He said to tell Rich. I told Rich what happened and even he didn't offer me something I would like better. He said he would give me his card before I left for a free meal. Yeah right. This meal should have been free. They gave us a desert for our anniversary and you could tell it was not fresh, it had been pulled from the freezer. There was ice falling off of it.\n\nWe got the bill and they did take the drinks and my veal off, but charged us $17.00 for the salad that was supposed to come with the meal and that was just wrong!\n\nBefore he delivered the bill, Erik came back as I'm sure he was told to by the manager to  make it right. Instead he began arguing with me. Hey jerk I'm the customer.\n\nSo for one entree and one desert we ended up with a $129.00 bill. Of course, I couldn't find Erik again to discuss the charge for the salad. On the bill, there is a place for 2 tips. One for the server and one for the sommelier. I gave john 20% of what the wine cost. I gave Erik $1. He didn't deserve anything. Never saw the manager again either. So much for the card for the meal.  This was totally unacceptable for a restaurant of their caliber. I've been eating here since the 1980's, but I won't be going back. Too many other good restaurants in Vegas to choose from. This was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant in Vegas!"

In my search for one I came across Hugo's. The reviews sold me on trying this place. I called in the morning to make reservations but was told the restaurant did not have any employees in until 2:00 PM. So if this is where you are thinking of going reserve ahead of time or you'll have to wait until 2, and hope you get lucky with an early dinner reservation. The only time they had available for us was 9:30 PM. We got to our reservations 30 minutes early and they immediately accommodated us. The host even mentioned he remembered talking to me this afternoon. That definately impressed us. We were greeted by our waiter very quickly, he and one other waiter made sure our night went smoothly. I have to say their service was great! Right away we were given 3 types of fresh bread and butter. That was followed by a salad made at your table side by the waiter. We ordered the Filet and Shrimp, and the Filet le beuf (I think that's how you spell it). His was medium well, and mine was medium. Both steaks were delicious, but we liked the medium one best. That's not all, they brought us dessert! Fruits dipped in chocolate and whipped cream. Not to mention they also gave us a chocolate lava cake in celebration of our anniversary. For our entire dinner, a glass of red cabernet and one cranberry vodka (for the Mr., taxes and tip, we spent approx $170.00. We are super stuffed right now. My fiance is currently laying in bed in a food coma lol...I can't forget to mention they gift a red rose to every woman when you check in. At the end of the meal they wrap the stem with foil paper so you won't get water on yourself and for easy travel. We will most definately be returning! \n\nThank you to Rawshad, Glenn, and the busser (sorry I didn't catch your name) for making tonight special."

The breadbasket is fantastic, as well. You can find a better steak in Vegas, but you can't beat the ambience at this treasure. Where else does each lady receive a red rose upon arrival?

            "review": "In my opinion there are much better steakhouses here in Las Vegas, maybe not for the price for quantity aspect, but at least for the quality of their steaks.  I went here on the recommendation of a long time family friend, and I failed to find all the great things he told me about.  The service was fine, but nothing spectacular.  The steak was cooked properly but to me lacked the flavor or of high quality steak.  The salad they make for you at the table was nice, but again, nothing special.  I'll be honest in that I felt that the sides that came with my steak were better and more flavorful than the steak itself.\n\nThe highlight of the meal tonight was their sommelier, a Mr. John Simmons.  I told him what type of wines I like, what I was having for dinner, and then he suggested a price range and went to find a nice bottle for me and my cousin.  His choice was from a winery in Sonoma, CA that I had never heard of, and the price for the bottle was at the lower end of the suggested range, a pleasant surprise.  He also seemed to have the most personality amongst all the servers waiting on the table.\n\nOn the whole, if you want a romantic date spot, you can do worse than this place, where they do give roses to all the ladies that come in.  It can be rather intimate, and is quiet enough that you can have a nice conversation without having to shout.  In the end, I seriously doubt I will be coming back here as there are several other steakhouses in Vegas that I prefer."

It is a charming and cozy restaurant that offers all ladies a single red rose, romantic lighting, tuxedoed waiters and impeccable service.  Unfortunately for us, there were several families with small children dining at the same time and the shrieks and cries were distracting and obtrusive.  Despite this fact, we did our best to enjoy ourselves.  \n\nWe both agreed that the table-side salad was one of the most delicious we'd ever had.  It's a weird thing to say about a salad but it's true!  After the salad we were offered a delightful sorbet on a tiny cone to cleanse the palate.  We both enjoyed a beef entr\u00e9e: for me the filet mignon wrapped in bacon and served over a lump crab cake and for him a huge slab of prime rib.  \n\nThe prices are very reasonable considering that salad, entr\u00e9e, sides and a dessert tray are included.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and look forward to returning to Hugo's again during our next trip to Las Vegas!"

Then you have found the right place.\n\nLocated in The Four Queens on Fremont St, you walk down some stairs and walk into a lobby with a few tables and a fireplace with a fire going. Everything is dim and all by candlelight which I love immediately. I came here with a party of 6 for my Birthday dinner and there were 3 ladies (including me) in our group and we each got a rose! How sweet. We had a reservation for 630pm and we were promptly seated.\n\nOur server was great and walking into this restaurant, you definitely get that old school vibe like how it was back in the 50's or 60's and that's how the server's were too. They wore tuxes and they were just a notch above. I ordered the Filet Mignon and it was cooked perfectly with a great juicy flavor. Oh yeah, and it was huge so definitely didn't finish it. LOL. When you order an entree, you get the pleasure of having a salad made at your table. It was a different guy that does this and he was hilarious! The salad was made just to how I like and it was great. After we were done with the salad, we were served sorbet to \"cleanse our palates\" and that was super tasty too! After our entree, we were served a selection of dessert items (chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots). And since it was my birthday, I got a slice of pecan cheesecake which was ridiculous! And I got sung too which made it even better!! Oh yeah and no cell service down here since it's in the \"cellar\". Kind of nice!\n\nThis restaurant is the epitome of old school Vegas style and the romantic feel of it is top notch. The food fits right in and the service was impeccable. I can not wait to come back with just the Hubs for a romantic date night!"

I am not sure the scene is for me but the saving grace is definitely Hugo's Cellar.  This place was packed with a variety of folks and the atmosphere was classic and romantic.  It definitely looked like it had not been updated in 20 years with the blue tableclothes and blue tapestry on the chairs.  I took my rose as I walked in the door and we were seated on time for our reservation.  \n\nAll in all, the food was good...not mind blowing but good.  It is honestly more about the atmosphere than the food and that is what we wanted on the first night of our trip.  I loved, loved the tableside salad.  It was purely delicious with creamy peppercorn dressing and all of my favorite toppings.  I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing so that I could enjoy my entree.  My husband had the Filet Atlantis and I had the Seabass prepared with crab and shrimp sauce.  Mine was alright but I would probably go for the meat if you dine here.  My husband's steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and had a nice flavor.  Being from Texas, we get good meat all the time and while his steak was good, it was not the best cut I have had.  \n\nWe finished our meal with the complimentary chocolate dipped strawberries that were divine!  Oh, and another great thing is that the wine list is priced extremely well.  The value far exceeds most restaurants in Vegas.  We ordered an $85 bottle of Jordan Cabernet, which is a steal in a restaurant.  And, the Sommilier was quite charming with his British accent and all.

And almost every table was sat.\n\nThe Ambiance:\nDark colors, Low ceilings, Low lighting\nMostly tables, I think they do this to maximize occupancy\nWould have been better (IMO) if they had big cushy booths along the walls to give it more of an intimate, private type feeling\nThe tables are so close together we might as well be having dinner with the people next to us since we ended up having a conversation with them about entrees and desserts\nSeveral times I was bumped by guests passing or by the salad cart... Seriously... if you're going to have salad and dessert carts... make sure there's adequate room in between ALL the tables and chairs so as not to disturb your patrons.  \nLoud.... Don't try to have a quiet conversation because you won't hear the person next to you.  \n\nThe Food:\nOverall.... Very Good, but there's lots of places in Vegas to go for Very Good and Excellent meals, so food alone is not a good reason to go back here. Now if you are staying on / near Fremont street... Yes, this is a very good steakhouse.\n\nThe Bread to start... ok...nothing super extraordinary.  The butter served with it was in a flower shape which was nice but it was rock hard.\n\nThe Salad...included with your entr\u00e9e order ... made to order, table side.... It's fun to get to pick what goes in your salad and watch it get made right at your table...  You can choose your dressing and if you pick Caesar you can have an anchovy in your salad diced up.  I opted for the orange walnut vinaigrette which was tasty but other than that... it was just a salad.  \n\nThe Palate Cleanser... included with your entr\u00e9e order..... ours was a lemon sorbet served in a mini ice cream cone.  Very refreshing and fun.  Personally... I like mine served in a long stemmed glass of sparkling wine ... it's classier than an ice cream cone but then I'm a princess and I know it.\n\nThe Steaks... prepared perfectly to order and juicy.\n\nThe Sides ... included with your entr\u00e9e order.... meh.  Mine came with red potatoes and mixed veggies.... The red potatoes were dry and crumbly...  The mixed veggies were something that looked like and tasted like it was from frozen Green Giant mixed veggies.  My mom opted for the mashed potatoes and they were gummy.\n\nThe Bananas Foster... AMAZING!  This is the reason to come here.  In fact, if this restaurant were closer to Henderson, we'd go here just for this as often as we could.  It is sinfully rich and decadent.  (Of course, you have to like bananas and rum.) This dessert is HUGE.  Big enough for 4 people to share.  The preparer (Victor?) was a showman and talkative so he was fun... be prepared for lots of flame and lots of fun when you order this.\n\nThe B-day cake.... They provided a chocolate b-day cake for Mom, and it was rich dark chocolate...  tasty and a very nicely presented.\n\nThe Dessert... included in the meal... YES, included not extra.... chocolate covered strawberries and white chocolate dipped figs and a side of whip cream to dip.  So.. you don't really need to order dessert.\n\nThe Service:\nVery Polite\nThe Red Rose for each female is a sweet gesture.\nThey have a lot of people seeing to \"your\" needs. There's so much activity in the room with the salad and dessert carts and bread and water attendant and the other patrons coming and going ... that again... it's not a quiet dinner but it is entertaining.\n\nThe Price:\nPricey but not ridiculous particularly for the amount of food we ordered... and we all took home \"doggy bags\".\nFor 4 people where 2 of us split a half bottle of wine and 2 opted for non-alcoholic beverages... the total with tax and gratuity was about $85/pp."

Made it a point for just my wife and I to come back again.  Basically it was the same thing.  Only problem was the table next to us.  4 ladies doing their bachelorette thing.  Very noisy and at time vulgar. A older couple who was seated next to them asked to move and 3 persons who sat at that same table walked out.  Even the maitre d asked them to keep it down.  I don't fault the restaurant because they did everything right to us.  Just wish others where more considerate when your spending over $200 for dinner."

My bf and I went with another couple who had previously dined here before on several occasions. As we entered, both Karen and I received a long stemmed red rose which I found hilarious for some reason.\n\nMy dirty martini was pretty damn good and so was the bacon wrapped filet mignon served on crab legs along with garlic mashed potatoes. Oh yes, I almost forgot, the table side salad. Our salad maker, I think was named Kenny? made a great salad and I had every damn topping short of onions that he offered. \n\nThe only thing we missed out on was dessert but time was an issue. I'd definitely recommend going here for the \"old-school\" steak experience, especially with good friends who can appreciate the vibe..."

            "review": "Ours was a party of six, a very special surprise Birthday celebration.  I hadn't been to Hugo's in over 20 years, and didn't remember much about the restaurant.\nThe service was wonderful from the moment we entered.  As others have mentioned, the ladies I the group were greeted with a long stem rose.\nService was prompt and very good.  I think every employee at Hugo's stopped by the table to wish our birthday guest a happy b-day.  Nice.  Food was served in a timely manner, and was great (except the tough, stringy, white asparagus-no one liked it).  A small pyramid shaped mousse cake was presented to the Birthday guest, along with the dipped fruit dessert.  Very nice!  Everyone had more than enough food, and left very satisfied.\n\nThe ONLY hitch was after we had left the restaurant, and went to pick up our car in Valet.  We took our validated ticket to where we had dropped the car off.  After standing, being ignored, for way too long, I hailed the valet (Lamont).  He barked \"you're in the WRONG PLACE\".  He said we needed to take the ticket to a window half way across the property!  I am disabled, and had walked about as far as I could - and explained this to him.  He said that \"that was where I had to go if I wanted my car\".  He said, very sarcastically, that if I \"couldn't possibly\" walk there, that my guest would have to schlep the ticket there, and ask them to bring the car to 'this side'.   I was totally embarrassed!  The Birthday guest saw my anguish, and she offered to go turn the ticket in for me.  She returned, some 5-10 min later, and we bagan the wait.  Nearly 15 minutes later valet, Lamont, walked by and said that our car is sitting at Valet - across the building.  I made the painful trek with the help of my guest.  More embarrassment!  I was nearly in tears from the pain by the time we got to the other Valet area.  Needless to say, my evening was ruined!\nNONE of this should have happened.  I had gone thru the trouble of visiting the valet area, and walking to Hugo's, then back to valet, some 5 hours earlier.  Knowing that I can only walk a short distance, I wanted to make sure that I would be able to make the walk.  I didn't want my disability to interfere with the other guests enjoyment in any way.  Instead, I was made into a gimp spectacle.  \nI doubt that we will EVER return for more abuse!"

Tucked away inside of the Four Queens casino, you go down the stairs into a lowly lit beautiful dining experience. It starts with a staff member handing the women in your party a fresh rose. You are greeted by multiple staff, it is a very warm and friendly environment. Plan on spending some time when you come here, your dinner is served in stages and it is well worth the wait. They have an excellent menu of fine dining, from steaks to fish. I love the experience of the table side salad preparation. You can choose from a large array of additions from anchovies, pinenuts, boiled eggs and artichoke hearts. If you would like to have wine, the sommelier will come and discuss it with you, and give you recommendations. Also know that they do have half bottles of wine if you just want a glass or two. I had the fillet wrapped in bacon topped with crabmeat.  The steak was very tender, even though I ordered it well done! They offer a complimentary dessert tray, with fresh fruit dipped in chocolate. This restaurant is an excellent choice for a fine dining experience and a great date night!"

The house Cab was just average, but they brought me a HIGHBALL full of Macallan for the single shot price, which was nice.\n\nWe both ordered the salad cart, which was awesome.  The dressings were not too heavy and the selection of veggies to compose your salad from was outstanding.  For dinner, I ordered the 16 ounce NY Strip med rare with the blue cheese creme topping.  The wife got Hugos chicken and we both got special vegetables.  A few cool things about Hugos - First the setting is great, quaint little brick basement with low ceilings and a 70s feel - they bring you sorbet between courses to cleanse the palate.  When we told them it was our anniversary, they brought us a little Luxor-shaped mousse with a candle.  Very cool.  Also, as has been mentioned many times, every lady gets a single rose.  My wife was so tickled by it she brought it home to Denver on the plane.\n\nSo, in summary,  good food and fun ambiance.  Go do it once if you want good food on Fremont."

I know this is not a typical \"kid-friendly\" restaurant (no kid's menus here) so I wasn't sure how staff would react to her dining with us. My niece is generally well behaved, and LOVES her food, so we figured she would enjoy a meal here. After getting dressed up in our \"special occasion clothes\" (as the child calls them) we headed downtown. We made the reservation for 7:00, because this was our arrival day and we weren't sure how long it would take for the deuce bus to make it from the strip to Freemont Street; we wanted to make sure we had plenty of time. We arrived shortly after 6:00 PM, nearly a full hour before our reservation time. We were hungry, so we decided to check and see if they could accommodate our early arrival. As soon as we walked in the Ma\u00eetre D greeted us and singled out my niece, complementing her dress and calling her the prettiest lady in the room. After handing each of us a rose, they escorted us to our table. After we placed our order, bread and drinks were brought to our table. The bread was superb, with the Lavosh becoming a particular favorite. As other reviewers have mentioned, the table side salad service is delightful. Their orange honey vinaigrette was outstanding. I would return to this restaurant for the salad alone, and I am most certainly not a salad person.  Shortly after our salad plates were cleared, a palate cleansing sorbet was brought out. Our entrees were brought out shortly after this. I ordered the prime rib, which was excellent. It was juicy and tender - it practically melted in my mouth. My best friends each ordered the fillet mignon and my niece ordered the scallops. Everyone raved about their particular orders. After dinner, the complimentary chocolate covered fruit was delivered to our table, along with the desert tray. We decided on a cr\u00e8me brulee (as my best friend can't turn down cr\u00e8me brulee when it's available) and the cherries jubilee, as we knew my niece would enjoy watching the preparation. The creme brulee was average - not bad by any means, but not particularly outstanding. The cherries jubilee was very good, but I think I'd prefer something else off the menu next time. \n\nHugo's Cellar was a big hit with our group. All staff was welcoming and went out of their way to speak to my niece - my concerns regarding her presence were completely unfounded. When asked about what her favorite part of the trip was all weekend (a weekend that included going to see a show and the Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N) she said the \"fancy dinner\". We will definitely visit Hugo's again, but will probably limit ourselves to a splurge once a year. Cannot recommend this place highly enough!"

I also understand that It was getting close to closing so we get that the staff may be tired or not on their game. \n\nMy big pet peeve is the hostess staring at you like she has no idea why you are coming towards her. If I ran a restaurant the hostess would lead the conversation not wait for you to inform her that you are there to eat at her restaurant. They presented my Wife with a rose which was a nice touch but the stem looked as if it came from a corn field. A little cut would have been better. We felt we had a sunflowers towering over us the whole time. \n\nWe were seated and met with a couple different staff members who all tried to get us to buy alcohol and then had a look of disappointment when we declined as we always do. \n\nAfter a longer than I would have liked wait, we were asked to give our order. I have a Strip Steak and my Wife the prime rib. Before hand they brought out a salad bar and made our salad's before us which was nice. Everything was fresh and was well prepared. \n\nThen they presented us with what can only be described as a tart, raspberry sorbet.  This was a pallet cleaner, I decided to leave mine dirty after one bite. \n\nOur steaks finally came out and the first thing we noticed is how hot they were. I've been to enough steak houses to know that it was an abnormal temperature. We wondered if they had put it in a microwave. Pure speculation. Though the steaks in general were good but my strip steak was just a little tough in the initial cut. \n\nWe declined dessert and handed the waiter our CC to pay. It must have taken him 10 minutes to come back. Again too long and he took my ID with him. I just feel like when you're running a business there should always be someone there to take the money. \n\nAnyway, a three for me. No Lawry's that's for sure. That place knows how to run a restaurant. I wanted to give it a four but too many details overlooked."

You definitely can't miss the salad cart, and if you want a steak, they make a good one.  I've more recently experienced some of their chicken dishes which I actually prefer over their steaks.  For dessert, we've had the Cherries Jubilee and Bananas Foster, both are great but I'd lean towards the Bananas Foster.  The only real issue with Hugo's is in the last 10 years the service has gone downhill.  It's not terrible but just not as attentive as it used to be.  There are better restaurants in Vegas at this price point but if you're going on a date and want some old school Vegas feel, this is a great restaurant.  We're likely to go back every time we're in Vegas and hopefully it will pick back up to the level it used to be."

Our waiter was so friendly, not pushy and so kind. We had 8:30pm reservations. My sister and I. Appetizer was spinach/artichoke dip. Very good flavor, but runnier than most we've ever had. The salads, yes, they do table side,molts of choices, excellent display and server. Sister ordered triple seafood sampler, and I had the prime rib. She really liked her food, me, my prime rib was cooked perfect to \"medium\", but not very warm/hot. I did not want to send it back, ( really, at Hugo's), no, I just couldn't. The red, garlic mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus were good. Just so disappointed in the meat. Prime rib just also didn't have a lot of flavor. I like that the au jus is served on the side so it's not swimming in it. They do give roses to all the ladies upon arriving and wrap them for you on leaving. It is Old World like in Al Capone days, but so so neat a place. It is not cheap, but do not mind paying for an excellent meal, no matter where I'm traveling. Just was disappointed, as sister had been there many times and I just can't return. I do not believe a chef should send out just warm food, especially a steak."

Were it based on service it would be 4-4.5 stars easily. \n\nThe occasion was for a birthday dinner, and we had a few drinks, followed by more drinks.. so that helps here with this review :) In addition I am a fan of \"Beef Wellington\" and they had a serving of 'Individual Beef Wellington' on the menu. That was actually what solidified my choice to check it out for the big dinner. \n\nIt was myself and a couple of friends, which seemed about right.. but I have to say that it is a very intimate setting.. so it would be very well suited for a date or a couple having a date. Nonetheless, it's worth checking out if you are a group of friends that likes quality food. \n\nThe restaurant itself is in a lower level of the \"Four Queens\" Casino... The casino itself may be a bit long in the tooth and has some serious smoking areas still allowed, so be wary of that if you are sensitive to smoke.. because there is A LOT of it. \n\nDown below where the restaurant is located, its dimly lit, old-school style and comfortable feeling. Above where the casino is, its a bit dank, old and crappy.. lol. A friend compared it to snorkeling - in that it looks beautiful when you are down below, and when you raise your head above water, its a little less than exciting.. in fact a dump.. haha. \n\nAnyhow.. our waiter was awesome in relaying the specials. They create a custom salad for you table side then serve your items as ordered, and the meal is followed up by fruits dipped on white chocolate. It was nice, but I could have doe without dried apricots dipped in chalky white chocolate... I just didnt eat it. \n\nI opted for a coffee desert drink as I was getting drunk and needed caffeine :] \n\nSo give it a try if you like something with a bit more style. be prepared to drop a few bucks, but make a night of it and head downtown after for some drinks and people watching."

Located on Fremont street, in the basement of  the 4 Queens Hotel, this is one place in Vegas you should not pass up.\n\nYou begin your evening checking in with the Maitre D', and grabbing a seat in their small but well appointed bar area.  When your table is ready, they give any women in your party long stemmed red roses to set the ambiance for the evening before leading you through their intimate dining area to your table.\n\nYour wait staff will stop by, introduce themselves, and get drink orders. (Yes, I said wait staff - you will have three waiters jumping to get you whatever you need to make your dinner fabulous.)  They will also offer to send over their award winning Sommelier to advise on your wine options.  They have a well appointed wine cellar, and a wide variety of bottles to choose from.  \n\nAfter your orders are placed, and your appetizers are finished, one of your waiters will bring a cart to the table, and make each person a generously portioned tossed salad, right at your table.  Their salad dressings are all wonderful, and they have a nice selection of salad toppers to choose from.\n\nAfter salad, you will be given a miniature sorbet ice cream cone as a palette cleanser before the main entree arrives, and this is when your taste buds will do a dance of joy.  Their food is AMAZING.  Their prime rib is some of the best in town, but their Raspberry Chicken is my whole reason for going to Hugo's.  It is DIVINE.  My wife loves their Beef Wellington, and my in-laws both love the Queen's Lobster.\n\nAfter your meal is complete, you waiters will bring a tower of chocolate dipped fruit to share while you peruse the dessert menu. I can't comment on the dessert offerings because their food is so incredible I've never been able to save enough room to actually contemplate ordering one.  I can say that the chocolate dipped figs and strawberries are delightful.\n\nThe best part is that at Hugo's, their prices do not match the extravagance of their service.  An average evening with dinner, a shared appetizer, and 2 glasses of wine or adult beverages, and our average ticket is about $150 after tip.  For a dining experience like Hugo's, I have spent easily twice that much at other establishments.  Do yourself and your wife a favor, and treat yourselves.  it is worth every penny."

            "review": "I chose this place because of the positive reviews. Either everyone else has really different standards, somethings has changed or some of these review are, well, maybe inflated? \n\nAny way here is a list of the good, the bad and the ugly:\n\nGood: \nThe ambiance*\nThe martinis*\nThe salad\nThe server pouring water\nThe seared prime rib\n\nBad:\n1) The table-side manner. The waiter who greeted us (Jaime) was clearly in training as another waiter (Greg) was visibly agitated by whatever he believed Jaime wasn't doing correctly and it was awkward for everyone. \n\n2) The timing. There were two of us, the place was calmly busy, and yet we were seated at a place with 4 settings and had one of the other waiters reaching across multiple times us as they removed each fork, knife, napkin, etc. \n\n3) The training. Jaime showed how green he was when I told him I was considering the Ahi Tuna. He said it could be prepared the three ways the menu described. Hmmmm, I pretty sure you are not going to have your ahi tuna steak breaded or any of the other ways listed. More training needed before being on the floor.\n\n4) The seating. I've waited tables for 7 years and you don't seat a new waiter with three tables back to back, especially at a labor intensive restaurant like this. \n\n5) The host. One skill a host should have is being good with faces. We checked in a bit early and the waiter said to come back at our exact time. Since the bar was very tiny, we went back upstairs until the exact time. He had no idea who we were when we came back 15 minutes later. \n\n7) The seafood. The second waiter (Greg - too agro, not the right personality for a waiter) came over and so I asked him if the Ahi was good. He said no. Points for being honest. He suggested the $54 Chilean Sea Bass instead. Given that the only other seafood item (I don't eat beef) of interest was the $85 King crab legs, and I usually love Chilean Sea Bass, I went for it. He said it came with a \"shrimp sauce\" on top. I asked for it on the side because why ruin a $54 fish entree with a sauce? This ended up being by FAR the WORST Chilean Sea Bass I've ever eaten. I see why they have you pour a very thick cream \"shrimp sauce\" on top of it. It didn't taste remotely like Sea Bass. It seemed like it had been boiled in water for an hour and then pan seared. It was total mush and completely flavorless. It was served with red potatoes which were also pretty flavorless. THIS was the #1 seafood recommendation?!?\n\n8) The timing - when Greg had told me not to go with the Ahi, I asked for another minute to take a look at the menu. Then no one came back for about 20 minutes so we could finish ordering. We finally got our salads after being there an hour (we did not get apps) because Jaime was busy making salads for other tables ahead of us, which why I mentioned #4. \n\n9) The bathrooms. There are no bathrooms in the restaurant, which is subdued and dim like a steak place should be. So you have to go up into the blaring loud casino and walk quite a ways to the bathroom.\n\n10) Attention to detail. My martini was served in a glass with a big crack down the side and I had to request a new glass. I didn't realize olives could age, but these \"green\" olives were nearly colorless and seemed to have also lost their olive flavor. We were also not given wine menus and had to ask for them. The waiters also did not refill our drinks when they were empty. \n\n11) The bread. There were 3 types of \"bread\" in the basket. One tasted like a giant, very stale, almost moist, saltine cracker. The other two were super cheap little rolls you would get at a Sizzler buffet. \n\n12) Honesty. I already had an issue with this given the low-quality of food they are serving for the 5-star prices, but another thing that was directly misleading was that they say on the menu they serve bottled water. Yes, it comes out of a large glass container with a screw top that is I suppose technically a bottle, but it's clearly refilled tap water. And - there is no ice in the drinks so plan on warm water with your meal. \n\nIf we were not there to celebrate my husband's birthday, I would have addressed these items in person with a manager. \n\nMy takeaway is that this place is trying to get by with an \"old school\" steakhouse vibe and not even trying when it comes to a good wait staff, quality food or the kind of attention to detail that should be second nature for what they are charging."

We journey to Vegas multiple times a year and have tried many of the so called \"best\" in vegas spots via YELP/Tripadvisor. \n\n Honestly, They dont compare to Hugos in price, service, ambiance, and quality of dishes. Hugos is a classic and I hope never changes. What folks need to realize, is that places like Hugos dont hardly exist anymore. So you better help keep these places alive.\n\nA classic top notch service gourmet room in 2013? Nearly impossible to find. Hugos is one of the best in Vegas for their traditional menu (Old School but in a good way) offering Steak, Seafood,Prime Ribs, Beef Wellington, Chateaubriand and they succeed flawlessly in delivering excellent food and and service. Hugos You found customers for life.\n\nService: We were greeted in a warm and friendly manner. The waiters were professional and top notch.  Food was spaced and paced adequately and they had the mandatory 3 person wait staff present for all tables. They also prepared custom table-side salad for ALL orders. Do I want shrimp in that salad? Heck yes. Fresh cracked pepper? A must! I get to choose my toppings? My my my. \n\nFood:\nWife and I had the Prime Rib, which were excellent in terms of quality and price. The Prime Rib was cooked well and came with all the accoutrements. Solid piece not to mention the custom salad cart. \n\nBread: Warm and soft. They had really yummy bread. Probably shouldn't have filled up on it. \n\nAtmosphere:\nNothing fancy, but clean and orderly. It was probably the nicest spot in the 4 Queens Casino. Its downstairs by the poker tables if your lost."

And while you are there, Hugo's Cellar is a must-taste. Our waiter told us that the Rat Pack used to be regulars. The place really feels like a cellar with a 60s or 70s vibe which I completely loved. I hope they never modify or revamp the interior because it is retro and priceless. Also, they give a rose to the women as they come in, and another when you leave! So classy! I had the Filet de Bouef Atlantis and it was seriously worth every calorie and fat gram it may have contained. It was probably the best steak I have ever had in my LIFE. Wrapped with bacon, in a sauce with crabmeat-it was so tasty that I could not believe my taste buds. I am not to one to \"eat it and tweet it\" since I find it rude and obnoxious when people can't put their phones down long enough to be courteous to others at the table, but I do wish I had taken a picture of my filet because it is one of my fondest memories of Vegas (and there are many; it was a great trip!). Our reservations were made in advance but I think you have to get them pretty early, so I would recommend making them WELL in advance if you want to go. Don't miss Hugo's!"

With reservations secured we are seated in a private room in the back called the party room. Actually very nice 10 Top in secluded gated off area.\n\nWaiters are on us along with John the long time sommellier.  Reconmending a very nice Cabernet we are on to the main event. All entrees come with the Table side Salad made to order with your options of at least 8-10 accutrements. Salad for each of us was cold, fresh,  and dressings and overall presentation and taste was top notch. Delicious. \n\nEntrees go for the beef folks and if you do go for the beef go for the PRIME RIB!...  Couple of NY Strips were on a scale of 1-10 about a 7... Good top shelf quality but not the blow me away one.  A bone in Filet was also 7 out of 10 as was the rib eye.  The balance of the group ordered the Giant Cut of prime rib and folks this sucker could tip over Fred Flintstone's car.   Big rich in color, flavor & Texture and served with  Nice Auju.  All entrees also included choice of potatoe and grilled vegetables.  Too much food for one man to finish.\n\nSome after dinner drinks, and coffees were enjoyed without desert. \n\nService and atmosphere in downtown vegas was fantastic and it was truly and enjoyable experience across the board.  1 star off as Steaks were just miss on greatness but price points exceptional, wine list reasonable and prime rib KILLER."

            "review": "My friends and I traveled to Vegas for an annual guys' trip and decided to check out Hugo's Cellar, hearing so many great things about it.  We certainly got a night that we will never forget... we arrived roughly 20 minutes before our reservation and asked to be seated early and they said it would be a few short minutes.   \n\nIt turned out to be about 20 minutes, which we normally would not have cared about, but in the restaurant waiting area, we weren't alone.   We were with... the smell.   A cheap potpourri fragrance that my 89 year old grandmother would find offensive and just a hint of smoke became the topic of conversation all evening.  We tried to talk about sports and anything to distract us, but we couldn't ignore this scent.  It had effects on all of us.   \n\nOur friend Adam, who is usually a very nice man, completely snapped and yelled at his friends and stormed out, with the smell affecting his mood and well-being.  It even gave our friend Brooks diarrhea, which was another unfortunate incident for him, but welcomed for us.  \n\nWe then were finally able to sit down at a very lovely table in the old-school, classy restaurant.  We were treated to a lovely and generous assortment of breads which we ate with aggression and stuffed in our nose to try to wash our nose hairs of the clinging scent.  Amongst the breads was a toasted lavish that was inseminated with cheese that was just delightful.    Also in the breads was... ahhhhh... I'm sorry I just can't stop thinking about that smell and how pungent and poisonous it was.  \n\nWe then ordered our drinks and we were very pleased by portions and quality of the dirty martinis.  There were at least 2 helpings per serving and it helped dull our senses and killed some of the brain cells that held our memories of the smell, but not all of them of course, it was just too overpowering.  \n\nOur friend Kevin ordered a Gin and Tonic and it was such a special cocktail that they spent 45 minutes preparing it until he was eventually served it right before he polished off his steak.  He couldn't enjoy as much bread as us because he was afraid of choking on it due to the lack of fluids in his mouth to help digest the carbohydrates.  But he said it was worth the wait.\n\n... I can't get that smell out of my head.\n\nThen it was time for the salad cart.   This was a very cool idea and felt classy to build our own salad to our liking.  I opted for the traditional oil and vinegar with all the trimmings and I enjoyed it immensely.  Many of our friends went with the fishy dressing, at least that is what I believe it was called.   I believe it was a sort of trout/salmon/seaweed mixture that tasted like the ocean at low tide, if you enjoy that sort of thing.  It's only redeeming quality is the fact that the fishy taste infiltrated our nasal passages as well, to help put the smell out of our minds, at least for the time being.   \n\nThen we had our main course and many of us opted for steak.   I'm sure it was good, but honestly, I can't remember.   The smell did so much more than penetrate my large Italian nose, it also cause a rift between me and my friend/partner Adam.  Adam, if you are reading this right now, I'm sorry.   I hated that smell, but if you ever want to go back, I'd go with you.  I choose you.  Always. Forever.  Can we please go somewhere else.  Ok fine you win, let's go to Hugo's.  But we are not showing up early."

Now, I'm not exactly sure what \"old Vegas\" felt like, but the food and service that Hugo's provided was what I would have imagined \"old Vegas\" to be like. I would advise that you make reservations. There was a couple of men who walked up to the host just before we did and they were told the wait would be at least 2 hours. \n\nIt was my boyfriend's birthday and each year, I try to find a local gem to take him to - something that was different than the usual Strip offerings. Prior to September 2015, I had never even heard of Hugo's. I found it on Yelp and after reading the many positive reviews, I decided we had to go. I have never ventured into a Downtown casino and thought that the parking situation would be similar to the ones on the Strip. Drive in through the front and either valet or self park. Not really the case here. Hugo's is located inside the Four Queens Hotel & Casino. Google Maps and Waze directs you to the front entrance on Fremont. All parking, however, is on Carson. Because of this, we were 10 minutes late getting to Hugo's, Even so, the host had a sense of humor about it and gave us a choice between a cozy booth or a table. After we selected the booth, he plucked out a beautiful, long-stemmed red rose from a basket of roses and presented it to me (as they do to every lady dining at Hugo's). \n\nThe restaurant itself isn't huge. It is dimly lit and the decor really is reminiscent of \"old Vegas\" in a glamorous and romantic way. The waitstaff was all dressed in tuxes and fairly mature. Our server was Michael. He took the time to explain and validate our meal choices by telling us how great the dishes were, and the care it took to prepare those dishes. \n\nFor the appetizer, we ordered the crab cakes. Let me tell you...they were the best crab cakes we had ever had. Moderately-sized patties made of lump crab meat with just the right amount of crust. It came with some kind of aioli but I honestly couldn't tell you about it. I just remember the crab cake. I didn't want it to end. \n\nOnce the appetizer has been cleared comes the salad cart which comes with every entree. A different waiter wheeled the cart over to our table, gave us each our choice out of 4 different dressings. Then they go through the cart, asking you which ingredients you want/don't want. Once you've picked everything, the salad is tossed and served in front of you. It was a pretty good portion of a very delicious salad.\n\nNow getting to the best part. I ordered the Beef Wellington. Michael recommended I get it medium rare, which I did and I have zero regrets. It was perfect. The puff pastry crust was flaky and moist, concealing the filet of beef topped by a piece of deliciously and politically incorrect food (foie gras). My boyfriend ordered the ribeye medium rare and it was cooked to perfection, juicy and tender. \n\nYou'd think after all that food, we would have been too full for anything else. You're dead wrong. We each had a cappuccino and were going to call it quits until a server brought over the dessert tray. We couldn't turn down the chocolate lava cake and I'm glad we didn't. Gluttonous? Definitely. Worth it? Oh yea.\n\nAlso, when Michael took our payment, he also offered to validate our parking ticket. We, in our food-induced fog, would have forgotten to validate. 5 stars for the food. 5 stars for the service."

While their steaks are not of the caliber of some high-end steakhouses, the prime rib here is astounding, you may not be able to enjoy prime rib anywhere else after you have had it at HUGO'S CELLAR. The other entrees are all excellent and the price is reasonable for portion and quality, especially compared to some of the high-end places popping up in Vegas.\n\nIf I have complaints they are minimal - the legendary custom salad cart seems to produce smaller salads than even form just a few years ago and some of the newer wait-staff is not as in love with the HUGO'S experience as the old team.\n\nBut this is quibbling - bring the love of your life here on your next Vegas trip.

It is not hip and trendy in any sense of the word, more like on the dated side which makes it in my eyes old school Vegas and on the hipster side.\n\nSo anyways...ambiance aside. It still is a great place for a date. They hand each woman a rose at entry..little cheesy but I like it :). Like I said the restaurant is a little retro , if you go on their website even the one picture they have up is dated. Don't let that stop you from going to Downtown Vegas though. The food is nothing short of amazing,\n\nYou can have a five course meal here if you choose but with any entree they start you off with a salad. They waiter will pull of salad cart and have you personally choose what you want/don't want in your custom salad...and get this, if you don't like salad dressing options they can create one for you. Love it!!!!!!!! \n\nAfter you custom made salad you get a lemon/ lime sorbet in a tiny ice cream cone to cleanse the pallet.  After that your food (great portions not too small or too much) and anything you order will be DE-LISH. \n\nAs if that were not enough they bring you a platter of assorted chocolate dipped fruit & dried fruit with their very own in house made TO DIE FOR whip cream. I am not a whip cream fan at all and the whip cream they served was beyond beyond words. \n\nBy the end of that you really won't have much room for dessert but if you do they are good as well. I've had the creme brulee and its silky and yummy.\n\nThe service is top notch, food is great...if you go make sure you make reservations. I've been there a bunch of times and the earlier you go the better...when there are big parties there they don't manage as well. It is a hidden gem that mostly on locals know about so I am so glad I found out about it.

The atmosphere is unmatched in Vegas and the service is very attentive. Check this one out if you can!"

The wine somalier is not too snooty, and everyone we encountered was very nice, accommodating and pleasant.  From the second you walk in and are handed a rose, to the moment you finish that last chocolate covered strawberry or fig, you are treated to an experience!!  Tables are cleared promptly, including crumbs so that you don't have to worry about dropping a piece of lettuce and it sitting there the entire time lol.  Thanks Hugos! Another lovely time."

I made my return to Hugo's Cellar for the first time in years, and now I remember why I love it so much.  The service is absolutely exceptional, and you just get so much more for your money.\n\nFor about the same price as a dry filet mignon at the Strip House (Planet Hollywood), you get a salad made to your exact taste at your table, a 10 oz filet with your choice of crusting and sauce, a palate cleanser and chocolate dipped strawberries, figs and apricots.  And the preparation is excellent all around.\n\nA sommelier who recommended a bottle of wine 25% under our wine budget was a refreshing change as well.\n\nIf you're downtown and looking for an amazing dining experience, head to the 4 Queens and try Hugo's Cellar - you won't be disappointed."

Truly a class act it was prior to desserts-proper that a trio of chocolate dipped fruits arrived to be dressed in hand-whipped cream and with more sweets offered on the house to celebrate a duo of birthdays it was tableside we turned again - the smolder and burn of booze, fresh fruit, and cinnamon ladled over rich ice cream a refined finish to a true 'experience.'"

It isn't the best casino in town, and to say that it's a step up from a dump is a compliment.  However, when you get to Hugo's Cellar, and walk down those stairs, you're entering a whole different world.  Probably the best date restaurant anywhere!   They give all the ladies a red rose when you arrive.  Then they seat you and give you the menus.  You order, then a few minutes later, they come by with a salad cart and they prepare your salad tableside.  I've never seen anything like that.  Then after your salad, they bring you a palette cleansing mini-cone of sorbet.  Then they bring you your entree and the food is amazing!  And after dinner, they bring you a tray of dipped strawberries, apricots and figs with whipped cream.  It is very intimate and romantic.  You really need a reservation and still be prepared to wait a little bit past your time.  It is well worth the wait.  And all of the servers are top notch and very attentive.  The prices seem high, but for what you get, compare it to other top notch restaurants in the city, and you'll see what a great deal this is."

Although, I'll give 4 of 5 stars because there were a few opportunities for improvement too. \n\nStarting with the good - my husband and I went there for our 5 year anniversary and it was a special night for us also because this was where we got engaged. We were seated right away and were pleasantly surprised to see that we had the same waiter and sommelier as we had at our last visit, nearly 6 years ago. Service was great, food was equally great. The table side salad preparation is unique and interesting. I had the raspberry chicken as my entree and it was delicious. For dessert, we had the complimentary chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots (yum!) and then we were surprised with another dessert, with \"congratulations\" written in raspberry sauce on the plate. Finally, our waiter was preparing bananas foster at a nearby table and asked if I had ever had it before. I haven't, so of course, he surprised us again with a small portion of that dessert too. I was incredibly full and certainly shouldn't make any habits of indulging in three desserts in one night but it was a great gesture and of course another ridiculously tasty treat too good to pass up.\n\nNow, for the suggested areas of improvement  - when making our reservation, my husband specified in the notes that it was a special night because of our anniversary and engagement, so, for a restaurant of this caliber, you'd expect the hostess, who has access to these notes, to welcome you back and congratulate you on your special day. Instead, the hostess was less than personable and simply escorted us to the table and left. Not a deal breaker move, but it would've added that special touch you would expect here. Additionally, for a restaurant with these prices and this reputation, I was surprised to see that the lamp on the hostess podium was held together with scotch tape. A dap of wood glue would do the trick .. Just a bit tacky as a first impression when you walk up to check in.  Finally, I really like the cozy, dated ambiance but the blue tableclothes have got to go. A warm cream cloth would do wonders and make it look a little brighter, fresher, and clean."

A busy Friday night required reservations.  The good thing about this place is dinners come with veggies, potatoes and table side salad. I had the lobster bisque as an appetizer with my lamb chops.  The bisque wasn't what I was expecting.  I only had lobster bisque at one other place.  That was William B's in the old defunct Stardust.  That soup rocked and this one was meh in comparison.  Not very much goodies in this smooth and creamy soup.  Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be and William B's did it wrong.  I just liked B's better.  The table side salads were a great touch.  I had the classic ceaser which was one of the best ceasers i've had.  My lamb chops medium rare were a bit tough, but it was still flavorful.  They served it with a gravy that had a hint of habenero that kicked it up a notch.   The rest of my family had the 16 oz prime rib, the roasted chicken, and the beef wellington.  We also had a side of king crab legs to share.  This was plenty of food. I ended up getting half a wellington and more than my share of crab legs.  Needless to say, I didn't have the opportunity to de-bone the lamb chops.   I would have loved to knawl all the good meat next to the bones, but there was too much food  and in Vegas, what happens at the dining table stays at the dining table.  A very big meal and worthy of 4 stars."

Impeccable fine dining with old school tableside service for all the traditional dishes: artistically composed caeser salads assembled before your eyes to deconstructions of ducks and flambes, the waitstaff attend to every need and whim. Drinks are expertly made as well as an attentive and world class sommelier will help you pair your food with one of 1,000's of bottles ranging from semi- affordable options to \"holy crap, my house is worth less\" options. Each table gets a team of staff at your disposal, all women recieve roses upon entry of the establishment and they provide light sorbet palette cleansers between courses. The menu is old school american fine dining and all entrees come with a custom salad made tableside with several dressings and easily a dozen different ingredients. Diners also recieve choclate dipped strawberries, apricots and a wonderful homemade whipped creme. The last entree I can recall having there was the Duck L'Orange which was almost a sexual experience. I also suggest the dirty martinis here too, almost a meal in itself and possibly the best mixed drink I've experienced yet. While not cheap, entrees can seem exspensive but keep in mind they come with salads and a light dessert. Add some sides of spinach, potatos and mushrooms for the table and a +/-$100 bottle of wine and 3 drinks came to $300 with tip for two.. The fact that Hugo's has managed to survive in the ever evolving city of Vegas when so many other famously fine dining experiences have closed should serve true testament to its continued dedication to its craft. Instead of blowing a wad of cash in the casino one night, do yourself a favor and try a truly fine dining experience. I guarantee that before the end of the meal you will feel like you've hit the jackpot!\n\nP.S.\nNO this is not a modern food movement restaurant, they dont try to reinvent dishes or interpret them in their own way, and certainly the menu can be called dated and unimaginative. But thats not the point here. This is an old school experience with expected and known dishes served flawlessly. \n\n-located in the Four Queens Hotel Casino\n-free parking validation at the check in counter at in the casino lobby"

I didn't want the asparagus that came with it and asked for a different vegetable and the waiter informed me they have nothing else other than the asparagus. That makes no sense as my husbands NY strip was served with mushrooms and my salad had onions on it. Anyway, the main course was just ok. They have a wine sommelier on staff which is extremely helpful and he was super polite.

We just came home from our anniversary dinner here and I am so sorry that Hugo's didn't live up to all the glowing reviews here on Yelp.  \n\nFirst, hidden gem or not, it's still the basement at the 4 Queens, a less than lovely old time casino/hotel down on Fremont.  Don't get my wrong, I like Fremont Street and don't expect the flash of the Strip, but the 4 Queens is in my view a lower tiered hotel/casino.  \n\nThe room is dark and it was crowded and we got stuck at a table by the door to the bar.  I thought it was noisy and too busy to be a romantic gem that everyone goes on about here on Yelp and other review sites.\n\nService.  The older hostess seated us quickly, but she really was just there to take us to the table and didn't make us feel welcome at all.  I don't expect a brass band, but a warm friendly welcome is always nice.  Then there was our waiter, well, let's just say our waiter was not one of the stellar ones that I observed at other tables.  His heart just didn't seem to be in his job tonight.  I don't know it that's every night or if he is just not as good as some of the old school waiters seemed to be.  He wasn't there most of the time and wasn't personable and attentive as other waiters I was observing at other tables.  There were no pleasantries exchanged or even small talk, just order taking.\n\nStarted with drinks which were nicely made and bread butter.  Believe or not, we had stale or day old flat bread.  I told the busser and he just asked if we wanted more....you mean like more stale bread!  Uh, no thanks.\n\nThe salad really is a nice touch.  Made table side does make it fun and it is fresh and tasty and nice.  But again, no small talk or chat from the waiter.\n\nI had the rib eye.  The meat was cooked to perfection, but I wasn't sure what the unnecessary sauce or gray was on the meat.  The vegetables were cool to cold and the potato was about the same.  It was a good, but not great steak.\n\nMy wife had the scallops and she had to send them back because they were covered in a nasty tasting sauce.  The waiter had them redone and they put the sauce on the side.  They were fresh and cooked well, but why ruin good seafood by covering it up with sauce?  All fresh seafood needs is a little butter or olive oil and maybe some garlic.  Let the protein speak for itself.  Why hide it?\n\nThe sorbet between courses is again a nice touch and so too are the chocolate covered strawberries.  \n\nI like old style Vegas and I like downtown, but needless to say, I am not a fan of Hugo's Cellar.  If I want a steak downtown again, I'll head over to Vic & Anthony's at the Golden Nugget, where we had exemplary service and excellent food awhile back.  For a real hidden gem downtown, try the Second Street Grill hidden away at the Fremont or the Triple George Grill.  All three of these places are much nicer in my opinion than Hugo's....\n\nSadly, the menu and Hugo's is in my view, too \"old school\".  To much stuff you'd have expected in an episode from Mad Men rather than in 2013..\n\nAn addendum, I did put in our reservation this was our anniversary, and didn't even get a greeting of happy anniversary...to me that was really kind of a big no-no for a place that wants to be \"old school\""

The staff is wonderfully considerate and trained. Our table-side salad prep was impressive, as was our waiter when he plated our filet and lobster for two table-side. This was the best surf and turf we have ever had. We were treated to a complimentary chocolate lava cake for our anniversary with well wishes from all of our table staff. Thank you Hugo's for an amazingly memorable evening."

It's downstairs in the Four Queens, and although the casino is bright and loud, the restaurant is quiet. They hand you a rose when you get there. After sitting down they suggested the raspberry lemon martini and it was EXCELLENT! Make sure you have some of the complimentary bottled water to go along with your alcohol because they don't skimp on drinks. While you're at it eat some of the cheese toasted lavosh or buttered rolls. There were some other families there celebrating birthdays and no one was really dressed up. \n\nThey make your salad table-side and with a huge array of toppings to choose from. I had tiny shrimp on mine and honey-walnut vinaigrette. They had to warn me against eating too much of it because we had a lot more food coming. \n\nWe got the crab cakes for an appetizer and I'm sure they were the best I ever had. Definitely try them with the aoli sauce. After that they gave us raspberry sorbet in tiny cones to cleanse the palate. My favorite part of the whole night was the server's accent. I felt like I had gone back in time to Old Vegas. For my entr\u00e9e I had the raspberry chicken, it came in a fantastic cream sauce with white and green asparagus and roasted garlic whipped potatoes. My date had duck with mandarin oranges and wild rice, also fantastic. Or course I took home the leftovers of both and ate them the next day for lunch.\n\nWe planned on getting the bananas foster for dessert but were too full. They also give you chocolate covered strawberries, apricots and figs with a whipped cream. The figs are awesome! I definitely recommend this place for a nice date or family celebration. Super service and excellent food."

I also love that like all the other top resturaunts have were you by your entree but if you want a salad and a side you have to pay extra for both. Not here you pay for your entree and you get the salad cart, the palate cleansing sherbert , your entree and side and then even chocolate dip fruit. It is the best deal in Vegas!"

They charged us all extra fr the salad because we did not explain that we split that too, although they split the steak automatically. They removed it from the bill though so its all good. \nThe place is cozy but the price is quite high, I've been to other steakhouses that are around the same price but the ambiance is better & they do more table side services plus it comes with more stuff.

This place is a must visit when in Las Vegas...it's not advertised but is very busy due to word of mouth. You can tell you are in a five star restaurant with the amount of care you are given here.\n\nThe food here is first-rate. Each entr\u00e9e comes with assorted warm breads and special cheese-toasted lavosh, bottled water, and Intermezzo-Fruit sorbet. It also includes their table-side salad, from which you can choose crisp romaine lettuce, peeled tomato wedges, marinated artichokes and hearts of palm, sliced mushrooms, blue cheese crumbles, toasted croutons, roasted pine nuts, chopped eggs, red onions and bay shrimp and a selection of dressings: Caesar, creamy pepper or honey-orange-walnut vinaigrette. The entr\u00e9e also comes with fresh vegetable du jour and choice of roasted garlic whipped potatoes, red potatoes with parsley or wild rice. They also serve white and dark chocolate dipped strawberries, apricots and baby figs after the meal. With all the accompaniments we did not bother with ordering appetizers. \n\nThe table-side salad was delish! Love that everything is made to order thus making the experience more special. The cheese toasted lavosh bread is so yummy I ate way too much of it.  I loved the rose butter it was such a lovely touch. The sorbet was a great touch specially if you had anchovies on your salad. My dad and I both ordered the Filet and Shrimp Aux Poivre (5 oz filet and about 6 pcs of shrimps), my mom got the rib eye and my husband the 10 oz filet. My meal was superb...the filet was a perfect medium and the shrimp was not chewy or rubbery. The peppercorn sauce an awesome flavor to the shrimp. The garlic mash potato was delicious...you can taste the garlic flavor but it was not over-powering. The fresh vegetable was cooked to perfection. The chocolate dipped fruits were also delightful. You can tell that they use high quality chocolate. I ordered cr\u00e8me brulee for dessert...that too was lovely but not as great as everything else.  I love the ambiance at Hugo's...it's cozy and relaxing even though it is somewhat formal. The price for the food is somewhat high but is well worth for the quality of food and service that you get."

            "review": "I love old school Vegas places, so I've obviously had Hugo's bookmarked for a while, and finally visited last night.\nFirst, the setting: downtown, in the 4 Queens, so you get the full 'vintage' feeling that I think is kinda lacking at Piero's or Golden Steer. Of course, the Four Queens has pretty much moved beyond 'vintage' to 'dated and smoky', so luckily the restaurant is located literally in the cellar, away from the nastiness of the casino.\nSecond, the ambiance: all brick walls with old paintings everywhere. The furniture is newer, but definitely not modern. I think they could probably spruce things up a little without losing the feel of the place. For instance: 1970s glass lamp shades shaped like flowers. \nThird, the service: perfect. Friendly, prompt, knowledgeable. All over it with our water refills and busing our dirty plates, but I never felt like they were hovering. I loved that the sommelier came around to chat with everybody, and he was great. Very approachable, explained things to us without being snooty, and definitely did not scoff at our price point. I love love love that the sommelier has been there almost 30 years, the busser 15 years, and the waiter 15 years. \nFourth, the FOOD: great. We started with the escargot, which were rich and buttery just like they should be. We each had an order of 6, but I wished we would have split because I was already getting full! Moved on to the salad, which many people have described. It might be nice if one of the offerings was just 'make me a caesar salad,' but I appreciated all the options. All the ingredients were fresh and plentiful. For entrees we had the sea bass New England style, and the beef wellington. Both were delicious, but I thought the wellington really stood out. Both the beef and the pastry were cooked perfectly and the sauce added the perfect flavor. Also, the meat was so tender, not a bit stringy like I expected. Finally, topped it off with the chocolate dipped fruits which were a nice tough. It was so much food (and we didn't even touch the bread basket), that we each brought home at least half of our entree.\nFinally, the damage: $250. Fine dining salads, appetizers, entrees, mini desserts, a bottle of wine, and tip. Totally worth it.\nI wouldn't mind stopping back by for a martini at the bar when I'm in the area sometime."

My husband and I were celebrating the day we met 7 years ago, and wanted to go somewhere different and special. Hugo's Cellar was my choice. \n\nI loved every bit of the decor and style of the restaurant. It felt like it had been there forever, and that there was good reason for it. Vegas is so quick to demolish the old and put a new spin on everything, so I just love the coziness Hugo's exudes. \n\nWe were greeted with sincerity, and I was given a rose as we were walked back to our table. I already knew what I wanted from studying all the Yelp photos and reading the reviews prior to arrival.  I ordered a Greygoose Orange Cosmopolitan, my husband had the Franciscan Cabernet. We started with shrimp cocktail (pass on this!), had the table side salads that were included with our entrees (my husband exclaiming it was the best salad he's had in his whole life- LOL!), I ordered the small prime rib med rare (yum) with a 1/2 lb. of king crab legs (omg yum), and my husband had the beef Wellington med rare. We were happy with everything we ordered. I found the food to not have much salt on it; which is a good thing if you're more health conscious, or prefer to add it yourself. My crab legs were pre split and fat with meat. Yum. - I love crab legs! I couldn't finish all my prime rib, so it was boxed to go. \n\nWe saw a neighboring table order the bananas foster for dessert, and while it looked and smelled wonderful, we didn't have enough room. We shared a berry custard torte which was really good. After dinner it was fun to walk off our big meal and take in all the lights of the downtown area. \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our meal at Hugo's Cellar. There are a lot of fantastic restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas, but if you're looking for something special with your someone special, look no further.  This is it."

I chose a Manhattan and I am barely joking when I tell you that the pour was seven fingers with the portion that couldn't fit in the martini glass nicely stored in a bucket of ice for me. We then moved on to the appetizers of crab cakes and Gorgonzola stuffed portobello mushrooms. Both were delicious. Up next was the salad service, which was a true treat. Your server comes to the table and puts together your salad with whatever fixings you so desire. At this point we got to our main course of prime rib. The prime rib was so tender and so well cooked that a person with no teeth could have enjoyed it. The velvety touch of the cut was something you find so rarely these days. After our main course, they brought out a tray of chocolate dipped strawberries and figs which even a person like myself who was tragically born without a sweet tooth enjoyed. We ended the night with a cappuccino, which just was the final embellishment on a wonderful meal. I would have loved to try the bananas foster or cherries jubilee dessert, but one more ounce of food down my gullet and I might have died. I recommend reservations as this restaurant is very popular and after the service and quality of food I received, I can understand why they are so popular."

Within a matter of minutes, the hostess let us know that they were ready to seat us.  The long stemmed roses given to all the lady's was definitely a nice touch. (To be honest, this is one of the big reasons Hugo's topped my list of where I wanted to eat for my birthday. After all, I am a hopeless romantic at heart and I love it when I receive roses, whether its from a boyfriend or a friend or even a restaurant). \n\nOur waiters (I believe we had 3), were all fantastic.  Our main waiter was hilarious, he had us cracking up the entire night and at the same time, he was extremely attentive, helpful and knowledgeable.  He also noticed that my friend was a little sick and so he had the bartender whip up a special drink that gets rid of that scratchy feeling in your throat. And miracles of miracles, it worked! Now, that's what I call service!\n\nAs previous reviews have indicated, a salad, a lemon sorbet to cleanse your palette, and some chocolate covered fruit are all included in your entree price. In my opinion, you really don't need to order an appetizer as the portions are all extremely generous so its already a good amount of food.   \n\nThe salad in the beginning was great.  A waiter comes around with a salad cart and you tell him what you would like in your salad. It was wonderful to be able to customize your own salad without feeling picky for not wanting this or that.  \n\nFor the entrees, Hugo's has a ton of variety so that there's pretty much something for everyone on the menu, there's chicken, duck, fish, crab, lobster, etc etc.  For the entree, I took a chance on the chilean sea bass ($36) even though I knew that Hugo's is mainly known for their meat.  The sea bass was FANTASTIC.  Every bite was cooked to perfection and it was extremely moist and flavorful. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  My boyfriend got the 16 oz. prime rib ($38) and that was melt in your mouth AMAZING.  Our friend got the 24 oz. prime rib ($49) and that slab of meat was gigantic, It was a treat just watching him trying to finish that thing.  Because we had 11 people and mostly everyone ordered different things, we got a pretty good taste of the entrees that Hugo's offers.  While everything tasted great, the standouts of the night were definitely the prime rib and the sea bass.  \n\nBy this point, we were so full after the entree that we almost groaned when they brought out the chocolate covered fruits.  They served us two platters of chocolate covered strawberries, figs, and apricots.  All of these were delish.     \n\nThe prices aren't what you would define as cheap, but you're in Vegas so that has to be expected.  Plus, for the quantity of the food, quality of the food, the service, the atmosphere, it was definitely worth it."

            "review": "This palce is very interesting. My boyfriend brought me here as a surprise, and well... walking there I was definitely a bit shocked. The hotel is kind of old and dinky and as I walked by the Subway and TCBY signs I was definitely wondering, \"Where the HECK are we going?\" \n\nBut once there I was so pleasantly surprised! The ambience is great. The welcome rose was a hit for sure! The food was definitely a bit pricey, but you get sooo much for it (and compared to the rest of Vegas a steal).\n\nMy bf and I aren't huge eaters so we just shared an appetizer and one entree. The bread and cheese toasted lavash was really good and of course they refill it as soon as you are done. Also, they must have some job description as \"water-filler\" because I don't think my glass of water was ever more than 1\" from the rim! They just kept refilling it, after a while I had to stop drinking water or else I wouldn't have had room for the food.\n\nThe hot marble slab appetizer (with 2 pieces of filet, 2 pieces of swordfish, 2 pieces of chicken, and 4 shrimps) was SO amazingly good. I don't know how they get everything to cook so soft and tender when they do it right in front of you. The selection just must be very quality.  The salad that comes with the meal = awesome! I loved the idea of making food in front of you and they do it was such bravado. Our entree was the shrimp scampi and well it was so yummy, but I was trying to save room for the dessert! Complimentary raspberry sorbet and chocolate dipped apricot, figs, and strawberries with fresh cream.\n\nOverall I have to say it was such a great and fun experience that made me forget I was in flash Las Vegas.\n\nThanks yelp! My bf said he chose it from here :D and I am so glad I got to go."

(pics will be posted soon)...\nMade my way down the stairs into the dark \"cellar\" flanked by three handsome gentlemen (my daddy, my bf, and his dad) and got my red rose....wore red shoes to match the rose! :)\nWe were seated and got our complementary mountain spring water and bread....I got a glass of Riesling to accompany my meal.\nMy favorite part of the meal was the individually tossed salads tableside...I think I can come back here just for that.  I had romaine with egg, mushroom, tomato, anchovy, bay shrimp, artichokes, hearts of palm, crouton, parmesan, maybe a few other things I can't remember, and honey-walnut vinaigrette.  soooo good!!!\n~raspberry sorbet intermezzo was tasty~\nI ordered tournedos Hugo.  2 5-oz filets topped with foie gras and artichoke in bernaise sauce, came with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, baby carrots, white and green asparagrus, and sauteed mushrooms.  The foie gras was not my favorite, too pasty and no crust or juiciness like at Rosemary's.  In fact, it was barely on the second steak.  The artichokes here, unlike in the salad, were tough to eat.  \nHowever, the filet was amazingly tender and the sauce delicious.  I gave my leftovers to my bf (aka disposal), as did my dad (he ordered the 16 oz ribeye).  \nDessert: chocolate dipped figs, strawberries and apricots with cream dip were soooo yummy!!!!\nIn conclusion, great service and probably a place you go once or twice in a lifetime!  So in Hugo's honor, I made an interesting salad for lunch today.\nMy rose is in a water-bottle-vase that I made, but the fun was walking around all dressed up in the Four Queens holding it and I looked stunning (with the red shoes of course) and watching my dad win at craps."

            "review": "I was born and raised in Las Vegas. I have been coming to Hugo's since I was a kid. I went to homecomings and proms here. Birthdays and other celebrations as well. Anytime a friend from out of town asked for a suggestion on a good quality steakhouse Hugo's was my first thought. I've been to every fine dining restaurant Las Vegas has to offer and still regarded Hugo's as my favorite. So you would see my great GREAT disappointment with my experience tonight. It's my birthday. My fianc\u00e9 made a reservation for us and was very excited to try my \"favorite spot\". It was his first time and will be his last. Our waiter came up to our table with a miserable look on his face right off the bat. Did not introduce himself, did not ask what the occasion was (although we told the host it was my birthday, twice) he asked for our drinks and rushed off. Almost 15 minutes later he finally checked back with us to ask if we were ready to order. I am in the service industry and I am very sympathetic to waiters and service. I always give the benefit of the doubt to them when it takes a bit longer due to volume or short staffing. This was not the case. I saw him standing around, catering to other tables and didn't so much as look at us. A thumbs up at that point would have sufficed. We finally ordered appetizers and entrees. As I was about to ask about the table side salad he ran off like we were a bother. My fianc\u00e9 then excused himself to the \"bathroom\" but unbeknownst to me he actually went back to the host stand to make sure they could send a little cake out with a candle for my birthday. The host said \"absolutely\". I tried to wave down our waiter to ask a question, he made eye contact and ran away to the back. Our appetizers came first. We were not checked on once by the water until the table side salad (which should have been before the appetizers) were served. Again in a rushed and rude tone. Eggs? Red onion? Dressing? And everything was hurriedly thrown in a bowl and slopped onto our plates. A LONG while later our entrees came out. Both ordered medium. The couple next to us were given great and personable service and their salads were done before ours even tho they were seated well well after we had initially arrived. When we were finished with our salad plates we put them to the front of the table, our waiter walked by THREE times seeing the plates and just left them. Finally a busser picked them up 5 minutes later. I am 31 and my fianc\u00e9 is 29. We look younger and we pretty much chalked it up to age discrimination as we are extremely polite to servers everywhere we go. The Beef Wellington was disappointing and the Rack of Lamb was lack luster. Garlic mash had zero flavor. The food was the least of our grievances though because the service was so bad and impersonal. Usually you have two waiters helping you out. We saw the other waiter maybe twice and he was very polite. His name was Dave and we wish he would have been around more often. The bill came right after the chocolate covered strawberries. No birthday cake, no candle nothing special for my birthday even tho we told the host twice. 200 dollars later and my fianc\u00e9 was really upset. Hugo's Cellar is no longer my favorite restaurant. I will never suggest it again. I work in the number one nightclub in the world and have suggested it many times. Never again. My fianc\u00e9 refuses to come back. In all of my times coming to Hugo's in the past 25 years. (Yes 25 years!!!!) I have always had a pleasant experience and although one bad experience shouldn't ruin it for me, it has. My birthday dinner was not special. I would name the waiter in the review but he never once told us his name and we were too frustrated and upset to ask. We just wanted to get out of there. Go to Mastro's or Del Frisco's their quality of food and service are MUCH better. Maybe this is an end of an era. Very sad."

It was no problem at all. We waited at the bar for 5 or 10 minutes and had a great round of drinks. And coming from New York, they were reasonably priced.  The host then handed all the ladies a single red rose and we were escorted to our table. The table was in a private room and our roses were placed in vases in the center of the table. So pretty. The service was impeccable, and the prices were great BECAUSE it was NOT ala carte. So refreshing.  When you order your entree, you get salads and sides. The salad was wheeled over on a cart and the waiter puts whatever you like in it. Before you get the main course, there was an intermezzo palate cleansing lemon sorbet cone given out as well. Very nice touch. The main course was delicious. We all got filets. Some were wrapped Wellington style but all cooked perfectly. At the end of the meal they put trays of chocolate wrapped strawberries, figs and apricots on the table. We had a memorable, special evening. I would go back any time."

From the moment we entered the service was phenomenal. There were warm smiles everywhere. We arrived exactly on time for our reservation and were seated immediately after being handed a rose. Once seated, we had several gentleman serve us. There were 4 to be exact, although I can only remember 3 names: Rashard, Oscar and Dave. All four were kind and humored us quiet a bit. \nFirst, Rashard came and asked us what we would like to drink. (TIP: it's an open bar charge of $10... We didn't know this or we would have taken advantage lol). I got wine and my boyfriend got whiskey. Both delicious. The server who brought the wine was very knowledgable and funny (can't remember name). The salad done by Rashard was delicious! I asked for the honey dressing that they had and, my goodness, it was delectable, my boyfriend got the same dressing and also loved it. \nOscar came by next to give us raspberry sorbets in cute little cones to help cleanse. He too cracked a few jokes and was very friendly (our favorite 2 servers were Rashard and Oscar for their humor).\nNext the entr\u00e9es served by Dave. I ordered the filet mignon and my boyfriend had the queen lobster. Both were seasoned perfectly and cooked just right. We didn't have room for dessert although they do bring complementary desserts which are a few fruits covered in chocolate. Overall, it was a great experience and I definitely recommend it to everyone! Just be ready to drop anywhere from $175-$275 for 2 people. It's worth it though!"

Well Hugo's Cellars is the best place for steak, service, and a must for a trip to Vegas. From the moment we walked in my wife received a rose and staff was more than helpful friendly staff at a restaurant they set the standards on what service should be. Honestly they raise the bar a few notches. Appetizers were great bread with rose butter so good. Main entrees were beyond delicious. Out steak was not over or under cooked which is easily done when ordering a rare steak they do not make any mistakes on food. This review still cannot serve this place justice they are incredible hands down. Oh and VICTOR, he just made it for us he was not our waiter or the manager he was the salad guy he will make your night and the experience very conversational never misses a beat his personality made our entire Vegas trip the best. If you make a reservation and have never been there before request Victor just going to Hugo's cellar is awe inspiring and an experience to remember but having Victor is truly what makes it the best. Must go there is a reason they have great reviews. The price yes it is higher priced so if your looking for a low priced meal it's not here. We spent $160 for 2 steak dinners and drinks. It was our anniversary so they brought a a special desert at no charge. I in no way regret spending the amount we did on dinner the food quality shows why and the service is unlike anywhere else we have EVER BEEN."

Mine came back extremely rare, while his was literally cold.  Both dishes were sent back. They gave me a whole new steak, which was again, very rare. And instead of truly heating up my husband's steak, they simply placed the entire plate back under the heat lamp. So the plate came back hot, while the steak was still cold.  Just very disappointing for a place that is supposed to specialize in this kind of thing.\n\nMy husband did not want to make a big deal, so he just didn't eat the dish and asked for them not to charge us.

I had one that seemed like 2 and a half....wow---is all I have to say about that.  \n\nThe food is absolutely delicious and the service was superb!  Before I kick in to detail about how wonderful the food was, let me say that every entree comes with seasoned vegetables and baby red potatoes, a fresh salad, fresh bread, sorbet and chocolate dipped fruit.  I kid you not...really.  =0)  \n\nSo, carrying on---We had the Fabulous Michael as our marvelous server and he was SUPERB, with an in-depth knowledge on all of the meals offered.  I opted for the awesome Salmon and my pal opted for the Chilean Sea Bass.  They were both EXCELLENT!!!!  \n\nPrior to the dinner coming over they have a huge salad cart that comes around and you can select exactly what you want on your salad.  I was pretty full just from the salad.  =0)  But, I pressed on and ate a little bit of everything.   Well, we were quite full, but the Banana Fosters looked like such an awesome presentation that we decided to order that just for the experience.  =))\n\nThe experience is quite unique and I recommend giving it a try!  You must!!  You will be quite delighted, I promise you.\n\nYvette L. Brownstone from Ventura, CA"

Everyone at my table enjoyed their meal. I had the fish of the day, which was done perfectly, but can't comment too much on everyone elses.  The others in my parties got a Ribeye and some other cut of steak and both gave two monster thumbs up. The sides were perhaps a bit too rich, but nothing to really cause a downgrade.\n\nService: Service stuck out the most to me and really is what earned this the five star.  From the beginning they are extremely attentive.  The rose for the ladies was welcomed by all.  Additionally, we had a classically trained sommelier who was excellent and chose a wine that really actually complemented the meal, that was not even close to the most expensive on the menu.   \n\nAmbience: Classy place, dark (not too dark) and romantic.  I thought it had excellent acousitcs insofar as you knew others were in the restaurant but you could still talk at a nice level.  \n\nPrice: $300 for four of us with a good amount of wine seemed extremely fair for the enjoyment we got from the night.  So it is pricey, but less so than most of the fancier steakhouses in town.\n\nI definitely recommend for a special night out."

Located in The Queen casino, you walk into a candlelit cave of old school class. The staff is friendly and professional.\n\nSecond, the intangibles of Hugo's are fantastic. Each entree comes with a made to order salad prepared at your table-side that was surprisingly filling and delicious. Between courses they provide you with a sorbet palate cleanser. \n\nThe reason I couldn't give a review higher than three stars is due to the steak quality. I had the ribeye and the gf had the filet mignon: both were okay but not great. Better than a chain restaurant but no where near the quality you would expect from $50+ steaks. This is unfortunate because everything else was done so well but they failed to stick the landing where it matters most. \n\nBottom line: loved everything except for our entrees. If you're going to try Hugo's, be prepared to be charmed and order something else besides the steaks."

We were seated quickly and we ordered a nice bottle of wine from the sommelier. That was the highlight of the dinner. I ordered the Sea Bass ($59) and my wife ordered the Seafood Trio ($62). My Sea Bass had a frozen taste to it and it was like eating a sponge No taste whatsoever,  My wife's entree was similar. I sent mine back and ordered a filet instead,  as I was not willing to try their seafood again. The filet was good... not great. We came to Hugo's because of the great tradition of excellence in service and food. Neither is present anymore as the service was just ok. When I spend $200 on dinner for two people, I really expect a much better food experience. No more Hugo's for us."

We did not have reservation, so we went to see if they had any open tables. We got there at 6:30pm and the host said he needed to wait until 6:45 to see if any reservations did not show up. So we decided to wait. At 6:40 the host said he had a cancel. \n\nI like to rate my food items on a 5 star scale. The number of * is my ratings\n\nWhat we ordered/items came with entrees: Caesar salad*, NY Sirloin*, Tomato/ pesto stuffed chicken*, dessert plate (we did not eat any of it)\n\nPositives:\nLemon sorbet that is served between the salads and entrees.\nNo ordering of sides separately (also listed on negatives).\nBuild your own salad tableside.\nService for bread and water\n\nNegatives:\nAtmosphere: Very dark, old feeling, and very small place. They have too many tables for the table side service for the salads and desserts. We sat at a table and when the gentleman was preparing the salads for the booths behind us he kept bumping into us.\n\nService: The waiter had broken English so it was hard to understand him. He did not make any recommendations. Right after we ordered the guy came to make our salads. The gentleman did not recommend any salad or describe any of the dressings. We heard him describing everything to the tables behind us after we ordered. \n\nFood: \nSalads- Terrible dressing was very very fishy (anchovies).\nEntrees- First, my steak. The steak seemed like it was from a caf\u00e9 that serves the $1.99 steak and eggs. This was not a steak from an expensive steakhouse. My wife's chicken was something that you could also get at a cheap caf\u00e9. \nSides- This was very disappointing that the sides came with the entr\u00e9e instead of us being able to order what we want. The entr\u00e9e sides were a stuff tomato, veggies, and mashed potatoes.\n\nThis was the most disappointing places we have EVER been to. We have been to many expensive steakhouses and this by far is the WORST. We are locals there are many other great places to eat."

Prepare to be pampered from the moment you make your way down a short flight of stairs and enter Hugo's Cellar. We had such a marvelous evening celebrating our 30th anniversary.\n\nHugo's had the right amount of baby boomer nostalgia with waitstaff in tuxedos and elegant 70's deco.  Diners today will love the experience of having tableside service of some of their dishes and desserts. Hugo's is one of the very few restaurants that still carries on this tradition since 1976.\n\n--Highlights --\n-all entr\u00e9es include steamed veggies, choice of potatoes, or wild rice, finished off with strawberries, figs and apricots dipped in chocolate.\n\n-Entr\u00e9e dishes: something for everyone. Various cuts of steak prepared, seafood, duck and chicken. http://www.hugoscellar.com/files/menu.pdf\n\n-basket of breads and cheese lavosh with a plate of butter carved out in shape of a rose is brought out as soon as you are seated. \n\nmini ice cream cone with Raspberry sorbet serves as a palate cleanser after salad/before main meal \n\n-Salad Made Tableside\nServer wheels their cart over to you and custom makes your salad.  Of course I got the works with Bay Shrimp, artichokes,  and about 8 other toppings with romaine lettuce. \n\nBeef Wellington is what I ate!  Loved it!  A VERY tender beef filet garnished with Foie Gras and duxelles wrapped up in a puff pastry, paired with a bordelaise sauce!\n\n-Dessert\nafter main meal if you order Cherries Jubilee, it's made table side, with a little fire show even.  Cherries, cherry liquor flambe'd served over vanilla ice cream. I would get this again! \n\nGet Hugo's Cappuccino with brandy and coffee liquor. It actually worked out perfect having it with the complimentary chocolate cake that Chef sent out for Happy Anniversary wishes! Thank you! \n\nWhen it comes to service. Impressive. It's well known that most of the original waitstaff since early '80s still works here. One of our servers Jaime, has been there the second longest time at 31 years, Michael, 14 years and the new kid on the block (I didn't catch his name) was 7 years!  \n\n--More 411--\n-  dress code not enforced but stay classy and leave shorts, tanks, and sandals at home. \n-  reservations a must! so call..Monday eve was packed\n-  plan on spending 2 hours - dinner is slow paced\n-  Your red rose is wrapped up in foil for you to take home \n-  they'll validate your ticket for both valet or self parking\n-  I thought spending a little over $200 for 2 meals, desserts and beverages was pretty reasonable. \n\n--Summary--\nAfter having dining experiences at well known Michelin star and celebrity chef restaurants in Vegas, I'm so over it, doesn't impress me anymore. This time I wanted a place that had good food that we both would like, classy and unpretentious. You see hip, trendy restaurants come and go with a blink of an eye. Not Hugo's Cellar! It has withstood the test of time. Happy we celebrated here. Couldn't ask for a more perfect evening with my hot date."

So with so many options on the strip, its going to have to take a pretty good recommendation for me to stray off the strip for my savory appetite.  Hugo's cellar was recommended to us by one of our customers and he mentioned that it was one of the best steaks he has ever had.  Big words, when it comes to steak in Vegas (..and it was mentioned to us during dinner at Delmonico's).  Nonetheless, my girlfriend and I made it our mission to try Hugo's the next time we were in Vegas.  Here is the short of it:\n\nPros:\nYour lady friend gets a rose when you enter the restaurant.  The amount of food you get for 50 dollars (steak) is a lot.  You get bread, chocolate covered strawberries, salad, and potatoes or vegetables.\nReasonably priced compared to most, if not all a la carte steakhouses\n\nCons:\nDecor is more old school (or hasn't been changed in a while).  Fits in well with the Fremont street casinos.\nThe steak and the meal were just OK for me.  I definitely left full but I wouldn't necessarily say it was melt in your mouth or the steak was anything to write home about.  \n\nVegas Cons: \nIn a city where image can be anything, this place just doesn't cut it.  Its in a cellar and it is on Fremont street.  There are so many other choices in Vegas that can give you a better view, or a more comfortable seating, or give you better recognition or name.  \nThe crowd is older, not as dressy and fits more with the surroundings.  I wore dark jeans and a nice shirt (standard guy-wear) and I felt overdressed.  \n\nIn the end though, I would eat there again.  However, one has to understand the type of meal you are getting and what you are paying for.  With that in hand, its one of the best deals on the strip."

Even though the service and atmosphere were great, the food was so disappointing, especially at about 50 bucks each for the main entree.\n\nThe rack of lamb was under seared, under cooked, and under seasoned. The result was a very gaming smell dish which I couldn't even finish. Well, the upside was the mash potato that came with the lamb was good ... LOL\n\nMy friend's fish entree was average and nothing special, which I wouldn't have b***** about it if it didn't cost 49 bucks for it.\n\nMaybe it was a bad night for them, but these kinda of food quality probably won't get my second visit."

I think any woman would feel special if her significant other took her here for dinner. The food is spectacular.  Last night we had the spinach artichoke dip, which was so divine. Our salads were made fresh table side. We all got to choose our own toppings and our dressing. I had the peppercorn dressing and it was delicious. I chose queens lobster for my dinner. It was medallions of lobster and a delicious sauce with sun-dried tomatoes. I really enjoyed it. It came with vegetables, too. The portions are quite large. Between our courses, we were given sorbet on a tiny cone. It was a delightful touch to clean your palate. I also want to note that they serve chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots with fresh whipped cream for dessert. We also ordered cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and chocolate mousse and everything was absolutely delicious. We truly enjoyed everything about this place and would give it 10 stars if we could!"

I believe service to be a critical component of the dining experience. \n\nThe manager is extremely rude and not at all accommodating. I tried to organize a dinner party for about 30 people here, the manager told me that he was unwilling to accommodate a party of our size during dinner. He said we could come at 5:30 or at 9 because our party would take up too much space and he had other patrons to think about. Guess what manager, you just turned 30 people guaranteed to order 30 dinners... Idiot. \n\nI've never been spoken to so rudely. I'll never come here again.

I took my friend here for his birthday and we just loved it.  Unfortunately, we were both coming from the Yelp event at Ellis Island and had eaten a little (a LOT) so we weren't as hungry as we should've been.  However, we both got the tableside salad, which was great, and an entr\u00e9e. I ordered the Filet de Beouf Atlantis which is a filet mignon wrapped in bacon served Oscar style (with crab).  It was really good, but I can't say it was blow-me-away delicious.  The quality of the steak is just not comparable to other steakhouses on the Strip.  \n\nMy friend ordered the prime rib, and it too was delicious, but there seemed to be a lot of fat on it.  The flavor was great though and it was juicy and tender.  \n\nThe service was on-point.  It was a Wednesday night so it was pretty slow.  The servers were very attentive and nice.  The sommelier came over and took our wine order and they were out of the wine we ordered but he suggested something else in its place that ended up tasting amazing.  \n\nThe restaurant is very dark and romantic and definitely has that old-Vegas feel. Though I've had better steak, this was a unique dining experience and we really enjoyed it.  You can get a voucher from Tix4Tonight (not the one IN 4 Queens, but any other store) and get 25% off your entire check including alcohol. Can't beat that!"

I mean, I was given a rose when I walked in the door AND a custom salad was made for each person in my group, in front of us, at the table. That calls for some major lovin'. \n\nThis place is old school classy and I loved it. Ignore the fact that it's in the Four Queens and GO, now. (If you have some cash to drop, that is...) It looks like a Cellar that your Dad or Grandpa might frequent, all brick and leather chairs and green glass chandeliers. But Oh, the food. Oh yes. And the wine! They have an on-site sommelier and he has personality to spare. Loved him. \n\nStarts out with a salad that is custom made off a cart for you at your table. I recommend the Orange Vinaigrette, it was blow-your-mind good. I ate my whole salad, even though I knew a ton more food was coming, it was that amazing. And you can have it made really simple, or do like my guy did and get the works...which includes anchovies, hearts of palm, pine nuts, red onion, etc. Then you get a little mini raspberry sorbet to clear your palette. It worked! I had an amazing chicken and mushroom dish, but also know that the scallops and filet mignon come highly recommended by my foodie friends. After all of the moaning and giving each other bites of the deliciousness, you are treated to freaking chocolate dipped strawberries and figs with creme fraiche. (it's an all inclusive price.) \n\nMy friends had been there before and raved about the Bananas Foster. Now I see why. This guy in a Tux stands at your table and makes an AMAZING Bananas Foster, we are talking flames rising and the whole shebang. So delectable, I had said I would have a bite but ended up having like 5. And I double licked the spoon. \n\nIf you are looking for a true experience type restaurant, this is your place.

Salad is cold and large, but overly dressed and the choices of dressings are too limited (with the cesear not really an option for most people since it reeks of anchovies). Don't spend your money on the king crab legs - unimpressive and not worth it. Stick to the steak; filet is excellent as was the beef wellington. Solid player in a classic Fremont casino. Its nice that it is still around and its charm hasn't faded too much. Whether they can stand up to a Ruth's Chris or modern steakhouse.. no. But its all about the tradition here.

At Hugo's they make each diner a salad to their specifications from a table side salad station.  Victor was the salad guy.  But he was so much more.  Victor was the story guy, and the \"tell it like it was\" guy, and the guy who embodied the ambience of Hugo's.

It's a bit overpriced, but we don't go there alot, so we can overlook that in favor of the ambiance and the little things like a rose for the female guests.  We like to go to Fremont Street even though we stay toward the south end of the strip.  Hugo's is worth the trip if your looking for a memorable dining experience."

Not many normal salad veggies (no cukes, olives, carrots, peppers) but the concept was great.  Food was presented in a timely manner.  The servers were very friendly.  There was little seasoning on the beef (I had an end cut of prime rib and my  husband the filet de beouf.)  Mashed potatoes, wild rice, and veggies were good.  Fruit platter was good.  Brought us a piece of cheesecake because it was our anniversary.  Very thoughtful.  Overall it was good...  Just not WOW."

We sat for almost 25 minutes before we got offered anything to drink and then we had to flag down Greg, the gentleman who serves the salad, and ask him where our waiter was and if he could just take our order.  \n\nOur waiter did not even bother to stop by until our food was brought out and even then he did not apologize about not helping us and just tried to drop the food off and run away.  Two of the steaks were cooked wrong, and of course one was the birthday girl's!  This is one of the only steakhouses in town that cooks steak the way my boyfriend and his daughter like it and she had never been to a nice steakhouse before and we really wanted her to experience what Hugo's usually offers.  They did offer to have the steaks fixed, but at this point we were all starving and wanted to eat together so they just kept them as they were.  \n\nThen all the waiters sang happy birthday to a big group at the front.  Mind you, when I made the reservation I told the hostess that we were coming to celebrate a young girl's birthday and asked if there was anything they could do and I was told she would get dessert.  Her birthday was not even acknowledged at all through out the whole dinner, not even when we were offered dessert!  When this happened after we had watched another table get the full birthday treatment and his daughter felt kind of left out or not very special he got up and walked away from the table to so he did not get upset with the waiter.  When the waiter asked if there was a problem I told him we are here for her birthday and wanted her to experience what we usually experience when we dine here and it has been anything but pleasant.  He didn't even say sorry and just walked away!!!  \n\nIn the meantime, three other tables that were in our waiter's area were being totally ignored and one of them had been seated before us and got their food long after us.  I don't know if this waiter was new or what his deal was.  But his rude manners and lack of concern for his customers has made my boyfriend not ever want to return again, which makes me very sad as this is my favorite steakhouse!  I'm very disappointed in the service and how we were treated.  The food is still wonderful as ever, but for the price I can go anywhere else in town, even Olive Garden, and get better service than we got."

The prices were high but we were ready to pay for the experience.  All meals included bottle water, a delicious salad make table side, and chocolate covered strawberries.  Chocolate covered dates and apricots were also offered but we were not interested.\n\nMy husband had the 10 oz filet and it was cooked to perfection.  I had the beef wellington, which I have always wanted to try.  Both dishes were amazing and both steaks seemed much bigger than 10 oz.  \n\nI've tried and tried to find a problem with the meal.  Maybe too much salad dressing?  The meal was amazing and we cannot wait to get back to Vegas to eat here again."

I decided to take my boyfriend out for dinner to celebrate his birthday & we chose this place which has been in Vegas for 37 years (!) located in the Four Queens casino downtown. \n\nUpon being seated, the host gives every female a single, long-stem perfect red rose which you can place in an individual case on your table. \n\nWe ordered the Hugo's Hot Rock Specialty for Two ($36) as an appetizer in which the server brings out a 500 degree sizzling slab of granite. He then cooks chicken, filet, ahi, and shrimp on it & leaves it on your table. It was delicious. \n\nFor the main courses, we ordered the Filet de Boeuf- Atlantis ($65) and the rack of lamb ($56). \n\nThe Atlantis is a gigantic, thick filet wrapped in bacon & served over lump crab meat with b\u00e9arnaise sauce. It comes with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, mashed potatoes, green & white asparagus (there's white asparagus??) and two crab claws. \n\nThe rack of lamb is marinated in olive oil, garlic & Rosemary & served with an Indonesian style sauce. \n\nThe filet was tender & delicious. I ordered mine with a bleu cheese crust ($3) which I try to get whenever I eat steak. The lamb was also very good. \n\nAll entrees come with bread, table-side salads (try the honey-orange-walnut vinaigrette!) which is the best salad I've ever had, and a sorbet to cleanse your palette before the main course. You also get chocolate dipped strawberries with house-made whipped cream, white chocolate dipped baby figs, and chocolate dipped dried apricots. \n\nService was good, and for the price, you get a lot of food. We'll definitely be coming back here."

It's too bad more & more of them keep disappearing because the way things used to be in this town was awesome! Wish I could have really experienced it! \n\nHugo's is tucked away & it feels very intimate. When you walk in it really feels like you're stepping back in time. The host is always so nice and all ladies are given a long stem red rose. I have to give it to them because this is such a lovely touch & the experience starts...\n\nThis place is dark & romantic with lots of masculine touches all around like the art & dominant blue colors. \n\nThe food is great! The value is great as well. Meals include everything so prepare to be stuffed. \n\nWe ordered: Beef Wellington & raspberry chicken and both were very decadent. The raspberry chicken is unreal! You get perfectly cooked veggies & a starch (in my opinion the garlic mash is the best). One of the highlights of your meal will be the customized table side salad service. You get to pick all your toppings & the honey-orange-walnut dressing is divine! The lemon sorbet that comes over to cleanse the tastebuds was great & then let's not forget about the complimentary dessert. Chocolate covered apricot, figs & strawberries! And fresh whipped cream! You will love all this indulging! \n\nMy man decided to also get the shrimp cocktail which isn't worth the price tag & several drinks which were reasonably priced. \n\nWe had a lovely meal & it felt like the days of the Rat Pack."

Ladies still receive a long-stemmed rose, a palate cleanser is offered just before entrees are served, and complimentary chocolate-covered fruits are bestowed in abundance at meal's end.  All I missed was French Onion Soup Gratinee.  Alas, it is not served here.\n\nTo begin at the beginning, my party of four enjoyed Cheese-Toasted Lavosh and Sourdough Rolls with rosettes of butter, before some of us shared a very good Shrimp Cocktail.  But only 3 shrimps were presented for $16, along with a nice traditional Cocktail Sauce and a Thousand Island type dressing.  These were followed by an excellent complex salad prepared with a choice of Caesar, Peppercorn, or Honey Raspberry Orange Walnut Vinaigrette Dressing.  I recommend the latter, which was light, flavorful, and interesting with its different fruity notes.  A diner has 20 ingredients from which to pick, including Romaine lettuce, pine nuts, hearts of palm, tomatoes, Parmesan Cheese, shrimp, mushrooms, croutons, anchovies, bell pepper, red onions, and egg.   \n\nAn Intermezzo of Lemon Sorbet was a refreshing change of pace before we launched into our entrees.  I had an excellent, perfectly cooked medium-rare Fillet Atlantis, which is similar to Filet Oscar, but here the Filet Mignon is surrounded by Crab Claws.  Except the claws were ice cold on arrival.  An offer to flash heat my entree was accepted, and it yielded beneficial results.  On return the crab meat was hot, and the smooth Bearnaise Sauce tasted great.  Mixed vegetables on the plate, including cooked tomatoes, were good, and Boiled Parsley Red Potatoes and mushrooms were very good.  But, based on the little crab provided, I didn't feel it was really worth the additional cost.\n\nWhile it is not necessary to purchase a dessert, a pyramid of Caramel Chocolate Mousse with sweet Whipped Cream was really luscious.  But it resulted in a few Chocolate-Covered Figs and Strawberries being left behind on their plate.\n\nIt is fairly dark inside (It is a cellar, after all!), and the ambiance is romantic.  Service was formal, attentive, and professional.  Food is pricey, but the cost of entrees is discounted 20% for each diner who is age 55 or over and presents a Four Queens Club 55 player's card.  Thus, a Fillet Atlantis that is normally sold for $60.00 is reduced to $48.00 for young seniors.\n\n4-1/2 stars overall, and still very much downtown Vegas's diamond in the rough!"

You go down the stairs descend into a totally different world from the casino above. The brick walls and dark intimate feel of the restaurant are in total contrast to what is going on above you. Once downstairs, you are greeted by the manager as soon as you arrive and shown to your table.\n\nThe waiters here all wear tuxedos and it gives the restaurant a real elegant feel. We had no less than 3 waiters during our dinner. All were very professional and delivered great service. We did not have any issues during our meal.\n\nWe did not order any appetizers because they already give you so much food included with your meal. For starters, they bring you a bread basket with assorted breads in it. All were very good and tasty. We very much enjoyed the table side salad. It was terrific. Presentation was nice and they have so many ingredients to choose from. All items were fresh and it made for a great salad. \n\nThey brought us out a little raspberry sorbet cone before our entree as a pallet cleanser. It was a nice touch and did what it was supposed to do. My entree tasted fantastic after eating this tart little treat.\n\nFor entree I had the 16oz prime rib. It was very good. Nice and juicy and full of flavor. Served with great horseradish sauce, vegetables and garlic whipped potatoes it was a very nice dish. My wife had the chicken champignon which was very good as well. Loaded with mushrooms and served with a tasty sauce it was good.\n\nAfter your meal, you are brought a plate of chocolate covered strawberries, apricots and figs with a dip. This was a great touch to a wonderful meal. We were both full from our dishes but ate these little gems anyway. A lot of restaurants could learn something about customer service and service from Hugo's Cellar. \nOur whole dining experience from start to finish was great. I will definitely be returning here next time in Vegas for another wonderful meal."

I made my reservation the Friday morning before through the Open Table phone app. \n\nWe came down the stairway entry to Hugo's to see a dimly lit and beautifully set up lounge area. We approached the host to let him know we had reservations at 9pm, it was only 7pm, but we were hungry and figured what would it hurt to ask. \n\nThe host let us know that he would get a table for us right away, it would just be about 15 and we could sit at the bar and have a drink while we waited, so we did. \n\nJust as we finished our Jameson and Ginger Ales, the host came over to let us know our table was ready whenever we'd like to sit down. We followed him over to the host area, were he handed my wife a month stemmed red rose (that all ladies are offered). \n\n(In an effort to avoid tl;dr, I'll cut small details.)\n\nOur waiter, Dave, explained in detail everything that we would receive with our meal then gave us a minute to decide. Some fresh bread arrived, Dave returned and we chose. I went with the 16oz slow roasted prime rib and my wife chose the filet and shrimp prawns. \n\nOur table side salad service arrived, I went with their signature vinaigrette and my wife, the Caesar. The vinaigrette was absolutely wonderful, wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. An orange sweet twist that went very well with the fixings I chose for the salad (which was pretty much everything). My wife's Caesar was good, but not great. Nothing to complain about, have just had much better is all. \n\nOur sorbets came next in order to clean our pallet before dinner. We got another round of drinks, finished our sorbets and relaxed while waiting for our entrees. \n\nWhen our meals arrived they looked beautiful, prime rib was a perfect reddish pink for my medium rare and my wife's filet and shrimp was much larger then we expected. \n\nOne tip, get the garlic mashed potatoes as my red potatoes were nothing special and I need to salt them. \n\nHugo's was amazing, beautiful, intimate restaurant with a wonderful buzz. Service was incredible and on its game. Food was also wonderful. \n\nI would have given Hugo's Cellar 5 stars but here's why I didn't; my wife and I both had to season our meats. I expected the prime to be so amazing I wouldn't need to reach for the salt, unfortunately I did. Prime rib was definitely not seasoned properly as it came out without much flavor. After some salt and pepper it was incredible. \n\nOverall Hugo's Cellar is an excellent steakhouse experience without the added price of ala-carte. With definitely return and recommend."

They first give you a rose for the lady. Then after ordering they mix a custom salad right in front of you. After your salad a little sorbet to change your palette before your main course. We got the Filet Beouf and the Veal Oscar. Both were cook to perfection!"

The instant you walk down the steps the atmosphere and ambiance changes to elegance and peacefulness. The amazing service starts with the hostess and continues all the way through the end of the meal. The waiter and his team are extremely attentive to everything that's happening at your table. The rose that you get is pretty much a perfect rose, long stemmed, bloomed, flawless color, and smells great. \n\nThe dishes are a bit pricey but I want to say they give you a story along with the food. Everything that comes out is perfectly timed during the course of your meal and is done to enhance the food. I would say this place gives you more than a meal, you also get an uniquely memorable experience.\n\nThe banana's fosters was so good! and they make it fresh in front of you. I would recommend saving room for this! I had the beef wellington, even though it's my second time having it, it was pretty amazing. I ordered a straight up Caesar's salad, I don't know what it was...but I couldn't stop eating it even though I got a little extra. Maybe it was the freshness of everything, the dressing, or the crispy croutons I just couldn't stop eating it. For appetizers, we had crab cakes and the hot rocks. You can taste the freshness in the crab cakes from the first bite and gets even better with the sauce. If you happen to go into Hugo's after someone orders the hot rocks, you'll want to order it too. It smells delicious and it fills up the whole \nrestaurant. It's perfect for a date and adds to that experience."

I have very little experience eating at fancy steakhouses and fancy restaurants, though 2011 seems to be changing all of that.  Sometimes...perhaps in an optimistic perspective, change IS a good thing! =)  \n\nSo when I went to Vegas to meet up with my bf and his family, along with the soon to be bride & groom, our celebration dinner was held here, an old school steak house located in downtown Las Vegas in the Four Queen's Hotel & Casino.  It's downstairs from the casino, and it's \"like\" you're in a cellar. Cool points, yes.  When you step inside you already feel the old school lady & gentlemen-like vibe.  The ladies are greeted by the hostess with red long stem roses, WOW!  Takin' it back to the old school when chivalry was common and ladies wore dresses everyday.  Very cool.  \n\nOur large party was comfortably seated in the back in a room with a large table, a bit secluded from the rest of the customers but not too much where we felt completely alone.  You can tell that this restaurant pays attention to all the little details.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0nWxGsPixYLsyi49gyxQ?select=gAM4ACYEhIx06gGnZ2dieg \nGorgeous butter, looks like real roses.  I had to snap a picture before the guys dug into their bread and lavosh!\n\nThe menu here is pretty too, http://hugoscellar.com/files/menu.pdf , what I liked about this steakhouse was that they included the prices for each meal.  AND, if you read carefully, the meals COME with sides.  Unlike other fancy restaurants where you have to order your starch and your veggies, it's all included on your plate and in the price.  Even the side table service salad, which was incredibly delicious, is included.  My boyfriend and I tried the orange walnut dressing, which is more of a vinaigrette, and it was AMAZING! Toppings were extensive to, he goes around asking what you want.   And I give props to him, there were 13 of us I think!!\n\nOur servers were great, consistent in their service, and were patient while they took our orders.  We munched on the bread & lavosh and a bunch of us shared this lovely appetizer :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0nWxGsPixYLsyi49gyxQ?select=2tIJIqMtkeY_nKVA-CQbSw\nI've never had it baked or made like this, and I enjoyed it very much.  Now this is when I got confused---  my lack of experience in fancy restaurants will do this to me --- they brought out these: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0nWxGsPixYLsyi49gyxQ?select=uw_zJGr1XcaAgm0PinftyA \n\"Why are they giving  us dessert before our meal? \" Confused look but hey that looks yummy...  Come to find out, they're palette cleansers--- Wow spiffy!  It tasted like raspberry sherbert and it did its job pleasantly.  Cuz my main meal was scrumptious.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0nWxGsPixYLsyi49gyxQ?select=6GeGY9m4Z4N4Idq5KqtREQ\n\nmost of the guys ordered prime ribs:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0nWxGsPixYLsyi49gyxQ?select=w5lMYhy-RCtaiwM0dSVLCg\nall around the table everyone enjoyed their meals.  The meat was good and the sides were just enough to complement the hunk of meat we all had.  \nNow, there are choices of great desserts here, they're even on a cart for every one to see when you walk in.  But, the meal also comes with this: \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VG0nWxGsPixYLsyi49gyxQ?select=0nuarmXcKjJsZOBQNx-FlQ\n\nwhich to me, was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth that starts aching for some form of dessert after a good meal.  I absolutely loved this steakhouse and I'm glad the whole fam was able to celebrate the soon to be bride & groom here.  Great atmosphere, attentive staff, quality food, and attention to detail.  5 stars in my book!! Now all of you, go try it when you're in downtown vegas!\n\nYelp 365 challenge:  59/ 365"

Well, apparently this chick knows now.\n\nI came for a friend of my cousin's birthday.  At first glimpse, this place seems a bit cramped.  True to it's name (cellar), you go down stairs to get to this little place.  The lobby area is a bit small, so if it gets crowded, it may only  be standing room only.  Once we were seated, each girl was brought to the table and given a long stemmed red rose.  I know, cheesy ... but it was cute nonetheless.\n\nThey have a great selection of seafood and meat.  First course was salad.  Their salad was delicious, and I probably could have just made the salad my whole meal.  Not a side salad.  This baby takes up your whole plate, and comes with all the fixings.  Of course, you get to pick which fixings you want on it.  I also had some of their bread.  I especially enjoyed the lavosh.  It was crispy and flaky, and something different from the ordinary bread given at restaurants, although that was served as well.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I chose the filet mignon. Very tender, juicy, and well cooked (medium rare, just the way I like it).  I was pleased with my choice.  I also got to try the Escargot en Croute.  It was my first time tasting escargot, so I really don't have anything to compare it to.  However, I know I liked it, and will be willing to have it again.\n\nIf you're in the mood to be fancy, hit this place up.  However, it is definitely on the pricey side.  For me, great to try once on my dime, but I hope next time it'll be on someone else's."

You are consistently (in a good way) being checked on by the various servers.  You never have a moment of wanting.\n\nThe food was O M G!\n\nWe shared the lobster bisque.  I took the first bite, turned to husband, and said, \"THIS is what lobster bisque is supposed to taste like.\"  Great flavor and chunks of lobster.\n\nThe wine sommelier recommended a nice half bottle of pinot grigio for me to accompany my salmon.  I had it sauce nantua, which had a nice sauce with bay shrimp and crab meat.  I liked the accompanying veggies.  Husband had the Beef Wellington.  While we both enjoy our meals, husband does prefer his meat well, which is not possible with the Wellington.\n\nEnded the beautiful meal with a house cappuccino.  ;-) \n\nComplimentary salad is outstanding, as is the chocolate covered fruit.\n\nThis is a classy, old school Vegas place that is worth the trip to the Four Queens.

One star knocked off only because it says there's a dress code but people came in with shorts, etc. I would have not worn fancy pants and wore my lucky shorts into the restaurant if I knew a dress code won't be necessary. \n\nOn important news: food- the escargot and crab cakes were great as well as the bread was filling. Escargot had only 6 pieces. Crab cake 2 pieces.  I was ready for my entr\u00e9e  (2 filet mignon with foie gras). But to my surprise they gave a pallet cleanser of yummy sorbet in a cone. *i thought that was cool.\n\nUnfortunately yet fortunately surprise! A salad bar swings by and gives you a HUGE yummy salad (that's why there's a huge green plate on your table)....I wasn't expecting such a huge salad.\n\nMy stomach was filled to the brim with salad and i didn't have enough space for the entree as well as dessert? What the?  Chocolate dipped strawberries, figs, and apricots...as well as cream? *all complimentary  Food overload. Delicious but wow!\n\nAlso prior to dessert they show you a tray of desserts\n Be warned  that was delicious but not part of your meal so it'll cost more....but the creme Brulee was tasty.\n\nWhy Hugo? Why did you pounce the salad bar on me!?\n\nEntree unfortunately had a small sliver of dry foie gras (2 inches width and maybe 1/4 an inch of height) on top of the filet mignon.... so i would pass on that entree next time. Personally i do like a decent sized buttery melt in your mouth foie gras for the price. 60 bucks. *I've had fist sized foie gras or all you can eat foie gras for the same price at some restaurants. No joke. If on the menu...make it a decent size and don't skimp on it. Salad was deliciously huge....why not the entrees foie gras? *prior to the meal, I asked the waiter about the size of foie gras and he shaped it like a baseball size but it was more like a pog size (a half dollar coin size) Remember them pog toys?  My bro had rib eye and that was huge and delicious.\n\nOverall. Great place. Pricy but good for special occasions. Eat less of the salad and bread so you have more room for the entree.Also takeout box is fancy and tasty food."

I asked if they offered a side of saut\u00e9ed spinach and he replied in a rude manner that they didn't. ..so I asked well what do you have? To which he said only a medley of veggies.

Walking off of Fremont St into the romantic, cozy cellar was like being transported do a  totally different area.  Love the idea of the rose but more importantly the service was IMPECCABLE!  I mean come on, when the sommelier has a sippy cup to try each bottle you know you re in a good spot.\nFor once we did not over order and instead ordered the absolute perfect amount of food.  Started with the Shrimp scampi, made to order salad and then the hot rock app for two.  It was perfect- I mean the salad alone is a filler.  Two bottles of wine, the filtered Kona coffee and complimentary desserts really rounded out the meal.  What I really love is our server also agreed we ordered a great amount of food, I was nervous they would think we were being cheap but we always have tons of leftovers that we waste so thanks for being real with us!\nOut of the ten times I have been to Sin City I can honestly say I think Hugo's is my absolute favorite spot!

Upon entering the restaurant, all women are given a single red rose (classy). On this particular night, I ordered the filet de boeuf Atlantis. With the meal comes a table side prepared salad with pretty much every topping imaginable to choose from. Get the peppercorn ranch. You won't be disappointed. Back to the filet. Oh my. Filet mignon wrapped in bacon sitting on a bed of lumped crab. Does this really exist? Yes it does. \n\nTry to save room for dessert. You must get something flomb\u00e9d. Preferably the bananas foster. It is just such a delight to have your dessert prepared table side and then set on fire!!\n\nIf you are really feeling hungry, I highly recommend the Hugo's hot rock for 2. Table side they bring slabs heated to 500 degrees smear them with garlic and then sear pieces of chicken, filet mignon, shrimp and tuna. It is served with 3 different sauces and is quite delightful. \n\nShout out to John the best sommelier in town and the V team Vincent and Victor who really understand old school Vegas class.

Make a reservation ahead of time- they are often booked in advance.  \n\nAbout the experience:\nAs a local, Hugo's Cellar is my favorite restaurant in town and I have been bringing family and friends here for over a decade.  The service and food never disappoints.  \nLocated in the back of the smoky Four Queens Casino floor you will need to take the elevator down or use the stairs to enter the \"cellar\".  Upon being greeted, the Maitre d' will had each lady a long stem red rose and seat you at your table.  The server helpers are quick with the complimentary bottled water, bread and drink orders.  Hugo's has a pretty darn good wine list and a sommelier on staff to help you with your wine choice. \nThe menu is fairly simple with your classic seafood, chicken and steak choices.  I am a big fan of the Chilean Sea Bass prepared with the seasoned bread crumbs.  The Filet is always to perfection as well.  \nOne of the highlights of the meal is the table side salad preparation.  The waiter will freshly prepare your salad with an abundance of toppings such as pine nuts, boiled tomatoes, eggs, shrimp, multiple cheeses, etc.  Absolutely delicious.   \nAfter the salad course you will get a small sorbet cone to cleanse your palate for the main course. -- Fun, right?  \nI have often times skipped the main course just because the bananas foster here is fabulous.  It is one of the few restaurants left in the country that still does tableside flaming desserts.... and boy do they do it good.  It doesn't get much better than cool ice cream topped with ripe bananas, cinnamon and freshly made rummed caramel sauce.  \nIf you do not opt for a traditional dessert Hugo's does bring you freshly whipped cream served with chocolate dipped strawberries, figs and apricots.  \nFinally, don't forget the coffee.  This is my mother's favorite part- served with mint sticks and more hand made whipped cream.  If you have room, they do make an excellent chocolate martini served with it's own ice bucket and shaker.  \nWhile in Vegas, be sure to check this place out and bring your appetite.  You will not leave hungry:)"

The whole restaurant is very dark and romantic, with ladies being given a rose upon entrance (they put the roses at your table, and then wrap them for you to take when you leave).\n\nLarger parties have multiple teams of servers helping them, and a competant sommalier makes rounds, helping guests select the perfect wine pairings. Every entree comes with the signature Hugo's salad -- where they literally bring a salad bar to your table and make each salad to the specific diner's request. You can load up on pine nuts, artichokes, hearts of palm, shrimp, hard-boiled egg, parmesan cheese, anchovies, etc. -- it's all up to the diner.\n\nAfter the salad course, delicious sorbet is served in mini cones as a delightful palate-cleanser.\n\nThen the sumtious main course never disappoints - I'm a big fan of the Hugo Chicken - it's well-priced and yummy!\n\nEvery dinner is topped off with a selection of fruits dipped in chocolate and served with real whipped cream. In addition, you can select a tasty treat from the dessert tray, or pick on of their specialty flambe desserts. This time we opted for the flambe route - choosing the Bananas Foster. BEST. BANANAS. EVER!\n\nThe staff is so lovely - they really know the meaning of customer service. You leave Hugo's full, happy, satisfied, and with a lovely rose. You also get to take some amazing pictures in Downtown Las Vegas -- it's a seedy place, but those lights make for some killer photo ops. Also, if you're feeling seedy, you can stick around the Four Queens Hotel for some $5 blackjack on a Saturday night. I had lost $100 on the Strip, made it back and then some Downtown. \n\nHonestly, I've gone to other high-end restaurants and didn't leave nearly as satisfied as I did leaving Hugo's -- which is why I've been back again and again. Don't be fooled by the big names - Hugo's is the place to be!"

I had the ribeye, which was cooked to a perfect medium rare. My friend had the duck, which I intend to have the next time I go. Also had the Kona coffee after dinner, which was excellent. Make sure to stop by if you are downtown. They will treat you right."

The hub and I are big fans of this old-school gourmet room, where a couple can get some hooch with their dinner and still have a bill slightly over $100. It's dark and cozy, and the roses to the ladies add a cheesy yet sweet touch. Food isn't trendy or exotic, but is solid. I usually splurge on the filet with a bowl of lobster bisque. The salad cart service comes with the meal, and is always a treat. I look forward to the complimentary dessert tray with chocolate dipped fruit. And every time I have been there, the sommelier wears this Flavor Flav-esque clock/necklace thing. I have no idea what its purpose is, but it slays me!\n\nBlow off those posers on the strip, and head downtown for some authentic Vegas fun without breaking the bank!"

I had a very nice glass of single malt scotch and my wife has a glass of cabernet. For the main course I had veal oscar while my wife ordered the small prime rib. The veal was topped with king crab legs and smallish pieces of white asparagus, the veal was perfect but I was not crazy about their version of bearnaise sauce. It was like a gravy than a sauce. The prime rib was near perfect, not the best she ever had but close. salads and the huge side dishes had us too full for desert. Price was very reasonable as we got out for under $150. I am marking them down 1 star (food is 4 stars) because of the lack of  dress code enforcement, guys wearing sandals, jogging outfits and shorts."

And i'm so glad I went back.\n\nWe were a little early for our reservation so we went outside and had a drink and walked around for a few minutes.  Then we came back in and our table still wasn't ready, so we sat at the bar.  We ordered a shot of jack and a shot of johnny black.  The shots were in rocks glasses and were almost filled up.  for $7 each? like seriously? no complaints here!  So needless to say, b4 we even sat at the table, we had a small buzz.\n\nWe were led to the table with the rose, and of course I got such a great feeling and knew the dinner would be perfect.  The wine sommelier was humorous and knowledgeable.  I think we ordered a bottle of merlot, but i could be wrong! LOL (damn those \"shots\")\n\nMost of dinner was a blur...Of course, the salad was great! (one of my favorite parts of the meal) and I remember having the sea scallops for my main meal and I remember the portion being huge and really good.  He had the veal and loved it too.  \n\nOf course, the chocolate covered strawberries and apricot w/ the homemade whipped cream topped off a great dining experience, once again. :)\n\nLOVE THIS PLACE~"

It is no longer on the menu but they have been kind enough to make it for me every time I come except the last time.  They said they did not have the sauce ingredients.   OK that happens.

Valet parking at the Four Queens is slow and frustrating, I suggest self parking in the garage. I've eaten here a handful of times, and the food seems to be getting worse and worse. Table side flambeed duckling was dry and overcooked to the point of inedibility, tasteless steamed baby vegetables, fatty and overcooked meat, marginally fresh seafood, and a raunchy table side salad course complete with frozen baby shrimp, wilted iceberg lettuce, and sickly sweet dressings. Service was fine, but nothing remarkable. The high points of this place are the knowledgeable and fun sommeliers, decent dessert cart, a palette cleanser sorbet course, and a cool ambiance if you can ignore the drunk tourists at the adjacent table."

However, I've had better.\n\nI had the rib-eye and my friend got the filet with foie gras. First, my rib-eye was not medium rare - it was rare- and so I had to send it back. To me that was disappointing for the chef (or helper) to not get it right.  And the flavor was just alright. Oh they serve salad before hand and it was just alright.  I wasn't impressed.  They make it right in front of you which had its appeal.  The garnish was unimpressive.  The veggies were slightly overcooked.  \n\nMy friend's foie gras were so small that it's like getting a thin slice of meat at the deli counter.  It wasn't worth what they were charging.  And because the piece was so small the flavor didn't stick out.  \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't go back.  I've had better steaks in LA and I bet I could get better elsewhere in Vegas.  Spend your money on the bigger restaurants like Bobby Flay or something.  \n\nThe service to me was just ok. It took a long while for us to get service and greeted.  That was problematic for me.  \n\nSo all in all, for experience sake, sure go here. But for really good food for the money that you will end up spending there anyway, go elsewhere."

So when the opportunity arose to finally experience it, we jumped at it! \n\nLocated in the basement level of the Four Queens Casino downtown, you would never imagine such a place would be found here!\n\nItems Ordered:\n\n- New York Strip Steak 16 oz. (medium) ($58)\n(included: table side salad, garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables, and chocolate dipped strawberries)\n- Diet Coke ($3)\n- Three Layer Cake ($7)\n\nNew York Strip Steak, 16 oz. (5/5) Steak was very thick and juicy and cooked to perfection! Absolutely delectable!\n\nThe garlic mashed potatoes (4/5) did not disappoint as well. I just wish the portion size was a tad bit greater, but still, they were very good!\n\nThe table side salad (4/5) was a real treat in itself! I opted for the Caesar dressing with some shrimp, croutons, parmesan, and tomatoes. Very tasty and great portion size! Not a tiny salad by any means!\n\nChocolate dipped strawberries (5/5) were a great treat after the main course! Strawberries were HUGE! I could have had a couple more of these!\n\n- Three layer cake (4/5) was a very satisfying way to complete the meal. Not too sweet, but very delicious! Also was the perfect portion size, as I was stuffed after the main course!\n\nService (5/5)  Absolutely charming and attentive service! Some of the staff have fantastic stories about some famous people who have dined here in the 70's and 80's! It just adds to that classic, old school vibe that I absolutely love!\n\nMy only complaint was with how the deserts were presented. I was led to believe that the desert was part of the main entree due to the fact that the waiter approached us and just told us to pick one. Every other steakhouse I've been to will ask if you wish to have desert before asking you to just \"choose\" one. I was so stuffed by the awesome steak and potatoes that I probably would not have had desert otherwise. It's not  huge thing, but I didn't care for that. (minus 1/2 star)\n\nAmbiance (4/5) Classic, old school feel to the place. All of the waitstaff were in tuxedos. The room was tastefully decorated. Ladies were given long stemmed roses. Great little touches led to a fantastic atmosphere!\n\nThis was a great experience and I will be sure to recommend Hugo's Cellar to others as it was recommended to me!\n\n4.5 stars!"

They poured us bottled water and put out lavash and hard cold bread.  We ordered our meal quickly and it was a long time before they came over with the salad cart.  Nice idea but  would have been nicer on a cold plate.  The salad dressing was unremarkable.  The next course was a intermezzo in a cone(very cute)but the tray could have been cleaner. My husband asked to have a glass of Cabernet with his dinner and the waiter came over when his meal was 75% completed and asked him what he would enjoy. Really you even have a sommelier with a tastevin.\nThe steak came out done perfectly executed  but the side vegetables were like mush. Then it was time for dessert which was a nice touch, strawberries, figs and apricots dipped in chocolate.

            "review": "I heard about Hugo's Cellar through an email from TripAdvisor titled \"15 hidden gems\" which described attractions/restaurants around the world that weren't well known, but worth a visit. After a little more research I discovered that reviews on Hugo's were stellar. However, I can't say that I completely agree. To start, Hugo's is definitely \"hidden\" as it is tucked away under the Four Queens Casino in Old Las Vegas. (Old Las Vegas is worth the trip if you haven't been but expect a $30 can ride from the \"strip\")  Walking down the stairs into the restaurant definitely transforms you into a different world away from the crowd, noise and hustle of Vegas. There was no blaring music or flashing lights to disturb your meal. The cellar-like atmosphere with brick walls and dim lighting created a comfortable dining atmosphere. The well dressed clientele was a plus too - a very civilized meal compared to many Vegas restaurants which are sprinkled with the occasional obnoxious dinner guests. The service was some of the best I received in Vegas: friendly, attentive and knowledgable staff not just looking for an \"up-sell\". Thesommelier ,in particular, recommended a wine that wasn't on the menu, but exactly what we were looking and reasonably priced. \nBased on the atmosphere and service, Hugo's Cellar is absolutely a hidden gem in Las Vegas. The food, however, was nothing to brag about. I had pretty high expectations based on some of the reviews I read.  We started with the escargot which was overpowered by garlic and topped with a random puff pastry - quite tasty if you're a garlic fan but disappointing for those who actually enjoy escargot. It's basically escargot for those whole don't actually like the taste. Next was the famed \"table-side salad\". A novelty idea that brought fun and personalization to the meal, but honestly was limp romaine lettuce with mediocre toppings. More exotic lettuce choices would have been a plus. The tomatoes were mushy and lacked much flavor. I was a big fan of the pine nuts though! Fresher ingredients are necessary all around.\nFor the main course we shared the stuffed jumbo shrimp and the Tournedos Hugo (two five oz filets topped with foie gras and artichoke hearts). The shrimp were small (far from jumbo) and dry. The stuffing was bland and was overpowered by breadcrumb instead of crab that the menu boasted. The filets were mediocre. The fois gras was something you'd find in a can and I didn't see any artichoke hearts on the plate. I figured this dish would be extra special since it bears the restaurant's name; guess not.\nA free dessert of chocolate covered strawberries, figs as apricots with fresh whipped cream was included. We also tried the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was just average.\nBottom line: if you're in the area and looking to escape the Vegas atmosphere for a few hours you should consider trying out Hugo's Cellar (but not if you're on a budget). Otherwise it is not worth the trip to Old Las Vegas."

Dimmly lit but cheery with chatter, this is the old time \"romantic\" restaurant. \n\nOur booth had a little frosted flower light fixture mounted on the wall low, next to the table. Etched glass separated the booths to provide a little sound privacy. All the women received a long stem rose just before you're seated and the service was attentive from beginning to end.\n\nThere's a lot of gray hair in this place but it's a totally sweet place that doesn't smell old. Sure there's fake plants and Christmas lights. Sure the chandeliers feel a little like a billiards hall... but it's a really cute place.\n\nThe food was decent. My prime rib was cooked rare as I requested but I found the meat to be a bit too chewy. The Beef Wellington melted in my mouth though and I'd order it again.\n\nI love that a great salad, bottled water and chocolate dipped strawberries all come to complete your meal. You'll even get a little cone of sherbet between your salad and entree. \n\nFoodwise this place is fair.\nBut when you consider the service and the atmosphere this place is a solid 4 out of 5 stars."

He knows his stuff and pours an excellent manhattan (it comes in a carafe, so it's really two manhattans for the price of one!). The ambiance is all old school, and though you will feel wildly out of place in the casino all dressed up, it is appropriate for this steakhouse. \n\nThe only reservation we could get was 5:30 pm on a Saturday - make your reservations early! We started with the bread, which is assorted and very good. Their butter is like crack to me, so tray that too. My husband and I both got the salad made at the table. It was very good, but if I had paid $19 to have it as my entree, I would think it a little on the light side. My husband got the prime rib, which as massive, and I got the vegetarian option of the night. Oh my, was this a plate of awesomeness! Raviolis stuffed with portobello mushrooms, covered in a light pesto sauce, with yummy vegetables on he side. My husband could only eat half of the prime rib, but he enjoyed it. \n\nNext time I would bring a change of clothes to better mix in with the crazies in downtown, it was quite a show but we didn't stay long because we were out of place being dressed up. The hotel itself is kind of gross, and we saw some really unsanitary things happen on the casino floor, so be prepared. Hugos is worth it though!"

Yes it is nice to have a salad made at your table with your choice of fixings and dressings, but unfortunately that also limits your selection.  For example, they only have three types of dressing, I would prefer that  a nice generic salad be made in the kitchen where they could have serveral type of dressing available."

The servers are rude and short - maybe working at the same place for 30 years made them bitter.  We ordered a bottle of wine and almost finished it when our appetizer showed up almost an hour later.  The food is subpar and for their prices one can get superior food and service on the strip for less.

If Hugo's is a 4.5 star steakhouse than you may as well throw me in the kennel and lock up the key because this has got to be the most overrated and overpriced restaurant in las Vegas. I spent weeks deciding on where to eat to celebrate my cousin's engagement. after much deliberation I settled on Hugo's because everyone recommended the place from our hotel concierge  to the Yelp community. Well I should have known when the restaurant  asked me for my credit card number upon making a reservation that this was going to totally suck. Should have listened to my instincts....\n\nWe started with the mixed meat grill which consisted of a bunch of undercooked meats that they bring out on a sizzling platter. Nothing was seasoned at all so the meat itself tasted bland and dull. Plus the chicken was undercooked when they brought it out so we had to kind of guess when it was ready to eat. The various dipping sauces that came out with the platter were just entirely overpowering and the dish itself was just a pointless and lazy way to serve meats at a high end restaurant like Hugo's. Since we were a party of 7 people it was at this point that I began to worry that the rest of the meal would go downhill. Once again I was right... \n\nThe table side salad was a complete f^*%%ing joke. I'm angry just typing this out. It's like the salad bar they used to have at sizzlers except a waiter is actually mixing ingredients into your custom salad. The ingredients were cheap and pathetic. My shrimp were smaller than toe nail clippings. The lettuce was wilted and The salad itself wasn't even tossed well AT ALL. I basically had a glob of dressing that never made its way onto any of the lettuce.  Everyone hated their salad. Nuff said...\n\nNext We proceed to the entrees and nothing improves. I ordered the tenderloin and shrimp both of which were drowning in a cream sauce. The shrimp themselves were actually cooked well. They were also deveined. My steak was small and bland once again. Albeit there was no fat which I will say was nice. The veggies on the plate were a complete afterthought and the mashed potatoes tasted like Ora Ida box mix. I was too embarrassed to ask how everyone else's meal was but judging by the half eaten plates i don't think a single person enjoyed their meal here. The assorted chocolate covered fruits at the end were a nice gesture but unfortunately they did not make up for the lackluster meal our party was served that evening. \n\nI love old school steakhouses but only if it's done right. This was not done right. The fact that we were the last table in there on a Saturday night at 10pm was probably a bad sign. Oh and the fire alarm went off twice during our meal. The staff never came over to apologize so we basically sat at our table and listened to that loud noise for a good 15 minutes. It was probably a sign from God that i made a fatal mistake by eating here. \n\nNever again."

The food was good and the staff was great.  Large quantities! We were miserable, in a good way, when we left.  Fantastic martinis!!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we actually went to Gordon Ramsey's Steak on our actual anniversary and it was like apples and oranges to Hugos.  It was on a different level.

He was blown away by how perfect his steak was.  Our chicken was delicious as well.  Nice and tender with an awesome sauce.  We were so stuffed from our meals that we didn't order any extra dessert.  They bring a complimentary dessert to your table.  Chocolate covered strawberries and apricots and I believe dates.  This was a wonderful ending to an unforgettable meal.

Upon arriving to our reso's, we were each given a long stem red rose. My heart immediately melted because really, who doesn't like flowers. We sat at a very nice table and had 4 waiters attend to each of us. It's like we each had our own waiter. We were given so many options, so many recommendations and so many choices. They explained to us that Hugo's was one of the last places that have continued their \"special service\" of table side salad, picking our own sides, and including dessert in our experience. We each ordered a dirty martini and not only was it delicious but it came out in the cutest container and crystal holder. (please see attached picture). It was like 4 martinis in one. My kind of drink! A nice gentleman came by and made our salad, asked each one of us what we wanted and what we didn't. It's tableside salad making in which you figure out how different you and your taste buds are than your friends. Haha! Of course, mine was the yummiest. After we finished the salad, we were give cutie patootie little tart sorbet ice-cream cones to clean our taste buds for our main dish. This was sooooooooo cool. I wonder why high end LA restaurants don't use this cool and cute tool. Anyhoo, My friend and I shared the Ribeye with crusted horseradish (16 ounces) YUMO! There is an additional $25 they charge for splitting your meal but it's soooooo worth it. They split it, everyone gets the same amount of sides (asparagus, rice, mashed potatoes). My other two friends split the Filet Mignon with crusted horseradish and theirs was just as delicious. Dessert came out a short time after. We got chocolate dipped strawberries, figs and chocolate dipped apricots with the MOST delicious whip cream you have ever tasted. Everything was so excellent. Service, service, food, service. They appreciated us as customers and we appreciated everything about them. The bill came and we were shocked! This time shocked because we didn't expect a place like this to be soooooooo reasonable. We love Hugo's Cellar and it's amazing staff. Keep up the great job."

The atmosphere is interesting, it definitely feels throw back and its nice that's its literally steps down so it feels like it is in a cellar.  Its dimly lit and has a very cozy feeling.  They give all the women a rose, which is cheezy and vintage in the best way.  I did really dislike the fact that there was no bathroom in the restaurant, you have to go into the casino and the casino and the bathrooms are not near as nice as the restaurant.\n\nThere is a lot included with entrees.  This is really nice because it allows you to enjoy the evening with spaced out servings.  However one of my complaints were its way too much food.  We started with a bottle of wine and the bread/lavosh.  I love the fact that sommelier serves and tastes every single bottle.  At other places we went to they didn't seem to bother for cheaper bottles.  The bread was really good and I was big fan of the lavosh, I haven't had good lavosh in ages.    There is sorbet that was nice to cleanse the palate.  \n\nThen was the salad cart.  Again vintage, but I loved it and honestly wish more places did this.  It's not just a garden salad there are tons of selection of items to add and different dressings.  My husband and I can both be picky, so it was nice to not ask to hold things and just be able to add what you want.  Everyone said it on here and it really is when of the best salads I have had.  \n\nThen with your entry comes vegetables and potatoes.  I got the ten ounce filet.  I love filet but this was about 2 times too big for me.  It was amazing and the Bearnaise was really good, but I was stuffed just getting through half of it with everything we had before.  I wished they had a smaller option.  My husband got the filet with shrimp and loved that.  \n\nThe chocolate dipped fruit was really good and nice to end the evening.  I was so stuffed I only ate one.  I wanted more of everything, so it was hard to control myself, but next time I will eat less bread to save room for entree and dessert.  Overall service was great, very attentive.  We were in a little bit of a hurry and they were good about taking care of us quickly."

As we walked into the 4 Queens, we had no idea what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised that we were greeted with roses. We ordered our drinks and food and had a nice bread basket with a table side salad made for us. Our food came and the steak was perfectly cooked. The king crab legs were soo good. Before we left, the wait staff surprised my sister with a small chocolate cake and a beautifully decorated plate for her birthday. A great place to splurge on a nice meal and wonderful atmosphere."

            "review": "During a recent trip to Vegas, I suprised my wife with dinner at Hugo's Cellar in Vegas. She and I both loved it.  If you want to score points on a romantic date, this is the place to go for dinner.\n\nIt's located in Downtown Las Vegas, at the 4 Queens. When we walked downstairs, they greeted us and then gave my wife a fresh red rose. \n\nWe were seated and immediately were offered service. I've had the opportunity to dine at many establishments around the country and few can match the service we had at Hugo's. The customer service we received was excellent. \n\nMy wife had the New York Strip and I had the Rack of Lamb. The steak was good and the lamb was EXCELLENT. Both dishes came with salad (prepared table-side) , asparagus and garlic whipped potatoes. For desert, they brought us chocolate covered fruit and a wonderful blackberry/rasberry cheese cake.\n\nExcellent experience overall. I would love to come back. The only thing I wished they had here was a dress-code. The decor is a little old-fashioned but, then again, we didn't go for the decor. \n\nVisited April 2011"

            "review": "The girlfriend and I were checking out Fremont Street on a Wednesday evening.  It was dinnertime and we were hungry.  After some cursory research, we decided to give Hugo's Cellar a try.  Tucked away downstairs off of the casino floor at Four Queens, Hugo's Cellar is an unassuming looking place, which, from its d\u00e9cor, looks like time stood still stopping somewhere in the late-60s/early-70s.  That said, this only adds to the dining experience as Hugo's Cellar exudes old school charm and harkens back to the day when going out to dinner at a nice restaurant was truly considered a special occasion.\n\nWe didn't have reservations, not that we probably needed them on this particular mid-week evening.  Upon stepping up to the host stand, the ma\u00eetre-d handed a red rose to my girlfriend (and all women who dine at the restaurant) before leading us to our table.  At its heart, HC is a steak place, but the menu has a good selection of seafood choices as well as lamb, veal, chicken, and duck.  We opted for the Chateaubriand and Lobster for Two which consisted of a roasted center-cut tenderloin filet and broiled lobster tails with a side of green and white asparagus.  Soon after our order was placed, a cart wheeled up to prepare custom, made to order salads at our tableside.  The salad was made with fresh romaine lettuce and topped with pretty much anything you could think to throw on a salad.  Think salad bar at Fogo de Chao, not Ponderosa.  After our salads were cleared away, David our lead server delivered two small cones of raspberry sorbet to cleanse our palate.  Next, our main course was served up.  The chateaubriand was cooked to a perfect medium rare doneness, as requested, and the good-sized lobster tails were also flawlessly prepared, moist, tender and flavorful.  The GF remarked it was the best lobster tail she'd ever had.  A meal like this required a good, hearty red wine.  HC has an extensive and surprisingly affordable wine list.  Vince, the extremely knowledgeable and personable sommelier, guided us through the list, but we knew exactly what we wanted when we spied a bottle of the 2008 Frank Family Cabernet Sauvignon ($68).  Frankly (no pun intended), this wine at the price was a steal especially given the fact that a bottle retails in the $40-50 range online!  The 2007 Frank Family Cab was the best wine I had the pleasure of tasting this year and the 2008 shared virtually all of the same, pleasurable characteristics of the 2007.  At this point, I didn't need anything else to eat.  Yet, a plate of chocolate-dipped strawberries, dried apricots, and figs showed up at the table to close out our thoroughly enjoyable meal.      \n\nCompared to the Strip, Downtown Vegas and Fremont Street lacks the wide array of fine dining choices.  However, Hugo's Cellar easily dispels the notion that there isn't any fine dining to be found and that you need the culinary draw of a big name, celeb-chef to be successful.  Hugo's Cellar isn't a cheap night out, but it delivers quality, quantity, and among the highest levels of service I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  Old school, indeed!"

            "review": "This classic Vegas restaurant in the cellar of Four Queens is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  The table side salad, steaks and wine service/selection are unbeatable.  Also, although it is expensive, it's a great value when compared to some of the newer more flashy/trendy restaurants.  You definitely don't want to miss the table side salad which is the best salad ever.  I don't think you'll find better steaks anywhere.  I usually get the 10 oz. fillet, but last night I got it wrapped in bacon served on top of crap meat...spectacular.  The table and wine service are definitely 5 stars and so is the food.  If your staying on the strip, it is worth the trip downtown to eat at Hugo's Cellar."

One of my favorite parts was the table side salad preparation because you have so many options, it's like a salad bar! The cocktails are so generously pored with an overflow glass that you really only need one! You think it can't get any better until you are served your entree! Perfectly prepared! \n\nThis is a MUST for anyone who wants the classic Vegas steakhouse experience!"

Unfortunately you have to walk through all the drunken riff raff just to enjoy the restaurant. \nService is some of the most professional, courteous, and attentive group you will find. We never had a need or wait at any point, but weren't hovered over. The house sommelier picked a perfect wine for us and didn't try to sell us on the high side. \nIn terms of the food, everything was cooked to perfection and timed just right. We never felt rushed or waiting too long for the next course. \nFor the price, it's on par or a little bit less than other fine steak houses around town. \nMy only negative is the dress code. Even though my wife and I focused on ourselves it's hard to miss abundance of cargo shorts and t-shirts. Please enforce a dress code!!!"

He is VERY knowledgable....just tell him your price range and you'll be surprised.\n\nEnjoy!"

The service was amazing, you do not have to ask for anything, the servers are 5+++ as they are the most attentive I have ever seen, and they are smiling to boot.\n\nThe food is really good, and everything is clearly fresh and not rubbery or ready made tasting. We had a very nice unrushed dinner, but as I mentioned before they are in the $40 and up price range for your meals. Not too bad for the quality of food and service. It is just a bit high when you think of Vegas.\n\nI come everytime I come to Vegas, as everyone deserves a nice dinner from time to time and I consider Hugo's to be a treat. Just don't forget to get your parking validated when you settle your check."

Leave some room for the salad also - very good and well served.   I also like their menu layout and pricing plan - they don't nickel and dime you.  I look forward to my next visit."
