But what this tells me is most people will settle for mediocre cupcakes or cakes in this valley which is great for Retro Bakery. They are way over priced for the quality of cupcake. The cake part taste like a cheap box mix and the icing is not about the buttercream.  My kids don't like the cupcakes either.  Won't recommend."

I'm not a huge cupcake fan but I find myself craving these babies all of the time. I know that everyone raves about their Buttercream, but I'm more of a cake person and Retro definitely delivers. The shop is pretty far from me, but if they were in Henderson, I would be in trouble. All of the flavors I've tried have been delicious. I will definitely be ordering my birthday cake from Retro this year."

Well, last month I had a craving for cupcakes and thought it would be fun to surprise the kids. So, I went back. Again, the service is great! They are so friendly there! This time I have to rave about the cupcakes. The cinnamon toast one was sooooo good that I actually dream about it. :)  The cupcakes just really hit the spot. Sure, I could make my own cupcake and it would be similar to their cupcakes. But I cannot duplicate their buttter cream and that is where the magic is. I've been having to practice great will power not to drive over there every week!"

I had butterscotch which was sooooo good! I also sampled bites other strawberry/vanilla, peanut butter chocolate, pumpkin seasonal special, everything was phenomenal. The girls in the front were really friendly and they have a loyalty program.   If your in Northwest LV check this place out delicious cupcakes;)"

I loved the dense frosting and moist cake. They paired very well. The flavors available will satisfy most picky \"Desserters.\" A word I just made up to describe those who love dessert more than dinner. If you find yourself with some time to kill on your trip to Las Vegas, this is the place to go. It's a bit out of the way, but if you're sober and adventurous, it will be worth the time and trip. The Milk and Cookies cupcake is the Key."

I'm a HUGE fan of cupcakes, maybe that's putting it lightly. I'm obsessed with them. big, small, edible and non-edible I love them all. So since moving to Vegas i've tried to seek out the \"best cupcake in town\" so I decided to give Retro a try. And let me tell you what i'm glad I did. Retro's cakes are AH-MAZING! The flavors are great, the cakes are moist and the frostings are on point. My favorites are the coconut, hop scotch(butterscotch), and the blueberry pancake. The other flavors are awesome too, there's different specials on different days so check their website for the up to date flavor list. Even though it's way up in the NW it's worth the trip to get some delicious baked goods!! www.retrobakerylv.com"

The most disappointing one was a Carmel chocolate one with chopped peanuts. Both myself and my mother thought that one was going to be the yummiest since we both love nuts in our sweets but the peanuts had a stale taste. The frosting was too sweet for my taste as well."

For those naysayers that complain about the price, I think the price is fair for what you are getting because they homemade with lots of love and no preservatives! Plus I would much rather support a locally run family friendly small business any day, even if it does mean I have to pay a bit more for a little piece of heaven :) But, they are sweet, I will agree with that, that is why, even though we live within walking distance, we rarely indulge in Retro goodies, because we can't handle the sweetness overload unless it is a special occasion!"

Time and again, people chose Retro.\n\nKari and Brian were super helpful. I didn't want a lot of fuss, but I knew I wanted cupcakes and a cake that went with our themes - an Elvis wedding and our reception in an Irish Pub (we met on St. Patty's day).\n\nThey made us an Elvis \"record\" cake with lemon cake and mixed up the cupcakes with lemon, chocolate and vanilla with an adorable sugar shamrock on top. Kari even tried to honor my wish for cream cheese frosting on the record cake (no dice though, it didn't set well enough).\n\nI'm not much for frosting, so I don't get the whole MOUNDS of buttercream concept but the cake was delicious. I loved it so much that when I couldn't find a fork the day after our wedding, I just picked it up and ate it!\n\nThe prices were more than reasonable and I felt completely confident that everything would be perfect. Thank you Retro!"

The theme for her party was definitely not typical, but they were able to accommodate my request and replicated the image that I sent over perfectly!  The price point was better than 3 other bakeries I had contacted.  I chose to have the cake delivered.  When Brian arrived with the cake, the color of the frosting border wasn't what I had specified.  He offered to take the cake back to the store, fix it, and have it back in time for the party!  This was definitely above and beyond and we truly appreciated how awesome they treat their customers.\n\n The cake we chose was white cake with almond buttercream and it was seriously AMAZING!  All of the guests at the party commented on how delicious it was and asked where we had ordered it from.

I'm not a cupcake expert, but I can't help but to think that my tastebuds don't lie...and they say that Retro Bakery is the best! I love every flavor, except the one that has bacon. Somehow, I feel like I wasted the opportunity to eat a decadent, delicious treat when I eat that one. Conversely, I'd have to say that my favorite one is the cookies and cream, because you get two treats in one! I always get at least a 4-pack of cupcakes, even though it's very dangerous to have that many around at one time. I always end up eating all of them within two days, lol! At least I only go there for special occassions...Retro Bakery is a special place! P.S. They are teacher-friendly, which I appreciate!"

Anyway I love reading these reviews that basically say this place is amazing if you like sweets, but I don't so here's 2 stars. The tagline is It's all about the buttercream, so your probably not going to go in expecting something savory.  IT'S SWEET SWEETNESS at it's best.  \n\nHonestly I can't remember the first time I visited. I might of had a coupon from a book or something. That's usually how I end up trying places. Anyway I am glad I did because they have the best cupcakes   .      I've been to other places in town with cupcakes and nothing compares to the variety, flavor, and ratio of cake to cream.  \n\nMaple Bacon is the business here.  I get at least one every time I visit.  The chocolate fountain for chocoholics is also amazing. Milk and cookies is great too. Each month they have a special cupcake they produce and many of them are amazing, and some are not as amazing lol. HOW MANY TIMES CAN I USE AMAZING IN A REVIEW?! \n\nOk so if you sign up for the Eclub you get an email every month with the flavors that are in, the flavors that are out and a special 1 day out of the month deal where you can get some cupcakes as cheap as a DOLLAR each.  Also on Saturdays (I hope this is still in effect because I'm off this saturday) they have these LOADED chip cookies for like 1.50 each. They are ginormous(spell check did not go off for ginormous, that is awesome), and I swear there are more chips (chocolate, white chocolate, butterscotch, and peanut butter) in them then there is cookie. \n\nAs a final note, the staff is always really friendly when I go. I've visited on several occasions and bought a cupcake for a friend's bday and they are nice and put a happy birthday plastic stick type thingy, whatever its called on it.    =)"

After emailing Brian back and forth a few times, we came up with a design that we thought would look cool and went for it.\n\nI didn't get to see the cake before I got to my venue, but when  I walked in and saw it sitting there, I was stunned. It was even more beautiful than I could have pictured it. People came up to us all during dinner commenting on how amazing it looked.\n\nBut then everyone started telling us they didn't like wedding cake, because wedding cakes don't taste good. \n\nThose folks all got a HUGE suprise when we cut into that cake. It was freaking AMAZEBALLS DELICIOUS! We got three layers, each a different flavour. The cookies and cream cake went like hotcakes, the cherry cheesecake was devoured and the peanut butter cup, well, let's just say that one almost didn't get served because that was the one I cut into and I almost ate the entire layer myself. \n\nI wish I had a picture right now to post, because it was seriously the coolest wedding cake I have ever seen. I might be biased, but whatever, it was my cake and it was amazing. I have leftovers so I will be sitting here in my pajamas today eating wedding cake for breakfast."

Brian delivered them himself, with an adorable child in tow. The cupcakes arrived Saran-wrapped in a large white box with a clear top, instantly inducing drool. The buttercream was light and fluffy without being overly supermarket bakery toothache sugary and was applied in a perfect dollop. The glazed Coffee and Donuts one was my favorite. A DONUT and COFFEE in one!

Workers were so dead. We were saying how we were so juiced to try their cupcakes because of the rave reviews only to have blank stares. Wow. Cupcakes are supposed to be fun not depressing.\n\n2) Cupcakes are gorgeous but oh-so-bland like the workers. It was so disappointing. All I taste is super sweet frosting and nothing else. The cupcakes were very inconsistent in texture. One was dry another was so moist I think it wasn't cooked all the way. \n\nMy partner and I got 2 cupcakes each. All different flavors. We couldn't even finish 1 because of the extremely sweet frosting overpowering everything. Took a bite from the other 2 to see if it would be different. Nope. I am being very generous with my 2 stars feeling that the overall experience was bad. Bad attitudes to match the bad cupcakes. There goes $10 we could have used on Starbucks. My partner says, \"Starbucks is worth the calories. These aren't.\" LOL. With that said, if you love sweet to the point of tooth ache and rot, this is your spot."

It's obvious to Yelpers that know her that she has a sweet tooth.  But you know what?...I just discovered that I have one too.  Prior to actually visiting Retro, I've sampled the Red Carpet (Red Velvet), Glazed Donut, and Peanut Butter Cup Cupcakes.  Needless to say, I couldn't wait to get more.  \n\n\nMy Review: \n-Glazed Donut:  Tasted exactly like it's named.  If you love donuts (glazed ones) and love cupcakes (good ones), then their Glazed Donut needs to be on your list. \n\n-Red Carpet:  I only got a little taste and I know it's red velvet, but it's the buttercream that I will never forget.  The buttercream has the perfect texture & sweetness for anything red velvet. \n\n-Peanut Butter Cup:  Oh Boy...my favorite.  And Yes, I do love me some peanut butter.  That being said...if this wasn't good, I'd say it.  At Retro, they managed to combine a creamy peanut butter to a fluffy chocolate cupcake.  So Good!!  Just curious...how much better would this cupcake be if it was on a vanilla cake?  So far so good...this is just a wishlist.\n\n-Salted Caramel:  Just had a small sample recently and gots to say...this can rival the Peanut Butter Cup.  \n\n-Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk:  This is cookie, not a cupcake.  I couldn't resist on my visit here.  I haven't found the perfect Peanut Butter Cookie, but Retro's is pretty damn close.  \n\nLooking for some moist, fresh, and cupcakes with style, then give Retro Bakery a shot.  Maybe it's a good thing that I'm not on this side of town too often.  My belly would go broke.  But when I'm craving some peanut butter cupcakes and cookies, I sure know where to go."

            "review": "So I'd love to give Retro a good review but I can't. I'm getting married in Las Vegas in August and a friend of mine who was vacationing in Vegas brought me a dozen cupcakes from their bakery to taste. Most of them were yummy.... even though they had traveled from Vegas to Los Angeles. The problem is not the cupcakes.... it's the staff and their willingness to accommodate the customer. \n\nMy wedding is on a Sunday afternoon, Retro Bakery is not open on Sunday. I was told they would deliver the night before to the reception restaurant. I found out this week that the reception restaurant cannot accept baked goods a day in advance due to the health code. I asked Retro what I could do to get their cupcakes at my reception and rather than having someone come in and deliver on Sunday (which would take all of maybe an hour) to make a sale and a happy customer.... they told me to ask the hotel I was staying in if they would keep the cupcakes in one of their refrigerators overnight and then I would have to get someone to transport them to the restaurant. Excuse me? I'm paying $400 for cupcakes (it's only sugar and flour people!) only to have to schlep around a hotel in Vegas to get them to my reception? I think Retro could care less about their customers.... they think they are way too cool for school. I found another bakery that not only delivers in Vegas on Sundays but they also don't charge for delivery and set up (unlike Retro).... Sorry, maybe I'm not cool enough for Retro but I think with the way the economy is today that something as small as a delivery should be workable. This is the first review I have made on Yelp.... I just thought people should know that Retro will not go out of their way for their customers...."

I live nearby so I decided to treat my siblings to cupcakes after dinner tonight. \n\nWe ended up with:\n-Peanut butter chocolate - frosting tastes like incredibly sweet peanut butter. Cake tastes like a bland wacky cake.\n\n-Lemon Raspberry - sister said it had zero raspberry flavor and that the frosting tasted like the smell of lemon scented bathroom cleaner.\n\n-Glazed doughnut - brother said it tasted like just plain white cake mix.\n\n- Hopscotch - sister (she's 9) liked the frosting, despite it being so sweet it could make you squint but said the cake part tasted like nothing.\n\nWe all sampled each cupcake, so I can attest to the validity of my siblings' critiques.\n\nFrosting is so sweet that it is inedible and the cake tastes like nothing at all. I was expecting some intense, quality flavors. I didn't taste a hint of butter for a business whose tagline is \"it's all about the buttercream.\"\n\nWhile I'm happy to support a local business with my money and the cupcakes looked gorgeous, the cupcakes themselves were not as good as even a boxed mix and the frosting is too sweet - very unbalanced."

Anyway, I'm glad I dealt with their nags because they stopped nagging after trying the cupcakes. We ordered the cookies and cream (the frosting tasted exactly like a cookies and cream but being buttercream it was surprisingly perfectly made because it would have been easy to make it too sweet but instead it was perfect amount of sweetness with the exact flavor of cookies and cream), cinnamon toast (tasted like the cinnamon toast crunch w/ french toast texture), pink lemonade (was a good surprise it was the perfect amount of citrus lemon flavor with a good balance of sweetness), peanut butter cup (my fav the frosting was like a blended nutterbutter not too have on the peanut butter but not too sweet also it was amazing and combined with a perfect chocolate cake it was totally reeses pieces cake), and maple bacon (wow, bacon pieces in the cake and a crumbled topping it was a pleasant surprise and it was exactly what makes breakfast plate of french toast, maple syrup and bacon it was insanely good and perfect representation of breakfast without being too sweet and the cake was great with bacon bits, try it you won't be disappointed). There were cupcakes I really wanted to try to they were mostly sold out no surprise but I will come back for sure when I go back to Vegas!\n\nThey pride themselves in their buttercream frosting and I'm not a frosting girl but a cake needs frosting and let me tell you they've made some great frostings only to accompany moist well flavored cake. Alone the frosting would be great and the cake alone is also great. =)\n\nI think their cupcakes are cheap for the quality of their cupcakes. Try it you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe people that work there are very friendly and easy to talk to and we were only there for a few minutes. Nice people! Thanks for the cupcakes! We love it!\n\nTip keep it in room temp."

The cake has a great consistency- not too dense but not falling apart, either.  But the icing is just way, way too sweet for me.  When I have one of these cupcakes I have to share (gasp!) because I'm afraid I'm going to upset my stomach.\n\nI've tried several flavors, the most recent being chocolate/peanut butter frosting, vanilla/salted caramel frosting, and a cookies 'n cream.  I hate to say it, but the flavors of all these frostings really didn't come through.  Not enough peanut butter flavor, not enough caramel (and zero salt).... You get the picture.  The only cupcake that tastes amazing to me every time is the Hop Scotch.  There's loads of flavor from the butterscotch and it pairs nicely with the vanilla cupcake.  But again, I have to share so I don't get an instant cavity.\n\nSo, as for the cupcakes I'm going to say they are A-Ok and worth three stars.

These are cupcakes. The finger appetizers of overweight gods. I run up and begin to eye everything I want, as well as what my family would like. A lot of their selection is out, but we did come literally half an hour before they close. Understandable. \n\nTheir cupcakes are visually stunning. We take a dozen. Churro, Apple Cider, Maple Bacon, Chocolate Fountain (x2), Peanutbutter Cup (x2), Glazed Donut, Drumstick, and two I cannot recall the names of (I think Raspberry Lemonade and the March Flavor of The Month x2). $29.95, if I recall correctly.\n\nUnfortunately these are a hit or miss for me. They either wow me, or are nearly inedible. The Chocolate Fountain was not good at all. The buttercream was so overwhelming, and the cake was just dry and tasteless. It's almost too much sweet...and that, in my case, is a very rare and unusual statement. The same goes for the Raspberry Lemonade (or whatever the yellow one was). There was a distinct lacking in the flavor of the cake itself; overpowered by the buttercream.  \n\nThe March Flavor of The Month was very good. The cake was amazing and moist. The frosting was a little stale, but it was tasty. It had a carrot cake frosting, and the cake itself had some delicious nuts with a very subtle vanilla flavor. Awesome. \n\nThe Drumstick looked great! Stunning visual appearance! My father loves the actual ice cream cones, so I definitely wanted to grab him one. He said it was alright. It didn't really appeal to him, as the name and appearance had. It was just vanilla, but it was moist and sweet. \n\nI don't know what was up with the Maple Bacon. I was excited because reaching outside of a comfort zone in baking is always fun and impressive. But...only when you do it right. My fianc\u00e9 took one solid bite and placed it back in the box. The flavors were a good attempt, but the textures of the toppings mixed with the buttercream just didn't work for us. And the actual \"maple\" taste was a bit overwhelming. \n\nI haven't tried the Churro, Apple Cider, or Peanutbutter yet. But I will definitely update and edit my review based upon their flavor and overall execution. Five stars for appearance! So far, two for actual taste."

My son had the Cotton Candy (I tasted the frosting which really did taste like cotton candy) and the Cookies and Cream, both of which he loved.  My husband had the Chocolate Fountain and the Pucker Up.  Both were very, very good.

I did see a few people had written some Stella reviews on this business, so after doing some recon from the NorthWest Yelp Crew Ty W and Mary S, I made my way to Retro with little care for my cavities.\n\nLocated on North Durango drive, in North West Las Vegas. Retro Bakery has established itself in a small strip mall. When locating it using your conventional smart phone it will be a little odd in how it displays the route, so keep your eyes peeled.\n\nOnce Inside I was greeted by very helpful young lady, being my first time she went through everything that was on display and pricing.

Something I might have to look into in the future.\n\nIf your living over this side of town and are needing birthday or just any old reason to get something sweet, Retro Bakery seems to be the place to come. \n\n\nOverall\nService: 4-5\nFood: 5-5\nCleanliness: 5-5\nComing back: Yes"

I paid a decent amount for my cake and its was dry and not very good. The design, colors and flowers were all wrong so I called to complain and all they did was say sorry?? I'm not the type of person to complain to company's but I was so disappointed because it was my wedding cake...  Not no birthday cake. Don't think I'd go back..."

Their website suggests 24 hours notice for vegan orders; however, these guys were so amazing that they accommodated my request on the same day. What is more, they even worked with me to get the cupcakes delivered since I live across the country.  Retro Bakery has some of the best costumer service I've ever experienced. I only wish that I were there to taste what I'm sure were amazing cupcakes. I could extol the virtues of Retro Bakery for many paragraphs. Instead I will conclude with the strongest possible recommendation. Run don't walk to Retro."

I'm No Sugar Junky nor Cake Feen of any sort but this place Transforms me into A CUPCAKE MONSTER!!!!! *RRRRRAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHRRRRRR!!!!!!!*\n\nFirst Time, I had the Honor to try this Whimsical Place, I had no Idea what was coming.... Every Flavor Offered Looked Like Winning Combinations?! So Ordering Every Single Cupcake would solve the Dilemma?! Well, that's exactly what happened.. I had the chance to try ALL (24) of their current cupcake creations at the time, including the cupcake of that day (I guess this changes daily or so..)! Since this place was quite a drive and the staff did advise that the cupcakes could be placed in the freezer and would stay fresh for a few months, I had time to devour them in a more realistic pace.. That Sealed the Deal! Alright, sounds Dandy to me, lets do it!\n\nLiterally Every Single Cupcake was PHENOMENAL!!!!! But here's a few that Tantalized my Taste Buds and made a statment that Stuck on Me, Permanently:\n\nHop Scotch (\"OUR #1 SELLER): There's a reason it's their #1! \"Vanilla cake topped with vanilla buttercream dipped in butterscotch ganache\"\n\nPeanut Butter Cup: If you like Reese's, then this should inspire you!\n\nCinnamon Toast: Remember the cereal \"Cinnamon Toast Crunch\".. Well, this took me on a blast to the past!\n\nRed Carpet: Like red velvet.. their almond buttercream topping does bring it up a couple notches and steers away from the typical velvet cakes.\n\nMint Chocolate Chip: \"Thrifty's\" or \"Baskin Robbins\" Ice Cream was the first thing that came to my Mind.. True Classic, without a Cone and it didn't Melt!\n\nThis is Undeniably an Honorable Institution and their cupcakes should be regarded as a Vegas Staple! I could only 'ZzzZZDREAMZZzzZ' of cupcakes being this Asteroid Shattering, Earth Shaking and Comet Shooting AMAZING, to say the Least!!!!"

She immediately said that if I wanted white cake, to try the butterscotch one (the official name has slipped me) but that if I wanted chocolate, they have a cupcake with both milk and dark chocolate. Not leaning toward one or the other, we decided to get both. They had a wide selection of other cupcakes too, but if you are new to a place, best to ask what is good to get. \n\nWe didn't eat our cupcakes right away, which is why I gave this place 4 stars. We saved them, in the bag, for about 8 hours till after dinner that day. The cake was moist, though you could tell that the elements had begun to get to it-not too much but I could notice. The chocolate cupcake was my favorite!? It wasn't too chocolatey at all, and I was surprised that the dark and milk chocolates didn't overpower one another. The butterscotch one was delish too. Butterscotch isn't my favorite flavor, but it surprised me. Not too sweet, and I liked the choice of the white cake to accompany it. I found it to be sweet too.\n\nI'd definitely come back and try their other flavors. Oh, and bonus--if you need candles, they have them reasonably priced here. Got 2 candles and 2 cupcakes for $5. Not a bad deal if you ask me!"

Love the cute yellow retro fridge located behind the cash register which I'm told contains employee lunches. I romanticized that the fridge contained something cooler in there, like an old fashioned jello mold waiting to set.  I'm going to imagine that the employee lunches consists of retro items, like deviled eggs.\n\nThe #1 selling cupcake at Retro Bakery is the Hopscotch. The vanilla buttercream frosting is dipped in butterscotch and all that yumminess sits atop a simple vanilla cupcake. \n\nThe texture of the hopscotch reminds me of a Dairy Queen dipped cone. It has that chewy toothsome bite reminiscent of a freshly dipped cone. The plain vanilla cupcake is subtly moist. The vanilla buttercream frosting on it's own, has a bit of a grainy sugar crystal texture, but strangely, it's still not too sweet."

They really do care for their clientele and show the personal customer service everyone looks for in a locally owned business. I've tried an array of flavors and my favorite is the hopscotch.

Retro had good reviews, so I called them and placed my order, which involved a two tier wedding cake and a vegan cupcake. I spoke a couple times on the phone, as well as emailed with the staff to confirm my order.\n\nThe good: The cake tasted phenomenal. Despite being stuffed after the meal, everyone wanted to eat the cake. It was moist, and the flavours were intense and authentic. The buttercream was also delicious! It tasted like it was made with authentic ingredients, not chemicals. \n\nThe bad: Getting the cake delivered was a bit of a hassle, as the drivers kept calling with changes in plans. On your wedding day, this can be a bit hectic.\n\nThe ugly: They got the colour of my order wrong. Seriously wrong. I had asked for a white cake with Tiffany blue accents. The cake arrived and was entirely deep, bright, teal. Children's birthday cake teal. It would have been less bad if just the piping on the cake was that colour, but it was the entire cake! It looked like it belonged at a five-year-old's party. I laughed it off, but I'm not sure how this happened. Even if they thought the entire cake was supposed to be blue, I triple-checked with the person taking the order that they knew what I meant by \"Tiffany Blue\".  They did not.\n\nBottom line: It was incredibly good cake, and that's what mattered most to me. However, you are paying for the work that goes into decorating, and it would be good if they had gotten it right. Had the colour been right, I would have given them five stars, it was so delicious. It was also nicely decorated, despite being the wrong colour."

I'd never been, but remembered having a Maple Bacon (one of my faves) cupcake from a friend and loving it, and after reading all the reviews, went with Retro (despite how f'in far it is from South Summerlin).\n\nBrian is great to work with!  Exchanged a few emails with him and printed out some photos and schlepped over (as well as had a dozen cupcakes set aside to taste - they don't do cake tastings).  Handed my photos/details over, picked up my cupcakes (which he dropped to $20/dozen since I was buying a cake - how sweet), oogled at the ones I didn't get for a bit, and kid sis and I began our \"tasting\" in the car, lol.  It's a cute bakery with a clean, neat, and adorable store front.  They should sell milk (or you could walk over to the 7/11)!  \n\nI recommend trying to get there early, bc I'm guessing they kept the cupcakes in the walk-in.. they were chilled and VERY different from a cupcake right from the case (they're still yummy, but were obviously cold, buttercream was stiff, and even thawed, a fresh one out of the case is a million times better)\n\nHere's what I tried on my first visit:\n\nPucker up - one of my faves, great looking cupcake, moist, soft cake, tart buttercream, reminded me of a muffin.\nChoc. fountain - yummm.\nVanilla/vanilla - moist cake, not too sweet buttercream.\nChoc/vanilla - one of my faves.\nPink lemonade - not my fave.  :( the buttercream is too tart, kind of bitter and gritty.  I really wanted to like this, and I hate that I hate it!\nHop scotch - bc I had this chilled, it wasn't such a great experience the first time, but it was really yummy thawed.\nSmores - idk, this was at the bottom for both of us.  Nice moist cake, but the marshmallow buttercream was kind of off, I can't really describe it.\nRed carpet - moist, tasty cake, almond buttercream was kind of surprising and a little overwhelming (but I don't like almond flavoring.. if you like marzipan, you'll like the buttercream on this)\nSalted caramel - I liked this!  I was expecting it to be saltier, but it was still good, I loved the pretzel on top.\nCookies & cream - This was good, I liked this better than the choc. fountain and salted caramel.\nPB cup - I can't be fair, I'm not a big fan of PB so it was just okay. (I actually was supposed to have an Apple Cider set aside, minor mix up.)\nMaple bacon - one of my faves, could use more bacon,  but it's perfect the way it is.\n\nI exchanged a few (dozen) more emails with Brian and about a week before my event, stopped in to pay for my cake (they take half off your card about a week before the cake delivery) because I was on that side of town, and copped a few cupcakes for the ride home, lol.\n\nMilk & cookies - one of my faves, one of the best choc. chip cookies I've ever had.\nApple cider - my fave!  I love breakfast pastries, and this is very muffin-like.\n\nMy event was on a Sunday, so since they're not open on Sundays, I had the cake delivered to me.  It came the night before and it was packed super snug and dummy-proof (with short instructions taped to the box), as I was uber paranoid with having to bring this to the venue myself.  It was perfect!!  SUCH a hit!  It definitely looked better in person, but I'll post photos.  It was a two tier (feeds 45 - dessert slices) 8\"/10\" round cake, covered in fondant.  I chose red carpet (as per request by mother dearest) for the larger tier and chocolate covered strawberry (YUM, could possibly knock apple cider off my #1) for the small tier.  It was a white cake, so both tiers made such great looking slices, white fondant with dark, dramatic cake.  I almost chose pucker up as the top tier, and I almost wish I did.\n\nAll Retro's cakes are moist and I think I read somewhere that their standard choc cake is vegan.  Buttercream is tasty and piped high in a cute swirl!\n\nRetro has a great staff and delicious cupcakes!  I wish they were closer to me!!!\n\nxxR"

Goddamn, this was so so good... It's like the butterscotch glaze kept the moisture in... I will eat you again.\nTOASTED COCONUT - Toasted coconut cake topped with vanilla bean buttercream, toasted coconut, and sweetened condensed milk. This is the motherfucking most legit coconut cupcake I've ever had... and super moist to boot. Unfortunately it's seasonal. \nVANILLA WITH VANILLA/ORANGE TANG buttercream frosting. - Meh... I could barely taste the tang. \n\nOverall, I'm a very happy camper.

Don't even try to argue with me on this!\n\nI live in Spring Valley and they are located in the North West (practically to Mount Charleston), but they are worth the drive! Believe me. I am an avid Cupcake Enthusiast. \n\nI went in with a girlfriend yesterday, we order 5 cupcakes, sometimes I wish all places had pu pu platters (I want to taste is ALL). They were out of the Salted Caramel Crunch (which is what I was told to try) and Kari, said she'd make a few of them up for us, we didn't even have to ask!!! How awesome is that?\n\nThe cakes on each of the 5 we got were fluffy and moist. They weren't airy or dry or crusty and each one of them was pretty dense and heavy. I don't know the secret to her frosting, but every different type I got to indulge in was epically awesome. Not too sweet, not too oily, not too bland. They were PERFECT.\n\nThe bakery was nice and clean. It had a 1950s refrigerator that added ambiance and tied in to the whole \"retro\" concept. Retro is tucked away in a shopping center, there is limited seating, I think I saw one love seat. I wish they had hot coffee, a few tables, and this place would be complete.\n\nThis is place really knocked my socks off! The cupcakes were fresh, there was an wide range assortment of varieties and flavor profiles. The staff was friendly, informative, and helpful. \n\nI wish I lived closer, but at the same time I am thankful I don't. I can only imagine the calorie count, but when cupcakes are made like this (PERFECTION, HEAVEN, JOYGASM IN MY MOUTH) it's hard to not rationalize the calorie intake!\n\nWell done, Retro Bakery, well done.

I also ordered the chocolate chip cookie because when a bakery offers one I have to try it. \n\nThe overall consensus on all the cupcakes was that they were sickeningly sweet. The glazed donut cake part was very bland and the glaze on top tasted like nothing. The strawberry buttercream frosting was just overly sweet. It has potential because they do use fresh strawberries but it does not need all the excess sugar. The chocolate chip cookie wasn't bad it was just super average.\n\nAll these high reviewers must like the overly sweet baked goods that Retro Bakery serves."

It's a buttercream, which is great, but I found it a little dry and not moist and smooth.  \n\nI bit into the toffee break and you can really taste the richness of the chocolate cake.  Good stuff, I like how it's dense and moist.  The pieces of toffee blend well as far as textures.  Another one I had was the mint chocolate chip.  The mint flavor in the frosting is bold and you can really taste it.  Personally, I didn't like it too much.  The next one I tasted was the cinnamon toast.  The frosting in this was was way BOLD, you can really taste the cinnamon flavor and I think it was a little overpowering and you couldn't taste the cake at all.  My second bite, I had to take the frosting in half.\n\nHaven't got to taste the rest of the variety pack yet, but I'll probably expect similar results.  Anyway, decent gourmet cupcake place, there are other ones in the DC area which are better.  At $2.50/each, I have to say this is a good price compared to what I've paid for these little bad boys elsewhere."

It was a special order owl cake design with white cake and chocolate filling. The party was a huge hit and people were so impressed by the cake. I heard several people mention that it was the best they've had in Vegas. Great job! I highly recommend! \n\nThe best part? The team working in the store.

They did have a variety of fun flavors and names to match.\n\nI was also lucky enough to see them in action at my friends wedding.  The \"cake\" was  all cupcakes from Retro with a variety of flavors.  The theme was Las Vegas so cupcakes were decorated accordingly (decks of cards, Las Vegas sign, etc)  all stacked up in a tier.

We got a half dozen: coffee and donut, chocolate Fountain, cookies and cream, butterscotch, birthday cake, and another I can't remember.  They were just ok. Some the cake was really dry and dense, others just didn't have much flavor at all. I also asked about a very basic cake to be made, literally a circle cake with  a simple design on the side. They said they needed 14 days. 14 days! That's way too long. Every other bakery is generally one week, unless it's a huge custom order. I took my order to Albertsons. We usually go to Drago Sisters Bakery in the SW but thats tok far for this party. Basic cupcakes, basic cakes. We won't be returning."

Pics and stuff included on http://joijam.tumblr.com/page/2 if you wanna see em :-)\n\n\"In Vegas we went to this bakery called Retro Bakery. It was better than The Cupcakery (in my opinion). Don't get me wrong, The Cupcakery was good too, but I went to Retro Bakery more than once (shame on me!). There was so much to try and (one of) the owners, Brian, was super nice. I didn't meet his wife, the other owner though. The gals behind the counter were sweet as pie and they remembered us when we went back. I fell in love with the sugar cookies. They were so good, I didn't even want any more cupcakes! Now that's something! My only complaint is that the cookies had frosting on them. I scraped it off because they're so tasty the frosting isn't even necessary (again, my opinion). They looked like their cookie pictured above with the Johnny Cupcakes logo, minus the logo and with colored sugar. Honestly, my own cookies didn't survive long enough to have a photo op so I had to use that cookie from their Flickr. See more of their work here. I won't say how many trips we made, but I will be going back next time I'm in Vegas.\"\n\nUpdate: Went back to Vegas and the owner is still super cool, the treats are still deelish, and they are still better than The Cupcakery! This will continue to be my favorite cupcake spot in Vegas. Long live Retro!"

Unfortunately, when it comes to wedding cakes that are such a large part of the photographs, the visual presentation is just as important as the taste.\n\nWe requested a specific cake from Brian, which we had found a photo of on Retro's custom cake website. We sent Brian a link to the specific cake we wanted, which should have allievated any confusion.  However, after we placed the order, we found out the quote we were given was for butter cream (which has an entirely different look than we requested)\ninstead of the fondant that was pictured in the photo we sent. It was also a significant price increase over the butter cream, but because we live out of state, it was too late to research and find another bakery.\n\nBrian told us the flower decorations on the cake we requested were no longer available, but that he would be able to make them himself, and that they would be even better. The flowers we ended up with on our cake were not at all what we had requested, and were blue instead of the teal we had asked for (we even sent a photo of one of Retro's previous cakes that was the exact color that we wanted). Our cake ended up looking like it belonged in someone else's child's birthday party, instead of our wedding. Wrong look, wrong flowers, wrong color, and several of the flowers had broken and fallen off of the cake (although this could have been the fault of our reception venue as well?).\n\nAlthough we loved the flavors of the cake, we would definitely not recommend them for creating a *wedding* cake.  We do not think it is an unreasonable expectation for a bakery to recreate a style of cake and a color scheme based on cakes that they list in their cake gallery.  If they were unable to do so, they should have let us know so that we could have planned differently."

And well worth the insane drive to the northern-most edge of town. The chocolate loves vanilla (chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream) is still my fav, but close seconds include the cookies and cream (chocolate cake with Oreo buttercream) and the pucker up (raspberry cake- real raspberries not dye- with lemon buttercream). They also do a good mint chocolate chip, peanut butter, pink lemonade, and my new favorite grammy's grapefruit- vanilla cake with grapefruit zest and grapefruit buttercream that is only available for August, sadly. I also like their twist on the red velvet- with an almond buttercream rather than the usual cream cheese frosting. My husband, who is not near as dessert crazed as I am, will drive 40 minutes across town for the Oreo cupcake. You can reserve your favorites ahead of time so they do not run out, and they have even made the cookies and cream cupcake fresh for him when they've run out.  He also loves their apple cider, milk and cookies (topped with a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie), and coffee and donuts (with coffee buttercream). Retro is a cut above any of the other cupcake bakeries in town- definitely worth the drive. Rich, dense, flavorful cake with some of the best buttercream I've tasted.\n\nIt should also be noted that they do adorable special occasion cakes.  They come in all the cupcake flavors and are 4 layers high, however they are far too heavy on the frosting inside (i'd be sure to request minimal frosting next time- it was insanely sweet and overpowering).  Very cute cakes and super reasonable (6\" cake for $20, see attached pic)."

I wasn't asking for vegan just no milk or butter, which hasn't been an issue in the past.. \n\nWell, no one's fault but my own that I waited for the day of to find all of this out. I called Retro bakery and unfortunately, no cakes were premade as I was hoping and praying with all my might! it does take time and I understand. However, I emailed their office on the  off chance they could help and  was able to get correspondence back that they could wing it for me with cupcakes; they saved the day! My boyfriend thought they were too much for one dozen, but I need my fix and I don't have any other options. It's tough being lactose intolerant (I'm also pregnant - don't keep a pregnant lady from food). \n\nHe has since changed his tune, because we bought two different cupcakes one from Albertson's for everyone and one from Retro for me.

There was a lot of frosting, but I think they revamped it from the last time I ordered from here, and the frosting is less sweet. They were decorated simply and beautifully.. The inside was neat and tidy, and they have a nice, organized display!\n\nThey also have an email system to find out their flavors of the week/month, and their brand new flavors. Sometimes they have specials! \n\nCONS: It was hard to find the place!\n\nLet me just restate this sentence again: Best cupcakes in Vegas, hands down!"

It looked like a Tiffanys gift box, bow and all!  It was cherry cheesecake flavored & was absolutely delicious!!  We had read reviews from various bakeries & Retro Bakery seemed like the one to choose...and it was THE BEST!!  They delivered the cake on time & even called a few minutes before to let us know they were on their way.  Retro bakery will be the only bakery we order from when we are in our favorite city...Las Vegas!"

I was looking at pictures of cupcakes on there (doesn't everybody?) and came across one of Retro's cupcakes. The cupcakes and the unique flavors seemed so enticing! \n\nWe decided to go on a Saturday afternoon, and the girl who was behind the counter was friendly and helpful. The bakery is small but cute.\n\nWe tried:\n\nThe Hop Scotch: This is a vanilla cupcake, which was moist but dense, with a huge mound of vanilla buttercream, dipped in butterscotch ganache. I really love butterscotch, but this was almost too sweet for me to eat, so I shared it with my daughter. \n\nMaple Bacon: I love bacon and I love maple bars, so I knew I wanted to try this. Again, it's a vanilla cupcake with bacon and maple inside with maple buttercream. This one disappointed me. Had it not been for the name, I would have ever known there was maple or bacon in there.\n\nCoffee and Donuts: The donut glazed, vanilla cupcake with coffee buttecream was on point! This one actually surprised me, because I am not a big coffee-flavor person, but this cupcake definitely worked.\n\nMilk & Cookies: A chocolate chip cupcake with vanilla buttercream with a yummy chocolate chip cookie on top??? Two-desserts-in-one! Need I say more? This one was another favorite, especially with the kids. \n\nWe also got the Chocolate Covered Bananas and the Peanut Butter Cup, but I didn't end up tasting those (not much of a fan of chocolate or peanut butter). My kids ate them and liked them.\n\nMega Chip Cookie: This was one of the yummiest cookies I've had in a long time. It was moist and was chock-full of all different types of chips (cookie chips, not potato, lol).\n\nSo, the cupcakes were decent but they didn't really \"wow\" me like I had hoped for. But I will give them another try and try out some different flavors."

The cake was moist and fluffy. The sweetness from the maple buttercream paired nicely with the crispy saltiness from the bacon. It was a real treat! My husband loved his glazed donut cupcake and my daughter devoured the strawberry banana. I've always had a bad impression of buttercream frosting since my only experience has been with the grocery store variety. Retro Bakery's buttercream is amazing! It doesn't just taste like powdered sugar cement! I was a little dissappointed that I couldn't try the hopscotch this time but there's always another visit in store. We will be returning quite frequently I think."

She usually goes on about bakeries from New York and how she misses them until she stumbled onto Retro Bakery & sure enough I'm hooked too. Their butter cream is amazing and totally jacks your taste buds in a good way. If you give Retro Bakery a shot the taste will make you think you're in Wonka's Factory: The Milk & Cookies taste like Milk & Cookies, The Apple Cider tastes like Apple Cider, etc. etc. : )\n\nNot to mention every time I've gone to pick up my order they have on full display freshly made assorted cup cakes. To further entice you they have huge amazing cookies for what I believe was only one dollar but I would pay more because they're amazing(always a nice surprise as to what they'll put out). Unfortunately it's clear across town from me though it's well worth the drive. Hopefully they open another location here in Vegas ; )\n\nGreat for Birthdays, Work/Office potlucks, Random acts of kindness, etc. You will not be disappointed and don't say you don't like sweets because I don't like sweets but I LOVE all of Retro's treats I've had to date."

Everybody was so friendly, asked if we had any questions.  Their case of cupcakes was so drool-worthy, it took me a few minutes to just get my head on straight and make some selections.  Retro ended up being one of my favorite stops on our tour! \n\nI decided on the Lemon Raspberry and the Maple Bacon.  I ate the MB cupcake immediately, right there in the car.  Oooooooh.  That's some good stuff.  A great blend of sweet and savory.  I enjoyed the LR cupcake that night, but wasn't wowed.  I liked the frosting, but it was almost too sweet (words that almost never come out of my mouth).  I was expecting more of a raspberry flavor in the cake too.  I probably wouldn't order that one again, but I will say both cakes were perfectly moist, yet strong enough to hold up the frosting without crumbling in my hand.   Definitely some quality stuff!  I was lucky enough to steal the Red Carpet cupcake from my friend, and that was probably the best red velvet cupcake I've ever had.  It's topped with a buttercream that has a slight almond flavor, which makes it fantastic. \n\nI had a great conversation with one of the gals there, who also used to live in Portland.  Great vibe, fab cupcakes!  Check them out if you haven't already."

It was such a great bakery that I've made my first yelp review because I think others would also love it.\nI live in the bay area and needed a cake for my mom in Vegas.  I've ordered from three different bakeries in past years, and we've always been disappointed, embarrassingly so.  These are high end bakeries where my orders run close to $100, so the disappointment was even more pointed. However, Retro bakery literally knocked the ball out of the park. I ordered over email and indicated the cake and cupcakes I wanted. I was able to have a traditional white cake with buttercream frosting and a dozen cupcakes delivered to my mom's house for about $60.  The cake was fantastic. We froze half of it and it was just as wonderful thawed out.  The cupcakes though were also wonderful (even after freezing!).  The frosting is a rich, luscious buttercream.  Not an airy, light buttercream.  And, on the cupcakes we had this fantastic butterscotch coating on top of the buttercream. The cupcakes and the cake were very moist. I will be ordering from them again next year."

            "review": "Delicious mini-cupcakes. We got 10 different flavors and had way too many for our ~35 people, but you can get two flavors per dozen so you could get a smaller number and still have a lot of variety. My favorites were the Pink Lemonade (lemon cake with pink lemonade buttercream) and the Pucker Up (raspberry cake with lemon buttercream); my husband loved the Brownie Sundae (basically a brownie in cupcake form); guests also particularly liked the Blueberry Pancake (blueberry cake with maple buttercream), the Peanut Butter Cup (chocolate cake with peanut butter buttercream), and the Vanilla Loves Chocolate (vanilla cake with chocolate buttercream). Don't worry--it was pretty much all delicious.\n\nThey delivered to our hotel before the wedding, a couple of hours before we had to head out to Valley of Fire, well-wrapped so the cake would stay fresh for our 9pm reception; the delivery fee anywhere on the Strip is $20, which is not bad at all.\n\nAlso, they include sales tax in their prices! This is a big deal; the sales tax in Clark County is 8.1%, but it's folded into their prices, which at $12/dozen mini-cupcakes are already very good.\n\nBasically, if I had to do it again, I would just get 2/person, even with a large variety--we thought so many choices would encourage people to pig out, but we had a TON of leftovers with about 4/person. My husband and I were eating them for a couple of days after. The ones that kept the best were probably the Pucker Up and Blueberry Pancake ones, I think because they actually had some fruit in the batter to moisten them a little more. The Brownie Sundae ones probably went stale the fastest, but they make no pretense about these having a long shelf life. As they point out on their website, who would let them sit around in anything but extraordinary wedding leftover circumstances? I've heard freezing cake doesn't yield very good results, but I'm already hoping we can make a 1-year anniversary trip to Vegas next year and stop by the Retro Bakery for celebratory cupcakes!\n\nOne other thing: They rent/sell cupcake towers, and will also do 6\" cakes to top them if you want more of a traditional cake for cutting--we just didn't really want to bother with that. We brought in our own cardboard cupcake towers from Target, but it turned out we could have bought styrofoam ones for about the same price ($15 apiece) from Retro Bakery directly."

In the meantime, we'll continue to make the trek out to Southern UTAH, because our kids love your cupcakes. (of course we do too!)  Their cupcakes are the real deal and we don't mind driving 40 minutes out and paying $2.65/ cupcake  because its worth every penny.\n\nThe one cupcake that caught my attention was the Maple Bacon cupcake. I love the combo-similar to pancakes and bacon. Small pcs of bacon in a vanilla cupcake with a maple buttercream. The buttercream isn't overly sweet, its just right. I also had a bite of the sprinkled donut and it was pretty good. And I may have a new favorite cupcake in the Pucker Up...a raspberry cake with lemon butter cream, good play on the sweet and tangy combo.  The kids love the chocolate fountain-who wouldn't ...chocolate cake, chocolate buttercream, dipped in chocolate ganache. That my friends is a hat trick. Their 2nd fave is the Cookies and Cream cupcake.\n\nThey don't just make cupcakes, they make mini cupcakes,  cookies, and cakes. While waiting my turn I flipped through their  cake book and they make some frickn cool cakes. They will also custom make your cupcakes and cake to your party theme.\n\nThey are doing something right especially when my kids are requesting Retro Bakery for dessert.

Assuming you, the reader, have never been here, just this little bit of info should get your insulin juices flowing. \n\nWhy three stars? Couple reasons. One is each individual cupcake is around $2.50. So for a dozen you gotta shell out around 30 bucks. If you were planning on having a decent size birthday party for your kid and cupcakes are the option, you can easily spend almost a hundred bucks for 36 of them. The other reason is that their location is kind of in the boonies. So you gotta actually PLAN a time to go there.\n\nOverall, I wanted to be fair so I think 3 is appropriate. Now if I just happen to check out another cupcake place, then these guys will be my measuring stick.

Super moist and just the right amount of sweetness.

I got peach! I was extremely disappointed but it was too late. I had to get to the party with my peach cake. The cupcakes were a hit with some of the guests. I prefer the cream cheese frosting myself. I gave them 3 stars because the cost compared to what I got was not worth it. Customer service was great, nice people."

I wasn't sure what to expect as I had never been to bakery nor tasted their cakes prior to ordering, but I'm so happy I trusted the positive reviews. They were so easy to work with, their prices are great, and most importantly the cake was beautiful and delicious. Guests are still raving about the cake! I absolutely love the Red Carpet flavor--better than traditional red velvet cake!"

The pucker up! Some we had to spit out because they were just to much!! \n\nWe did however get their peanut butter cookie and it was off the charts. If we ever go back it would be just for that cookie. It some how had smooth creamy peanut butter in it. It was awesome! \n\nWe would never buy cupcakes from there again."

Hands down, without a second thought, Retro Bakery's cupcakes are absolutely the best cupcakes I've ever had anywhere.  By now I've tried almost all their flavors and each one is just as good as the last.  Every day they a special flavor (Maple Bacon anyone?), while on Wednesdays and Saturdays they serve a flavor of the month offered, yes, for that month only.\n\nA little known secret: They also make cakes.  Check out their website for some of the amazing special order designs they've completed. Sometimes they also have cakes in the display for sale, and if you see one when you visit, grab one! You won't regret it, the chocolate cake that I tried rivaled any dessert in any top restaurant. Yes, it was that good.\n\nThe owners are very hands on and a treat. Nine times out of ten at least one of them will be there when you visit, which makes them stand out from other local cupcake spots as well.\n\nMake sure you visit Retro - it's not as far away as you think it is (I know, I thought the same my first trip). It's worth a drive from CA and AZ even."

Although I visit Vegas frequently, it's usually without a car, so it's hard to justify the $20 delivery charge, especially when it's just cupcakes for me.\n\nSo on this trip, I rented a car. Pretty much just to go to Retro, although it did help save taxi money to and from the airport. And boy, was it worth it. I went on a Saturday so I could get one of the megachip cookies I'd heard so much about, and I wasn't disappointed. Cupcake-wise, I finally settled on a Salted Caramel Crunch and a Pucker Up. The Salted Caramel Crunch was delicious - almost a little too rich - but the Pucker Up was to die for. It made an excellent breakfast, in fact. :)\n\nNext time, I'll be in Vegas with a group of friends. Hmmm, maybe we can split the delivery charge...."

Their prices seemed reasonable.  My wedding cake was un-traditional.  We were having dessert with our dinner, and giving cupcakes as favors.  But we also wanted a cake to cut.  I gave my mom all the information and she took care of the rest.  Since we all live in different states everything was handled through email and over the phone.  My mom said she was extremely pleased with the job Retro Bakery did on the cupcakes, and even more on our wedding cake!  My guests all have talked about how good the cupcakes were at our wedding, and how beautiful the wedding cake looked!  We didn't end up cutting it until we got home (we cut an extra cupcake instead).  The cake was so good!  It was perfectly balanced, not too sweet, the cake was moist, and delicious!  As was the cupcake we ate at the wedding.  The small cake we had was beautifully decorated with sugar flowers, the colors matched my decor perfectly.  \n\nTheir customer service was awesome!  They worked with my mom and did exactly what she asked for.  She says that she was very happy with how they handled our order especially considering that we are not local and did not set foot into the store until she picked up the cakes.  Any time I go to Vegas I will have to stop for a cupcake! I wish they would open a store here in Los Angeles!"

Oh and those oatmeal scotchie cookies! Oh oh oh. Oh!\n\nEven more kudos to Retro for not expanding to different locations and losing control over their product as other bakeries around town have done in the past few years.

For a place that boasts the motto \"All About the Buttercream\" I was expecting better. \n\nThe 'buttercream' hinted at a possibility of vegetable shortening and the overload of powdered sugar is EXTREMELY evident. This results in a very stiff 'buttercream' that is sickeningly sweet and dry.\n\nI tried the peanut butter and chocolate cupcake. The cake was a little tough and dry, possibly overmixed. The frosting had a slight hint of peanut butter, but did not give me that delicious peanuty flavor I was hoping for.\n\nMy sister ordered several cupcakes as well, and she too experienced the stiff and overly sweet fake buttercream. \n\n\nI REPEAT - For a place that boldly uses 'All About the Buttercream' In their title, should perhaps use actual butter and hold back on the powdered sugar."

I can only do an update so many times saying I'm here yet again and that Keri and Brian's place is awesome. \n\nAVAILABLE EVERYDAY\n\n*RED CARPET\n a classic done better! I love me some creamcheese frosting, but seriously, the almond sets it off right. \n*HOP SCOTCH\n another classic stepped up. Plain vanilla on vanilla is boring to me. Also, I was that kid who got the butterscotch magic shell and kept making shells until the ice cream melted. I loves me butterscotch topping. \n*APPLE CIDER\n It's kinda like a \"breakfast\" cupcake to me. It reminds me of having a apple struesel. \n*MILK& COOKIES \n I don't even like chocolate chip cookies much, but this was pretty good. It's good for people who like chcolate but can't do chocolate on chocolate.\n*COFFEE&DOUGHNUTS\n It's a bit sweet to me with the glaze, but it's good.\n*PEANUT BUTTER CUP \n I don't do chocolate often but I love the combo of it with peanut butter. Theirs isn't too sweet so it's not overwhelming, but it is rich. \n*PINK LEMONADE\n I do not like lemon cake so it's hard for me to judge this. I do appreciate this one though since it's not that fake lemon taste that made me dislike lemon desserts in the first place but it's too lemon for me\n* PUCKER UP\n I like this compared to the pink lemonade since the raspberry breaks the lemon. This was a lemon treat I can get into....in a small dosage, like biting my BFs cupcake. \n*MAPLE BACON\n I love bacon. I'm sorry Jews. It's not bacon-y that some people might think. It's more like having a maple flavor that has a slight salty element similar to salt water taffy.\n*DRUMSTICK\n If you don't like butterscotch- here's the chcolate version. The nuts are okay, but I probably would like this without....that defeats the purpose of a drumstick though.\n*COOKIES&CREAM \n Tis okay but nothing beats the actual cookie to me....or a shake. \n\nFLAVOR OF THE DAY\n\n*BROWNIE SUNDAE \n Good idea, but the one I had was the last one and it was a bit dry. I should maybe try another one. I left this one in my fridge so it might be different fresh.\n*BLUEBERRY PANCAKE\n it's another \"breakfast\" cupcake. Actually not too sweet, the berries were abundant in mine too! \n\n\nSEASONAL\n\n*SALTED CARAMEL CRUNCH\n This is probably one of my favorite cupcake flavors. Unfortunately, it's seasonal, but so glad it's been brought back again! I was sad the first time around. I like salty/sweet profiles and caramel. \nCHOCOLATE BANANA\nThis was okay. Good in concept, but I think I just don't like banana sweets aside from a banana cake and whole bananas. \n*SPICY PUMPKIN\nI thought it was a good cupcake. It had a lot moister, softer consistency than some of the other cupcakes and the cream was really creamy on this one. The thing is, it is more spice than sweet so I don't think it's for everyone. I know Elnino F. didn't like it as much as I did. The BF and I are fans of Dutch spice cake (Spekkoek) and it reminds me of that. \nCHOCOLATE ORANGE \n Pretty delish! Orange and chocolate is no fail. The cake was more airy than usual though.\nBLACKBIRD\nUnfortunately, it was spoiled. It had fresh blackberries in it, and it just went wonky within the few days.. I only had it in the fridge like a day though....bought Monday, tried to eat Weds. \n\nDISCONTINUED? SEASONAL? These I thought were on the Daily Flavors, but aren't anywhere to be seen now.\n\n*PB&J\n (Vanilla cake injected with strawberry jelly with peanut butter buttercream) Good, but I prefer the peanut butter cup....It's the jelly for me- me no likes.\n*CREAMSICKLE (orange cake with vanilla and orange swirl buttercream) The BF and I actually really liked this. Again orange cake isn't normally something I'm a fan of, but this was good.\n*TOFFEE BREAK (chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream and crushed Heath bars) decent\n\nAlso a little FYI that for VEGANS-\nyou can special request VEGAN versions of Chocolate Loves Vanilla Bean and also Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup with a vegan butter cream.\n\nCOOKIES\n\nBig cookies and they're $1 only. \n\nCINNAMON SUGAR- snickerdoodle on crack. It's sweeter than a usual snickerdoodle because it has cinnamon buttercream on it but it's noms. I always get these.\nCHOCOLATE CHIP- pretty good. Definitely one of the better ones I've had.\nULTIMATE CHIP (cookie with chocolate chip, white chocolate, peanut butter and butterscotch chips) I like this a lot but I see it's not for everyone. If you're more into the cookie and less chips, this is practically all chips. It's like eating a chocolate bar, with cookie dough holding it together. This is made on Saturdays only I believe. \n\nIt'll be continued so long as there's a Retro Bakery!"

I've seen the reviews, but since it's a drive from where I live, I never went here.  That will change.\n\nI bought a box of four, and it was difficult picking the flavors I wanted because they all looked so good.  I ended up with; 1) red carpet with an almond butter cream frosting on a red velvet like cake; 2) Coffee and doughnut with a frosting of sugar doughnut-like frosting and a dollop of coffee flavored frosting; 3) Cookies and cream; and 4) Chocolate fountain with chocolate cake and chocolate buttercream frosting and dipped in chocolate ganache.\n\nWe tried the Coffee and doughnut and the Chocolate fountain yesterday and will polish off the other two tonight.

Curse you, proximity!\nOn my first trip to Las Vegas with my boy for his birthday, I decided that treating him to these amazing creations (thank you Yelp!) would be appropriate, since I wouldn't be able to bake him any birthday cake. Everyone raved about them here... so either they were really THAT good or they had crack in them. I'm now thinking, maybe both.\nI got a dozen... I know for a fact I decided on the CMT, the Apple Cider, the Milk & Cookies, the Red Carpet, the Maple Bacon, the Glazed Donut, and TWO of the Hopscotch- the remaining cupcake flavors escape me... because I went into a sugar coma after inhaling most of them (go figure- I got them for my boyfriend and I end up mowing them down... he loves his little heffer). The Hopscotch is so f'ing good! But obviously the one that stole my heart was the Cinnamon Toast. My favorite cereal in cake form??? DONE. Because if you know only two things about me... my perfect foodie world revolves around Cinnamon Toast Crunch and CAKE (or cake-like pastries).\nI'm going back to LV in two months. I have been working out like crazy to be in full-on hotness mode (pool season and whatnot). Retro is going to be the thing to demolish months of salads and protein shakes. And I can't wait for it. :)"

Usually because it has a ton of fondant which no doubt makes for a beautiful cake yet bitter frosting. Retro made our wedding cake and it was by far the best cake I have ever had aside from my own homemade cheesecake. Then again I am partial to cheesecake and cheesecake that comes out of my oven. Our cake was adorable and delicious a combination that is hard to come by regarding wedding cakes. We had a lemon cake with a cream cheese raspberry buttercream frosting. So incredibly moist and scrumptious."

I am soooo glad I decided to drop in and sample their delicious, creative creations.  The customer service was superb, and the to-go box preserved the beauty of the cupcake perfectly. \n\nAs a SoCal girl who was living in LA when the LA cupcake boom emerged, I have tried the famous Sprinkles, Crumbs, SusieCakes, Yummy Cupcakes- and I am proud to say that I have found a NEW favorite in Retro Bakery.  I am glad I only live 15 minutes away. \n\nTheir flavors and frosting combinations are so unique. Maple Bacon, Salted Caramel Crunch, Drumstick, and Snazzleberry, to name a few.  More importantly, the cake itself is moist and delicious.  And MOST importantly, it doesn't break the bank at only $2.65/cupcake.  And they offer these cupcake flavors in cake sizes too!  I will definitely be ordering my cakes from there, from here on out.\n\nThey also offer Vegan cupcakes,with 24 hours notice."

So yes, I provide free advertisement every 8 weeks to a dozen of new hires at my job. I'm part of their cupcake club, it's  a joke. Supposedly every $60 you spend you get a credit. However, the past 3 times I have went they always say I wont be eligible for the credit until my next visit, mind you I have bought over a dozen every 8 weeks for almost the past year. My husband picked up the cupcakes this past Friday and was told the same thing,   I wouldnt be eligible for the credit until next visit. Honestly for me it boils down to PRINCIPLE  now. I have made purchases every 8 weeks and providing free advertisement.  No more, in my opiniom that is just bad business.  Going forward  I will use The Cupcakery. I believe and expect good customer service. The cupcakes are ok, there are only 2 flavors I eat but they are close to my house and convenient which is the reason why I chose them."

And, I specifically wanted toget their \"Milk & Cookies\" flavor, but they had sold out of it. I had to place an order & go back to pick up the next day. This was my own fault, and I tried to look on the bright side...like they were out of it because it was so good. LOL\n\nI ended up spending about $21 on 8 cupcakes.\n\n3 \"Milk & Cookies\"\n1 \"Iced Tea\"\n1 \"Hopscotch\"\n1 \"Chocolate Loves Vanilla\"\n1 \"Vanilla Loves Chocolate\"\n1 \"Peanut Butter Cup\"\n\nThe cake wasn't spectacular, but it was WAY better than Cupcakery, and the frosting was excellent. We really enjoyed all the flavors we tried.\n\nThe Cheery Cheesecake and Blueberry Pancake flavors are to die for. Honestly, I don't think they have a flavor that's bad.\n\nThese are THE BEST cupcakes in Vegas and any of there flavors can be ordered as full size cakes.\n\nCheck them out!!"

I have tried many of the \"fancy gourmet style\" cupcake joints around Vegas. Retro Bakery is in my top 2 favorites for sure. The fact that the boss lady interacts with her customers via social media as well as in person is a major plus. It is nice to actually see the owner working with her employees. My 2 personal favorites are the Hop Scotch which is some sort of butterscotch/buttercream cupcake. The other I believe is called milk and cookies. It is a chocolate chip cupcake topped with buttercream and a mini choc chip cookie. I am pretty sure their motto here is \"It's all about the buttercream!\" I also notice they are big supporters of other local companies, small business, food trucks, etc. On this trip I tried the regular chocolate chip cookie and I don't think I will ever return without adding a cookie to my cupcake order. The only downfall about this place is, its location. I am sure the northwest area appreciates it, but I would spend way more money if it was a central area."

Not five minutes later, she called and informed me the baker said they don't do custom cupcake orders.  I mentioned I have been doing this for years and she said the baker does everything in bulk and won't be able to mix 'n match the flavors.  I was terribly disappointed and upset.  On their website, it states \"Custom order cupcakes start at $3 each / $36 dozen.\"  I would have paid the extra money but that was not given as an option.  I hope I sounded polite when I canceled the order, it wasn't her fault.  \nI will not be coming back.  \n\nClearly, customer satisfaction is not on top of their list.  To me, if I can't customize a cupcake, then I'm better off getting cupcakes from a grocery store.  I am greatly disappointed because this is the first cupcake place I actually liked."

My husband and I got married in Las Vegas in March 2015 and Retro was highly recommended to us by our reception venue -- and I will gladly pay that recommendation forward to anyone looking for a cake in Vegas for a wedding or any occasion. We got a two-tiered butterscotch cake with multi-colored sprinkles and white fondant ribbons, a style pictured on their website. It was the most delicious cake ever, OMG. Ordering was a breeze through phone. Super friendly people. Easy coordination with our reception restaurant. Yum. Go order, you will not regret!!"

            "review": "SHAZAM!!!  \n\nAlso:   Best. Cupcakes. Ever.    \n\nIn celebration of my husbands 41st birthday last weekend, I asked my mother-in-law, who currently hails from Vegas, to transport 48 cupcakes from Las Vegas to Joshua Tree, across the Mojave Preserve.  She was road tripping with her girlfriend Pat a la  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, except that instead of the ether and the bats, there were cupcakes.  Lots and lots of cupcakes.  \n\nWhen pressed to answer the question \"what kind of cake do you want for your birthday this year), my husband suggested this bakery, which he called \"the best bakery in Las Vegas.\"  How he knew about it, I still have no idea, considering his lack of a sweet tooth, but I'm eternally grateful to him for making the recommendation.  After perusing their website and poring over the photographs on their flickr page, I was hooked.    I called the bakery and ordered one dozen each of the following flavors:\n\nChocolate loves vanilla (Chocolate cake topped with vanilla buttercream)\n\nApple cider (Cinnamon swirl cake topped with apple cider buttercream and dusted with cinnamon and sugar)\n\nHop Scotch (Vanilla cake topped with vanilla buttercream dipped in butterscotch ganache, their #1 selling cupcake)\n\nPucker Up (Raspberry cake topped with lemon buttercream; Winner of the Las Vegas Weekly 2010 Vegas' Best Offbeat Dessert) \n\nI also picked a desert-themed cupcake design that I found on the bakery's flickr page:\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/retrobakery/5053618397/\n\nAdding the design to each cupcake upped the price considerably, but it was worth every penny.  They warn't cheap, but they shore were purdy.  I was happy to discover that the emblems themselves were also delicious and didn't detract from the individual cupcake flavors in any way.\n\nOverall, I loved every one of the flavors we picked.  The chocolate loves vanilla was the most surprising of the quartet because they managed to make something VA VA VOOM out of something tried-and-true, and artfully so.  During the party, I tried an Apple cider cupcake, which I thought was a little too sweet to finish. The next morning, however, I had absolutely no trouble eating any of the other cucpakes, one right after the other, so the Apple Cider Incident could have just been a fluke moment of non-hunger.  Overall, my favorite flavor was the Pucker Up - holy man of moses, the tart and tangy flavor of the lemon buttercream was so perfect to cut the sweetness of the buttercream and the exactly right flavor to complement the raspberry muffin part.  \n\nNow, my little group of friends may choose to live in bumfuck, California, but they hail from all over the globe and have done their share of time in major cities.  What I'm trying to say is that we have eaten some freaking cupcakes in our lifetimes.  These were NOT our first cupcakes, if you know what I mean.  Been there, cupcake.  \n\nI think you get my point.\n\nAt an opportune moment last Saturday, I was finally able to grab my husband's elbow and make him stand still long enough to blow on some candles and pick a flavor.  Most everyone followed suit.  What happened next was remarkable.  The fine lines around people's eyes began to fall away.  Several people began to giggle.  A few people stared furiously at their paper plate, chewing vigorously, trying simultaneously to savor the moment and also make room for the next one.  In ten minutes or less, ten people were skulking around the table, eyeing the choices, selecting their next victim.  Others were surreptitiously looking for tupperware, tinfoil, a cloth grocery bag, anything remotely cupcake sized into which they might fit one for the road.  The \"mmmmmmmm\" sound was punctuated by people saying things like \"OH my GOD\" and/or \"where did these COME FROM?  TELL ME!\"   Several people snagged business cards, others started brainstorming and scheming about who they might know in Las Vegas and what they would be willing to do in exchange for some cupcakes.    In fact, since the Great Cupcake Unveiling, tourism to Las Vegas from Joshua Tree has increased by 150%.  I'm already planning on asking my mother in law, who is coming back out here in a few weeks, to bring us another two dozen.  \n\nWhen you live in a town full of shitty grocery-store-brand cakes and no mom-and-pop bakeries, finding just the right cupcake for a 41-year-old man's birthday party can be challenging.    Lucky for us, there's Retro Bakery, purveyor of fine party cupcakes and cakes for any occasion."

The cake came out ridiculously awesome.\n\nThe only thing I can be upset about is I wanted a specific item on the cake that required a small ice-paper scan. I guess their machine was broken. They didn't call to inform me of this. When I picked it up, they offered a refund for the missing small piece but didn't know how to work the computer system to give the actual refund.

Locally owned & operated by Kari and Brian Haskell for the past six years and turning out no less than a dozen varieties of cupcakes daily with fresh-bakes ongoing as dictated by need it was to smiling service and a mostly full selection that we arrived and choosing a wide variety each frosted gem was carefully packed into individually slotted boxes; the total tab under $50 even after putting a few bucks in the tip jar.  Having heard that the birthday cakes were a resounding success and ensuring freshness by securing my picks airtight in the refrigerator overnight it was with half-cakes after a long morning run that my Saturday began and working from lightest to most dense each option shined, both donut varieties harkening the flavor of a good cake-style ring with light glaze while the signature Hop Scotch presented the same supple vanilla base beneath rich butterscotch brimming with caramelized notes of brown sugar.  Moving next to bases with more heft, the Apple Cider was selected largely because the young lady at the counter described it as a \"sort of coffee cake\" and true to form, the dense crumb was rich with apples and cinnamon akin to the flavor of an apple fritter and duly appointed with sharply spiced butter cream, a truly unique option that would have been my favorite of the six had the last two not been equally excellent - a rich take on the red velvet replacing traditional cream cheese frosting with rich frangipane tinged buttercream and the \"Friday Only\" Brownie Sundae, more cupcake than brownie and rousing fond memories of my childhood when a warm pan of brownies frequently served as a indispensable wintertime dessert.  Dollar for dollar this could quite possibly be the best cupcake shop I've found to date."

Retro Bakery came up and it had wonderful reviews and it's not too far from our place. I went on a Friday and was greeted by a very accommodating lady. I only had one flavor that I knew I wanted to try so I asked her what she would recommend and she was very helpful. She recommended their Flavor for the Day which was Brownie Sundae, and she said Apple Cider is her favorite and the Maple Bacon cupcake is also a best-seller. I took her advice and bought those four flavors. My absolute favorites are the Apple Cider and Red Carpet, but all of them are delicious! I love the buttercream on top! It just adds more flavor to every bite of the cupcake. :) \n\n5 stars for the cupcakes' appearance and taste! 5 stars for the friendly attendant as well! :)"

They are like crack and haunt me in my sleep.  We tried the vanilla cream cheese (I think) and the chocolate with peanut butter.  I ate like four of the vanilla... crack cupcakes I tell you!  I tried the chocolate, and it was good, the vanilla just put it to shame.  \n\nI seriously dream of the awesomeness of these cupcakes.  My friend said they were great to deal with in ordering.  Im really hoping they do mail orders.  Can you even ship cupcakes to California?  I hope so!

            "review": "Wow.  That's the best way to describe it.  Wow.\n\nThanks to Jade W., I decided to take a trip two minutes away from my house to this small bakery on Durango.  I was excited because the reviews rave great cupcakes, and as my fans and readers know, I've only found one place in Vegas (Mad Hatter) that makes cupcakes well.  Now I have two on my fave list, and this beats Mad Hatter for me.\n\nRetro Bakery is totally awesome sporting cupcakes and cakes to order.  They have a multitude of flavors and some special ones time and again.  They are adorable!  Their shop is in this tiny corner shopping center next to Walgreens on Durango right between a nail salon and an eatery.  When you walk in you're greeted by sweet women behind the counter, clean cream colored walls, and this awesome yellow retro fridge holding their drinks behind the register.  Their small glass case displays their cupcakes, and when I went there were 18 kinds to choose from.\n\nI didn't want to miss out on any great flavors, and I wanted to drop a half dozen to my husband's work, so I grabbed all 18 to go.  I'm so glad that I did.  First off, their cupcakes are visually pleasing.  They are all about their frosting--a nice, old fashioned buttercream that's flavored according to the cupcakes that it tops.  Ranging from original  vanilla with regular buttercream to this crazy hop scotch cupcake that looks like a dipped butterscotch ice cream cone (the topping does, anyway), they have maple bacon cupcakes and more!  \n\nI took a picture of one of the boxes of cupcakes that I have with me right now.  I literally opened it while driving because I couldn't wait to try one, and I reached for the vanilla with strawberry butercream on top.  I have this issue with overtopping cupcakes with too much frosting, and Retro doesn't hold back at all. However, I'd like to emphasize that you will definitely eat all their buttercream on top because it's not too sweet, just right, and it just looks darn cute. Now, for the cupcake review:\n\nVanilla cupcake with strawberry buttercream:  Fan-tas-tic.  Moist, vanilla cake that's perfectly moist but can hold up to the buttercream swirled on top.  The flavor is perfect and the cake itself is not too sweet--just right.  Same thing goes with that gorgeous buttercream frosting on top.  I loved it and I took half of it off, only to find myself eating the rest of that frosting by itself.  It was really good.\n\nTart Cupcake: I believe that was the name of the label.  It tastes like a tart cranberry cupcake with lemonade buttercream on top.  It was tart and sweet, and a perfect springtime cupcake.  Absolutely tart-o-licious!\n\nGlazed Donut:  Just as it's named.  This cupcake tastes like a krispy kreme original glazed donut with a cupcake texture.  That glaze they put on top is awesome and if I didn't know any better I'd say Johnny (their head baker) stole the krispy kreme recipe.  It's my favorite that I'll definitely go back for on a regular basis.\n\nMaple bacon: This one is definitely a foodie favorite.  If you like to put bacon in your waffles or in french toast, you'll dig this cupcake.  It's sweet and savory with chewy real bacon pieces on top of the maple buttercream and inside the cupcake.  It was a true first for me and I actually enjoyed it!  great flavor and texture, but I have a feeling that people who aren't too adventurous will like this with the first bite. Trust me, though, it sounds strange, but bacon lovers will swoon over it.\n\nI have many more that I could review individually, but you just have to go and try it for yourself.  All of them are moist, delicious, and just right.  I love the ambiance of the bakery, the flavors that they sell and their prices.  The prices are more than fair for their cupcakes.  I'm looking forward to ordering a birthday cake from them for my husband this month!  From the pictures on yelp they look fantastic.\n\nOverall, retro is a great cupcake place that's stolen my heart.  You have to stop by and try this place when you're in the area because it's definitely worth it."

The colors were very different even after spending time discussing colors and the bakery reconfirming the colors. After that disappointment, we tried the cake. It was so dry and flavorless.

I can't let my loyalty waver for my favorite bakery here in CA (Sweet Passions Bakery in Cupertino), but Retro Bakery is amazing, their buttercream puts it over the top.  It's even in their slogan, \"It's All About The Buttercream\", it sure is!\n\nRetro Bakery provides all of NW Las Vegas' sweet tooths with their daily dose of sugar.  This bakery features several different flavors of pristine cupcakery.  Although all of the flavors are delicious, there are a few that are sure to please even the most incredulous of eaters.  The Maple Bacon (sounds gross but is heavenly) boasts bacon cake filled with maple syrup topped with maple buttercream.  For the people who have their reservations about a bacon cake, just imagine eating a breakfast with bacon and pancakes, it's not gross in that setting, so it's easy to enjoy as a cupacke in my opinion.\n\nOther standout flavors were the Hop Scotch, Milk & Cookies (a real Chocolate Chip cookie perched atop vanilla buttercream), Glazed Donut (tastes exactly as it sounds), Apple Cider and Pucker Up which has raspberry cake topped with lemon buttercream.  A much better alternative to Just Cupcakes which I think is now closed but I could be mistaken.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the cake itself is above average, but the buttercream is what makes the cupcake spectacular.  If you crave sweets, this should be a staple stop anytime you're in Vegas."

The frosting amount is overkill. You can't taste the actual cupcake with out getting a huge dollop of frosting.  I took frosting off to really taste the actual cupcake and I felt silly I paid so much for four! They are way too expensive. \n\nThis is the second time I come here, I really wanted to like this place and had to prove myself it wasn't a bad batch I had last time."

They have 3 separate windows of time that they make their deliveries.  Mine were to be dropped off I believe between 3 and 5 and the delivery person arrived at our hotel a little bit past 3 o'clock.  I ended up going to the wrong valet area to meet her and felt bad that I had to make her wait for me to finally find the right one and pick up my cupcakes, but she was totally cool about it.  Very nice girl!\n\nThe cupcakes did not disappoint and were well worth the $20 delivery fee they charge.  We had to get their dreamy Hop Scotch again - eyes roll to the the back of the head good!!  I'm a vanilla kind of girl so I had to get their Vanilla Loves Vanilla again as well.  Others we got were the Milk & Cookies, Cotton Candy, and a special strawberry one that they were offering for a limited time.  While they were all good, my favorite of those three was the Cotton Candy.  It's up there as a favorite along with their Hop Scotch and Vanilla Loves Vanilla.  My birthday was coming up so we had \"Happy Birthday\" picks placed on top of each cupcake - cute!  Can't wait to have their cupcakes again! :)"

I have to say what an honor it was to meet the owner herself. She REALLY stands behind her product and cares about her company. I love that. We were coming for our daughters birthday one year and forgot they were not open that day. We tweeted we were headed to Vegas and needed cupcakes. She actually responded to let us know they were closed so we would not waste a trip and we came the next day instead. I can not tell you how much I appreciated that. Definitely HIGHLY recommend this place. Stop by. You will NOT be sorry, although your hips may because its hard to eat just one."

I called and spoke to Brian, who told me that I didn't need to make an appointment, just to come down. He told me that all of their cake flavors were available as cupcakes, so there was no reason for an appointment.\n\nMy matron of honor and I showed up to find 3 different flavors of cupcakes available (lemon, white and chocolate). When I said I was there for a cake testing, I was then told the cost was $20, something that was NOT mentioned to me over the phone by Brian. I was okay with paying the $20, even though they didn't mention it on the phone, but they had only 3 flavors left to choose from! Add to that my frustration of driving 40 minutes in rush hour traffic to get to this place....well, I wasn't too happy. Not to mention, I wasn't planning on having a PB&J wedding cake, so I really couldn't TASTE the cake unless I scraped off all the foofoo frosting, which is really what they charge you for.  Carrie then informed us that no bakeries in town offer free cake tasting (which is a complete lie).\n\nThey didn't offer me a book of wedding cake pictures or seem really to want any information, other than for me to buy the cupcakes, so my guess is that they really don't WANT to do wedding cakes. Besides, why would I pay $20 to sample their cupcakes (a $7 savings over their normal price) when I don't want a cupcake for my wedding cake, and then in addition, I have to pay for my wedding cake? Forget it!\n\nJudging from the other reviews and the customers in the store when I was there, my guess is that this place has pretty good cupcakes, but I would NEVER recommend them for wedding cakes!"

With their unique style and flavor, you have to come here and try it. \n\nLocated in the North West part of Vegas, right off 95 and Durango. Retro Bakery is located in one of those mini mall places not far from the highway. It is a small bakery, but it smells really good when you get there. I probably don't like the parking cause it does seem tight for a mini van. But its the store that make it worth while. \n\nI love their toppings, which is kind of unique, when it comes to cupcake. No matter how long those cupcakes been sitting out there, once you bite one, IT'S SO FLUFFY!!!! Over all, is very delicious, especially with whatever topping you get. I love the Cotton Candy cupcakes, those are my favorite. But we did try others, and I'm sure you'll love them as much as we did. \n\nIf you love cupcakes, and tired of the same old cupcakes, Retro Bakery is truly, one of a kind."

We ordered a dozen cupcakes:\n\n1. Spicy Pumpkin\nCinnamon spice cake with pumpkin pie buttercream.\n- The cinnamon spice cake was delicious! The pumpkin pie buttercream was DISGUSTING! And I love pumpkin!  I just peeled off the frosting and ate the cake.  Pretty disappointing.\n\n2. Milk & Cookies\nChocolate-chip cake topped with vanilla buttercream and a freshly baked chocolate-chip cookie.\n- I didn't like the fact that when I took the cookie off the top, all of the buttercream came with it.  But the cake part was delicious and surprisingly, the cookie kinda tasted salty.\n\n3. Hopscotch\nVanilla cake topped with vanilla buttercream dipped in butterscotch ganache\n- I'm not really a butterscotch fan, but this was ok.  The cake was really moist!\n\n4. Salted Caramel Crunch\nChocolate cake topped with caramel buttercream sprinkled with sea salt and topped with a chocolate covered pretzel\n- I thought the chocolate cake was a little dry.  But the caramel buttercream and chocolate covered pretzel were delish!\n\n5. Coffee & Donuts\nVanilla cake covered in donut glaze and topped with a dollop of coffee buttercream.  Husband said that it was good.\n\n6. Apple Cider\nCinnamon swirl cake topped with apple cider buttercream dusted with cinnamon and sugar\n- The cake part reminded me of a coffee cake and was really good!  The buttercream definitely had that apple & cider flavor.  Truthfully, I ate most of the cake part without the frosting.\n\n7. Toasted Coconut\nToasted coconut cake topped with vanilla bean buttercream, toasted coconut, and sweetened condensed milk\n- I didn't see or taste the condensed milk but if you love coconut, you'll love this cupcake.  Coconut all the way!\n\nWe really wanted to try the cinnamon toast, but were told that the spicy pumpkin took the place of it?\n\nOverall, I definitely enjoyed the unique flavor combinations of the cupcakes, but being that its at least a 30 minute drive from my house, not sure that I would drive the 30 minutes just for a cupcake.\n\nThe other reason I wanted to try them- I am looking for a dessert place for my office holiday party.  $29 for 12 cupcakes is a little steep.  And no, they don't give discounts if you order 40+ cupcakes (I asked)."

For various reasons we just haven't made it the last few times we've been to Vegas.  This past weekend we FINALLY made it!\n\nI almost chickened out after reading some of the negative reviews, thinking I'd be sorely disappointed.  Fortunately for me, I LOVED IT.  I'm not even a huge cupcake person, but these little cakes were really incredible.  I was initially shocked at how heavy the box of 4 cupcakes were.  They are substantial!  The cake is moist and heavy, but not too heavy.  The cupcakes are a good size, bigger than Sprinkles, but not as big as say, Bristol Farms (if you've ever been there).  The buttercream frosting is sweet, but I didn't find it too sweet like some people did.  There's a good amount, leaving enough frosting for every bite.\n\nHere's what we tried (in order of favorites):\n\nThink Pink:  This is their breast cancer awareness month cupcake that donates $1 of every cupcake sold to Susan G. Komen.  Pink vanilla cake with strawberry frosting.  Husband and I both agreed this was the winner!  I almost didn't order it, as it didn't sound that impressive, but I'm a sucker for anything breast cancer related.  The cake was moist and the frosting super flavorful.  It didn't taste at all like fake strawberry, which really impressed me.\n\nHopscotch:  Their #1 seller, so we had to try.  Vanilla cake with vanilla frosting, dunked in butterscotch.  The butterscotch dunk really put it over the edge!  Yum.\n\nDrumstick: Vanilla cake with vanilla frosting, dipped in chocolate and crushed nuts.  It was very reminiscent of a drumstick and the chocolate with nuts was a great combo.\n\nPucker up: Raspberry cake with lemon frosting.  Husband really liked it, but it was just so-so for me.  I'm a sweets person 100% and would have liked if the frosting was a bit sweeter.  If you don't like things overly sweet, I'd definitely recommend this.  It's not something I'd order again with all the other great options to try, but it wasn't bad.\n\nThe girls working the counter were super friendly and helpful, which always ups the experience.  We will definitely return next time we're in Vegas!  It's about 20 minutes off the strip, but definitely worth the trip!"

We ordered a half dozen: \n\n-Red Carpet: red velvet cake/almond buttercream\n-Chocolate Fountain: chocolate cake, chocolate buttercream, chocolate ganache\n-Milk & Cookies: chocolate chip cake, vanilla buttercream and a chocolate chip cookie\n-Shamrock Shake: green vanilla cake and mint buttercream (March special)\n-Apple Cider: cinnamon swirl cake and apple cider buttercream\n-Sprinkled Donut: vanilla cake, fudge ganache and sprinkles (this thing is God's gift to man)\n\nEach cupcake was the right amount of moist; the cake tastes homemade and not like it came off a production line. The flavors are not overpowering and blend together well even with the more unique recipes like the Apple Cider cupcake. The buttercream really is all they make it out to be - not too thick, not too sweet and not too much of it. They also look pretty, but with that homemade touch. They look like a human being made them, not a machine like grocery store cupcakes. \n\nWe ate the cupcakes over the course of 3 days and they held up wonderfully. Even the cookie on the Milk & Cookies cupcake stayed soft. My favorite was the Sprinkled Donut (I still see it in my dreams, I swear.) \n\nThe bakery itself was great as well. It smells fantastic inside, and two of our cupcakes(Shamrock Shake and Red Carpet) came from fresh trays that were brought out as we were deciding on cupcakes. Service was prompt and friendly; they gave us plenty of time to make our choices with out rushing us. The price is much cheaper than similar bakeries - $2.65 a cupcake or $29 a dozen. \n\nRetro is definitely worth the drive. They keep it simple, and focus on just making a fantastic product. I will be back to try more of their flavors."

We received a container of 12 for about $30. Complete waste of money. The cupcakes were soggy and disgusting. The buttercream tasted very sweet but it wasn't tasty or satisfying. It wasn't creamy or delicious. The buttercream was nothing more than a sugary colored goo on top of several very soggy, very bland, very dry and stale tasting cupcakes. They were a complete disappointment. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and I will not be buying any kind of cake from Retro Bakery again."

They looked so good I opted for one instead of a cupcake.  It was packaged up all nice and neat and I patiently waited to get home to shove it down my food hole.  Not bad for a dollar, because it was pretty big.  However, the taste was lacking something it's hard to explain what.

To make it even more worthwhile and because I couldn't choose between all the delicious varieties, I ended up purchasing 6 cupcakes. hehehe. The cupcakes I got were:\n\n-Sprinkled Donut-Vanilla cake with chocolate ganache frosting and sprinkles. Really cute presentation on this one, but it tasted like a box cake with box frosting to me, nothing special here.\n-Vanilla Loves Vanilla-Really yummy vanilla cupcake with vanilla buttercream frosting. The frosting was piled a bit high so I wouldn't be able to have frosting with each bite, so I kind of smooshed the frosting down a bit.\n-Chocolate Loves Vanilla-Chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream frosting. I don't really like chocolate cake, but I got this one because it was decorated with a hot pink marshmallow peep for Easter. I think the Peep made the cupcake amazing, since the marshmallow flavor combined with the vanilla and the chocolate, making it amazing.\n-Red Carpet-Red velvet cake with almond buttercream frosting. The cake was fine, but the frosting I wasn't really expecting an almond flavor so I was kind of taken back. It was definitely good, but not as a typical red velvet cupcake.\n-Milk & Cookies-Chocolate chip cake with vanilla buttercream and a chocolate chip cookie on top. Just the sight of this cupcake alone is yummy enough. This cupcake just blew me away, it was pretty much perfect.\n-Short Stack-This is a Friday special only, lucky me I came on a Friday! This cupcake was breathtaking. It tasted like pancakes! I think this one was my absolute favorite.\n\nThe place is cute, the service was very friendly, the price is definitely reasonable and the cupcakes were a total knockout. This place is definitely worth the drive, and when I come back to Vegas in October I might be inclined to go for a dozen cupcakes, and not share any of them! :-P"

The counter girl was nice as I assume the owner was as well since she cashed me out.  \n\nI asked the counter girl what her favorite was, she told me the hopscotch. It wasn't my personal taste so I asked her what customers favorite was, again it was the hopscotch. She suggested I try the monthly flavor which was banana topped with buttercream and crushed Lay's chips. Sounds good to me, so I bought that one and a cherry cheesecake cupcake. \n\nMy two cupcakes came to $5.30, whoa cheap! Awesome! So I got to my car being the fatty that I am wanted to eat one right away. They were both in an individual bag and I picked the cherry cheesecake cupcake. The cake was super moist and cherry flavored, complete with actual cherries. The cake itself was good. Now, I love frosting! But this frosting missed the mark entirely.  It was way too sweet, it didn't have any discernible cheesecake flavor to it and it was dry! It had a very unpleasant, hey, I have been sitting in this display case for hours crust on it.  I didn't even want to finish the cupcake. The frosting just killed it. \n\nI figured I'd have better luck with the banana cupcake. It tasted like banana but bread without nuts. It was moist and had good flavor, but again the frosting was way too sweet! And there is so much of it, cleverly disguising a less than average sized cupcake. I am going to say that there is as much frosting as there is cupcake. \n\nThe cupcakes are smaller and you do pay a smaller price in comparison to other places, but I hated the frosting! And I didn't taste any of the saltiness of the potato chips on the banana cupcake. I don't think I will go back. Not worth the calories.\n\nIf you need me I will be at the dentist getting the cavity filled that this overly sweet, sugary frosting gave me..."

The selection is good with different flavors, but it would be nice to have something different, maybe with fruit. Personally, I don't like a super sweet cupcake and most of them have a very sweet frosting. Some of the cupcakes seem a little less sweet than others, but the standard frosting is super sugary. The cake portion is good and the pink lemonade was an interesting combo, plus there was an old fashioned one that looked like one of the retro chocolate cupcakes with the frosting inside and a swirl on the top. That actually didn't taste overly sweet. Pricing is a little high and no military discounts."

When I found out that the cupcakes were from Retro Bakery I started getting a little anxious. I only saw a few cupcakes sitting out on the table so I wasn't sure if they were just for the kids or if there were enough for the adults. I was ready to bum rush the table and push aside any toddler in my way to get my hands on Retro's infamous buttercream. After thinking about it (and picturing my wife's look of horror and anger if I did) I decided to do the mature thing and wait. \n\nI waited and waited. I waited patiently as each kid went up and grabbed a cupcake with their tiny little hands. When the green light was given to the adults, I quickly made my way to the table, weaving through the crowd of kids and parents. I was like Barry Sanders back in the day -- spinning, juking, cutting from side to side to reach the end zone. As it turned out, they had a ton of mini cupcakes. There were more than enough to satisfy my appetite.\n\nEverything I tried was as good as I imagined. Soft, moist cakes topped with rich, flavorful, and silky-smooth buttercream. Here's how I would rank them:\n\n1) Chocolate fountain (chocolate cake topped w/ chocolate buttercream and dipped in chocolate ganache)\n2) Hop scotch (vanilla cake topped w/ vanilla buttercream dipped in butterscotch ganache)\n3) Cookies and cream (chocolate cake toped w/ crushed chocolate sandwich cookie buttercream)\n4) Red Carpet (Red cake topped w/ almond buttercream and red glitter sugar)\n5) Strawberry banana (fresh banana cake topped w/ strawberry buttercream)\n\nThe mini-cupcakes were a great way to go. I got to sample several flavors without making myself violently ill. There's a lot of hype around Retro Bakery, but it's all well deserved."

The vanilla cake on this was out of this world. I don't throw that around much.  Though they used both vanilla buttercream and chocolate ganache, it was the perfect amount and the peanuts really took it over the edge. God, now I want one.\n\n* Hop Scotch -- their best selling and very delicious, but a bit too sweet for me. The cake was vanilla and moist, but I think I would've preferred either butterscotch glaze or frosting, not both. If you've got a sweet tooth, this is your jam. (Note, messy to eat, so be sitting somewhere.)\n\n* Red Carpet - we'd already finished buying our four cupcakes, but when I saw these come out of the oven, I had to get one. The cake was moist, light, had a good red velvet flavor. It wasn't as good as some other red velvets I've had (I tend to prefer more cocoa in my red velvet), but it's right up there. The frosting, on the other hand, was so awesome and I'm not a big frosting person. It was probably the best cream cheese icing I've ever had, next to my grandmother's.\n\n* Retro Cupcake - my boyfriend got this one, but I had a bite. It was totally spot on -- like the classic Hostess, but, you know, good. I loved the cream in the innards.\n\n* Chocolate Fountain - my boyfriend also got this one and it was out of control chocolate. They're not messing around here. It's awesome, but chocoholics need only apply. A bit messy to eat.\n\nBig ups to the staff -- they were so sweet and friendly. They complimented me on my dress and didn't even think it was weird when my boyfriend pulled Domo from his pocket and wanted to do a cupcake photoshoot.  They had nothing but high praise and were very professional while still being inviting. Thanks!\n\nI seriously want a cupcake now."

During that trip, I had the pleasure of downright engulfing a scrumptious morsel of cupcake goodness from the famed Magnolia Bakery.  (Okay, okay... we were on the Sex and the City Tour and the cupcakes we had were technically from the midtown version of Magnolia Bakery -- thanks to the original Magnolia's rule of not allowing someone to purchase more than a dozen cupcakes at once... or somethine like that... which prevented our tour guide from giving us cupcakes from the actual Magnolia location.  But we consumed our cupcakes on a bench across the street from Magnolia and the cupcakes were made at a bakery that's owned by one of the original Magnolia partners and uses the same recipe/ingredients/methodologies).\n\nAt any rate, I've sampled cupcakes from The Cupcakery and Cupcake Lane Bakery... but Retro Bakery is numero uno in the greater Las Vegas area.  Very nearly Magnolia quality -- hence the four stars.  Something tells me that if Retro began using NYC water, however, I would be compelled to give five stars.  After all, it's the water in NYC that gives ulinary types in that area an edge over everyone else, right?"

Since we live on the other side of town from retro bakery, there really was no reason to drive up all the way just to try another batch of cupcakes since the first time was just mediocre. We found ourselves on this part of town yesterday since we needed to go to centennial toyota, and I decided to give retro bakery another shot. We bought the retro cupcake, coffee and donut, and the pumpkin spice, and boy, were we just disappointed as last time. As many others have stated, the frosting was too sweet, all you can really taste is the sugar and a hint of coffee flavoring at the end, same goes with the pumpkin cupcake. The cake part was just too bland. It almost tastes like those boxed cake mixes you can buy at the groceries. Not impressed at all. Only saving grace was the service as both girls in the counter were very helpful and friendly. Go ahead and stop by if you're in the area, but not worth traveling to in my opinion."

However, being that this is my 100th review, I would like it to be for my favorite cupcake place.\n\nWhat can I really say that hasn't been said already? I have been to pretty much every cupcake place in Vegas & most are definitely not anywhere near as good or mentionable, or even reviewable (IMO) for that matter. Kari really knows what she is doing ;)\n\nI have tasted most of the flavors just to say I have, but I like to stick to my faves: Chocolate Fountain, the Big Kahuna, Hop Scotch & the Retro. I'm usually a chocolate cake person, but when it comes to the vanilla cake...OMG! The moistocity is just insane! I really miss the Salted Caramel cupcake :( I was informed by Kari one day that she is trying to retool the recipe due to some issues with the old one. Here are some honorable mentions as well: Apple Cider, Milk & Cookies, Maple Bacon, Cookies & Cream & Mint Chocolate Chip.\n\nFun Fact: I asked Kari one day if she had ever considered going on Cupcake Wars on Food Netrwork, and she said they had asked her, but she declined due to the fact that the participants recipes become property of the Food Network. You gotta respect that! I'm glad they didn't sell out just for exposure, which they have gotten plenty of on their own merit anyways. I believe, had Retro participated, they would've definitely smoked the competition."

            "review": "Let me start off by saying that these AMAZING cupcakes put the Cupcakery to shame!!!  Retro's cupcakes are the most flavorful, moist, delicious sweets on this earth!  The are absolutely out of this world!  My family and I were blown away by how much flavor is packed into the cake, let alone the frosting which is a whole other taste sensation in itself!  I was a little hesitant on what they would taste like at first, only because I had such a let down and was disappointed with the Cupcakery, but Retro's cupcakes stood up to and succeeded my expectations.  I never knew a cupcake could taste so good!  My absolute favorites were the pink lemonade, glazed donut, and apple cider.   \n\nAnother reason why this place is so great is due to the husband and wife team that own it.  From the moment my husband and I walked in the door  they were so friendly and accommodating.  We visited for like 10 or 15 minutes while we picked out our cupcakes and felt so welcome at their store.  They are wonderful people, and I wish them much success with their business.  \n\nFinally , the store itself is clean and tidy, with a cool retro feel  ( I am jealous of the yellow fridge...I want one!).  Our entire experience has been so incredible with Retro that I just want to spread the word over and over again about this great little find.  I am definitely hooked and will drive across town in a heartbeat for more anytime!"

We've been eager to try it after hearing its praises, it's much further than a hop, skip and jump away so this was the first time we were in the area during business hours. We figured a cupcake picnic was in order.\n\nThe girls behind the counter were warm and friendly. We looked over our options and selected four cupcakes and a cookie for the road. The damage came to 12 bucks and some change.\n\nWe tucked the cupcakes away for later and dug into the cookie as soon as we pulled away. This cookie was loaded with a variety of chocolate and butterscotch morsels. It was tender and chewy, but WAY to sweet. We each had a bite, we couldn't finish the rest. \n\nLater, we dug into the cupcakes. The Glazed Donut cupcake was the first we tried. It was pretty good. The cake was nice and moist and the glaze was on the verge of being too sweet. My husband tried the Red Carpet next. He found the almond buttercream overly sweet and complained that the cake was a bit dry. I was most excited about the Maple Bacon cupcake. My teeth ached from one bite, I scraped the buttercream off and enjoyed the cupcake itself. It was pleasantly moist from the maple syrup center. Lastly, we had the Drumstick. I loved the ganache and nut topping, just not the buttercream frosting beneath it. This cake was too dry without it.\n\nIt's a shame we missed their tagline \"It's all about the buttercream.\" It is indeed all about that buttercream. This is only a good thing if you LOVE buttercream.\n\nI wanted to love Retro Bakery like the masses do, but I just don't have the sweet tooth for it."

Thankfully, everything on my wishlist was there in the case :)  I got the Hopscotch (and announced to my husband when we got back in the car that he could have whatever he wanted in the box EXCEPT the Hopscotch and that while I did love him, that one? Was MINE), Red Carpet, Chocolate Covered Banana, Glazed Donut, Drumstick, and the Apple Cider.  Of course once we got back to our hotel, I dove (literally) into the Hopscotch and was giddy! The cake was light and moist and the buttercream was exactly what buttercream should be - delectable and not too heavy, not too light!  $2.50 per cupcake was reasonable; I have paid more for far inferior cupcakes.  Cute shop, love the black and yellow!\n\nI'm from SoCal where the big boy cupcakeries are Sprinkles and Crumbs Bakeshop and while I love Sprinkles, they are huge cupcakes and I can usually only eat one and then I am down for the count.  Not so with Retro.  Their cupcakes are normal size and you can eaaaaasily wolf down two cupcakes, possibly three, before the gluttony guilt begins to rear its ugly head.  I was uber happy with that!!  \n\nI am glad that I gave Retro a shot this time on my trip to LV because my last trip here, I tried *another* local cupcake bakery and was sorely disappointed (I actually threw cupcakes in the trash and I don't toss anything, I'm no quitter!).  Am I a cupcake snob? Sort of.  I appreciate a well-made cupcake.  Most bakeries go for presentation but miss the mark on flavor and originality.  Retro hits the mark! They have won me over and I will gladly be back every trip to LV (and possibly once again before I leave this weekend!!)."

Unique flavors and an appetizing presentation that makes you eat first with your eyes. \n\nMy co-workers and I placed an order a week in advance for a dozen cupcakes. We hopped onto Retro Bakery's website to view their showcase of interesting creations. Choosing flavors can be toughest decision in the ordering process because there's so many delicious looking little cakes. We ended up ordering the Hop Scotch, Big Kahuna, and Coffee and Donuts. \n\nThe Hop Scotch is one of their best sellers, and the only cupcake that I tried because it was really just enough to handle. The cake part is moist, but the thick, generous swirl of butterscotch flavored icing on top was none that I tried before. It's also *very* sweet and rich. I can't speak about the other flavors, but my co-workers each liked their picks.\n\nCupcakes cost a little over $2.00, and a dozen is $29.00. I can't compare the pricing to other bakeries because I don't usually go out of my way to buy cupcakes, but I think  the price seems reasonable for these sweet indulgences."

I said sure and we began our trek from the South West part of Las Vegas. I was not aware of the amount of time it can take to drive out to the bakery, but we pressed on and knew the buttercream goodness was just a few more miles away. I mention this so anyone on the South side of town is prepared for it.\n\nOnce we reached the bakery, Kari the proprietor, was there to greet us. She knew who we were from seeing our Twitter pictures, so that was nice. Then we spent a while flipping through her many cake photo books. There are some cool looking cakes in those books if you're looking for something to get for a special anniversary, birthday or just for fun. Her retro kitch is key to the culture of the company and who work there.\n\nShe then proceeded to give all three of us the run down on what was available that day. We settled on a 'red carpet' red velvet cupcake with pink sugar crystals and almond buttercream on top, a cookies & cream cupcake that is chocolate with cookie crumbles and a creamy buttercream top, a maple bacon cupcake with vanilla cake and a bacon crumble top & maple syrup plus more maple buttercream, a hop scotch cupcake that includes vanilla cake topped with vanilla buttercream plus it was smothered in butterscotch ganache, a chocolate banana cupcake that was a chocolate cake with a nice banana tasting buttercream on top.\n\nWe enjoyed a cupcake each at the bakery shop and took the above mentioned ones home for later. Little did we know that these suckers are big and had the second one the next day. I encourage anyone in Las Vegas, if you have the round trip time, to go and see for yourself what this place is all about. Thanks to Kari for helping us out with the choices and for the complimentary half dozen assortment. You can find them for $2.65 a piece, $14.50 for a half dozen and $29 for a full dozen. Tell Kari, if you see her, that Chris @24k sent you."

One of the employees did come around the counter and point out the flavors (would have been difficult for me to read those little signs).\n\nThe two things I did like about this place 1) The price, I was excited to see cupcakes under $3. 2) Cupcakes on the North side!!!"

Ordering was easy and they called back several times to make sure that they got everything absolutely right. I can't say enough good about retro bakery I was a little nervous whether the cake would be as good as the reviews say; but the reviews did not let me down! The cake and cupcakes were absolutely delicious! All of my guests were talking about how good they were and I had a hard time wanting to freeze my cake for our year anniversary but we did save all of it to freeze. I'm excited to taste it in a year for our anniversary. The delivery guy was early they were neatly placed in boxes and overall just wonderful service. My husband and I will be back to visit just to try the cupcakes sometime when we return to Vegas. Thank you so much!"

What a complete headache. \nYou get two cupcakes to taste for free, which is fine. My fiance and I decided to pick the two flavors WE would like to eat on our wedding day. I asked the girl helping me, Chelsea, if I could place the order. I said I wanted an assortment of cupcakes and cookies. She quoted me a price and told my mom 50% of the price would have to be paid that day and then started filling out what I thought was the order sheet. Then she said, \"So you only want these two flavors?\" and I said \"No, I want an assortment.\" Again, she didn't listen. She told me I had to e-mail the manager and tell him how many people we needed to feed, the date, and attach a photo of what I wanted the cupcakes to look like. I had already told her the amount we wanted and the date and that I didn't want them customized. I repeated, for the third time, that I simply wanted an assortment of cupcakes and cookies for the dessert table and asked if we could just place the order and pay our deposit and she responded by giving me the managers e-mail address and saying I had to speak to him. I don't think she listened to a single word I said and the situation was completely confusing and frankly, it made me quite angry as it was a total waste of my time. If somebody is about to spend nearly $400 at your bakery, shouldn't you try to make them happy? Evidently not. I left and somebody from the bakery called me that afternoon to ask about my \"custom wedding cake\". At this point I was so annoyed that the girl clearly hadn't listened to what I wanted that I didn't even bother placing an order. We will be going elsewhere for our wedding cupcakes."

We booked them for our wedding last Saturday. \n\nWe ordered 12 dozen mini cupcakes in 5 different flavors (maple bacon, lemon/raspberry, chocolate/peanut butter, birthday cake and red velvet) and 1 small 6\" bride and groom cake in butterscotch. The prices were more than reasonable and the quality of the cupcakes exceeded our expectations. We were nervous because we weren't able to do a tasting with Retro before we ordered, but we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the product as well as the customer service Retro provides.\n\nCommunication with Retro (Brian was our point of contact) was effortless, easy, timely and clear. We provided pictures of our idea of a mock cake table set up and we arrived at our reception with the entire set up looking better than we could have imagined. See the pictures I posted. \n\nWe will certainly recommend Retro to everyone we know and use them for anything in the future as far as bakery needs go in Vegas."

However, we couldn't have picked a better one. I only wish they had a location back home!\n\nWe ordered a 6 inch cake for cutting, along with 9 dozen mini cupcakes, and they were some of the best I've ever had. The guest favorite was the Hop Scotch, but they loved them all. We also ordered Pucker Up, Cookies & Cream, Milk & Cookies, Chocolate Loves Vanilla, and Red Carpet (my favorite). Our cake was Chocolate Loves Vanilla, and every slice was devoured. Sadly, despite how much we enjoyed them, we had sooo many cupcakes left over. I only hope that some hotel employees were able to enjoy them. I would have taken them home if I could.\n\nI was not there when everything was delivered and set up, but it appears to have gone flawlessly. When we got to the suite for the reception, everything was set up beautifully. I was able to send Brian some pictures and describe exactly what I wanted, and he made it come together just right.\n\nWe may have to take a little road trip to Retro next time we are in Vegas.

Other cupcake establishments do not compare to the delicacies being served up here, IMHO.  One of my Yelp idols, Amanda M., reminded me that this place is the best and she was right, as usual.  I stopped by on New Year's Eve to pick up dessert for my son, boyfriend, and I to enjoy whilst ringing in 2014.  Service here is quick and friendly; the hardest part is making a decision on which cupcakes to get. \n\nTo ring in 2014, I chose six flavors (descriptions are Retro Bakery's since they know best):\nApple Cider:  cinnamon swirl topped with apple cider buttercream\nRed Carpet:  red cake topped with almond buttercream and red glitter sugar\nPeanut Butter Cup:  chocolate cake topped with peanut butter buttercream and dark chocolate shavings\nSprinkled Donut:  vanilla cake dipped in fudge and sprinkles\nGlazed Donut:  vanilla cake drenched in donut glaze\nThe Retro: chocolate cake stuffed with vanilla fluff and dipped in chocolate fudge (basically the Hostess cupcake, but better)\n\nAs if buying 7 cupcakes for three people weren't enough (I got two of the Red Carpet), I also purchased two of the Red Velvet Chip cookies, a fresh batch of which was just placed in the case, so they were still warm even after the drive home.  I know this because I ate one of the cookies.  And then I ate the other one.  What?  Yes, they were that good.\nThe cupcakes from Retro are moist and flavorful.  It's all about the buttercream frosting there, too, just as their motto declares. The b/f loves peanut butter so the Peanut Butter Cup was for him. I guess he liked it because I didn't even get to try it!  The teen gobbled up his fave, the Red Carpet(red velvet)--that's why I got two, since I knew he wouldn't share his, either.  I really enjoyed the Glazed Donut and Sprinkled Donut flavors followed by the Red Carpet.  If you're vegan, you can get three flavors with 24 hour notice:  Chocolate Loves Vanilla Bean, Cookies and No Cream, and Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup. There are other flavors available that I'll need to go back and try soon, including the seasonal Salted Caramel and Toasted Coconut.  Believe me, it's not going to take me two years for that next visit, either."

I was in need of a single, aesthetically pleasing cupcake, flavor was not important. I rolled in just a bit before closing, so my options were a bit limited... Two SUPER friendly and helpful ladies helped me pick out the best looking cupcake of the bunch. \n\nI ended up deciding on the flavor of the month which was Chocolate Covered Strawberry... The website describes this as: Chocolate cake topped with strawberry buttercream dipped in dark chocolate ganache. Cost was around $3 with tax. \n\nNot only was this one adorable cupcake, but the taste test also did not disappoint. The cake itself was nice and moist but the 'icing on the cake' if you will was the frosting. It tasted just like a chocolate covered strawberry, only not juicy. \n\nMy tastebuds are devastated but my hips and wallet are both thankful that Retro Bakery is on the other side of town from my house! If it was closer I could see myself making many trips to satisfy my sweet tooth."

I am not a huge CAKE person for me it is all about the frosting. Well this place has delicious Buttercream.. when they say \"Its all about the Buttercream\" they are telling you the truth. Just be warned it is SWEET. I couldn't settle one the flavors I wanted to try so I ended up getting a full dozen.\n\nI ended up trying a few bites of each kind I purchased I am going to go ahead and bullet my opinions on each one but let me say that each and every one I took a bite of was FRESH and had moist cake. Everyone is going to have different opinions as to what flavor is best.. The friend who told me about this place was in SHOCK that I am not a chocolate Chocolate fan lol so just keep that in mind but I feel this place is definitely worth a try!\n\nHop Scotch- This is on their Flavor sheet as the #1 Seller . I UNDERSTAND why.. it's delicious vanilla cake with vanilla buttercream dipped in butterscotch which I found to be just the right consistency and completely delightful. I couldn't finish the whole thing but I still am thinking about how great that first bite was.... YUM YUM YUM\n\n\nMilk & Cookies- This was one of my favorites.. I took it in one big bite to get the cookie,frosting and cake at once. Which can be overload but I love those stuffed cookies and this added a nice balance with the chocolate chip Cake. \n\nMaple Bacon-  I really enjoyed this one too because I am a fan of the bacon flavored items. This was a nice balance that had real bacon flavor without the nasty after tastes that can come with hybrid bacon items and the maple wasn't too over powering .. I was able to get that sweet/salty balance.\n\nCotton Candy- Basically what it says a Cotton Candy frosted Cupcake that definitely tasted like you'd expect. The color was beautiful and my daughter and son were both drawn to it.. I enjoyed the bite of it that I had but I would not get it again.\n\nCoffee & Donuts- I am not a coffee fan butI love coffee flavored items but more than that I wanted to try the GLAZE because there was just something about the way it looked in the case.. The lady who helped me (sadly I didn't get her name) said it was her personal favorite so I decided to go ahead and give it a try.. I enjoyed it OK .. The frosting is definitely that coffee flavor but the glaze is messy and I wasn't a huge fan of the balance but the concept is awesome and I assume if you are a coffee lover this would be right up your alley.\n\nBig Kahuna-  It was so adorable basically a Pina Colada type cup cake with a sugar surf board on top and it tasted so delicious. The pineapple flavor was so amazing without being too over powering. It was almost like a Coconut cake without that cotton mouth you get from all the shaved coconut. I really enjoyed this one and now understand why there was only one left in the case!!!\n\nChocolate Fountain- I am not a huge fan of Chocolate cake so I wasn't too excited about this one but my pal who told me about the place LOVEs it so I had to give it a try. I took a bite and I will say if you love chocolate youll love this. The chocolate buttercream is the best I have ever had. My son couldn't stop raving about this cupcake and I have a feeling I will be investing in a lot of these in my future. Since my son is only five and has a huge sweet tooth and has talked about how great  this cupcake is already five times over. I probably have many years of purchases to look forward to.\n\nThe last two types I tried were basically Birthday Cake which was a blue frosting with sprinkles fun fetti cupcake and it had delicious texture and cake!!!!! and the other was just a chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting and sprinkles. Both were really good !\n\nSince I had to get duplicates for my kids in certain types I didn't try twelve different flavors so I still have a few I need to try next time I go back but overall I say this place is worth the little drive I had to take to get there . They were friendly and have quality cupcakes and cookies!!!!! I saw someone there ordering a cake so that is a plus too!!!"

Venturing 25 minutes from the Las Vegas Strip is well worth the reward of one, two, or, in my case, at least half a dozen, delectable cupcakes.\n\nKari and Brian are the wife/husband mastermind powerhouse couple behind Retro Bakery.  Their cupcakes are some of the biggest I've ever seen, and, believe me, I've seen more than my fair share.  But, see, the thing with Retro is that unlike other rivaling cupcakeries, this place is not willing to sacrifice taste for size, but rather manages to satisfy both criteria.  Furthermore, Retro cupcakes are just simply appealing to the eye.  Imagine this: full (not dinky) cupcakes with an expertly (and strategically) placed dollop of buttercream, which, I might add, is so tasty, a cup of buttercream is a recent addition to the menu!  And the menu!  Sure, you've got your typical Cookies and Cream and Mint Chocolate Chip, but you're also privy to such wildly creative flavors such as Hopscotch (one of my favs), Pink Lemonade (who DOES that?), and Creamsicle (no one can say no to that one).  Not to mention the daily specials - I've got to make it out there on a Tuesday to try the Milk and Cookies.\n\nAnd it's just so refreshing to enter a shop where the workers are actually visibly passionate and exited to be...at work!  That is a rare, rare sight nowadays, and Kari and Brian (look out for Abbi and Lucy, too!  They're adorable!) definitely go against the norm.  With their genuine smiles and upbeat attitudes, they are so inspiring.  Tell me - how many places have you gone to where the owners recognize you, call you by name after only one visit, and remember details of that one visit, which was four months ago?? It's really exhilarating to visit such an institution and actually feel appreciated for your patronage, and Retro does that for you, for me, and for every single one of its customers.\n\nSo, to sum this up, visit Retro Bakery for its cupcakes, for its environment, and for its extraordinary customer service.  You most surely won't be disappointed.\n\nKari - Best of luck to you!  I can't wait until I can head into Planet Hollywood on the strip and see you selling your bad boys there!  =)"

She is a huge Twilight fan and Retro made her special day with the cutest Twilight themed cupcakes. Although they were a little too sweet to finish, they were delicious. Easy to serve/clean, and an absolute hit with the kiddos. \n\nWe were again in Vegas for New Year's and my 30th birthday bash at Mandalay. Not only was the cake beautiful and absolutely delicious, they delivered it to the madhouse that is the strip on New Year's Eve for $25! Talk about excellent service! \n\nAfter such great experiences, I recommended Retro to family members who purchased an 80th birthday cake!  Not only was it absolutely beautiful, it was exactly what they wanted. Because of that, I purchased another more simple cake for a friend's birthday a few days later. For this one,the owner (who took the order) was very professional and accommodating considering I needed the cake for the very next day. She was able to put together an adorable \"Vegas\" themed design last minute and it turned out perfect!  \n\nWhenever we're in Las Vegas (which is pretty often) we order from Retro. With such great customer service and delicious cakes, it will be that way for many years to come!"

(Even ate a lemon one myself, holy crap was it good!  albeit another dose of insulin I would recommend to any non-diabetic.  If I'm going to be bad, this is the place for it.  \nAlso, many of the folks at the birthday party have found their way to Retro Bakery."

Plus I got to keep the decoration on top, as a keepsake, to remind me of my baby's day! Thank you all at Retro Bakery, it was delicious! My baby loved his smash cake also, he ate a a good amount, and made a mess!"

The employees are super nice and helpful & the product is amazing!\nThese definitely top the list of best cupcakes in Vegas. Every part of them is perfection. They're incredibly moist & the frosting is to die for! I have tried pretty much all the flavors including their seasonal flavors and each and every one is amazing you seriously can't go wrong with any cupcake flavor here! \nAnother great thing I love about Retro bakery is the fact that their cakes are equally as good! No they aren't super fancy decorated cakes but they taste as moist & amazing as the cupcakes! This bakery is definitely worth the drive to go check out!"

I drove to LV from LA (OC) because they are more than willing to interact with me and their fan base on Twitter. They are funny and entertaining with their tweets which causes me and others to follow what they are baking and want to drive 5 hours to try some of the best cupcakes EVER.  \nEven the flaovors have names that are retro. The owners and the baked goods ROCK.\nPictures and more soon on my blog. www.gourmetfoodtrk.com"

The cake tasted okay-it wasn't the best white cake I've had, just meh. But my friend and I got cupcakes when we picked up the cake the day before and they were fantastic! It might have been that I had to keep the cake in the fridge for a day since they weren't open on Sundays for pick up. I would go back for the cupcakes for sure!"

We were not disappointed!  The bacon cupcake was so yummy and so was the blueberry pancake cupcake. Honestly, I thought my husband I were going to fight over the bacon cupcake.  Maybe you should by 2 of those.   Kari was there and she was a sweetheart as well.  Definitely stop by and visit.  I'm telling everyone."
