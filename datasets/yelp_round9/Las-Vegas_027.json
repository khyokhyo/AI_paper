            "review": "Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill reflects Chef Eric Bromberg's words, \"Las Vegas is up late, always on, and filled with people who understand and appreciate good food.\" My friends & I were looking for a late night restaurant with high quality sushi. It was a pleasant surprise to find a good place that is open after midnight on a Friday night. The service was great--no one was rushing us to leave and no 'leftovers'. Nice ambiance, extensive menu, and great tasting sashimi and sushi. \n\nBottom line: Great late night stop for a fresh selection of sushi and the FRIED CHICKEN!"

            "review": "Blue Ribbon was one of our choices for dinner on Restaurant Week. My friend and I were excited for our dinner there! Here is a rundown of some of the items we tried and what we thought of them.\n\n*Lobster bisque - Decent, with big chunks of lobster, not hot enough and not as flavorful as I expected.\n\n*Spicy tuna - Very good! My favorite spicy tuna roll to date. It's more flavorful than others I've had, so I will be back for more of this.\n\n*California roll - Pretty good, but not my favorite.\n\n*Sparkling blueberry sake - So good!! Very sweet, but that's how I like my sake.\n\n*White ale - Pretty good and I don't even like beer.\n\n*Fried chicken - Very tender and juicy. Pleasantly surprised by this dish. I intended on having only seafood, but this was highly recommended. \n \n*Herb crusted halibut with fingerling potatoes - Pretty good, but not quite as delicious as the chicken.\n\n*Bread pudding - Best ever! I mean it. I thoroughly enjoyed this dessert. I liked it so much, that I forgot what my friend ordered for dessert. All I know is that I didn't want to share my bread pudding!\n\nI can't wait to go back and try more of their food."

I asked the server to help with quantity for the group and she really was not helpful nor made suggestions... I figured it out on my own. We got the largest sushi boat which everyone loved, had good variety. We got the steamed lobster and hat went quick. Fried chicken was good, had a little spice... The honey sauce is what made it. The pork potstickers were really good too. I had the wagyu steak and have to say was little disappointed especially for $200. It just didn't have a lot of flavor of course it was tender. I have had other wagyu steaks and this just was not my favorite. Overall a good experience just not sure if the food matches the price."

            "review": "Bromberg Bros. aka Blue Ribbon Restaurants,\n\nThe Bromberg brothers, Bruce and Eric opened the original Blue Ribbon in 1992 and had a goal to create American Comfort food blended with their French expertise. Today, Blue Ribbon has 11 restaurants including Sushi, baked goods and tapas. These Brothers have always specialized in comfort food but now have ventured out with Japanese Sushi where they partnered up with sushi expert Toshi Ueki, to create a menu of some very high quality sushi and other authentic Japanese dishes.\n\nLocated in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  The d\u00e9cor has modern accents, The dining room is dimly lit and features private booths creating a warm and intimate ambiance.\n\nWe started with some cocktails, a Green Tea Martini and Lagavulin 16 Scotch Whiskey. The Green Tea Martini was strong but had that green tea after taste. It was quite good. My Lagavulin Scotch was very strong and tasted like cloves which i wasn't a huge fun of but it was my first time trying that Whiskey.\n\nWe looked over the menu and because of the high quality sushi that is flown in daily from the Atlanta & Pacific Oceans the prices are very high. The sushi is sold by the piece which was disappointing because mostly Sushi Restaurant sell them by 2 pieces. We decided to start out off with (*Sushi Deluxe 10 Pieces & 1 Roll) [$46.00] which seem the most bang for our buck. The Deluxe Sushi was Omakase which means Chef's Choice. I don't recall which sushi we were given but everything was very fresh. The way you can tell if the fish is fresh is by the texture. If it's silky smooth in your mouth and has a distinct flavor its really fresh.  We ending up ordering another Sushi Deluxe because the flavors were so outstanding and delicious.\n\nThere was another item on the menu that caught my eye which was Waygu Sushi which was the best rare beef i have ever eaten. I wanted to order more but it was very expensive.\n\nThe service was outstanding. I forget our servers name but he is Filipino. He was very professional and explain the menu and helped us get them most value without breaking the bank. We thoroughly enjoy the service, atmosphere and delicious Sushi Diner.  I would recommend this place to someone who really has an appreciation for high quality sushi. \n\nThanks for reading.\n\nMatthew Y."

If you like Sushi, have been to several other sushi restaurants and often look to step it up, Blue Ribbon will help you get there!\n\nWe more at Blue Ribbon than a one night stay at the Cosmopolitan. We kicked it off with a yellowtail jalape\u00f1o appetizer - exquisite. Next, headed on to the Cosmopolitan platter for $85 which included higher end cuts of sushi & sashimi and it was amazing. Presentation was fantastic and the cuts were amazing. It wasn't enough to satisfy our hunger however - there is a platter that is twice the price on the menu that serves 4 people - I'd recommend it. If you're just there for sushi you can't go wrong. We ordered a surf & turf platter next. \n\n9 oz filet & a 1.25 lb lobster - served with tempura onion, saut\u00e9ed bok choy and warmed miso butter for the lobster - this was pure heaven. Stupid delicious. I mean really, OMG. It was amazing. Can't say enough here and the filet was done just right. \n\nWe also ordered a tiger roll topped with habanero sauce to give it a little kick. Amazing. \n\nJason was our waiter, he was excellent. This was so far our best meal in Vegas and worth every penny!"

The sake choices were a bit over whelming but I had a good amount of it. Everything tasted find, and the menu choices were excellent.\n\nI would have given this a 5 star if it wasn't for the asshole of a waiter we had. I'm assuming it's because we decided to dress pretty down but he was acting like we couldn't afford shit at this place. A young couple dressed very casually, doesn't deserve the same treatment the table next to us was given apparently. Half way through the meal he had to go on break and then we got an amazing waiter, very helpful and attended to our needs. But that first guy left a pretty sour taste in my mouth for this place. I might try it again, solely for the food. Not the shitty attitudes."

It's located on the third floor of the Cosmo and we sat at the sushi bar.  The men behind the sushi bar were slightly awkward.  I give them efforts to try to entertain us and be social with us, but they'd interrupt our conversation at times.  :/\n\nCOSMOPOLITAN PLATTER: This was the Chef's daily sushi and sashimi for one.  There was uni in it and everything was fresh.  Presentation was also very nicely done.  My friend and I decided to share it because we weren't entirely hungry.  Even if I was eating the dish by myself I would totally still be hungry.  And it costs $85. \n\nOverall, this restaurant seems descent.  To me, I just think you're better off going elsewhere where you pay less and still get the same quality."

Luckily, Blue Ribbon offers good options for non-sushi diners. The chawan mushi (steamed egg custard) was amazingly delicate and well-done, although I couldn't taste the unagi. Seaweed salad is delicious and comes in a generous portion. The seasonal vegetable was bok choy, which was fresh and simply prepared.\n\nWe split the Blue Ribbon Platter (omakase) among 3 of us, which was the perfect amount. Surprisingly they didn't have super-white tuna (personal favorite) and sweet ebi (shrimp). Albacore was delicious, anago (baby eel) was incredible (topped with avocado), red snapper was surprisingly good. Yellowtail and salmon were decent. Blue Ribbon maki (lobster with black caviar) was decadent. Per my request, server had the chef include scallops (thinly sliced), which were beautifully presented in a jumbo clam. The platter was stunningly arranged.\n\nThe 40 oz. bone-in ribeye for 2 is available in 20 oz. portion, paired with a generous serving of bok choy (large enough to share) and onion tempura. Colleague seriously enjoyed the ribeye, which is pre-sliced and nicely presented.\n\nRestaurant was fairly dead at 7pm on a Wed. night, which was surprising.\n\nOverall, the experience was good but didn't find it warranted its pricing."

I give 4 stars.\n\nSome of the chefs aren't there yet,,, they are, to me, like these fakers who work for all you can eat sushi bar. The way they cut rolls is often terrible,,,. You don't wanna pay 25 bucks to get a roll when you can get all you can eat at the same price. I hope they hire better chefs.\n\nBeef tataki is terrific only if its fresh. Same for fish. I have eaten it several times and found out the consistency of the food quality is low. Sometimes it's good. Sometimes it's ok. This shouldnt happen at the place like this. \n\nLong story short, I say;\n\nGet sushi and sashimi. Period.\nThese westernized rolls are actually good, tho.\nSumeshi- sushi rice - is the best in town.\nBeef tataki is good, just ask the server if its really fresh or not.\n\n-Tempura isn't tempura. It's a fritter.\n-Chicken wings are good, but then you don't have to go to sushi place.\n-Shishito is plasticky... Is it from Mexico? It seems like they grew under the strong sunshine (this isn't good actually). Also, shishito is NOT that spicy. Maybe it's from red pepper farm...\n-Green Tea should be complimentary because that's what makes sushi taste better.(I understand its on the Strip, tho). No sushi bar in Japan charges tea. It's considered as rude. \n-If you sit at the bar, bartenders will let you sample beer from Japan. All of them are super good,,,, but only if you wanna spend 12 - 16 bucks for a glass of beer.\n-Sea eel, unagi, is too sweet,,, I hope they don't use that much sugar because quality of the eel itself is pretty good. \n-fried and not fried rice are ok. Again, this is sushi bar, not a Chinese restaurant\n. \n\nWell, this ain't short at all. Get sushi and sashimi. This ain't a japanese fusion restaurant."

Instead of ordering things I could get elsewhere I asked our server what he enjoyed.  He suggested the Oxtail Fried Rice and the Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken.  Interesting...\n\nI ordered what he suggested and it was awesome.  The fried chicken came with a wasabi honey sauce served on the side.  Really quite an interesting take on fusion cuisine.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes fried chicken as something new that has a really good chance of catching on.  The fried rice was something totally different altogether. On top of the fried rice was what could only be described as a thin egg omelet pouch filled with liquid bone marrow goodness.  As instructed I broke open the pouch and mixed it together with the fried rice and it was absolutely awesome!  While this is in NO WAY healthy it was really really TASTY.\n\nThe sushi was priced a bit high and I guess is what I expected from a sushi place on the strip.  They did have an interesting offering...a spicy lobster roll.  I ordered it and it was pretty good but probably not what people expect for a small roll that costs more than 10 bucks.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try different things.  I found the service to be attentive and helpful and would easily recommend it to anyone visiting the Cosmopolitan or Las Vegas in general.\n\nIf I could, I'd give the Oxtail Fried Rice a five star rating all by itself!"

I tried it anyway. \n\n       Spacious place, I called at 10:30 PM to see if they can get me in for 1, after my long business dinner, I didn't eat much because of negotiation. I was craving for some serious sushi rush.\n\n        I arrived, the hostess was graciously took good care of me, sat me down in the back sushi bar. \n\n- Blue Ribbon Daiginjo Sake - $80 bottle - was delicious.\n\n- Orion beer, Okinawa I love $17 ouch! \n\n- Yasei kino mushroom miso soup with miso paste on the side $8\n\n- Kanpachi Usuzuki $29 - a must order! \n\n- Hirame Usuzukuri is quite nice - thinly sliced $25\n\n- Seki Aji Sushi $9 - sushi serves 1 peace \n\n- Hokkaido Scallop - $29\n\n- Kindai otoro special $15 - sushi serves 1 peace \n\n- Kindai otoro special $17 - sushi serves 1 peace - quality of Otoro is extremely fresh. \n\n- Madai, Uni, Caviar $11  - sushi serves 1 peace - this was DELICIOUS combo!\n\n- Wagyu tongue was fattening good $21\n\n            I got to chat up with the sushi chefs, got to see their knife skill, was quite nice. At 11:30 PM, I was satisfied with my sushi crave. Service was good and sushi was fresh and delicious, \n\n           My friends were right, this dinner for 1 was pushing me over $350 after tax and tip, and I already had some light dinner earlier. If I was hungry, I can see my eating habit would push me over $400 by myself. Again, I don't expect the average person will order the food and the drink like my choices, but still it surely a pricey place. Think for what I would pay normally  for a 2 Michelin Star food in Vegas. The choice is yours."

It's found under the Fryer and Tempura section of the menu and is referred to as \"Blue Ribbon style\".\n\nAlthough the restaurant serves predominantly sushi, on my last 2 visits to Vegas, I made sure I dropped by for this unique dish. You get 3 large pieces of chicken that have the most amazing (non-greasy) crispy and tasty coating. Once you bite through the skin, you're met with an explosion of tender white juicy meat. You can dip the chicken in the Wasabi and honey sauce (it comes with) but I find the chicken stands very well on its own. Well, it doesn't literally stand on its own but you know what I mean. \n\nThe Cosmopolitan is worth a visit just for this treat alone. \n\nOh yes, the service is friendly and prompt, and, I love watching the sushi \"maker\" guys while I wait (and salivate) for my fried chicken!!!\n\nA half bottle of red wine and fried chicken. That's sinful, isn't it?"

But what purpose is good service if the food is not good? The food was plain, flavorless, and lacked flair or inspiration. There's nothing wrong with simple food if its done well, but this food was just poorly conceived. Almost like they don't even try to make good food because they know people will come either way because of the location. I've always been willing to pay top dollar for great sushi, but it was almost offensive to me that they would charge this much for this caliber of food. All 5 of us had different appetizers and different entrees, and not one of us felt our food was anything above subpar! We eventually figured out where the good reveiws came from when we realized that there were lots of drunk people eating there. I guess bland food and good food are all the same thing to a drunk person. If you plan to eat anywhere close to sober, don't go to this restaurant, you will be disappointed!"

            "review": "My meal and experience at Blue Ribbon featured the best sushi, sashimi and other Japanese fare that I have had yet! Six of us ventured to the restaurant with our friend and veteran sushi chef and through his connections, dishes were selected and brought to us strategically, rather than ordering off the menu.\n\nWe began with a couple plates of fresh, delicious, melt-in-your-mouth hamachi (yellowtail) sashimi dosed in a light soy sauce based dressing and topped with thin slices of jalape\u00f1o and perfectly seared ahi (tuna) in its own tantalizing sauce tossed with fresh scallions and mixed greens on the side.\n\nNext was the highlight of our night: The Blue Ribbon Special. A two-foot wooden platter decorated with carefully-carved fish skeletons and intricate cucumber designs was filled with an extravagant variety of specialty sashimi and rolls. This included raw uni (sea urchin) on a bed of lemon slices in its own casing, a pile of lightly marinated raw jellyfish, spicy crab rolls, roses made of wild tuna sashimi, madai (Japanese red snapper) sashimi and sake (salmon) sashimi, thin slices of sawara (Spanish mackerel) sashimi lined along its own skeleton, the Blue Ribbon special roll with 1/2 lobster, shiso and black caviar, the Dragon special roll with avocado, eel and radish sprouts, and finally, hirame (fluke) sashimi with its skeleton. Everything was extremely fresh, delicious and simply amazing.\n\nTo add to an already over-the-top meal, the chef brought us the Karai Ise Ebi roll (spicy lobster in an egg wrapper topped with black caviar) and Unagi (fresh water eel) nigiri. Then, Kobe beef tartare carefully topped with fresh scallions and egg yolk and their version of fried chicken that you dip in a tasty wasabi honey sauce. I finished the meal with a couple of the best spicy tuna, salmon and yellowtail hand rolls I've EVER had.\n\nTheir fresh and decadent desserts didn't disappoint either. Ginger bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and candied yuzu (amazing!!), green tea, azuki bean and mandarin orange mochi ice cream, and lastly, flourless chocolate cake with green tea ice cream (best tasting GT ice cream, hands down!).\n\nWhen it comes to freshness, creativity and attention to detail, Blue Ribbon is arguably the best sushi restaurant in town. The only \"con\" is certainly its price tag (our whole meal with a few drinks and a cold bottle of sake, sales tax and very generous gratuity was approximately $1,000 for six). If you're dining as a couple, the Blue Ribbon Special platter will be all you need for a satisfying meal and it could even stretch to comfortably feed four. That being said, it's a toss whether or not the food and dining experience is worth the cost, however, I would definitely love an encore."

I had resisted for a long period of time while living there (there were soooo many other local places to go) but once I did, I realized their food stacks up to the highest quality of venues in NY.\n\nGiven the price range of restaurants at the Cosmo, this falls in the higher end range.  Previously I've had more of their kitchen dishes, which were remarkable.  I was really impressed with this place, sadly, I saw the portion size of their Fried Chicken and could not bring myself to order it after the mounds of food I had already consumed.  And therefore the time had come to conquer the monster that was left for another battle!\n\nWe started off the meal with some Sushi- the Spicy Hamachi Roll and Unagi; just enough to feel like  we're in a Japanese restaurant (the main dish IS Fried Chicken after all...)  The Sushi is pretty solid, albeit the selection is standard fare, the Hamachi hit the spot and the sweet sauce on the Unagi is such a palate pleaser, it's hard to go wrong!\n\nThe Fried Chicken came out; four pieces of beautifully fried poultry covered deep in batter with crevices of crunchy craters that make eating fried chicken so much fun.  There was an adequate amount of spices, enough to compliment the protein without overpowering the entire dish."

Ok maybe I am channeling a prior bad blind date here but, thats the best comparison I can give. Vegas has a wave of sister venues from all over the world and the real trick is how getting them to stack up to the original and yet still retain an identity of their own. The Cosmopolitan hotel has a few of these places and most are trying to find their identity.\n\nI hit the place up on a weeknight and the place was busy with a dark but, warm environment, loud music (just a tad to loud actually I had to yell to chat with my dinner companion) and a casually dressed staff. Table wait time was about 15 minutes so I decided to hit the bar. The menu had an impressive selection and the bartenders were on top of their game.  The one comment I have is that the drinks seemed a little weak.  This is also where things got a little odd as when I checked the time (25 mins.) I had to walk up to the reception podium to check on my table time they said it was ready. I closed out my tab and the bartender commented \"Oh yeah its been ready for a while\". Seems like a really odd thing to not communicate!\n\nLooking over the menu their is a fun variety of higher end food options and my server made a variety of suggestions. The menu was definitely on the higher end of the price spectrum. I mean wasabi friend chicken shouldn't approach the $40 mark. But the variety of things I sampled (Toro, Wagyu Beef Fried Rice, and the Spicy Crab Roll) all tasted fine. But, I guess thats my point they weren't great. At this price point and with this pedigree it should be kinda awesome.\n\nNot to mention when I asked for the cocktail menu halfway through the meal to try something else it was never delivered. Frankly I decided to cut my losses and head somewhere else.\n\nI cant say I would really recommend this place to anyone off hand. I mean maybe if you were on a company expense account and needed to show off at the cosmo it would do. If I return here again I will head straight for the sushi bar and see if my experience changes. I have heard nothing but, great things about this venue's sibling in NY maybe I should just stick to the original."

Our waitress was friendly and gave helpful suggestions when we told her this was only our first stop for dinner.  We started with a bottle of fruity sake and amberjack sashimi. I have never had amberjack before, but it tasted fresh and sweet.  Next we had smoked pork belly with pickled onions and yuzu watercress.  They pork belly was fun dish.  Two large pieces came on a skewer with the onions and watercress on top.  The pickled onions provided a nice acidic bite to counter the richness of the pork belly.  \n\nFInally, we had the oxtail rice that many people have writtten about.  It was delicious!

This meal consisted of a sashimi set including a very nicely presented sashimi of an entire fish. There was also a sushi set and a sushi roll. The price was reasonable for the quantity of food and everything tasted very good but I was still a bit hungry and I ordered 6 more pieces of sushi. The price of 6 pieces of sushi was half of what the entire chef special was. I won't be taking any stars off for the price as I knew what it was going in but this is precisely the reason I chose to eat at cheaper sushi places with inconsistent fish quality over restaurants that seem to set their prices by rolling the dice. My real complaint was that when each of my courses were presented to me I wasn't told what fish I was getting. This is normally not an issue for me as I can recognize most of the fish that I eat. However, blue ribbon does have a large fish selection and so I had no idea what half the fish I ate were. This is an oversight by blue ribbon that should be corrected. I would come back here but would only order the omakase, regular $200 version or the smaller for half the price."

Waaaaay over priced for the portion size and quality of food\n\nWhen we first got there and got seated, the waiter asked if we wanted edamame or miso soup.. we thought that it was free cuz sushi places do that sometimes.. so we all said miso soup. When the soup came out, it wasn't even ready.. they gave you a bowl of hot water and tofu and the miso paste separately. We had to mix the paste into the hot water ourselves which I thought was kinda lame since it was supposed to be a fancier restaurant.\n\nLater when we got the bill, it was almost $200 (this was between 4 people)! We were all shocked cuz we didn't even order that much food. The miso soup was actually $7 each. It was totally not worth it. The food overall was alright. Honestly, nothing special at all. I've definitely had better... I'll never come back to this place, but if you must, I say get the ox tail fried rice cuz it was very different and pretty tasty, otherwise! Don't waste your money here."

Started with a seaweed salad, followed by two sushi rolls. Spicy tuna and salmon- spicier than most \"spicy\" rolls but none the less we loved them. \n\nMain entr\u00e9e- my husband had the short ribs that fell off the bone and I had oxtail fried rice with bone marrow. Both dishes came highly recommended from our server and he didn't disappoint. Typically, I would never order a dish with that kind of name but since we are on vacation celebrating our anniversary and baby moon- why not try! Perfect evening!"

Someone take it away please.\n\nThis is a review for Restaurant Week (2012).  Out of the five RW venues I've ate at this was the most disappointing.  The lobster bisque was good, it tasted fresh and had lobster in it.  This was something special they pulled out for RW, it's not normally served on the menu or otherwise as a special. \n\nThe spicy tuna roll was plain jane.  Mine looked like it was made by an inexperienced adult sushi-maker with one of those how to make a sushi roll kit you find at bookstores.  My chutoro wasn't oily like in some other restaurants.  I liked my hamachi though.\n\nThere were multiple choices for our main entree but out of the five people I came here with, we ALL ordered the famous fried chicken!  BAH!  Sure it was cooked and prepared correctly, moist and not dry, seasoned with extra seasoning scattered around the plate, complimented with a nice sweet sauce but was this it?  A single piece, and it tasted like it was cooked in almost overly used oil. \n\nThe dessert was delicious, I had the gingerbread pudding.  During the meal we had someone from Restaurant Week stop by our booth to say hi and thanked us.  Wish I got his name and what his position was but the totality of everything having to do with RW, this was not a bad showing for $30 and they were one of the higher donation donors out there.  I ordered some regular menu items as well which was impressive, I'll update the review with another visit on the regular menu items.\n\nThe Samurai Barley Ale was gooooooood.  But I do hope they continue to participate in Restaurant Week.."

Since we were early we saw all the prep work and truly the fish was as fresh as being in tokyo at the dish market! Some of the fish are farm raised in Japan and flown over. We saw live prawn still kicking around in a bowl. For food: sushi obviously amazing, everything melted in your mouth (according to hubby), spicy lobster roll (good choice for pregnant women), tofu and seaweed salad had awesome dressing, and we opted for the oxtail fried rice, and meatballs on skewers!

And they even brought out a birthday pastry and lit candle for the bachelorette (also the birthday girl) at the end of our meal.  \n\nWe were staying at the Cosmopolitan hotel during the weekend of the pool fire there and we got a $600 voucher between our 3 rooms, so we used the voucher to cover our meal here.  It did cover our meal but we weren't told until the next day when we were checking out that our voucher would not cover our tip, as we were led to believe.  No one at the restaurant told us otherwise. That was a bit deceptive.  \n\nThe food itself was so-so.  It was overpriced, came in very small portions, and was not the most fresh (considering how much it cost).  I've had better sushi elsewhere that hasn't been that overpriced. Maybe if I visited on date night with my fianc\u00e9 it would make more sense because we could order a sushi boat and be full. But split 13 ways, that meal did not make sense.  I shared my order with 2 other people - we ordered the Braised Short Rib (tasty and melted in your mouth but definitely too small of a portion), the Tuna Tataki  (definitely the highlight for me, but again too small a portion), and the Salmon appetizer (not the most fresh I've tasted).  Those 3 things came out to $90 and were hardly filling!  \n\nI would likely skip Blue Ribbon in the future.  I'm willing to dish out a pretty penny for good food, but only if I'm going to get my money's worth. I didn't feel like we did at Blue Ribbon."

For the sashimi it was pretty good not much to say however, the nigiri was different.  The fish was warm due to the very very good rice, not an optimal temperature but very close. The tuna had a nice flavor and kinda melted in your mouth, salmon had a fresh taste and provided a small sensation i cant quite describe but it was nice to have. I had fluke and yellowtail as well as 2 more fish i cannot recall but they were great as well.

We were excited to try Blue Ribbon Sushi and hopefully find a new spot. This is extremely important to my review. We had just come off a huge winning streak and were in amazing high spirits and just plain happy from winning. We walked in on time to our reservations and the place was dead, 2 people at the sushi bar and two reservations seated at tables. We asked if we could have a booth as the seating at the tables looked old. Immediately we were told absolutely not and were led to a small table. The chairs are old 60's style fabric covered front office reception chairs. Terribly low if you are over 6' and uncomfortable with the arm rests fabric mostly rubbed off. They placed us directly next to the other couple with no one in the restaurant. My girl asked where she could place her purse as there was no place to hang it on the fabric chairs. The waiter said she could place it behind her back on the chair or on the floor.  She held onto it in her lap. The waiter's attitude to us was atrocious. Rude as if we were bothering him by eating there. Our joy from winning quickly faded. We ordered our drinks, garlic Edamame and some entr\u00e9e rolls and sashimi. As no one was at the restaurant, we got our sushi rolls and sashimi in less than 4 minutes. No complaints on the food, but it wasn't great either. If you have unpleasant seating and a rude waiter but the food is truly amazing you can always look past these items. I ordered a couple of $30 specialty items to see if they were good. When I asked if we could get our garlic Edamame the waiter told me I never ordered any. At this point we've spent over $140 and have only upset him by being in the restaurant for 20 minutes. Instead of bringing Edamame ordered twice he comes back and asks if we wanted any dessert?!?!?! One other couple came in and were also seated in the center table section.  Lost our happiness of winning briefly until we could get out of this place. We paid and ate regular sushi nothing special here and were rushed to eat and leave in less 30 minutes.  Never got the Edamame.  Our mistake to try this place, we will be sure to go back to barMasa and Sushi Roku were waiters have class and poise for clients paying $150-$300 and looking for a nice relaxing evening with great drinks and excellent sushi."

The service was nearly non-existent, and we almost had to tackle the waiters to get the check or even to place an order.\n\nDisclaimer: I live in Hawaii. We have the highest quality of seafood on the planet. Our sushi bars are some of the best in the country. We eat well and have high expectations of our seafood.\n\nIf I lived in Kansas or Iowa and came to Blue Ribbon, I might be fooled into thinking that I was eating high-quality sushi based on the high-prices on the menu. After all, what standard would I have to measure Blue Ribbon Sushi against?\n\nBOOM! This restaurant just got nailed. The high-priced sushi served here is mediocre AT BEST when compared to what I've eaten for cheaper here at home. The fact that they had the nerve to pass this crap to us and then charge us so much is unacceptable, plain and simple.\n\nHere's what was ordered:\n\n2x Chu-Toro Nigiri\n1 Spicy Tuna roll w/ Tempura Flakes & Cucumber\n1 Blue Ribbon  w/ 1/2 Lobster, Shiso leaf & Black Caviar\n1 YellowFin Ahi Collar\n\nFOOD QUALITY - STRIKE 1\nChu-Toro is the 2nd highest quality of Bluefin Ahi out there. It should be fatty and full of flavor. The Chu-Toro that we received had  very little fat or flavor. It was almost as if it was previously frozen and later defrosted. The chefs should be ashamed to have served that crap to us at those prices!\n\nFOOD QUALITY - STRIKE 2\nThe \"Blue Ribbon\" roll had thick pieces of lobster and shiso leaves stuffed in the middle of the roll. Topped with small amounts of Black Caviar. This was $29 for 8+ pieces. There was no flavor from the lobster and it was tough to chew. Also, when I eat caviar, there's some briny flavor (saltiness?) that's always present. This caviar had very little flavor at all. $29 for this?\n\nFOOD QUALITY - STRIKE 3\nYellowfin Ahi Collar was served from the broiler but wasn't that flavorful. The GF said it was \"OK but not spectacular\" and I thought she was being generous. Let's just say that it wasn't horrible but the flavor left a lot to be desired.\n\nFOOD QUALITY - Consolation Prize\nBelieve it or not, the spicy tuna roll was not bad. Spicy Tuna is usually considered garbage in higher end sushi establishments (I have been snootily told \"We don't serve that here...\" in one forgettable sushi bar). But the $14 Spicy Tuna & Tempura Flakes roll wasn't bad. In fact, I was surprised that it had more flavor than the flagship \"Blue Ribbon\" roll which was twice as expensive. This was the only thing that saved them from a 1 star for food quality.\n\n---\n\nSERVICE - Service was tough, and it really took effort to get someone to take your order. If I'm looking around the room with an empty table in front of me, wouldn't you want to see if I needed to order something? 15 minutes of wait staff walking past our table before I waved one down? Would someone PLEASE pass this on the wait staff at BR? Have them go down the way to Jaleo to see how a very attentive wait staff operates.\n\n---\n\nAMBIANCE - Lots of wood in their decor, and I liked it. What I didn't like was the LOUD POUNDING TECHNO that made conversation impossible... and we had just been to a concert earlier. The GF and I sat across each other and were no farther than 3 feet apart, yet we couldn't hear each other.\n\nTrue story - Since we were staying at the Cosmopolitan (where BR is located), I yelled this to the GF over the pounding music:\n\n\"How about we try the Hot Tub after?\"\n\nThis is what she heard over the music:\n\n\"Where can a guy take a dump at?\"\n\nNeedless to say, I was relieved that this wasn't a first date. After the GF stopped laughing, I asked for the check... but nearly had to tackle a waiter to ask for it.\n\n---\n\nSummary:\n\nYou cannot serve poor quality fish at premium prices just because you're on the Las Vegas Strip. This is ridiculous, arrogant, and you'll look foolish if someone can get fantastic stuff at home.\n\nThe BR owners need to be schooled by Chef Wong of Sushi ii on what excellent quality is. What we were served was unacceptable to cats.\n\nIf the service was acceptable, I'd rate them higher... but they weren't. Tough.\n\nIf the ambiance was lovely, I still wouldn't change a thing BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DAMN FOOD. It's nice to know that my GF was amused during dinner, however.\n\nI would ask for my money back but I'd be too ashamed to do so. Apparently, this restaurant has no such embarrassment when handing this food out to customers.\n\nIf you reviewed this place with a high rating, I'm convinced you have no idea what good sushi is. Don't reward such a unacceptable restaurant when other worthy restaurants struggle for survival."

The wine pours were very small and expensive.  The portions were small and just not as exciting as they sounded on the menu.  \n       Maybe I've become a sushi snob or maybe I'm just past traditional sushi......I think Sushi Samba at The Palazo may have ruined my expectations for fantastic unique sushi.....I compare everything to Sushi Samba ...and Nobu.  \n       If you want straight forward sushi and don't want to travel go ahead and go to Blue Ribbon...it was not bad, just normal.  If you want great traditional sushi, go to Nobu at Hard Rock.  If you want unique and creative, go to Sushi Samba."

Initially I was pretty excited for sushi because the first choice was a steakhouse and not being a big steak eater and because we would be going to a club afterwards I didn't want to go smelling like meat. \n\nWhen we first stepped in everyone greeted us and led us to the table our party was waiting for us at.  Service wasn't terrible because they were rude or had an attitude, nothing of that sort... but it was bad because of the cluelessness of our waitress and lack of professionalism...or I guess the lack of experience.  Before the dinner my friend dropped off the ice cream cake she bought for her sister to be stored in the freezer and brought out as a surprise at the end of the meal.  Well, when the birthday girl walked into the restaurant the hostess asked her if she'd like to have the cake...the SURPRISE bday cake to be brought out.  When the birthday girl's bf alerted them that she was the birthday girl all they did was say \"Oh.\" and walked away.  Wtfudge?\n\nPlanning to preparty back at the suite after dinner we were on somewhat of a time crunch.  After ordering our food we waited for 45 minutes for any food to be brought out to us as we sipped on water for the rest of the time. JH ordered a seaweed salad to be shared with me, for $10 that was the dinkiest salad I ever saw.  As far as the taste...it tasted like the Korean seaweed ban chan (side dish) that you get with your meal at Korean restaurants or the deli section of the Korean market.  Some said it tasted like dim sum.  \n\nJH and I shared an order of the spicy crab roll, spicy tuna roll, and wagyu beef tataki, of course after waiting an additional 30 minutes after finishing the tiny salad.  \n\nAs far as the rolls go, I have to say I've had more flavorful, fresh tasting rolls from Trader Joe's cold food section.  Really for the prices they charged I expected something more than just bleeeh.  As for  the beef tataki, well even though JH ordered it for us to share I chose not to eat it because of the fact that they gave him the most tiniest 5 slices of beef I've ever seen at $28 for the appetizer.  A slice of deli ham equates to more than what they gave him.  \n\nSome of the people ordered the fried chicken which they commented as being not worth it even though the server recommended it as being her favorite dish.  Apparently Popeye's has better chicken.  \n\nI got a chance to try some of the sushi that came with BB's sushi deluxe dinner... not the freshest I've had.  And for what they charge they should at least bring out a soup or salad with the plate.  \n\nAt the end as our waitress was clearing up the table she continued to drop utensils on the floor, on the table on my friends...and she did everything so slowly.. talk slowly, moved slowly... we had a sloth for a waitress.  When we wanted to have the cake brought out our waitress along with some other staff members came into our area asking random people who the birthday girl was and if the cake should be brought out.  Really?  Way to be incognito!  After the cake was finally brought out to our disappointment we realized they had not stored the cake in the proper facility as the ice cream was melted and seeping from the bottom and the icing had melted off the cake.. misshaping the cake entirely.  \n\nWhen the bill finally came out which totaled to over $620 we realized that without informing anyone there was a cake storing and cutting fee.  I mean it would have been fine if we had been informed in the beginning, but we weren't, not to forget that they brought out a melted ice cream cake... fuck that.  \n\nWe were able to get the cake cutting fee waived and the automatic 20% gratuity reduced as no one who served us deserved a 20% tip.  \n\nI would never come back here again."

Kanpachi Amberjack is delicious, light but still flavorful. Green Tea Creme Brulee is ok. Not too impressed. \n\nService was not bad. Our waiter was a bit clueless about the items on the menu. Other than that overall experience is not bad. Nice environment. We were sitting outside. Noticed that inside the restaurant was very dark so we sit outside. There is a secret pizza spot right next to it so you might get a bit traffic there. But overall it's not bad."

Both plates beautiful and taste fantastic.  I used to hate octopus, no more!  Having tried the wings at the Los Angeles Blue Ribbon I knew what to expect. Excellent!  If your not a fish lover you have to try it.  The 8 wings for about $20 will fill you up if your on a budget and make a believer out of you.  We also tried a $14 chef special that consisted of smoe small pork ribs with some type of glaze that was to die for on top of a slaw that was over the top.  \n\nWe had tonic water and lime wich matched our meal perfectly.  Not sure what brand they use but it taste better than other places for some reason.  I have been reading about the bread pudding so we had to try it with a cup of coffee.  Made fresh to order with olive bread and a scoop of I think green tea ice cream.  The coffee is really good and the dessert was every bit as good as yelpers said.  The Mrs and I almost went to fisticuffs over the last bite. \n\nI saw at least four sushi chefs at two sushi stations and at 3 hostesses.  We met the head chef Fernando while visiting Los Angeles who came to help with the opening.  Highly skilled and the plating is nothing short of art work for the hot dishes and sushi alike.    The service is impeccable and you can tell they hire the right people here to make your visit an expierence you wont forget.  \n\nThe ambiance  and design is most impressive, a bit dark although my  eyes adjusted fine after sitting for a while.  The architect who designed this place should be featured in a magazine.  Our waitress Allison teamed with a manager named Greg both served us and others pitched in.  The service is fantastic.  Both have worked in New York at Blue Rigbon and have been with the resturant at least five years.  After our meal I promised I would write a great review.  Well deserved. \n\nAs a small business owner I noticed  something special about the Blue Ribbon Sushi organizational management I think other establishments can learn from.  If I owned or managegaed a resturant, I would make several visits, observe, ask a lot of questions and take notes.  Fabulous expierence!"

I went there this weekend for a birthday dinner with two other girls (quite a small group, especially for Vegas). Made a reservation for 9:30. Waited for forty-five minutes to be seated. Got seated at a weird boothy table that was way too big for three people and was positioned directly under what can only be described as an arctic chill blasting from a vent above us. Ordered the salmon tartare, spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, and a spicy crab roll. I'm not a sushi chef, but I can't imagine it takes that long to make that - yet it took almost a hour. The portions were TINY and way overpriced. The real cherry on top was our waitress, who was pretty much MIA the whole night, but decided to pop in after we ate and tell me that my friends had ordered a dessert for me ahead of time for my birthday. Thanks galpal! Maybe they have a different definition for surprise over at Blue Ribbon. The only redeeming thing was the dessert itself - the most rich, perfectly decadent without over doing it, melt in your mouth chocolate cake. Noms. \nMoral of the story: if you want to pay ridiculous amounts of money to eat tiny pieces of raw fish and get poor service, Blue Ribbon is for you! Seriously though, just go get that dessert."

Not the best that I've ever had but nothing that would keep me away.  The price however is a little ridiculous.  The rolls are right at $20 and there are only 6 to 7 pieces.   If you want sashimi, the salmon was $5.50 per piece.  And the pieces are really on the thin side.  I would expect for the money that you spend to get a little better value.\n\nGreat place if you are on and expense account or don't have to worry about money."

My friends and I decided to try out the restaurant for Thanksgiving weekend. We ordered our food at around 11:20pm got most of our orders 20-30 mins later. My gf and I waited for almost an hour and a half for our order. At an hour of wait, we had put in a complaint to cancel our order due to the long wait. The waiter reassured us the order was already ready to be served. Twenty minutes later, we were still waiting for our meal. After three complaints to the server, I was so upset that I asked for the manager. It wasn't until 10 minutes when the manager finally ponder over to our table. The first words he said were: \" Everyone having a good time? How's the meal tonight?\" Okay...obviously he already knows about the situation and was trying to test the water. I explained to him why we were so upset, he apologized then immediately walks off. About 20 minutes later, he comes back and announces that the late orders were on the house. To be honest, I had expected high quality service from a restaurant like this. The attitude we had to experience from the server and manager were beyond my disappointment. We should have received an immediate apology not only from the horrible service but also for the horrible wait and overall experience. This restaurant does not deserve a 5 stars even with the good food. I would highly recommend anyone who wants to have an enjoyable time in vegas to go somewhere else. Our bill came out to be around $600 bucks. The food was acceptable but not worth the price.\n\nWe ordered: \n\nDragon roll: Just like any other dragon roll..nothing special\nMiso Soup ( regular and mushroom): $7-8 Not worth it either..the soup came w/ the paste outside..you had to add it in yourself. The soup isn't warm after mixing the paste in. \n$150 Plate of sushi: Really good exotic fish but I've had better. \nSteak : Too hard..I would recommend getting steak at a steak house like Joe's seafood. \nBaked Tuna: wasn't too great. The tuna came out a little hard. \nThat was all I could remember from the  night."

It is perfect for people from Iowa or North Dakota who don't know what real sushi is supposed to be, and feel ok about dropping major coin on a meal that is unremarkable, just because they're in las vegas. \n\nFew things to note:\nApparently this is a bistro/sushi hybrid (they are two separate restaurants in NYC, which is necessary because clearly it is too much for them to handle). When asked what the sushi of the day selection was, we were told \"yellowtail, spicy tuna.\" um, what?\n\nBone marrow was good. But that's also hard to mess up.\n\nFried chicken was under seasoned and was so over-breaded that it was inedible. \n\nOur waitress was also rude (like we were doing her a favor by going to the restaurant), and when i ordered a dirty martini, they gave me one olive. When i kindly asked for \"a few more olives\" they did give me 3... and when we got the bill we realized we were charged a $1 an olive.

At least you know you're getting screwed with the price and the food is probably better than what came out of Blue Ribbon's kitchen."

I'm used to just getting individual plates, like a tasting menu.  But here they make a huge platter of sashimi.  We got them to split the platter three ways between us, which was good.  Otherwise it would have been interesting to navigate the platter at the sushi bar.  If you look at the pictures, the platter is pretty intricate and doesn't look entirely stable.\n\nThe sashimi platter comes with Aji and the actual fish bones and head that the Aji sashimi was made from.  Once you are done, they take that back and fry it and serve it to you.  It was pretty good.  I've had better at other restaurants.  It usually works better when the fish is smaller.  This fish was pretty big.\n\nAfter that, they bring out one huge platter of nigiri, which I wasn't expecting.  One or two pieces for each diner.  And it includes toro, which is the best toro I've ever had.  The shrimp nigiri was really fresh - you can see the shrimp behind the counter alive and kicking it.  The wasabi is pretty fresh, but not as fresh as Bar Masa.  Still, pretty good.  With three people at the sushi bar, you have to push the platter around so everyone can reach everything.  \n\nThe cocktails were pretty good.  I had an Off the Road, which is a tequila cocktail.  My husband had the White Oak, which he enjoyed as well.  And this is the only place on the west coast that has Hitachino beer on tap.  It's a nice IPA style beer.  A little expensive at $15 a pint, but still pretty good.\n\nThe dessert list was a little lacking (and expensive) so we ended up going to Holsteins for shakes.  \n\nService was good and the omakase is impressive, visually and taste wise.  I'll give it 4 stars because it's a little expensive at $100 a person and, according to the menu, they could charge more if they give you something really special on a whim.  I think you can still get omakase at Sen of Japan for $85/person.  But definitely something to try at least once.  Tony has better pictures than I do, so hopefully he will post them.  Some of the platters other people got in the restaurant who were doing omakase for 6 were pretty insane and he got pics of that."

We were so excited to see them at Vegas last week, but ended up much of disappointment.  We had a salad and several appetizers including Oxtail oden and Iberico hirekatsu.  All were terrible and overpriced.  And finished with Fried chicken. Chicken was very dry and was basically a bad fried chicken covered with togarashi (Japanese red pepper), The menu listed as if it were something authentic but nothing authentic about it. The only decent dish that we had was a sushi roll. Maybe we should have stick with sushi and sashimi. We normally order bunch of appetizers and move on to sushi (unless we are at sushi bar), but by the time we had several bad appetizers, we were ready to leave as soon as possible. As a Japanese native, it is sad to see a Japanese restaurant like this.  Best of luck for surviving in Vegas!"

The rice, very sticky, over seasoned and poorly handled, misshapen and sticking to the hands of the chef.\n\nIn all other areas, ultra high quality ingredients, controlled creativity, a respectful nod to Japanese culinary traditions equals outstanding dishes.\n\nOrder family style and in courses.\n\nThe beef marrow with teriyaki sauce and bonito flakes served with a simple piece of toast is mind blowing.  Rich, unctuous, the roasted marrow perfectly carries the teriyaki sauce as it coats the palate with comforting flavors.  The \"Blue Ribbon\" style fried chicken, very good.  A crisp coating surrounds a juicy, wasabi and honey seasoned morsels of chicken.  Add some togarashi powder for the perfect spice kick.\n\nVery creative fried rice.  The standouts; braised oxtail, bone marrow, fresh shitake, and crispy daikon (great blend of flavors coddled in the melting fat of the marrow) and the king crab, shaved truffle and egg (a flavor explosion with sweet crab and umame from the truffles).\n\nReady to splurge?  How about A4 Wagyu from Kagoshima Japan. The real deal.  Three exceptional preparations.  (1) Seared as thin cut sashimi served with either ponzu or sea salt (the barely warmed surface releases fat that mixes so well with the ponzu increasing it's sweetness).  (2) Seared with miso butter (the fermented back taste of the miso sets off all kind of flavors in the beef), (3) Grilled New York steak (4oz / 8oz - $104 / $198 simple and good eats).\n\nRaw seafood is the best of he best.  The chu toro tartare with bits of scallion mixed with light soy and sesame oil topped with quail egg is a real treat.  Mix it all up for the best flavor.  The sashimi plates of kampachi dressed with yuzu pepper and hamachi with jalape\u00f1o and ponzu are both very good.\n\nVery good selection of sake.  Excellent service.

Starting off the service was pretty slow and disjointed, our server probably had 8 tables to himself. In a restaurant where the average spend is about 75-100/head I would expect service to be a lot more fluid and competent. We waited about 15mins to place our order and at that point I believe one of the owners/managers came over to take our order. For four people we had 2 filet mingons, 1 salmon, 1 fried chicken, 1 coconut shrimp a sashimi platter, lobster roll and two pieces of nigiri sushi. \n\nFirst off the sushi was beyond mediocre, I paid $15 for 1 piece of toro and the fact that the rice was crusty basically ruined it for me. I also had one piece of maguro which was pretty average as well.  The fabled fried chicken, one of their specialties that people tend to rave about fell short. Its basically shake and bake chicken with chili powder. The coconut shrimp were good, steaks were great and salmon was about average. While the portions looked decent I was surprised that after 5 entrees 2 appetizers and four deserts we were left starving.\n\nI wanted to save the best for last, the desserts were nothing short of phenomenal. Banana Split and sorbet were solid 7/10 but the green tea creme brulee was easily a 11/10 and the flourless chocolate cake was basically like eating an oversized truffle, absolutely amazing. \n\nDinner for 4 was about $350 mostly due to the fact that we only drank water. I would not recommend the restaurant and can't really see myself coming back when Japanese spots like Little Buddah exist on the high end and Xtreme Sushi on the low end. Average experience overall"

Any restaurant in such an uber cool hotel was sure to be equally amazing (it also didn't hurt that one of our friends, Brandon, is a manager there).\n\nStepping foot into the restaurant didn't disappoint. Sleek & trendy, the restaurant has just the kind of vibe one would expect from a swanky Las Vegas dining establishment.\n\nBut what about the food, you ask? Oh, the food...*swoon*.\n-Beef marrow: There's no way in hell I would've ordered this appetizer on my own but a friend of ours who visited the Blue Ribbon in New York swore by it. Our manager friend, Brandon, likened it to the \"foie gras of peanut butter & jelly\" & he couldn't have described it any better. Served with toast points, rich & buttery, with the sea salt, bonito & teriyaki sauce adding just the right amount of saltiness to cut through the fat. \n-Fried Chicken \"Blue Ribbon Style\": Another dish recommended by our friend, provided another foodie home run. The skin on the chicken was perfectly crisp & seasoned; I could've eaten it on its own. I also enjoyed the wasabi & honey sauce because I love the combination of sweet & savory; if this isn't for you, the plate is also lined with shichimi, a Japanese chili pepper spice mixture, for you to dip your chicken in.\n-Crab truffle fried rice: I didn't order this dish but I was lucky enough to snag a serving from someone else's bowl. After taking my first bite I really regretted not noticing it on the menu. It was ahh-mazing. Not only full of truffle flavor, it even had truffle shavings. The next time I make it back to Blue Ribbon you better believe I'm ordering this.\n-Blue Ribbon Special Platter: Yes, this sushi platter will set you back $200 but it's more than worth it. The wooden slab it was served on was chock full of every piece of nigiri or roll sushi you could think of, along with sashimi from a whole tai (snapper). The presentation was stunning & beautiful. My husband ordered this to share with my father-in-law, but there was more than enough to go around to the rest of us.\n-Ginger bread pudding: Brandon provided our table with complimentary desserts, being that 3 people in our party were celebrating recent birthdays. Although I'm not a fan of either ginger or bread pudding, this dessert blew me away! It was simply delish & I've been having cravings for it ever since. \n\nThe service at Blue Ribbon was wonderful & left nothing to be desired. We had a very large party (18 of us, I believe) & everyone left satisfied & pleased with their meal.\n\nFinally, no Las Vegas dining experience would be complete without a celeb sighting. We were lucky enough to dine a table away from Rex Lee (Lloyd from HBO's Entourage). It was all I could do to refrain from yelling \"LLOOOYYYDDD!!!\" in an Ari-esque roar (Entourage fans, you know what I'm talking about). Love him!"

The experience alone is something that can't be quantify in dollars, especially if you are a foodie and enjoy seeing food prepared artistically, as well as enjoying the delicious edible works of art.\n\nThe starting price for omakase here is $100, and can go up from there.  Seeing the results of the $300 omakse platter as we were exiting the restaurant, kind of reminds me of the feeling of watching the Food Network Challenges (I would love to be one of the tasting judges if they ever do an extreme sushi challenge).  And in my opinion is an interesting and extravagant way of splitting a meal with friends or impressing potential clients.  After the meal, you will definitely have something to talk about.\n\nThe sushi here is good. Granted all the fish is trucked or flown in to the restaurant, just like for any other sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. But thus far the volume of customers that seemed to be served every time I walk past Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill (BRSBG) is pretty high, so the inventory of fish must be pretty fresh. The rolls here are good too, even though you will be paying a premium for it.  \n\nThe sushi chefs here are not too talkative.  But we also didn't buy them sakes or beers, so that might have been a contributing factor. But they are skillful bunch and what they served up reminds me of the sushi I used to eat when I was much younger (presentation is still very much an important component of the food served).\n\nOur servers were good.  As the food was served, they identify them so you don't have to guess what they are (especially since we really have no idea what is going to be served with the omakase order).\n\nDesserts is probably the only uninteresting part of the meal, as the selection was uninteresting and expensive (I'd rather walk to Bellagio or Aria and get some Jean Philippe Patisserie pastries or dessert crepes, and still pay less).\n\nI posted the pictures I took from the dinner, so if you want to get an idea of what you might expect from ordering the $100 omakase, please check them out.\n\nDecor: 4/5 Very nicely decorated.\nPrice: 3/5  Expensive, but you do get what you pay for.  Can't really compare the price to AYCE sushi restaurants.\nFood:  4/5  Very good.  The uni and the amaebi are both very fresh (the shrimp was still swimming moments before it was plucked from the tank, prepped and served. \nService:  4/5  Fine dining style of service.\nParking:  3/5  Cosmopolitan is getting busier every time I go,so finding a good parking space seems to be harder and harder.  But there is always the valet option.\nLocation:  5/5  Right on the Strip.  Perfect for tourists and locals having a fabulous night out on the Strip.\n\nOverall, a solid 4 stars from me."

They had a lot of great appetizers and grilled entrees, besides sushi and sashimi.  They have two counters of sushi chefs in the middle of each room of the restaurant.  You can actually sit at the counter or at regular tables.  We choose a regular table.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and offered suggestions when we had questions.  Since I am doing a no carb diet, I am not eating rice.  I ended up having a wonderful grilled scallop dish.  It normally comes with rice but they put a really tasty veggie mix with it instead.  Really good.  My colleagues had a mix of different sushi and sashimi.  Everyone seemed to like their dishes.  We did start with the black cod in miso appetizer.  It was yummy.  \n\nI definitely will be back here.  It was tasty and we had good service."

I love to sit at the bar and watch the chefs work. After a short wait, our waitress came over, handed us a menu and served us our water. \n\nThe restaurant decor is very \"woodsy\" with dark wooden sculptures of waves running down the walls. A larger chefs table sits just inside the restaurant on the far side of the bar and past this opens to the full restaurant. I found, like with many of the restaurants on this floor at the Cosmo, that the ambiance and the noise are at odds with each other. The music is turned up way too loud, making is hard to have a conversation. \n\nAfter sometime our waitress returned and we ordered a Samurai beer (the name eludes me right now) and the Kanpachi Usuzukuri (Amberjack w/yuzu pepper) and the Beef Marrow, both were spectacular. I found the usuzukuri to be far superior to the one I had at Nobu here in LV and the beef marrow was perfectly seasoned with little challah toasts that held the marrow without becoming soggy. My only issue with the bone marrow is I wished that they had a proper spoon for it, the one they served it with was much too large and made it difficult to extract the yummy goodness, but that's what fingers are made for, right?\n\nWe also ordered several sushi, including a the Blue Ribbon roll, the KANI SUNOMONO,  ENOKI & HAMACHI and of course, some uni (because I can't resist uni). I have to say, apart from the uni, I wasn't very impressed. The rolls were unevenly filled, different sizes and just not all that appealing. Not exactly what I would expect as the rolls don't come cheap. \n\nOverall, I liked the appetizers, but I wouldn't come back here for sushi. I think the next time we're at the Cosmopolitan, we might try it again, but stick to their late-night menu,"

I tried a number of rolls and sashimi that I never had before, so I can't speak to making a comparison between this place and others on the Strip, but overall it was one of the better dining experiences I've had. The service was fantastic, and everything I had was presented well, tasted very fresh, and had a satisfying combination of flavors. Tha kaka fry roll and the ebi shumai (shrimp dumplings) stood out for me.  This place is undoubtedly pricey, so it helped that I was on a business account, but otherwise could be a great place for a special occasion."

We both ordered sushi and for the most part is was just meh/okay. I ordered the 3 rolls - Spicy scallop, Sakana San Shu and also the spicy tuna - none of them were that memorable. My friend also ordered a few roles and also an eel and avocado hand-roll which he took one bite of and never touched it again. He said the eel didn't taste right - he thinks that it was the result of them using eel that had been frozen.\n\nI should note that my friend is an avid sushi eater - he lives in L.A. and has experienced some of the best places in LA. I have never seen him put anything down like he did to that hand roll. That was a bit disappointing to me... since I chose this place to eat dinner.\n\nNeither of us had a moment or expressed that \"Yum this is good!\" - kind of thing\n\nIn terms of the ambiance - the place is pretty nice, kind of quiet with low sitting comfortable chairs. They have a real nice bar and the bartenders were pretty cool.\n\nThe service is really good, our waitress was really nice and attentive. but unfortunately the sushi kind of brings the whole place down a bit.\n\nMy Recommendation - Come here if you just want to eat an appetizer/roll and have a drink. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't think I would come back here again when I am in Las Vegas... I really wished this was better."

That being said, it is tasty and a great option if you're staying at the Cosmo. \n\nTheir specialty is actually fried chicken. We ordered this as an appetizer (which was quite upsetting to our waiter.. apparently we messed with the rules and should have eaten this last). I don't like wasabi, so I couldn't enjoy the wasabi honey they give you to pour over it, but I still very much appreciated this well executed perfectly crisp fried chicken. The most expensive fried chicken I've ever eaten.. not sure it was the \"best\", but definitely worth getting if you're a fried chicken person. \n\nThe other highlight for me was the crab and truffle fried rice.. YUM. I also enjoyed the blue crab california roll, although it was allegedly \"inside out\", but was not in fact \"inside out\", so the sushi brat side of me was a bit disappointed by this. \n\nWe were with a big group at a business dinner and ended up trying ever dessert on the menu. WOW for a sushi spot, they had killer desserts!\n\nI will have to go back and try some sashimi to give this place a more fair review.. in the meantime Nobu remains my favorite spot for high dollar sushi, but the varied menu here is sure to please sushi fans and the sushi-phobic alike. A nice option if you are staying in City Center or with a group that wants a variety."

We were staying at the Cosmo, and we wanted to start out on a high note for what was to be a week of incredible eating. \n\nBlue Ribbon ended up being the low point of all of our meals. Yes, we got a free dessert for being on our honeymoon (a nice touch, but a common one as we learned throughout the week), but aside from a couple real highlights (the live scallop served in it's shell, the uni wrapped in snapper and topped with shisho & caviar), everything else didn't really wow us and at a place like this, it should have. It wasn't bad or anything, but it definitely wasn't worth the $320 we dropped (we have no issue with dropping $$$$ on sushi when it's worth it). Good quality, but not jaw-dropping, and definitely not on the level of other restaurants at the Cosmo (I'm looking at you, Scarpetta). \n\nWe were considering going all out for the omakase there, but the server really didn't try to sell us on it at all. \"Oh, you know, it comes with tuna, salmon... toro, that kind of stuff.\" Really?  That's the best way you can describe the expensive omakase to me?  No highlighting of special fish, unique choices, anything like that?  Thanks, but no thanks.\n\nLuckily all of our other experiences at the Cosmo only went up from here. Next time we're in Vegas, we'll make sure to venture out to Raku, which apparently is *the* spot for locals when it comes to Japanese food."

We also had edamame and roasted shishito peppers, in addition to a bottle of sake and a cocktail.  The drinks were very good and reasonably priced. I will definitely be back for that sashimi!\n\nThe service was FANTASTIC! Our concierge was very considerate when making the reservation, and communicated to the restaurant that it was a birthday.

We got two chef's choice platters with the best sushi and sashimi they had and it was just OK. \n\nWhere they hit it out of the park was with their bone marrow, wagyu beef with truffled salt and shiitake mushrooms and fried chicken; all were excellent. The next time I'm in Vegas I will specifically go back for them. Based on the positive reviews of other users and the good reputation Blue Ribbon restaurants have around the country, though, I'll try their sushi and sashimi again. It's possible that I just got them on a bad day."

It was my classmate's 21 birthday and she wanted to have dinner at this restaurant because it was close to club marquee and we love sushi. This place was SH*T. The prices were too EXTREME for the small baby portions. I ate at so many sushi restaurants, by far this is the worst place I ever had sushi. They had the smallest California roll I ever had. Not only was the food horrible, but the service was ridiculous. I have no idea why they would take soooo damn long to serve these tiny sushi rolls. 20 minutes to come in and ask what we wanted, a whopping 45 minutes to serve us this baby sh*t and 1 HOUR to give us a check. Us being a huge party you would assume they would split the checks, but instead they would make it complicated and give us one whole check and go figure. It took a while to call the waiter and ask to split the check and the waiter says \"Okay its going to take another 20minutes because I need to void this one and so and so.\" We told the waiter, us being  a big party and all, why didn't you just split the check in the first place? He had the audacity to say \"Umm well okay...\" no apology. Overall there goes $100 down the drain, a waste of 3 hours in this restaurant (Waiting most of the time), and horrible service. \nDREADFUL, HORRIBLE, SH*TTY, WASTE OF TIME, B.S. RESTAURANT. NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN. \nIF YOU WANT GOOD SUSHI AND YOU CAN'T FLY TO THIS RESTAURANT I KNOW IN JAPAN, GO TO \"EXTREME SUSHI\" HERE IN LAS VEGAS WHICH IS ALL YOU CAN EAT, AND UNIQUE LARGE PORTIONS SUSHI."

We paired it with some warm sake, though I don't remember which and some beer of which I also don't remember. It's Vegas, so that explains that. \n\nAnyway, loved it here!

I also liked the sweet and spicy dipping sauce it comes with.

I've been going to both places there for years and every time I go home to visit it's a must-do on my list. I am beyond obsessed with the green tea creme brulee. It is by far my favorite dessert of all time and no other dessert has ever come close. \n\nUnfortunately, when we went to Blue Ribbon in Las Vegas I was so disappointed! The creme brulee was horrible. The sugar on top was way too thick and crunchy and the actual custard below was curdling because it had been overcooked. It didn't have that smooth creamy texture to it like it always does at the NY location. I was so bummed. In all honesty, I was looking forward my little bowl of heaven in the city of sin  :( \n\nI really hope this was a one-time thing, but if not I guess I'll have to wait till I go back home each time.

Again the pricing here is as if your eating at a 5 star restaurant based of it name etc. The price in this case does not reflect on the food. Don't get me wrong the quality of the sushi was clearly great but at the same time the blandness of the dishes with the price made this an instant dislike...the rainbow roll was fresh but again a dish that could easily be forgotten, same with the miso soup- totally bland!\n\nThe recommendations on dishes were saddening. If the people that work here can't suggest a good dish then that's a sign it's a reflection on the food. The suggested tuna appetizer was Boring with a capital B! The special \"fried chicken\" was totally tasteless and the chicken wasn't great quality either we were super disappointed. \nThe food really comes down to being 2 stars in my books, shows that a fancy name and high price tab will fool you into thinking this food is good.

However, the food was very pricey. Then again, it is Vegas and it is to be expected. I ordered the spicy tuna roll which was just average. It was very small and priced at $14. I had a severe allergic reaction to it which was not fun. I have never had that happen to me before when I have eaten sushi in the past. I want to say they may have perhaps mixed it on counters that were exposed to shellfish? I'm not really sure, but it was unfortunate. I also had the skewered meatballs which were tasted average. These were a bit more cheaper ($9) and came with quite a decent portion size. I would only recommend coming here if you need food this late at night!"

I imagine there were two sushi chefs working on it though, as the style of the cuts were very different from fish to fish.  The fish that were traditionally cut thin with that angle that makes for the perfect texture were great.  The thicker pieces with the straight down cut (kinda viet/chinese style) were not as enjoyable, but the fish was still excellent quality.  The thickness was really the issue with those cuts, but again, I still enjoyed.\n\nAfter hearing the rave reviews from multiple places, publications, and friends I ordered the fried chicken.  Something I would normally never order in a sushi place aside from chicken katsu-don.  Honestly, it was just ok.  Perhaps dragged down by its own hype.\n\nTHE THING TO TRY FOR SURE...  Is the oxtail bone marrow fried rice.  Sensational.  Traditional fried rice that hasn't been doused with soy sauce, with oxtail and bone marrow mixed in tableside.  Rediculously good.  Literally the first time I have had properly made fried rice in LV, and then with the addition of the oxtail and bone marrow.  Wow.  A must try.\n\nIn addition, have the pork belly kushi yaki.  Their take on it is great if you love pork and pork fat chunks cooked just right that you can shove in your face and hope no one else wants to try so you can eat the last piece.  Yeah.\n\nThe only thing I would have to say should be revised about this place is the menu layout itself.  It was about a month ago that I ate here, so I can't remember with as much detail as I would like to offer constructive criticisim about it but I just remember the menu layout being very off.  Particularly after noticing how calculated everything else they did was.\n\nAll in all, this is easily the best sushi I have had on the strip.  For sure the place to go if you enjoy traditionally stylized Japanese cuisine."

I am not crazy about their \"famous chicken\" however their yellow tail that was marinated was amazing and their sushi rolls definitely taste fresh. \n\nCustomer service always seems to be the thing that is lacking in Vegas so I guess I can't really complain, which is why I still give them 5 stars. Overall the waiter was really friendly and outgoing. It may have been that we had 'outdoor' seating that it was hard to provide service when needed. We sat there for quiet some time before someone assisted us with the bill and dessert menu. We requested for the wine menu but it was never brought out to us."

The sushi is impeccably fresh.  The sensai roll (triple color, yellowtail, tuna and salmon) is literally one of the best rolls I've had.  The rice was well seasoned (could use a smidge more vinegar) but a great foil and not too much rice. \nEgg custard is not to be missed.  Served in a little ceramic cup with a lid, it stays piping hot.  Smooth, rich and filled with seafood, it is amazing.  Another don't miss is the claims. The clams are dotted with truffled butter and miso before a quick broil.\nSo overall, loved this place.  it's pricier than even Roka Akor.  (They have sushi boats that start at $250.00) But the fish is amazing, the service is kind an worth stopping in at least once.  Weirdly for a really nice restaurant, they give you paper napkins rather than cloth.  Minor quibble, but I still found it weird given the attention to detail every where else.  The bar and tables for instance are some of the prettiest and comfortable pieces of furniture around.  But no cloth napkins?"

For those of you that enjoy California rolls, tempura and baked rolls this is not your restaurant. Only true sushi lovers can really appreciate what they are doing here. For starters how many places have fresh miso on the side of there miso soup you may think its there to add as you please but if you stop and taste the freshness of the miso you would realize that it's not only a bowl of soup but a chance to taste what miso should really taste like. From toro to there uni I was extremely impressed. And for those less daring I would recommend there yellowtail belly served as sashimi with jalape\u00f1o and ponzu sauce. I went alone and spent 200 dollars but I do not regret a penny of it"

Not because the food was really that good, but because we were late for the club Marquee so we had to find somewhere to eat fast. \n\nService was awesome and bad at the same time. The servers we got were slow and like forgot about us. But they got other people there that were backup servers or something. The backup servers were the main stars of our dinners. They actually came up to us and asked if we needed anything. They took our food and drink orders. The tips should have went directly to them instead of our server. It was funny cuz the servers remembered us right away when we came on the second night. Maybe because of my sequin pink revealing dress that was eye catching haha.\n\nFood was decent. We waited a while for our food since it was a little busy. The first night I had spicy crab roll, seaweed salad, and baby clams. The second night i had the spicy lobster roll and spicy scallop and smelt roe. I had a bite of steak from my bf too. The steak was pretty tender. \n\nPrices were kind of expensive, but because we also ordered drinks."

What better way to spend your last night in Vegas than splurging on Sushi and Saki?!?\n\nWe decided to check out Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill since they were open late and sushi and saki seemed appropriate for a fancy snack and buzz before bed.\n\nWe ordered the tempura rock shrimp appetizer ($19), spider roll ($20), braised short rib ($28) and bottle of cold Rock Saki ($45). I don't know why I've never been to a sushi place in Vegas but I'm glad we went and really enjoyed most everything we selected.\n\nThe tempura rock shrimp was delicious. I loved that the outside was lightly breaded and crispy and the shrimp were crunchy. I'm not a fan of wasabi but I actually found myself dipping my shrimp in the wasabi mayo bite after. There were probably about 13-15 bite sized shrimp.\n\nThe spider roll came in 6 pieces with wasabi and ginger. The roll was okay and kind of small but presentation was nice. To me it didn't have much flavor. There should have been more too it.\n\nThe braised short rib was the highlight of the night. It was tender, flavorful and  paired well with a grilled onion and smooth creamy celery root pur\u00e9e with teriyaki truffle that looked like mashed potato. At the beginning of dinner my husband said he wasn't that hungry but he devoured the majority or the dish within minutes!\n\nLastly the saki was a nice addition to out meal. I've never really sipped saki with my sushi (Its always been about saki bombs, lol). The Rock Saki was smooth, sweet and easy to drink. I've become a fan and look forward to enjoying it with many more meals in the future, especially if we visit Blue Ribbon again.\n\nBlue Ribbon Sushi and Grill is small and has a dimmed light, intimate ambiance. Our server did a great  job accommodating us. He was friendly, made good recommendations, checked on us often and kept our saki cups full. Overall we had a great late night experience. Next time were staying at Cosmo we'll be back."

So when we were in Vegas for a weekend, we decided to try this place out. \n\nHonestly, I don't know what the hype is all about.  I have to say that their hot dishes are amazing and their beef tongue and yellowtail collar dishes were the best of the night.  \n\nBut their maki rolls were TERRIBLE!  The size of the rolls were small and they were not good at all.  I don't understand why they have to charge an arm and a leg for terrible sushi.  \n\nWe also ordered their Sake Tataki (Salmon Tartare with a Quail Egg) which was average.  The dish was super small and nothing that special.  It's served with aged soy sauce that you mix with wasabi and scallions and honestly, there really was no taste to it. \n\nIf you want to go there for the hype and to check it out, I would only recommend to go for just the hot dishes like the beef dishes and the bone marrow (which was amazing).  But other than that, I would not go for the sushi.  \n\nWe didn't try their sashimi so I can't say anything about that but either way, I think I got food poisoning here too because my stomach did not feel well that night after eating dinner at this place. \n\nI normally like to eat at upscale restaurants and I'm used to having small dishes served at an expensive price but this place was definitely not worth it in my opinion. \n\nI would probably skip it.  There are plenty of other upscale nice restaurants in Vegas with better food for the same price.  Why pay so much for crappy food with small micro sized portions?"

With the weather scorching at a high 107 degrees, the obvious choice for personal attire would be to wear Shorts and not a suit and tie.  Well we approached the \"friendly\" hostess and were greeted with a \"Beachwear is not allowed in our restaurant\"... Instead of questioning why I saw staff wearing T-shirts and Jeans and why there were other customers wearing nasty ass Hoochie Shorts, and tank tops, we decided to take our money elsewhere, walked our \"6 figure low class asses\" right next door to the Bellagio and dined at Yellowtail Sushi where we ate the best Sashimi in my lifetime!

We tried quite a few items and for $200 for 2 people, left underwhelmed. ,,Was just reminded of one item that wasnt worth tasting...the fried chicken everyone raves about? imagine an overcooked mass of breading sitting in a pile of chile powder.

I mentioned we were waiting on the rest of the party which was arriving in 5 minutes, as well as pointed out that all the tables at the bar were empty and we would only be a minute. Immediately her voice changed and with some major attitude told us , \"fine you can sit here\". The reviews on this place aren't good for many reasons the people are rude and the food is not just bad, it's horrible.  \n\nFirst of all hire and train people who aren't arrogant and rude. The food was horrible. We ordered a huge selection and everyone at the table was extremely disspointed. Food was tasteless and the overpriced wings were burned and oily. It's like fast food fusion in a bad mall only with a few extra zeros added to the bill, the only difference is even fast food is better than this place.

My friend wanted to try here and I was amazed how good and fresh the sushi selection it has to offer. \n\nI generally won't order sushi rolls, because the sauces usually mask the taste of the not-so fresh fish. However, this place is legit! We had two rolls and it wasn't drenched in sauce, but very well- balance with rice and fresh fish. The rolls were at least $20 each, but very enjoyable. \n\nChef's selection - Hokkaido style handroll with UNI, TORO, IKURA wrapped in shiso leaf. OMG this $21 handroll is the best ever! I enjoyed every bite of it! \n\nWagyu nigiri and hamachi nigiri were very fresh and delicious. The wagyu was seared and melted in my mouth. Price tag per piece is at least $10, but i enjoyed every bite of it. \n\nOxtail fried rice was served in a hot claypot. It was tasty and meaty, but i think it's a bit oily. I dont recommend ordering if there's only 2 people. The portion is quite generous. \n\nI would like to come back for more of chef's selection and I heard they open quite late at night!"

I don't know what I expected but was very pleasantly surprised, even slightly blown away:  it was awesome.  The tako sunomono, octopus and cucumber in a vinegar sauce, is a good choice as well.  Throw in an Asahi or two and you're set!\n\nAn excellent bar and sake selection can be found here, if that's your kind of expensive hobby.

We wanted to try something new, so we let our very loquacious waitress make a few recommendations and we were off!\n\nTo start, we ordered the Ichinokura Himezen \"Sweet Sake,\" served cold. Like I've mentioned in some of my previous reviews, I'm no sake expert, but I thought the Ichinokura was really quite tasty.  I definitely recommend it if you're looking for something light and crisp.\n\nThe first dish our waitress suggested was the smoked pork belly (2 skewers for $5.5).  I thought this was easily the best dish of the night.  The richness of the pork belly was perfectly balanced by the lightness of the pickled onions and watercress on top.  Get this.\n\nOur second course was the Kanpachi Usuzukuri, which is a raw amberjack topped with yuzu pepper (8 pieces for $22).  The amberjack was fresh with good flavors in combination with the yuzu and accompanying ponzu.  Nothing mind-blowing.\n\nFinally, our waitress brought out the Oxtail Fried Rice, which she pointed out as one of their signature dishes (about 3 servings for $26.5).  It was REALLY good, but INCREDIBLY rich.  You really can't go wrong with cubes of bone marrow, but there is no way I would be able to eat this all on my own.\n\nBlue Ribbon is pretty tasty.  I wish it were it bit cheaper, but overall a success.  Next time, I'd like to try some more of their sushi.  Next time.."

The ambience was relaxing with dimmed lighting however, could get a bit noisy with the music and crowd going on a busy night. Originally from Hawaii, I was delighted to know our waitress(Randi) was also from the islands; can't go wrong with Hawaiian hospitality. The menu was pretty diversed. We decided to try a variety of options on:\n\nSpicy crab roll--- light and freshly. Wonderfully accented by the shiso. \nChawan mushi --- shrimp was cooked perfectly loved the combination of unagi and shiitake however, have had better at Gordon Ramsays West Hollywood!!!\nRock shrimp tempura--- nothing specatular, would've loved to have it seasoned with curry powder.\nMiso Cod--- To die for! a must have, perfectly marinated and cooked. Having just enough of the charred flavor.\nOxtail Fried Rice--- Easy to see why this is a signature. Just packed with beefy goodness (which also includes little creamy bits of marrow.. YUM!!!)\nFried chicken--- A must was well! Nice and crisp and moist. Includes breast, thigh, wings, and drummettes. Well seasoned with a mild spice and served with a honey wasabi glaze. \n\nDesserts were grand as well. Chocolate bruno with green tea ice cream was rich but, delicious. Bread pudding was possibly the best i've yet come acrossed and its ginger ice cream was yummers!!!\n\nOverall great first experience!"

Take care of us he did, but not necessarily in the most reasonable way. First came two giant trays of sashimi. When I say giant, each tray had over 30 pieces per person eating it. It felt like we gorged and still only finished about 75%. It was great sushi though in a great presentation, with the sashimi sitting next to the fish as if it had just fallen off. Thinking we were done, the chef surprised us with two more equal sized trays of rolls. They were too colorful and exotic looking to pass up, but we could only eat about 25% of it. I think there was then a third course of dessert which we barely touched. The chef realized he over fed us and knocked a few hundred off the bill, but it was still a pricy experience. Funniest part though was one friend (a chef) didn't want to offend the chef by not taking everything in doggy bags. So we filled the fridge of the penthouse suite at the Cosmo with leftover sushi. The room comes with a butler who made lots of fun of us saying we were the first ones to ever bring leftovers to the room. Most of it got tossed besides the few rolls I snuck after waking up hungry the next morning. I swore I couldn't eat sushi after this experience, that attempt lasted about a week.

It is absolutely beautiful inside and I will say the service was excellent ...they went out of their way to split checks among all of my coworkers and made sure we met our time constraint.  The duck goyza were delicious and hands down the best app between all 5 of us.  My roll however was a shrimp tempura and tuna specialty roll (I'm sorry I can't remember the name)...now when your in Vegas everything is over the top and you expect to pay for that.  However for $29 I got 6 pieces of what really felt like crispy rock shrimp wrapped in rice.  If I were to come back here I think I would stay away from their specialty rolls simply because they're just not worth the money.  One of my coworkers ordered an Oxtail dish with rice that was OUTRAGEOUS!  Overall this restaurant was good and got 4 out of 5 stars particularly for the service which as I mentioned was better than in some of the other restaurants we have eaten in at the Cosmopolitan.  Not a must go but def a decent spot in the hotel."

The restaurant is beautiful, the presentation is spectacular, and the service usually attentive, but the biggest disappointment was the food. Our party of four all ordered various sushis and sashimis, but was disappointed by each item. The rice on all of the dishes was slightly hard and gummy, as if it was left out for a while or made using low grade rice. The ikura sushi was unbelievably dry and lacking any flavor at all. We ordered three of the box sushis, and were disappointed by each one. The uni tamago wasn't anything spectacular. The smoked salmon shiso box was awful. Not only was the rice horrible, but the salmon was extremely oily and tasteless. It tasted similar to the gravlox found at low grade buffets. The tuna avocado was also mediocre. Despite box sushis usually being pre-made, the rice still should not have been as hard and dry as it had been. Good rice is an essential quality for excellent sushi, and sadly the Blue Ribbon at Vegas did not use quality rice. Not only did the sushi taste horrendous, but the price was outrageous, at least for the quality we were served. For the OMAKASAKE it was $48! That's a crazy high amount for maybe a dozen pieces of awful tasting sushi. And a  single piece of ikura sushi was $6! I've gotten double the number of pieces for the same price, and they were a lot tastier. Each box sushi was about $25-$30, and was a complete waste of money. \n\nThis was one of those places that you really want it to be good, and it looks delicious, but it just doesn't taste good. It's one of those places you go for a date when you don't care about the taste. It's impressive and expensive, but tastes horrendous. Sadly I have to give this place only one star because of the poor quality of the food. If they're going to charge that much for sushi, at least use better quality ingredients. We were so unhappy with our meal that we were still hungry after and had to go eat dinner someplace else, despite already spending a couple hundred dollars on awful sushi. I would say even though it may look very nice, it isn't worth it. Skip Blue Ribbon and save yourself money, time, and an upset stomach. However, if you're ever in New York, you should definitely visit the Blue Ribbon over there. We had a wonderful experience there, and was let down by the Vegas Blue Ribbon."

This is a great place to have a birthday dinner at.\n\nMy wife and I ate here as a treat for my wife's birthday away from the kids.  The service was great as our water cups were never empty and the staff was very friendly.  My wife got a free dessert for here birthday.\n\nMy wife ordered the spicy lobster roll (~$17) which was a small roll and tasted great (4 stars).  I ordered the Cosmopolitan (~$85) which is a mix of sashimi and sushi (4 stars).  Cosmopolitan according to the waiter is the more adventurous sashimi and sushi platter on the menu.  I requested one medium blue fin belly on the platter which they did do.  Wish they had Toro available as it was sold out before we got there.  It also had a nice selection of unique fish and a pretty cut up mackerel in the middle with about 8 pieces of mackerel sashimi coming from the cut up fish.  Most of the platter was rarer fish with great flavor.  I did wish it had something more unique than mackerel for the center piece.  We ended the meal with the free dessert which was anything they offered and my wife chose the banana split.  It was one of the best banana splits I have ever eaten.  The dish is made of one good banana cut in half length wise and place on the bottom of three scopes of ice cream of chocolate, green tea, and ginger flavors.  Ginger ice cream is pretty unique in flavor and pretty good.  It was topped with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and macadamia nuts.  As it was my wife's birthday a candle was placed on top which was a nice touch.\n\nThis is a place I will visit again as it has great selection of fresh fish and great service.  Overall it is a 4 or 4.5 star place as it is one of the better places I have been but pricey."

I entered into Blue Ribbon scared and concerned.  Scared because I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into and concerned that I would leave hungry.  I am happy to report however that not only were my worries unfounded but I actually really liked this restaurant too.\n\nLike I said, I don't eat fish... I mean none.  As a group we ordered appetizers, I only was able to try one non-seafood item, the meatballs, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good they were.  As my table ordered many sushi plates to share, I ordered my entr\u00e9e.  I chose the filet with mashed sweet potatoes, this was one of the best filets I have ever had.  The meat was cooked to a perfect medium per my request, seasoned well, and the sauce that was served on the steak was very tasty as too.  The sweet potatoes were creamy and delicious.\n\nThe server at our table was very attentive.  We never had to wait for our waters be refilled or for new drink orders to be taken.  He also provided great insight into the menu and helped the table decide what we might like.  He really knew the menu well and was very helpful.\n\n I highly recommend Blue Ribbon for both the food and service.  Who knew a non-seafood eater would love a sushi restaurant so much.

Diners often need an \"excuse\" to eat out and spend money frivolously; I am one of those diners. Because eating at a fine dining restaurant a few times a week, just because, is a ton of empty calories and quite time consuming. At first glance, Blue Ribbon's prix-fixed restaurant week menu stands out as \"a good one.\" You have the choice of two apps for your first course, a taste of sushi, three entrees of which only one looks good, and a dessert. But that excitement is let down soon after the third course.\n\nThe bisque was exceptional with large chunks of sweet, tender meat. The heat warmed the cloud of wasabi cr\u00e8me on the surface; when combined with the soup, it really complimented the lobster flavor. Upon further investigation, I found this is not on the regular menu. Generally, I'm against non-menu items on LVRW menus, but I was satisfied by this course.\n\nThe spicy tuna roll was by the book. No disappointment, no intrigue. And as a pleasant surprise it was served alongside a piece of chutoro and hamachi. I'm not fond of amberjack but the tuna was pretty good. \n\nThe pork cheek and trout entrees are not on the regular menu and everyone swoons over the \"Blue Ribbon Style\" fried chicken. At $26, this luxury fried chicken had the potential to be great. Its coated lightly with matzo meal and flour, then seasoned with a spice mix of togarashi, paprika, cayenne, and sea salt. Whatever unique, stand-out flavor I was searching for was overtaken by a vat of old oil. It was served with a dipping sauce made with--supposedly 'real'--wasabi and honey specially-imported from Mexico. Now that I would pour on just about anything but it just can't make-up for that stale oil taste.\n\nThe chocolate bruno is rich, dense, and extremely chocolate-laden and was supposed to be served alongside a green tea ice cream. They were out of green tea and substituted chocolate ice cream without letting us know first. Just what I wanted, more chocolate. I sampled a bit of the gingerbread pudding. The clear winner of the two. \n\nAm I impressed? No. Would I go back? Yes, but only to settle the rumors that their oxtail fried rice is really the magnificent creature they say it is. After the fried chicken fail, I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't worth the $30."

The rolls were fresh and appetizing and the edamame was quite tasty.\n\nThankfully they didn't put 18% on the bill for tip automatically, so we were able to let them know that we didn't really appreciate the service.\n\nNow, as I understand it this place was still in a soft-opening, so this review will likely be outdated in a few months,"

The total bill was over $100.\n\nPrice aside, the staff was super friendly.  We sat at the sushi bar and the servers and sushi chef kept checking in with us.   I thought the sashimi was really good and my wife agreed because she ate several pieces of the sashimi (normally she would only eat one...maybe two).  The rolls were good, but I probably wouldn't order the deep fried oyster roll again.  I love rice and I love deep friend oyster, but the two together in a sushi roll did not create a new experience - they taste the way they would taste if you just simply ate rice and deep fried oyster."

I have to say they had me at the $55 fried rice with blue crab and truffle topped with an egg that you mixed.  This was so heavy that we had to pass on dessert, but it was well worth it.\n\nOther dishes we had:\n-Enoki & hamachi maki roll --had to try it being a huge fan of hamachi, which is my favorite sashimi, and who doesn't like mushrooms.  I knew I had to order something small so that I could make room for the delicious $55 fried rice.\n-Sushi deluxe provides 10 pieces of nigiri pieces along with a roll of your choice, of course, we picked Spicy tuna --Spicy tuna had a nice heat to it.\n\nAgain, Vegas is always booming with new restaurants, but this is one of those places that I would visit again and try other dishes --even possibly a different type of fried rice."

I'd heard the rumors back in New York, but my travels to Las Vegas found me delirious with the sweet, juicy fried chicken between my lips! I started out with a negari of abacore and octopus, which were above par, and then the Japanese yardbird arrived. A hard crust batter encased the most delish chicken ever. Most, with an undisclosed flavor I can't even describe. So overcome, I hosted the sushi crew to enjoy a round of Japanese beer!\n\nSo good, I ordered some to go."

That $45 fried rice is pretty amazing, laced with loads of mushrooms, truffles, juicy crabmeat, and pieces of asparagus. Our group was amazed at how well it was done. Their truffles are seasonal so it changes (ours was Summer Truffle versus a friend's previous Black Truffle). \n\nThat cod was cooked to perfection, each piece falling off the way fish should be cooked. Delicious! I also had tried the Rock Tempura Shrimp (not anything too amazing to rave about), and the Yellowtail Teriyaki. \n\nAs for sushi, I tried the Spicy Lobster Roll, Enoki Hamachi Roll, and my pick: Sakana San Shu Roll (Yellowtail, Salmon & Tuna). \n\nWe called while we walked over from Aria at around 9 pm and waited 5 minutes for our table for 7 to be set up. Not too bad of a wait but of course this was a Sunday night."

The name of the place says it all. If you want to make it a casual blue ribbon title, then and hand out paper napkins, then you need to charge blue ribbon strip mall prices!  Yes, paper napkins!  I mean sushi can get messy and you just have this one paper napkin but you're buying cut rolls that cost $28 or higher, for like 4 pieces. $28 for the most basic roll in existence, a caterpillar roll!  I mean i would get it if it had toro in it but it was basic ingredients.  When I asked the manager about the situation with the napkins he said they have been \"considering it\" and brought me over some linen napkins which was really nice of him.  He said it's becasue they are trying to create a fun non stuffy casual atmosphere. But even fun people eating a nice expensive dinner before going clubbing would appreciate a clean, neat and comfortable dining experience.  Especially if you expect us to drop a couple of benjamins here.  \n\nThe sushi was seriously just OK, nothing amazing or memorable. I've had way better at hole in the wall sushi joints in California, but they've got Nobu egos here when creating the prices. \n\nThe two stars are for our nice, patient and helpful server. He was great.  When all was said and done, our bill was over $250 for two people.  I forgot about the sushi about an hour later and did not even think the experience or decor was that great for being in the new, fancy and almighty Cosmopolitan.  \n\nGo if it's convenient for you if you're staying in the hotel, but there are way better sushi places in town. I prefer Sushi Roku."

They pulled together a table for us pretty quickly even tho the restaurant was pretty packed. Service was great and very attentive. They made some pretty good recommendations on menu items as well.\n\nHere are my thoughts on a few of the things we ordered:\n\nHummingbird Cocktail- Cava and too much St Germaine made this bubbly cocktail much too sweet\nPork Dumplings - good but nothing special \nShrimp Tempura - just like popcorn shrimp from Long John Silvers, not worth ordering\nMiso Soup- they brought out fresh miso to add to the broth which was super interesting and something I've never had before, who knew miso was its own thing? I thought that was just the kind of soup that it was.\nHotate Spicy Scallop Role- absolutely my favorite item and so happy I ordered this\nGreen tea martini- refreshingly delicious\nChicken Fried Rice- so delicious!! And very original in the way it was prepared and presented\nLive Scallop- weird and kind of boring actually\nVarious other rolls that were all pretty good too\n\nPricing on their menu items is pretty high so be prepared to drop a lot of dough when you go in here. Luckily we came in for a business dinner so I didn't have to worry about breaking my own bank. \n\nI definitely recommend this spot if you love sushi and want a great experience!

I don't mind dropping a few bills on a well enjoyed dinner but not one that comes with a taste of salt and bad fish with every bite.I was with a group of 4, we ordered four types of sashimi, rock shrimp that came out in tiny balls of fried saltiness- red lobster would have done better, they lacked the shrimp inside, the whole grilled sea bass which was again salty and way overpriced at $48, it was barely enough for one person. Not being satisfied and still starving and parched we thought we'd try to order some hand and cut rolls...what a mistake we literally sent them all back. The only decent item we had was the saki and the service wasn't too bad when he remembered to bring our orders. I would never go back here or recommend this to anyone, I would say try Nobu or the sushi restaurant at the Wynn in Vegas because the $400 bill and bad taste in your mouth won't sit well in your mind after dining here. They have alot of work to do here.\n  We actually ate again 2 hours later at La cave in the Wynn for some well enjoyed late night bites by Chef Billy. Thank god for some real food and truffle grits to recover from the earlier disappointment."

The whole day in Vegas had been pretty ho hum (we did see Cirque du Soleil's Mystere, which was AWESOME, but that was at night!), and I'll admit, I was secretly counting the hours until our departure.  Sorry, I'm just not much of a Vegas gal, I prefer the outdoors to the nightlife any day.  Anyhoo, we went to dinner at Blue Ribbon because it was connected to our hotel, and allowed us to get to our Cirque show w/o being late.  Expectations were that we would get mediocre food but pay a lot.  They are a $$$$ place after all.  \n\nWas I wrong!  Seriously, aside from the Cirque show being phenomenal later that night, the best part of the day was our meal at Blue Ribbon!  The food was incredible.  I thoroughly enjoyed my appetizer of tofu & seaweed.  The ginger touch to such a simple dish was amazing.  My friend, who's a BIG fan of spice, asked for a couple of hot dips to be served w/his meal.  I wish I knew what the names were, but there was one that was on the creamy side, and mixed w/my tofu seaweed salad, it was just dancing in my mouth.  I also had an order of their avocado vegetable rolls and absolutely LOVED it.  They were so fresh and flavorful, hands down the best of any avocado rolls I've ever had!  For my entree I was on the fence between ordering their wild mushroom roast or getting a few plates of different vegetable rolls.  Our server convinced me to get their wild mushroom roast.  I had a bite of it after having an incredible appetizer and the best avocado rolls, so it just fell a bit short.  It was also a tad on the greasy side and just not in sync with the rest of my meal.  My friend told me to send it back, something I've never done, but glad he suggested it.  What ended up happening was I asked our server if it was possible to swap the mushroom roast (more expensive) for just another order of avocado rolls (waay cheaper), and I was willing to pay the price of the mushroom roast.  I told him I just really loved the avocado rolls and was hoping to have more of them.  He was sooo nice and obliged this request and not only did the swap, but he took out the mushroom roast from the bill and just charged me for the avocado rolls, which was super cool.\n\nFrom this meal on, the rest of the time in Vegas was a whole lot better, and left a good taste in my mouth.  If you're in Sin City, I'd say this is definitely worth giving a try, you'll leave full (but not stuffed!), and more than content.  Oh, and I forgot to mention, service is also terrific!"

The unique roll I loved the most was the Kaki Fri which was fried oysters and lettuce, this was the by far the most distinctive roll I tried.  One roll which seems interesting since it has caviar would be the Blue Ribbon but I found it to be somewhat bland which is disappointing given it was the most expensive of those we ordered.

From the moment we walked in till the end of the meal, everything was very pleasant.  Everyone was smiling and seemed like they really enjoyed being there.  The ambience was lively and all the guests seemed like they were all having a good time. Definitely a hip place for date night or a group event.\n\nWe ordered from the Restaurant Week menu and sure there was sushi, miso soup as part of the first course but there was short ribs AND fried chicken. Say what?!?! Fried chicken at a sushi joint? YUP! Do it, it was awesome! You'd think ordering fried chicken at a sushi joint is like picking up sushi at a gas station, but that is so far from it.  The chicken was awesome.  The Asian inspired seasoning accompanied by the honey wasabi something or another sauce made it an awesome interpretation of fried chicken. A definite MUST HAVE. DO IT!\n\nWe opted for the add on: king crab leg truffled fried rice.  We loved it.  Now a days, truffle is the 'in' thing but this dish was beautiful made.  The truffle was not over powering and the king crab was quite generous.  Everything was mixed table side, which made for a wonderful presentation and kept us salivating.  \n\nOur dinner ended with our last course: dessert.  The portions during Restaurant Week was perfect.  We were already full but when two beautifully presented desserts laid right in front you, you have no choice but to try it, just a bite.  The ginger bread pudding was delightful and the chocolate dessert most definitely satisfied our sweet tooth.  \n\nThe service was very nice. Everyone we came across was engaging and did something to contribute to a very pleasant and wonderful experience.  Thank You Blue Ribbon Sushi, we'll be back for another date night!"

But then the food, wow. We went with the sushi and sashimi platter and it was absolutely amazing. The freshest fish, expertly prepared with awesome presentation. We also tried several\nIndividual rolls, I highly recommend the yellowtail, tuna, salmon roll, it is a perfect combo of all of the favorites.\n\nBlue Ribbon is a must try restaurant, from service and selection, to atmosphere and quality, this place hits the mark. I guarantee you will not be disappointed."

I'm glad we tried this place and definitely be back to try other things. We tried Miso soup, clams, hamachi, spicy tuna, New York steak, halibut & coconut rice, asparagus, and peppers were all so good n yummy!"

So I did, and after I told myself if I ever got a Yelp account and could review a restaurant this would be it!\nAll for good reason.\nEven being a cook, I haven't always been the most adventurous. In fact it wasn't until a few months back I started eating sushi.\nSo even with a few nerves I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried everything from the eel to the beef bone marrow.\nLet me just say, I've eaten a considerable amount of meals- I'm not lying when I say it was literally the best meal I've ever had. And with food this good, a high price is expected and it was money well spent.\n5 stars, thank you for a great culinary experience!"

This was obviously a mistake but after a few hours of black jack at Bill's, I was drunk and ravenous. Although the food wasn't terrible, it wasn't very good and that's saying a lot when your drunk and starving. I had some chicken dish (obviously not memorable) and the bf had sushi (which came to over $30 for two rolls) Also, our waiter was weird...real weird. Bottom line is that this place is mediocre and over-priced. With so many great restaurants in Vegas, I wish we took the $150 we spent here and had a better dinner out."

Not many sushi restaurants in the US have Isaki. Unfortunately they were out of them. \nI ordered shima-aji, hamachi, and sea urchin. They were all fresh and tasted very good. My only complaint is that the sushi is very narrow and skimping on the fish for the price. \nI've eaten sushi in Ginza Tokyo and Otaru Hokkaido. If I paid $10 a piece for sushi in Japan, they give you enough fish to make it worthwhile. I understand its Vegas but Ginza doesn't even do that. \n\nI also ordered the asian broccoli rice dish. I thought it was a fried rice of some sort but it was just cooked broccoli with a bowl of white rice for $13....kinda ridiculous for just cooked broccoli.\n\nMy friends ordered the tempura udon and a seared yellowtail collar. They both seemed to really like it. \n\nAll in all I felt like I could've gone to other restaurants in the cosmopolitan and $60 would've got me more food. It was great sushi but just didn't feel like I got what I paid for."

I mistakenly ordered their fried chicken. Why did I order fried chicken at a sushi restaurant especially when I'm not a huge fried chicken fan? A Yelper had posted that it was the best fried chicken she'd ever had, so that compelled me. I was expecting little pieces of fried chicken like ones I had had at another restaurant I can't think of. But these were actual full breasts and legs seasoned with a spicy concoction. It wasn't terrible at all. Just... I really should have ordered more sushi. Maybe that's why I left with an 'eh' feeling. There wasn't anything wrong with the restaurant. Just wasn't much different from any other sushi place I've been to."

They weren't bad tasting, but nothing spectacular either.  Very plain and pretty small in size. Maybe it's because I've had much better sushi elsewhere.\n\nThe cooked dishes here were much better:  \n*Oxtail fried rice (4 stars):  The oxtail fried rice is pretty large in size and very tasty.  It's best shared by 3-4 people if you're eating family style.  There's a bone-marrow omelet on top which adds richness to the dish.  I wish the omelet were larger in size compared to amount of rice you get.    \n*Blue ribbon fried chicken (4 stars): If you like fried chicken, you will LOVE this dish.  It's brought to the table fresh out of the fryer and extremely hot in temperature.  The chicken is covered in a red spice that gives it a little kick, but not too spicy.  It's served with a honey-wasabi sauce that gives the chicken a sweeter flavor if you choose to use the sauce.  The chicken meat is so juicy; even the white meat didn't have a hint of dryness.  This dish is pretty large as well, so it's best shared family style too."

Second was bone marrow, served on the bone with teriyaki sauce and toast. They recommend you dip your bread in the sauce and then spread on the marrow. It was so good. I very strong and unique flavor. Something I would definitely order again. We also had a couple pieces of albacore, blue fin, and one of their rolls which I cant seem to remember right now.

After coming into town with my college pals for a birthday celebration, we decided to head here for dinner as two of my pals knew this place from NYC. It also fit the bill as two of them wanted steak, and two of us wanted sushi.\n\nBefore you go any further, this is not your corner sushi restaurant. It's spendy, and it's great. Know that going in, and you won't be surprised. There are less expensive sushi restaurants--this is NOT one of them.\n\nOur server was Jason and he was fantastic. He checked in with us regularly, gave us his opinion when asked, but also offered up customer feedback (i.e. he might not be crazy about a dish personally, but shared with other customers thought). He also sent over the waiter who is a wine aficionado when we had a question about wines, making sure we had the best information. We were even allowed to sample the wines before making a final selection.\n\nT and I were in the sushi set, and we were thrilled with our meal. The fish is exceptionally fresh, and among the best I've ever had. Everything we had was good. The dishes we tried were:\n\n1) Ebi Shumai (shared by all)... don't forget to dip in the ponzu, with a dash of hot mustard on the side\n2) Edamame (shared by all): standard sushi bar fare, topped with chunky kosher salt\n\nSushi menu:\n1) KANI SUNOMONO (blue crab sunomono)--blue crap wrapped in cucumber with a vinegar sauce. Blue crab was amazing, but the flavor of the vinegar was lighter than I expected (compared to other sunomono).\n2) SPICY TUNA & TEMPURA FLAKES-- The tempura flakes mixed into the spicy tuna was an unexpected and welcome twist on a sushi bar favorite. Tobiko is also mixed in.\n3) UNA KYU (eel wrapped in cucumber)--never seen this presentation before, but it was a great contrast between the heated, tender, sweet eel, and the cool cucumber\n4) Custom--the sushi chef prepared a spicy salmon roll in the same manner as the spicy tuna & tempura flake roll. This was the winner of the evening.\n5) We also had a cooked fish dish, but I couldn't find it on the online menu to tell you more (sorry!) Yellowtail, I think?\n\nOur friends shared the 20 oz bone in rib eye, which was HUGE. T and I aren't red-meat eaters, so I can't give a personal commentary. But they ate every bite, and it was a good sharable dish for two women.\n\nThe steak came with tempura onion rings, which were completely ridiculously awesome. That was shared by all. It was a generous side that wasn't finished by our table of four. It also came with a side of bok choi, which was good (not as ridiculous).\n\nThey brought our birthday girl an amazing brownie topped with ice cream. The brownie had chocolate chips in it, and was fantastic.\n\nWe ordered the mochi and shared that among the four of us. They even cut each piece of the four flavors into four so we could all try all flavors.\n\nAdd in two bottles of wine and our total came to $330 (before tip). As I said, this place isn't inexpensive, and it's not your everyday restaurant. But for a great special occasion, this restaurant hit the mark on all levels, from service, to quality of food, to taste. I would definitely come again."

I've been to this restaurant a total of 3 times, so here goes:\n\nThe service is nothing compared to the food they have to offer.  The servers are rude and very snobby.  They were very short with their descriptions and made very bad reccommendations after we've specifically told them what we were looking for.  We asked the server for some good reccomendations for sake, something special, nothing too cheap.  He pointed at the wine list and said \"there's the menu, you can look inside to see what you like.\"  We told them that the sake they had in the menu wasn't what we were looking for, the server then said \"then, what you see is what we have, nothing else.\"  Very not helpful.  Then we saw one of the GM, Chase, fortunately remembered us from before and then started helping us from then on, bringing out their best sakes from the \"inside\" cellar.  After that, the servers then started to be nicer and more attentive after seeing how much money we were willing to spend on our dinner there.  (not the type of service i was looking for, i believe all paying customers should be treated the same to have the best experience at any restaurant.)\n\nThe sashimi is incredible, all a la carte, top of the line sashimi sold by piece, not per order.  They have toro that comes in 3 different levels, something you can definitely order and taste the differences between all of them.  They have a few different fishes that you probably can't order anywhere else so the selection is very top of the line.  Of course they have other regular sashimi but the quality is always fresh, something i think is guaranteed everytime you go.  They have Uni that is prepared in the shell and served, delish!"

Unless you're a serious baller (like the Green Bay Packer players we saw rolling out of here) you're going to feel the hurt when paying your bill. With that little detail out of the way, Blue Ribbon is worth checking out.\n\nThe place has a modern Japanese feel and is divided up into three areas. When you first enter there's a small sushi bar to the right. Past that is a spacious lounge and bar area. Beyond that is the main dining area with a larger, U-shaped sushi bar. The tables in the main dining area are rather intimate, with many booths lining the walls and tables that are separated by thin wood dividers. So, if you're looking for a place where you can have some personal space and are more than 6 inches away from the nearest diner, then this is the place for you.\n\nService was spotty. Our server was nice enough, he just didn't seem to know what was on the menu and couldn't recommend anything. Luckily, one of the managers came by to suggest a few items. Although he was casually dressed in jeans and a polo shirt so when he first came up to chat I thought it was just some random dude wanting to talk about the menu.\n\nHere's what we ended up ordering:\n\nTuna sashimi. 2 pieces. Pricey, but deliciously fatty and silky smooth. Possibly some of the best tuna sashimi I've had in the city.\n\nKanpachi - Amberjack with yuzu pepper. The order came with eight slices of fish with the yuzu sauce poured tableside. \n\nSmoked pork belly kushi yaki with pickled onions and baby watercress. Two decent cuts of pork with a nice amount of fat that added to the richness of the flavor.\n\nNegimaki - broiled beef with scallions and enoki mushrooms. It was a cute looking dish with eight slices of beef wrapped around the scallions and mushrooms. It was a good, savory dish with a hint of sweetness from its sauce, but probably not something I would order again.\n\nMiso marinated black cod. Two sizable pieces of fish per order. You usually can't go wrong with miso black cod, but I've had better. The piece that I had had a slight fishy taste and smell.\n\nCrab and truffle fried rice. The menu says it's $55 per order. That's ridiculous for any type of fried rice, but since everyone seems to rave about Blue Ribbon's fried rice we gave it a try. The manager said we could get a half order. Perfect! There were plenty of chunks of crab and mushrooms and slices of truffle. Definitely the best fried rice I've had, just don't tell my mom that (sorry mom, your fried rice has been bumped down to number two)."

Just a few miles off the strip, you can get top quality nigiri served edomae style for a fraction of the cost. But if I have to have Japanese cuisine on the Strip, I always pick Blue Ribbon.\n\nI've always found the sushi quality to be high, and appreciate they have a wide selection of fish. Bonus points for chawanmushi on the menu. Oxtail fried rice is to die for. Fried chicken (not kidding) is a must-try. Solid sake list as well. There's likely something to make almost everyone in your party happy.\n\nService can get a bit iffy when they're slammed, but otherwise attentive and always been friendly in my experience."

Our server was really nice and attentive! Stars for that!\n\nOn to the food,  We ordered a special unagi sushi roll, smoke pork belly kabob appetizers, the blue ribbon fried chicken with wasabi and honey dipping sauce and of course dessert! \n\nWhoa! It was satisfying on all levels! It was shared among all of 3 of us (1 roll, 2 pork belly kabobs, and not one but 2 blue ribbon specials) - great eats! Chicken was perfectly fried, moist in the inside and seasoned well. Dip them babies in the sauce and have steamed jasmine rice on the side was just heaven! It's got to be one of the best fried chicken I've ever had! ;) The smoked pork belly kabobs was smokey and a good starter..the unagi special roll I think we could have done without was your average roll you can get anywhere...but if you are in town, the blue ribbon chicken is a must try! Did I mention the chicken was perfect and was it mentioned here enough? Lol\n\nOk ok on to dessert, green tea ice cream was yummy. The chocolate mousse/bomb that we ordered was way to thick and extremely decadent..overkill to our delicious meal, my friend ordered the banana split and it was ok...at the end of all this good eats - come for the fried blue ribbon chicken, it was THAT good! \n \nAll in all the entire score would be a 4.5 stars...lost a half a point on dessert and price of overall meal...\n\nI would definitely be back and will make reservations and just come for the fried chicken!!! All else can be grabbed elsewhere ;)"

This place was a huge disappointment and robbed us of our time and money. \n\nWe stumbled upon this place because they were the only nice restaurant still open late at the Cosmopolitan, where we were staying. \n\nWe sat inside a very dark dining room where I could barely make out my boyfriend's face.  The music was blaring and I couldn't talk to my date, besides yelling - It wasn't intimate. \n\nThe menu is expansive and rather tedious to look through. We decided on a few sushi rolls and nigiri. \n\nI always start with a miso soup ($7) for a small bowl and you have to mix in your own miso paste. I mixed all of my miso paste into the hot water... But It didn't blend in well and took me a while. When it was finally blended - it was not warm anymore. So I was pretty much sipping on room temperature miso. To top it off, it was bland. \n\nIt's appalling how much they charge for sushi rolls that come out in 4 or 6 small pieces. I recall the \"dragon eel, avocado, radish sprouts\" - it's just your typical caterpillar roll - nothing extravagant. The eel was your standard eel and not even with a thicker piece of meat, paper thin avocado, and radish sprouts. Crazy simple and no frills. It came out in 6 small pieces and was $21.75. It wasn't memorable and I only remember that there was a lot of radish sprout flavor. \n\nWe also ordered the \"Ebi tempura fried shrimp, radish sprouts, avocado\" - just like your typical crunchy roll. Nothing about this was fancy or special. All I recall was tasting radish sprouts and rice. $14.75 and it came out in 4 pieces.  \n\n$5.50 for 1 piece if sake (salmon nigiri). We had to order 2 of them and spent over $10 for 2 small pieces of nigiri. The salmon was cut thinner than the average sushi restaurant. It was fresh and buttery but there wasn't anything special about it and not worth the price that they charge. \n\nWe spent well over $90 for bits of food here and there and lots of radish sprouts and we left unsatisfied and hungry."

I've eaten at Blue Ribbon in Brooklyn, New York for a work event and it was much better there. My boyfriend and I ordered two specialty items to share: \n\nThe king crab fried rice: had barely any hint of truffles as shown in the posted pictures. There were large chunks of shiitake mushrooms which were unappetizing. Basically way over priced and over hyped for this dish\n\nThe Blue Ribbon lobster sushi maki roll: the lobster was hard, cold, and chewy. The emphasis was that there was caviar on the roll, but it did not make the dish any better. \n\nI usually like to order signature dishes for what the restaurant is known for and I don't mind paying high prices for great food, but this was definitely a flop. I don't recommend these two dishes here."

The sights walking up to the restaurant were phenomenal.  It did take us a little bit to find it, so give yourself at least 10 minutes to get from the front door to the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant is large.  There is a bar in the front for cocktails, then tables and the sushi bar in the center, booths along one side.  We were led all of the way to a back room in the back corner.  It made for a very private feeling which was great in a bustling restaurant.  Bonus points for us actually being able to hold a conversation.  Had we not been seated in the corner, it would have been frustrating to talk to each other.\n\nWe decided to go with the Chef's Tasting.  I don't believe it is on the menu, but we paid $100 per person.  Two large plates came out.  The first held only sashimi, four of each kind, and the second came with nigiri.  \n\nThis is clearly the type of place that prefers quality over quantity.  While they appeared to be two large plates, I was still a little hungry at the end.  Not everyone eats everything, so I was a little bummerface.  I wouldn't say that I'm entirely picky, but had I known then what I know now, I probably would have ordered something separate in addition for myself.\n\nThe quality was on point.  The fish was fresh, and the flavors dazzled.  The seaweed salad is certainly a must.  We ordered two for the four of us.\n\nI'd absolutely recommend it for special occasions, at least once."

My vegetable fried rice was flavorful as well and had strips of fried egg on top. I had asked a waiter for some hot sauce and he was kind enough to bring me both sriracha and the hot sauce that is given to those who order the oxtail fried rice. The hot sauces definitely made the fried rice taste a lot better. I think for what I ordered $25 was definitely too pricey.

If you are looking for a \"glamorous\" Vegas restaurant experience, this wouldn't be my choice...I had the fried chicken...the wasabi honey sauce was great, chicken was OK. Overall, good food, creative drinks, but I like the other Cosmo restaurants much better."

Went in with the family before catching a show and everything from the food to the service was outstanding.  Wife and I ordered the omakase sushi and sashimi  only, while we ordered the kiddos udon.  Below are some notable dishes worth ordering if you are giving this place a try:\n\n- udon was delicious (thin noodle)...places that serve udon in a stone/clay pot is doing it right\n- seaweed...best side order of seaweed (had a variety of 3 types of seaweed)...super fresh...awesome dressing to go with\n- prawn and giant clam sashimi excellent quality\n- bread pudding dessert w/ ginger ice cream...best I ever had!\n\nAlso wanted to give kudos to our server...thank you!"

Blue Ribbon is an establishment whose sole agenda is to con you into spending $200+ for a basic meal.  It's Vegas, likely your pumped up on adrenaline or alcohol and you do not notice a serving of $8 salmon is ONE PIECE.  Normally it is two pieces.  $16 for an average serving of farm raised salmon is a crime.  Most I have seen it, wild, primo, is $8.  I can buy super premium salmon from New Zealand for $20/lb, that is 16 $8 servings at Blue Ribbon !!!  For better fish !!!!!\n\nWhat I have expressed so far is just the beginning of YOUR bad experience here.  The Sake appeared to be watered down with added sugar.  I make my own Sake, I understand the product.  And a GLASS of Sake is a SHOT GLASS for $15.  This is also a crime against the customer.\n\nIn addition what I ordered was not delivered.  The chef serves the profit, NOT YOU, and when confronted BS's you into shutting up.  Except in my case I understand Japanese food.\n\nThis place should be avoided at all cost.  You will wake up in the morning upset and feeling used - because you WERE USED.  I have never been taken advantage of more then this scam house.  My experience in Vegas was damaged."

The freshness and cut of the fish at the BR LV are what you'd expect from a low-priced NY sushi joint. Not terrible, but nothing like the sky-high prices would indicate. The tuna wasn't cut properly and none of the fish tasted truly fresh. The chef slathered lemons all over my sashimi to cover up the so-so fish; truly fresh fish doesn't need this ruse, and the NY Blue Ribbons use it sparingly. The service was not bad, not great, and the drinks were cloyingly sweet and stingily poured. And the price was a little higher than NY. Is this just how Vegas is?"

Made an \"Open Table\" reservation and found our way up to the gorgeous 3rd floor of the hotel. We began with the sashimi salad which was assorted sashimi slices on butter lettuce wraps.  The fish was nice and fresh. Great start! Tried the Blue Ribbon Roll but I'm not a caviar kinda girl so I don't think I'll try it again, a bit salty for my palate. We wanted to try their famous fried chicken and our waiter was kind enough to suggest ordering the chicken wings- made with the same batter as the fried chicken entree, less quantity and less money, nice! If you're late-night dining, wait for their menu special that begins at 10pm- order the beef skewers! They have a tasty Japanese beer \"Koshihikari Echigo\" that we were very impressed with! The staff was on their A-Game, attentive, courteous and charming. Good job Blue Ribbon, we're hooked!"

Like among my firsts this year, a visit to Honolulu, no visit to San Francisco or Chicago (usually visit one or the other.\n\nRestaurants in Las Vegas with any sort of quality often comes with a price tag and Blue Ribbon Sushi and Grill is no different.  When your dinner companion is a pescatarian, choices are limited.  Blue Ribbon is a better than average sushi restaurant, we had ordered the standard miso and  something new, Chinese broccoli lobster bisque.  The miso was good but the bisque was delicious and not too rich.  We also ordered ebi rolls, shrimp tempura rolls and I also got the Pork rind appetizer with shoshito peppers and poached cherry tomatoes.  All our rolls were created simply but the rice and fillings tasted wonderfully.  Pork rinds are an acquired taste which I have and the combo of the warm cherry tomatoes and shoshito peppers made this a new revelation.\n\nAfter this full meal, we were too full to even attempt dessert.\n\nTruly a wonderful place to try and be forewarned that the prices are a bit higher than your neighborhood sushi joint.\n\nSo with this review, my Yelp challenge for 100 reviews is completed!"

The shumai (3 tiny pieces) was awful and it was ridiculously over-priced.  The lychee martinis tasted like v8 juice and tasted nothing like lychee.  The bill was close to $80 just for maybe 2 appetizers and two martinis.  Will never come back here.  To top it off, the bartenders were annoying and wouldn't leave us alone.  Eat elsewhere!

Also when we asked two of the servers what would be a great roll to get( there menu stinks and does not describe any item very well) all they could say was the same two items which happen to be the two most expensive items on the menu. No kidding they thought they were good... Good for increasing the bill. The one comment and really the most important comment of this review is that they don't have Ahi.  What sushi restaurant doesn't have Ahi? They have got to be kidding I thought... A sushi place without Ahi is like a sandwich without bread. Speaking of bread, the service interaction with customers is better and friendlier at a Subway restaurant ordering a sandwich. And no, I don't eat at Subway but just wanted to give some type of example. If visiting... Walk on and go to the MGM's sushi bar."

To read the full thing complete with pictures, check out my blog!\n\n\n\nAfter wandering around the property some more and trying my hand at penny-slots, we figured a nap in our oh-so-comfortable-with-super-soft-sheets bed was in order. We had reservations at the NYC-transplant Blue Ribbon Sushi at 7:30 and we were both very excited for whatever a gala dinner was. We were seated in the back, semi-romantic section of the restaurant, handed warm towels to wash our hands with and an extravagant menu. \n\nWe decided on what we would choose and were then informed that there were no choices to be made, as we would be receiving everything. Jaws drop.\n\nFirst they brought out a little appetizer of King Crab and Champagne Dashi (complete with edible gold flakes on top!), and while it was interesting, it wasn't my favorite. Next, we were served bowls of Wild Mushroom Miso Soup in which we were each able to mix in as much miso paste as to our liking, and a sharable salad of seasonal lettuce, Asian pears, cranberries and poppy seed dressing. After that, a giant platter of super-fresh and delicious sushi and sashimi was put on our table and we were in heaven as sushi has always been our favorite date food.\n\nNext came the main courses (as if we hadn't already been served enough food for a substantial meal). Three to be exact. And they were full-size. Awesome doesn't even begin to sum them all up however. First there was a Miso Lobster - a full Maine Lobster with the meat already out of the shell, stuffed back in and mixed with miso butter to a perfect flaky consitency that pretty much melted in your mouth. We made pretty good work of that dish. There was also the Fried Chicken \"Blue Ribbon Style\" that had an excellent crisp, tangy outside and juicy inside served with wasabi honey. Last, there was a rather large bowl of Oxtail Fried Rice complete with bone marrow, daikon and scallion. Stuffed as we were, we took home most of the chicken and fried rice but we were totally satiated.\n\nBut wait, there's more. Dessert was pretty much the gold flake of the entire meal - an ooey gooey God-send of Ginger Bread Pudding with creamy ginger ice cream and caramel sauce. After deciding that it was safe to walk and not topple over, we decided to take a digesting break in the room before heading to the concert."

The Striped Bass was cooked to perfection (crispy skin & flavor) and the summer vegetables in the lobster broth added a great element to the dish.

Service was above average and so was food--price just a tad high but can't dock too many stars. It's that good."

My husband and I were super excited when we found out this NYC restaurant was coming to Vegas.\n\nMy group dropped in just for an \"appetizer.\"  The waitress was super nice and helpful - not pushy at all with our order, understood that we didn't want to eat too much.\n\nShe suggested the Amberjack sashimi (8 thin slices) in the ponzu sauce and the pork belly skewers from the appetizer side.  Both amazing.  The pork belly comes with 2 pieces on one skewer (feeds maybe 2), so make sure you order enough for the whole table - cuz no one is gonna want to share!  We also had the Oxtail fried rice based on Yelp reviews, and we were not disappointed at all.  The waitress also recommended this \"fruity\" sake, Ichinokura Himezen, which was AMAZING.  I'm going to buy my own bottle this weekend...\n\nI love this place.  I will definitely plan on coming back next time I'm in Vegas (maybe try more of the sushi).  Great for groups with large booths and sushi bar seating."

We were staying at The Cosmopolitan so it gave a perfect opportunity for us to try it out before heading out for the night on the town. We had no reservations so we were expecting a long wait as it was around 830pm. We were told by the hostess of a long wait if we wanted to dine inside as reservations had the main dining areas booked but we could be seated right away if we were ok with sitting in the outside front patio-type area. It was still early and the Marquee crowd wasn't in full swing yet so I was ok with it. If it had been later, I wouldn't want it because Blue Ribbon is near one of the upper floor exits of Marquee and I wouldnt want to try and enjoy a dinner with drunk clubbers walking by and heading to Secret Pizza or wherever else they're headed.\n\nWe were immediately asked our drink orders upon seating. Service was very good. Our waiter was very attentive, I felt. It was easy to be forgotten being outside the main dining hall but he was good. We just wanted a small meal as were headed out to a club later that night. I ordered the fried chicken ($29) which came with that great wasabi & honey sauce. Now that is some great fried chicken. Great crunch on the outside with a seasoning of flavor and moist & juicy fried chicken on the inside. I really enjoyed it and that dipping sauce of honey & wasabi was both sweet and had a spicy kick. It was very good. Not cheap but I'm making the case that it was worth it. Also ordered was the braised short rib ($28) served on a bed of celery root puree and drizzled in truffle teriyaki. I had a bite or two of it and it was a really flavorful dish. The short rib was fork tender and the drizzle was delicious. I recommend this dish for sure. \n\nI would certainly go back again to try the other offerings on the sushi and seafood side of the menu. Blue Ribbon isnt cheap but you wont be shorted on quality here. Reservations are recommended for dining inside, especially at the height of their dinner service."

            "review": "I want to be crystal clear here - this review is for my meal under Taisho (chef) Hisa-san...the rest of the attitude, service, vibe and general faux-Japanese uselessness of this place would earn it an easy 1 star. In fact, I have eaten here accidentally in the past - invited by someone, and it was terrible.\n\nBut complete kudos to the owner who is sharp enough to have hired Hisa-san, the amazing chef from Toranoko, and before that Tamon and I believe Nobu in NYC? If I'm not mistaken. The sad part is that this man's ability is wasted on the mind numbing rolls upon rolls that are ordered every two seconds here. \n\nThis is of course a fake Japanese restaurant. And by \"fake\", I mean run with a mish-mash, miss-match of Japanese style, and American expectations (which usually translates to what you're used to eating in Korean run Japanese places - which is sauce drenched 3rd grade fish). \n\nIn any event, someone here is at least trying to do things right by bringing in one of the most talented sushi chefs in North America. And no - he aint my cousin, or my roomate. I only know him from Toranoko in LA where he served me many a wonderful lunch and dinner. \n\nIn any event, I ordered a special Chirashizushi, which I have uploaded a pic of. It was mind blowingly good.\n\nThe hot sake was 22 bucks for a large, and was pretty nasty. Ozeki? lol Green tea martini was 14 bucks and not enough alcohol for a minor buzz. Younger asian waitress was very good. No oshibori unless requested. \n\nThis place is geared for pretentious social climbers and you'll see and hear them all around you if you sit at a table but the bar clientele was a bit better. \n\nStill, while I was eating - this complete douche walked over to me - on behalf of what looked like his Beverly Hills \"entourage\", spending daddy's money on frivolity and had the bloody nerve to tell me to move the end of the bar because he and his friends needed my seats. Oh my. I wish I could have taken a snapshot of his face when I gave him that look that Tsuruta Koji usually wears right before someone's head (spicy hand) rolls off his shoulders. I mean - who are these fools? \n\nWhat's worse is that the host staff looked on as this happened and did nothing. I mean - there was food in my mouth, and this gangbanger-wanabee momo that probably has a VIP pass to Attari sandwich shop in Westwood, is bugging me - they acted like, \"hey cool, maybe they can get him to move\". 1 star! \n\nIn any event, it was one of the best meals of my life...which is kind of evident when you look at the pics.\n\nI suggest that Ribbon does the following:\n\n1. Allow for a proper experience at the Sushi bar by having Hisa san, and anyone of his calibur in an area AWAY from the rolls and crap orders. Have them focused on Omakase sushi in a quieter, less intense environment where Japanese customers who drop big coin, will feel comfortable. As it was I didn't see one Japanese person eating here.\n\n2. Bring your prices to a normal level on nigiri and your sushi bar business will pick up. It was half empty or empty when I walked by a few times over the past couple of days. \n\n3. Get a print out of what Omotenashi is and teach a little bit to your hosts, waiters and waitresses. In fact - read it yourself! There is no excuse for a 3.5 star restaurant in this hotel - none. \n\nOsu!"

I was also a bit upset at the amount of items that were not available on the menu.  They were out of 4 or 5 things we wanted.

It was like Kyuki or something like that, it is amazing. I also had a bowl of miso soup and it was really cool because the soup comes clear with the tofu and seaweed... And you get to mix in your own miso which turns it a tan color :)\n\nMy dinner date got a Kieren beer and a seaweed salad and omg the seaweed salad was amazing! The dressing that was used was delicious and the seaweed was nice with a great texture. For his course, he got the Mahi Mahi on a bed of rice and it too, was scrumptious! \n\nThis was probably my favorite/yummiest dining experience in Vegas. \n\nThe layout of the restaurant is so cool, I couldn't stop talking about it but our server, the sushi chefs, and the food all made my experience 5 stars\n\nI will return and I can not wait"

            "review": "I'm not someone who blows a lot of dough on these overpriced restaurants in the strip hotels, but this time, it was a paid meal for a business meeting with only 3 people, so I jumped at the opportunity to try this place out as the Cosmo's restaurants seem to maintain high quality although overpriced as expected.  \n\nI would usually sit at the counter and talk to the chef, but my party was 3 and they were already seated at the table, so I went with the flow.  \n\nWhen I first read about the blue ribbon restaurants originating in NYC opened by a couple of jewish restauranteurs...I wasn't so sure about this place.  Besides, no authentic sushi chef would ever name their sushi restaurant \"blue ribbon\".  However, my worries were whisked away as soon as I opened the menu filled with mostly old school sushi and appetizers.  Yeah, there were a few fru-fru rolls and wagyu just so that non-sushi eating americans can still enjoy the meal, but the menu was appealing and mouthwatering for the most part.  \n\nWhen going to a sushi restaurant, it's always best to go with \"omakase\".  I talked to the waiter who really couldn't tell me that much about the omakase, so I asked who the Japanese sushi chefs were, and 3 out of the 4 chefs at the tsukeba were Japanese (a good sign), and the waiter led me to the head sushi chef.  \n\nSo I asked what his recommendations were today, which were botan-ebi, uni, aji, and sakuradai...very good, and when I asked him if those would be included in the omakase and he confirmed, so I went with the $100 omakase.  He seemed a bit surprised that I spoke to him in Japanese as I was in a group with 2 caucasians, but it's always good to talk to the chef in Japanese to: 1) make sure that the chef is Japanese and 2) to let them know that you are Japanese because really... you can't screw around with Japanese customers who know their stuff.  \n\nWe started out with some Kumamoto oysters on the half shell with ponzu....excellent (not part of omakase), and then we got a HUGE plate of sashimi consisting of: uni, ikura,, scallops, sakura-dai, aji, hirame, seared salmon, blue fin tuna, isaki, hamachi, and botan-ebi (I may have missed a couple).  This was pretty impressively presented on a plate that must have been about 2 feet long.  It was an omakase order for 2 people.  The waiter actually asked us if we wanted two identical plates or one big plate with more varieties and I was glad that we went with the latter.  It was truly a HUGE spread and every sashimi was impressively fresh and delicious.  I was especially surprised that they had a quite a bit of white fish, which is more of an acquired taste as you are tasting more of the amino acid/protein rather than fat.   I feel that talking to the chef beforehand had something to do with that, as most Americans would not know what they were eating and probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.  \n\nThen we had a large sushi plate with blue fin tuna, kanpachi, salmon, giant clam, king crab legs, spicy crab roll and some other fancy roll.  \n\nOverall, excellent sushi/sashimi with a quality that surpassed my expectations.  I would have preferred to have had a few more nigiri's instead of those Americanized rolls, but I would say that it was an excellent meal overall  As for pricing...$100+tax+tip seems a bit on the expensive side.  Would I go back on my own dime?  Hmmm.....that's hard to say, but I'd rather spend $100 on what I ate today than $100 on an overpriced steak restaurant on every other big casino on the strip.  If there is a next time, I would sit at the counter and have my nigiri made one at a time while talking with the chef.  That's how sushi should be eaten."

First off I have to say - the service was super friendly and our waiter was funny and knowledgeable about everything on the menu from food to sake. Personally, I think he was the best part of the meal.\n\nAfter checking out the prix fixe menu choices for RW, I decided on getting the Cream Of Chinese Broccoli Soup with blue crab, the Spicy Tuna Roll, the Seared Ono and Ginger Bread Pudding. \n\nThe soup was nice, served in an earthen-ware crock garnished with cilantro and topped with what I think the waiter said cilantro cream. Thick and comforting, with the chinese broccoli giving it a deep green color and big presence.  The chunks of blue crab were large enough and tasty enough to be a nice foil against the dense broccoli flavors.  Very nice little soup.\n\nThe Spicy Tuna Roll was small, but good.  Nothing mind-bendingly stellar, but good.  \n\nThe Ono was served beautifully seared and topped with cucumber, cilantro and red onions in a tart-sweet vinegary broth.  The serving was super generous and the fish done perfectly.  Good dish overall, but the flavors were a bit watery I found.  My husband got the fried chicken with honey wasabi dipping sauce - and when I tasted his sauce, it seemed watery to me as well.  I guess I'm just a gal that likes bigger, bolder flavors.\n\nThe  biggest downside was the clientele.  I knew this was a casual restaurant going in - and thought it would be a cool place to check out after work that doesn't require dressing to the nines.  The space is nicely decorated, modern and hip - but the two-tops are so close together that we could readily hear the, ehem, \"businessmen\" next to us loudly discussing the way  to success - with one giving the other advice so that he didn't get his \"d*ck whacked\" - amongst other doucheyness.  Really???\n\nGood excuse for checking out the Cosmopolitan finally - but for the top tier price of $50.12 a person I've had much better Restaurant Week meals and experiences elsewhere."

Ordered miso soup, the chicken \"un-fried\" rice, and several rolls.  All were boring and bland.  The waitress recommended the Dragon roll, so we ordered it.  A different roll came to the table - and she said \"oh, sorry, the buttons are next to each other on the machine when I put in the order.  Do you want to just go ahead and eat that one?\"  Never got the Dragon, and would recommend any other Asian restaurant in Vegas over this one :)"

A Great atmosphere all around here, the service was super quick and we were heading for a show so that made a difference but we never felt like we were being rushed.\n\nThis place was full of great customers, always famous at the Cosmo.  Gorgeous girls and guys, lots of tiny waists and big boobs, that equally matched the big shoes and tiny skirts!  ... and that was the guys!  No I'm kidding LMFAO! \n\nI will never go to Vegas again without eating here at least once!"

But it's worth the risk of being puked on to get to this Vegas Sushi gem. The ambience is dark with a techno beat and comfy chairs. Perfect place for a romantic dinner. I had a very good bowl of Miso soup, where they bring the base separately and you mix it in when you are ready to eat. My wife had a similar Miso with Hitake and Aburaage that she enjoyed. I then had several pieces of Sake nigiri and liked it so much I doubled the order. The salmon was sliced generously and very fresh; the rice was perfectly prepared. The entree I chose was a 9oz filet prepared medium rare and covered in a brown sauce. I could have cut it with my fork. The side was a sweet, mashed potato which was a nice compliment, though it was missing something: maybe garlic or allspice could have added the missing spark. My wife chose a chicken entree and I stole a few bites. It was better chicken than I would have expected at a Japanese steakhouse and served on a tasty bed of bok choy with a side of the sweet mashed potato.\n\nThe service was fantastic. We received plenty of attention and never grew thirsty. My wife received expert advice on choosing a japanese beer based on her domestic preference. At one point it appeared that a random drunk was stumbling through the room carrying an empty tray, but my waitress assured me that is the manager. Apparently he pays close attention to cleanliness while sampling the bar stock. :)\n\nThe worst thing I can say about the Blue Ribbon is that they use cheap paper napkins and disposable chop sticks. When I pay $200 for dinner, I expect all the details to meet a higher standard. However, in this case that minor detail can be overlooked to enjoy a great room, great food, and great service."

This of course is not your typical bar sushi place so we had some questions for her, her responses were always rushed and made us feel dumb. Also my friends' food orders were all delivered together (40 mins) and mine was not delivered to the table for another 20 mins.

Located in the Cosmopolitan, which is quickly becoming one of the stars on the Las Vegas strip, it's actually on the 3rd floor in what can be described as a small high-end eating, drinking, and shopping mall.  \n\nIt didn't seem quite as popular as its next door neighbor Jaleo, and they had plenty of seats available at the sushi counter where I sat.\n\nOne entree, one roll, and a seaweed salad came out to be $60.  The roll and seaweed salad weren't very impressive, but the fried chicken entree was.  I had seen other reviews raving about it, and add my name to the list of people who wouldn't mind eating it again.  It was great - piping hot when it came out to me, really crispy skin that had been doused with pepper and the honey-like dipping sauce was good as well.  Though I enjoyed it more without the sauce.  \n\nI will say that the entree was absolutely massive, and if you do order the fried chicken, try and share it with another person and/or limit the number of other things you get.  \n\nService was great, and I enjoyed sitting at the chef's counter - they would occasionally (well, once) pass a complimentary tasting of something exciting that the chef had prepared."

It was pretty packed for a Tuesday night, but we were happy to sit at the bar. I'd make a reservation if you have more than a couple people, though. \n\nBartenders were casual and attentive. They did charge $17 a bottle for Orion beer (ouch) but with Asahi on tap, I had a decent fall-back. We started off with the edamame. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Then, in a sushi joint, I decide to order fried chicken (I don't even go to KFC), but figured it had to be good, or at least interesting, to be sitting on their menu. And you know, Vegas. Best decision of the night, bar none. It's actually the 9 piece Bucket O' Wings, i.e. Fried Chicken \"Blue Ribbon Style\" with Shichimi Pepper & Wasabi Honey dipping sauces. I highly recommend it if you're not in the mood to fill up on sushi. Crispy, but still moist, the flavor of the chicken, alone, is fantastic. Add the sauces? Amazing. \n\nMy wife tried the Pan Seared Scallops, w/ Hearts of Palm w/ Myoga Salad & Brown Butter Ponzu. Scallops cooked perfectly. This was a light, flavorful counter to my comfort meal, so we traded dishes often. She then offered to trade one scallop straight up for two pieces of my chicken. I think she likely got the better end of the deal, but I didn't complain. The ponzu was all mine at that point too. Very tasty. \n\nIt's definitely worth checking out. Prices are a little up there, but the atmosphere is casual and the food worth the trip."

It was a Tuesday evening around 7pm and we didn't have reservations, but we were able to walk up and immediately be seated.  Score!  First impression?  Blue Ribbon Sushi was true to its name with an impressive selection of sushi and sashimi varieties as well as plenty of grilled items to choose from.  However, such a large menu of appetizing sounding options did pose a small challenge in narrowing down our selections.  \n\nWe started off with an order of Beef Marrow ($18.50) that consisted of two halves of a split marrowbone topped with sea salt, shaved bonito, and teriyaki sauce.  Good, but I'd had better, more substantial, offerings elsewhere.  The best dish of the night was the Oxtail Fried Rice ($28.50) supplemented with daikon, shiitake, and bone marrow.  It was pricier by far than what it should've been, but wonderfully savory and delicious.  For my entr\u00e9e, I had the Chirashi ($55), a selection of the Chef's special sashimi over sushi rice.  The menu didn't list the types of fish that were used to top the sushi rice.  I should've asked our server.  Uni, salmon roe, salmon, octopus, and tuna were definitely present and were exceedingly fresh, especially the uni.  However, given the exorbitant price, I certainly wished that I'd received more sashimi than I did and hoped that some of the tuna that I did receive was, otoro, a prized fattier cut. \n\nBlue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill served up well-executed fare.  Its fish was high quality, as fresh as you'll find anywhere, and skillfully cut.  Its cooked dishes were flavorful and seasoned with restraint.  However, everything cost at least 25-30 percent more than it probably should.  As much as I enjoyed what I put in my mouth, I was much less enamored by what I had to pay for the experience.  I'm not averse to paying a lot for a meal.  However, in this case, I felt that I didn't get a lot of bang for my buck."

            "review": "The Blue Ribbon seemed like the perfect choice for Shannon's birthday dinner place because I could get my sushi fix while the menu had several other Japanese & American options. The food and the service was just mediocre. When a restaurant is that beautiful and located in the Cosmopolitan, you kind of expect a great experience. It was just underwhelming. Shannon barely touched his food, but he would never send anything back. He mentioned that he didn't like it, but the server didn't seem to care. My sushi was super small and I hate that. (check out the pics) I ordered Mackerel and what came clearly wasn't Mackerel. When I gently mentioned it to the server, he wanted to argue about it. You think he'd just offer me something else.\n\nFor the record, Shannon wasn't as critical as I was on the Blue Ribbon."

            "review": "We enjoyed our meal at Blue Ribbon Sushi.  The service was great, although the hostesses were dressed rather casually for the atmosphere of restaurant.  \n\nI am rather spoiled when it comes to sushi, as I live in California, and have access to to lots of very fresh sushi.  That being said, I felt that the rolls athe Blue Ribbon Sushi were good, but not amazing.  My cocktail, however was delicious.  had the Off the Road, which featured tequila & cucumber, yum!\n\nMy husband order the New York Steak, which came with really yummy bok choy & asparagus.  Although, the best part was the tempura onion rings, OMG!\n\nThey had a pretty decent sized menu, and I only tried a very small percentage of what they had to offer, so I am sure there will be much more to try out next time!"
