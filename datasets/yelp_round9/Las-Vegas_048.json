            "review": "Classical norther Italian cuisine - excellent service \n\nI really like the idea that they offer a prix fixe dinner for $60 per person. You can basically choose anything on the menu- 5+ courses. But of course my tablemates weren't up for this so we ordered a la carte. \n\nBuffalo mozzarella caprese salad was nice with fresh heirloom tomatoes. A bit disappointing to see 3 tiny ovini of the mozzarella. \n\nSame with the scallop risotto- nice, creamy, delicate flavor; with 3 divers scallops and several shrimp. (why are the upscale restaurants always serving children's size portions? :-) \n\nThe sommelier confirmed my choice of a fruity dry white wine that complemented my meal very well.\n\nNice place to splurge a bit!"

Certainly these small bowls spill over with exceptional quality. The Tiramisu dessert is to die for ! - service was great if a little intrusive but overall a\ngreat experience here."

            "review": "I ate at Fiamma on Christmas Day with my parents and husband and we all very much enjoyed our meal. The ambiance of Fiamma is lovely, it's warm and inviting, modern but not overdone. Our service was very good, as well. They also had my all-time favorite wine, Leitz Dragonstone Reisling, so I really can not complain.\n\nBut on to the important stuff. The food: I went with the Fall Tasting Menu which was 3 courses for $45. For my first course, I got a Caprese Salad with buffalo mozzarella. It was light, fresh, perfectly salted and very good. My main course was chicken that was very juicy and perfectly cooked with perfectly roasted potatoes. Dessert was a trio of individual mini desserts. They were very, very good and included a creamy panna cotta, a tartufo and tiramisu. A very satisfying ending to a delicious meal.\n\nI, of course, tried everyone elses dishes and can say that the Short Rib Ravioli are to-die-for. My dad had a special that night which was the Strip Steak. It was perfectly cooked and so flavorful, accompanied with potato croquettes and caramelized pearl onions. He probably had the winner dish out of all of us, it was so so good. Overall it was a great dining experience and I would definitely return, for the reasonable price it was on equal par to many of Vegas' fine dining restaurants."

I was not disappointed.   Had been here a few years ago for dinner.\n\nThis time, the food was amazing, the service friendly and attentive.  I had the boar ragu gnocchi and the caprese salad.  Both were superb!   Paired with a Super Tuscan from the appreciated wine list (not that their cellar is Spartan...they have both a short and long list from which to choose), it was one of the best meals I can remember!\n\nNon cheap, but what is in Vegas these days.

Service from our waiter Doug D was top notch.  Now for the best part, our food.  We enjoyed a sampling of items and have to say that everything was amazing however there were some highlights: \n\nCucumber martini, clean crisp and refreshing!  \n\nPOLIPO (Char Grilled Octopus, \"Livornese\" with Toasted Bread Crumbs and Oregano).\n\nARANCINE (Braised Kobe Beef Risotto Cake Pomodoro, Parmigiano Crema).\n\nAGNOLOTTI (Piemonte Ravioli, Ricotta, Spinach, Crushed Pomodori Pelati).\n\nBRASATO (\"Piemontese\" Braised Beef Short Rib,Potato, Caramelized Root Vegetables ).\n\nDon't forget the deserts.  We tried five of them and our table favorite was the CROCHETTE (crispy amaretti doughnuts with spiced glaze, chocolate ganache, apple butter,fontodi, vin santo del chianti classico)."

            "review": "Located in the MGM Hotel.  I came here kind of spontaneously with my family.  We were starving in the area and some Italian sounded good to us.  Service was descent.  Wine/Alcohol options are presented on an iPad, which is unique.  Overall, it's a descent restaurant and I had a pleasurable experience.\n\n\nCRISPY CALAMARI:  It met my calamari standards.  A lot of the calamari pieces came in octopus shaped pieces haha.  \n\nKOBE BEEF MEATBALLS:  Huge meatballs that we split amongst us.  Packed with flavor and it was awesome.  It came with ciabatta bread that is perfect for dipping into the pomodoro sauce.  \n\nSEAFOOD PLATTER: An appetizer dish that has a little bit of everything.  It comes with 4 oysters on a half shell, 4 prawns, half a lobster tail, and ahi tuna tartare.  I loved everything.  The tuna tartare had a kick to it, which was perfect for a spicy lover like me.\n\nFIAMMA TRIO OF PASTA TASTING: This dish gives a tasting of three of the Chef's Favorite Pasta Dishes.  I don't think you'll be full as the picture I took shows the portion size.  I would suggest getting the actual dish instead.  Here were the pastas...\n\n---TRADITIONAL POTATO GNOCCHI: This lobster gnocchi was really good.  You can taste the truffle and the gnocchi is made really fresh.  I understand its popularity!  It was the only one I think worth ordering of the three.\n---AGNOLOTTI: This was beef, veal, and pork ravioli.  I didn't like the flavor of this at all. I can't even tell you what bothered me, but I just didn't enjoy it.\n---ORECCHIETTE: This was broccoli and spiced sausage with tomatoes and pasta.  This was just average and came out just what I expected.\n\nRAVIOLINI:  This was my order of the night and it was great!  Usually ravioli entrees come with three or four fat raviolis and you're left hungry.  This dish came out with a bunch and I left perfectly content.  The truffle cream is amazing and the short rib ravioli is really yummy!\n\nHOMEMADE FETTUCCINE:  This is such a filling plate.  The fettuccine is well made and the creamy basil pesto sauce is good.  The sauce is quite dominant and strong, so a head's up to those who don't like that.  Prawns were big and scattered in the dish. \n\nBAROLO BRAISED SHORT RIB:  The flavor of the braised short rib was amazing.  To me it had a hint of asian seasoning and this is definitely a great choice for those who are craving meat."

Braised short rib is one of Fiamma's signature dishes - the short rib had a nice wine reduction but wasn't the most memorable I've had. Would return to try the gnocchi tasting.\n\nService (2.5-star): New waiter was nervous and visibly awkward, despite our simple party of two. Attentive but simply wasn't ready for dinner service.\n\nAmbiance (3-star): Restaurant is fairly loud and better suited for large groups."

We ate here for my husband's birthday on 01/17/2012 and it was just awesome! I cannot remember the name of our waiter but he was a short, thin, white male with glasses, he was very pleasant, nice, attentive and had a really knowledge of the food. The hosts and the other staff were extremely nice as well and very on point with the service. The restaurant is beautiful and the food was just delicious! My husband had the steak and I had the salmon. The food was on point, well cooked and just mouth watering. They brought him a little dessert with a lighted candle and 2 glasses of champagne each in the beginning and then in the end of our meals. Definetely recommend eating here!!!"

I was excited to try this place because I had tried Pearl and Shibuya and thought those 2 were superb but never tried Fiamma. I was extremely dissatisfied with the quality of food here. The wine is very over priced so much so that even a cocktail cost the same and the wine is not exotic or thrilling to warrant the high prices. I will not be coming back here again."

Came here last summer for dinner with my family.  It's pretty casual, however, I don't think they'd allow you in without a top or shoes (i.e. if you're coming from Wet Republic).  \n\nThe food was okay... a little overpriced, and it really didn't appeal much to my palate.  I remember us ordering the calamari, a caesar salad, the braised short ribs, and some pasta dish.  There are definitely other italian joints I'd hit up before this one.  However, I do want to try the gnocchi--I hear that's pretty good. \n\nOne thing I did like was the ginormous wine selection they had to offer.  They had a sommelier that helped us pick something out.  We ordered a bottle of pinot noir, but really didn't like it much, and he gladly exchanged it for something else.\n\nThe service is good.  Nice ambiance.  I'm glad it wasn't directly in front of the casino.\n\nOverall, give it a shot... there are plenty of reviews on here that have given this place rave reviews.  You be the judge."

            "review": "I'm a tough critic when it comes to dining, but if I could rate Fiamma an extra half star for a 4.5 I would.  This was my first time dining here and I will DEFINITELY be back!\n\nI started with a glass of the Acacia Carneros 2006 Pinot Noir ($15).  I have a glass of red wine with just about every meal out that I have and this was the best I've had in a long time.  Extremely smooth, not too sweet and not too dry.  It was a perfect compliment for the food also.\n\nFor an appetizer I ordered Tomino Alla Griglia:  \"Grilled Piedmontese Cheese, Zucchini, Rocket Lettuce, Roasted Cherry Tomato, Vincotto Drizzle\" ($14).  This was absolutely amazing.  The zuccini was grilled & thinly sliced, topped with the bed of lettuce, and the bed of lettuce topped with the round of grilled cheese.  I am a huge cheese fan and this cheese was very good- grilled to perfection, not overly cooked, soft, full of flavor, and not over powering.  The roasted tomatos gave the dish an extra something that completed it.  I had to force myself to stop eating this to save room for my entree!\n\nMy entree was the famous signature Gnocci All'Aragosta:  \"Soft Potato Dumplings With Maine Lobster, Mushroom and Black Truffle\" ($31).  This was basically an orgasm in my mouth.  I can see why this is one of their signature dishes- the lobster had very good flavor & good portion (although I can always go for more lobster in dishes), gnocci perfectly done, smooth and flavorful, and mushrooms & black truffle were the perfect compliment.  Portion size of the dish in it's entirety was good, I had to force myself from finishing this dish as well since it was so good. \n\nA bread basket with EVOO was brought out prior to antipasti but I didn't touch it partially because I knew I had a ton of food coming, and it also did not look like anything spectacular.  It consisted of two different breads, a standard looking something or other and another that resembled ciabatta.\n\nAs for the enviroment, this would be a great place to have a romantic or special occasion dinner.  The lighting was a bit dim.  This is the first restaurant on the left after you enter the Studio Walk in MGM, so unless you are seated more towards the inner portion of the restaurant, as I was, you'll be very open to the mass amounts of foot traffic passing thru and the opening of the casino floor. \n\nService was good but nothing special.  The waiter was friendly and made small talk.  One thing I did not like was the fact the GM or AGM, whatever he was, circulated the dining room a few times just kind of looking around.  I only saw him stop at two or three tables during that time, and one of them was not mine.  This, the service and enviroment are the reasons I did not give Fiamma five stars.\n\nI took pictures but my flash was not working and it was very dim, so they would be pointless to post.\n\nOverall, the food was amazing, I will definitely continue to recommend.  If you come here, the Lobster Gnocci is a must!"

            "review": "Stay away from this place!  Recently my party of 6 dined there late one evening while we stayed at the MGM. They reluctantly sat us down after the Maitre d told the hostess that they were still open despite her protests. Sitting down was the best part of the meal. After we quickly ordered (fearing the chef would go home). We received a skimpy seafood platter that consisted of 2 crab legs, 4 oysters and 4 shrimp. The oysters were not fresh (dank and fishy). My daughter and I both spit them out and told our waiter. The shrimp were basic large shrimp. $42 Thank you.  3 of us ordered NY Steaks(quick and easy to cook). They were tasteless and tough. Truthfully, I've had better steaks from the supermarket.  I've eaten steaks in just about every major steak house in this country and these ranked dead last for taste, seasoning and tenderness. We ended up getting one for free steak after my daughter complained how tough they were.  The waiter did not even ask us if we wanted a vegetable. I had to request one after the meal was already ordered.  My other daughter got the seafood risotto and it too was dank and fishy. She barely touched. it. The spaghetti and meatballs was good as was another pasta dish. When dessert time came we were told that the dessert chef had gone home and we could not order anything. Just as well. I asked for the check and saw that an 18% tip had been put on it (a party of 6 is now considered a large party?).  The bill was almost $500. We were given poor treatment, served subpar food food and made to feel like they were doing us a favor by serving us. I'd have to say that after eating in Las Vegas for over 20 years that this was easily the worst meal for the most money I've ever had.  We would have been better off eating in the buffet. We would have gotten the same quality food, been treated better and spent a whole lot less. Oh, the one star was for the decor."

It was actually our last stop on our last night on vacation, we had planned for NoBu but at the last minute they were all booked up, so we opted for Fiamma. Since we were staying at The Signature, we made the walk through the pathway to MGM often and we walked past Fiamma almost everyday.\n\nIt's very classy, chic when you walk in. Dark and cozy atmosphere, with fireplaces burning next to you. A very intimate spot.\n\nOur waiter was so helpful and attentive. He helped me decide on the special for the day which was a fettuccine with an olive oil vinaigrette, pepperoncinis and sausage. TO DIE FOR. Ryan ordered a Truffle pasta with steak and a thick, creamy, cheesy sauce. Also, TO DIE FOR. We decided it was one of our favorite Italian restaurants we'd ever tried.

The bass from the background music can be annoying.  The complimentary bread is slightly salty. This is not a good thing when paired with the two sauces which are very salty.  The goat cheese sauce was salty and goat cheesy. The tomatoey compound butter tastes salty and weird.   I'm thinking it is the metallic taste of sun dried tomatoes that isn't properly balanced out.   I would have been happier with a good olive oil and balsamic.   The linguine with clam sauce was swimming in liquid.  I'm thinking clam broth and lemon. The problem with pasta served in liquid is that it will continue to absorb the liquid and even if it was once al dente it becomes soft and mushy.  The clams were tiny and supplemented with chopped clams.  This screams CAN regardless if it isn't true.   The short rib raviolini was good.  It was filled with shredded short rib and served with a rich cream sauce.  It didn't look like much on the plate but was filling.  The pasta could have been firmer.   \n\nDon't order pasta here if you know how it is supposed to be served."

Our server, Vince was excellent. \n\nWe started off with bread and the sun-dried tomato pesto. The pesto was excellent. The bread was decent. The Kobe meatballs were tender and flavorful, but the accompanying bread was too charred and overpowered any other flavors. \n\nFor entr\u00e9es, I got the gnocchi(lobster) and my girlfriend got the short rib and truffle pasta. The gnocchi was worth the price of admission. Complex and rich with velvety gnocchi. Her pasta was okay. There was not much texture change with soft noodles and short rib. The truffle and short rib gave the dish nice earthy components, but to balance it out I would add something crisp and something to brighten the flavor. Possibly thin crispy fried balsamic onions and baby peas.\n\nWe had the chocolate torta for dessert. The star was the Gelato. However the cake was on the mealy/dry side. It seemed like the dish was plated and refrigerated. The ganache on the plate had lost all viscosity. \n\nAll the nitpicking aside, we had a very good meal."

Instead of an apple just stuff a big wad of black truffle potatoes in my mouth. I'm done.\n\nThis restaurant was recommended to me by George Carlin. Yes, THE George Carlin, so we scooted over there one night and were seated promptly. \n\nThe prices are what you'd expect for the Strip but I hadn't heard anything about the executive chef, so I wasn't expecting to have my taste buds be punched with flavor. KO.\n\nI had the Manzo that was cooked perfectly with a side of black truffle potatoes served in an all-clad pot. My wife had the lobster Gnocchi, which she talked about for days after.\n\nI had some coffee with dessert, which they brought out in a french press. Nice touch and great eye opener.\n\nI have been back several times."

Kerry one of the Bar tenders is a great source of information for anything that is happening in the city. He even hooked us up and allowed us to drop his name at a couple of clubs which helped get us easy  V.I.P.access. \nThe food is out of this world and the 800 wine selection is the BOMB. BOOM!!!! Delicious. If you want to impress a nice person in your life take them here and tell Kerry that Keenan from LA says Hello."

            "review": "So this is an Italian restaurant located within the MGM Grand area.  It was my husband's birthday and we opted to go for Italian as he loves Italian and we don't normally get it (plus it was way cheaper than the Japanese tasting menu I was eyeing across the way).  I'm going to break down the two parts of the dining experience: food and service.\n\nThe food was okay.  We split the Spinach salad, which they thoughtfully divided for us.  However, it was just meh -- the dressing was relatively tasteless but there was a great deal of bacon in it.  Then my husband ordered the spaghetti with the Kobe beef meatballs.  I had the pasta trio tasting.  When it came out, my husband was served the orecchiette.  We sent it back to get the appropriate dish which was an excellent idea as the orecchiette was present in my trio and the pasta was just really doughy and the sauce very bland.  My trio also had a lobster gnocchi and a ravioli with some game meat.  The ravioli was actually pretty good and I ate every bite of it and almost licked up the sauce.  The gnocchi was okay, but they used a lot of lobster in what felt like compensation for the blandness of the rest of the dish.  My husband's spaghetti however was terrible.  The pasta was not cooked through -- you could still taste the dough and the sauce was also really bland.  All in all, for the food, we would've been happier being served Chef Boyardee spaghetti and meatballs which was really disappointing because my husband loves Italian.\n\nNow for service.  We were seated and water and menus were brought out.  Great.  Ten minutes pass until our waiter comes to see us (it wasn't him that brought the water and menus).  We give him our order.  Our salads are bought out by someone who was not the waiter in about ten minutes.  Then a half hour passes before we get out entrees.  It's the wrong entree for my husband.  Fifteen minutes later and our waiter appears for the second time that evening to bring out the correct food.  We finish and our plates are cleared away by someone not a waiter.  We wait for twenty minutes looking for our waiter to order dessert, but he's nowhere to be found.  We realize that it's past 9 and we have to go because we have tickets to the 9:30 show of Ka.  We track down the manager and ask him for our check.  He actually comps the drinks which was really nice of him because my husband didn't make a scene or anything -- just walked up to him and explained that we had been waiting for 20 minutes to order dessert but now we had to go and needed the check.  After we receive the check and now waiting for the credit card slip to come back, our waiter makes an appearance for the third time that evening to ask if we want any dessert.\n\nAnd during all this, the table next to us arrived about fifteen minutes after we did and got an appetizer, a pasta dish, and were just finishing on branzino dishes when we left.  The manager also stopped by during each course to see how they were doing.\n\nAfterwards, my husband was still mad about this, so he went back to the restaurant to talk to the manager.  The manager told him that he was actually not the first person to tell him about the bad service and food *that night*.  Their reason was that they were really busy even though when we sat down the restaurant was half empty and didn't start filling up with those large groups he mentioned until we had received our entrees.\n\nAnyway as my father later put it, \"We get these comments every night, but we don't care because this is a tourist trap and we're never going to see any of you people again anyway.\"  So this place gets two stars.  But the manager who comped our drinks without request gets four stars because he knows how to try and make a client happy."

It's a luxury to be able to just \"go downstairs to eat\" and have so many delish, if not inexpensive, options. (well, i guess one can always just walk an extra 100 yards and get a hot dog from nathan's)\n\nEvery dish I've ever had at Fiamma is at least very good, if not great.  \"Modern Italian\" can go horribly wrong, but the menu here is interesting and well thought out.  Love the short rib ravioli (though throwing one or two more on the plate would be nice), and the spaghetti and 'kobe' meatballs are simple, but/and just exactly right.   \n\nThe thing that prevents me from giving five stars, and even had me flirting with three, is that the service is SO SLOOOOW.  I have experienced exceptions to this rule, but believe me it is the rule.  Luckily, I'm not usually in a hurry for anything when I'm in vegas..."

We were seated in a lovely booth, and even though we dined very early in the evening, the restaurant was nicely busy while others around it were not.   Our waiter was fabulous and after a disappointing pear martini, suggested a peach belllini which I loved.  \n\n  For appetizers our group had shrimp, calamari and the flat bread with ham, cheese and truffle oil.  They were all fantastic.  The calamari was the deemed the best of any eaten.  For dinner two members of our party chose the specials, one had the ricotta and spinach ravioli in vodka sauce with lobster (and noted that the lobster while a tad bit overcooked was very fresh), the other special was the ribeye with truffle mac and cheese, also delicious.  The two remaining dishes were the ossubucco (the meat was so tender it melted, the sauce with the gnocci was a tad bit on the salty side, but delicious. The final member of our party chose the short rib ravolini in cream sauce and enjoyed it as well.     We also enjoyed two desserts: the chocolate cake and an assortment of gelatto.\n\nWe will definitely dine here again, the flatbread and calamari alone were worth the trip.\nFor an idea of cost along with the above food between us we had probably 10 alcoholic beverages and our bill was 350 dollars for four of us."

Surprisingly not packed at all immediatley following a Cirque performance.\n\nSince I was sitting at the bar, i got to talk to some bartenders. Not only were the bartenders incredibly friendly, funny, and easy to talk to (a super plus, especially if you are going alone), but they mix up mean drinks, and can give great recommendations on the menu. Ask the bartender with a sweet ass cuff (Kerry) about it. He makes them himself. When I complimented him on it, he took measurements off my wrist and made one for me (which I just picked up from him today). I mean seriously, when is the last time you ever got talking to a bartender that well just on your first visit?? \n\nI also met this real hottie from LA and we got to chattin and drinkin and going out to another place after and ...

Wasn't really interested in giving suggestions or checking in - mostly just took our orders and delivered the food. He was also quite behind on refilling waters as both of us had to ask twice. \n\nThe food, however, was a good thing. We ordered the bleu cheese and arugula salad, which I could've eaten the entire bowl of. The parmesan crisps in the bread basket were salty and delicious to accompany our drinks.\n\nAs for the main courses, I ordered the sea bass with panzanella and my guest had the short rib ravioli. The former was just ok. The fish was cooked well, but didn't have much flavor. The salad dressing was the best thing on the plate, while the panzanella barely had any bread in it! More like a plain salad with some croutons. The ravioli, on the other hand, saved the day. The truffle sauce was maybe the best sauce I've tasted and you could taste the short ribs perfectly.\n\nAll in all, this wasn't a terrible meal but it wasn't what I expected from a quality Italian restaurant."

It was a nice place to be. I was really enjoying my company, atmosphere and ambiance, until the food arrived...\n\nFirst off, the portions were tiny. For the price that I was paying, I felt that the quality didn't justify these costs.

The ravioli that I had for my entree was definitely good, but I felt a bit cheated about the price.\n\nIf you're looking for a good atmosphere to bring a date (and impress them with your spending prowess), I guess this is your place."

So, keep in mind that service level could be inconsistent. \nAll of our food came out at the same time which is nice but execution may have suffered due to this reason.  My pasta dish came out cold and were stuck together, so sauce wasn't well coated through out.   Although flavor of the sauce was good, it took away the potential of this dish. It's an Italian restaurant so, I feel pasta should be done right.  So, the expectation to execute pasta dish will be higher than getting the steak right.  Getting the steak wrong would have been more forgivable. \nOthers in my group had ordered Cioppino and Steaks.  They seemed to enjoy their dish but noted that Cioppino was more like seafood pasta.  \nWith so many options in Vegas, I would keep exploring for a better Italian option, especially if you actually care about the quality and execution. \n\nOverall, it wasn't terrible so it doesn't deserve a \"bad\" rating but certainly wasn't great.

With some difficulty, we ordered glasses of prosecco to enjoy before dinner (The waiter did not offer to take drink orders or provide us with a by-the glass menu). The prosecco failed to arrive until well after our salads, which appeared almost instantaneously.  We had only taken a few bites of our salad, and sips of our prosecco, when the entrees arrived.  Rather than returning them to the kitchen, the waiter pressured us to relinquish our less than half-eaten salads. We didn't put up too much of a fight as the caesar salad was not particularly enticing.  RIght on the waiter's heels, the sommelier appeared with the nice bottle of chardonnay that we had ordered.  It was completely unchilled. Rather than refusing it as we should have, we allowed him to talk us into pouring a small sip with the promise that he would rapidly chill the remainder.  At that point, the waiter, sommelier, and our bottle of chardonnay disappeared into oblivion while we finished our entrees, sans wine.  Only well after we had finished picking at our entrees did the waiter reappear. We had to ask him to please fetch our wine, which he did unapologetically. As you can probably guess, the wine was still completely warm.  He proceeded to pour a glass for each of us and then started to leave with the bottle in hand.  At this point, my wife nearly jumped up to tackle him, fearing that if he escaped with the bottle we would never see him or our warm wine again.  So we were left to drink our nearly full bottle of unchillled chardonnay and laugh about the strange debacle we had just experienced.  Unfortunately, for $200+ there are probably much better comedy acts on the strip.  There are certainly many better dining options."

My boyfriend had talked about Fiamma before, he went to a business dinner there and thought the food was fantastic.  We were staying at the Cosmopolitan and I tried so hard to convince him to have dinner there, but he had his heart set on Fiamma.  We had a reservation, so there wasn't much of a wait.  My boyfriend is German, so when we were greeted by our server with a German accent, they started chatting (in German lol) about their lives, why they were in the US, etc, etc.  I had Kerry's Strawberry Balsamic and OMG was it awesome...actually I had like 2 or 3, but who's counting! We started our meal with beef carpaccio which was so good, but the best was yet to come.  Boyfriend had the seabass, me the petaluma chicken; both meals cooked to absolute perfection, they were so delicious.  We raved basically all night about how good our dinner was.  We hung around for desserts & ended up chatting with another couple who flew from Europe to Vegas; it ended up being a very nice dinner with great conversation, great food and pretty spectacular service."

Probably the best time to try this place out is during restaurant week because they have special prices on 3 course meals.

They don't serve anything our of out the ordinary, drink wise. But when I chill at the bar, a bartender Kerry was back there and made the experience fun.

But the salad maker forgot to put dressing.\n\nWe were waiting for a while and the waitress came and told us that they were remaking the steak bruschetta, because they had burned the first one.\nThen it came out, and we noticed it had no gorgonzola, so we asked for it. The waitress offered to have them apply it, so it went back to the kitchen.\nShe came out a moment later and said the cooks told it was on there, we just didn't see it. Or taste it. So we asked for more. When it came back out, it was delicious. The meat was flavorful and tender. The waitress told us the manager was comping that dish.:)\nOverall, the staff was friendly, and the food was good. Seemed like the kitchen needed to be a little finetuned though."

My dinner tasted amazingly I enjoyed the calamari, my steak was cooked beautifully perfectly seared and seasoned and so juicy and pink an awesome medium rare (oh I loved it!!) and the dessert was great but I was so full by then but the chocolate ganache along with the tiramisu was great together. And all this for a great value of $45 yum! My cousin the lobster gnocchi and it was awesome, that was my second choice, and it was as good as it sounded the lobster pieces were huge very yummy I may have to order that next time. My boyfriend ordered the rigatoni and the pasta was obviously freshly made and it was so very good I enjoyed it also!\n\nSome Negatives: Ohhh this is what killed dinner experience! The service was HORRIBLE!!!!!! It still irritates me to think about it now. We had 9:30 reservations we were seated had to wait a little because my cousin was gambling and we just enjoyed the bread. While we waited our waiter introduced himself and took our drink orders and said he'll be right back when our guest joins us. Well they came within 15 minutes and we never saw our waiter again!! We waited patiently but we were hungry so we stopped the bus boy to see what's holding up our waiter and our nice bus boy said he'd get him but I guess he was too busy so our bus boy took our order, odd I know first time experience especially at a fine dining restaurant but we dismissed it we just cared that our order was taken so that was by 1020pm lets say. Waited waited waited chatted chatted chatted by 1045 we were served our appetizer. Yummy yummy enjoyed finished by 11 something that's all we had?! By that time our patience had run out! My cousin left the dinner table to gamble while we waited that's how long we waited!! We asked our bus boy again, we asked, 'We know your not our waiter, but what's up with dinner.' and he went and took care of it 15 minutes later we got our dinner still just my boyfriend and I were the only ones at the table so we ate and enjoyed. My cousin was still gambling and 10 minutes later our bus boy noticed the food was out and they hadn't gotten back so he offered to put it back under the heaters to keep it warm. How nice is that of him. And as soon as my cousin came back he served the food to them. I was ready fro dessert and asked for it but still took a while to get it =/. And it was by dessert that our waiter had the nerve to serve us and ask how dinner was etc blah blah blah biggest BS no apologies no excuses either!! When I got my dessert we asked for our check also we wanted out by this time it was 1240!!! WTF really?! a 3+ hour dinner?! Anyway, enjoyed dessert we tipped the bus boy personally he was awesome and so helpful he still did his bussing duties while helping us and we paid tab w/ NO tip and left. ERRRR irritation that was horrible service for a $60+ a person! \n\nIdeally, I'd like to go there again for the food but I may be apprehensive with the service."

I actually really liked my lobster gnocchi.  The dish had plenty of delicious lobster and the gnocchi, while not the best I've ever had, was passable.  The servers were also amiable and courteous.  The reason I didn't give this restaurant 4 or 5 stars is that I ordered a simple plate of pasta with butter for my 8 year old daughter.  Yes, it was acceptable, but let's face it.  How do you mess up pasta with butter?  All was going fine until I received the bill.  For a simple plate of pasta with butter, the cost was $24!  I've worked in food service for many years as a dietitian, and also being a mom who does all the grocery shopping for my family, I know that the food cost for this dish was less than $1.  Yes, labor is much more expensive, so let's say, given rent, labor, marketing and whatever other overhead there may be, the dish cost them $10.  So charge me $15 and get a 50% profit (and yes, I've paid $15 for a simple plate of pasta and butter at fancy restaurants).  But $24?  Ridiculous.  When I complained, the server said that it was the minimum charge for a plate of pasta. For reference, my plate of gnocchi with a LOT of lobster cost $32, which was reasonable.  So be warned if you just want something simple for your kids.  This is not the place to go."

The menu looked good, prices reasonable, and the atmosphere intimate but still inviting.  We changed for dinner and were the most dressed there that evening (I had on a dress, my date slacks & a dress shirt, no tie).  The waitstaff was very nice, the ambience pleasant, and the food was good.  My gin & tonic was a bit too strong (he even went and added tonic after I mentioned it and it was still too strong).  A good meal & experience overall and I'll recommend it to anyone looking for a nice place for dinner"

They didn't even have bread for the table or any of the entrees...this is an italian restaurant!  They finally brought us some frozen bread to try to appease us. It was still frozen in the middle.   If you are going to take a reservation at the end of the night, then you should make sure you have the right people there to execute at the level you should be for the type of restaurant you are.

It was indulgent and sweet, loved it.  \n\nMy hubby ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, which were quite unfortunate.

I also got the risotto which was just ok.  \n\nI saw a photo of cr\u00e8me brulee via their yelp reviews so I excitedly ordered that.  It came back not looking at all like a cr\u00e8me brulee.

For a restaurant that's suppose to be fine dining, the hostesses were completely unprofessional. It was very distracting the entire night when the hostesses kept bending down under their stand to stuff their faces with McDonald's that theyhad tucked away. Very classy! \n\nAs for the food, I had the short rib ravioli that was recommend by most and it was very good. My wife had the scallop risotto. The risotto was cooked very well and tasted great but scallops were undercooked. It was still raw in the middle. The portions are quite small, so if you're looking for a bigger meal, I'd order an appetizer as well. There were probably only 10 pieces of ravioli and the only 3 scallops with the risotto. \n\nDessert was fantastic! We had the tirimisu and the nutella bar. \n\nOverall, this place was over priced for the service, quality and atmosphere of the experience. I would not recommend this place."

We decided to get the fall menu which let us choose one apetizer,one entree and came with a dessert trio from their special fall menu. \n\nMy friend chose the fried calamari (with zucchini and deep fried pepperoncino) and I chose the calabrese salad as an appetizer. Both were delicious. The salad was fresh and the mozzarella was so soft it melted in my mouth. I have never had such a delicious calabrese salad before. The calamari was light and not the least bit greasy, and the fried peperoncino was spicy salty goodness that was absolutely addicting! \n\nFor our entrees I chose the spinach and ricotta ravioli with a butter sage sauce, and my friend had the roasted chicken with fingerling potatoes and mushrooms. The ravioli was great. I found the sauce a bit too rich for my taste, but it was still very good. The chicken was mind blowing delicious. The BEST chicken I have ever had. Moist, tender and so flavorful! \n\nThe dessert trio was orgasmic - tiny tiramissu,tarftufo and panna cota - Oh my! All three were great, with the panna cotta being my favorite. \n\nLike I said, the service was amazing - our water was topped off constantly and we were checked on a couple of times to make sure that we were enjoying everything and having a good time.\n\nAll in all a fantastic experience!"

I ordered the special Spaghetti Chitarra and my wife the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. The meatballs for my spaghetti were good but the pasta was extra thick and heavy. My wife's Alfredo was warm at best and lacked flavor.

I usually spend some time researching all of our eating and drinking establishments in Vegas. This one took me one minute after reading the menu and some reviews on Yelp. I did make the reservations through Yelp less then a week before dinning. I thought it would be a \"good\" Italian dinner and off to see the Eagles.\n\nWow-did I underestimate this place! First-it is very modern and sleek. It is a bit loud and full of energy, just like a fun Vegas restaurant should be. There is a bar area where you could have dinner as well.\n\nOur server was fine. He did all the basics but it seemed he might have had too many tables to handle that night. At one point we were looking for him but overall he was acceptable. \n\nWine list was nice and I recognized a Cab. listed only by the glass. We asked and they were happy to get us a full bottle even though it was not normally served that way. It was so nice not to have a hassle when we asked about it and the wine was fantastic.\n\nI started with the beef carpaccio. It was outstanding-some of the best I have ever had. So fresh and full of flavor. My friends each had the pear and blue cheese salad and raved about it. For a main I had the sea bass. Wow-again full of extraordinary flavor and you could taste the freshness. My friends tasted it and I believe they wished they had ordered it. Another main was the salmon and a third had the beef filet 12 oz. (yes-a big piece of meat). I tasted each and they were melt in your mouth good. We didn't have time for dessert as the Eagles were waiting for us.\n\nI knew this would be a good experience but didn't expect a 5 star experience. I highly recommend Fiamma if you are looking for a nice long enjoyable dinner or a quick high quality meal before a show.\n\nOh - and the Eagles concert was 5 stars as well!"

The lobster bisque was good and slightly spicy.  The RAVIOLINI and GNOCCHI with lobster - OMG, to die for!  I can't get over it. The raviolini are filled with short-rib on black truffle cream with a drizzle of red wine reduction - a beautiful dish and I want everyone to try it.  I got the pasta trio with gnocchi, agnolotti and orecchiette.  All three were good but next time I'll just get the gnocchi so I can enjoy more of it.  Soft potato gnocchi goodness swimming in black truffle cream - that alone was good enough but they had to put Maine lobster to it which doubles the goodness.  We also tried the shrimp scallop risotto and fettuccine - they were pretty good.\n\nFor dessert - we tried the cheesecake trilogy, torta al ciocolatto, semifreddo al torrone and tiramisu.  I wanted to try the Nutella gelato since I'm addicted to Nutella but I'm lactose intolerant and still had a concert to go to.  After having amazing entrees, dessert seemed quite boring.

We brought a good central coast Viognier in and the corkage was $35.00.  Wish we had brought the other bottle of wine with us and just forked out the 2nd corkage fee because we ordered a $60.00 bottle of an Italian Red...2002 Sangiovese I think and it was horrid.  With such great food, having some good wine can make all the difference and if it means bringing in something reliable, then do it....most of the decent wine is probably at least about $100/bottle although there are  bottles which are cheaper...and I guess you get what you pay for.\n\nAnyways, more importantly, the food.  Really addicting bread with olive oil, different rustic great taste.  Ordered two appetizers for our party to share....not sure what the ladies had but the guys shared the grilled octopus which was fabulous, touch of sweetness and cooked to perfection.  Couldn't help but sop up some of the juices with the bread.\n\nFor dinner I had the lobster gnocchi which was phenomenal.  I took my time to savor every bite.  Everyone else was extremely pleased with their meals as well. \n\nDidn't have room for dessert but they brought out these little pumpkin cheesecake bites or something...can't remember exactly what they were but they had that sweet pumpkin spice flavor.  \n\nWe thought the dress was business casual, but you can wear nice jeans with a nice dress shirt...and we were told that dress shorts would have been okay too.  \n\nDefinitely will return when I'm in Vegas and will bring a couple of good bottles of wine....maybe three bottles.  ;-)"

The risotto was amazing (if you read my reviews you know by now that I HEART risotto) and the cucumber martini (another fave) was delicious.  \n\nI was not incredibly impressed with the veal ravioli, but the gnocchi was pretty damn impressive.  Everything here is smothered in some type of butter or creamy Italian sauce, which my colleagues loved.  I am a bit biased as I don't go for those foods too often.  If you like creamy and you like savory, this place is for you. \n\nWhy the four stars?  I am biased because my favorite Italian restaurant is in New York...this one did not live up to it but I am not sure which others can!"

However, our service was just ehhhhh. He never greeted us with a smile, don't even remember his name. Never recommended anything on the menu and felt like he didn't even want to be there. Oh well. Would request to be sat more towards the back of the restaurant, bc the noise from the walkway and the casino was a little overpowering...and hearing was hard. We ordered the 12 oz steak, scallops and Risotto and the Short Rib Raviolini. All good but nothing to talk about. There are tons more places to choose from in Vegas, so would prol not go back again."

We were seated immediately for our 5:30 reservation and promptly brought the menus and water. \nAs we were still waiting for one person in our party, the waiter gave us a while to order. He did not seem like the most customer service oriented, but did his job. \nWe started off with the Kobe meatballs and calamari to share. The five of us ordered the Pasta Sampler Trio, Mezzaluna pasta, short ribs, sea bass and the Christmas pre fixe menu (mushroom polenta, duck lasagna and a cheesecake)\n\nThe calamari was light on the batter, with a side of pesto sauce in addition to the traditional marinara, which was delicious. \nThe meatballs were amazing. The seasoning matched the sauce wonderfully and the meat was fresh and not too heavy. \nThe short ribs were tender and juicy. \nThe sea bass was pan seared and just enough crispiness to still taste the flavor.\nThe ravioli in the Mezzaluna was delicious and light! \nThe trio was filled with strong flavors. One was a lobster gnocchi, a sausage pasta and then a short ribs pasta. The lobster gnocchi was inundated with both the creaminess of the gnocchi, with blasts of lobster. The sausage's seasoning was a little overbearing. \n\nDesserts were delicious. The cheesecake was not too sweet, accompanied by a pistachio ice cream. Light and a wonderful way to end the meal. The tiramisu was a perfect tiramisu. Just enough alcohol and chocolate to justify it's tiramisu-ness. \n\nOverall, while the service did not necessarily get me excited, the food (especially the desserts and appetizers) definitely spoke for themselves."

Chef and his staff were very catering to our party's dietary restrictions as we had a dairy allergy and a no gluten/sugar/carb diabetic diet. Chefs most notable dishes to overwhelm my attention were the Grilled Octupus, Meatballs, Burrata & Pesto, cheese and meat boards, short rib plate, steak, and broccolini. The Burrata's creamy, spreadable inside was secured by its firm outer shell. The short rib was so tender, you could cut it simply by looking at it. It was braised in the perfect balance of wine and brown veal stock. The broccolini was cooked al dente with the flavor of fresh garlic, chili flakes, and olive oil. It felt very comforting to notice Chef's table side manor with guests, making sure each dish was cooked to perfection with no room for mistakes. If you are coming to visit Las Vegas or live locally, Fiamma should be on your itinerary. Coming from someone familiar with Italian Restaurants, this is not one to be missed!"

Let me just say thank god it was on the companies tab because food was just OK at best and way too over priced. \n\nThe Resturant was nice the service was good but slow. Don't order the lasagne the blended up meat in it tasted like dog food and don't get the veal it was pounded so thin it was like eating a sheet of batter soaked in oil. We had to stop eating both dishes. \n\nThey get a 3 star because my experience was not bad just a few flaws here and there and I have to credit them even though it took forever to get anything they were extremely busy and like I said thank god the company paid because it was a pretty hefty bill especially with all the drinks and stakes that the rest of us ordered. So that's 3 stars for a couple grand worth of food and we left only partially satisfied is really a good rating. \n\nOf you are wondering if I'll ever go back there ever again the answer is no unless it's free again."

Ambiance - the decor dark wood furniture, along with black and dark orange color scheme is very relaxing and calming.  Perfect for a nice romantic dinner.\n\n2. Great staff - from the hostesses to our waitress, the service was awesome.  We had no reservations, but were seated immediately.  The waitress knew it was our first time dining there and after explaining thoroughly what the specials were, she made wonderful suggestions.  She also came back on numerous occasions to check up on us which was much appreciated.\n\n3.  The FOOD - Excellent.  I thought we had it good in SF, having some great Italian restaurants, but Fiamma totally blew us away.  We ordered the Spaghetti that featured freshly made pasta, a wonderful marinara sauce that was not over powering at all and last but not least, Kobe beef meatballs.  How can you make spaghetti out of this world?  Apparently, by using Kobe beef meatballs!!   We also ordered one of the specials of the night, Veal Ravioli.  This was very good also, with a rich, creamy sauce.  For dessert, I wanted to try the Tiramisu, just to compare to the ones we love in North Beach, SF, but the waitress suggested that we try the Crochettes instead.  As soon as she mentioned that it's made to order and comes hot, we were sold.  They are these donut hole like pieces of heaven that are sprinkled with powdered sugar and comes with 3 different dipping sauces.  One word - AMAZING!\n\nOn the second night, right before we had to go back home, we came back for dinner.  We only had one hour before having to catch the cab to the airport.  After letting the hostess know we had a time constraint, she suggested that we sit at the bar/lounge to receive faster service.  And fast they were!   We were in and out of there in 30 minutes!  I ordered the Gnochhi with lobster, which was nothing less than perfect.  I'm not a gnochii fan, but this might have converted me for life.  The hubby ordered the Ravioli stuffed with short rib and that very close to my veal ravioli.\n\nThis will be our favorite restaurant on the strip from now on!"

Every time.  And you know what?  I'll continue to do so, because I'm comfortable enough in my masculinity (and the knowledge that this outfit buys me a lot of leeway) to accept that the mixologists at this place are the absolute best in the business, and to put my taste buds in their capable hands.  Don't you judge me!\n\nTheir lead vodka jockey, a bloke named Kerry, has apparently won more bartending awards than the amount of planets I've blown up.

I wasted entire solar systems....and then Pixar came around 20 years later and started making CGI that looked better than the real thing and made all my hard work for naught.\n\nAnyways, where was I?  Oh yes, Fiamma.  So they serve a drink here called the raspberry cheesecake which might very well be the finest piece of alcohol I've ever passed through my respirator.  It was so good that I tipped hundreds of dollars just for the damn recipe.  Yes, it's pink.  No, I don't care.  The 6 of you that started joking that I should exchange my black outfit for one that made me look like the Pink Power Ranger learned that lesson the hard way.  After that drink, I typically put myself in the hands of the bartender, letting them pick the drinks.  So what if I squee'd like a little girl when they handed me one that tasted like a damn cinnamon roll?  The 16 of you who laughed at that?  I hope you had great life insurance policies.  That lemony thing that followed?  If the 11 of you who laughed at my drinking of that had instead noticed that I enjoyed it so much that I Force Blackjacked (my new Jedi trick) everybody in the casino instead of sniggering, maybe you'd still be alive right now.  And the 3 of you who decided to poke fun because I gleefully turned Yoda into the equivalent of a Tickle Me Elmo doll after Kerry pushed that red velvet cake flavoured thing in my direction, when did I give YOU permission to laugh?  Was I tickling you under your chin like I was that little green bastard?  NO.  Enjoy your after-life, morons.\n\nSo if I have all this positivity to say about this place, why the 4 star review?  Simple - the food is entirely forgettable.  Pass on it entirely.  Force Float your way to the bar (you *do* know how to Force Float, right?), sit down, decline the menu, and drink.  Then go across the hall to craftsteak for dinner.  \n\nSome of you may have noticed the bodycount is only at 36.  Well that's because Dave from St. Paul Minnesota is reading this review right now and saying \"What a pansy that guy Darth is.  Fruity drinks?  Come on!\".  Yes, I hear you, Dave.

The place is very modern, chic with low lighting for a definite ambiance. I liked that we got seated at the front of the restaurant because the decor of the wall has space that opens out so you can do some serious people watching while enjoying your food.  We ordered the calamari appetizer\n\nI ordered the spring tasting menu which consisted of a starter, entree and dessert all for $45.  Pretty damn good deal, especially since all categories had something for me.  I picked the caesar salad for starter, which was very tasty, the beef short ribs, VERY delicious.  It was a huge portion, bone in, fell right off the bone and the meat just melted in your mouth.  For an italian place, it was up there of my list of delicious braised short ribs places.  The panna cotta for dessert was also quite good.  It was firm and not soupy, and the honey added a nice sweet surprise since panna cotta is usually not the most flavorful dessert.  I didn't care too much for the caramelized figs that scattered about the plate...pretty but I'm just not a fig person.  This is my second time at this place and it's one not to disappoint."

The only reason I am giving 4 stars is that our service was a little slow and our waiter didn't seem to have his act together.  Other than that, our party of 8 was very pleased with the food."

We had dinner reservations at the Sushi place across the street.  As the reservation was late, we went to Fiamma for appetizers and drinks.  We were very happy with the seafood platter, it came with Oysters(we asked for more over shrimp), Lobster sashimi, Crab legs and Tuna sashimi.  I had a beer and the person I was with had a wine.  It was among one of the better appetizers we had and honestly, I'm not sure we wouldn't have enjoyed our meal more had we stayed at Fiamma, thumbs up!."

We also got the buffata mozzarella that came with these really great sweet red bell peppers and prosciutto.  both were excellent.  The risotto balls were crisp on the outside, inside was perfect as well.  the mozzarella was fresh and melted in my mouth.\n\n2nd course - after reading all the yelp reviews, we both got the lobster gnocchi.  it definitely lives up to the hype and surpasses it.  The sauce is amazing and not overpowering, they gave huge pieces of lobster meat and the gnochhi was perfectly cooked.\n\n3rd course - fillet of beef and the braised short rib.  By this time the boyfriend and I were starting to feel like we were going through food coma.  the short rib was succulent and melded well with the mashed potatoes.  the flirt had a great sauce on top and was cooked perfectly.\n\n4th course - the dessert was the standard one that's given (no choice).  It was a pana cotta with figs and a balsamic honey as well as a chocolate dome thing that had ice cream in it and chocolate and hazelnuts with it.  The pana cotta was a slight disappointment, but the balsamic honey sauce was really great.  The chocolate dessert was great though, however I felt that it didn't compare to the other 3 courses.\n\nService was excellent.  They were so attentive, and asked up front whether we needed to be somewhere soon.  Since we weren't seeing a show, we definitely took our time and they paced out the dinner perfectly, including the 10 minute \"breather\" my boyfriend and I needed between the main course and dessert.\n\nAll in all, if I had the money, I would go to Fiamma every time I'm in Vegas...until then I'll save it for special occasions."

I ordered the shrimp risotto with jumbo sea scallops, and while there was a decent amount of risotto, there were no more than 5 dime-sized shrimp all on one side of the dish, and the scallops were medium size- about the size of a quarter.  Worse yet, they had cut them in half putting the bronzed side up to make it look like more, so the three scallops I was looking at were only 1.5 scallops, and weren't even as thick as my pinky finger.  What was there tasted good even lukewarm, which is why I've given two stars rather than one, but the menu was a complete overstatement of the dish.\n\nThe couple in our group that had ordered the prix menu had to hail the waiter over to get their dessert and check so that they could make their 10 pm show, the rest of us, clearly also ready, had to hail him again after he disappeared after taking care of them (they did make their show, but missed some of the pre-show).  The other thing that really bugs me is that we were seated there over 2 and a half hours, saw a manager around, but they never approached our table for the standard \"how is everything\".\n\nIf you insist on going to this restaurant (and with so many wonderful options in Vegas, I don't know why you would), do NOT go with 6+ people- it was very apparent from the evening that the servers were guaranteed their 18% automatic tip for groups, and thus completely blew us off."

I ordered the Damiliano Lecinquevigne 2009 (my favorite year) Barolo wine and it was fantastic with the lobster gnocchi. A reason for a 4 star instead of 5?

I didn't taste the balsamic in the martini, but it was tasty nonetheless.  \n\nBread basket is lovely with crunchy sticks, a cheesy cracker, and traditional french bread.  Excellent, flavorful olive oil for dipping.\n\nCarpaccio and calamari to start.  Carpaccio had a pungent mustard drizzled on top and was speckled with caviar - melted like butter in your mouth.  The calamari has extra crispy zucchini bits and surprisingly zingy pepperocinis mixed in with the lightly coated perfectly cooked and seasoned squid.  It was served with two dipping sauces.  A great execution of a crowd pleasing classic.  \n\nFor entrees, we had raviolini, gnocchi, sea bass, and braised short ribs.  The best gnocchi you will ever have!  The delicate pillows were enveloped in truffly lobstery goodness.  The raviolini was stuffed with the same braised beef short ribs; however, it was a good thing we also had the short rib entree.  The sauce on the raviolini overpowered the beef; it was delicious nonetheless.  The shor ribs exceeded your wildness braised beef dreams.  So meaty.  The sea bass was cooked nicely and served with potatoes and mushrooms but was forgettable.  \n\nWe finished off with warm doughnuts, lattes, and moscato.  The service was sweet, unobtrusive and attentive.  \n\nBe sure to treat yourself to some Fiamma but be prepared for it to be a treat.  Bill was close to $300 for 4 of us.  Not overpriced for the quality of food and service but more than your average family dinner."

I think I can say that with conviction because I ate at Wolfgang two nights ago.\n\nWe ordered the pan seared Ahi & the traditional potato gnocchi.  Both dishes were IMO w/o fault.  Well, maybe the veggie terrine was slightly non complimentary with the ahi dish, but the flavours of everything we ordered were great.  The tuna was JUST seared leaving a lot of the flesh uncooked (just the way they should be IMO).\n\nIf I had to write my review on the gnocchi, it'd be another page.  Gnocchi, lobster, black truffles -- how can you POSSIBLY go wrong with a dish like this?\n\nService was excellent.  I had a flight to catch at 9pm; we sat down at 7:30 and told our server on our timeline.  We were outta the resto by 8:20 and we ate at what I'd think quite a leisurely pace.  Which means the food came out pronto."

They were one of the only restaurants still open.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nDim lighting with cool techno/house music, and very trendy decor.  My kind of place!\n\nFOOD:\nLinguine with lobster & scallops - This was the special of the night... Have pasta?  I WILL eat it!  The seafood was fresh and done in a pink sauce which I absolutely LOVED, and the pasta was cooked perfect.  Total oral orgasm!  $45 but so worth it.\n\nNew York steak - My partner's choice.  Medium-rare, super delish & tender.  Average price at $38.\n\nSERVICE:\nWe walked in without reservations at midnight and got seated immediately.  Our server was friendly.  Food service was fast.\n\nTIP:\nThey normally close at 11pm but stayed open late due to the concert letting out in the Grand Garden Arena.\n\nOVERALL:\nGreat food and good service."

Really bad choice. \nSo here's how it went...\nWas greeted and seated, and everything looked and seemed so right. Everyone was friendly, and I just knew that it was going to be great. \nMy wife got a pear martini, and I got a cucumber martini, and both were good. \nThey brought out bread while we waited for our starter of calamari. The bread was refrigerator cold. Ok, no problem still feeling good. \nThe calamari came out, and I was happy to see it. I took a bite, and so did my wife. The flavor of the breading was good, but the calamari was rubbery. Not a little rubbery it was like a thinly perfectly sliced Goodyear tire rubbery. \nMy wife and I just kind of picked at it. Neither of us really commented on it for a while until I said \"it's a little rubbery huh\"? She gave me that oh yea look. \nOnto our much anticipated dinner. My wife ordered the seasonal risotto, which was saffron risotto w crab meat (sounds really good). I ordered the braised short rib. Why did my wife's risotto not only look like a mix of oatmeal and Kraft Mac and cheese, but also taste like it? I mean it looked like an old, dry, clump of oatmeal that somehow took on a yellow color. Ok, I thought when I saw it and the look on her face, maybe it somehow tastes good. Nope. It really didn't. It tasted like what I described, along w the taste of 4 hour thawed warm crab essence. Disgusting. \nOnto their \"big deal\" braised short rib. The plate looked like I put it together trying to fancy at home. Pretty lackluster. Bit into the short rib and yea the meat texture was fine, but the flavor was like a Hormel canned pot roast. I'm kind of wondering if the people that cooked this really think that their food is good, almost like they are from an alternate universe where bad food tastes good and...well, just look at the pictures. I was trying to be in good spirits and took them thinking that maybe they would taste better than they looked. \nI'm not even trying to just pile on at this point. \nThe server was nice, the restaurant looked nice, and the drinks were alright. \nThe best thing that I had though, and this is no exaggeration, was the water. \nI can't give it more than one star, I wanted to give it 2 because of the service being so good, but it was just that bad."

While it is a neat thing to have and even fun to pose with friends for professional photos, the pricing was never mentioned and when she showed up with the printed photo books at the table there was a lot of pressure to buy. She was obviously disappointed that we weren't going to buy them as evidenced by her body language, and it cast a negative shadow on the evening. Besides this mishap the restaurant was wonderful."

The service was great, and server really had a positive attitude and it made it really fun to dine there. The restaurants atmosphere was a bit of dim lighting, great for group dinners or a date night in vegas. We shared a few dishes and it was plenty for us to eat. For starters we ordered their CAESAR SALAD, and I kind of wished that I asked for dressing on the side. Honestly, I am not much of a dressing person so  don't take this to heart. I enjoyed the salad and it was just a bit on the dressier side for my taste. For main dishes we ordered the HOMEMADE FETTUCCINE with prawns, creamy basil pesto, and yummy toasted pine nuts. The pine nuts were a great touch to add to the basil pesto sauce, and it wasn't too creamy or heavy to eat. Our last dish we ordered their RISOTTO with SHAVED TRUFFLE. I think it was part of their season menu, and it was well worth it. Risotto was cooked perfectly, and the truffle on top was just a nice topper.... We were already full.. but decided... mehhhh why not.. LET'S GET DESSERT! For dessert we ordered their TIRAMISU & CREME BRULEE. FYI.. nothing was left. Enough said. Restaurant was great, service was great, our experience was wonderful and I would definitely come back again. I would highly recommend ordering what's on their seasonal menu, because it seems like they really know what their doing. ENJOY!"

This past time, I waited for 45 minutes to receive my entrees, and my drinks were empty for the majority of the meal.  Other times that I have been here, the service has been attentive and friendly.\n\nThe restaurant is located in the MGM and has a beautiful dining room.  It is dimly lit and has a great atmosphere.  The server greeted us shortly after we sat down and took our order.  When I asked him for recommendations, he recommended the short ribs, the short rib raviolini and the lobster gnocchi.  We wound up ordering the Pistachio Crusted Grilled Shrimp appetizer, the Caesar Salad, the Raviolini and the Gnocchi.\n\nThe shrimp came out and were delicious, although they had a fairly scant amount of pistachios dusting them.  It was served with a delicious sauce, made of tomatoes and olives.  The shrimp were cooked through and were large and plump.  \n\nThe Caesar salad was delicious.  The dressing was garlicky and was fairly standard, but the croutons made this salad memorable.  I am not usually a crouton fan, but my companion and I fought over who got the last one.\n\nThe entrees, which took an additional ten minutes to arrive after our server said that they would be out in just a minute, were okay.  Well, one was good, and one earned my \"Never Again\" award.\n\nThe Raviolini was deceptive.  The portion looked small.  The stuffed pasta looked danty, as well as delicious.  And it was definitely delicious.  But dainty it ain't.    More like stick to your (braised short) ribs filling.  These suckers are enough to make two meals out of.  They had a delicious, intense flavor.  Their meaty goodness had me salivating over them.  I would return for these, but I am not sure that I would wait as long as I did for them again.  If you go, order this.  Don't order the atrocity that I review next.\n\nThe lobster Gnocchi, one of the proclaimed house specialties, was so disappointing, that if I had seen my waiter in the first ten minutes after the food had been delivered, I would have said something.  The gnocchi was overcooked and had the consistency of glue.  The sauce appeared to have been broken.  There was a thin layer of oil on top of what otherwise appeared to be a delicious sauce.  The menu billed it as having truffle in it, but truffle was not evident in the taste.  The five small pieces of lobster were flavorful.  I just wish there had been a little more.\n\nWhen the server removed our plates, he didn't even acknowledge that apart from the lobster, my gnocchi was barely touched.  \n\nI rated this location the way I did based on numerous visits, so it scored higher than I would have scored it based on this visit alone."

It's not overly formal, but not too casual either.  It's also not too noisy so you and your company can definitely have conversations without needing to scream into each other's ears.\n\nThe wine selection is pretty wide.  They are true to their culture and focus mostly on Italian wines, all of which have been delicious, for the ones that I have tried at least. Should definitely check out the sparkling wines or dessert wines if your pocketbook can afford it.  :-)\n\nThe food is nothing short of AMAZING!  Even something as simple as cold cuts and cheese was enough to impress me.  The ingredients are fresh and unique, nothing you'd normally find in a typical grocery market.  I think they marinated the olives and many other foods themselves, so the flavors you're getting from this place is definitely not something you can find just anywhere else!\n\nI tried 2 or 3 different types of pasta from this location and loved each one of them.  The chefs here pair special sauces for different types of pasta, each sauce focusing on the reduction of various alcohols like brandy or vodka.  Anyone can make pasta sauce, but to make it where you can actually taste/feel out all the flavors of the ingredients and appreciate the way it complements the pasta, that is rare.  This place definitely inspired me to experiment and be more creative with my pasta sauces in the future!\n\nI had this a few years ago, so I can't remember how to describe it, but I remember that the calamari was to die for!\n\nThe service was great!  Food came out really fast, and the servers were good about refills and clearing empty plates to make room for the next course.\n\nPricing is a little expensive, but it's also not outrageous.  For the quality and quantity of the food you're getting, I'd say it's fair.  Probably not somewhere you'd want to eat at everyday, but it's definitely affordable for those special dates."

            "review": "When it comes to high-end or upscale Italian food, I generally end up disappointed and underwhelmed. Ferraro's, Zefferino, Valentino, and Sirio are a few examples that come to mind. The problem I find with this type of restaurant is that it is hard to justify the expensive price tag for usually small dishes of food that are typically decent but not great. In addition, if you consider that the majority of restaurants in the Strip casinos overcharge you for mediocre food, then the odds of a satisfying experience do not appear very promising. However, I am glad to report that Fiamma is one of the few that successfully bucks that trend.\n\nI have dined here several times, but except for weekends, it is rarely crowded. Even at peak times, it is usually a short wait for a table without a reservation. Kind of unusual for a restaurant of this caliber, but who's complaining?\n\nSome of the appetizers I've sampled include the Mista di Campo (mixed green salad), calamari, and beef carpaccio with truffle oil. They are all very good, but the highlights are the entrees and dessert.\n\nHere are some of our favorites:\n\nThe Cappellacci di Brasato (short rib ravioli, black truffle crema, Barbera wine reduction) is a delight: a generous serving size of al dente cooked pasta with tender short rib filling, and an intoxicating truffle aroma. Need I say more?\n\nMy wife loves gnocchi, and their Gnocchi All'Aragosta (Maine lobster, mushrooms and black truffle) is one of her favorite preparations. The pillowy soft gnocchi are cooked just right.\n\nFor the heartier appetite, their Brasato di Manzo con Risotto (braised short rib in Chianti wine with parmesan risotto and red onion marmalade crouton) is very tender, tasty, and filling.\n\nNow on to dessert.\n\nThe Crochette (crispy amaretti and ricotta doughnuts with hazelnut, chocolate and strawberry dipping sauces) is very good and great for sharing.\n\nThe mascarpone panna cotta with white balsamic honey, dried mission figs, and marcona almonds is FANTASTIC. Actually, I don't even usually like panna cotta, but their version, my friends, is the best panna cotta I have ever had by far. A friend of mine loves it so much that a couple of times he even ordered two panna cottas for himself! As much as I wanted to let my inner glutton loose (when the occasion warrants it), one panna cotta is enough for me.\n\nI don't mind paying a premium when the food is this good. That being said the prices are reasonable for what you get. For example, the short rib ravioli is $24 and the panna cotta is $12. Recent discounts for locals make it an even better value. In the past, many of the MGM Grand restaurants offered buy one get the second entree free. Their current locals offer is free dessert and an after dinner drink with purchase of an entree.\n\nThe combination of delicious food, very good service, reasonable value, a modern and trendy but relaxed ambience, and short wait times make this place a winner in my book. Thank you Fiamma for restoring my faith in Italian fine dining."

Fiamma Trattoria & Bar is one of those restaurants that could easily be lost in the shuffle of many great Vegas establishments.  Yet, this little restaurant that is tucked away behind the casino of MGM Grand can offer rich flavors like no other.\n\nFor appetizers, we order the Beef Carpaccio.  It came with thinly sliced beef tenderloin topped with arugula, mushroom, and permesan cheese. \n\nThe popular Lobster Gnocchi came with classic Italian gnocchi that is just the right texture, not too soft or too chewy.  The lobster meat tasted fresh and cooked perfectly.  This dish definitely packs a punch of rich flavors, although it might get a little overwhelming at the end.\n\nI also tried the Braised Short Rib.  It was very tender and again, very rich in flavor.  The rib was placed on top of mashed potato so the flavor of the rib actually got into the mashed potato, which I like.  \n\nAll in all, a very good and hearty meal, which could be hard to find on the Strip.

I called up that day and asked for a 6:30 reservation. When I changed it to 7 a few hours later, the hostesses were accommodating as well. \nIt was a little family get together celebrating my daughter's fifth birthday early.  We mentioned it to both the hostess and our server (Gabriel from Dayton NV). \n\nAmbiance:  Dark wood / dim lighting/ modern but had warmth.   People were dressed  both to the nines and also casual formal (like a country club vibe)\n\nDrinks: I tasted The pear martini. And it was delicious! Not too sweet, strong and smooth.\n\nAppetizers:  We ordered the calamari which had plenty of tentacles (love) and some fried zukes too. It was served with a garlicky lemon aioli sauce which was yummy! \nThen a little complimentary appetizer showed up.  Pita bread, olive, artichokes, cheese and Italian meat platter.  What a nice surprise for my daughter!  How nice!\n\nSoup: I ordered a potato leek soup.  Creamy and I can taste both the potato and the leeks.  There were fried mozzarella balls in them. Overall, it was good but a tad heavy for me.\n\nEntrees:  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, the parents ordered the raviolini.  My husband ordered the meat lasagna and my daughter ordered a chicken dish.  There were no children at the restaurant so, they did not have a children's menu.  They said the kitchen usually had an option for pasta.  But, our server, Gabriel asked and they decided to make her a rosemary chicken breast, mashed potatoes and a wine reduction (on the side).  Again** How thoughtful!  She would have accepted the pasta just fine but this made her feel super special.\n\nAnyways, the chicken plate came out first, and then we waited for a while for our entrees to come out.  It was actually a long time.  Gabriel came to apologize for the delay.  I joked to the family that maybe our food got dropped/they had to run to the store to pick u some extra lasagna sheets or they had lost our ticket.  But then the managers came out to apologize as well.  After about 45 minutes of waiting, the managers brought out all of foods.\n\nIt was well worth the wait!\nI'm unsure of the lasagna or the raviolini (although everyone raved about it)\nbut my lobster gnocchi was perfect! Soft and pillowy and lightly creamy!\nWhile the adults were eating our entrees, they came out with a cupcake for my daughter and we quietly sang her happy birthday.  (Quietly, because this wasn't applebees or anything!)\n\nWhen we finished, our tables got cleared and we were waiting for our check. But instead, Gabriel showed up with four glasses of dessert wine and my daughter got a special drink as well with cherries in the same glass as ours.  She felt like such a grown up!\nWhile we were enjoying our little treat, Gabriel showed up again with a tri of desserts!\nCr\u00e8me Brulee (so delicious and creamy! A cheesecake with a marscapone whipped cream and a chocolate mouse cake with another candle to sing to my daughter!!    What did we do to deserve this besides waiting for our entr\u00e9e??  \n\nMy daughter's eyes lit up and she said she felt like a princess.  We all pretty much did.  We don't go out to fancy places very often and this was such a wonderful time and meant a lot to our family.   I knew the food was going to be super, but I wasn't too sure about the service since I had read the negative reviews.  I'm so happy this wasn't the case at all!\n\nEverything was wonderful!  I hope to be back again soon"

So it is safe to say that I really loved this place.\n\nThe restaurant is decorated in a downright sexy way.  It is really truly beautiful inside.  I would recommend it to anyone that loves to dine with their eyes and their mouths.  \n\nThe prices were outlandish, I know it's Vegas, but still, so that is one star off.  But the service was amazing, the food was great, and I would definitely recommend the kobe meatballs and spaghetti.  I really enjoyed it."

He had the gnocchi and it was just okay. Our server was attentive and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. We were in a bit of a rush so we literally just ate and ran. From the 45 minutes we were there, I thought the ambiance was pretty nice. It's a big open space and it was packed on a Thursday night. I will definitely be back if I am ever at MGM. Yummmmmy!"

For the price it was great, if I had paid more I would have basically concluded, \"yeah, yeah, Vegas is overpriced, so what else is new?\" But at $30 this was a great deal. We both had the grilled octopus - nice and tender but maybe too grilled - lots of smoke overpowered the delicate flavor of the octopus. It was in a Lirovnese sauce - heavy tomato and oregano, again not leaving any seafood flavor. Still, not bad. Then, we both had the skirt steak, we asked for it rare because no one can ever do rare in a restaurant, so you'll probably get it medium rare. But they delivered! If anything, my steak was a little undercooked (closer to \"blue\") but my partner's was perfect. Skimpy on the accompaniments - just a little mashed potato -but the steak was delicious. One problem - it's a huge restaurant, if you cook rare meat, it doesn't get all that hot. By the time our server got to it and got it to us, it was barely warm. But I suppose that's how it's going to be in a restaurant like this. One dessert, the tartufo was delicious, but the other, the panna cotta, was really fantastic. We sprung for the $20 wine pairings - two of the three wines were great, the other pretty good, and the pourings generous. Again, for the price this was a great deal."

She also had a glass of wine which she loved.   Staff was very nice and inviting.  I asked if they had any bar snacks we could order but only offered bread right away.  We sat in dinning room were the other couple joined us.  Every aspect was on point.  We had the Caprses salad which was amazing! Calamari was on point as well.   Our bar server relayed to our dinning room server what wine my GF loved.  He suggested a bottle, guess what? Cha-Ching! Bring the bottle.  Nice touch by the staff on communicating.  Entrees where very good we had a mixture of Pesto Ravioli and other dishes.  Here is where the FIFTH star comes in....We asked for something spicy; sauce, red crushed peppers, anything.  They said they did not have anything....the servers assistant, his name is Sammy returned 2 minutes later with diced fresh jalapenos from the kitchen.  Great right?? It gets better, he went to a neighbor restaurant and got a bottle of hot sauce for us.  Brand new seal in tact.  I could go on about how great the food was but Service is where its at for us!

I'm firmly in the 3-star camp, with this helpful tip: Wolfgang Puck's Bar & Grille across the casino has better Italian food. No, really.\n\nFiamma doesn't quite get it right. The sauces are a bit too heavy and thick, Our bread basket had stale -- yes, stale -- breads. Unacceptable. How about a gentle squeeze before bringing that basket out to the tables?\n\nThe meat & cheese plate was uninspired, the caesar was drenched, and the lasagna was a goopy mess. The house-made spaghetti had an odd texture, and even though the waiter insisted the San Marzano tomatoes were from the bucolic farms of San Marzano (no freakin' way), I sensed the redolence of 'can.'\n\nHowever, thumbs up for the mascarpone creme brulee, and the coffee was quite good.\n\nSo amble on over to Wolfgang's for real italian."

I ordered the Rigatoni with Sausage & Prosciutto and although it wasn't the worst dish ever, it wasn't worth $28. Maybe I just did a bad job at choosing a more appetizing entree and maybe it's cuz we pretty much rushed through dinner to go clubbin afterwards, but I don't think I'd return. There were some Nathan hotdogs calling out to me right down the hall..."

We stayed at MGM so we preferred to dine in house. Fiamma it was!\n\nLet's talk dress code. We dressed up, I would say to above what they require as the dress code, so to see people walk in with super casual dress on was a little off-putting.\n\nWe did not make a reservation but we were able to get a table right away.\n\nThe ambiance of Fiamma is gorgeous. Dark, clean and sexy. The music is not too loud at all, though we were seated further to the back, so the music from the casino wasn't so obvious. Speaking of seats, we were seating at a not so great table initially, and my husband asked if we could be moved to a cozier seat. The host happily moved us, but this seemed to put our server a little out of shape.\n\nMy husband mentioned that it was my birthday and we were given glasses of prosecco on the house, which was nice. The bread basket was fine, we both really loved the cheese crispy bread (for want of a better description!). I ordered a starter of butternut squash soup, garnished with spinach and shrimp (but I held the shrimp). We got mezzaluna ravioli with a tomato sauce and a fettucini with pancetta, shaved garlic and mushrooms. The soup was smooth and a little creamy, and the spinach was a lovely addition. My husband enjoyed his ravioli, and my fettucini was delicious. I haven't had pancetta for a while so it was a little treat. The servings are pretty generous we were both satisfied with our meal.\n\nThe service - Our server did not seem happy to be there at all. He was listless and gave the appearance of being annoyed at any requests or questions. He was overly attentive, in a way. He checked on us seemingly every few minutes, but seemed to not really be invested in how we were doing, more like he was checking out of habit? He just gave me a weird vibe. We also had other managers checking on us constantly, which made actually enjoying the meal and the company of my husband a little difficult. Lastly, our server seemed annoyed that we did not want to order dessert or coffee.\n\nOverall - The food and ambiance was lovely, the service was a little off-putting."

With that being said, we were also paying for service and atmosphere. Fiamma delivered on both for my group of 13's recent visit.\n\nI was worried this would be the type of restaurant that doesn't provide bread. Luckily that was not the case, as my group was thoroughly able to enjoy the sourdough olive bread and twisted rolls. The two spreads were much more exciting than butter, although I don't recall exactly what they were. \n\nA few us split the burrata with roasted red pepper. It's a good thing we split it because it was actually a decent portion of cheese. We had to use some of the above mentioned rolls once we depleted the supply of bread that came with the appetizer. The burrata was a little bland, but I believe that's just how burrata is by nature. \n\nFor my main, I had the Mezzaluna. I can't believe I paid $24 for a pasta dish, but I can't say no to pesto. It was definitely unique to me, as I've never had basil filled pesto. The cherry tomato sauce was more exciting than a traditional tomato or marinara, and the aged ricotta was a nice touch. In the end of the day, it was just a ravioli dish. \n\nI also had a glass of \"Ronco del Cero\" Sauvignon Blanc that I didn't care for too much. That's on me for ordering a Sauv Blanc from Italy when I prefer them from New Zealand. \n\nWe were stuffed and had a long night of drinking ahead of us so passed on the dessert. \n\nSo my group had a lovely time and enjoyed the food. Fiamma doesn't return a return visit in my personal opinion."

Our entrees took a little while to come out (about a half hour), but we weren't in a hurry, so it was not that big of a deal.  They give you a very short wine list with some wines by the glass and popular bottles.  But, they have a pretty good list available, you just have to ask for it.  To start, I had the lobster bisque, which was a special that evening.  I did not care for it.  The vegetables were too crisp and the broth was more like a weak tomato sauce rather than a nice sherry broth.  But, the server took it back no questions asked and it was not on the bill.  So, even though the soup didn't work for me it didn't ruin the meal.  The wife had the caprese salad which was large.  The tomatoes were juicy and the mozzarella had a burrata quality, it was very creamy.  Also, there was a lot of fresh basil, which we love.\n\nFor dinner, the wife had the risotto with scallops and shrimp.  This dish includes 3 large shrimp and 2 scallops.  The scallops were much better than the shrimp, they were seared well and were buttery in flavor.  It's not that the shrimp were bad, but there certainly wasn't anything special about them.  The risotto was in a cream sauce, and it was cooked perfectly.  It still had a bite to it, and you get quite a bit.  Even with me helping, she didn't come close to finishing her meal.\n\nI had the pasta special, which was fusilli with mushrooms, prosciutto, and peas in a parmesan cream sauce.  It was topped with a lot of shaved white truffles, they basically covered the entire dish.  The sauce with rich and had a lot of cheese flavor, but it could have used some pepper.  The pasta was pillowy and the sauce filled every nook and cranny.  I loved this dish, it was the best pasta I'd had in a long time.\n\nOur server was fantastic, as was the sommelier.  They were very attentive, and when we told our server we didn't want dessert, he still brought us out a little ice cream topped with espresso and whipped cream.  We mixed them up and they were like little milkshakes.  We had excellent pasta and a wonderful evening, we absolutely recommend Fiamma."

We ordered two cocktails. Both dirty martini's with blue cheese stuffed olives, they were good but not the best martini I have ever had. \nLet me secondly say that the food was delicious. We ordered the beef carpaccio, and tomato caprese with shrimp. It was fantastic. \n\nWe opted to not have dessert as the rest of our party was ready to go out so we decided to get the bill. Are you ready....,\n\nThe bill. I understand this is Vegas and food drinks are marked up. I'm totally fine with that. However, our martini's were $12 which isn't that crazy but the crazy thing is the server up charged us a total of 4 times to the tune of $4 each for our blue cheese olives. There was 2 olives in each drink. So each olive was $4. Absolutely appalling. Never would I ever pay that for olives. Unless of course they were dipped in gold. Which they certainly weren't. It became one of the jokes of our trip. That up charge took our martini total to $20 each drink. Would have even been more understandable had I had belvedere or grey goose, but I didn't. \n\n\nAfter talking to the manager he also agreed how absolutely ridiculous that is. He promptly removed some of the olive charges. Sure that was better but it was annoying that I had to say anything at all. I don't like to complain while out to eat. Especially about a bill. \n\nSo all in all beware while dining and watch for ridiculous up charges that the servers or restaurant are trying to slide in there."

That was a clue already.\n\nWe ordered the lasagna and the trio.  I could not believe how bad the trio was, all starch and hardly any meat.  It was just poorly made.  It didn't taste fresh, more like it was just heated up.  Soggy groose pasta. The lasagna was okay, nothing special but it was worth more like $15 at most.\n\nTwo strikes for the hotels in the back alley of MGM (Shibuya and Fiamma)."

I told my husband to choose somewhere to eat for his belated birthday and he chose Fiamma. \n\nI love the decor. I love chic places. It was also nice to see a little reception dinner for a newly married couple. I've always contemplated a Vegas wedding. The tab would be under a grand. Nice! Anyway, dinner was awesome. The hostess brought us to our table pretty quickly and they even accommodated us when we wanted to move to a booth. The server jokingly said \"no PDA but under the table stuff is fine\". It was really romantic. A nice getaway from Christmas craziness. We ordered cocktails. The hubs had the Fiamma \"The Original\" and I had the Pineapple Upside Down Cake. The drinks were pretty tasty. Order the Caprese to share. When I order Caprese I don't expect much but some buffalo mozzarella and sliced tomatoes. When the salad came out it was colorful. Chopped up yellow and red tomatoes, strips of basil, and soft buffalo mozzarella and some awesome tasty green sauce. I ordered the Raviolini which is amazing shortrib ravioli with black truffle goodness. It was super good as the pasta was al dente. My husband ordered the Orecchiette. Both of our entrees were good tasting and totally worth it. Prior to dinner we told the server where we were from and that we were celebrating my husband's birthday (even it was a week before). We ordered the Crocchette for dessert which were little donuts made of Amaretto and Ricotta and dipping sauce. The server was so nice he brought us out glasses of champagne and even made a little Happy Birthday display with a candle for my hubs.\n\nThe service was top notch and our server was super personable. He was really attentive to us even when the restaurant was close to closing. Overall experience was fabulous. If you have a hard time deciding on the millions of restaurants to eat at in Vegas and feel like Italian, come to MGM and try it out. Pricey but totally worth the food quality, ambiance, and service."

Only 1 out of 3 folks finished their order.  The portions are very generous and the prices were pretty decent compared to the other places we visited in Vegas.\n\nThe only knock on this place would be the service.  It took too long for the food to come out and our waiter was not as attentive as I believe he should have been.  \n\nEveryone on our group ranked this restaurant as one of the top restaurants on our trip, and we ate at several great restaurants, so I would definitely visit it again the next time we visit Vegas."

Each drink was extremely well made with fresh ingredients and reputable spirits.  The quality of the cocktails were definitely worth the price, especially considering the fact we were dining on the strip.  The restaurant could have charged more for their specialty cocktails if they really wanted to.\n\nFrom there we had the Carpaccio and calamari as appetizers.  The Carpaccio was perfectly executed and a great way to start the meal.  The calamari is one of the best I've ever eaten.  Evenly coated, crispy throughout and perfectly seasoned.  Fried zucchini and pepperoncini are tossed with the calamari.  In my personal opinion the sauces served with the calamari are superfluous.  Amazing dish.\n\nFiamma has an excellent selection of wines by the glass, which are also priced very reasonably considering the quality that is offered.  The thing I like most about the wine selection is the different pour sizes offered.  4oz. or 6oz.  The 6 oz. pour was perfect for me and my wife to split for each course.  Standard pours can get too expensive and get you too tipsy if you're going to pair a different glass with each course. \n\nFor entrees we seemed to have ordered the restaurants most popular items.  The Gnocchi with lobster and truffles, the Short Rib Ravioli, Braised Short Ribs, and the Mediterranean Sea Bass.  We shared everything so everyone could try the different dishes which were all excellent.  The Braised Short Ribs and the Gnocchi stood out the most and I highly recommend these two items.\n\nOur stomachs were stuffed to capacity, but we ordered dessert anyways.  Our genius plan was to order a small dessert for the four of us to share so not to make ourselves more uncomfortable.  So we decided on the doughnuts with chocolate and caramel dipping sauce.  The portion was huge; the four of us could barely finish the dessert after that meal.  Unfortunately the doughnuts were so good, that we couldn't stand leaving any leftovers so we forced ourselves to devour every last delicious bite."

My group had an awful experience which ruined the evening while the other group had an alright experience and at least was able to get out in time to see their show.  They were able to get out in a respectable two hours while it took us about three with several people having to rush out to catch their show.\n\nWhen we got there, it took the waiter about 20 minutes to simply take our drink order and maybe another 20 minutes later we had to flag the waiter down from across the room to get him to take our food order.  The food took an incredibly long time to get there and when it got there the lucky few that had warm food had good food while everyone else had luke warm to cold food.\n\nAfter the food came out came more waiting.  The four people that had to get to a show again flagged the waiter down and got him to offer them dessert.  The odd thing was we were all obviously finished with our dishes yet only they were offered desserts.  Shortly after their desserts came out with their checks and then our waiter disappeared again.\n\nOne of the people left got the tasting menu and she was due dessert and all the rest of us were waiting to be offered a dessert menu (the waiter of course took the menus after taking the others orders).  Again, we sat for a really long time until we finally saw the waiter again and flagged him down.\n\nAt this point we were just ready to go so we asked for our check and reminded him that one person still had a dessert coming.  He completely ignored her, didn't say sorry or even acknowledge the mistake, he just left again.  Luckily he ended up bringing the dessert with the checks but again, no sorry whatsoever.\n\nOne final time we sit and wait with our checks until he finally took them and we were finally able to leave three hours later, an entire hour after our other group.\n\nOne important note that if you go here with a group of 11 or more people, the restaurant requires a $500 deposit and then a $125 booking fee.  It's a horrible and stupid deal, don't do it, especially seeing that the restaurant just doesn't know how to handle groups.\n\nEven cold the food at Fiamma was really good, it's the reason I'm giving two stars and not one, but we just had some of the worst service any of us has ever had at a fine dining restaurant.  I will never go there again and with all the incredible options in Las Vegas I don't think I could recommend anyone else ever go there either."

The hubby ordered the linguine which had prawns, spinach and bacon in a garlic butter sauce...his dish was absolutely delicious, mine was really good but his was amazing!!! I ordered the risotto which had lobster, shrimp and scallops in a cheesy sauce. It was amazing but once I tasted my hubby's dish I realized that his was much more flavorful. It was definitely worth our money. With two meals we spent $75 so it is a little pricey but well worth it."

Other than the fact that the hostess attempted to not seat our party until all of us had arrived, despite the fact that one of our flights was delayed...at any rate, they finally sat us, and food commenced to be ordered.\n\nA few bottles of wine, two red, two white, none memorable. Cured meats with grilled greens to start, which was rather tasty.  I had the pasta with lamb and mint in a red sauce, and it was delicious. Minus another star for the waiters clearing half the table's plates before we were all done eating.\n\nAll in all, nothing special, but when 8 ladies leave satisfied, who can really complain?"

We then began a marvelous culinary evening of Chef Pinisetti's dishes.  We tried the following items:\n\nCaprese with fresh bufala mozzarella\nGrilled Mediterranean octopus\nBeef carpaccio\nProsciutto with fig marmalade and bleu cheese mousse with flatbread and arugula\nRaviolini--short rib filled small ravioli with vegetable confetti and black truffle cream\nMorel and summer truffle carbonara with poached egg \nMaine lobster gnocchi with wild mushrooms and black truffle sauce\nBranzino with rainbow chard\nKurobuta pork shank with polenta and vegetable confetti\nCioppino with calamari, Manila clams, scallops, prawns, mussels and half lobster with housemade spaghetti\nBraised short rib with orange gremolata, Yukon gold potato pur\u00e9e, Cipollini onions, and baby carrots\nLimoncello espuma\nVanilla buttermilk panna cotta with spring berry compote\nEspresso \"cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\"--salted caramel and vanilla whipped cream, hazelnut streusel and caramel brittle\nAmarena cherry Black Forest cake\nBombolini with Nutella sauce and cranberry jam\n\nWe started with a nice bread basked of epi and focaccia served with a tomato basil butter and unslated butter rounds. Good epi and the tomato basil was rich in flavor and worthy of taking bread and wiping every last bit of it out of its holder.\n\nThe standouts for the appetizer course were the prosciutto with fig marmalade and bleu cheese mousse, and the beef carpaccio. The caprese and octopus were also top notch.\n\nMoving on to the pastas, all three were excellent. The beef short rib raviolini was melt in your mouth good and the short rib gave the raviolini a wonderful flavor. The lobster gnocchi were as soft as can possibly be made and the morel and summer truffle carbonara were exceptional dishes.\n\nMoving on to the meat course, the pork shank and the braised short rib were the stars. Meat coming right off the shank, tender and flavorful and the short rib was so full of flavors. Even as leftovers two days later, the dishes shone!\n\nFinally, the limoncello espuma was my pick of a favorite. The other four were all good. What a great way to end a stunning meal.\n\nAfter walking by here so many times going to/from the MGM Grand Garden Arena, I'm glad I finally tried Fiamma.  It's one of the best Italian on the Strip!"

The lighting and astmoshpere are done just right. The service quality here is top notch. \n\nMade reservations and was seated right away. All of the foods had excellent plating and service quality. Most of the food portions was enough for two. The one thing I would recommend is getting the Tartoffal for all you chocolate lovers. This is a great spot to come to especially before going to see KA.  Prices are on the high side averaging about $70/per person.  But I've been to places that are far more expense and would say that's about on par for Vegas.\n\nOverall Fiamma is one of the fine examples of how a resturant can offer good quality without a Celeb Chef headlining the place."

The bartender was friendly, I like the decor but the food is just ok. Not bad but just not great.  I'll start with the bread. two kinds, one was soft with a nice crust. I'm not sure what the other was but it seemed stale with no flavor at all. It was a braid of some sort. The tomato butter that it was served with was just short of not even palatable. This is just my opinion but it was like putting tomato paste on bread\nI started with the octopus. The octopus was cooked perfectly and you could taste the char.  The salad, tomatoes and beans it was over would have been great if they were not swimming in dressing.\nI then had the gnocchi with lobster and truffles. This was a good solid dish but not a wow dish. I found it a little heavy with the sauce making it unable to taste the lobster. Their was however a lot of lobster in this dish. Again it was good just not great. They used to have a mushroom gnocchi with truffles that was mind blowing. This was not that dish which may be unfair as I'm comparing it to that."

I think the alcohol choices for the bachelor party are different, perhaps more MANLY drinks, but I was pleased with our magnum of champagne. Between the 6 of us, we each got a few good pours.\n\nFor the money, it was a good deal; while I don't think that Fiamma has any Michelin stars, the food was flavorful and well prepared. I actually really liked the parmesan crisps served in the bread basket. Starting out I was not too sure about the cleanliness and attention to detail. After asking for a pepper shaker that turned out to be rancid (wet and clumpy) I asked for a new one hoping that they would throw the bad one away. Our server quickly brought a new shaker; problem solved. \n\nFrom the prefix menu I chose:\n\nInsalata: tricolor, a mix of greens with yellow and red cherry tomatoes and parmesan cheese with balsamic vinegrette\n\nPan Seared Salmon: served with a pesto glaze and bed of spinach. this was a decent size portion and the fish was prepared well, not over cooked so the salmon flaked apart.\n\nTiramisu: drenched in espresso, I tasted mostly coffee and not so much Kalua or rum but it was still delicious. It had more of a substantial structure I think because of the ricotta used; I like to have more lady fingers in my tiramisu but this was still good.\n\nAll in all, damage came out to $77 per person split over 5 people since the Bride to Be of course does not get to pay! So for a nice dinner out in Vegas, magnum of champagne, I think we got a good deal on this one!"

While the food is quite good, you don't get the sense that the majority of the service staff really love what they do.  This all starts at the beginning - I can only assume that a raging case of bitch had broken out at some point earlier in the evening, as when I showed up with my party for our 7:15 reservation, the two hostesses not only couldn't manage a smile, but were barely able to hold back snarls.  Not sure what was up there.  \n\nThen, they crammed our party of 5 at a table for 4 - not the most auspicious beginning.  I suspect they were pissed that we were now a party of 5, instead of 6, but come on - really?!  Had I known that our 6th diner would have gotten so sick (which would have required omniscience and a good crystal ball), I OF COURSE would have called.  Which I tried to explain but gave up given the major attitude thrown back at me.  But whatever.  Karma's a bitch, ladies.  And so were you.  \n\nLuckily, it got better from there.  We had a pretty food savvy crowd, but no one wanted anything too high end that night, so that's how we ended up at Fiamma.  In that, the concept and food worked well for our group.  We started with an appetizer bonanza.  The Polipo was a hit - tender grilled octopus in a savory olive, caper, tomato-based sauce - as were the beef carpaccio, mozzarella salad, caesar salad, calamari (the addition of the fried pepperoncini and the flash fried basil was a good one) and the evening's special, a tuna tartare.  Pretty good stuff.\n\nWe all went with pasta dishes, despite my pleading that we share a few of the pastas and have dinners.  Oh well...around the table we ordered the rigatoni, linguini (2), the spaghetti, and the gnocchi.  I was able to sample a little of each - but did so at my own risk given the speed at which the plates were devoured.  The rigatoni I thought was kind of so-so, and I didn't really like the spaghetti - san marzano tomatoes don't really need extra sugar, and it definitely seemed sweeter to me than it had to be.  Perhaps it was an attempt to provide a balance to the Kobe meatballs, but all in all, just wasn't to my taste.  The person who ordered it really liked it, though, so that might just be me.  I had the lobster truffle gnocchi, which was a little saltier than it had to be, but so decadent that I almost didn't mind; the gnocchi were perfect little pillows.  I like a little salt, too.  The linguini was delicious - delicate and hearty at the same time - if you can imagine that.  \n\nWe finished sharing the sorbet trio (blood orange is the best of those), and enjoyed some fresh pressed coffee, which sparked us up out of our wine and food induced comas.  \n\nThe space is lovely, very warm and modern, and our server was truly a dear - almost thoroughly making up for our rather abrupt beginning to the night.  She kept our wine filled and paced the meal appropriately, and was friendly without being overly solicitous.  Portions are on the moderate size - what we ordered was perfect for us, but if we hadn't had the appetizers, I probably would have needed a little more - the pastas are intermezzi size, so that if you wanted to do a full Italian meal, you could.  So, just keep that in mind.  \n\nFor the price, you could do worse, definitely.  \n\nThe restaurant was not full the night we ate there, although I found myself noticing that the tables were fairly close together.  Wasn't a problem for us, but I think that if your luck ran a little differently, and you did have a louder table near you, it might be enough to pitch this meal south REALLY fast."

Also, because it opens into the casino/walkway- it  reeked of cigarette smoke and every once in a while, you would hear cheers/grunts/yelling from drunk passerbys.  We asked to be moved because I am very sensitive to the smoke- but it was a full house and no other tables were available.  \n\nIf I ignore the service and the table location- the meal was actually quite delicious.  We started with the beef carpaccio appetizer, and it was good, although not the best I have ever had.  Not even close.  We also ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell because the seafood platter that they were offering looked really unappetizing.  In fact, the table next to us were very upset with their sad looking platter- it had 2 oysters, a few scrawny shrimp cocktail, and 2 skinny crab legs- they refused to pay for it and asked for the manager.  I ordered the Lobster Gnocchi and cannot speak highly enough about this dish. Every bite was bursting with flavor.  My husband ordered the Risotto and it came with perfectly cooked scallops and prawns.  \n\nBy the time we looked at the dessert menu, the smell of smoke was really irritating me and so was our waiter's attitude. So we asked for the check, and bought dessert elsewhere.  \n\n*Yelp 100 Challenge: Review 44/100*"

Am I glad we did.  It was one of the best Italian meals I've ever had in my entire life and possibly the best.  First, we shared the buffalo mozzarella salad which was amazing.  I asked the waitress (who was very helpful) what she recommended for an entree and she told me the most popular dish was the short rib ravioli.  She called them \"little pockets of love\".  I had it and she wasn't lying.  Overall, great service, great food, and reasonably priced for a nice Vegas restaurant.  I highly recommend."

Dropping F-Bombs in every sentence and just weren't feeling the food as well, eating beside them wasn't making my experience any better.  \n\nThe pasta tasting trio was pretty good.  It's essentially a sampling of their signature pasta dishes.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/11JyV2e\n\nTRADITIONAL POTATO GNOCCHI - Maine Lobster, Cremini Mushroom, Black Truffle Crema\n\nAGNOLOTTI -Beef, Veal, and Pork Ravioli, Wild Mushroom, Veal Demi\n\nORECCHIETTE - Spiced Sausage, Broccoli Rabe, Hot Pepper Flakes, Sun Dried Tomatoes\n\nI'm not sure if I would order the trio again though since my favorite of the three, the lobster gnocchi was the best tasting of the three and the only one I really enjoyed.\n\nService was kind of iffy though since my server would vanish on me at certain times when I needed him.  It did give me some time to just sit back and people watch from my table.  But in Vegas, time is definitely short and I was really ready to leave once I had finished my pasta.\n\nIf I were to come back to Fiamma, I would definitely go for another round of their Lobster Gnocchi.  But with a vast multitude of Italian restaurants on the Strip, it may not be for a while."

What a great place!\n\nFiamma is located at the MGM grand. Down a hallway of some heavy foot traffic. But don't be deterred. Once inside the restaurant, you can't hear the outside hallway noise and only what's going on inside the restaurant. Interior is nicely lit and provides a very romantic atmosphere. \n\nService was outstanding. Greeted kindly when we arrived. Waitress was awesome and very attentive. Food arrived in a timely manner. \n\nThe food here overall is fantastic !\n\nWe ordered:\n\nCalamari - our least favorite dish. Served lukewarm. The calamari wasn't crispy at all - more like soggy. Tasted like they had these out in a big pan under a heat lamp. Cooked hours ago or something. \n\nPear Salad - Great flavor for a salad\n\nLobster Gnocchi - Bomb! Soooo good! Nice chunks of lobster in the dish\n\nShort Rib Ravioli - Bomb! Great portion size. \n\nCioppino - Delicious. Tons of seafood. Definitely get your money's worth. \n\nShort Rib - Fall off the bone! Amazing\n\n\nGreat Dinner, great food, great ambiance. Will definitely be back!"

Being that I'm Italian and this was the first time I was away from family during Christmas I wanted to keep up the tradition of Italian food for my Christmas dinner. We had reservations for 7PM on Christmas Night which we were late for as always . They found our reservation and seated us right away. The restaurant is beautiful however, It's very open to the hallways of MGM Grand so you can people watch. The back of the restaurant has a fire going and a lounge to have drinks. The rest is the restaurant. The place has a great feel to it and gives a very classy feeling. Also, anyone that's been to MGM Grand knows how easy it is to find anything in there...sigh . The waitress was very nice and great company to talk to. We started out with the Wine list and they have a very large and good wine list here. I'm a wine fan and was very impressed. Since I was not alone and as I would say was ballin' on a budget we went with a cheaper wine on the menu. We ordered the Corvina which is red for anyone that has not heard of it. Here is the description per the restaurant Corvina: Medium to port like with bursting black cherry, raisin, and fig. So, ordered the Valpolicella Classico, Brigaldara, Veneto 2006. The lady brought out the wine opened it and explained to my friend the best wine openers and proper way to open wine. She always made sure our wine glass were full and almost never had to pour ourselves. The bottle was $40.00 and pretty good. I was surprised how much I liked it and would most likely get it again. After this we ordered the Calamari and OMG this was the best calamari I've ever had. Was so good and I would highly suggest to anyone that likes Calamari!!! My friend ordered the Rigatoni which looked really good and she liked a lot. I went with the Raviolini which is a short rib ravioli, Barbera wine, and Imported Pecorino Romano. Wow this was so good. The waitress said this generally this is not enough food for guys and asked if I would like a salad which I declined. I can see that for some the raviolini might not be enough food so take that in mind if you ever go. The flavor of everything I ate here was top notch and so was the location and atmosphere was the same. I highly suggest this location to anyone that wants a great wine selection and awesome food. Food by no means is cheap here and meals were about 20-22 per entree. With all we ordered our bill was around $107.00 pre tip. I loved this location and will most certainly will be going back. There was just something about this place that brought out the romantic in me not sure why but it just did."

We decided to try to see if we could get in after seeing Andrea Bocelli and the restaurant was awesome enough to stay open past its hours to accommodate us post concert goers. Although our server, Sammy, was staying late to serve us he had a smile on his face and never tried to rush us. He took his time answering all of our questions and made great recommendations. Our meals were served promptly and the food was amazing. It was some of the best risotto and salmon I've ever had and the desserts were to die for!!!

This meal was no where near a $100+ pre tip meal...recap small salad, one martini, 2 raviolis, one sorbet and one coffee - hmmmm.....the olive garden beats this place... too bad they have a good location and a neat atmosphere...i know it is vegas and we don't mind paying $100+ for dinner for two -we do it all the time - but this meal was not worth it. \n\nMy dining companion asked me not to say anything about the insane Martini Charge, so I didn't but check out the bill, I posted a picture here on Yelp.

Needless to say, if their free items were that good, I couldn't wait to try the main course. Lobster gnocchi was my choice, and at $31, it was a tough one indeed. The portions weren't that big (not what I'm used to anyway with all the other restaurants we've eaten at). Once the plate arrived, I asked myself if this is how true Italians eat--without stuffing their faces and eating themselves into comas like we Americans do. But then I asked myself why they were still so fat, so I concluded that it must be the butter. Either way, my friend got more lobster than I did, but it was still delicious. The gnocchi melts in your mouth like it should, so that was a plus.\n\nFor dessert, we had three flavors of sorbet, the doughnuts, and the tiramisu. Sorbets were a bit icy, but the doughnuts were great deep fried balls of delicious, especially when dipped in the caramel or hazelnut sauce provided. Tiramisu was smooth, but not that high in my book."

I would normally have said something to them about the service, but I had to leave right after eating and didn't get a chance to wait around for a manager.\n\nFood - 5 star\nService - 1 star\n\nI ordered the Tagliata (fillet, of course!), which came with a sauteed spinach and a red wine reduction. Not as good as the Craftsteak restaurant across the hall, but still very good.  Why did I order a steak here anyway, knowing that Craftsteak was across the way? Oh well.\n\nNow of the service. The waiter brought out my menu and came back about 10 minutes later to get my food order. I placed my order and he walked away without even taking my drink order. Uh, hello, I wanted some wine.\n\nI flagged down the hostess and asked for the wine list, which she promptly brought back to me (Thank you!). I didn't see my waiter until he brought out my food and then I had to place my drink order. I ordered a half bottle of wine. He brought it out and set it on my table and then said he would be right back and walked away. He went to another table to take their order and talk with them, then disappeared. Uh, my wine wasn't opened yet. He then came back to open my wine and pulled the same stunt again. Except this time he disappeared for about five minutes where I couldn't see him. I finally got my wine opened and forgot all about the bad service. The food was terrific.\n\nI got called to a private party just as I was finishing my food, so I couldn't speak with a manager about this. Otherwise, I would have. That is, if I could have found one. I only saw the hostess and waiter the entire time I was there. (I was sitting in the \"patio\" area where you could see all the people walking by.) Not sure what the \"inside\" of the restaurant looked like. I put those words in quotes, because if this place was outside that is what they would have been called.\n\nAs I walked out, the hostess asked me how everything was. I told her the food was incredible, but my waiter wouldn't even do a good job as a greeter at Wal-Mart. Not sure what her reaction was, because I didn't stick around to find out. I will definitely try this place again, because I'm sure that waiter is gone by now or if he's still there, I won't get him again."

Service was slow for a half empty dining room.\n\nWe were starving and were finally able to order. It was like he was ignoring us. His body language showed some sense of being annoyed as he cleared our entree plates away. \n\nI was thinking, \"Whoa there. I'm about to eat way more. You haven't seen how much I eat.\"\n\nAfter 10 minutes or so we finally got a hold of him again and his demeanor quickly changed when he realized we were going to drop $200 on dinner.\n\nRegardless of the service snafu, the food was just alright. I had the lobster gnocchi. The sauce was a cream sauce cooked in olive oil and some wine i think. The lobster was a decent portion. There were several claws and it was enough to share with.\n\nOverall, I probably won't go again. I wasn't very impressed with the food: Overpriced tourist gouging food."

WTF would any one have to wait any more than 5 minutes, I can't tell you, but it beats just standing and doing nothing.  \n\nFour girls from Louisiana and we get David as our server, from Louisiana as well.  What are the odds, eh???  Anyhoo, we all opted for the summer tasting menu - three courses for $45, or with wine pairings, an extra $25 on top.  We didn't do the wine pairing, but I did get the Bellini.  I heart sweet alcoholic drinks and this was delicious!  The champagne wasn't too dry and the peach syrup was refreshing.\n\nFor starters, the girls had Caesar salad and I had the grilled octopus with a tomato and olive and capers type of chutney/sauce.  The octopus was really char-grilled, and at times it overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the protein, but not at all was it chewy or rubbery.  Delicious and tender!  \n\nEntree - the girls had the grilled skirt steak and I had the salmon.  WOW was the steak delicious.  One of the girls commented how this was the best steak ever - tender, juicy, not too salty, just tasty.  And when I bit into it, I almost regretted getting the salmon - it was tasty!!!\n\nThe salmon was fresh and delicious.  It was barely seasoned as the pancetta provided enough saltiness and the corn ragu added a touch of sweetness....mmmmm.....I had to force myself to finish the last bite - still bracing the fact that we had dessert coming as well.\n\nFour choices of desserts and four girls = sharing all dessert!!!  Hands down, our favorite was the chocolate tarfuto - the hazelnuts and dark chocolate poured over the caramel gelato...MMMMM. \n\nThe sorbet trio was fantastic - cantaloupe tasted exactly like one!  Next favorite was the tiramisu - we found the espresso powder covering the delicate dessert to be overpowering, but still tasting.  And the least favorite was the panna cotta.  I think the girls were turned off by the figs, but the almonds and honey really brought out the marscapone in the panna cotta.\n\nNot to mention that David's fellow server, Brian was really hamming it up with us.  Prior to dessert, he sent over some miscotti or dessert wine.  It was SOOO delicious, that one of the girls took my glass and promptly finished it off.  Of course we had to thank Brian for his generosity, and even took a picture with him.  \n\nAnyhoo, Service here was fantastic, the food very tasty.  I appreciated the fact that David asked if we were on a time frame, and even though we didn't make it out in time, I thoroughly enjoyed myself."

Arrived a few minutes before our reservation and we were seated and greeted immediately, offered drinks but we opted for tap water.\n\nDecided to skip the salad for a vegetable side (saut\u00e9ed spinach) with our entrees: lobster gnocchi (after much internal debate between this and the sea bass) and the mezzaluna (pesto filled half moon ravioli with a red vodka cream sauce).\n\nComplimentary bread, butter and roasted red pepper cheese spread was served. A braided roll was included and it was hot and delish with the cheese spread. The Italian bread was crusty with an herbed soft inside. The bread arrived quickly and so did out entrees. We were stunned at how quick our entrees arrived. I barely had time to butter my bread.\n\nThe spinach was heaping, one of the largest sides of veggies I've ever received at any restaurant. It was saut\u00e9ed in garlic, seasoned just right. Piping hot but not overcooked. The lobster ravioli was to die for. We're from the east coast so lobsters are my specialty and this dish was spot on. Plenty of lobster pieces, tender gnocchi and flavorful sauce. The hubby enjoyed his mezzaluna, tasty but not over-filling.\n\nWe were going to skip dessert given the late hour but were tempted to see the menu. We shared the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was equally as pleasing as our meal. Glad we decided to share as it was plenty for two.\n\nOur waiter was attentive and our water glasses were never empty.

They both stumbled on the great food for less. They had their orders ahead of us and were able to tell us what to order. \n\nWe ended up with the mussels, bruchettona, and truffled gnocchi. The muscles were very high quality muscles and cooked in a tomato sauce for $7. The crusted bread that went with it was great, but there was not enough. The bruchettona was $5 and came with 3 slices of bruschetta that was relatively tasty. The gnocchi for $7 was very filling. The cheese that covered the gnocchi potatoes was tasty and truffled anything seems to be delicious. \n\nThe waitress was inattentive and was never there when we needed her, but the manager who was standing in the area must have seen that and made sure to clear our plates, ask us if we needed any other appetizers, and keep our drinks refilled. \n\nThis will definitely be a must stop for great food at great prices!"

Bread was cold (I mean like from the refrigerator cold) and the olive oil for dipping was cheap/low quality (excusable if you're not paying $30 a plate.) I was worried from the start.  Pear and bleu cheese salad had no bleu cheese kick - we forgot we were eating a bleu cheese salad. The short rib raviolini is definitely previously frozen which is misleading because the menu indicates that pastas are fresh. We asked our waiter whether this was true and he simply smiled back without an answer. \n\nThere are so many great places to eat in Vegas at similar price points (Bouchon, Olive at Bellagio, DOCG) that it makes little sense to go to Fiamma. It's all show and no go."

Forget Vegas, the MGM has a lot of great restaurants; so many that it's hard to pay attention when you see a place nestled between Morimoto and Craftsteak, but don't just pass by without taking a look at their menu!\n\nFirst, it's a little hard to make the place feel cozy when it's along the main walkway from the convention center to the hotel. With the right lighting, warm wood, and great service (minus the hosts), it pulls off that feat! It's also a pretty big restaurant so it's easy to get a reservation (or walk up) even when the hotel is inundated with convention goers.\n\nThe food is tasty, there's no question about it. It's also a pretty good value because the prices are reasonable, unlike many of the other options along this walkway. Even the wine list has a handful of relatively inexpensive Napa wines that are worth drinking.\n\nAll in all, a good find and something I'd be willing to visit again."

The boy and I were headed to Cirque du Soleil's O and had planned a few bites beforehand. Fiamma fit the criteria.\n\nWe leveraged some of John's awesome barista skills. Our drinks were delicious. He actually let me swap in a drink for a Pinot Noir I wasn't 100% in love with. We ordered a few snacks: seafood polenta, meatballs, truffled gnocchi, and the bruschettona.\n\nWhile waiting on our food, we chatted about Vegas, John's visiting relatives, Cirque du Soleil shows. It was nice talking to a Vegas survivor in a quiet setting about Out There. Out There everything moves way fast, boobie papers are handed out on the strip, and everyone's half intoxicated and somehow justified in acting stupid all damn day. We were pleased as punch not to be walking around among the throng of tourist drunkies. Not yet anyway.\n\nOur food arrived, and our favorite was quickly established to be the seafood polenta. It melted in the mouth and caused that kind of eye-roll movement with each bite. I couldn't control it. The gnocchi we didn't know would be fried. Still, not bad, but I shied away from it. The bruschetta: yum. And the meatballs were just meatballs.\n\nJohn said hey, you kids are nice, and threw in my first ever taste of Moscato. What a delicious little dessert sip that is. We decided later to get some for tubtime; it's that kind of drink.\n\nWe headed off to O, bellies happy and full, having met one of the sweetest baristas in town. Thanks for making it feel all warm and cushy, John. We almost forgot we were in Vegas."

That's not to say that it wasn't good, it just didn't suit my palate at all.  It felt like a hot mess.\n\nThe Mezzaluna on the other hand had a very refreshing taste to it.  The cherry tomatoes were the best part about it and honestly it might have been my yearning for fresh food the entire weekend that made this dish taste so good.\n\nFor dessert, I had the gelato and sorbet.

A part of me wants to give them 4 stars simply because they are really priced so high, but for Vegas the prices aren't too far away from the other nice restaurants' pricing, and if you can get their \"Taste\" menu, it's actually a pretty good deal, especially considering the quality you get.  Thus we stick with 5 stars. :]\n\nFiamma has everything they do down perfectly. My husband had the \"Winter Tasting Menu\" which gave him the Insalata (mixed baby lettuce, green apples, toasted pistachios, white balsamic), Brasato (\"Piemontese\" braised beef short rib, caramelized root vegetables, potato puree), and Tartufo for dessert (dolce di latte gelato, caramelized hazelnuts, warm valrhona chocolate sauce) all for $45.  That was actually a heck of a deal, and ALL of the food was incredible.  The salad was fresh and light with enough dressing to add taste without creating soggy lettuce.  The braised short ribs fell right off the bone, were a perfect pink on the inside, and had the perfect amount of juiciness and incredible flavor.  The dessert was lovely in its presentation and flavor -- a solidly impressive and tasty three courses!\n\nI had the Raviolini (short rib ravioli, barbera wine, melted butter, black truffle) which was a relatively small portion, but was loaded with flavor.  The sauce was rich and light (if you can even imagine that!) and complemented the ravioli itself well.  I want to venture a guess that the pasta itself was homemade.  I have an Italian aunt who only cooks with pasta she makes herself and that's what this was like.  YUM.\n\nOur friends at the table also enjoyed the Taste menu as well as the Linguini (saut\u00e9ed shrimp, scallops, crispy shallots, cortese wine), which was reportedly quite good.\n\nThe wine prices are pretty high, even by the glass.  If you like whites, they have some affordable options, but the reds start significantly higher and were frankly more than I am willing to pay for a low-end (entry level) bottle/glass.\n\nAmbiance is nice -- dimly lit, mainly candle light, comfortable booths, etc.  It sucks to be able to smell the cigarette smoke from people outside the restaurant, but that's Vegas for you.\n\nService was excellent... as it should be since you're really paying enough to deserve it!\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a nice meal in Vegas, this place won't disappoint you!"

Beautiful decor and a menu which appears to serve everyone's food preferences from vegetarians to carnivores who will eat anything which isn't running too fast attract us to this place.

My best friend is raving about her pasta marinara [sans Kobe meatballs to make it vegetarian] and how it is the best tasting sauce she has ever had. A few minutes later, we find out why when her fork strikes a large hunk of cow! We have meat sauce. This woman has not eaten beef in 10 years, and she is on the verge of tears, panicking, and it sets the whole table on edge.  We summon our waiter who apologizes profusely and within 2 minutes the manager is at our table doing the same. He lets us know that they are usually very careful to use different utensils, gloves, etc for vegetarian requests and he is profoundly sorry, offers us drinks and desserts all on the house, as well as my friend's amended meal for free. {She LOVED the veggie version just as much].The desserts will send you into a sugar coma and give you a headache too, they are that good.  \n\nThe next night, we are trying to decide what to do for dinner, and I had been craving that gnocchi all day. Everyone else admits they want to go back to Fiamma! As soon as we walk in, the manager greets us and thanks us for returning in light of the circumstances, lets us know he had a mandatory emergency staff meeting that day to discuss strict rules regarding veggie requests [our waiter later confirmed this without us mentioning it] and once again, desserts are on the house.\n\nWe enjoyed a long dinner, and they were starting to close up as we finished, at which point we saw everyone on staff go around to each table setting and hold glasses up to the light to check for spots!\n\nIn light of the mistake, the service and attention to detail here was so pristine, not to mention the amazing food, that every time we have a trip planned to Vegas, our reservation at Fiamma gets booked right after the flight and hotel."

We were seated promptly, and by the front \"window\" area. It was cool for people watching, except that they were watching you too- while you eat. The area outside of the restaurant is a non-smoking area, but unfortunately people either do not know or just don't care. We had many many people pass by while smoking and one group who stood right I front of us smoking. I would recommend asking for an interior seating area. Next is the food. Our waiter took a very long time to get to us. Yes, it was on the night of a concert, but it was during the concert and there were few other tables. We ordered an appetizer of calamari, which was pretty standard at $18. It was super quick. As in, kinda too quick. I know, I'm complaining that it was too quick, but I couldn't see how they even had time to get our order back to the kitchen and prepare it before it came out to us. The best part was the pesto dipping sauce, and the fact that there were diced peperoncinis mixed in. My son ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, and I ordered the short ribs with mushroom risotto. It took FOREVER to get our dishes. I expected a normal wait time, since the appetizer was there suspiciously quickly, but I was wrong. Oh well, we had time to kill, so it wasn't a big deal. When the food came it looked delicious. I tried the fettuccine Alfredo and it was nothing special, but my son really liked it. When I first took a bite of my food, it was really good. Our waiter came up and asked how it was and we told him it was great. Well, by my third bite I downed an entire glass of water because it was SO salty. I love salt. \"Salty\" is an adjective I love. This was excessive. I drank two more glasses of water with two more bites, and just couldn't do it. FYI- the staff refilling the water is on-point. My glass was never empty lol. So I waited for the waiter to check back in. He passes us maybe 6 times in a hurry. I faced him and looked at him waiting for him to return a glance each time. I didn't want to cause a scene, so I waited and waited and waited. He finally comes over and I apologize and tell him that it is just too salty. He was not happy. His words said \"no problem\", but his face and demeanor said otherwise. He told me he wished I would've told him sooner... Yeah that was the goal, but when you run by us with your eyes straight ahead, I would have had to jump in front of you to get your attention. He brought me a menu and I ordered the lobster gnocchi. While waiting for my new food and praying that I didn't get a spit glaze, my son bit into the hugest piece of cartilage in his chicken. Like nickel size. It was so hard he thought it was a bone. He didn't want me to say anything because the experience thus far had already been a bummer. My food came out promptly. It was..... Well I should have just eaten the bread for free. The gnocchi was so soggy that the texture threw off the great flavor of the dish. The flavor was awesome and rich, but the texture was all sorts of wrong. It had a decent amount of lobster too. Needless to say, we skipped dessert and paid. I brought my food home, and nobody will eat it. Overall, for about $110 for two dinners, an appetizer and tap water- not worth it. I was bummed because I had read so many reviews on here and was really looking forward to it."

It is dimly lit, with a bar/lounge to the right and a dining room to the left. In the back of the lounge there is a fireplace as well.\n\nWe started out with a bottle of Chianti, recommended by the Sommelier (don't remember the name of the wine, but it was delicious). We also had a salad, with greens, garbanzo beans and a bunch of other stuff tossed in a super light sauvignon dressing. SO good.\n\nThe main courses were the short rib ravioli and the lobster gnocchi. I mustve died and gone to heaven, because both were absolutely to die for! I preferred the gnocchi, I thought that there was the perfect amount of lobster and that the gnocchi themselves were perfect little pillows of doughy deliciousicity....but my party all really loved the raviolis as well, and they were super good. The short rib filling was really tasty, as was the sauce.\n\nFor dessert, I am fairly certain that we went overboard and had just about everything on the menu. I am not sure where I found a place for these sweets to go, but somehow managed. The tiramisu was light and fluffy and very well done. We had a sampling of 3 ice creams (choc, vanilla and nutella) and 3 sorbets (cantaloupe - yum, honeydew - kinda bland, could be due to all of the other rich items we had, and berry). We also had some sort of crazy layered chocolate cake, which was chocolate overload and included like 6 different types of chocolates from Europe. There was a cheesecake sampler (this is ridiculous, I know), which was beyond amazing. I can't remember what they were called, but we also had the Italian version of beignets, with chocolate sauce and berry sauce (these were better than any beignets I've ever had!). Shoot, I am leaving a few things out. Seriously, it was a smorgasbord of gourmet proportions!\n\nFiAMMA may have easily become my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. They have been doing what they do, quietly, for years inside the MGM Grand. And they are damn good at it. I have been telling all of my friends about how great the food and the service was, but you should go see for yourself! I will be dreaming of those lobster gnocchis tonight! Buon Appetito!"

We'd gotten up at 3:30am Eastern time so we were pretty beat by the time we got there but that didn't stop us from enjoying the meal.\n\nService was prompt and attentive.      We got a chuckle out of the waiter who eloquently described a soup with broccoli and pecarino romano soup with a pancetta accent - when he came back and I asked about the soup again, he said \"broccoli and cheese\".    Not quite the fancy description I got the first time.    I went for it anyway and it was really, really tasty, not your average \"broccoli and cheese\" at all!\n\nI had the scallop and prawn risotto - the seafood was done perfectly!   Alas, the risotto was not quite as good.   A bit underdone and not as creamy as I would have liked to see but the seafood was so good, I'll give them 4 starts anyway.    My husband started with a chopped salad that was huge!   He had the Bustarelle that was really, really good.\n\nBe forewarned- if you get a salad and an entree, the salads are HUGE!     \n\nWe did not have dessert mostly because we were falling asleep in our wine glasses but it looked really tasty."

I think I might have a little crush on those raviolis and will think about them for years to come as that one beautiful night in Vegas that was meant to be, but not meant to last past sunrise. Those raviolis alone will get me back into Fiamma on my next Vegas trip.\n\nThe server didn't even ask us what desserts we each wanted. Instead he decided to bring us an array of desserts for all of us to share. Tiramisu, sorbet, and a chocolate torte. I love that!

The tomato basil butter was so good I was tempted to lick the plate (but refrained since it was a sophisticated establishment). Second, the chianti wine was scrumptious. I could sip on that all night long. \n\nNext, main course. I got the filet, and let me tell you, that steak cut as easily as the tomato basil butter before it. I absolutely reveled in the taste and texture of this meat. The yukon gold potato puree (fancy mashed potatoes) were also delightful and perfect to soak up some of the extra steak juice. Oh so good. Oh my gosh I will be thinking about this steak for a while. Finally, dessert. We were just browsing, but all of them looked so delicious so I couldn't say no. I got the Tiramisu. The chocolate/mocha ice cream and whipped cream were so delicious. There was then a layer of very strong espresso, which for me was too much. It all came in a cute bittersweet chocolate cup. Again, the top part was AMAZING and I would order it again just for that part. Friends got the panna cotta (devoured), coffee-infused creme brulee, and cheesecake. All good choices, all satisfied customers. \n\nAs for the vibe, very classy but not stuffy. We commented on the music selection and even shazamed a few songs. Love the interior decor, especially the woodwork on the wall that looks like waves. This meal was worth every penny."

Maybe I should have gone with the Risotto after all....\n\nI sampled my coworkers creamed potatoes and they were delicious.\n\nFinally I had the gelato, which was authentic tasting and seemed freshly made. (I'm a huge fan of gelato, so it's important they get it right!)  I chose pumpkin, amaretto and chocolate caramel.\n\nsummary: \nEnjoyed the martini, the gnocchi, the creamed potatoes, the gelato\nNot a fan of the appetizers: beet salad, casear\nOk, but unexcited by: Pollo (Chicken)\n\nWas it worth 82.50 (pre-tax/tip)?  I'm not sure.  I've had better Italian for cheaper, but it wasn't in Vegas where everything is overpriced.\n\nWorth trying yourself if you can afford it, but I think next time if I'm going to spend that much I will try somewhere else, like the Italian places in the Venetian next time I'm in Vegas.  Or the cheaper, but just as tasty Italian restaurant at the Monte Carlo that I ate at the night before."

We arrived without a reservation just as the dinner rush was beginning one night during March Madness. The dining room was full with reservations, but they informed us that all tables in the lounge + bar were first come first serve...and there are a ton of them, so we had no problem finding a seat! A short while later, the place was packed, but they seemed fully capable to keep up with the demand. They have a separate lounge menu, but they also serve the full dinner menu there, which is fantastic (because a lot of places don't). So on to the food...\n\nMy friend and I had trouble deciding what to get, so we each selected an entree and shared. They make their own gnocchi from scratch, so we decided to try one of their specials: Pesto and Pine Nut Gnocchi. It was easily the best gnocchi I've had at a restaurant, but it was the Scallop and Prawn Risotto that won my heart...it was absolutely to die for!\n\nOn a side note, a few nights earlier when we were at a bar across the hall, we ordered limoncello, but they didn't have it. So, our bartender walked over to Fiamma since he figured an Italian bar would have it. They did, and they were gracious enough to give it to him so he could fulfill our request. Kinda cool."

We had decided to just eyeball a few menus and see if we could get seated somewhere without reservations. After looking at the Craftsteak menu and deciding that, with coworkers, spending $120 per person just wouldn't be worth it, we opted for the more \"business-friendly\" Fiamma's. \n\nI'm glad we did. A very kind hostess greeted us and not only said she could seat us right away (again, without reservations), but gave us a couple choices of seating options. We're off to a great start. \n\nWe were seated in a very comfortable table for four (even though we were only three) and had THE best view of Studio Walk [er, um, I mean The District]. This is significant because it's the absolute BEST people watching spot in the entire building. \n\nProfessional service throughout. I ordered some ravioli with a side of parmessean asparagus. It was good and just filling enough. Almost went for one of the fine looking desserts, but by now it was getting late and my body clock was way ahead of the hour. So the appetite was fast disappearing. Next time...\n\nThe decor in this place is magnificent. Dark, intimate, and not too noisy. Some decent pop music playing in the background (think Ke$ha). It just has a very nice vibe. For me, the main draw of the place is the vibe and location. The food is good too, though. You cold do a lot worse. I'd certainly come back and bring my girl here. I think she'd like it. And I think you will too."

Party of five, 10-15 minutes was the quoted time for the wait. Not bad so we went back to the lounge as asked and waited. After about 20 minutes and observing another party of similar size being seated, I went to check on our status. They didn't have my name - even though I had seen them write it down. \n\nSo the hostess says, \"It'll be about 10-15 minutes, is that OK?\" I said, \"Not really, that's the same amount of time I was told the first time I gave my name 20 minutes ago.\" She said, they'd get us seated as soon as possible. That didn't happen until almost 8PM - so our wait turned out to be 50 minutes not 15. So it didn't start well.\n\nThe other small service shortfall I noted was when I asked for a recommendation between the risotto and the gnocchi. The initial response was, \"well, they're both good\" and nothing more. If I'm at a fine dining Italian restaurant, I don't want an Olive Garden response. The waiter finally said, \"the gnocchi is ordered more often\" so I went with that. I just wish he would have said that at the outset if he didn't have anything to respond to my question.\n\nWe managed to get past those obstacles to find that the food was delicious. Each of us ordered different items and found them to be quite good. Pasta was cooked al dente as it should be. The gnocchi I had with bits of lobster was fantastic - nice sauce and great flavor. Overall it was a great food experience. A little pricey - but to be expected at this type of restaurant in Las Vegas. I'd return here and prefer this place over Todd English's \"Olives\" restaurant at Bellagio."

Since everyone and their mama knew we were late for Chippendale, we were totally catered to..the meal courses were fired left and right to make sure that we didn't miss our show.....now who doesn't like to be pampered.   \n\nFiamma decor is of romantic-comtemp with high ceilling wall art and dimmed lighting, a great place for dates/girls & boys gathering.  We were recommended by the friendly manager to order The Chef Choice for $55 and it was way worth it because the food was just \"Excellente\".  The meal was so good couldn't put my fork down.  I'm not easily satisfied to usually give a place five stars but Fiamma warrents all five and more.  My friends and I were raving about how amazing the meal was. Right when we were seated we got comlimentary champagne :0)   \n\nThe Chef choice (CC) consisted of Chef surprise choosing for a five course dinner. Since all six of us chose CC  we were served each course family style.  The portions were way more than enough.  We still had a lot of food left over and we were stuffed.  First to come was a lightly breaded and fried calamari just how I like it with yummy creamy basil sauce along with a plate of soft mozarella balls flown in from Italy.  Second course, we had cesar salad (I'm usually not a fan of cesar salad but it was great). Third course,  we had pasta dishes consisting of gnocci and beef ravioli.  My fav of the night was the sweet chewy and flavorful gnocci. I'm not fan of ravioli but it was good.  Now just when when thought we were done, the main entree consisted of seabass, braised short ribs, steaks and polenta, daikon marsh patoto, and another fav for the night beet side dishes.  I would never imagine that beet would be so scrumptious ...sweet, crunchy, and  tender to taste. Lets just say I wiped both the gnocci and beet dishes cleaned.\n\nWhen we thought the food couldn't get any better, a huge dessert plate came out.  Wow I was so estatic and floored on how great and decadent and delicious the desserts were.  Dessert platter included one my fav Tiramisu, Mascapone Panna Cotta and Cheese cake, Croquette \"donut holes\" served with spicy, chocolate ganache, and apple caramel sauce, cholocate truffle, chocolate dome filled with gelato.\n\nMinor gliche, no bathroom inside the restaurant, but can't blame Fiamma so still deserves five stars in my book. \n\nWhen at Fiamma, the Chef Choice is defintely the way to go.  Most of my fav were in the meal, it was like the chef was reading my mind.  Usually with Italian cuising, I'm not easily impressed but I finally found my favorite Italian hot spot to my pleasing in Vegas. Next time in Vegas, Fiamma here I come."

The ambiance was very nice, and I think the ingredients they used were definitely high quality.  But somehow, just didn't quite roll off my tongue like I would've liked.\n\nI started off with the Arancine (beef risotto cake), and while the beef combined with the sauce were delicious, I was not a fan of the fried risotto.  The risotto lost the richness of its flavor, while the fried-ness was just not quite as delicious as say, on a fried chicken or fried okra.  The tomato-based sauce was splendid, however.  \n\nFor my entree I got the short rib raviolini. Now, I must caveat that I was disappointed with this entree because there were mushrooms (truffles I believe) in my raviolini, and I do not like mushrooms.  However, the menu didn't SAY that there would be mushrooms, and I believe that the flavor was strong enough that it should've been warned of.  With that sad, I also tried the gnocchi, the linguine, and the rigatoni.  The rigatoni was the best out of the bite that I had... overall the entrees were pretty good, but the mushroom flavored overwhelmed my taste buds a bit and I wasn't able to enjoy the rest quite as much.\n\nWhile this place was reasonably good, I would definitely recommend Circo at the Bellagio over this.  Prices there were comparable from what I remember (went a few months ago), but the pastas were far more delectable."

I ended up getting the spaghetti with meatballs, and my server did tell me that there were breadcrumbs in the meatballs. Since I am okay with having some gluten, that wasn't a problem, but it was nice that he gave me a heads-up so that I could make that choice.\nI also like that they have a Sazerac on their drink menu.\nI will definitely be back to Fiamma soon :-)"

He very rudely goes \"would have been nice to know this beforehand\", walked away and literally stopped being our server. \n\nAfter that our water cups were empty the rest of the meal because he did not come by again.

All of the portions were very generous and very delicious! I started off with the Misto Di Campo, the mixed green salad tossed with cucumber, tomato, and cianti balsamic dressing. Very Refreshing! Next on to the roasted free-range chicken served with swiss chard and fingerling potato. The skin on this roasted chicken was amazing (think crisp sucking pig skin) and the chicken itself was tender and juicy (breast, wing, thigh). The swiss chard was amazing, too.\n\nFor dessert I could not resist the Panna Cotta, made with mascarpone and surrounded by sweet figs and honey. This panna cotta is wonderful and is a great choice (especially during the summer).\n\nTry the bellini, light and refreshing and not cloyingly sweet.\n\nI'll leave it to my husband and friends to yelp their meals, which I have to admit, looked amazing! I did take a sample of my hubby's mozzarella caprese, it was AWESOME and the cheese was to die for\n\nGreat wine list, wonderful atmosphere, and good service. I definitely will return (as soon as I'm forgiven for the Louis V incident)."

I started with a salad with fresh tomato and the most delicious buffalo mozarella I have ever tasted.  The main course was braised short rib ravioli.  Dessert I dont even know what it was called but it had chocolate ice cream in the middle with a cookie crust, at the table pour warm chocolate sauce on it that hardened right away.  The entire dinner was one of the most delicious meals I have ever had at any restaurant.  I would go back in a heartbeat and try anything else on the menu!  The decor was beautiful.

When the food came out it was completely different than what was on the menu, i had my heart set on what was described and what I got was completely different. When i tried to send it back the server gave me incredible attitude saying they had recently switched sides even after i had specifically made sure they had what i wanted.  Eventually he begrudgingly sent it back and brought me something else that was actually pretty good BUT flash forward an hour... the person i was with magically passed out stone cold, like had to be carried to the cab passed out,  all we drank was a bottle of wine and two lemonchellos for desert.(we're drinkers, that was nothing)  If it had been the wine i would have been similarly affected, the only thing it could have been was the lemonchellos as they were separate glasses and served after i complained. The next day she was sick and shaky ruining the rest of the trip.

I ordered the orechiette with sausage because that is one of my favorite pasta dishes and first off, our dishes came out way too quickly, it was odd, made it look like they were not cooked to order. Secondly, it did not mention in the description of my dish what type of sauce it was and I was not expecting a red cream sauce. I wish it was traditional tomato sauce. Everything was chopped in my pasta like a salad, which I didn't like. My bf's lobster gnocchi was just ok, he mentioned it was extremely rich and thought he was eating soup.  The sauce was not his favorite and he politely asked when ordering if they could do meat sauce and said \"No\". So that was that.

            "review": "I went here with a couple of coworkers on the last night of a weeklong business trip to Vegas (which, incidentally, is about four days longer than anyone needs to be in Vegas, ever).  It was about 9:00 on a Wednesday night, and there were only a few other parties in the restaurant, so we got our server Gabriel's undivided and extremely dedicated attention, which was especially appreciated because I was being a serious pain in the behind.  A charming serious pain in the behind, but still.\n\nTo start, the three of us split the calamari appetizer.  It was perfectly fried and came with the most phenomenal basil aioli for dipping.  Entrees were slightly more complicated.  I normally have this rule where I will under no circumstances order the same thing as any of my dining companions.  I wanted the the seafood risotto, but I also sort of wanted the lobster gnocchi, and I also also sort of wanted the short ribs.   After a few minutes of consideration, I went with the risotto - no big deal, until our server came back moments later to inform my coworker that for one reason or another her chicken dish was going to take considerably longer than expected.  So she switched to the risotto, and I subsequently felt the need to debate my other options aloud for several moments before getting over it and sticking with my original choice.  I mean, it was a business dinner.  It wasn't like we were going to be eating off one another's plates (which, incidentally, is the entire motivation behind my no-duplicate-ordering philosophy).  Sadly, the risotto was just okay.  It was a little too al dente for my liking and the lobster was woefully overcooked.  My coworker who ordered it loved it though, so either she got the good one or else I've just got me one high-maintenance palate.  I'm betting on the latter.\n\nDessert was the most impressive part of the meal by far.  The following day was one of my coworker's birthday, and we must have offhandedly mentioned it at some point during the meal while our waiter was in earshot, because he came over with her dessert all specially plated with Happy Birthday drizzled on the plate in chocolate sauce.  It was really thoughtful.  I ordered the gelato.  They have a list of several options, from which you pick three  - I don't remember specifically what they were, but they were all phenomenal and the scoops were huge.  Then, as we were wrapping up our sweets, our waiter came back over with three glasses on Limoncello, on the house, and VIP passes to Studio 54.  It was really one of the most impressively attentive service experiences I've had in a restaurant in my life.  Not to mention, he was cute.  Like really really cute.  Like my coworkers were teasing me, all \"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, cute.  Just saying.\n\nSo - 3 stars for the food, 5+ stars for the service."

We both came away very, very pleased with the food, service, value and overall experience.\n\nThere was a pre-fix meal that my guy took advantage of. For starters there were three large beautifully grilled and well seasoned jumbo prawns. Great start. Second was heart shaped, portobello-filled raviloli in a buttery lobster sauce. Just the right potion for not being too heavy, but also enough for me to have a bite. My truffle and lobster gnocchi arrived at the same time as his third course, just as it should. My pasta was unbelieably wonderful, the truffle salt was a perfect balance of saltiness to the buttery rich lobster. Plenty of lobster in the dish in terms of value and the noodles were perfectly cooked. His kobe was equally well cooked and seasoned. \n\nTo top it off the dessert also blew us both away, a chocolate covered gnache type ball with warm sauce, and hazelnut gelatto. The second best part of the overall meal, second to the gnocchi. Our waiter was quick, respectful and pleasant.\n\nA great experience which puts Fiamma right up there as a contender for me in my Vegas dining adventures."

We chose to eat at Fiamma because every item on the menu sounded great. It just had to be a win-win.\n\nI'm a wee bit particular about where I sit in a restaurant that I know with cost $100 for dinner for two. The staff here were more than accommodating when I wanted to sit at a table other than the one the hostess had originally seated us at. Big plus to be so chill.\n\nWe ordered the braised short rib with Parmesan risotto (I died after eating it), red onion croutons, and a wine reduction sauce. I even licked the sauce off of the dish. It. Was. So. Good.\n\nWe also got the gnocchi with lobster, mushrooms, and black truffles. I don't really care too much about truffles, but this dish was absolutely decadent. We washed it down with a great malbec off of the extensive wine list.\n\nTo finish off a fabulous meal, we had the crochette's with hazelnut, chocolate, and caramel sauce. I don't know how I managed to fit dessert in, but it was an awesome, delicious, and simple choice. Splurge, and have a nice night at Fiamma :)"

My inner monster was beginning to emerge after not being fed in five hours, and we were happy to sit down to a nice meal. Fiamma was no disappointment! Classy and cool, this place offers a nice ambiance alongside some gooood food.\n\nTo start with, we ordered the grilled ahi tuna, which consisted of three healthy pieces of ahi drizzled with an olive puree, sitting alongside a light green salad and a slice of vegetable terrine. VERY tasty...I particularly enjoyed the spicy peppered edge of the ahi, and the rest melted in my mouth. I'd never had vegetable terrine before...it was a roll of sliced vegetables, kind of hard to describe but very interesting and very good. For our entrees my husband ordered the orecchiette and I ordered the trio of gnocchi. Everything was chock full of nice, savory flavor. Yay for my gnocchi...what an awesome way to sample three amazing dishes. I had almost ordered the full plate of lobster gnocchi, and was thrilled I hadn't because the pumpkin gnocchi was mouth-wateringly, mind-blowingly good...I mean, poppy seeds, ricotta, walnuts, and PUMPKIN? I literally haven't stopped thinking about that dish. The lobster gnocchi and bolognese gnocchi were also pretty great...and though the plate of three portions initially looked small, it was pretty filling (I guess it is gnocchi, after all). \n\nDessert was the crocchete...donuts with dipping sauces! I almost died from the quantity...I normally dominate dessert, but had to convince the hubby to eat more than the one he tried to conclude the meal with in order to prevent myself from entering a donut coma or having a donut heart attack (self control is not my strong suit :/ ). I think there were about ten of the donuts in there...probably best to share with a group. The dipping sauces were fab, though :) :)\n\nKind of a pricey experience; our total without tip was about $140 for the appetizer, two entrees, dessert, and two glasses of wine...but we left full and very happy. My only regret? Not returning the next day for an order of pumpkin gnocchi...no joke. I may chase that gnocchi back to Vegas sooner than I'd planned..."

The salad I ordered had clearly been made well in advance and stored, while not uncommon it was a little too obvious in this case.  While I could live with that, I had the same entree I tried months earlier as a fair comparison.  Pappardelle is one of my absolute favorites, but this version struck out for a second time.  Many of the noodles were stuck together which is a complete no-no and the sauce, a lamb ragout, was tepid at best even as it arrived.  Considering it was only 7pm and the restaurant was maybe half full, the above is unforgivable.\n\nWith so many wonderful options in the MGM alone, this is not a destination I'll repeat."

Our waitress was Monica who attended to our needs including drinks; we wanted to share the food so when the items were only 3 pieces - she made sure there were 4. The manager and wine manager were very accomodating. The food was also timed perfectly.  We didn't wait 30 minutes from appetizer to entree to dessert.  They were so nice to put birthday/anniversary dessert.  I'd go back again and quite surprising for a Las Vegas restaurant.  It's a great place to take both adventurouspeople and no so.  They had the best spaghetti and kobe beef meatballs; great grilled octopus; delicious skirt steak.  I recommend sharing the plates with your party so you can try more things on the menu."

We had to change our reservation time a few times, and they were more than accommodating.\n\nThe menu is pretty large and balanced - plenty of appetizers, salads, pastas, and main courses to choose from (and dessert!). I settled on the special pasta for the day which was the penne in a cream truffle sauce with pancetta and peas. I thought it was really good! Could have used a touch more salt for my taste, but that's my preference, nothing to knock the dish for. My friend had the short rib ravioli and she devoured it within a few minutes (sorry if you are reading this, but, you did). My other friend got the mezzaluna, and hers was by far my favorite dish of all of ours. The cherry tomato sauce was tangy and tasty and the filling was flavorful (ricotta, basil)\n\nI was really impressed by the extensive wine list. They have glasses ranging from $8 for the wine liker and more expensive for the wine afficionado. You can definitely find something of your taste and your budget. And they have so many wines - over 200 I would say. I would die to see their wine cellar.\n\nService was excellent from the moment we arrived and were greeted by the hostess, to our server, to the management who came over to ensure everything was going well. I would definitely go back the next time I am in Vegas!\n\nThe restaurant is also absolutely beautiful. And, we had a seat where you could do a ton of people watching of people walking through the MGM. Win win!"

            "review": "My wife and I decided to walk around the strip and find somewhere to eat. I had read reviews on Yelp about Fiamma and had also seen in recommended on other websites as well. Normally I'm not huge on Italian, but my wife loves it and rarely gets to eat it these days. Anyway, we were walking through the MGM Grand and I see Fiamma. All I could think was that I was outrageously underdressed. I was wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and chucks. I have plenty of nice clothes with me on the trip but I was just into something more casual on this particular evening. My wife spotted a few people that were inside that also seemed to be dressed very casually. We decided to try to get in and low and behold, absolutely no problem. They even seated us directly next to the edge of the restaurant so that people walking through the casino could see us. \n\nWhat I begin to think was \"okay, so not only do you not care about how I'm dressed, but you're alright with all the other people walking around seeing that I'm underdressed which will attract more people here.\" To me that is a sign that they're really not doing all that well. The restaurant does go pretty far back, so maybe this is just where they sit assholes that show up without a collared shirt. I dunno. The music blaring in the MGM Grand was also very annoying.\n\nOur server was very lackluster, but I try as hard as I can to not put too much emphasis on service when I rate somewhere. Everyone has a very different idea of what they like in service and I know that I'm somewhat picky when it comes to what I like and what I don't like. One thing is for sure, that if I've literally taken one bite of my food and you come and ask me \"how is everything?\" you can count on me being pretty annoyed with you. Anyway, I could go off on this tangent forever.\n\nThe food! I ordered the raviolini which was literally the redemption of this place. It was outstanding! Full of flavor and cooked properly! The black truffles added a nice earthiness to the meal that was much needed to get through the sauce. Now, my wife ordered a special of the day that was some sort of pasta with a heaping number of truffles! She let me try a bite and I must say that my choice was the better one.\n\nService: 2 stars.\nAmbiance: 2 stars (maybe in the back of the restaurant where I didn't feel like I was still inside the casino it would've been better)\nFood: 4 stars."

We only had an our to eat and we pretty much had a 3 course meal in that time. I also loved the cocktails, a great martini selection. But still they were $14 a pop. I know, I know it's Vegas.

We were both pleased with our choice of Fiamma.\n\nThe space is very attractive. It is well decorated, lit dimly but no so dimly you can't read the menu without holding a candle to it (doncha hate that?) and it even has a nice modernist gas-burning fireplace. The staff is as attractive as the space, which is never a requirement but also appreciated, but only if they are competent as well as gorgeous. They seem to be here at Fiamma.\n\nSo with all that yummy before you order a thing, how's the food? Not a disappointment! In fact, it was very good. I had the spaghetti with Kobe meatballs. It was very tasty. My only complaint was that they were a bit heavy-handed with the sauce. For dessert we had something that was basically beignets, but I forgot what they called them. Doughnut-somethings? They were delicious and came with 3-4 different dipping sauces.\n\nFinally, the prices. I feel like I say the same thing in all of my Vegas restaurant reviews.... it's a restaurant in a hotel on the Strip. Most places in the country this restaurant might be considered overpriced, but it was pretty much the norm for the Strip."

Well did I choose wrong.  I reserved the private peanut shell of a room for 50 guest. When we got there the Tables weren't ready! They had no water and it was not set. Absolutely nothing.  We logged the room for 2 hours.. So that we could enjoy the evening..  The water took almost an hour to get.. Then the Salads took about 45 mins to get after that. Then the pasta Dish came out ( which was the only thing that came out tasting great and came in a reasonable time. Then The Main Course.... HORRIBLE.  Last time I checked when you serve a wedding party the Bride and Groom get served first.... But 4 hours into dinner services and we were the last ones to get served.  My Meat was so Raw that it was still beating.  So I sent it back. They asked if I wanted i anything else and I looked that the manager and was like, \"are you kidding me its MIDNIGHT! and you have ruined the whole evening.. Dinner should have been served at 9pm! just bring out the damn cake so we can get the hell out of here. So they bring out my cake with adorning cup cakes.. I asked for a marble cake with buttercream.. Cake Was Dry  and the buttercream was horrible! nothing had flavor.. The best that they could do to accommodate us was give us Lemon-Cello's and mine and my new husbands dinner for free... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!  another thing I just remembered.. we asked for a veggie dish to be served to some of my guest and the veggies were raw and not cooked all the way through. and I had a friend who asked for no peanuts in the salad and what do they serve Peanuts in it.. Are you trying to kill my friends... Seriously. horrible experience. \n\nUnderstand I have worked in the Restaurant Business and there is a way to handle a wedding party and how they did it was unacceptable. Thumbs down ALL THE WAY!!!  never Again!"

Through some of the games she played on Facebook, she was able to score us a free bottle of wine from this restaurant, which was the main reason we chose to eat here.  We also used a comp to score $40 off.  This is an Italian joint that's located in the MGM Grand.  We were both a little full from lunch, so we just went with entree's, along with the free bread.  The free bottle of wine we got was pinot grigio.  It was quite good, as evidenced by us finishing off the whole bottle. :)  For dinner my wife ordered the lobster gnocchi, while I had the seafood risotto, which included scallops and shirmp.  Both dishes were very good.  The $40 comp left us with a total bill of about $27, which was quite a deal for this place.  Many of the entree's here are north of $30, but then again, so are the entrees at most all of the nicer restaurants in Vegas.  This place is very contemporary on the inside, and we had a nice spot to people watch.  While the food was very good, I would say the only negative to this place was the service.  We must've waited at least 30 minutes from the time we finished our meal until the time we finally were able to pay our check.  Our waiter was MIA forever trying to correct our bill.  It was frustrating as we were ready to go.  All in all, I thought the food here was good, but I won't go out of my way to come back here."

The host staff was very friendly and more than accommodating in our request for a different table.  Tim our server was professional yet charismatic and suggestive in dishes and beverages he liked.  The restaurant is clean and was very well maintained  throughout our two and a half hour dinner.  We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer.  This Calamari is different than most because it's served with crispy Pepperoncini that gave a great tart-vinegar balance to the fried Calamari.  It's served with a Basil Tocco sauce that was a little heavy for me but still very enjoyable - in moderation.  Both cocktails were terrific.  She loved the Blood Orange Margarita (made with puree) and the Dark Stormy cocktail I ordered was just what I was looking for.  Rarely do I ever order the same entree as my date but this deal was too good to miss.  Bone-in Ribeye Steak and Lobster for $75 each.  The steak was cooked to a perfect temperature but the meat itself was a little tough.  I still devoured it and it wasn't so bad that I once thought about sending it back.   Overall a great experience and I will definitely be back"

For my main course I ordered the Raviolini-Short Rib Ravioli, Black Truffle Cream, Vegetable Confetti, Red Wine Demi-Glace.  This dish was pretty good but it didn't knock my socks off, I felt that it was lacking in flavor.  A couple of other dishes that was ordered were the Lobster Gnocchi-Maine Lobster, Wild Mushrooms & Leek In Black Truffle Cream Sauce...truffle makes everything better!  And an off the menu Truffle Risotto.  I had a bite of both and both dishes and were pretty tasty.  We all shared desert...Mascarpone creme bruleee, and the Tiramisu both deserts were amaz!"

Their credit card machine was having a problem processing my discover card. We kept waiting and waiting and waiting. Then, they convinced me to try another card, which was not working either, so clearly the problem was from them, not me, However, the waiter persuaded me to call my bank, and check. I was placed on hold, and my bank replied that there are no problems with my card. It took forever for us to leave this place. FOREVER, as in 45 minutes, I ve had wine, a good meal, Im ready to gamble and I felt like I was taken hostage in this nice restaurant. Im sorry, but at one point, you gotta give up, the customer comes first. Finally, I was told by the manager that the card went through but that they wont be able to issue a receipt that I could sign, so I felt kinda bad thinking, does that mean no tip for my waiter ? I told the manager that I had no cash and wanted to give a tip to the waiter , manager said not  to worry. I am pretty sure my waiter never got a tip. The whole experience left a bitter-sweet taste in my mouth. I would have expected a credit, a discount, a little something to apologize . Anyways, not sure if I ll be back."

I want to know what their training secret is! Their servers are so knowledgable about the menu, professional, polite, and very attentive. 10/5 for the service.\n\nThe cuisine here is Italian and very good. I would say the average check per person may be anywhere from $20-$60 depending on how much is ordered. To be honest, Italian food is a little rich for my liking in large portions, however, I can definitely recognize and appreciate excellent quality Italian food. \n\nI've had their short rib ravioli and their shrimp and scallop risotto. Both are phenomenal popular choices that won't disappoint! Their Grappa goes great with the food here too. Yummy! \n\nIf you're celebrating an anniversary or a special occasion, they'll genuinely congratulate you and bring out a nice little treat. I went once for a special occasion and they brought us mini creme br\u00fbl\u00e9es!\n\nIf you want to enjoy a fine dining Italian restaurant, I highly recommend Fiamma."

I'm not a fan of blue cheese and neither were my friends. We ended up picking off the cheese. The pear added a nice subtle sweetness to the greens. The best part were the candied walnuts. \n\nEntrees: We decided to play it safe and order their signature dishes. \nLobster Gnocchi - Definitely lived up to its expectations. Great dish. Very savory and just the right portion.\nShort Rib Ravioli - Also very tasty. Came with about 12 raviolis, which was a perfect split between 4 ppl. i liked this one more than the Lobster Gnocchi.\n\nWe were all full by the end of dinner. Because it's Italian food, the food is more on the heavier side, leaving us with satisfied tummies."

Our server was really friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. The wine recommendations he gave were very good and he even gave me information on a wine i wanted to buy on my own. I had a beef carpaccio appetizer that was very good, and a $85 entree that I kinda regret getting...flank steak with foie gras butter and shaved white truffle. It sounded decadent- and it was good- but for $85 it needed to blow me away, and it didn't. The steak was a little chewy and the white truffles, which i never had before, really didnt do it for me. I love black truffles, and white truffles, while more $$$, don't seem to pack the aroma and flavor punch black ones do. We got a complimentary glass of prosecco at the end of our meal, which was a nice touch. It's a shame the Fiamma in NYC closed, i would have liked to have gone there."

During my first visit to Fiamma I sat at the bar, had a few drinks and fell for the well seasoned, savoriness of beef topped with frisee, shaved fennel and celery salad and parmesan flakes. Those few bites had me thinking -- or hoping -- that the rest of their food was as good. A return visit a couple months later proved otherwise.\n\nTheir bread basket was full of dry and crumbly focaccia. Short rib ravioli was mushy with a sweetness from the sauce that was overpowering. A surf and turf nightly special consisted of a mediocre lobster tail and a dry-aged rib eye with a red wine demi glaze that was the highlight of the meal.\n\nWhat was worse than the food was the atmosphere, or more specifically, the temperature. It was unusually cold making it one of the more uncomfortable dining experiences in a while. We were ready to head until they brought out a complimentary dessert for my wife's birthday. The tiramisu was a solid rendition, but we were in such a hurry to leave that nothing could have saved our meal.\n\n2.5 Stars"

The wine coinsurer introduced himself and helped my boyfriend and I pair a wonderful red wine with our meal. \n\nI had the ravioli special, which had mariposa cheese, veal and sausage. Lets just start by saying that was the absolute best ravioli I've ever had. My boyfriend had a simple cheese and spinach ravioli which was pretty good, but we both decided, nothing near comparison to mine. It literally melted in your mouth. I was savoring every last bite. I didn't want it to end. We also shared the grilled asparagus. It wasn't overcooked and it was seasoned very well. \n\nThe service was amazing. Our server asked what our night looked like and we told him we had a show to attend at 7, so he made sure to have our check ready promptly by 630. He brought us complimentary dipped biscotti. \n\nThis is the closest thing I've found to fine, authentic Italian. I'll definitely be going back.

The bartender even poured us a complimentary round of a nice-er champagne because it was my boyfriend's birthday. This last time I visited we had a party of 8 (most of who were 45 minutes late) and when everyone got there, we were immediately seated without trouble even though we were past our reservations by almost an hour on a Saturday night. \n\nNow on to the food... I had the lobster gnocchi which is as decadent and indulgent as it gets (it's pretty heavy).  The gnocchi are the prefect texture and together with the lobster just melt in your mouth. Other dishes at the table were the Fillet... super tender and juicy and served with an awesome potato side, the small rib-eye and lobster which I was told was divine, and my favorite (I might or might not have had several bites) was the Nodino... a veal shank in a Cabernet mushroom sauce. The veal was succulent and flavorful and the mushrooms were to die for. \n\nThe ambiance is really cool too. Nice bar/waiting area with a big roaring glass fireplace and leather couches and cubes. There is a nice amber-colored glow for lighting and deep espresso wood to break up the restaurant. Very different and very calming. \n\nAll in all, this is definitely one of my favorite Vegas haunts and I highly recommend testing it out next time you want to venture to the MGM."

The first time we came here my husband got a $12 beer I think but it was so good he started ordering them online when we got back to CA :) But if you are looking for a nice dinner out while in Vegas, definitely try this place because the food is so good. \n\nOH, and I almost forgot the best part. For our dessert, they asked if we wanted the standard desserts from the large party menu or a wedding cake. I opted for the wedding cake so we wouldn't have to hire another person to do that. We were so impressed with the outcome. The only input I had to give was the flavors/ colors I wanted and I showed them our wedding website and asked if they could do something like it. It was like something straight outta Cake Boss! It was so well detailed. I guess the chefs here can do anything. It looked great and tasted great too. \n\nThank you Fiamma, and hats off to the chef! :)"

Perhaps its because we were a party of three hot girls? haha. I kid.\n\nThe three of us ordered the prix fixe menu, and each ordered something different so we'd be able to sample everything on the menu. \n\nAppetizers\n- Arancine (Braised Kobe Beef Risotto Cake, Pomodoro, Parmigiano Fonduta): this one was a bit disappointing - tasted like risotto rolled into a ball with pomodoro sauce. where was the kobe?\n- Calamari (Crispy Calamari, Pepperoncini, Basil Tocco): one of the best calamari I've ever had. it was perfectly seasoned\n- Carpaccio (Thinly Sliced Prime Filet of Beef, Arugula, Parmigiano, Black Truffle): oh how i love meat. this one was simply delicious. black truffle was a nice touch\n\nEntrees\n- Raviolini (Short Rib Ravioli, Barbera Wine, Imported Pecorino Romano): flavor of this was delicious, but the short rib filling distracted from the ravioli and sauce. short rib was too...stringy for such a pasta dish\n- Linguini (Saut\u00e9ed Prawns, Smoked Bacon, Tomato, Basil, Roasted Garlic Butter): the texture of the linguini was insane. i couldn't get over how thin the multi-colored linguini was, and how it blended perfectly with the other flavors. yum.\n- Spaghetti (Fresh Cut \"Chitarra\" Spaghetti, Kobe Meatballs, San Marzano Pomodoro): good, but tasted like your typical spaghetti. nothing fancy, couldn't tell that the meatballs were made with ground kobe beef.\n\nDessert\n- Chocolate tiramisu: nice portion of chocolate tiramisu in a chocolate encasing, with chocolate cream on top and a spoon of delicious fudge on the side\n- panna cotta with honey and figs: figs seemed a little distracting, but the texture of the panna cotta was perfect, with subtle hints of honey drizzled around. quite delicate and of course, delicious\n- sorbet: like any other sorbet, three flavors, huge scoops\n\nWe also got a bottle of red wine. Three girls, too much food, we sadly did not finish everything. I was very satisfied with my dining experience here, and it didn't hurt that our waiter resembled Scott Speedman.

We actually backed off from the drinks and desert just because our entrees and the service were so bad; left there and went to Emeril's for our finishing touches.   I had spaghetti and meatballs - because I was craving it - and got a dirty look from the waiter, as if I was ordering cheap off the menu.  The spaghetti was an over-cooked pile of mush, the meatballs very dense and unseasoned and the sauce tasted like it just came out of Chef-Boryardee's can of ravioli (you know the taste, you have fed this to your kids!).  I was shocked.  My husband's pasta dish was edible but absolutely nothing to scream about.  I will say the appetizer of lobster bisque was very tasty, but also very pricey with very little lobster.   We chose this restaurant specifically because it was in the MGM Grand where we would afterwards enjoy Neil Diamond's last concert of his current tour.  The only good thing this restaurant did for us was to play Neil's music in anticipation of the concert and we enjoyed watching several tables of people signing along who also had tickets.  One lady even told us when we were leaving \"see you there!\"  Well, anyway, we got out of there as quickly and painlessly as possible and took ourselves to Emeril's for a wonderful desert and several cocktails before heading to the show.  Really too bad we did not book for dinner at Emeril's.  All I can say is..... shame on you Fiamma's for almost ruining a night we had looked forward to for NINE months!"

I recommend the Caesar salad to start with.  For my entr\u00e9e I went with the spaghetti & meatballs normally boring but this was a thicker spaghetti which I liked and Kobe meatballs which were delicious and worth the extra $8.

It was popped down in front of us with no explanation of the cheeses or meats.  We yelled, yes yelled, at the staff at the front of the house after waiting 10+ minutes for the staff to come back to the table, and the three of them that were there just chatted away without a care in the world to the patrons.  Finally we got the wait staff and they ended up wrongly explaining the plate, and arguing with us about what was beef and what was considered pork.  Bad!  My brother got the calamari app which was to come with fried peppercini's - but there wasn't a single one (this after the waitress told us how amazing they were).  We got the peppercini''s after showing the server there were none in the actual appetizer (and they continued to argue they were in there, but they weren't lol) , but they were not breaded/fried/or tasty.  They were soggy disgusting glop.  Server was horribly rude in pointing out everything we were eating... *those are calamari* on the calamari appeitzer.  Honey - this wasn't the first place we've eaten at.  What a bitch.  Salads were wilted and not deserving of the price at all.  Worst of all is that we felt horribly rushed.  Entree's were served with appetizers barely eaten.  We have eaten at some wonderful places where the price is expensive but worth it due to staff attention - Fiamma's  is NOT one of those places.  I gave it two stars solely because after I asked for a manager, he seemed to actually care.  We got some dessert out of it, but at the end of the day, if you want good food, and feel appreciated as a customer, skip Fiamma's.  Go to Spago's at Caesar's Palace to see what a wonderful dinner is truly about.\n\nETA - my brother ended up with food poisoning later that night, most likely from the calamari.    Seriously, skip this joint.  With all the wonderful and safe food offerings in Vegas, this one is not.  I put it back to one star considering my brother was sick later.  Ugh."

I consider myself a knowledgeable and picky eater, and Fiamma was RAPTURE.  \n\nWe decided to go for the tasting menu of two appetizers, three entrees, two desserts, assuming we'd get cute little portions.  Since we loved the sound of the entire menu, this afforded a chance to try a bit more of things, and for $60 a person, seemed fair.  We had cesear salad, carpaccio, seafood risotto, rigatoni with an amazing ragu, and the shortrib, plus a chocolately dessert and a cheesecakey dessert.\n\nThe flavors were sublime.  Complex, deep flavors, with nice twists (like a bit of mushroom on the carpaccio).  Everything was cooked perfectly (including perfect al dente pasta) and presented wonderfully.  A subtle hint of lemon in the risotto, the layered seasonings on the short rib, everything to perfection.\n\nThe service was good--we told them we were in a hurry and they had no issue serving us quickly, but made it feel unrushed.  And the portions--lordie--we THOUGHT this was a tasting menu, with small portions, but I am pretty sure we had full servings of everything.  We had late night dessert and lunch the next day, and still had more leftovers.  Fiamma served up the best ratio of quantity to quality I've ever seen.\n\nI feel Fiamma is perfect for a special occassion, but fine for a more casual night out, good for a romantic dinner, or good for friends or business.  It can be hard to find a restaurant with such a flexible style, especially in Vegas.\n\nI REALLY wish Fiamma was here in the bay area, it would be a regular haunt."

We split the baked lasagna, Lobster cannelloni each were baked in the oven in individual dishes, beautiful presentation.  I have to say the lasagna noodles were a little over cooked and thick for me. I love when my lasagna has hundreds of thin layers of pasta.    The lobster cannelloni was probably my least favorite dish. The lobster sauce had a odd flavor.  I was expecting lobster meat in the cannelloni versus just a flavored lobster cream sauce. The reason I am giving 5 stars to this restaurant is mainly based on this one dish that actually left me speechless.  I am still thinking/dreaming about this dish.  We ordered the Raviolini which is small raviolis with a braised short rib filling in a black truffle crema...This dish was out of this world!! The truffle crema  was phenomenal.  We were literally licking the plate! For dessert we order the ricotta cheese crochette, which is  ricotta cheese donuts with a raspberry and chocolate dipping sauce....YUM! We also ordered the tiramisu, Both desserts were TDF.   All in all great meal and night!!"

For us non-smokers it really ruins the experience and interferes with the flavors on the dish.  The clusted 3-pack of waitstaff at the front desk were very distractable and could have done a much better job of getting us seated and making us feel welcome.  The FOOD was tasty but rich.  If I lived in Vegas I would have taken it home with me, but as a visitor I had to let half the plate go back to the kitchen (can't eat high volume when it's that rich)."

            "review": "We had tickets to Ka so we decided to just make a \"date night\"-type evening by getting reservations at Fiamma. We were told by the concierge when we made the reservations that the dress code for Fiamma is supposed to be business casual - collared shirts included. We had expected to dress up for at least one meal during our Vegas stay, so we were well-prepared. However, when we showed up at Fiamma, we were surprised (and a little put-off) by the number of people that failed to adhere to the dress code, which is noted on the website as well as by the MGM staff.  There was a fair amount people in casual clothing as though they literally just walked in from sight-seeing all day in shorts and sandals. \n\nIn any event, the Fiamma staff, and our server in particular, were stellar and very friendly. Even the managers stopped by a few times to check on us. Compared to our experience at Fleur the night before, the Fiamma staff definitely was better and more attentive. The staff was also very knowledgeable about the menu and food in general and based upon their explanations and questioning, I'm guessing they get a fair amount of guests that aren't really that knowledgeable about food and wine. \n\nThis evening, we ordered/tried:\n\n- Crispy calamari: This came with a lot more tentacles than the \"rings\", which doesn't bother me, but important to note in case you are with diners that won't eat calamari tentacles. Generally speaking, the batter was light and crispy, and the tiny fried pieces of zucchini and pepperoncini were unexpected but tasty. The tomato aioli is a great accompaniment and we preferred that over the marinara. \n\n- Traditional potato gnocchi with lobster, mushrooms and black truffles: If you like black truffles and mushrooms, this is definitely the dish for you. The sauce is literally a powerhouse of mushrooms and truffles. The lobster bites themselves are tasty but generally speaking, the mushroom sauce takes center stage. The gnocchi is definitely housemade and pillow-y with a slight bite. \n\n- Scallops and prawns risotto: This came with three large bay scallops and three huge wild prawns. The scallops were cooked well, though I personally prefer a little more caramelization than this. The prawns were very fresh and cooked perfectly through. The risotto was cooked with just enough moisture left in it that it didn't turn into a paste as it cooled. Too often, risotto is served without enough moisture and it congeals into an unappetizing mess. Here, the risotto remained consistent and \"smooth\". \n\n- Torta al cioccolato: We went with the recommendation of the server, who said this is one of the signature desserts at Fiamma. Maybe it is because I was really full at this point, but I didn't love it as much as I thought I would. I prefer a more gooey, rich chocolate cake and this one was more cakey than gooey. I think it needed more ganache and mousse. This came with chocolate gelato, which tasted very much like a fudgsicle. \n\n- Fiamma \"The Original\" (cocktail): My husband really liked this one (enough to order multiples of it). It wasn't sweet at all, which is probably why I wasn't personally a fan. \n\n- Kerry's Strawberry Balsamic (cocktail): This was much sweeter than \"The Original\" and I liked it a lot. There was a hint of the berry which worked with the white balsamic. Nothing overpowered the other so it all blended together quite harmoniously. \n\n- Moscato D'Asti (Tintero): Our server treated us to this as a palette cleanser before the dessert and it was actually quite good. I'm generally quite fond of sparkling wines (especially the very sweet ones) and this definitely was on the sweet side (more so than the cocktails actually).\n\n- Complimentary bread basket: Okay, so I don't normally review the bread basket, but I really liked the cheese cracker/flatbread that arrived. It was light and crunchy with just the right amount of cheese. The olive oil that came with the bread basket was nice too, with just a hint of olive versus a \"bam, in your face\" olive flavor.\n\nI think the food is more of a 4 star, but the service was impeccable and very friendly, so that bumped it up to a 5 star rating for me."

Altogether, it is a wonderful dish and I will always order it when I go to Fiamma.  \n\nMy husband went with the halibut special that night.  There were artichokes around it and it was very tasty.  I am nit a huge fish fan, but I could have eaten the whole dish as well.\n\nThe one thing that really pleased me this trip was the recognition of our anniversary.  When in Vegas, it is fun to be treated special and everyone knows Vegas will treat you well and I have witnessed restaurants doing small things for customers who were celebrating.  That said, I mentioned our anniversary to four restaurants when making my reservations and Fiamma was the only one that did anything.  Our waiter brought us both a glass of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary before he did anything else.  I truly appreciated it.  Thanks, Fiamma, for always delivering."

It had all the credentials of somewhere great but it really fell short for us. \n\nWe had their first reservations as we had to make it to KA,  so we ended up being seated in the bar for a bit while the got organized for dinner.   The bartenders here did a great job,   There were very patient while FMIL selected a wine letting her try several.  I choose a blood orange belini and it was very tasty.  I don't recall what my fiance picked but it was also really good when I stole some sips.  The drinks here were expensive.  I think the three pre diner drinks still came to a $80 tab (but that might have been after tipping) which is pricey but atleast there were good.\n\nThe food really fell flat for me.\n\nThe bread basket came out with olive oil that was stale.  We asked for a new dish but that one came back stale.  When we mentioned the oil to server he said a bunch of the kitchen tried it and said it was fine including the chef but he'd go get another dish.   The third dish was infinitely better and he said it was from a different can.   I honestly should have been concerned about the palates in the kitchen when I was told the chef couldn't taste that the oil had gone off.... but yet we stayed and ultimately paid for that choice. \n\nI ordered the feature minestrone soup which was under seasoned and some kind of pasta dish I barely remember (it was unremarkable).  The pasta was a bit over cooked but I liked the sauce.  The food didn't do much for the others at my table.  MY fiance found a piece of shell from the seafood (lobster perhaps..) in one of his pasta trio dishes.  We didn't have time for a remade pasta but they brought us an ice cream coffee thing as an apology for the shell which really helped make the experience a bit better. \n\nAlthough our food fell flat,  our server worked his butt off to help make it right where he could (when we felt like discussing the low points like the oil or the shell but we didn't complain about the seasoning or over cooked pasta).  From the service side I was quite pleased.  \n\nThis place is pricey but we expected it.  Unfortunately it wouldn't have been good food for even 1/3 or 1/2 the price.  For that reason I would never return and I think it's a bit over rated.  There are too many amazing Vegas spots that to have a return trip here.  Fiamma is right next to several of the better dining spots at MGM and I wimpered a little as I was leaving the restaurant  and seeing the other signs of places I could have eaten at instead.   That is life I guess."

After being seated, we waited almost 30 minutes before our server took our order!  The restaurant was pretty much empty, so there was no excuse for this!  We had a table of 14 so all attention should have been on us as far as great service.  NOT!  I ordered the most basic thing there... spaghetti... after another 45 minutes... it finally arrives!  That's almost 1.5 hours gone before even seeing my food!  Remember, the place was practically empty!  Then my $26 spaghetti with kobe beef meatballs... was awful.  I eat at nice restaurants quite often... so I know what great food and service is like.  Fiamma was quite the contrary that night.  Food was somewhat cold and sauce was terrible.  4 of my guest had this same spaghetti meal... and we all agreed!  Then there was a problem with the bill.  It took another 30 minutes after eating to receive bill!  We were constantly waiting and waiting after asking for check!  Then there were a few wrong charges on the bill.  Our waiter was terrible.  For a party our size... the manager should have come out to see if everything was OK.  No one ever asked us anything.  We all hated the place and left with a bad experience.  Plus, I was still hungry since I didn't even finish my food.  FIAMMA is not worth the price or the trip when there are better restaurants in the same area.  I had a much better experience and food at Emeril's which is a couple doors down, the night before.  FIAMMA ruined my bachelor party dinner on a Saturday night!"

It may be because, as the server informed us, they had just did a 180 change on their menu just a couple days ago. (The menu online as of now doesn't reflect the menu we had just 2 days ago)\n\nTo start, we had a fried ball of cheese and some other goodness. Difficult to describe. . . but it was amazing! I'm sure if you want to order it you can probably just describe to them that you want a fried ball that has alfredo sauce in the middle. We imagined it to be tiny, but the portion was pretty large. \n\nFor entrees, we had short ribs ravioli which was interesting and delicious. We were expecting about 5 or 6 raviolis, but nope, they gave a plate full and each was stuffed with lots of meat. Yum! And we also ordered the risotto with sea scallops. The risotto was cooked just right, not overly buttery or oily, and was flavorful and not too hard. \n\nI'd definitely recommend! :) Total bill for appetizer, 2 entrees, and 1 soft drink after tax and tip was around $75."

It made me wish that we had ordered two of those instead of the lobster gnocchi. \n\nAll in all a great meal and convenient for anyone staying at MGM or seeing KA."

I had a good feeling when the greeter told us our server would be 'Dallas', since I live in the DFW area... it was just meant to be.  Dallas was a great server, very knowledgeable about the menu - I always give servers at Italian restaurants a menu-workout since I cannot eat basil which is ubiquitous in many dishes.  But, she knew right away which dishes I would be fine with and which I should avoid.   She also gave me a great recommendation when I asked for a cocktail that was sweet and not too strong -- the pear martini was AMAZING.  It tasted like a slightly spiked pear juice.  Probably my favorite boozy drink I have had in years.  I could have drank a 32 oz. big gulp of that stuff (though I probably wouldn't have been able to walk afterwards) -- so a martini size portion was very nice.\n\nI ordered the grilled tiger prawns for a starter and the osso buco as my entree.  Both were terrific.  The prawns appetizer comes with four good sized prawns over a bed of a puttanesca/marinara type sauce -- tomatoes & capers.  Very, succulent and tasty.  The osso buco comes in a bath of sauce with vegetables and mini gnocchi/spaetzle - I think I enjoyed the bath even more than the meat itself, though the meat was fork tender, melt in your mouth.  I think Dallas said the meat was marinated many hours in Peroni beer, but it did not have a beer taste.\n\nThere was a good delay between courses but Dallas did ask if we were in any kind of hurry, so presumably service could have been sped up if necessary, but this is the kind of meal you want to enjoy casually and not hurry.  I may try the prawn & scallop risotto next time as that sounded awfully good.  I have to go back for that pear martini though, regardless."

They accommodated a group of 9 fairly quickly (I called from our room upstairs and they were ready for us by the time we came down), despite the fact that they were obviously busy.  We were greeted multiple times at every corner of the restaurant.  They were also really great about getting food out to us quickly since we had tickets to zoomanity in less than an hour.\n\nMy husband and I split a 3-course meal (and they very nicely split our pasta into 2 dishes for us).  Nobody at the table was a particularly big fan of the bread and sweet butter...not really what we were looking for.  But, it's ok - we had ordered enough food.  We started with the beef carpaccio, which we really enjoyed - although we didn't really taste the truffle. We ordered the ravioli filled with short-rib.  Yum yum.  Very yummy.  We ended the meal with the NY strip which was also delicious, but was definitely unevenly cooked.  We had some overcooked and some undercooked meat for our medium steak.  Still flavorful.  Did not appreciate the brussels sprouts on the plate though - they were not good eats.\n\nEnded the meal with little hazelnut cakes from the chef.  A great small bite after a great meal. \n\nWe had gone in with pretty low expectations (we had been hoping for seats at Joel Robuchon, but it was completely booked) and we came out feeling rather satisfied.  We enjoyed it!"

It's a pretty loungy place and it definitely belongs in vegas, but it's definitely one of those see and be seen places. For all the hype, the food was pretty standard italian and the service was pretty stuck up and pretentious. The server gave a stink eye when we said we weren't drinking and think about splittling an appetizer?

They were lucky I stayed for the entire meal.\n\nI will admit the pasta was decent and fresh for a place of this price, why wouldn't it be. I had the rigatoni with sausage and prosciutto, and my other had the spaghetti and meatballs.

You could go to very high-end Italian restaurant in Los Angeles and order the exact same meal and it would cost at least 25% less, and maybe 50% less- yes, a pasta dish which is $30 in Fiamma would cost about $20-22 at an equivalent Italian restaurant in Los Angeles.

I assumed I was going to get the more expensive item ($44 vs. $29) - and not to my surprise I did. \n\nThe short ribs themselves were fall-off-the-bone good! The side dish was savory; and the half of glass of wine I had was also amazing. However, two hours after eating (right before KA) and 30 minutes into the show I got violently ill. It was 110 degrees out that day, I hadn't drank before dinner, and I had consumed appropriate amounts of water so I don't believe it was anything I did. But when I say I got sick, I mean really sick. None of the short rib digested and I was forced to leave the show. Not only did I lose the money I paid for KA because I had to go back to the hotel to be sick in private, but my boyfriend ended up feeling obligated to spend the night in with me instead of going out. \n\nBeware the short rib - I'm hoping it was just MY dish (it literally couldn't have been anything else) and that no one else got sick."

I don't see this as such a huge time-saving step for the kitchen so I don't understand it) with a few halves of grilled prawns.  The prawns were smallish and overly smokey tasting, and the strawberries were almost rancid.  Kind of obvious I didn't like this portion of the meal.  \nThe skirt steak with potato puree and spinach was pretty delicious though.  Cooked perfectly med rare as requested and the red wine reduction was wonderful.  The spinach was just a few raw leaves placed on top of the puree, like a garnish.  I would have liked the peppery kick of arugula instead.  The butter that came with the rolls was a very strangely sweet truffle butter.  I couldn't decide if I liked it or hated it.  I don't know that I enjoy sweet with the pungent truffle.\nThe panna cotta with figs was very nice.

I am sure there is a culinary reason, but from a practical standpoint, I thought the dish made it hard to appreciate what was truly a wonderful tomato sauce hiding underneath.\n\nLittle things make me happy, so when the overflowing plate of asparagus hit the table, my eyes lit up!

The sauce was a bit too much of a tangy red tomato sauce and the octopus had a grilled taste to it.  Good but, not great.\n\nThe portions are a decent size if you grab a salad or app before the main course.  Our waiter pushed us to add a side, so we did (we added.... Broccoli Rabe).  It was very tasty but too much food unless you are starving.  The Broccoli Rabe which is made w/ a cream, white wine sauce, ham, Broccoli Rabe, onion and maybe even pine nuts... could be a bit overwhelming  if you get a very creamy main course dish (like the gnocchi) but, it was good in any case.  Oh yea... for those who are not fans of Broccoli... it isn't your traditional broccoli... it is leafy and not stalky.\n\nWe didn't do desert, so I can't speak to that.  The service was great.

Food was fairly average Italian, service was friendly but slow, atmosphere was great, drinks were amazing, price was not terrible (as far as restaurants on the Strip go, this one could be considered \"high casual\" pricing).\n\nBlueberry Crush cocktail -- $11 -- YUM!\nMezzaluna -- $22 -- Decent, but definitely not OMG-worthy.\nCreme brulee --$10 --  Good.\n\nOur server was very nice, but we didn't see him often. The kid pouring the water had to be at most 17 years old. He kept coming over and pouring water while gazing straight ahead out into the hotel. As you can imagine, this resulted in water splashing and half-full glasses. Eh, what can you do? It provided a little entertainment! \n\nI probably won't recommend or be back again unless I'm looking for a \"cheap\" sit-down dinner before another show at the Garden Arena...or for another Blueberry Crush. :)"

When the waiter knew there was no need to \"earn\" his tips he stopped trying. The pre-fix menu items were OK. Roast chicken and Salmon were tender. Fried calamari was average, and the pasta was too salty. We were all served tiramisu as dessert even though there were other selections on the pre-fix menu.

I never sleep anywhere outside of a Wynn Hotel (past / currently owned), and after attending openings at almost every single restaurant since the construction of Hard Rock ... Fiamma is my true love that has gone unmatched.  \nExecutive Chef Carlos Buscaglia has created a true gem within the MGM family.  The fact that Fiamma has let Chef Buscaglia slide through their fingers in recent weeks due to his call to indulge in \"bigger and better things\" is a grave mistake.  It's insane to me how the owners could allow this genius (inhuman to Culinary)  escape.  Food aside.  Fiamma is Gorgeous.  Fiamma is Sexy... its Decor / Ambiance / Lighting / Mood has exactly what we all want when we visit Las Vegas.  When you mix this with a meal that will make you literally cry like a baby... Nirvana doesn't seem as distant.  \nRestaurants in Vegas strive for this, but usually come short in one of the above mentioned.  I just hope that Fiamma can find a way to maintain what Chef Carlos created throughout the past years... or spend the money and GET HIM BACK!!!  I leave you with this thought.   Clooney quoted it best after a Chef Carlos Buscaglia meal at Fiamma:  If you can't get laid after a night here... there is definitely something wrong with you."

I will say, on this latest occasion it felt very rushed. We ordered the caprese and the octopus as appetizers which arrived within 3-4 mins. But what was a little more surprising was that I hadn't finished my appetizer when the entrees arrived. I had to quickly finish off the last couple of peices of octopus (like I was gonna waste that!) so the server could clear my plate. \n\nI really don't like to be rushed when I am at a nice restaurant like this. I am paying a premium price and I like to take my time, enjoy the company and the surroundings. There were plenty of open tables so I didn't get the sense that they needed to open up space. \n\nWith that being said, the server was very good overall, the food was great...I would have liked to have seen a slightly slower pace and a bit of communication between the front of house and the kitchen as far as if the table in question was even finished."

For $22, I was impressed with the serving size (plus an entire to-go box filled with fresh bread AND their cheesy crackers). The mezzaluna was flavorful and filling. So why just 3 stars? Well, I only ate about half of the food...I started feeling sick to my stomach so I decided to quit while I was ahead. I only have one food allergy (spinach - I know, random) and that wasn't an ingredient, so I have no idea why it made me feel ill. It was good while it lasted, though!"

So, the pricey menu coupled with good reviews; I had high expectations. We started with one of their specials, lobster bisque. It was served 'table side', meaning a bowl of mixed veggies with a little lobster was brought out, followed by another person with a cup of the bisque to pour it into the bowls. It was good but I've never had a chunky bisque before. Next we had the beef carpaccio. The beef was extremely tender, it was sticking to the plate and turning into mush when we tried to get with our fork. So far, everything was different but okay. For my entree, I ordered the traditional spaghetti and Kobe beef meatballs. This is how I normally rate any restaurant, by their basic dishes.  The spaghetti was terrible!!! It was worse than a can of Chef Boyardee. The noodles size and texture were like chow mien noodles. The sauce were so salty, I can feel my blood pressure rising with each noodle I ate. Yes, I had to eat my spaghetti strand by strand so I wouldn't consume so much of the 'heart attack' sauce. The meatballs were mushy, just like the meatball you would get out of the Spaghetti O's cans. I only managed to choke down a few bites. It's a good thing their portions are so small, I didn't feel bad about throwing so much food. Hubby had some kind of raviolis. He said it was ok, nothing to rave about. We spent over $100 and were still hungry. We ended up going to McDonald's for something more edible. The only reason this place even got 2 stars from me is because the service was good. Learn from our mistakes.....don't even bother with this place. Throw your money away on the slots, you'll be just a full as we were."

Your restaurant was not even busy and you put 12 of us around a table you normally would put 8.

We waited for our table in a lounge area near the bar with an glass encased fireplace and modern couches. Had a lime martini - first one was pretty good and light on the simple syrup. The second one, not so much. Way too sweet, but was easily fixed by the bartender.\n\nFiamma has the multiple server thing going on, almost to the point of confusion. Hmmm who should we ask for drinks, food...??? We were presented with the \"bottled\" or \"still\" water question, to which my sister stupidly said \"still.\" For a table of 13, imagine the number of dollars, ca-ching! The table bread was odd for an Italian restaurant, it was closer to an Indian naan. It was good, but just odd. The menu had so many great sounding choices, it was hard to pick! \n\nWhat 3 of us decided on:\n\nRAVIOLINI\nShort Rib Ravioli, Barbera Wine\nImported Pecorino Romano \n\nSPAGHETTI\nFresh Cut Chitarra Spaghetti\nKobe Meatballs, San Marzano Pomodoro \n\nAGNOLOTTI\nPiemonte Ravioli, Imported Bufala Ricotta\nSpinach, Crushed Pomodori Pelati \n\nYum, yum, and yum. We sampled each other's food. Spaghetti was definitely homemade. Raviolini was great. The Agnolotti was what I ordered and it was my favorite. Being a cheeseaholic, I loved of this dish. \n\nWe got two birthday desserts but that was disappointing. I'd ordered the CIOCCOLATO: triple chocolate cake, godiva ganache, white chocolate gelato, berry gelatina, but it never made its way to the table. Instead they delivered the CROCHETTE: crispy amaretti doughnuts, chocolate ganache, dolce di latte, cinnamon glaze, which I definitely could have left. I wasn't even hungry come dessert time, but I thought it was on the house for the birthday and I figured I'd share it.  Alas, they charged for the desserts. Ridiculous even though I hadn't even wanted those little chocolate donut holes (which were not amazing at all). But after some coaxing, the server (rightfully) removed the charge. Next time, I shall get my Cicollato!!!"

I started with the Capesante (grilled scallops, spinach, crispy onions, with a smoked bacon vinaigrette). This dish was perfect. I loved every bite and I loved the smokiness of the scallop and bacon. We also ordered the braised Kobe beef risotto cake. There were actual chunks of kobe beef rather than ground meat, which I appreciated. It tasted so good. For an entree I had the rigatoni with prosciutto, sausage bolognese and parmesan. It was delicious. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was chunky and flavorful. My wife had the gnocchi with lobster, portabello, and black truffle crema. She loved every bite of hers. We couldn't stop commenting on how good the food was. For dessert I had the tartufo--a dolce di latte gelato, with caramelized hazelnuts, a chocolate dome, and a warm chocolate sauce. It was awesome. So rich and delicious.

My girlfriend and I literally talk about this mozzarella on a weekly basis. \n\n2. The lobster gnocchi dish is one of the most delicious things ever. You absolutely need to order this if you go here. \n\nEverything else served here is great as well. I've been to Vegas three times and gone to Fiamma once each trip. Awesome place!"

The food was good, but not worth the price of our $200 dinner. The appetizers were quick to the table but the mains took FOREVER to come. We won't be back."

Very nice super attentive waiter who was kind enough to check my I.D. and make me feel all young 'n shit.\n\nThe crispy garlic fried potato thing? Outta this world good. Seriously. And served in a cute little metal measuring type cup. It's the little things that amuse me.\n\nMy spaghetti and Kobe beef meatballs were excellent, a perfect portion size and just oh so yummy. If memory serves, the BFF got some piece of pork that was pretty good but nearly as big as her head so it was impossible to finish. No dessert for us since we were stuffed to the gills but our fantastic waiter brought us some little chocolate truffles anyway, woo!\n\nOn the pricey side but I would say worth it for the quality of food, service and ambience and again, this is Vegas. We did get a discount though since we were staying at the MGM."

They said we can sit down and eat but we only have one hour to order and eat for them to accommodate us. Secondly, they simply did not have good service. Our waiter didn't come back to check on us at all. And lastly, I ordered the Raviollini, the dish with the short rib meat. This dish was on the \"Chefs Favorite\" menu. Boy was my trust betrayed ordering from that part of the menu. The short rib meat was bland, sauce was bland, simply put, the entire dish was bland. Where was the flavor?! It tasted better after drowning it in parmesan. I've had better Italian at Macaroni Grill. \n\nAnd here's the worst part. \n\nI'm still hungry."

            "review": "A bit high priced for the food and service.  In pinch, they will serve food that will fill you up but I wouldn't go out of my way to come to this restaurant. \n\nI had a \"quick\" dinner here before the Stevie Wonder concert.  I ordered the penne arrabbiata with wagyu meatballs. The dish came piping hot (45 minutes later - and just past al dente) and was adequately spicy. The meatballs were tasty, if a bit on the mushy side. \n\nAs this was not a cheap eat ($30 for a pasta dish), I expected the service to be great, which it was not. If there is one thing worth complaining about, it is that the server did just enough for us not to complain too much, but not enough to make the meal anything special.  He willingly came to our table three times - once to take our order, a second time to ask us if our food was ok (someone else delivered our order) and a third time to get the bill. We called him over once to follow up our order and he very brusquely answered, \"They're plating it now.\"\n\nWhile waiting, we overheard a man at the table next to us complaining to the server about how his lamb was undercooked and that his wife's pasta was mushy. The server's response was, \"I don't cook the food, but I'll tell the kitchen.\" After hearing that, we got out of there as quickly as possible!"

The meat is tender, and an amazing sauce covers the it and the delicious roasted veggies.\n\nThe decor is great, but besides my plate and the fireplaces, I can't remember much else about the place: not what my dining partners had, nor what I ate before the entree. I think that's a good thing."

            "review": "My friends and I came here for a birthday dinner before clubbing at Hakkasan. 8 of us total. We originally wanted to go to Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill but was not able to get a table. We ended up here by chance. The hostess got us seated right away so no problems waiting, awesome. My boyfriend and I decided to share an entree because we wanted to avoid feeling heavy at the club. We also thought the entree portions were huge enough to share after we saw other tables receive their food. Some of my friends opted for the same choice of sharing entrees too. What's wrong with sharing, right? \n\nWell our waitress was apparently against it. I will get straight the the point: She ruined our night and my friend's birthday celebration with her rudeness. With an attitude, she explains to my friends that the ravioli is \"only like 6 tiny pieces\" suggesting that it was not enough for the couple to share. When my friend orders the caprses salad, she replies, \"That's it?\" Once it was my turn, I confirmed that my boyfriend and I decided to share the lobster gnocchi.  My boyfriend made a joke saying he was on a diet, and she replied, \"I don't believe it one second.\" She was completely rude to our whole table with her obnoxious attitude and monotonous tone. We all felt degraded and lost the appetite to eat. We can handle bad service at fast food joints but to be treated this way at a high end restaurant is not acceptable because we are also paying for service as well!\n\nMy friend who also ordered the lobster gnoochi to himself got the dish first. His entree comes in a rounded white full-sized plate. On the other hand, the lobster gnoochi that I ordered to have shared comes in a boat-shaped bowl, half the size of the full-size plate. The server hands us my portion of the entree and leaves. No one gave us the heads up that our entrees were going to be divided in advance. My boyfriend's portion of the entree has not arrived yet so of course I'm questioning what the heck happened...After a few minutes, our server comes back with my boyfriend's portion of the entree and then explains that it was spilt up by the kitchen which is not a problem; however, a notice would have been nice. Everyone at the table including myself was questioning if the server had thought we ordered the half portion.\n\nOn to the food...The lobster gnocchi was very heavy. And oh boy, I'm SO glad that I shared this plate with my boyfriend. The sauce was good but it made me feel uneasy afterwards. My friends who ordered the same entree felt the same way too. And I'd have to say that the lobster pieces were too small. It was good but not great. We also ordered the crispy yukon gold potatoes as a side and it failed us. It was dry and bland, not worth $10. I rather take that money and buy a bag of potatoes at the grocery store! I also tried their lasagna that my friend ordered and it was nothing spectacular. Our bill for the gnocchi and potatoes including gratitude was $58.01, what a big waste I tell you.\n\nAfter we paid for our bill, my friends who also work for the serving industry politely pulled the manager aside to explain to him our experience. As expected, he did not show any interest, tried to defend the server, and quickly just gave us a short apology. We all left this place feeling robbed. I don't ever see myself coming back but sadly I will always remember this horrible experience when I visit the strip. AHHHHH."
