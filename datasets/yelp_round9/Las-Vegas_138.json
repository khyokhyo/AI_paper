Don't know how they do it, but the pork & duck were flavorful.  \n- It's a nice restaurant and an upgrade from the typical Chinese restaurant service/decor, and the menu prices seemed to reflect that.\n- Definitely a good choice to eat a nice Chinese restaurant off-Strip."

            "review": "By far the BEST chinese food in Vegas! I love everything and everything on the menu. Two dishes that could eat eVery single day never get tired of it. Salt and pepper pork chops/ green beans with xo sauce. The salt and pepper pork chops are no words describe except need too try it. It crispy on the outside with prefect light crispy type batter, the inside is spot on moist, and the flavor there sooo much depth. U bite into crispy outside crust then hit moist spot on cook pork chop and combine it with salt/pepper flavors. Divine. The string beans with xo sauce can say EXACT same thing feel eat it. The greens beans nice green, fresh, spot on cook bean that snap into them, and the sauce that the key nice spicy but not too much. I also like their mongolian beef, and any of noodle dishes are excellent! \n\nThe waitress sometimes hit or miss keeping up with your drinks being filled. Overall never had problem with the waitstaff."

It's a regular staple and relatives from out of town know how much we love the place because we always bring them here.\n\nThe food has changed somewhat since we first started coming, probably due to some sort of change in management or in the chef, so dishes haven't been entirely consistent.  However, overall, really solid Chinese food that brings us back year after year."

            "review": "I was married to a Chinese guy before, and we would eat here frequently. They would bring us complimentary soup before our meal and bean dessert at the end. Well, I discovered if you're not \"Chinese\" you can forget about it! I even asked them for soup and the waiter said,\"You never order!\". Whatever!\n\nI did the ordering for 8 of us. I ordered deep fried flounder with garlic sauce (very good), orange chicken (for the kids), salt and pepper pork chop (soggy), fillet mignon w/ portabella mushrooms (salty and mushrooms was under cooked), beef chow fun (good), salty fish & chicken fried rice (cooked perfect), and snow peas and water chestnuts (not my favorite).\n\nOur order arrived very quickly, but the serves were all stone faces. My mom whispers over, \"The waiters aren't very joyful\". That was classic. The wait staff receives a C- grade for blah service.\n\nThe food was tasty and extremly filling, but we did a great job putting it down. The flounder was on special for half price $20. My bill was $139 including tip, for feeding 8 people it was a win win situation. \n\nThe reason I gave them 3 out of five stars is, the food was over all good, and service was fast. They lacked in personality, friendliness, and they didn't bring us any complimentary soup and bean dessert. I seen the giving the other tables, but why not us? I give them one and a half thumbs up"

And nice inside... and they accommodated our group really well with little complaint.  I'd say 4 star overall except.. for the dish I ordered.  Lucky me, we were eating family style.  I ordered the seabass mushroom claypot which sounded amazing and was the most expensive thing we ordered... but it was toooo fishy tasting.  Everything was great except for my dish.  *cry*\n\nI'd still go back... I don't hold a grudge.\n\nSee ya there."

The family ordered various items but it was my order of beef tenderloin in black pepper sauce that everyone agreed was the most popular.  The beef was oh so tender.  It was moist and soft as cotton and the flavoring was incredible.  I'd have to say this dish really made my day.  Other dishes we tried were salt and pepper tofu (very very good), eggplant in garlic sauce (good but bit too sweet), stringed beans with minced pork (fresh and very tasty) and their wonton soup (standard).  Overall, a memorable dining experience that we will repeat."

Its not the food was bad it just didnt blow me away,I find myself comparing everything to what i am used to and unfortunately it falling woefully short. The potstickers were super weak,I mean worse then supermarket frozen weak. The BBQ pork fried rice needed flavoring and was a bit on the dry side. The shrimp in lobster sauce was average. The kung po chicken was ok,and the best dish was the mongolian beef a bit of sweet and hot flavor,pretty tasty. All in all it was another just ok experience,my search continues :)"

My friend has food allergies. She really enjoys Chilean Sea Bass. We asked that the Sea Bass be steamed plain; no sauces, no seasoning. To add flavor Joyful House offered ginger with scallions. She went for it!.... and loved it....and so did we. She offered to share in her taste bud joy by letting us have a taste. It was very good!\nFor those of you allergic to soy or are going gluten free, this is a wonderful dish that offers just that. My friend is very grateful for the accommodation & sense of humor the waiter provided. Customer service that was very welcoming! Joyful house we will be brining more friends to you when we are back in town."

We're usually here with my parents because they love it as well and luckily, my mom has cravings often enough for me to have my fill. We normally order the same dishes when it's the four of us (my parents, Ruben, and myself): Salt & Pepper Calamari (BEST place to order it!), Chicken Chow Fun in Black Bean Sauce (not always consistently delicious, but I love these wide, flat, chewy noodles), Kung Pao Shrimp (my mom's favorite dish; I love picking out the peanuts hehe), Combination Fried Rice (I'm not a fan of their fried rice, but everyone else enjoys it), Chinese Broccoli, and Mapu Tofu (this time I ordered it without meat and it was still good). What a great meal. Honestly, I could come here for JUST the calamari. Very good.\n\nEven with the mostly \"just okay\" service, the food keeps bringing us back. I also appreciate the generous pot of Jasmine rice and the fantastic prices!"

The meat was tender and flavorful, and the skin was delightfully crisp. The plum sauce was pretty bad...another reviewer described it as \"industrial cleaner\"...which I'm sympathetic to. I'd definitely order this again...but will steer clear of the plum sauce. \n\nFor mains, I had the \"Salt and Pepper Pork Chops\" which many reviewers raved about. The batter and spicing/seasoning of the pork was very well done. Quite crisp and a good balance of salt/heat/batter/fat. The pork itself was quite disappointing though...very stringy, low-quality cut of pork. I would have MUCH rather had 1/2 or even 1/4 of the quantity for a better quality of pork.\n\nFor dessert I had the chocolate Mochi Ice Cream. It was served far too cold. The ice cream was actually chewy....more than a little. If served a bit warmer, it would have been good i think...the chocolate flavor was decent, the pastry wrapper was nicely done...just the temp.\n\nI think maybe I didn't order the dishes these guys do best...next time I'm going to have to try the fresh seafood. Also, the prices were quite reasonable. Appetizer, entree, dessert, and hot tea for $26 in Vegas..that's a pretty good deal."

They have a large selection of live seafood to choose from, all coming from the tanks they have in the middle of the restaurant.  A sign acts as the menu with the prices for the fresh fish and seafood of the day.  They have different sized lobsters, crab, snapper, sea bass, and many others.  Seafood is not all they do well, though.  \n\nThe Mongolian Beef is very good, as well as the Pork Chops with Salt & Pepper.  I also really like their Roasted Duck, which is a huge portion that serves a lot of people.  I usually try to come to Joyful House with a lot of people because their portions are large, making it a very affordable feast for lots of hungry people.  \n\nThe prices are a about a dollar more per item than most Chinese restaurants in the area, but it's worth it with the quality of food you get from Joyful House.  The price might also be attributed to the nicer ambiance you get here.  The waiters are professionally dressed, and the decor is fancier than most places.  The tables are well set, and the plates and silverware are even of good quality.  \n\nIf you're looking for a nice Chinese dinner with a lot of people, go to Joyful House.  Great food, great service, great restaurant!"

My favorite was the beef tenderloin saut\u00e9ed in black pepper sauce.  \nI would eat here again if I were craving Chinese food."

The 2 dishes were not too shabby but I would say that I've had better. This restaurant is nice and clean inside so if you have guests from out of town or business lunch of some sort, this place will do.The service was surprisingly good. I'm asian so I know that asian restaurants care more about how good their food is than service but this one actually surprised me on the good side."

It's about 10-15 minutes (depending on traffic) off the Strip.  The restaurant was pretty empty for a Friday night dinner, but don't let that deter you from coming here.  We had the following:\n \n1) Scallops in Black Bean Sauce - Pretty average dish.\n\n2) Pan Fried Chilean Sea Bass in Garlic Soy Sauce - This was the daily special.  It's on their regular menu, but discounted from the regular price.  It's a thick fillet, not a whole fish, and I'd go with this over the scallops.\n\n3) Crispy Fried Dungeness Crab with Salt and Pepper - I loved this dish!  The tempura batter was crisp and the seasoning was not overly salty.  The crab meat was hot and tender.\n\n4) Crispy Fried Marinated Chicken - The crispy skin was fantastic.  The meat was fine.\n\n5) Pan Fried Spinach in Garlic Sauce - Simple and good.\n\n6) Wonton Noodle Soup - Good, but pricey.\n\nI enjoyed our meal and the service was not bad with the exception of my drink order.  I wanted the Hong Kong Style Hot Tea with Cream, but they just couldn't get it right.  First, my drink never came.  We asked for it again and some more time passed before a cold mug of tea was brought out, ugh.  There wasn't even any cream in it!  We sent it back and the manager apologized for the server being new.  They have a lot of drink options, but since I didn't try mine I can't vouch for any."

They have a late happy hour menu too, as well as a regular happy hour menu so it's a perfect place to go after late drinking or gambling.  The first thing you notice is the huge banner they have that says it's been named one of the top 50 restaurants in the US by CNN, which is pretty impressive actually.  Food is really good, I've ordered the Maine Lobster cooked Chinese style with ginger and onions, about $20 per pound (advertised half off) which was about 3 1/2 pounds.  Very tasty with the shell pre-cut so it was easy to get to the lobster meat.  I also had the clay pot clams with pork dish, which was about 95% clams and onions but very little pork.  Overall very good and I'd come back again. One thing, if you come after 2:30 am they won't let you sit so you have to get takeout.  Service is good and attentive too, which can be unusual in a Chinese restaurant."

I used to be a regular a few years back, but since discovering lots of other treats around town and becoming an addict for trying something new each time I go out, I have neglected poor Joyful House. \n\nI have never had a bad meal here. They have lots of selection and their staff is extremely friendly and welcoming! Some of my favorites are Peking Duck, Eggplant and Pork Claypot, Salt & Pepper Prawns and too many more dishes that I can't think of off the top of my head. They have something for everything. Orange Blossom Beef for the less adventurous in your group or Steamed Fish and Sea Cucumber for the authentic Chinese Food Palates.\n\nThey have great hours, open late for you night owls and great food. I have tried quite a number of dishes on their menu and I haven't ever really been disappointed. I have to make sure I keep them in my rotation more often now that I'm reminded. YUM."

Thank goodness I found this place.  I ordered the roast duck, Chinese broccoli, mandarin style pork chops, and salt & pepper shrimp.  The salt & pepper shrimp was awesome.  Probably one of the best shrimp dishes I've had.  The rest was ok.  It wasn't nearly as good as the Asian cuisine found back in Cali, but the best in Vegas so far.  I will gladly drive the half hour to eat there.  I took off one star because of the price.Thanks yelpers for this find.  :)"

From glowing reviews, I was stoked about a great seafood meal, perhaps like I had while living in China for 10 years.  Pity.  No such luck.  The char su (bbq pork) was lean, alright, but chewy like jerky.  And cold.  Noodles were served immediately, when any self-respecting Chinese restaurant owner knows that the \"pasta is served at the end!\"  At least along side the steamed fish.  Pacing is critical in a good Chinese restaurant with courses arriving at appropriate intervals.  The 'highly recommended' shrimp dish was laden with red sauce.  Very Midwestern and sweet - with all due respect to my Midwestern friends, whose steak and pizza I adore.  In a word, \"Fake\".  And not cheap!  It may be worth a second try, but I may venture to other places along Spring Mountain to find a great kitchen.  Not the best way to begin the Year of the Rabbit.  Now that's a dish served well and spicy in Beijing."

I'm originally from LA and we have a lot of amazing ramen places, but this beats them all. Seriously. Shinsengumi? Foo Foo Tei? Not as good as Joyful. This actually tastes like ramen from Japan (except their weird tomato flavored one). They only have about 3 flavors and it runs on the salty side (like ramen from Japan).

This is the reason why the egg drop soup with minced chicken didn't suck. Unlike Most restaurants which tend to abuse their chicken (Capitol Seafood), Joyful did chicken right like your gams gams making homemade chicken soup. But not everybody is your gam gams, and most tend to abuse their chicken because chicken is so lean it leads to dry bland chicken bits that you will choke on (I just wanted to put \"choke\" and \"chicken\" in the same sentence).\n\nThe spicy and probably sour shrimp was decent, but not stellar although they did do a stand-up job on prepping those on-yerns (onions) which was sliced thinly - most Chinese restaurants will just quarter the onions.... slackers!\n\nAlso ordered the tau miu which was your standard garlic pea shoot vegetable dish. Nothing like your leafy green vegetables to keep you \"regular\"... this might be good for you, if you're one of those people that disappear for an hour or so with a magazine under your arm. FYI - I'm in'n'out in record time... the secret is \"leafy greens\".\n\nThe last dish was some beef dish with a generic indistinctive flavor. That's why I'll generically just say it was \"decent\".\n\nThe reason why I tried this place out, is because I can't stand getting screwed with all the high priced, hyped up crap on the strip. Instead, I like my \"crap\" off the strip.... speaking of crap, those leafy greens I had earlier is working their magic."

We are seated and start looking through the menu. \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty big. It has a lively atmosphere with 1 flatscreen TV. They have a decent selection of beer which was cool. We end up ordering the basics wich were Honey Walnut Prawns, Pan Fried Noodles with beef, and fried rice. Huge portions which was prefect since I was starving.\n\nEveything tasted great. No complaints from us whatsoever. No we were not drunk, so our taste buds were definitely not decieving us. The walnut prawns were addicting, and had to have a fork fight with the wife to grab the last one. She won.\n\nOur waiter was great the entire time.

You have 2 options: 1) Choose to have the wedding at an Asian restaurant, where you are limited with the restaurant capacity and limited floor space for dancing or 2) Find a restaurant to cater the Asian food in the venue of your choice.  \n\nI selected option 2.  I went to several Asian restaurants to see if they had the capacity to perform the duties.  Most of the Asian restaurants in Las Vegas were very poor on communication and none of them would return my phone calls even after constant reminders of having their restaurant provide me a quote list of the dinner items and an agenda on how they will be able to perform the function.  All of them failed miserably on the capacity test except for Joyful House.  Joyful House was the ONLY restaurant that had the means to cater in the food.   \n\n\nThey have 2 very helpful managers willing to provide constant communication to make sure your Asian catering and wedding event is a success.  High 5's to both Dell and Stanley.  They are truly amazing and made my wedding planning so easy.  \n\nHere is why:\n\n1) They are extremely good at constant communication.  I am ABC, so they speak good English.\n2) Planning - I would give them a 100 out of 10 in terms of their planning skills.  Chef Yau, Dell and Stanley went to Havana Room at the Tropicana Hotel and met with the Director of Catering.  They laid out the entire inventory items of plates, forks, dinner platters, etc.  They make things look so smooth, yet there were so many complexities in performing the catering job.  Joyful House brought in all the raw materials, tea cups, tea pots, soy sauce, etc. and cooked everything fresh in Tropicana's kitchen.  \n3)Food Quality - I would give them a 100 out of 10.  We had a lot of Asian food connoisseur's in our guest list and I got nothing but raving reviews.  There is a reason why CNN ranked Joyful House as Top 50!  Their specialty is Honey Walnut Shrimp.  My guests were extremely happy about all of the food quality.  Joyful House delivered above and beyond on their quality of food.  The food was so darn good that my guests kept asking for more food than what I originally ordered.  \n\nI can't thank Joyful House for doing such an amazing job!  Thank you again!"

HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT DISH.  \n\nGeneral Chow Chicken for $10.95.  Lots of flavor, great batter, included carrots and peas.  The sauce was a little too salty for me but if you like oyster, soy and other sauces combined, get this dish.\n\nCrispy Fried Lemon Chicken for $10.95.

We kept asking the server the price and it sounds like she was saying $6.95 and we kept asking her, however it turned out to be $16.95 and threw us for a loop when the check came.  I did like how they brought out the live crab in a bucket before cooking it.  It was juicy, crispy and perfectly flavored.   \n\nThe place has a lot of stuff going on.  To me, the typical Chinese restaurant, full of Chiness decor and statues.  Round tables, only thing missing is a lazy Susan LOL.  They even ask if you want an ocean view seat, which is in front of a big fish tank.  The staff is on it.  They always refilled our drinks when the glass was 75% full.

That's why I went there.\n\n2) They serve sweet Americanized Chinese, sort of a blend of Mandarin and Cantonese styles. The Kung Pao Chicken is a complete joke if you've ever had the real thing, closer to the typical sweet-and-not-very-sour dishes you can find at every bad Mandarin joint in America.\n\n3) They serve the dark, soy-colored fried rice that has generally fallen out of popularity in recent times.\n\n4) The ingredients are fresh; Beef with Broccoli was acceptable. It may be possible to assemble a 3-4 star meal if you can stay away from dishes with sweet glazes.\n\n5) It's a clean, modern place with table cloths and decent furniture. You don't feel threatened by disease when there.\n\n5) There are so many better Chinese restaurants in Vegas that there is just no need for this place...except when it's REALLY late."

            "review": "I came here the other night because we needed a good Chinese fix while in Vegas. Let me just say, this is one of the best Chinese seafood restaurants I've tried so far, and I've tried a lot!\n\nI love that the tables are wide apart and not squished together. There's plenty of space to walk in and you don't have to suck yourself in to move in between seats. The decoration is not shabby, but not good. The place is very clean though. \n\nI ordered the Sizzling Rice Soup, Tofu and Eggplant stuffed with Shrimp Paste, Fried Tofu with S/P, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Half a Chicken W/ Ginger Sauce.\n\nThe Sizzling Rice Soup tasted of MSG, but I haven't tasted one seafood restaurant that doesn't make it taste like MSG. But the sizzling rice was greeeat, and the seafood was very, very fresh. The Tofu and Eggplant stuffed with shrimp paste was deliciouuus. I eat this all the time and this is one of the best places I have ever tasted it at. The stuffing is great, it's packed with flavor and the eggplant and tofu were soft but not falling apart. The Honey Walnut Shrimp.. Mmmm, delicious. My favorite dish there. I love that they don't go heavy on the mayonnaise and they keep the dish light and flavorful. The shrimp is super crunchy, unlike many places. The chicken was great. It was a little bit dry but I loved the flavor they got into the chicken, and that was without the ginger sauce! The Fried Tofu was good too! The skin was very thin but super crunchy and the whole tofu kind of just melts in your mouth. Although this isn't a dish, I just have to compliment it.. We asked for fresh chili and they give us chili, with soy sauce, and fried garlic. I don't know what else they put in it, but it was delicious.. Wow, so great! \n\nService was quick, everything was brought to us in a blink of an eye! Loved that. They were friendly and informative. \n\nPrices are very steep here though, especially when you compare it to the portion of the dish. But the quality of the food here is superb, at least when I came. Everything was tender, fresh, juicy and delicious! I will definitely come back and try the Peking Duck."

My friends & I just finished our epic spartan race and idk why but my cravings for Panda Express Orange Chicken were going on overboost. However, my friends all said that the Panda Express on the strip (the only one open that late) wasn't as good as back in OC. I ain't about to waste my calories on crappy chinese food so luckily one of my friends that live in Vegas recommended Joyful House.\n\nI was surprised walking in that there were still families eating so late, so place must be good. The workers here speak english, but if you want any modifications you better know your chinese. Thank god they spoke cantonese so I busted my chinese speakin skills on them lol\n\nWonton soup - Started off w/ this, I liked that it was just the soup w/ veggies, wontons, and bbq pork. NO NOODLES YAY! It was a very big portion, but flavor was on point and no salty MSG. In fact, their soup was actually on the lighter side and not greasy. The BBQ Pork was lean and surprisingly one of the best I've had.\n\nHoney Walnut Shrimp - Busted my chinese to ask for mayo on the side and thank god I did! I recommend you try asking for the sauce on the side also, it makes a big difference. The shrimp was all nice and crispy, not leaking out oil at all from the batter. I think that if the sauce was on it, it'd make the shrimp soggy. Very good dish and they didn't skimp on the shrimp either! We still had half the plate left to take home. The shrimp were a good medium size, not overly coated in batter\n\nCrispy Orange Chicken - I wished it were a bit more crispy, didn't really satisfy my Panda Express cravings, but can't complain. The sauce wasn't the same as Panda either, but more like a traditional Orange Chicken flavor you'd get at asian restaurants like Sam Woo. It tastes great w/ the steamed white rice. I would say skip this and try another entree, it's not a TDF item\n\nYang Chow Fried Rice - Fried rice w/ BBQ pork & Shrimp! You can get it chinese style which is Plain, Soy Sauce Free - Pan fried with Eggs and Shredded Cabbage, or American Style which has soy sauce. The fried rice was pretty good and again the BBQ pork was delicious! Really big portion, we had to take the rest home. Unlike most chinese restaurants, they didn't skimp on the bbq pork and shrimp! It wasn't too greasy either so brownie points for that\n\nThey give you sweet and refreshing orange slices at the end of your meal which helped the hefty meal go down! Our total bill came out to be about $50 w/ tax which isn't bad. It's a great place for value, you get a lot for what you pay! Hits the midnight munchies in Vegas and the food tasted pretty authentic :)"

I had the General Tso's a.k.a Cho  Chicken. It was a portion for 2 but it made dinner for the next night easy. They could have eased up on the sauce a tiny bit (it was caked in it). The Won Soup was awesome. Overall, I will definitely eat here again but I will be trying something else to expand my horizons. BTW this place has a MASSIVE seafood menu for all you seafood eaters."

The outside looks pretty much the same as it has been, a small looking building with nothing too flashy to invite you in...but we did notice a banner saying it was renovated...so we decided to check it out with the family for my post bday celebration. As most Las Vegas joints especially in China Town, this place does close late past midnight...2am I believe. This makes it convinent for those late night munchies, hangovers or out of town peeps looking for something to eat at almost any given time. Definitely wasn't disappointed after a long absence. Food comes out fast...and full of flavor. The Roast Duck is amazing ... one of the most flavorful moist Roast duck with crispy skin I have ever tasted...in Vegas anyways! It wasn't drowned in sauce and just perfect. The restrooms are clean, and the inside looks pretty contemporary yet keeping food traditional. They did get Las Vegas Review Journals BEST of Las Vegas award in 2014 so that should mean something. Definitely a place to try and check out once or more than you would expect."

It had been ages since my last visit (I think I was 10 years old or so) ,so I couldn't exactly remember what the food tasted like, but at the moment I was up for anything in the Chinatown area. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nCream of Chicken and Corn Soup- pretty standard soup. It reminded me of egg flower soup with cream of corn. I don't know if I'd order this again because it wasn't anything special. I think I'd prefer won ton soup over this. \n\n\nBeef & Broccoli- I was a little skeptical about ordering this dish because I always try to order things that you can't get at other places. This dish you can order anywhere and I was sort of sick of it from places like Panda. However, that is only due to the fact that I forgot how much better it tastes at authentic Chinese restaurants. Beef was chewy and tender, while the stems of the broccoli was soft. The sauce was typical and there was a perfect amount to moisten the dish up and I'm tough critic when it comes to dryness. I couldn't believe at how much the dish amazed me as if it was my first time trying it. \n\nHoney Walnut Shrimp- one of my all time favorites at any Chinese restaurants. Joyful House will not disappoint because theirs definitely meets the standards. The batter of the shrimp was the perfect thickness, good ratio of shrimp to walnut and the mayonnaise glazed the entire dish perfectly. Loved this! \n\nSteamed Flounder- just as good as it is anywhere else. My dad also cooks this at home and now I honestly don't find this dish as amusing as I did before. But I'm sure for everyone else they still love it. The fish is very light that is balanced with the soy sauce and oil. The chopped scallions also adds a nice touch, almost like sprinkles on a sundae. On another note, the fish came with all the bones intact and the server meticulously de boned the entire fish at the table. I was truly impressed because the fish still held up it's shape and it wasn't distorted into pieces (if that was my job, it would have been another story). My best friend and I both chatted about how it was our first time experiencing such an art. Apparently all Chinese restaurants are suppose to do this. \n\nThank you Joyful House! I was so caught up with the hype of other Asian cuisines from sushi to banh mis that I had forgotten the Chinese were the first to make a good impression on Americans. No wonder, your food is absolutely delicious and will always be considered the Asian classic. You may now be my Chinese restaurant fix when I'm in the Chinatown area."

            "review": "Got to try this place finally for the first time. Heard good things abut them so coming here was a no brainer.\n\nI gotta give them props for their menu. It looks like they put a lot of thought and detail into it. For example, if you were craving a certain item like soup, bam! All the soups they have are all in one section. This applies to all others like noodles, seafood, etc. We ordered Salt n Pepper Calamari, Salt n Pepper Porkchops, and Honey Walnut Shrimp. \n\nThe Honey Walnut Shrimp was decent, but to me it seemed to lack a bit of sauce to it. When we got the plate, it already looked like somebody ate some shrimp off of it. If you refer to my picture, you can see that they don't give you much shrimp to begin with. The best Honey Walnut Shrimp I ever had was at Panda Inn in the city of La Palma, Ca. \n\nBoth the Salt n Pepper Porkchops and Salt n Pepper Calamari was very good. The only thing lacking I thought was some kind of sauce to dip it in. There was soy sauce on the table but that will only add to the saltiness of the two entrees. I was thinking sweet n sour sauce would be perfect to dip it in. \n\nService was very good. They took our order and processed it right away. We got our food in no time. Refills were constant and im glad because of the salt content we ordered which was good with the steamed rice we ate it with.\n\nThe main negative thing that stood out for me was the prices. With all the three items we ordered plus tax it came out to 41 dollars and that's without any drinks (we had water which was good because it was filtered and not tap water). I thought the food was good but 15 bucks a pop for the Honey Walnut Shrimp and the Salt n Pepper Porkchops is bit much. Even the appetizer Salt n Pepper Calamari was 8.99. \n\nAll in all I thought it was an ok experience based off of the negatives and positives that balanced each other out. All I know is be prepared to spend a lot of money if you are paying for a party of 4 or more.\n\nP.S. They don't give out fortune cookies when you get your check and its a 20 dollar minimum to use debit/credit."

Despite being \"only kinda hungry\" my group of four proceeded to order a 6lb deep fried lobster, XO beans, ong choy, soup, and steamed fish.  \n\nThis is one of the best lobsters I've ever had.  Lightly dusted in cornstarch, salt, pepper, and crack(?), then quickly fried to perfection keeping the meat moist and succulent.  The pictures speak for themselves.  Plus they were having a 50% off special on lobster, so our titanic crustacean only cost us $100. \n\nThe only disappointment was the fish, not because it wasn't good, but because we had no idea it cost $59/lb!  That 1.5lb cost us as much as the lobster and wasn't worth it.  Next time we'll be sure to ask how much the fish costs before we order.  \n\nOther than that, a perfect meal."

My girlfriend and I decided to order the dinner combos, which turned out to feed an army. I am not kidding. From the start, we had three appetizers-wontons, eggrolls, and potstickers. Next, we barely scratched the surface of a gallon sized bowl of sweet and sour soup. Our entrees arrived, accompanied by a heaping bowl of white rice.

There was 7 of us and we had to keep trying to find our server to get more tea, not once did our server ask how anything was. I arrived after my mom and sister (we were coming from church and got stuck at a traffic signal that was out),when I did get there the server NEVER ONCE asked me if I needed or wanted anything. I guess that she just assumed that my kids and I were alright with what very little food was left from what my mom, sister and nieces were picking at. It wasn't at all busy, they didn't appear short staffed, just sheer negligence. \nThe icing on the cake was being on the phone with a friend this morning and her asking me what I did for mother's day and her responding that the last her and get husband were there they had awful service too. It was just the two of them and it wasn't busy then either so it couldn't be attributed to the size of their party, just bad service all around. My friend said her and her husband will never be going back, my mother said the same yesterday and I have to say I agree with both of them. Such a shame too because their menu choices are vast and the food wasn't bad."

It's hard to find those in a Chinese restaurant. \n\nMy favorite is the Mongolian beef. The meat is very, very tender. The plate is colorful. It looks like it came out of a Samsung TV. I usually like my Mongolian beef spicier, but theirs has lots of flavor so it's fine. The portions are just right too, for the price. Their rice is always free so you have to take that into account if you think they're too expensive. Then there's the lemon chicken. It's very crunchy, and the sauce is not as tiring. It's not made up of mushed up meat so it's real chicken. \n\nI can't say everything in their menu is great, but they always get my favorites on point. You really have to come here for those specific dish they get right. Overall the experience I get is always awesome here. They're open late. Love that."

I searched Chinese food in my Yelp app and Joyful House came up first on the results. The reviews had me sold, so we jumped in the car and drove across town for a midnight snack. \n\nThe parking lot was a little dark, but it was expected since it was so late and everything else in that little shopping center was closed. The restaurant had about two tables filled, now three once we all sat down. Must be a good place if there are people here eating Chinese food instead of on the strip at midnight. We ordered soft noodles, salt and pepper pork, minced beef with tofu and sizzling beef (came on a hot plate). All of the food arrived at the table family style and freshly made-- just what I was craving for! It was delicious and I would definitely come back again. I especially like how late the Joyful House stays open and how accommodating the service was. Our drinks were never empty and our server brought more rice the moment I scarfed it all down. We definitely felt welcomed, even when it was probably past our server's bed time (and mine, too!) \n\nI definitely recommend this place to anyone who might be visiting Las Vegas and craves some authentic Chinese food-- not that greasy chow mein from a fast food chain or the 'meh' broccoli and beef from a tray at a casino buffet. Joyful House does Chinese food right and I will definitely be back for more."

The clams and vermicelli was way too salty, and there were hardly any vermicelli noodles in it. I appreciate there being a good amount of clams, but unfortunately the sauce was more like a soup.

I also remember that it was quite good, although I again cannot remember at all what I had.  I'm sure they were fairly typical dishes such as mushu or kung pao or something.  Recalling that they were good and being in the mood for Chinese, we made our way here for lunch.\n\nFirst of all, no lunch menu on weekends.  We got the menu of dozen pages or so that were just normal dinner dishes - fairly expensive dishes.  Fortunately we were not looking for a lunch menu and wanted the full gamut so it didn't faze us any, but be prepared that it will not be a cheap lunch.  The menu you do get is upscale in both the menu itself and the contents with right balances of seafood and non-seafood.  \n\nI was craving some Chinese seafood so we ordered the Seafood Wor Wonton Soup ($10), marinated spicy clams ($14), and sweet & sour crispy rock cod fish ($14).  The soup had plenty of fat wontons and ample amount of seafood, and with the large size it's well worth the price.  Spicy clams were in deep red, spicy sauce, with a hint of mala tingliness.  Loved it.  The sweet & sour was not too sweet, not too sour, with perfectly fried fish that was as tender as can be.  As good as the first two were, this was even better.  With enough unusual items on the menu, this may very well be our go-to Chinese.\n\nOur meal came to $50 after all was said and done, but it was the best Chinese we've had in a long, long time.  Service was more pleasant than the typical Chinese restaurants, although it's all relative.  Food came fast, restaurant is clean, and traffic was brisk.  I'm torn between 4 & 5-stars, but let's leave it at 4 until I revisit.  It's really 4.5 stars.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  Despite the large table-centric set up, I think the atmosphere might actually work for 1.  Maybe."

My husbands chicken dish was off the chain, the mushrooms were in big chunks so you REALLY got a good taste of them, the chicken was tender and flavorful and the pepper sauce was perfect. I expected the pepper sauce to be too spicy (I don't handle spice very well) but it was great! It had a good pepper flavor, but it wasn't over powering or too spicy. A freaking epic dish.

It did come with a side of white rice.\n\nHowever, the fried rice and beef chow fun were great values!  Both came out, and my wife and I realized we would have tons of left overs for the next day or two.  The beef chow fun was super yum.  Fried rice was fried rice, not bad.\n\nFor late-night chinese craving, definitely the place to go.  They have a extensive menu and even cool whole lobsters.   I will have to try that the next time I go here."

So what is this?\" he stupidly continues.\n\n\"Um, sea cucumber with abalone\"; again straight faced.\n\n\"What?!?\" With great exasperation in his voice.\n\n\"And this is Santa Barbra Spot Prawns with their egg clutch, deep fried crab with fermented black beans, steamed live fish with ginger onion, and the soup was made from tiger shark fin\".\n\n\"I think I'm going to be sick\" is all he can say.  Sorry I can't help but to explode in laughter.\n\nJoyful House is a Cantonese seafood restaurant for the initiated.  I'm not sure if I should even write this review.  It's one of those places that long time Asian Vegas locals cherish.  Yes its won the \"Best of Vegas\" from the Review Journal but that barely speaks to it's hidden greatness.\n\nSo maybe they need to get to know you before they reveal their secrets, persist.  For example, you MUST ask for their spot prawns with the eggs.  Yes, they are now $12 each but they are worth every penny.  Eggs exploding in your mouth with the essence of fresh shrimp.\n\nThe spicy jellyfish was excellent.  Clean oceanic flavor accented by sesame and chili oil, and a touch of soy.  The sea cucumber with abalone, a tender sweet explosion of sea flavor.\n\nDon't hate me but this is one of the few places that still uses real shark fin.  While I deplore fining and think it's inhumane, I couldn't resist.  It's been 12 years since I had the real thing.  Add a jigger of Remy XO, perfect.\n\nThis is not your typical Cantonese restaurant.  Yes, if you choose, they make great Americanized favorites (beef broccoli. shrimp fried rice, \"Peeking duck\", lemon chicken, shrimp with honey walnuts) but ultimately only those in the know will experience it's greatness.\n\nShhhhh.  Not for everyone."

We ordered a shit ton of food for only 4 of us so Ill just laundry list each item with a few thoughts. \n\nWonton Soup (Cantonese style).. kind of blah and bland. I'd opt for the hot and sour instead which was exactly as its named. Perfect. \n\nRosy Duck, crisp, duck fatty.. Came with plum sauce which tasted like industrial cleaner.\n\nSalt and Pepper Pork Chop, bone-in thin pork chops deep friend and covered with fried garlic and chilies. This was a hit!\n\nBoiled Chicken with Chives, pretty bland and the garlic ginger sauce was too oily masking most of the flavor.\n\nCombination Pan Fried Noodles, generously covered with shrimp, beef and chicken the dish over all was super goopey and not very appetizing. Opt for Lo Mein next time.\n\nBeef Chow Fun with black bean sauce was good. The beef was silky and tender while the noodles chewy and oily. This was another hit!\n\nService was pretty amazing (fast, efficient), well priced and portion sizes were huge. They also have a humongous menu plus fresh seafood on premises.

The cold combination plate had some hot items which was a bit odd but everything was delicious. Jelly fish strips were flavorful, the duck was not as juicy as I would like, but I was happy. Ham was yummy and the braised beef slices were ok.  \n\nThen we had some stir fried greens (well cooked but pretty expected), the seafood claypot had a lot of seafood (shrimp, scallops, squid, etc), fish sauce eggplant clay pot had a lot of sauce that went well with rice. Beef chow fun was quite good and I don't normally like that stuff. the pepper and salt pork chops was good but had a lot breading. but i loved it regardless. we got another tofu dish with mushroom.. it was nice and light (be careful though - it burned the roof of my mouth).  Last dish we had was some kind of beef in sweet sauce which i didn't try.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, they brought us slices of watermelon and one in the group spoke cantonese so she got us an overflowing plate of watermelon --- on the house!  They even told her that if we ran out, we can ask for more. :)  yayyy for free watermelon. \n\nWe were quite loud/excited after being starved for a week from camping and road tripping in the wilderness, but they were completely fine and service was good."

It was dry and probably been precooked in the kitchen for a while, have had canned versions that were immensely better than this.\n- The salt and pepper pork chop was even worse, the meat itself was flavorless and they didn't even bother to properly spread the seasoning, ending up with a couple pieces over seasoned  and the rest tasteless.\n- The eggplant and tofu dish was the only good dish. I am a sucker for crispy outside and silky smooth inside tofu. Eggplant was fried very well, reminds me of what you would get in a fresh dim sum restaurant.\n- Pineapple pork was not edible, it was mostly breading and soggy sweet and sour pork.\n- Sizzling beef with shacha sauce was ok, beef was done well, soft and tender, flavoring was a bit off."

Man we got jipped hard, I probably would recommend putting that money into a different dish.\nClams in vermicelli special broth: clams were good but the broth wasn't that special, it was sort of bland, but it was different than the usual ways people order clams at Chinese restaurants.\nSteamed Egg plant with garlic sauce: Wasn't really garlic sauce, more like just sauteed egg plants with crushed garlic sprinkled on top, so technically, it needed some sauce.\nYang Chow Fried Rice: decent, no real complaints from this, probably need some more salt.\nPan Fried Chinese Broccoli: probably our only real healthy dish, it was good, nothing memorable from it, but we did finish it.\n\nOverall, this restaurant is a decent Chinese joint."

It is a dish that can be eaten as a soup but were not given smaller soup bowls or soup spoons. The waitress seemed irritated when we asked for the bowls and spoons. We also ordered the seafood special Hong Kong noodle dish. The noodles are supposed to be fried crispy and the sauce and seafood poured over the crispy noodles. Our noodles were only crispy along the very edge of the dish. The rest were soft and not what Hong Kong noodles are supposed to be. We asked for chopsticks for the noodles. Again the waitress seemed irritated when asked for chopsticks. The table setting was one napkin and one fork. If you want chopsticks you had to ask. Service was very poor, slow, and unfriendly.

If you know how to make a traditional Chinese steam fish, you know it is important to have good quality of fish, have to be fresh, and also the timing to steam the fish has to be just right, not too long or too short. We also have the coral shrimp, those shrimps are fresh and  tastes sweet. We also tried the lobster as well - I mean those over 4 lbs lobster. The lobster meat is fresh and tastes very good, can't get it from somewhere else. \n\nAnother dish that we ordered is black bean sauce clams, it is amazingly good. They are juicy, tender and \"big\" as a clam. I never taste such a clam before. As Chinese, we got to order a dish of vegetable - garlic baby bean sprout (the leafy ones.)\n\nAs far as the space, as other described, they are spacious and sit comfortably for a big group.

My favorite aspect, though, it that they are open until 3am! Perfect for a late night dinner date in Chinatown. I noted that they had a bar so you can order a cocktail, but I also noted they have a limited beer and wine selection. They serve Coke products and hot tea is complimentary. They have combination dinners available for 2 or more diners, but for the most part meals are served family style (which is my personal preference for Chinese restaurants anyway). They can accomodate tables of 2 or tables of 10 quite easily and our server was very nice.\n\nWe will definitely be visiting Joyful House again.

The flavor was there, just not my favorite way to eat eggplant.\n\nThey are open very late, 3am every night, so this will really hit the spot for late night cravings!"

We especially liked the crispy fried pork chops, so crispy and tasty (they were not soggy at all as a previous reviewer mentioned). I agree that the portion size is on the smaller side, not like what you normally receive at your usual chinese restaurant, no leftovers to take home :P I always ask if they have snow pea leaves when I'm in a chinese restaurant (it's never on the menu, you have to ask), and Joyful had it - yum!! The honey walnut shrimp was good, but not the best I've ever had (a bit disappointed because of all the raves on yelp, maybe they've never had it before lol).\n\nFor parents: they have both high chairs and booster seats. Our waitress misunderstood us and would not get us one when we requested it. We found out at the end of the evening when the host noticed and apologized sincerely."

Joyful House the best we have found yet.  It is not delivery, but the takeout service was quick and attentive.\n\nAppetizers - the Crab Rangoon and Potstickers were good.  The Crispy Fried Prawns were a bit thick on the breading, but the prawns themselves were flavorful.\n\nMain dishes - The Beef Tenderloin Mignon With Onion really was filet mignon, so far as I could tell.  Very tender and flavorful, and they didn't skimp on the beef.  The Sweet and Sour Pork was also flavorful, with only a hint of toughness; and the sauce did not drown out the flavor of the pork.  The soft Pan Fried Noodles With Chicken was also well-prepared, with small but tender chunks of chicken breast.\n\nThe prices were a little more than what we are used to, which is odd because coming from Los Angeles almost everything is much cheaper in Las Vegas.  While we have not quite given up on trying some other places, we would be entirely satisfied to stick with Joyful House as our \"go to\" Chinese food in Las Vegas."

It also earned Best Chinese Restaurant by the Las Vegas Review Journal in 2014. Live seafood in the tanks look healthy and vibrant. The wine list is extensive from house wine to Ch\u00e2teau Lafite.  \n\nSea Food Wor Won Ton Soup (***  ) \n\nIt is really hard for A Chinese Restaurant to mess this dish up and JH was no exception. While it was above average, it was not exceptional, There was Broccoli in this dish that was cooked just right.   \n\nImperial Peking Duck (*****)\n\nWhile the duck was prepared to perfection, this dish got five stars because of what they do with the carcass afterwards: the meat is stripped from the bones and minced then fried in a wok where it takes on a smoky savory flavor, the minced meat looked like it had some scallions in it and was served on lettuce leaves.\n\nBraised Tofu with Salted Fish & Minced Chicken (*****)\n\nSimple yet flavorful soft chunks of tofu with chicken and salted fish. The salted fish is slightly fermented lending an interesting flavor: the flavor was well balanced tho and the fish did not overwhelm the dish as it sometimes can.\n\nLive King Crab (*****)\n\nWe had an 8 pound crab (don't know if it was the Alaskan or Australian but it was $69/lb) served two ways: the body (base of the legs) were served with Ginger Scallions and the Carapace and legs were sauteed with butter and garlic. The Ginger Scallions were cooked to perfection and well balanced. The garlic legs had fresh finely diced garlic piled on expertly halved leg sections: I found that the garlic was pretty strong for my taste but simply removing the garlic with a flick of my chopsticks solved that. The presentation was amazing but the portions were cut in such a way that the meat was easy to separate from the shell: well done! \n\nLive Main Lobster (*****)\n\nGinger Scallions topped off this monster 7lb lobster and it was cooked to perfection (not over cooked and tender) and well balanced. The presentation was not as good as the crab but this is splitting hairs: so I still gave it 5 stars.\n\nChinese Broccoli in Oyster Sauce (***  ) \n\nLike the Wor Won Ton Soup, this dish is hard to do badly. Some places might over cook it but not here; it still maintained some crunch while being tender. Perfect!\n\nManila Clams - Ginger & Scallions (**** )\n\nFresh (maybe live it was so delicate) clams cooked just right. Not a stand out for me, but then again, I don't normally eat clams: the reason I gave it 4 stars was because the freshness of the clams was exceptional and delicate. \n\nTaro Tapioca Soup (*****)\n\nThis hidden gem is not on the menu but served as a complimentary desert. small squares of White Taro rest on the bottom while Tapioca floats playfully on top of this milky warm desert soup. would have given it a six if I could!\n\nTHE SERVICE:\n\nThe Staff (****)\n\nWell groomed and friendly; we were greeted and sat immediately. Not your usual Chinese Food wait staff: well spoken and attentive; beverage refills came quickly with out asking. Dishes were cleared and replaced with clean ones the moment they became cluttered with shells. Soup and wine were expertly served.\n\nThe Layout (**** )\n\nThe exterior was acceptable but not spotless (hey: this is Chinatown right!?), Live seafood tanks were clean and the animals were healthy and not showing any signs of stress. Tables were well set with clean table cloths and no grime/oil/leftovers on the settings. I knocked off a star for the restrooms (I know that it is bad luck to have a spotless restroom: but I hope a Chinese restaurant will break that tradition one day). Parking was scarce even tho the restaurant was half full (we parked in back)."

It ranges from roasted duck, fried shrimp, pork, and veggies that you can pick from. It comes with an egg roll and another fried app, looking like a samosa. It also comes with a free drink all for $10!\n\nThat being said I probably won't be returning for 2 reasons. 1) food 2) service\n\nThe food I ordered was the salt n pepper fried shrimp lunch special and a salt n pepper fried pork a la carte. The shrimp was good 4/5 nothing spectacular but could order again. The fried pork was terrible. The flavor was there, however 3/4 of the pieces was just fried fat. Barley any meat in any of the pieces 1/5. The egg roll wasn't great 1/5. Samosa was pretty good 4/5. There was also a corn soup and I was super hyped! I love Asian corn soup, unfortunately it was luke warm and too gooey I believe there was too much corn starch added in it.\n\nService. I sat down and the waiter was friendly (probably the only good part of service). I had to ask for the lunch special menu, maybe because I came late they didn't have it on the table. Then I went to order and looked around the room my waiter was busy and there was a waitress available. We made eye contact then went on her phone... I also had to ask from some condiments, like vinegar. It goes great with fried foods!  My waiter pretty much never checked on me until I asked. I had to ask him to come over 4 times. 1 for lunch special 2 to order 3 to get vinegar 4 for the check.\n\nIf you're in China town there's plenty other spots to check out"

I rarely am able to find this dish anywhere else but it is just so amazing.  Oysters steamed with black bean sauce and globs of garlic on top...How could that ever not be good?\n\nOther stuff I've had that were really good are: Sizzling Scallops with Black Bean Sauce and Steamed Live Rock Cod (at $80 it was a little pricey but it was divine).  Most of other items I've had were decent.\n\nThe only thing I've had here that was bad was the dessert.  I ordered the ice cream mochi and the mochi skin was dried up and not chewy, probably due the packaging not being sealed properly.  I might've been able to send it back but I didn't ask.  The fried ice cream wasn't good either.\n\nOh, and this place is open til 3am!  Ideal for blowing some money on seafood after a night of fruitful gambling (or eating your sorrows away if you lose)."

With the first bite you can tell that they use high quality ingredients and they don't skimp on the meat at all.\n\nOkay, so maybe we're more fans of the xiao lung bao.

The clams in black bean sauce wasn't that good, the sauce was super salty (we ordered it after reading all the rave reviews on it).  The sesame chicken was good, it's our safe go to dish whenever we eat Chinese food.  Our bill came out to $47.24 including a HongKong iced tea that was never refilled, a little disappointing since it cost $3.75.  Perhaps I'm just cheap but I'm used to paying $2.50~ for iced tea w/ unlimited refills.  Another disappointment was the cleanliness, lots of dust on the wood window sills along the restaurant.

A caveat, we knew from previous reviews that this would be more \"Americanized\" Chinese than Yunnan Garden, where we ate an awesome meal last night.  But because we were bringing two non-Chinese friends with us, this was more in line with what they considered \"adventurous\" dining.  Our suspicions were confirmed when no chopsticks were present on the table or being used at any of the adjacent tables.   \n\nWe ordered the salt and pepper scallops, steamed flounder, Mongolian beef, green beans with minced pork, and snow pea leaf with garlic.  The salt and pepper scallops were pretty good, with a reasonably crisply breading and very hot jalapenos topping them.  One of the two specials was the steamed flounder, and it was very well presented.  However, the fish was unevenly cooked with the lowest half inch of the fish under cooked to the point of still being somewhat gelatinous.  The Mongolian beef was salty and drowning in a gravy-like dark sauce.  The green beans were crisp with a decent amount of minced pork and snow pea leaf with garlic was cooked just right.  The veggies were definitely the best of the bunch. \n\nOur first waiter was initially very helpful and filled our drink and food orders accurately.  After that, he checked on us twice to refill beers and sodas, and that was it.  The staff was mostly absent for the second half of our meal.   We had to try several times before finally flagging another waiter to get takeout containers and the check.\n\nUnless we have other friends who have very conservative palates, we won't be going back.

We started out with bowls of West Lake Egg Flower Chowder, which I thought was somewhat bland. Adding a small amount of chili paste and a splash of shoyu (soy sauce) helped.\n\nThey ordered steamed chicken with ginger and mustard greens with mushrooms, but didn't seem to eat much of the greens. My wife and I tried the Pan Fried Spinach with Garlic, Barbecued Pork Fried Rice and Chicken Chow Fun. The latter actually wasn't much fun, as the noodles turned out to be really thick and hard to handle. We should have ordered the skinny noodles instead. I thought the fried rice was very good. \n\nServing sizes here are huge, so we had the leftovers boxed up and we found a couple of homeless guys down the street who really appreciated them.\n\nWe could have ordered a bit less and still fed one homeless person, but we got out the door for $95 (including tip) and thought it was quite a bit better than the typical Chinese place."

I had been looking for a great Chinese place in town, and randomly stumbled upon Joyful House.\n\nI had the Half Shell Steamed Oysters with Black Bean sauce, which were absolutely fantastic and fresh. The delivery person arrived there after we had been told they were out of oysters, so these were very very fresh. \n\nI also had the Crispy Fried Tofu stuffed w/ Shrimp Paste. It came with slices of eggplant as well - and the whole thing was delicious. \n\nTo top it all off, we added some chicken fried rice. My expectations with fried rice are pretty basic, and this easily met those. Fried rice is basically fried rice....it's fairly easy for a good Chinese restaurant to not screw this up.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by their extensive wine menu. I didn't happen to order a $1,500+ bottle of Petrus nor Lafite, but it was nice to see that was an option. ;)  For those of us who aren't on CEO incomes, they had plenty to choose from, and I opted for a $9/glass Merlot.\n\nTotal cost for two people - those three dishes and a glass of wine - was about $40. Bottom line: incredible food, friendly service, and a definite place for repeat visits."

Richard C. proclaimed that Joyful House offered such a treat after 10 pm!\n\nLast Friday night, the Husband and I ventured over to Spring Mountain to find out if such a thing really did exist.  We were only expecting Chinese hot pot, not AYCE for the mere price of $15.50/pp.\n\nWe were easily persuaded and a quick peek at what they offered helped as well.\n\nAs they set up the gas stove and dual hot pot, they also provided two dipping sauces - one being a chili oil and the other a sesame-like paste.\n\nEverything was laid out nicely on a couple of tables along the back: \n\n* octopus balls\n* beef balls\n* pork balls\n* wontons\n* dumplings\n* chicken\n* beef\n* pork\n* squid\n* mussels\n* shrimp\n* napa cabbage\n* spinach\n* bok choy\n* tofu\n* tofu sheets\n* flat rice noodles\n* vermicelli noodles\n\nI'm sure they had a few other things that I forgot to mention.  Also in the broth was taro and radish.\n\nFor dessert, they offered complimentary red bean soup and fortune cookies.\n\nService was surprisingly attentive.  It was slow when we arrived shortly after 10 pm, and there were a few diners.  Business picked up with at least two large parties also enjoying the AYCE hot pot.  The staff was good at refilling our water, tea, and asking if we needed more broth in our pot.  They had a lot of staff around, so that was a good thing.\n\nLate night AYCE Chinese hot pot begins at 9 pm! \n\n3.5 stars"

I was with a group so we collectively ordered a whole bunch of stuff but I opted for the Hong Kong style Shrimp plate and the Steamed Tofu with Chinese Greens.  The Hong Kong noodles were perfect and not overly saucy like some of the other places I've tried in Chinatown.  I love the crunchiness of the noodles and the amount of sauce was perfect and kept the outer edges of the noodles crunchy enough to enjoy.  The tofu came out soft, hot, and ready to consume.  Nothing too special going on with the tofu but that's actually how I expected it to be so I was okay with it.  The servers were friendly and checked up on us without being so overbearing about having enough of anything or whether I needed more water after taking 2 sips.\n\nOverall, a great experience!  Will return to grub again soon."

We did not enjoy this dish at all. KJ kitchen's version costs less, gives you more shrimp and gives a ton more walnuts. Or you can go to China Tango Bistro in Summerlin and get a delicious, generous version for only $12! They rip you off here.\n\nTheir rice was super hard and dry - I have no clue how a legitimate Chinese restaurant can mess this up? \n\nAlso, I was shocked they didn't have the real deal homemade authentic sat\u00e9 chili sauce in oil. They brought out the commercial bright red sambal oelek from a bottle which tasted weird and sour, not spicy at all. Very disappointing. \n\nOur 1 dish, rice and a soda was not worth $20, everything was unsatisfactory.\n\n----- to that person who messaged me to move out of Vegas because my honest review insulted him. \n\nI will not! :P you're not the boss of me. but I will sit here and laugh about your idiocy and share it with all of my friends! :)"

I love eating Chinese food, and the one thing that I use to gauge their greatness is honey walnut shrimp, or walnut prawns. This place has the best honey walnut shrimp in Vegas so far, and I base this on the food from home.\n\nWatch how far you drive down Spring Mountain--this place is right off Decatur and Spring Mountain in a little strip. Although the building is a bright color, at night it is still easy to miss. Parking is a bit tight, but it is worth it!\n\nWhen you walk in, the Buddha statue is at the entrance with piles of coins from customers on his belly. I always rub his belly when I walk in. The servers are very attentive--and all male--and there is no wait for a table. The menus are easy to read with the set dinners on the very first page, but if you feel adventurous, I would suggest the more foreign dishes to eat. They are truly authentic, serving black fungus and jellyfish, shark fin soup, among other things. Most Americans would never order these dishes, but trust me--you have to try it.\n\nWe ate the honey walnut shrimp (obviously), black fungus and season vegetables, braised tofu, wonton noodle soup, and jelly fish. It was all oustanding, all in their right sauces and the vegetables with that nice slight char from the breath of the dragon. The tofu was perfect, and the black fungus was cooked just right. I love cold jellyfish, and this was one of the best that I've had in Vegas.\n\nOverall, the meal was outstanding and reminded me of the Joyful restaurant back home on Guam. We waited four minutes for our food, and everything was cooked perfectly, presented beautifully, and tasted spectacular.\n\nWho says that you have to eat on the strip? Save some money and go to the side streets. You never know what gems you may find."

Despite my best intentions, I typically balk at the stuff people actually eat in places like Vietnam and Taiwan. You can understand why I was a little leery of venturing to a Chinese place on Spring Mountain for dinner with my coworkers the other night, especially when it was recommended by the Taiwanese guy! I consulted with him and he assured me that 'americans' like myself would still be able to find something to eat at Joyful House, so we decided to check it out. \n\nThe restaurant is quite large and well-lit, with a bunch of (like 15) tanks for fresh seafood that you can see. It seemed like a pretty legit operation and my coworker was already conversing in mandarin (or something) with the friendly wait staff, so we knew we'd be treated to a wide variety of dishes.\n\nSpeaking of wide variety, everybody ordered a bunch of stuff and then my coworker spoke to the waiter and apparently ordered like 6 more dishes. Everything is family style, so we had waaaayyyy too much food, even for our large group of like 12. Here's a quick run down:\n\nGarlic Baby Bok-Choy - loved it. Not bland like your usual veggie dishes. Highly recommend.\nMandarin pork chop - the favorite of several people at the table. Sweet and breaded, which is my fave.\nSizzling steak - just ok. We were pretty pumped after the sizzling presentation, but it wasn't anything special. Not spicy (despite the warning on the menu).\nClay pot scallops - served with rice noodles and really good.\nSeafood dish - don't know what it was called, but I really liked it. It came with shrimp, crispy noodles, and some other stuff I can't remember. My 2nd fave.\nClay pot eggplant - good not great.\nPork fried rice - standard.\nString beans with pork - good not great.\nAppetizer soup - just the soup they serve to everybody, I guess - beef broth with nothing in it. It was as good as you can make beef broth, but the 1 year old LOVED it, so bonus for that.\nTapioca Dessert Soup - no thank you. If you're into tapioca, you might like it.\nLemon iced tea - really good! Sweetened, but not too sweet. I actually had two glasses, which I usually don't do.\n \nPrices were kinda high - $15-20/meat dish, but everything was good, including the service.\n \nAny time I have somebody in town craving a 'fancier' Chinese meal, we will definitely take them to Joyful House.\n \nBonus points for being open late (til like 3am)!"

We arrived around 5:30 or so and were seated immediately.  Our server came over within 2-3 minutes to ask what we would like to drink and if we wanted water. The drinks and water were returned almost immediately as well as a hot pot of delicious tea. Our waiter was very helpful in choosing our dishes. However, the portions are way too large to be shared by just two people and should be considered food for four, especially is you plan on trying several dishes. We started with pot stickers and they were simply outstanding. We did not realize the dinner was served with a large bowl of steamed rice and ordered combination fried rice, which was excellent, but not necessary. Based on another review we tried the Walnut Prawns which were simply outstanding. We also had Sweet and Sour Pork as out second dish. Way too much food for two people so guess what we are having for lunch today. Next time we will wither go with four people or order a little less food. Initially, prices seemed high, but when we saw the amount of food it was well worth the price. We have started a folder of restaurants we have enjoyed and keep a copy of the menu in there for future reference. Needless to say Joyful House menu has been added. This is definitely a keeper!"

What was uttered represented a grunt at best.  And like with too many Chinese restaurants, do not expect the server to return to check after serving your dishes.  The only person who communicated and provided some positive attention was the non-Asian bus boy, or maybe he was a waiter-in-training.  \n\nIt was a quiet night so several waiters stood a few feet from our table surveying the empty tables.  Guess they had nothing else to do; they stared at times and never said a word or cracked a smile.  \n\nThey should remove the \"Joyful\" name from their business and replace with \"Me-No-Smile Chinese Restaurant.\"  If hungry for Chinese food in Las Vegas, give them a try; just do not expect a \"Joyful\" atmosphere, because that's false advertising!  Will I go back again if in LV?  Maybe.......food was tasty."

I'm sure it will either be Awesome or it will at least be a story\"...       Now the sound of screeching tires...   a wild left turn from the right lane and we were there...    at Joyful House.\n\nOnce we thanked the gods that we were still alive...  we checked the yelp reviews...      a lot of them... and a really good average.  Alright, looking forward to this.\n\nSo the place is kinda what I was hoping for...     something that didn't look like a high over-head \"Asian Fusion\" type place like PF Changs (all do respect to PF...   I do love the Mongolian beef)...   it's simple and to the point...    kinda like a dinner.  Think denny's.   We got seated right away and menus came out to us...   we started looking at stuff but noticed that on the first page were three combo set dinner options...   we made it easy and ordered option 1...( We are not picky...  no food allergies...     we were just hungry)\n\nOh My God...    Come HUNGRY\n\nOut comes tea...     that's cool...   then a very large bowl of soup...Sooooo tasty.   \n\nNext egg rolls, dumplings, and other assorted fried goodies.....     MMmmmmmmm\n\nOk now rice.   Not a little but a huge plate of the rice along with chicken chow mien...     man...    there was a lot of food....  but wait there's more\n\nTwo more huge family style plates of noodles and sweet and sour chicken.   Table now covered in food...  and good food.   We ate and we ate but alas...   we barely ate half of it.    \n\nListen if you're looking for the Vegas Strip style place...   this is not your place.   If you want to be seated and fed in a relaxed, local and unpretentious place, then give this a shot.   \n\nI've read some of the other reviews about the bland food and what not and I feel bad for those people that they had a bad experience.    Clearly they came on an off day because what we got was great....     \n\nNow I just need to go and digest....     \n\nSoooooo   Fuuuuuuullllll\n\nPS    My fortune cookie was empty...

With white linens and waiters dressed in suits, it's got an upscale vibe. But, most of the customers seemed to be dressed as casually as me. \n\nTheir menu is massive. It's a large book full of items that will satisfy those looking for authentic fare and those looking for Chinese-American food -- the kind you can get from any corner take out spot.\n\nKung pao chicken was heavy on sauce, but a decent portion size with plenty of chicken, green peppers and nuts. Shrimp fried rice was light on ingredients (other than rice) but the flavors were solid. If you're a fan of bok choy, the mushroom and bok choy dish had just enough sauce to let the ingredients shine while enhancing their flavors. My favorite dish of the night was the tender, well seasoned beef in oyster sauce with green onions. I loved the flavors of the sauteed green beans, too with it's subtle use of heat and minimal amounts of oil. If fish is your thing, try the seabass. Flakey and delicate, it was a well executed dish with a light buttery flavor. Not as successful was the house fried half chicken. The skin was perfectly wafer thin and crispy, but the meat was bland and dry as a bone.\n\nPerfect for large parties, it's also great for families. Kids will love the aquariums full of crabs, lobsters and other future meals."

Salted fish in clay pot was a also a good choice. The tofu was tender and the fish slightly tender. The chicken and black bean sauce was good but was probably the weakest dish that we ordered from a flavor perspective. Not a spicy as they say it is.

She said check out your fork I think they used that one to fix the drain in the kitchen seems the forks and spoons have been there sense 1980's it wouldn't be so bad if the food was really fantastic. Costco has GREAT deals on quality table wear on MLK (TIP OF THE DAY) I asked the server what is in the dumplings he said chicken.

Jasmine is very fragrant and less starchy than say, a long grain calrose. It does cost more and better, at least I think so. Along with complimentary hot tea. Even though most chinese restaurants serve these 2 items complimentary, it is worth mentioning since I am aware some places charge for them.\nService overall has been ok.

(I think it cost around $12.00) The presentation isn't good but the dish actually tasted good. Bamboo Fungus is actually a veil from a mushroom grown in Asia. It really has almost no flavor on it's own but does have a most interesting delicate texture and is suppose to be extremely beneficial to your health. Under the Tofu and Bamboo Fungus was a large pile of fresh Chinese Broccoli.\n\nThe Special of the day was Whole Flounder for $23.00 so we ordered one fried and it was served  de-Boned Table side.\n\nJoyful House was a Joyful Experience and is on my Las Vegas Rotation!"

I only gave it 3 stars because of the service.  Our waitress never came to check on us.  We would have to ask random employees for more water, salt & pepper (they were not on any table) and sugar for the tea.  When we requested sugar, the lady kind of scoffed at us.  They took our food away to put it in to-go containers, which I really don't feel comfortable with.  Then they refused to give us the steamed rice in our to-go container; however, they came and swooped it off the table.  Leading me to wonder where is that rice going?  I would probably eat here again, but it did not end my quest for the best chinese place in Vegas."

I don't want mushrooms, chicken and broccoli, I want chicken and broccoli. So I thought I would be smart and ask whether or not it had mushrooms before I ordered it. He said no, reassuring me that there wasn't and then asked me if I wanted American broccoli or Chinese broccoli. I thought all broccoli was the same, but silly me. So I said American, being safe. Well I received me food and found mushrooms all over the dish. I guess he didn't understand as much English as I gave him credit for!"

The tables that had larger eaters were taken care of (they asked if that was enough) and even though they were busy, still pushed there food out first. \n\nFor those looking for high end Chinese food this is not, but it should not leave you disappointed."

If you are going with a group their family menu offers you a lot of food for a good price- I would say 2 orders would feed 3 people easily."

We actually came specifically for the salt and pepper fried tofu with garlic, which was amazing!  The pieces of tofu are perfectly deep fried, but not oily, and the tofu inside is so soft.  We also had garlic gai lan (Chinese dark green vegetable) and a sizzling platter with beef and onion.  The food was all excellent.  I wish we had the lobster/crab special, but we were on a budget.\n\nThe service is just OK, but typical of a Chinese restaurant.  This place was named best Las Vegas Chinese restaurant in 2010."

Let me be more specific... \n\nThe shrimp wonton soup has great hong kong style flavor, the noodles are al dente, and the wontons are shrimpy and delicious. The server comes to the table to serve and portion the noodles and wonton for each person on the table (they keep it fair whenever possible). \n\nOn another occasion, I came in with my mom and she noted how good and flavorful the white rice was. I don't really eat white rice much, but apparently it's a big deal to traditional Chinese folk. I think they think if the restaurant can't get the rice right, then what does that say about the rest of their food. \n\nSince moving out here, I miss my mom's soups/elixers and to get a taste of home, I like to order their house soup. This is on the menu but it's usually some traditional soup that Chinese families cook at home. Nothing like Egg drop, Westlake or Hot and Sour soup. It's usually a combination of chicken and pork broth based with herbs and vegetables. Generally it's good for your body or health, but it depends on which soup. \n\nIt is a little pricier than some of the more casual Chines restaurants but it shows in the quality of ingredients."

We went for takeout so we couldn't really judge the service but the guy that seats you was really nice and helpful.\n\nMy coworker recommended the salt and pepper pork chops.  Since I had always been told by my ever-so-seasoned fellow yelper/coworker reggie to always order salt and pepper anything whenever I can, I agreed to try said pork chops.  After about a 15 minute wait, the waiter brought out our food.  It smelled great and I couldn't wait to get home to try it.  I opened up the to-go box and there were small breaded pork chops (some with bone, some without) that had bits of garlic and jalepeno all throughout the dish.  It came with rice as well.  When I dug in I couldn't believe how tender they were.  These pork chops just melted away in my mouth.  The contrast of the jalepeno against the pork was incredible with just the right amount of heat and saltiness.  All in all it was a great dish and I would definitely go back.  They had a lobster sale while we were there...19.95/lb down from 29.95/lb and these things were monsters!  Anyways, check this place out...it's great for late night eats."

But this dish used greens which turned out to be very tender and perfectly seasoned\nClams in black bean sauce - probably the least remarkable of the dishes.  A number of the clams were cracked (did they drop them from high above into the wok???) and the sauce could have used a few more black beans.\n\nService was attentive, possibly because there were only 2-3 tables occupied by the time things got rolling for us.

The crispy fried tofu was done to perfection. Great texture of crunch, the seasoning was done with perfect balance and wasn't to salty or peppery. I almost ate the whole dish to myself lol! We then got our Mongolian beef and honey walnut shrimp. I can say that the flavor of these two dishes were,the best that we have had. The only downside would be the texture of the beef. For us it could have been fried a little lo,her to get a nice crisp texture on the outside, but non the less the flavor was there and it didn't hinder us, with the jasmine rice It was awesome! Bow on to the honey walnut shrimp, THE BEST!!  Crazy but it really wast the best honey walnut shrimp we have ever had. The shrimp had a nice fried coating. The shrimp itself was savory. The dish hot it's sweetness from the walnuts. It seems like the walnuts were roasted with honey and honey alone. Mixed with fried shrimp and tossed with a light coating of mayo. What a surprise. I was expecting an overly sweet, saucey dish. But it was a great balance of sweet and savory. Everything went well and ended with teat which was a nice way to end our meal. The entire meal was above our expectations and gives US a reason to come back. The portions to me are a little small for the price but what you get back in flavor is awesome."

The one thing that should stick out to the Yelp community is the SICK and I ain't kidding wine list. Joyful house is a regular stop for Hong Kong whales late night. They evidently \ncan't get enough vintage Bordeaux. There were 61's 82's 90's and a plethora of other rediculous vitages and other fun Germans as well. I am not convinced that most of the wine list paires with the food style but damn it is sexy reading."

            "review": "This place is definitely my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Las Vegas. Hands down. Every time I have friends in town and they want to eat good off the strip Chinese food, this is place we go. Its open around lunch time and closes super late, 11am-3am. When I first walked into this place, I saw a good sign. Tons and tons of other Asian families eating here. The menu is pretty extensive and also has pictures for the newbies.\n\nWe ordered: Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Pan Fried Sea Bass, Roast Duck, Salt and Pepper Sea Bass, Spicy String Beans with Chicken, Garlic Ong Choy, and some Oyster Clay Pot.\n\nWow. I was definitely amazed by the taste and quality of the food. The Salt and Pepper Pork Chops are definitely different from the other restaurants. Instead of battering the pork and deep frying it, they do it in a way that the batter isn't fried in. Its like a separate layer above the meat so you can taste both parts when you bite into it. Its weird to explain but its good. So good, that we order it every time we go there. \n\nThe Pan Fried Sea Bass is my absolute favorite. The lightly fried sea bass comes swimming in sweet soy sauce but it doesn't overpower the taste nor the light crisp. Definitely a must order.\n\nThe Roast Duck here is waaaaaay better than at Sam Woo BBQ. The dish here actually has large chunks of meat. It has a right combination of crispy skin and meaty meat. That's the way this dish should be served.\n\nThe Salt and Pepper Sea Bass was good but not a must have. The Spicy String Beans with Pork was good also.... But not a must have. I would probably order other dishes the next time I'm here.\n\nThe Oyster Clay Pot was surprisingly filled with..... Lots of oysters! It comes with roast port, fried tofu, and lots of oysters. Definitely a must have if you like this kind of dish.\n\nLast but not least, the Garlic Ong Choy is one of my favorite veggie dishes. It was cooked perfectly. The leafy part was soft, yet not overcooked, and the stems were slightly crunchy in texture.\n\nThis place is great. I highly recommended it. Funny thing is when I ask my coworkers where they go to get good Chinese food, they always say Joyful House. I felt like I was the last one in on this wonderful secret. I've been back here at least 5 times since I first discovered it. Its that good.\n\nAs always, pictures are included! Yummy!"

This time he tried the spicy one on their special lunch menu.\nSPECIAL lunch menu..did I mention it?  Corn soup, not just regular egg drop... TWO appetizers, choice of over 10 entrees and pork fried rice OR steamed rice.  WOW.  We had salt & pepper shrimp one day, duck is even a choice which I got the second time and then the spicy beef.  OH my goodness.  All for $9.75.. \nFor dinners, we've had the Chow Fun Beef with wide rice noodles...to die for, Salt & pepper fish, Mongolian Beef,  seasoned Chinese cabbage, too many good ones to remember.\nIt's no wonder this is a top 50 in THE USA Chinese, clean, ambient d\u00e9cor, and attentive servers.\nMUST GO there!"

            "review": "The consistent 4 star Yelp reviews compelled me to try the Chinese restaurant voted best for 2011.  \n\nWe ate here on Christmas evening at 10pm and the place was FULL.  The crowd was mixed with locals and out of towners.   After a 10 minute wait we were seated.  Hot tea and ice water on the table within minutes.  The server was very patient and friendly answering our ignorant questions. \n\nThe menu is full of pictures so it's easy to spot the popular items quickly. \nService is good. Prices are higher than average but just by a small percentage.\n\nWonton soup was great. Fried pork chops, flounder and fried tofu were the winners at the table.   Chinese broccoli was fresh and tender and saut\u00e9ed perfectly.   Yang chow fried rice was ok.  Solid 4 stars."

Not only their food is unforgettably delicious their staff is attentive and customer service is by far the best I have seen at a Chinese restaurant. Must try out their deep fry crabs. See you again next time. Keep up the good work."

I was proven wrong, not only did they have great food, they had GREAT service, I didn't expect it (coming from a Chinese food restaurant) it was a great experience from food to service."
