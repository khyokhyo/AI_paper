Priced at around $10 per dish, it's definitely affordable enough to grab a couple times a month (or more if my wife requests it). There isn't a single dish that we've ever had that wasn't rich in flavor and extremely tasty. And the service is very consistent across the board. If you like Thai food (or Oriental food in general), check them out and you won't be disappointed."

My husband challenged himself by requesting a \"10\" on his dish, and said they did a great job keeping flavor in mind and not just spice/heat. I wasn't brave enough to try it, but he loved it! Will be back for sure."

The tom yum (4 stars) was pretty fantastic with great lemongrass and seasoning. Thai tea here was insanely good (5 stars). Atmosphere was spot on and would be a good date place but the service was a little lacking when compared to that of Pin Kaow which has been consistently attentive."

I had the veggie soup and veggie panang curry. My partner had spring rolls and chicken fried rice. The food was indeed good. I really enjoyed my soup. And the service was pretty cool as well. They were patient with questions and accommodating all the same. I will return and try something else. I was hoping to have my socks knocked off, but shall return to see what happens next. Good thai on the go!"

I usually go too regular Archi still stand by as best place comes too Thai food in Vegas. Archi Thai Bistro pretty good comes up short too Archi. I had Thai BBQ chicken lunch special. I love the crispy skin on the chicken with the marinade could eat chicken skin by itself. You get leg, thigh, wing, and part of the breast. Side of the BBQ sauce that really really good! I could see that same sauce on any protein being delicious. The fried rice was da bomb! Fried rice must admit that stands out LOUD. Most of the time order friend rice never any good but this one was perfect. I wish you get more with lunch special but it is lunch special all good cheap good food. \n\nThe service was great nice warm welcome walked in and fairly empty sit wherever I liked. The interior really Thai atmosphere from the decoration the paintings, couple statues, and Thai music playing in the restaurant. It kind of dark with the low ceilings so first check like ok. The service too the food really good stuff. Sure I would come back try more of the menu."

I have only tried 2 different dishes here but both were delicious. \n\nThe first time a came here I ordered the chicken pad thai which was pretty good but Ive had better but the next time i went here i ordered the beef pad see ew and omg it was so delicious. The pad see ew is very flavorful i love the flat noodles they use and there very generous with the beef, I do ask for it with no Chinese broccoli I'm not a fan of that. They use good quality product and the portions are generous it got to the point where this is all I ordered and i would come at least twice a week that's how good it is. \n\nso all in all great food, big portions and friendly service I probably wont be trying any other thai places for a while."

I think we got eight dishes for the six of us and almost finished everything. I got a small box for the leftover pineapple fried rice and ate it for breakfast the next morning. mmmm... The Massaman curry was very very good as was everything else. They asked us to give each dish a spicy rating 1-10, but I don't think their chefs have that fine control. Everything had a fair amount of heat, but some were spicier than others. We got 7 on the eggplant dish and it didn't seem any hotter than the others. Of course we had to get dessert, so we shared a sticky rice with mango and ice cream. The ice cream was a bit much, but oh so tasty.\n\nThe decor is really nice and contemporary and the service was good. The price was very reasonable considering the amount of food and drinks we ordered. A must if you're in Vegas, forget the fancy places on the Strip, this place will be worth the drive. I think they have a second location closer to the Strip, but I haven't been."

I don't remember what entree I ordered (it wasn't very memorable) but one of my friends had the larb and the other had the wonton soup. Both were great.. which is why I came back a couple months later. \n\nThat time I ordered BOTH the larb and the wonton soup (don't worry I shared!) and my friend ordered some sort of beef salad, which was good as well- it's just that once I find the one entree that I love, its hard to change my mind LOL\n\nAnyways, the only reason I didn't give it the 5 stars was due to the food's spice level being inconsistent (I ordered a 4 both times but got the second one a lot spicier).\n\nSince the dishes come out \"family style\" I would recommend coming with anywhere between 2-4 people, but the portions aren't huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge so I wouldn't try to come with more than 4 unless you want to order the same entree twice. Have fun!"

I'm not Thai but I might as well be for all the Thai food that I consume on a weekly basis.  Another restaurant that knows my face.  I walk in the door and they look at me like we're old friends.  The food is so good. The execution of most of their dishes is so well.  The normal favorites that you just can't go wrong are the pineapple fried rice, tom yum soup, fried chicken wings, Thai beef salad, pad kee mow, Pad Thai, chicken panang and chicken satay.     The price is cheap too.   People, just come here!  You can't make it better.  (And no, I do not know the owners, nor are we friends.  I just love their food and they love my money.  It's a simple relationship.) -M2"

They have a pretty large dining area.  \n\nThe Thai tea was good, just the way I like it.  You get a whole lot of it. It's got that authentic crushed ice and sweetened condensed milk.\n\nI got the yellow curry with shrimp and it was really good. The consistency was just right. And I like how the vegetables, potatoes and onions were nice and big whole pieces not finely diced. It had more of a bite and soaks up the yellow curry sauce better.  This might actually be the best yellow curry I've had, dare I say. The white rice also had a hint of coconut flavoring and that was a nice and pleasant surprise.\n\nI also had some pad thai and that was also good. I would have liked to try the desserts but I was way too full. Next time."

I always order between the same three dishes for myself and Ruben: Red Curry, Pad Thai, and Fried Rice. Their red curry is just fabulous. I order it with level 5 (out of 10) spiciness and with its fresh vegetables, bamboo shoots, and choice of meat (or more vegetables), it's just so, so good (don't forget the always delicious Jasmine rice)! The Pad Thai (also level 5) is tasty and satisfying. I love the crushed peanuts and fresh bean sprouts. It's really wondeful with chicken. As for the fried rice, we order it with level 6. Of ALL the Asian restaurants I've had fried rice, Archi's is one of the BEST executions. The flavors are amazing and when I ate meat, I used to order their \"combination\" and the meats weren't micro pieces that were over-cooked, but rather plump and fresh, cooked perfectly. Even the vegetarian option was delicious! Plus, you seriously can't beat the prices!\n\nEdit: I can't eat spicy food as much as I used to, so now I order level 2 for a little kick, but nothing insane. My new favorite dishes are the Curry Fried Rice, Basil Fried Rice, Pad Kea Mow, Spicy Eggplant, and Spicy Basil. Everything is really great though! I've also enjoyed the Tom Yum, Tom Kha, Pad See Ew, and Panang. Try something new when you go!!"

In fact, I was curious to try Archi's. There are several Archi's around town and I've heard that they have pretty good food. \n\nWalk in...and this place is packed! I'm talking about a wait during lunch to get a table. Wow! I've never seen this during a weekday lunch at any establishment around where my office is. Must be good....then I look around and see that no one dining in the restaurant was Asian. Warning signals are ringing....but I keep an open mind. \n\nTheir lunch specials did not seem appetizing (there were about 8 specials) and so we ordered off the regular menu. \n\nOur order (shared):\n\nPapaya Salad - They were kind enough to omit the shrimp and fish sauce. We asked for medium but this thing was SPICY...I was sweating and sniffling the whole time. I wouldn't say it tasted bad but I couldn't really taste much of since my taste-buds were paralyzed for the most part\n\nPad Kee Mao with Tofu - Ok....this dish had about a gazillion baby corn slices, bamboo shoots and canned mushrooms. Really? Those are the 3 things I hate the most and the dish was about 60% that! Again, we ordered medium but I couldn't eat it as it was way too spicy. I have never seen Pad Kee Mao prepared this way and thankfully I haven't, because I absolutely disliked it\n\nPanang with Tofu - The only passable dish of the lunch. The gravy was passable. There was a very distinct taste of the \"Thai Kitchen\" red curry paste you find at the grocery stores in the Panang. Also, there was very little gravy which made it sort of hard to eat with the rice. \n\nOur waitress was very friendly, accommodating and didn't mess up our order at all so I really liked that. The restaurant had cute hardwood/laminate flooring and a very \"Asian-style\" atmosphere which made lunch a fun experience. \n\nThe food here was a joke and it's really not catered to anyone who's enjoyed eating good Thai Food. They aren't really cheap either (the bill for all 3 dishes was $29 not including tip). Don't think I'll be clamoring to come here again unless I'm taken hostage by my adorable pregnant friend...then I might just make an exception."

There was litter on the floors and no one picked it up throughout the lunch period, but other than that it was just fine.   If I lived in Vegas, I would go back and explore the menu a bit more and then I would adjust my review accordingly.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place to anyone who likes Thai food...btw:  Their Hottest setting is not really very hot."

Going in with my usual gluten questions, I was a little disappointed that they had no idea what I was talking about. I saw that they offered rice noodles, so I asked to have that replace the rice, as most asian rices have gluten. The atmosphere was pleasant, nothing special. There was elevator music playing the whole time. The food took 32 minutes to reach the table. It wasn't very crowded, it was 7:30 on a Monday night. We didn't have a designated waiter, multiple people came to our table. I probably wouldn't come back unless for a special event or with others who plan on paying ;) The food was good but not the best, definitely not bad though."

Both soups were excellent; filled with fresh and tasty veggies. We split a veggie Pad Thai. Generous portion for two even. It was again tasty; filled with fresh veggies, the sauce was outstanding with perfect noodles too. The staff was obviously short handed tonight and they did a really great job despite the overload.

Peanut sauce was some of the best I've had (5/5). The fried wontons were also very good, but we weren't big fans of the plum sauce served with them. I was hoping it would be similar to duck sauce but it was way too sweet. But the wontons with the peanut sauce were amazing (4/5). Basil fried rice was a huge portion. My friend said it was really good, better than most other Thai places she's eaten at. Spice level was a little high for her and she only ordered it at a 4 (5/5). My red chicken curry was the bomb. I like to consider myself a curry connoisseur because it's basically the only food I can everyday without getting tired of it. This curry was so good, probably the best I've had in Vegas.   Spice level was 8 and I thought it was true to the scale (5/5). Will definitely be returning. Hopefully the other locations are just as good because this one is kinda far for me."

We ordered the Tom Yum soup and originally I was surprised to how expensive it was for just a soup, but the waiter assured me it easily splits between 4 people, but he was wrong because we could have had 8 at our table and it would have been plenty! The flavor was on point with plenty of largely cut chicken and vegetables, but we ordered a spice of 5/10 and thought it was more of a 7-8/10. Nonetheless delicious. My daughter ordered the chicken noodle soup and she liked it, but my son tasted it and thought it was somewhat bland, but he's older and his taste buds are more developed. It had plenty of noodles and chicken. My son and I shared the chicken and tofu pad thai which was amazing, again, a very large dish. Spice level was supposed to be a 9/10 and the waiter said that pad thai typically doesn't get too spicy, but we figured at a 9, it should. It felt more like a 3-4/10 spice which was disappointing. It was a bit oily as well due to the fried tofu but overall the flavors were very good and no doubt I would return again. Prices are excellent as well."

There were only Asians in the cramped backroom and we were the only brown people in the restaurant. Didn't think anything of it at the time, but it seems weird bc we had no children. It wasn't until later when I went to the front counter to pay that I saw that everyone in the front of the restaurant was white and there was a combination of groups with and without children. No Asian person in the front and absolutely no brown person either. Weird. \n\nThe lady that took our order was nice but may have been over worked. She didn't come back after giving us our food and we were confused if we would have to go to the front and pay bc she kept checking up on the tables around up and gave them their checks. I would have liked the same courtesy. \n\nI really enjoyed the food though.  We ordered our dishes extra spicy and they really did deliver.

This time, we ordered the stuffed wings; boneless Chicken wings that have been stuffed with minced pork, clear noodles and vegetables that are then deep fried!  It's a miniature, pre-TurDuckEn type of App that, with the Plum Sauce, is a great starter. Protein component, check! Fried component, check!\n\nOther great Apps-Chicken or Pork Satay, with the Peanut Sauces, it's pretty addictive.  As well, the Pla Muk Tod (fishcake) is awesome to tempt your palate before the main event!  The Soups are good too, I just can't have too much cuz I sweat way to much on my head eating hot stuff-but Tom Kha Gai is my favorite\n\nThere's just nothing like Thai Curry; I'm partial to Massamum or Penang Curry (I find that the sweeter\ncurries create a balance with the heat) but I won't turn away a Red, Yellow or Green one from the table!

I asked for a 7, and there was literally NO kick in my food. \n\nIssue #2: Our waters were never refilled. We had to hunt someone down to have them refilled. (That's ALWAYS annoying)\n\nSo you could say service was definitely lacking. Cleanliness, I would say isn't too clean. I don't get that \"clean feeling\" upon walking in the establishment, but I had to constantly look around me to ensure it was clean. The quality of food is still good.

(15 minutes later.) \"The wait will be another 15 minutes.\" Oh no it won't.\n\nNow, I came here with a group of 10 on a weekday afternoon for a quick business lunch. I understand that a busy and popular restaurant such as this will have time delays when bussing a table for a group as large as we were. However, I don't appreciate being lied to about the time frame--be honest and up front from the beginning or accommodate us accordingly. \n\nPlease keep in mind: we called 10 minutes ahead. \n\nWhen the host straight up tells you, \"Well, those people are eating longer than I thought they would. And when that table gets up you can go there,\" there's a big, fat, ugly red-flag and sirens blaring for the service department. \n\nIf you can take one thing from this review, it's this: call ahead, or be prepared to fight for your table. \n\nAnyways: on to the food. \n\nThey have a really massive menu with different dish options for every palate. They also have some great lunch options for the diner on a budget (always got to love that). It was tasty, but I've had better. Nothing that keeps me dreaming, but something that definitely keeps me full and satisfied in the moment. \n\nSorry peeps, it's just the service...it left a bad taste in my mouth. Pun unintended."

A place I would recommend when you have a few in your party so you can splurge on all different types of meals. \n\nWe started off with the Tom Yum soup.  We all ordered rice on the side so we could put that with our soup.  It was so yum that we went silent when it got served.  \n\nFor main dishes, to play it safe with everyone else we ordered Papaya Salad, Mongolian Beef, and Pad Thai.  Nothing disappointed us.  We ordered everything on Medium spicy to keep it safe since you never know their level of spiciness.  We didn't have any left overs among the four of us sharing. \n\nThis really hit the spot.  Glad its in my neck of the woods.  I usually like to go to Chinatown to get my Thai fix, luckily my taste buds and tummy was satisfied with the spice!"

I felt a little awkward and I wasn't sure if these people were in line or what. After about a good minute of standing there a girl slid by my friend and I and gave her name to the man at the counter to the right who didn't acknowledge anyone coming into the place. Hrmm. I headed over and gave him my name. He wrote it down. That was it. No salutations. No telling me how long the wait would be. Oooo-kay. Moving on...\n\nWe were sat in about 10 minutes (would have been nice to have known the wait time...). Our waitress arrived quickly and we were already ready to order because we were ordering off of the lunch special menu. I ordered the pad thai with chicken at a spiciness level of 7 and I ordered a Thai iced tea. My friend ordered the red curry with tofu at a spiciness level of 9 and we waited.\n\nThe restaurant is small and somewhat loud, but not so loud you can't hold a conversation. The tables were clean and the place looks new and polished. \n\nAs for the food. My friend and I both declared it to be pretty good, but nothing amazing. My pad thai was okay - but the noodles were a bit dry and clumped together. The side of soup was actually quite good and had an interesting flavor, coupled with the mushrooms, which I found to be a great addition. The egg roll fell flat with me, it was basically an egg roll - nothing more. My friend had just about the same reaction with her red curry. It was all right. \n\nWe ordered two very basic Thai dishes. These are base lines for what the rest of the menu will be like. Hmmm. I can't say Archi's is good enough for me to return to - especially during the busy lunch hour. The strange way the host was handling people as they came in the door was a BIG turn off for me as well. \n\nArchi's gets an okay from me for now."

The beef salad was fresh and the beef was tender and the flavors were delicious.. The Pepper Steak, we could've done without..didn't leave a lasting impression.. \n\nWe enjoyed our lunch here and the servers were very attentive and pleasant.."

            "review": "Well, even though there are a few hundred reviews of Archi's Thai Bistro, I figured that I should add my two cents in as its one of my favorite Thai restaurants in town and is literally walking distance from my workplace.\n\nTHE DECOR (4 out of 5)\nWhen you walk in, there is a extremely small waiting area right next to the cashier. This is fine if there isn't a wait, but if you go there for lunch during the week and you don't get there early, you will have to wait. Besides that the decor of the place is simple and nice, and the restaurant has plenty of seating available.\n\nTHE SERVICE (3 out of 5)\nMost of the time, the service here is pretty good. But when it gets busy, it might take a little longer to get a refill on your drink or as what happened one time (no, not at band camp), I think that they kind of forgot about or order because several other tables who had ordered after us got their food first. Hey, it happens especially if it's really busy....luckily that only happened once to me out of all the times that I've been there.\n\nTHE FOOD (4.5 out of 5)\nNow we get to the best part, the food. I've order either the Pad Thai lunch special with chicken, the Panang curry, Pad Woon Sen or the Pad See Ew (I've ordered this the most). All have been very good eats! The only drawback to their food is that the Thai spiciness level (you know, from 1 to 10), isn't necessarily accurate.....well, if you like spicy foods that is. Most of the time I'll order it as a 10, but often it seems like a 3 or a 6 instead.\n\nOVERALL (4 out of 5)\nIf you on the lookout for some really good Thai food, then check out Archi's Thai Bistro. It's definitely on my top three list of Thai restaurants in town (the other two are Lotus of Siam and Le Thai)."

Biggest difference I noticed was the decor at the Flamingo location, really felt like we were in an actual Thai family home dining room?! In regards to food, both places were Outstanding!!\n\nThe orders:\n\nPad SeeEw (pork): Best Pad SeeEw i've had (better than Lotus). Simply Perfect..\n\nPad Thai (beef): Dinner portion came with a serving that could be split with another person. A little sweet but the medley of flavors all together were just right. Another hit! (3 of 10 on the heat scale, not much punch)\n\nStuffed Chicken: An appetizer sized dish. Came with 2 pieces of chicken drum sticks stuffed with goodness!.. Goes great with the sweet dipping sauce! The slight crunchiness of the skin just incorporates a very nice texture.\n\nSpicy Basil (chicken): The herbs, the spices, the tender bits of chicken.. Wow, this place just doesn't have any flaws!! (3 of 10 on the heat scale, But this time it felt like 3 times Hotter!)\n\n* I asked the waiter \"Why was the Spicy Basil MUCH Hotter than the Pad Thai when I ordered both with 3 out of 10 heat?\" She replied \"because some dishes are spiced/heated with powder chili like the Pad Thai and the Spicy Basil we use the actual Thai chili's so it will be hotter..\" \n\n\nAnother Exceptional  Thai Restaurant here in the Desert!! Well above average Service, Food All Very Impressive, Atmosphere Clean and Casual and Prices well worth it!! For sure coming back here!!!"

I've always liked how Archi's locations are decorated. Feels homey, feels like you're visiting with a friend and being treated at his house. Over the past couple of years I've ordered just about everything off of their menu but some items are my favorite. Beef Salad, Papaya Salad, Chicken Larb and Chicken Satayed skewers are my favorite. Papaya Salad is always the freshest no mater where else I order it. It's funny how I'd prefer Archi's to all the thai restaurants I tried while in Thailand. Is it because Archi's menu is maybe customized for an American palette?  \nAnyhow the service here is great as well, never had to wait too long to be seated, een during busy lunch hour."

One of the dishes I ordered contains shrimp and since my son doesn't like shrimp, I asked it we can have extra egg instead. Guy who took my order said, \"Sure, no problem.\" Did not say ANYTHING about it costing extra. When I picked my food up, I was not happy to see that I was charged $1.95 for extra egg. When I questioned it, his response was that they don't do substitutions and he should have clarified over the phone when I placed my order. Her offered to remake the entree without the extra egg. Really?? So it makes more sense to waste food instead of just taking off the $1.95??! And is it worth upsetting a long-time customer over $1.95??!\n\nGuess we'll be looking for a new Thai restaurant."

The portion was large and the taste and quality of ingredients used were superior to many other Thai restaurants. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was not dry -- a feat only few have been able to accomplish.\n\nThe service was a bare minimum. There was no personal interaction; it was drop off your food/drink and quickly run off. I get it, it's busy... but you're doing well so stop being stingy and hire more wait staff.

Although we did feel a little rushed to leave as we were one of the only two tables left. I had the papaya salad as a starter, I liked that they added the dehydrated shrimps, most Thai restaurants don't. The spice level is pretty accurate. I ordered the seafood tom yum level 7 and it was pretty hot but not inedible. Delicious!"

It is always hard for a place to live up to its reputation when the expectations are so high, but even taking that into account, while the experience and service was acceptable, the food was a huge let down.\n\nMy co-worker and I went to the Rainbow location for lunch, and were greeted at the door by a short line of people and a 10-15 minute wait, which I took as a good sign.  Busy restaurants are usually really good restaurants so I never mind a short wait.  We were seated in a corner by the kitchen.  The overall service was perfectly acceptable for the lunch rush, with prompt drink service and consistent refills.  The server took our orders, and another employee came out to verify my co-worker's order just to make sure that it was correct.  I immediately mocked my co-worker for being complicated.  The wait for our lunch was a little long, but again that does not factor in to my rating as it was during the lunch rush.  Upon my order arriving, that's when the experience went downhill.\n\nI ordered their \"Signature Dish\", the Pad Thai with Chicken, with a requested heat level of '10'.  The dish was served with a pinch of salad\\greens, and a spring roll.  It was also, unfortunately, served with a healthy heaping of raw sprouts.  Had they been cooked, no problem, but when they're raw, they're often nothing more than a snow white vehicle for e-coli.  I ate around them.  The spring roll was \"OK\" and the sauce was slightly sweet and just a touch spicy.  Then I dug into the heaping mound of noodles.\n\nThe best I can say is that they were warm.  \n\nBarely.\n\nWith random pockets of \"kinda hot\" and a chewy, overcooked texture.  The chicken seems to have been an endangered species for the dearth of pieces that found their way to my plate, and the overall flavor was just bland.  If the spiciness index of this plate was a '10' a '5' would probably put my taste buds into an irreversible coma and a '1' would perform a lobotomy through the roof of my mouth.  TL\\DR, it wasn't spicy at all.  \n\nI really wanted to like Archi's, but if this is their \"Signature Dish\" I really don't know that I have much interest in trying any of their other dishes.  The service was acceptable, the staff was very friendly, the portions were large, and the price was OK for lunch, but the best description I can give to the food is \"Mediocre Freezer Meal\".  I've had vastly superior offerings at Pin Kaow.  Heck, even Mr. Chop Chop on the east side serves palatable, hot Thai food with a side show as their socially awkward offspring try to act as servers.  Sorry, Archi's, I probably won't be back..."

All the flavors came together beautifully. \n\nSo the food was great, however the service was horrible. We walked into the restaurant to place our order because their voice mailbox was full when we called. After placing the order, we were told it would be 20 minutes, so we had a drink at a place a few doors down. When we came back, it was another 20 minutes before we got our food. They totally didn't even start making it until we came back!  There were no apologies, just the excuse that they were super busy. It took forever to get our food and they were less than accomodating, so I'm super pleased that the dishes were perfect. It eased the pain of an annoying inconvenience."

The red curry sauce was a little too runny and didn't have as much flavor as what I've had at other places. The papaya salad was average. \n\nOverall, I'm left somewhat satisfied but still puzzled at how they could have gotten so many awards when my entire experience was lacking from the less than average service and about average food. From the high expectation that was set from their grandiose display of awards I felt disappointed by their horse and pony show."

It wasn't until recently, though, that we realized we had one right down the street from us.\n\nThe variety on the menu had me sold the first time I pulled up their website. (You can also submit an online order for pickup, and the interface allows for customization.) For the first time, I wondered if I might deviate from my usual \"pad thai with tofu.\" The Pineapple Fried Rice, \"stir fried with tomatoes, onion, green onion, pineapples, cashews, raisins, egg and cumin powder,\" had me tempted.\n\nIn the end I stuck to my usual, though, beginning with deep-fried tofu to share and chicken satay for Mike. The tofu was unremarkable. Not very crispy, and the sauce was ordinary. Mike liked the satay. Not the very best in the city, but good.\n\nOur opinions bounced upward with the arrival of my pad thai and Mike's \"Ginger Ginger Ginger.\" He's still talking about it. I found the pad thai such a treat that I'll probably finally get something different next time, just to see what else the chef can do. The pad thai tasted very similar to that at Panna Thai and Pin Kaow II - not too oily, medium-sized tofu, nuts on the side - but neither of those establishments have a menu that seems as well-suited to a curious vegetarian as Archi's. \n\nOther Yelpers had warned readers about the heat, but we didn't heed them. Oops. We always order around a \"7.\" Archi's \"7\" was more like an \"8 or 9\" to me, and my husband - who tried my dish as well as his, said the Ginger-Ginger-Ginger tasted like a \"10 or more.\" Recalibrate accordingly. We're planning on asking for \"5\"s next time, and even then with some trepidation.\n\nService is reliable and the decor is light and classy, with photos in tasteful frames and natural light shining through.

As I get older I can't handle spice as much as I used to so I always order mild and get the spices on the side.  You have to ask for the spices as they don't always give it to you but it's worth the asking as this way I can add a little more as I go for an extra kick."

The staff has their stuff together and makes your dining as enjoyable as possible.    I really like their lunch specials, and usually have chicken curry or Chicken pad thai.

We ordered beef pad thai I am very familiar with thai food and this was not even close to the taste of what they had before. It  didn't taste  peanuty and it was a bit too sour, The beef was tender but it felt gritty there was some after taste too. The thai ice tea was a bit strong too.It used to be smooth and creamy to the taste. The appetizer with Chinese sausage was good  it is a new taste for me. They were nice enough to take out the  pad thai from our order . I was kind of disappointed because pad thai is a very basic and important to the Thai restaurant menu. The prices were great for the portions of food they give but the taste was a little off. Great ambiance  but I just want my pad thai more authentic. Thanks I also ordered sukiyaki but the server said I did not order or he did not hear me.I waited and waited to find out that he did not put the order in.( We ended up eating somewhere else because i was really hungry after this."

They have an extensive menu, and they cook everything from a spice level 1 (not spicy) to a spice level 10 (my mouth is on fire!).\n\nThe prices are very reasonable for the amount of food that is served. My favorite dish is the Pad Ka Pow, however, their Tom Kha soup is also tasty. On a chilly Autumn night, there's nothing like a bowl of warm Tom Kha. The hints of cilantro and coconut milk really make for a pleasant experience. \n\nWhy 4 stars instead of 5?

In retrospect, I've been to a lot of different Thai restaurants throughout my yelp career and this was one of my favorites. According to their accolades displayed on the window outside, it seems that I'm not the only one who thinks they serve amazing food.\n\nWe had a very large party for my sister's birthday and ordered family style for the entire party. The food came out very quickly and the portions were perfect. If you're not sure what to order, here are my favorites that are easy to like. My favorite noodle dish is called pad kee mao (spelled differently at some places) and it's a stir fry noodle dish that's really flavorful. The other is a ground meat and basil dish that goes best with rice! If you like things on the saltier side, try a couple dashes of fish sauce.\n\nI was impressed by the papaya salad because I would normally never think of eating papaya, but some places don't make it well and it tastes like what fresh cut grass smells like. Ew. Instead it was spicy and the sauce got rid of the papaya taste. The other dish I normally don't order but liked was their beef panang.\n\nDespite our large group, the service was very quick and attentive. I don't think my water ever went below half and I always had a glass of wine lined up after pounding the previous one. Yes, I know you're not supposed to pound wine.

I live for good thai food and this place has injected new meaning into my life. Ok so maybe that's an exaggeration, but seriously they're good. This was easily the best lunch special I have ever eaten in a Thai restaurant outside of Thailand, and it was reasonably priced too. After eating so many mediocre thai lunch specials during work, I have finally found one that is worthy of the drive.\n\nThe interior is clean and well kept. The staff consists of trendy young Thai immigrants who offer excellent service. I decided to try the pepper steak lunch special. The soup came first. It was Tom Khar Kai ( chicken in coconut milk) and it was pretty damn good. Not the best I have ever had but the flavoring was solid and clearly made with an authentic recipe. The salad was pretty much your standard thai salad with the sweet dressing. The eggroll was pretty impressive--MUCH better than the standard greasy hunk of dough you get at your average Chinese restaurant. The beef was excellent-- tenderly prepared and sufficiently seasoned, accompanied by an aesthetically pleasing arrangement of green and red bell peppers and sauteed onions. I devoured my plate and sent my compliments to the chef, who by the way, brought me the meal herself. That's another great thing about this place-- you can see them do much of the preparing in their open kitchen which holds them to a higher standard of food preparation. I tipped generously and bookmarked this place. I will have to come back here with my girlfriend and see if the dinner entrees are all that they are cracked up to be, but if the lunch special was any indication, I'm sure I'll be more than satisfied."

We all ordered our food at the same time, as well as some appetizers. \n\nThe fish cakes and papaya salad came out and it was pretty tasty. \n\nTwo Spicy Basil dishes came out first. Next the Red Curry dish came out. Everyone was being polite and wanted to wait for my meal to come out. We waited for about 15 mins and their food started to get cold. \n\nIt was obvious that the server forgot about my order..  I checked up on it and the runner said it would be out shortly. I tried waiting as long as I could but got so furious that I lost my appetite. So we went ahead and cancelled my order. The server never apologized or checked up on us after the food was delivered.. \n\nThey simply didn't own up to their mistake or see if I wanted something else to eat. I'm a server myself and I understand that mistakes happen. The server could have easily redeemed herself if she apologized.. Which she didn't! \n\nBut after this experience, Archi's lost me as a customer..."

Whenever we end up near here, it's a must that we stop in.\n\nThe food is excellent.  I recommend the Spicy Basil, the curries, and the Beef Salad.  My wife heartily recommends the Pad Thai.  The dishes are all very flavorful and the portions are generous.  My Spicy Basil provided two meals, while my wife's towering plate of Pad Thai had enough leftovers for two additional meals.  Prices are comparable to other places and reasonable, in my opinion.  We've always gone at lunch time on weekends so we've never had to contend with the crowds that other reviewers mention.\n\nI only have two dings against Archi's.  The first is that their spicy scale (1 - 10) can be inconsistent depending on who's cooking.  I've gotten a 2 before (I'm a white boy with white boy taste buds, come on) and it absolutely lit me up.  And then I've gotten a 1 to be very cautious and it was not even remotely spicy.\n\nThe second ding is one of the more common complaints: the staff is not personable or congenial.  At all.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a hostess who looked so absolutely disgusted with existence that you would think that she was just told that Santa isn't real.  No smile, no greeting, just a begrudging walk to our table.  She ended up being our server too.  Mercifully, the rest of the staff picked up the slack and were able to fill most of the voids that she left in the service.\n\nDon't let the occasional grumpiness deter you from this place.  The food is more than worth a few frowns."

            "review": "Finally. I made it to one of the top Thai places in Vegas. It's only taken me 5 years to do it. After reading the reviews of Jaime W. and Jessie B., two people who I totally trust to not steer me wrong I bookmarked Archi's and due to unusual circumstances I found myself craving Thai food and Archi's was close by. So off I went. Would it live up to the hype? I have to say yes....to a degree. \n\nA tall glass of Thai iced tea started me off but the Chicken Panang Curry was my go to choice for my first visit. I've been a lot of places where the curry was barely palatable, you end up hurrying through it so you can get on to better things. Not this time. This curry had flavor, it actually made me slow down a bit and enjoy it vs. just slamming through it. It wasn't too thick, and it didn't look like something you buy in a box at Smith's in the Organic section. This was just right.\n\nI was also impressed with the service. You can tell you're closer to Summerlin as this is not a hole in the wall place. It's definitely one of the nicer Thai places I've been in with service that was prompt and attentive to my needs without overdoing it. I was impressed with the portion sizes as well, I certainly did not leave hungry. \n\nMisses: Spices. I was asked how hot I wanted it and I asked for medium heat. While the dish had spices in it, it didn't bring the kick that I was hoping for. Price was another slight miss. Granted it's a bit more upscale than some places and I don't mind paying a bit extra for that. If you're wanting to slam through some cheap hot and spicy Thai food look elsewhere, but if you want to sit back and enjoy a good Thai experience...you can't go wrong here. \n\nI have to be honest, as much as I liked Archi's, I still think that Komol is superior to them. Granted Komol is not as upscale, their location needs a facelift, but when it comes to their food they are second to none. And in my book they still top Archi's. But not by much. And Archi's on one visit alone blows the overhyped, overrated, it really ain't all that Lotus of Siam out of the water. (I absolutely HATE Lotus and won't apologize for saying so). \n\nOverall if I'm on the SW side of Vegas and start craving Thai food, Archi's is on my short list of places I'll gladly go back to again and take others with me. But if you're willing to criss-cross the city for your Thai experience, Komol is slightly better. The key word I want to emphasize is slightly. And as I try more of their offerings that slight edge may go away. It's really that close of a comparison. \n\n4 Stars. I save 5 stars for places that are truly exceptional, or that have seen me walk in their door over 650 times and counting like Komol has. In time...if what I experienced today is any indication I see a star bump in the future."

Well, other than that, my boyfriend prefers their pad thai over any other thai location's recipe. \n\nWhenever I dine here, I typically get their pad woo sen at a level 10 spice. I love the dish because I love clear noodles! The flavoring is done really well. Also, their level 10 isn't as spicy as some other locations but it's good enough for a spicy lover like me. I don't always finish my dish as well so I always take it home for next day's lunch! We've had their pad see ew as well and that was really yummy. \n\nWe came here one day for their lunch specials as well. I got their red curry while my boyfriend got their pad thai. Lunch was kind of a miss for us. Their red curry wasn't that spicy and it was kind of sweet at that. I know they should have a certain amount of sweetness to it but I still think it was too much. Same with the pad thai -- too sweet and too much sauce. Maybe it's just the chef that day? But they give you HUGE portions. \n\nOverall, come for dinner. Decent place to eat. They do take out too. Convenient."

The lunch entree includes soup, side salad (which is very simple), egg roll and a pork wonton.\n\nI chose the beef red curry, level 5 (1-10), and I packed up 3/4 of my entree to go and shared that with Earl for dinner.  This red curry was delicious.  The beef was tender (thank goodness), and there were lots of bamboo shoots in here.  \n\nI also had the thai milk tea and it was potent and yummy.

In fact, I probably go to Archi's 2-3 times more often than Lotus of Siam. After all, Archi's Thai Bistro is located in a nicer building in a better part of town and you can usually walk in and get a table right away at dinner time (lunch time on weekdays can get really busy, though). \n\nArchi's food is also some of the best Thai cuisine you'll ever taste combined with exceptional service and very reasonable prices. My personal favorites are the Thai Beef Salad, Pad Thai, Num Tok and Pad Prik Pow. Some of the menu items can be pretty spicy, but like most Thai restaurants, you can customize the spice level on a scale of 1 to 10. The servers are also extremely quick to refill your drink, usually doing so when your glass becomes half-empty.\n\nI always visit the location on Rainbow and the 215, but Archi's also has a couple other locations (one on Flamingo between Jones and Torrey Pines and the other on Sahara between Grand Canyon and Fort Apache). If you love great Thai food, you can't go wrong with Archi's."

This place, despite the Americanized namesake, is one of the best Thai places in Vegas. I would avoid their beef dishes as they tend to overcook the beef. Their papaya salad is light, fresh and tasty. Also, this location is a good 1 or 1.5 star better than their location on Tropicana."

Spiciness=6/10. It comes with a bowl of rice. He also ordered chicken pad thai. Spiciness 6/10. He said it tasted better than Pin Kaow. I beg to differ. Archi's pad thai was just too.....sweet and tangy for me. If that makes any sense. I couldn't put my finger on why I wasn't too fond of it until I read a previous review and that Yelper described it perfectly: sweet and tangy.\n\nI ordered my usual go-to Thai dish....beef pad see ew. Spiciness=7/10. I usually order an 8 but since this is a restaurant I haven't been to, don't wanna get too carried away. It was delicious. Good portions of beef, perfect amount of spice, and noodles came out pippin' hot. Now, I'm a pretty small eater. 98% of the time I always have leftovers...no matter what cuisine/restaurant I go to. I don't know why but my pad see ew came in small oval plate while my boyfriend's pad thai came on a big round plate. If I wanted to, I could have killed the pad see ew all in one sitting. I kid you not. I wasn't even hangry that night. Wasn't too pleased that the portions seemed inconsistent. \n\nArchi's is a solid Thai restaurant but if 2+ months have passed, I can tell you I wouldn't have the urge or craving to come back here."

Fast forward to many dates (including my first date with my now husband), birthdays , anniversaries,  friends visiting from out of town....\nThe food at Archies is unlike any other thai restaurant. People will try to say there are better ones in this city, but NOTHING BEATS ARCHIES!!!!!  I've literally eaten everything off the menu and it's every bit as good as the first time. you really can't go wrong with what you choose. Sometimes Archies wife is in the kitchen , we call her \"mama\". When mama's in the kitchen , you can tell, it's spicier!!! All the food is cooked with love , and the staff have been there cor years , they truly are a family restaurant. I've watched them grow over the years  to 3 awesome locations! Anytime someone is looking for something new and fresh to go eat, my husband and I always recommend  ARCHIES!!!!!!!!!"

I start this review by stating I will never, ever come back to the Bistro - Kitchen all the way! \n\nMy husband & I got here at noon on the nose today and though it was pretty packed, we got seated quickly towards the back. A few minutes later a screaming baby came in - that should have been our sign to haul ass out of there but we were starved. \n\nBoth of us ordered the same dish, the red curry with tofu, just at different spice levels - mine a 2, his an 8 (I don't even know how he does that, but I digress!) and very clearly, as the lunch specials have starters with meat typically, tell the waitress that if any starters have meat in them, please don't bring them. She repeats, \"No meat!\" and goes off to the kitchen. \n\nOrdering is almost 10 minutes into our sitting in the restaurant. During this time, a party of 7 come in (the ones with the kid screaming like a banshee notating our exact location in hell), and the couple next to us have left and have been replaced by another two guys. \n\nStill waiting. \n\nThe guys next to us get served. And leave. And still no food and hardly any sign of our waitress. Around the 12:40 mark she comes out and says it'll be just another minute and half apologizes while trying to scurry away from our table. \n\n12:43, our meal finally hits the table. Guess what folks? Both are red curries - with chicken. HOW DID SHE NOT NOTICE THIS?! It took a single glance to realize it was chicken - their tofu is very distinct and looks nothing like chicken. After a minute of disbelief, I have to flag down the waitress who assures me she said tofu - oh really?? Well it does not matter what you said but that's not what came out and you should have you know, looked at the dish you were about to serve. She apologized, ran back and served our spring rolls that came with the lunch while we waited. After 10 minutes she also offered some Thai tea but we were both not in the mood - I just wanted to eat and unfortunately this gesture did not make up for the fact that our food was late and she couldn't even glance down at the food she was serving. \n\nWe finally get our correct dishes at 1 PM. The curry is decent as usual, but we were so ridiculously disappointed by this point and the busy restaurant we came into was completely cleared out. Yes, the party of 7 had left before we got our second dish. \n\nThis kind of issue is completely inexcusable and I am sincerely amazed that they even bothered to give us a check after waiting so long AND screwing up BOTH orders. I really love their curries and their willingness to cater to vegans, but if this were my first time here I might have actually tried to eat the curry and I can guarantee I would have had a fit of epic proportions. \n\nThe only good thing to come out of this is I'm going to learn to make Thai food at home. Goodbye Thai Bistro, you will never see my face again."

The pad Prik King was not my fave, but it was good. I just wasn't the biggest fan of the flavor myself. The Spicy Eggplant was surprisingly amazing!

I have been getting chicken pad kea mow instead, and this is also a must-try.\n\nMy favorite dish here is spicy basil pork (you get a choice of chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, or combo). It's diced pork stir-fried with spicy thai basil. Also a must-try\n\nYou get to choose the level of spiciness for your dishes, which is nice.

It was ridiculously crowded for lunch and we actually had a 15 minute wait.\n\nLunch specials are all $7.95 ($8.95 with shrimp, +$1 for brown rice). They have ten selections: pad thai, sweet and sour (a stir fry), fried rice, red curry, spicy basil (with ground meat), broccoli ____, pepper steak, pad pak, kung pao, and ginger ginger ginger. Yeah, that's the same word three times. Unfortunately, they didn't have pad see ew, which I kinda wanted to try, so I picked something else.\n\nFirst item brought out was the soup of the day. Apparently, today's soup is something of a hybrid between chicken noodle soup (without the noodles) and egg drop soup. I enjoyed it a lot and quickly, and then there was about a ten minute wait for the rest of the items as the kitchen worked to get my food together.\n\nMy entree of choice today was the red curry, 2 of 10 on the spice level. I'm pretty sure a 3 would've tasted much the same, which is disappointing because I was trying to keep it even milder than I remember having my pad thai last time. I thought the red curry portion was reasonable, and the addition of zucchini to the standard bamboo shoots and bell peppers made it interesting, but it just wasn't as tasty as other places that I've tried. The lunch special also included a salad with some kind of sweet dressing, a fried wonton, and a veggie egg roll. Good, not great or anything.\n\nWater was still refilled early and often and the dining room was still aesthetically pleasing. However, the failure of the red curry to meet my standards means that I'm taking Archi's down from 5 to 4. Heck, it wasn't even that red. What were they thinking?"

My fiance loves the place, and for good reason.  They do not have a wide selection of Thai dishes, they have the standard fare of what non-Thais usually eat: curry, basil stir-fries, pad-thai, etc...  But of those standard fare, Archi's serves up good quality ingredients in a pretty presentation in a pleasant atmosphere.  Nothing is too risky, nothing can possibly offend, and thus nothing too hot, too spicy, or too incomprehensibly authentic (just don't order level 10).\n\nEven though the lunch hour is usually crowded, it's my favorite time to come to Archi's.  They have an inexpensive and delicious lunch specials menu.  For $6.95, I can always count on a yummy basil chicken, with a warm bowl of soup and brown rice (a modern American healthy addition to offer to the business lunch crowd).\n\nArchi's has three locations across the Vegas valley now, undoubtedly they're still expanding.

They already had me with this respect to the customer. We devoured shrimp toast which is presented so nicely as appetizer.\nMy husband had a Chang beer which I tried and it has a nice tang!\nWe chose pad thai which was one of the best I ever had! Next was red curry with pork and spicy basil chicken.\nExcellent!\nMy tough reviewing husband was enthralled. I earned my points with this suggestion, for he felt the meal was as close to top notch or 5 as any.\nObviously we brought dinner home for tomorrow as portions are extremely generous.\nArchi's- well done!!"

Their tom yum, tom kha, pad thai, papaya salad, and thai tea are my favs!!! oh and their pad prik king (sp?) yum!  Ive tried other thai places, and i always come running back to archis!!\n\nthe only one complaint i have was a couple of times there was this one guy server that seemed like he was saying \"FML FML FML\" in his head everytime he served us.  Seemed like he didnt want to be there or serve us.  so everytime I ate there i prayed i didnt have him as my server.  Other than him, everyone else is very friendly and the food is awesome!!!"

My friend once told me while eating at another Thai restaurant, later to be reviewed that Archie's had the best Pad Thai. I have never been and got scolded for the simple fact that this place was 5 minutes down the street. The lunch portions are a good size and include egg roll, Won ton and soup. The service is good even when they misplace your order. Yes that has happened to me here but it was an accident. I took my father in-law who I have no idea what he wanted to I over ordered and enjoyed every dish. Friends did enjoy the basil chicken which is becoming a favorite at most places now. There are three locations spread around town.  Enjoy!"

When I ordered togo, I got the Panang Curry, level 8. Although I was highly impressed with the flavor of the curry, and the consistency that wasn't overly sweet, the spice didn't overwhelm me. I wanted MORE! If I order a level 8, I do expect a little extra heat. With that said, when I dined in, I tried the basil fried rice with chicken, and the pad prik king with beef- both level 10 and I was impressed. It even cleared my sinuses by the end of the meal. The basil fried rice was one of the best I have tried. \nIncluding 2 drinks, the total was less than $30. Huge portions with leftovers, and a dinner for under $40 with a tip. Total win as far as I'm concerned. \nThe service was decent. Nothing to brag about but not horrible either. I did come  around 9:00 PM, and they close at 10:00 PM. I figured an hour was safe but I did feel a tad bit rushed towards the end. They were cleaning the floors and tables around me and the scent of cleaning supplies and spicy Thai food isn't great together. And maybe since I did order a level 10, they didn't offer me the extra spice cart, but I would have appreciated it. Small complaints but I still like to point out the minor stuff that stopped this from being a 5 star review. \nWill I be back? Of course I will, it was delicious."

The food had an authentic flavor, and my dad commented that the beef salad was better than any that he's had when he lived in Bangkok. Typically, when ordering seafood as a choice of protein at other restaurants there's not much variety; however, here the seafood in the dishes included shrimp, fish, scallop and squid. The servings are quite large as well. You may also customize your dish spice level (1-10), which is always nice rather than leaving a surprise on your tastebuds.\n\nAs for the dishes themselves, the papaya salad was crunchy and well balanced between sweet, sour and salty. The beef in the beef salad was tender and wonderfully seasoned. The tom yum soup had a nice deep seafood flavor. And finally the pad Thai was a bit on the sweet side but was nicely offset by the peanuts (which I personally was happy to see a large serving of them).\n\nThe restaurant itself was spacious, service was quick and the staff was very attentive and courteous. Definitely lives up to its hype."

When you step inside, it looks like a modern bistro with a Southeastern touch that lets you know that you are in a Thai restaurant. Inside the restaurant you can smell the fresh herbs that are used in the dishes such as the mint leaf, basil, lemon leaf, ginger, lemon basil and of course the chilli. The dominant aroma were definitely more citrusy. However, the aroma was not overwhelming. The place is well ventilated, clean, and the layout of the tables were carefully thought out. It is a good size bistro, not many people during the hours that I went but it was quiet yet very welcoming. \nThe dish that I ordered was the Pad Kee Mao. The Pad Kee Mao is a pan noodle that is stir fried with an assortment of herbs and chillies. It is salty yet there was a perfect harmony that was created with the balance of salt, sugar and spice. You will also get a hint of the citrus from the basil and lime juice which is refreshing, and it contours well with the spice from the chilli. The texture of the noodles were soft, smooshy and not overly cooked to where it taste hard and charred; there is a smooth texture to it and sometimes may feel slimy but that is just from the flavorful sauce it creates when stir frying pan noodles. Pad Kee Mao can be cooked with your choice of chicken, beef or pork. I had the chicken because I did not want to feel the the stringiness of the chicken with the smooth texture of the pan noodles. That is just my preference but it is only a matter of your taste."

I really enjoyed the tender beef and sauce was just right and not overly salty. Next time I'd up the spice to a 5 cause 3 just wasn't enough kick.

This time the phone rang 5 times before it was even answered, and I noticed the location wasn't disclosed through the greeting, which I was normally used to hearing. I thought that was a bit weird because normally the location is told to me when I call. But I figured I've been to Archi's numerous times and trusted in their service. I was told my order would be ready for pick up in 15-20 mins.\n\nI leave my apartment shortly after hanging up and arrive at this location within 5 mins to pick up my order. As I await my order, Palm comes to see me and tells me that my order isn't showing up on their computer screen. \n\nI had made the error of ordering my usual takeout order at the Flamingo location instead. I apologized on behalf of my mistake and tell Palm I would cancel the order at their other location and I'll order my takeout here instead. All the while I keep calling the flamingo location to cancel that order, but kept receiving the busy signal. \n\nI called the flamingo location 5 times and none of my calls were ever answered. (I have a screenshot of my call log to prove this statement) \n\nPalm then proceeds to tell me that I'm NOT ALLOWED to order my food at this location because of my mistake and have to drive to the other location instead. I couldn't believe my ears! I told him that I was a frequent paying customer at this restaurant, and was even trying to contact the flamingo location to cancel my order but kept receiving the busy tone. Once again he tells me it's too late, and I cant order here. Frustrated, I immediately ask to speak to the manager.\n\nLo and behold, the manager \"isn't in\" on Sundays. Instead I speak to Stan. I tell him I'm a frequent customer at this location who made the mistake of ordering at the wrong location. He tells me he can't make an exception and informs me that once again, \"I'm not allowed to order my food there, and I have to drive to the flamingo location to pick up my food.\" Meanwhile, he's telling me this while giggling and smiling. Completely unprofessional and rude to do while speaking to an upset customer. He proceeds to tell me (with a smile on his face of course), \"it's our policy.\" \n\nThis Archi's \"policy\" is NO WHERE stated on your website, yelp account, or restaurant. I've read through the entire Archi's website, and I haven't found anything even remotely similar to this statement.\n\nWhat a horrible way to treat a repeated paying customer.\nI will no longer support this establishment."

            "review": "Yet another extremely solid Thai option in South West Vegas. The wife and I headed here this weekend for lunch and we were not disappointed. I'm very close to awarding this place five stars.\n\nArchi's is a very relaxed, non-threatening sort of environment. The restaurant is clean and comfortable and the service is friendly. The first thing that struck me was that the menu was rather extensive compared to most of the Thai places you find outside of Chinatown. Eventually I decided to go for my (compulsory) Satay Chicken Sticks starter, followed by chicken \"Ginger Ginger Ginger\" which sounded right up my alley. Green onions, peppers, baby corn, lots of ginger... mmmm... They had no problems at all making mine without mushrooms which come as a standard. I was excited.\n\nWhen the food arrived I discovered that Archi's heat scale for their food doesn't obey the same laws as most other places around town. My 7/10 would have been at least a 13/10 at most other places I have eaten and I had to drink after every other bite, but my ginger dish was absolutely delicious. The satay sticks were slightly different than what I usually look for (I usually like the thin strips of chicken and these were more chunky) but still very tasty. My wife was less enthusiastic about her vegetarian fare of fried tofu starter followed by Tofu Pad Thai, preferring Panna Thai's version, but still declaring Archi's to be tasty.\n\nOverall Archi's is a quality Thai option that I hope to revisit soon, possibly dialing the heat down a little from my previous order. Conveniently located not far from the Rainbow flyover of 215, I can see this place being a great Thai takeout option for any who live in, or commute through, the area."

Our server didn't smile much or show much expression, but he was quick and efficient. Sometimes he would refill our drinks and we wouldn't even notice it!  We called him the Ninja waiter!\n\nAll the food was great as usual and no one was left unsatisfied.  I like the plush wood decor and atmosphere of Archi's as it is on par with nicer restaurants.  \n\nI've been here about 10 times over the last few years and food is always good and service have been consistent. Some might consider the service bad (sometimes the culture is just plain shy).  I just think service could be friendlier but they still got the job done. \n\nOur party of 10, with only a few glasses of wine cost about 200 dollars with included 18% tip.  Not too shabby.

Tofu Pad Thai with sticky rice. A party of five is seated after us. Their food arrives first. My food comes; still no utensils. I ask for chopsticks and the server comes and tosses them on the table. I begin to stir my food and there is chicken in my Pad Thai. The server doesn't return and my attempts to signal their attention go unanswered.

But it makes it the perfect place for an afternoon wake-up call.  \n\nLunch specials offer the best deal, as they come with a large amount of food for under $10.  I can recommend Pad Thai with tofu, Pad Pak, and Kung Pao.  I would avoid the spring rolls, simply because they are heavy and very Americanized.  When ordering, be aware that the chefs know how to use spice - ordering an 8 will make it very spicy.\n\nGo early to avoid the inevitable lunchtime rush.  If you get there after 12:30pm, be prepared to wait."

Archi's is the way to go when it comes to Thai food in this town. \n\nThis is Archi's is the second newest (or second oldest, however you want to look at it) location and the one I most frequent due to convenience. You can find this right off of 215/Rainbow. Archi's is great because it is consistently good.\n\nI have never had to make a reservation, but this location can get pretty busy during peak lunch or dinner time. I have had to wait before so perhaps reservations, especially on weekends, is  recommended. \n\nFood - 4.5/5\nLove the Thai tea here. \n\nHas a lot of authentic Thai selections. If you don't like spicy, you can order a 0 or a 1. I like doing 2 because I can't really take spicy foods but still like that \"bam\" the spicy flavor can offer. \n\nTom yum soup can be ordered with less spicy level.. It's naturally a little tangy so I found 3 extremely too spicy (and my mom, who normally orders a 5-6 found it perfect). \n\nPapaya salad is great for starters. Would recommend adding a little spice to this because this isn't the sweet fruity papaya, its made using shredded green papaya so it doesn't really have a flavor. Tastes very \"green\" (like vegetables, health, etc.)\n\nEggplant and chicken dish was pretty good. LOVE the way the eggplants taste here. Complements plain white rice extremely well when mixed together. \n\nPad thai is always a safe choice (especially for new Thai food eaters). There are peanuts here though so BE AWARE if you have allergies. You can get it with your choice of meat so that's personal preference, but it tastes universally good! And the pad thai made here is delish! This tastes good to me as a 1 :)\n\nPad see ew is another safe choice for Thai beginners. Can be on a little salty side sometimes but this is one of my favorite dishes as well. \n\n*****LIFE PRO TIP: Order the mango sticky rice for dessert if you're in mango season. You will thank me. Unfortunately they only make this when mangoes are in season, but that's how you KNOW they are fresh! \n\nPrice - 5/5\nI prefer to eat family style here just so we can get a little bit of everything. However, portion sizes are big enough to where you can order one dish entirely for yourself. \n\nThe pad thai, pad see ew, and tom yum soup have been a single dish for me and sometimes I will have some left over. The papaya salad is great for sharing but I suspect not enough for one dish. \n\nGreat portions for the price. Family style can consist of 2-3 dishes (4 if we want to bring some home for tomorrow's lunch...) for the 3 or 4 of us. This includes white rice. The price comes out relatively cheap per person this way, about $7-10 \n\nService - 4.5/5\nNothing ever spectacular but nothing bad either. Consistently good service and helpful employees. \n\nAll in all, a staple Thai place in Las Vegas. So happy the owner has grown to be able to open up 3 locations across the valley... Well-deserved success!"

Even though I am Thai, I just don't understand why they have to include Chinese food in the menu. HAHA Maybe it's their marketing strategy, who knows. I always stick to the Thai food. I am at a Thai restaurant, right?!?! Anyway, the food never lets me down. I'd never be embarrassed to bring my friends who are not Thai to this place because the place is very nice and clean inside. I'm not saying \"hole in the wall\" food isn't great some times. The location isn't in a bad area either. Service is OK here. I never expect great service from an Asian restaurant anyway. HAHA My mother always says the original location is better but I have yet to try it since it's a little ways out for me. This Rainbow location is it for me for now. \n\nI've always been there for dinner. I haven't tried the lunch menu. Dinner there has never failed me. This would be my number choice for Thai food in Las Vegas. Don't forget your Thai Iced tea!!!"

This time they made an exception. \n\nI've been to Pinkow (which is very close) many times and was always very satisfied with everything. However, many people people told me to \"try Archi's, try Archi's\" so I did since it was close to where we worked. It gets insanely busy at lunchtime, so I'd go at around 11:30am for lunch or an off time for dinner. When I walked into Archi's it was a little too nice and lacked the great questionable dump factor that I really enjoy of the great Thai places I've been to in Las Vegas (Pinkow now being an exception with it's newer locations). As always, I searched the menu for \"Spicy Mint Chicken\", but only found \"Spicy Basil Chicken\". This raised an eyebrow for me since every Thai restaurant I've ever been to has had the mint version of this dish. Anyway, I ordered it. They probably could have made the mint version, but I wanted to see their take on it.\n\nI got the lunch special which comes with soup, a wonton and an egg roll. I have to say they really do give you a lot of food for the price. I always ask for a \"10\" in spiciness and they did a pretty good job of obliging. It's never really a 10 though. \n\nOverall, the food was pretty good, but they put big chunks of cucumber in the chicken which I've never seen before and that was kind of a turn off. I had to segregate the cucumber from the chicken like a little kid since there was a strangely abundant amount of it. \n\nMy co-worker, who doesn't really vary from Americana, got the sweet and sour chicken. It looked and, by his report, tasted like dog food. I guess that what you get when order Chinese food from a Thai place. All in all, Archi's is good. It's just not my preference. It just could have been a little dirtier."

You definitely get the taste and the bang for your buck all in one. 8.95 for a Pad Thai or any of the other popular dishes. I didn't even finish mine because the portions were big. They didn't give me a lime though :( \nThe spicy level goes from 1-10 here. For those of you who know Thai food, a lot of places have 1-5. \n\nI understand that there are a couple of other Archi's in Vegas, but I haven't been to them all. I'm sure they all slightly differ considering the cooks are different. \n\nFor those who don't eat Thai and don't know what to get...

I ordered a 6, and it was perfect - I would not have wanted it any hotter. I tasted my friends' dishes as well - cashew chicken and pad see ew. YUM. Ordered an appetizer of 4 egg rolls, which were tasty, no doubt, but the star of the dish was the side of plum sauce. I could have drank a glass of that tangy sauce. Quick service, no wait for a table. Wait staff was pleasant, but we didn't have a designated waiter or waitress, which was a bit bizarre. My water glass was never even close to empty.

Nonetheless, we decided we still wanted to give Archi's a try, so the host seated us. \n\nThe servers didn't seem to establish who our designated server was, so two of them came to ask for our drink order within seconds of one another. We weren't ready to order our meals so both servers came by twice to ask if we were ready, and when we asked for a few more minutes, they both came back literally a minute later. I can appreciate the attentiveness, but to be approached four times for our order in less than three minutes was pretty excessive and annoying.\n\nWhen our waitress delivered our drinks, my Thai tea came with the straw wrapper submerged in the drink. Gross!  We ordered the Panang Curry and the Country Curry.  When the food came out, we saw that they mixed up our orders. We asked for steam tofu in the Panang Curry and fried tofu in the Country Curry, but they did the opposite.  Not such a huge deal though.  We didn't like the Country Curry at all, so we didn't finish it.  The Panang Curry, however, was quite delicious.\n\nUnfortunately, we won't be visiting Archi's again.  There are other Thai restaurants in the neighborhood that serve the same, if not better, dishes for a lower price.  We weren't fans of the ambiance or the uncomfortably cold temperature inside.  Next!"

You get to choose your level of spiciness from 1 to 10 which is nice as some places don't give you that option. The portions are huge so there is plenty to share and even take home. The price is decent especially for the portion, quality, and flavor of the food. I'm so happy that this place even does lunch specials as well that you can pre order for pick up in advance.

Also, I absolutely love their lunch special sections. They basically have a majority of my favorites on the lunch special menu, and it includes soup, salad, a fried wonton and a egg roll- and on top of that, it is not even expensive! Plus, another favorite thing about this place is their Thai tea. They serve their Thai tea in a big ass cup with small crushed ice! I love that because you are getting more liquid rather than ice. Plus, there's really no need for a refill with a huge serving of Thai tea like that! I love it! Lol\n\nThe decorations of the place and it's atmosphere is clean and elegant. I would to go here on a date with my honey if we were craving Thai food. \n\nOverall, you got to come here! The food is amazing. If you love spicy Thai food, this is the place to go! You get to pick from a scale from 1-10 how hot you want your food to be. For me, a freakin' 3 is hot enough! Lol"

My only \"gripe\" is that I wish they finely-chopped the dried shrimp up when they added it to the salad. That super-potent punch of shrimp-flavor you got every other bite was a little too much for me. Also, at $10, this is not a cheap appetizer-salad.\n\nGot the Masuman curry (with chicken). Thought it was well-done and much better than the Masuman I've had at another Thai restaurant. Archi's version seemed much more refined. I'd get it again."

My sister is the one who pointed this place out to me. It looks like just a casual dining spot from the outside. There was quite a few awards posted up on the restaurant frontage and just inside. For some reason it felt more upscale & classy. I don't know if it's the nice shutters or the shiny wooden tables. Mind you, not upscale like a fine dining restaurant on the strip. But like it would be a nice place for a date night or a business lunch. I got a very nice and relaxed feel from the general decor.\nPrices were fairly reasonable. I did notice they have lunch specials for $7.95($1 brown rice sub). I will have to try lunch another time. We shared chicken Pad Kea Mow, shrimp red curry fried rice, pork spicy basil & won ton wrapped deep fried shrimp. Spiciness for each dish can be customized from 1-10. I went along with whatever my sister suggested, which was a 3. All the dishes tasted good. The spicy basil had good flavor, but not spicy at all. The pad & fried rice also were both good, but there was a nice kick of heat.\nService was good. Prompt with taking orders and getting our food. Waters refilled constantly. Overall a nice experience. I will definitely have to return to try a few other dishes I eyed on this first dinner visit. Like the basil fried rice, larb and the various curries, to name a few."

The noodles were jammed into a small foil container...there were hardly any noodles and they were all gummed together. This is the reason for only 3 stars. A Thai restaurant should know the best way to package their food for takeout, and the rice noodles were not packed well.

Later, when our dinner came out, my mother's plate was not correct.  So we asked the server who brought the food out if we could change it for another plate.  She said we could not change our order once it had been made.  If we wanted another plate, we'd still be charged for the one we didn't want and then she just left.  We were shocked, since no restaurant we've ever been to has ever done that.  We asked again and she said \"my boss will be mad at me if I change it,\" and walked away again.  I asked another server if this was the norm and was told again that it was not possible to change your order.  I explained it was incorrect and not something my mother could eat, but was just told \"sorry\"...Finally, another server then came to our table and agreed to exchange the dish.  At this point, no one really wanted to eat, the mood was ruined by incompetent service and we ended up taking it home.  It's amazing to me how they could not take care of this simple request.

Chicken satay was not ever marinated, it was pan fried and pink inside; not even busy in the restaurant.  The basil chicken had bones in it and was freakin disgusting. The catfish was bland, with more flour than the fish itself. To top it off, the waiter shorted my change. And I walked out sick. Never coming back!!!!!!"

Archi's has been cemented as my favorite Thai place so far. \n\nThe real meat of this update is as follows.\n\nI was pondering ordering an 8 or 9 spiciness the next time I came here according to my last review. I have long since discovered that if you convince them you really want it spicy, you just order a number higher than 10. Turns out they have a secret spiciness scale that goes up to 30.\n\nBe warned! The Archi's in Summerlin will give me a 30-spicy dish that is edible and delicious. This Archi's I can not eat past a 20. A 25 was ridiculous. I dare not venture to 30. However, if you are a fan of spicy food this will definitely get you what you're looking for."

            "review": "I had an awesome first time experience at Archi's Thai Bistro. I admit my expectations coming in were low only because many Asian restaurants in Vegas have disappointed me thus far. With that mindset, I was pleasantly surprised with Archi's Thai Bistro.\n\nThe wait staff was very friendly. I came here to catch up with an old friend, so we had a lot of chatting to do. Despite this, the waiters were present for the perfect amount. They were quick to take our orders, refilled our waters without us asking, and checked on us without interrupting the meal and conversation incessantly. \n\nThe best part is the food portions. For $9 I received a humongous plate of shrimp pad thai. However, the quality of the pad thai was not the best. The noodles were not cooked to the perfect consistency and they were really small and thin in size. The ratio of shrimp to noodles was not very high. Despite the negatives, the pad thai still tasted good, and I had enough to take back home for 2 more meals. To be honest though, if price is not an issue and quality is much more important than proportions, there are better and much pricier places to go to in Vegas (such as Lotus of Siam). But the food isn't bad, and I can still see myself coming back. I also ordered a Thai iced tea. It's really sad to say that my expectations in Vegas for Asian cuisine is so bad that I didn't even expect the Thai iced tea to turn out well, but it was good. Tasted exactly what I expect Thai iced tea to taste like, and it wasn't served in a dinky little cup where all the liquid could be finished in 1 large gulp. Eh hem, take note Lotus of Siam, NAGA, and QQ Boba. \n\nThe cleanliness and ambiance of the restaurant is very pleasant. The lighting isn't too bright or too dim; I often feel like Asian restaurants are too bright while Western ones are too dim, so it was perfect here. A nice soft glow. The facility is well kept, tables and booths non-sticky, bathrooms clean. \n\nIt may be a little difficult to find since it's in the middle of a little plaza, a little ways from the big intersections. Archi Thai is across from a bank, north of Cracked Egg, and south of Dunkin Donuts. \n\nAll in all, I'd come back to sample other items."

You can get a full plate of Phai Thai, salad and egg roll for under $8.  No wonder it's slammed at lunch time.  The food is constantly good and the spice levels are just right.

Positive reviews and opinions from regulars have all told me that Archi's cooks up some of the best Thai food in town, so how could I not except anything less than the best?\n\nSERVICE\nUpon entering, both my friend and I became confused over the seating process. Normally at most restaurants, there's a sign up front indicating whether you should seat yourself or wait for a host to seat you; we didn't see any of that. We waited in the tiny entryway for five minutes. The host up front never approached us like we thought he would. It wasn't until my friend observed a customer walk in and ask the host to take down her name to be seated, that we followed her example. \n\nRESTAURANT\nIt's clean and bright. Even though this is a popular lunchtime spot, it wasn't noisy when we visited, and there sure weren't any banging of pots and pans and clangs from dishware being cleaned up. \n\nFOOD\nOriginally, I wanted to order the Panang, but there wasn't a lunch special for it. Instead, I ordered the lunch special Red Curry with tofu, and my friend ordered the lunch special Pad Thai. Lunch specials come with a bowl of sour soup, side salad, fried wonton, and an egg roll, all of which are served on one humongous plate along with your entree. Oh, and there's also the option of subbing the white rice for brown, but that'll cost extra. \n\n+Soup and egg roll: I liked the sourness of the soup, but the egg roll was just a generic restaurant egg roll that had rice noodles inside. \n\n+Red Curry with Tofu: I went for a spicy level 9 on this one. The beads of sweat that I had to lightly pat off my forehead indicated that I was satisfied with its spiciness. On the other hand, there's nothing special about the curry's flavor. All I can say is that it was missing *something* and that it wasn't rich enough. \n\n+Pad Thai: My friend said her Pad Thai was \"OK\" and could've been better if it weren't for the \"clumpy\", dry noodles.\n\nOVERALL\nI'd like to give Archi's a second chance and try their Panang the next time around, but for now it looks like I'll have to stick with my go-to Thai joints that have never let me down."

Every other time, I have gotten my meal to go. This place gets jam-packed at noon, if you are planning on having lunch here it would be a smart move to show up closer to 11.  Sometimes the wait just to pick up to go food is 5-10 minutes, with the wait to get a table just as long if not longer.\n\nThe lunch specials are $7.95 (unless you want shrimp) and you get the entree, a generous portion of steamed rice, a fried wonton and an eggroll (if you eat in I believe you also get soup). I have had better eggrolls and I throw away the wonton. The delicious ginger beef dish keeps me coming back week after week... It has baby corn, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and a ton of delicious ginger.\n\nEvery other dish at Archi's may suck, and I may never know... but based on how busy they are day after day, I doubt it.

Ordered the pad thai and the spicy basil dish entree and both came in bigger portions than I thought. Got a 3 and a 5 for spicyness which I thought was the correct rating after tasting it. Water was refilled promptly and server came to check on us. Restaurant was clean with a laid-back atmosphere. Bill came to about $20 for the two entrees. This is now my goto place for thai food!"

Unfortunately, my friend, whom I took for the 1st time, found a hair in her Arnold Palmer drink. They quickly took it back and gave her a new one but didn't really take responsibility for it until my friend asked them to and they took it off her bill. Everything else was good, but I think that ruined it for her. Out of all my friends, she was the only one that probably wouldn't go back. I'm still a lover of Archi's. I usually go to the Flamingo location, but it was convenient for our group to meet there. \n\nAlso, a few years back, they only had one location. Now, they have 3. THANK GOODNESS!!!"

In a hurry, and need some curry... you get the picture.\n\nI think I have visited every location around town, and for the most part, the experiences have been consistent: clean, attractive restaurant, solid service, tasty food. It is the perfect place for a tad adventurous business lunch. I visited the bistro for just that, and I went with the red curry lunch special. I am not sure it is a screaming deal at around $7 (plus some if you want brown rice), but it definitely isn't expensive. \n\nI slurped up the starting soup, so it was a winner. The curry flavor is not my favorite in town, but I cleaned my plate with little effort. The other extras that come with the lunch special aren't notable. If you really want curry, it is probably worth it to get a bigger portion and pay a tad extra. Plus, they only offer the red curry as a lunch special. Bummer. One other little thing, I didn't ask if soft tofu, i.e. unfried, was an option, but the default is a fried tofu. I prefer soft tofu, and that may be doable if you request it. As for spice, the level here errs on the mild side. I requested a 4 and didn't experience any hot flashes.  \n\nYes, like I said, Archi's gets the job done. It's a Thai restaurant you can bring home to meet Mom and Dad... and a personal injury attorney that isn't sketchy... and... enough with the metaphors. Go eat some curry!"

Archis makes their beef a little bit different than I'm used to, however it ended up being better. Instead of throwing in chunks of meat, they instead pounded it so that it almost had a ground beef (but not) look to it. The texture was very soft and the taste was on point. I like things pretty spicy, an 8 here isn't too spicy, next time I'll do 10\n\nMy friend is a very picky eater, so picky last time we had Thai, he got chow mein. I had him get the pad Thai this time and he loved it so much he had it both days in a row.\n\nMy second trip I got the kung pow chicken/shrimp combination. Again, it was on point. \n\nThe prices here are reasonable for the quality of food you are getting. I'd highly recommend this place if you like Thai, or are interested in having Thai for the first time."

It's neat and clean, service is fast, food is delicious, and it's around the corner from my house so 5 stars all the way around from me!!!\n\nI've actually been a fan of Archi's from the early 2000's when they only had their original location Archi's Thai Kitchen off of Torrey Pines and Flamingo.. moved away from Vegas for college and came back to find they have 3 total locations, Archi's Thai Kitchen in Spring Valley, Archi Thai Cafe in Summerlin and this location is Southwest Archi's Thai Bistro. I've been to all 3 locations and I have to say that Archi's is definitely one of my most favorite local Thai restaurants. I do know that the owners are from Vegas so I'm all for supporting local business!!\n\nI'm a huge fan of lots of the dishes here because they stick to traditional dishes, simple yet traditional plating, and true Thai spice level options (1-10). I love love love Thai sticky rice, especially to go with the Thai beef jerky!! Thai noodles are probably on the top of my list of favorite types of noodles! Pad See Ew and Pad Thai are my top favs and you can never go wrong when having these two dishes!! Papaya salad is always picked when I dine with my family as our salad option, and Panang Curry is the favorite choice of curry! \n\nArchi's also has great lunch special!! Their plum sweet and sour sauce I find savory and unique but not too far off the traditional path. I'm all for fusion style food places, but I guess I'm more of a tradition gal when it comes to certain styles of Asian food because of my upbringing.. and Thai food is definitely traditional preference for me! \n\nFood here is leveled on spices just right.. 10 level being Thai spicy. I'm in the 4-6 range, I like the kick in my mouth and a little bit of sweat on my brow.. but I like to still enjoy the food and not have my mouth on fire. I've never experienced terrible service, food comes always rather quickly, and never had a salty plate. Each Thai dish always is solid with the rich Thai spices and full flavor without it being salty. They also offer spice trays upon request to spice up your life or your mouth even more if they didn't add enough. \n\nThai food can be a bit on the oily side, but it's never swimming in oil. This location especially is very elegant in their furniture and atmosphere. Their lunch is always busy and packed and always professional individuals in suites always dining here during their lunch times so be prepared to wait during lunch or call in your food early.\n\nHighly recommend this Thai spot and support your local business owners and drop on in here for some authentic Thai cuisine!"

Several extra servings of rice, beers and crumpled sweaty napkins later, we conceded and affirmed the legitimacy of the chef's diabolical schemes.\n\nThe Thai tea also is less sweet than the competition, a plus for my poor blasted taste buds.

We both decided to keep it simple today and each ordered the chicken fried rice plate ($7.95 each). We also opted to grab an appetizer of chicken satays (also $7.95).\n\nThe service was just about flawless today! First we were served a cup of egg drop soup, which was pretty tasty! Next out was the chicken satays! Very thick and juicy, they were outstanding! We probably wouldn't have ordered the satays if we'd known the fried rice was going to be the heaping portion it was! I don't care much for vegetable egg rolls, but thats just so much personal taste.\n\nOur drinks never even got close to the halfway mark before they were refilled! The waitress was really on top of it!\n\nWe are going to be moving to the area soon so we will 100% certainly be back!

They checked up on us if everything was alright and refilled our drinks without asking-- definite plus!\n\nOrdered Thai tea, came in a pretty huge glass. NICE they're not stingy! Unlike Thai places in LA: where it comes in a skinny glass with more ice than Thai tea! And speaking of not being stingy-- rice was free!\n\nWe ordered: beef pan ang, spicy pork basil, and chicken pad Thai. Everything was a thumbs up except.... The beef pan ang, that was mehhhh.. The beef was over cooked and tough. I like tender beef, flavorful and easy to chew on. Cooks may have cut corners and used already cooked beef...I'll have to try this place again but around 7pm, maybe the beef will be cooked better. \n\nAlso there was a party of 3 that came in right at 9:30 pm (kitchen is closed). They still welcomed them, so I don't know where the bad service is coming from. \n\nOverall I recommend this place. Good service, good food, and theyre not stingy (4 boxes of leftovers). Definitely cheaper than Pin Kaow by like 2 bucks."

The nice lady on the phone told me my order would be ready in 15 minutes, although she did ask me twice to make sure I was aware I was calling the Rainbow Blvd location. I arrive about 12 minutes later and I see the waiter bringing my order to the counter. Perfect timing. Paid the bill and was on my way. Note: I was there on a Sunday around 12:15pm and only about 2-3 tables were being used. Kinda empty for prime time lunch.\n\nAfter going to Archi's, I ran another errand and then finally headed home. When I opened the boxes, the yummy goodies were staring at me wondering what took so long. I ordered:\n\n1. Pad See Ew - Stir fried wide rice noodles with Chinese broccoli and Thai soy sauce. Choice of meat included chicken, pork, or beef.\n\nWOW. This dish was really tasteful. The noodles were perfect. Soft yet with a crisp of crunchiness. I chose the pork and it was sliced and tender. I got it with a 5 on the spicy scale and it had a nice kick without being overbearing. I would definitely order this again. For sure.\n\n2. Fried Rice - Stir fried rice with tomatoes, onion, green onion, and egg. Comes with a choice of meats (chicken, pork, or beef)\n\nThis dish was also good. I wouldn't say its the best dish ever, but I would probably order this again after trying a few other dishes. The rice had good texture and it wasn't dry or oily. Good portions of meat as well.\n\nI definitely preferred the Pad See Ew over the Fried Rice, but I'm not against ordering the Fried Rice again. I recommend trying this place.

Couldn't take it back as it was a \"to-go\" order, so by the time we got the whole order home, it's a done deal.\n---The noodles on the pad thai tasted old.\n---They forgot the ice coffee I ordered, which was only included after I reminded them.\n\nReasons for the 2 stars:\n--Staff was friendly.\n--Pineapple fried rice was good and tasty.\n\nI would probably try another Thai place before going back to this one."

If you're in the area, that's a pretty good way to start your day!\n\nWe both love Thai food, and when it's our first time at a restaurant, we order our favorite dishes to see how they stack up: shrimp pad thai for me and beef pad see ew for him. Although my pad thai was too sweet for my husband's tastes, that's the way I like it. The portion was huge, and the ingredients were in perfect balance. The beef pad see ew was good, too; among the best my husband has had. They used Chinese broccoli, which is always better than the more common florets, and the beef was tender, not chewy.\n\nWe also split an order of egg rolls, which were fine but unmemorable. And I had a glass of the house Riesling, which was a little sweet as Rieslings go but a good match for my spicy entree. Service was fine but a bit slow, but since we were in no hurry to get anywhere, that was no problem for us.\n\nNext time we're up for a float, I think we will float on over to Archi's for lunch. And by the looks of their weekday lunch specials (10 tasty selections, each with soup and egg roll), I think I'll try for a Friday next time out!"

Our orders were taken and when the food came out everything was well with the archi food world again. i also must add that it was brought out in a promptly manner so we weren't waiting for almost an hour again. YAY! most of us ordered our food at spice set at 6, but we all agreed it was a lot stronger than last time. i'm not complaining though. i opted for something different from my normal pad see ew though and got the red curry with veggies. i don't know why i haven't gone back to that dish in a year, but it needs to happen more often. everything was so flavorful and they gave me so many veggies! i was pleased. they did forget to bring out Dan's thai tea though. maybe next time he can get his fix. I up'd the stars, but i want to go back one more time soon to make sure the service is still improving from last time. I will keep you guys posted!"

We had the spicy eggplant with fried tofu, shrimp pad thai, chicken satay and (2) orders of sticky rice. I left to run an arrand and came back 15 minutes later with the food just coming out of the kitchen steaming hot. First impressions of the restaurant inside is beautiful- very calm, with faint traditional music playing and quality furnishing and decor. I'd definitely come back for a nice relaxing meal out. \n\nAs for the food- delicious! The pad thai was plentiful with a good amount of shrimp and it wasn't greasy like it can be at other Thai joints. The chicken satay was very tender, flavorful and came with a coconut milk-peanut sauce and the requisite pickled cucumber and onions which were good too. Spicy eggplant was tasty and it wasn't overcooked. Even the servings of sticky rice were good and it wasn't overcooked. All in all, it was good food prepared well and quickly. \n\nOnly gripe was that the serving of chicken satay was a tad smaller than  other restaurants and they only gave one box of plain rice to accompany the meal- most places issue one box per dish even if you do order sticky rice (we had 2-3 dishes, technically). Still, a delicious meal that was definitely enjoyed."

I was always trying to call to place a to go order (about 3-4 separate occasions) and they would never pick up. Apparently you have to do it online which is perfectly fine with me, but what about those who do not have internet? I ordered online and I got a call probably about 5 minutes later. They wanted to tell me that the prices online were incorrect and that it would be an extra 4 bucks total. I said it was fine because I was totally craving Thai. I was a bit peeved though since they had this whole order thing online that their prices were not correct. They should have offered me the price that was shown online regardless. However, I'm sure they have fixed this problem by now...I assume as this was about a month ago. \n\nWe decided to come here for dinner on Saturday after the mall. We ordered the Beef Pineapple Fried Rice and the Chicken Pad Thai. The fried rice was delicious but too spicy for me. I've become some kind of wuss with spiciness now only because it burns my stomach. The pad thai was a huge mistake. A soggy mess of noodles. There was way too much tamarind sauce and the noodles were overcooked.  Service was attentive, but bring a sweater ladies...its freezing in there. Overall, Archi's is a decent Thai place, but it's definitely not my favorite anymore."

Each day of the week the lunch specials have their own designated soup, I prefer to go on Fridays when it comes with the chicken tom kha soup (chicken, coconut milk, lemongrass, cabbage, & mushroom). I like that I can choose my food's spice level from 1-10. Remember to save room for the coconut ice cream with warm, sweet sticky rice. My only criticism is that there are 3 locations and they are not equal. The Flamingo location is very small and feels run down. The Sahara location is closed on Tuesdays, has EXTREMELY slow service, and serves sodas in cans with a glass of ice so they can charge you for each one. Not cool, the other locations offer free refills. My advice is to go to the Rainbow location. Another helpful tip, if you're going for lunch, either go at 11am when they open or wait until after 1pm. If you go between 11:30-12:30 the line is almost always out the door with at least a 30 minute wait."

If you can't handle spicy get a 1 or 2. \n\nI liked my friends curry fried rice. Heavy on the lemongrass flavor and not the traditional curry taste but I enjoyed the flavor.  My pad kee mow was good. I got it with ground chicken cause the meat is a lot more moist then the chicken slices. I liked it a lot except for one thing. It had lettuce in it. I've never had roman lettuce in noodle dish before. It was uncooked and on the bottom of the plate, hidden to make my dish look bigger and more bountiful. I had to pick it all out. It's weird.

I live much closer to Archi's Bistro and got the thai bug we decided to check it out. I browsed the menu online and it looked pretty good and quite reasonable. Curries and entrees were advertised as being in the $8-11 range, but when we sat down and saw the menu they had pasted higher prices over the old ones so it was actually $10-15. We ordered a Tom Yum Koon(soup), Panang Curry, Basil Chicken, and a flat noodle and veggie dish I can't remember the name of. The soup was okay, but the broth was watery and the shrimp were overcooked and a bit rubbery. The thai basil had ground chicken which is very strange ingredient choice for a $15 entree, and was also quite a small portion. The panang was okay but waaay to greasy and oily the sauce was broken and kind of cold. The flat noodle was kind of like a chow fun with basil and green bell peppers, this was the best dish we had even though I said no meat and they gave us chicken for an extra $2. The staff was pretty much all high school kids from what I could tell, polite but hardly professional for what they are charging for run of the mill thai food. I was and am very disappointed in my fellow yelpers for rating this place so highly. I will never be back even for take out. There are places that are just as good for much less money, and places that are much better for the same prices. Don't waste your time and money, just make a reservation at Lotus of Siam..."

They have a few locations now since I first discovered them roughly 10 years ago and their S. Rainbow location is their \"fancier\" one. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and I can't wait to back for another dose of their Pad Thai dish. Also, their Tom Yum soup is one of the best I've had so far."

Oops!! \n\nI started going to the original location on flamingo which is and which will still be a hole in the wall IMHO.... The first time I ate there, I loved it!!! But as I moved further away it kind of got hard for me go there. \n\nSo when I found out that this location was opening.... I was ecstatic!! :) :) :) of course this was years ago!! Lol and I have faithfully been going to this location since it is just down the street to me. \n\nI'll start of with the bad and end with the good. And trust me it's not even that bad. Parking can be a hassle at times when it's busy. But it's not under their control.... I'm just mentioning it so that ppl are aware. \n\nService here is a hit or miss! Sometimes they are all over it and sometimes they are not present at all and I have to flag someone down just to get my water refilled. :( so service for me is not great. Service (2/5)\n\nAtmosphere is nice. Much nicer then the original on Flamingo. Lol but it is getting a little run down...(4/5)\n\nFinally now for the finale.... The food!!! :)\nIf u get a chance come for their lunch specials. It's a great deal. I've gotten the pad Thai lunch special and with the salad... Egg roll... Soup.... I always have leftovers.\nI've had their papaya salad.... Which is delicious! The papaya is always fresh and crunchy and it is seasoned perfectly. I ask for a 10 and in all the times I've gotten this dish, probably like 30...40 times over the past few years... It's been a 10 once. Which is disappointing but they normally give it to me at like 7 which is still decent. (4.5/5)\nTheir Thai spring roll is good. If u like Chinese sausage this is delish!! It tastes really fresh with the bean sprouts and cucumbers in it.(4/5)\nChicken fried rice is your normal fried rice. It's good but nothing really stands out from it. (4/5)\nPad Thai... Is always good. The noodles have the perfect texture and the flavor is always balanced. (4.5/5)\nPad Kee Mow... Is da bomb!!! I love love this dish. The first time I had it... I thought that it was delicious and I've never looked back. Lol the flavor of the basil is there through the dish but not overpowering... Well... It is really balanced. (5/5) I've gotten this dish numerous times and it's always been always perfect!!\n\nI will definitely be back. :)."
