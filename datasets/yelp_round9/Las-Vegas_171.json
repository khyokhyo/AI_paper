            "review": "Chefs Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger are the creators of the Border Grill restaurant. The first restaurant was located on Melrose Avenue and in 1990, moved to its current home on 4th Street in Santa Monica. Since then, Border Grill has expanded to Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino (1999) and The Forum Shops at Caesars (2014).\n\nWe were staying at the Nobu Hotel in Caesar's Palace, and decided to have a late 9:00 pm dinner at the Forum Shops location.  It is not located in the heart of the mall, but closer to the Strip, next to Joe's Seafood, where the spiral escalators are located.\n\nIf you use the Yelp app, you can get a free Blanca Margarita, an $11 value, just for checking in.  In addition, if you sign up for the VIP club, you can get complimentary appetizers, dessert and 15% off the check.  In addition, Border Grill is a supporter of #NoKidHungry, and for the entire month of September they are donating $1 from every Roasted Tomato and Bacon Guacamole purchased at Border Grill and Border Grill Trucks.\n\nEven though it was 9:00, we were still not very hungry and decided to share the Border Classic appetizer and the chicken poblano enchilada plate.  The appetizer plate had 2 green corn tamales, 2 quinoa fritters and 2 plantain empanadas. The enchilada plate came with 3 per order, but the restaurant was kind enough to split the entree for us.  Very thoughtful. \n\nThe dinner was exactly what we needed, and, since we were VIP, we were given a small sorbet for dessert, which cleansed our palate and was a perfect ending to a great meal.  After all the applied discounts, our bill came to $31 before tax and tip.... truly a great bargain on the Las Vegas strip!"

I ordered the Sangria and my mom had one of their Margaritas (only $5 each). I got the chicken and carnitas tacos and she ordered a fish taco. My Sangria was a little too sweet but I tried her Marg and it was really good. The tacos were decent too. They're small street taco size so you can definitely order several, especially at $3 a pop. Our total bill came out to about $20. Our server was great and on top of it too. \n\nIt definitely wasn't the best Mexican food I've ever had but for an affordable happy hour with reasonable food and good margs, I would definitely recommend it. I'm not sure if it gets busy during peak season but we had no problem getting a table in the bar."

Tamales were excellent, actually addicting.  Complimentary chips and 3 salsas were very good as well.

This location is much easier to get to than Mandalay, provided you enter from the strip. \nI did brunch with my bff Saturday morning. Chris was our waitress and was AMAZING!!

When the waiter came over to greet us he recommended the homemade guacamole which was amazing, and he furthered what the hostess had told me about the quesadilla and he recommended the steak which is the actual one they won an award for. We both order that and it was everything and more the steak was prepared perfectly just a great meal overall great service absolutely will go back next time in Vegas. The one thing I didn't try was the monster size margarita but I seen it being passed around at other tables next time I'll start with that"

I have a lot of friends with food allergies, and I have two myself. That is something that I wish all restaurants asked!\n\nBoth times I have been for brunch, I've left full for the rest of the day. You must order the $34.99 unlimited small plates. Share with your friends, try new things. The menu does change up. There are some staples I've seen both times: the breakfast fries, the churro tots....\n\nBottomless mimosas in multiple flavors are $10. Cannot bet that on the strip. Plus, you can take your mimosas to go. Once you've paid...get one more round and go shopping. \n\nThe atmosphere is fun. The waiters are a lot of fun. Will keep coming back."

It was by far one of the best meals that we had on our LV/Sedona trip and I am a dedicated foodie.\n\nI was very surprised when our waitress explained that out of the 12 or so items that were listed, tapas style, we could order any we wanted, as much as we wanted, for as long as we could eat!?!?!\n\nThis is the same as going to a buffet, but completely different! The dishes are not only prepared for you fresh when ordered (not sitting around like in a buffet) but the executive chef has come up with some amazing renditions that taste ridiculous. Not all are 10/10 you may have to settle for 9/10 and 8/10 but most were simply amazing.\n\nI really felt like we were ripping the place off. Anywhere in LV else it would have easily cost 3 to 4 times for the quality, presentation, and overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, as I mentioned above, I am a foodie, so knowing that I may not be back, I had to try a lot of the dishes, leaving me feeling way too stuffed but super happy :)\n\nI write this review 4 weeks later and I still remember the Benedict, the steak and eggs, the Chile relleno, and the tamale (not the traditional one), the shrimp and grits (we ordered it twice), and the super fresh ceviche. Crazy good.\n\nWHAT A FIND! Anyone coming to LV would be nuts not to come here for a great meal (believe me I don't sing restaurant's praises very often).\n\nThank you guys for making this place what it is."

I was familiar with the name and know about the celeb chefs that created this chain so I figured i might be in for a treat. In all honesty, its a step above El Torito. \n\nThey started off the dinner by bringing out some chips and 3 different types of salsa. The salsas were not bad but not spicy enough for me. But I have a very high spicy tolerance so cant really fairly rank the salsas. Not bad though. with my Yelp check I got a free blanco margarita. Pretty average margarita and glad I got it for free, as the price for this drink was $11 and it was not worth $11 by any means. \n\nTo eat I ordered the Pork Carnitas.. Pork Carnitas???? Kind of an oxymoron because carnitas are always pork.  When you see Carnitas on a menu that automatically registers that it is pork. Theres no such thing as beef or chicken carnitas right? I'm mexican so I like to think I know what I'm talking about in this matter. Anyways, I ordered those and they came with a couple of corn tortillas plus rice and beans. The carnitas were fine. not going to win any awards. Rice and beans were average. Tortillas could have been hotter and heated up over an open flame to give them that burnt flavor that I love. Like I said at the beginning of this review. A step above El Torito. That pretty much describes this place in a nutshell. And at the cost of $24 not worth the price. But that applies to pretty much anyplace in vegas."

We were super excited to have some Mexican food at a place that is so highly rated.\n\nMan - were we wrong and disappointed!!\n\nService: We were seated promptly and our waitress seemed friendly.  No issues so far.  We ordered our drinks and an order of guacamole for the table. We ordered our food (more on this disaster later), and started chatting.  After 20 minutes, our waitress stopped by to see if everything was ok.  We asked her what happened to our guacamole, and she said \"Oh no - I forgot...sorry\".  Yup - we knew she had forgotten.  \n\nFood:\n3 out of 4 of us ordered the following:\nBLACK BEAN & CORN ESQUITE SALAD\nbaby bibb | chipotle aioli | corn tortilla strips | panela | avocado 12\n\n****WARNING******\n- This salad appears to be vegetarian on the menu (check the description above), but came with a big piece of chicken on the top.  Our waitress confirmed this was vegetarian, we saw no mention of chicken on the menu, and here comes a big piece of chicken. When we asked the manager about this, he completely ignored the question and said that he would get the salad re-made.  Of course you will, but where does it say chicken on your menu?  No answer.\n\n- This salad is $12 on the menu, but we were charged $18 on our bill.  Seriously???\n********\n\nThis salad is awful.  There is a big piece of green covered with big chunks of cheese, corn, black beans, and very very spice dressing.  The dressing was so spicy, that I could barely eat 2-3 spoons.\n\nDuring this whole process of our orders being messed up, our waitress didnt come over once.  She knew the order was messed up, knew she had told us the salad was vegetarian, but not once did she come by, apologize, and asked if we needed anything.  She just stayed at a safe distance.\n\nWe did not finish our food, left the salad as is, and told the manager about our disappointed.  He did not charge us for the salad, but that's besides the point.  Maybe the tacos, or other things on the menu are great as the Yelp reviews look amazing.  But our experience was terrible....both in terms of service and the food.\n\nThere is a plethora of restaurants at The Ceasars, so next time I am at Ceasars, I will avoid this one and go to the other restaurants."

For such a highly reviewed restaurant, I was surprised how poorly executed some of the dishes were.  \n\nThe service staff was polite and attentive but needs more training.  It may seem like a small issue but, at these prices I expect to eat my soup with a soup spoon, not a teaspoon.   I brought it to the attention of the staff, but did not want to seem precious, and did not make a big deal of it. \n\nThe salsas were OK.  The highlight in my opinion was the tomatillo salsa. The arbol lacked heat and the chipotle had a muted taste of something. Perhaps garlic?  Anyway, not my favorite. \n\nThe shrimp gazpacho was good. A solid dish.  Fresh and simple, I enjoyed it. \n\nThe ribeye was a disaster. The meat was overcooked with one side obviously cooked longer than the other.  It seemed that the person minding the grill forgot about it for a couple of minutes then served it anyway. \nThe chilaquiles under the meat were too greasy and soggy and did not let the flavor of the meat shine. I think this would have been helped by putting them to one side  and letting the cut of meat speak for itself. That said, I personally thought the meat was under seasoned. \n\nI was conflicted about the flan. The texture was thicker than I expect from flan. I have had flan many times from many countries and this was the thickest consistency  I have had. Just shy of extra firm tofu. The flavor was good.  Not too sweet... And the berry on the side were a nice touch.   \n\nDecor was beautiful and pleasant. \n\nAll in all though, I would not go back. For $50 on a restaurant week prix fixe I would have expected more from the food. Other dishes may be much better but I would have thought they would have highlighted their stuff for Restaurant week."

My boyfriend and I had eaten at the other Vegas location in Mandalay Bay 6 months ago and had such an amazing meal, decided to try this location.\n\nThe service was awful and the food unmemorable.  We waited 25 minutes for our drinks when finally one of our friends had to get up and find out when they'd be bringing out our drink order.  They did bring appetizers on the house as compensation but the food was just all bland.  I had the steak tacos and the meat was disgustingly chewy.  \n\nSo disappointed and as someone who really values food, was frustrated that I had raved about Border Grill to our party and we all thought it was awful."

If you're coming from a different casino, walk down the strip to the Forum Shops entrance and skip the trek through the inside of Caesars. \n\nService is great. The decor is very nice, but not over the top. You definitely feel welcomed and conformable here. \n\nThe menu is a little small compared to most Mexican places and it's a little different than the usual \"taco and burrito\" Mexican restaurant. That being said, I've come here with many people, and everyone found something on the menu that they loved. Oh - the enchiladas (all of them), are amazing. The oysters were pretty good too, the iced toppings were a pleasant surprise. \n\nVery reasonably priced for the location."

I came with a group of 6 on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. \n\nPROS:\n\nAmbiance: Very spacious, clean, modern and beautifully decorated. \n\nService: 5 star service! Our waitress was amazing. She was very friendly, made wonderful suggestions and was very attentive. \n\nFood: Our group opted for the unlimited small plates for $34.99. Since we had a larger party, our waitress told us that she would bring a variety of the more popular dishes in more generous potions so all of us could sample a bite. The food was extremely fresh and flavorful. \n\n-Peruvian Shrimp & Grits: This was my favorite dish! I am not a big fan of grits due to the texture of it. Their grits were very flavorful and soft (mashed potato like consistency). The shrimps were huge and perfectly cooked. It was also drenched in the most amazing sauce. Must try!\n\n-Ceviche Del Dia: Fresh ingredients. The lime juices gave everything an extra kick. \n\n- Breakfast Fries: My group first picked on the outside, then we discovered that there was braised beef in the middle which made this dish 10x better. The beef was very tender complimenting the crunchiness of the fries and oozing egg yoke from the egg. \n\n-Steak & Eggs: The steak was cooked perfectly. The hash browns could have been a tad crunchier but it was still good. \n\n-Esquite Lettuce Wraps: Great use of all the fresh ingredients. The chipotle aioli was perfect, not too strong but not too bland either. \n\n-Yucatan Eggs Benedict: The perfectly cooked egg and the pork was very flavorful. \n\n-Pigs in a Blanket: The flakiness of the puff pastry went very well with the chorizo. \n\n-Chili Relleno: Great flavor. The spiciness of the chili slowly creeps up on you!\n\n-Shrimp Relleno Tacos: Lightly battered shrimp. The avocado cream was on point. \n\nCONS: \n\n-Green corn tamales: Not a big fan. It was too sweet and too mushy. \n\n-Tres Leches French Toast: Too soggy and sweet for my taste.\n\n-Churro donuts: A bit too soft \n\nOverall, $34.99 is not bad at all for the amount and different variety of food that the offer. I highly recommend!"

My girlfriends and I came here for lunch after a long typical Las Vegas evening of good clean fun and and we stumbled upon Border Grill while we were, errr, stumbling through the Forum Shops. Yummy, authentic Mexican food sounded like just the cure for...our good clean fun. \n\nBut I digress. \n\nWe shared a few dishes to start. The queso fundido was incredible and cheeeeeeesy. I could put that on anything. We also shared the ceviche which was super fresh and tasty. \n\nI ordered the crispy potato rajas and let everyone try a little bit. This was hands down the best main dish. Paired it with the blood orange lemonade and you have yourself a meal.\n\nThe ambiance was super cute and I love the decor. Good meal for groups and casual while still keeping it somewhat classy. I need a Border Grill in the NYC area asap please!!!"

I love how we were drooling over her food on TV, and then be able to dine at her restaurant located a few blocked away. That's another beauty of Vegas - almost every celebrity chef has a restaurant here! This one is located in Caesar's Palace.\n\nIt was really empty on Sunday around dinnertime. We were seated immediately and were served chips right away along with 3 different types of salsa. I'm not a huge chips and salsa person, but those chips were too addicting. We ordered guacamole and their famous ceviche to share. For entree, I got carne asada tacos, and for drinks, a free house margarita with Yelp check-in! What a deal!\n\nGuacamole: Delicious, with huge chucks of avocado. Really fresh and bright flavors. You know how you're supposed to eat chips with a side of guac? Well I was eating more guac with a side of chips. Literally eating the guac with my fork and just sprinkled some chips on top.\n\nCeviche: I don't remember the name of the one we got, but it was on their specials menu. It had giant pieces of prawn in there, along with tomatoes, cucumber, and mango. Light and refreshing. It came with only 3 pita crisps, so we used chips again to dip the rest. I would come back to try the rest of their ceviches! \n\nCarne Asada Tacos: The meat was a bit on the dry side, so I was a little disappointed. But nothing extra guac can't fix! Comes with a side of black beans and two different flavored rices. I tasted tomato in one, and either cilantro or spinach in the other, but both were good. \n\nOur waitress was really nice. She made recommendations, checked up on us regularly, and even told us stories of Mary Sue and Susan Feniger coming into the restaurant."

We told her about Paul's corn allergy and she made sure to inform us when corn was used in the dish. She also would substitute flour tortillas for corn which was great.\n\nWe also got the bottomless mimosas and I loved every flavor they had to offer! (They had 5-6 flavors?)

It started out well - got our sodas and chips right away. We ordered the queso for an appetizer and despite not having enough tortillas to dip, it was phenomenal. But this is where it started to go downhill quickly. We waited, and waited, and waited for our entrees. Our waiter Charles never came back to our table, a large group and in his mind a bigger tip capturing his attention. After an hour passing from the time we sat down, I finally had to leave to make an appointment at the Apple Store, so I told my husband to have my entree boxed up and I'd eat it at home. You can imagine my surprise when I walked to the Apple Store, had them fix my iPhone, and still, an hour later, hadn't heard from my husband. I called him to find out he and our kids had JUST LEFT the restaurant. They continued to wait after I left, finally got the food from a different server, ate it and were disappointed to realize the food wasn't worth the wait, and finally had a couple sitting next to them take pity on them and ask THEIR waiter to close out our check since 25 minutes had passed since the food had arrived and no one had ever come back. I went back and expressed my displeasure with the supervisor on duty, who was very nice and apologized but didn't do much more than say, \"I'm really sorry this happened.\" Needless to say, we won't be back and will tell our friends not to waste their time either. Pretty sad too, because I often entertain clients for work and am always looking for new restaurants to bring them to, but Border Grill will not be one of them."

We were promptly seated and greeted by the bus person with chips and salsa.  He went over each salsa with us.  The server was professional and pleasant.  The bus person never let our chips or glass go empty.   \nThe food was also excellent.  My 9 year old loves tortilla soup and if a restaurant has it he has tried it.  He ranked theirs at the top.  My wife had the potato tacos which she described as very flavorful and crisp.  I had the short rib enchiladas.  The sauce on the enchiladas was fresh made not from a can.  It had the right amount of heat and was very flavorful.  The enchiladas themselves were packed with short rib and excellent.  My only complaint for $27.00 for three enchiladas there shouldn't be an extra charge to add rice or beans.  \nI am glad we tried it and next time we are in town it will be a dinner stop for us."

Very accommodating to food allergies, everything is made in house and from scratch! \n\nIn house chefs, and delicious unique drink selection. The salsas are a tasty variety of 3 different kinds served with chips just to start. It is ABSOLUTELY worth every penny!! The flavors are delicate and plentiful, which mix beautifully!! \n\nTruly no words for how delicious and wonderful the food blends, mixed with an attentive waiting staff and polite hostesses. They truly understand their customer. I would hands down recommend this to anyone and everyone. You CANNOT go wrong. I rarely give such a review but they are entirely deserving based on their phenomenal attention to detail in every aspect.\n\nI have recently been back 2 years later and the same AMAZING service AND food. Unforgettable! Sincerely the best kept secret on the strip! If I could I would live off this establishment's food."

We ordered barbecue brisket flautas, cumin grilled skirt steak, and pablano chicken enchiladas. I was able to try a bit of everything. The flautas were enough to eat as a dinner meal for one. They had a great smokey flavor, a hint of spice, and were deliciously crunchy from being deep fried. The grilled steak was cooked perfectly medium well, the cumin based rub was very flavorful, and paired well with the accompanying arugula salad and sweet corn. The enchiladas were fabulous I probably could have licked my plate clean. The pablano enchilada sauce had a beautiful deep green color and the perfect amount of heat. They were stuffed full of moist chicken and the sweet corn relish on top added a perfect sweetness to balance the dish. I wish we had ordered something from the ceviche bar everything looked great. I'm rating Border Grill 4 stars because I felt like the overall atmosphere was lacking a bit and I am disappointed the chile relleno with goat cheese was not on the menu. But, if you are craving Mexican food made with quality ingredients while in the Forum Shoppes this is a great choice, just be prepared to spend a little extra moolah."

Super nice servers and other waitstaff - very friendly and efficient. Myself and one of my friends also spent the $10 more for bottomless mimosas. They have many juice options to choose from that I've never had. We tried watermelon, pomegranate, prickly pear and blood orange. The blood orange and watermelon were probably my favorite!\n\nTo begin they bring you out some banana bread and empanadas with a jelly inside along with some sweet cream cheese. The banana bread and cream cheese combo is delicious!\n\nAs far as the brunch food goes, we got it family style for our table. A favorite at our table were definitely the bbq sliders, we ended up getting two plates of those. My other favorites were the biscuits with chorizo gravy and cauliflower taquitos. Really you could order one of everything on the menu if you wanted since it's endless plates, but believe me you'll get full! I wish I took some pictures but I was too busy eating :)\n\nThe guac here is also great - even though it's not on the brunch menu we heard we had to order it and our waitress switched it out as one of the brunch plates so we didn't get charged any extra. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone staying at Mandalay Bay or nearby!"

It means something when I call this the single worst restaurant in Vegas.\n\nThe food is awful and uncharacteristic of Border Grill, it forced my dining companion and I to try the Mandalay Bay location on another evening just to compare.  This location has a serious problem.\n\nPeruvian Ceviche - excessively tight and chewy pieces of fishy mahi mahi with ginger, lime, chili and DISTILLED VINEGAR.  The vinegar had an acidic bite so pronounced it masked all other flavors while accentuating the aroma of the fish.  Exact opposite of the vibrant, refreshing, tart flavor at the other location.\n\nRoasted Beets - extremely bitter thanks to burnt pepper coating the surface of the beets.  The bitterness overpowers everything else in the dish.\n\nShort Rib Enchiladas - Supposedly topped with a chayote, watercress slaw as presented by the other location, this one was simply sauced.  Very dry, dense, finely pulled short ribs on the inside.  Obviously premade, refrigerated, and poorly reheated.  Very one dimensional in flavor.\n\nSpecial Fish of the Day - Spice rubbed then blackened (an understatement).  A quote from my dining companion \"This taste like I licked the burnt inside top of a Webber grill\".  Inedible.  \n\nThe kick in the nuts, the manager on duty's cocky response that his employees all liked the dishes before walking away.  (He sent our server to apologize for him and comp the meal).\n\nFinding the good; warm ambiance, very good servers (excludes the manager), well made cocktails.  Unfortunately that doesn't cut it in a city with so many incredible dining options.  \n\nA failure of a restaurant and one that will definitely bring down the reputation of Border Grill as an enterprise.\n\nAvoid."

I enjoyed everything from the home-made guac to the soup (not too heavy, not too light) that the server reccomended.\n\nService - My server Alex (with glasses) was friendly, engaging, and had dead-on reccomendations.  He was prompt when I needed service, and left me alone when I wanted to eat and focus.   5 star service, really!\n\nEnvironment - Just right for a Mexican place in a casino.

Then I got to enjoy lightly salted fresh chips with 3 types of fresh salsa (green, smoky red, and a slightly spicy red). I ordered the grilled fish tacos. They're served on fresh white corn tortillas with a jicama slaw, grapefruit, and avocado and are topped with a chimole sauce. The tortillas were soft, the fish was charred perfectly, and the play between the crunch of the slaw, sweetness of the grapefruit and creaminess of the avocado worked so well. Finally, the chimole sauce (made from roasted peppers) was salty, smoky, and sweet at the same time. I'm short, this meal was the culinary highlight of my vacation."

I don't know why but he was extremely difficult to even get any attention from at all, despite there only being 5 tables in use (2 weren't even his). He was great to a table of 4 young women but actually seemed to go out of his way to go around us rather than checking in to see if we needed anything. I really think it had to do with the fact that we only ordered water to drink at first. The tables he was more attentive to were buying multiple drinks from the bar. Maybe he just saw that we wouldn't be a big ticket table? I don't know. \n\nThe busboy was fabulous and far more pleasant, despite being treated like crap by the waiter (I saw and heard our waiter berate the bus boy for not moving fast enough...)\n\nWe ordered the guacamole, which was quite good. I ordered the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas, and they were...weird. I literally needed a steak knife to cut them, but I couldn't flag the waiter down to request that, so I had to muscle through them with a butter knife. The tortillas were a really strange texture, almost like a taquito, but not fried properly so instead of being crispy they were just very, very tough and chewy. I've eaten and cooked a TON of Mexican food and I've never encountered that preparation before. And it was just very salty. \n\nMy husband had grilled fish tacos and he was not very impressed. \n\nThis place is too pricey, the waiter was too rude, and the food was nothing special.

The food was fantastic, the drinks were amazing and were were very satisfied when we left.  We had the happy hour margaritas that were so incredibly good! They are made with agave and were wonderful!  We also had the chicken quesadilla and we cannot wait to go back and have that again!  The street tacos were so yummy as well!  A lot of flavor for not a whole lot of money!  Since we've been back home we keep talking about how good the their food was. This is the place to go to in Las Vegas!"

Ordered a few items based on bartender recommendations - pineapple vanilla margarita -- they infuse pineapples and vanilla into tequila - it was ok! Ordered the fish tacos - also a recommendation. And it was fine. Three little tacos that are overstuffed with avocados, vegetables, and some fish. I asked for some cheese to give it a little more flavor. They were a bit dry. Roasted cauliflower was also just average. You can't do much with that but I would prefer they cut up the cauliflower a bit more! This place is average at best."

We had lunch there today and were not disappointed.  The new space is clean and stylish, and though you will pay more than you would for taco truck or mission burrito fare, you really can't compare these beautiful and sublime plates to the mexican street food we are all used to.  We shared the carne asada nachos and the chicken poblano enchiladas.  Every bite popped with flavor and texture, the seasonings were spot on, and we kept eating long after we were full simply because the food was so delicious.  Can't wait to go back and try some other food next time we are in town, maybe next time we will cozy up at the ceviche bar?"

My girlfriend who was visiting from Chicago & I headed there for lunch & we were not disappointed at all. I don't remember what she ordered but since I mostly eat vegetarian/vegan I ordered the potato tacos (they had a fancier name but basically they were potato tacos). They came with beans & different Mexican rices which were plain tasting which was actually good because it was a nice balance with the tacos which were FLAVOR PACKED. I ended up taking home half of the meal because I was full very quickly. A lot of flavor overload but in a good way. Definitely not a place for someone on a diet but if you just want to enjoy your vacation or lunch out on the Strip then YES! very delicious. Guac & dips were yummy too. Waitresses were very nice, easy access to (large!) bathroom, & chill ambiance. Price was about $15 which is fairly standard for The Strip dining. It's not somewhere I'd go everyday but on the occasion that I'm at the Caesar's Palace I would definitely revisit this place & I would also order the same thing! :-)"

We sent it back. Got a little 'tude, but I think our waitress tried it (at the bar) and realized it was pretty bad. So she had a fresh one made. Seriously tho'. If you're going to offer a drink like that for free, then don't have an offer at all. It really doesn't start you off on a good note, you know? \n\nI like the Mandalay Bay location better, but it's nice that this one is an alternate location and more centrally located. Like the chips and trio of salsas. \n\nTip: for $3 per person, you can buy a 1/2 off your entree discount at the halfpricetickets box offices. Considering our entrees were $39 each, it's worth it."

Having eaten there a few times already, it was a perfect central location for our small group.\n\nThe brunch menu offers a great assortment of \"small plates\" options for the table to share.  They start off with some wonderful pastries including their guava empanada and a fresh fruit plate.\n\nWith larger groups, the server will bring out an assortment of items for you.   Alex was awesome and very accommodating.  We enjoyed quite an assortment from the menu - the huevos rancheros is always great, fried green tomatillos (which can be ordered without the bacon), steak and eggs, oysters rockefeller, and breakfast fries (also available vegetarian).  The back and jalapeno PBJ is a great way to end the meal!  Add on the unlimited mimosas for an additional $10 per person, and you are set for a great experience.  Yes, they are very attentive with beverages, too, so you won't get dry!\n\nI LOVE this venue and encourage you to try it out.  For parking, there is a convenient valet off of the Strip near the Planet Hollywood Restaurant sign near Forum Shops.  You can also self park in the Colosseum Garage and walk across the Casino, out the doors between Fizz and the Colosseum to bypass the long trek through Forum Shops.\n\nThey get my \"A\" rating for terrific service (have yet to have a bad experience for six visits), consistently great food, and great value.\n\nThey also have a terrific happy hour and private space for larger groups."

If you're going here from the front desk, this will be a bit of a trek, but that's totally okay because it works up that appetite, so you can devour even more food. It's worth finding. \n\nSecond, the decor: it is just the right blend of casual and classy. I felt comfortable here, and I enjoyed the fact that the glasses and light boxes were Mary Sue's husband's design. \n\nThird, the service: their staff is incredibly attentive and friendly. They were accommodating and efficient. \n\nFinally, the food: the variety of salsas is always welcome. I love being able to try each one and find your favorite. Personally, I love the spicier one that can be brought out when requested. The chile relleno burger is incredibly messy, but it is such a unique burger and an incredibly good one. The only complaints we could find with it were that we wish the chile relleno was a little bigger, and the burger wasn't quite as smashed down. But that being said, you really can't complain too much -- it's quality food. The carne asada quesadilla is fantastic. It's flavorful, and a lunch that could last me the rest of the day. The corazon lemonade is incredibly. Easily the best I have ever had. You can just tell that the quality of their ingredients is higher than most anywhere. The juices are hand-squeezed. The meats are antibiotic and hormone free. Most everything, including tortillas, is made in house. This is the real deal. So, if you find the prices to be a little high, consider how much work the staff puts in to make quite literally everything on your table and the natural ingredients that each item is made from. \n\nUltimately, this is a great restaurant. Mary Sue Miliken and Susan Feniger are women I have watched on Top Chef and the Food Network time and time again, and this is a great opportunity to try their food. These women also entrusted the right person in choosing Jennifer Holley as their general manager. She has done an incredible job at opening this location."

You are a great example of how you can save a poorly-executed meal with good service.\n\nWe had a party of 10. Pre-dinner drinks were wonderful -- great mojitos, margaritas, tequilas and IPAs. Appetizers come out quickly, and tasty. Good stuff, especially the ceviches and the guac.\n\nMeals came out all at once. Not sure how it happened, but 1 of them came out room temparature and 4 of them came out cold, including a steak that was extremely rare (red bordering on purple inside). Alex apologized profusely and was able to get the dishes fixed and/or refired, but it took quite a while, so we weren't eating at the same time. He spent a lot of time apologizing and trying to make it right. He brought the GM out, comped 4 of our entrees, and comped us some desserts.\n\nThe food itself was terrific. Duck breast mole was wonderful, as was the seafood stew, the short rib enchiladas, the achiote-roasted pork. Everyone enjoyed the meal, just not the process.\n\nNot sure why food came out cold. Place was only 1/3 full, although there was a big private party in the back. Maybe the kitchen just got hammered or lost their focus.\n\nSo 5 stars for service, 4.5 stars for food and 1 star for the kitchen."

Upon entering, they asked if we would like a table or if we would prefer to sit at the ceviche bar. Ceviche? Bar? Don't mind if I do. \n\nAfter scanning the menu, we decided on a couple of appetizery things (places to go, other things to eat): the queso fundido and the smoked mussel ceviche. We also had some of an autumn-spiced white sangria our server recommended (delicious!) \n\nWe loved the queso fundido, full of chorizo and delightfully melted manchego. However, the ceviche was absolutely the highlight here. I'd never had a preparation quite like this. The slight spicyness with the smoky mussel flavor and sweetness from the mangoes came together perfectly. I want more!\n\nAnd a funny story, while enjoying our ceviche we were approached by someone I later figured out was Mary Sue Milliken. She was entirely too excited that we were sitting at the ceviche bar, because she loved the idea but was disappointed that not a lot of people sat there. She decided we needed to try a couple of the raw oysters, so she had the guy working the ceviche bar make some for us. They were, indeed, wonderful, and not just because they were free.\n\nBorder Grill will definitely be a part of future Vegas excursions for us, and for you as well."

Our reservation was for 11:30 but some of us arrived earlier and we were seated early in a comfortable half booth/half table.  \n\nAs others note, the brunch deal at Border Grill is pretty good (by Vegas standards):  for $35 you get unlimited small plates from a list of about 15 or so.  For an extra $10 you get the bottomless mimosas, with flavors well beyond the typical OJ.  Our servers were fantastic.  To begin, when we ordered a dish instead of preparing a single serving of each dish for each diner, they would have a larger order of the dish prepared for the table.  So, we got 4 shrimp and grits on one plate instead of 1 or 2.  Made the table less crowded with fewer plates.  Also, we were brought more mimosas on a fairly regular basis.  There was never a time when I had an empty glass until the end of the meal.  Fantastic service.\n\nOf the small plates, I tried:  french toast, brisket sliders, pigs in a blanket, plantain empanadas, steak and egg, shrimp and grits, churro tots, serrano ham waffles, breakfast fries, and chicken tamales.  There is so much, I could go back and have a fantastic meal with just the items I didn't try this time.  My favorites were the steak and egg, shrimp and grits, and breakfast fries.  The steak and egg is not a large portion, but it's larger than I was expecting given that it's a small plate brunch.  The steak was cooked properly every time we ordered it, and the egg is appropriately runny.  It's served with some hash browns which could have been crispier, but overall, it was my favorite dish.\n\nThe shrimp and grits were strong as well.  The grits are smooth and seasoned well, and the shrimp is not overcooked.  We ordered several rounds of this as well.  The breakfast fries are enormous, nothing small about this plate.  They are topped with all of your breakfast favorites.  We only needed one for the table, but it was great.\n\nNothing was a miss for me, but the pigs in a blanket were too dry for me, the serrano ham waffle didn't have much ham flavor (but it still tasted like a waffle, so that's good), and the bun on the sliders was too hard.  But, these aren't huge issues, and certainly not reasons to skip brunch at Border Grill.\n\nI am not a big mimosa (or brunch drinks in general really) guy, but these were strong.  Passionfruit, pomegranate, and other flavors beyond the typical offerings.  They were refreshing and had a nice mix of booze to juice.  And, as I noted earlier, they were brought to our table with great frequency.\n\nBefore we knew it, we had been at Border Grill for 2 hours.  You don't realize how quickly the time passes.  It was a great, easy brunch and they really take care of you.  I will absolutely do this again on future trips to Vegas."

We were going to go with the short Rib enchiladas that I saw everyone raving about on Yelp, but he steered us to the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas instead with green sauce and shitake mushrooms. Awesome! Definitely a sleeper pick here. \n\nHe also recommended I try the fresh squeezed watermelon lemonade and boy what a treat coming in from the Vegas heat. I also tried the carnitas which were moist and tasty, but didn't wow like the chicken Poblano enchiladas. \n\nThe place is probably more expensive than your local mexican place, but considering where you are and how expensive everything else is, it's worth it."

The location of Border Grill is really easy to get to, even though it is in a huge complex at Caesar's Palace Forum Shops.  Border Grill is conveniently located on the bottom floor of the shops right off of the Strip, but it was still fun to shop around the many stores before heading here to eat.  \n\nOur server was very nice and attentive. She quickly brought us out chips and salsa, which was all very good.  I ordered the steak nachos which were delicious and a very good portion.  My only complaint is price, but at a place in Vegas and especially at the Forum Shops I was not shocked that the food here is a little more expensive.  They do have a limited menu, so there weren't too many choices to choose from.  \n\nThe restaurant was clean, and even though it is a smaller space we did not have any trouble getting right in at 4pm on a Sunday afternoon.  Overall, I would highly recommend the steak nachos and don't forget to get your free margarita!!!"

Sucked that Happy Hour ended exactly as we walked in at 6 but we decided to stay and try the place out nonetheless. Wife and I were a bit leary after noticing the crazy Vegas prices for a plate but we soon got over it. The server, Kimberly, was very kind and attentive so service was exemplary. The food... that is the best part. We had the cheese dip... awesome. The chips and salsa are good. And we split the chicken enchiladas. It is hearty and good enough to share with your wife! The meat was cooked nicely and was quality. And the sauces are tasty. The corn kernels are roasted and sweet. I was very pleasantly surprised with this restaurant. I highly recommend it.  Next time I'd want to get here in time for happy hour!"

We sampled several of the small plates and the two that stood out the most were the steak and eggs and the serrano ham waffle. They were just phenomenal. We also had five mimosas each-they went down very easily! \n\nAll of the staff members were great. It was a really hot day in Vegas and they kept our waters filled and made sure we had what we needed. Even the manager came by to see if we needed anything and to ask how our meal was. \n\nWe were able to save 15% thanks to the check in offer, which made the experience even better. This meal was the highlight of our trip. I always wanted to do a fun brunch and now I can finally say I did it!"

I did have some chicken enchiladas that were very good and I'd have them again but think next time we'll go back to the one at Mandalay Bay. We always order the guacamole and while it was tasty, it also wasn't as good as the restaurant down the street.\n\nOne of the things that made our experience less positive was the person who showed us to our table.  Believe he was the manager and asked if we'd been there before.  When we said no but we generally ate at the one up the strip, he said oh, he'd be back to see how his compared.  Now the place wasn't that busy but we never saw him again. guess he didn't really care.  He also mentioned that one of the owner/chefs was there and when I said I'd love to meet her and give her a compliment, he said he'd make sure she stopped by, that didn't happen either.

            "review": "Two of us started 2015 off with a special New Year's Day brunch at Border Grill normally offered only on weekends.  Offered our choice of any table becasue we were the first people there, we chose to sit on the indoor patio along the Forum Shops. It was also well lighted for better photos.  It's always fun to watch tourists.  \n\nWe started with two complimentary guava empanadas and a bowl of fresh fruit before ordering.\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered (descriptions from their menu):\n\nYucatan egg Benedict - manchego cheese biscuit, achiote roasted pork, avocado crema, hollandaise, pickled onions (2 orders)\n\nGreen corn tamales - sweet corn, salsa fresca, sour cream (1 order)\n\nFried green tomatillos - triple cream brie, hominy grits, spicy romesco, smoked chile hollandaise, pepper bacon  (1 order)\n\nBacon jalape\u00f1o PBJ - housemade peanut butter and grape jelly, crispy bacon, over easy egg, jalape\u00f1o  (2 orders)\n\nChicken and waffle - blue corn waffle, mango habanero coulis, spiced fried chicken, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche  (2 orders)\n\nPeruvian shrimp and grits - aji panca salsa, roasted green chile, creamy parmesan grits (1 order)\n\nRed velvet Johnny cakes - ancho chocolate shavings, candied pecans, wild berry syrup, vanilla cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (1 order)\n\nEgg white oysters Rockefeller - seasonal tempura oyster, creamed spinach, crispy bacon, spicy tomato chutney (1 order)\n\nHuevos rancheros - black bean panucho, ranchero salsa, sunny side egg, tomatillo relish, serrano chantilly (1 order)\n\nBreakfast fries - beer braised short rib, chipotle hollandaise, applewood smoked bacon, over easy egg (1 order)\n\nChurro tots - dulce de leche infused churros, cinnamon sugar, cajeta (1 order)\n\nCapirotada French toast - bourbon maple syrup, walnuts, ancho cherry marmalade, goat cheese crema (1 order)\n\nRice pudding - shortbread cookie, br\u00fbl\u00e9ed banana slices (1 order)\n\nThe Border Grill brunch is an all you can eat menu with a cost of $34.99.  We ordered two dishes at a time and they were generally brought out at the same time or close to each other.  Where it's indicated 2 orders, we each got one.  Neither one of us repeated any dishes and we didn't share except for the churro tots and the rice pudding--a $9.00 up charge because it's not one of the brunch dishes which total 16.\n\nMy favorites were: Yucatan egg Benedict, fried green tomatillos, bacon jalape\u00f1o PBJ, shrimp and grits, chicken and waffle, churro tots, and rice pudding--basically everything I ordered.  The chicken and waffle was quite deceptive.  At first, I thought the mango habanero coulis was too sweet until I got a slice of habanero and the rest of the habanero flavor kicked in.  No longer sweet, it was a tasty, zingy dish.  The shrimp and grits were very good as was the bacon jalape\u00f1o PBJ.  The peanut butter was excellent and with the jelly and bacon, the biscuit had a very flavorful counterpoint.\n\nFinishing off, the churro tots were good but the rice pudding was exceptional.  The pudding is well worth the up charge.  The portion is huge--easily shared--and it's a great finish to a wonderful brunch. \n\nService except for one blip was exceptional.  Coffee was not refilled.  New cups of coffee were brought to replace empty or almost empty cups.  Someone was around often changing the coffee cups and adding water to our glasses.  The general manager, Jennifer, came early to introduce herself and welcome us to Border Grill.  She explained some of the designing done by Feniger/Milliken or their families, and we talked about the way some of their dishes are made.  Jennifer stopped at almost every table while we were there to make sure guests were satisfied or had any questions.\n\nA good start to the new year and I hope the harbinger of many such fine meals."

After speaking with my lovely waitress Connie, she said that the happy hour menu had just changed today but the PR team didn't make any of the changes.

It was also the size of my palm and it was ok\n\nMushroom tinga quesadilla- marinated mushrooms in a quesadilla with oaxacan cheese, guajillo sauce and blue corn tortilla- this was delicious. Full of flavor\n\nService\nMy waitress Connie was lovely! Very attentive and she felt horribly about the false happy hour advertising.\n\nMy only recommendation would be that when they bring out the chips and three salsas that they explain each sauce and what they are."

My rice was on the toothsome side not sure if it's intentional or not but I prefer a full cooked rice. Tried my friends seafood ceviche and came as a pretty decent portion and it was pretty good. Also tried my friends fish tacos and it was interesting.. I think there was some cucumber in there instead of the typical slaw. My other friend got the shrimp dish.

I came with a party of 6 and half of us received the free margarita upon check in.  The margarita came before my glass of water - odd.  We were given the entree menus and were a bit hurried about ordering by the waitress.  We ordered.  After the order was placed, one of us in the party inquired out the cerviche bar we spotted when we walked in.  The waitress said they have a menu for it if we wanted it along with nightly specials.  It would have been nice if we were informed this before we were rushed to order because the specials looked a lot better than the boring menu options we chose from.  We all discussed how disappointed we were that the waitress didn't provide this simple duty and we guessed she might have heard us as she went MIA for most of our dinner.\nFood comes and still not impressed.  I ordered the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas and it lacked something.  It was edible but not work the price or its place permanently on the menu.  \nAgain, our waitress was so poor that we all wished the other guy was our server.  \nWhen walking out of a restaurant in Vegas, you want to feel like a million bucks.

And different as well.  Using a Chile Relleno for a topping was a stroke of genius since it added a spicy, crunchy, gooey-cheese enhancement to the well-cooked burger.  I would recommend giving this burger a try.  And it came with fries as a bonus.\n\nAs for the location, it's located at the entrance of the Forum Shops where the escalators are in the the former P.J. Clarke's space.  The layout is essentially the same with the bar in the back of the restaurant and patio out in front which is great for people watching.\n\nIn terms of which Border Grill I think is better, I'd say the edge goes to the Mandalay Bay since it has that almost beachfront feel to it with their patio being outside near the Mandalay Bay Pool.  Nevertheless, both locations are worth visiting and have almost identical menus including their famous Border Brunch."

We liked the place so much we went back the next night!\n\nEverything is great from start (the chips and dips) to finish (the exotic ice cream flavors). Appetizers come in generous portions. And the ceviches have a healthy assortment of fresh veggies.\n\nI also have to echo another post here which praised the GM. She's keeping close watch to make sure everything is top notch.\n\nSo stop debating whether or not to go. Just do it! You'll be glad you did."

Much like the first time I discovered 99 cent pizza in NYC (and realized it was actually good), I did a serious double take when I saw the prices.\n\nAs you would in any Mexican restaurant, start with chips and salsa. Free.\nMove on to a tamale or two or three or seven. Hot, delicious, fresh. $1.\nOrder one of the tacos, or order all three. $2 each. Brisket was the favorite, but they were all good.\n\nClassic beers on the menu, but we went with margaritas and sangria - both definitely worth getting. I'm a big fan of good sangria, so I remember having two or three while we were here. Big glasses, extremely aggressive prices.\n\nWe ate and drank for almost an hour, and the bill was no more than $15.\n\nCrazy. Well worth it."

All were amazing but our favorites were Tres leches French toast (this was heaven in my mouth), pigs in a blanket, Peruvian shrimp and grits, yucatan eggs benedict, chile relleno (we ordered 3) and ceviche del dia. The service was amazing, and very thorough in respecting the food allergies of my friend.  Honestly, one of the best brunch experiences of my life.  Strongly hope and wish they open a Border Grill in my hometown (Portland, OR).  I'll be talking about this brunch for a long time to come, and I'm kinda sad it's over.  It was so good we slow clapped for the waitress the food was so good.  Adrienne was our waitress--we're in love with her--amazing service & such a professional."

The second time I got tacos. The carne asada was ok and the shrimp was fishy tasting. The guacamole is good, but nothing amazing. The ceviche was good.

Bacchanal's 2+ hr line just didn't work out for us since we were trying to catch a show. \n\nSo very pleasantly surprised with our choice.\n\nThey start you off with fresh homemade chips and 3 types of salsa, all very good but my favorite is probably the green 1; also got talked into the guacamole which was a really good choice( no this item came toward the end of the meal which was a little annoying). We got the Baja shrimp ceviche(a little bit sweeter than regular shrimp) and I have to say that's probably the best ceviche I've ever had anywhere including Mexico, the short rib enchiladas which are to die for, & a perfect desert with the sweet corn tamales for those that don't like their sweets too sweet. \n\nGot a few other items in our party but those are the ones I remember the most, only weird part is that appetizers don't seem to come when appetizers should, along with entrees and other stuff. Everything's a little bit all over the place.\n\nDefinitely a must try, so glad to have found out they have one back home in LA. All their flavors to all their dishes are like a party/club in your mouth!!!  can't wait to come again!"

We watch Food Network, love the ladies who created the restaurant and have even tried to recreate the 'Ciudad Chicken' dish after watching \"Best Thing I Ever Made\". \n\nWe ordered the appetizer \"Queso Fundido\" and at 1st blush it looked delish. Not so.  The homemade chorizo was dry and tasteless and the Manchego cheese mixture needed salt or acid or something.  It certainly did not taste of Modelo beer which was much described by the server.  We ate the appetizer with little fanfare...\n\nFor dinner we both ordered tacos. One order of carne asada and one order of fish tacos. \n\n1) Steak - tasteless and chewy and ultimate sent back to the kitchen. \n\n2) Fish -  larger chunk of avocado on each taco than actual fish. We didn't send these back as we chalked it up to a preference thing, but in all honesty these tacos were completely off putting.  \n\n3) Ciudad Chicken (replacement for the sent-back steak tacos at substantially higher cost) - chicken breast completely dry and no sign of the pickled\ntomatoes that were both on the menu and were also the highlight of our home version of this dish.  Completely underwhelmed by this replacement dish. \n\nIn the end the only people who lost out were the server, Matthew, who was wonderful and tried to make things right. The food just was not good and he price was too high and no compensation or acknowledgment of the fact that we really didn't eat anything. \n\nThis experience COMPLETELY disappointed and nearly ruined our final night in Las Vegas.  Thank goodness for the show \"Absinthe,\" also at Caesar's, which lifted our spirits!\n\nBorder Grill at Caesar's Palace is to be avoided despite any positive reviews you read here!"

Walked a little further from Joe's and my eyes lit up when I saw Border Grill.  I've been wanting to try the location in Downtown LA for brunch and lucky for me it was 1:15pm and I still had time to partake in the $35 unlimited small plates brunch.  Woohoo! I loved the idea of small plates, almost like a buffet but everything was made to order and we could share amongst the table.  Everything was pretty delicious, except I would have to say the weaker dishes were the pigs in a blanket and the lettuce cups.  My favorites were the tamales and the steak and eggs.  Each dish was quite creative and a pretty decent size.  If you are eating alone, it might be a bit harder to try everything on their small plates brunch menu.  It's nice to have their brunch in a group setting because you get the opportunity to try everything and then know what you want to narrow in on if you want seconds.  The churro dessert was a little disappointing, I wish it had more of a crunch, I think texture-wise it would have made a huge difference, hopefully that one gets re-created soon.  Service was really kind and our waters were frequently being refilled.  Saw that there was also $10 bottomless mimosas and wished I could have some of that.  Considering the circumstance, I figured I'd save that for next time.  I'll definitely be back, really enjoyed our dining experience at Border Grill."

Prompt, fun, and spot on with descriptions and recommendations.  Didn't hurt getting us a free app for being repeat customers.  Seviche here is top notch in my opinion.  No bad options yet.  So very fresh.  This time I had the chicken enchaladas.  I'm not really an enchilada fan but these were very well prepared and flavorful.  Better half had the skirt steak.  Very tender and seasoned well.  Made ourselves sample a dessert and tried the rice pudding.  I thought I'd just sit and watch the better half enjoy it bit was so tasty I had to jump in.  Fun, clean atmosphere with fresh and tasty choices.  Give them a try.  Note:  first Forum Shops entrance when coming from Mirage."

We ordered the Carne Asada Quesadilla and the Chicken Torta lunch special. The quesadilla was huge. Lots of food but great flavor with cheese, Mexican crema, pico de gallo and guacamole. The Chicken Torta was also huge and came with fries. Seriously the best Torta I've ever had. The chicken was moist and had carmelized onions, avocado, chipotle mayo sauce, bacon. I would highly recommend. Food is a little pricey, typical for Vegas, but the flavors in their dishes are suburb. Plus you will have plenty of leftovers!!"

Each taco plate is $14-$19 and comes with 3 tacos, and a good portion of beans and two types of rice.

It's not a traditional buffet brunch; the dishes are made to order and they bring them out as they are prepared. Two of us ordered about 10 small plates and shared them all. It was great to try a number of dishes and everything we had was fantastic. My favorites were the yogurt parfait, chile relleno, plantain empanada, tamales, and French toast. Everything we ordered was really great though. This was a great choice over the larger buffet options in Vegas, as the quality of the food was very good. I will definitely be back for brunch when I return to Las Vegas."

Let me tell you first off this restaurant is at least a mile from the lobby. it is tucked in the far end of Caesars Palace and took forever to get too.\n\nOnce we got there we were famished and went straight in to the Guacamole and the salsa and chips. The Guac was one of the best renditions I've had and the chips were the original double cut mexico tortilla chips. The 3 Salas were complex and flavorful and we killed the whole thing.\n\nMy wife ordered the $16 chicken quesadilla which was diaapointing and I ordered the 3 taco (mini) combo. The Carne Asada was grass fed which I liked but it was covered in a garlicky sauteed spinach which killed it in a bad way. The ensenada fried fish taco was epic and the grilled fish taco was really good as well. The beans and rice were nothing special but I was still full from the Guacamole. \n\nThe service was a 10 and would definielty come back to get the Guac and try some ceviches."

Try the Veggy Tamale!\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Check-in on Yelp for free white margaritas.\n\nVERDICT: A pretty good, last-minute alternative; I definitely recommend if you are in the Forum Shops in Vegas!\n\n---------Experience/Venue:\nCame here with a small group of 4 as a last minute dinner decision for our last night in Vegas since we found out too late that our other destination (Bacchanal Buffet) requires a few hours wait. Of course, we still tried our luck with Bacchanal, but it was a 45 minute wait around 4:45ish on a Sunday. So instead, we ended up here in Border Grill around 6:30 - and we were glad! Unlike Bacchanal, it was not crowded and we were seated immediately. Our waitress was very hospitable and helped us with recommendations. \n\n---------Food:\nOur food came within 15 minutes which is good since we had to rush to the airport afterwards. We ordered the following:\n\n- Border Guacamole (hass avocado, jalape\u00f1o, lime [9.50]): Not bad, but nothing to brag about. Although, at the center piece it comes with one big chip (and the rest of the chips are provided in a separate bowl).\n- Crispy Potato Rajas Tacos (creamy potatoes, fire roasted chiles, mexican cheeses, guacamole, charred corn relish, chipotle crema [14]): Crispy and flavorful!\n- Baja Ceviche (mexican white shrimp, sustainable catch of the day, tomato, jalape\u00f1o aioli, corn tostada [15]): Yum, yum, yum!! So flavorful! \n- Seasonal Vegetable Tamale (huitlacoche masa, melted leeks, panela cheese, roasted seasonal vegetables [14]): Very tasty! My favorite that night!\n- Grilled Fish Tacos (jicama radish slaw, avocado, grapefruit, chimole [19]): I haven't yet found fish tacos that I liked, and this one didn't change my mind. (I think I should just avoid fish tacos altogether).\n- Blanco Margarita (tequila blanco, agave nectar, fresh lime [44, but we were comped due to our Yelp check-in]): Very sweet, almost like lemonade, so I'm glad this was free because it was very weak, or rather, perhaps it makes sense that it was weak because it was free."

However, if there was one place to open a restaurant where the rich can blow some cash on expensive tacos, Vegas is the city to do it. While Border Grill has a pretty well-known weekend brunch, their ceviche bar is also a big draw. \n\nWhile I'm sure all the waiters are trained to push the border guacamole as a tableside show and appetizer, it felt a little too Chili's to me. There were three ceviches to choose from and I figured the closest one to being local, the Baja, would be the freshest. Unfortunately, there was a metallic aftertaste. Hopefully, it wasn't the taste of mercury poisoning and we won't get Jeremy Pivened. \n\nFor entrees, we tried the quesadillas and tacos. At first look, they may seem overpriced, and they still very well could be. But, I have to admit that most ingredients for quesadillas and tacos at these types of restaurants are haphazardly thrown together. The hope is that the overcooked meat is covered up by the melted cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. But, I found the citrus grilled chicken to be juicy and tender. The grilled fish tacos were great as well - I loved the substitution of grapefruit as the acidic component. \n\nThe portions are pretty large and the service was excellent. The drinks were refreshing and went great with the meal. If they still have the coconut mojito, it's a must try."

Only $10 for bottomless and you can switch up the fresh juice mixers too, DO IT!\n\nUnlimited Mexican breakfast tapas-- my favorite were the shrimp & grits and oysters rockerfeller.

Made reservations for 10 people. \n\nThe food and drinks themselves were good, but the service was extremely extremely slow. It sort of killed the party vibe, as we were waiting 15+ minutes for the first round of drinks. There was no reason, as the restaurant wasn't even busy. Our meals also came out late...2 of which the orders were incorrect. \n\nOverall, I was disappointed with the level of service we received, from the RBF hostess, to our server....The restaurant definitely failed to make her night special. I wouldn't recommend this place for a special event."

Started out with the sparkling blood orange lemonade, which was super tasty!  Would make a fabulous cocktail if vodka or rum was added. ;)\n\nThe chips and salsa were deeeeeee-lish.  And we're from San Diego, home of some of the best.  Loved that they gave us 3 salsas to try!  And loved the fresh-cut, hot chips!\n\nI ordered the crispy potato rajas tacos and my hubby got the Yucatan pork.  Both were pretty amazing.  I loved that his came on little soft-fried tortillas and had picked onions on them.  But mine were the show stealer.  I'm definitely not a vegetarian, but they sounded interesting, so I took a chance.  Glad I did - the filling was amazing.  The contrast between the crunchy outside and the creamy inside was on point!  Sooooo good.\n\nThe only reason I had to take a 1/2 star off was for the beans and rice on our plates.  At first I was excited to have both red and green rice, but upon trying them I was very disappointed.  They were both undercooked and virtually flavorless.  The beans were also bland, and were almost cold.  Totally not a deal breaker, because our meals came with 3 tacos, and we had plenty of chips to fill us up.  But, being a Susan Feniger restaurant, I would expect a half decent side dish on my plate.\n\nAll in all, we will totally be back.  I think next time for dinner, so we can try all the cocktails!  :)"

I made a lunch reservation and everything for the Sunday we flew in.\n\nOur server was super nice and explained how everything worked. 3 tapas at a time, if I'm remembering right. And of course, as much as we want. \n\nMy brother's a vegetarian, so we tried to make sure we ordered a lot he could eat too - which wasn't a problem with their extensive tapas menu. \n\nThey also brought out some sweet empanadas, banana bread, and cinnamon butter. Oh man!!!\n\nMy favorite dish was the breakfast fries which had bacon, egg, cheese, and a bunch of other tasty stuff on it.  I also loved the tomatillos - actually that rivaled the fries. My mom liked the fish tacos which had different kinds of fish within a pepper within a small tortilla. However, we found one of the two we ordered was actually very spicy, and the other wasn't at all. My brother liked a dish that I can't remember what it was... it has sunny side up eggs and red sauce... ehh I don't know.\n\nIt was only $10 to add on bottomless mimosas. Hell yeah! And they had a ton of flavors to choose from! I tried like 3 different ones, but didn't want to get drunk in front of my family so I kept it at that.\n\nWe all left here full and happy, but I would LOVE to come back with my boyfriend or friends sometime."

Long story short: good food, great drinks, awesome people. \n\nWe originally stopped in to Border Grill to grab a drink before a dinner reservation elsewhere. Great drinks - my favorite is the blood orange jalapeno margarita - at not too terrible prices, especially at Forum Shops/Caesars. (Folks who complain about how much Vegas costs have no concept of it being Vegas. You think they built this glittery spot on cheap food and winners? Go off-Strip if you want the cheap stuff.) A few days later, my coworker says she'd like Mexican for dinner, and I immediately thought of Border Grill. It's a nice relaxed spot, the menu looked good, and I still had that spicy margarita on the brain. We shared an order of guacamole and I had carne asada tacos; they were both delish. We shut the place down, finishing out the meal with drinks. A couple of days after that, I am stressed because I'm now stranded, and I need a relaxed spot with a good drink. Duh, Border Grill. This time, it's more margaritas and chicken poblano enchiladas. They aren't giant portions, but it's plenty and it's good Tex-Mex food. Still stranded, I made my fourth appearance tonight for drinks (mas margaritas, por favor), but it's really because of how awesome some of the people at Border Grill have been.\n\nTo that point, my most sincere thanks to Dylan, Luis, Matt, and Betty. Dylan - my bartender and guide to all things yummy at Border Grill. He did not miss on a recommendation and is a really great guy, despite what his coworkers say about him. Luis and Matt - Dylan's partners in crime behind the bar - were great for laughs and just chatting to this random chick who had taken up residence at the bar (me). Betty - the manager - super sweet and concerned about my being stranded. She offered up toiletries from a stash they had and even asked if I needed a place to wash clothes. I can't say enough about how nice they all were to me this week - they could have been weirded out that I kept coming back, or they could have treated me like every other tourist that stopped in. I'll definitely be back and will bring others with me."

I said \"ok...how about 3 cheese enchiladas?\"  She said, \"ok..we have 3 cheezes, what kind of sauce do you prefer...red or green?\" When I said I've no idea, she told my friend and I to have a seat at a table and she'd bring me some samples to taste so I that could choose.\n\nI mean really?  I've never had such customer service BEFORE ordering a meal.  \nTo cut to the chase.....my food (3 cheeze enchiladas with chicken filling, and my friends food (short rib enchiladas) were both outstanding.

The food and the experience was just as outstanding as our previous review.\nBe sure that you try the strawberry lemonade and the sorbet sampler for desert.\nDuring our dinner, we started chatting with the people sitting next to us and amazingly they lived near Chicago just like us.  We had a great time chatting.  I told that that my band, Bongo Straits, was playing the http://www.mondaynightcarshows.com on labor day so we invited them to come see/hear us play.  They did!

Absolutely delish and very creative with the toppings. The tortilla chips were nice and warm when they came out and the salsa trio was fresh and clean. I had the drink with the jalape\u00f1o infused tequila, watermelon juice and cucumber (can't remember the name) and it was completely refreshing.  Service was great! I'm a fan!"

We had wonderful food and an awesome waitress that never let our champagne glasses go empty!  Right from the start she took the lead in perfectly timed food and drink.  I recommend letting the server take the lead and bring you an assortment of small plates.  We joined the VIP Club and the Manager could not have been nicer!

He was an absolutely amazing server who took our time at The Border Grill to the next level. My husband played Menu Roulette and Randy nailed it with Chicken Poblano Enchiladas. Oh my goodness, DELICIOUS! Nice choice! My parents ordered the Carne Asada tacos and the tortilla soup. They were very happy. I had the Grilled Fish tacos and they were great! I will definitely be eating here again and definitely be ordering the Poblano Enchiladas."

I would say one of the first reasons we choose Border Grill was because of Christina, our event coordinator.  Christina was on the ball, and made the entire process as simple as could be.  She was a lot more helpful ad insightful than even that of our wedding planner.  We did work with Jennifer and Jill in the days leading up to our event, and they were both more than accommodating.  This seems to span the board at this establishment, as their employees all seem to exude the same type of mentality.  The customer is definitely number one here! \n\nWe actually grabbed some drinks here on the first visit, during happy hour, and their margarita was spot on!  The bartender made it to perfection.  On our second time through, we grabbed a drink and had a quick bite.  The fish tacos were delicious and once again the drinks were right on par.\n\nWhen it came time for our event, everything was taken care of.  We weren't left wanting for anything.  The staff did an amazing job getting the venue ready for our group, and they continued to go above and beyond throughout the event.\n\nI can not say enough about this place.  We will definitely be back next time we are in town!!!"

The three salsa selections were perfect with great flavors and just the right amount of heat.  The queso fundido with chorizo was heaven.  A scoop of that in the flour tortilla is a bite I'll remember for a long time.  We had the skirt steak and short rib enchiladas for entries.  The flavors, textures and sauces were incredible, and the skirt steak was cooked perfectly.  Finished off our feast with coffee and donuts, the donut being the best churro ever and the coffee being a wonderful espresso ice cream.  The place is difficult to get to but well worth the effort.

The fish tacos were small and extremely bland. Two of the four people who ordered them ate only 1 of the three tacos. The hangar steak was cooked right but really under seasoned - again, common response from those who had it.  Chips were good but the salsa was served in tiny little dishes with about 2 tablespoons each. No where near enough for a table our size. \n\nPerhaps it was because we went on a Sunday night - maybe their usual cooks and bartenders had the night off.

This is the closest thing you can get and it just so happens to originate from LA! I recently dined here during their Saturday brunch. They have an amazing brunch menu that serves up \"modern Mexican\" cuisine with unlimited small plates for $34.99/ person as well as Bottomless Mimosas for an additional $10. Worth every penny! If your appetite and group is big enough you can savor and taste all 16 dishes. Each dish provides enough for 2-3 people to sample. Dishes range from savory and sweet so you can capture the best of both worlds. Few highlights for me were the Chilaquiles, Churro Tots, Egg White Oyster Rockefeller, and The Bacon Jalepeno PBJ which is one of the most interesting dishes to try! Forgot to mention, the delightful sweet empanadas and fruit plate you get as an appetizer prior to getting your food served which was all quite superb! \n\nNot only do they have bottomless mimosas for $10 but they offer 5 different flavors! My favorite is called The Corazon, which is mixed with blood orange, passion fruit and orange juice. \n\nOur server was Perry and be did an amazing job making sure my glass of Mimosa was never empty and anticipated the right times to take our next batch of order. The food came out at a reasonable time! Overall experience was excellent! Brought me right back home, best feeling in the world!"

YMMV?\nHuevos Rancheros- average, fill up on other things\nGreen Corn Tamales- no, they aren't spicy\nChilaquiles Verde- sauce was too subtle, one of the few dishes we didn't finish\nTres Leches French Toast- pretty but the tres leches flavors were too subtle to matter\nChurro Tots- just okay but better without the weird salty chocolate sauce on the bottom.\n\nWhile I enjoyed my brunch because it was with great company and a few standout dishes, the experience would have been better with a few tweaks, starting with our odd seating in the back area in the dark, which made photos difficult. Dishes were oddly coursed and came out a bit slowly, refills had to be requested a couple of times, and we never did receive the shrimp relleno tacos.

This was unappetizing.\n\nSecond Course: Grilled Chicken and Mango Salad: This would've been a decent salad except for the dressing. I enjoyed the grilled chicken, slices of avocado and the seasoned dices of mango and slices of jicama, which added a kick to the salad. However, the menu noted that the dressing was a chile lime vinaigrette. Instead, the salad ingredients were tossed with a thick, honey mustard concoction that ended each bite I took with a tangy taste that lingered. \n\nThird Course: Flan De Coco:  I like my flan sweet, and this wasn't. The flan had a hint of coconut and had a creamy texture. The accompanying pineapple salsa was too sweet and didn't pair well with the flan. \n\nI won't be running back to the Border anytime soon."

I'm not really one for latin food so my enchiladas weren't my favorite, but I could tell it was very well made and would be enjoyable to anyone who likes latin food. Overall it was a great experience. The waitress was great and so was the service. It was also basically empty from about 5-7pm on a Sunday evening on spring break if I remember correctly. One small thing, the batch of sangria that we had was actually rather bitter, which was really the point being that it was border grill's take on the sangria recipe, so if you're looking for sweet sangria be cautious. It was also a bit noisy on the patio because of the acoustics in the atrium. Other than that it was a great experience and they even really encouraged us to leave feedback after we left.

This is a great idea for large groups as you can taste every single item on their brunch menu. Also, If you are tired of your regular orange juice mimosas they also offer champagne with pomegranate or passion fruit. I personally like sweet and fruity drinks so I enjoyed the passion fruit one the most. Must try dishes, the Chilaquiles, the chicken and waffles, the fried green tomatillos and steak and eggs.. Or if you can eat more just order one of each, at the end of the day every dish is unlimited! They also have two locations one at Caesars and one at Mandalay bay, both locations offer a nice atmosphere with good customer service! Must try, you will thank me!"

The deal is 35 for unlimited small plates and you can add on unlimited mimosas for another 10. We proceeded to sit there for 2 hours and get disgustingly full. \n\nThe table next to us somehow managed to hit every item on the menu, whereas we barely made it halfway. It would definitely help to bring more than a couple stomachs. The mimosas were good, although some were almost straight up champagne, which was great. There was just enough juice in them to not make it feel too boozy. \n\nOf the items we had, the standouts were the chorizo tacos, green corn tamales, shrimp and grits, and the chicken and waffles. The only real miss was the bacon pb&j, which might work for a different set of taste buds. They also started us off with sweet empanadas which were delicious but not on the brunch menu. \n\nThe best part of all of this was the service. We had Perry as our server, and let him choose the progression of plates that came out. He had a pinpoint sense of timing with our food and brought new rounds of mimosas before our glasses were empty. He also stressed that there was no rush and we could take as much time as we wanted. \n\nCan't think of a better way to brunch."

After searching for a nearby Mexican restaurant to grab a cocktail and an appetizer, we landed here based on positive reviews and celebrity chef - do not make the same mistake. Two decent margaritas and three entirely flavorless salsas in, we asked the waitress for a recommendation between the steak nachos and the queso. She RAVED about the queso. It arrived and I was optimistic about its appearance despite having just eaten three salsas that make mild Pace seem like a flavor explosion. First bite of queso and I couldn't tell if it was just my dulled-down taste buds so I asked for a second opinion and took another bite. Nope. It literally tasted like nothing despite being machengo topped with grilled poblanos and chorizo. The most interesting part about this is I had been texting with a friend who is a Vegas aficionado and was describing the experience and she GUESSED which restaurant it was based upon my description of the subpar, overpriced food. It pains me to write this review, but as a native Californian and Texas resident, I take Mexican/Tex-Mex seriously don't want anyone to make the same mistake. Check out Ca\u00f1onita in the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian instead."

It's like a buffet with all the choice, but all the freshness of a restaurant. And a buffet would cost about the same anyway. \n\nI think we literally tried everything on the brunch menu, but a few standouts were the steak and eggs, the crispy shell chorizo taco, the braised short rib on the fries, the bread pudding (YUM), and the steamed sweet corn. Everything was tasty, but we tried so many things it's hard to remember it all. \n\nService was excellent and the food came out quickly. But not so quickly that we felt like we were shoveling it in. We took our time and had a really lovely loooong brunch. I'm not sure how quickly I'd return because Las Vegas has so many options that I'd love to explore, but you really can't go wrong with eating at Border Grill.

I would have spent well over $100 for just two of us and got better service at Chili's... The sad thing was, they were not busy! However,  the saving grace was that the Manger came up to take care of our bill and she asked how everything was. I hesitated and she asked if there was a problem and so I proceeded to inform her of our experience. She was very nice and appreciated the feedback and was also kind enough to pay for our our drinks.

Anyway, after much fruitless wandering of the Forum Shops much like Moses in the desert, we finally made it.\n\nI started with a house margarita ($11, not bad for Vegas) and we shared queso fundido ($13) which was really good. I mean, you can't spell \"fundido\" without FUN, right? Their version includes chorizo and poblano strips and is quite tasty indeed.\n\nFor an entr\u00e9e I picked a chicken dish - basically it was roasted chicken on saffron rice and it was very good.

I didn't set the bar too high because I seen the spotty glasses and silverware.  Not a good sign when you walk in to a place. Hostesses seemed lost and we're more concerned with gossip than helping. We didn't expect for four star service but we did expect our server to see how we were on our cold food. But alas no one came by. I did flagged down a manager and notified them my food wasn't hot and he took it away but by this time my friends was cold as well, since she was polite and was waiting so we could eat together. After receiving our food hot, we never seen Hyde nor hare of our server or manager. Enough said. \n\nFood... well again a good attempt at trying. Not really mexican more tex mex, but it had always been that style. Guacamole was ok. Lacked salt and acid. The shorty enchiladas were ok, but too much sauce made the tortilla mushy. Rice was hard like it was in a steam table for hours. Beans were dry and not a lot of flavor either. \n\nOverall...maybe they are just getting their footing and I will be back in the near future to try again. I do miss the old border. Much more intimate with the chef and staff , but hinges do change. Hopefully it can get back to what BG was years ago."

The lettuce wrap had a chipotle aioli that was to die for.  Smokey with just a little hint of heat.  chilaquiles were delicious too.  Every plate was better than the last. They don't rush you either so you can sit for as long as you like.     They had a great deal of gluten free options too.  Our waiter Matt (?) was friendly and made some really good suggestions.

The restaurant wasn't busy when I arrived and I was greeted by my friendly server Alex.  We chatted a bit before he took my order.  I said, \"I'll have the shrimp tacos.\"  He replied, \"no, no you won't, you'll have the chicken pablano enchiladas.\"  Ummm, okay, I'm easy.  Good suggestion, this dish was amazing.  Fresh chips and three different salsas were brought to the table and they were really good too.\n\nWhen a restaurant is that good you have to have dessert, right?  I ordered the flan and it too was great.  It was wearing a lovely halo of candied sugar.  Hard to describe but really interesting and creative.  I took a photo but it doesn't do it justice.\n\nWill definitely return.  Saw some people eating a small plates brunch and that looked good so might have to try that next time.\n\nLook out Alex, I will be back soon.\n\nF.Y.I the restaurant is in the Forum Shoppes, lower level by the spiral elevator.  People kept telling me lower level, but darn I couldn't find any evidence of a lower level coming in from the casino."

On the cab ride the cabbie (who is by the way a retired NYPD lieutenant working 4 days a week now making $80+G/yr) gave us a small warning but it was too late to change our reservations. \n\nThere were 6 of us. The nice waitress gave us the rundown on the place; its background, its fresh and organic use of ingredients and its distilled and filtered water. Hmmm. We ordered the guac. It was delicious but the chips were delayed. After her recommendation we ordered the whole snapper Veracruz. Fried fish in a sauce with olives, tomatoes, peppers. It was \"ok\". I've eaten whole fried fish before and I was underwhelmed esp since she talked it up so much. My friend ordered rice, which was not on the menu and it was dry and horrible. Like it had been sitting there forever. He had to send it back. \n\nWe inquired about the ceviche bar. The waitress said the hostess must've forgotten to give us the extra menu. We had already ordered because we had a show to catch. But afterwards she brought us the menu and there were a few things that we wanted from, including the ceviche and some special tacos. Annoying.\n\nI was disappointed with my braised short rib tacos. Despite the sauce they seemed dry. There weren't very many people dining. Not a lively atmosphere. Decor was lab and dark. And the waitress was not very attentive. \n\nWhen we walked out to catch our show I saw the celebrity chef's pictures. Mary Sue milliken and Susan feniger. I loved them on top chef masters. Top chef is the only show I regularly watched. I can't believe they would put their names behind this type of poor quality. So disappointed."

The green tomatillo salsa was better than I remembered, even more addictive. The oysters were a briny slap in the face (and that's a compliment from a Bostonian...) and served with different granita toppings. The appetizer trio was solid; our previous favorite - the plantain empanadas - were off, but the rest were delicious. Our entrees were a shrimp relleno taco and the rib eye. The taco were incredibly complex with chili, huge shrimp and a topping of pickled vegetables. The rib eye was perfectly cooked and served with a delicious chimichurri. The star of the evening though was a side of roasted beets served over a carrot pur\u00e9e.  The mixture of beets each had individual flavor, a pleasant char and seasoned with cumin and lime (we think). \n\nOur server, Matthew, was fantastic. The restaurant was slammed after we arrived and he and the rest of the team hustled. He brought us out sorbets at the end of the meal - the mango was to die for."

I love options!\n\nGreen Corn Tamale - Very good! Slightly sweet tamale served with pico de gallo and sour cream. A good combination of both sweet and savory.\n\nYucatan Egg Benedict - very different from traditional eggs benedict, but delicious. They are served on a homemade corn biscuit and topped with shredded pork. Yum! \n\nMexican Rice pudding parfait - I love rice pudding! This wasn't the best I've had, but good. \n\nPlantain empanadas - These were good but probably my least favorite part of the meal. \n\nMachaca Chilaquiles - everyone at the table agreed that the chilaquiles were the best item we ordered. Very cheesy and flavorful.\n\nPeruvian Shrimp and Grits - another favorite. I loved the sauce! The grits were also quite tasty. \n\nGuava Empanadas - flaky and perfectly sweet. \n\nFruit - Fresh except for the strawberries. Slightly disappointing since strawberries are my favorite. It included honeydew, cantaloupe, strawberries and pineapple. \n\nBottomless Kinky Mimosa (passion fruit, pomegranate and blood orange) - yum! I'd never think to combine those flavors in one drink, but I approve!\n\nI would highly recommend checking this place out!"

I always appreciate when someone tells me what I should or should not order. \n\nWe also ordered the guacamole which was so good.  It came with a little salad with some sort of juice (lime). I appreciate when restaurants offer their own spin on a classic dish.  In regards to dinner, I ordered the chicken poblano enchiladas. They were amazing.  The tortillas were wrapped around the meat so tight which is cool. (I can never get my tortillas to do that at home -- amateur chef that I am).  The green sauce was great and was almost sweet but in a good way.  My one complaint is that there was so much sauce that I couldn't enjoy it without some chips.

They have pretty good service, decent guacamole, and my friend's scallops were great, just doused in sauce. Oh, and she ordered a blood orange margarita that was delicious!\n\nThe rest of our meal? Salsas are quite bland, the steak nachos were covered in some orange sauce that made my stomach do somersaults almost immediately...Strangely enough, the carne asada on our nachos was better then the carne asada plate we ordered. Also, I specifically asked what veggies came with the meal because they said we could substitute. The waitress told me squash and zucchini. Perfect! My friend and I both ordered the veggies. When our meals were served, she got the veggies and the ones on my plate were tomatoes and cucumber--more like a tiny Greek salad. I was highly annoyed. For dessert, I just ordered my toddler berries with whipped cream. The berries came in a bowl of a side dish--maybe a dozen total. The whipped cream was a side of creme fraiche. For a toddler. Really? She's two. \"Me no like it\" is what kept coming out of her mouth. \n\nLastly, the pricing. I paid $138 for two appetizers, two main courses, a tiny bowl of fruit, one alcoholic drink and two sodas--and only ate about 65% of the meal. Huge disappointment. What I'm more confused about is the pricing of the items. I understand it's Vegas and you pay for location. Seriously. I get it. But since when do scallops and shrimp have the same price as a quesadilla or enchiladas?? I'll admit, the quesadilla looked appetizing, but my soul wouldn't let me order it. Quesadillas are what we eat when we need to throw something together quick!\n\nI would not eat here again. I would rather spend more money and indulge my taste buds. I think most of us don't enjoy their meal when it's overpriced and below satisfactory. My bf barely finished the meal and in the words of our daughter said, \"me no like it.\""

The runner came out with water and chips, and that concluded the timely part of the service. We sat there for fifteen minutes and filled up on a whole lotta chips. We ordered the guacamole which was good, I personally prefer less lime in my sauce but I can see how somebody would like more. After discussing the menu items, evaluation of the probability of a downgrade of U.S. debt, outlining all of the eventualities of a default, and analysis of the political barriers towards a deal, the server took our drink orders. Her claim was that she had two sections to cover because somebody was out for the night. I am a little skeptical since there were several servers working and a management call to simply give one person two sections seems unreasonable. \n\nThe food, however, was outstanding like the last time I was here. The server upsold me on the tuna tartare on chips as an appetizer; delicious, but the tuna ought to be cut into fine pieces - I had to take the tuna down in one hefty bite. My other complaint is that $14 for two loaded chips is comparable to my earlier experience at T&T, needless to say, not the best deal. I had the short ribs as an entree, it was mixed in a smoky and sweet cayenne sauce over a bed of corn polenta, I definitely didn't leave hungry nor unsatisfied. I also tried my friend's quesadilla, the blue cheese and mushrooms are a nice twist on a staple dish. The tres leches cake was decent, not too interesting, but alright if you need to finish on a sweet note."

Then the last two times we have been there the food has been terrible.  I mean completely awful. Soggy fish, undercooked, cold food.  The only reason that I would give it two stars is because both times our servers were outstanding.  I don't know if they have a different chef, or what the case may be, but I certainly would not waste any time, or money, going there. Truly a disappointment."

I've never been to any of the ones in Los Angeles, but supposedly (according to my fellow Yelper, Cori G.) the Vegas one is far superior. \n\nWe came here for lunch after driving all day and I had peeked at the menu ahead of time so I was already prepared to order the Baja ceviche. The waiter then informed me that if I wanted, I could order all three or mix two different ones together which was intriguing. I opted for just the one but I think next time I will have to try all three because I was totally blown away by the Baja one. It was bright and acidic with lots of onion and delicious tender chunks of fish and shrimp. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about those tart, tangy flavors with just a little bit of spice from the jalapeno. Yum!\n\nWe had also ordered the guacamole and a couple plates of the crispy rajas tacos and both were equally delicious. The guacamole could have been a lot bigger in my opinion but it did the trick, and the tacos were a very unique appetizer. They were simple, crispy potato tacos accentuated by the salty cotija cheese and the sweet roasted corn. All the flavors came together very nicely in this dish, but it's a shame that you only get two for $10!\n\nOf course, the prices here are pretty high but I was expecting that for a restaurant inside the Mandalay Bay. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area that doesn't mind splurging a little on a meal. I am also really interested in trying the Los Angeles chains, and hopefully they are equally as good."

It honestly reminds me of El Torito Grill or any other Mexican restaurant that's on the fancier end. We went on a Sunday night around 7pm and found it decently full, but with no wait. Keep in mind this was Labor Day weekend too. We weren't looking for a full-on meal and most of their dishes were $20+ so we ended up ordering the baja ceviche ($15) and the carne asada quesadilla ($19). Both were tasty, but a little too pricey for what you're getting, which is not much, in my opinion. I know it's Vegas and it's a very nice restaurant so I can't really blame them, but I doubt I will return. It's just Mexican food. I can get both dishes for cheaper and tastier elsewhere.\n\nThe two highlights were the complimentary chips and salsa (they give you 3 different sauces) and the service. Our waiter was nice enough to even pack our leftover chips and salsa, which was awesome. Not really a must if I'm ever in Vegas again, but Border Grill is good and would make a nice date place so it's a solid 3.5 stars in my book."

Everything has been as wonderful as the chefs themselves. This LV location is not representative of that tradition. At least not on the night I brought my family here. \nWe sat and had our drink orders taken. The Arnold palmers were sweeter than dessert should be. Traded them out for iced teas instead. Chips and salsa were mentioned but didn't make it to the table until after the appetizer hit us. Bit of a fail in the service. \nThe appetizer was the queso fundido. Great. Except that an appetizer meant to be shared by the table of 4 came with 1 flour tortilla! Really? If you're going to give us 1 tortilla to share then cut it up into wedges at least, so we don't all have to try to be polite about our tiny portion of 1 tortilla to share! Should have been at least 2-3 instead of 1. An extra one cost a buck so why not add the buck to the original cost if $1 is the issue?\nThe main course was a little bit of a lot of stuff. The Guatemalan ceviche was perfect. Bravo ceviche bar! The carnitas were run of the mill. No seasoning, nothing memorable at all aside from the presentation. Yucca fries in chimichurri with garlic aioli were also basic AF. We skipped dessert because we did not want to be disappointed one more time. \nThe personality and creativity this team of chefs has was so underrepresented in this meal that I just gave up on the night. Went back to the room and got some zzzs to put the day away. I thought going to the two hot tamales in Vegas was a sure bet but the gamble did not pay off.\nOh yeah. And something made me sick. It's 10am and I can't imaging eating still."

I wish Susan's cuteness and total cuisine inventiveness on Masters would have translated better on my plate. I went for the Spicy Shrimp tacos and couldn't have been more disappointed. The mini-corn tortillas on which the shrimp sat were soggy because they were overwhelmed with guac and other toppings, which didn't add to the dish's tastiness. The shrimp themselves were well-spiced... but were, unfortunately, served cold... as were the sides (the two types of rice on my plate were hard pellets and the almost-frozen pureed blackbeans were absolutely unappetizing). When I asked for a little hot sauce, Tabasco was bought to the table.... SERIOUSLY??!! I expect Tabasco at most restos... but not at Mex ones.... and especially not at this one.

So tasty.\n\nWe had the guacamole with tortilla chips, plantain empanadas, short rib enchiladas, chicken poblano enchiladas, and the flourless chocolate cake with almond ice cream. \n\nSince we were staying at the Delano hotel attached to Mandalay Bay, I wanted to visit this spot then found a deal on travelzoo which also included 2 drinks. We got margaritas which although not overly sweet, I thought the size was small and that they tasted weak. We sat on the covered patio on a 110 degree day, so I appreciated that they brought a carafe of water for the table, as well as bringing refills. \n\nOur waitress/waiter shared service of the patio and were both super friendly. I appreciated that the menu is very clear about GF labeling. We also saw the owner (who was on Top Chef Masters tv show) greeting a table, then later we saw her in the lobby of the hotel and she was super nice."

Every time I have visited, we have had the \"tasting menu\".  The last time I was there (last week), we noticed that the price had increased for the tasting menu by almost $10 and the menu had been revised with fewer overall options.  The tasting menu used to be in the mid $40 range per person.  This time it was $56 (I think) per person.  This is still a bargain for a tasting menu and especially for decent food in Vegas.  Yet, I was disappointed that some of my favorite dishes were gone completely from the menu.  The service has always been on point.  I really didn't like sitting in the basement this last time.  I felt so removed from the vibrance of the restaurant.  Overall, I would still return next time I am in Vegas."

It was nice out and a little sticky (humidity was 35%) and they turned on their huge outside fan about an hour later.\n\nI ordered:\n- Tuna Crudo\n- Duck Chilequiles\n- Whoopie Pie and Cinnamon Horchata. \n\nThe bf ordered:\n- Mushroom Empanadas\n- Gaucho Steak\n- Whoopie Pie and Cinnamon Horchata\n\nI will have to say that THE BEST DISH we had out of all of them was hands down the Gaucho Steak. OMG, It was the most softest steak I've ever had. That literally melted in my mouth. No chewing for a million years, it was just absolutely freakishly good!\n\nMy Duck Chilequiles I was not too impressed with. Barely 2oz of duck and majority of the plate was filled with tortilla chips drenched in like an enchilada type sauce. It did taste good with the meat that I did eat but not worth it because of so little meat. \n\nAs far as the appetizers went, the tuna crudo is really good if you eat it with the tortilla chips they give you when you first sit down. Adds extra texture. It's also warmish, not cold which threw me off but still good. The empanadas weren't that bad. I'm not a mushroom kinda person either. \n\nThe whoopie pie to me was alright. Bf liked it a lot as it was not sweet and he's had the cinnamon drink before whereas, I've never had it so to me it was eh. \n\nService was really great up until we finished our 2nd course. Our waiter was no where to be found. The guy who took away our plates also took away the water pitcher and never brought a new one back and my glass was completely empty. It took probably 20+ min before we got our waiters attention to bring our last course and to pack one of them to go. \n\nOther then the slow service at the end, I would definitely come here again and DEFINITELY recommend the Gaucho Steak. That stuff is legit!"

We shopped all around the strip at various hotels and chose Mandalay Bay. We wanted to have the reception within walking distance. Reading other reviews about various venues had us concerned and since we weren't spending a brazillion dollars we were given peasants' treatment. We decided to check out Border Grill and it we just couldn't say no. All in all we have to thank the manager Destiny for making it a wonderful experience without issue.\n\nFast forward a year later, the experience was right on the mark. We had Alicia as our server who was the right amount of attentive, the orders were turned around quick and service with a genuine smile.\n\nThe entre\u00e9s are well priced and delicious. The skirt steak and goucho steak were two items I have tried and liked the best. I prefer mine a little rare and the seasoning was just right. Expect a hint of char. My wife had the chicken chilaquiles which were delightful - highly recommended.\n\nTheir signagure drinks are the house-infused margaritas and sangrias. All are fantastic. And let's not forget dessert. I am a big fan of the tres leches cake. A year later I am trying to find a way to replicate it.\n\nIn summary - the price is great for the high-level service and quality of food/drink. I can't recommend Border Grill enough."

They offer 7 different flavors ranging from blood orange to watermelon to pomegranate. All very good! \n\nWe made a reservation through open table since I figured it'd probably be a bit busy. We came around 11 am and were quickly seated. Our server was super friendly and explained the lunch vs brunch menus to us. She also let me know we'd be getting 15% off our bill for being locals. Gotta love the local love!\n\nFood wise I loved some of the dishes but thought the others were just meh. I ended up getting the huevos rancheros, tomatillo egg benedict, chilaquiles and the tres leches french toast. I did enjoy that they're small plates so you're able to order multiple dishes to try without getting too stuffed. My favorites were the chilaquiles and huevos rancheros, both were very unique and flavorful. The benefict I personally didn't care for and felt it was kinda bland. Same with the french toast, just ok. \n\nI'm excited to come back here again soon and try some more of the dishes!"

To start, my house margarita was just how I like it, lots of fresh lime and a little salt, and they brought out warm chips and a trio of salsas. I may have filled up on chips while waiting for our food, but most of it failed to impress. \n\nThe sweet corn tamal was certainly not like my husband's abuela used to make, but the flavor really reminded me of a corn pudding casserole that my grandma makes for special occasions. Her's involves cans of creamed corn and a roux that is cooked in a microwave; the rest is a family secret. The chile relleno was OK, but lacking in some areas. The batter was soggy rather than crispy and the cheese medley just didn't have that oozing, melted quality that every good relleno needs. The beans on the side were bland, and the red and green rices provided more color than flavor. However, the biggest offense here was something labeled on the menu as \"Peruvian ceviche.\" It beared no resemblance to any ceviche I've ever seen a Peruvian make, even appearing to contain mayonnaise?!  The plate was messy, and my husband was unhappy. If you want to be bashed by my husband for eternity, serve him a bad ceviche. Worse yet, throw some watercress and orange segments on the plate, so I can laugh at the poorly planned garnish.\n\nOur dessert was a simple plate of flan with 3 pieces of strawberry. I'm delighted to say that the flan was perfect: rich, dense, and creamy with a nice dark caramel flavor. My husband commented that this was the only dish he'd think about coming back for. It was not filled with air bubbles from overbaking, as many restaurants tend to serve it. Overcooked flan makes me want to cry. I can't say much for Border Grill, but at least the meal started and ended on positive notes."

CLEARLY they don't check in on this place and they should. Giving a one star is generous as I don't have the zero star option. We started with a margarita, which was not good at all. My husband got a mojito and it was un drinkable. In fact, we sent it back three times. Finally the manger, Ryan, came by the table with the fourth one, which was only passable. When he inquired about our food we told him it was mediocre at best and he seemed shocked and only replied really maybe three or four times...he didn't seem interested in righting the situation. We stopped after we had their chorizo fondito, which was lackluster - banal and boring. We also had their signature appetizer dish - the tamale was unlike any I've had - not held together and cloyingly sweet. The empanada on the plate was okay and the chicken app was beyond tasteless. Needless to say I didn't waste my calories on it. Alas, it was a chip and salsa lunch. And, well folks, they weren't good either....sadness! I say these two need to hire someone who has their best interests in mind to manage this place."

Two stars is due to the fact that it was very expensive for what we got and, by that, I mean the poor taste of the food and severely underwhelming mimosas. The price per person is $34.99 for bottomless small plates and $10 for bottomless mimosas. The small plates, where we tried almost all of them except for two, were significantly underwhelming or not very good. The only dish that was outstanding was the corn tamales. Everything else, from the shrimp and grits to the steak and eggs to the chile rellenos to the churros to the tres leches French toast to the taquitos and more were just blah. The lettuce wraps containing corn with cheese and a chipotle sauce were absolutely terrible. The mimosas were just bland... The blood orange mimosa was OK. I then ordered the peach mimosa which did not change the taste that much from the blood orange one and my friend ordered the prickly Pear mimosa which was a spectacular beautiful fuchsia pink and had a wonderful medicine taste to go along with it. It just was not good. We still felt hungry at the end because we only had a little bit of each plate since not very good and paid a fortune.\nThis is a restaurant that likely does well because of its location, in a very busy hotel with a lot of tourists. I would not recommend it at all as a local because it was very disappointing and there are plenty of way better places for brunch. \nThe guest that was with me, who is from Mexico, was very disappointed and explained that all of the Mexican dishes were way below the part that is expected of even a really good Mexican dish.\nThe only good thing was that we had a very nice waiter but otherwise, the ambience of the restaurant is just OK.

We all got $3 tacos - the fish one was AMAZING. We also ordered guac, coconut shrimp, chicken nachos and chicken quesadilla. And to top it off, we all got $5 margs! \n\nThe chicken quesadilla was truly unreal. It was full of flavor and the cheese was soooo good. By far my favorite! \n\nThe environment of the restaurant was nice too. Mexican music in the background, not too loud. Very clean and good service. We sat at high top tables near the bar area. \n\nOverall, great Mexican food in Vegas, great for big groups, and I would definitely come back!"

Very Vegas.\n\nThe food:\nThey start you with chips and salsa, of course. The tortilla chips are great. Just thick enough to be crunchy rather than crispy, and the right level of salt. Two of the three salsas were pretty good, but not even remotely spicy so we asked if they had anything with some kick. Our waiter brought their spicy salsa, but it was really disappointing - kinda bland, not spicy on my tongue, then fiery in the back of my throat - all of the bad of spicy food and none of the good. We went back to the two that we liked.\n\nTheir guacamole was very good. Extremely fresh and flavorful, and they let the avocado shine.\n\nBased on our waiter's suggestion, I ordered their Yucatan pork. It was pretty good, but not any better than I've had in family taqueria's in the bay area. Solid refried beans, completely unremarkable spanish rice, moist pork. The corn tortillas were dry around the edges so I stopped after eating one of them. Probably the best thing on the plate was the plantains.\n\nThe service was very good from start to finish.\n\nMy overall impression is that this was a reasonable place that I wouldn't avoid, but neither did it leave me with anything that screamed \"I have to return.\""

I wanted to eat a nice meal, but one that I could afford, so a few of us ended up at the Border Grill.  I was pleased with our choice for sure.\n\nDining on the patio in the heat with the misters every so often cruising our way, it was a gorgeous time of dusk to dine.\n\nSipping on my Cruzan Mojito and enjoying my two appetizers, tortilla soup and plantain empanadas, I was just reveling in the fact that this meal wasn't going to break my bank.  It felt upscale, but the average $25 entrees were reasonable.\n\nEverything about the service, location, drinks, and all the entrees on the table had a hint of class to them, I was just stoked to be able to afford them....this way i could go and, instead of spending $100 on a meal, just hand the money to the blackjack dealer and say, \"here, I think you need this more than me\".  That experience would only take 5 minutes, as opposed to the 2 hour or so meal i could have enjoyed with it.  I mean, you see my point right?  5 minutes i can deal with...2 hours of tasty food...yah, like ill ever get that 2 hours back. \n\nOK...ill pull the bitter back, and just say that it was a delightful choice for a meal.

If I was here again I'd try something else.\n\nIf you're in LV and want a good fish taco go to Border Food Juarez/El Paso at 412 N. Eastern.  You get real fish (not some rectangular deep fried hunk), lightly floured/fried & served with all fresh ingredients.  I would eat here every day if it were closer to my house.\n\nIf you're in LV and want good tortilla soup get in a car and drive 8 hours to the bay area of CA and go to Una Mas.  They take a delicious broth, add chunks of GRILLED chicken, SPOON IN fresh pieces of avocado, and sprinkle it with grated cheese & fresh strips of tortillas.  They assemble each bowl to order.  Best tortilla soup EVER.  \n\nOne thing I'd definitely get if I went back to Border Grill is a drink that went past me on a tray.  I have no idea what it was but the glass was trimmed with toasted coconut and it looked great.\n\nUPDATE 2016:\nI went back the spring of 2016 & ordered fish tacos again.  They came with grapefruit on them!  GRAPEFRUIT?!? And not just any kind, but the sweet pink kind.  FYI grapefruit on a fish taco is awful :("

They gave us chips with three different types of salsas and a free corn tamale to hold them over for the main entree. The corn tamale appetizer with salsa and sour cream dip was a mix of sweet and savory. I liked it and my sons liked it too despite the hesitation to try it at first for its very mushy appearance and texture.  It didn't take long before my boys orders of carne asada and chicken quesadillas were placed on our table. My eldest said their quesadilla was a tie to mine if it was an actual contest, so that's quite a compliment (for them) considering he wants to eat my homemade quesadilla everyday (ask me for my recipe, if you like). The seasonal fish available was mahi mahi so I had to try their fish tacos (Ensenada tacos) and it was recommended by the waitress. It was served on corn tortilla filled with mahi mahi, avocados, cilantro, shredded green papaya and grapefruit (saved the best for last). Now I don't usually like grapefruit in any form, but it added a citrus punch to this taco that was quite good. It also had a right spicy taste too. I didn't  like their cilantro and plain rice as I found it too dry and not so tasty. Service was great- very attentive, always kept filling my empty glass of water, and warm. I may come again just to try their brunch since others are raving about it (weekends and it starts at 10 am)."

            "review": "Border Grill is hands down THE BEST brunch on the strip- and you heard it from me, C. Everet Bruncher the 3rd. Their brunch combines usual breakfast fare- waffles, eggs, hash browns, with southwestern flavors- tomatillos, guava, chills, and then throws it at your face tappas style instead of trough style like many inferior brunch buffets. When I moved to Vegas I had just finished watching the season of Top Chef pro or whatever its called were Mary Sue came in second place so I was extremely eager to try this place. As I walked through the desolate Mandalay Bay (apparently there was no NASCAR event or P Diddy concert, the only things that seem to make this place busy) and got to the restaurant which was only about 1/2 full I started to get a bit worried. Had I wasted the precious calories it took to walk here from self park? That walk took at least 4 minutes and I don't undertake such journeys lightly- too large a risk of orcs. \n\nAs soon as we were seated we were brought a trio of regular human salsas and then a 4th devils brew salsa seemingly designed to make GITMO detainees talk. Service was attentive but not annoying, and since for this brunch you are dependent on your server to bring you the food that is crucial as even a 5-10 minute gap could result in a riot. \n\nThe menu changes every 2-3 months or so, but it is always around 20 small plate items, 3-4 of which is more than enough to fill up the average person. Combine that with all you can drink mimosas- that come in like 15 different flavors- and breakfast margaritas... which as far as I can tell is just a regular margarita with a little vanilla in it. What a glorious place where you can get drunk at 10am as long as your drinks have a splash of vanilla. America. \n\nSome menu highlights\n\nPigs in  Blanket- comes with a manchego cheese dipping sauce that I would drink by the glass if possible- BY THE GLASS I say. \n\nChurro Tots- I mean, if you needed me to tell you to order these than there is something seriously wrong with you.\n\nBreakfast fries- basically hashbrowns with three delicious sauces spread around them. \n\nWaffle - I have had this twice, once it came with pork belly which was amazing, the other time it came with \"ham\" which appeared to just be bacon cooked inside the waffle itself. The pork belly was definitely better but I'm not gonna split hairs over a bacon stuffed waffle. \n\nEggs Benedict- this comes with like picked red onion or picked radish or something on it that sort of taints the dish and makes it all pink. Order without that.\n\nSteak and eggs- great. You prob get a solid 6 ounces of skirt steak with each order. It has a delicious black bean puree underneath it all. A must get.\n\nOyster Taco- this came with way more vegetables than I was expecting so I just ate the cornbread battered fried Oyster. Would eat again. \n\n\nSome things to Avoid\n\nBrisket Sliders- these are prepared like a Vietnamese sandwich. You know all those people who when eating good BBQ brisket say \"damn this needs some carrots and cilantro\"... oh wait thats no one. \n\nFruit Creme Brule- meh, I mean its yogurt, not sure why I ordered this.

            "review": "I can't give Border Grill a better than 3 star review because it is the little things that matter just as much as the big things.\n\nWe went on a LivingSocial deal that for $59 for two we got guacamole, an appetizer to share, 2 $29 entrees, a dessert and 2 drinks.  Good deal, right?  \n\nThe service was good and attentive, in fact very good.  The margaritas that came with the meal were small and we finished them quickly.  Not bad but nothing special.  The chips and salsa were tasty but nothing much beyond what is found in every Mexican restaurant in town.  We had the ahi tuna appetizer and while there were spicy tastes, the tuna itself seemed to get lost and had no recognizable taste.\n\nOur entrees were good sized, I had the tecate carnitas and she had the sauteed scallops and shrimp.  Both were good and certainly a cut above your average Mexican place.  The flour tortilla that came with my dish was really tasty.  The carnitas were not as tasty and seemed a little bland.\n\nI complained when we first sat down that it was cold.  Nothing changed.  Towards the end of our meal a manager came by to inquire about our satisfaction and I mentioned that sitting and being cold took away from my enjoyment of the meal.  He did apologize with some story of doing some remodeling, that the hotel controls the heat and that the room they put us in was more of an overflow room with lots of glass and doors.  Regardless, I was cold and a place that has no control of the temp should renegotiate their lease.  I feel that Border Grill is responsible for my comfort not Mandalay Bay Hotel.  Why put people in this room when you know it is cold.  That night it dropped into the 30's.  I would have trouble hearing any excuse other than offering to move our table which was never offered.\n\nIf I would have paid full price I would have left unhappier.  While nice it was not superior and while the servers all did a great job there were enough little things that were only palatable because of the deal."

The atmosphere is just okay, but I heard they have outdoor seating?  I wish I would've known!  I love sitting outside.  Food and atmosphere gets a 4 out of five star rating.\n\nI have a lot to say about the cocktails, I'd give them a 3/5 rating.. maybe a 2.  I came here with my husband's family and I knew I was in for a pretty boring dinner.  Might as well have a couple martinis to make the visit more bearable!  The espresso martini tastes amazing, I had two of them.  They had a very spicey southwest taste to them that was fantastic and unusual, but WTF, where's the alcohol?!  I usually am pretty comfortably buzzed after two martinis but I didn't feel any love from the two I had here at Border Grill.  I sat through the rest of my dinner and day with the inlaws totally SOBER and pissed off about it.  They lose a star for being stingy with the alcohol."

We visited on a Thursday evening and it was dead in the dining room while the bar was full of loud conference attendees. The food is fine, overpriced like much of the restaurants in Vegas, but not outrageous. The problem was the service, the wait staff was just not bothered, even the manager hung out in the bar area. It took forever to get menus and after our meat almost 15 minutes to get the check, which was ridiculous considering there was only three tables and two servers. We won't be back."

I had the Yucatan Pork and it was just delicious. I hate yams but the yams it came with were amazing and complimented the warm home made corn tortillas wonderfully. A little pork, some yams, and those tortillas was heaven. Love on a plate! The second time I went I had the special which was Short rib tacos with a roasted corn salsa and cheese grits on top of their home made corn tortillas. It was dry rubbed so it had a nice spice to it and just fell apart. Delicious, amazing, delicious, no words can describe how amazing it was. I will def. be going to the Border Grill close to my house in Santa Monica, I am a customer for life. Autumn was amazing. One of the best servers I have had since I was in Vegas though the 2 days I went to Border Grill the hostesses were sub part. One was suppose to bring me a bunch menu and just completely forgot and it wasn't even busy. That aside this place was pretty much flawless!"

To start off, our server served my friend water in a cracked glass.  When we noticed and alerted her she was less than empathetic.  Throughout the meal it was almost like the server was going through mood swings.  She was nice then she was rude then she was friendly again.  Very strange.\n\nOnto the food.  Spectacular.  The all you can eat tapas menu is phenomenal and the $10 bottomless mimosas is a must!  They have over 15 different flavors!  The French toast, steak and eggs, and breakfast fries were some of my favorites!  For dinner I had the steak quesadilla, very simple but excellent quality of steak.  One strange thing to mention though.. We ordered he fries a second time and this time they were seasoned completely different.  Kinda strange as I enjoyed them the first way better.\n\nI absolutely will be back to try new menu items and have another great experience."

On the menu it said that it was served with a basket of fruits and pastries.   I never received my fruits and pastries. \n\nWhen the pancakes arrived I was very disappointed in the COLD BACON.  I mean, COLD.  Could they not even microwave it?  Also, I was not given the option of adding my own syrup, the pancakes were already drowning in syrup.  I don't like that much syrup, but the waitress disappeared, never to be seen again until she dropped off the check later.  \n\nThere was so much syrup on my pancakes that the top pancake literally disintegrated.  I tried to eat some but it kept triggering my gag reflex.   I ate some of my husband's food, hoping the waitress would come back and I could order something else.  Finally, I gave up and pulled out the middle pancake and ate it because it wasn't quite so wet.  When the waitress finally came back, I complained about the pancakes and she scowled.  She didn't offer to bring me something else, or refund my money, or, I don't know, maybe bring out the pastries and fruit that were promised to me on the menu!  I didn't feel like I had the right to really press the issue because I had already eaten about a third of it.  \n\nTo add insult to injury, that pile of crap cost me TWENTY DOLLARS.  My husband was embarrassed that he had been talking that place up to me.  It's a week later and I'm still feel nauseated every time I think about those nasty, nasty pancakes and that cold bacon.  \n\nThere are too many good restaurants in Vegas to put up with crap like this.  SKIP IT!"

No one was in the mood for anything too fancy, and one of my brothers is a vegan, so we searched around online until we found a spot that had the potential to make everyone happy.  Mission accomplished, Border Grill.  Everything you could want in a Mexican restaurant was here:  friendly service, a wide variety of quality margaritas, great salsas and guacamole, and entrees that were inventive yet at the same time familiar (in a good way).  Everyone, including the vegan, came away happy, which is no mean feat with such a picky group.  I definitely would eat here again and look forward to trying some of the other locations."

I also love me the $35 something price tag for their all you can eat brunch. Add $8 for all you can drink mimosas and I am on my way to a great Sunday afternoon. \n\nThey do small plates for all of their brunch offerings. If you are there with a large party, they will prepare items on platters and present it family style. \n\nWhat we had:\n\nGreen corn tamales- It was less a solid tamale and more of a corn pudding style in consistency. The flavors were amazing. It has a little kick, but the corn was so bright and sweet. \n\nPlantain Empandas- The sweetness of the bananas balanced out the saltiness of the cheese and black beans. The green chilies made it a well rounded dish.\n\nBacon Jalapeno PB&J- Loved this dish. It is a fat kids dream. A breakfast sandwich jammed together with every kids favorite simple sandwich makes me drool a little bit. I won't lie, I make these at home from time to time and this version is everything I want it to be and more.\n\nPeruvian Shrimp and Grits- Uh, yes please. The sauce has a kick and the grits are creamy.\n\nSkirt Steak and Eggs- The meat and eggs are cooked to perfect. The best protein on the menu.\n\nYucatan Eggs Benedict- Too much biscuit. It is basically a toad in a hole, but overwhelming.\n\nMachaca Chiaquiles- A pile of mush. Odd dish.\n\nShort Rib Hash and Eggs- Too many eggs by this point. How many innocent casualties must be left in our path!\n\nChurro Tots- Not as good as they sound. Odd sweet and sourness to them. Not quite a beignet, not quite a doughnut.\n\nFig & Blue Cheese Quesadillas- The figs were the best part. Everything else got left behind.\n\nLobster Pancakes- The biggest disappointment of the day. Little to no lobster sprinkled on top and it was an actual pancake. Weird combination.\n\nBy the end, we were all tired and stuffed. The beginning half of the menu is by far the better half. I could have stopped at the Churro Tots and not think twice about the rest."

I ordered the \"spicy\" grilled shrimp and received what appeared to be bland, boiled shrimp atop a bed of watery rice. Literally. The rice was floating in broth and greens. My friend was given the suggestion of the seasonal fish, so he ordered it. The waitress failed to mention it was resting in a bowl of soup, despite the 100+ degree weather. The dessert, chocolate pie, was obviously premade thawed, and the drinks were overpriced and boring. The strawberry sangria tastes like Franzia. Overall, the food lacked any substance, as did our waitress, who kept telling us yes, then no, and blaming it on her manager for the night. Not worth even the Travelzoo prices."

I had done a lot of research and thought this was our best bet for a Mexican place on the strip.... maybe... but there has got to be something better. \n\nWe started off with free chips and salsa (decent, green one was my favorite). Then, our server  asks if we'd like guacamole for the table ($10). We agreed thinking that it would be a big bowl of guacamole. Boy were we wrong. The guac arrived on a small plate and wasn't even enough to eat with chips and our meals. \n\nAs for drinks, don't get the pitcher of margaritas. You're better off drinking before or after you come here because WHAT A RIP OFF!!!! We got a pitcher ($50) and it was very small and filled more than half way with ice!!! There was only enough for one round of margaritas for the four of us, plus 2 more glasses we had to split... sorry but in a $50 pitcher we should be able to refill our glasses once with no problems. \n\nThen came the food... I ordered the market vegetable quesadillas because I'm vegetarian and that was pretty much the only option besides the mushroom dish. I also asked for a side of black beans and rice, but I was told there was only black bean puree... um.. how do you get the puree if you don't have the beans? The quesadillas were gross and super soggy. The cheese was this thick white stuff (cojita? I think). Anyways, gross. I make better quesadillas myself. The rice tasted stale and the beans were weird  since I wanted real beans and not mush. \nThey did bring us free birthday desserts, which was nice. Overall, this place is HORRIBLE."

I had been to the Border Grill in Pasadena (which closed a few years ago) and loved it, so I guess I knew I would like it here before I sat down.\n\nWe had reservations for 9:30pm and were seating as soon as we walked in. Our table was in the middle of the room, which was crowded, but the table was large so I was comfortable. \n\nWe were brought water immediately and our server got our drinks in maybe 3 min. at the most. They were really busy and the servers seemed to be really on top of it. HONEYDEW MARGARITAS. oh boy.\n\nThe waiter told us to try the plantain empanadas, and i didn't need much persuasion. plantains are a favorite, pablano chilis are my favorite and i put cotija cheese on everything, so basically this was a match made in heaven for my mouth! (they also have black beans in them, which i prefer over pinto, but still usually stay away from). The three of us liked them so much we ordered a second serving. \n\nAt this point we knew we were in trouble. I was already getting full and we hadn't even had our entrees yet.\n\nRound 3 of margaritas had just arrived as my main course of Chile Rellenos was placed in front of me. The dish comes with rice and beans but I asked them to substitute their mashed sweet potatoes and garlic vegetables instead. The mashed sweet potatoes may have plantains in them too, or something else tangy. They were buttery and hot. I was soooo stuffed about 3 bites in...but I kept going.\n\nMy bf ordered Pibil thanks to my recommendation, which is a stewed pork dish. OMG I ate a lot of his. They add cinnamon to their sauce and it really gives the pork a whole new flavor. Its subtle but not just spicy......its aromatic. AND it comes with plantain orange salsa, which was asked for a bowl of because we all loved it soooo much! \n\nMy friend had chicken enchiladas, which she always orders. These are hard to do wrong, and usually are good everywhere you get them....even Taco Bell. She likes them with a lot of vegies, which is exactly what she got on top. Corn, peppers, onions, mushrooms......(i am allergic, so I didn't try her dish). \n\nWe also foolishly ordered a caesar salad to share. It was really crispy and the cilantro dressing was good, but TOOOOO MUCH FOOD.\n\nRound 5 of margaritas......i don't feel so good and I'm giggling like an english school boy.\n\ntime to relax. we let ourselves digest for about 10 mins....then the damn waiter told us about the desserts. and, well......when in Vegas, right?\n\nMexican Chocolate Pie. GOOD GOD. I died and heaven was in my mouth.\nOrange Cheesecake. So creamy, so good. I only got a little bite because the boyfriend did not want to share (maybe because I didn't let him try mine.....)\n\nMy friend opted not to have dessert and instead played on her iphone. Fool. The dessert was fantastic!!!! \n\nAll the food was complex and unique. Its not Mexican, its not Tex-Mex, its not Brazilian, its not Oaxacan, its not Argentinian, nor Peruvian. \n\nIts Border Grill. \n\n\nP.S.- Even though we were all dressed up and ready to go to out.....we waddled our way back to our room, lay on my bed and watched a movie. I couldn't even take off my shoes."

At first glance I really liked the decor and ambiance of this spot.   The hostess was pleasant and that is where the good service ended!  \n\nIt was a slow Monday night so you would think the service would be stellar since our waitress had three possibly 4 tables. She did quickly greeted us and took our drink order and then disappeared for what seemed like forever, realistically 15-20 minutes, but that is a long time when you are in need of an excellent margarita and some yummy Mexican food. \n\nOur waitress was then absent nearly all of our meal with someone else refilling our waters and delivering our food.   Our drinks were okay however weak, particularly for the price. They charge for tap water?? Really that is simply strange. I ordered the spicy shrimp tacos since I like spicy food and I was fairly dissatisfied with them. The portion was small and they forgot the spice! A label saying medium shrimp tacos would of been more appropriate. My friend ordered the Kobe beef tacos and was equally disillusioned with the portion and she said were unusually salty and dry.   \n\nI expected better quality food and service for the price ($97 after tip for two entrees and some drinks).  There are too many nice Mexican locations in Vegas so I am putting Border Grill on my \"Skip It\" List."

When they say all you can eat.. they mean it! We were there for about 3 and a half hours enjoying their delicious offerings plus $8 bottomless mimosas. We sat outside near the pool since the weather was perfect and really enjoyed our brunch. \n\nBecause there were more than 5 of us they suggested ordering family style so the food would come out a little more quickly so we did and it worked out quite well. After being seated were were automatically brought out some tasty guava empanadas and fresh fruit to much on while we decided on our mimosa flavors (did I mention there were 7 flavors to choose from??) and our first few menu items. We ended up trying 11 of their 22 dishes and some of the favorites were the Shrimp and Grits, Breakfast Fries and Bread Pudding French toast. Almost every dish was in some way super decedent and rich and it worked out perfectly to just have a few bites and move on to the next dish.\n\nOur waitress, Rachel, was amazing. She was super helpful with suggestions and answered any questions that we had. She also amazingly kept up with our mimosa and food requests as well as refreshing our plates, silver wear and water glasses when needed. She also never got tired of us asking her to repeat the mimosa flavors (maybe listing them on the menu would be a good idea).\n\nGreat experience and I would definitely choose this over a buffet any day!"

I didn't plan out lunch very well and on the first day I ended up in the food court eating a Nathan's foot long hot dog and fries for $11 and I was pissed.\n\nI was determined to find something better, and I had walked past this place called \"Border Grill\" while walking from the convention area back to my car in the parking garage, so I looked it up on Yelp.  It had good reviews, so I tried it out for lunch the 2nd day of the conference.\n\nPros:\n-Food is good and authentic\n-Seating is fast and they will get you out on time to get back to work\n-service is fairly good\n\nCons:\n-a little rushed\n-expensive, if you're not paying attention.\n\nAs I was seated, the waitress said \"Chips and salsa are coming, do you want some guacamole as well?:\n\nI should have known enough to ask what it cost but I didn't.  I think they rely on most people assuming that it is free.  I was served a plate of decent chips and salsa, and then a huge plate of chips and guacamole.\n\nI ordered the special smoked salmon bagel, which was very good.  In fact, it was extremely filling considering it sounds like a brunch item.\n\nWhen I got the check, though, I saw the guacamole plate was ten dollars!  This raised my lunch from ~25 to about ~35 bucks.  Kind of a scam, if you ask me.\n\nThe waitress should tell you the price of the guacamole when offering it, I've never been anywhere that a guac+chips plate was more than 4 or 5 bucks.\n\nI left a minimal tip (don't feel too bad for her, my minimal tip is 11%).  She should have told me up front what the costs were.\n\nAnywyay, lunch was very good, certainly better than Nathans, and I would go again, but be careful about what you order."

I ordered the fish tacos and hubby ordered the short rib enchiladas. I was shocked to see my tacos, they were so small, like an appetizer, the tortillas were smaller than fajita sized tortillas(which is the size I expected). There was a chunk of fish in each taco( there were 3) but the piece of fish on one of the tacos only covered half of the tortilla. So, I take a bite and although presentation was good, these tacos were so bland to me. I tasted a hint of lime but that was about it. Hubby said he would rather eat Taco Bell! He said the taste wasn't horrid, but his dish was way overpriced. Service was horrible, we were  checked on once during our meal by our waitress. We had more interaction from the bus boy!!  The water we were served was barely cold, after filling our glass once, we were given a carafe of room temperature water. I guess their ice maker was broken. We ordered the guacamole, it was good, but way overpriced as well. It came with two oversized chips to which hubby and I both exclaimed \"that's it?!\"  Maybe we both got bad dishes, or the chef was having an off night and forgot to season our food. If you are recovering from the flu and need bland food, I highly recommend this place. :)"

            "review": "We had our wedding reception in a beautiful private room overlooking the patio.  The room holds about 60 sit down, and I think up to 80 stand up. We put down an 800$ dollar deposit, with a minimum of 4,000$, add on tax and tip and round up to about 5,100. They also have a smaller room that holds about 35 people for 3000$ minimum.  \n\nThe banquet coordinator Jessica was unbelievably sweet and helpful.  She went above and beyond the call of duty. She helped me with everything.  I emailed her about a million times and talked with her at length about everything. Cake, food, rental, seating arrangements, flowers, and even suggestions of other vendors.  She helped me find rental chairs and she booked it under her business name and got me a cheaper rate. The Border Grill chairs are an orange-brownish color. I really wanted silver chairs. The rental chairs ran about 10$ dollars each, and Jessica got me her cheaper rate at about 8$ each. She also got me a speaker and microphone for about 50$ dollars cheaper. You don't really need a speaker if your best man is loud enough. Go through Jessica, she makes sure the rental's show up on time.I think she knows about getting a DJ as well.  I don't think a DJ is worth it. The Border Grill music is pipped in, the stereo system is awesome. It is kind of Jazzy, Latin music. They can also turn it off really quick when you have speeches.\n\nI had already booked my wedding cake with another vendor for about 500$. They add a cake cutting fee, I think 2$ per person.\n FYI...she is working with the chef on wedding cakes.  I think she said they would run about 170$ for 30 people, but don't quote me on that. She had no pictures, so I went with my first option.  Talk to her about cakes, see if they updated the website with pictures.  \n\nThey have no hidden charges.  She sits with you on the phone tapping away at her calculator.  So you know exactly what things will cost.  \nShe helped me with my choice of entrees and changes that I wanted with adding on different types of sauces and salads.  Their \"Set Menu\" are very flexible, and the prices are very reasonable...for Vegas. I got about 8 appetizer platters to pass around for cocktail half hour they run anywhere from 13$ to 50$.  I had two salad choices, a champagne toast and for the entrees I had  fish, skirt steak, and enchilada's.  About 65$ per person. Everyone raved about the food. I printed my own menu's, see pictures above. I wish that I had printed a drink menu of margarita's and sangria suggestions on the back of my menu's.  I don't think people took full advantage of the full bar and they mostly got wine and beer. \n\nSo my total cost for 55 people with the ultra lavish food, tons of appetizers, champagne toast, full open bar and amazing rental chairs ran about 9000$ dollars. You can easily go thousands less depending on your guest count, food and rental needs. I also asked Jessica to charge my card for about 1000$ a month for four months so that I did not have a crazy bill on my wedding day. Don't worry, she really only needs the deposit to hold the room.  Layaway wedding...less stress.\nAlso if you want to send favors, menu's and candles. Ship them to her office. She told me to send them to her, and I made the mistake of shipping all my boxes to The hotel room. Then they charged me 30$ to deliver to my room and then the hotel lost one of my boxes. Jessica walked over to the postal delivery room and talked with security and had him look through all of the boxes for me.  WOW, talk about above and beyond. Thank You. The lost box had my cake server set, thank God Jessica had a nice set to lend me.\nThey do provide beautiful candles in an orange striped color glass, so if your colors match that then your set for the tables.  \nWe had a beautiful wedding reception. It was magical. Worth every penny."

Thank goodness this brunch was set right after the Packers Game, because I did NOT want to miss it.\n\nSo I've been hearing a lot of great stuff about this place from many friends, Yelpers or not.  It's a Sunday Brunch for $29.99.  This brunch menu includes and array of tapas style small plates, ALL YOU CAN EAT!  We had a party of 8 and Border Grill was super cool to transform the small plates into a family style platter to accommodate our party.  The best part:  pay an extra $5 and you have a bottomless mimosa special.  STEAL!!!\n\nFor the mimosa, I stuck to the same flavor which was amazing: the pomegranate mimosa.  They literally have a selection to choose from.  It's awesome!!  For the brunch portion, here's what I got and here's what I thought:\n\nShort Rib Hash and Eggs - Beer braised Short Ribs hashed with caramelized onions and yams with a sunny side up egg.  This dish was to die for!!  The short rib was rich in flavor from the Negro Modelo.  The yams made the dish a little sweet, but in an AH-MAZE-ING way.  Crack the egg and the yolk adds a thick depth of flavor to the dish.  I LOVED IT SOOOOO MUCH!!\n\nPeruvian Shrimp and Grits - Chile marinated shrimp, poblano chiles and Parmesan grits.  The shrimp was a little spicy but super flavorful and cooked perfectly.  I even grossed my table out with the tail.  I'm a proud Filipino who happens to love eating the crunchy tails of the shrimp.  Don't judge me! LOL.  The grits were good, but certainly an acquired taste.  \n\nYucatan Egg Benedict - Manchego cheese biscuit, roasted pork, poached egg, hollandaise sauce served with pickled onions.  Not the favorite, that's for sure.  I don't know if it was dense and soggy biscuit, or the poached egg or the texture of the pickled onions.  Something just didn't add up.  \n\nCrispy Potato Rajas Taco - YUMMY!!  Potatoes and chiles, Mexican cheeses, guacamole, corn relish and chipotle aoili.  This was a GREAT dish!  My mouth is still salivating over this taco.  Who would have thought?!  A potato taco!\n\nChurro Tots - dulce de leche infused churros, cinnamon sugar, caramel and pear dipping sauce with whipped cream.  This was the perfect end to our very huge brunch!  The churros were little bite sized goodness and the dipping sauces were the perfect touch!!\n\nAll in all, we had a great time.  We were sat on the outside deck.  Although in the winter, the warmers made it feel comfortable.  The decor was a little eclectic but it worked.  I definitely think you should try this brunch if you have not.  It's a little pricey, but perfect for the strip and great for a Holiday like Christmas!!  I'm definitely going to push for making this an annual event :)"

Too bad I got the grilled fish tacos.  The tacos were nicely plated with red, white and green rice.  However, I had fish bones on my tacos and had to send them back 3 times!  By the third time, I still had fish bones and I just gave up on my entree.  A girl could only take so much bone swallowing in one night.  They comped my tacos and our desserts which we appreciated: Flourless Chocolate Cake, Tres Leches Cake and another dessert.  They were ok.\n\nIt was a disappointing meal.  I felt bad for our server who had to keep sending my plate back to the kitchen.  I'm not a diner who's a PITA and I don't make complaining a habit either but seriously, whoever was in charge of de-boning and filleting fish that night shouldn't be let back in the kitchen.\n\nBorder Grill fish tacos?

I live in California, where we have access to tons of Mexican and \"Mexican,\" so perhaps that colored my opinion.  \n\nWe ordered the quinoa fritters, which were a little oily but had a great flavor.  My husband and I split an order of three tacos and sides (you can mix from the tacos listed on the menu, which was a nice way to sample more).  We had the avocado (ok, kind of dry), the carnitas (pretty good, not exceptional), and the chicken panucho (extremely oily, no real flavor).  This came with beans and rice (red and green), which were ok.  This was easily enough for the two of us to share.  \n\nOur dining companions ordered the three tacos (shrimp and Yucatan pork were both deemed \"good,\" can't remember the third) and the Border Classics (chicken panuchos and some tamales and empanadas), which was also \"good.\"  \n\nThere is a .50 charge for water, which I thought was odd; it included still or sparkling water.

Their menus had convoluted descriptions for very basic Mexican dishes.  \n\nTheir tamale appetizer was crap.  It was supposed to be a baked tamale but it ended up being mush.  It wasn't even cooked properly.  If that is the way it's served than don't call it a tamale, call it corn tamalito or corn mush.  And btw, if I wanted corn mush, I would go to Chevy's not a \"fine dining\" Mexican restaurant.\n\nThey don't set the table with salt or pepper, which I think is really weird.  When I asked for salt, the waitress said, \"What is it for?  Your chips?\"  Like I couldn't have it otherwise.  When the salt arrived, they served it in a side dish.  Not a shaker.\n\nYET, they sell cookbooks. \"Don't come back to our restaurant, cook your own food with these books.\"  BAD marketing.\n\nThis place isn't worth it when there are so many other restaurants that don't need to try as hard as Border Grill does.  And, they will offer you salt."

While I was waiting for the others to arrive I ordered a lemonade and was brought tortilla chips with three different salsas. The tortilla chips were crisp and tasted like they had just been fried even though there was no visible sign of grease. I also enjoyed the freshly squeezed strawberry lemonade which had a balanced flavor. I ordered the house  guacamole, tortilla soup, and a chicken Caesar salad. Both the house guacamole and the chicken Caesar salad were executed well. The guacamole was seasoned well and the avocado had a lot of natural flavor. The chicken in the salad was grilled to perfection and the Caesar dressing was just right on the anchovy. I wasn't as thrilled with the tortilla soup. The tomato broth was a little thick, it had big chunks of unmelted cheese, and it didn't come out hot. \n\nOur waitress, helped us out with a discount for locals and told us about the Sunday Brunch where you get unlimited plates. I like the concept of all you can eat plates because the quality of the food is normally better, you don't have to hassle with other people, and it's more sanitary. I will be back eventually to try brunch."

Our waitress was very attentive and extremely knowledgeable of the menu also had great suggestions to give to the entire table. For myself I went and ordered the $55 all you can eat small plates course to say the least this was a fantastic move by myself. Everything I ate was extremely well prepared had many different flavors all flavors were very clean and all harmonize together in a certain way. I walked out of that restaurant absolutely stuffed but also knew that I tried several different items to get a feel of the entire menu. The bonus of having this meal was knowing that while I am paying a Vegas premium price I'm getting a premium meal. I would recommend this for anybody with a big appetite that is willing to try things outside of the box. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anybody. Just keep in mind that you are paying for a Vegas meal on the strip so the prices will be inflated to Vegas pricing."

They remodeled the interior, tweaked the menu, and we are hooked. \n\nMy drink of choice has been the watermelon lemonade. It is not the same as the 1st few times I got it. It was a very slushy watermelon drink, like put a watermelon in the blender, add some lemonade and voila. Its more watered down now which is unfortunate but I've been getting this with a shot of patron silver in it, and I really like it.\n\nMy husband usually gets the fish tacos, you can get beer battered or grilled or both. He goes between the both. I like the kobe beef tacos. \n\nThey have a habanero salsa you can ask for. Its not one of the 3 they bring out. Its VERY good, but very hot. I highly recommend everyone try this. \n\nWe usually sit in the bar. The service is great, its just a little more casual, they have 2 TV's set to some type of sports event and I think thats why we're in there.

There is a reason why another one was asked to open in Las vegas, same reason why any  other famous restuarant opens another flagship place in LV, bc it's DAMN GOOD.  Border Grill delivers.  I typically think mexican food is best served from a whole in a wall near the border with a questionably stolen grade A sign and full of grease fat and hot sauce.  However, this is one of the few upscale Mexican places I think pulls off delicous and unique yet tasteful dishes.  We got the sampler appeititizer which is the way to go if you want ot try a little bit of many things Border grill has to offer- including the famous Food Network's Too hot Tamales- which YES are very very good.  All the food is fresh and has a great upscale spin to the flavors.  Along with the view of Mandalay's pools, you sort of feel that you are smack in the middle of a Mexician riveria.  \n\nI think one major reason why I am SUCH a big Fan of Susan Feniger and her restuarants are the politics and community involvement she always has.  She doesn't just cook and make delicous food, but she is active in the food industry in its current revolution.  She makes an effort to be responsible to the enviroment and its resources by using organic or sustainble ingredients.  She is currently offering special priced dinner in LA where a portion of profits go to Scleroderma research.  She constantly offers moderate/affordable pricing to her food (like participating in Dine LA)- even in Vegas where every other restuarant is inflatted to Disneylandesque prices.  Best of all, she is an LGBT chef that always supports her local LGBT communties.   Ive never seen a chef so involved in her work that continues to care and give back.   It makes you feel like all she wants is to have her customers enjoy food and life as much as she does."

As we approached the restaurant, a neon sign hung underneath the Border Grill announcing \"REAL MEXICAN FOOD.\"  Already, that's a bad sign...  Anyway, here's a recap.  The food is very good, but certainly not worth the outrageous prices that are on the menu.  My wife and I both had one drink, guacamole and a main dish for just under $100.  The meal portions are a little on the small side (for Mexican food), but just right for anything else.  The ingredients are fresh but both meals appeared to be hurried with very little attention to detail.  The dining area is a bit cramped and if you are unlucky enough to sit next to people with children, then you will no doubt listen to the world's most fascinating conversations.  In the end, would I go back?  Definitely not.  There are some real great Mexican restaurants off the strip in Las Vegas, if you have a  car, please make the drive.

Our drink orders were taken and the fruit and guava pastry was brought out for us to enjoy. \n\nWe ordered just about everything off the brunch menu but here are a few of the notable items we tried. \n\nLoved: \n\n-GREEN CORN TAMALE (sweet corn * sour cream * salsa fresca) I'm a sucker for sweet corn tamales, so there really wasn't much I didn't love about this dish. \n-PERUVIAN SHRIMP AND GRITS (aji panca chile marinated shrimp * roasted poblano chiles creamy parmesan grits) - nice kick and flavor. \n-SKIRT STEAK AND EGG (egg cooked your way * crispy poblano potatoes) - My fella loved this dish so much he ordered it twice. The steak was cooked well and had a great texture. One of the highlights of the meal.\n-MACHACA CHILAQUILES (slow cooked beef brisket * crispy corn tortilla chips\nmexican cheeses * roasted chiles * egg cooked your way) - My mom's favorite dish. The brisket was moist and flavorful and the dish had a nice kick. Definitely a must order. \n-WAFFLE AND PORK BELLY WITH MAPLE SYRUP (french waffle * crispy pork belly * maple syrup) - This was one of my favorite dishes. Pork was cooked well and I really enjoyed the sweet and savory flavor combination. Big fan. \n\nLiked: \n\n-SHORT RIB HASH AND EGG (negra modelo braised beef short ribs * boniato yams * caramelized onions) - This dish was just ok. The short ribs were entirely too sweet and I had entirely too many onions for any of our tastes. \n-BREAKFAST FRIES (hand cut fries * crispy carnitas * chipotle hollandaise\njalape\u00f1o bacon * sunny side egg) - The carnitas were great and had a fantastic crisp to them. The flavors were amazing, but I wasn't a huge fan of the fries, wish they were crispier or had more flavor. \n-BREAD PUDDING FRENCH TOAST (caramelized bananas * coconut syrup) - This rendition of French toast is overly sweet, but still had nice flavor in moderation. Make sure you share this and order it for dessert. \nCRISPY POTATO RAJAS TACO (roasted potatoes and chiles * mexican cheeses\nguacamole * grilled corn relish * chipotle aioli) - Nice and spicy, definitely a good dish, if only it had some protein or meat in it to balance it out a bit more. \nLOBSTER PANCAKES (savory corn lobster pancake * chipotle sauce\nsunny side egg * crispy leeks) - This dish was enjoyable, not a lot of lobster in it and I wish the pancake had a fluffier texture, though. \n\nHated: \n\n-CHURRO TOTS (dulce de leche infused churros * cinnamon sugar * whipped cream) - This dish sounded amazing in theory, but when they arrived, they were hard little balls lacking flavor and texture. Definitely pass on these.\n-YUCATAN EGG BENEDICT (manchego cheese biscuit * yucatan roasted pork\nslow cooked egg * hollandaise sauce * pickled onions) - I can never resist an eggs benedict, the exception lies here. The cheese biscuit was overly doughy and pretty unappetizing. Nothing about this dish worked for me, which was disappointing. \n-BREAKFAST ENCHILADA (citrus chicken * guajillo sauce * mexican cheeses\nblack beans * fried egg) - This dish was the worst of the worst. First off, it came out cold. Nothing could be a bigger turn off. The flavor was meh and since it was cold we had no interest in delving further into it. \n\nOverall, my mom had a fantastic birthday meal and that's all I wanted from Border Grill and they definitely delivered all that and more. They even surprised my mom with a chocolate mousse cake to cap off a very nice brunch experience. I can't believe I've left if off my radar for so long in between visits. Make sure to get their rewards card if you're a local as they offer discounts!"

I'll start by saying the food was amazing, by far one of the best meals I've had in Vegas in a long time.\n\nI had the ceviche trio which was the serving size of a full order but split into three varieties.\n\nIf you only want to try one I'd recommend the baja ceviche it's very lemony which I loved and classic. But if you want a little spice but just as delicious go for the Peruvian ceviche.\n\nAlso tried the green corn tamales and although it's 3 small baby tamales I would order then again and again that's how tasty they were and I've had many corn tamales in my life.\n\nThe michelada complimented the ceviche nicely, I had a model instead of the tecate.\n\nThe carne asada quesadilla alone could fill you up with out the side of rice and beans which we did not try. The meat was very well cooked and tasty.\n\nAll around, I could eat here every day and be extremely happy which coming from me someone who doesn't like to eat the same meal or type of meal more than once a week it holds some weight.\n\nI recommend this to everyone!"

And while the food is probably a four star, I give it 5 stars for a few combined reasons. The food is pretty good, the drinks are great, but it is the uniqueness and the total package that this place offers that keeps me coming back. \n\nThese two Hot Tamales have taken certain aspects of the Mexican menu that you rarely get to see in the states and thrown them into this package of casual dining that is absolutely fantastic. It's not your typical run of the mill restaurant. The tortillas are freshly made as is the salsa. The green habanero salsa is my favorite and one of the best I've ever had. And I know my salsa. Don't get it twisted!\n\nYou'll find several dishes that you may find in some better restaurants in Mexico along with well executed traditional favorites. You won't see the slop of beans and rice that you see in most Mexican places that are actually run by Mexican families. That stuff to me is not good. I'd rather see more unique flavors that I'm familiar with but you don't traditionally see in restaurants. Needless to say, Border Grill keeps me coming back again, and again."

We had half of our party arrive late, drinks were ordered at all sorts of varying times, water had to constantly be refilled, we must have been such a pain! But it was all smiles from the staff, who were super attentive, made terrific recommendations, and handled requests seamlessly.\n\nThe food was really terrific. I think we had clean plates all around. I had the chicken enchiladas, which I devoured. Margaritas are well made and generous. And everyone went crazy over the salsas.

            "review": "Yup I'm a fan of this place. We made a reservation for a sunday brunch. It didn't seem that busy when we arrived but I still recommend to get a reservation so you get a spot for sure. I would rather come here than any other buffets in Vegas because you don't have to wait at all and it was quite good. \n\nSo we decided to try the all you can eat tapas menu which consist of 15(around) items which can vary from appetizers to entrees to desserts. Our awesome waiter was super helpful in telling us what was good and recommend we could do. Since we had a party of 8, he made it easier for us by simply putting it in a family style plate where 4 of us share and the other 4 share. The food really depends on you but I really recommend the Steak and eggs, breakfast fries, and the corn tamales. \n\nReason why I love the steak and eggs was because it was super flavorful and the steak was actually good quality(and it's all you can eat so go wild man). The breakfast fries were awesome in which it consist of every man's dream...bacon,short rib, fries, cheese, egg....like imagine that into bites of yummyness.  However these two items I mention are super deadly, so my personal favorite that is super light was the corn tamales. I personally think it's adorable how they wrapped the tamales. THey provide you with sour cream and salsa. It's not a lot in the tamales but it's really good and light. \n\nThen there was our awesome waiter, Mike, that was super attentive and friendly towards us. He made small talk, he helped us a lot with the menu, and I simply befriended him(I wasn't even drunk). So the extra star is for our waiter who made me enjoy my time at Border Grill A LOT more. \n\nThere it is people...I recommend giving it a try especially if you're not down to wait 2 hours for a damn buffet."

The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing, the staff was friendly, attentive and helpful, and the food was just plain amazing. We started with the traditional chips and salsa, which at Border Grill, is actually a sampler of three varieties of salsa.  All were fresh and delicious, but my favorite was to green tomatillo salsa.  It was bright and tangy with a great spicy kick. I order the brisket taquitos and my husband had the Yucutan pork. My taquitos were perfect-crispy without being greasy, full of delicious, flavorful beef and topped with just the right quantity of shredded lettuce, salsa, guacamole and sour cream.  The presentation was colorful and beautiful arranged with black beans flanked by petite portions of fabulous arroz verde and red spanish rice.\n\nMy husband's choice of the Yucatan pork, which he chose based on the server's recommendation, was also beautiful and delicious (of course I tried a bite!). The pork was tender, moist with a fascinating, complicated flavor that included orange and cinnamon. Served with plantains, rice and fresh corn tortillas, it was a meal to be remembered.\n\nIf I ever find myself in Las Vegas again I will definitely plan to visit Border Grill again!"

            "review": "I was lucky enough to go to the Santa Monica Border Grill back in 1995 while I was visiting some friends in L.A., and was blown away by it. I was at a conference in Las Vegas this last week, and I was happy to see that there was an outpost of the Border Grill there as well - of course I had to try it.\n\nI went during lunch one day, and had the guac to start, followed by the chicken chilaquiles. Whenever I am in Mexico, I try to eat chilaquiles for breakfast, so I was pleased to see them on the menu (even though it was lunch time). The chips were cooked well, but were RIDICULOUSLY salty. I though that maybe I had just received a bottom of the basket set (or something like that), so I asked for some new ones, but those were amazingly salty as well. Once I dusted a large amount of salt off the chips, though, they were good, as was the guacamole. The flavors were nicely blended, and they didn't skimp on the onion.\n\nThe chilaquiles were a disappointment, though. They were the \"green\" version (as opposed to red or, more rarely, mole chilaquiles), and the green salsa was very acidic. I like the flavor of tomatillos, but these almost tasted underripe, which made for a weird flavor mix with the queso fresco and the corn tortillas. The chicken in the dish came in big chunks of dry white meat, and didn't taste like it had been cooked with the rest of the chilaquiles ingredients at all.  It was very disappointing. For comparison, I was comped a free breakfast buffet at the Wynn, where they had what they called chilaquiles with eggs (really, it was more like a chilaquiles/migas hybrid) - the flavor profile of that dish was much more authentic than what I had at Border Grill. I know that people think highly of the Wynn buffet, but still, when the food at a restaurant that prides itself on authenticity is beaten by a buffet offering, that's a bad sign.\n\nI'll hang on to my good memories of the Border Grill in Santa Monica, but I won't be going back to the Vegas one again."

            "review": "Border Grill is located in Mandalay Bay, just down the hall from the wedding chapel.\n\nWhen I visited, my friends wanted to sit outside on the patio.  One plus is the patio outside is completely covered.  It's almost like a room with just the one wall to the outside missing.  So you get the breeze and the fresh air, but still feel like you're slightly indoors.  Also, the patio overlooks a pool with a stage and you can enjoy whatever live music may be playing.\n\nAnother plus is their menu has a lot of different and interesting items from which to choose.  I ordered chicken panuchos, which is black bean stuffed tortillas with chicken.  I've never seen black beans stuffed into the middle of a tortilla before, so that gave it a nice twist.  But unfortunately, the chicken was very dry.  I had to add A LOT of salsa to give it some moistness.   \n\nA couple of negatives.  The restaurant has this weird policy that they bring you their special filtered water and pour your glasses, and if they refill your glasses - then they charge you extra.  It's stated on their menu, but the problem I have is - why even bring the water without asking if the table wants it?  And the waiter didn't fill one of the glasses full, and although the person never touched the water - he filled it up to the top when he returned.  This meant we would have been charged, when he never even filled it all the way to begin with!  Sneaky?  You be the judge.\n\nThe other negative is, there is no restroom on site.  You have to go somewhere downstairs, which is a little ways to walk.  Instead, I went down the hall to the wedding chapel.  If you don't make eye contact with the receptionist, you can go in and the restroom is right there at the entrance :)"

There's a patio, but on cold December day it wasn't very popular.\n $34.99 per person gets you all you can eat brunch. Additional $10 gets you unlimited mimosas in like ten different flavors (or just champagne, which Is what I opted for). \n You order tapas style plates, as many as you want at a time, but word of warning- they are no joke, these aren't small bites but full blown entrees. \n We ordered skirt steak and eggs- amazing, cauliflower taquitos- delicious, eggs Benedict, breakfast fries, shrimp and grits, chorizo and egg tacos and were so stuffed, could not eat another bite for the rest of the day. Service was very quick and friendly, food came out lightning fast. Recommend to anyone looking for a brunch option."

She just started sending out plates of the best things on the brunch menu, and all of the food was so good.  They probably sent out 7 or 8 course of food and I liked everything that came out.  I also had a few blood orange-cayenne margaritas and had some shots of their house vanilla-pineapple tequila.  All of it was great.\n\nAlso, our group was doing the standard bachelorette party scavenger hunt and that staff was being such good sports about our antics.

Beautiful balance of flavors and textures.  \n\nVery well made ceviches The Baja (shrimp, fish, lime, tomato, and jalapeno aioli) a true standout.  The sweetness of the shrimp is accentuated by the fresh, acidic tartness of the lime.  The tomato provides a perfect bridge between the flavors.

The addition of pickled veg brightens the palate after every bite.\n\nVery weak selections of wine and beer.  Well designed selection of hand crafted, margaritas and mojitos.  Be very careful with the blood orange margarita.  Jalapeno in the drink and rimmed with spicy mole; it packs a very spicy punch.\n\nExcellent, friendly service.  \n\nPer the restaurant, the menu is being updated in the coming weeks so act fast for a last try of the favorites.\n\nRedemption."

While most of the reviews i've since read complain about the quality of the food matched with the high prices for Mexican food, I actually found this to be a respite from what we had become accustomed to during our stay. For once, I thought the two nearly equaled each other, although again, we've had much better.\n\nHad the fish tacos which were fine. The fish was grilled nicely, no bones, fresh cole-slaw on top. Nothing to really complain about. GF had some kind of pork sandwich which looked messy. She didn't seem too impressed as she didn't finish it and avoided the bread entirely. Good drinks to start (nice to see 'Chelada' on the menu) accompanied by warm, fresh chips and three types of salsa. Should have just stuck with that combo.\n\nWhat really distracted me from the experience once again was the service! This time it was the hostess. We were greeted and when I asked if we could sit outside she said she had 'nothing outside'. OK, well can we wait? I asked. Irritated glance and pissy attitude in full display, we were told we could wait at the bar. Fine by me. Then when she came by not 7 minutes later, she asked if I had settled my bill with the bartender, as if we were the ones holding her up.\n\nTo top it off, she seated us at the back of the patio when there were many more tables that had just been cleared which overlooked the pool area. It later became apparent that she was either holding these tables for friends or for those who were willing to shell out for the extended service. Oh, and she didn't give us menus. The waitress had to go back and get them. Nice job."

Quick review: if you know anything about how Mexican (or even Tex/Cali Mex) should taste, don't eat here.\n\nThe restaurant is contemporary, while not as large as many other strip restaurants, it was a good size and relatively busy, even at an off time. The service from the waiter we had was good. \n\nThe chips and salsa were not bad. I preferred the tomato over the chipotle flavor, and the tomatillo offering was pretty good as well. The chips were warm and tasty. \n\nI ordered the chicken quesadilla, my husband steak nachos. Neither of us considered our entrees to be edible. \n\nThe chicken in my quesadilla was grey and gristly. The cheese, described as \"manchego, panela, cotija cheeses\" was dry and crumbly. Unsure how any kind of cooked cheese maintains such a texture. Even though the tortillas were rather good,  I could not stomach more than one bite. \n\nMy husband's nachos were also unappetizing. The steak was rubbery and he was unimpressed that the sauces were out of a squeeze bottle. The cheese are described simply as \"mexican\" for this dish, but were the same dry, crumbly variety that were in the quesadilla. \n\nWe spoke to the waiter about or dissatisfaction with the meal and he removed the plates. A manager came by and asked what was wrong with them and after our explanation, told me the chicken was grilled Mexican style (which is why it was grey?) and that they use Mexican cheeses, but they serve more Americanized Mexican food."

The service here was incredibly fast, it was almost scary. They bring out chips and several salsas when you first arrive, but you could ask for an extra spicy one that will really make you sweat. \n\nWhen you check-in, you get complimentary corn tamales. They were ridiculously sweet and I personally would have liked them more for dessert, but I usually don't eat tamales so maybe you have to get used to the taste. \n\nI had one of the best quesadillas here. The tortilla was fresh and handmade, the cheese was perfectly melty, and the vegetables like zucchini completed the dish very well.\n\nHowever, the enchiladas were bland and overpriced, and I really expected more. Even though it comes drenched in this green sauce, I feel like they forgot to add any sort of spices, or even salt and pepper.  On top of that, it was the most expensive thing we ordered and was not filling at all. \n\nWe finished off with \"milk and cookies\". The milk is actually a rich, thick, vanilla ice cream which was amazing, but the cookies aren't traditional chocolate chip.\n\nThe service here was friendly and fast, so 5 stars for that but the food itself disappointing."

            "review": "We've now visited Border Grill for dinner, for lunch, and for tapas-style unlimited brunch, and I think it's time to stand up and applaud this inventive and tasty spin on Mexican cuisine.\n\nI don't know that BG will be to everyone's taste, but it's unique enough that anyone who likes Mexican food should try it.\n\nIf you're a vegetarian, go for the brunch \"buffet.\" $25/pp gets you all the small plates you can eat, but it's not the price or the endless-eating that's the draw for me. It's the potato tacos served \"rajas\" style - onion, cheese, chile, and maybe a touch of crema? For some reason these aren't available on the lunch menu with all of the other taco offerings, a serious oversight.\n\nThe coconut French toast is as good as it sounds (and bigger than you'd expect). Brunch also has our staple appetizer, the plantain empanada. These are bold in taste and easy to inhale, although if you prefer a firmer empanada you might be disappointed.\n\nLikewise on the green corn tamale, which instead of a firm slab is more like a sweet-yet-savoury oatmeal neatly tied up in a husk. It sounds kind of iffy, I know, and if you love (traditional?) firm tamales (as I do), you will be surprised, but one of these with a little of the bitey, tangy, pico de gallo is just a perfect, nuanced addition to the parade of brunch dishes. (When we ordered the tamales as an appetizer with lunch, we found ourselves less interested in eating more than one, though.)\n\nEven though I claim to love all empanadas, the guava jam empanada was a little too coarse/dense for me, and the guava flavour seemed to make a counterpoint to sing out. The waitstaff suggests these for starters because they have them ready to go, and I was glad we had them early on, so everything afterward was that much better.\n\nThe fruit plate sounds boring, I know, but it's another \"ready right then\" item at brunch, and the passion fruit sauce is quite captivating. I almost ordered another one (but there was so much else to try).\n\nThe huevo ranchero was a little ordinary but good in taste, but it was so pretty that I didn't mind.\n\nEven at brunch you still get chips and salsa. I don't really know how to describe these. They're not my favourite in town, but they're a little different from the usual and therefore interesting.\n\nFor lunch I get the poblano quesadilla off the appetizer menu, a concoction that vanquishes any worries that one is settling for some tired variant of cheese + bread. The cheese combination is exciting (sturdy manchego, melty panela, and tart, dry cotija), but the roasted peppers are just as much a star, and I've already sung the praises of the salsa. (I could just eat it by the spoonful. Soup spoonful-size, even.)\n\nThe only other \"substantial\" veg option for lunch is the chile relleno, which I instinctively avoid, having had too many oily, unmanageable, flavour-free chile rellenos in my life that would've been right at home at a carnival. (Not even good enough for a state fair.) But BG has impressed me so much that I think next time I'll give it a go.\n\nFor dinner there is one vegetarian main dish - the portabello mushroom mulitas. I would describe it as a huge pile of mushrooms, peppers, beans, onion, and sauce that somehow works. It's not something I've craved since, but again, it's unique enough that I wouldn't mind having it again at about half the size and half the price. BG boasts of its pro-environment position and its quality ingredients, which shows in that even the less interesting items are worth trying.\n\nSave room for the flourless chocolate cake. It is angelic. How can anything be so light yet so packed with everything I like about chocolate and cake at the same time?\n\nDrink service (soft drinks for us) is steady, with our bottle of table water always being replenished before it's empty. One of the best/worst decisions I've made here is to order the seasonal watermelon lemonade. It's toooo good, and my frugal side won't let me get refills.\n\nThe staff is always friendly at BG, and if you're a local, you can join their club and get a discount card for all future meals. (I think it's 10% off?)\n\nWe've only ever sat indoors at the tables, but these are so comfortable that we've never bothered to ask for a half-booth. The noise level is average, with all of the bar action in a side room.\n\nI'm docking a star because I think BG, especially with its earth-friendly stance - needs to add potato tacos to the daily taco line-up for lunch, and I think they need one more vegetarian main item for dinner. The mulitas are ambitious and tasty, but for me they get dull and repetitive after four bites. I'm grateful not to have to settle for cheese enchiladas, sure, but some kind of enchilada for vegetarians done in the polished, creative BG-style is something I'd really like to see."

            "review": "Border Grill is now serving brunch!  I love a good breakfast - and they do it right by me.  Brunch is served as a tapas menu, perfect for trying a little bit of everything.  For $29.95 you can get an 'all you can eat' brunch with champagne - or pomegranate mimosas as I had (delicious, by the way).  There is nothing wrong with eating chips and salsa at 10 o'clock in the morning - especially their fresh, homemade varieties Border Grill has to offer, my favorite being the salsa Verde -  it is so flavorful.  Make sure to ask for the spicy salsa if they don't bring it automatically, it is amazing too.\n\nThe tapas menu is a great idea to try a bit of everything and not get too full off just one item - the waiter will take about 2-3 orders at a time, and spread the delivery out so you are not overwhelmed with food on the table.  With the menu consisting of about 15 or so items, it is perfect for a variety of flavors to start your day.\n\nFor starters, I had the Eggs Benedict.  Now, this is not your average Eggs Benny by any stretch of the imagination.  Instead of an English Muffin, they use a light and fluffy biscuit topped with Yucatan pork, a poached egg, fresh Hollandaise sauce and pickled onions.  Heaven.  \n\nNext on the list was Steak and Eggs.  I have honestly never ordered this as a breakfast item - so I figured it was time to try it.  The tender carne asada was sliced thin, but not too thin, sitting on top of a poblano potato pancake and an egg (over medium for me please) sitting on top.  I will never be able to order Steak and Eggs any where else now.  \n\nI tried the Shrimp BLT - sounds more lunch-y, but hey, where there is shrimp, so am I.  The bread was sliced thin, which was great since by this point, I am already starting to get full. Inside lies shrimp, bacon, lettuce and tomatoes, all seasoned to perfection.  \n\nMy friend ordered Coconut French Toast.  I am not a French Toast or coconut fan (which is why she ordered it..)  Although, it was actually pretty darn good - this consisted of Sourdough bread, coconut syrup and saut\u00e9ed bananas.  Sweet, but not too much, a definite surprise - I might even order it on my own next time.\n\nThe Green Corn Tamale came out next - and dear Lord - if I could eat this at every meal, I would.  Trust me.  The presentation is great, part of it is in a tamale 'purse' - the other part served along side sour cream and fresh pico de gallo. Yummy.  \n\nWe also ordered the fresh fruit they were offering on the brunch menu.  The fruit was perfectly in season with a drizzle of passion fruit sauce.  Oh My.  \n\nBesides the food being excellent, the service is something that is outstanding as well.  Every wait staff member knows the menu inside and out, has great recommendations, and provides a level of service that you will remember almost as much as the food itself.  Good customer service will never go out of style, and as far as I am concerned, neither will this Brunch. Border Grill nailed it, again."

I thought for sure the enchiladas wouldn't fill me up w/out rice or beans but I was wrong. 1 enchilada in and I was ready to burst. It may have been the hot chips and awesome salsa but either way those enchiladas were amazing ! Handmade thick corn tortillas stuffed with shredded, smoked chicken breast then covered in green salsa and cheese and this to DIE FOR corn, mushroom, raja mix. \nI will definitley be back and definitley try another dish. \nJob well done Susan!"

Autumn was so genuine and nice, even though we got here later, and stayed way past the closing time.\n\nWe will definitely be back and recommend Border Grill to our family and friends! :)"

We were expecting a nicer Mexican restaurant considering the prices and food discriptions - but I was less than wowed.\n\nWhile the waitstaff was nice, the service was very slow.  We waited about 15 minutes for our drinks.  Dinner wasn't great either.\n\nI had the Mexican Chopped Salad which is supposed to include red peppers, tomato, apple, beans, onion, corn, avacado and lettuce.  When they brought it to me I literally thought it was the wrong dish because all I could see was lettuce and chicken.  There were no apples or peppers and a sprinking (I mean like 10 kernals) of corn and beans.  It was laughable and NOT worth $17.\n\n2 girls ordered the Turkey Tostada, which was a cute presentation on two small corn tortillas, but they complained that the turkey was overwhelmingly salty, and avoided it all together.\n\nOthers liked the quesadillas and drinks were good, which is why I give this review 1-2 stars.\n\nHad the menu been more appropriately priced I wouldn't have been as annoyed - but I could have found a MUCH better meal for $30 somewhere else.  \n\nWho knew a head of lettuce and a glass of wine could eat up so much money!? ... I should've put it into slot machines, that would've been less of a throw away :)"

It's just the way it is. I was in town for a week for work and stayed at Mandalay Bay. The whole week was a struggle to find edible food. \n\nOn my last day I used my remaining Manadalay gift card to go to brunch at the Border Grill. It is $35 for unlimited small plates. Definitely not cheap, but by Vegas standards not bad at all. \n\nWe were seated on the back patio which was nice since it was a warm day. The patio is fairly deep though so you don't get sun or views of the pool area. \n\nThe waiter explained how things worked and asked what we wanted to start with. Basically, the tapas are all bottomless. You order whatever you want and keep ordering till you can't any more. If you don't like something, don't eat it. They do ask that you order 2 or 3 at a time, I assume so people aren't wasteful. \n\nWe had so many small plates while we were here. The great thing is that most are vegetarian so I didn't have to hunt through the fine print on the menu to eat. \n\nThe favorites:\n\n- Cauliflower Taquito: amazing! Crispy cauliflower, spicy avocado sauce and jicama slaw. The flavors all came together to be the best thing I had all week. The sauce does have a nice kick to it so be prepared. \n\n- Green Corn Tamales: these were unique from other tamales as they were more cream corn like on the inside, no masa. The flavor was quite good though and very creamy. \n\n- Churro Tots: my favorite of the sweet items. These were chocolate filled and covered in cinnamon sugar. Little bundles of joy. Yum. \n\nWe also liked the special waffle of the day which was berry and pear. The waiter recommended this to us when he heard we were vegetarian (this was appreciated). The yogurt parfait was also good in flavor and a nice light plate amongst some the heavier stuff. \n\nI did not like the tomatillo egg benedict. It just had an odd after taste and I did not enjoy the grits or hollandaise.  \n\nI would go back here just for the cauliflower taquitos. I'm not sure if they are on the main menu, but go at brunch and just order them again and again. You won't be sorry."

I stopped here the last day of my stay in Vegas, after walking past every day of the previous 4, and thinking it looked nice. And it was.\n\nI had the shrimp and chorizo taquitos, which were tasty but a little schizophrenic. The shrimp and chorizo was an odd (but good) combination, even if neither are particularly strong, but the three taquitos were served \"glued\" to the plate by some good tangy guac...topped with a sweet lobster cream sauce...and then with a vinegar dressed cabbage salad with roasted corn. Lots of stuff going on here, and all of it is good, but it's a lot of fighting flavors. Not that I didn't eat all of it, mind you. That wasn't a problem.\n\nI will say their outdoor patio is nice - I was there on a very nice day, and it was really pleasant to sit outside, look out over the pool, and watch nearly tame finches dart amongst the tables, swooping in to grab the tortilla chips I kept tossing on the ground, and anything people left behind at the table for anything more than a microsecond. I found myself very contented. If I was back, and I was close, I would probably go back for a nothing special type of meal when I want up for anything requiring more effort. But I don't know if it'd make a journey for it, especially considering everything else I've eaten this week."

There was a tomtailo, red chile, and a smoked chipolte. All 3 were good. The chips were a little greasy but were still good. They were made from thick homemade tortillas and were crispy. \n\nThe enchilada dish arrived promptly, and the presentation was very well executed. The plate had a base of the chipotle sauce with streaks of cream streaked through the sauce. The three chicken enchiladas were topped with a corn salas which consisted of asparagus that had been thinly sliced and cooked just till tender. There were also slices of Ancho chiles, corn and onion in the salad. This was topped with the string cheese.\n\nThe Chicken Enchilada's were made of homemade corn tortillas, rolled around the chicken and cheese mixture. This dish might have been the best enchilada dish I've every had, except for at Orlando's in Taos, New Mexico. The thick tortilla and the chicken mixture had just the right texture and flavor. \n\nThe restaurant advertises themselves as Real Mexican, it is not the standard Tex-Mex fair. The restaurant was created by Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger. They had a Food Network show called The Two Hot Tamales when the network was still new. I still have some of their recipes. I would give this restaurant a must visit while in Las Vegas."

I am permanently disabled and walk with a cane with constant pain. I was walking from the convention center and food court area to the casino. I was stopped by a security guard at the Border Grill due to some ongoing floor reconstruction. Rather than telling me where I could pass, I had to ask the guard, \"Where do I go?\" She sat there on her wide butt and pointed to a steep long staircase headed downward. It should have already been quite apparent to her that I was in no condition to maneuver those steps. I then asked her how could I get down there, alluding to my obvious disability. She went on and on about an elevator, a walkway downstairs, and an escalator. But her description was unclear as it was obvious that she couldn't care less about my issue.\n\nAfter about 10 or 15 minutes of wandering around trying to find where to go, I finally ended up finding a hotel employee who helped me find my way. It was a LONG walk around. No reason existed for me to even have gone down that long hallway in the first place. No signs were posted, no detour was shown. Just, \"Good luck, disabled folks! You don't matter!\" I was furious. This was not right. So, as I entered the area that finally got me downstairs below the restaurant, I told the security guard I saw about the problem. He told me to go tell the Manager at Border Grill. So, I did. Here's where my day was brightened. \n\nI approached the Manager, who was at their \"Back Door\" entrance. I told her the whole story. She seemed very concerned. However, I still wasn't feeling as though they were going to make any changes or improvements. So, I specifically asked that they find a way to divert the folks who have mobility issues so they can not go through what I just went through. She looked me right in the eye and said she'd handle it. Then, she asked if I wanted lunch. I told her, \"No, I'm just walking through getting a little exercise. I just wanted to be sure nobody else has to go through that\" She again offered me lunch and a drink, almost pulling me inside the restaurant. So, I accepted her kind offer. \n\nNow to the food! LOL. I had some chips and salsa (three kinds: two red, one green) and guacamole to start. It was delicious, and had good spices. I also had a \"Mexican Mojito,\" which really kicked some butt. Then the chile relleno burger came. OMG - just look for yourself - I posted a photo here. Not only was it ridiculously huge, it was awesomely delicious as well. The fries were skin-on and fried just right, too. I barely got through half the plate. But, I did finish that drink! All-in-all a great meal. Comfortable porch-like atmosphere downstairs, too. I wasn't even aware that the Border Grill had a downstairs until this. Great service, great food, and now the best part. \n\nThe manager (I wish I remembered her name!) came back to me near the end of my meal. She told me they are using their in-house elevator to divert disabled people around the construction. This eliminated a very long walk around that mess. Now, they can just go into the restaurant, take the elevator, and be where they need to be to get to the casino. Viola - problem recognized AND resolved within the time it took me to half-eat my free lunch. Now, THAT'S real service. They didn't have to do any of that. They could have just said, \"OK\" and left it at that; which is what I expected considering the first person (stupid lazy guard) I dealt with on this issue. But, that lady made my day. Not for the free lunch. I wasn't even that hungry. But for the kindness and consideration she had, and for having implemented an immediate fix. I'm impressed. Great job! Great food! Great service! Thanks!"

We went on a Friday night and was surprised to find only a few occupied tables. The hostess was very friendly and pretty much let us choose our table. She did, however, recommended sitting poolside and in hindsight I think the upstairs patio would have had better ambiance. Nevertheless it was still beautiful and extremely peaceful. The sangria was refreshing and added to the mood. For dinner I ordered the grilled fish tacos with avocado crema. The fish was delicious; very light and fresh. I wasn't a fan of the green rice but it was fine because the meal was also served with a tomato rice. I wouldn't say there was anything extraordinary about this restaurant but I enjoyed my meal and left completely satisfied."

I had lunch here today and have had dinner here about 3 or 4 times even before Susan Feniger was on Top Chef Masters but now I have a better idea of why the food is so good!  I had the shrimp fajita tacos on their specials menu.  Delicious!  The shrimp were so juicy with a hint of spice.  We also had the pork tacos which were also amazing.  The pork is cooked for 3-4 hours which makes it very tender.  We also had the chicken enchiladas and fish tacos.  If you like spicy ask for the diablo sauce which is a habanero salsa.  \nThe specialty drinks are dangerously good.  Sometimes they have the pozole soup on special which is amazing.

You can get that for literally no more than $3.75 at any taqueria ever.

I know its Vegas but if you are going to pay $10 for guacamole at least give me one whole avocados worth of dip!! \n\nThe tacos were VERY SMALL, they are more like street tacos, so if you are looking for big portions do not order this. However they were very tasty! The nachos were probably the biggest hit at the table. The crab and steak ones were tasty and plentiful, you could share these with two people. \n\nThe service was also very slow and not what you would expect at a resort like Mandalay Bay!

We decided to take a wander to see what deliciousness awaits us in this gastronomic wonderland that is the strip.  Not wanting to stray too far from the Expo Hall, we settled on the Border Grill, which - the sign will tell you - was featured on Top Chef Masters, or at least the chef was, or something like that.\n\nSo I was expecting top notch food - after all, that's what you would expect from someone who has been featured on Top Chef Masters.  Alas, the fame must have gotten to her head - either that or she has decided to quit her day job, because the food was really average.\n\nBut we are getting ahead of ourselves.  First off, where is it - It's in the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino complex, relatively near to the convention center.  The atmosphere can only be described as \"the same as the rest of the place - hectic, frantic, please I just want a quiet place to eat lunch!\"  \n\nThe efficient staff poured us water into the cute wine glasses (I'd prefer a bigger glass and some ice, personally - alas, it was not to be).  After a while, we ordered - I ordered some nice guacamole and a Chicken Poblano Torta with fries.  Nothing special - just the basics.\n\nWe got the chips - cold - and three different types of salsa, in bowls so shallow that we could hardly scoop.  Nice enough, but very very average.  Then the guacamole came.  Ok - this stuff is a little bit above the average, but you want HOW MUCH for this Guacamole?  NINE BUCKS?  Seriously underwhelmed here.  Maybe we are being punished for not being comped.\n\nThe Poblano Chicken Torta was alright - average.  The chicken was well cooked, and the poblano was spicy, so it was a good sandwich, but you want HOW MUCH for this sandwich?  It isn't really a Torta, so we'll call it a sandwich from now on.  $19 for that?  Oh, and the fries were cold as well.\n\nSeriously, folks, if this is the best that a Top Chef Master can do, I'm disappointed.  I can get this quality from somewhere else for quarter of the cost and still be satisfied."

I think for it being AYCE and having unlimited mimosas for a few extra bucks it is not a bad option. However, it is still just sitting at \"okay\" for me based off of a second experience.\n\nSince I had come here last (2012) they have upped all their prices. What used to be $5 for bottomless mimosas is now $10 (BIG price jump). And what used to be $29.99 AYCE is now $34.99 AYCE. Again, another big price jump.\n\nAs for the food and what I had....\n\nChorizo & Egg Taco - Still good, and still one of the better plates on the menu.\n\nChilaquiles - OK. I've had better elsewhere.\n\nBananas Foster  Crepe - Not good. Came out luke-warm, and not tasty.\n\nSalmon Slider - Very good. Salmon smoked nicely, and with the jalapeno bacon and goat cheese, with some spicy sauce, it was delicious. Only down side? The bun was dry.\n\nEggs Benedict with pork on a biscuit (can't remember the name) - Was actually good, with an over-easy egg to break into the biscuit, mixed with the slow-cooked pork inside was a good combo, but the biscuit was over-powering the meat. Smaller biscuit, or more meat please (more meat would be better).\n\nI did not indulge in mimosas, however my friend did and they have quite the array of flavors. Although she seemed to enjoy the Peach flavor the most. I did have endless cups of coffee, which is served with sugar and cream.\n\nService was attentive and congenial, but food was slow to arrive, and some plates went missing, only to appear because our server had to go hunt and find them.\n\nOverall I think I may have had my fill of Border Grill Brunch and I will have to branch out and find a brunch in Las Vegas that fulfills my needs better."

Small plates have become just about my favorite thing in Vegas, mostly because I'm gluttonous, but also because I like to try all the different flavors. Brunch seemed to be the best use of my certificate!\n\nWe were seated immediately overlooking the pools--what a cool view! Our server came by and took drink orders. My friend who was flying out that day ordered bottomless mimosas, and I, her trusty chauffer, went for the minty lime \"refresher\" that was basically a mojito without booze or simple syrup. It was delicious and its title as a refresher was apt. We ordered a few to start, but the server informed us that he would be sending some things our way as well.\n\nWe ended up trying nearly every small plate on the menu. Standouts for us were the rajas taco, shrimp and grits, breakfast enchilada, biscuit and gravy, french toast/bread pudding, Oaxacan pancakes, egg benedict, and the fresh fruit with the passion fruit sauce. (I just basically listed the whole menu for good ones. Not so much were the plantain, black bean and cheese empanadas (they were straight up weird) and the jalepeno PBJ (again, weird, and somehow misses the mark). The PBJ was served on a little biscuit with an egg, bacon, peanut butter, jelly,  and raw jalepenos. It didn't work for me. When we started ordering, the server asked how we wanted our eggs prepared for egg dishes, and so it was assumed that I wanted an over easy egg for the PBJ--I think maybe scrambled would have worked better? But I wasn't entirely sold on the flavor combination.\n\nI deducted a star for the cramped seating on the patio. Every time I moved outside my little box to put on a sweater or stretch my arms, I felt like there was a server or server assistant right behind me. I watched Phineas and Ferb on a girl's cell phone with remarkable clarity two tables away. It was too close and I couldn't imagine being a server there with alllll those plates to get out. They did it all amazingly, though I wish there was a little more space for dining.\n\nI want to try the other meals here!

We make it a point to stop and eat here.  However, this year I knew something was different just by the looks of the crowd.  Usually it's packed and not easy to get a reservation.  Not this year.  The bar still had seats most days and there wasn't much of a wait for dinner.\n\nDinner was below mediocre.  I ordered the Roasted chicken.  From the time the wait brought my plate I could see the chicken was more like \"Fried\".  So I asked him how was this prepared cause it seems so over cooked.  He said it should be slightly crispy and moist inside.  Well that was not the case here.  The chicken was so over cooked I didn't even finish it.  The server never came back to ask if I wanted something else, nor did he apologize that I didn't perhaps enjoy it.  Others ordered skirt steak and chicken enchiladas.  We all agreed this wasn't the same food we have had in previous years.\n\nFried plantain's and Chips/salsa were about the best thing we ate."

Everything is home made in the restaurant and fresh.  We tried the guacamole both times and it was so yummy.  We ordered Margaritas and the red wine sangria.  For lunch we split the pork carnitas (shredded pork) and it came with rice and black beans.  The pork was cooked well, but it wasn't shredded but cubed.  I thought it would have been shredded already.  Besides that, it was very good.  For dinner we each had the skirt steak and that came with beans, tomato and cucumber salad, and an amazingly delicious handmade tortilla.  The steak was cooked and seasoned well.  The sides (salad and beans) were awesome!  But the best part of it was actually the handmade tortilla.  When you wrapped the steak, beans, and tomato in the tortilla that really made it.  The ambiance was so-so, they need to figure out how to give it a better atmosphere.  The lights were too bright and the way the dining room was set up was awkward.  The prices were a bit higher than I care to spend at any Mexican restaurant, but its Vegas.  I'd go back for lunch or dinner if I am in the Mandalay Bay hotel again."

            "review": "We made Valentine reservation arrangements weeks before through the Mandalay Bay resort (on site).  Our party of 5 was originally seated inside a loud, unimpressive part of the restaurant. They were kind enough to honor our request to be seated outside (which we said we would gladly wait for) only to be placed in a back corner facing construction drapes and pvc fencing.  Our server was very polite but told us (after getting to know him) they were understaffed due to several call-ins. We chose the \"family style\" service where our server brought out several plates for our party to work on.  Every single one of them was cold, luke-warm at best!  You could tell they were flavorable, but all was lost on the cool temp.  One example was the cauliflower taquitos, raved about by other guests, which were stone cold in their center.  We brought  it to our server's attention to which he apologized and said he would tell the chef.  Frankly our mimosa glasses went empty often as we must have been forgotten sitting in the construction zone.  However, we powered on and tried other items on the menu at our server's urging.  Alas the food arrived (cold again) and the frustration continued.\n\nThe server informed the manager (not at our request) who apologized profusely and credited our bill 20% and several of the champagne extra charges (which we made certain to get plenty of, sampling all the different mimosa blends on the menu.)\n\nSo, unfortunately I cannot recommend Border Grill based on our experience. I would be reluctant to return as there are many other alternatives for Sunday Brunch in Vegas."

Getting to the restaurant was a little confusing as I have a hard time making my way around casinos and it was located more in the convention and shark reef area. We arrived for our reservation and requested patio seating, it was nice to look outside but it was more enclosed than I would have preferred! Our server, such a nice girl I wish I remembered her name, explained the menu and got us started right away on our $10 bottomless mimosas which she suggested we try one of each. She was so nice and attentive always making sure our glasses were full, our orders were taken, and not rushing us one bit. Brunch is $34.99 all-you-can-eat with a menu of tasty items you can pick one of each of or re-ordering your favorites. We tried just about every item and every mimosa and were not disappointed."

            "review": "This review is for Sunday brunch menu. Came here on the recommendation of our server from Verandah when we were there for RW. Brunch is my favorite meal, and this was so disappointing.  We had a reservation for the patio, which was basically a fully covered seating area with one half of it open, wouldn't exactly call it a patio. The brunch menu is tapas style, all you can eat for $29.99, and you can add bottomless mimosas for $5. There was about 18 items on the menu, and since there was 3 of us we decided to just try everything and go down the menu. Brunch was started with fresh fruit that was drizzled with some kind of mango sauce and also guava empanadas (fresh fruit would have been great without the sauce on top). I started noticing a theme after the first 4 dishes came out. Everything was so sweet and heavily sauced. The Green Corn Tamale was so sweet each of us could only handle two bites, the Mexican Rice Pudding Parfait (I love rice pudding) was so overpowered my the taste of cinnamon it wasn't edible. The Bacon Jalapeno PBJ intrigued me, I am really into wierd food combinations, this was basically Jiffy PB & grape jelly thrown on a biscuit. No points. The Peruvian Shrimp & Grits I was excited about as well, but the grits were stuck together and hard like they had been sitting prepared for awhile. The Yucatan Eggs Benedict had shredded pork, again I we tasted was cinnamon, we asked if there was a mole sauce on it and our waitress said no, it was what the meat was marinated in. I came to the conclusion that the ingredients they use were sub par, so having to marinate the meats to cover the meat is what they do. Pork shouldn't need a lot of added marinate. The only item that the 3 of us actually finished was the Skirt Steak & Egg and the Huevos Rancheros. Pretty bad odds out of 18 dishes. On to the $5 bottomless mimosas, I should have known not to go there, they offered 5 different flavors to add to the champagne, we each tried them and couldn't finish any. I mean I know they aren't serving PJ but rather Korbel....I had the worst headache for the rest of the day after that crap. Have you ever felt so gross and swollen and lethargic after eating a terrible meal? Well this is exactly how I felt. \nIf you're looking for a Spanish style brunch, check out Firefly's brunch."

A manager arrived but offered no explanation. She offered to have items remade but, let's face it, once you eat a cold runny egg you're kinda done.

You won't be disappointed, and due to the way it's served, you can get all you can eat without worrying about the previous guess sneezing on your eggs.\n\nWould have never tried it due to location, but got a comp to eat at Border Grill Brunch in Mandalay. It's not a \"buffet\" brunch, but a tapas all you can eat for $29.99 and you can add all you can drink Mimosas for $5 (of various flavors), where they bring you tiny little plates of some of the tastiest Baja/Northern Mexican breakfast food I've ever had. Not to be missed were the Chilaquiles, the Plantain Empanada, and the Short Rib Hash and Egg. I live in Seattle, but miss the food I used to get at hole in the wall places readily in San Diego and Los Angeles. This comes mighty close, and the outdoor patio overlooks the pool area which can make for some...amusing...people watching.\n\nWARNING: This is Cali/Zona border.  This is not Tex Mex.  I read so many reviews saying things like \"Lack of BBQ\" or \"Not really Mexican\".  Mexico has regional cuisine, just like the US or any other land mass.  Just because it's not what \"YOU\" consider to be border food or Mexcian food, doesn't mean it isn't... Baja is not the same as Gulf.  Yucutan is not the same as Oaxacan.  This is more of the NorthWestern/Baja Mexican.  Go in knowing that, and you'll be fine!\n\nI may have stumbled upon it due to a comp as a first timer, but from here on out, it'll be the one \"lock\" on all my future Vegas trips."

It is the last eating establishment along restaurant row. a few of us were already hesitant about eating at a mexican restaurant in section that also has a wolf gang puck's trattoria, red square, fleur de lys,  michael mina's strip steak, etc.   \nthe decor of this restaurant was outstanding.  the vibrant yellow and orange painted walls decorated with mexican art brightened the whole restaurant in the evening.  i was very surprised at the size of the restaurant.  it has actually two levels with the lower level accommodating larger parties of 6 or more.  the lower level connects to some outdoor seating, which i look forward to taking my lovely dining companion on the milder vegas nights for some drinks.  \nwe started off on some homemade tortilla chips that had just the right amount of saltiness.   it was complimented so well with the salsa roja and salsa verde.  one of the other red salsas had a fruity tinge to it, but   not strong enough to be identified, so it was uninteresting.  we also ordered guacamole, which was a little more bland than i usually like.   they were generous on the avocado, but i think they could have done a better job in adding some more kick (spice, tanginess, saltiness).\nwhen the waiter mentioned that the Cochinita Pibil was a southern mexican specialty that is rarely found in menus here in the U.S., i immediately knew that i had to order that dish.  basically, it is a specially marinated pork that has been slow roasted with or in banana leaf with cinnamon and grilled onions.  it was accompanied by black beans, rice, and plantains with orange salsa on the side.   sounds yummy, unfortunately after i gave the first bite to the GF, she immediately let me know that i could have the rest of the bite.  i said to myself, \"OH NO could it be that BAD?\"  i was disappointed at how tough the pork was and how the whole dish lacked any zest.  maybe the tortilla to wrap the meat took away the flavor, or the onions and banana leaf muffled some of the flavors away.  either way, the GFs grilled skirt steak was a lot more tastier.  she ordered it rare and you can actually taste the marinate of garlic, cilantro, cumin, and lime.  she found that her taste buds loved in the beginning and was bored with it towards the end.  i also loved eating her charred corn relish,\ni will have to be honest that the price for our meals were a bit high ~$80/2 people for mexican food.  there are tons of other great mexican restaurants/taquerias in las vegas that are much cheaper and better tasting.  i will have to admit that i will return for drinks.  the mojitos (regular or mango) are very delicious.  ask the GF!!!  they were extra sweet, very refreshing, with a minty bite.  they also have caipirinha (a brazilian concoction, which lacked the tang that i was used to).  i yet have to find this drink anywhere else in vegas."

It's a good bet if you're looking for a nice place to have dinner, its a good mix of laid back/fancy.  The few times I've been here I've tried the fish tacos which are thoroughly enjoyable but probably not worth the 23 dollars they charge, the chicken enchiladas which are delicious but for 26$? But its the strip so what did I expect right... I've also had the the market veggie quesadilla which is tasty, cheaper, and a good choice if you're vegetarian.  Bottom line this place is worth a visit if you're in the area but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for it.  A lot of their reviews seem to be for their brunch so maybe that's where its at, to be honest they probably deserve 3.5 stars but oh well"

I came for a early lunch hoping to snag a nice patio seat but quickly realized IBM and the Rodeo was in town and the restaurant was packed. I was forced to sit at the bar which doesn't bother me to much. I ordered one of there signature margaritas and the guacamole. Now as for the margarita, it sucked. Tasted like sugar water and defiantly not worth the hefty price tag they put on those \"Signature\" margaritas. One thing I hate the most is when bars feel the cup with ice to the very top so you get little drink. But anyways, onto the guacamole. Very fresh tasting and tasted like your normal guacamole. Nothing special nothing bad but a overall good dish! \n\nI went with there Border Classics dish which consists of two green corn tamales, two plantain empanadas, and two chicken panuchos. The green corn tamales weren't bad but not good. Where do they get the green from? It was basically cream corn inside and very little of it. The two plantains were good. Filled with smashed black beans and poblano peppers with cotija cheese on top. Had a nice kick to it which I like. Not to much cheese which a lot of mexican restaurants seem to do. Next were the chicken panuchos which were my favorite. Loaded with citrus roasted chicken, guacamole, and pickled onions all on top of a black bean stuffed tortillas. Now I was a little confused because the tortillas were just plain fried tortillas. Where the heck are the black beans? Maybe a fairy came a long and took my green and my black beans. Hmmm. But they were still good. The chicken cooked perfect with a nice citrus tasted that was really good and not over powering. \n\nService was as good as you can get at a bar. Overall this place is nothing special and I think food network needs to keep some of there Chefs on TV and not in the kitchen."

Mexican food is always a hit, and I particularly enjoy it, so I was really pleased when the birthday girl suggested it! She'd been here on a previous trip to Vegas and recommended it.\n\nWe came here at 11:00 because that was when they started serving lunch. They also offer an all-inclusive brunch of small plates, but we were not up for another buffet before the long flight home. We did order a couple of appetizers (guacamole and queso). The guac was really good, and the chips were a huge standout. Freshly fried, they were super fresh and difficult to stop eating. They came with three types of salsa, all of which were good. (None were particularly spicy, but they were all flavorful). The queso was a bit on the runny side for my taste, which also made it difficult to share.\n\nI ordered nachos for my lunch- if you know me, you'd expect this. The nachos suffered from structural issues in their construction. The beans were spread all over the bottom of the plate, with chips on top of them. Toppings were layered on top and baked, so the chips never stood a chance. They were super soggy by the time they made it to the table. The flavor was good, but I mostly picked the chips from the top and left the sodden bottom layer. I added steak to the nachos, and this was a very good choice- the meat was hot, cooked medium, and made a great addition to the dish.\n\nOther girls got tacos, and that's definitely what I would order the next time. Enjoy the crispy chips as an appetizer, but I don't recommend the nachos unless you make a special request to re-structure. Our waitress was nice but pretty absent, and I don't think that type of special request would have been well-received, although I think they would have done it.\n\nWe sat on the patio, and it was really nice out there! It's covered and there are fans, so even when it's warm outside, this is a good option to get some fresh air."

Me and some other expo attendee agreed to share one high table but we were waiting for the waitress for a long time and no one came to the table. I spotted one empty seat at the bar and ran for it. Once finally seated, I ordered a few tacos and a water and the person at the bar gave me an annoyed look for ordering only water and finally when my order arrived it was not correct and arrived with no silverware and napkins. Since I was sitting at the bar I tried to put my purse down and looked down and the floor was filthy and disgusting, It would be nice if there were purse hooks. I decided because of the lack of time to take my food to go and finish my meal at home. I ordered pork tacos & it was an unbelievable amount of fat with the meat. When someone cuts the meat for the taco you would think they would remove the fat but the tacos were about 50% fat. yuck!"

We started our meal with complimentary chips and salsa. However, the salsa was an experience in itself. We received a trio of salsas that were excellent. I'd write more about them, but I don't recall what was in them (roasted tomatoes, chipotle peppers, tomatillos...something like that). It may have also been the tasty mojito and margarita I had before the meal that altered my memory of the meal...*hic!*\n\nOur entrees were delicious as well. I ordered a steak (well-seasoned and juicy) while my wife ordered the carnitas. Both dishes were so good that we couldn't stop talking about it the next day. Maybe if we had won some money we could've gone back for more. Oh well...\n\nI highly recommend Border Grill for anyone staying in the Mandalay or within a 100-mile radius of Las Vegas. I can't wait for my next meal here..."

The service was great. They are always so helpful answering questions about the menu and making suggestions. I had the fish tacos and my friend had the special of the day, a pork burrito. They were both excellent. I always get great service and great food at the Border Grill."

            "review": "About four years ago, I had the best meal of my life at Border Grill. Unfortunately, I wasn't a proud member of yelp at the time so it went largely unnoticed.  Back then, I ordered an adobada pork chop that came with mashed potatoes and greens. The thick cut pork chop was smothered in an ancho chile sauce that makes me smile just thinking about it.  Unfortunately, my wife and I didn't make it back until this past Saturday night. Was it a special occasion? No, not really.  However, thanks to our older daughter, we were able to get out for a date night- our second in almost 3 years. So, yeah I guess it was a special occasion -for us anyway.  \n\nSo off we went hoping to recapture that memory of what we long considered to be one the best meals we have ever had the privilege of eating.  Before I could sit down or even look at a menu, I yelled out adobada pork chop please!  Our waiter Rob apologized and said that dish was no longer available on the regular menu.  What? What do you mean? There must be some mistake!  Rob told us that every now and then the dish is offered as a special-just not Saturday night.  Now what?\n\nInstead of walking out kicking and screaming, we decided to give the new menu a shot. I settled on the tecate carnitas plate, and my wife chose the Kobe beef sopes. My dish was presented well with the tender pork in the center of the plate surrounded by fantastic guacamole, salsa, onions, cilantro, and a crunchy slaw. Since I ordered both flour and corn tortillas, I prepared my own tacos and ate till my shoes started feeling tight. The Kobe beef sopes were great! The portion was small (3 little sopes about the size of mini muffins), but the flavor more than made up for it. The cilantro mint slaw on top was heavenly. \n\nAs far as the service is concerned, we couldn't have been more satisfied. Rob was friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. He provided us with a 10% discount since we signed up for their rewards card a number of years ago. I am glad he asked, since I forgot we did that. Border Grill also treated us to a free dessert since my wife and I were on a date for the first time in years. Well played Border Grill-well played! \n\nCall it what you want--- tex-mex, Mexican food, or fresh-mex.  Bottom line, this place offers quality food with complex flavors that will make you want to take your wife/husband out for more dates.  \n\nOh yeah, can someone let me know when the pork chop makes it back on the menu?"

When we arrived only one other person was eating so we were able to chat with our waitress for a bit.  Im pregnant and obviously can't drink so she suggested the blood orange lemonade refresher and it was amazing... I didn't even miss having a cocktail! We decided on the guacamole to accompany the chips and salsa the give the table as well as the green corn tamales.  The guac was thick and chunky, just the way I like it.  The tamales were delicious, nice and sweet with plenty of whole kernels... They did serve it as just a mash versus a traditional filled type and they were a bit soft, they had to be eaten off the wrapper as opposed to being able to roll them out.  I had the carne asada tacos and my husband had the yucatan pork.  I loved mine, 3 small tacos with small bites of steak with the perfect amount of spice.  My husband enjoyed his pork... He said it had a great unexpected cinnamon flavor that was nice as well as it was served with cooked plantains yum! Both dishes came with 2 types of rice and refried black beans.  I suppose they're a bit more sustainable but I do miss the good ol' pinto beans I'm used to.  The only down side was since it was so slow everything came out within about 15 minutes of placing our order, but no biggie since it was all amazing.  \nSomething I noticed on the menu is everything applicable labeled gluten free as well as \"80/20\" which indicates that at least 80% of the dish made from plant based ingredients (Not that either of our meals were!).  Border grill is located in the stretch of restaurants going towards the convention center or the shark reef."

While we were looking at the brunch menu, she suggested she could just get us started by ordering a few items while we decided specific items we wanted. A few minutes later our came the items she selected and ever dish was better than the last. When we ordered more, she got thm out timely and even brought some on her own. When we said we were full, she told us to sit a few minutes so we could make room for more! We never felt rushed or like we ordered to much which is the case so many times when it is all you can eat. \n\nAll the food was amazing. The most memorable was the has with fried egg. The meat was so flavorful I could have eaten this alone and given the restaurant 5 stars. I also loved the shrimp and grits, french toast, and pork belly with waffle. They kept our drinks full and took away plates that were empty quickly. This will be a regular stop on every Vegas trip from now on. I can't wait to try \"regular' menu items because if you can get that many dishes right, then the other stuff has to be good!"

Conveniently located just steps away from the Events Center, the upstairs/downstairs was a nice choice.  We chose upstairs, patio, overlooking the pool.  The appetizer of pablano chili/potato was surprisingly spicey.  I feared indigestion later, but it never came, just the explosion of good enough taste to finish it off.  I had the skirt steak, medium and it came out perfect.  Slightlly charred around the edge, while it tasted like a rub, the waitstaff said it was a special marinate.  Regardless, virtually perfect as well as the side of corn and black beans.  My g/f's chili relleno was \"the best\"; delicate batter, smooth, melting cheese, fork tender and contrasted with green chili rice and tomato based rice, it was the perfect dish for her.  With no thoughts to diet, we capped off the dinner with chocolate/cinnamon/oreo cookie, almost like a cheesecake, but a lighter mousee-like pie, was, I hate to overuse the term, but \"to die for.\"  Can't say enough about the staff; attentive, informative, courteous and absolutely spot-on in EVERYTHING.  As a local, I can see revisiting to try more of the menu."

Eating on the outdoor patio is definitely where it's at.  Mandalay Bay still has one of the prettiest pools in town and you can even enjoy the outdoor concerts at night without buying a ticket fyi.\n\nInitial thoughts glancing over the menu was that a group of chefs in a bong circle came up with all of it.  How else does one come up with a \"bacon jalapeno peanut butter and jelly sandwich\"?   That was surprisingly good and definitely hit the hangover spot but probably would've even tasted better at 4:20am for some I reckon.  The \"short rib hash and egg\" was another standout.  I felt like I could actually taste the negra modelo the beef was braised in but it was more likely my lingering beer breath.  I also can't say no to machaca ever and their chilaquiles were something I gladly had thirds of.  \n\nWeekend brunches are getting more extravagent by the week on the strip and so are the prices.  $29.99 for all you can eat plus only $5 more for bottomless mimosas makes me feel like I got an amazing deal.  My only wish was that they ran this until 4pm instead of 2pm.  Gogogogogogo!!"

The wife had been wanting to eat here and I was hesitant because to me it seemed like a healthy alternative to Mexican food I'm used to, but I'm the end I would certainly return for more.\n\nSo our first outing was for lunch and we had decided to sit on the patio area which overlooked the pool area so take note should you feel the need to people watch as you eat. \n\nWith a Yelp check in they provide you a sampling of the green corn tamale which I did feel was a nice touch. The tomatoes tasted fresh and were pretty crisp and the sour cream was light and creamy, but the sweet corn for me didn't quite knock my socks off as I had hoped. To me it tasted identical to the one from El Torito which was a bummer. \n\nFor the main attraction I set my sights on their tacos and of course I went for the \"tres especial\" dabbling in carnitas, spicy shrimp, and carne asada. The carne asada was actually very tender and the marinade complimented the meat very well giving it a little twang bite to bite. I must say the carnitas was a hit as the braised pork was melt in your mouth AND in your hand soft (take that M&M's). Lastly came the shrimp and what I enjoyed was the seasoning of the shrimp as it gave it a slight kick, but nothing too overpowering.\n\nFor my dinner outing, since the tacos were all cooked to the nine I figured they knew how to cook their meat very well so I set my sights on the skirt steak. My only thought was being a mariachi band short of a fiesta as I didn't enjoy my experience at all with this one. I had asked for medium rare as I always do and it was extremely rough on the ends of my steak and towards the middle I had about two exceptional bites of tenderness, but it did appear borderline raw which even I won't mess with. I wanted to ask for a replacement yet didn't want to hold up the group so I dealt with it, but that was very disappointing. It's saying a lot if I found the roasted tomato a highlight of the meal!\n\nAll in all, I'm delivering a rare three star experience mainly because of inconsistency between lunch and dinner..I feel it was just so-so overall of an experience and I'd be doing a disservice honestly if I said any different..I will be back again as my wife fell in love with border grill after both sittings.

I recommend the short rib hash, the shrimp and the tacos as a few of the best things I have ever eaten - with no exaggeration. And (here comes an incredibly egotistical sounding statement) I have eaten at many very famous restaurants.  Our server Christopher really made the experience special. Ask for him and tip him well!"

Ladies took their time to get me a menu despite the fact there was only one couple at the bar - no big deal. Its the subtle snobs that really got to me - two other dudes show up and happen to sit on either side of where I was. I've been here close to 5 minutes now but not sure what I want to order, but its a Mexican restaurant so chips and salsa is expected, turns out not for me. I only got chips AFTER I placed my order. But the other two dudes get their chips with their menus within seconds. At which point I still want to take it as an oversight. My biggest issue is when the two ladies at the bar proceed to check on the two guys every so often but NOT ONCE did they ask if I was ok or needed anything. Suffice if you've stayed at Mandalay you do know about their souvenir alcohol cups from the beach so I guess showing up with one gave the \"no tip impression!\" I always divide my tab by 5 so still left a 20% tip, despite all this, but my main issue is I hope I didn't get this treatment because I was a black guy with dreads!! Stayed here often but just never visited Border Grill but now I know not to go back. One hell of a first time it was!!"

It was getting to the point that neither me nor my boyfriend would make a decision about where to eat, so I opened the Yelp App, looked at the closest places within walking distance, and called Border Grill to see if I needed a reservation. The lady said there was about a 40 minute wait so I put in our names and we took the 7 minute walk from our room to the restaurant. Upon arriving, we realized there was no need for a reservation as the place was only half full, so we took a seat in the open seating bar area and had a server come over right away.\n\nWe each ordered a smoky watermelon margarita, which were delicious, and were brought chips and a trio of salsas. Each salsa was spicy and flavorful and we couldn't stop dipping our chips. To start, we ordered the Queso Fundido which comes with warm tortillas. It was good, but very filling and greasy. I wish we had had a third person to help eat it because we didn't come close to finishing it. We also split the chicken poblano enchiladas. We barely finished these as well! The chicken was seasoned well and I loved the sauce they topped it with.\n\nI would love to come back and check out the brunch menu. It looks insane!\n\nTip: if you check in here, you get a free tamale! We were so full that we didn't take advantage of this, but it's worth a try!"

The tuna ceviche like appetizer was great as the tuna was really fresh and the flavors popped. The date salad had too much lime for me. The seafood enchiladas were great with a fresh slaw on top, very filling and very good. The steak was fatty but the nachos underneath it were gooey and yummy. The whoopie pie dessert was nice and light but the cake was dry without a lot of chocolate flavor. But the horchata cinnamon milk and the caramel that came with it were fabulous... Could have drank a whole glass and the caramel wasnt heavy so added a nice touch for moistness. Definitely enjoyed the meal and saw some other things on the main menu I want to try! \nAs a big top chef fan it was nice to try this place. It isn't near the other Mandalay restaurants so it's easier to park near the convention center than the garage and we sat outside because freezing inside but the fan outside did little to keep us cool. The view of the Mandalay pool at night was really a nice touch though."

Ok, it's only fifty cents, however, given how terrible the desert water is, it is a crime that a fee is charged for filtered tap water water, this should be done as a courtesy for guests.  We're not talking sparkling or bottled water here, it's plain water from the tap.  What's next, a fee for air conditioning?\n\nThere is no mention of this charge on the menu, it just appears on ones bill.

My drink arrived and didn't disappoint: slightly sweet syrup + fizz + mint = delicious! I decided on the grilled fish tacos and they arrived less than 10 minutes after I ordered, a definite plus since I was starving. The tacos themselves were delicious, the fish wasn't oily, the veggies were fresh and it was all topped off with a creamy sauce. I picked at the slightly underdone rice and suspiciously black as night beans and luckily had kept the chip basket to keep munching as I ate dinner.\n\nStaff was friendly & very accomodating, my server was nice and offered her suggestions (hello mojito!) to make for a very enjoyable meal.

When approaching the restaurant after walking through the maze of Mandalay Bay, it may appear that Border Grill isn't very large.  However, you'll find lots of large tables available downstairs too.  \n\nThey seat you down with plenty of salty tortilla chips and a tiny platter of three sauces.  There was one that was green that I just loved, and another one of the two red ones that was yummy too.  \n\nDrink orders first!  I had their Cruzan Mojito, which is described as \"Cuba's most popular cocktail; cruzan estate light rum muddled with fresh mint, lime, and a touch of soda.\"  This was oh-so yum and among the best mojitos ever.  However, not so strong but tasty indeed.  I also tried someone else's Mango Mojito and it was oh-so yummy too!  The BF had the Caipirinha, which is \"a Brazilian classic, fresh juices muddled with sugar drowned in ypioca cachaca.\"  It tasted a bit better than my previous experience with Caipirinha, but still a bit strong tasting.\n\nOur waiter was super friendly and a such a doll.  They get you going when they offer the Guacamole (mashed avocado with cilantro, red onion, jalapeo, and lime).  It's standard fresh guacamole, nothing particularly special about it but it does come with a little salad of something or other on the side.\n\nNot sure what to order, I ask for suggestions from the waiter and comes up with a few.  I decide on the Grilled Skirt Steak, which is \"marinated in garlic, cilantro, cumin, and lime; served with charred corn relish, tomato avocado salad, and black beans.\"  I chose my steak rare and it came out nicely to my liking.  The initial bite was very enjoyable...tasty and delicate.  However, as I ate the rest of my steak, I felt it lacked some flavor.  I ended up dipping my steak into the sauces left on the table for the chips to give it a kick.  The tomato avocado salad was a nice blend of heirloom tomatoes that was a nice accompaniment, but the charred corn relish was a bit too hard for my tastes.  (The BF finished it off though.)  And the black beans were standard too.  This came with a large flour tortilla that I ended up not eating.\n\nThe BF had the Cochinita Pibil, which is \"achiote marinated pork slow roasted in banana leaf with cinnamon, grilled onions, black beans, and plantain orange salsa.\"  It was recommended by the waiter because it came from southern Mexico and is considered a rare dish to find on a menu.  I took the first bite and gave it back to the BF.  The pork was nothing special and I was disappointed.  The BF wasn't so impressed either as he kept on eating my steak instead.  It came with corn tortillas that the BF felt overpowered the pork.  And the plantains were okay too.\n\nOverall, the food was okay.  Dinner for the two of us costs $84, which is definitely not worth it when eating Mexican food.  (Both of us have been to central Mexico, so it's a little hard to justify spending so much on this type of food.)  I would be curious if they had a happy hour just for drinks and appetizers though.  Then you'll see me coming back to drink up on their mojitos! \n\nSidenote:  Watch out for their elevator.  With the six of us in it, it made a funny sound that had us catching our breath for a moment.  And I know we didn't eat all that much now!"

She then said the chips are gluten free but made in a facility that processes wheat. I did not eat the chips. I ordered an item she assured me was gluten free and safe for me. It was not. I started having a reaction within about 10 minutes of finishing my meal.  I informed the manager just so no one else had an issues. His response was that they must have used the wrong flour. He didn't seem too upset that I will now be sick for the trade show I am out of town for."

Hotel restaurants will always cost more money due to the higher overhead.  \n\nThe staff were attentive.  Last time, we had a very unattentive server.

            "review": "Underwhelming!\n\nFirst of all, you have to get past all the cardboard cutouts of Mary Sue Milliken about how wonderful the restaurant is because she was on Top Chef.  Frankly, the place is overrated for the food quality at their prices.\n\nBeware of any house specialty drinks, because they gouge you for higher prices in smaller glasses and frankly one gets bored with how many ways to drink a margarita.\n\nI had their specialty Yucatan Pork, which I sent back because it was too dry to eat, and it took a LOT of negotiations with the server to remove it from the bill, although they did later.  They came back and told me the Kitchen said it was perfect - - - every time I watch Top Chef and if the customer isn't happy, then why in the hell argue with me?\n\nWe sat on the enclosed balcony which was a little cold, although they had heaters.  However all the servers used the doors closest to the table which were seated and each time they entered and exited, cold wind blew in.  I asked the Servers if they could use the doors on the other side of the wall where no one was seated so that the cold air would not blow on us, but they would not.\n\nThe Server did her best to comfort us, and it took THREE attempts to get a hot cup of decaf coffee and all I heard about was excuses.  When I did get a hot cup of coffee the cream was spoiled and curdled in the coffee.\n\nSo would I return?  No.  Top Chef?  Yeah right.  The restaurant doesn't practice what it preaches.  With the quality of restaurants in Vegas, and those I haven't had the opportunity to eat at, I would rather try something new then come back again.  I find it extremely arrogant to make a play off Top Chef when it doesn't live up to its name."

If you want to come to Las Vegas to eat affordably, I would suggest avoiding this place. It's run by two world class chefs. The add for the mimosas is well worth it, considering places on the strip offer a similar add on for $15. The day I went, they had 9 different flavours (one of which was watermelon rosemary, another was prickly pear, pretty unique).\n\nOur server was Luis, and he was wonderful. I can't give him anymore credit. He was quick to describe the dishes and make suggestions. He kept bringing us new flavours of mimosas without us even asking.\n\nWe tried about 90% of the menu items, at least once. The food was incredibly fresh and flavourable. It had a great authenticity to the flavours. You could tell the chefs really care about this cuisine. When we sat down, we received a starter of empanandas to start as our server said it'll be a little bit before we received our first round, which was not only thoughtful but they were tasty as heck!\n\nWe sat inside but they also had a patio."

The bartender came over very quickly for our drink order. I ordered the happy hour margarita and in a jiff, he came and delivered. Talk about fast! They barely had time to drop off the complimentary chips and salsa!\nIt was not the best margarita. Maybe its' because I make my own with fresh squeezed lime juice, I make my own simple syrup and I add a Grand Marnier floater. This was lacking. I didnt taste any alcohol at all. Boooooo!\nWe ordered the (me) veggie quesidilla, and my friend the carne asada. The presentation on both was so pretty (see pics). The flavor on the veggie quesidilla was good. I didn't like the \"fried\"/crunchy feeling of the flour tortilla. I'd ask next time for it just warmed up, but that's me. It reminded me of taco bell and I dont eat there. The guacamole and salsa on the side were very delish. I enjoyed those tremendously. My friend really enjoyed her tacos too. \nI'm glad I tried, and I might be back, but it's not a \"have to\" place for me. There is a total divey place (name I can't remember) on Durango and Westside that has great Mexican food. It's worth the drive in my opinion.

First of all, I'd like to say I love guacamole.  I put it on everything.  Undercooked chicken?  Guacamole.  Overcooked rib eye?  Guacamole.  Guacamole fixes everything and makes it magically delicious.  With that said, I DID NOT eat the guacamole at Border Grill BUT I did see someone who sat diagonally across from my girlfriend and I who was GETTIN DOWN on some guacamole.  I was jealous.  Instead, I satified my palatte by slamming 2 strawberry margaritas back to back and some Baja Ceviche.  The Baja Ceviche was awesome, the seasonal fish and cilantro ailoli gave it a nice flavor!  Unique to any other ceviche I've tried in the past.  Highly suggest it.  I finished my meal with a trip to the dessert menu where I got the Pastel Rufina.  The description says, \"layers of puff pastery, sweetened cream cheese, chocolate chunks, and fresh berries\".  So I'm thinking this is gonna be some mini dessert.  Well, it turns out, this dessert is MASSIVE.  But luckily, I have a bottomless stomach so I destroyed it without much struggle.

Hubby finished early so we decided to go to the restaurant and see if we could get seated earlier than our 9p reservation.\n\nIt would take our friend a little while to get there so we sat at the bar and ordered a Border Shaker for Two.  Our cocktail waitress was very friendly and shortly after we ordered the bar got pretty crowded.  We were at a table and enjoyed our order.  It was so tasty that I was actually wondering if there was tequila in the drink as it was not noticeable at all.  Hubby did get quite buzzy, so that answered my question.  The shaker for two comes with two cocktail glasses, a shaker, a small bottle of tequila (enough for two shakers-full) and an extra glass with the other margarita ingredients.  The shaker contains the first round of the margarita mix and the tequila is added at the table before it's shaken (without a top).  When you're ready for round two, pour the second batch of mix into the mixer and add the rest of the tequila.  Note, the first round only had about a third of the tequila in it and the second round was too much to fit into the mixer.  We actually had to pour the tequila into our cocktail glasses.  Well worth the $29!\n\nOur friend arrived and we were able to be seated an hour earlier than our 9p reservation time.  We were seated outside and even though it was still in the 90s, the sun had set, there was a breeze and it was actually quite comfortable.  Water was poured and chips with three types of salsa were brought to the table.  The chips are very light and crispy and appeared to be flour tortillas versus the traditional corn tortillas.  There is a red salsa, a green salsa and a chipotle salsa.  All three are good, but the smokiness of the chipotle easily made it my favorite.  The green came in a close second and the red seemed a bit pedestrian, possibly for the non-adventurous.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nBlood Orange Margarita - for our friend\nCorn Chowder (on the special's menu) - for our friend\nCeviche Trio (Peruvian, Baja, Tuna Credo) - for me and hubby\nChicken Poblano Enchiladas - for our friend\nGaucho Steak - for hubby\nTecate Carnitas - for me\n\nThe Ceviche Trio arrived first and it is a small sampling of the three different types of ceviche listed on the menu.  The trio is not listed, but our waitress informed us that we could do any combo of any of the ceviches.  We opted for the trio so we could try them all.  The Tuna Credo wasn't very exciting.  The seasonings weren't prominent enough and tasted pretty bland.  The Peruvian and Baja were a little more flavorful.  Hubby enjoyed the Baja the best and my favorite was the Peruvian.  All three had large amounts of fish (and shrimp in the Baja), but the portions are probably only large enough to share between two people.\n\nOur friend had the corn chowder and he said it was very tasty, albeit a bit spicy.  He enjoyed the kick to it, though, and finished the entire bowl.\n\nOur entrees arrived and all three were generous portions.  Our friend enjoyed his enchiladas and finished them.\n\nHubby ate about half of his steak which he really liked.  It was served over a bed of what appeared to be \"chilaquiles\", but he said it was a little odd.\n\nMy carnitas were excellent!  The presentation was pretty interesting as well, with the black bean salsa layered with what the corn grits above and then finished with a huge pile of carnitas, jalapeno bacon and onions.  A singular large flour tortilla accompanied.  I was only able to eat about a third of the meal and I was full.\n\nHubby and I both took our leftovers back to the hotel and had them the next day.  Still good!  It's been awhile since I'd been to the Border Grill and it was nice to have another experience to remind me why I enjoy this restaurant.  The staff and service were excellent and the generous portions of the tasty food don't hurt, either!"

One of the girls in our party is Gluten free, and they offer several GF options which, also includes their chips (which are ridiculously delicious).  Their prices are similar to a decent Mexican restaurant in BOS which, was great.  I am not big on Mexican Food, at all.  I strip what everyone loves out of the meals and eat basically the protein, the carb and the cheese, I love the flavors.  With that said, the Queso Fundido is AH-MAZZZZ-ING.  This is a MUST try!  I ordered the carne quesadilla with only the carne and the cheese (no onions, guac, salsa, etc.).  This CAN be shared with someone else, the portion is huge.  It is cut into 6 slices, in fact, I took half of it to go.  Actually, this went for all of our meals, so, try to share what you can to avoid leftovers, especially if you do not have a micro in your hotel.  This is in no way a negative criticism, for $19, it is the perfect size.  The drinks were great, I did the Cadillac Margarita, it was so good, I had to try it twice.. = ) \n\nOur waiter was Michael, he was attentive, and very knowledgeable and considerate to my friends Gluten Free allergy.  In fact, I put the flour tortilla from the queso on top of the chips and he has pointed out that I \"contaminated\" the chips (jokingly of course..) and brought her \"her own chips that no one else should touch\".  He was very witty and made us laugh.  If you love Mexican, give this place a whirl.  We sat on the covered patio and it was breathtaking."

There was a Lowe's conference taking place there, and getting through the crowd to get to the entrance was quite an adventure. \nIt was dark and pretty much empty in the restaurant. \n\nOur service was excellent. We ordered the trio of salsas and the guacamole. Very good. \n\nMy mother and siblings all ordered humongous margaritas. They looked great. I was nursing a massive hangover, so I had a Pepsi.\n\nI ordered the plantain empanadas (not mexican, BTW). The presentation was lacking- they were just there on the plate. Almost like some frozen snack you microwave and toss on a plate. \n\nI abhor sweet with savory, so this was not the dish for me. The filling is not appealing to the eye and is sweet. They weren't horrible, but I just couldn't get past the sweet. Next time I'll try the green corn tamales.\n\nMy sister's friend ordered the tortilla soup. The \"soup\" was too thick and didn't have much flavor. However, the soup has these cubes of cheese that are so damn delicious...I just gold-mined those out of her soup throughout the meal. They were absolutely my favorite of the evening. I could eat a whole bucket of those cheese cubes!!!"

It's cute, and the food is decent enough. But the service is not nearly as good as the one in L.A. We had two vegetarians in the group who absolutely couldn't eat onions--which eliminates 99% of the menu--and the server did not offer to see what he could do to accommodate. Just kind of shrugged and said, \"Sorry.\" Mid-way through dinner, our table of six was forgotten about. No refills on tea or other drinks. We had to really work to get dessert. All in all, definitely not worth the price for this kind of service. Wouldn't return."

Border Grill had gotten rave reviews and sounded like my kind of restaurant, given my love for Mexican food and restaurants with rave reviews :).\n\nIt was a nice day and we sat out on the patio area, though there really is no view unless you have one of the seats on the very outside.. then you would be able to overlook the Mandalay Bay beach and lazy river area, though I'm not sure it would have been much of a view either way.\n\nI ordered the Grilled Skirt Steak (also referred to as their \"marinated skirt steak\") based on positive reviews from my fellow Yelpers. For $24, it's a little pricey for what it is outside of Vegas, but it does come with a pretty generous serving of steak. Also comes with tortillas, sides of corn, tomatoes, and baked beans (forgive me if I did not describe them in fancy terms.. if you want that, you can check the menu on their website). The food is delicious and very flavorful, definitely characteristic of \"upscale Mexican.\"\n\nMy girlfriend got the Duck Tacos at $19, which comes with the same sides of corn, tomatoes, and baked beans. The duck tacos are relatively small, but I did get a taste of the duck and it was very good. My girlfriend didn't think they were anything special, but she is definitely more food snob than I (sorry babe, but it's true!).\n\nIf this review were just up to the food, I would give Border Grill 4 stars. However, service was NOT good. Our waitress was just never around, and that alone can shift the mood of the dining experience drastically. The waitress took our order while we continued to look over the drink menu, but was then never to be seen again until after our food came out. Because of this, we never got to order our drinks. And guess what, she never checked on us again until we were done eating. And damnit, the restaurant was not even busy!!\n\nBecause of lackluster service and $1 for regular water (what, you couldn't throw free water with a $50 lunch?), I am giving Border Grill 3 stars. If service had been just average, I'd of given Border Grill 4 stars. And if service was excellent, 4.5 (nice atmosphere).\n\nCheck out my photos for pics of the food."

I waited 15 minutes for water and a drink order and it took another 15 to get a drink and order.  I started with Queso Fundido.  It took 20 minutes to arrive and was, despite the description, basically a blob of panela cheese (rubbery farmer cheese) that was thrown in a ramekin and waved under the broiler.   There was no browning of the cheese and it was ice cold in the middle, with the consistency of a tennis ball.  It was topped with a few stringy grilled onions and peppers.  Real Queso Fundido should be oozy goodness, molten and delicious with onions in it, not on it.  Leave to the two Hollywood Gueras to screw up such a basic and simple appetizer.\n\nThe main dish was \"Yucatan Pork\" - pulled pork in banana leaf. It was dry dry dry.  No taste, no oily carnitas goodness.  Blah.\n\nNo flan on the menu for dessert.\n\nFor the $50 I dropped there, I'd have had an equally authentic and quality meal at Taco Bell for one tenth the price.  The Hard Rock Hotel's \"Pink Taco\" is a much better bet.  So far for me, virtually all the star power top chef eateries in LV have sucked.  What happens in Vegas should be left behind in Vegas."

It was a nice cool evening, and they had the heaters on.  We were directly underneath them, and I actually found myself a little warm.  Not uncomfortably so, but I definitely was noticing the heat. \n\nThat wasn't an issue however; I clearly enjoyed the meal.  To start, you are brought 3 different salsas and chips.  Of these, the green was my favorite, although I liked both red salsas as well.  Our table of 5 decided to get the queso fundido to start, and 2 of them got guacamole.  The guacamole was good, certainly fresh.  It could have used some heat for my taste.  The queso was FANTASTIC.  Made with chorizo, it got crispy on the bottom where the cheese melted against the hot metal bowl.  I seriously considered ordering another serving of this, it was that good.  Crispy, melty, a little salty from the sausage.  Just a fantastic cheese dish.  \n\nThe meal only got better from there.  The wife had the short rib enchiladas, which were great.  Loved the sauce, and they were covered with a ton of veggies.  But, the showstopper was my meal:  the gaucho steak.  This is a large ribeye (cooked to a textbook medium rare, by the way) on top of a HUGE bed of maybe the best chilaquiles I've ever eaten and served with a roasted onion half and roasted garlic.  If ever a dish was composed well, this is that dish.  All of this stuff went together fantastically well, you could get a perfect bite with all 4 components.  The chilaquiles were soaked in sauce and served with what appeared to be 2 different types of cheese.  The garlic and onion were roasted long enough to become sweet, flavorful and soft, but not so long that they were burnt in anyway.  \n\nI've been to many of the best steakhouses in Vegas.  While the gaucho steak isn't going to make me forget the reserve ribeye at Carnevino, it certainly is one of the more memorable steaks I've had on the strip.  Can't recommend this enough if you are a beef person.\n\nFor dessert, the table had the tres leches cake and the chocolate cake (can't remember the exact menu title).  Both were good, but I found the chocolate cake to be far superior.\n\nService was good, they leave a carafe of water on your table, which was nice.  And, when that was empty, they brought a replacement very quickly.  We'll definitely return, and I 100% will order the gaucho steak next time."

The chicken and steak quesadillas were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered the fresh fruit sangria which happened to be blueberries and raspberries that day. It was super carbonated and tasted like a fizzy blueberry soda, but maybe you like your sangria like that. I don't. Plus, they do not offer pitchers. Goodness, of all places in the world, why must you not have pitchers? My favorite of the night was the Watercress, Avocado, and Orange salad that came with bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and blue cheese. It was sinful I tell you. The salad was light and delicious and balanced out the heaviness of the bacon wrapped dates very nicely. Just for the salad, I might forgive you Border Grill for the whole water fiasco, but I won't forget."

I love this place and always have a fun time there. I prefer the Mandalay Bay location to the Caesars Palace one, just because this location has the option to sit outside and you are located right next to the Mandalay Bay pool which is nice. The absolute best part about this bunch is the $10 bottomless mimosas. I still do not understand how it costs so little to drink so much! They just keep bringing them out and it's not just OJ - they have at least 10 different options of juice for you to try (and if you stay long enough you can typically try all 10!) Is the food the best I've ever had? No. There are probably other places in Vegas where the food offered at their brunch is better / more gourmet. But it's good - especially if you like Mexican. And oftentimes when people go to weekend brunch in Vegas, they are hungover and this is pretty darn good hangover food. Biscuits. Cheese. Churro tots. You catch my drift. If you are on a diet / trying to eat healthy, this is not the place for you. There are limited healthy options although surprisingly they offer a fair amount of vegetarian dishes on the menu. Great place for a big group of people as they just keep on bringing out small plates and if you need anything extra, they will bring that out for you. Flat rate of $34.999 per person no matter how much you eat. I have never had a bad experience here and, like I said, I've gone several times over the past decade. If you are visiting Vegas or even if you are a local, this is a must-do brunch that you must try!"

As an overall rating for others though, I would probably give it 4 stars .   \n\nAt $34.99 plus $10 for unlimited mimosas, I think the brunch is expensive but for my dollars, it delivers good value.   I expect to spend 2 to 3 hours being served small plates and trying new and old flavors of mimosas.    The food and mimosa menu is constantly changing, so if I get something I really like, I pretty much keep ordering that until I'm full.  A couple of years ago, I had a grapefruit mimosa there that was so good, I stopped eating so I could drink more of them!  Champagne with grapefruit, honey and a little gin.   So very good.   So good that I experimented until I got the recipe down for myself. \n\nI don't eat beef, chicken or pork, so my options are a bit limited but like I said, when they hit their mark with something, it is fantastic, like the SEASONAL FRESH FRUIT SALAD - housemade granola * lime zest * cayenne yogurt * bu\u00f1elo cone .   Not only the flavors but the different textures of this dish are perfect.   \n\nThe beauty of the small plates is that if you don't like something, you can just stop eating it and get something else.

It was the best dinner my husband and I had in Vegas during our stay. \nThis place would get 5 stars, but the customer service sucked. I think we saw our waitress a total of four times. One of the wait staff constantly bumped my partner's chair during our meal everytime he walked by. The server who brought our food out did not know which table it went to, and so he just kind of wandered from table to table as it was rejected by customers. Then, as I had just finished and my partner had just a few bites left, the server picks my plate up and then stands there staring at my partner waiting for him to eat his last few bites. My partner takes his sweet time to savor the last few bites, while this server is literally standing a few feet away watching my partner. WTF? I have never seen anything like that before, so yeah, customer service  was not hot."

The kitchen doesn't like to do modifications here so don't ask obviously there's a chef with an attitude back there who needs to go. It's no wonder the place was empty. This place used to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in town and I used to recommend it to everyone. Just goes to show when ownership gets big (Susan) and popular and has multiple restaurants and gets corporate  they don't pay attention to the places that got them there make sure to avoid this place and go somewhere else for dinner.

And for brunch this place has ALL YOU CAN EAT  tapas, and yes I did say ALL YOU CAN EAT. And that's lot all! Just for 10$ more you can add bottomless mimosas! And not just champagne and regular orange. You can choose from 12 different juices! From blood orange, to peach, to strawberry! But be cautious... Those mimosas will sneak up on you!\n\nWe tried a lot of the plates but just could not do them all. It was just the two of us, it would be more beneficial if there were a few of you doing the brunch so you can try more food. The highlight of the meal, a must get, if you do come is the shrimp & grits and the spicy chicken tamale! You will die so bomb. \n\nTheir grits is hands down the best I have ever had. It is so cheesy and flavorful. And the salsa on top amazing! Not too spicy but just right. The tamale was also one of the best I ever had! It is really spicy tho but I can take it. The sweet corn tamale wasn't all that great so just skip that. \n\nThe oyster taco was also pretty amazing. Everything was amazing. The staff was very attentive. Made sure our glasses were never empty. One I thing I do wish they had were desserts. \n\nOh! And if you sign up for their rewards thing, they give you 15% off every time  you dine with them! \n\nI would come here again and recommend this place for a nice classy brunch! I'll be back!"

Her timing is perfect on bringing food, checking in, making warm small talk, etc. my wife and I have been SUPER impressed\n\nA couple bits if info about this location. It's buried in the WAY back part of Mandalay Bay where the convention center is. Walk past Fluer, Light, Starbucks, etc... When you think you've walked too far, you'll find it :-) \n\nThey are opening a new location located directly on the strip at Ceasars and this one will stay open. They have indoor and outside seating. The outside overlooks the lazy river. \n\nThe only negative (for me) is I've noticed the vegetarian and vegan options disappearing from the menu. Meat is being added (almost unnecessarily) to items. If you don't care, this won't matter. For me it does. \n\nI'll be back for sure. I hope they adjust the menu trend so I can come back many more too!\n\nAlso, if you sign up to their email club online, you will get a buy 1 get 1 entree free for use within the next ?30-60 days (don't quote me on the length)\n\nPlease thumb up/comment if you liked this review and I would count it a privilege if you chose to follow me as I review places I travel and visit.

Today, we stopped in for a late lunch and had another excellent meal.\n\nWe got an order of bacon guacamole for an appetizer and it came with four wedges of seasoned chips.  The guacamole was excellent.  The cotija cheese gave the guacamole a super flavor in addition to the bacon.  The chips tasted a bit stale and didn't have the crispness of their taco chips.  We were brought the complimentary chips and 3 salsas and all three were good but the inferna was the best flavor, yet it wasn't that spicy.\n\nFor our mains, I got one of the lunch specials--turkey mole enchiladas.  The enchiladas were spread inside with a thin layer of very good masa.  The enchiladas were covered with an almond mole that was complex in flavor and very good.  The enchiladas were filled with well seasoned turkey meat and there was a small fris\u00e9e salad on top with some very thin fresh peach slices.   My wife got the carnitas tacos.  There were three soft tacos with two kinds of rice and some black beans with cotija cheese.  I ate one of the tacos and the pork and toppings were very good.  The chipotle salsa was very good.\n\nWe waited for awhile and then ordered two half desserts.  They allow you two pick two desserts and get a half portion of each.  We got the pastel Rufina.  The menu describes it this way:  layers of puff pastry, sweetened cream cheese, chocolate chunks, and fresh berries.  The berries were raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries and the dessert is made with eclair-like puff pastry and topped with the cream cheese and chocolate chunks.  It was superb!  The other selection was a small wedge of their flourless chocolate truffle cake. The menu describes it as rich, delicate chocolate truffle cake with prickly pear lychee sauce and raspberries.  The chocolate is very rich in flavor but it is not delicate.  It was very dense although very tasty.\n\nService was good although we waited for a time to get an iced tea refill.  I really like Border Grill and I'll be back."

On this night, with Mexican, a short walk from the sportsbook at Mandalay Bay, and \"high-quality\" being the requirements, a reservation was made for Border Grill.  \n\nI'll admit that going into this, my hopes were a bit low.  That's because I'm not much for most Mexican cuisine or Susan Feniger's personality on TV.\n\nThe restaurant is a short walk from the casino toward the Shark Reef/Convention space, and well-signed.  A quick Yelp check-in provided us a free Green Corn Tamale, which our waitress, without prompting, multiplied by three for each person at our table.  It was, hands-down, the most incredible tamale I've ever had.  The masa was rich and moderately sweet, and the portion was perfect for a small starter.  \n\nSpeaking of starters, their chips and salsa-three-ways is Awesome-Three-Ways.  The chips were nicely sized, thick cut, and sans grease, and all three salsas were among the best I've had.  My favorites were the verde and the smoked chipotle.\n\nMy pops and I shared the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas, which were split and served on separate plates before arriving at the table.  My brother-in-law had the Chile Relleno, which I tried (hey, he offered!!).  Both were, again, among the highest quality, freshest flavored, most authentic Mexican food I've had in the states.  Yes, 13 feet from one of the world's largest casino floors.  Weird, but amazing.\n\nAs with most restaurants of quality in Vegas, the facility and decor are far above average.  Inside, the space is quieter than you'd think and quite nicely appointed.  There's even outdoor seating with semi-views of the beach and pools in the complex.  \n\nThis place just became my go-to for Mexican when in Sin City!\n\nFood = 5/5\nFacility = 5/5\nService = 4/5\nAmbiance = 4/5\nValue = 3/5"

The mole sauce was as complex and flavorful as any I tried in Mexico.  Wow!\n\nDespite the high price, I will return here everytime I am in Vegas, and never try any new dish.

I, like everyone, had seen the two chefs that own this restaurant on Top Chef Masters, and their food looks so good! I went here on Monday for lunch, sat outside overlooking the pool, which was very nice, but was halfway disappointed. SO I had ordered the Border Grill Classics (I think that's what it was called), but it had little mini portions of chicken tacos, green corn tamales, and a tostada -ish thing with a funky name (can't remember right now), and it was just so boring! I was shocked that something that was supposed to give a taste of multiple menu items was just bland and not exciting AND cost 19$...not cool. Now, on the flip side, the BF got the potato tacos and they were one of the most delicious things I have tasted. They were spicy, creamy AND crunchy (fried shell), and had a ton of flavor. It came with two different types of rice, green and red, which were both good also. All of this for 16$! I really made the wrong choice... Anyway, I might have given this place 4 stars, but our service was not so great. Our server, Erica, seemed like she was in a very bad mood and talked to our table with attitude, especially after we declined drinks or appetizers. \n\nI would think about going back here for the potato tacos....but I wish it was a bit more consistent."

            "review": "My local friend and I came here during restaurant week (last week). We each had the 3 course tasting menu, which by the way, is on the regular menu but is marked up $8 additional during restaurant week. They say it's because $4 goes to a children's charity, which is great, but what about the other $4?\n\nI had the mushroom empanadas, the shrimp enchiladas in \"lobster sauce\", and the only dessert option which was some dark chocolate cookie sandwich (whoopie pie) and some cinnamon cream (?horchata). My friend had tuna tartare (more like a a hawaiian poke) and the steak. \n\nFood: Where do I begin? Oh I know...umm yes, the food was disgusting!! I'm sorry, I never like to say something like this, but both us felt the food was absolutely horrible. I even took home my leftovers and tried to eat them later, but I couldn't. I had to throw them away, and I don't usually throw food away. The flavors were completely off, did not compliment each other at all, and were very unbalanced. They have a sign outside saying this is the most authentic Mexican food. That could not be further from the truth. It seems as if the chef is trying very hard to create gourmet dishes, but ended up creating very very pretentious dishes that did not taste good at all. Whoever is in the kitchen does not appear to know how to work with ingredients and flavors. \n\nThe Hawaiian-poke-style tuna tartare: very very strong flavor of dark sesame oil and soy sauce. Sesame oil is a strong flavor, and is supposed to be used lightly. The chef dumped it onto the tuna as a sauce. Same with the soy sauce.\n\nMushroom empanadas: The three small pieces were fried, but the crust was chewy and almost stale tasting, instead of crispy. The filling had almost no flavor. The sauce made of black beans, also had no flavor. \n\nThe shrimp enchilladas: Very salty, but flavorless. The filling had a fishy taste, which I didn't expect for shrimp, but otherwise had no flavor. The tortillas had a soft, doughy texture that was more like cornbread. The sauce was a pretty shade of orange, but tasted like salty cream, no real flavor at all.\n\nThe dessert: This was absolutely the worst dish. Neither of us could eat it. The stuffed cake/cookie thing was stale and had a strange chewiness. It was a very very dark chocolate and had almost no sweetness at all. The cream filling was sort of hard, not creamy, and did not taste sweet or good. The accompanying cinnamon horchata was ok, but very strongly cinnamon-flavored, and nothing else, not sweet.\n\nI cannot comment on the steak, because I don't eat beef.\n\nRight after I left Vegas, I read an article about the chef/owner, Susan Feniger, in Westways magazine. The article presented her as doing innovative things with authentic Mexican food, which is something I would be interested in trying. I was very disappointed that I had such a poor experience. To be fair, the article was about the (original) Santa Monica location, which hopefully might be better, and I would be willing to give it a try.\n\nPrices: Ridiculous! I know it's Mandalay Bay, and it's also a \"gourmet\" restaurant, but even so, the prices were way over the top. My plate of two enchilladas (with NO accompanying beans or rice or anything) would be $27 if a la carte. The cheapest entree was an a la carte chile relleno, which was $19. Our three-course menus are normally $42. However, the exact same menu was bumped up to $50 for restaurant week. When we asked why the price was elevated, we were told that $4 per person is donated to a children's charity during restaurant week. That does not account for an $8 price increase. \n\nAmbience: It's ok, like a typical four star Mexican restaurant. The patio seating overlooking the pool is nice. \n\nService: This is the only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one. Our server, Kelly, was very friendly, accommodating, very attentive, and just overall amazing. She was very pushy in the beginning trying to make us order more items, but other than that, it was some of the best service I've had. \n\nPROS: Service, location in Mandalay Bay\n\nCONS: FOOD (very poorly executed, bad taste); price\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Something seems to be lost in translation between the chef owner who is in California, and the staff of this Vegas location. The food is horrible!"

Just not a good combo of flavors, even though I love bacon.\n\nThe machaca chilaquiles were wonderful, as well as their eggs Benedict. When you get the brunch though, be prepared to eat a LOT of eggs.\n\nI think it was about $30 per person, but it was good quality food. For another...$8 I think, you can add bottomless mimosas. You can even get one more mimosa to go :)\n\nIf you're in Vegas and need a great hangover recovery meal, this is it."

First the location is way off the main area, not a good idea. The restaurants is classy with a California vibe. We got the complementary chips with the 3 salsas, salsas were OK, chips were fresh! We asked for a spicy sauce and got a good kick in the butt with the habenero chillies. Ordered bunch of appetizers - out of which the baja ceviche rocked, fresh fresh seafood. The other trio of appetizer included plantain empanadas (OK), corn cream tamales (too sweet) and the chicken tacos (best yet!). We also got the Mexican soup, nice! All in all the food was good but not crave worthy. Service was excellent with water refills, recommendations and offering of hot salsa. Best part of got 15% discount for being CA natives, go CALIFORNIA!"

I really do..\n\nThis came on a recommend and it wasn't bad... but it wasn't knock-your-socks off either.\n\nThere are a few things I didn't appreciate, and that tainted the whole experience there. \n\nFor one, when the tortilla chips and salsa came, the guy asked us if we wanted any gucamole to accompany the chips, and we said ok... not realizing that they were going to charge us for it, seeing as that we had just sat down ad were getting our bearings.. It wasn't until we open the menu and saw that guacamole was on the appetizer size of the menu that we realized that there was a charge. \n\nI'm just saying it would have been nice, if they asked us if we wanted the guacamole and tell us that there was a charge for it, rather than say you want the guacamole, here you go and find out that they charge $ for it at the end of the meal. We might have ordered it anyways, but I really really really really hated the way they were sneaky about that. \n\nI was prepared about the water charge $0.50 per person, but once again they didn't ask us about that, but luckily I was prepared for the diming of us there and so didn't mind so much. \n\nService is attentive, but I would like to know that service staff was more ... communcative with each other. I mean one guy knows we ordered dessert and puts a pair of forks and napkins on the table for us, so when our dessert comes we can share; two minutes later another waiter comes by and tries to take it away... I mean really seriously.... I appreciate the attentiveness, but at least communicate with each other...\n\n*exhales* The restaurant itself was ok; but these issues that I mentioned above really ruined what otherwise would have been a good experience here. I appreciate how they are trying to go local, and organic and be responsible about sourcing their food, etc. But there are ways to around it, that don't make the restaurant, and by extention the owners/chefs look like complete ***** in the process.\n\nFood was good. I recommend the Border Grill experience and we thought the braised short rib was better than the fish tacos, and their Tamarind Ginger Cheesecake was amazing. The fact that I made a reservation on Opentable and they had our reservation and table ready when we walked in was nice., Front of house was efficicent, but like I said in regards to the issues I listed about...\n\nIf you do decide to come here, I suggest the outdoor seating, but make sure there isn't a large party out on the balcony; otherwise it is a mite too noisy to enjoy the company you are with. \n\nBorder grill does not meet my Las Vegas Recommend must-visit List."

By some I literally mean 2/6 were cooked well and the others were garbage. \n\nThe churros are not even churros don't bother ordering it.  \n\nThe tostada with chicken was the best of the bunch along with the guacamole. These were off the regular menu. Also off the regular menu was the grilled chicken torta: this had absolutely no flavor what so ever. I asked for hot sauce to attempt to mask the dullness with spice but I never received it and gave up. \n\nBloody Mary was tomato juice and just that with a lime thrown in. \n\nNow. As far as service, oh boy! Our server was Tiffany M. Our party was of 10 people but we were pretty easy breezy with our orders. However, much of our side requests were constantly forgotten and when we asked for our checks she had us sit for 20 minutes and calculate everyone's orders instead of her charging each individual. She was rude about it as well, as if she didn't know how to do calculations herself. What kind of service is that? \n\nWouldn't come back here. You're better off elsewhere."

Yet, to state law in Nevada you are aloud to stay in a bar section if they serve food at this hour. I would understand if I went to order alcohol but it was strictly water & instead of going far to get my purse from the car I decided to wait because they told us that it is 20 minutes. We wait outside for 30, then after asking 3 times if the table is ready and getting now more snotty attitude from now not only the bartender and now the hostesses, we finally get seated.\nWe get the option to sit inside or outside, thought that was odd coming from the fact of it being a 10 minute longer of a wait.\nWe choose inside and there is at least 8 empty tables. 4 of them being dirty our entire meal. The food was okay, but GETTING MY FOOD OUT BEFORE A SIMPLE GLASS OF WATER.. Is dumb. The guy next to us in a suit had a whole tray spill on him. It's been like 30 mins and the other people next to us haven't even got their drink order. I thought customer service was a good thing to get them to return.. But instead of saying it is all because of it being \"busy\" \nYou should all say because we're lazy bitches who don't know how to clean a table or even check on their customers. \nIF I had the option to give it 0 stars.

They use a water purification system for environmental reasons.  I think it's great and a nominal price to charge.  And ff 50 cents for water is an issue, what are you doing on the vegas strip where there is a markup on anything and everything??  \n\nWe decided on going to Border Grill as my husband and I live in NYC and my sister and her husband live in Chicago so we like to pick restaurants that we can't get at home.  \n \nChips and Salsa were tasty and complimentary (they easily could charge for that given it is Vegas).  We got the guacomole, also good and reasonably priced at $9.  Only complaint was that as soon as we finished our first bowl of chips, they immediately placed a second one down.  I have no self control and was pretty full by the time dinner arrived.\n\nFor dinner, we each ordered different things and each loved our meals (Tecate Carnitas, Chicken Mole, Jumbo Shrimp, Chicken Quesadilla).  I got the Tecate Carnitas, everything came on the side so you could eat as you please.  As a very picky eater, I couldn't have been happier.  My husband who hadn't been in a big Mexican mood ordered the Shrimp and ate every drop on his plate.\n\nMy husband ordered the Banana Cream Pie for dessert.  We all groaned at the idea of desser because were so full but of course, we said we'd try a bite.  Easily the best banana cream pie any of us had ever had.  And no, we didn't take just one bite.\n\nCocktails were also great.  Strawberry mojito was really refreshing and delicious.  Would have been nicer to have them a little bigger in size as it wouldn't be that hard to drink 3 or 4 but at $12 a glass, it adds up.  I had the skinny pink lemonade which was great for a low calorie drink.  My sister had the non alcholic sparkling white peach lemoade which was $5 but only $2.50 for a refill which I thought was nice.  Beer was $6 a bottle, very reasonable for Vegas.\n\nAs for service, I saw some complaints on here.  Obviously service can be luck of the draw, but our server Autumn, was easily the nicest/friendliest server any of us had in a long time which just made the meal even more enjoyable.\n\nObviously, I am a fan.  If I am in LA or Vegas in the future, I will definitely be making a point to go again :-)"

Because we were a party of 25, I reserved a private room and worked with the event coordinator on a pre-set menu.  That in itself was a lovely experience.  The event coordinator was infinitely patient with my constant additions to and subtractions from the number of the party and happily accommodated one of my guests, who was battling morning sickness and could only eat certain foods, by letting me order a special entree for her that was not on our pre-set menu, at no extra charge. \n\nThe coordinator's nearly-angelic patience extended to the staff.  No one even blinked an eye or cracked a frown when 90% of our dinner party showed up almost an hour late for our reservation!  And the food was absolutely spectacular!  The chips came out crackling hot and the green salsa was so fresh that I could swear I caught a whiff of the grass from the field where the vegetables were grown! (presuming, that is, that vegetables for salsa are grown in a field, which they are probably not, but I digress...)  Our starter was a Caesar salad, which was really really flavorful.  We had a selection of three main courses - the grilled skirt steak, the chicken poblano enchiladas and the chille relleno.  The skirt steak was juicy, tender and really well seasoned.  The enchiladas had a delicious spicy sauce.  I didn't try the chille relleno, but it looked great.  For dessert, we had fresh berries with mint and whipped cream, which came in cute little yummy edible baskets.   I also highly recommend the house-made peach lemonade.  \n\nOverall, an absolutely fantastic experience - highly, highly recommend!"

We started with cocktails at the bar (while we waited for our table which wasn't ready at 7:30 when we arrived).  One friend had a great Malbec, another a pina colada-esque drink which I thought was too sweet but wasn't something I'd ever order anyway, and I had the watermelon mojito which was BY FAR the best mojito I've had in my life, hands-down.  Highly recommended.  They're seasonal, apparently, so hustle over and get one if you're in the area.  10 minutes later our table for five- outside, corner half booth - overlooking the Mandalay lazy river pool was ready.  \n\nIt was obviously hot on a July night in Vegas, but there were fans and it was bearable.  Maybe next time I'd sit in inside, but when on vacation and celebrating a birthday, we figured being outdoors would provide a nicer ambiance . Whatever.  Water was a .50/cent per person charge which I've never heard of, but it was filtered and it was fine.  \n\nThe food was delicious.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla to start which was flavorful (great cheeses, not greasy, spicy without being overpowering) and overall a 9/10.  A friend and I split the chicken enchiladas which were phenomenal.  So so good.  I'm guessing the server was new (or just not savvy) because when we asked originally for recommendations she had no reasons on which to base her recommendations and seemed to pick the most expensive things on the menu.  Coming from a former server who notices these things, that was a mistake.  We ordered, therefore, what we thought we'd like best and disregarded her meaningless suggestions, and from the baja ceviche to the enchiladas, to the chocolate pie-esque dessert, everything was great.  Minus 1 star for service and a slight delay on the table, but otherwise well above average.  I would definitely come back for that mouthwatering watermelon mojito and those enchiladas in a heartbeat.  Oh, and it was a little pricey, but not really compared to your typical over-priced Vegas fare.\n\nFirst Yelp Review, ever.  Hopefully good. :)"

They provide you with a menu of about 22 dishes to order and you basically order anything you want.  For a solo diner, they recommend ordering two at a time and four to five dishes at a time if you're with a group.\n\nHere in chronological order is what I ordered:\n\nEmpanada with Cinnamon Butter  -- http://bit.ly/1SxW5oq\nThis was like an amuse bouche and came with the Border Brunch.\n\nTomatillo Egg Benedict -- http://bit.ly/1BtOm6v\nCornmeal battered tomatillo, hominy grits, epazote hollandaise, roasted tomato, baked kale\nThis was a good dish to start with.  Fried green tomato with a nice runny egg on top.  Delicious!!!\n\nBreakfast Fries -- http://bit.ly/1TCYAHA\nBeer braised short rib, manchego cheese, bacon, sunny side egg\nThis was very dish but I'm glad I got to try this.  It's a breakfast poutine essentially since you have cheese, short ribs, and a runny egg.  This is probably a dish better suited for a group to share because, even though this was only my 2nd dish, I was already starting to get full.\n\nSerrano Ham Waffle -- http://bit.ly/1K1R5H7\nManchego cheese, maple syrup, butter\nI liked this!  It was a good combination of sweet and savory.\n\nPeruvian Shrimp and Grits -- http://bit.ly/1IpX4Qk\nAji panca salsa, roasted green chile, creamy parmesan grits\nOrdering this seafood dish was a good way for me to get my money's worth out of the $35.  The shrimp was cooked nicely and had a very nice kick to it with the chile.  A very unique take on shrimp and grits.\n\nOyster Taco -- http://bit.ly/1ewZ4iE\nCornmeal battered oyster, flour tortilla, pickled chayote, tomato, buttermilk aioli\nAt this point, I was pretty stuffed but I still wanted to try more.  This oyster taco is really about the size of a street taco so it was only a few bites, but that was more than enough for me.  I really enjoyed it!\n\nChurro Tots -- http://bit.ly/1GxS79Z\nDulce de leche infused churros, cinnamon sugar, chocolate ganache, passion fruit puree\nFrom the beginning, I already planned on ordering this last since it's pretty much like a dessert.  As small as these tots were, they were pretty dense but had good flavor.  The two sauces worked well with them.\n\nOverall, I thought the $35 AYCE tapas Border Brunch was worth it.  But I was really limited to my stomach capacity since I only got try 6 dishes out of the 22.  I highly recommend coming with a group if you plan to try all 22 dishes.\n\nAs for Border Grill, it's a really nice restaurant!  It's a nice take on upscale Tex-Mex food similar to Mesa Grill.  I did visit the other location at the Forum Shops which I'll review later, but I like this location a lot better, especially if you can snag a table outside.  I would definitely love to come back again to them for dinner."

I have heard of it and always wanted to try it! \n\nFood pros: The brunch has a great variety of different dishes and are considered small plates. With that said they are definitely generous \"small\" portions. The price is right at $35 and to top it off you can add endless mimosas for $8. It was lots of fun ordering and tasting different dishes. My favorites were the skirt steak, shrimp and grits, frittata tart, and the waffle with pork belly. Some things I tried weren't my favorite, but that is just my personal taste. The lobster pancakes had an odd flavor and needed more lobster! That's what makes it so fun and enjoyable, there is something for everybody! Everything came out mostly hot, a couple things could have been warmer. Our server was great and accommodating especially dealing with 8 women. There are 10, that's right, 10 different flavors of mimosas! Each equally delicious and refreshing. \n\nFood cons: A few dishes weren't as hot as I would have preferred. I am sure the kitchen was crazy though as it was a busy Sunday morning. A few dishes weren't for me, but most were amazingly delicious and filled with flavor. I would suggest having a selection of the brunch menu available for ala carte or available as a full entree. \n\nService: The staff was pleasant and helpful. Our server was very busy but still attentive to our table. He was lots of fun and accommodating. \n\nI would definitely go back again! Maybe next time for lunch or dinner. I would be more likely to return for brunch if they offered their brunch items ala carte or available as a full entree. Overall it was a tasty and fun dining experience."

With an menu boasting an all-you-can-eat tapas and $5 bottomless mimosas, it really didn't take any convincing on my part, especially since we hadn't really ever been able to get to the Border Grills in LA.\n\nThe restaurant itself is contemporary looking, with big line drawings on the wall and an open feeling to it.  We were sat immediately on the outside patio that looks out over the Mandalay Bay Pool, not a bad place to sit at all.\n\nTheir menu is tapa style and you order the ones want throughout the meal.  I was determined to try them all, and got a decent way through the menu.  I think we could all agree the short rib hash was the most amazing thing we put in our mouth, but the shrimp and grits gave it a run for its money.  You also cannot leave without trying their churro tots, so make that part of your selection too!\n\nThe food was so amazing, and totally worth the price (especially because you're in Vegas) and add the $5 unlimited mimosas, and try all the different types they offer!  This is a must go to while in Vegas!"

            "review": "Wow reviews are all over the place for the Border Grill.  I think this is a make sure you order the right thing kind of place and after reading all the glowing reviews about the Carnitas, I sure did.  Do your homework people, that's what Yelp is for.\n\nI've been on a non-strip dining kick lately and down on the expensive absentee Celebrity Chef Restaurants that adorn every mega resort.  So I was pleasantly surprised that Susan Feniger & Mary Sue Milliken's Border Grill in the Mandalay Bay is serving up some great dishes worthy of the Top Chef Master's themselves.  Of course they aren't back in the kitchen, but everything I had tasted like they were.  Hats off to executive chef Michael Minor and his staff for putting a lot of love into these dishes.  I'm sure when you work in a celebrety chef's kitchen, it's hard to get any notoriety, even though you are the one making all the food.\n\nIf you've watched Susan & Mary Sue on TV over the years, you know they are about ultra fresh organic produce.  This is totally evident in their salsa and fresh seasonings mixed in their dishes.  The chips and trio of salsas, were very freshly made.  I usually don't like tomatillo salsa very much, but this was wonderful and my favorite of the three with a beautiful lime taste.  The guacamole was on the mild side allowing you to taste the avocado.  Sitting next to it on the plate was a pico de gallo, and some greens.  I'm not sure what variety, I just balanced a few on each chip along with the pico and guacamole for some extra flavor and texture.  I forgot to snap a photo of my own so here's Tracy W.'s http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#Kzcg9JBVMMUfIaA8hkgCkg\n\nThe Queso Funditio was very thick, full of melted authentic Mexican cheeses, chorizo, and roasted red peppers.  There was also a nice amount of guacamole cream on top that satisfied both looks and flavor.  Even though their chips are very thick, don't think you are going to be scooping this dip up with the chip, you will need to place it on your chip with a fork. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#T5TZf-_vEO56FHmNouqOIw\n\nThe star of the show was my Tacate Carnitas.  The shredded pork was moist and very flavorful.  It was served on a bed of roasted corn grits.  These grits were delicious and contained lots of butter for sure.  You could really taste the corn meal flavor to them bringing to mind the flavor of a tamale.  Surrounding the edge of the plate was a bold black bean puree.  The black beans are mixed with huitlacoche, which is a mushroom like fungus that grows on corn.  It has a very earthy flavor that really made these black beans something special.  How do you make a pork dish even better?  Top it with crunchy bacon of course.  Not just any bacon but chipotle glazed bacon.  It really added a texture here that made each bite enjoyable, after all there is a lot of mushy stuff on the plate.  It was served with a giant flour tortilla.  I just ripped pieces off and used it to balance all of these wonderful flavors together with each bite.  This is a true 5 star dish and the best carnitas I've had. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#Cz0ORcEa5RD1dpRQHYzCIw\n\nMy wife's dish was a little more plain, the Carne Asada Tacos.  I can see being a little disappointed with this dish, especially in comparison with my carnitas.  The chopped up carne asada was a little dry and needed to be dressed up with salsa and topped with some black beans and oaxaca cheese, otherwise it just seemed like plain old street tacos with a $18 price tag.  The two different kinds of rice were nicely infused with fresh herbs, although it added to the dryness of the plate. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#pdMM2_CIiWmmresjLS3jcA\n\nWe came here for lunch on a weekday, thinking it should be no wait, but was packed.  The location is right next to all the conference rooms at the Mandalay Bay, thus everyone was dressed in suits and trying to grab a quick nearby bite.  After a few minute wait we got a table outside on the patio overlooking the Mandalay Bay Pool.  It wasn't too hot since it was April, but I couldn't help but notice they have a Big Ass Fan that covers the whole patio.  It's the size of an airplane propeller.  It's one Big Ass Fan. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#lhl0l6qC71PlGeAfLc012w  I'm now a Big Ass Fan of Border Grill, go have the Tecate Carnitas and you'll be a Big Ass Fan too!"

I had heard about the restaurant from my boss, who said it was a must-visit during my trip (he'd only been to the Santa Monica restaurant).\n\nGreat service.\n\nFood was ok. My boyfriend and I had eaten lunch at the Bellagio Buffet earlier in the day so we didn't get into the restaurant until around 10pm. Neither of us was very hungry, but we did need to eat something.\n\nWe got guacamole for an appetizer. For the amount of guac, the appetizer was fairly overpriced. I've also made guacamole at home that was better than this stuff.\n\nMy boyfriend got a quesadilla off of the appetizers section, which had chicken and several Mexican cheeses in it. He thought it was delicious.\n\nI got the watercress, avocado, and orange salad. I don't eat meat, and so my boyfriend ate the bacon off of the dates so that I could include them in the salad's taste profile (even though the bacon taste lingered...). I blame myself for completely not noticing that there was bacon in the description... so no blame with the server or kitchen there.\n\nThe dressing was wayyyyy thick in the salad, to the point where I asked if they could make me a new one with dressing on the side. The dressing was also a very weird flavor profile. Lots of black pepper and sour/saltiness that just sort of overwhelmed everything else in the bite. I didn't even taste coriander, just sour/salty/peppery grossness.\n\nThe server was very accommodating about the dressing, and had a new salad ready pretty fast.\n\nI had a delicious coconut lemonade, which was the highlight of the meal for me. My boyfriend had a watermelon mojito, which was ok, but he commented that the fresh mint was strangely overpowering the watermelon flavor, which he wasn't sure combined well with the mint.\n\nWe also had the Tres Leches cake boxed up for us so we could eat it later, and it was delicious."

As others have said, it's all you can eat and you keep ordering 2-3 items at a time rather than continually trekking to the buffet. The downside is you wait to stuff your piehole, the plus is your food is always fresh. I liked everything I tried but the shrimp n' grits (with a spicy tomato sauce and lots of shrimp), churro tots, and the fried chicken with blue corn waffle stood out. I'm also not usually a mimosa guy but the $10 for unlimited is worth it here since they have lots of different types including peach, strawberry, coconut, pineapple (order this one half coconut and half pineapple). \n\nService was very friendly but even the waiter commented at one point that the food was slow. We sat outside on the patio on a warm and sunny day so it was a good brunch. I'd come back here for all you can eat brunch. Oh and a wedding reception was taking place inside right behind us so that was a little weird that we could see the whole thing."

Border Grill is actually in between the convention center and the casino so decided to check out Vegas's location.\n\nThe place was pretty packed, thanks to the convention crowds.  Originally I wanted to grab a seat at the bar since I was by myself, but Vegas was storming, so the end of the bar was actually wet from water leaking from the roof!  Mandalay Bay definitely was showing its age... but I was able to grab a small table at the bar area without waiting thanks to one of the really friendly waitress!\n\nI've been the LA's Border Grill a few times, but only for happy hour so I was pretty excited to check out the regular menu.  Asked the waiter what his favorite was and went with the Carne Asada Quesedilla.  It's essentially their carne asada, with several types of cheeses.  It's not the best carne asada I've had, but the beef was good.  Quality's good and I like how the tortilla is crunchy.  I wish it was cheesier but the pico de gallo and the guac goes very well with the quesedilla!  If you want to add rice & beans, it's an additional $4 on top of the $18 for the quesedilla.  A little pricey for quesedilla, but the quality's good.\n\nFood alone, it probably was a little average, but the service was great, from the waitress that helped me at the beginning, to my server.\n\nThey definitely need to fix the leaking problem though :P"

Got hooked up on Restaurants.com for a wickedly good deal.

Sorta feels like a reject location since you pass like 18 sub-par restaurants on the way there. \nAnyway...we sat on the patio despite it being 100+ degrees at 7:30 pm.

We ordered guacamole as our appetizer not anticipating we would be getting more appetizers with our meal. Guacamole was perfectly seasoned, no sour cream or mayo or whatever some places put in it...just perfect. We probably ate 3 baskets of chips. \n\nChose the Top Chef prix fixe dinner.

And it wasn't. \n\nThe only thing was that they stressed that the tuna would be lightly seared, but I received it fully cooked through, possibly even slightly overdone. But somehow it maintained its moisture and it was incredibly delicious. \n\nBanana flan. As if flan could be better?

I can go to a mid-level CHAIN Mexican restaurant and watch tableside FRESH guacamole being made, including all the ingredients/spices, etc.. A \"ball\" of avocado - That's it- that's all. I had to photograph it to believe it. Tasteless presentation. We asked for a few extra tortillas, since so few came with the Queso Fundido. They said \"that's a side we have to charge for\". Our bill for 4 people was $180 (only one pitcher of Marg's), and they have to charge extra for warm tortillas?\nThe Margaritas were the only thing that brought it up from \"zero stars\" to \"1 star\". \nI had the flat iron steak. Overly seasoned, a decent cut of meat, preparation with too much oil.\nThe food was mediocre and over-seasoned. The two women \"chefs\" from New York need to go back to cooking school in my opinion. There are dozens of alternative choices to this place - I will seek them out next time.\nI also concur with another reviewer- There IS such a thing as  \"too much service\".

I should just hand over $10 bucks, have them punch me in the face and then tell them to keep the change.  Guac was perfectly fine, but not for $9.  Crab nachos were a good sized portion, but light on the crab.  Again, no surprise given that this place is stingy when it comes to the good ingredients.

The wait was long, but since I'd booked on opentable, we were seated immediately.\n\nFirst, the service.  Our server (Carmie I believe) had a ton of tables, yet she checked on us frequently and never left us with empty champagne classes.  She was so sweet.  We did unlimited small plates, and she started us off with some of her favorite/the most popular dishes and then let us order anything we wanted.  Even though she was obviously super busy, she had a huge happy smile all the time, and managed to chat with us for a moment each time she stopped by.  I don't know how people like her do it.\n\nSecond, the food. It was outrageously good. I can't believe I've never had breakfast small plates before - you don't have to choose! The shrimp and grits, short rib hash, and frittata were favorites with us.  We ate like kings for a super reasonable price, in a cute location.  We were STUFFED - brunch was at noon, and none of us was hungry for dinner at 7pm.\n\nBy VEGAS standards, this place is $$ I think; by yelp's listed standard, it's $$$.

I wanted to like the smoked paprika fries, but honestly, nothing special.\nCitrus Chicken quesadilla was easily the best quesadilla I've been able to try in my somewhat limited experience.\n\n4 people, $100 lunch all told.  Tasty food and good atmosphere.  Worth a second trip for sure."

To be sure, when I woke up hungover, I dove into my cold steak quesadilla I left sitting out in our room overnight, and it was still freakin' delicious. \n\nFound out about this gem from my friend's co-worker. It was all the way at the opposite end of the strip from us, but SO worth it! Started out with an amazing pina colada with toasted coconut on the edge of the glass. (Because the best thing to do when very drunk is keep drinking, of course. Well...at least in Vegas) Only complaint was that it was SO thick that I couldn't even get it through the straw! Had to wait til it melted a bit, and even then, was still difficult to get. For appetizers we started with chips, salsa, and guacamole. All items were SO fresh and the chips were salty and delicious. We ordered some quinoa fritters which were amazing and definitely unique! Quinoa and cheese deep friend in batter...heavenly. That's what I love about this place, they make healthy eating fun, by dipping the healthy food in melted cheese and then deep frying it. Ordered queso fundido which was perfection and probably the best I have ever had. Sooooo creamy, cheesy, and flavorful. It was a bowl of melted cheese sauce with a crunchy layer of cheese on top, which is the best idea in humanity's history. Afterwards, got a steak quesadilla which was PERFECT. The most flavorful steak I have ever had in a quesadilla. Even the next morning it was to die for. I'm happy that even though I was drunk when I met this quesadilla and took its leftovers home, when I woke up the next morning and it was still delicious, I was able to say I took home a \"10\" the night before. I feel like this is one of those places you never hear people talk about, but I do...all of the time. GO! The hype is real!"

The portions are very large, and they serve great salads, gauc, and holy moly - the tamales are the best!\n\nTry the sangria or a house margarita - and as a side note, if you do take out they will put your drink in a To-Go cup (gotta love that :)\n\nWe have always had great service - I would highly recommend this spot if you are staying in Mandalay Bay (or somewhere nearby) as a delicious, reasonably priced spot with great food and drink."

There were a few good things, which is why I gave them two stars.  But the screwups were so bad, and even when the management was made aware of them and didn't really compensate us for it that I'm almost tempted to give them just one star for being so shitty.\n\nSo we came here because we were catching the Muse show just down the hall at Mandalay Bay Events Center.  We had a restaurant.com certificate we wanted to use, and we had seen Susan Feniger on Top Chef Masters perform very well and thought that would translate into a good meal at her restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the following:\nSangria Margaritas - was too sweet but ok\nQueso Fundido - was good but didn't like all the guac all over the place, and not enough cheese to call it a queso dish.\nWatercress, Avocado, and Orange Salad - loved this salad, nice and refreshing\nFish Tacos - see below, these were awful\nGrilled Skirt Steak - one of the highlights of the meal\n\nI want to specifically highlight that even though we ordered the queso fundido, the waiter did not actually order this dish for us, and accidentally ordered the beef sopes.  When we told the waiter there was a mistake and did not order the sopes, the waiter apologized profusely and said the manager of the restaurant was going to talk to us, insinuating that the restaurant would comp us for having to have us wait for them to make new appetizers.  She came up to us and apologized and said they were going to hurry with the fundido, but no comp.  We weren't sure why she bothered apologizing since the waiter did already.\n\nOnce we finally got our main courses, I had ordered the fish tacos which I had heard were some of the best in town.  I took a bite and they were stinky, fishy smelling, and bland.  I hated it.  I inspected the dish more and the fish did not seem to even be properly cooked, and the fact that it smelled made me question how fresh the fish was.  There was also supposed to be a crema on the tacos, but there was no crema here.  This dish was so bad, I actually complained to the waiter and the manager at how awful it was.  The manager actually tried to argue with me that the dish was fine.  Eventually, she took the dish and said they were going to remake it, but I didn't really want a remade dish, I just wanted to send it back and not get another because it was so bad.  However, they remade it, charged me for it anyhow. I had lost my appetite from the experience but took a bite to be polite, and it was better but I was too scared to put a good dent in it, thinking they were going to try to kill me with bad fish.  I took the rest to go and threw it away. \n\nAnyway, we'll probably never go here again unless Susan Feniger herself calls and apologizes for such a crappy meal."

This place was highly recommended on the gluten free sites and showed on their website to have a dedicated gluten free menu, so needless to say I was pumped to check it out. \n\nThe hostess was not very friendly. I gotta say that I am a stickler for happy, positive employees because they are the face of your business and crucial to customer satisfaction. \n\nI was pleased to see such a large gluten free menu until I opened it and realized 2 of the pages were filled with alcohol choices. \n\nWe decided to try the Queso Fundido, which they brought out with corn tortillas and the chips are gluten free there. The dip was pretty tasty for sure but it didn't knock my socks off. \n\nOur waiter was aware of celiac disease and gluten free preparations so that made me feel at ease too during our time there. \n\nI ordered a shrimp and rice which came out on a plate filled with rice and then a strip of shrimp down the middle. The rice was in a pool of liquids making it a bit soggy. I have to say that I can't stand wet rice so I just ate the rice off the top and picked at the shrimp. The dish was disappointing and I didn't leave there feeling like I had an amazing gluten free dish coming from somewhere that specifically has a gluten free menu. The cost of my 10 small shrimp and rice was also $28 which I found to be completely out of line for the quality of the dish. \n\nNow, had that dish come out and completely wowed me, I wouldn't blink at spending $28 on vacation in Las Vegas for dinner. It just didn't do it for me so I can tell you I won't likely go back on my trip to Las Vegas next year. \n\nI would recommend Border Grill because they are educated and understand gluten free meals but I'm not sure it would be my first pick for someone. It's the safe choice."

Of course did a quick survey of Yelp reviews prior to dinner to make sure we weren't walking into a minefield.\n\nActually the prices were quite reasonable, even taking into account being in Vegas...appetizers were $8 to 12, entrees $20 to 35, and desserts (which we didn't have room for) were all around $8. Plus their \"prix fixe\" deal is pretty good at $39, considering that you aren't limited to certain entree or dessert options as per usual (hence the quotes) but can pick anything off the menu. So pricewise not out of line for any nice big city downtown restaurant.\n\nWe were brought chips and a selection of salsa verde, a chipotle salsa, and a \"regular\" hot salsa. The chips were good, freshly made and crunchy and not greasy. The salsa verde might be too acidic for some, but I like vinegar...the chipotle salsa was quite good too.\n\nWe then split a queso fundido appetizer that was surprisingly large (easily could have been split amongst four). The queso came out bubbling and with a dollop of guac. Suffice to say I would have licked the serving platter if I could have gotten away with it, but I had to settle for using the flour tortilla (also yum) instead.\n\nOur entrees (tecate carnitas and cochinita pibil) were also surprisingly large. I can't resist me some good pork, so I was in heaven with the carnitas. The BF's beef was also awesome, the only thing I thought was just ok was the rice, but I have a hard time liking anything but short grain white rice, you know how Asians roll.\n\nEverything was full of flavor AND in large portions. The atmosphere is appropriate for the price, and our server was prompt, attentive, and even threw in an intermission tip for while Simba was taking a breather.\n\nA good choice for some upscale Mexican prior to a show at Mandalay, or even just in general!"

Otherwise, you'll have to trek a ways from the main casino (which isn't bad, considering you can walk off the calories on the way back).\n\nTip 2:  If you like really really hot salsa, like the addictive kind that makes you cry but you just can't stop eating it, ask your server for the \"diablo\" salsa.\n\nTip 3:  If the climate is decent (sunny, 70's-80's) ask if you can be seated out on the patio for nice ambiance."

We have been to Border Grill in Santa Monica for happy hour, and really enjoyed the tacos we ate there, but when we saw the brunch menu here, we were sold.  You see, my husband is a huge fan of anything \"all you can eat\", but I don't love buffets because the food is often mediocre and the thought of people digging through the same food kind of skeeves me out.  Border Grill serves an \"all you can eat\" brunch for $34.99 per person, but you actually order small plates off a menu.  The best of both worlds for us, especially when for an additional $8, you can add bottomless mimosas!\n\nWe made a reservation via Open Table for 11am, and were sat at a great table on the patio overlooking the pool area at Mandalay Bay.  We started off ordering 2 dishes each, and subsequently 1 dish each thereafter.  We never felt rushed by our server, which was a pleasant surprise.  Before our first dishes came, we were brought some delicious flaky empanadas, and the best corn tamales I've ever had (not being a fan of tamales, this was a great surprise)!  The mimosas were great, generous on the champagne, and there were many flavors to sample.  We had the typical orange juice mimosas, as well as peach, pomegranate, and my favorite, cucumber lemon.  Here is a list of the items we sampled, in the order we ate them, and our assessment:\n\nBreakfast Enchilada- good, but the corn tortilla was hard to cut\nShrimp and Grits- DELICIOUS, shrimp were cooked perfectly\nSkirt Steak and Eggs- best thing on the menu.  The steak was perfectly medium rare and well seasoned\nShort Rib Hash and Egg- average\n\nCrispy Potato Rajas Taco- crispy and yummy\nBiscuits and Sausage Gravy- gravy was delish but 1 biscuit would have been plenty\n\nBreakfast Fries- smothered french fries, so delicious and bad for you, in a good way\nBacon Jalapeno PBJ- a unique blending of flavors, but I didn't love it as much as I thought I would\n\nLobster Pancake- I enjoyed this, my husband did not like\nWaffle with Pork Belly and Syrup- a wonderful blend of sweet and savory\n\nSkirt Steak and Eggs- SO GOOD WE ORDERED IT AGAIN BUT CAN'T FINISH IT\nBread Pudding French Toast- decadent and delicious, but I'm starting to feel like there's a brick in my stomach\n\nChurro Tots- oh dear God we ordered too much and I feel like I might die\n\nThe food was so delicious we could not stop eating until we literally felt like we were going to explode.  It was all so amazing and delicious.  I don't regret our gluttonous brunch whatsoever because the food was just that yummy.  Suffice it to say we wobbled back to our hotel, took a food/champagne nap, and didn't eat much of anything for the rest of the day.  It was so worth it, and I can't wait to go back to Border Grill for brunch so I can experience Death by All You Can Order Brunch once again."

Now it's our go-to Mexican place when we're craving South of the Border flavors in Vegas.\n\nAfter a long-ish trek past all the other restaurants and convention areas in the Mandalay Bay is the colorful and tasteful Border Grill.  The margaritas are great and a pitcher goes quickly.  The chips and three salsas are quite tasty...  And now on to the real stuff!\n\nMy sister swears the steak she ordered at Border Grill was one of the best she's ever had.  And she's had a lot of steak.   My mom's half chicken?  Moist and flavorful.  My kobe beef tacos were delicious.  The carnitas were a bit dry, but the flavor was good.\n\nWe were too full for dessert.\n\nThe staff - from the host to the servers to the busboy - were a delight."

They offer an AYCE brunch special, ordered from their Tapas menu with available bottomless Mimosas if you're into that. They also have a small, standard mexican menu for those not into the AYCE like my wife. They have a great selection of various dishes from our favorite, the Chilaquiles, to a breakfast sandwich and pretty much a little of everything in between. The food was served fresh and the service was solid. I didn't notice anyone with an empty drink for anymore than a few moments. And since nearly all of us were doing the AYCE, we constantly had various plates of food to eat on the table. One thing that stood out to me was how loud this place was, definitely above average as I found myself speaking quite loud just so the person sitting across from me could hear. As for value, be prepared to open your wallet. as this place is pretty pricey."

Have hit up Border Grill's epic brunch a couple different times and always left extremely full and happy. We've basically tried every dish and mimosa on the menu, there's something for every taste. The servers know how to keep the food and drinks coming, and the outside seating is a nice reprieve from being in the casinos all day/night. Perfect way to leisurely fuel up before hitting the Strip all day. Just do it!"

Well, when the better half and I stopped into Border Grill during a trip to MMS they had a Seafood Enchilada with a creamy sherry sauce.\n\nI hoped against hope that it was the same thing.\n\nUnfortunately it was 35 dollars. And it wasn't the same.\n\nI grant you this is entirely my expectations vs. reality.  But because it wasn't what I wanted it to be, I didn't really care for it. So it felt like 35 dollars wasted.  The better half got the Quesadillas which WERE really good. So she was happy.\n\nMy other frustration is the Las Vegas Mexican restaurant trick of asking if you want \"Fresh Guacamole\". This is code for \"Would you like to pay 9 more dollars?\"  They rarely inform you it's an extra cost and they ask so nicely. Don't be fooled.  Fortunately I knew from a previous bad experience.\n\nThe chips and salsa were very good, and our waiter was excellent.  When I explained the Chi-Chis story he said \"What's Chi-Chi's\".  (Now I feel old!)\n\nOverall, I can't say it was bad, and as long as you don't mind the somewhat high cost of the Mexican food. I would absolutely come back for the Quesadillas"

Drinks were really yummy, so that was a plus.   We all had food coma afterward, which was not good for trying to go out after, but a great meal is always good.\n\nService was okay but our water glasses were not filled very much and once the food was ordered, they didn't come by much to check on us.  Overall, check it out if you eat meat/fish.  For vegetarians, there are not too many options to check out the menu first before going."

Not everything was a winner but it was fun to try everything and wonder what would come out next.   Dishes are tapas size, but you do get full pretty quick.  It was very hard not to fill ourselves with their freshly made chips and salsa.  The chips were warm and with just the right amount of salt.  They were totally addictive.  \nI wish I could remember the amazing server we had.  She was so friendly. She chose the best dishes from the menu for us to try, and we weren't disappointed.   I asked for duck chilaquelles (sp) at the end because that was the dish I wanted to order full size at first.  I'm glad I didn't because I wasn't too crazy about that dish, but it could have been because I was so stuffed from eating 6-7 dishes at that point.  \nI think it was a nice break from Vegas high-end buffets.  You pay about the same but get the full service experience and prettier presentation.  We didn't have room for dessert at the end,  unfortunately.  If you have a big appetite, do give Border Grill a try."

The food, service and atmosphere are all fantastic. In my opinion, whoever gave this place less than four stars doesn't know what great Mexican food tastes like and should stick to chain restaurants like El Toritos.  \n  The staff at BG is amazing. Everyone is friendly and welcoming from the moment you check in. We love to sit in Jamie's section because she is friendly, very attentive and full of energy. She is also very knowledgeable about the menu and how the items are prepared. She goes above and beyond to make sure we are happy. We never feel rushed or pushed to leave so that they can turn the table. That's rare at most restaurants in Vegas.\n  When you first arrive at your table you are welcomed with a basket of fresh  homemade tortilla chip and a trio of homemade salsas. Its a great way to start your evening. I love to order the guacamole as well. Its chunky, thick and simply delicious.\n  As far as drinks are concerned, I have tried many of them and have yet to be unhappy with a single one. The selection of mixed drinks are fabulous. I am, however, a big fan of the red sangria. Its just the right mix of wine and juice and it goes well with the chips and guacamole.\n  If you are in the mood to try a Border Grill culinary feast then I highly recommend you order the Ultimate Border Grill Experience. You get a trio of appetizers, an entree of your choice, and then a dessert of your choice. You really cant go wrong with this deal!\n  My ABSOLUTE favorite dish on the menu is the BBQ beef short ribs. They are wickedly delicious and mouth watering good.  The ribs are so tender that they fall apart and melt in your mouth.  The BBQ sauce has just enough kick to it, but isn't overpowering. The ribs are served atop a creamy corn polenta that is to die for.  I sometimes crave the dish... which, I must say, is worth driving to Vegas for.\n  Dessert is my thing and honestly you can't go wrong with any of the desserts on the menu. I have tried many of them and I haven't been disappointed yet.\n  Border Grill is definitely worth going to while in Vegas!!"

At the bar, I ordered a Sangria Margarita.  This drink is so good, but I order it with sugar on the rim in lieu of salt (salted rims are really gross to me).  The drink came with the a salted rim.  I am not one to send something back so I just wiped the salt off and moved along.  At the table the second drink I ordered was also incorrect.  Our waiter kind of lacked personality. I asked him if he knew where their new 2nd Las Vegas location was opening. He explained he \"wasn't moving there so he didn't know.\" and seemed visibly annoyed when I asked him if he could ask another server for me. Then he never answered the question. \n\nDespite this review, based solely on my experience last night, I would still recommend this spot.

When we walked up, it looked very busy and no open seats.  We asked how long the wait was and the hostess told us there was seating downstairs at the bar and also on the patio!  \n\nSince we didn't know what to order, our waiter/bartender recommended the Queso Fundido!  It was so delicious.  With the chorizo added in, it had a great unique flavor.  I think we would have licked the bowl if it wasn't frowned upon. \n\nHe also recommended the Border Classic which had 2 of three appetizers.  This was perfect for us.  Tomales, Chicken Tacos and Empanadas.  Yum!  \n\nIf you are here for an event or just a fun night, definitely stop in!  Great service and great food!"

My least favorite was the tomatillo eggs. So sour and the breading this restaurant uses is gross. It's like corn meal not ground up and it's just...not ok.

The high points were definitely the steak and eggs, chilaquiles, the frittata, pbj & bacon sandwich and the giant fruit plate (with passionfruit sauce!) that they brought out initially. Everything is made to order, so you get the variety of going to say, a buffet, but also the freshness of eating in a regular restaurant. The service was very friendly as well, so no complaints there. At $35 per person, you definitely need to bring your appetite, but I still would highly recommend."

After spending a little too long on the lazy river at Mandalay Beach and floating by the sign one too many times we decided that the Border Grill would be the perfect place for lunch!\n\nTo start the fresh chips and salsa were great although the salsa verde had a strange after taste that we couldn't place and made for a weird lingering on the palate. This salsa bad enough to take away a star!\n\nWe started with the Border Classics on suggestion from a fellow yelper that the Plantain Empanadas were a must. The Border Classic is a sampler platter consisting of 2 Plantain Empanadas, 2 Green Corn Tamales, and 2 Chicken Panuchos. The Plantain Empanadas were amazing both sweet and savory all at once and a hint of Queso Fresco in every bite. The Green Corn Tamales almost brought tears to my eyes because they were the first sweet corn tamale that has ever come close to the ones my Great Aunt used to make me when I was a kid! As for the Chicken Panuchos my wife Bogarted those because she hated the other two choices, but her loss was definitely my gain!\n\nFor a main dish we went with the Albacore Avocado Ceviche which did not disappoint! It was half an avocado pilled high with sushi-grade albacore and a decadent lime-salsa mixture! The only thing that was missing was a spicy kick to top of the flavor combinations.\n\nTo top it off the waitress we had was super attentive, knew the menu by heart, and even warned us not to over order when we tried to add another entree to our order before we had even seen the appetizers. We will definitely be back to the Border Grill!"

The cost of the brunch is $25 and it is \"all you can eat\" but none of it is buffet style, instead they have created 17 items that are all tapas sized so that you can try any number of them and share them with your dining partners. The server mentioned that you could amp up the brunch with all you could drink mimosa's for only $5 more but we did not partake, this time ;-). The brunch is served downstairs on the patio that is located next to Mandalay Beach so when the weather is perfect like it was this past weekend you can enjoy the elements and the food. \n\nEvery brunch starts off with the Chips & Salsa Trio.. all 3 salsas are great but the tomatillo is PERFECT. I wish I had read the review telling me to ask for the spicy salsa but I will save that surprise for my next visit. \n\nWe shared the following dishes: \n\nHuevo Ranchero - Not my favorite dish, there was something about about the sauce that I wasn't fond of. BUT, the next item was great... \n\nBreakfast Enchilada - This is not your typical rolled enchilada but it is a stacked version that was delicious. I would order this one again. \n\nCoconut French Toast - This was the biggest surprise of the brunch. The coconut was not overpowering and the sourdough bread was perfectly cooked. \n\nBiscuit and Sausage Gravy - Not much \"Mexican\" about this dish but the sausage gravy was great and the buttermilk corn biscuit was yummy. \n\nMini Breakfast Burrito, Chorizo and Egg Taco and the Carne Asada Taco - All were very good. \n\nMachaca Chilaquiles - This was my FAVORITE dish of the day. I could have eaten a full sized order of this or multiple small sized portions. Chilaquiles is something that I am always on the look out for and once you add amazing beef brisket you get a dish that you will remember forever. \n\nOverall the atmosphere, food and service were great and I would go back for this brunch anytime. If you are in Vegas or come to Vegas and don't try this brunch you might possibly regret it for the rest of your life..."

The walls are painted it with whites, mustard and rust tones with interesting pop art. The wood detailing in the walls and ceiling is amazing! My only caveat is, if you are coming during lunch hour, it gets quite loud!\n\nService: Our server, Tamara,  was very pleasant, accommodating, and attentive. Even though the place was packed for lunch, we did not feel like we were to be rushed in and out. With modifications being made to our dishes, she was very accommodating and nice about it. Which was appreciated!\n\nFood: I could rave all day about their chips and salsa! There's actually FOUR different types of salsa, but you have to ask for the spiciest one, and I hear it doesn't get made every day! But so worth it! I highly, highly recommend the chipotle chicken quesadilla! I feel like I died and went to heaven with that quesadilla! The flavor was so robust but not overpowering, and the tortilla was perfectly grilled, with just the right amount of crispness.\n\nAll in all, a great little pit-stop on our tour of Vegas!"

So, definitely not your typical taco/burrito/quesadilla joint. \n\nThat said, I think they're going for a more upscale vibe the likes of spots like Rosa Mexicano in NYC. While the food fits, the atmosphere is off for such a place, as there's no denying you're in a Vegas food court."

It was pretty quite when we got there at 10am on a Saturday, but by 1pm when we left (yes, we brunched for 3 hours but wouldn't you if the mimosas just kept coming?!?) the patio was full.\n\nOur table looked directly out on the pool and palm trees on THEhotel.  Our server was very attentive, telling us about the option of either ordering from the regular lunch menu or getting the brunch, which consisted of your choice of 22 tapas-style brunch items ($34.99) to which you could add unlimited mimosas ($8) in a variety of flavors including pomegranate, lemon ginger, and apple basil.\n\nOf course, having done our research, we chose the tapas brunch, each starting with 2-3 small plates and progressing until we tried nearly all of the 22 dishes among the three of us.  The brisket hash, churro tots, potato tacos, and manchaca benedict were some of our favorites, but really none of the dishes we had were bad.  We sampled all of each other's dishes and no one left hungry.  The server did not rush us and we enjoyed several rounds of mimosas after the meal, making for a great start to the weekend!!  \n\nIt's truly a gourmet dining experience in a relaxed atmosphere.

These were really delicious, you could really taste the plantains. I could sit on my sofa at home and eat thirty of these things.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Carnitas which were tasty, though I would have preferred them in Tacos. I know I was taking a little risk ordering differently from usual. The carnitas came with some small, fluffy tortillas and a variety of fixin's - pico de gallo (which was a little sour), a slaw of some sort, guacamole, and a little salad of chopped red onion and cilantro. Overall it was very good, though I'd probably order more in line with my usual preferences next time.\n\nMy wife had the Mushroom Mulita which she enjoyed very much, although I'll let her go into that in greater detail when she writes her own review.\n\nWe had enjoyed our experience here so much that we were tempted into dessert. Something I really like about Border Grill is they let you get half slices of two of the dessert options for $9 as an alternative to a whole slice of one of them for $8. This lets you try two different things.  We went with the Flourless Chocolate Truffle Cake - absolutely melt-in-your-mouth incredible, and the Pastel Rufina, a sort of cream cheese cake in puff pastry and topped with profiterole-like objects. This came accompanied with an attractively arranged display of fresh berries. The Pastel Rufina, even for a half slice, was enormous and we couldn't finish the thing between the two of us. I'd hate to have to finish off a full sized slice!\n\nWhile Border Grill is a little on the expensive side, the restaurant.com coupon really brings it down into the realms of casual affordability. The food here is prepared with a deft hand and is really delicious. I can't wait to try the lunch options!"

This was my 1st time back since then, and a large group (7 of us) dined for brunch on Father's Day.\n\nThe restaurant offers an awesome brunch on Saturdays and Sundays.  It's $35 per person for all you can eat small plates and an additional $8 if you would like bottomless mimosas - which is the way to go....I ordered a bloody mary, which was not very good and came in a very small glass and was $11. :(  Anyhow, they didn't offer anything different for Father's Day, which was great.\n\n5 people in our group arrived early and were sat before I (the reservation holder) even got there.  That's all fine and dandy, but kind of weird, because the other 5 people didn't know each other, and I wasn't even there yet.  I don't feel like they should be seating people before the reservation holder is even present.  Whatevs.  Also, there appears to be some sort of construction going on, because a large part of the downstairs was curtained off.  And there was a VERY foul smell - it started while we were in the walkway outside of the restaurant and smelled like sewer.  While it may have nothing to do with the restaurant, it was pretty disgusting.\n\nOur server was very friendly.  She started out by saying that, with larger groups, she likes to serve everything family style, and rather than have everyone order, just send out some of the favorites and most popular items on the menu.  We all agreed that sounded good.  So the food started coming.  Wow, it was delicious and seemed endless.  Some of the things were really good, some we didn't like so much...but each person at the table had varying tastes, so everything was devoured.\n\nThe meal started out with some fresh fruit and emapandas and then other items came out from there.  Some of the favorites were: sweet potato pancakes, chilaquiles, breakfast fries, steak and eggs and the bread pudding french toast.  Some of the less favorite items were: shrimp and grits (I liked them, but a few people thought they were too spicy), lobster pancakes (I also like these, but most of the diners were expecting something sweet, because they were pancakes, but they were savory), and the hash and eggs.\n\nHere is an important note: there are eggs on EVERYTHING.  So if you aren't a fan of eggs or have super high cholesterol or something, maybe this isn't the place for you.....\n\nAs I said before, the bottomless mimosas are by far the way to go, even if you plan on having only 1.  $8 is a great price, and they had a TON of flavors to choose from.  In hindsight, I wish that I would've ordered these.  There were orange, peach, watermelon (the tables favorite), pomegrante, etc etc.\n\nThere was some confusion when it came to the check, because there was auto-gratuity added, although their policy states for \"parties of 8 or more,\" and there were only 7 of us.  Our reservation was originally for 8, but we had 1 no-show.  Although our server was very friendly, she was a bit slow, and I do think we would've tipped more had the auto-gratuity not been on the check already. Or if we had been at least told about it beforehand.\n\nThis is one of the better brunch deals in town, based off of the creativity and quality of the food, the atmosphere and of course the cost. $35 per is well worth it!"

Then it started to go downhill from there. There was a huevos ranchero dish that was kind of bland and boring. Then we had these salmon sliders. I wanted to like these so badly but the prominent taste was goat cheese and it was too overpowering that I had a bite and I was done with it. The next dish was a PBJ with a jalapeno in it. The waiter raved that it was the best thing ever, he lied. It made me feel regret if anything. The other items we had seemed like the same thing just with different sauce: biscuit eggs sauce. So boring I cant even remember them. Then there was the churros. I will shit you not, these were literally donut holes with hersheys syrup and a nasty orange thing with it. The bacon bloody mary was OK and for an extra $10 unlimited mimosas but it didn't make up for the food.\n\nSusan Feniger is one of my favorite chiefs and was so underwhelmed by this restaurant.

Located in the restaurant wing of Mandalay Bay, it's definitely a trek to get here, but totally worth the trip (if you get to the Shark Reef you've walked too far.)\n\nI would recommend making reservations, but it's not necessary.

Well, as you might have guessed there are a fair selection of drinks with Mexican/Spanish roots on the menu, but my friend and I choose a drink special that evening:  the Cranberry mojito.  Priced at a Vegas-reasonable $9.00, it was a definitely a cool and refreshing start to our meal.\n\nTo start, we ordered the fresh house guacamole.  YOU MUST order the guacamole should you choose to dine here.  Not ordering the guacamole would be a travesty on your part.  It would be something like vacationing in Vegas but NOT gambling.  Ok enough said.  I should mention that there are complimentary chips and salsa with your meal as well.  The chips come with 3 types of salsa:  roasted pablano, tomatillo, & red jalape\u00f1o.  In addition to our guacamole, we decided to split a chicken empanadas from the appetizer menu.  This was served with pumpkin mole` and apple salad.  So delicious and just wonderful overall.\n\nFor dinner, I decided to order the chicken enchiladas, while my friend decided on a special for that evening, the turkey rienos with mole sauce.  I would have to admit that after sampling my friend's food, I would say I liked his much better than mine.  Don't get me wrong, my chicken enchiladas were delicious, a great dish overall.  It's just that I thought my friend's dish was well.....just better.  Needless to say, we both were very satisfied with our food and finished every single morsel on the plate, even most of the sauce was gone.  Just vanished.  2 dinner entrees and 2 cranberry mojitos later, we were 2 satisfied but stuffed customers!  \n\nSERVICE:  Terrific.  Wonderful.  Phenomenal.  Excellent.  I could think of more adjectives but I think you get the picture.  The service was some of the best I've ever experienced in Vegas...ever.  Our server was just so \"on it\" the entire evening.  And when we mentioned that this wasn't our first time dining here, she said something to the effect of thanking us for choosing to dine here again.  After a wonderful meal, she provided us with a complimentary sorbet for dessert.  Now THAT was the icing on the cake.  Fantastic service.\n\nBottom Line:  Make sure to head to Border Grill to experience some of the best Mexican food and customer service Vegas has to offer.  You won't be disappointed."

Exceptional service, and uber friendly staff all around, from greeters, servers, to bartenders. We had zero wait and almost had the whole restaurant to ourselves since we had the first seating available at 10:00am. It was frying outside already, we sat indoors.\n\nReally good food though. Sharon kept the food coming with a \"Surprise us\" request. We tried most everything. Both the wife & I loved the shrimp & grits best. It had a near-perfect blend of richness and heat. The wife liked the sweet corn tamales 2nd best, followed by the chicken tamales. My next 2 favorite dishes were the Breakfast Fries followed by the crunchy and tangy Chilaquilles.\n\nWife tried the unlimited mimosas for $10 but was greatly dissppointed in the lack of flavoring. \n\nDefinetly 4 stars here. Would've given 5 stars if the food had actually been a little hotter, rather than just a little warmer than lukewarm. \n\nWorth a try!"

But then it arrived... :(  I've had a lot of Peruvian food, and this wasn't even close.  The fish wasn't fresh and there wasn't a trace of lime juice that I could see or taste.  The fish was covered in a sticky paste that I assume was supposed to be the aji pepper paste, but that should have been mixed in with a good helping of lime juice.  I can't remember the last time I sent something back, but I was happy to get this off the table!  Our server was really nice about it though... she removed it from the check with no problem.\n\nWe then got our entrees... I had the carnitas tacos, my husband had the beef tacos, and our friend had the corn tamales (she's veggie.)  They both enjoyed their entrees, but I found mine a bit bland.  Rice and black bean puree was good, though.\n\nWith all the amazing restaurants in Vegas, there's no point in going back to one that, to me, was really lackluster.  One BIG star for the tres leches dessert... now THAT was awesome!"

I've been here a few times for their weekend brunch and was less than satisfied. Revert to my previous review to read that nonsense.\n\nBut tis true. Their regular lunch menu is superb. I've been here twice in the past two days for business lunches. Tried a chicken salad off their special menu and their Pepper Crusted Steak Salad off their permanent menu-now I'm hooked! I'm a sucker for a hearty salad. Someone at the table said this is their go-to on property lunch and I whole-heartedly agree! The sirloin had a perfect sear. Nice and pink inside. A teensy bit chewy but it tasted fantastic. This isn't a salad for the feint of heart. It's packed full of roasted peppers, avocado, chewy corn bits and sprinkled with blue cheese. Perfection. \n\nNot to mention their chips are fresh fried in-house and served with a trio of delicious salsas. If in case anyone had an onion allergy, their tomatillo salsa is onion free! Found that out from one of my dining mates. Best of all, it's all complimentary. Which gives you a reason to splurge on their guac ;D \n\nTouch\u00e9 Border Grill. Way to prove a girl wrong."

            "review": "For brunch on our last day in Vegas, we opted for the AYCE brunch at the Border Grill at the Mandalay. Although it is an AYCE brunch, the format is not that of a brunch buffet.  You can order as many tapas sized plates from the menu as you want.  The restaurant recommends ordering 3 per person.  We ended up ordering approximately 5 per person, but probably only ate 3-4 as some were misses that we didn't finish.  \n\nWhen you arrive, plates of cut fruit and guava and cheese empanadas are quickly set on the table.  Simple appetizers as they are, they were some of the best things all day.  The fruits included a spear of pineapple, a few of watermelon, honeydew, and a few slices of strawberry with a passionfruit puree.  The fruit and empananadas were a great start to the meal.  The fruit was sweet and the puree was very complimentary.  I loved the light, flaky crust of the pastry and the guava jam was delicious.  \n\nThe absolute best dish of the day were the steak and eggs over a crispy potato cake.  Hot steak, crispy potatoes, egg yolk, guacamole = perfection.  Also good was the sweet corn tamale, which was subtley sweet with kernels of yellow corn inside and offset by the bright pico de gallo and the cool sour cream.  The Shrimp and Grits was also popular with its spicy sauce. \n\nSome of the other dishes didn't fare as well.  The chicken enchiladas and the chilaquiles were clearly pre-assembled and had been reheated but not to optimum temperature.  They were barely warm as compared to the hot seared steak and hot steamed tamale, above.  The flavor of the enchiladas were okay but it just wasn't hot enough and with the chilaquiles, the chips were totally soggy. \n\nSome dishes were just imbalanced.  The short rib hash with yams were overly sweet from the yams.  The PBJ biscuit with bacon, PB & J tasted exactly what you might think it would, and the eggs benedict had a bit of clashing flavors with the yucatan pork, marinated red onions and hollandaise.  Also, everything was served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  Lovely condiments, generally, but it was tiring to see them so overused.  \n\nWe had little room for dessert so we asked for more fresh fruit and shared one order of the Churro Tots.  These are more like mini doughnuts rolled in cinnamon and sugar but I must admit they were nicely fried and light.  \n\nAll in all, it's a good brunch concept but the food isn't perfect.   Reflecting on everything we tried, it was hard to overlook the combination of the lukewarm pre-assembled food and the not quite natural assemblage of American and Latin flavors.  If you were to come, stick with the Steak & Eggs, Shrimp & Grits and some of the more standard Mexican fare."

Not the best thing I've ever eaten, but I definitely would get them again.\n3) Caesar salad with skirt steak:  excellent, excellent steak.  Cooked to perfection.  Salad could have used a bit more dressing but it was good, that nice Mexican spicier Caesar dressing.\n4) Beef taquitos.... yeah, that was the shit squared.  The best taquitos we have ever eaten.  Period.  Phenomenal stuff.  Black beans served with were also good.  Green rice not so much.  But I don't like green rice anyway, so no harm done.\n5) Friend's pork... nice cinnamon rub, excellent flavor.\n\nWe dug it highly.  Only real downside was the 50-cent water per person slammed on the table as soon as we sat down, and seeing the bit on the menu at the bottom in small print about being able to refuse it about 5 minutes later after we already drank.  Meh.  \n\nBut for food?  We are very glad we finally got to try it.  Thanks, Top Chef Masters, for the heads up."

We saw the Border Grill straight ahead so we went there instead.  \n\nWe got seated right away and our waitress was very bubbly and attentive.  They bring you chips and three different salsas while you wait for your meal.  They are all different and good.  We ate all the salsa so our waitress brought us another tray. I ordered the thing that I always order: The Border Classics (plantain empanadas, corn tamales and paunches)...I get this because it's a bit of everything.  \n\nPlantain Empanadas: outside of the empanada is made of plantain, not flour dough.  They are filled with black beans and topped with cojita cheese.  So savory and delicious, yet so healthy!! \nCorn Tamales: creamy sweet corn crapped in banana (?) leaves.  Sweet/dessert-like.  Reminds me of that sweet corn dessert that they have at El Torito. My favorite Mexican dessert!! \nPanuchos: chicken on a thick homemade, fried tortilla.  Good, but not my fav. \n\nMy bf got the carne asada quesadilla: grilled steak, carmelized onions, arbol salsa, cojita, manchego and panela cheese.  This is a quesadilla on steroids...very scrumptious.  If you're in the mood for a quessadilla, this will HIT THE SPOT. \n\nThe other things I've tried at the Santa Monica location are the ceviche and the jalape\u00f1o cucumber margarita.  I love both of them and highly recommend them to first timers!"

It took forever to get basics like silverware or water, and the chips/salsa were probably a good 20 minutes after we sat down.  We waited so long just to get our cocktails that we started playing the game, \"So...do we leave? Do you want to leave? Where would we eat dinner? I'm so okay leaving, I have no problem getting up and just going. Lets give it 3 more minutes? What time is it now...\" But then our cocktails were served and we felt we had to stay.\n\nMr R ordered a really good pork plate. I had the short rib enchiladas. They came alone, without any sides except for a few greens on top. It was all really good. I was very impressed with the kids menus - tons of options for $4-6 a plate. We ordered a $5 plate of the green corn tamale which came with rice and beans. The tamale reminded me more of a corn casserole - not my favorite (nor the favorite of my 18 month old, but he had spent an earlier part of the dinner sucking green salsa off his chips and eating crayons, so not sure his opinion should count).\n\nThe patio was beautiful and heated in December, it was a decent place - just not someplace I'd go again."

I am glad they finally removed what was by far the  most ridiculous and ugly wall graffiti  infesting the walls of the entire place (and it was done by some famous artist...I guess that explains it). Well, at least now it's warmer and you don't have to wander if the stuff on the wall is a finger or a penis.\nService is warm and comfortable without being pretentious.\nThe menu is quite accommodative and the dishes are very tasty. Not being as pricy as most strip restaurants is an added bonus. They charge $0.50 per person for water....not the greatest thing, but in the Vegas frame of mine, I will not let it bother me.\nAsk questions to make sure you know what it is on your plate. Find what sounds good, and chances are very good that you will find it delicious.\nAlways looking forward to coming back here."

I went here with my parents for my 21st birthday, and I have never experienced such wonderful food. First was the appetizers - We had the sampler (which for me, since I'm gluten- intolerant, was altered). It contained two plantain empanadas and the most exquisite thing I've ever eaten in my life - a green corn tamale. It was sweet and just wonderfully delicious. Then came dinner - a HUGE and perfectly cooked portion of premium grade steak with a small fresh field salad, mole and aoli. Divine. Then dessert - the most rich and wonderful gluten free chocolate cake ever. With vanilla bean ice cream. This place is amazing. I would recommend this place for those of you with gluten intolerance because its amazing. But skip the shrimp."

The four if us were seated immediately. We sat indoors, there was a wait for the patio. \nCarmie, our delightful server, came right over to the table and introduced herself. She took our drink orders, mimosas for the ladies ($8 extra for endless) and coffee for the gentlemen. We all decided to have the brunch. It is very cool how it is small plates, like a buffet, but you never have to get up from the table. At this point Carmie took over our experience. She anticipated all of our needs, she took the liberty of starting us off with a few things, and when she saw that we were all sharing and passing plates and having fun, she just kept them coming. She brought mimosa refils right on time. Just as my colleague was about to place his empty coffee cup on the table, she was filling it up. IT WAS AMAZING!!!! Before we knew it we had tried one of everything. Carmie asked if we wanted seconds on anything. We ordered two more things and tapped out.  Outstanding service!! The food was so good that I didn't even think to take pictures of it.... everything was incredible.\nMust trys: brisket omelet, breakfast fries, French toast, biscuits and gravy & of course ALL THE MIMOSAS!!!

I've had the best and the worst Mexican around from trips to Mexico and living in Phoenix for 6 years and they all taste fine (it is hard to mess up).  First of all let me say, this is not traditional Mexican.  This is upscale Tex-Mex with a side of Spain.  They have the usual things you'd expect like Chips & Salsa, Guacamole, Enchiladas, Taquitos and fried ice cream.  They also have things like Ahi Tuna Ceviche, Peruvian Ceviche and Brisket burritos.\n\n\nI tried a bit off everyone's plate and I must say....everything was delicious.  Worth every penny.

After the previous night's disappointment at Fleur we decided to try something a smidge more casual and Border Grill ended up being our first choice. Why is it great where Fleur failed? \n\n1) The food is actually cooked well and didn't confuse salt and fat with flavor. Seasoning on everything was perfect from the chips through to the desserts. The food all had nuance, even the steak which is usually one of the more boring things on the menu was seasoned spectacularly well. The accompanying quesadilla would have been a great appetizer in its own right. I don't think it's possible to go wrong on this menu.\n\n2) The service gives a shit. Our server was awesome, he steered us in the right direction on recommendations, telling us what he wouldn't order, and why, and making sure that everything was there when we needed it. At one point we needed a spare steak knife and didn't need to flag someone down, it just appeared as if by magic. Everyone we interacted with was awesome, and they got the pacing perfect. We never waited for anything but we also never felt rushed.\n\n3) Casual is, well, casual. Border Grill manages to do a bit upscale without being stuffy. This is just an easy restaurant to be in. The energy is great throughout and the patio is a great place to be, overlooking the pool at the Mandalay Bay and it was even comfortable in the beginning of summer. Nothing is forced.\n\n4) The drinks are great. There's a bunch of different spins on Margaritas on the menu and they're all worth drinking and all perfect for summer. Order anything from the cocktail menu with confidence. It's all great.\n\nSome restaurants have great food but the service is off, or they have great service but the food leaves something to be desired. Or there's great food and service, but the bar is weak. Border Grill is one of the few restaurants that hits on all cylinders."

            "review": "The first night of our conference, I met my coworker here for some margaritas. Boy was it slammed! The space is comprised of a small bar area and smaller restaurant.  They also have no bathrooms, so beware that if you drink too much water, you have to go downstairs to pee.  \n\nWe found seats in the bar at a high top and there were a few other high top tables open. So we waited. And waited. And waited. The waitress on duty seemed to be approaching the tables of men who sat down 10 minutes after we did before she ever greeted us. So we approached the male bartender who happily gave us menus. After about 20 more minutes of the waitress ignoring us, we approached her as she walked by us again and asked if we could order drinks. Sure. So I ordered a blood orange margarita without the mole on the rim and my coworker ordered some kind of margarita with pineapple in it.  The margaritas were fabulous. They both seemed to have been made skinny with agave in them and lime juice.  That was great. Sadly, our service was terrible.  As the crowd thinned out to only 4 tables, our waitress still did not approach us until we literally walked up to her. I can only guess she may have thought 2 young looking women would've tipped her less generously than the older gentlemen at the conference. That sort of becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because once you ignore us for so long, your tip decreases. My bet is that this place could use some systems and processes to handle busy hours.  But I wasn't all that impressed."

Cabbage, yes, but lettuce?  I've had much better fish tacos at the farmer's market near my house.  As for the drinks, one pina colada, didn't try it but heard it was good, and my horrible mojito.

Sat in the bar with other fans, ate/drank for 1-2 hours, it was great fun. Great staff, bartenders, waitresses.\n\nWe, spouse and I, are ANCIENT foodies, and have known the \"2 Hot Tamales\", Mary Sue and Susan, since they started off in a storefront and only using hot plates, along Melrose Blvd back in the early 80s in LA. I experienced all of their iterations in the culinary world, most especially City Restaurant. I miss City. And Ciudad. I love Street, and try to return there when I can, when visiting LA.\n\nBut you know what is the best thing about THIS Border Grill, the Las Vegas location? The man they have in charge at the stoves, Executive Chef Mike Minor. Every time we dine there, his dishes are simply wonderful.\n\nWell, last year they introduced Brunch at BGLV. We thought it really good, but needing a few changes. Even Mike, who is in charge of the Brunch dishes, admitted that we visited too early, and should return later in the year. Well, the Brunch is only from March until October. We missed his changes. (If we had tons of money, we would have returned, and quite often.)\n\nWell, THIS time around, today, it was a very different menu, and EVERY DISH was astounding. I split dishes with my spouse, and we tried as many as possible, but couldn't get thru half the menu, still going home feeling like pythons after consuming an antelope. But MAN, what we ate!\n\nI don't even need to mention the dishes. EVERY DISH was just sublime. (But the shrimp and grits, those I could eat all day long.) And the $5 bottomless mimosas were great, too, with a huge selection of variations, with things like blood orange juice, pomegranate, etc.\n\nSo try the Brunch. You will NOT be disappointed. It's normally $29.99 pp, but as BG LV VIP card holders we got a one-time half-off offer thru the email, ending Mar 25. Look into that, if you are a local Nevadan. But believe me, even without a discount, we WILL return this year, especially if we have friends visiting LV to introduce to this Brunch."

I've frequented their LA location, and noticed no difference in the style or quality of the food.  This shows great management.  Beef brisket taquitos were very good (but sauce was too mild for my spicy-loving tastes); Yucatan pork was the winner.  I also love that Border Grill doesn't overcook rice.\n\nre: ambience - typical Border Grill decor, but not their best location.  Patio overlooks the \"Lazy River\" at Mandalay Bay - a slow-moving waterway filled with children and extremely fat adults floating along in inner tubes.  I cam to think of it as the \"River of Pee,\" but I digress...)  It was pretty warm that day.  The gigantic fan outside is misleading; it doesn't seem to do anything to circulate air or cool the patio down.  Seems poorly designed.  It was also a little loud thanks to the packed pool.  But not awful.  Inside probably would've been the better choice, and we chose incorrectly.\n\nre: service - Border Grill Las Vegas delivered big on service with a fabulous plus host/waiter (we thought the charming man who seated us was the host, but we later saw him waiting on another section.)  Our waiter was also attentive without being over-bearing.  Never had to wait for anything or ask twice.\n\nre: price - cocktails looked to be about the same as LA prices.  Food had roughly a 20-25% Las Vegas premium over LA prices, but I suppose that's to be expected because 1) it's the Strip, and 2) they're probably trucking a lot of fresh ingredients into agriculturally-challenged Vegas.)"

There was a 30-minute wait, so we grabbed a seat at the bar for some drinks & guacamole. I started with the Blanco margarita and the boy had a Cadillac. I really liked the Blanco, it was crisp and refreshing, everything a margarita should be. The guacamole here was great, it had a heavy lime flavor & wasn't overly spicy, read: very Karen C. friendly.\n\nFor dinner, I went with the Fish Tacos Ensenada, and they were delicious! I skipped the beans, and they instead served them with 3 different kinds of rice... all were so flavorful. The boy had the Saut\u00e9ed Shrimp, which I admit to stealing a decent amount of because it was SO good! The sauce was so flavorful and seasoned perfectly. The only complaint is that the red rice on both of our plates was a little too salty, but other than that, it was great. It definitely isn't crazy authentic Mexican, but that's not what I was looking for, so I'm down with that. \n\nI like the ambiance here, and would have liked to have been sat outside, but there was a huge birthday party so that was a no-go.

In fact, he gave the impression that he genuinely cared about our dining experience. He took care to lead us through the extensive margarita list and gave us some good advice and was correct in his recommendations--the margaritas are delicious!

I'm a huge fan of Ciudad here in L.A. and was really excited about having dinner at the Border Grill. I was so excited that even though my fellow Yelpers warned me about the bad service and sub-par food, I still threw caution to the wind and had dinner there. Apparently, I thought I was special and would get a 5 star experience. I was wrong and I suffered the consequences. \n\nThe food was ok although nothing special. The $17 ceviche plate was redonkulous - seriously about 5 bites worth of ceviche and not even enough to share. Total rip-off.  My plantain empenadas were good but not incredible. The strawberry sangria was so  weak it made a wine cooler seem like a strong shot of alcohol and it was $12. I don't get really uptight about paying a premium for good food but not for this. This is what I could have got at a decent taco stand. \n\nThe service was abysmal. Our waiter was inattentive (to say the least) and even seemed to have some awareness as to how bad the service was and yet, didn't make attempts to improve it. On three occasions he walked by our table and noted, \"Oh, your food isn't out yet? It will come soon\". Well, it didn't come soon and he didn't make any attempts to go into the kitchen to make sure it was on it's way. At the end of the meal we waited about 30 minutes just to get the check and finally flagged down another waitress and asked if she would get it for us. She stated that our waiter would be by soon  and then just headed about her business. Basically, no one is going to make a move to make sure that the customer gets what they need and you just better sit and wait it out. That is expected at the DMV but at a place where I'm dropping $150 for a meal? No, that won't cut it. I did note that our waiter appeared to be covering far too many tables and that this probably played a role in his ability to provide service, which is probably a management level issue that needs to be looked at. All in all, a major bummer of a dining experience."

There was a ton of flavor, which pretty much masked the taste of the mushrooms. My girlfriend ordered shrimp relleno tacos, which she thought were awful. There were way too many sauces and competing ingredients, which did not blend well together. The tacos were so unpleasant she wasn't even able to finish half of her entree, and she is not a picky eater. At this price point, the food shouldn't be so terrible she is unable to eat it."

We had the house margaritas which were delicious!! Their salsa was good, hot sauce was hot (obviously) and wasn't that good. My friend and I shared the quesadilla. I dont eat meat and she does so we got it half chicken half not and let me tell you, delicious! I know its not hard to make a good quesadilla, but really, like the best quesadilla ever. The tortilla was soo good that they used i dont know if its hand made, but yumm, along with the cheese, like the best cheese ever. My friend said the best chicken she has ever had, we were big fans! We were with a group and no one had any complaints. Would go back."

For a few extra bucks, brunch came with bottomless mimosas.  Now, I ate here earlier this summer, so I don't remember EXACTLY what we had, but all I can remember was how awesome everything tasted and next time I'm at Mandalay Bay on a weekend, we WILL return for brunch.\n\nFood: 5 stars man, it really was delicious.  Keep in mind, this review is for brunch, so I don't know what the rest of their menu is like.  Brunch was tapas style, so servings were small, which allowed us to try so many different dishes.  And each dish had like a lil twist.  There were shrimp and grits, steak and eggs, eggs benedict.  I know, sounds like standard brunch fair right? But it was so good y'all, trust me.\n\nThere were like 10 flavors of bottomless mimosa, and I think I got to like 6 before I was like ok it's too early for me to get drunk off champagne.  But all were good except the cucumber one, that one was weird.  Rest were quite tasty.\n\nService: two thumbs up.  Dangit I can't remember our servers name, but she was knowledgeable of the menu, friendly, attentive, she gave good suggestions, and was all around great lady.  We left her a bomb ass tip.\n\nAtmosphere: We ate on the outdoor patio, overlooking the hotel pool.  The sun was shining in, the air was fresh.  Loved it.  \n\nMaybe it was Vegas, maybe it was the drinks, but either way I was quite wooed by the whole experience."

For $24.99 you get an all-you-can-eat brunch - but this isn't your usual Vegas buffet - everything is made to order and served tapas style.  \n\nWe started with the fresh fruit plate and guava empanada.  The guava empanada was heavenly...the filling was almost like a guava cream cheese.  Next, we tried the chilaquiles and the green corn tamale.  The green corn tamale is sweet and delicious with just a little sour cream.  We followed this with the Yucatan eggs benedict - not as delicious as all of my fellow Yelpers let on - and the steak and eggs.  My husband was a huge fan of the steak and eggs...I think he only shared one bite.  The breakfast enchilada and the chorizo and egg taco were last.  I am not a huge chorizo fan so I did not enjoy the taco, but the breakfast enchilada was amazing.  The chicken was so flavorful and tender and I loved the cotija cheese.  For dessert, we ordered the coconut french toast, which was a perfect ending to a fabulous meal...just the right amount of sweet.  \n\nOur server was tremendous - very sweet and always there with a refill for my all-you-can-drink mimosas (only $5!).  The passionfruit one is incredible - I may have overindulged!\n\nCheck out restaurant.com to see if they have a gift certificate available.  We got a $25 gift certificate for $10 before we went."

It joins a couple other spots I've had the misfortune of visiting: Zentan by Susur Lee in Washington DC and RIck Moonen's RM Seafood Room here in Vegas. I've been to Border Grill three times now and either the quality has slipped or my expectations have risen because with each visit I leave less satisfied.\n\nWe decided to come here for a family night out -- yup, we had the kid in tow and were looking for a family-friendly spot that would make him happy and have good enough food to make us happy. They get points for having a kids menu (and they also have a gluten-free menu for anyone looking for that). Unfortunately, the food didn't thrill any of us.\n\nThe plantain empanadas ($9) are filled with a mixture of roasted plantains, black beans, poblano peppers and cotija cheese. The sweetness of the plantains dominated the flavor of the dish. I love plantains, so that isn't necessarily a bad thing, just an observation. The empanada dough was more mushy then flaky, which was a disappointment. There are four per order, so plan to share.\n\nThe Baja ceviche ($15) is a huge order of lime marinated halibut and shrimp sitting on a corn tortilla with slice avocado sitting on top. There was too much lime and the fish didn't taste all that fresh. This also seemed like a dish that was mass produced and was probably sitting around in those lime juices for quite some time.\n\nThe first entree to make it's way to the table was something off of their 'Specials' menu. It was shrimp stuffed with crab and wrapped in bacon with some sort of cilantro pesto sauce or something (I can't remember exactly) ($26). It sounded awesome, but it turned out to be a hot mess. Too much bacon, no detectable crab in or near the shrimp, and a million ingredients that over-complicated the dish.\n\nThe Negro Modelo braised short ribs ($29) were much better. It came with two large chunks of boneless beef atop corn polenta and a cherry tomato salsa fresca with a molasses habanero BBQ sauce. The beef could have been more tender, but the flavors were pretty good with a slight bitterness from the Negro Modelo and sweetness from the sauce. It wasn't overly spicy. \n\nThe kids cheese quesadilla ($4) was filled with cotija cheese (I think?). Fine for adults, but for a 3 yr old with developing taste buds... no. He wasn't a fan. Too bad they didn't just have a cheddar/monterey jack cheese blend.\n\nOur little guy did get a scoop of chocolate ice cream ($3) accompanied with fresh berries. He loved the ice cream, but is still learning to like berries.\n\nThe wife and I split the flourless chocolate cake with prickly pear lychee sauce and raspberries ($10). It was heavier/denser than we expected but still rich and chocolatey. The crust and bottom of the cake were slightly overcooked and hard.\n\nAlong with mediocre food, we had spotty service. Our server was friendly but very busy and disappeared often. This isn't fine dining but at the prices they charge they could step things up a bit. Little things like clearing empty dishes and replacing silverware would make a big difference. The whole atmosphere was more laid back then I remember (the last time we were here was probably 2+ years ago). It almost felt like a small step up from a Chevy's Fresh Mex or one of those type of places. They also charge fifty cents for water per person. Although my son didn't get water they charged him anyway.  \n\nAnother thing that was annoying was how they decided to sit people right next to us when most of the dining room was completely empty. Why not space people out more?\n\nIt was a pricey meal for what we got, but at least we were armed with a restaurant.com gift certificate. We also tried to use the Border Grill VIP card, which normally gets us a 15% discount but management said they couldn't take both the gift certificate and VIP card."

When I heard they had a restaurant at the Mandalay Bay, I was excited to finally taste their food.  My reservation was made 1 month ahead.\n\nWhen I arrived there I was not impressed by the restaurant, however I was there for the food, so my husband and I ordered the queso fundillo, I had the enchiladas poblanas and my husband had the carnitas, plus we each had a beer.   we thought it was a bit pricey, however a few months ago we went to Fronteras Grill in Chicago, the restaurant that belongs to Rick Bayless and there we spent over $140 for the 2 of us and it was one of the best meals I have ever had.  So when I saw the similar prices, I was excited.  When we got the queso fundido, I must say it was just ok.  Then we received our entrees.  What a dissapointment.  My enchiladas were bland, small for the $20 price tag, no side dishes, just 3 very skinny enchiladas.  My husband's $23 carnitas were ordinary, again no side dishes, just the meat with 1 flour tortilla.  My husband said to me, now we don't have to visit Ciudad, their LA restaurant, this food sucks.  This restaurant is not in the same level as Fronteras Grill in Chicago, or even Bobby Flay.  I can honestly say, very dissapointing 2 hot tamales, you dropped the ball and you lost a 15 year fan.  I even have their cookbooks, what a dissapointment.  For those of you looking for somewhere good to eat in Vegas, there are so many great restaurant, including Fleur de Lys, also located at the Mandalay Bay, don't waste a great meal opportunity here."

Our server was a bit non attentive at first but once I put my phone on the table with the Yelp app open the service became very prompt. \n\nGreat experience."

            "review": "I love unique flavor combinations that are not overpowering.  Most of the dishes have a unique ingredient that gives it a new twist, without taking over the traditional base.  My favorite dish by far here is the Baja Ceviche.  It inspires me to make my own ceviche at home every time i have it.   A delicate blend of fish, shrimp, red onions, tomato, avocado and a fresh cilantro sauce drizzled over.   \n\nMy other favorites from prior visits are the empanadas and the sweet green mini tamales.  Last night I had the chicken poblano enchiladas.  Let me say I have been craving green enchiladas for about 6 months.  I loved the chicken filling and loved the addition of thinly sliced portobello mushrooms, corn, nopal and poblano on top,  BUT there was WAY too much Green sauce, drowning some of the awesome flavors.  Would have been much better with a drizzling of the green sauce and the addition of some melted white cheese.  After all it can't be great enchiladas without lots of cheese.   \n\nMy husband had the carnitas,  which were delicious.  Again unique ingredients added a twist,  bacon, citrus and a bed of polenta underneath.  His flour tortilla was the yummy authentic type.  \n\nMy other favorite last night was the CABO RITA, mmmmmm,  pear puree in a  margarita made with fresh lime juice and agave,  versus sweet and sour and triple sec.   One of the best margaritas I've ever had.  \n\nSadly the service SUCKED.  Our waitress never once came to check on us.  We had to wave her,  or the busboy down every time we needed something.  It even took 20 minutes just to get and process the check and we had to ask 3 times to move it along.   Also, sadly, when we made the reservation, they promised a pool view booth which was not available when we got there.  there was a front pool view table, which we said we would take, but it was \"reserved\"  to make a big table for a future reservation.   When we left, it was occupied by another couple, not  a big table.   Being lied to doesn't make the guest feel appreciated. \n\nHad it not been for the service and the over abundance of green sauce, and the slight overprices,  I would rate 5 stars. The awesomeness of the Ceviche and the Margarita, raise it from 3 stars to 4.  \n\nIf you like unique tastes,  I would still recommend.   \n\nThe night was capped beautifully by a fun shopping excursion at my stores, Misura, Paradiso and Ruby Blue near the valet entrance!"

We only had one small basket of chips, our waiter did not even offer us more chips. \n\nBefore we ordered, we stated we would need two separate checks because 5 out of the 7 people I was with needed to expense their meal together but when we received out checks 3 people were together and everyone else had separate checks.

Besides that, the food receives 1.5 stars.\n\nBUT when you're poolside at Mandalay Bay and you actually want to sit down and eat (not eat on your deck chair...if you're lucky but on the ground if you didn't get a chair), the Border Grill is the closest option.  I was starving, famished...and I couldn't find anything on the menu that looked appealing.  I thought a burrito would be the next best thing to a burger...but no burritos!  Tacos - too small!  Carnitas platter - for some reason - bleh!  So, I got the chilaquiles.  That was probably a bad call - it was essentially a bunch of chips baked into a \"casserole\" which waslayered with cheese and a little bit of meat.  Really, it just ended up being a big mess of soggy chips and a teeeeny bit of chicken.  I was so sad...  I left feeling full but not the good kind of full - the kind of full that feels gross because you know you just ate a bunch of icky food.  I'd a salad before which was just chicken on top of iceberg lettuce, so I thought something more legitimately \"Mexican\" might be better...but not so much!"

I feel like I should be embarrassed about this, but I have no shame.  If you force me to choose, I would say brunch is the star, but dinner was pretty fantastic too.  The chips and salsa in this town can be very hit or miss.  Border Grill's delivers.  I had chile relleno for dinner and loved it.\n\nWhen I returned for brunch, I was corralled by a friend who swears their brunch is the best in town.  I am a die hard DW Bistro fan so I was prepared to set her straight.  Then I tried the chilaquiles.  And the skirt steak and eggs.  And the breakfast fries.\n\nFor $34.99, you get unlimited small plates.  The quality of the food is unexpectedly good for this price point.  Everything is fresh and the small plates allow you to try several things instead of limiting you to one large dish.  The only negative is that a few of the hot dishes did not come out piping hot, but this is likely due to the rush of people in the place.  You really cannot compare DW and Border Grill because the food, ambience and intentions are totally different.  This is a great spot for endless food options, bottomless mimosas and Mexican inspired brunch.  Can't wait to go back."

It is in the Mandalay Bay resort and I find all of the resort restaurants to be overpriced so we paid ~$100 for lunch, 2 entrees and 4 drinks. However I enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa trio as well as my entr\u00e9e. The salsa verde  or tomatillo (?) salsa was my favorite while husband preferred the traditional salsa. I'm sure we could find much cheaper food outside of the resort but I don't mind paying for convenience so I wouldn't hesitate to return here if I didn't feel like leaving the resort."

We ordered fajitas, margaritas, chicken nachos, quest fundido w/chorizo (which came highly recommended by the waiter). All the food was drowned in oil including the chips. We started with the queso fundido and it was just horrible. There was so much oil we literally tasted it once and couldn't continue. The fajitas was also drowned in oil. My husband couldn't even eat the bell peppers because of the amount of oil on them. He only ate 1/2 of his meal, and he is not the type of man that leaves food on his plate. My chicken nachos were so oily that I only ate a 1/3 of it. I paid for that later on that night. I couldn't even enjoy being in Vegas because I spent the rest of the night in the bathroom. I would not recommend if you want REAL Mexican food, especially if you want to enjoy your time in Vegas without running into a restroom. I'm so upset that we wasted $80 on food we didn't eat or enjoy."

It is a bit pricey there were about 8 of us all got the brunch option with bottomless mimosas and it came out to about $45 each, but all totally worth it.\n\nBrunch gives you the a list of BOTTOMLESS \"small plates\" options ranging from a tres leches french toast, chilaquiles, and huevos rancheros i believe there are 21 options to choose from and I suggest going on a empty stomach if you go for brunch because its each one of those plates are amazing! If you go in a big group you can order in a sort of family style and they bring out a good amount of that one dish so it comes out faster and everyone can try a little bit of it all. \nThe tres leches french toast is hands down one of my favorites, I also recommend the steak and eggs, huevos rancheros, and definitely the chilaquiles fersure. \nAlso get the bottomless mimosas, they have a ton of different flavors, i tried all of them and let me tell you they were all good.\n\nService was just perfect both times ive gone, I forgot both their names cuz i usually leave too drunk because of the mimosas lol but they were both super friendly and fast.\nAt one single moment I 3 people helping take out my dirty empty plates, fill my empty glass of water, take my order for my next mimosa and ask if everything was good. We were all impressed. \n\nAll in all, great food, great atmosphere, amazing service, and I will definitely be coming back on my next trip."

No more lobster egg pancakes or jalape\u00f1o PBJ.  Now, we have a few far reaching choices that actually reach too far -  but just unconvinced about cauliflower tacquitos and oyster tacos.  The creative nods lean more to the Latin inspired non-breakfast dishes.   If Chef would dial back the more lunch-y creative options back to brunch, it would improve to previous levels perhaps.   Maybe a first timer would enjoy it more, but we were let down.   Plates come out quickly and menu is more accessible, but Border Grill didn't need either of those things from our diners' perspective.  Other brunch options will now be able to compete.   We could never duplicate a jalapeno PBJ anywhere.  Now, no one needs to.  If it's not broke, don't fix it."

The weekend brunch is a fantastic deals at $30 for all you can eat tapas (add on all you can drink mimosas for $5). There are items on the menu to appeal to every taste from 'traditional' breakfast to people who want something more like lunch. If you're a pancakes person, definitely try the mexican chocolate chip pancakes or the bread pudding french toast. The chorizo sausage biscuit and gravy is great, so are the chilaquiles and the shrimp and grits. I love their short ribs, so I was super excited to have the short rib hash. My roommate loved the frittata (also new to the menu) and he normally hates eggs. I love the green corn tamales, but those are on the regular dinner menu too. Be sure to ask them to bring out the guava empanadas.\n\nMy only criticism is that I want to order everything and I end up completely stuffed. The service is always excellent - the staff and management both makes a point of getting to know their regulars. I always mock the people in the restaurant on the weekends with the lunch menu. Spend the same amount and get a huge variety of amazing food. It's Mexican twists on American dishes and some interesting interpretations of classic Mexican food as well."

I would imagine the pancake by itself is good. I would definitely ask for the syrup on the side next time\nYucatan Egg Benedict - The bread absorbed the egg flavor too much, imo.\n\nUnfortunately, for a party this big, they charged as all for the unlimited mimosas, although a good number of us did not have mimosas. We made sure they took away our glasses for people who didn't drink, but one of the waiters even said \"I don't believe that you're not drinking\". I thought she was joking when she said that, but I guess it was true because when the bill came, they charged us all for mimosas. Kind of upsetting, because at the very end, people had already left cash for the bill and left, and the birthday boy ended up eating the rest of the bill. The service for the mimosas was great though, they basically left bottles of champagne on the table for us and brought new ones when we ran out.\n\nOverall, the food here was really good and a lot of these dishes had a generous portion of scrambled eggs.  For the sweets dishes, they were all a little too sweet though. Service was good, they kept coming out with food and they were even nice enough to give us just steak when we asked."

Seriously Yelp?   \nWas here 2 weeks ago and was really looking forward to trying this place but left without trying it due to inconsiderate service.  Planned on ordering a few entr\u00e9es and a couple of their desserts, including the tres leches cake since I have heard much about their food.  Came here at 8 PM this evening and asked to be seated with two kids.  Hostess told me we could be seated right away and directed me to go to the downstairs dining room.  I proceeded to walk down the stairs  went to the hostess booth and there was nobody to be found.  Waited for a few minutes then went to an employee standing close to the area to ask where we should sit.   She shushed me immediately, mid-sentence.  I was quite taken aback as I'm not sure why she shushed me.  I was not being loud at all and the kids were silent.  She then said to me \"we're having a wedding\" and directed me to go down the hall to where the tables were.  \n\nI was pretty ticked off at being shushed but grudgingly walk down to where the tables were and stood there for five minutes with nobody acknowledging me.  Finally gave up, told the manager what happened and left immediately.  The manager said \"yeah we're having a wedding\", proceeded to ask me if i had a reservation (after i told him what just occurred) and offered to seat me but at that point the damage was done.  Walked over to the Subway shop in the Mandalay Bay food court and while the food was mediocre the service was extraordinarily better than my experience at Border Grill.   Thanks for making me feel like an unwanted customer.  \n\nWith the amount of restaurants in Vegas, the least you could do is make a new patron feel welcome.   And yes, while i understand there was a wedding going on in a separate outside area--not inside--even if it it was the royal wedding itself, you should never ever be rude to a guest.  If quietness was a concern, then it is the restaurant's responsibility to rope that area off or maybe don't seat people downstairs if your employees don't want anyone asking them questions.  Never again."

Once I realized Susan Feniger had a place attached to our hotel (we were at the Luxor) I changed our plans - I have the chance to eat at a Bobby Flay place any day of the week but Feniger only has restaurants on the west coast.  Anyway.  We had a reservation for 11:30am through OpenTable.  When we arrived we were greeted warmly by the hostesses who took us immediately to our choice of table - outside  on the patio flanked by two heaters.  Our server, Christopher, was right over to see us and was incredibly friendly.  He honestly made what was already a wonderful experience twice as great because he was attentive, helpful, and really enthusiastic.  \n\nWe placed our bottomless mimosa orders - one classic, one grapefruit, one white peach, and one pomegranate - and he brought them right away and kept bringing them.  Often they showed up when we were only halfway through the last one.  The four of us had 23 mimosas and we were only there about an hour and 15 minutes so they weren't skimping on the drinks.  They were all great, but I was partial to the peach.  Very fresh and tasty.\n\nI had hoped we would try everything on the menu of all you can eat tapas (for $29?  what a bargain!) but we ended up way too full.  We did try all of these:\n\nGuava Empanada - These came out before we ordered and I passed, as I'm not a fan of guava.  One of our friends has celiacs and cannot eat gluten so he also passed.  The other two said they were hot, flaky, and delicious.\n\nBiscuit and Chipotle Gravy - We got a platter of four servings done of these (easier if everyone wants to try something) in our first flight of items and they were very good, but not great.  \n\nChorizo and Egg Taco - This is on all of our lists of best things we ate there, as well as the entire trip.  The tortilla was clearly made in house, fresh, and very tasty.  Had there been room in our stomachs at the end, we would have gone for another platter.\n\nFrittata Tart - Another of our first items, this was so light and tasty I was kind of amazed.  We spent a good 15 minutes discussing egg white techniques to figure out how this was done.  \n\nPeruvian Shrimp and Grits - Glad we ordered a platter of these, because otherwise I would have had to scrape everyone elses plates.  The shrimp were delicious, the grits were easily the creamiest and best I've ever had (hard to admit, for a born southerner), and the sauce was something I could see eating on everything.  Literally.  Forever.  We did everything short of licking the plate clean.\n\nYucatan Egg Benedict - This was also very delicious, and the key was the crispy carnitas stuffed inside the bread under the egg.  A great combo of sweet and spicy, creamy and crunchy.  I'd easily eat a full size portion of this for breakfast.\n\nCrispy Potato Rajas Taco - Crispy fried potatoes inside a fried tortilla shell drizzled in creamy spicy sauce, grilled corn, and avocado.  Nothing crazy, but still tasty.  I imagine these would be a great hangover food.\n\nMachaca Chilaquiles - I was the only one at the table who knew what this was before it came, so it was great to see this be the first time my friends had chilaquiles.  These were delicious.  Just enough crunch left from the chips to give it a great texture.  \n\nChurro Tots - No shame, I ordered two plates of these just for myself.  So good.  Light and fluffy inside, crispy outside.  Hot and cinnamony, just little balls of perfection.  Who knows what the two dipping sauces tasted like, I was too busy shoving them down my gullet to care.  \n \n\nGreen Corn Tamale - Sweet and creamy, but not heavy.  These were a bit of a surprise as I had misread the menu and thought they were green CHILE tamales, but nonetheless we scraped the husks clean.\n\nBreakfast Enchilada - This was delicious.  Fresh and bright, a hint of citrus, and not overly goopy and cheesy like restaurant enchiladas you usually find.  \n\n\nShort Rib Hash and Egg - This was easily the ugliest dish we ate all day, and hands down the overwhelming favorite.  We shared one portion, then promptly ordered three more.  The meat was mouthwatering, the onions were perfect, and what could have been easily ruined by an ill prepared egg was accented by the perfectly scrambled ones atop each portion.  We talked about this dish in bed that night and on the flight home.  I can seriously throw down in the kitchen but I don't know about recreating this little plate of awesome.  It was so great, I'd be scared to tarnish our memories of it. \n\nMy one friend is rarely one to wholeheartedly recommend a place to eat - if you ask her about somewhere she's been she will only recommend somewhere that gets a full five star rating from her.  She said halfway through the meal that she would easily tell someone they had to eat brunch here.  We all agreed, wholeheartedly."

So what was a 2.5 hour dinner break turned into about 40 minutes to eat something fast. Since this location is close to the convention center at Mandalay Bay, and they have an area in the bar where you can eat quickly, we settled on this.\n\nThe food was good, but not great. Thankfully the server was attentive and when we told her we were in a bit of a hurry, she was certain to speed things up for us.

The drinks are imaginative, strong, sweet, spicy, tangy, whatever you want them to be.  \n\nThe food kind of sucker punches you with how exceptionally delicious it is.  I mean, I knew it'd be good, but not that good!  Shouts of \"WHAT IS THIS?!\" accompanied by vigorous head nodding could be heard echoing throughout the restaurant with each bite of my plantain empanadas.  \nThe Oaxacan strip steak is as delectable as it is huge.  And if that mesmerizing mole doesn't win you over, you don't stand a chance against the wild mushroom quesadilla. Not. A. Chance. \nIf you're as undyingly full as we were but stubborn enough to force down a dessert because everything else was so amazing you could never live with yourself without having tried it, they do two half portions of any of the desserts so you can \"share\" but still get the one you want!  Fair warning: the half portions are pretty much as big as a full portion anywhere else.  \n\nThe service is effortless.  Ryan was awesome; he knew the menu inside and out, made some great recommendations, and gave us good tips for ordering.  Someone give the guy a raise!  The ambience is perfectly cool and casual, so we felt totally welcome to take our time ordering, just sit back and lounge and keep the drinks on coming.

Suggesting without \"up selling\" is a talent and he had it. Runners were equally friendly and helpful, etc. The only exception was the hostess, a young girl who was so apathetic and unhelpful that I'm thinking she was doing her job at gunpoint.

I tasted lime rather than avocado, bad news.\n\nWe were warned portions were huge (thanks again, mr. waiter) so we skipped apps and went straight to the entrees. I had the carnitas, which had amazing flavor and were served over black beans and some kind of mashed quinoa that were like light, buttery mashed potatoes. The combo was delicious and unique. The portion was indeed enormous and I only was able to get through half of it. Friends had the poblano enchiladas and the taquitos. The enchiladas were yummy, the closest I've had north of the border to a certain preparation I've had in Mexico City. The taquitos were a little bland but only by comparison. \n\nSorry for the limited review, but we were stuffed after that! Prices were high-ish, but compared to other (lesser) Vegas chef joints it seemed reasonable. 3 of us left buzzed and very full for $150 including a generous tip. \n\nAs I've mentioned in other reviews, I'm no world food expert, but I do know Mexico Mexican, so a note about \"authentic\" Mexican: Mexico is a huge country with many regions and styles of cooking. Your local place in Minnesota or San Diego may be run by Pueblans, Campechans, or Baja Californians, who have their own ideas of what Mexican food is, and no doubt they've changed the food to suit Yanqui palettes, or just because it's more difficult to find certain ingredients. (If I hear one more Californian tell me only THEY know what \"real\" Mexican is, I'm gonna nuke the San Andreas fault. The Californian Mexican I've tried is a very specific import from Baja and border states that isn't representative of much of the country's cuisine.) I go to Mexico City about 1-2 times a year and Border Grill is somewhat like upscale restaurants in that city, though maybe more varied (DF restaurants tend to be more regional while Border Grill is all over the place). Thus I found Border Grill more \"authentic\" than many places I've tried that are run by 1st-generation Mexicans. Just saying."

The combination of flavors with the corn relish and black beans in that soft, handmade tortilla is just amazing...makes my mouth water just thinking about it :)  It was even better with some of the guacamole that we ordered as a starter.  My husband had the chicken mole, which he said was delicious as well.  Our server was wonderful, she recommended the black cherry mojito and the sparkling white peach lemonade, both of which were amazing!  They even brought us a complimentary dessert for my husband's birthday...the pineapple upside down cake served warm with pineapple ice cream...we devoured this dessert!  \n\nThe only misses that I've had here were during a lunch visit: the Yucatan Pork (mainly because I didn't like the orange flavor in the pork, too sweet for me), and the green corn tamales (also because it was sweeter than I expected).\n\nWe used a restaurant.com gift certificate, which made our dinner fairly reasonable for the strip.  I can't wait to come back for their weekend brunch!"

When he put the chips down, he asked if we would like a little guacamole too.  Little is the key point, as it was served on a plate the size of coffee cup saucer; yet, we found a charge for almost $10 on our bill!!!  They should ask if you would like to \"order\" some guacamole - the verbiage makes quite a bit of difference.  We had the same problem when ordering our meals.  The server, who was very nice, asked a child (young teenager) in our group if he would like rice and beans with his lunch, to which he said \"yes.\"  The meal was so large that he never touched them, but we found a charge for $5 on our bill for them.  What the heck?  Again, it should have been clarified that they were extra, as many Mexican restaurants don't charge extra.  One person in our group requested rice IN her meal, and instead was brought a side of rice (for which we were charged another $5).  We requested that the charge for the side of rice and beans that weren't touched be removed from the bill since we didn't know they were extra and they weren't touched.  The two young teens ordered the same thing, which turned out to be HUGE.  It would have been more professional of the server to mention how large the serving was and recommended that maybe they share one.  Either the staff at Border Grill is trained to be very sneaky, or they have no clue about semantics.  Even in Vegas, a $120 bill for lunch in this type of restaurant is obnoxiously high.  The food was good, but Border Grill lost these customers since they are sneaky and not as professional as they should be."

We walked up and were quickly seated and attended to promptly by our waiter Lars for the remainder of the night.  I decided to try the soft shell crab tostada appetizer and roll with the grilled mahi mahi tacos for my main entree.  The food was very nice and Lars also hooked it up with some habanero salsa for our chips in between each course of the meal.  We finished off the night with a \"Mexican\" banana split which consisted of mexican chocolate, pineapple, and raspberry ice cream topped off with a little bit of coconut.\n\nOverall, the food was delish and I left sastified.

My boyfriend and I met our tourist friends here for Memorial Day Weekend.  Even with it being a holiday there was no problem getting reservations and no wait.  My favorite mimosa was the pomegranate but I also loved the watermelon and the strawberry.   The food standouts for me were the steak and eggs and the sweet potato pancakes.  The majority of the items I tried were on the spicy side minus the pancakes.  My least favorite dish was the pork belly waffles.  I like pork belly but this was just a piece of flavorless fat.  \n\nIf you are a local make sure you sign up with your waiter for the 15% off locals' deal.

Border Grill in Mandalay Bay is one of them. Several of these restaurants are disappointing especially due to how it feels like quite a few Vegas kitchens are phoning it in because they are going to get a big customer base regardless of the quality. Border Grill is not that way though.\n\nBorder Grill features upscale Mexican cuisine, and while it may not elevate Mexican cuisine to justify the high price point, food is prepared with consistency here. My lunch started with a complimentary basket of hearty and crunchy tortilla chips. The chips came with a trio of sauces with two of them being surprisingly spicy for somewhat mainstream Mexican cuisine.\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e, I had their chile relleno, which I enjoyed quite a bit. The roasted poblano was filled with a really good, thick and stretchy Mexican cheese. The poblano was nicely cooked and flavorful. The outside crispy crust was good and not too greasy. The chile relleno came with sides of two kinds of rice and really good pureed black beans topped with Mexican cheese.\n\nFor dessert, I had their salted chocolate chip cookies with condensed milk ice cream. Of all the restaurants I have ever been to, this was probably the best bang-for-the-buck dessert I have ever had. At $6, the dessert included not 1, not 2 but 5 large salted chocolate chip cookies. And the cookies were delicious. They were fresh out of the oven and were nicely crisp on the outside and soft on the inside with warm and gooey chocolate chips (perfect chocolate flavor).\n\nThe cookies were accompanied by two generous scoops of condensed milk ice cream. The ice cream was very creamy and not icy, and it delivered on its name by really getting across the condensed milk flavor with every spoonful.\n\nService was friendly and quick.\n\nTheir lunch prices vary. Some items like the chile relleno are priced about right given that it is Vegas, but some of their more entr\u00e9e-dishes are in the high-$20s range and are probably not worth the high price tag.\n\nIn terms of the d\u00e9cor, Border Grill is okay. It is far away from the casino (near the convention center at Mandalay Bay) so you do not get the disturbance of cigarette smoke like you do at several other casino restaurants. Border Grill offers both indoor dining and an outdoor (and covered) patio.\n\nBorder Grill is a good spot for a satisfying and slightly upscale lunch. I have been to the Border Grill in Los Angeles, and it is about on par with this location. While Border Grill is known for serving upscale Mexican cuisine, several would say that Border Grill does not warrant their high prices. I would agree on that point to a certain extent. Rick Bayless' Chicago-based restaurants (especially Topolobampo) truly elevates Mexican cuisine by integrating hard-to-find Mexican ingredients and churning out moles of incredible complexity. Border Grill does not come close to that. But judging Border Grill on just what it really is, which is an upscale restaurant with Mexican flavors, it is a worthwhile lunch spot in Las Vegas--especially if you find yourself at Mandalay Bay, which is quite far from other notable Vegas casinos.\n\nI noticed that Mandalay Bay no longer offers complimentary self parking. I imagine it is because they struggle to secure parking for their hotel guests during busy times. It is kind of a nuisance given how almost every hotel on The Strip offers complimentary self parking."

The tamale and taquitos were average, but the empenada had a funky taste to it. My husband had the Baja ceviche as his main course, it was a good ceviche. My dish was the Jumbo Shrimp. The shrimp were fine, nothing special, but the rice and veg served with it were so salty, it was inedible. It was this that caused the before mentioned bad taste.  We finished by splitting the Pastel Rufina. Soggy pastry, way too thick cream and not much taste except the chocolate chips. \n\nI really wanted to like this place, I like the idea of sustainability. I like the Two Hot Tamales. I will say our service was great, but I go out for a great meal, great service is a bonus. \n\nSigh, I hoped for much more."

My favorite thing is the chips and salsa.  they bring out 3 different types of homemade salsa -- the green one was my personal favorite.  They are all mild, but you can ask them for a spicer one they have in the back.  I ordered beef taquitos.  they were good, but loved the black beans and rice that came with the meal.  I would definitely come back, but feel its a bit pricey for what you get."

Upscale but not at all pretentious or \"Vegas-y.\"  The menu offers plenty of options whether you prefer red meat, chicken, seafood, or veggies.  Or if you simply want chips, salsa, and a beverage or two you'll be all set.  There's a special which includes a sampling of appetizers, a choice of several main courses, and a dessert.  This was a great value, as the apps and dessert were plenty to share with a few people.  The Green Chicken Poblano Enchiladas were great, even though I ended up mostly eating the chicken inside because I was saving room for the tres leches cake.  Yum!!"

Featuring bottomless coffee and beginning with fresh fruit and empanadas before progressing through plates both sweet and savory utilizing organic proteins and produce plus house-made jams, jellies, sauces, and creams highlights of the menu for myself included the fluffy biscuits surrounding peanut butter, jelly, bacon, jalapenos and a fried egg as well as the quesadilla and excellent shrimp and grits but all-in-all it would also be foolish to overlook the quality of the pork belly atop the crispy waffle, clever churro tots, or creamy French toast either - the only problem with these being that I had a real estate appointment and the combination of limited time and so many other choices prevented the ordering of a second round."

So many places use sweet and sour mix and I think it is just awful.  I ordered a portabella dish and it was excellent.  I did ask for it without dairy and they messed it up twice, but corrected the issue with no problems.  I used a 15% off card they gave me and a restaurant.com gift certificate, so it was a great deal.  The Chef, Mary Sue was in the kitchen and came out to say hello to us as we are Top Chef fans.  We were also lucky enough to hear the Black Keys play live.  They were playing a private event at the Mandalay pool and since we were sitting on the patio outside we could hear it!  I like the patio because it is one of the only places on the strip where you can sit outside and not be on the street.  Great service, drinks and food.  I will go back soon."

I haven't put much stock in Yelp to date and any person, site or entity that gives Popeye's Chicken 4 stars lack credibility in my mind.  So I'm giving my honest opinion here from a person who eats at all types of dining establishments often. \n\nThis may be the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. I chose the Skirt Steak and a Cucumber Jalape\u00f1o Margarita. I enjoy spicy food as much or more than most people as long as it's not a substitute for flavor. I half expected the Margarita to be a throat searing eyes watering nose running test of heat tolerance. It was quite the opposite. There was a little heat but the Cucumber was very cool and refreshing. Score a big one and I've not eaten anything but the chips and salsa and that was very good as well. Three salsas were presented and all were mild with excellent flavor. I liked the Tomatillo best. \n\nThe main course for me was the Skirt Steak. I asked for medium and it was cooked perfectly. No small feat for a cut as thin as the skirt steak. The cut was tender and juicy with an excellent layering of flavors that let the meat be the star of the show. The black beans had a bit of Cotija cheese, but not overly salty. Also included on the plate was a cucumber, onion and tomato salad that made an excellent accompaniment. The portions were appropriate for a dinner that might include three or four courses. It was all I ate and I was pleasantly full and took no leftovers home.\n\nWe sat on the patio, though being on the second floor and completely covered it barely felt like being outdoors. The breeze blowing through occasionally, made for a comfortable atmosphere reminiscent of a Pacific Coast Mexican restaurant. The patio was a bit on the noisy side as there were few soft surfaces to dull the sounds of the many conversations going on around us. \n\nThe wait staff made fine recommendations and were attentive to our needs. Our waiter recommended my meal and drink and I'm glad he did. \n\nI thought the prices were reasonable for anywhere in the US and exceptionally reasonable for Las Vegas \n\nOver all I would say that if you are in Las Vegas and have a hunger for Mexican food, grab cab and head over to the the Mandalay Bay and get yourself a table at the Border Grill"

There are also many different areas to enjoy your meal: inside, outside on a covered patio, or completely outside by the pool (shaded by trees).  I love me any place with some patio seating.\n\nThe brunch food comes out as small plates, so you can try a lot of the different dishes and get your money's worth.  I guess the best way to describe it would be like tapas.  I really enjoyed the shrimp and grits.  Like...so much I got three orders of them.  My other favorite was the chorizo and egg tacos.  My one complaint, I felt like some of the dishes had too much egg in them in proportion to other ingredients.  I can only take so much egg!  But the Mexican twist on breakfast favorites was something I'm really glad I tried.\n\nThe mimosas come in different flavors like classic orange, pomegranite, and passion fruit.  And they don't skimp on them!  They come in some pretty hefty pour flutes!\n\nYou know, in all honesty, I don't know if I'd go again just because it's quite a bit of money to spend on breakfast, but I would definitely say you have to go at least once and expereince this!"

The torta was OK but had a small amount of fish compared to the very large roll. My husband had the lunch burrito that was filled with chicken rice and black beans.

($14.00) The chips are made with the tortillas there, you can tell, and they are really good......their fresh tortilla were amazing.....seriously some of the best I have ever tried. The Vegetarian Black Beans were great, the cheese is like a feta cheese, not my favorite, but my GF liked it a lot. Her BF ordered the Nachos, and they were just a huge portion size and very very good. The Shrimp Tacos were not too good in my opinion. Just difficult to eat, not a very good sauce and just not very good in general. The Fish Tacos, according to my friend were the best she ever had! My bean and cheese burrito was only $4.00 compared to their $16.00 meals, so I was very happy with it. Very filling, and just make sure you order it with Black Beans, cause I got the re fried beans the first time around and I didn't think they were very good. The salsa they have there is delicious.

I had previously marveled at the freshness and flavor in each, and ordered all of Mary Sue Miliken and Susan Fenniger's books so I could make these at home. I'm happy to report that their salsa recipes are easy to make and very close in flavor to the restaurant's. (Look for some recipes on the blog soon!)\n\nThe steak here is some of the best I've ever had - and from the two times I've had it before in Santa Monica, I can also report how impressively consistent it is. Great marinade on tender, high quality steak is always a winning combination.\n\nD liked his tacos, though isn't as in love with this restaurant as I am.\n\nAn important note, for the Vegas patrons who live on points and rewards - they may be located within Mandalay Bay, but this restaurant is actually independent - you do not earn nor can you use reward points here. Not that it should discourage you from going at all, just good to know!"

I wouldn't recommend going out of one's way to dine here though since there are far better Mexican restaurants elsewhere in town.  Border Grill is the epitome of a tourist trap as one would expect given its location.  Going in I new this but the scene was quite bleak at the other spots and the food court was crowded and well, I don't eat fast food.\n\nIn retrospect I should have gone to the food court.  The service, at the bar hightop was great, but serving stale tortilla chips?  This is 2015 at a premier spot on the Strip with prices two times what they should be for Mexican fare.  I drank an Arnold Palmer, or two, OK it was likely three...those were decent and I believe the bartender made them with fresh lemonade.  The entree, I don't recall what it was but it was probably something safe, such as a chicken quesadilla.  The fact that the entree doesn't stand out in my recollection of the meal but the stale soggy chips does proves my point; this place is merely \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""

So I was pretty excited to have a chance to dine at one of their restaurants. \n\nMy first issue was with the property itself - there's no restroom in the restaurant.  I only wanted to wash my hands so it was more than inconvenient to trek down a flight of stairs to do so (out in the casino).  At a minimum, they should have a sanitizer dispenser available.  I just hope the staff has some place more convenient for frequent hand washing.  Gross. \n\nThen the service was just so-so.  I had one single refill during my meal and I had to ask for it!   Even then, the waitress took another 'forever' to honor my request.  She came up just as I was heading to the bar to get it myself. \n\nAll of that could have been forgiven had the food been remotely intriguing.  But it wasn't.  The guacamole had some funky twangy creamy action going on.  We trued doctoring it with the tomatillo sauce. My friend's grilled fish tacos were over cooked and served on some stale tortillas.  Other flavors leaned towards bland.  Our other companion had to salt his carnitas.  Turns out, he paid dearly for his selection. He spent much of the night on the throne. My chicken quesadillas were just 'meh'.  I've had better Mexican/Tex-Mex at chains.  I don't expect much from those and in comparison- easily get better.  Really disappointing."

While we were waiting to be seated a woman already eating said,  \"this is the worst Mexican food I've ever had.\" Considering the location and reputation of the chef I thought that was a little overly dramatic and possibly overstated but it still made me concerned.   Anyway the menu was full of standards--quesadillas and taco options--but I wanted to have something that required enough effort that the chef couldn't just mindlessly throw it together so I chose the Yucatan Pork.\nIt was a business lunch so I was concerned that the portion would be a little much but I went for it and so did the gentleman seated next to me (a former bball player built like a lineman, so my portion question remained). \nThe pork was tender, fall apart, melt in your mouth good and season perfectly. The mountain of pork was more than enough and so distracting that the tasteless tortilla accompaniment was unnecessary and unmissed.  A side of sweet plantains with a bit of crunch was excellent!  I considered taking my table mates portion since they weren't of interest to him but kept some form of etiquette and decorum.  I'm not sure what the concoction was but the black bean paste on the side was another great edition with the cheese and rice.\nIgnore the mile long trek through the restaurant to be seated outside on a freezing Vegas afternoon, and the young \"too busy for you\" waitstaff and I would go back specifically for this dish!"

Our waitress, Carmie, suggested the brunch tasting menu and some fabulous drinks.  So happy we listened to her.  Everything we tasted was phenomenal and our drinks were on point.  The steak and eggs, tres leches french toast, serrano ham waffle, churro tots...MmmMmmM.... to die!!!!!!!!!!  Carmie was an excellent waitress!!!  She was personable and professional.  We can't wait to return."

We ate around 7 pm on a Monday and had no problem getting in. My dad and I started our meal off with guacamole, a pineapple mojito, and a peach margarita. As an entree my dad ordered the grilled fish tacos: it came with three tacos that were served in hand made corn tortillas and three different types of rice. I ordered a bowl of tortilla soup without cheese and also the tuna crude. My dad really enjoyed the dish and thought they were surprisingly light. I absolutely loved the tuna crudo. I am a true sushi snob and it has to be amazing for me to love it. This truly was unique, the combination between the fresh tuna, avocado, chipotle essence, and my favorite part toasted quinoa on top to add a bit of crunch. Words cannot describe how unreal it truly is. The soup also is something I highly recommend  as well, the base is very delicious with just a touch of heat added. The avocado in it adds a cooling factor to it though. Overall we were very impressed with this restaurant yet again. We shall be dining there again very soon."

This was one of the best brunches I've had as it played perfectly to my dislike of commitment / deficit of attention, plus the food was super flavorful, perfectly cooked, etc.\n\nBetween the 4 of us, we tried almost everything, I think. Table faves included the Chilequiles, Huevos Rancheros, Chorizo and Egg taco, Steak and Egg, Guava Empanada, Yucatan Egg Benedict, and Coconut French Toast (for dessert, of course).\n\nSo all that is $25 each, and for $5 more, you get bottomless mimosas-- The orange mimosas were boring, but the pomegranate and passion fruit were quite tasty. \n\nOur server was great too - had our next mimosas out before the one before it was empty... kept the pace up faster at first, and then slowed down as we got more and more full, attentive but not pressuring. Great atmosphere sitting outside overlooking the Mandalay Bay pool area, too.\n\nAll around a win - I'm already looking forward to going back!"

First night I had peach lemonade (too acidic) and the Quinoa Fritters which were excellent. Attention to plating and care in food prep is evident. Second night I had the Chicken Tinga Empanadas and a Cosmo. Drink was delightful and correctly balanced so that not any one ingredient was evident. Empanadas were light, flaky and not the usual \"hand pies\" one comes to expect. Pumpkin Seed Mole was perfectly seasoned and the appropriate viscosity to thoroughly enjoy. Even caught myself dipping a few remaining chips!"

My fiance had a hackerin' for some ceviche and I really wanted a cocktail with lunch.  They had a special Spring menu chalk full of goodies.  We started out with two lemon blueberry mojitos and shared the ceviche.  The mojitos were one of the best I have had.  It was a perfect call from the waiter.  As for the ceviche we couldn't get enough of it.  There was nothing left.  To complete our lunch we split their Chicken Panuchos.  They're like mini harsh shell tacos.  The tortillas of the tacos are stuff with black beans and then fried.  Of course this was devoured.  This dining experience has changed my opinion completely about the Border Grill chain."

Oh lordy lordy, the brunch...I will attempt to describe it in my mere mortal words. \n\nBottomless mimosas for $5. I could probably end the review right there.\n\nEndless small plates for $30. The plates are so amazingly delicious. My mortal words fail me! And don't forget to ask for the Chef's Special plate. He's always got something new you can try that isn't on the menu, and you can follow him on Twitter to find out what it is or just ask for it when you get there. I haven't had a brunch plate yet that I'm not a fan of. \n\nBorder Grill also takes pride in having their ingredients be fresh and as locally-sourced as possible. The only thing I can fault them on is that the beef isn't grass-fed, and for the price it definitely could be but I'm not going to complain too much. \n\nThe chips and salsa are optional for brunch, if you tell them you're there for it they won't bring it out unless you ask for it specifically. The habanero salsa is definitely spicy, but has a GREAT flavor. I encourage you to mix and match the four salsas as well. They all go very well with each other and you can't go wrong with any combination. \n\nThe guacamole is also stellar, although the portion is a bit small. It seems to me that the plate is a small pile of guac and a majority of veggies dressing up the plate. Well, maybe it's the unlimited chips that make it seem small, or the fact that everybody at the table is in a race to eat as much of it as they can before it's all gone.\n\nI go here least once a month for brunch and try to make it every chance I get. Friends that have come with me to dinner here and were only okay with the place have also jumped on board with the brunch and make a semi-regular pilgrimage as well. Seriously. Go here for brunch right now. Weekends, 11:00-15:00. Do it."

            "review": "We came to LV with a toddler and we wanted something close to our hotel (Four Seasons) without having to walk through like 3 smoky casinos. I also wanted to make reservations online. Border Grill fit the bill.\n\nWe ate at around 5:30 so while the place was filling up fast, it wasn't super crowded. As such, service was good and the staff were friendly and efficient. We opted to sit outside on the patio and looking back, I probably wouldn't have gone for this. I mean, the weather was nice but it was so incredibly loud on the patio between the drunken yelling from patrons to the intense bass coming from the patio below the restaurant (or somewhere nearby). \n\nThe prices were a bit higher than your average Mexican place (especially for the ambiance and the crowd). They were fine dining prices minus the fine dining crowd and atmosphere. That being said, the entrees were tasty. We tried the crab ceviche and the jalape\u00f1o slices were not a good addition since they were so spicy that if you ate that in a bite, it overpowered the delicate crab. In addition, it was topped with pink peppercorns and that was an odd choice both texturally and flavor-wise. I think I would pass on this in the future unless they change the recipe (which is doubtful). \n\nI went with the garlic butter scallops and shrimp and this was done really well. The sauce was a light buttery sauce and the huge scallops and shrimp were on top of couscous. The scallop was cooked perfectly and very tender. My husband had the skirt steak and it was cooked about medium/medium rare and also very tender. The server suggested treating it like a fajita with flour tortillas on the side, but if you're avoiding grains, you can totally eat it with the tortillas. The chips and salsa options were good and not too spicy. My child has a huge grilled chicken breast with rice and beans from the kids menu (which was a great value at $8) but my husband mentioned the beans were a bit salty."

My girlfriend had the fish tacos which were about $15 and they were good too.  \n\nThis place is better than Tacos & Tequila @ Luxor which happens to be ranked higher than this place on Yelp.  \n\nI'd go here again for lunch if I was in the area."

We were seated on the outdoor patio. Suddenly a man at a table near us started complaining (loudly) about his meal. Our party tried to ignore his rant and enjoy our meal. The chips, guacamole and salsa were all pretty good. I enjoyed my mojito and my friend enjoyed the first few sips of her sangria (after awhile she said it was \"like licking a candle\"). During our drinks the man at the table near us continued to complain and we noticed that another table near us was speaking to a manager about a problem with their food. We ordered our entrees and our food appeared less than ten minutes later. Not a great sign. My husband ordered the shrimp and portions of the plate were cold. My friend ordered the pork and she said it was okay...not great. My vegetable enchiladas tasted a lot like something you could order at Chevy's. I'm fairly certain that the food was pre-made and just dumped on our plates. Overall, I'm bummed that we wasted a meal in Vegas on this place."

Having lived for 3 years in Mexico City, I appreciate that style of Mexican that differs from the regular American Tex-Mex. Border Grill has a lot of dishes that are different from most American Mexican restaurants and so when we go I truly enjoy each plate. \nModerately priced for the quality, it's a good spot for a date or business dinner if you're in that area. \nService is always very good, and cocktails are nice and strong the way I like it. \nOnly downside is the restroom is all the way down the stairs towards the ballrooms on the bottom level. After a couple cocktails it's kind of a pain to trek all the way down a huge flight of stairs and down a long hallway. Not sure why so many of the restaurants in casinos do that ( I suppose so you'll be tempted to play a slot machine or table game on your way back?), but it's annoying. \nDinner for two with guacamole and chips, two dinners and a couple cocktails is around $120. Pretty standard price for a well known restaurant on the strip."

I recommend starting at the bottom of the list and moving up; the best stuff is near the bottom. However, if you're more a pick and choose, the serrano ham waffle is a must as are the breakfast fries. They have 8 flavors of mimosas, which you can add on to your brunch as bottomless for another $10 (totally worth it); a good change from the normal orange juice. Beware though, they are a glass of champagne with a scoop of fruit pur\u00e9e at the bottom, as opposed to a normal 50/50 oj to champagne. \nOur waitress was wonderful and gave us a good recommendation as how to go about the menu. She said the top four items (yogurt parfait, tomatillo egg Benedict, egg sandwich and chili relleno) weren't very good and unless you were super into the idea of any of those. \nOverall very satisfied and highly recommended!"

Each item on the menu sounded absolutely mouthwatering that you wanted just say \"screw it!\" and order everything. \n\nBut then you learn which plates are good and which, well, suck.\n\nSalmon Slider: Smoked salmon isn't my favorite, but when combined with other ingredients like goat cheese and jalape\u00f1o bacon, it's delicious. This would've been perfect, but sadly the bun was dry. \n\nChicken and Waffle: Meh. The blue corn waffle was dry, and there was a lack of sweetness that I was expecting -- it is chicken and waffles after all. At least the chicken was crunchy, and I really digged the hotness of the mango habanero coulis. \n\nEgg White Oysters Rockefeller: I should've ordered 20 of these because this was the best thing I ate. I loved the creamed spinach and the tempura battered oyster. \n\nBreakfast Fries: Rich. The fries were soggy-crispy. Blame it on the wetness of the short braised rib and chipotle hollandaise sauce.\n\nSteak and Egg: I ordered the steak at medium-well, which was perfect. Except, the steak was very salty when I first bit into it. \n\nService - The waitstaff was attentive, but it took forever to bring out our food. Yeah, I get it, each item made-to-order, but what's annoying is when not everyone's food is brought out all at once. It's awkward having to play that game where you want to eat your food, but you also want to wait for the other person to receive theirs. There were just too many moments when our waitress had to check on our orders for us. \n\nOverall - I'm giving Border Grill a 3.5. Brunch is hit or miss, unfortunately. If I ever return, I'll probably skip the brunch option and order off their regular lunch or dinner menus."

The hostess seems a little confused about what the plan was since we wasn't selling it over well.  Once we figured out what the deal was, I was very exicted to eat there.  For $25 (or $30 with bubbles), you got to order from a Mexican style tapas menu with about 20 items.  It's also an all you can eat set up, so you can taste as many of the items on the menu as possible. \n\nThe same hostess tried to seat us at the worse table in the restaurant - a 2 top right by the kitchen door.  I asked if we could set anyplace else and she seems confused (again).  Luckily we got a larger table and everything went pretty smooth after that.  For some reason our waitor was held up somewhere and the manager came over to explain.  I'm glad that we ended up with the waitor that we did because she was friendly and did a great job.\n\nWe also tried a couple of their cocktails.

He asked for the red sauce to be put on the side but the waiter said it couldn't be done (what?!) and his plate came flooded with sauce.\n\nAnyway, we came in between the normal lunch and dinner area and sat in the quiet balcony-patio area.

The Skirt Steak was cooked prefect to how we ordered it (Medium Rare) and was deliciously seasoned with fresh homemade tortilla and accompaniments. The Yucatan Pork was delicious; a balance of sweet and spicy (although it really wasn't that sweet, more so just used cinnamon as a spice in the cooking process). It comes with three small homemade corn tortillas, accompaniments, as well as some plantains which were a little dessert added in my opinion.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place if you are in L.A. or VEGAS!"

DELICIOUS - the lemon cucumber was my favorite.\nChicken and Blue corn waffles were pretty great.\n\nCons:\nThe rest of the food was pretty average. It tasted good, but nothing really stood out.

Border Grill is a VERY refreshing alternative. People complain about the prices, but considering all the other restaurants in that wing are $59 pre-fixe... it's all relative. \n\nTucked a bit farther away towards the convention center, it was MUCH less crowded than other dining options in the area. Our service was excellent, and the food just as good as their location in Santa Monica, CA. \n\nThe Sweet Corn Tamales and Ceviche were excellent.

I felt that it was a little pricey for what you get, but the food was good. I love that they offer a locals discount and you can get restaurant.com gift certificates, so there are discounts available. \n\nOne of my favorite meals is brunch and I was pleased to learn that they offered an all you can eat small plate brunch. So I immediately set up a brunch date with my girls and it has been our go-to brunch restaurant ever since. The small plates are super awesome, again it is a little pricey, but it is all you can eat! I love that they start the table with fruit and guava empanadas. The empanadas are flakey and absolutely addicting, I seriously dare you to only eat one. Some of my favorite dishes are the skirt steak and eggs, short rib hash and eggs, breakfast fries (super yum), chilaquiles, and I always order at least two potato tacos. There are a few misses for me as well, the plantain empanadas just taste burnt and the churro tots are way too dense. \n\nSince discovering the delicious brunch, I have been here at least four times. The last time we were seated downstairs and it is by far the best place to sit when it is too hot to sit on the patio. It's all glass so you can still see the pool outside and you get plenty of sunshine. If you want to have a fun, delicious, and laid back weekend brunch you absolutely must check out Border Grill."

Everyone was so delightful and even made me a birthday card. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with selecting what we wanted. for $25 it is an all you can eat made to order brunch. did you read that? MADE FRESH! ALL YOU CAN EAT! YUMS! we started with a guava empanada. it was good, but i knew i had to get my share of the yucatan egg benedict. I should have saved that for last though.very filling for such a small plate. the biscuit and sausage gravy was amazing too. steak and eggs were an A+ and Dan's favorite. the coconut french toast had me wide eyed with a giant smile. very heavenly. i wish i could have tried more. this is when i wish my stomach was larger. our waitress brought me out a mexican chocolate birthday cake which was awesome. something to order when it is not included in the all you can eat menu. for $5 more we added on the bottomless mimosas and i am so glad we did. they have a few flavors to choose from including the classic mimosa.\nI was very pleased with this brunch and I am sure I will be back. The covered outside patio had me feeling like i was on vacation even though I am a local. The food was amazing and the staff beyond friendly when they didn't have to be. They made my birthday! They also offer a locals card with your Las Vegas ID for 15% off which is an added bonus.\nThis place was def money well spent. Can't wait for the next brunch!"

(More on that later...)\n\nWe sat on the patio for Easter brunch. Although it was crowded, service was pretty fast, and the food--as usual--was delicious. For $40 each (plus $15 each for bottomless mimosas), my husband and I tried the following (in order of preference):\n\nBreakfast Fries (The BEST! Can't go wrong with Mexican poutine!)\nChicken and Blue Corn Waffle\nYucatan Egg Benedict\nChorizo and Egg Taco\nSmoked Salmon Slider\nFried Green Tomatillos\nMachaca Chilaquiles\nFresh Fruit (served in a pastry cone)\nEgg White Oyster Rockefeller (too much egg; not enough oyster)\nBananas Foster Crepes\nPlus copious cucumber mimosas for me and traditional ones (with OJ) for him\n\nPer usual, we ordered from the menu, and the staff brought out the food in waves. As I said, the food was great, and our waiter kept the drinks coming. I was pleasantly surprised by the cucumber mimosas, which I'd never had (or heard of) but are now definitely my favorite.\n\nUnfortunately, there was some miscommunication between the kitchen and the servers, because our food kept going to the wrong table and we kept getting food that we didn't order. That wasn't too big a deal, because all the diners around us were friendly and had no problem passing over the correct plates, but it seemed like the tickets were somehow one table off.\n\nThe other minor problem was that there was nothing to put your used silverware on while you were waiting for your next plates to come out. We ended up tearing an empanada in half and using it as spoon rests for our forks and knives, but it would be great (and easy) to just bring out a couple of little plates for diners to rest their silverware on. (Especially for us diners on the patio, where the tables were a little dusty.)\n\nThat said, we will definitely be back to Border Grill, and I hope I can bump my grade up to 5 stars next time around. (And I hope they put the Breakfast Fries on the permanent brunch menu. YUM-MY!)"

As far as vegetarian meals go in this town, this was BY FAR the best. \n\nFor $34.99, you can have unlimited small plates off the brunch menu. Following the advice of our waiter (who was awesome, by the way), we \"ordered more of what we liked, and didn't eat what we disliked.\" A perfect fit for the excess and grandiosity of this town. \n\nWe started with the Yogurt Parfait, which was light and cleansing. Fresh fruit layered with homemade granola and yogurt, with a slightly sour lime zest on top. It fit the tropical resort feel of Mandalay Bay flawlessly. The Green Corn Tamales were up next. They are not traditional tamales, but rather use a blend of sweet corn. I found the taste pleasant and enjoyed the pairing of the sweetness with the salsa fresca and sour cream.  We also sampled the Tres Leches French Toast, which is a wonderful option if you have a sweet tooth. The Brioche was flavorful and perfectly cooked and I didn't find the pairing of fresh berries to be overly sweet. It was perfectly decadent. I also really enjoyed the Chilaquiles. This was my first encounter with this dish and I found their presentation of flavor to be quite good. The fried egg was fabulous with the spicy avocado pur\u00e9e and smoked tomato salsa. I do wish the crispy corn tortilla chips had been slightly more crispy, but they were still well flavored. \n\nOur favorite dish, by far, was the Cauliflower Taquito. We ordered this one three times in one sitting. The spicy avocado salsa does have a kick to it, but the flavor is extremely satisfying and pleasant. It really is just the perfect amount of spice. I was unsure if the jicama slaw would be a good companion, but it did balance the spiciness of the salsa quite well. \n\nIt was very hard to find unique brunch options that were accommodating to vegetarians in Las Vegas. I'm thrilled that we found the Border Grill as it provided a comparatively large selection. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Next time I'm in town, this place will be on the top of my list."

They were different than any other type of taco I have had and really a flavor explosion. I'm not sure how to explain the texture of the potato but it was almost like a mashed potato that had been fried on a hard fried tortilla with chipotle crema. It also came with guacamole and a corn salsa. I would definitely order these many times again. In fact I think I will be craving these with no way to get them :(\n\nWe also had the carne asada quesadilla. It was also delicious. The carne asada was probably the best I have ever had.

Now...does not remembering what I ate mean the food was forgettable, or does it simply mean that I killed one too many brain cells this weekend. I'll let you make that decision (one is far more likely than the other).  \n\nSomething that I always fret about are serving sizes. Serve me a massive plate of food with only a little of what I ordered and like 90% rice won't make me happy, but serve me a dish with a generous helping of shrimp on a bed of rice and greens and I'm a happy camper. I'll camp here more often."

This is crazy psuedo-mex from Miami or something. The only people they could fool are east-coasters and Las Vegas convention goers who get lured in by passing through all the time.\n\nEverything tasted like lime. The corn tortillas were a pasty, dry mess and terribly under salted or not salted whatsoever. It's hard to imagine a mexican place that can screw that up. The truth is, however, real mexicans could not have had anything to do with concocting the food served here. This place exists to sell cocktails and $6 lime ades. \n\nIf you're going to eat at Mandalay, head over to Burger Bar not too far away. If you're looking for mexican, go elsewhere."

But I was in Las Vegas for the weekend staying at Mandalay Bay, and there was a Border Grill at the Mandalay!  So me and my friends decided to give it a try.  I'm not a Vegas person at all since I don't like to gamble.  So I was just there for the pool, drinks and food!  \nSusan Feniger of the Two Hot Tamales is the mastermind of Border Grill.  I've heard a lot of great things about it, so I was very excited to try it out!\nWe started out with the Cadillac margaritas and guacamole and chips.  I like my margaritas on the rocks no salt.  The waiter delivered mine with salt.  No biggie, I just wiped the salt away.\nThe guacamole was okay.  It was a bit on the creamy side for my taste.   I prefer guacamole on the chunky side.  One of my friends just loved the guac.\nI decided to order one of the specials for the evening, which was highly recommended by our waiter.  It was tuna encrusted with pistachio served over a pobalno risotto topped with a jicama slaw.  My other two friends ordered the chile relleno and the pork slowly cooked in banana leaves.  \nThe tuna was way overcooked.  So overcooked that it was dry.  The waiter when explaining the special said it was cooked medium (slightly pink).  The risotto was also a big disappointment.  Some parts seemed like it wasn't cooked enough.  My dish was a big disappointment.  Also, my meal wish lukewarm at best.  It seemed like it was sitting out for a while.  I should've returned it after the first bite but I didn't since I had a second cadillac margarita to wash it down.\nMy friend's meals were way better than mine.  The chile relleno was very good.  But I thought the best meal was the pork slowly cooked in banana leaves.  It was cooked perfectly and great flavor.\nFor dessert we shared the empanadas stuffed with dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate.  And we also shared the homemade ice cream, a scoop of vanilla bean, and a scoop of kahlua chip.  The dessert was the best part of the meal for me, unfortunately.  I really wanted to love Border Grill.  But my tuna special was a big disappointment.  I may give it a second try...this time checking out the LA restaurant."

It was our last day and wanted to end our trip with a nice lunch before driving a couple hours home. We had just finished looking through Mandalay Bay`s Shark Reef and were getting hungry. The first place we came across was Border Grill and immediately gravitated towards it when I saw Susan Feninger`s name. Well-known chef for her modern twist on Mexican cuisine and cheftestant on Bravo`s \"Top Chef Masters\" season 1.\n\nLooked at the menu for a bit. Border Grill doesn`t have that many options, so we decided to walk around Mandalay Bay to see if we were interested in anything else. Most of the restaurants in that part of the hotel weren`t open for lunch. We walked as far to Rum Jungle, didn`t want to walk to the other side of the hotel where they had more restaurants, and made our way back to Border Grill.\n\nBorder Grill looked to be very busy, even for lunch, the place was packed. As we were taken to our seats, we saw a couple things on people`s tables that intrigued us. The first thing to hit your table are fresh chips and three kinds of salsa. The chips were hot and not at all greasy. We took a glance at the menu and looked for some of those things that we saw on the way in. One was the Steak Nachos. They looked so good, so we knew we had to get an order of that to start. For our entrees, I ordered the Spicy Shrimp Tacos and my boyfriend got the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas.\n\nWhen the Steak Nachos arrived at our table, I didn`t realize how big it was. I could have had that as my entree and would have been totally fine. Border Grill definitely doesn`t skimp on the toppings. A lot of good small sized pieces of steak, plenty of melty gooey cheese, onions, tomatoes, jalapenos, and big dollops of sour cream and guacamole. So amazing! The Spicy Shrimp Tacos we were really good. Chipotle marinated shrimp, cucumber slaw, guacamole, and a chipotle aioli. The tacos also come with rice and refried beans. The Chicken Poblano Enchiladas had smoked chicken, wrapped in corn tortillas, topped with poblano cream and a mix of grilled corn, mushrooms, and poblano chiles. OMG... that poblano cream was the best thing on that dish! So good! I would definitely go back for the poblano cream alone. Everything on the menu should be served with poblano cream. Yummy..."

Knowing it can get busy on a Saturday, especially on the night of a show, I made a reservation on OpenTable. Got there on time and checked in at the hostess stand. I wanted inside seating because eating outside during a Vegas summer isn't preferable while dressed up for a show. However, the wait for an inside table was going to be 20-30 minutes. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of my reservation? Since we had a show to get to, we reluctantly took the patio seating to get seated immediately.\n\nOur server Carmie was very nice. She was very helpful when asked for appetizer recommendations. We were torn over which ceviche to order, but she informed us that we could split a ceviche order in half and get a bit of each. Perfect solution. We tried the Baja Ceviche and the Tuna Crudo (the recommendation of Carmie). Ultimately, I preferred the Tuna Crudo. Props for the recommendation. Because we're locals, Carmie suggested we sign up for the VIP Club, which would get us 15% off on future visits, as well as the current visit. Saving money is always appreciated.\n\nAs for my entree, I ordered the Ropa Vieja off the specials menu. It was braised beef short rib, carrot puree, mojo, and crispy yucca. Knowing I'm eating on the Strip, I was a bit worried how much short rib I'd get for $27. Once the dish came out, I was pleasantly surprised at the portion. It was a ton of short rib. Very tender and I could pull it apart without the need for a knife.\n\nOverall a good experience, but not perfect due to the inability to seat us inside even though we had a reservation."

We made a reservation, and I would advise you do the same, so that you can set on the patio close to the pool. We were there in December, but with the heaters and the sun, it was perfect.\n\nThe tapas included 26 or 27 small plates that you can order and sample. I dined with 2 companions and, between the 3 of us, we were able to sample most of the offerings. The highlights for me were the Negro Modelo-braised hash (super tender meat and a perfectly soft fried egg), the shrimp and grits (so creamy with the perfect amount of spice),  the tamales (super creamy), and for \"dessert' the churro tots (just like churros, but in the form a donut hole, accompanied by berry puree and caramel). Actually, there were no bad small plates, each one flavorful and well presented.\n\nThe mimosas were also great (the brunch is $34, and you can add the mimosas for $8) and they have various flavors, including basil apple, grapefruit ginger, cucumber lemon, passion fruit, pomegranate, peach, and orange. I tried most of them, but the cucumber was the most refreshing, with the grapefruit and the pomegranate coming in close seconds.\n\nOur service was amazing...we were sat immediatly (thanks to a reservation) at a table along the edge of the patio, so we could see out and enjoy he sun, Our server was also amazing, letting us absorb the menu and never rushing us (even though we stayed for almost 3 hours). He was very attentive, as were the other members of the team including the manager who came by to check on us and the guys bringing us our food and drinks...they were at our table quite a bit:).\n\nThis was a relaxing and amazing experience, I highly recommend it.

I can honestly say it was the best deal I've had in a long time, and that was about $18 (including tip) for all-you-can eat food plus mimosas (regular and pomegranate)! The champagne brunch normally goes for $29.99 per person, but we had the VIP hook-up.  This is a tapas-style presentation, so you just order to your heart's content--heaven!  We had chips and salsa, cinnamon apple pancakes, guava empanadas plaintain empanadas, fresh fruit plates, carne asada tacos, green corn tamales, machaca chilaquiles, chipotle shrimp BLTs,  and coconut French toast.  Ay yai yai--muy delicioso!  The plaintain empanadas were not that great, but I would definitely recommend the green corn tamales, carne asada tacos, and chipotle shrimp BLTs.  We sat out on the patio, had great service throughout, and our waitress never blinked an eye when we kept ordering more food and mimosas!  I love a great deal on great food and that's what we got today.  Buena suerte!"

            "review": "This is probably more like 2.5 stars. I've always been suspicious of Two Hot Tamales but gave this place a try because it is in our hotel. We had a sample platter to split with three dishes: Chicken panuchos, green corn tamales and plantain empanadas. The plantain empanadas were by far the best of the three. Basically, the exterior of the \"empanada\" is a seared plantain stuffed with a cheesy black bean mix. It is topped with a spicy sauce and a generous amount of crema. Delicious. I could have eaten a whole platter of these.\n\nThe other two dishes were weaker. The green corn tamale was more like a polenta in terms of texture. The flavor was good but a bit sweet even for me (I love sweet). Still, topped with crema and salsa it was tasty enough.\n\nBut the chicken panuchos were inexcusable. The chicken was utterly flavorless. The avocado was nice and the radishes added a much needed bit of brightness but the chicken was so lackluster that it dragged down the whole dish.\n\nThe complimentary salsas were also weak: none of them had any spice and at least two of them were extremely bland.\n\nService was friendly and efficient. Cocktails were delicious and standard \nVegas prices.\n\nA fine place for a quick casual bite but nothing to write home about."

The unlimited food is quite tasty and the bottomless champagne mixtures (mimosa, pomegranate, peach, prickly pear, watermelon, blood orange, strawberry, etc-- try them all if you can!) are very fun.  Although not a traditional breakfast food, be sure to order the BBQ sliders- delish!  Best of all, the prices aren't bad and the view over the Mandalay Bay pool \"lazy river\" is pretty nice as well.  Don't miss out on the Shark Reef either-- it's right by the restaurant and has a locals discount."

They said they want to make everyone happy yet these people stole my name and my reservation and we are the people waiting ... I could not believe this happened- they had two managers working on this and then they called the GM over- the GM finally made them move (I guess they made another table for them?!?) after about 30 minutes- one of the managers finally came over and said sorry. My thought was why didn't you make them move 30 minutes ago since we knew what was going before they were all even seated- he said they couldn't physically remove them- yes that's true but they could have denied service but they didn't... They still got their drinks and chips while we were standing there waiting. I just felt like this could have been handled better- I kept having to walk over to see what was going on... They weren't coming to me or at least bringing us chips while we waited. Once we got seated we had great food, a round of free drinks, and a great server but having to wait 30 minutes while those name thieves munched on chips and the managers not handling it quickly made me pretty HANGRY!"

Cantina Tex Mex is such a great cuisine, and so often under served. This food here was really good, reasonably priced and completely unpretentious - a nice change for a Vegas venue. The Margaritas were excellent. The ceviche sopas were fresh and snappy, not o saucy and just macerated enough. The guac and salsas were super fresh and flavorful, with enough house flair to make them mentionable. I see short ribs all over the place these days, but the rendering here was a Delicious little taquito that did it for me. El Yum-o. If in the Mandalay, the BG is a great bet for happy hour, or just a quick bite on your way from the convention center to the hotel. Andale to the Mandalay, con mucho gusto."

The food was good but not great and not what I expected from two Top Chef Masters.  The good -  Service was very, very good.  The margaritas and cocktails, in general were fabulous and the guacamole was among some of the best I have tasted.  One of my guys had the oxacan strip steak and said it was delicious.  Now the bad -  I had the taquitos and they were tasteless and small.  My husband had the fish tacos and his verdict was that they were \"OK\" but no better than what he can get at home (which is Dayton Ohio - a far piece from the border).  I forget what my Son had but he agreed with my husband that the food was just good but nothing he could not get at home.  That would be OK but this place was pricey for what we got.  Now for the ugly - The place was dirty and the seating was uncomfortable.  We were also promised a \"view\" when we elected to sit on the patio; however, the only people who get a view are the ones who sit in the very front of the patio.  We were at the very back of the patio. The overall appearance of the place just seemed to be chaotic and disorganized.  Not an enjoyable experience at all.  We will not be visiting again."

A friend of ours told us we MUST try Border Grill when they found out we would be staying at The Mandalay Bay Hotel. We are thankful that we listened to the recommendation, what a great place full of ambiance, delicious food and impeccable service. Our servers name was Jessi and boy did she ever make our experience unforgettable. Welcoming us to the restaurant and asking if we have dined with them before. She started us off with a Holiday Margarita and I will be honest I had my doubts about this \"holiday\" drink but boy was she ever correct in her recommendation.\nTo be honest I normally brush off entree specials that are suggested by servers but Jessi described the Mahi Mahi special so well that I could not turn it down. (it may have had something to do with her deep Mid West Accent that sold me but whatever it was I am thrilled I took her suggestion, what a great dish!) My Fiance had the Yucatan Pork (another suggestion of Jessi's) and he could not stop talking about it! \nJessi made us feel as if we were her most important guests, we never had an empty glass, never had a dirty dish sitting in front of us and I personally felt that Jessi anticipated our each and every need.  Being that we live so close and visit Las Vegas quite often we have decided that we will make this our regular spot every time we visit. Way to go Border Grill,with so many options to eat and drink in Vegas you have managed to gain 2 new fans of not only your food and drink but your staff!!!"

My favorite brunch dishes are the shrimp and grits, breakfast fries and chilaquiles.  It is so nice sitting on the patio and service is always great.  Drinks are kept filled and we never feel rushed.  I've been a few times for dinner and love their nachos and fish tacos.  They make great margaritas but I prefer the prickly pear pina coloda or rum punch.  Locals should join their VIP club for 15% off and special offers emailed throughout the year."

(2).\n\nI'm torn about what to say about this place.\n\nWent to dinner with my hubby last night and came armed with a Restaurant.com coupon. They do have a VIP club for locals but the Restaurant.com coupon offers a better discount than 15% off the check.\n\nJust to say, the service is amazing! Shout-out to Dale our waiter who was a whirlwind but still took the time to ensure that we were well looked after. He introduced the menu to us and ensured that we got the most of our experience. Our water glasses were full and our food was served in a timely manner. While our food was okay, I saw him deal with an unhappy customer who didn't like her dish. He took the food back right away without question and apologized because he recommended it. Kudos to Dale!\n\nOkay, on to the food.\n\nMy husband ordered the Border Grill Experience which was $42 for 3 courses which included an appetizer sampler, a steak dish with quesadilla, and tres leches cake. I, being less hungry, just ordered an chicken enchiladas for $26.\n\nThe chips were perhaps a little overcooked for our tastes. The salsas in general lacked salt and acidity (I like the flavour of lime to come through). Of the four we received the chipotle and the diablo salsas were the only two that seemed to be seasoned properly.\n\nThe appetizer plate came with a plantain empanada, a taquito, and a corn tamale. The plantain empanada had great flavour but poor texture from sitting underneath a sauce for a little too long - it really killed the crispiness of a empanada. The taquitos were nice but were a little on the bland side. The corn tamale had the taste and texture of creamed corn. It was one big, hot, gummy mess - a big miss for me.\n\nThe steak entree was good - the marinated tomatoes, cucumber and avocado had a nice acidity that cut through the richness of the beef. The steak itself was a rather large portion which we took part of it home. The accompanying quesadilla however was a little too strong on the cheese flavour for me but had a nice crispness to it.\n\nMy enchiladas were good but yet again a little blander than what I was expecting. Overall, they could have used some more of the filling as well. The combination of chicken, corn, and peppers was ok - not outsanding.\n\nThe tres leches cake had the correct flavours but had difficulties with texture. The sponge was right but wasn't luxuriously drenched in a lovely milk all the way through. So the result was the bottom layers were nice but the top layers were a little on the dry side.\n\nOverall, there are a lot of issues at Border Grill with regards to execution. Normally, I would have given this place a two however in light of our excellent service, I bumped it up to a three."

The green chili tamales were good although a bit undercooked and the chips with various salsa accompaniments were all fairly flavorful.

The generous portion of guacamole was as addictive as crack, and freshly made.\n\nTwo entrees were sampled. First the ceviche sampler is an option if you want to try all the ceviches on the menu. These had the right mix of acidity, fat from avocados and aoli. These dishes were well executed. Second, chicken enchilada with poblano sauce. It was the creamy poblano sauce with the right amount of heat that brought this dish to the next level.\n\nVerdict: affordable, creative and satisfying."

However, this season, they are covered in a grayish sauce (I think it may be mushroom-inspired?) and served in such a way (one enchilada on top of the other) that the entire dish looks like limp fish. When it came out, I was wondering what the heck my husband ordered, but then realized it was mine. They did have Brussels sprouts, which was exciting, but the flavor was very rich and creamy, which I did not expect. Overall, this dish was my first disappointment."

We had 3 adults, 1 3 yr. old and a baby and were sat in their downstairs dining room which was our first experience in that location. Couldn't of been happier. Noise level was accommodating (baby didn't wake up) and our 3 yr old was entertained by the crayons and kids menu brought to the table by Las Vegas's Most Friendly Most Knowledgeable Waitress Autumn. She interacted with our 3 yr. old, remembered his name and made us feel like the center of attention throughout the meal. One of the best service staff's I've had the dining pleasure of. One thing I like to do when I dine is start off with \"What's the best thing on the menu?\" 8 out of 10 you will have the Server \"push\" either the most expensive dish on the menu or the \"catch of the day\". This was not the case at all. Autumn recommended we start with the Quinoa Fritters and Peruvian Ceviche. Both were excellent choices and not to be missed. Side note is that today's Peruvian Ceviche used \"Ono\" so there was a little fishy taste, but we've had this 2x on other occasions and the flavor was on point. In regards to entrees, Autumn recommended the \"Chicken Mole\" and the \"Pescado Veracruzano\". I had the Chicken Mole, which might have been the best decision I have made ALL month. The Chicken breast was juicy, the skin crispy, the flavors completely delectable and not overly salty. A HUGE portion as well. Buyer beware if you fill up on their delicious Chips N Gauc. Needless to say, i'll be reheating this tomorrow. Our other two diners both received the Pescado Veracruzano which is pan seared sustainable seasonal fish *tomato * kalamata olive *jalape\u00f1o * oregano * white wine garlic broth. They were both thrilled as the Olives were not overpowering and it's more of a soup. This dish's secret weapon is that it's made with a slew of Jalapeno peppers, so if you don't like heat, request without. Our party loves the fire, so the more the merrier. We finished with the \"Tres Leches\" and the \"Banana Cream Pie\". Tres Leches (three milk) was super sweet and a great touch to finish the meal. I would recommend ordering a strong espresso to go with this. Overall, can't wait to go back. One of the best dining experiences in a long time and with food and service like this, a true pleasure and tip of the hat to Chef Susan and Chef Mary Sue.\n\nVisited March 2013"

We then traded each other one. \nThis fish was moist, topped with a nice slaw and creamy guacamole. \nThe shrimp, a bit spicy but tasty. They too had a nice slaw topping. \nBoth were served with black beans, a cilantro rice and spanish rice. Both rices were very flavorful. \nSpeaking of flavor, the trio of sauces and chips they serve you before hand are delicious. The green sauce... I could drink by the gallon! \nService was great and quick... \nDefinitely a place to reccommend to friends who are staying at Mandalay Bay. \nFor locals, its not the easiet place to get into..."

I think it's around $35.\n\nCome with a big group for the obvious reason that you can share everything. You can literally order anything off the menu. Our server was very personable (told us his crazy Vegas stories) and helpful (he gave us small family style portions so we could try everything). My favorites were the corn tamale, breakfast fries, and steak and eggs. I didn't love the sweet dishes too much (might be just me though). I will admit that after a while everything started tasting similar. I think the running theme of the meal was eggs in every form possible.\n\nA fun Mexican-themed alternative to your average brunch!"

The oxtail tamale was so good...I'm telling every abuela I know to start making these! The beef tartare and mushroom empanadas were both outstanding as the second course. The dessert...the blueberry ginger tr\u00e8s leches cake was good on the outside cake part, but the blueberry ginger tasted neither of blueberry or ginger. However, that didn't detract from the cake. The entr\u00e9e had some issues, some related to the kitchen and others related to the service.\n\nThe biggest problem we had was with our server. Several times during the meal we had no silverware or water, and he didn't notice until we flagged him down. Then, my entr\u00e9e -- an amazing 22-ounce porterhouse -- came out medium to medium-well instead of the med-rare I ordered. He didn't seem to even notice that it was cooked incorrectly when I showed hi. (it was gray in some parts...GRAY!). I told him if it would take too long, to bring me the short rib instead (it looked great on other tables). A few minutes later, he said it wouldn't take long to fire a new steak. At least 15-20 minutes later, a manager delivered it and apologized profusely. My dining partner was already done eating his steak...not a great way to spend NYE. The filet of the porterhouse was phenomenal, but the NY. strip steak, which was chile-rubbed, still lacked flavor and needed either a sauce or butter finishing. Too much meat to have not enough flavor. Not to mention, what was that horrendous corn cake/casserole slice served on the side? It was...pretty disgusting. I didn't let it ruin an otherwise good meal, but it made absolutely no sense next to a beautiful steak."

There was some rice I dig out of the bottom of the dish, but nearly enough.\nThe service was extremely slow after the meal.

            "review": "If it were possible to award an eatery a negative value of stars, I would most certainly have given Border Grill a negative 10. \n\nI arrived in the company of four other people, in the late afternoon after going to the Aquarium exhibit. We were all very hungry, and excited to get some Mexican food. We're from Texas, and thought it would be interesting to see how a Top Chef's award-winning Mexican food would measure up to the stellar Tex-Mex food to which we are accustomed. \n\nUpon arrival, the hostess was cheery enough, if a bit of an airhead. After being seated, we waited a full five minutes before even being greeted by a server. Following a perfunctory greeting, we were brought chips and salsa (both lackluster and bland) and had to wait another 5 minutes for water. The waiter was nice enough, but seemed to be mostly unconcerned with giving us good service, or making a decent impression.\n\nThe menu itself was rather pricey. If you're at a place that charges $ 4.50 for a fish taco a la carte (with a tortilla the size of a drink coaster and an even smaller filet of Mahi Mahi), you know you won't be able to leave the restaurant without paying upwards of $ 25.00 per person/ per dish. The food is billed as \"Mexican\", but there were no true Mexican dishes on the menu. Everything seemed to be more Central/ South American.\n\nLet me preface my actual food review by saying that we waited a grand total of 35 minutes for our food to arrive. I was to the point of trying to eat our waiter, who had already conveniently disappeared. \n\nI ordered the chile relleno burger, with paprika seasoned fries, and a fish taco a la carte. I asked for the burger rare, because 1) it cuts down on cooking time and I was ravenous, and 2) I simply cannot stand an overcooked, rubbery meat patty. \nThe other members of my party ordered 1) crab nachos 2) beef nachos 3) avocado tacos 4) chicken caesar salad. \n1) The crab nachos were adequate. For a self-proclaimed \"grill\" specializing in seafood, the meat was rather bland and tasteless, and were downplayed by the plethora of toppings heaped upon the actual chip.\n2)The beef nachos were already limp when they arrived at the table. The meat was wholly bland, and the kitchen chose to under-employ cheese, making the overall nacho rather boring.\n3) The avocado tacos were a great disappointment. As said by the consumer of the food, the idea of the avocado tacos was excellent, but the actual execution of the taco was underwhelming. \n4) The chicken caesar salad was probably the worst thing served. You might be questioning how in the world a kitchen can mess up that which is essentially chopped greens and a simple meat fillet. Well, when your \"caesar dressing\" is the taste and consistency of mayonnaise, and is literally drenching the salad, you tend to look unfavorably upon the dish. \n5) My chile relleno burger was probably the best thing served. The burger was cooked to my standard, and the chile relleno itself was decent, if a bit bland. The fries were the only really yummy thing served, and I'm not sure that's something a Mexican restaurant should be proud of. \n6)The fish taco was terrible. The corn tortilla (while \"homemade\") was bland and too thick, and the filet of Mahi Mahi was too thick, overcooked, and bland. The guacamole tasted like something you could get at the grocery store, and was heavily salted. \n\nThe overall really shocking thing to me was the lack of seasoning. The chefs behind the menu are award-winning and famed, but don't know how to use simple seasoning on their food to make it palatable. \n\nThe bill wound up being over $ 150.00 (when the checkbook finally made it to the table), and we paid up, left a tip, and got the hell out of there. I wound up with gastrointestinal issues later on that night. If you're looking for good Mexican food, I highly suggest going elsewhere. To give you an idea of how deeply disappointing this food was, I would suggest going to Taco Bell instead. At least there, you're only paying $.99 for a taco, and the diarrhea is cheaper."

There was a large party, as well as another family with one child.  Perhaps this is reserved for families?  Not sure.  We were seated in a corner, so not the best seating.

            "review": "WOW! THIS is the experience that marks my return to Yelp!  I watched a special on the food network where they selected a new chef for the Border Grill restaurant in Downtown LA.  So while staying at THEHotel (part of Mandalay Bay), I was pleasantly surprised to see the restaurant had a location right here at my hotel (by the Shark reef and overlooking \"the beach\").\nThree wonderful people greeted us and the host stand and quickly sat us at what looked like a prime spot in the patio right by a heated lamp overlooking the city.  \nA handsome young and very tall guy came with chips and salsa and asked if we wanted some fresh guacamole. YES PLEASE!\nOur server (not as tall or handsome as our chip deliverer) came by 20 or so minutes later and without much fanfare took our order.  Friend and I both got the $42 special which comes with a preselected appetizer sampler, 1 entree of our choosing and 1 dessert.  For what I thought was going to be high-end that sounded reasonable.  I ordered a spicy sangria as well (based on the servers recommendation).  After we ordered, I asked our waiter for more chips (gimme a break - it's a Mexican restaurant for gods sake and I'm in Vegas so i can have more than one cheat day) and I reminded him that our guacamole (our $10 guacamole, mind you) never came.  He apologized and said he'd get that right out.\nGot my Spicy Sangria, it wasn't bad.  My friend said it tasted like cough medicine.  Once he said that, it was over.  I could do nothing but taste cough medicine. ICK!\nAfter 20 minutes passed, our food came out by a runner.  I told the runner that I really needed the chips at this point AND the guacamole.  I wasn't playing around anymore.\nAnother runner brought out more chips.  Where's our waiter??  We'd seen so many others at this point that I couldn't even remember what our waiter looked like to begin with.  He finally showed up.  I told him to cancel the guacamole that never came....which in restaurant language should mean, \"bring the goddamn effing guacamole but you better make sure you don't charge for it so you can still get your 20% tip and make up for the sh***y service so far.\nHe sort of apologized but really couldn't care less.\nThe appetizer sampler consisted of 3 items on a plate (sorry I don't know what any are called) and was fairly good.\nMy dish, Kobe beef tacos, consisted of three mini soft tacos with dry lukewarm pieces of Kobe. PASS! \nMy friend got the chicken dish which wasn't so bad and, unlike mine, didn't look like a tapa or appetizer plate.\nFor dessert, when our waiter finally reappeared (I swear to god I have never had such terrible service, not even at my local Marie Calendars) I ordered the Tres Leches which was DIVINE!  I don't even have much of a sweet tooth and I almost devoured that thing.  It was just the right amount of sweetness.  No extreme flavors and the texture of cake was just perfection.\nMy friend got the flourless choco cake which he enjoyed.  I thought the chocolate was just to overbearing.\nAnyway, the bill came out and we were charged for both 3 course specials and the sangria BUT as our waiter put down our check, he did apologize again for the guacamole.......could he get anymore sincere.  He could've made up for it by bringing us a free item, a discount OR by actually starting to be more attentive to us and giving us better service.  He does none of that but as soon as its time to write down his tip, he blurts out an apology. So uncomfortable.  Anyway, I kept the receipt and I'm mailing a copy directly to Susan Feniger, who, based on that food network show, doesn't look like she would put up with any of that in one of her restaurants."

Rachel started us off and Crystal took over, both were incredibly personal, attentive and very knowledgable.  The food was outstanding, flavorful, hot and large portions.  If you like grits, you MUST try the Tecate Carnita's.  There were six of us so we ordered quite a few dishes...the Queso Fundido was very good and any dish with the short ribs I highly recommend!  I could go on about this place, but I think you get the picture. We will definitely be back.  It's located at Mandalay Bay."

            "review": "Everything was outstanding with our visit to Border Grill.  Read about this in Vegas magazine and was so happy we decided to go here.  My girlfriend was really looking for a good meal with lots of flavor and this didn't disappoint.  We walked from the Wynn to Mandalay Bay to take in Las Vegas on our last night, so definitely worked up an appetite.  The margaritas were very clean and crisp with a hint of spice and paired great with the ceviche sampler that we started with.   After we demolished the delicious starter, we moved on to entrees - she had the Chicken Mole Verde and I went with the Yucatan Pork.  Both were incredibly filling and so very flavorful.  The Chicken was succulent and the pork was just delicious.  We had eaten enough that we didn't dare eat dessert and ended up taking some of our entrees home with us.  The wait staff topped off the experience by being involved, friendly and attentive.  Would highly recommend and plan to go there again when in Vegas."

My friends & I sat on their lovely patio for brunch for the 2nd time & it keeps getting better & better. Hands down, no Las Vegas brunch can match the quality & price you get at Border Grill. We also had the pleasure of meeting \"The Two Hot Tamales,\" it's great to see a celebrity chef owned restaurant with chefs actively involved in their own restaurant & not just a famous name attached to it! Even the executive chef Mike came out to our table just to make sure we were enjoying everything. I can't wait to go back for brunch, next time I'll try the unlimited mimosas they offer, the table next to us had them & those mimosas looked so refreshing! Thanks for another great dining experience!"

            "review": "So much on the menu here is just too needlessly expensive. Another victim of the \"Hey it's Vegas, charge 75% more than that would cost anywhere else\" mentality. In my opinion, you're better off hogging as many free chips as you can (the three salsas were well liked by everyone) and ordering a salad. That formula should get you full enough while being budget friendly. The salad I got was the Watercross, Avocado and Orange salad. It was delicious once I got rid of the avocado. It came with three bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and blue cheese that created a flavor fiesta in my mouth. We had a nice outdoor table on a patio that overlooked the impressive Mandalay Bay pool. The restaurant is tucked in the very back of Mandalay Bay like it's some kind of ugly duckling."

A special request due to allergies was the one downfall. It didn't occur and one member of our party unfortunately had to leave early with benadryl in tow. Except for that it was a very good meal and we'd likely give it another try. The 4 star rating is mostly in regards to their inability to manage a simple one ingredient food allergy."
