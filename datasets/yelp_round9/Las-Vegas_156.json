Other than the nice decor and settings there is little to desire.\n\nWe went through the typical 1 hour wait to be seated, then 30 minutes waiting for food. And food was terrible, blend and rubbery, even the chocolate lava that kids crave didnt come out right, too sweat and watery. These kinds of crap for $29 per dish?\n\nThe only delight besides decor was the folks bringing kids balloons and tricks with twisting them."

I stopped here with family while we were on the strip and needed a child friendly restaurant indeed I was not expecting too much but I was actually impressed that the food was better than expected. I wouldn't have come here without a family with children to eat by myself.  However I will recommend it to families with children their father himself from the strip and need and entertaining environment along with better-than-expected food for a theme styled restaurant."

To start we and one other table were the only people in the dining room I should have taken that as a sign. Our server took about 10 minutes to come wait on us by then we were ready to order drinks and food. Then 20-25 minutes went by still no drinks or appetizer was brought but then EVERY thing was brought out at the same time my burger was burned so black I took one bite and didn't eat any more the server wasn't concerned at all. Do not go to this place if your in Vegas so many other amazing places to eat on the strip"

It was my nieces birthday so before they arrived i let the hostess know we had a birthday girl, that we wanted to add the volcano dessert. when we were finally seated they took almost 20 mins to ask us for our drinks. my brother in laws mojito had zero amount of alcohol. the waiter gave him an attitude rolled his eyes and then replaced it. we asked the birthday girl what she wanted to order. the waiter snapped and said i can just come back and started walking away. we had to call him back because we were already ready he just couldnt wait for two seconds for the little girl to order. He got my sisters salad wrong but she ate it anyways since we had already been waiting for so long. then he brings us the check. so we reminded him about the birthday dessert that we wanted to surprise my niece with. which now the surprise was ruined. so for every other birthday at other tables over 6 or more waiters would go sing. when they came to our table it was our waiter and one other. please dont go here!!! unless you like over expensive food and getting treated like garbage"

            "review": "The Rainforest Caf\u00e9 is just a gimmicky restaurant but it's a fun place.  During your meal, the animals along the edges come to life.  In the middle of the restaurant are visible stars of the night.  The different animals make noises, moves and the restaurant is alive.  Our waiter was attentive.  I ordered a sandwich and my daughter ordered from the child's menu.  My sandwich was ok but my daughter's pizza looked like a frozen pizza that was heated up.  Nothing special about the kid's menu.  She had the fruit, which was a handful of grapes and I had the fries.  Our waiter came and refilled our drinks.  We went before the dinner rush.  It wasn't crowded when we went for dinner and we were able to get a table pretty quickly.  I did notice that there was a waiting room full of people when we were leaving.  The downstairs is the giftshop.  I do like the alligator (or is it crocodile?) in the \"swampy\" area as you walk in.\n\nGiven the choice, don't sit outside.  Sit inside.  For the most part, you're paying for the rainforest experience and you'll miss out on it if you sit outside.  You're not coming to this restaurant for the food."

I had made reservations since it was Valentine's Day and I wasn't sure how busy they were going to be. During the call I requested to sit outside which they said no problem. When we arrived they sat us inside, I asked if it would be a problem to go outside since my 3 year old was asking. The hostess rolled her eyes and told me she guessed that was fine but I'll have to wait a long time for a server. She wasn't joking after almost 15 minutes someone came and took our drink order. The drinks then took another 10 minutes. Once we ordered our food I asked for an app of chips and guacamole. The food took 56 minutes! And the chips never came out by this point we were starving! Our server rarely visited us, took forever to get our refills and was just so nonchalant and mind you the place was empty! At the end of the meal I asked if he minded taking a picture of the two of us. He left for 5 minutes before he came back. By that point another table had offered to take it for us. I'm glad my 3 year old enjoyed it but I was disappointed. Such a big corporation like Landrys should have way better staff! I'm only giving it a star because the atmosphere is way better than the old one at the mgm"

The place is tiny! 1/10th the size of other locations with only rundown 5 animatronics at most. \nThere was maybe 7 other guests in the entire place with 3 servers, 1 hostess and 2 table boys. You would think service would be on top right? Wrong! Slowest service I've ever had! Had to practically beg for refills. Never got extra napkins and to top it all off you think they would've for the 4 of us to be present when they brought out the cake, nope! Two were in the bathroom.\nNot to mention it took 30 minutes to get the dry cold food and another 20 for dessert.\nDon't waste your time or money here! Very disappointed, looked forward to it the entire trip."

My reservation at 7 that turned into a 3 hour dinner.... are you kidding me?\n\nThe place is cool and all, I used to go to the one at MGM when I was in grade school but this was disgustingly terrible. It took us literally 30 minutes to order because the server kept leaving the table after we ordered..... It took 45 minutes for ONE appetizer between 12 people to show up and our cocktails weren't even out yet! Are you kidding me???? Then after a hour and a half after me complaining twice wondering where the hell our food was another 20 minutes rolls around and they start giving out the food SLOWLY, like not even in one sitting!? In the first wave of food they literally gave my friend her dinner salad and our food didn't come out until an hour after her salad. They gave out food to 12 people like in  10 minute increments. Are you freaking kidding me? The food was okay, and seriously so overpriced. but WTF seriously guys? Get it together... worst service I've ever encountered in my 22 years of life. I SERIOUSLY SAT THROUGH 8 \"RAINFOREST\" SHOWS MY WHOLE TIME THERE. F this place. Stay away at all costs.\n\nProbably the worst birthday dinner I've ever had."

            "review": "First time going to any Rainforest cafe, the setting is awesome!! But sadly my experience wasn't so great.. \nI made reservations 24hrs in advance for my party, who ever I spoke to on the phone was a great help and they even took a note saying I was celebrating my mothers birthday.. As we arrived we where greeted by the very happy hostess which was another good start. But when it came to ordering our waiter never gave us his name, took our order and left. He never returned until a good 40 minutes later to get our refills. When he came back he dropped our drinks off and left. He never came to check on us while waiting for our food or came to tell us that the kitchen was behind. We waited a little longer then an hour to get our dinner, that arrived at 8:20. We didn't order appetizers and half of our party where children, so the orders where pretty easy and small. After we got our food we ate and talked. Waited around for the check, assuming the waiter would do a birthday celebration like they did for the other 10 tables being served, he never did. Why ask if I'm celebrating anything if you aren't even going to acknowledge when we are there, why we came in the first place? The manager I happened to speak with after my dinner was extremely apologetic and told me she would have a talk with her employee, she also said that she saw the note on my ticket for a birthday and doesn't understand why he didn't celebrate for us.  I spent over 100$ for dinner and the customer service was the worst I ever had. Another problem I had was with the bussers walking around clueless with plates of food. Not knowing where they were going.  All in all, I would not recommend this to anyone anytime soon, the staffing or training needs to change/improve."

I don't even know why people bother coming here when there's plenty of better choices around it. \n\nThe food here is so over priced for basic American food that I thought I was going die looking at menu. I went for a birthday and they wouldn't let our party sit down until everyone got there. \n\nOh god. When it came to ordering that was a disaster. Our server took my order and then walked away? Even when he came back five minutes later, it took him literally 20 minutes to get everyone's order. There was 11 of us...\n\nONE HOUR AND HALF LATER...\n\nI was the only one that got my sad soggy little island Caesar salad $7. No else got their food yet. Then slowly we got nachos and then that's it! No ones drink even came yet. So the birthday girl complained and their excuse was \"they wanted us to get our appetizers first\". Okay that's a lie. There was only two of us that got appetizers. Also our waters were never filled either! \n\nFinally one by one, every 5 minutes, the food was finally coming out! I got my chicken tenders $10 and it only came with 3 pieces? The buffalo sauce tasted just like red hot. \n\nWhen we got checks, our server just put all 11 checks on the center of the table. Too lazy. \n\nThis place is a tourist trap and I will never step foot into a rainforest cafe ever again."

Its is at one of the most busiest and difficult intersections for both pedestrians and cars. \n\nWe parked at the Miracle Mile parking lot which is basically at the back of the property... then walked through and exited the Miracle Mile Mall, then had to go up to the pedestrian bridge to get the Rainforest cafe.  THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO GET THERE!  The Miracle Mile parking lot is crazy busy.  And there are a lot of \"questionable\" people just hanging around in the parking lot.  Also going up the elevator to get to the pedestrian bridge... ran into a security guard escorting a totally drugged out guy that looked like he was about the heave.  Not exactly what I wanted my kids to see.\n\nSo we get there.  There is about a 30 minute wait.  With two restless kids this is tough.  When we finally get seated... half the restaurant is empty!!!  Why the wait?  They were short-staffed, and the kitchen was backed up.  After ordering, food was up after about another 30 minutes.\n\nThe food was actually pretty good.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which was excellent.  The fries also good.  Kids meals were decent.  We also ordered some kind of avocado burger which was also pretty good.\n\nThe prices though were crazy.  I'm not sure if it was because it was located on the strip, or if it was just because it is a Rainforest Cafe.  The decor is neat... for the first 10 minutes, then it feels mundane.  Between the prices, the wait time, the location... I think I will pass the next time.  There are easier and more convenient places to eat."

The old location was inside of the MGM. Now I guess I can say I have been to both. \n\nHere's the deal. I have been to the old rainforest cafe in Vegas and the locations in Atlantic city,FL and NYC. There all pretty solid. I recommend bringing kids here. The ambiance is truly what you are paying for. The kids will love it. We had no children with our group. Just big children lol. \n\nThe staff was very nice and accommodating. The service did take a bit. But there was a miss hap on our part with the ordering and a few people drank too much at the pool. So there was some confusing moments. Luckily there was a fish tank and one of my friends spent 15 mins starring at the fish. Kinda saved the evening. \n\nThe food is just like chain style food. Chicken dishes burgers. The appetizers are where it is at in my opinion. I just ordered a chicken quesadilla. It was good. The drinks are funky and different a lot of tropical themed drinks. Hence the name lol. I do think the food is good but pricy for what you receive. \n\nThe mistake we made was ordering a lot of drinks here. The drinks were expensive. Between the 12 of us. Food and drinks. It was just over $100 a person. It's not bad. But for $100 a person I would have rather done a pre fix dinner at a staleskhouse or a higher end eatery. And have drinks there. But your really paying for the experience and atmosphere here. \n\nOverall. This rainforest cafe is nice no complaints really. The food is always consistent. The drinks are a bit pricy. But the new location has a nice view of the strip. I prob will be back"

While the menu has been paired back over the years and some favorites are gone, we like the atmosphere. The MGM location was second only to Chicago for me, this new location is sparse and almost desolate and too small. On with the food. \n\nI had the Pastalaya with Caribbean Rice and my wife had a BBQ chicken breast with mushrooms and melted cheese. \n\nThe Pastalaya was very good even though the spicy Creole sauce was a little too thick. The andouille sausage was spicy, the chicken and shrimp were tender. \n\nMy wife's chicken was tender. The topping was a good with the melted slice of cheese. \n\nAll in all, it was what we expected. Too bad that the restaurants at many of the Landry spots have become predictable, less interesting and more formulaic....chicken, ribs, burgers, shrimp, steaks, etc. Change the name and the menus are 90% overlap. Good, basic fare but being back the inspiration which gave us the Rasta Pasta and other signature dishes at the other Landry's places before Landry's bought them."

Jimmy was our server along with (I think his name is) Alex. He looks kind of like a thinner, taller Josh Hutcherson. Either way. Both of them were AMAZING servers. Jimmy put his \"salesman routine\" on a bit thick and it got kind of annoying at times. Especially because, as I was walking by a door I heard him say \"I do it for the sales...\" Lol. \n\nBut anyways. Aside from the great service, the food was pretty good too! I had a big chicken and fruit salad and more than a few drinks. Everything was awesome. The environment was great and we love all of the animatronics. We've loved coming here since we were kids. I do miss the old place though. It was probably too big for the amount of business they normally have. Either way. Love it."

She was very kind, just not on top of service. Our food took about 40 minutes, and there were only two other people in the whole place. I got Chicken Parmesan, which was just okay. & my boyfriend got a sizzling plater with ribs and some other meat, which he said the ribs were good, however he didn't eat any of the other meat because it was salty.

When you walk in, it feels super crowded with all the gift shop items. There's not a clear sign on how to get to the restaurant. Walking up those stairs feels a bit tight.\n\nTwo in my party ordered burgers. The meat was dried out and overcooked. The buns also tasted like they sat under a heat lamp for way too long.

Most likely because no one knows it m over and it's possibly the hardest place to locate. I think the holy grail would be easier to find bits outside on the very end on Harmon and lvblvd. At street level it's hard to find.  \n\nOnce you find the place assuming you ever do its rain forest just in a smaller package. Staff are friendly and inviting. \n\nWe were seated pretty quick due to the lack of customers. We got our drink orders and food orders pretty quick. Food was \"ok\" my kids got the pizza which they ate all of. I got the awesome sampler it was more like ok sampler but wasn't bad but at 18.99 I expected more. My wife got the rasta pasta again 18.99 We expect more, my dad got the flat iron steak combo. He says the ship was great had to send the steak back because it was rare and he wanted medium, then he got it back they took is sauce. \n\nI do have to point out the staff was really great and friendly, everyone that passed us enter acted with our boys which is awesome. The manager came out she was fantastic. \n\nI would recommend trying it out but I think they need to drop the prices a bit.  It's not Disneyland so you can't charge these prices."

I couldn't believe her. Then led us to a table with a highchair and when I removed it myself, as we didn't need it, there was so much trash and a fork under and I commented on it and all she did was laugh. After convincing our friends how awesome this place was I was instantly embarrassed. Our server was nice enough. My friend split a drink and he brought a new one, but some of my friends didn't like that he didn't even try to help with the mess just dropped napkins. It just seemed like nobody cared much.

Don't expect cheap food when visiting any rainforest cafe- you pay for the entire experience! the food was good, but the overall dining experience was amazing. Our server  (his name is Alex ) was very professional and friendly, but what stood out the most were the AMAZING views over the strip from the outside patio!"

I was told they could not do a substitutuion fro this meal. So, I ordered the double cooked chicken with the rice. What a HORRIBLE meal! The chicken had absolutely no flavor, none. No salt, no pepper. The gravey they give you had some taste but not enough to help. The mashed potatoes were ok, but they needed some flavor. They were, esentially plain potatoes. The rice was the worst! Not cooked well, very under done and the beans were also not cooked well making the dish gummy, BLECH!\n\nI asked the server for a to go box, figuring I would try to make it paletable in my room, then got up to go to the ladies room. When I came back my table had been cleaned! The server looked at me with this look of horror on his face. He ran to get the manager and I explained to her what had happened with this meal. She told me I certainly could have gotten the veggies with the fish and she was sorry for the bad experience. She offered to make me another meal, but there was no way I was going to eat it. She did put the meal on the house, which I appreciated."

            "review": "I decided to bring my family here figuring it would be a good place for the kids to be nicely distracted so my husband and I can eat in peace for once. Big mistake....Here I go....First thing that rubbed me wrong....we made it clear we wanted our sour cream with our appetizer....our server forgets the sour cream. He finally realizes and runs to grab it AFTER we had already finished our appetizer where the sour cream was needed. Then the server says he had to go get the sour cream separately as that was the only way he can do it without charging us.  Did he really think we would care about being charged extra for sour cream or was he just saying that because he forgot? We all make mistakes, own up man. Say u forgot, if u did, who cares. That was Strike 1. The  manager comes by and asks us how we were doing ...I say great. We are not one to complain. Whatever no big deal. After a few minutes the runner drops off our burgers and fries and we noticed they didn't have ketchup on the table. Wth. So we patiently waited for our server to return so we can ask for ketchup.....he didn't return and our burger and fries were getting cold so I made my husband walk to their service well and ask for a bottle of ketchup. That was Strike 2. The server finally returns....\"how's everything?\" Great I reply as I think to myself \"It's ok...no big deal let's keep the kids happy and make this a happy family dinner\".  30 minutes pass, we finish our meal and server comes by and yadda yadda ask if we want dessert whatever. No thanks just the check please. As we wait for our check, my 2 year old son chokes on a tortilla chip and started coughing and coughing and then vomits on himself. Sigh. We don't have any napkins so I once again  tell my husband and daughter to run and ask someone for some napkins so I can clean up my son and the mess. While my son sits there in his own puke my husband and daughter comes back empty handed with no napkins as they were told they will send someone out to clean for us. Strike 3. I tell my daughter to just grab the damn napkins off the empty set up tables next to us. I wiped and cleaned up the seats and table and my son. Our bill never came. By this time I'm livid. A porter finally arrived with a huge dish bucket and asked What needed to be cleaned. LMFAO I CLEANED IT UP ALREADY???? We get up to leave, as we weren't going to wait anymore. The server was still MIA with our bill. We go to the front host and ask if they can pull up our bill so we can pay as we were livid and leaving!!! They ask what's wrong ? Who's our server. Yadda yadda. Whatever. The same manager comes out and asks what's wrong...ha! What difference does it make??? I told the manager...how I don't like to complain as I'm in the same industry but this was just plain ridiculous. She made it a point to say she did ask us how we were doing before and I should of said something if I was not happy. Lol!!!!! She asked us the first 15 minutes we were there. She wasn't there for any of the other problems we had. Our server wasn't a bad guy. I'm sure he tried his best. Assuming he was busy was why he couldn't get back to us when he was needed. Ok. If we have to run around and ask for shit....then that's just plain silly. If my kid choked and threw up we shouldn't have to sit and wait for help. We should of immediately been helped. Napkins rags whatever. The server finally met us at the host desk and gave us our bill and we felt bad for him to have to see us angry and talking to a manager. I did thank him for his service but I'm still aggravated I had to wait for him for literally everything. It shouldn't have to be like that and if he has too many tables than he can handle then he needs to let them know as customer service is sacrificed when you can't be there to help us. It was not pretty and I was not happy in the end. We could of just walked out on our bill and no one would of even known. That's the crazy part. I loved the atmosphere and my son was wide eyed amazed at all the animals everywhere and had fun but that was the end of it. I won't be going back."

It's not a romantic place to bring a date unless she's into animals roaring every now and then and kids running around.\n\nThis new location next to Planet Hollywood seems smaller than their old location at the MGM but still as cool(according to my daughter). Food wise, it's to be expected, nothing special and expensive. Although, the two people in the group who ordered salads were pretty impressed with their food. I had the clam chowder and it was not bad. There was not much in my tiny bowl, a little salty but at least there were clams in there. The kids enjoyed their food and had a lot of fun.\n\nOur server was awesome too. He was pretty busy but very accommodating. If it was not too cold, it would have been nice to sit in their patio/balcony, overlooking the strip.\n\nHere's a tip for those who are planning to go there....DO NOT park at Planet Hollywood and go through Miracle Mile. It's a looooooong walk. Park at Cosmopolitan and take the bridge or pay $5 at the parking lot across the street and take the bridge.\n\nFood and price - 3*\nFun factor for kids - 5*\nService   - 5*"

We were seated fairly quickly because nobody was there and that was the end of something that could have been great. It was about 8 when we went and it felt as if it was 90 degrees inside. I ordered a drink, and they put way too much mint in it I was literally drinking mint with every sip. Server took it back and I just asked for water. Server, don't remember his name, he was very quiet and didn't give us the service I've been given at other locations. He didn't check on us after serving the food. \n\nThe food, salty. I got the chicken fried chicken as I always do, and it was just so salty. My boyfriend got some seafood and it immediately made him run to the restroom. My boyfriend also knocked down his drink by accident and I told another server, since mine was nowhere to find, and it took them literally 20 minutes to help us wipe it down. \n\nNever again, very disappointed."

I like taking my family of son and spouse and daughter and spouse and their almost 2 year old daughter and 6 month old son.

(We called ahead of time)  Party of 11.  We all were very comfortable and not crowded.\n\nLets be clear.  If you want gourmet food, this isn't the place.  I do have to admit, that we all really enjoyed our meals very much.  The food came out pretty much in a timely fashion with appetizers first, followed by entrees.  I was prepared to get a bite when I got home, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Coconut shrimp . .yum.  Haven't been to a Rainforest in years, and was most pleased with this visit.\n\nA lot of the success of our visit was our server, Andre.  Very efficient and wasn't rattled by seprate checks and out inability to get it together in the beginning to even get a drink order together, much less the rest.  He also was very personable, professional and helped with our positive experience.  His \"helpers\"  were also spot on.\n\nThe best part?  Granddaughter, Saturn, loved the animals and atmosphere and especially going crazy at our table every time there was a lightning storm.  She would scream and squeal and flail her arms around amidst huge grins.  Thanks to the storm, no one was bothered by her and my exuberance.  So much fun.  We will be back and will not fear the food and service as other yelpers have warned.  All 11 of us had a great experience."

I had never been to one, and they were paying, so off we went.\n\nThe Vegas location used to be in the MGM, and now it is hidden away in an offshoot mall near Planet Hollywood. There wasn't much foot traffic, and we got a seat right away.\n\nFirst off, it reminded me of Denver's Casa Bonita--but not in a good way. Lots of small rooms with fake jungle greenery and mechanical animals blaring away in the background. Too bad there were no waterfalls or cliff divers to take our minds off the food.\n\nI'm not a food snob, but my meal was WAY overcooked. I had the Parilla Yucatan plate off their seasonal menu: bacon-wrapped shrimp, grilled chicken topped with cheese, and mahi mahi topped with mango salsa. The seasoning was great, but the proteins were as tough as burlap. Nowhere near worth the $22 price tag.\n\nMy friends ordered mozzarella sticks, a cup of clam chowder, fried shrimp, and the jungle steak and shrimp. They seemed pretty pleased, but the food looked pretty pedestrian to me. And even though we didn't have any alcoholic drinks, the meal was over $100.\n\nThey are tourists. It's a tourist trap. And they were happy, so I'm glad for them. But with so many other great restaurants in Vegas, I know I will never be back. And I'll try to steer my other visiting friends away as well--unless they have a hankering for animatronic apes and overpriced food!"

I mentioned we had a birthday when they took our name down. So then we get seated and notice there are many tables open in the area they sat us. (Huh took an hour to seat us with this many tables) Then about 15 minutes goes by as we watch 4 others big tables get sat down and a server comes and asks for our drink order and tells us she is helping out our server for a moment because she was pregnant and needed to us the restroom. Ok...... didn't even bother to walk around our table to take our order kinda yells from the end of the table what did each of us want. Ok now we wait for our drinks to come, mind you that took almost another 15-20 minutes. Not even together almost one drink at a time. We order an app to Start with, the app comes out and takes another 5 minutes to get us side plates. Then our server comes to the table to take our order and does nothing but complain how she's pregnant and that she might need to leave to the doctor. Now we sit for almost an hour before we get our entrees, in the meantime our server has not been seen nor has anyone come by our table to take our dirty app plates or ask if we needed any refills on our drinks. We finally get the servers attention to get refills on drinks and she doesn't even take the dirty plates from our table. Dinner has finally gotten to the table(now that it's been over 2 hours that we have been in this place) my sister order a burger and it was so dry and tasted like dirt, my mom ordered fish and chips she could almost knock on the table with the fish....my nephew got kids shrimp and Idk what to say about that it was just bad. The whole dinner was ridiculous. Some other waiter comes to the table to ask if we needed anything in which we tell him about the burger and the fish. He brings the Manger Cathy over to the table and she says that she will take it off of our bill. Now this whole time our server never once came back to see if everything was ok nor did she ever mention her name. Now in the beginning I mentioned we had a birthday.....yea what wtf for???? They went and sang to many other tables but never our! Biggest disappointment ever. It  was as if Cathy the Manger didn't even care that our experience was bad. From the wait time to be seated to the wait for someone to take our drink order from the time they took our order to getting our food to the horrible food that came to our table.

Not sure if Rain forest cafe is low on lemons, I mean they charge a lot of $$$ for a meal you would think they could afford to spare a few extra pieces.  Any way as I said our waiter was MIA for the whole meal EXCEPT when he was trying to push this Member's Card on us, all of a sudden he became waiter of the year.  We said no and yup you guesses it...

Food was horrible. Service, meh and we waited forever for our food that I was sorely disappointed in. Our appetizer and meal came out at the same time and the kids meals came last. Completely in the opposite order that our server told us he'd bring it out to us. My kids didn't even like their food and they ordered pizza and the macncheese. What kid doesn't like any kind of pizza that set in front of them?! It's because it was THAT gross. If you find that you really still want to go there, just take a walk through the place and then Go eat at Chilis just down the way. (Because let's be honest, I wish I would have just done that!) You WILL thank me for it! I really only want to give it a 1/2 a star and that's just for the atmosphere, everything else was barf. Yep, I said it. Barf."

The first visit was about three weeks ago and I left telling my friends that it was the best burger I have had in a long time! I had been raving about it so much that they wanted to try it out tonight! I ordered the exact same thing as I did last time, but it was awful! They forgot the onion ring in the burger, they put the mushrooms that were supposed to be within the burger on the side and the meat had no taste! I wish I would have received that burger on my first visit to save me from having to return. Would not recommend."

I'd call it chain food garbage generic burgers sandwiches and pizza.  Ok cool they got some waterfalls and animatronic wildlife.  Maybe it's great for kids but I don't bring my kids to Las Vegas."

            "review": "Having been to the Rainforest Cafe, when it was at the MGM grand in Vegas, I was very excited to eat at this restaurant again with my boyfriend and its new location at the Planet Hollywood hotel and casino, however our dining experience was horrible. We got seated out on the balcony, overlooking the strip and a server came over with whom we ordered our drinks. We then got our drinks 15 minutes later which we tried to remain patient over. Thinking that it was a simple mistake of the staff running behind we then ordered our food and waited nearly an entire hour before getting it. I couldn't believe the wait for our food was so long since it was 9:30 at night and the restaurant was not even busy. During this time that we were waiting multiple servers walked by us without ever asking if we needed refills on the drinks that were brought nearly 40 minutes before. We were both getting really hungry and eventually had to pull a server aside (no one was checking on our table) to ask how much longer it would be. We were informed that someone had dropped a plate of food and therefore we would have to wait longer for it to be remade. I understand mistakes happen but, we weren't even told this until around 40 minutes of waiting. As more time went by we felt like we were, quite frankly, forgotten. With the restaurant not being anywhere close to full this made no sense to us. About 15 minutes later we FINALLY got our food which was cold. It was disappointing to us because we had waited so long for our food and because the entrees at this restaurant are not inexpensive. As soon as our plates were placed on the table the server said, \"okay, enjoy\". This would've been fine but, we hadn't even been brought napkins and silverware. Since we didn't see any server in sight we had to get up and get silverware for ourselves. We had issues then getting our check and to-go boxes. The entire experience was extremely disappointing because I know the Rainforest Cafe is able to deliver good service, from their previous location but, this was anything but good service. I don't think we'll be returning to the Rainforest Cafe anytime soon."
