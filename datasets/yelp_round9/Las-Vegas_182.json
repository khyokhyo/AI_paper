            "review": "You had me at RED. VELVET. PANCAKES (although here they call them \"babystacks.\") I'm so in love with them my heart is breaking from being apart. I've always liked red velvet cupcakes/cakes, but cluelessly had never thought of it being made into different forms of carb goodness. \n\nBaby Stacks is a normal looking breakfast joint in a normal looking shopping mall, but what lurks inside is NOT normal. The food here has a bit of a Hawaiian influence that results in an AWESOME party in your mouth ;) \n\nWe each ordered from the \"Breakfast Favorites.\" The hub had the \"bacon and eggs\" and chose hash browns and buttermilk babystacks. I had their \"Portuguese sausage and eggs\" and chose rice and their specialty RED. VELVET. BABYSTACKS. The hub said his breakfast was good, but you can get what he ordered anywhere else that serves breakfast. My order on the other hand was absolutely FANTASTIC! There's no way to describe the joy and utter elation I felt when those red velvet cakes hit my tongue *cue foodgasm noise.* Done deal, 5 stars! As soon as those stacks hit the table I pounced and I pounced hard! Oh man, I can't wait to have them again. They're perfectly done and when you add the cream cheese icing/syrup with the gorgeously whipped cream, it's utter food heaven. \n\nSo, what have we learned? Don't come here for a \"normal\" breakfast and get here fast because this place fills up quick! And please, please don't say I didn't warn you when you fall in love at first bite ;)"

            "review": "we had a party of 10 but 2 of them were meeting up with us there. The wait for that size group on that Sunday morning was 30 minutes. since it was plenty of time for our 2 stragglers to show up before then we put in our name for a table, but those 2 were running a little late. We were brought in and seated and the man hosting who sat us at a table kept asking where the rest of our party was, we insisted they would be arriving shortly. But he kept nagging us about them and spoke to is VERY rudely and with bad attitude and a facial expression to match said to us \"You better not get me in trouble\" and he walked away. Ewe, he disgusted me and his behavior made me lose my appetite. Even my sister said she'd be happy to walk out of he was going to be a dick about it & Baby Stack's Cafe would lose out on good business and since it was our first time we could have been potential regulars. Instead we called the pair and asked them not to show up because the. Man hosting couldn't wait another 5 minutes before acting like an asshole towards us. \n\nOur sever (I wish I heard her name) was super sweet. She was so nice with such a pleasant attitude and very accommodating.  \n\nThe food was yummy, good enough to redeem the poor behavior we had endured from the douche of a host, but still I wish we didn't have to encounter that man before trying to enjoy a nice Sunday breakfast with my family and our blessing babies and toddlers. \n\nI ordered the honey French toast but it didn't come with anything g other than the two slices of toast so I had to order a side of breakfast potatoes. The French toast was great, I appreciate non-soggy toast since I'm extremely picky of food textures. I also decided I wanted to try the sweet cream crepe and it wasn't anything special, still tasty, but maybe if I had order extra topping for an extra charge I might had been more impressed. \n\nA couple people in our party tried the red velvet pancakes and swear it was the most delicious pancakes they have ever tried, it was so good they had a hard time trying to explain to me just how great it was, all they could say was \"it was amazing\"."

Brother and I ordered red velvet pancakes, Portuguese sausage, scramble eggs, hash brown (extra crispy), and cinnabun pancakes.\n\nRed velvet was perfect: not too thick on the flavor and not too light, fluffy in the middle. Comes with icing and whipped butter which complemented perfectly. Highly recommend.\n\nCinnabun pancakes were very sweet and tasted like a donut. If you like sweet pancakes, this is your pancake.\n\nPortuguese sausage were on point: nice flavor and goes well with eggs and hash brown. Highly recommend.\n\nOverall great place and will come back!"

            "review": "I came here ready to stuff my face with the glories of awesomeness. Yeah, I think I went a bit overboard, but it's okay. I can always start dieting tomorrow. \n\nRed velvet pancakes- 5 stars. I still drool thinking about this pancake, because it's like eating cake but in pancake form. The texture is more like a muffin cake rather than a chewy pancake, but it's SOOO GOOOOOOOOOOD. For a sweet tooth like myself, this is heavenly. \n\nAdobo fried rice omelet - 4 stars. The flavoring inside with the rice and adobo is good. I think it could have been a bit saltier, and I think I'd enjoy it more as a fried rice rather than in an omelet since the egg outside dilutes the saltiness inside, making it a bit bland for my taste. I was confused if I'm supposed to put ketchup outside and eat it or should it have been tonkatsu sauce? Maybe that would be more genius. \n\nSide of portugese sausage- 4 stars. Who don't like sausage? OINK OINK. My belly does. I'm no Portuguese sausage connoisseur, but I love a fatty polska kielbasa and this sausage did the job. \n\nSome healthy bacon and all kinds of stuff omelet with avocado on top- 4 stars. I never order omelets at restaurants, because I can make a pretty legit version in my own kitchen. SO, I don't know what to say and how to rate this omelet. It was good, but not something I'd order. \n\nI'm coming back for VELVET PANCAKES!!! WOOOOOO!\n\nService- 7/5 stars. It's off the charts. I can't even believe how fast my water was filled at quarter point every time. The dude was working real hard and he deserves major credit for it. Stellar service for sure from start to beginning."

Prices are reasonable, although portions could be bigger.   Service is fast and friendly.\n\nRed velvet pancakes.  Fluffy and thick with that delicious cake flavor you would hope to have.\n\nPortuguese sausage with eggs. \nI was able to get the garlic fried rice with my sausage and eggs.  It was just white rice with very  little flavor."

            "review": "A couple of my friends and I were headed to Dennys on the strip when our Uber driver suggested Baby Stacks. I honestly thought it was closer to the strip but it was worth the $14 Uber.\n\nOur server Jonathan was very attentive and friendly with a sense of humor so that was a plus. I ordered the banana pancakes (forgive me I'm not really much of a risk taker when it comes to pancakes) with turkey sausage and eggs with, get this, pepper jack cheese. I was surprised they even had pepper jack cheese so thats another bonus in my book :) I dont't know if my friends and I were just super hungry or they really were taking awhile but the food eventually came to the table. \n\nIm from Los Angeles and here we have a small restaurant chain called Pann's were the pancakes are just YUM! After visiting Baby Stacks I feel they need a new recipe lol. The turkey sausage was good along with the eggs. Although I'm not a huge egg fan i felt they could have shown a little more love (given me more eggs) for my side.\n\nAll in all my friends and I really enjoyed our breakfast. Next time I visit Vegas i will definitely return for breakfast."

They keep their music at a very acceptable level.\nWe tried the Red Velvet  with cream cheese syrup stack and the banana stack. Both were excellent.

I didn't realize at the time that there was another location or that the street address was the same. Anyway, I visited this location on 04/13/2013 and it was just as great as my previous experience!\n\nBetween three of us, we ordered the BANANA CREAM PIE PANCAKES (Bananas in buttermilk batter, topped with fresh whipped cream, sliced bananas, drizzled banana cream sauce, and topped with crushed pie crust and almonds), SPAM AND EGGS BREAKFAST WITH GARLIC RICE, KALUA PIG BENEDICT (toasted English muffin layered with our slow-cooked shredded cabbage and smoke-flavored pork, then topped with poached medium eggs and hollandaise sauce) with seasoned potatoes, and MEXICAN OMELETTE (marinated carnitas, sliced jalape\u00f1os, fresh pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese and topped off with sour cream) with hash brown.\n\nEverything was soooo yummy! And I LOVE finding places that make me feel like I'm back home (in Hawaii) eating breakfast at my favorite local spot! Very well done. I love the ingenuity and execution of the different exquisite pancakes as well. I can't wait to try another flavor!"

My potatoes were a tad bland but after sampling everyone else's breakfasts I can say everything else was delish!

Unfortunately they did not live up to all the hype, we were both expecting red velvet pancakes but got pancakes with food coloring we were pretty disappointed. The pancakes were not fluffy goodness but yet a weird texture not to tasty and the \"cream cheese syrup\"  tasted like that frosting you would put on those cinnamon rolls you get at the grocery store. \n\nNow on the flip side I ordered the Huntington omelet which had cheddar cheese, bacon and avocado which came with your choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes i got the \"seasoned potatoes\" which were not seasoned one bit and i also got an english muffin which was good but how can you mess that up. The omelet was pretty tasty how can you go wrong with cheese bacon and avocado , nothing that great but it was good. \n\nOverall it was an ok experience I was pretty disappointed I expected it to be way better because of all the reviews on yelp. I probably wont return here because there are better breakfast places out there."

I wasn't in the mood for super sweet so I went more traditional breakfast with blueberry pancakes, eggs, bacon and potatoes.\n\nPancakes were too heavy on the blueberries for my liking... can I have some pancake with my blueberries? The potatoes were very boring with little to no seasoning or flavor. I would think they would mix some more in there.. where's the chopped peppers and onions or something?? The eggs were eggs and the bacon was bacon.\n\nSome of the other dishes I saw come out looked pretty good so I'll have to come back and try it. Maybe the red velvet pancakes are that good that I'm an idiot for not ordering them.\n\nService was fair from what I remember and I was happy that it didn't take as long to get seated as they quoted us.

I do have to admit that I have tried other better similar concoctions (i.e. red velvet waffles at Larchmont in LA and red velvet pancakes at the Grand Lux in the Venetian), but I was first introduced to these here at BabyStacks... so I have fond memories of this item!\n\nCookies n Cream Pancakes // I tried these babies for the first time today.  So good! I'm an Oreo lover, so I'm surprised I haven't tried these. I would definitely go for these rather than the Red Velvet from now on. I haven't seen these anywhere else before!\n\nBiscuit & Gravy, Loco Moco, and Kalua Pork Benedict are some of the other items I've tried. Honestly, I wouldn't order any of those items again.\n\nThe pancake selection is awesome, but the pancakes themselves could use a little more fluffy... Still, a must-visit when in Vegas!"

It will change your view of Loco Moco forever! Go with the garlic rice, too. A must!\n\n**Kalua Pork Benedicts-Disappointed! The flavors didn't work well together and it was so bland. I only had a few bites and gave up...I was tremendously unsatisfied that I had to order another Loco Moco to fill in that void!  \n\n**Red Velvet Pancakes-BOMB! It's better to eat this fresh so if you plan to eat this for dessert like me, order the pancakes when you're halfway through your savory dish. The cream cheese syrup is just amazing and not too sweet! Try not to add too much of the whipped cream in each bite so you can really enjoy the flavors of the pancake. For me, the short stack is just the perfect portion. \n\n**Lemon Ricotta Pancakes-Just wonderful! It's light, fluffy, and simply refreshing. The citrus flavor of the lemon is really enhanced with the cream cheese syrup. There's no short stack option for this so plan to share because it's huge. \n\n**Portuguese sausage sliders-Not impressed. Hawaiian rolls with Portuguese sausage and eggs scrambled with green onions. It's good but it's something you can make yourself at home..maybe better! \n\nServers here were so attentive and friendly. We came here for Mother's Day brunch so it was really busy. That didn't stop them from giving us good service. Will definitely be back!!"

Babystacks is a good option if you have a car and want to get away from the Strip for a second.\n\nI came here after one such night in Vegas last month, and a delicious fusion brunch was exactly what I needed.  The wait for our party of five wasn't too long, only about 20 minutes or so (compared to our epic wait the night before at Bachannal, this was easy peasy).  \n\nI ordered the adobo fried rice, which comes out wrapped in an omelette.  The dish normally comes out with macaroni salad, but they let me change it out for the breakfast potatoes.  I liked the fried rice, but honestly I thought the entire dish was a little dry.  The breakfast potatoes were lightly fried and cubed, so it was hard to go wrong with these.  \n\nSince there were a few of us, I was lucky to try some other things too.  The loco moco was amazing, hands-down the best dish we had at the table.  The sauce was on point and the beef was so good, especially for the hungover.  The Kalua pig benedict was good, although not super impressive.  While everyone at the table raved about the white chocolate macadamia nut and red velvet pancakes, I personally thought they were both a bit dry.  Of course, you can dunk the red velvet in the cream cheese dressing on the side, but that's just a bit too sweet for me.  Maybe it's because I'm not really a sweet tooth, but I'd come back for the loco moco.\n\nService:  Pleasant and friendly.  Ma-and-pa local run kind of place.\n\nBottom line:  You know those dishes where you try a bite of your friend's and you wish you had ordered that dish?  Loco moco.  No regrets.  And if you have a sweet tooth, try the red velvet or one of the other pancakes."

You can get your usual items, like omelets, eggs, bacon and sausage, but you can also get a variety of pancakes.  There are plain old fashion cakes, and then there are the \"gourmet\" cakes as I call them.  \n\nI think that BabyStacks  was the first place I heard of that took flavors like red velvet and smores and made them into a pancake.

The wait was not long enough :P as we didn't even get to finish our argument about what science experiments I could keep in the house :) and the food was delicious and abundant. I had the 2 egg plate (scrambled with just egg whites), hash-browns and a short stack of Carrot (pan)Cakes. They were flipping fantastic, especially with some hot sauce (which they brought without me asking, before my meal arrived). My guest ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes which only come in one size (fits all) and I tried some of it and we both agreed they were a triumph of breakfast food. The service was attentive and positive the whole time; except that they didn't bring us our check once it was obvious that we had finished our meals, which I've heard is polite but I prefer efficiency in my dining experience :P"

My boyfriend got the pig blanket omelette (not sure if name is correct) with hash browns and upgraded his stack to a special stack they called \"orange dream\". Now I'm not a rookie when it comes to Portuguese sausage so I must say that these were pretty good. Juicy, crispy on the edge but not overcooked. The eggs were eggs. Nothing extraordinary but still good. Now the breakfast potatoes, bland with no seasoning not even salt. They did come out hot so I'm sure I could've sprinkled salt on them but I didn't. Ketchup did just fine but I'm pretty sure I'll be getting the hash browns next time around. The red velvet pancakes actually tasted like red velvet and they were good. I remember my first visit when they were called babycakes and their red velvet pancakes were bleh. The kitchen must have finally perfected the recipe because they definitely are worth going back for. Now, as for my boyfriend I can't say that I tried his omelette but I can say he finished it all, so that must be a good sign. His orange dream pancakes...OMG they are to die for. Anyone who reads this, please do yourself a favor and stop by for an orange dream stack."

Definitely did not expect that. Load it up with a bunch of Cholula or Tapatio sauce (it's not the same with Sriracha), and I could eat this multiple times a week. The egg was fluffy and the rice and chicken had great flavor, but adding the sauces totally takes it up a notch. \n\nAnd I couldn't pass up on the famous Red Velvet Pancakes, so I ordered a small stack as well. It was extremely fluffy, and tasted similar to Red Velvet... but not quite there. The cream cheese sauce definitely made this pancake one of the best pancakes ever. It provides a different kind of sweetness, and you don't need too much whereas with pancakes from Ihop, I generally have to smother it in syrup. \n\nI hear there can be a long wait sometimes; I was lucky enough to have gone on a weekday during lunch and waited only for a table to get cleaned up.

The menu is incredible, with many very interesting crepes, pancakes, burritos, omelets, and even sandwiches.

It had cinnamon, cake crust crumbles, and Nutella drizzle all in one breakfast dish. YUM! If I had eaten the whole thing by myself, I would have gone into sugar shock. But it would have been worth it. Best French toast ever! By comparison, the pancakes were a disappointment. Yes, it had Nutella on top. It also had a huge mound of whipped cream. Even with the Nutella and the whipped cream, the pancakes were somewhat disappointing. Maybe if we didn't have the French toast to compare it to, it would have seemed better. My daughter had the breakfast burrito with a side of two chocolate chip peanut butter pancakes. She loved the whole thing. All of this delicious but decadent eating and no dish was over $10.

I did not sample the avocado sandmich so I can't comment on it. Let's get to the pancakes. I did sample the homie's banana cream pancakes. I had one bite. It was    AIGHT. Now to their Red Velvet Pancakes. \"OH SHIT! LOOK AT THE MOTHAPHO'KIN WHEELS!!!\" I finally get to try these things. It came with cream cheese syrup and topped with whipped cream. Hmmm? Where's the syrup? I can't eat this without... I go ahead and take a bite. DAMN SUN!?! I tell Camille's uncle to try the pancakes. Both of us were instant fans. Needless to say, all of my plates were cleaned off. \n\nMy brunch started off good with a solid steak and eggs and ended off great with DEM RED VELVET PANCAKES SUN!!!\n\nBabyStacks...EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"

My boyfriend's cousin spoke very highly of this place, so we had to give this place a try, especially since he told us that some of the dishes are Filipino inspired.\n\nSince there were a lot of us, we all tried to order something different so we could try each other's food if we wanted. The food here is AMAZING!!! The red velvet pancakes are a piece of heaven on a plate and the Portuguese sausages are delightful as well. They also have delicious garlic fried rice, which is basically a comfort food if you are Filipino. It honestly gave me my rice fix since I was having withdrawals on this trip. For bacon lovers, like my boyfriend, there are bacon pancakes that are mouthwatering. My sister's fianc\u00e9e had Rick's Adobo Rice dish, which was very delicious and was large enough for two people. All of the dishes are reasonably priced and they do give you good portion sizes here.\n\nThe service that we had was on point as well. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs and refilled our drinks when she saw that we were running low. A+ in my book\n\nOverall, this place will not disappoint! There are a wide variety of pancake combinations and the other items on the menu are also a wonderful treat. I'm looking forward to dining at this place again in the near future."

            "review": "I've been here a number of times already and I must say that I have been absolutely satisfied each and everytime I have been here. \n\nThe name is BabyStacks Cafe, so you can assume that they specialize in pancakes, and specialize they do! The front page of their menu has a list of different kinds of pancakes they serve. The red velvet is supposedly the most popular, and it is delicious, but my favorite is the cinnabun personally. I personally wouldn't recommend ordering plain pancakes here since they have so many different specialties, but if that's something you like, I don't think that'd be a bad decision either. \n\nI usually order a skillet or omelette with a side of pancakes. It cost more to order specialty pancakes with your omelette or skillet, but you get the best of both worlds that way. I treat the pancakes like a dessert/side dish kind of thing because most of the pancakes are sweet. You get the main dish with eggs, meat, and maybe potatoes and then you have the pancakes on the side that that is just the perfect combination!\n\nOn the weekends, it gets kind of busy, so expect a wait unless you go fairly early and the service can be slow at times, but you can't expect every place to be overstaffed with people waiting to serve you when you come in. They do the best job they can. I remember I came here with many of my family members and we didn't get one of our orders of pancakes and they have us a free short stack of a random specialty pancake. I'm glad they made it up to us for not bringing our order in time because that showed me how much they care about their customer service. \n\nI recommend going here if you want to catch some breakfast or lunch. I personally won't go to any other breakfast specialty place in Vegas while BabyStacks is open for business."

We shared the pancakes which ended or meal as our dessert. \n\nService was good, and it wasn't crazy busy at 9:30am. \n\nFor the 2 of us , the bill was $21+.\n\nWell be back.

The Cafe seems like it's Filipino, ergo Adobo Fried Rice, with American and Hawaiian influence.\n\nRed Velvet Pancakes -- Fluffy red pancakes topped with chocolate chips and whipped cream. It's served with their absolutely delicious cream cheese syrup so you can flavor to taste. Typically, I get the pancakes without whipped cream. IMO, everything is perfectly sweet without it. The cream cheese syrup is to die for. It's a perfect pairing with the semi-sweet red velvet pancakes. \n\nRick's Adobo Fried Rice -- Shredded chicken with rice wrapped inside an egg and green onions. Simply incredible. The saltiness of the chicken was just right. Add some hot sauce (Cholula or Sriracha) to give it a kick. It's a hearty portion but it's so dang good I usually finish most of it in one sitting. It also comes with a side of mac salad. You can hardly taste the mayo. Probably one of my favorite versions of mac salad to date. \n\nService has always been on point. No complaints here!"

So, an updated review was in need. \n\nWhether you're local or visiting, you have to try Babystacks at least once.  My opinion, still one of the best breakfast joints in town.  You can still get your eggs, bacon, and hash browns at BabyStacks.  But let's be honest, it's all about their stacks.  You can't go wrong with most of their pancakes and it's their Red Velvet that they're known for. Other favorites for me include their Portuguese Sausage, Loco Moco (IKR?), Garlic Rice, Biscuits/Gravy, Macadamia Stack, and their Adobo Fried Rice. \n\nRegarding this specific location, I have to say it's the best one to go to if you're looking for less of a wait and a bigger location.  At this location, you're almost seated immediately.  However, I still think the North Buffalo location is better.  Maybe I'm biased, maybe I'm just loyal, but I think the food taste just a tad better at the north location. But please, continue to go the south location so that I don't have to wait as long at the north one. \n\nTIP:  On my most recent visit, I did something that I never do. I got a full stack of their Red Velvet pancakes. A short stack is usually good enough, especially if you're just complimenting a main dish.  I don't believe in wasting food so I cleaned my plate. I don't think I ate for at least another 5 hours after."

The many Hawaiian influenced plates are some of the best, though they are obviously well known for pancakes. I tried the Kalua Benedict with a short stack of banana cream panacakes. Pancakes were lovely and hit the spot. The benedict was tasty, larticularly with the smoked pulled pork. However, my hollandaise had the same typical taste and texture you would find at any cheap breakfast joint (as if it came out of a jar), and the poached eggs were overcooked. The yolk did not run at all which is a sin when serving benedict or even just poached eggs. It showed a lack of detail and commitment to the food they serve. It seems a shame as they clearly have some nice plates and flavors but without the execution you are only just slightly better than an ihop or dennys. My wife's skillet was alright but she didn't finish it. Service was alright but overall the experience wasn't enough to really bring me back."

So many rules everywhere it distracts from the ambiance of a laid back breakfast/lunch caf\u00e9. Anyways. The food looked great that they brought out to everyone else but I guess I ordered the most lackluster dish on the menu, a turkey club and a side salad. It was something I could have made at home and made better at that but it was good. Just nothing even remotely special or unique to their menu. It was literally deli turkey, avocado and a tomato on two slabs of sara lee. I guess next time I give them a try (I am not opposed to trying it again) I will have to order one of the skillets, or pancake creations it seemed like those were served up with a bit more pride and creativity. Service was adequate but nothing that stood out or made me have a positive reaction to the service portion. Just average across the board."

There wasn't anything special to the sandwich when I took a bite so I'm rating this average. \n\nCoffee: 0/5  I was actually disappointed about their coffee, I don't know maybe I was \"expecting\" too much? BUT When I hear \"cafe\" I think of coffee's & espresso's. Yet all they had was regular coffee and black. This place came off to me more like a DINER than a CAFE."

The menu is just the right size with enough diversity to please most everyone, but small enough to ensure high quality with every dish.  \n\nKeep in mind they won't seat partial parties.  The original location on north Buffalo is very small so plan accordingly.  If you love breakfast, definitely give them a try!"

The servers were cordial. Since the hotel food was soooooo expensive it was a welcome relief to see their pricing. \nAs far as the food. We ordered burritos, pancakes and also the Spinach Benedict. I had some of each and loved each item. \nFunny... they don't bring pancake syrup with some of the pancakes. The sauces seem to be enough to dress the pancakes but we asked for syrup anyway. \nIf your in Vegas and want a place to eat breakfast I recommend this place. The menu is extensive."

I believe its a asian/filipino/hawaiian style of food, but they also serve a wide assortment of pancakes. Came in with a couple of friends and the place was pretty busy. I didn't know that this location existed, but we were quickly seated. They have alot of the traditional breakfast fare, but they also have a bunch of hawaiian/asian food options as well.\n\nWe checked out of course what everyone gets: the red velvet pancakes! and the white chocolate macadamia pancakes! These things are more of a dessert rather than a actual dish, pure sugary sweetness. I liked the white chocolate ones but my friends thought they were waaay to sweet. But I think they jus have poor taste. the Red Velvet ones were exactly that, red dyed pancakes, with a interesting cream cheese syrup which sounded out but worked out well. I liked the red velvet, they were good, but I don't think they live up to the immense hype that I heard of.\n\nWe also ordered another dish, I think Huevos Rancheros or something, but it was obviously forgettable. To be honest, the place is my opinion is good, but it's not as amazing as everyone else makes to seem. The red velvet pancakes are good, and I liked the food, but there are much better breakfast places in town. I would return and I am not opposed to eating here, but its not something I am gonna get excited over either."

And they get pretty busy during breakfast or lunch time (only open for breakfast and lunch, for obvious reasons)\n\nBeen here a few times. Various friends and family. So got to try different things. \n\nLike a normal breakfast place, they offer a variety Omelettes, pancakes, etc. They have a slight Hawaiian influence so you'll see things like kalua pork, or bbq pork, or Portuguese sausage on the menu.But the most talked about, and hyped, is their Red Velvet Pancakes. For those who dont know, red velvet is more known for the cake. Bright to dark red cake flavored with cocoa with a cream cheese icing, So essentially, simply a chocolate cake, without the overload of chocolate. \n\nMy first time here, was with one other friend. We had tried the red velvet, as well as the banana cream pancake. Prior to this, i had been very sick of pancakes because one year, my friends and I decided to go around to different iHops on international pancake day, and eat free pancakes.... that killed it for me for a few years. So traditional normal pancakes, definitely a no go for me ! I was eager to try these new pancakes with different flavors though. \n\nAt BabyStacks, they offer their pancakes in full stacks or half stacks, and their pancakes are smaller than the normal ones you see.  Maybe like 4-5\" in diameter vs the plate sized ones. \n\nRed Velvet Pancakes - As said before, its red, but essentially a lighter chocolate pancake with cream cheese icing and whipped cream. Its pretty good. Not what it was hyped up to be (maybe im not much of a dessert person anyway) but its not bad. I still do recommend people who hasn't tried it, to try it. Light chocolatey flavor with a not too heavy cream cheese icing. \n\nBanana Cream Pie Pancake - Traditional pancake with what you'd find in a banana cream pie so sliced bananas, a banana cream, and whipped cream. The first time i tried it, it was surprisingly amazing, Originally being a lover of banana cream pie (to the extent of not being a dessert lover... if that makes sense), this had sparked my interest in pancakes again. \n\nOverall, nice place to go for breakfast. Variety of stuff to order, not only pancakes."

Almost didn't come here if it wasn't for our cousin's advice. \nOf course I love to support local and so coming here was a no brainer. \n\nUpon coming here we did take notice that they are known for their pancakes and their adobo fried rice. We order those in addition to the S'mores pancakes and their breakfast 2 egg special. \n\nThe 2 egg special wasn't too special I thought. The potatoes as well as the toast  look and tasted like something you can get anywhere. \n\nThe adobo fried rice in the egg wrap lacked a bit of salt but was quite good with a touch of hot sauce. Oh yeah, you know this place is Asian owned because they give you some choices of hot sauce in advance before you get your food.  It's tasty but I did wish the fried rice wasn't nearly as soggy. \n\nThe S'mores pancakes are just regular pancakes with marshmallows, choco chips, and regular syrup. It was good but not excellent good. \n\nWe also got the Kalua Pork benedict. The Kalua pork was juicy, smokey, and so good! I did wish the eggs were hotter and more runnier. I am picky about my benedicts but together, they were still really good. \n\nBut the best thing we got undoubtedly was the red velvet pancakes. Slightly crisp on the outside with a dollop of cream and the cream cheese syrup on top. The syrup DOES make the pancakes come alive!\n\nBy the bathroom, it shows how the owner wanted to make cupcake flavors into pancakes. I have to say, she did a wonderful job transforming it. Babystacks are regarded as one of 50 US must try pancake locations. I totally would agree with this statement. They have locations in San Diego and Las Vegas. \n\nI thought the service was great overall. I did wish the hostess was friendlier and more outgoing. She seemed like she had a bad day and it was only morning.\n\nSo great breakfast choice when you don't wan to eat in a casino when coming here to Vegas as a tourist. Just make sure you come early because there will be a wait here!"

We barely spoke to each other because it was that good. I don't know why we thought we can order a stack of pancakes to share because both of these dishes were overwhelming. The BF usually can eat up a storm but he even had to take half of it home. If you came to eat then this is the dish for you. I had the Kalua Pig Omlette and the pork was cooked perfectly.

Felt ripped off at nearly $9.00 for three sliders which was basically EGGS.  Brought it to the waitress attention.  Guess customer service is not a priority either.  Rather than make it right she blew it off like it was nothing.  The least she could have done was to bring extra sausage.  This is how you lose customers.  By cutting corners and lack of service."

Bananas, whipped creme, drizzle of some kind of brown stuff on top..yummy!   But taking one bite, I was confused.  The toppings and the pancake didn't work together and the pancake definitely lacked a punch.  I've had great banana pancakes (Bruddah's in Gardena, CA) but these were kind of disappointing.\n\nBlueberry pancakes - same batter as the other pancakes with some blueberries pushed inside and topped with fresh blueberries as well.  Kid will devour anything with blueberries so she like them but once again, the pancake doesn't deliver.  (Stacks in Dana Point, CA - now thats a blueberry pancake!)\n\nChili skillet - this was very tasty but I wish it had more chili.  One more scoop of that delicious chili would have made me much happier.  I wish the potatoes were swimming in that stuff!  Combine that with a sunny side egg... ono.\n\nCornbeef hash - this was ok.  Just a plain ground cornbeef hash patty with rice and eggs.  Not too spicy but could have been burned just a little bit longer on the skillet.\n\nService was good and seating was faster than quoted.  Also noticed the tables were promptly cleaned after someone leaves.  Kind of far but its a decent alternative to an expensive weekend brunch on the strip."

Pancakes are not hard to make but the creativity that baby stacks has come up with forced me to order them, lol!\n\nWe had the velvet pancakes, banana cream pie pancakes and the corned beef hash.  \n\nred velvet pancakes: they were good, not spectacular like most people here say, but definitely good.  They came with a cream cheese sauce and I noticed most people were pouring the entire thing on their pancakes, lol.  Yeah, they were good but all of it was too sweet for me. \n\nThe banana cream pie pancakes were really good.  banana slices, a banana type sauce, almonds and a whipped cream that tasted like it was infused with banana.  If they only added some chocolate too! mmmm.........\n\nThe corned beef hash said that it was homemade on the menu but it looked like and tasted like the canned stuff.  I think the best corned beef hash still belongs to Black Bear Diner...\n\nOverall a great experience and we will be back.  We're looking forward to trying the kalua pig benedict, chicken adobo omelet, etc.  \n\np.s. for any Hawaii Peeps out there, their banana cream pie pancakes tasted exactly like the banana mac pancakes from BOOTS N KIMOS in Kailua!

Not only are they cooked flawlessly, but there are some creative toppings. Red velvet, banana fosters, cinnamon bun & s'mores. Hands down best pancakes I've had in years.\nTHE BAD: service isn't that attentive. There wasn't any sugar on my table and it took almost 10 mins to get the attention of a server. Also we weren't pressed on how we liked our half uneaten entrees. Which leads me to...\nTHE UGLY: neither anyone I've gone with or myself have ever gotten a savory dish that was good. The Kailua pig Benedict's sounded great, but I was eventually grateful they don't give you much pig. Pretty flavorless. This last time I tried the chili loco moco special. Horrible! Hamburger was dry, egg over cooked and it was served over dry jasmine rice. Why would you ever do loco moco over jasmine rice?\nBottom line if you want pancakes come here.

Never again will I make this sort of mistake. I still can't get over how good food is off the strip! \n\nWe came during the breakfast/brunch rush and were seated at the counter. I was surprised that the restaurant was so full. It seems like a hit with the locals. I'm not sure if it was the business of the restaurant, but we had to wait longer than usual for even our waiter to take our order. After ordering though, he was pretty attentive so I can't really complain. \n\nNow, I'm a HUGE breakfast and brunch fan! Their extensive menu is mostly geared towards breakfast food, with just one page dedicated to their lunch menu. At first I thought it was just your regular American type of Breakfast and Brunch place, but they also have Hawaiian plates such as Loco Moco and Spam Scramble. Apparently they're known for their pancakes, or \"BabyStacks\". There was such a huge variety that I felt pretty overwhelmed. I wanted to try everything! Thanks to Yelp, I just had to order the Red Velvet short stack. Seriously, this was pretty much a dessert party in my mouth! Probably one of the best Red Velvet pancakes I've had. The pancakes had whipped cream, chocolate crumbles, and this amazing cream cheese syrup. It was amazing! We also ordered the Adobo Fried Rice, which is adobo fried rice that's stuffed into an egg omelette. The rice had so much flavor and adding sriracha really brought out the flavor of the dish altogether. \n\nOverall the food met my expectations and I can't wait to come back during our next trip and try the other food! Gracias! Salamat! Mahalo!"

The steak was perfectly rare, & my side of hollandaise made me happy.

The small stacks are two small pancakes, which are the perfect size to try them yet not stuff yourself silly.\n\nChicken Fried Steak & Eggs - I had a bite of this & it was damn good!  The crispy battered steak & the gravy were really good.  Hash browns were kindof basic, but the upgrade to these were SO good:\n\nBanana Cream Pie pancakes - another short stack of two perfectly textured, light & fluffy little pancakes, topped with vanilla pudding, sliced fresh bananas, & fresh whipped cream.  These were THE BEST!! \n\nTheir selection of unique kalua pork menu items (grilled cheese & benedict) as well as fried rice rolled into an omelette make me wonder why these guys don't come to LA!!\n\nThis is one of the best breakfast places I've been to.

It is the place I take friends and travel companions when in town and to a person they are pleased with the meal. That is because the staff members are all pleasant, the food is tasty and prepared quickly.  While everything is good, I recommend ordering the lemon ricotta pancakes (there are enough to share with the \"friend\" you met last night, or flew into town with). The coffee is always hot, fresh, smooth, and your cup will never be empty.\n\nDon't be put off by the simple exterior and location.  This place has the feel of a family run restaurant (and probably is) and they make everyone feel comfortable and welcome. Oh, and did mention I love this place because the food is oh so good.\n\nSo, if you are a Vegas local, give it a try.  If you are a visitor to Sin City, make a tiny extra effort, travel west on Flamingo and turn south on Buffalo.  It is on the corner just south of a drug store in a strip mall.  Pull in, walk in, enjoy. There are two locations in Vegas, but the one on the corner of Flamingo and Buffalo is the location I am familiar with."

I give them extra credit for all the variety and the fact that it makes me want to try more.\n\nI came here for breakfast this morning to redeem my Yelp Deal. I have been to their first location in the past and was excited that they opened another location closer to my home. \n\nWe came in around 10am, and as I have experienced at the other location, the wait was pretty long. Unfortunately, as with the other location, they underestimate the wait time as well. I just like to know what I'm getting into before I decide to wait or not (don't worry, I'm done venting about that).\n\nWe were finally seated and the service was friendly and efficient. I ordered the ham and eggs with hash browns and upgraded to the lemon ricotta pancakes. My fella ordered the chicken omelet with homestyle fries and upgraded to the red velvet pancakes. The food was solid, although I was not a fan of the canned ham they served instead of ham steak. I was also a little disappointed that despite asking for my eggs and hash browns well done, the eggs were runny and the hash browns were really pale, not well done by any means. The food was still good though. I'm a big fan of the flavored pancakes, but the lemon ricotta really weren't doing a lot for me. I wish the curd were slightly more tangy and lemon-y, it was just a little too sweet. The red velvet were just right however. I also wish the pancakes had a fluffier consistency, but the flavors are still really nice.\n\nOverall, a good dining experience and I'm still interested in trying more of their menu items."

When I got a text from my friend last night before that they were going to Babystacks for brunch, I jumped on the moment to tag along.  Boy am I glad I did!\n\n***Please be advised that you may have to wait a while before you get a table.  The hostess advised me that it could be upwards of up to 45 minutes.  We ended up waiting a little over 30 minutes.\n\nSpeaking of the hostess, I would like to share the only reason why this place got 4 stars for me.  This morning, there was a young girl in the front, taking everyone's name for the list.  She was definitely not as pleasant as I hoped for.  Maybe it just wasn't her day.  She showed a lot of irritation and no patience for anyone in front of her.  When it was time to pay, I noticed a jar that said, \"Tip for hostess,\" and realized why there was only a SINGLE dollar in there...\n\nOk, I'm done with my negative rant.  I want to talk about the AH-MAZE-ING food known as Babystacks!  Here's what me and my friends got:\n\nSpam and Eggs for $8.25- It came with 3 slices of fried spam, eggs the way you like it (I got it scrambled) and either potatoes, hash browns, garlic rice for an extra charge and pancakes (any kinds of specialty pancakes for an up charge as well).  I chose the garlic rice and the bacon pancakes to get a versatile meal.  The rice was regular white rice with some kind of garlic infused oil drizzle over it with onions.  The only suggestion we had was maybe having caramelized onions in the future, but the rice was good.  The eggs were eggs and so was the spam.  Here's where this dish blows your minds...WHEN YOU COMBINED THOSE FLAVORS IN ONE BITE! That combination in one bite just made this dish worth it for me.  The pancakes were buttermilk pancakes with strips of bacon in the batter.  I really love eating breakfast meat with maple syrup so having that bacon in the pancakes made it AMAZEBALLS for me!!\n\nKalua Pig Benedict for $9.75- Now this is the dish that will keep me coming back!!  Let's start with the most flavorful seasoned potatoes cut into small cubes.  Then my friends, then there's the main attraction!  Toasted English Muffin, layered with a smoked Kalua (shredded) pig with cabbage, a medium poached egg and topped with hollandaise sauce.  I can't tell you how AH-MAZE-ING this dish is.  You'll just have to try it yourself.  Just know that the pork is super juicy and smokey, the English muffin is toasted by still soft, the egg is perfectly poached and the hollandaise is...well, let's just say that I'm going to dream about that sauce for months to come.\n\nMy friend had the short stack of Red Velvet Pancakes for $5.75- Start with 3 red velvet pancakes, topped with chocolate chunks and whipped cream and served with a cream cheese syrup.  I had the opportunity to try this and boy was it good!!  Super moist, super flavorful and such a great concept/reality!  I will be ordering a full stack the next time.\n\nMy other friend got the Portuguese sausage and eggs for $8.95- He had his eggs over easy, got the hashbrowns and chose the banana cream pie pancakes for an extra charge.  The Portuguese sausage is very familiar to me, being from Hawaii and it looked like the eggs were perfectly cooked.  Although I didn't try his meal, I know he was very satisfied by it, especially the banana cream pie pancakes.  His pancakes had bananas in the batter and as a topping.  These pancakes also came with sliced almonds, whipped cream, crushed pie crust and drizzled with a banana cream sauce.  \n\nThe place is small.  Super small.  There's a t.v. in the joint, contains bar top seating and a couple of butterflies as it's decor.  I'd consider this place a contender for Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  The food is that good!  If it wasn't for the hostess with the bad impression, this place would have gotten a 5 star.  Mark my words though.  The food itself will keep me coming back!"

I had the banana cream pie pancakes and they really tasted like banana cream pie.  If you like banana cream pie, you will love these pancakes.  My friends had carrot cake, cinnabun and bacon pancakes.  They were all well received but the bacon pancakes had a complaint that they were lacking a bit in the bacon department.   I didn't not try them, but they did not look like they were super infused with bacon as they should be.\n\nThe only major complaint we had was service.  When we first arrived we asked if they had fresh brewed iced tea and the woman taking our drink order said no.  We saw a pitcher of what looked like iced tea sitting on the counter top.  We asked our waiter when he came to take our order and he said that was indeed iced tea.  Apparently the woman who took our order did not speak english very well.  Hmm...that's a bit problematic.

This location is a bit bigger than the original, but of course all the food especially the pancakes still taste the same. I've been here on 2 visits and my most recent I ordered something other than my usual selections of kalua pig benedict and red velvet pancakes. They had a dry erase board with new menu selections and it had things like kalua pig grilled cheese and breakfast sliders. Both sounded delish, but after reading the description of the breakfast sliders it seemed like it was something I could make on my own making me choose the kalua pig grilled cheese! Loved every bite of it because it had a good amount of pork in there and meshed well with all the cheesey goodness. I've heard from friends and from my own personal experience that the other pancake options cannot compare to the red velvet, does anyone know of another pancake they offer that is just as spectacular?\n\nP.S. they over estimate the wait time because on several occasions I have been seated sooner than the original time they told me."

Yes there is quite a wait but my friend and I were catching up so it went by quickly.  From the looks of the menu, I wanted to order everything.  Being part Filipina from Hawaii, it was refreshing to see the food had that same ethnic vibe.  I ordered the corned beef hash, eggs, & garlic fried rice.  I really didn't like the texture of the corned beef hash.  It was too processed, and like another Yelper noted, reminded me of dog food.  The garlic rice was good, like my mom's.  I also didn't care for the pancakes.  They tasted very strongly of baking powder.  I can't remember what my son ordered but he ate it all without complaints.  My friend, also from Hawaii,  ordered the Loco Moco and ate all of hers.  She ordered a short stack of the red velvet pancakes.  I tried them and again, the taste of baking powder was overpowering.  The cream cheese syrup was good.  My son ate the rest and liked them.\n  \nI am not completely turned off by the place and want to give them another try.  Perhaps the pancakes were just bad that day?  I want to try other items on the menu.  I think it's great there are Hawaiian-style breakfast items on the menu even though the owner is not from Hawaii.  Oh yeah, we were told that the chili on the menu is Zippy's chili!!!\n\nI will be back here and hope to upgrade this review."

The adobo omelette was also shared and that had really good flavor, but my absolute favorite, what I got up early for on my day off was the lemon ricotta pancakes (more like a crepe) sweet baby Jesus these brought tears to my eyes, ok maybe a little dramatic but they are so good I need to emphasize how good. So light and refreshing, I just add a tiny layer of butter and sprinkle powdered sugar and dip a bite at a time in the sauce it comes with. If you have a love for lemon like I do, you have to try these. And an added bonus for coffee drinkers, they serve half & half, not non-dairy creamer!! It's the little things in life, I know....."

Warm, comforting, just looking at the menu reminds me of home!\n\nI've eaten at this location recently a few times and I've left feeling happy and full. I really enjoy cafes that only serve breakfast and/or brunch like this one, because they do it right! \n\nIf you've ever been to Hawaii and miss those nostalgic eats, like spam, Portuguese sausage, eggs, & rice, Kalua pig Benedict, or some fluffy white-chocolate macadamia nut pancakes, you've found your place that serves all that and more. I haven't tried some of their more creative creations, like their Spam Scramble. Spam, eggs, rice, furikake, with homemade macaroni salad?! Or the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice or classic Loco Moco? It all sounds ono, doesn't it? They also offer omelettes, skillets, burgers, and even Zippy's Chili! If that wasn't enough, their pancakes or babystacks as they call them, are delicious! Classic toppings like blueberry and buttermilk, but their unique flavors like Orange Dreamsicle, rocky road, PB&J, S'mores, Carrot Cake, Banana Cream, even Bacon pancakes are sure to catch your eye. They are most known for their Red Velvet, however the rest of the selections sound just as delicious, I think. Recently, we tried the Cinnabun and Hazelnut w/ Nutella. Light, fluffy, and delicious, as pancakes should be! Their garlic rice, which are saut\u00e9ed with onions are amazing, which many people substitute for the plain steamed white rice. \n\nAnother thing I love is the way BabyStacks lets you substitute anything, some for a small up charge. Garlic rice? Egg whites only? Lemon Ricotta pancakes instead of regular buttermilk? I appreciate restaurants like this that'll make your breakfast the way you want it! And the prices are very reasonable. Their highest priced item I saw was $11.95, and that's for a full breakfast entree, which you get a big portion of meat accompanied with rice or potatoes AND pancakes or toast. \n\n\nI've had great service on each of my visits. Waters filled, food delivery fast, and servers are friendly and helpful. \n\nHonestly, the only thing that makes this place less than 5 stars is probably the wait to be seated. I've been lucky not to have waited very long, but my servers told me there's certain weekdays that can go an hour wait for a table. See...the food must be good!\n\nCheck it out if you haven't already...and go hungry!"

No matter what, ask for their cream cheese sauce. Amazing. As for entrees, my personal favorites are the adobo fried rice (being Filipino) and Kalua pig eggs Benedict. I also ventured to try out the Mexican skillet. Wow. Yeah, leave your diet at home and don't ask for nutritional facts. You are here for the food coma.\n\nThey are really five stars, but I deducted one for the long wait. FYI: it is usually a 30-45 minute wait on Saturday / Sunday after 9am so bring your coffee, iPad, knitting project or newspaper to help pass the time. You will be pancake hoarding in no time. They have a few TVs in there for watching football games ;)"

Even after waiting 45 minutes for a table, the server took 10 minutes to take our order. She came back missing 4 out of 8 drinks, and gave us the wrong 4 when she came back...ok, maybe she was new or having a bad day, but with 3 servers and not that many tables, someone should've helped her out. Another 30 minutes later (no exaggeration here, I promise) she came out with our food. \nBut wait-\nThe cream cheese syrup is what MAKES the Red Velvet Pancakes decent...no cream cheese syrup?! Guess what happens next? Oh right, I wait...AGAIN, this time for a HALF filled syrup cup!!! I ask, nicely, maybe she'll fill it up a little bit, since it's half full and I server says ,\"it'll be another 75 cents extra.\"\nOkay- in my defense, I read that it would be extra for the syrup, but I just wanted her to fill up the syrup cup included with my pan-cakes-puh-lease!!!\n \nWhat in the hell?!?!? \nI would've given this place 3 stars if it weren't for the extra hour and a half used in waiting for seating and food...and the syrup!!!"

If you want excellent pancakes, Babystacks is the place to be. I've been here 3-4 times already and I love it. Their portions are pretty big, so if you're not a heavy eater, SPLIT it! Also a tad bit too sweet IMO, but still excellent."

It was about 10 minutes away from The Strip and BabyStacks is a small casual cafe in a local plaza. There were so many choices to choose from, but I had to try their famed Red Velvet Pancakes. I'm usually not a huge fan of Red Velvet since I've had enough as a dessert and I find it usually a bit too sweet with their cream cheese frosting. I was a bit afraid that it would be too sweet for pancakes, but I was wrong. BabyStacks Cafe was the first and perhaps the best red velvet pancakes I have ever had. The pancakes was not too sweet and its syrup was just right that didn't left me feeling like I already indulged a load of sugar for the morning. I got the short stack which was enough for me for 3 pancakes. It's affordable with entrees costing less than $10! BabyStacks Cafe is a casual cafe that seems to be known within the locals, so it didn't felt like it was all touristy. Their service was great and the waitress welcomed me as a newcomer which I thought it was a pleasant experience at BabyStacks. BabyStacks is definitely bookmarked for my future visits to Vegas!"

Here are my thoughts on Baby Stacks:\n\nThe Good:\nHoly moly, their breakfast was so good!! They specialize in pancakes, of course. They have a wide variety of just about everything you can think of to mix in to pancake batter. In fact, there were a few specials of pancakes that weren't even on the menu. \n\nI had an egg white omelet with a side of rice instead of hash browns. In addition, I ordered a mini side of chocolate chip pancakes. SO GOOD!\n\nThe Bad:\nIt's hard to eat healthy in this type of breakfast place. Most all of the pancakes and breakfast items are for sure going to be high in calories. But, sometimes you have to treat yourself every once in a while. \n\nOh, also their tables are a bit small for their plate sizes. Other than that, Baby Stacks was great!"

Throw in some seasoned potatoes and one slide order of eggs and all four of us were taken care of... Not to mention, my mother-in-law accompanied us and she is a strict vegetarian... The chef made a very nice skillet for her consisting  of potatoes and cheeses and a multitude of vegetables in a spicy sauce that kept her very happy as well... Thank you for accommodating that!  Our orders were delicious, tasty... Sinfully good!\n\nMy one big question is how come you don't find this chain in one of the big Resort Hotels? I think it would be a grand slam...

Inconsistent dishes, mediocre service, but two of the tastiest breakfast items I've had to date.\n\nBabystacks is know for its fluffy pancakes and its Island inspired breakfast items. Adobo Fried Rice. I don't know what this stuff is made out of, but it's so addictive (so probably crack)! On a previous visit, I overheard a guy ask for the rice as a side and the waitress said, of course. A big pile of fresh adobo fried rice arrived with his order.\n\nOn my last trip I asked for just a side of the rice and was denied. Being in a large group and not feeling particularly bratty, I let it slide as a friend said she'd take my eggs and I could have the filling. When the food arrived, the rice was delightful except for how crunchy it was. Starving and because the rice was so damn tasty, i plowed away. I was insatiable. To this day, I still find my self muttering Adobo Fried Rice in my sleep...\n\nThe rest of the menu is hit or miss, including the pancakes. Most are simply pancakes with dope toppings, but the pancakes aren't anything spectacular. The most delightful I've had were the Cookies N Creme pancakes. Diabettttus for breakfast, but heavenly.\n\nI don't hate, Babystacks, but I don't love them either. Very middle of the road.

Not too salty, which is a PLUS in my book.  I asked for hollandaise sauce ON THE SIDE.  You might want to request this too.  B/c once you break the egg yolk it can get pretty rich & heavy.  And if your benedict is drenched in hollandaise sauce too...idk!  Can you say heartburn?  This dish was pretty good. \n\nPORTUGUESE SAUSAGE w/ garlic rice & eggs PLUS your choice pancakes (2 cakes).  This dish is simple, but AWESOME. The garlic rice is good & homey, but NOT ENOUGH (portion size is about 1/2 bowl of rice).  Us Asians like our rice. \nSausage was tasty and plenty. \nAs for the pancake - i ordered Banana cream Pie.  A bit bland and dull for me.  Like all some of the other reviews say - if you like Banana cream pie...you would like this. However, it was BLAH.  I even ordered CREAM CHEESE syrup on the side.  The syrup wasn't as good as I envisioned it to be.  Tasted more like a sugar glaze w/ a hint of cream cheese.  \n\nADOBO FRIED RICE: Egg omlette w/ pork adobo rice inside. Sounded pretty unique...had to get it (to go).  It was good, but nothing too special.  Meat was tender and well marinated. i would go w/ the Portuguese sausage combo dish rather than this. \n\nSERVICE: friendly waiter.  Food took a LONG time to come out. \n\nOverall, I liked the food and the wide selection on the menu.  I LOVE the idea of  Hawaiian/Filipino mixed with american breakfast.

Even though it was busy, our server checked on use and made sure everything was good. \n\nI ordered orange creamsicle pancakes and they were amazing. They aren't dyed, it's all natural and you can see the orange zest inside. I have enough food for left overs after ordering an omelette with it. I would recommend this place for breakfast any day. It's a little crowded but it's worth it."

A great wide selection of pancake flavors...from Rocky road to their signature Red Velvet (a definite must try!)  I ordered their Kalua Pig Benedict --omg it's so damn good.  The best Hawaiian fusion breakfast.  The eggs were cooked perfect and the kalua pig was flavored perfectly (not crazy salty).  I also ordered a side of Red Velvet short stacks.  MmMmMm...came with a fluffy dollop of whipped butter and side of melted cream cheese icing and sprinkled with chocolate chips crumbles.  I'm normally not a sweets kinda person when it comes to breakfast, but this was absolutely delicious.  It paired well with the Kalua Pig Benedicts.  The only thing I regret is not taking a picture before devouring the whole thing.   I will definitely be back to this cute little cafe!"

I had the Spam scramble which was good.  The Furikake on top really cut through the saltiness of the Spam.  The scramble came with a side of pancakes, I got the white chocolate macadamia pancakes.  They were good but the white chocolate macadamia part of the pancakes was on top and it was difficult to get a perfect bite.  Otherwise they were just regular pancakes with toppings.  My friend and I shared the red velvet pancakes and OMG they are to die for!  I woke up in my bed in Sacramento the next day craving those pancakes.  The cream cheese syrup wasn't too sweet.  It was just right and the red velvet pancakes were so fluffy.  I wish I had just gotten those pancakes by themselves.\n\nGET THE RED VELVET PANCAKES EVERYONE!"

Kids chose short stack of smores and rocky road.  Smores tasted just like smores and moist, rocky road was a little more dry bc pancakes were chocolate.  I had Huntington omelette which was ok.

If you can withstand the wait, you will get seated very closely with other customers. We like our privacy when eating, not listening to our neighbors conversations. \n\nThen I wasn't very hungry, so I saw the kids meals were available. It never stated anywhere on the menu that you are not able to get a kids meal over a certain age or anything. So I thought, what a great idea to get the perfect amount of food since I wasn't that hungry. Well, the waitress was very rude and would not allow it, despite me even showing her there is nothing showing an age limit. I settled on just a drink and small side item. \n\nThe food is good and prices are alright. Service once seated took a little while as well. I will not be returning, to this location at least. It really struck me badly when the waitress would not allow me to order what was on the menu. If you don't want me to order kids meals, put something on the menu stating that only under 12 or something."

My husband ordered the carnitas skillets with a side of lemon ricotta pancakes. And my dad ordered the carrot cake pancakes and a side of potatoes. We were all blown away with how delicious everything was! My skillet was perfect and those red velvet pancakes -- well, you can read all about them in the numerous other reviews. Let me just say, they were everything they were cracked up to be. I think I actually prefer red velvet pancakes to red velvet cake now. That's right, I said it. Oh, and their salsa is all homemade and delicious!\n\nThe winner of the morning, however, was the lemon ricotta pancakes. They were more like crepes and they were absolutely PERFECT. So light and fresh. We couldn't stop talking about them, or the restaurant in general. So much so that even a month later while having dinner with some family back home, we mentioned the place and my aunt (who isn't visiting Vegas for months) made me send her all the info for BabyStacks so that she could go eat those pancakes during her visit. \n\nWell done, BabyStacks.

We NEVER rent a car.  Cabs can be expensive so we normally spend 95% of our time on the strip.  Now that we have family in Sin City, we are starting to venture out a little bit more, and it's the one of the best Vegas decisions we have ever made.\n\nWe were talking with our family about where to go for Sunday Brunch.  We found buffets ranging from $17.95 to $90 per person on the strip.  Then I hopped on the internet and found BabyStacks Cafe.  They have 4 locations in town. We liked the description and headed to the one off of Flamingo blvd on Buffalo Drive.\n\nThis restaurant is owned by a woman who dared to ask herself one crazy question:  What would happen if you take cupcake flavors and turn them into pancakes?  The answer, pure AWESOMENESS! We were a party of 4 and waited for about 30 minutes to get our table.  From what I read, this is pretty normal for the restaurant.  The capacity is a little over 50+ people, and the demand is high, so be prepared for a little wait.\n\nOnce in the restaurant, we found it to be clean and the service was spot on.  We ordered quickly.  Here is what we decided on:\n\nRed velvet pancakes\nGerman chocolate pancakes\nLemon Ricotta crepe like pancakes\nOrange Creamsicle pancakes\nBacon pancakes\nBiscuits and Gravy with sunny side up eggs and hashbrowns\nMexican Omelette\nEgg White Omelette\n\nThe menu is full of great sounding cupcake flavored pancakes, as well as traditional favorites.  They even have Hawaiian specialties with pulled pork and spam. If the other dishes are anything close to what we ordered, you can't go wrong.  Every single dish was delicious.  We all shared what we ordered and all any of us could say was, \"WOW!\"  Personally, I thought the red velvet pancakes were the best, but it was so close to call that there really was no clear winner.\n\nI have never raved about breakfast before.  But I just had to write about this place. BabyStacks Cafe is by far the best breakfast I have ever had. Here is the kicker...the total cost for all 4 of us was $70!  We all ate until we were stuffed and every bite was wonderful.  I guarantee that you can't find anything like this on the strip.  I would suggest that if you are on the strip and you don't have a car, Uber, Lyft, or cab-ride it to this restaurant.  You will be happy you did!"

Got there by 830a on Sunday and the place was already packed by 9:30, so always try to get there as early as possible or you will be waiting 45+ minutes. This past weekend I tried the lemon ricotta pancakes (not a big fan of lemon, so...not a big fan of these), Bananas foster pancakes (my new fave!!), and spam scramble (delicious, but trying to cut my meat intake ;). Other great pancake dishes are the White Chocolate pancakes and cinnabun, both super delish, but I do have a huge sweet tooth so I may be biased."

Some of the people looked like they didn't sleep at all with their dresses and New Year's eve hats!\n\n  I needed to go to a Hawaiian breakfast place this time because what I was craving you would not find in your local IHOP. I decided to wait the 30 minutes even though I was super hungry.\n\nI ordered the Kalbi (beef short rib) , upgraded to the garlic fried rice and an over easy egg. I like to mix the egg yolk in my rice. (Learned habit from childhood) . It was delicious and just what I needed!\n\n I figured while I was there I would also get a side of their Lemon Ricotta crepes. It may  sound weird but spritz them with some lemon and drizzle some of the white sugary topping and you are set! I haven't encountered any crepes like this anywhere else in Vegas so I made sure to have some since I don't come here all the time. I also had the white chocolate/ macadamia nut pancakes . You can upgrade from a buttermilk pancake to one of their specialty cakes for a small price.   \n\nThe service is great even though it can get really busy .That being said please allow around  30 minute wait time ."

The chicken adobo fried rice and garlic rice option for breakfast specials (Sinangag in Filipino) made me and my galpal feel right at home! \n\nI honestly can't believe we waited this long before hitting Babystacks. It's an all-rounder, service and food were both wins! And even better, the lines weren't hauntingly tedious like we dreaded them to be. Took us less than 5 minutes to be seated but don't buy our case as fact. I have a feeling that certain days will be busier than others, seeing as people come in families, not just in pairs/singles. \n\nDue to unavailable table seating (yep, they had to re-arrange tables to accommodate parties of 4-6), we were led to the bar where we tuned in to the morning news. I don't remember us waiting long before we ordered. We were pretty ready to rock & roll and devour! Servings are pretty decent (I'd say large for us, Asians) and we shared the Corned Beef Hash with Sunny Side up Eggs, wheat bread and the savory, buttery Garlic Rice, also known as Sinangag in Filipino. \n\nOn top of that, we figured it would be a waste to not try one of their specialty pancakes. As Hazlenut/Nutella lovers, we debated whether to get the Hazlenut pancakes or the more well-known Red Velvet stack. We ended up with the former and beamed as they got to our counter drizzled with nutella, crushed almonds and whipped cream. Holy moly, were they pretty - and I don't know if you could use this word for pancakes - chunky! A whole spoonful would take a while to chew on and swallow without the help of a drink. Milk did the magic. Soon enough, we had to stop before the they filled us up to our throats. \n\nBabystacks impressed me, especially since one would not decipher the cultural fusion that occurs until you get a glance at the menu!"

Arriving at about 11:00 on a Friday, it was pretty busy. The place was packed; all tables full and all the waiting benches inside were almost full (about 8/12 seats). Staff was nice, informed of us a 25 minute wait that turned out to be about 10 minutes. They were turning people out surprisingly quickly. Food looked as I'd it was coming out quickly as well. \n\nThe menu was a very unique concoction of dessert-style pancakes, and Filipino/island style flair. The latter having a special place in my heart, I ordered the \"Adobo fried rice omelette\". I didn't realize it at first, but it also came with a side of mac salad! My face lit up when our hostess asked if that was alright. It was $9.25, which some may think is a bit on the high end. It was entirely worth it. Out food came out in under 15 minutes. The portions were rather generous, about an 8\"x3\" omelette and a deceivingly deep side dish of mac salad. The amount of food is enough to satiate any appetite, and have later as a fourth meal. I'm admittedly picky when it comes to mac salad, and was delighted when I took my first bite of it. It wasn't the least bit runny and wasn't overpowered by mayo. If I could have ordered a pint (I'm from out of town) I definitely would have. The omelette itself was not disappointing in the slightest. The egg was reasonably seasoned, and garnished with green peppers. The fried rice/chicken adobo filling was just what I was craving. If you're not used to adobo, you may find the taste of vinegar unexpected! It had a wonderfully bold taste. The chicken was obviously well soaked, it was very tender and well shredded. \n\nThe building it's in looks pretty new, the lot is nicely paved, and the inside of the restaurant was clean. \n\nWhenever I'm in the area again I will definitely be back. Fantastic food, friendly staff, reasonably priced, and there is a good sized parking lot."

The atmosphere was comfortable, service was quick, and the food was out pretty fast. But when I got my plate, the corned beef hash looked more like a flattened out, dry piece of scrapple (PA Dutchies will know what I mean, or someone from the northeast:) AND. It didn't taste much better. Plus, the whole breakfast was cold. Well, luke warm, I guess, but not as hot as it should have been (cold eggs are gross).  The pancakes looked promising.  I went with the Cinnamon Bun (it was a compromise because I was sharing). But they were dry, and not hot either. And waay too sweet for my taste. I should have gone with my instinct and tried the bacon or carrot cake.  I was not disappointed to the point of not going back. I understand off days, and I don't get all in a huff about stuff ( watching people flip out in a restaurant makes me feel embarrassed for them). It was still good service, and had good conversation with surrounding tables. I may have just been unlucky that morning."

            "review": "Food was good for the most part. Customer service needs work. \n\nI was really excited to try out Babystacks for the first time and it all started out looking good. They had a good selection of pancakes and it was so hard for me to decide which one I wanted, especially since they don't come with any meat. We ended up going with an entree and upgrading our side to a baby stack so that we could try out some flavors. \n\nThe adobo omelette was tasty and a good sized portion. The red velvet pancakes we got as it's side was also really yummy.  They were moist and the cream cheese syrup wasn't overly sweet. All in all we were very pleased. \n\nNow our second entree was ordered later (since I couldn't decide what I wanted) and ended up coming out just as we finished our first dish. We were severely disappointed this time around. \n\nThe chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes were alright...they didn't taste too bad, but they were pretty dry. The two pancakes instantly soaked up all the syrup we poured on them and texture was dry, sticky, and all wrong. Not enjoyable at all, but at least they didn't taste disgusting. \n\nThen came the baby chick skillet. The eggs we ordered over easy were cooked perfectly, but the entire dish lacked flavor. The chicken was microscopic because we literally found one piece that was smaller than the potato cubes. And to top it off, I found a piece of hard packaging plastic in my second bite. \n\nWe stopped eating and brought it to our waitress's attention. She took the plate back and somebody else came out to talk to us about it. This lady inquired about where we found the plastic and when we told her, she  said that was weird because everything in the dish is freshly made and not packaged. That's exactly what I thought, but there is no excuse for foreign objects to be found in food and it wasn't cool how accusingly she spoke to us, as if we were the ones who put it there. \n\nThen they tried to give us a 20% discount on the meal instead of taking the skillet off the tab completely. This was very upsetting considering we only had three bites in all and left the rest of the dish untouched (including that tiny piece of chicken that was only found after thorough inspection). It was only after my boyfriend insisted they take the skillet off that they proceeded to do so. We still tipped our waitress $5, but I left extremely unhappy about how they handled the whole situation."

We chose this location cause it was closer out of 3?\n\nWe got two orders to share among the two of us. One was baby chick omelet and the other was red velvet pancakes. Us two don't eat much so it was perfect. Might be not enough for those who eat a lot. \n\nWe ordered short so it came with 3 pancakes only. Full order would be 5. I don't like cream on my pancakes so I asked for it on the side. I'm glad I did cause the pancake was sweet enough by itself. The powder was different from most pancakes. More moist? But I love it!! \n\nThe omelet was not bad either. I forgot what topping was in it but it was flavorful. I love their seasoning potatoes! Just perfectly crispy and not too salty. \n\nService was a tad slow but they were busy also. Definitely friendly people though! I guess this place could replace my breakfast at Hash House A Go Go after all."

I just HATE the fact that this delicious breakfast place is literally ONE MINUTE from my house while I'm on this dreaded diet! Other than that, it's also love that it's so close. \n\nFrom the outside, this place doesn't look like much. In fact, I was never curious about what this place was until my bestie invited me here for breakfast. BUT, as soon as you step in, you seriously feel like a character on Animal Crossing. The inside is SHO CUTE! It has an adorable and homey ambience that I just love! The service was also great and friendly! \n\nIf you're looking for a great breakfast/brunch I suggest opting out for the skillets! They have so many combinations and possibilities for them. They also come with pancakes that you can replace with special pancakes for only ONE DOLLAH! I know that everyone talks about their Red Velvet pancakes, but I'm not a huge fan of chocolatey goodness first thing in the morning (ironic I know). Instead, I am in love with their CARROT PANCAKES! Give them a chance! They are delish! I always ask for the cream-cheese syrup on the side. They are fluffy and cooked to absolute perfection. Their BANANA CREAM pancakes are also delicious! It tastes just like an actual banana cream pie (amazing I know). \n\nAs a huge fan of french toast, I'm definitely looking forward to trying it here on my next visit! If you're looking for a great little breakfast place, BabyStacks is the way to go! I always leave here with a food coma!"

It was no coincidence that I found this restaurant, it can only be explained as destiny and a yelp app. \n\nI was in Vegas for a weekend for some friend's birthday and I wanted pancakes for breakfast. Not the tacky boring stuff your face buffet kind but some quality flap jacks.  So where else do I turn to but my yelp app. Thanks people of yelp for steering me and my boyfriend to this neat local spot! I was seriously delighted by the selections and the portions are just right. They have red velvet pancakes, lemon ricotta pancakes, honey wheat, and even strawberry shortcake. I ordered the Portuguese sausage and eggs with a short stack of bacon pancakes (A slight increase in price for the upgrade, totally worth it.). And my boo ordered the regular sausage and eggs with the banana cream pancakes. He and I both agreed Portuguese is the best way to go because the sausage had a little spice to it that the other sausage could not compete with. Good service, we got our food quickly, and our tummy's were more then satisfied with the portions. We are definitely making this a regular stop on our future Vegas trips."

Too tempting.\n\nThis is a super popular place for breakfast or brunch, and their targeted hours (closing at 2PM or 3PM everyday) make sure they are ALWAYS packed. If you come with a group, make sure you don't have any lagging friends, because they will only seat you when your entire party is present.\n\nI tried the limited edition Chocolate Peppermint Pancakes, which were tasty for the first three bites then were too sweet. The pancakes themselves are chocolate, with peppermint pieces cooked into them. Good thing I only got a small stack! I did try the red velvet pancakes, but they just tasted like flat red velvet cupcakes, as expected. \n\nThe wide variety of food at BabyStacks is a little overwhelming, but I guess you could say they have something for everyone. The service is decent (not outstanding) and it's just a hectic place to eat with all the crowds and TVs and bar area and AHH it can get crazy. Definitely an iconic restaurant to check out but nothing special."

The panacea of pancakes changes often, but expect to find staples like Red Velvet, Lemon-Ricotta, and S'mores on the menu when you dine.  Besides lots of pancakes, BabyStacks also stays true to it's Hawaiian roots with breakfast grinds like Loco Moco, Spam fried rice, and Kahlua Pork omelets.  \n\n\nThe place is very small, and can feel cramped, especially during a busy weekend rush.  If you don't have the sweet tooth of a five year old, you may want to pass on the pancakes, and go for something savory.  On my last visit, I kept it simple, and went with some scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, and toast.  Everything was good, not great, and for the 30 minutes we waited  to get our food, after waiting about 20 to sit down, and another 10 for our coffee, it just wasn't worth it. \n\n\nBreakfast doesn't need to be a whole production, and the food isn't good enough to warrant the wait and the potential cramped seating.  \n\nBabyStacks is worth trying, but not frequenting."

The meat was also pretty pink on the inside. Not bleeding red, but I don't really like my ground beef on the medium rare side. It definitely set me off and I had to force myself to finish what I had. My brother ordered the same thing, but he said his tasted fine, if not great. He loved it actually. \nThe house potatoes were DELICIOUS! - 5 stars! \nThe buttermilk pancakes were buttery and fluffy.

We (party of 9) came the day after Christmas and boy did we come at the wrong time. They weren't necessarily busy, but we did have to wait a bit. A party of about 20 went in just before us and it was a HORRIBLE idea to stay after that. The host said he'd separate us, which we didn't mind because we already waited about 30 minutes and our party sat on opposite sides of the restaurant, again no problem. But here's the kicker. The party of 20 that came in before us wiped out the kitchen service as there were only TWO cooks that day. We waited over 45 minutes for our food and by the time the food came, everyone was extremely upset. Our server DID notify us 25 minutes into the wait that they were short on staff in the kitchen. But he never checked on us before or after that notification. We should've left after that, but since we saw the food coming out for the party of 20, we waited. Still, we waited a LONG time after. No compensation made for being there for almost 3 hours. 3 precious day after shopping hours. \n\nTIP: EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE THERE IN ORDER TO BE SEATED."

This location was the first opened so it's pretty small and you will always be waiting. The location in centennial has zero waits. So if you don't mind the drive I suggest that one.  They do have great corn beef hash because there is always way more meat than potatoes. And they cut he potatoes pretty small also try out the adobo fried rice wrapped in scrambled eggs."

Small waiting area inside. Decent sized breakfast/brunch spot.\n\nOnly open til 2p w wait times I hear that can grow to almost 2 hrs. Luckily, I went here with my best-friend's older brother before the crowds and didn't have a wait! \n\nFood: \nAdobo fried rice omelet was very good! Not greasy like a lot of Filipino food. Rice, meat, and egg were all cooked perfectly. It really worked well. Who would've thought Adobo in an omelet?! We also ordered the White chocolate macadamia nut pancakes! This was a little overkill for me since I'm not a big pancake or sweets guy. If I remember correctly, I finished only half of the split dish.\n\nService:\nNo issues with the service. Great, attentive, and we were checked up on more than once. Greeted very warmly when we walked in and immediately were shown to our table.\n\nOverall:\nI'd come here again to try a different pancake dish that's not overkill on the sweets. The Adobo omelet itself is worth the trip back and dare I say, even worth a wait if you happen have one!"

My tip- forget the breakfast regulars and treat yourself to their specialty, the pancakes! my fiance and i got the babystacks as add-ons and unanimously agree we should have just ordered big plates of pancakes! here's the biggest tip i GIFT to other travelers, do not take a taxi here! the cab from the excalibur there didnt take a direct route and ended costing us 26$+tip! we ate breakfast, walked out to the corner and hopped on the bus on flamingo street straight back to the strip for 2$ apiece, and got to sit on the upper level to really take in the sights on the way back. lessons learned for next time! we'll be dreaming about the oreo pancakes for months!"

I wanted to switch things up and so I gave BabyStacks a shot. Definitely not disappointed. \n\nThis location was a fairly small little spot, but the wait wasn't terrible. Like many diners, people get in and out at a good pace. I spent most of the wait with neck breaking turns left and right to stare down people's food as it came to the tables. \n\nI ended up choosing Rick's Adobo Fried Rice and just loved it. A good amount of food at a reasonable price and I can see why it is considered to be one of the \"local's favorites.\" \n\nAlso had a chance to taste the Cinnabun pancakes. If you're not concerned about your blood sugar levels, then get after this. The short stack (which will set you back all of $5 and some change) comes with 3 pancakes and trust me when I say you better be famished if you think you're going to finish a full order.  \n\nSo many other items on the menu I'm looking forward to trying. I'll be back soon."

While their seating area is small, and crowded in some places, the overall feel is great, and the attention to customer needs in flawless.\n\nThe big pull factor for me is their food. I've been there three times, and each time I've gotten different flavors of pancakes. I've always gone with their Mexican Skillet, which is tasty, salty, a little spicy with some fresh Jalape\u00f1os, and the perfect portion. I like that they offer the option to upgrade all the buttermilk pancakes that come with a breakfast to the \"premium flavors\". I've had the red velvet, orange creamsicle, pumpkin, s'mores, and carrot cake. (I go with my wife, we each get a different one and share). They are so good, I could order these for desert after a meal! \n\nAll in all, a great place. We've had all three locations, and there are no flukes, the food and employees are consistent.

It has to be one of my favorite things to eat and one of my guilty pleasures!

I frequent now at the Buffalo/Flamingo location because its so close and convenient. Come early when they open because lines will get long! \n\nMy typical orders:\n\nRed Velvet pancakes\nPeanut butter & banana pancakes\nRocky road pancakes\n\nThese are my top three favorites. They are so good and more dessert like. I usually order my pancakes last because I need something fulfilling to eat at breakfast rather than sweets.\n\nBuild your own omelets- I'm a sucker for omelets. I love the option of building my own only for less than $10!\n\nBabyStacks is a Hawaiian/Asian style breakfast joint so a lot of the dishes have rice, spam and macaroni.

I LOVE Strawberries and Lemon!!!\nMy husband got the Kalua Pig Benedict.  So much on his plate that he couldn't even finish it.\nMy daughter ordered the Red Velvet pancakes which was perfect!!\nHer boyfriend had the B.Y.O.which again was such a huge portion that we had to take the rest to go!!\nThe bacon was crispy, they Portuguese sausage was good but the seasoned potatoes  lacked the seasoning.\n\nService was just ok but the food made up for it."

The sausage were cold on the inside and obviously raw in some places. I asked the server to send them back and within 1 min and a half they were given back to me, having been obviously thrown in the deep fryer. They were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside. In gave up and just laughed it off, as this is really unprofessional in my opinion. The crepe was mediocre and underdone too.

And since we decided to sit at the bar, we cut the hour-long wait! Now I love my pancakes, and I love red velvet, so when you put the two of them together, I don't think you can really go wrong. And their red velvet pancakes were oh-so right! I ordered the country fried steak with the babystack of red velvet and my boyfriend ordered the adobo fried rice, also with the red velvet -- SO SO GOOD! ESPECIALLY the pancakes! It tasted like fluffy clouds of red velvet goodness in my mouth, topped with delicious cream cheese syrup! I almost forgot I ordered anything else, my steak was so neglected! The adobo fried rice was pretty awesome too! Super flavorful and wrapped in egg like a burrito -- I ate most of my boyfriend's plate. I only took off a star because after we finished eating, we were kind of neglected and had to wait at least 20 minutes for our check. But don't go here without ordering their red velvet pancakes! You will absolutely regret it!"

We came on a Sunday morning and the restaurant was busy; I believe we waited 45 minutes.  Echo the hostess welcomed us and asked for our name.  In the front, there are benches so you can sit while you wait for your table.  I was looking at the menu and there were a lot of tempting breakfast items to choose from.  The pancakes that caught my attention were, carrot, bacon, hazelnut, cinnabun, banana cream pie, orange creamsicle, rocky road,  white chocolate chip macadamia nut, and cookies & cream.  We ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice (comes with one side), Portugese Sausage & Eggs, and Cora's Corned Beef Hash and Eggs.  Then we got pancakes, Banana Foster, Cinnabun, and Red Velvet.  \n\n::Food::\nI was curious about Rick's Adobo (traditional filipino dish) Fried Rice.  The way they served the adobo was creative.  It was wrapped in an omelette, inside was shredded chicken, rice, and garnished with green onions.  I like the concept but the flavor tasted different.  Also, there were more rice than chicken.  The Portuguese sausage and corned beef hash was good, they both came with poached eggs. \n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=xq3LDYJwORo0sqzbVxoN4A)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=qZjei1WxCXIys7U0e88SlA)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=aoK8mlcAZsamPcjWcBaCrg)\n\n::Highlight::\nThe PANCAKES!!  The Banana Foster is my favorite.  It was topped with caramelized bananas, whip cream, and cinnamon sugar.  Next is the Red Velvet (best seller), the color of the pancake was bright, it was topped with whipped cream, chocolate crumble and came with a side of cream cheese.  Then we also got the Cinnabon pancake.  It had sweet icing, crunchy pecans, and dusted with cinnamon and sugar.  I would get the Banana Foster, Red Velvet, and Portuguese Sausage & Eggs again! \n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=JElMDZVy-L2K1ZYQVCq3dw)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=Kvop5h2qJN_SPR3cM3ygUg)\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=VDGIzpViJvGTOL_yE-AaLw)\n\n::Customer Service::\nEcho was very friendly.  We didn't know which pancakes to order but Lilly was very helpful by answering all our pancake questions.  \n\n::Tip::\nRemember all parties must be present to be seated. \n\n::M's Notes::\n~Arrive early, it gets busy so anticipate to wait especially on the weekends\n~Parking lot\n~Inside seating"

I don't like this temporary new earlier schedule of ours. Having breakfast at breakfast time really sucks with the wait times and dampens the mood.\n\nWe had zippys chili omelette on the specials white board. It's pretty decent and a bit different. I never really thought about chili on eggs, but it makes sense. \n\nI did a make your own skillet - potatoes with your choice of toppings (1 meat, 2 veggies, 1 cheese) and you can add additional toppings to the base price. I did carnitas, peppers, onions, pepper jack cheese and asked for green sauce on the side. It was decent, but different from most skillets that seem cooked together, this is more thrown on top and put in the broiler to melt the cheese. \n\nWe got our babystacks that come with our breakfast upgraded to their two new flavors on the white board. We did butterfinger which was rather nice and the butter finger pieces slightly melted were more peanutty in flavor and some parts crunchy. The creamsicle was decent, but I don't know if I'm just not a fan of orange flavored baked goods. \n\nService was alright. It took a while for someone to come see us and order but once we did food came out pretty quickly . Server and host were both friendly. \n\nYep. Same consistency of food as the original which is good. Sometimes it doesn't happen that way with new locations. Same food with possibly less of a wait!"

The wait was 20 minutes or so on a Saturday afternoon which wasn't too bad, and for once, we were at a restaurant where my in-laws being white, were the ones who were outnumbered!! Muahahahaha. \n\nThe atmosphere is very casual, and not bad for a brunch place. I ordered the Huntington omelette and I wish I heeded Alana's review saying to stay away from it. It was pretty miserable. Everyone else at the table loved their food, but mine was by far the worst. An omelette with probably 2? or 1 1/2? pieces of bacon cut up into the omelette with nearly non-existent cheddar cheese mixed into the eggs, and half of an over-riped avocado slices on top. I will NEVER order that again. I got the specialty Almond Joy pancakes & I guess this was my fault, but I didn't expect a chocolate batter, because I am not a big fan of chocolate cakes or chocolate pastries, but obviously, this came with chocolate pancakes, with slices almonds, coconut, and whipped cream. They weren't THAT sweet, but I wish I ordered something else.\n\nMy husband got the country fried steak which I tried a piece of and was very tasty. He ordered banana cream pie pancakes which were the best of the table. My children had s'mores pancakes which came with marshmallows and graham cracker crumbles. I didn't try them, but they were engulfed in seconds since I try to limit their sugar intake. This was certainly a treat for them. They also had the breakfast combo with eggs and bacon. The bacon was great! Thick and perfectly cooked to a crisp. The carrot cake pancakes that my mother in law ordered were a flop. WAY too heavy and cake-like rather than light and fluffy like pancakes should be. I don't know if I would be back as I already have a favorite brunch spot, and we seldom go to brunch, but I can see the appeal of specialty pancakes and I would say to stick to those, and stay away from the Huntington omelette."

The accessibility of the restaurant is often compromised because of the people standing around blocking several areas."

The Husband and I were very excited to try this place given their good reviews and their amazing sounding menu.

We were seated and I must have spent 30 minutes trying to make up my mind on what to get...it was a pretty big decision after all. Finally, I decided to get what the Husband called 'the coward's breakfast' (since I just avoided making a decision by getting one of everything) which consisted of 2 eggs, rice with garlic/onion stuffs, and 2 hazelnut pancakes (I couldn't make up my mind....I call it the Most Winning Breakfast...but that's me!). He got the orange creamsicle pancakes. The pancakes were tiny, but filling. Mine had got od flavor, but were served kind of cold. The rice was not as delicious as I thought...it was garlicky, but didn't have any flavor beyond that. The eggs were cooked well. The husband liked his pancakes, but I didn't care for them. The service was attentive. Overall, it was fine, but definitely not deserving of the raves I had heard....just another breakfast place IMO."

This place is good for one thing and one thing only: PANCAKES. \n\nMy girlfriend and I got here after waking up late on Sunday morning with an epic sweet tooth. She was craving chocolate cake so I figured this would be a great spot. \n\nIt was semi crowded by the time we got there. They told us it would be about 15 minutes, but we were given the option of sitting at the dining counter within 5 minutes. We aren't picky, so we took it! (One star here for under-promising and over-achieving. BabyStacks does a good job of over estimating wait times and then having you seated before your estimated wait time expires. This is great, in my opinion. Nothing bugs me more than being told 15 minutes and waiting 40.) \n\nAshley ordered the red velvet pancakes. She knew what she was getting before we even got there. I ordered the eggs and bacon with white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes ($1 upcharge for their specialty pancakes - well worth it). \n\nLet me say this: the rest of their breakfast foods aren't all that great. The bacon actually didn't taste very good and the eggs were nothing special. The only reason I ordered them was because I figured I should get some protein in me. However, in all honesty, if you're coming here, you should be coming for pancakes and not expect much else. The home fries or breakfast potatoes were also pretty bland, as if they came from a frozen bag. \n\nHowever, I'm still going to give 5 stars because I have never tasted better pancakes in my life. Ashley's red velvet pancakes came with cream cheese type syrup. They were UNBELIEVABLY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS. My white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes were also good - not as good as hers - but still very soft, delicious, and with white chocolate morsels that were half melted into the pancakes. MMMM. \n\nSo, seriously guys, when a restaurant names themselves after PANCAKES and specialize in PANCAKES, don't order something other than PANCAKES. \n\n:)"

The cream cheese syrup is the perfect consistency and the whip cream is to die for. When I come to Las Vegas, I make a special trip here. Expect a small wait. We were able to score 3 seats at the counter and that helped with the wait."

I got the Sausage Biscuit Benedict and the Orange Creamsicle Pancakes. Both were great, but the pancakes were amazing! IT was citrus-y and sweet (not too sweet) with a orange syrup and cream cheese sauce, just like a dreamsicle. It would be hard for me to go back and pick a different pancake, although there are so many to choose from! Must-try when in Vegas!"

My mother who is 80yrs. old actually today went to go to the bathroom to find out it was OUT OF ORDER... when we asked the hostess she said it wasnt cleaned.. so my mom went to the mens room instead to find out it was FILTHY, so there i was cleaning a public bathroom myself so my 80 yr. mother could go to the bathroom... when i brought this to the managers att. her response  was \" o ok\" at that point we picked ourselves up and we left... its a shame we loved there food but will NEVER go back to a filthy place like this again , way to many amazing breakfast places in our area.... so thanks to a ditzy hostess and a useless manager...."

Why couldn't the numerous restaurants and huge variety of food on the Vegas strip satisfy my tummy? \n\nI looked up Filipino restaurants on Yelp and found a couple of them (many were off the strip). But I hesitated, afraid I'd be disappointed by the lack of quality in the dishes and I did not want to take such a risk. I searched further as my tummy growled and mumbled \"rice, rice, rice\". Then I hear my toddler say, \"Mommy, I want wice!\"\n\nThen I see it. BabyStacks Cafe. I browsed through their menu of delicious goodness. Kahlua Pork, whaaaat? Red Velvet Pancakes, whaaaat? Garlic Rice, whaaaat? Can you just imagine a big plate of those three dishes and a cup of joe? I was so excited, my mouth watered. I said, \"Screw you, food at the Strip! I'm takin' my tummy elsewhere!\" \n\nThis cozy, little restaurant was very welcoming and we were seated immediately. Of course it was only 8:30am in the morning but there were already many people there. We ordered the Adobo Fried Rice, which was wrapped in eggs, like an omelette. The hubby loved it. There were so many dishes to choose from... I decided on the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs with GARLIC RICE and a side of buttermilk pancakes. The corned beef was very, very good. Usually when I order this item at other restaurants, it was ehhh but I was really pleased here. As for the garlic rice, it was a little bland for my taste but still delicious. For me, it's all about the stanky breath after eating garlic nawmean!! The red velvet pancakes were fluffy and warm.\n\nJust down all these dishes with a cup of coffee and you'll find yourself in a happy place :) \n\nWe have decided that whenever we visit Vegas, BabyStacks will be our breakfast spot."

EVER. the worst part was that when we told the waitress that the corned beef hash tasted off, she didn't even seem surprised!!! she just asked if we wanted something else. only when she brought the new dish of bacon and eggs did she apologize. it was all quite shocking, actually. or maybe the sugar/carb high had us all foggy and unable to react faster. she did remove the dish from our bill without us having to ask her to - which was cool, but again, she didn't seem too fazed or apologetic about it.\n\nwhen the hostess (who i'm guessing is the main proprietress?) asked us how everything went as were paying, i didn't have the heart to say anything about the corned beef. i certainly hope the waitress did, though, or at least brought it to the attention of the cook! after she took our plate away, i kept an eye/ear out to see if anyone else ordered it, but no other orders came out. \n\nso, two stars with reservation because the pancakes were so good, but really should be one star for serving spoiled food. thankfully my senses are in overdrive from the pregnancy hormones so that it only took one tiny bite to know the corned beef was bad, which i promptly spit out anyway. future customers, beware! or just stick to the pancakes!!!"

I love it!\n\nNext, well, it's a small cozy nook so I expect that parking is minimal.. It's located inside a commercial complex so parking is not bad.. We just had to circle around once to find a suitable parking for our truck.\n\nBeing that it is a cozy little nook, of course waiting area is a bit packed when we got in. Cashier is also right there by the door so you have people trying to get out and people trying to get in at the same area.. One plus, there are benches where you can sit while you and your party waits. My only biggest comment would be that, I wish the hostess would smile. She doesn't look happy at all.. All the while, there's a sign that says \"be nice or leave\".. Well, how do you expect people to be nice and friendly when your hostess does not acknowledge the guest at all let alone smile? Even after I said thank you after she sat us at our table.. Still no smile. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't rude or anything.. But just please smile!\n\nOur server on the other hand, Jamie, is very friendly and accommodating. All smiles and cheerful! She made sure my drinker are re-filled all the time.. She's very attentive. Great service! Good job!\n\nNow, my favorite part of the review.. FOOD! Being a chef, this is where I tend to focus on. We ordered the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice wrapped in omelet. That was bomb!!! So tasty and fluffy! Absolutely delicious! As a side for it, I ordered Rocky Road Pancake. That was good too! Our server suggested to get that instead of the s'mores pancake. I'm happy I did! Then, we also ordered the Kahlua Grilled Cheese Sandwich. My fianc\u00e9 said it was really good but if only the portion is bigger for the price they sell it for. And lastly, I ordered Loco Moco. That was amazing! But it wasn't enough rice.. Lol. I had to order an additional side of rice. Now, the macaroni salad that came with it, it was a bit bland. Could use more mayo and salt & pepper. Other than that, food was better than expected.. Service was amazing.\n\nI would absolutely come back at Baby Stacks! Perhaps try the other food choices they have.. And hopefully when I come back, I'll be greeted by a hostess with a big smile on her face!"

I don't think I would get it again; probably just stick to my favorites.  \n\nI just wished the restaurant was bigger.  Because sometimes we have to make sure we get there early enough to beat the morning people planning to have a LONG breakfast.  Staff is really friendly also (oh, and I have probably mentioned this before in my other reviews; where we have noticed that when a restaurant is not busy it seems like you get bad service.  Bad meaning...slower?!  People hanging out at the back or by the bar.  Well, we had this incident once at BabyStacks since we went early.  My husband was waiting for a refill on his coffee and did not get it until 15 minutes later.  Weird, how that works; seems like a place has to be jam packed for people to keep moving).  Oh welll...still good and the price is alright :)"

There was a list with the hostess for seating on Sunday. My party of 2 was seated within 20-25 minutes. The service was adequate.  All in all,  I'd eat here again if I happened to be in the neighborhood during breakfast time and they had no line. Otherwise,  skip it."

            "review": "Okay, right off the bat I need to state that I am a Goin-Out-TO-Breakfast fiend. It is my favorite meal to eat out. It's simple. It's relaxing. It's friendly. It's a uncomplicated. A good breakfast joint still offers value, a sense of community and belly full of warm yummy goodness.\n\nI learned to appreciate the beauty of a great breakfast joint at a place called the Red Hill Coffee Shop in Rancho Cucamonga Ca. Side note; It used to be just Cucamonga but then the powers that be got together and decided that tacking a Rancho on the front made it sound less looney tunish...... Nice try. So Red Hill Coffee Shop is the breakfast that all breakfast joints are judged by in my little world. And one of the things, among many, that place it on that oh so lofty pedestal are the hashbrowns.\n\nTheir hashbrowns are the shredded variety. Wonderfully crispy and brown on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. Each bite giving you that beautiful contrast of textures and when you get a little bit of the egg or syrup in that bite an added dimension of flavor. Another thing that makes the hashbrowns at RHCS so noteworthy; they don't hold back on the portion.\n\nAnd that brings me to the point of this 2 star review. I live right around the corner from the S Buffalo location of Baby Stacks. I've seen the yelp and other reviews that have praised this place. I've noticed that it's fairly busy. But in Vegas I always take user reviews with a grain of salt. And that grain of salt gets bigger the closer you get to Summerlin. After all, this is the town in which the readers of the RJ consistently name PF Chang's the best Chinese restaurant (?). \n\nSo I stopped by BS this morning and ordered a side of hashbrowns to go. I didn't have time to sit down and eat a full breakfast. I figured a side of hashbrowns would be a good bell-weather for me. And I have to say it was. You ever go to a Denny's, which I haven't done in 20 years, and when the food comes you look at the hashbrowns and think, \"Really?\"?  Well in the case of the hashbrowns I got at BS this morning \"Really?\" would have been a stretch. It was a $3.18 smidgen of fried shredded potatoes. My 16 y/o called them an \"epic fail\". \n\nI'm not usually an overly anal person. Obviously I love my hashbrowns but I felt I needed to quantify the ridiculousness of this order of hashbrowns, so I weighed them. With the togo container they weighed in at an anemic 2 oz. $3 for 2 oz of hashbrowns? Really? That's $24 a pound. This review has gone on way too long already to get into the millions of prepared foods that I can get for less than $24 a pound.\n\nBS, I'm sure all your food is as wonderful as your many customers point out. I think it's great that you are a mom and pop business making a go of it. That in and of itself is praiseworthy. But come on, potatoes are cheap. The griddle is always running. It takes little effort to keep the hashbrowns flowing and plentiful. They are a low overhead item that makes people say to their friends, \"Great breakfast joint, and you should see the hashbrowns.\"\n\nLong after the trendy red velvet thing has passed, people will still love going out to breakfast."

I was expecting a chocolatey tasting one. Their whipped cream is so goooood! I forgot to task if it's homemade. We tried the lola's chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in so much egg.. I thought it was way too much egg. If I would make it, I would add more rice and less of the egg but probably they had to make it that way to be able to wrap the rice well.

I tried their Rick's adobo fried rice, which comes wrapped in an omelette-style egg, and the loco moco, which has two eggs any style you want on house made burger patty on top of steamed white rice slathered in their gravy. Both were really good, although definitely a bit heavy for the morning. I opted to spend $1.50 more to add on their babystack pancakes as a side. I tried the red velvet which was delicious with the whipped cream but the cream cheese syrup was too heavy for me. The smores was okay. It didn't have much  chocolate chips and marshmallow in the batter and the toppings were lacking. Wish I tried the banana foster instead. \n\nMy boyfriend liked the baby chick and omelette and the build your own omelette option. He also usually doesn't like pancakes but he actually enjoyed their cookies and cream pancakes.\n\nService was a hit or miss depending on how busy they are. We went weekday mornings so we didn't have to wait long but both times it was busy, although one day was definitely more bustling. It took a while to get their attention"

We got our seats within 10 minutes.  Love that they had Hawaii-an food selection.  i ordered the kalua pig omelette while one bff got a crepe and the other bff (who i'm mad at), got the red velvet panackes. \n\nThe crepe, was just a crepe.  But the pancakes were warm and delicious and so much like a red velvet cupcake.  A perfect accompaniment to my slightly salty kalua pig.\n\nThe kalua pig was perfectly salted and made me miss home just a bit.  The portion was generous; if I were going home after brunch, I'd save some to eat for later.  But I wasn't so I went ahead and ate most of it.  My crepe-bff ate what I couldn't finish.\n\nI can't wait to come back to Vegas for this place!  Slots/gambling/clubbing, I'm not such a huge fan.  But this place, is worth flying back for."

I personally do not care for pancakes but here, they are irresistable, super moist and fluffy and pretty much any topping you could wish for.

We didn't mind the wait because we were a party of 10 but the hostesses were just rude and didn't seem to care to be there.   She calls our name and not even a second later calls it again all annoyed like us having to pick up my nephews car seat was such an inconvenience to wait a second!\n\nOur server didn't help the situation either.  He didn't introduce himself,  was getting irritated because 3 of the party of 10 wanted their pancake toppings on the side.  To top it off he goes ahead and decides to make it so that everyone gets their pancakes toppings on the side..  So we got the joy of having to spread Nutella on 4 kids orders of Nutella Pancakes and do the red velvet pancakes as well as.  If it wasn't for the food being so good this place would have gotten 1 star honestly.  Got checked on by the server once and never got out water refilled...\n\nThe food was delicious, but I definitely will not go back to this location.\n\nAdobo Fried Rice (Adobo Omelette) was on point.  Perfect rice to adobo ratio and the egg was not to thin or thick just right.  (It was colder then I would like but it wasn't the cook who decided to mess up my kids orders.)\n\nKids Nutella and Red Velvet Pancake orders were both great but they might have just been bomb because we put the toppings on ourselves haha.  Naw seriously though the batter mix was good it wasn't overly fluffy or too thick it was perfect.\n\nGreat food (5 stars),  not so great service (1 star because I don't think I can give a 0)!"

On my first Friday at work I wanted to treat myself to a big breakfast and chow down but I could only come up w/IHOP. But here is what I've been looking for. I had the short stack of their best selling red velvet, Ranchero chili chicken omelet w/hash. The pancake had a nice crisp on the outside w/a nice fluffy interior and very good chocolaty flavor. All the the whip cream and cream cheese  syrup complimented it very well. My wife had the baby chix skillet w/fresh veggies and a nice garlic flavor. They also have a filipino/Hawaiian option which is a plus when I entertain guests since that's what they like."

I'll touch on that later.\n\nThe main thing I love is the creative selection of their pancakes and that they have specials of them occasionally too! The Red Velvet made them famous and for good reason but I urge you to stray away and try some of the other yummy pancakes! The second thing I love is that you can get a full breakfast platter for under $10. The works, a little bit of everything. Eggs, potatoes, toast, SPAM :) and pancakes. An up charge for a special flavor but it's not much. I like when I don't have to choice my favorite breakfast components or spend a fortune on getting all the additional sides. \n\nThey opened a location on South Buffalo because this location became so popular and it is super small. Which comes to my gripe with BabyStacks, not because there is a wait but because every time I go or call ahead to check the wait time, it is ALWAYS off sometimes in my favor, sometimes not but it drives me crazy. You may be busy but you are also turning people away. Get your table times in check. It's breakfast your table time should be about an hour, hour and half for a chatty table. You should be able to quote tables based on that time frame. I'll still visit but it is definitely not as often as I would like it to be because of this. \n\nMaybe another location on the East or Southeast side will spread the love out."

You could tell that the pancakes had been sitting out for a while because they weren't very warm and the whipped cream on top was pretty much a liquid by the time I got them.

We arrived around lunch time so there was a good amount of people when we arrived. We were seated, however, right away which definitely deserves an A+. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive the entire time. Food came out pretty quick so A+ for that as well.\nOn to the food... first the red velvet pancakes.. was I expecting red velvety battered goodness? Yes. Did I get it? No. They were pretty much pancakes with red food coloring topped with whipped cream and sprinkled with mini chocolate chips. Nothing mind blowing. The cream cheese syrup tasted like the icing you would find in a store bought cinnaroll can. Once again, nothing special. For me, total fail to the excitement I had before I actually tasted them.\nNow on to the saviour of this review... the adobo omellett. It was a hefty size. I was expecting more egg than filling but thankfully I was wrong. It was chockful of yummyness! The rice tossed with the adobo sauce and shredded chicken were delightful for my taste buds. The creamy side Mac salad was a great addition to the dish.\nAll in all I had an ok experience. I chose 3 stars based on the fact that I was expecting to have my taste buds blown away... but all I got was a fizzle. Maybe red velvet TASTING pancakes are like the loch ness monster... just a myth."

They are soo delicious. They're the perfect combination of a bit of chocolatey flavor & cream cheese. They were also very fluffy and light, but the edges had a little crispiness to them which was good.\n\nThe hash browns and eggs were yummy as well. The steak, however, wasn't all that. It had a very charred taste to it. I ordered it medium rare and there was very little pink to it. It was also very tough and hard to chew. I could have done without the steak.\n\nThe ambiance of the place was nice. It was very clean. I don't think they turn on the A/C though, which I didn't mind much but my friends did. They had ceiling fans running but I guess with that many people in one place, it tends to get a little warm. \n\nWe waited for about 20 minutes to get a table because it was so busy, this isn't a bad thing.. just shows how good this place is.

The coffee tasted watered down like they prepared it, dumped half of it out and refilled it with water, I could get a better tasting cup at McDonald's. For my breakfast entree I went with Cora's corned beef hash, eggs over medium, and substituted the buttermilk pancakes, instead I got the red velvet pancakes.\n\nFood came out quick as well, the corned beef hash was seasoned well, tasted great, but my eggs came out over easy instead of over medium. The red velvet pancakes were mighty tasty, very fluffy and a little crisp on the outside. They were topped off with whipped cream, which went well with the cream cheese syrup. After our food came out the waitress disappeared, we were to never see her again. We were never asked how the food was or if we wanted any refills. We are very generous tippers when we get great service, on this occasion I was thinking of not even leaving a tip but I'm not that rude, she got $3 for her disappearing act! \n\nHonestly, if it weren't for the food, I would have rated this place two stars, but since the food was great (minus the eggs), they get four from me."

They were chocolate pancakes with almond shavings, coconut, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream. I thought it was reeeeeally good because the chocolate pancakes weren't TOO chocolately as you would expect, I think it was the perfect amount of chocolately goodness. \n\nEveryone thinks the red velvet pancakes are amazing.. I beg to differ. They are just \"bleh\" to me, nothing special. I think the hype sells them. \n\nMy usual is the honey whole wheat pancakes. These pancakes have a different texture from the regular pancakes which I really enjoy and they're supposed to be more healthy.. hence the whole wheat --so it's the one I typically order. \n\nThe orange juice taste fresh squeezed. \n\nExpect 30-45 min wait times before being seated because this place is always busy!"

We ordered the red velvet pancakes (short stack), spam sliders with seasoned potatoes, cowboy omelet with hash browns and banana pancakes.\n\nI only truly loved the red velvet pancakes. Everything else was mediocre. The spam sliders were a letdown. It's was mostly egg with small bits of diced spam. We barely tasted any. \n\nService was decent. And they were fairly quick with our food considering how busy they were. \n\nThe restaurant itself is not that big. But it's definitely a bit more spacious than the original restaurant. \n\nI recommend trying this place for breakfast and ordering their red velvet pancakes. I'll definitely come back when i'm in the mood.  However be prepared to wait at least 30 mins during peak hours."

We used to travel clear across town to their location on the north side of Vegas just for their amazing Red Velvet pancakes. When we found out there was a new location on the west side of town and just minutes from our house we were sooooooo happy! From the Red velvet pancakes to the zippy's omelet, everything we've tried there has been amazingly delicious. Only drawback is the dining space is small and there is usually a wait, but some things are just worth waiting for! Try this place out. You will not be disappointed."

I know they are always busy and they won't miss our business, but we won't be returning to any of their locations. \n\nWe went to our normal Babystacks on Buffalo & Smoke Ranch, but the wait was 35-40 minutes.

She answered \"15-20 minutes.\"  I asked if she should could write our name down but she said no.  I explained that I was at their other location but the wait was too long, and I explained that we were driving straight over.  She still said no.  \n\nI understand that restaurants have their policies.  But I'm a business owner and I am a believer that customer loyalty and customer service trumps policies at time.  \n\nWe ended up driving over to the Buffalo/Flamingo location and by the time we got there, the wait was 40 minutes.  \n\nI was so disgusted that we took our business to Hash House Go Go and had a great breakfast."

The hostess was very pushy when asking where the rest of my party was when they were right outside of the door! I only found one waitress to be friendly (I forgot to ask for her name) As for the food we got the red velvet pancakes, adobo fried rice, and Mac salad. Their red velvet was just ok, I honestly think IHOP's is better. It just seemed a little cakey if you ask me. The adobo fried rice was just ok and a bit on the salty side. As for the Mac salad it had no taste, it was bland. I would rather have Aloha kitchens Mac salad. So with that being said I won't be going back anytime soon."

It's got a unique / filipino flair to it with their Portuguese sausage, adobo omelette thing (side note: it's not really an omelette). They had a special Kalua Pork Sliders or something like that when I was there.\n\nNearly everything comes with pancakes and they have a ton of different kinds from S'mores to Rocky Road to Banana Cream Pie to Red Velvet, etc. The list goes on, but your stomach will not. It's only $1.50 to upgrade your regular pancake order to one of their fancier ones...and I'd recommend that if I were you.\n\nI got the Mexican omelette ($9.25), which was awesome. It comes with 4 eggs in the omelette. It also has the option of either seasoned potatoes or hash browns...I opted for the hash browns on a spur of the moment decision, but I think I'd go for the seasoned potatoes next time. They're not huge pieces of dry potatoes, but really crispy, smaller pieces that make them perfect. I made that mistake, but you live and you learn. My friend got toast with her omelette...not sure if it was a side of toast or somehow it came with her meal, but when they give you toast, they don't mess around...she had 6 1/2 bread slices (so 3 whole slices for those not good at math). And they're huge pieces\n\nAnyways, it's about 5 miles off the strip, but definitely worth the drive for something a little more local and delicious and different."

Me and the hubby usually get eggs and bacon, which also comes with potatoes (I would recommend the hashbrowns) and toast/english muffin.  They have a kids menu, and for about $6 you get a small pancake, egg any style, potatoes, and a meat (sausage or bacon) - that's a pretty good deal for kids.  The pancakes usually look pretty good - if you like decadent pancakes, they definitely have those here!\n\nI would recommend getting there early though - none of their locations are really big, so if you get there too late, you'll end up waiting.\n\nOh, and I think they have pretty good coffee too - most restaurants I think have really strong and basic flavored coffee, but I've always thought that they have decent coffee here."

Undoubtedly a place where kitsch finds prominence but where classics and good diner-service also stand strong it was admittedly with much debate that decisions were made on a menu where no less than a dozen sweet selections and numerous interesting savories plus specials reside but with coffee free flowing a plan was eventually hatched - two sweets, one savory, yes bacon, no potatoes, and much sharing after a short wait.  Beginning savory and progressing to sweet I must say things started shaky with a small plate of $4 bacon and surprisingly bland pork lost to buttery bread and cheese but progressing to \"dessert\" the story turned one-eighty, the thin pancakes fluffy and rich but brought in check by light citrus while the French Toast pulled on no reigns, a full display of decadence with supple egg bread surrounding a slathering of Speculoos and drizzled with Nutella plus a half cup of whipped cream...more than enough to share and impetus for a trip to Centennial Hills to visit Babystacks III soon."

My husband had the club which was something he was craving and he was very satisfied. I have the blackened chicken sandwich and I was very good. The chicken was tender, the lettuce was crisp, the cheese was perfectly melted and the bread was just the right amount of toasted. The fries that came on the side were the ones that you would get at an old soda shop. They were thin but had a great flavor that I didn't need salt for."

For less than 2 bucks, you can upgrade regular pancakes to specialty.

Don't blame him so this weekend, a holiday weekend, he asks, \"Wanna go to breakfast?\" Um, YEAH! So off we go to wait somewhere for breakfast. I chose a no-egg-in-title-ergo-no-griddle-fry, breakfast joint, for this rare occasion. Been to Babystacks a couple years ago before the name change. It was good but mostly crowded, and we were suckered into ordering the red velvet pancakes. As pancakes go, they were good, but honestly, it was a mistake to order because not particularly a fan of red velvet because of the systematic abuse of red food coloring and fake chocolate flavor that occurred as a result of the trend that been red velvet in the last decade, as opposed to the light cocoa flavor it's supposed to have. This time, however, we partook in the Hawaiian-style brekkie (Moco Loco and Portuguese sausage and eggs w rice) as well as a skillet and of course many sides of many non-red velvet pancakes (banana cream pie, cookies and cream, lemon ricotta) plus a Nutella crepe. Suffice it to say, everything was delicious, not greasy, no odor of the dreaded griddle fry, and despite all the food ordered, we all left satisfied and not overly stuffed. There was a wait, but turn-around was efficient and quick as could be. Place was clean and friendly and did we mention no griddle fry? Btw, their red velvet pancakes are, in fact, good if you still like the trend, er...flavor. \n\nHim: The pancakes were soft and delicious. I ordered cookies and cream pancakes. They were so chocolatey. They came with cream and glaze, but I didn't even need the glaze. Also, I loved the skillet. It wasn't a scramble, just over-easy eggs on top, so there were saut\u00e9ed veggies underneath and they were so good. I couldn't stop eating them. There were potatoes, onion, peppers and mushroom and cheese. There was a wait but it felt like forever (it actually was about 20 mins after told 30). That is how good the place is: everyone wants to eat there so we had to wait forever. It was worth the wait. I would wait again millions more times for their pancakes and veggies."

With big portions, and great Hawaiian offerings, how could one go wrong here for breakfast? Oh, but I come for the panclocks! I had a morning date with my favorite 8 year old man Vince. Plus I owed him a good birthday breakfast so I had to make it count! The wait wasn't long at all. We were seated at a small table for two, but they were so accomodating to move us to a bigger table when my sister dropped in for breakfast last minute. \n\nVince ordered their orange creamsicle pancake (figures since his favorite color is after all orange.) After sampling a few bites, I would say that it tastes a lot like an orange creamsicle. The pancake is also orange. It is a fun choice for kids. the cream cheese and orange syrup was pretty delish and made for a good mix with the pancakes. \n\nI however, ordered the lemon ricotta. It is served with three crepe like thin pancakes and fresh lemon slices with cream cheese syrup. If you are a sweedish pancake fan or even a fan of tart and sweet...THIS IS THE PANCAKE FOR YOU! Oh..it was amazing. the pancakes were thin and soft, and the tart and sweetness combo made it just the right choice. the portions are big so you will get full fast.\n\nI also took bites of their nutella crepe which is loaded with nutella and are huge! If you love nutella or nutella crepe for that matter. do recommend theirs as well."

I believe the original location is on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch.  Although, the location that I frequent is the expansion branch on Buffalo and just south of Flaming-O.\n\nBaby Stacks, to me, falls into that Island-Style breakfast category that you can find at Cinnamon's and Boots & Kimo's on the Windward side of Oahu, nestled in beautiful Kailua.  This style consists of the normal comfort breakfasts including spam or pocho sausages with rice and eggs your way in addition to loco mocos, an island favorite.  But specialty benedicts and an elaborate pancake menu is now a common theme in island breakfasts.\n\nI usually get the kalua pork eggs benedict but opted for the grilled cheese kalua pork sandwich on special.  The sandwich was good, but more appealing to the eyeballs than the taste buds.  Also, I have this unquenchable appetite for Tabasco, sue me, and tend to douse my kalua pork and manapuas in it, I'm talking drowning...lol.  If it weren't for my spicy little friend, the meal could have been much worse.  A banana cream pie stack was added and by far my favorite aside from carrot cake pancakes so far.  The white chocolate mac nut is again more name than anything.  My lady went with the zesty chicken omelet and like most onomatopoeia, was exactly that...zesty.\n\nThe place is a hit, both locations, so be prepared to wait if you aren't there before the rush.  The place reminds me of home with smiles from local islanders, but, I know for a fact that a lot of mainlanders aren't big on it and the culture, so beware.  \n\nOtherwise, decor and ambiance is good and staff is friendly and attentive.  The check out dude has a Filipino accent and a little rough around the edges, so bare with him.  Parking is plentiful and although, not quite on the level of Cinnamon's, the place is definitely worth a look.\n\nThe sad thing is that there is no seafood related items on the menu, such as lox and the the like.  I know breakfast is not synonymous with fish, but I came here on a Friday during lent, and my selections were limited.  I had to settle for a spinach omelet and a short stack, but it didn't quell the monsters in my tummy.\n\nSo if you want some island style mornings grinds, craving for traditional breakfasts, or just looking for some sweets, this isn't a bad stop."

They also have regular eggs, omelets, french toast, etc. I presume the owners are Hawaiian as that seems to be the theme for some things...and there is a hefty Spam presence on the menu. \n\nI got Rick's Adobo Fried Rice which is basically a chicken fried rice burrito with omelet egg as the wrapper.

I had the pleasure of taking down a few cinnabun style today and I'm thinking of going back for more. Sweet icing on the top, cinnamon sprinkled throughout and just a few crumbled nuts on top, it was just like eating a cinnamon bun (Costanza style), but you get to dip it in syrup. Win. \n\nNot a sweets person and looking for eggs? Yea, they got that. They omelets are pretty standard and the hashbrowns are crunchy and not over-salted.

It appears to be a family owned establishment, and that showed by the warm, genuine welcome we received upon entering the front door. On a Sunday, BabyStacks was packed, but we were able to snag a table in about ten minutes. \n\nBabyStacks has a reputation for a robust menu featuring every pancake flavor you can think of, in addition to hearty breakfast classics that come with a unique Filipino touch. I wanted both sweet and savory in my belly before the journey home to San Diego, and, therefore, opted to have the Kalua Pork Benedict and a small order of the Carrot Cake Pancakes with cream cheese icing. \n\nThe Kalua Pork Benedict was amazing. The pork was succulent and flavorful. Loved the potatoes on the side. Unless you're a vegetarian, I challenge anyone to have a bite of this dish and not walk away happy. I enjoyed the Carrot Cake Pancakes, but I regretted not picking a different flavor. The pancakes were very good, but they weren't as moist as I was imagining them to be. On my next visit, I'm going to have the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes. \n\nMy breakfast companion opted for the Adobo Rice Omelette. An imaginative dish that worked on every level.

When we left around 2 PM there was no wait and the restaurant was pretty empty. Service was good, waiter checked in on us and refilled our waters without us asking. \n\nMy friend got the fried rice adobo which was too salty for her but she said the egg and some ketchup and hot sauce saved it. She also added the smores pancake on the side for $1.50 more. I got the kahlua pig Benedict with hash browns and it was definitely lacking some flavor. I had my friend try a piece and she agreed that It needed some hot sauce and salt. \n\nPortion sizes are big, especially if you're adding on a pancake! It's about the same size as their normal orders but instead of 3 or 6, you get 2. \n\nBrunch for 4 was $50 which isn't bad at all!\n\nI know babystacks is known for their pancakes so it was probably a mistake ordering things that weren't pancakes. We will stick to pancakes from now on."

This cafe spot serves a lot of different style of pancakes from banana to red velvet to s'mores! Yeah, s'mores and even rocky road! Seems more like dessert if you ask me. But, heck, why not have dessert for breakfast!\n\nI had the banana short stack pancakes with egg whites and home potatoes. It pretty good! No real complaints...only thing is that I felt I was eaten small french fries with the potatoes :p.\n\nThe red velvet pancakes my boyfriend got tasted like a flat cake lol...but then again, that's what a pancake is, somewhat.\n\nFriendly service, you get in and out quick, and the prices are reasonable."

We arrived around 11 on a Monday morning and even with a rush at that time there was little to no wait and it quieted down later that hour.  *Note: Your whole party must be present to be seated and parties of 2 get seated more quickly.\n\nI ordered a b.y.o. omelette (I ordered mine with Swiss cheese, spinach, and mushroom) which came with potatoes (you can order hash browns instead) and a short stack of omelettes.  For a small charge I upgraded my pancakes to the banana cream pie pancakes.  Everything I ordered was very tasty!  I had some of the white chocolate macadamia pancakes as well and must say I liked the banana cream pie pancakes better.  So glad I went with them after much deliberation!\n\nIt's a fairly short drive if you're staying on the Strip and there is ample parking in the lot.  They've got a couple of TV's inside which kept us entertained as Chippendales was on the morning news show that was playing ;)  Definitely worth checking out for a tasty breakfast!"

This new location has a shorter wait than the original store on weekends and it's much roomier so I prefer this store. \n\nI was the one who wanted to go here, but my friend who has a sweet tooth started getting more excited than me as he perused the menu. No surprise since the pancakes sound more like desserts than breakfast food. We ordered a few to try - red velvet tastes like dessert with marshmallow whipped cream and cream cheese syrup, while white chocolate and the others taste just like normal pancakes with fancy toppings. Also, the kalua pig benedict didn't taste like normal kalua pig so I wouldn't recommend it. \n\nStick with the red velvet pancake here. Expect it to taste like dessert.

My friend got it with eggs over medium, hashbrowns, and macadamia nut pancakes. My other friend got it with eggs over medium, potatoes, and lemon ricotta pancakes. There was no talking at breakfast. And every morsel was eaten. So incredibly flavorful and delicious!\n\nThey also bring you a smorgasburg of hot sauces with your food - you don't even have to ask. The menu is extensive and they have all sorts of pancakes and specialties (our neighbor table got the Kalua Pig Benedict and the Loco Moco and was raving about it).\n\nService was great! Restaurant was super clean and a chill, mom and pop ambiance. If you make a reservation, they won't seat you unless your whole party is there -so respect the rule.

My bf ordered a full size Banana Cream Pie pancake (ordered this since we saw a lot of people raving about it) with Portuguese sausage on the side. \n\nCorned beef hash was good but the garlic rice was a disappointment. It had more onions than garlic. I hardly tasted any garlic in it. My banana cream pie pancake was good at first until I came across some uncooked batter at the bottom. \n\nMy bf didn't like the banana cream pie pancake since it was too dense for him. We both like fluffy pancakes. The Portuguese sausage was very good but it tasted like the ones we buy packed at the grocery store. It was not made in-house.\n\nMaybe next time we will try something else if we ever come back."

If you let the whip cream melt for a bit before eating your french toast/pancake, it is definitely worth it! \n\nThe one thing I wished for was that the location was bigger. There was a tremendous amount of people waiting and it was about a 45-minute wait for three which is pretty excessive for a brunch place. \n\nOverall, I was highly satisfied with BabyStacks and can not wait to come back on my next trip to Vegas!

My husband said \"do you have a table\" and she looked around and said \"uh, no.\" Guess we'll take the counter then! After that the service was good and food came out quickly. I like that the omelets came with pancakes and you have the option to upgrade to one of the crazy flavors. I got the red velvet because of all the reviews and DANG! They were great. They're popular for good reason. The omelet was fine, for some reason they put the cheese on the outside. Whatever. The hash browns were really good, maybe a little soggy but I was into it."

We loved this place so much we came here twice during our one week vacation here in Vegas. \n\nOn both of our visits the place was crowded, but we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Service was friendly and fast. From the time we placed our order to the time we got our food, probably was only about 10 minutes. \n\nEverything we ordered was soo good! The spam scramble w/garlic fried rice, cookies and cream pancakes, adobo fried rice, bananas foster pancakes, kalua pork grilled cheese and spam and eggs were all equally delicious!  Whether you are in the mood for sweet or savory, you can't go wrong with any of the dishes. \n\nJust to highlight on a few:\n1) The garlic fried rice is quite tasty!  Just like how my mom used to make it. Lots of garlic flavor, just enough salt and even some bits of the rice is crunchy. I like my rice like that, brings back childhood memories. \n\n2) The Kalua pork grilled cheese was delish! The pork was smoky and had the perfect amount of saltiness to it. The Muenster and cheddar cheese made this grilled cheese oozing with cheesy goodness. \n\n3) Bananas foster pancakes - saving the best for last! My mouth is salivating as I'm writing about these pancakes!  The pancake alone is fluffy and has great flavor. The brown sugar butter combo serves as the syrup in this dish, thank goodness. It has the right amount of sweetness and the bananas was caramelized perfectly. \n\nI could keep going on, but you must try this place out for yourselves!!"

The pancakes are delicious and creative, but a lot of places have delicious and creative pancakes. You will never show up here and not have to wait a minimum of 30 minutes for a table, so the sole reason that I suffer the wait is that it's the only place I can get garlic rice. And it's GOOD garlic rice. Today I joined a few friends for brunch. We met at 12:30, were seated around 1, and unfortunately got the table next to the window. And the air conditioning was apparently broken. It was 108 outside and at least 150 inside. At one point, Satan stopped by our table to ask how the food was. Ok, I may have hallucinated the Satan part, as I was in full on heat stroke. It was difficult to enjoy the meal with all the sweat that was dripping into it. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the employees back in the hot kitchen. In the Las Vegas summer, you have to put more effort into temperature control. If I'm waiting 30 minutes for a table, I expect you're bringing in enough revenue to invest in a couple fans at least. I don't feel so well after sitting there sweating."

The other tables all around us got immediate service the whole time. I found out our waitress was supposed to be Cassandra. When I asked her for help, she was extremely rude and gave me a ton of excuses of why she didn't help us. She never came back to the table after that. Our food was delivered by someone else and we were eventually checked on by a different person. I realized that we were the only white people in the entire place and it's extremely sad to think that this is why we were ignored and everyone else was helped.

Excellent food. \n\nUpgrade your order to a baby stack on your side pancakes and you will be in heaven! I ordered the Country Fried Steak and Eggs w/ seasoned potatoes and side stack of Red Velvet cakes.  YUM, YUM, YUM! I decided long and hard after mulling over the menu that I needed to have my savory and sweet! Country gravy was made with real ham and not at all heavy.  More creamy and just the perfect amount smeared on the steak.  The potatoes are so good! Like little steak fries! And probably the best part was the Red Velvet Stacks! So incredibly light and tasty, just like a cupcake except topped off with homemade whip cream and dusted with some chocolate shavings! OUR mistake to not include the cream cheese sauce it arrived with was disheartening but I may go without again.  \n\nHubbs ordered the massive Rick's rice and Egg omlet and it was HUGE! Super tasty too! Never thought that combo of rice inside a massive omlet could be so good. I think that the macaroni salad tasted almost like kimchi and so I could not wrap myself around it.  I was very impressed with the selection of brunch items and the array of stacks that they offer.  I will be back and probably never be able to lose weight because of you, BabyStacks!"

She recommended it to me, as it is the original BabyStacks Cafe in Las Vegas.\n\nI ordered their Banana Cream Pie pancakes and the Hawaiian-like combo order, which I don't remember the name of, that consisted of Spam, eggs cooked to order (I got my usual scrambled), white garlic rice and furikake (rice seasoning of Japan). The breakfast definitely reminded me of what I typically eat for breakfast, as I really love Spam! Spam was good, although I should have asked to have them cooked longer to brown them - my Spam was just cooked and hot (which isn't particularly bad). The rice could have been made better as it was more moist than I usually have white rice. The pancakes were really good, but the bananas weren't as fresh - soggy, brown was how they were presented to me. I think that the pancakes were definitely sweet enough to go with the banana cream pie part and didn't require any syrup of any kind.\n\nI also tried my cousin's red velvet pancakes with the cream cheese syrup. It was VERY red in color (I don't think they should put that much color in there), but it turned out to taste really well and not have an artificial taste. Usually with a bright color, I associate that with artificial taste, but this was not the case for the pancakes.\n\nOverall, I would definitely come back here again, so I can try all the other flavors of pancakes they have! The price per person was definitely matching the quality and portion of food! I recommend this place to anyone visiting Las Vegas, or any locals!"

I have to say the red velvet pancakes are not overrated! I am not big on sweets and I couldn't get enough of them! I did get extra cream cheese sauce and they do charge you for it, but it was so worth it. It was so delicious! My daughters banana pancakes were very tasty as well. \n\nThe omelette was good, too.

You left me no out.  5 out of 5 it is.\n\n  The people have spoken.  And they said they want red velvet pancakes from Baby Stacks Cafe.  So who am I to argue?  For my first trip to this highly recommended breakfast stop, I got the velvet short-stack along with a side of scrambled eggs and a glass of milk.  Very basic.\n\nFOOD:  The short-stack was 3 smaller thick pancakes, which was just right for me to feel full but not disgusted with myself.  I've never had red velvet pancakes, but why haven't I heard of this sooner?!  It's one of the most delicious things on earth.  The perfect sweetness, texture, toppings - man, I just can't do these things justice.  Trust me when I say they are straight from heaven.  \n\nSERVICE: The only thing sweeter than my short-stack was my server.  \"Yvette\" I believe was her name, a young Hawaiian-looking girl with the happiest attitude without a hint of fakeness.  She was smiley, quick to greet and take my order, always asking if there was anything else she could do, checking up on me just right.  And my food came out ridiculously quick.  I was pleasantly impressed!\n\nDECOR:  The restaurant is fairly small, but cozy, clean, refreshing, and new in appearance.  You can tell someone took pride in it.  The small bar style seating area was neat.  There was a TV.  Soothing, light, uplifting music.  Very nice colors, plants, decorations, new furniture (tables and booths) and overall just extremely well taken care of.\n\nI honestly can't find a single negative thing to say.  It was such a nice breakfast.  They really earned my stingy 5 star rating!  I wish it was next door to my apartment!"

We're so over the usual stuff and just wanted to find a good breakfast that wasn't on the strip.  We Yelpers know that some of the best food can be found off the beaten path, right?  So my trusty Yelp App not only roped me in with an eye catching menu that had pancake choices like Smores, Banana Creme Pie, Red Velvet (cue eye pop here) but it also told me that this place is about 15 minutes from our hotel.  Sweet!  Off we go in our rental.\n\nProbably because we went on a weekday, we didn't experience a lengthy wait as mentioned in the other reviews.  During the 5 minutes we did have to hang out, I noticed the clean, casual & laid back surroundings with a bit of an island touch.  Cute butterflies everywhere.  I also saw the specials on the board and I knew I was in for a dilemma.  Almond Joy pancakes?  Orange creamsicle pancakes?  I asked for a menu to have an early look but by that time we were ready to be seated.\n\nI got the Lemon Ricotta pancakes.  It only comes in one size, and the order was HUGE.  The cream cheese syrup made each bite delightfully sweet and really went with the lemony, fluffy pancake. My leftovers: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RIYUD4i-_sPDH597B92DXg&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg\n\nThe huzbeau ordered the Kalua Pork Eggs Benedict.  I liked my pancakes, but I was coveting his plate the whole time.  The pork was tender and nicely salted with perfectly poached eggs.  I've never had this rendition of Eggs Benedict before and its a work of genius!  If it were me though, I'd throw in some spam in there (which I did order on the side; comes with two slices).  Note to self for the next time.  And I'm definitely getting my own. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wgy9HFmRWyhY8IupO76RHw&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg\n\nThe Keikis enjoyed a short stack of Almond Joy pancakes (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RziSeEnGuGZ-SfEMFhZXrg&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg) and the combo meal that came with bacon, hash browns, eggs and a red velvet baby stack (no picture, sorry...my little girl inhaled it).  \n\nEverything was delicious.  We may have ventured off the strip, but we made our own smorgasbord here.  Service was sufficiently friendly and there is plenty of parking.  We will definitely be back when we visit this area again!"

There are several unique items on their menu you won't find at other breakfast places (like Portuguese sausage). The pancakes-- as mentioned in just about every review here, the red velvet pancakes are amazing...but honestly you can't go wrong on any of their specialty pancakes. I will say that the service is not great and a few of their policies aren't the friendliest (no seating until your whole party has arrived, no splitting checks), but these drawbacks are more than made up for in the food, which is my ultimate reason for going to a restaurant! I will gladly put up with mediocre service so long as the food is great, which it assuredly is at Babystacks."

Very busy place , had a 25 min wait but with all the hype I had to wait. It was well worth it. The food and came out quick and was fresh ad great. Only bad thing about this whole Experience is that the service was not that great at all. Server greeted us took out order and than dropped off drinks and food were the only times she was at our table really. Noticed there was only two servers on the floor at the time I was there. Other than that everything was awesome!"

Everything was delicious!! If you're looking a hearty, comforting Hawaiian-fusion-brunch, try Babystacks!!"

I decided to mix things up and get the corn beef hash which turned out to be a mediocre meal. Remember to upgrade your meal to get the speciality pancakes for about $2 is totally worth it. Dont forget to upgrade to garlic rice if your meal doesn't include adobo fried rice. They have a great selection of specialty made pancakes but known for their red velvet pancakes. I'm a big chocolate fan so I'll try to get a chocolate based pancake. \n\n\nFyi it's a breakfast place and they normally close at 2 pm!! They will not seat you until all of your party is present and will split credit cards checks."

And he was right, they really are.\n\nWe came around 1 in the afternoon, so we avoided the typical breakfast/brunch/lunch rush hours. We were seated immediately and received good service throughout. Nothing super, but solid.\n\nAs soon as I looked at the variety of pancakes on the menu and on the specials board, I got excited. So many choices! I ended up going with an omelette with chili verde on it to go with 2 peanut butter and banana pancakes. The omelette itself was OK; it had all the elements of an omelette, but wasn't particularly fluffy. It was solid. The pancakes, though, were great! I am a sucker for both peanut butter and bananas, so maybe it wasn't that hard to impress me, but nonetheless, they were delicious. I also tried my friend's pancakes banana foster, which were one of the daily specials. He had ordered a large stack of pancakes (6 pancakes) and was overwhelmed by what came out. Those pancakes were pretty tasty and were pretty much like dessert.\n\nWhat really interested me when I went to the restroom was the spam sandwich on a sweet roll that I saw in a newspaper review of BabyStacks. I'll be coming back, and that will most likely be what I order.\n\nSolid breakfast/brunch destination; I'll definitely come back when I'm in Vegas."

This time around there was no wait on a Monday morning. The interior is fairly large -- much larger than the first location, I'm told -- with several large TVs scattered around the room. For single diners, there's a bar to sit at.\n\nThe red velvet pancakes that everyone talks about is as good as advertised. Rich, chocolatey, cakey, but not too dense or sweet to make you think you're eating dessert at 8 in the morning. Apparently, it's a home-made recipe not a prepackaged mix. Topped with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and cream cheese syrup, it's one of the better breakfast items I've had.\n\nAs much as I'd like to order it again, there are so many other delicious sounding items on the menu to try. With this place just minutes from my house, I'm sure I'll have the opportunity to make my way through all of them."

Also got a short stack of banana creme pancakes. \n\nBest choice was the pancakes! Omgahh. The banana cream on those things was heavenly. It was just like eating a piece of pie and they fluffiness of the pancakes really balanced it well. Overall it was not too sweet which made it easy to keep eating. They also give you a heaping amount of whip cream.\n\nThe other two dishes were kinda meh. Im not a huge fan of egg things so thats my fault really. The adobo fried rice was good on its own but the egg it was wrapped in had no seasoning or flavor so I had to pick it apart. The eggs benedict were not poached very well and was a bit overdone and the huge glob of hollandaise sauce on top made me stop after like two bites. \n\nOverall if youre going to come here stick to the pancakes. They are heavenly. Next time I think ill try the red velvet pancakes everyone is raving about."

Pancake choice was rocky road short stack, which I didn't love (but it was still good) because the chocolate overpowered the almonds and marshmallows. \n\nThe coffee was a basic weaker brew and the tea only green or black.

And red velvet is hipster. But that's ok, that's why I came here too. I'm not a lover of pancakes,  but I am a lover of these. They're tastier than regular pancakes and topped with a house-whipped whipped cream and chocolate chips. And who can complain about a cream cheese \"syrup\"? Its painfully sweet, but in a good way. Order it alongside some savory items and you will have the perfect meal to please your palette. Get a full-stack if your hungry, short stack if you wanna nibble.\n\nKAHLUA PIG BENEDICT: I love me some eggs benedict. And when its mixed up with some creativity I'm all for it. This was pretty good. Not great! But I was happy with how it tasted. The shredded pork and cabbage mixture could've used a little more flavor though. Spices are your friend Babycakes... Cheese and Egg yolk alone cannot flavor up a whole dish. I finished the leftovers the following morning. It tasted even better to-go once the flavors had settled and melded together!\n\nVARIETY: The menu is quite large. All the usual breakfast combos and classics like loco moco are orderable. So many dishes look so delectable!\n\nI'm very particular about paying mark-ups for breakfast food. But this time, the restaurant lived up to the hype.

Firm whites, runny yolk...I'm drooling a little remembering how amazing it is.  \n\nThe hazelnut pancakes were great too..although they were a tiny bit dry,  but I find that most pancakes are unless I drown them in butter and syrup.

I discovered how much I love the rest of their unique pancake flavors and the variety on their menu. They have very traditional breakfast/lunch platters, mixed with some dishes you'd only expect to see in Hawaiian restaurants (like Loco Moco or an Adobo Fried Rice Omelette). Whatever you choose, I hope it lives up to your standards as it has for me. It's affordable, the space is cute and quaint, and the staff is very friendly and attentive with every visit I've had. There is usually a wait time, but never one that is unbearable. If it's ever more than 30 minutes until you can be seated, they'll take down your number and call or text you when there is a table available.\n\nThe only downfall is if you don't live in the Summerlin area. That is my only real complaint, if you could really call it that. It's quite a drive for me, but each time I've gone it has been worth it."

Not only I got what I want, it was delicious. (But that's usual) this is the best breakfast spot and the service is always welcoming. \nTip: they give military discounts and come in before 11am or you will be waiting for min 30 mins for a seat.

But nobody likes a liar, so I had to be honest and give this place its proper due.\n\nWent with a large party, as a group we ordered nearly half the items on the menu, and then I stuffed my mouth with (stole) off every single plate that hit the table-- it was all amazing. I had the portuguese sausage and eggs with a short stack of red velvet pancakes (I could drink the CREAM CHEESE SYRUP by itself). \n\nPros: HUGE variety, so many creative pancake choices (red velvet, carrot cake, white choc macadamia nut, rockry road), clean environment, trendy (yet unassuming) atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, reasonable prices.\n\nCons: They don't have a location in Southern California."

The service was friendly, the place had a good islander vibe (reminded me of Hawaii), and the menu had something for everyone from many varieties of pancakes, French toast, omelettes, and breakfast combos. As for the food, well let me just say it was amazingly delicious!!! \n\nI ordered the spam, eggs, and potatoes with pancakes. And of course I upgraded those bad boys to the banana cream pancakes. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach and I wasn't able to finish. But I had to try both. The spam juicy and cooked just right, the eggs were done the way I like, and the potatoes were yummy. Everything had good flavor and paired well together. The banana cream pancakes was so rich and like a dream you don't want to end. It tasted just like pie, with a buttermilk pancake crust. Sooo good, and worth trying. \n\nMy wife ordered the shredded pork and rice omelette with a short stack of rocky road pancakes. She loved it and couldn't finish her meal as well. Had some bites and I must say what we both ordered was flavorful and a good filling breakfast. \nGood portion breakfast plates, delicious pancakes, good coffee, friendly service, and worth trying."

I got a skillet, husband got a benedict, neither one of us got pancakes since we try to eat low-carb these days.  The portion size was just adequate for me, husband left hungry.  I felt like the plating was designed to hide how little meat was on your plate.  The coffee was not bad, but I noticed they are quicker to refill at first than later, they pretty clearly were trying to get people to finish eating and leave quickly.  Even though there were empty tables around as we were eating, and nowhere near closing time.  That, along with the spartan, crammed-in atmosphere, tacky signs, and lack of warmth, is a bit off-putting.  I would probably come here again, since the food wasn't bad, but there are so many decent cheap breakfast places around the neighborhood that I might never bother.  Rather eat somewhere less stingy."

We finally decided to try the skillets and pancakes. our table was very wobbly and as I uncrossed my legs I bumped the table and coffee went everywhere (great morning so far). my cup had a smear of lipstick on it and when I mentioned it to a waitress she told me it was okay (as if I had made a mistake) and asked another waiter for a \"fresh cup\". I'm really hoping she just didn't hear me. That waiter got me a fresh cup and put some sugar packets under the leg of the table to even it out. I finally get to try my coffee and it's very bland. As I set my cup down I notice some pink stuff on the side and I scraped it off with my nail- it was crusted on- great just great. So, no coffee for me. If you've ever been to an Ihop this is no different. Maybe they were having a bad day. Oh and my husband mentioned the women's bathroom was out of order so everyone had to use the men's and he said it pretty messy. Needless to say we will not return:("

Every table except one two seater was full.  It was too crowded to easily walk through, but in had a pleasant vibe.  It must be said I DO NOT like pancakes.  My husband ordered cinnabon pancakes and I ordered pumpkin pancakes with a side of homefries.  Ordering was a challenge as the employees were standing in front of the specials board and we couldn't read it.  Breakfast came out in a timely manner.  The pancakes were smaller than I expected for the price.  The syrups that came out were also very small.  We bother requested regular syrup on the side.  The white icing style syrup that came with mine was AWESOME and the highlight of the trip.  My husband was disappointed with his meal bc the pancakes were too small and stacked poorly on the plate so the syrup ran off the side.  The homefries were good, similar in flavor to the Egg and I.

The cream cheese syrup was absolutely delicious!! My new favorite way of having syrup! Genius!\n\nAlright, stop reading this review and go order already! This place is great and I'm definitely coming back whenever I visit!"

For a place that serves \"hawaiian\" style food, their rice was like \"minute / jasmine\" rice. \nI wish I had asked our busser (since he looked like he could've been from Hawaii) if he would've eaten the rice. I'm positive he would've said 'NO'. Al dente, hard on the exterior like its been sitting out too long and not appetizing at all. \nGet potatoes. You're better off. \nAs for the rest of the food, I had a spam scramble - not enough furikake. Pancakes were good and fluffy. \nPlease just fix the rice!!! Trust me it's gross."

It's pretty normal.  They had pancakes, and omelettes and other normal breakfast item.  I ordered the eggs and sausage that came with pancakes and seasoned potatoes or other items.  I paid $1.50 upcharge for the specialty pancakes.  What's the point of going to Babystacks to get regular pancakes.  I ordered the s'mores which were really good.  They have white chocolate chips, marshmallows and little bits of graham cracker shavings.

We waited for about 10-15 minutes (party of six) and were seated with our drinks taken care of somewhat promptly. All was well...then we placed our orders...that's when my frustration with this place grew. I base my reviews on the quality of the food first, then the service, then ambiance. With regards to service, I want to see that my glass of water is refilled before being emptied and not having to summon a waiter to refill the glass...and for a breakfast place to ensure my cup of coffee is promptly refilled. Well, the coffee wasn't refilled before I could see the bottom of the cup. On top of that, the waitress got our orders messed up once the food finally arrived after a 35 minute wait! 35 minutes! Waiting for our food for 35 minutes from the time we ordered! Unacceptable. The only redeeming quality was that the food was actually pretty good. Everyone on our table liked what they had and were willing to overlook the long wait...I wasn't. If it wasn't for the decent food, I would have given this place 2 stars or 1 star. Our party tried Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, Portuguese Sausage and Eggs, and Velvet pancakes, among other things\n\nReally, BabyStacks...35-minute wait for breakfast food? What, you had to coax the chickens out back to push a little harder for some eggs?"

I decided to ditch the casino brunch buffets and check out what the ninth island was all about.\n\nOf course this joint was far away from the strip inside a shopping area.  This restaurant is tiny!  Thanks for placing the host station right next to the checkout counter and making me confused about which line is which!\n\nThe wait was around 20 minutes, plenty of time to look through the menu.  There were lots of variations of kalua pork, but once I saw the Zippy's chili skillet the search was over.\n\nI ordered it without cheese in hopes to preserve the chili taste, but when it came out I knew just by the look it was not MY Zippy's chili.  I at least expected the skillet potatoes to be smothered in this imposter chili, but no, I had to dig around them to get a scrape of meat.\n\nEven the garlic fried rice was messed up.  How could you do that?  Oh yeah, put huge pieces of onion in it, bam!  The Portuguese sausage was at least fine.  You can't screw that up unless you order the wrong kind of sausage or attempt to pack it yourself.  Probably the only win was the red velvet pancakes.  It was really like a moist cake and the sauce was sweet and thick.\n\nWhen I return I will probably try other things.  Despite my visit this still isn't a place to pass up just yet.  Anything with that Hawaiian touch is worth a try!"

Or, if you're a fan of pretending to be British and having afternoon tea, order the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes.  They're crepe-thin with an elegant lemony flavor, and the sides of fresh lemons, cream cheese syrup (way tastier than it sounds,  trust me) and powdered sugar are served prettily arranged on a delicate lacy plate.  You'd expect to pay extra for these fun dishes, but the price compares favorably to chain brunch places, with most entrees items in the $8-12 range.  \n\nI probably won't be back to Vegas for a bit, but when I return, I know where I'll be having brunch!"

This past weekend was when my cravings arose, so I thought I'd get my red velvet pancakes fix from BabyStacks because I've heard so many positive things about the place. \n\nSERVICE\nI didn't dine at the restaurant, but I ordered breakfast to-go. The woman who took my order told me it would take 15 minutes. Not a prob. I swung by the place 20 or so minutes later to pick up my food. When I arrived, the hostess took out each of the containers of food one by one and showed me each of their contents. All the food I ordered was there. I complimented the hostess on how thorough she was in showing me the food, because I've been to restaurants where I've ordered take-out and arrived home only to discover I'm missing something. She informed me that it's part of the restaurant's policy to do this, in order to ensure that customers receive what they're paying for (I wish more restaurants would follow this example).\n\nFOOD\n+ Red Velvet Pancakes: I ordered the short stack becauseI was unsure how large the pancakes are. The short stack is three pancakes with whipped cream, chocolate crumbles, and cream cheese syrup. Everything was amazing, especially that cream cheese syrup! (I could take several shots of these, but I have my dignity). These red velvets definitely blow away Grand Lux's giant stacks that I can't finish on my own. \n\n+ Sausage and Eggs: Comes with toast, eggs, and then your choice of bacon or sausage, hash browns, and another side that I unfortunately can't remember at the moment. My friend ordered sourdough bread, scrambled eggs, bacon, and hash browns. He loved everything about his order, and the evidence was the empty containers. \n\nOVERALL\nI would love to dine-in at BabyStacks Cafe next time. Service is wonderful and the food is great.

There are a few reasons for this:   1) My lactose intolerance limits a lot of the cheesy/milky items I would normally want to order, and I don't like starting my day with an angry tummy.   2) I usually don't have time (weekdays) or motivation (weekends) to really go anywhere to grab something.  On this Sunday, I had to drop off a friend who had a little too much to drink last night as well as a tux rental to Men's Wearhouse, and decided it seemed like a good day to try a breakfast place I'd heard a lot about.  You know, carpe diem and all that.\n\nUpon walking into Babystacks, I wasn't surprised to see a large crowd sitting around waiting for a table, and we signed in and were told it'd be a 15-25 minute wait.  Quick sidenote: While we were seated near the door, my friend pointed out a black widow spider crawling along the floor that went underneath our bench.   I did the good Samaritan deed and promptly stood up and switched seats.  It looked harmless, really.  \n\nOnce seated I ordered an orange juice which I'd forgotten was so expensive when eating out.  I naturally ordered a full order of Red Velvet pancakes, because if I'm going to blow up my insides with lactose goodness, I'm going all the way.  A short time later I was presented with a beautiful plate of 6 huge, red pancakes with the fixings.  The first bite was heaven, and 15 minutes later, the last bite was heaven.  I can't really add anything that probably hasn't already been said about them.   The rumors are true, the hype is justified, the pancakes are freaking delicious.\n\nNext time I would switch it up and probably just get a 1/2 order with some side order of something savory.  The couple next to us ordered some sort of skillet or plate with some lovely pieces of cooked animal flesh that were really disarming to me as I continuously shoved my mouth full of candy in pancake form.   Yes, next time I need bacon with my candy.\n\nService was fine, though it did take a little while for the waitress to take our order after we got our drinks.  Obviously it was packed so I was understanding of it, and once the food arrived, no complaints.  The prices are very reasonable.  \n\nNow I just need one closer to my house that delivers, and breakfast can be making a strong case for being #2 after dinner."

It was also my mom's birthday... I love everything red velvet and had to have the pancakes, however the Cinnabon ones were also ones we wanted to try. So we got short stacks of both. In addition we split the Spinach and Bacon Eggs Benedict. The Benedict came with a choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes. I am pretty sure that most of the food is typical Sysco food, I'm not even sure the hollandaise is freshly made. With that said however, the Benedict was delicious. I ate one potato and pushed them aside, should have ordered the hash browns. We did have a ton of food though so it wasn't like I was starving for more food. \nNow to the pancakes. I made the mistake of not telling our server to put everything on the side as they put so much whipped cream(fresh homemade) and powdered sugar and some chocolate dust. I removed all the toppings and went for the bottom one. I liked the pancake, it was cooked perfectly, super fluffy and warm. I was not so thrilled with the \"icing\" it needed more of a cream cheese flavor because it settled at the bottom. I liked it but I didn't love it. I had a bite of the Cinnabon pancake, although too sweet for me I liked it better. It didn't need any syrup because it had the icing already on it and the pecans made it crunchy and perfect. Again it was a perfectly cooked pancake. \nMy mom would give this place 4... And a 5 just for the pancakes. I can't. Looking around at the egg dishes, they looked so generic and again, like Sysco food products. \nI'd say if you want fantastic pancakes go there, but if you want eggs then pass."

The touristy thing would have been to stay on the strip for breakfast, but after seeing all of the pictures of red velvet pancakes, i couldn't resist.  I applaud Babystacks for providing a half and full stack option, there is nothing worse than feeling full and sad for wasting all of that food.  I ordered the half stack and i love how they embodied the essence of  red velvet cake.  They could have been lazy and served the pancakes with maple syrup, instead they came up with a genius way of incorporating the cream cheese element into a sauce.  When it arrived to the table i was unsure of the look of the sauce, but after tasting it, it was delicious, a wonderful accompaniment to the lightest pancakes. I also ordered a side of turkey bacon at it was fab.  \nOverall, Babystacks is a very humble restaurant serving dynamite food, and i look forward to coming back and trying more pancakes on my next visit."

This last visit, Nicole was our waitress at the bar top, and she was so nice!\n\nMy friend Jeff ordered the Portuguese Sausage & Eggs, upgraded to garlic rice (additional $1.00), and had a side of red velvet pancakes - must try!!\n\nI ordered a veggie omelette; there's one already pre-selected on the menu or you can build your own. The omelette comes with a side of fruit or breakfast potatoes and your choice of toast.\n\nThey have a big selection to choose from on their menu and their portions are big. This is a great spot if you're a local. You're taste buds will thank you!! \n\nJust a little FYI: They won't seat you unless you're entire party has arrived and they don't split checks."

Once I actually tasted the pancakes, my spirits kinda fell. I mean, they were good, but they werent very red-velvety.. like they were just regular red pancakes with delicious cream cheese frosting. Still good but not what I expected. I also got the kalua pork benedict which was done very good however overall as a breakfast place, I would not come back. Their breakfast choices and taste just weren't enough to keep me thinking about it afterwards nor did the red pancakes make a big impression."

I was told that it was a 20 minute wait for a table for 3, which I was fine with- but after 35 mins, I asked if I had been called and maybe I didn't hear it- but then when the hostess looked at her list, they had seated TEN tables after my name which were 2 seaters and a FIVE table. I understand that the hostesses can't magically make tables appear or kick people out, so I figured- we waited this long- what's a few more minutes right??? but finally after 50 minutes total- we were able to sit down. The waitress came to take our order and someone else came to drop off the food- but when they dropped off the food we got our eggs first, then pancakes later then bacon last... Nothing came at the same time LOL! When we needed silverware, napkins, our missing coffee that never came, and water refills we had to flag down people. For as good as the food is there, we won't be going back due to poor service... We only stayed bc my dad was SUPER hungry and had to go to work right after..."

After about 30 minutes, we were finally seated. I noticed a few things that they could improve on right away. The hostess was rather cold, when people are waiting for extended periods of time for a table, kindness and a smile go a long way. They also have a very small counter area, which I assumed was an option when you placed your name on the list. To my surprise, two couples walked in and went right to the counter! They didn't even tell us that it was first come first served, you don't have to add your name to the list for counter seating! Again, they need to get better control over that because we were not the only group that was upset when we realized this. We waited 30 minutes and two couples walked right in and sat down.They should have everyone add their name to the list and then offer the counter as it becomes available.\n\nNow, onto the food! I got a short stack of their famous red velvet pancakes! As stated by many other yelpers, they were so dreamy! They were moist, delicious, and the cream cheese syrup was divine. They are a little sweet, but not so much that you feel like you are eating cupcakes for breakfast. The short stack was the perfect size, I cleaned my plate but I was definitely full. I was also able to sneak a bite of my husband's banana cream pie pancakes, which were just as tasty.\n\nI was also lucky enough to try their Kalua pig Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was out of this world and worked very well with the rest of the dish. The shredded pork and cabbage were fantastic and overall the dish was very well balanced. They also have delicious seasoned potatoes and hash browns that seem simple but are a really flavorful accompaniment.\n\nOverall, the food is fantastic! I love the way that they designed the menu, almost everything you order comes with pancakes. Unfortunately, they have a few kinks to work out, but the food is so worth the wait. I wish they would open a location in Henderson so I could work them into my weekend brunch routine!"

Found this place on Yelp, apparently known for its pancakes. Not that I'm a huge pancake person, but I was with someone who is picky and flapjacks is one of the few things he eats, so pancake house we went.\nWe were there before 9am on Saturday and got ourselves a table right away. I saw a few seasonal pancake specials on the board (ex. Pumpkin pancakes). I was trying to get into a pancake mood... but then I realize I may have stumbled on something special. But before I got too excited then highly disappointed, I asked if the ENTIRE menu up for grab that morning, AND the waitress said YES!  \nMy friend, they have Spam Scramble served with rice and a side. SPAM SCRAMBLE! There was no need to even consider anything else. I decided to try their garlic rice instead of plain white rice. I chose a side of macaroni salad. I even ordered a side of their \"country gravy\" (think thick brown gravy).  Best $7.95 (plus $1 for garlic rice and $0.75 for gravy) ever spent on breakfast.\nNOW - be warned, they aren't messing with the garlic. I could have fought Dracula himself with the amount of garlic I had on my breath. But it was good. The eggs were fluffy, mixed in were chunks of Spam-goodness. They sprinkled a little of furikake all over. At the end I mixed in some of the gravy with the rice. It was legit.\nHighly recommend this place, and by gosh, not just for the pancakes!"

In a sort of run down strip mall and all the signs (on Xerox paper with highlighter) plastered all over their doors and hostess table are very off putting. The signs pretty much say one of two things: they will not seat parties until the entire party arrives and they will not split checks. I don't really have a problem with the first (lots of places only seat entire parties) it is more the way they convey the message. Just kind of rude/bossy. But the no splitting checks thing just baffles me. I can't remember the last time (ever?!) I've been to a place that won't do it. \n\nThe menu is huge. So many different types of pancakes! Every flavor under the sun. They have savory items too, but really the pancake choices seem like what 9/10 people order. Normally I am not a huge sweet breakfast fan. I much prefer savory, but, when in Rome... \n\nSo I got the short stack of Red Velvet pancakes with chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup. Definitely could qualify as dessert more than breakfast! The pancakes were very good! Fluffy and had a great red velvet flavor. Surprisingly, I enjoyed them more than I expected. I couldn't even finish the short stack though because they were pretty rich. \n\nService was fine. Nothing bad, but nothing memorable either. \n\nI think just maybe classing up the way they convey their (kind of annoying) policies could bump them up to 4 stars for me. A little more polish could go a long way."

I like the menu options with the standard breakfast fare and a large selection of Hawaiian fusion breakfast items like the adobo omelette, loco moco, spam omelette, kahlua pig eggs benedict, and portuguese sausage.  They also have a large variety of pancake options, all which are cooked perfectly.  Babystacks has breakfast food down to a tee....I've tried both the adobo omelette and loco moco and I'm a fan of both! \n\nSo if you are ever in need of a good brunch place, this is a must try type of establishment...and don't forget to order the FULL stack of the red velvet pancakes...it's like the Lay's potato chip slogan, betcha can't eat just one!...so probably best to order extra so you can share."

We (4 of us) ordered the Kalua Pig Benedict with potatoes, Portuguese sausage with Garlic rice, Banana Fosters pancakes, Adobo Fried rice Omelette, and Red Velvet pancakes. Everything was delicious, with the Kalua Pig coming out as our favorite.  The hostess needs to get to know their dishes to better answer questions at the door, but our waitress was nice along with a timely waitstaff. The only reason they are one star short of perfect was because I felt sick right after & threw up. And continued to feel sick the rest of the day."

Many of there breakfast items come with buttermilk pancakes on the side, but spend the extra $1.50 for these. You can also order them as a main breakfast plate, but I find that can sometimes be a bit much as far as an over-sweet experience and on the side you get just enough to experience them firsthand. \n\nSome of the things I usually get is the breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage or the Adobo friend rice, both tasty and winning dishes. Service is quick and they will continue to come by and refill your coffee or water without having to ask or search around for assistance.\n\nThe location at Smoke Ranch is by far the best, but that being said it's almost always packed with people and there's a wait. If you go to the other by Flamingo, it's MUCH less crowded. They have one other location and I also heard a Henderson location is on the way.\n\nThey do ask for ID if you are paying by debit or credit, so just to be aware.\n\nGood stuff....yummy goodness!"

For a breakfast joint it is definitely hopping so you want to get here earlier if possible. I always tend to order the same things when I go to breakfast. In this case, the corned beef hash is my go to. The corned beef hash is nothing to write home about I guess. It kind of looks like the stuff from the can so sometimes it doesn't look the most appetizing or appealing. The taste is hit or miss as are the potatoes. Of course the saving grace is always the pancakes which I definitely like the red velvet or the blueberry. The last couple of times I decided to just order to go, because it is easier with a toddler in tow and I really just wanted pancakes. The blueberry pancakes were good, but there were barely any blueberries. I do like that they put fresh blueberries on top, but the ratio of blueberries to batter should be a bit more than what I've seen lately. Overall, breakfast items are decent, but their winners are their pancakes. \n\nP.S. They do a really good job packing to go orders with foil lined boxes so it stays hot on the way home!"

While the gravy was okay, the biscuits were hard, the gravy was under-seasoned, the hashbrowns were not appetizing at all, and the eggs tasted like they came out of a box. The coffee was not even that great. \nI would honestly pass on this restaurant and if you're in a pinch, head to an IHOP. At least you'll get a more appetizing meal than the one you'd get here."

They come out sprinkled with a chocolate crumble, slightly melted whip cream and a side of cream cheese syrup.  You may think the short stack won't be enough, but it is PLENTY.

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros (corn tortillas layered with refried beans, seasoned diced chicken, cheese, two eggs, and covered with their homemade fresh salsa) thinking that it should be good though yes, i understand that the is place when raved about was on their pancakes.... When the food came out it was okay... I cant really say it was good because it really lacked a lot of flavor.  I had to pour a ton of hot sauce and salt on it to make it taste like anything!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Kalua Pig Benedict (Toasted English Muffin layered with our slow-cooked shredded cabbage and smoke flavored pork, topped with poached medium eggs and hollandaise sauce).  His choice was so much better! The hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy, the pork was flavorful, the english muffin had the right amount of crunch that gave the dish an added texture! I ended up eating half of his dish cause it was so much better then mine!\n\nRed Velvet Pancakes (topped with their fresh whipped cream and chocolate crumbles ans served with cream cheese syrup).  So this is supposedly what they are known for.  I THINK NOT! Yes, it tasted like red velvet cupcake but it also tasted like I was going end up diabetic.  The cream cheese syrup was the topper for me on spitting the piece out of my mouth.  I just couldnt swallow it because it tasted like it was only made out of powdered sugar... \n\nToday was my second time coming here.  We waited for 30 minutes which is okay since our party of 3 expected it on a Sunday.  During that time, I figured i'd look over the menu and make sure I'm careful this time and pick something that ends up being at least good.  \n\nWRONG!  I decided to go for simple this time and ordered the Spam and Eggs with the Garlic Rice upgrade.  Spam was heated on the flat top and gave it a hard exterior which made it almost chewy and not what I want in spam.  The garlic rice had no flavor at all and I actually thought it was just plain rice and didnt give me the right order until I noticed a big chuck of onion at the bottom of my plate and I thought \"Oh i guess they did get the order right, but this doesnt taste like anything!\"  \n\nThe buttermilk pancakes that came with the dish wasnt bad (which i'm glad cause I really hope nobody would be able to mess up regular pancakes especially a place known for their pancakes).  However the pancakes were cold... which is pretty strange since the plate it was on was a little bit warm.  Normally I would understand this if I left it on the table for a while but once the waiter put it down, I checked cause it looked cold.  \n\nI think the only thing they got truely right on my order was my over easy eggs... \n\nMy boyfriend ended up getting the Biscuits and Gravy.  The gravy wasnt too bad with the help of salt! The order comes with 3 small biscuits that are hard.  I take that back, only 2 were hard and the last one couldnt even be cut when you stabbed it with a fork.  Yes, he did try to do this and the fork amazing stayed completely vertical in the air.   When we asked if the biscuit were usually like this, the waiter said no but in that hesitated tone that made you think somebody knew but hoped the customers didnt noticed... \n\nI will never come back to this place.  One time, shame on me, second time, shame on them!"

Although, after we got seated and placed our orders, we did not get our drinks until 10 minutes later. My friend and I were wondering why it took so long to receive waters all around. \n\nAfter waiting for 25 minutes we got our food. I ordered the Baby Chick Skillet for $7. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that great either. The potatoes were a bit soggy. I ordered over easy eggs to go with it and they were pretty runny. I probably won't get this again. \n\nBUT, Babystacks is known for their pancakes so I thought I'd get some. Their pancakes are the reason why I give this place 4 stars. I ordered their new \"Cookies n cream\" pancakes. They were amazing! The chocolate pancakes were cooked just right and were even better drenched in sweet cream sauce! My friend also gave me her lemon ricotta pancakes and they were refreshing! These crepe like pancakes with powdered sugar and sweet cream sauce were awesome. \n\nOverall, I recommend sticking to the pancakes over the food! I bet you'll enjoy them!"

As an out of towner, we relied on Yelp to find a decent breakfast place and avoid the typical gross joints such as IHOP or Denny's.  With limited holiday option, we decided to check out BabyStacks Cafe.\n\nI been to the first location years ago and was pleased with it. I pleased to see they have done well to open a 2nd location.  Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and was seated immediately. This location certainly has more space, but it does not have the same 50's style I recall the first location had.  The menu is about the same and I noticed they are offering more \"Hawaiian\" style breakfast which I didn't remember they've had before.  No matter, they still have their famous pancakes.\n\nMy husband an I ordered the whole wheat french toast coated with corn flakes cereal.  My husband went with a BYO omelette with a side of Oreo cookie pancake.  When our order arrived, my french toast looked amazing.  They were so thick I decided it's best to eat it using my hand like a french toast bar.  However, my husbands BYO omelette looked less than appealing to me.  The side of hash browns looked dry as if it came out of a frozen package hashbrown.  The omelette is just uninteresting. The Oreo cookie pancake came shortly.  My husband thought it was ok.  It was essentially a chocolate cake not even a pancake with whipped cream; well....not a total lost, the whipped cream was tasty.   My French toast was really good. I also ordered a side of Portuguese sausage so I have a sweet and spicy combination.  It was a good call; the combination was very good.\n\nOverall, I think the place is ok.  I think there are other places that offer a more well rounded offerings here in Las Vegas."

I really love restaurants that are local and not just another chain restaurant which is what Babystacks is; a great local place. This place is always busy so if you don't want to wait make sure you get there early; especially on the weekends! The pancakes are amazing as well as the omelettes and skillets. My favorite pancake there has to be either the infamous Red Velvet or Butterfinger. It's two hard to decide between the two! My goal is one day try every single pancake :) The great thing about this restaurant is you can still get an omelette or skillet and still be able to have a side of their delicious pancakes. My favorite skillet is the Mexican skillet. If you like spicy this is a must try! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is a breakfast food lover and wanting to experience delicious food and great service!"

I would have to say my overall experience was hardly worth the wait at all. \n\nAs for the food, I tried the Red Velvet Pancakes and had bites of the Kalua Pig Benedict. I felt there were flaws in both dishes. I loved the crumbled chocolate on the red velvet pancakes but I have had better ones. It seems as if reading \"cream cheese syrup\" on the menu is supposed to hook you in but I felt that it was nothing more than liquidy cream cheese icing, hardly a syrup really. Plus, there was way too much food coloring in the red velvet pancakes because the color was beyond a deep red velvet and more like an unappetizing shocking red color. The Kalua Pig Benedict didn't stand a chance with soggy english muffins. The \"seasoned\" potatoes were bland and tasted like they were straight out of a frozen bag.   \n\nService here was mixed for me. The hostess was friendly enough considering how busy it was, our waitress was very friendly but the girl at the cashier, the one person actually taking our money didn't provide any customer service at all. A real let down at the end of the meal. \n\nSuper random but every time I look at the BabyStacks Cafe logo, I think of the little people from that Facebook game, Restaurant City haha."

My hazelnut pancakes were a little dry, it wasn't dry enough to make them not taste good, but it kept crumbling every time I tried to pick it up with a fork.

I had the Nutella Crepes with half strawberries and banana with fresh whip cream with a side of Canadian bacon, and my friend ordered the Honey Toast with a side of turkey bacon. My crepes were not thin, more pancake-like rolled into what looked like a crepe, and my Canadian bacon was way too salty. However, Katrina's breakfast was to DIE for!!!! The honey toast, or (aka French Toast) were two humongous thick slices of sweet bread with a large dollop of whip cream sprinkled with cinnamon. I actually wanted to eat her breakfast instead of mine! LOL The portions were large and hearty. Their overall menu selections were abundant, from pancakes, crepes, omelets, eggs/bacon, lots of sides, and a few Filipino dishes.\n\nI decided to take my family there before we left Vegas, so my second trip was just as good as the first. This time I ordered the Honey Toast (delectable!) and my family ordered: red velvet pancakes, strawberries and cream pancakes, and corned beef hash with garlic rice and an over easy egg. The garlic rice was so-so as they put too many onion slices in it. Be prepared to order a full or half stack of pancakes if you're hungry and a sweet tooth.\n\nIn terms of service, we arrived at a busy time, around 11:00 AM so we had to wait 15-20 minutes before we were seated. The waitress was very pleasant and replenished our coffee mugs. The restaurant is small and gets very busy, so if you go, go early. Their hours are Mon-Fri 7:00 AM - 2:00 PM, and Sat-Sun 7-3PM.

He doesn't enjoy food like I do, and pancakes are pretty much at the bottom of his breakfast/brunch list. He always finishes these pancakes.  \n\nThis breakfast place works great for a California- Hawaii couple like us.  They have an awesome selection of Hawaii \"comfort foods\" like corned beef hash, Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice, loco moco, etc.  But, they also have awesome Southwest/Cali/Mex breakfast foods like huevos rancheros.\n\nFavorites:\n- Red Velvet pancakes are a MUST try.  They're light, delicately chocolately, and covered with REAL whipped cream- which really makes the dish superb. Pancakes are a normal size, not hujangez like Hash House a Go Go, and are slightly crispy on the outside, and warm and spongy on the inside.\n\n- Bananas Foster pancakes:  YES... quite decadent for breakfast, but definitely worth the calories... no wait... I don't want to know how many calories there are in this... Again, the whipped cream really ties the dish together... along with fresh bananas foster.... warm and caramelly. Next time, we'll try the French toast.\n\n- Adobo Fried Rice:  My favorite [non pancake] item on the menu so far.  Pork adobo is cooked to perfection, and combines well with the rice in a savory- slightly tangy (from adobo vinegar).  Next time, I may ask for the rice with the egg done over easy.  I enjoyed the fried egg wrap, but I think it may taste better with an egg yolk cracked over the rice.\n\n- Kalua Pig Benedict:  Awesome... although, I've done this myself at home with some leftover kalua pig, English muffins, and eggs.  Their hollandaise sauce was definitely better, though.\n\n- Loco Moco with garlic fried rice:  Pretty typical.  I would recommend adding the garlic fried rice for an extra kick, though.  Traditional brown gravy, and well prepared hamburger patty made it feel like home.  Gravy was a bit saltier than usual though.\n\n*TIP: Go on a weekday if you can.  Weekends are just nuts.  The boyfriend and I both work from home, so we've been going on Tuesday or Wednesday mornings and usually have no wait for a table."

The restaurant is small so a wait is to be expected but ours was only about 15 minutes to be seated. Our server was very cheerful and friendly. This place is definitely worth a drive off the strip and we will be returning."

Same problems, party of five, three got breakfast, than after some time the other two got part of their breakfast, then later the cold toast arrived and after asking twice  your jam arrived.  We wanted to have breakfast together at the same time.  It was not busy.  Don't know if it was waiter or kitchen, but is was not an enjoyable breakfast.  The FRIED eggs were wet with water, icky and the food was average.  So if service is important to you I would pass on BabyStacks."

Liked the large selection of pancakes and variety of the other menu items. Ordered the Red Velvet short stack which was three pancakes, topped with homemade whipped cream, chocolate cookie crumble and cream cheese syrup. The pancakes were good enough to eat plain, nothing else was required but lliked the cream cheese topping as well. Husband has eggs with Portuguese sausage and the garlIc rice. We love Portuguese sausage and was impressed the menu has Hawaiian style food as well. The garlic rice was different but needed a tad more seasoning. All well prepared and enjoyable.  Better than the other breakfast place we tried. \n\nNeed to try some other pancake flavors and more of the Hawaiian specialties next time!"

This is a good option to take out of town guests to since they have a lot of Hawaiian breakfast plates and sweet pancake/dessert options, but I don't want to waste my weekends in line here. The staff does their best to accommodate everyone, but they easily fall behind tasks (providing checks, refilling drinks, condiment requests, etc) since there is so much going on. They also have their location on N Buffalo, so make sure to clarify the location you are meeting people at. You can call ahead for the wait time, but that can change at any moment. Will only come back if I'm feeling lazy."

I took in the ambiance--soothing music that suited the mood, wooden tables and chairs, TVs in good positions, and overall, it was a comfortable setting. The wait for my food was never too long either. These factors also held true the second time around. Now, here's what I've got to say about the food:\n\n- Red Velvet Pancakes: Now this, this is what a lot of people like to come for, so I had to try it. It really is a delicious stack. The ratio of whipped cream, to pancake, to cream cheese syrup is the key to the perfect bite of this dish! I do have a comment on it's consistency though. I prefer pancakes that are fluffy and melt in your mouth. These pancakes have a little bit of a chew to it but not enough to be drastically inedible. In fact, my peers didn't even notice. Otherwise, this alone is a great reason to come to BabyStacks!\n- Adobo Fried Rice: I love it and I couldn't stop eating it. It is flavorful and some might say it's a little salty, but that's just how I like it!\n- Country Fried Steak and Eggs: Nothing special, but still very tasty!\n\nBabyStacks is a great place to eat and definitely offers a lot of variety. Bring everyone with you!"

To be quite honest, IHOP fare might be comparable.\n\nPeople really like Babystacks, though.  Business seems good here.  The room was full.\n\nThe Red Velvet short stack was comprised of three extremely red pancakes.  Rather heavy-handed in the food colouring, even for RV.  Cream cheese syrup goes very nicely with them.  The combo tastes exactly like a Red Velvet Cake.\n\nIt was pretty good, light and fluffy... if a bit on the dry side for a pancake.  I prefer hotcakes with more butter or moisture in them.  Babystacks offers interesting variety of pancake flavours, including Carrot Cake.\n\nLoco Moco was tasty.  Poached eggs, cooked medium, were still runny enough over the meat patty and scoops of rice.\n\nPortions could be bigger.  Prices are low.  Service was alright.  Restroom was clean.\n\nI really wanted to like Babystacks a lot more, but it was just okay.\n\nMaybe stop in if you happen to be in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip."

The servers don't seem to care at all if you're waiting to be greeted, what I would like to drink, and most of all... take my order and get my order right. I waited nearly over 20 mins. to get my drink order then I literally had to stand up and see all the servers hanging around the cashier laughing and not giving a damn. I said *out loud.. Can I pleeeeease order? The next reaction just stunned me. All three just looked away and looked down as if they were checking their phones and counting money?!??? Seriously??? After one server was finished with whatever bs she was doing, she walked up to my table like nothing and asked me what I want to get. At this moment, I'm already disgusted by the service here. I told Felisha, my server a short stack of Macadamia Nut and Carrot Cakes.. also Portuguese sausage and eggs.. for an extra charge, I substituted with egg whites. From how things are going, I also asked for two to go boxes, because I wasn't going to stay much longer. Waiting is Riiiiidiculous here.\n\nMy pancakes came and unfortunately both were tasteless and dry even with all that syrup and cream cheese toppings. Then my server brings the egg whites separate and the Portuguese sausage separate.. I'm like.. you have to be kidding me right?!! Does she not know I came here before and order this very dish to know she messed up on my order. Since she never came around after dropping off my food I waved down to catch another server/busser? and asked him... doesn't the Portuguese sausage and eggs come with hash browns??? He looked so puzzled and slowly said yes..... yes \"wait\" a minute. Then another five minutes later my server comes by and said oh I thought you wanted them separate. I told her no I ordered the Portuguese sausage and eggs entree. It does come with hash browns right? She goes.. yes here you go and was about to turn around and walk away... Not so fast... I told her.. Excuse me... she turned around and I go, since I ordered the entree.. it includes a side of pancakes doesn't it?? She goes.. yes it does. I look at her and she looks at me like yea so?!? I told her.... Soooo am I going to get a side of pancakes or ??? She goes well what kind you want? I'm like whatever kind comes with this entree. She goes well we have buttermilk or for an extra charge red velvet. I told her I just want what comes with the entree. If I didn't say anything, she wasn't even going to bother correcting my order and think I haven't dined here.. more so think I don't know what this entree includes. Not that slick sweetheart. I'm going to get what I'm paying for not half ass. That right there was wrongly done. Not nice to treat a repeat guest or any guest for that matter. The hash brown was semi-cooked, portuguese sausage was over cooked and extremely dry like burned wood chips. The only thing that came out good out of this experience was the eggs whites. I can't believe the service here and the worst part is it WASN'T even busy at all. Unacceptable.\n\nThank goodness I asked for my to go boxes, it came in handy and again, I had to ask a different server/cashier if I can get a container cover for the syrup and cream cheese. This place should be called Long Wait that Stacks Up, because obviously that's all I experienced here. And of course the sneaky server Felisha that tried to get away in not offering me the pancakes that came with the meal. Lazy. Even though it's the last hour, you should always treat the guest as if they are your first, middle, or last. They are still your guest!!!"

The quality was really cheap tasting. I can tell what a quality egg tastes like and these were flavorless and the sausage was just salty tasting, no flavor. I could make this same meal at home and it would taste way better. The red velvet pancakes did taste better than I expected, but all-in-all the whole meal was disappointing.

I'm like cool, and then they had 2 ripped pieces of bacon floatin' on top yo like somebody bit my bacon and left me the fat part.  The FAT part son!  I'm like, yo I thought the menu said bacon infused pancakes b!?  I didn't see no bacon bits creatively infused into the pancake son, matter of fact, I'm glad I didn't complain off top!  Because they did have bacon in the pancakes but it was one whole piece per pancake like as if they cooked one side, waited 3 minutes, threw a piece of bacon on it, flipped it, then cooked it another 3 minutes.  And my bacon was mad chewy son! C'mon son!  If it's Filipino inspired, you know we like our shits crispy b!  Almost burnt to the point where it gets a little ashy nahmean!?  It felt like I was eatin' rubber pancakes with a toy piece of bacon I got from my youngn's fake stove, you understand?  Anyway, I ate it all, cause I was hungry.  Good thing my main event came through tho.  The Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelette was right on the money.  I wish they gave me more macaroni salad tho son, they gave me a baby scoop b.  I'm 26 years old fam!  You can't give me the baby scoop with the adult main event son.  I ate that shit in one bite and had nothin' else to off set the adobo flavor.  But yo, I ain't even tryna play this place son, because I saw some other shit on the menu that was probably way better than what I got.  I'm also Filipino, so grabbin' some Filipino food probably wasn't the best idea because my moms be makin' that shit since I was 3 yo, so I'm not really impressed by it nahmean?  All in all, if you tryna impress a shorty yo, do NOT take her here unless you don't care about her or you live 5 minutes away and she says \"If you buy me breakfast, I'll tickle your fancy\".  That's the only time you take a broad here yo.  Anyway, yo the waiter was cool, had my water filled up before I had to ask so you know I was pretty satisfied.  But overall I give this place a 3 out of 7 rating b.  #MoochEats"

Of course the red velvet pancakes were a must try, but I'm more of a bacon and eggs kinda person. I got the Piglet omelet (bacon, sausage, ham, and cheddar cheese) and red velvet pancakes, they charge a little more to get specialty pancakes but that's normal. The omelet was decent (not the best Ive ever had) but the pancakes were to die for. They serve pretty big portions though, so the pancakes are more like a breakfast desert. Which worked out well because i could only down a couple more bites of food at that point. All in all it was good, i would recommend it to friends, don't think ill be making the long drive to eat their too often though."

Well after about 10 more minutes she checks again and brings out 2 boxes of somebody else's order. Pretty annoying now at this point i've been waiting 45 minutes for what was suppose to be a 20 minute wait. She apologized and said my order would be right out. Well 15 minutes later my actual order came out and at this point i was basically over this whole pancake experience. They gave me a $10 gif certificate for the wait time. Nice gesture.. i guess.. The pancakes are Okay... Red velvet's were the best and the banana cream pie ones i could have made myself.. Not sure if I'll return."

It had all the makings of a great place--great food, great service, comfortable seating, etc.  Both locations are a bit of hump off the strip, but are great places to hit up after a weekend of binge drinking and other unsavory activities up to and including: donkey shows, midget lap dances, dice games at the MGM west wing alley way entrance, passing out nudie flyers.  I had the adobo omelette and shared a short stack of the red velvet pancakes with the lady.  Besides creativity, the omelette was pretty spot on.  No surprises here with the chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an omelette.  Just good eats.  I could make a recommendation of trying to use pork instead of chicken next time.\n\nThe omelette also came with what could possibly be the best macaroni salad I've had in my life.  Rich and creamy with a possible hint of garlic or something magical, it left me wanting more and licking the tiny bowl the serving came in.\n\nFor the piece de resistance--red velvet pancakes.  Seems like a great idea in theory and even better in practice at babystacks.  The pancakes had a perfect melding of  cake and pancake texture while maintaining that subtle red velvet taste.  The cream on top was absolutely phenomenal and I would definitely consider that as a bath water substitute.  \n\nAll in all, great place with great food and service. Like I said, it is now a Vegas tradition of mine and you might want to consider making it one of your as well.  Unless, your leaving Vegas tradition is something like midget lap dances.  That sounds way better..."

There are a ton of unique flavors of pancakes offered such as banana cream pie, cinnabun, etc. Our table ordered full stacks of red velvet and s'mores pancakes to share. In my opinion, the red velvet pancakes were a little overrated because they were kind of dry unless you covered it with whip cream and cream cheese frosting... But the s'mores pancakes were delicious especially the part of the batter that had chocolate. It was like having dessert for breakfast. Those of you with a sweet tooth will be especially pleased. :)\n\nI'd definitely recommend taking the drive off the strip to come here if you want some good breakfast! Friendly and attentive service. They're only open until three pm so they specialize in breakfast foods and you can sleep in a little and go get brunch after noon. \n\nBabystacks has savory breakfast items, but I think you MUST order pancakes here at least to share with everyone at the table. My friends had been here before and did not recommend the adobo fried rice that seemed to be a highlight in many other yelp reviews. They said it was gross. This place has a lot of islander (Hawaiian) inspired breakfast items such as a spam scramble or loco moco. The boyfriend and I shared the kalua pig benedict and it was tasty! It was the favorite entree among everyone at our table. The pork was super soft and cooked perfectly, and it went well with the muffin, hollandaise sauce, and poached egg. \n\nI can't wait to come back. There's still so many more pancakes and entrees that I want to try!"

Got the grilled cheese special with pork and the adobo fried rice omelet. It was all ok. Carrot pancakes had a nasty after taste and could only eat with the sauce. They might as well called the grilled cheese with pork a pork sandwich. It barely had any cheese and almost all pork. Not good at all! The only thing I kind of liked was the adobo fried rice but it doesn't even compare to aloha kitchen. Service was good. But I would not come back unless I was craving red velvet pancakes. I am not a morning person at all. But I would have preferred another place."

I fired up the yelp and it was between that and some other spot but these pictures from here won me over!\n\n I don't know Vegas and what part we were in but getting there was almost nuts because it was flooded getting there. Damn storm in Vegas kinda ruined my Vegas mojo. Oh well. So found the spot in a shopping center next to a donut shop I wanted to get a donut BUT the food coma after this orgasmic meal stopped that LOL.\n\n Since this was a weekday brekie, we didn't have to deal with the weekend rush that I kept reading about, so :p Walked in and sat at the counter so I can watch some tv while stuffin my face. The service was good . We had a dude that I think may have ran the place himself or family. Anywho scaled the menu and was drooling over the options. So typical me :D  Finally  we figured out what we wanted after trying to figure it out for damn near 15 minutes. My fault HA!\n\n   I opted for the build your own skillet. With the eggs ,spinach,bacon,mushrooms and cheese. Under that is a bed of breakfast potatoes. I also added two red velvet pancakes for an additional charge. Still came with toast OH LAWRD LOL. Pic ordered the Ricks adobo fried rice and also we did a side of portugeuse sausage and kailua pork. Man this sounds like were some mad fat asses LOL.  So im getting excited for all this food to come out. Thank god we had the whole counter to ourselves HAHA. We start piggin out. My skillet was delish BUT I didn't care for all the potatoes under my fixins. I like hashbrowns much more than breakfast spuds. The eggs were nice and fluffy. I could have used more cheese but im a cheesehead LOL. The red velvet pancakes were CRACK! Thats pretty much did my tummy in! I kept eating them and eating them and eating them. I usually hate pancakes but these were OMAZING. The cream cheese syrup was so damn good! The chunks of chocolate chip with the batter and syrup made it a perfect bite! Damn now im starting to day dream about those.  The portueguese sausage was a good amount and cooked perfectly. The kailua pork was a lacking something, some kind of brown au jus with a touch of sweetness would have made it more enjoyable. His dish was  good as well but not the best fried rice. But still good and he ate it all!\n\n  We walked out stuffed as hell and we were going to go shopping BUT I couldn't take knowing that I would have to walk amongst the crowds, so I said F it take me back to my room so I can sleep LOL. Can't wait to come back here!!!!!!"

Both were awesome and served with a cream cheese syrup. One suggestion for them, selfishly speaking, would be to create a pancake sampler to give customers an opportunity to try a variety of their flavors. We had to order two separate dishes just so we could taste more than one of their flavors."

It was kinda dry, and had a little less chicken than I expected, but the hash browns it came with were pretty on point. The pancakes it also came with were also hella bomb, so next time I'll try a pancake item. If you're into fruit, the strawberries were juicy and ripe.\nAll and all, it was a pretty positive experience. The waiters could be a little more attentive, but I'd give it a whirl if you're in the area, looking for a good breakfast, and it's not the weekend, because then you'll be waitin a helluva long time, ya dig."

I'm not sure if it's because spinach and mushrooms are one of my favorite vegetables, but I really enjoy this dish.  The spinach is perfectly cooked the way I like it.  I hate it when restaurants overcook vegetables and it's mushy.  I also like the cripsy bacon in between.  The english muffin is lightly toasted and not hard like some places I've had before.\n\nI'm not a fan of the kalua pig benedict, but it might be that I normally don't like pork as much as beef or chicken.  I won't say it's not good but it lacked a little favor and the only thing I've had here that I won't order again.\n\nThe honey toast is really good too.  I love the thickness of the bread.  It's simple but delicious.  It's so hard to decide what to eat here because I like so many things and want to try everything, so usually I would order a savory meal and something sweet like this as a dessert.  I know I'm such a pig :-P  Who eats dessert after breakfast/lunch??\n\nI've also had the sweet cream crepes with bananas, which is a nice dessert.  They have honey on the side, but it's pretty sweet as it is.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered steak and eggs which I've had a bite of.  I thought it was a really good deal.  It came with 2 eggs, potatoes, 2 pancakes, and an 8 oz steak.  The steak was really tender, but my boyfriend said it lacked flavor.  All he needed was to sprinkled some salt and A1 sauce (which was provided along with 2 different hot sauces and ketchup at the beginning of the meal) and it was all good.  It was cooked medium like he requested, still pink on the inside.\n\nOther than the food, I've never had to wait for more than 15 min for a table but I usually go during the weekdays or past 12 on weekends.  The service has always been good for us."

Yet another review... yes. The pancakes are THAT good. Pancake Perfection! How does one make such consistent, fluffy cakes all the time.. day in, day out? The world may never know... My cream cheese icing syrup(?) was put on the side and I used it for dunking rather than drenching. Red velvet Pancakes 4 Lyf.\n\nI will soon be back to indulge in their Hawaiian and Filipino breakfasts so I can get some SPAM.. (i have a secret liking for that stuff) ... at that time I'll hopefully have something else to review... and I can UP my rating:]"

You could see it written all over the menu - rice, portuguese sausage, spam, kalua pig -- I even saw adobo fried rice!\n\nBut what they specialize in here are their pancakes. Not a huge pancake fan (I don't mind them as sides but not as a full meal), I wasn't sure what to do. I ended up with one of their skillets. It is potatoes on the bottom with you eggs and whatever else you chose on top. It's not technically in a skillet though. Each skillet (and most other main entrees) come with a short stack of pancakes. You can upgrade to any of their \"fancy\" pancakes too (they must have over 20 types!). Being near the holidays they had chocolate peppermint pancakes so I went with that (one of my fav flavor combos). \n\nThe skillet was good but the pancakes even better. Ok, they almost tasted like cupcakes so maybe that's why they were so yum!\n\nI hear the lines can get long so go during an off hour or expect to wait. Ample parking in the parking lot in front (free).\n\nI wish they would bring Baby Stacks to Hawaii!!!"

Waiting to get seated was a time killer, but once we ordered, our food came out very quick.  Portions are not humongous like Omelet house or Original pancake house, Babycakes Cafe portions are decent and therefore reasonably priced.

The food is still as good as ever.  \nAs you can read from previous reviews, the red velvet pancakes are far and away the most popular item.  Don't get me wrong, they're absolutely delicious, but I can only handle a few bites.  I always order them as a side and share them with my hubby.  I mean, come on you can't come here and not get the red velvet pancakes.  I have tried various menu items here with Babstacks providing all of your breakfast staples.  The eggs benedict is always pretty good, and I have been tempted to try the Kalua Prok benedict but haven't had a chance yet.  Rick's adobo fried rice is always a good choice with fried rice surrounded by a warm blanket of egg omelet.  Pour a little sriratcha on it and you are set.  \nThe service is always pretty good here.  It can get very busy on Sundays when we usually go so be ready to wait (usual time for us is about 20-30 minutes).  But don't hesitate, it is worth the wait.   Enjoy!"

Really, some of the best hash browns I've had. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the red velvet pancakes. She enjoyed them quite a bit. I'm not much of a cake person, but they were pretty good. It was like eating cake for breakfast - which is something I always looked forward to as a kid after a birthday party. I couldn't see myself eating a whole meal, but the few bites I had sure were tasty. \n\nWe also ordered the adobo fried rice with the intention of taking it to go. We didn't realize that it was an omelette with fried rice in it. We apparently didn't read the menu very well since it says that it's adobo fried rice wrapped in an egg. I guess I just assumed that most fried rice has egg bits in it and didn't think that it would be an omelette. Pretty interesting take on fried rice. It was pretty good, too. It didn't really have much of the adobo flavor I'm used to, but I liked it. \n\nOverall, Babystacks is good. The service was great and the staff members were very friendly.

If you come with a big group, best go as early as possible!\n\nOut of the dishes we ordered, I tasted: red velvet pancakes, adobo fried rice omelet, and the loco moco.  The pancakes were so much better than I expected them to be!  I'm really not a fan of pancakes but the red velvet ones were super delicious!  And they're not topped with butter; they're topped with a cream cheese syrup and chocolate chips.  Loco moco was really good and I absolutely loved the adobo fried rice.  Prolly gained 5lbs while eating there but I will def want to come back the next time I'm in Vegas"

And it's worth the wait.  \n\nEverything I tasted was phenomenal. \n\nThe Red Velvet Pancake was out of this world!  The cream cheese syrup with buttery whipped cream really made this velvety pancake unforgettable.  I can have this for breakfast everyday! \n\nI thought their Rocky Road pancake would be too sweet.  It was perfect! Impressive that almonds and marshmallows were inside the chocolate batter as well as on top.\n\nAs a peanut butter fan, I went bananas for my PBand??? pancake.  With peanut butter in and out of the pancake, I can taste how any topping would go well with this pancake.  Elvis would be proud!  He'd probably be here everyday too!  \n\nI had an omelet with ground beef, bacon, cilantro, and green onion.  It was like a marriage made in heaven.  Every flavor came out and I enjoyed every bite!  \n\nThe Adobo Fried Rice was amazing too.  With marinated shredded chicken mixed with rice AND wrapped in four eggs, this unique omelet is definitely something to brag about.  \n\nService was flawless, even with a long wait.  Their large size cups are ingenious for less frequent refills (for water, orange juice, soda).  But the coffee kept coming.    \n\nCan't wait to come back for more of their fresh pancake creations and other breakfast specialties."

When we were sat, they took our drink orders promptly and then our server eventually came to see us. She came and saw us pretty frequently, which I appreciated, especially since members of my party had to look through the extensive menu. When we ordered, it didn't take too long for our food to come out, which was pretty amazing. The food tasted just like how I was expecting.

The last time I was there I had the \"Peanut Butter and ____\" pancakes. The 'blank' means you can chose what ever peanut butter partner you'd like from a selection of items. I had the PB & Bananas. \n\nNo anywhere as good as most of there items but it can be improved upon. The pancakes themselves where banana filled, but the PB was in the form of PB chips. As in choclate chips. They melted on the pancake eventually but you still have to kind of spread them on to the stack. That would have not been my first choice. Maybe a spread on the side or just spread some actually PB on the stacks. Maybe they do it for presentation?...\n\nEither way they didn't taste as good as they sound. \n\nThe food is awesome and you can get some traditional Filipino and Hawaiian items as well. They have an extensive menu for pancakes and omeletts which are my favorite so you have plenty to chose from. Just be sure to order the half-stack if you're not hungry. The pancakes are about the size of your hand in diameter but they are very rich. \n\nThe four stars comes from the size and set-up of the establishment. Very very small and very limited seating for a place where you have to wait at least 20 minutes to be seated, longer if you're a bigger party. In the dead of summer or cold of winter you have to wait outside to be seated if the few seats that are inside are already taken. It's almost elbow to elbow inside and if you are private person there isn't anything you can really talk about without the folks at the next table being able to hear it. \n\nOtherwise, this place seldom disappoints. I would definitely recommend you try it at least twice."

Because they know their skills and they play to it. It's vibe is small and charming, the staff is super nice and helpful and I've never not seen a crowd inside. It's also right next door to a bar, which means I have had to use them to soak up the previous nights questionable decisions. However eating here has always been a good decision. They have lunch foods like Kahlua pig and adobo fried rice but I stick to breakfast. I usually opt for the Piglet, which is several forms of pork in An omelette  or the Denver omelette, which is a The same everywhere else. All omelette can be had in skillet form, which is nice. The real star though are the pancakes. It's called baby stacks for a reason, so sitting down and stuffing your face full of pancakes is what you need to do. They have about 15 types and I haven't tried them all yet. The crown jewel is of course their red velvet, which is only my 4th favorite. I absolutely go bonkers for the white chocolate  macadamia or the German chocolate. Orange creamsicle is also a bit weird but good. The only two I can say I didn't like we're the honey wheat and PB&J. As much as I love PBJ, it just doesn't work on pancakes. However you're not stuck with that because you can do peanut butter and banana or peanut butter and Nutella\nMy only gripes about this place is that their bacon game could step up. It's fine for an omelette but on its own, I expect more\nI'm not going to complain about the wait because not only is it usually less than what they say, I take it as a sign they're doing something right \nTL;DR come in, eat some pancakes. Tip your waitress, walk out like a boss"

Just the right thickness, a little crisp on the edges, soft, tasty and most importantly not too sweet. The Cream Cheese Syrup, fresh Whipped Cream and bits of chocolate crumbles top the order off perfectly. I am salivating just thinking bout them!\n\nWe've been there a bunch of times and there is usually a wait, anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour no matter what day of the week you go. The second location at Buffalo and Flamingo is larger and sometimes you can walk right in there, we go there on occasion but still prefer the charm of the original locale. The servers are always friendly and even when the place is packed the food comes out quickly and piping hot. \n\nI've tried a plethora of the pancakes, but I keep going back to the Red Velvet! My second fav would the the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, sweet, tasty and done to perfection. The Smores, Rocky Road and Bacon are all good as well. The Carrot Cakes, however, had a good flavor, but were a bit dry .. maybe an off day for whomever made them? \n\nBabystacks also offers a full menu of different breakfast and lunch type items for those who are not craving pancakes. The Biscuits and Gravy are delicious and we usually get an order to share. That way we have sweet AND savory for breakkie. The gravy is flavorful and they give plenty of it. Sooooo good! A friend of mine had the Mexican Omelet which he said was perfectly done and just the right amount of spices and heat. \n\nThis is definitely a place I would recommend .. the prices are very reasonable, the food is delicious, the service is great. The only thing I would say is that it's not really set up for larger parties as it's quite small. If you are wanting to do something for more than 6 people, you may want to take it to the Buffalo / Flamingo location."

I've been to Baby Stacks a ton of times and it's this specific location that happens to be my favorite. Then I realize, my visits were all before I started Yelping.  \n\nBabyStacks use to be a staple for breakfast before I moved out here.  The restaurant is small and can get crowded, but once you're seated be prepared for a breakfast treat worth bragging about.  I'm not embarassaed to admit, there was a time I was here weekly.  From service to their food, you cannot go wrong with this place.  \n\n-Red Velvet Pancakes:  This is what they are known for and if you haven't tried it, it's a must.  Review the photos and tell me you can't resist.  \n\n-White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes:  This is actually my favorite stack here. Imagine eating your favorite Macadamia nut cookie transformed to a fluffy pancake. \n\n-Garlic Rice:  My favorite dangerous dish all time.  The rice looks plain, but it's so good and melts in your mouth.  Who describes rice to melt in your mouth? I do, that's who.  This another suggestion.\n\n-Adobo Fried Rice:  One of my newer favorites here.  Not as big as say Aloha's Kitchen, but I think it's better in taste.  A healthy serving of rice and chicken Adobo wrapped in an egg omelet.  \n\n-Loco Moco:  Hit and miss with their Loco Moco's.  Sometimes it's really good and sometimes it's just okay.  I think it's maybe due to the fact I think Hawaiian BBQ makes the best Loco Moco.  \n\n-The Others:  Then you got the traditional stuff that will not disappoint like eggs, sausage, their Portuguese sausage.  Their Portuguese sausage is also very good.\n\nIf you're visiting Vegas, BabyStacks is sure to be one of your highlights.  After you've tried BabyStacks, you will not be impressed with the others out there.  Trust me on this one."

This is where this turned from a great experience to a bad one.  \n\nI know that this is a relatively small eatery.  It's a mom and pop type business.  The pancakes were good--  a tad too chocolatety... More so than I remember, but I could have just been in a bad mood after waiting 1/2 hour for pancakes.  Are you kidding me?  I'm a solo diner.  I watch full stacks brought out to the table to the right of me and short stacks to my left--literally.  If it didn't take me 1/2 hour to get there, I would have left.  Finally, my waitress notices \"Hmmm... I think she probably came here to eat\" and asked the kitchen where my food was.  They start to argue about if it was put in or not.  I'm thinking, \"Hey, I'm sitting right next to you guys. Can you be more discrete?\"  So they start making the pancakes.  Do I get an apology, an explanation, a \"are you still doing alright\", \"your food will be out in a bit\", or at least some water in my empty glass? You guessed it... No!  That was the insulting part.\n\nLook, I eat out a lot.  I do probably more than I should.  I know that things happen and mistakes are made.  That's absolutely fine.  There will be some human error.  What is not acceptable is keeping the patron in the dark-- especially if I can hear the whole he said/she said conversation... This right here is where restaurants are defined, and this place failed miserably.  To add insult to injury, they put the check on my table literally 3 minutes after I got my food.  I eat fast but really?  Again, really?  You've got to be kidding me.  \n\nI WILL NEVER EAT AT THIS PLACE AGAIN!

I was excited to try the red velvet pancakes, which did live up to the hype. They're so pretty and fluffy with great flavor. Even just a half stack is more than enough, I think the full would've been too much of a good thing.\nWheat French toast kind of looks more like pork chops in my pic, but its actually thick slabs of bread dipped in a corn flake crust for a really different texture. I was excited to try their French toast based on the description, but it was a little dry and overwhelmingly sweet to me. I ended up just having 1 piece. \nI didn't try my friend's strawberry crepe, but presentation was pretty. Service was surprisingly bad despite it being pretty slow. I'm always a little shocked when little homey restaurants like this don't provide good service. There were maybe 10 tables max with 2 or 3 servers working. The waitress was sweet and nice, but I almost had to beg her for a 3rd place setting. We also ceased to exist once the food came, had to beg again for a refill of their watered down coffee. Tried unsuccessfully twice to flag her down to pay the bill, only to be told that she didn't do that - we had to pay up front. \nI really wanted to love this place because it was so cute, but I don't think ill be back. Just have to be on the lookout for another place w red velvet pancakes."

It jolted because it was getting a reincarnation.  At first i was skeptical after reading all the reviews that this dish alone would be too sweet, but that first bite was just heavenly that even the angels sang. Glad I saved this for last.\n\nMy friend and I shared a few other dishes.  We had the Kalua Pig Benedict which were amazing.  The pork was surprisingly tender and not overly salty.  Very good balance between the eggs and hollandaise sauce.  I annihilated this one. \n\nThe Loco Moco was also fantastic and hit the spot as well.  Two homemade hamburger patties over a bed of rice with an egg on top then smother in brown gravy.  Delish!!  This was my friend's favorite.\n\nWe also had an order of the Adobo Fried Rice wrapped in an egg omelet.  This was my 2nd time having adobo since 10 years ago, so i can't really comment on that other than that it was a tad bit salty.  But in all honestly I think it worked out perfectly since we both enjoyed this dish.\n\nWith it's charming staff and appealing atmosphere I can see this cute cafe being a local's favorite very soon.\n\n*side note* We got to sample their homemade country gravy and man that was the best i ever tasted.  So good we ate straight up with a spoon.  Don't judge. Can't wait til we come back to try it with their fried steak or dare i say it, biscuit *gasp*\n\n*side note 2*  This can't be good for my diet. \n\nTip:  Hide y0 kids, Hide y0 wife.

Going to the Las Vegas Premium Outlets North cut the trek in half and gave me a reason to explore this beautiful side of town.\n\nMy sister and I thought that we had outsmarted the regular rush but there was still a wait on a Wednesday afternoon. It makes sense since Babycakes can only seat 50 people and has a total of 10-15 tables depending on how they breakdown the seating. \n\nThe place is quaint. The hostess/cashier saw us come in and placed us on the list without us having to approach her. Fifteen minutes later we were sat. It took another ten minutes and a few puzzled glances to get a waitress over to take our drink order. Once we were noticed, the service improved. \n\nBetween the two of us we shared the lemon ricotta crepe/pancakes and the adobo fried rice. There were three thin cakes, dusted with powder sugar with butter, lemon wedges,maple syrup, and more powder sugar on the side. The crepes were crisp. The traditional lemon and sugar combination was nice. We did not taste the ricotta though. I wished it was thinly layered on each instead of mixed into the batter. My Filipino friends will probably scold me for getting such an easily made dish, but the adobo was decent. It was more salty than sour or sweet, but balanced well with the omelet wrapped around it. Not being a big fan of mayo, we subbed the mac salad for house potatoes. They were seasoned well, but could have been more brown. For both meals, we left satisfied for less than eighteen dollars before tip."

Egg whites, spinach, bacon, and mushrooms.  Solid breakfast here.  Instead of the normal side of pancakes, I got the red velvet pancakes to make up for my healthiness.  Wow, these were good.  I bet people who love sweet foods over savory would thoroughly enjoy this.\n\nI would come here to check it out, but the long lines I'm not so sure about."

But anyways...\n\nI ended up building my own omelette and getting a short stack of carrot cake pancakes with cream cheese \"syrup\". Both dishes were great, but the omelette wins by a few points. But to be fair, pancakes are never my choice of breakfast food, unless it's Swedish pancakes.. but that's a different story. I'm definitely an eggs, bacon, sausage, and potatoes person."

Keep in mind this place is off strip so you need to drive, but the menu and prices are awesome! Also, be prepared for a wait and keep in mind it's easier to get a table for 2 than for a larger group.\n\nMy two favorite dishes are the red velvet pancakes and the adobo fried rice. I've tried other pancakes here, but the red velvet are the best BY FAR. They even come with a side of cream cheese syrup. It's like having dessert for breakfast! The adobo fried rice comes wrapped in an omelet and is awesome!\n\nI've also tried the spinach eggs benedict which is very tasty. It comes with a side of buttery hash browns. I will definitely be tryng the kalua pork benedict next time. The spam scramble sounded interesting, but was nothing special. The french toast is also not very good.

It is a good diner but I don't think it blew my socks off at all.\n\nI have heard a lot about BabyStacks and I am always reminded when I drive past it at least once a week.  I am a devoted patron to a different local breakfast dinner and usually go there for breakfast.  We wanted to try something different, so we headed over to try BabyStacks.\n\nOur first mistake was getting there at 10:30am on a Sunday.  Oops and here comes a 45 minute wait.  That was self-inflicted pain, but we dealt with it.  Since we had a long wait, we had already checked out the menu and figured out what we wanted.  The menu has a lot of variety and definitely something for everybody.  This is always nice because I know we can never agree on food at my house.  They have your normal breakfast items like egg dishes, biscuits and gravy, and of course a multitude of pancake choices.  They also have a decent lunch menu with salads, sandwiches, and burgers.  On top of all of that, they have Hawaiian food on the menu.  Like I said, something for everyone.\n\nI wasn't in the mood for breakfast by the time we were sat, so I went with Loco Moco.  It was good, but not great.  It totally hit the spot for my craving, but it wasn't anything to write home about. It came with a side of mac salad and it was really pretty bland, in my opinion. The first time I had Loco Moco was in Maui, so I am probably ruined since I compare everyone's version to the first one, and few compare.   So it was good, but not great.\n\nMy hubby got a breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage.  It was a huge burrito and he was only able to eat about 2/3 of it.  It also came with a side of regular pancakes.  The pancakes were ok, but again, nothing special.  Overall, his breakfast was ok and pretty average.\n\nMy mini me got the kid's grilled cheese and it was an awesome grilled cheese.  It was super gooey and overflowing with cheesy goodness.  \n\nNow I know what you are going to say, \"Why didn't you try the fancy, smancy pancakes?\" Well, I wasn't in the mood, so there.  Maybe this is why I am only giving it a 3 star rating and didn't get my socks blown off..  We do plan on checking it out again when we are craving pancakes and maybe it will be better next time.  For just regular breakfast food though, I think I will stick with my go-to place around the corner.  Based on this experience though, everything was ok.  The service was ok, the food was ok, and the prices were ok."

Their \"banana pancakes\" were just a couple of tough, dry pancakes with a few slices of banana on top. \n\nNothing tasted like it was made from scratch.  The chicken fried steak was definitely a pre-breaded, frozen piece of crap.  The gravy on top also tasted canned.  I'm sure it was.\n\nTheir signature Red Velvet Pancakes were alright but certainly no big deal.  Way too sweet for my taste.  I don't want dessert for breakfast."

But yet again, I'm not one to drive into hype. \n\nFirst off, why drive away customers with a sign that exposes a 60 minute wait time when you have a bunch of empty tables waiting to seat hungry patrons? and when we only ended up waiting about 25 minutes (as was everyone else in front of us and behind us), I automatically felt pretty bad at their potential loss of business for those that left because they didn't want to wait \"60 minutes\". I mean cmon now, this isn't Disneyland. Or maybe it is because one of the waiter's were obviously friends with a party that came in and went straight in to be seated. Fast Pass. Nice. But hey, it was only a 25 minute wait, so I can't complain. \n\nNow on to food. \n\nCuz this is what so many of my friends hyped about. \n\nI ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette. Okay. Folks- save yourselves and just head on over to Aloha Kitchen or Island Flavor. Now they know how to do it right. If you can't make your adobo correctly and expect to throw it into some fried rice and covered with a thin layer of egg- then don't even bother. Learn how to make adobo first- then try and throw it into an \"omelette\". \n\nBoyfriend had the Loco Moco. Please, don't even get me started. Even him- not being from Hawaii- was highly disappointed. Gravy was bland and so was the hamburger patty. Which meant-- no flavor whatsoever. Cmon folks. Get it together. \n\nAnd now...drum roll please...\n\nThe pancakes. \n\nMacadamia Pancakes. \n\nTasted like generic, boxed pancake batter. Not mixed correctly with proper measurement of liquids because it was dense beyond belief. Really? Pancake sticking to the roof of your mouth? What the? And I wouldn't even have known it was macadamia nut pancakes if I hadn't read it myself. The white chocolate chips on it was the only other flavor aside from \"batter\" that you can taste. \n\nRED VELVET PANCAKES:\n\nStrike me now babycake fans. \n\nLast time I knew-- red velvet pancakes is a touch of cocoa and chocolate. It shouldn't taste like CHOCOLATE CHIP PANCAKES. Granted, chocolate chip pancakes are delicious (elsewhere-idk about here), but to have chewy and dense red velvet pancakes that don't taste like it? Not acceptable. \n\nSo now, I'm going to leave my little experience to an anomalous fluke because people seem to love it here and their red velvet pancakes. So maybe I just came in when they just weren't up to par. But I gotta review as I see and experience it. \n\nWill I go back? Maybe."

My sister and I live across the street in Desert Shores but my sister could not find her keys. They said we can not sit you until everyone is present. My son was starting to get fussy because we are not sitting him down. They sat 8 other tables by the time we waited. So I asked if we could please be sited the girl at the front said it was a 30 minute wait. I have been wanting to eat there 4 times needles to say they are not friendly. They did not care that 3 out of the 4 were there and by the time we were walking out not even a bye. I say I rather go to the cracked egg because I can at least be treated as with respect and to be acknowledged, and to top it of I can have breakfast with my family. \n\n\nShame on you Baby Stacks that's 2 less households you will not have as costumers.

I finally got the chance this morning to go to Babycakes and discover if all my lingering dreams of RVP's would come true and they definitely did.\n\nMy boyfriend and I arrived today (Sunday) at about Noon and the place was packed. I knew as soon as we drove up that we would be waiting, but never the less we were going to eat here no matter what. It ended up being a 30 minute wait, actually not bad for a brunch on a Sunday in my opinion. Would I wait that long during a week day? I'm not so sure.\n\nAfter our wait we were escorted to a table in their very small dining room. Yes, this place is TINY! \n\nI ordered the Huntington Omelet and I upgraded to the red velvet pancakes ($1.50 to do so), and my boyfriend got the full-stack of RVPs. Okay, so all the hype is true - these pancakes are freaking amazing. My boyfriend said he liked his, but he didn't finish the whole plate. Probably because they're extremely rich. \n\nBut here's what I really liked, their omelet and and serving of hasbrowns were perfect sized. Not too much, not too little. It's not like going to IHOP where they bring you out an omelet the size of your head that you're never going to finish. I appreciate that. \n\nThe prices were spot-on, the service was super sweet (they kept my coffee filled, always a plus!), and the food was DELISH. \n\nBabycakes, Babycakes, Babycakes,,,,,"

The poached eggs were soggy (they brought them in a bowl that was filled with either water or uncooked eggs), the fruit bowl had very little to it (5 grapes, where 2 were rotten, 2 overripe strawberries, 1 cube of melon), and everything was soaked in butter.\n\nThe  best bet is the pancakes (the title character in their menu) and the Portuguese sausage.\n\nI also noticed that the decor near us was covered in dust curtains.

If you are staying on the strip, definitely make the drive out here to try their hawaiin inspired breakfast. I ordered the Macadamia Nut/White chocolate shortstack just to be different. Oooh that was yummy and plenty to supplement the 2 egg breakfast I got. Portuguese sausage is a must. Can't lose with this menu, weekday after 10am is a good time to go if you want to be seated with no line."

My fellow yelpers told me to try this place out and after reading the reviews, I decided it was worth the try and the drive from our hotel.\n\nAfter a bit of complaining from my family as we drove there and found a bit of a wait, the complaining stopped the second they took a bite out of their omelet.  The four of us go different omelets and I decided to get the Macadamia Nut pancakes with my omelet.  \n\n\"BEST OMELET I HAVE EVER EATEN!!!\" - Family\n\n\"........mmmmmm.......\" - Me\n\nI am having trouble finding the words to describe the food they have here.  Everything is amazing and the pancakes were RIDICULOUS!!  \n\nFor example, the food was so good I ended up buying one of their mugs.  Their little Babycake mugs.  Just so I will have a memento of my favorite breakfast place on earth.\n\nThanks right\n\nMY FAVORITE BREAKFAST PLACE ON EARTH!!!!!!\n\nI feel like going to Vegas, but only for the Babycakes.\n\nPeace"

It's worth the wait, but come early.  The wait was about 30 minutes or so, but they keep a pretty tight schedule in making sure you get seated before of within that time.  The staff remains friendly, and attentive from seating to getting refills.  A little crowded with a short dining window, but man, was it ever worth it.\n\nBut really, if there's any reason to go, it's those red velvet pancakes with the cream cheese frosting.

I'm a Red Velvet fanatic so I was in immediate heaven as soon as I took my first bite. I am typically not a fan of extras like whipped cream or chocolate chip toppings, but I welcomed each and every savory bite. This menu item also came with its own cream cheese syrup but I felt like the pancakes were so fresh and perfectly done that it didn't need any extras. I even ended up eating the entire thing after my Spam & Scrambled Eggs order!\n\nThis is definitely one of my top breakfasts spots. I can't wait to come back again to try the rest of the menu.

We wanted to find a GOOD breakfast spot that wasn't a buffet or touristy place on the strip.  We found this place on Yelp and were lured in by the red velvet pancakes and eggs benedicts.\n\nWe got there at about 10:30 am on a Friday morning and waited about 20 minutes for a table. I noticed that the menu and the music (island reggae) in the restaurant has a Hawaiian theme.  I saw Kahlua pig and Loco Moco on the menu - and they're particularly Hawaiian food. \n\nI ordered the Kahlua pig eggs benedict, and my husband ordered the country benedict.  We ordered a half stack of red velvet pancakes, which ended up arriving a bit before our two plates.  \n\nI'm actually not a big fan of pancakes, but I ate those pancakes like a starved person!  I loved that they were soft and moist and tasted like what I hoped red velvet pancakes would taste like - and not like I was eating a overly sweet cake like I was afraid I might be.  But like red velvet cake or cupcakes, it's more about the soft and moist texture along with what makes the cake - the cream cheese frosting.  The cream cheese frosting/syrup wasn't too sweet and pour out on the pancakes about the consistency of ranch salad dressing.  The little chocolate chips sprinkled on top were definitely made the pancakes irresistible. \n\nAs for the Kahlua benedict, they were good but not great.  When in Hawaii, Kahlua pig is one of my favorite things to eat.  Even living in So Cal, I've never found any Hawaiian place that has ever done Kahlua pig the way it's done in Hawaii.  Carnitas at some authentic Mexican restaurants are probably the closest, but still not the same. I was a bit disappointed with my benedicts since they also had a lot of cabbage in them, giving the Kahlua pig a slight bitter taste rather than the juicy pig taste I was hoping for.  The Kahlua pig tasted pretty bland otherwise, and was a bit soggy rather than meaty like I hoped.\n\nAs for my husband's country benedict, it tasted I guess as it should - like country fried steak with eggs.\n\nAs for the hash browns (I didn't wanna risk ordering the potatoes, since I've rarely found a restaurant that did breakfast potatoes well), they were perfect. It was fried to a perfect crispiness on one side and moist and potatoey on the inside.  These were probably some of the best hash browns I've ever had!\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this place and would definitely make the 20 min trip off the strip to go there again next time I'm in Vegas. I'm certain a breakfast place like this would do really well in So Cal. :)"

I kept blabbing about the red velvet pancakes to my girl and  convinced her that it was worth a try (she's not much of a foodie.. yet!) \n\nGot here before noon and was seated right away. I couldn't help notice this lady that was seated right next to me. She looked so familiar.. Well, it was my first invited friend on Yelp! She provides some of the most interesting reviews: Blair B.! Hi Blair! And Megan S., nice meeting you as well! What a small world..\n\nThe Belly Pleasers:\n\nCorned Beef Hash and Eggs: Came neatly plated, corned beef was the typical canned stuff but for being canned, it was satisfying. I must note that I do prefer the real stuff (shredded/chunky) but their stuff did have a slight advantage over almost identical looking corned beef I've eaten at other places before. There maybe something with the oil the cook it in or some special seasoning they throw on there?! I also decided to try their seasoned potatoes. They looked plain but once again, they were tastier than I expected. Results, Nothing over the top but I was happily filled up!\n\n*Chicken Fried Steak with Hash, still Reigns Supreme!\n\nCarrot Pancakes: I wanted to try something different, since my girl ordered the obvious red velvet pancakes that she wasn't gonna finish and scoot over my way anyways.. The carrot pancakes came with the same cream cheese syrup, nuts sprkinkled on top, had the same texture as the velvets and tasted good, borderline great.. BUT in no way compared to the Red Velvet Pancakes!!\n\nRed Velvet Pancakes: my girl ordered the short stack (3 pieces). She took a few bites but didn't really express her emotions much but I could tell by her facial reactions that it was captivating! She finished more than half the order, more than I expected and said \"they were delicious! I really liked the little sprinkled mini chocolate chips and the whipped cream\".. Another happy customer :).. \n\n\nRound 2: Everything was pretty much as Great as the 1st Time!"

Given the description, I really thought these pancakes had to be super sweet.  But they're not.  Even my sister, who isn't fond of sweets, loved these pancakes.  \n\nThe staff was nice enough to create a potato dish for my sister with potatoes, cheese, avocado, salsa, and sour cream.  It was really good and nice of them to be so flexible.\n\nI got the Adobo fried rice.  It was ok.  I have to admit, I am not a big fan of Filipino food.   Same thing with Hawaiian food. A little too bland for me.  But I love Chinese fried rice, so go figure. \n\nAll they had was Tabasco sauce, which I didn't think would work.  So I focused on the pancakes and took most of the Adobo fried rice home.  Heated up the next day and covered in sriracha, it's not too bad.\n\nMost of the tables are high tops which can be a little uncomfortable.  And this place is tiny!

            "review": "The cousins and I ordered:\n1.)  RED VELVET    7.95 (FULL) 5.25 (SHORT)\nTopped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles. Served with cream cheese syrup.\nThis tasted super delicious.  It wasn't too fluffy nor was it heavy.  Normally when I eat\npancakes from other establishments, I feel very heavy.  The combination of the whipped cream with the chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup blended well together.\n\n2.)  RICK'S ADOBO FRIED RICE  8.50\nA traditional Filipino dish made with marinated shredded chicken wrapped in an egg, garnished with green onions.\nI thought it was just okay.  I wasn't too much of a fan with the egg since it had no flavor to it.  My cousin said that because the Adobo Fried Rice already has enough flavor, to add sodium to the egg would just possibly be too salty.  I think I would just like the Adobo Fried Rice without the egg wrapped around it.\n\n3.)  KALUA PIG BENEDICT  9.75\nA toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, cabbage, poached eggs and our delicious hollandaise sauce.\nThis was my favorite.  I would come back here for this because I just love Eggs Benedict.  The taste of the Kalua Pig gave it a flavor that matched well with the Hollandaise Sauce.  A lot of people on Yelp felt that it was too bland.  I found adding some salt to the dish pepped that up.  \n\n4.) NUTELLA CREPES  8.25 plain or 9.25 (with seasonal strawberries)\nNutella mixed filling spread topped with fresh whipped cream and almonds.  \nThis was definitely a great way to end our meal.  It wasn't too overpowering with the Nutella and had the right amount in the crepe.  I'm not really a dessert person, but this was well done.  It doesn't look too hard to make."

Before I left the house, I made sure I had my coffee and cold water. \n\nI woke up at 8, picked up my friend, and got to Babycakes at 10. Not bad. \n\nIt was a weekday 10am, and there was a wait. Not complaining, but just want to mention that. We waited almost an hour for a table. When we got there it was PACKED! And there was at least 10 people ahead of us, and some waiting outside. \n\nIf there's a long wait.... it MUST be good. I don't mind waiting if it's something worth waiting for. And having a friend with me, we were able to do a lot of catching up! With women, that's always a good thing! You know we love to talk! hehe :P \n\nIt was about an hour wait... till we got our table. 11am. \n\nWe already knew what we wanted, we did some research on the menu online the night before. hehe. \n\nFull stack red velvet pancakes, kalua pig eggs benedict, and fried rice omelet PLEASE! And bring on the coffee, lots of it! \n\nOur waitress was really nice. Checked up on us every few mins, offered to refill our drinks and coffee. And didn't rush us, she even told us that there's no rush and we can still have coffee and chat even after finishing our meal. \n\n.......................Not sure if anyone else mentioned this but their COFFEE, is aaaaaaammazing!!!!!! I had about 4 cups of it! haha\n\nI LOVE coffee, but I don't drink that much every morning, I have 1 cup a day. But at Babycakes, It was like crack! I had 4 cups, I need to find out what it is!!!! \n\nSo anyways, on to the glorious food. \n\nI had the Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict, my friend had the Fried Rice Omelet, and we shared the red velvet pancakes. \n\nHonestly.... Surprisingly, I fell more in love with the kalua pig eggs benedict!!!\n\n I was looking forward to loving the pancakes more, but it was the opposite. I didn't think I would like the k.p.e. benedict, it was just suppose to be \"something to try.\"\n\nBut I fell....... hard.\n\nThere's just something about the yellow (hollaindaise?) sauce that was different than any other I had before. My fave meal of the day is breakfast, and my two fave breakfast items are pancakes and eggs benedict. I'm from Hawai'i and I love kalua pig, but on a eggs benedict...??? Who would've thought?! \n\nIt's aaaaaaaamazing! They were HEAVENLY!  It's definitely a must try! \n\nI sampled my friend's fried rice omelet.....and I gotta say, I've had better. It was HUGE though. My friend didn't finish it, but didn't take it home either. \n\nOkay now on to the star of the show: The Red Velvet Pancakes.\n\nHmmm... honestly, I think it's too hyped up. I've had pancakes else where and this didn't top it. It may be b/c my cousin makes these totally awesome red velvet cakes that can't compare to anyone elses... so the flavoring for the red velvet pancakes were just.... okay-good. My friends who told me about it, they loved it and said you don't have to add the cream cheese syrup, but I had to. I love intense flavors. It was Not spectacular. not heavenly. :( and I was sooo looking forward to it. My expectations were too high. \n\nWe ordered a full stack, it comes with 6 pancakes. The pancakes were thin and seemed small. For me, good pancakes = thick & fluffy, and at least medium size or large size. They seemed like they were smaller than those photos posted here or on their website. I don't think it was worth the $9 bucks. And I expected the chocolate chips to be slightly melted so I can smear it on my pancakes but they weren't. The red velvet pancakes are a good idea but I think they could've done better. But I will still try their other pancakes next time I'm there. \n\nThey were good, but this is not something I would look forward to the next time I'm here.  Others have different opinions so try it out for yourself. My friends who have tried, loved it. Don't take my word for it! It's definitely a must try, at least once! \n\nOH...... and if I haven't mentioned it yet, they play HAWAI'IAN MUSIC here!!!!!!!\n\nThat's the first thing I noticed when I stepped in and I felt like I was back home. :) That's definitely a plus with me. The owners are from Hawai'i. And with the good service and essence of it, they post the kids colorings of their mascot up (that's cute.) I felt like I was at a breakfast place back home. :)\n\nLooking forward to my next visit, I want to try the spinach eggs benedict and the smore pancakes. \n\nRumor has it the owner is looking into creating a 2nd location, I hope she puts it in Henderson! :) Cuz the 1 hour drive is too far! But still worth it. ;)"

Upon driving up to this place you can already see groups of people waiting outside so you must know that this restaurant is good. \n\nI had their Kalua Pig Benedict which I enjoyed a lot. I would recommend this dish to anyone who likes egg benedict. \n\nMy boyfriend had their Portuguese Sausage and Eggs and it was okay, don't think he'll get it again as the sausages were just sausages, nothing really stood out with this dish. The garlic rice that he order had too much garlic in it as well. Will not recommend this dish to anyone. \n\nTried a few pieces of their Red Velvet Pancakes and it was good, little too sweet for me, but no complaints here. \n\nAlso tried their Buttermilk Pancakes and again it tastes like pancakes to me. Honestly I can see why people would stand for over an hour to eat here, this please is pretty good, but next time I'm in town I would just pick up the phone and order, lesson learned. =]"

Never had a benedict like that before and it was evenly portioned out between the shredded pork and cabbage. Yanno how some places give you more cabbage than meat. Yuck. But not Babycakes!!\n\nThe pancakes come with an amazing cream cheese syrup which completes the entree. I was in heaven. We split both entrees so it was a perfect amount! Got a little bit of dessert and regular food.\n\nThis is A MUST GO TO spot if you have a car. The drive is worth it. We didn't even have to wait because we went at the buttcrack of dawn. But as time went on the place got really packed, FAST. Plus the restaurant is pretty small so I can see there being a wait. Also keep in mind they close at 3PM.\n\nAWWW YAH!"

Go get some yummy breakfast at Baby Stacks in Summerlin!\n\nSo many good things about this place.  Here is what I got to try so far:\n- Red Velvet pancakes with buttercream frosting topping.  Small little pancakes just the perfect size for a sweet taste.\n- Portugese sausage with eggs and rice.  This place gives you more than 4 slices of sausage!  I hate when I have to ration out my Portugese sausage to last the entire meal.  There were 9 slices I believe!  Enough to get your fix.  Upgrade your rice for garlic rice.  You won't be disappointed.\n- Kalua pork and eggs benedict.  Usually kalua pork is too salty but this one is not too salty at all.  My roommate thought it was bland but I would rather it be less salty than too salty.  An interesting take on the usual eggs benedict.\n\nI really want to take my parents here when they come to visit.  It is a cute little brunch place that anyone will enjoy."

Maybe I'm just partial to the places I've grown up with (The Egg and I, Blueberry Hill), but even still, I cant say the food is that great. The scrambled eggs had a very strange coconut flavor to them that caught me a bit off guard in a kind of unpleasant way. My pancakes tasted like, well, pancakes.

I cant say they were rude, but nobody seemed to engage with us or give me any reason to feel welcomed.

The husband asked for coffee while we waited, and the hostess was very accommodating. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see Hawaiian foods featured on the menu.  This place has a large selection of pancakes, but also has sandwiches and salads and such if pancakes aren't your thing.  The husband got the portugese sausage with the garlic fried rice option and I got an omlet with a side of the famous red velvet pancakes.  \n\nThe pancakes were as reported: awesome.  The omlet was just ok, as were the potatoes I got with them.  The sausage was ok too, but it would be pretty hard to screw up sausage.  The real disappointment for the both of us was the garlic fried rice.  Sounded so good in theory, but did not deliver.  There was too much garlic in it, and I love garlic.  Also, the rice was Uncle Bens.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to cater to Hawaiian transplants, you gotta come correct with the rice.  It has to be sticky calrose rice, not hard, dry Uncle Bens!  \n\nOverall, this place was decent.  If youre into pancakes, this is the place for you!"

            "review": "This review is for 4.5 stars.\n\nInspired by a meeting with my husband's relatives on their quick visit (that was so nice to see them) recently for breakfast at the Blueberry Hill (yum!) on Flamingo/Tamarus, I wanted to go out for breakfast on my birthday (a few days ago) and scoped out a few places (1) thanks to Yelp, (2) remembered this place, a few months back, from a benefit segment on the news and (3) may have heard about their best seller, Red Velvet Pancakes from a local radio show hostess (we hardly go out for breakfast, but I miss it). I am always checking out menus (but changed my mind on my choice---this menu has a ton of options) and since I'm on a restricted diet, look forward to eating a little more freely on my cheat days. \n\nThis is located in a small strip mall, corner pocket, and is a bit small, but it feels cozy and it is clean---turnaround time is fast because this is a popular breakfast spot (counted about 13 tables, booth and table/chair combos, with the booth side against the walls); not quite, a hole-in-the-wall. My son noticed the giant butterflies on the wall, by stating \"Big bugs!\" There were two tv's on opposite ends of the L-shaped restaurant. When we arrived, it was quiet, and many tables were empty. By the time we left, there was only one empty table, two tables if you count ours. When you walk in, there is the cashier (where you pay), and  the menu is posted on the wall at eye-level height (for me anyway, I'm short). \n\nOur server was Monica, and she was super sweet, outgoing, and helpful (suggestions) when we had questions about the menu. She was also pretty attentive, checking on us many times. \n\nMy husband got the german chocolate pancakes, the full stack. It was huge! It looked really decadent and more like a dessert. I had one, the little guy had half of one, and we took one and a half to-go. It was really good, light and fluffy, but very sweet (caramel sauce), so it's not something I would get (I don't have a sweet tooth). My husband loves his pancakes, but when we go again, said he would get the short stack with a side of something salty, sausage or something. Even the guy next to him (got the build your own omelet) was looking at it when it was brought to our table. I got the biscuits and gravy with two sausage links, and it came with my choice of potatoes, I got them seasoned. The gravy was very good, and the biscuits were soft (four). Little man liked the sausage and potatoes. I was going to get the adobo fried rice (that was my 1st choice), but opted for a less heavy item because lunch was going to be AYCE sushi, and I really didn't want to spoil my lunch (balance). I really enjoyed the hot chocolate, sprinkled with bits of chocolate (didn't melt), mmm. I would definitely get that again. It was full of flavor, not watered down, and most likely the best cup of hot chocolate I ever had, and when I told my husband, he said \"You downed it quick, someone didn't even offer me a sip\" My oops. If we go to a new place, I try to check out other people's food (but I'm not a neck-stretcher), to see how they look, and also portion size. Someone next to us got the red velvet pancakes and they looked decadent. \n\nI will definitely try something different next time. Hubby said we could always go out for breakfast and eat in for lunch or dinner, just to switch it off, and that way we could enjoy breakfast out sometime (he is the breakfast maker in our home). \n\nThere are four locations, two on the west side (summerlin, spring valley), one in the centennial area, and henderson. \n\nTo reiterate, a popular breakfast spot (all the reviews on Yelp, c'mon!), nice staff/very good service, great food, and definitely one place to meet out of town guests for breakfast."

            "review": "My boyfriend and I were in town during President's Week and ventured off to find a good breakfast/brunch restaurant in the LV area. He's dined at this restaurant before and vouched that their pancakes are delicious, and I read reviews on Yelp that their red velvet pancakes with a cream cheese sauce on the side is their signature pancake dish.\n\nWe arrived on a Thursday morning. There was a 30 minute wait, but that was a good sign to me that this place is popular with the locals. We were seated in the time frame that they promised, and the server greeted us warmly.\n\nThe menu had many entrees, of course, and many of them pertained to pancake entrees. However, I noticed that they had an extensive option of Hawaiian based breakfast dishes (loco moco,fried rice, etc). I wanted to stick to a smaller breakfast since I had a large dinner on the previous day. We stuck to their pancake entrees.\n\nHe ordered pancakes with infused bacon bits (odd combo I know), and mine was the red velvet pancakes. We both ordered the half order of three pancakes instead of full.  Of course, I can't live without ordering home fries to balance my palette off with something salty. Plus, I just love potatoes -- carb addict, I know. My boyfriend recommended the potato chips, and I went with his recommendation.\n\nWhen the red velvet pancakes arrived, the taste was on point. Every bite was simply amazing. They were fluffy, warm, and perfectly sweet. The cream cheese side complimented the dish beautifully. Not to mention, the whipped cream with chocolate flakes on top of the pancakes were a nice addition. Loved the dish.\n\nThe potato chips, on the other hand, were very oily and greasy. They were drenched in vegetable oil -- just gross. I didn't enjoy them at all. Very disappointing! I should've opted for the home fries.\n\nWhen we went to pay our bill, their computer system was down, so some of the diners were left waiting. They were polite about it, and the short wait didn't bother us. They still managed to get their credit card system working, at least. \n\nI would definitely return when I'm in the area, but I'd rather get my potato fix elsewhere."

I was surprised we didnt have to wait in line to be seated.\nEvangeline (our waitress) is a busy worker with a great personality. Keep it up!\nGoing right into it, I enjoyed the Mexican Omelette which had jalapenos thrown into it and served with seasoned potatoes on the side. 7 \nWhite Chocolate Macadamia stacks w/ cream cheese sauce were outstanding. 10!\nSteak and Eggs didnt seem to impress me at all. Hash browns had no flavor and eggs were bland as well. As for the steak, it was juicy but had to throw some A1 to get the flavor i wanted. 6\nI did digg their Hawaiian jams that came on every so often though. I guess you can say, it set the mood. \n\nMake sure you hit up this joint! Its more than worth it to stop by with their prices.\nIf it wasnt for the orgasmic tasting pancakes,  i believe they would be a 3 star restaurant."

Furthermore, no lattes, cappucino or espresso! BOO!\nOur eggs were so overcooked they were essentially hard boiled.  For a breakfast place, screwing up the eggs and coffee is sort of a big deal!\n\nPros:The hollandaise sauce is dreamy.  The kahlua pig benedict was excellent except for the above mentioned eggs.  The prices are fair. $50 for 4 breakfasts and 4 coffees. The red velvet pancakes were excellent and surprisingly not too sweet.\n\nWe also ordered a huntington omelette, and spinach benedict.  Omelette was o.k. Nothing special; on the dry side. Eggs were overcooked on this benedict as well.  \n\nService was o.k. We had to flag her down to take our order but she did keep our coffee full without asking. We waited 30 mins. to be seated at 10:30 on a Friday morning.  \n\nI'm willing to try them again but right now not so impressed."

Besides, I have a couple Groupons to use.\n\nSo gf and i originally decide let's hit it before we go to Aliante to sign up for nye bingo and pick up tickets for the Journey cover band playing post-bingo at Aliante.\n\nWhen we get to Babycakes, big surprise, the place is packed - 45 minute wait. We put our name in and take the chance to drive to Aliante and return in time for brekafast.  It did take 45 minutes but they already called our name - we did call them to ask that they move our name lower - they refused ...bummer.\n\nso we get back t Babycakes - another 30 minutes .\n\nWe order the Rick's adobo rice , the pork bennie and we dshared a small stack of the red velevet pancakes.  Service was good - timely refills, food came out reasonably fast.\n\nThe food ?  mixed bag - the gf's adobo rice - i didn't notice on the menu - it's an omelet filled with fried rice.  I like the creativity but didn't quite get there on taste - i kinda laughed since it reminded me of an occasional sunday breakfast for me - take your leftovers from the night before and jam it into an omelet.\n\nThe pancakes were tasty - didn't need the whipped cream - again, a creative dish.\n\nthe pork bennie  - again, i like the creativity and i did like the saltiness of the pork mixed with the egg but it definitely needed more bernaise sauce  and the potatoes ??  for such a creative menu, the potatoes SUCKED ! \n\nI have another groupon so i'm sure i'll hit  Babycakes again but not sure if it's travel worthy."

We arrived at 9:30; was told the wait would be 1 1/2 hrs to 1 hour and 45 minutes. As crazy as it sounds we decided to wait but left the premises and was back within an hour thinking we would have at least another 30 minutes before we would be seated. We gave our name and asked how much longer the wait would be, only to find they had called our name within 30 minutes and not 1 1/2 hour as they had told us. I think the girl at the counter felt bad and said \"let me see if I can seat you now.\" (obviously there was a table available) She asked an Asian girl who I later found out is one of the owners daughters. She said no; we would have to wait another 30 to 45 minutes now. I explained; this was our 4th attempt to eat here and was told the wait would be much longer than what it was, are you so busy you can't accommodate 2 people? The Asian girls answer was \"yes we are.\" I then asked for a manager and Vangeie (Asian girl) informed me it is a family owned business and she and her sister are the managers and there was no one Else to talk to. I told her I would be writing a review and asked Vengeie for her last name (Salonga); she then told me \"Oh and by the way my sisters name is Liberty.\" It is pathetic when you think you can be so cocky and disrespectful as the owner to think your business is invincible. Vangeie; I have been a business owner for 25 years and you need to learn about customer service if you want to stay in business. You might be so busy now you can send people away without a care, but restaurants come and go in this town and with your attitude and lack of customer service as the owner don't count on being around long. This is a small town and word gets out. Remember if one person has a bad experience they will tell 10 other people....make that 20. How stupid you are not knowing business 101.....customer service."

I was so torn between crepes or pancakes, so settled on the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes which reminded me of a slightly thicker Swedish Pancake with more tart flavor from the citrus. I also got a side of bacon because, protein. House coffee was very good as well. My friends got skillets and omelettes, and the bacon pancakes (cue Jake from Adventure Time! Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes, take some bacon and I'll put it in a pancake, bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make, bacon pancaaake!).

It takes a lot, something like red velvet pancakes, to make me venture out into another part of town. The possibility of trying red velvet pancakes made my friends and I wake up at 8 am on Presidents Day, drive about 40 minutes to Summerlin, and wait 45 minutes to get a table.  Despite all of that, I would do it all over again just to get a taste of those wonderful pancakes.\n\nMy two girlfriends and I shared these three menu items:\n\nRed Velvet Pancakes - yes, it lives up to the hype. The full stack came with 6 pancakes. The pancakes tasted like flat cupcakes and they are to die for. It was the right amount of sweetness. You may expect the whipped cream, chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup to be overwhelming but everything was just right.\n\nRick's Adobo Fried Rice - Adobo chicken is a traditional Filipino dish so my expectations were a little high on this dish. It came with fried rice with shredded chicken wrapped in egg like an omelet. It was very tasty and flavorful. We didn't really dig the macaroni salad. Someone was a little too liberal with the pepper.\n\nSpam Scramble - this was the only dish we didn't care for. It tasted as simple as it sounds... Spam with scrambled egg. I guess we just expected something different. This was something anyone could make at home and make it better.\n\nIf I were only rating the red velvet pancakes, I would give Babycakes Caf\u00e9 5 stars, hands down. I love the pancakes so much that I would make the drive out there again on my day off just to get a taste of them again."

Plus they can eat. Do locals own this joint? \n\nWe've only been once and would definitely go back based on our meals and experience. Per Yelpers' suggestions we went with the most popular items. \n\nRed Velvet Pancakes: Tasty and not just because it's sweet, but because the sweet is a delicious one. You can taste the red velvet which is important to me, yet in that usual subtle way. It's the white cream sauce on top that wins me over. Not tart or sugary sweet, but a perfect cupcake frosting kind of sweet. The simplest vanilla cream...it made me wanna get married all over again. I can definitely understand the hype with this dish, it's as huge as they say and as satisfying. I loved it and could not finish for the life of me. \n\nI'd recommend that if you crave dessert for breakfast like me. If you're a salt craver, they have a lot of meaty options. \n\nI had the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette because everyone talks about it and I'm a FOMO. I would go back for this dish and order it again and probably get stuck being one of those one dish wonders. I seriously liked it that much, and it's worthy to note that I normally don't care for adobo at all. Being from Hawaii, adobo is everywhere and most of the time it makes me gag, but hello adobo fried rice omelette you are the exception. I will be back for you. \n\nMy husband got the original Eggs Benedict and he loved it. The eggs were poached really nicely and he can be nazi about that so I hope this helps. \n\nThe food is much more Diner to me than Cafe. Great service. Our girl was really friendly and on it, but maybe because she could tell we were from Hawaii? There seemed to be a lot of locals eating while we were there. It's a vibe thing, you can always tell when you're in a place with your people."

Server is nice, and we didn't wait long for food. \n\nKAHLUA PIG EGGS BENEDICT is good, but not great. I guess I had higher expectations due to reviews raving about it. The crab eggs benedict in Magnolia Cafe in San Antonio, TX is still the best for me. It's far though. \n\nThe HASH BROWNS that came with the eggs benedict is good. Had some weird tasting hash in some breakfast places in Vegas. This is what I remember a hash should be. \n\nRED VELVET PANCAKE is awesome. Trumps any pancake I've eaten in my life. It's fluffy and moist, and has the right amount of sweetness. The portions are just right to fill me up. I give it 5 stars because their pancake is awesome. They trump any other breakfast place around town. (This doesn't exclude the high class breakfast places on the Strip, which I haven't tried yet.)\n\nWe'll be back again, but in their resto in Spring Valley. I think they're opening another branch, but I can't remember where. Hopefully it's close to where we live."

So one Saturday morning we decide we'd check out Babycakes.  I do happen to love red velvet cakes when done right so were looking forward to the red velvet pancakes, even though I'm not a pancake fan.\n\nAnyhow, we arrive at about 11:30 on a Saturday and the wait is 45mins, okay, we say, let's hope it was worth it.  It wasn't too bad, the actual wait time was about 30mins and we were seated.  There was all types of people, lots of families.  I order the Kahlua pig Benedict and half order of velvet pancakes, the mister got something ( can't recall so it was probably not that memorable) and banana pancakes.  He said his was just okay, but he tried my velvet pancakes and fell in love.  My Kahlua pig was so good, it had cabbage and shredded pork, just the right amount of hollandaise.\n\nMy velvet pancakes is were I was hooked, which is a lot for me considering I am not a fan of pancakes.  The pancake was soft and warm and the cream cheese syrup had just the right amount of sweetness....Babycakes has made me a fan of breakfast!  I will definitely be back, next time with my daughter cause I know she will be hooked just like her mama!"

This will never be a regular spot for me (5000 calories for bfast isn't a habit I need to get into!), but for a special breakfast this is the best place I've been off the strip in Vegas (sorry, Bouchon is still my overall fav!). \n\nThey get major props for letting you pay a minimal charge to upgrade to the \"specialty' pancakes when ordering any of the egg dishes. Honestly the smaller (2?) portion of these sweet things is perfect and it's nice to have an egg dish AND a dessert to go with it ! \n\nI had the breakfast burrito (special from the chalk board) and red velvet pancakes. The breakfast burrito wasn't much of a burrito (well not in a stupidly huge Chipotle sense), but more of a large taco. This was absolutely perfect for me - huge burritos are a turn off and I don't like the ingredient ratio you get with this burrito the size of your face. Burrito (bacon, eggs, cheese, potatoes) was perfect, but the red velvet pancakes did steal the show! Some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Ridiculously fluffy, perfect red velvet flavor - you must try these !\n\nMy husband has a certain fondness for chicken fried steak and sausage gravy. He's tried it everywhere here in town from Tiffany's to all the casino diners. He's always bummed that it's not nearly as good as what he's used to from TX. This place was by far the best we've had in Vegas and might be better than any in TX as well. The steak was tender (not chewy and gross), the batter was nice, and OMG the gravy was perfect. It seemed to not be frozen, or they buy an incredibly high quality frozen product - either way, they fooled me. Tasted homemade! He had the smores pancakes that were tasty, but not nearly as good as the Red Velvet!!\n\nI never thought I'd find a local place with BETTER pancakes than my favorite (Oreo Banana Pancakes at Bongo Room in Chicago, btw), but honestly they were! I'd put this breakfast spot up against any diner, anywhere. I'd love to see them add some coffee drinks to the menu (oh and expand to Henderson!)."

Fair warning: they don't seat you unless your entire group is present.

Gah... I really should start asking for names. Anyway...\nCool, friendly server that constantly checked on us and gave us updates when we couldn't get the entire order out in one go.

Even waiting in the front area, it just feels like there's not enough space for everyone to walk through--especially since where you pay is also where you wait.\n\nSERVICE: 4 - Our server was really friendly and helpful. He was fast and didn't want us to rush with eating, even though there were quite a few waiting people. He made us feel comfortable. The food we ordered also came really fast, which was a really nice change from regular waiting times. \n\nFOOD: 3 - Kahlua Pig Benedict: I usually really like Eggs Benedict, so I was really excited about trying one with pulled pork inside. I wasn't that impressed though with this one. I thought that the flavors were missing from my plate and I felt like they forgot to add an ingredient in. \n\nGarlic Fried Rice: I wasn't a fan of the garlic fried rice. It just felt wet, too oily, and the garlic was almost too subtle so that it just tasted like regular rice. It was a pretty big disappointment since people rave about it so much! For me, it just tasted like rice. \n\n**Red Velvet Pancakes (a must try!): The red velvet pancakes and cream cheese syrup that they make at this location are super good. The pancakes are warm and yummy. The way I eat them is I cut the pancake into pieces and dip them in the sauce..because pouring the sauce on does not cover enough of the pancake for me! \n\nIt's a pretty sugary breakfast, but damn. It is so good. \n\nTheir pancakes are the best, so I'll definitely be coming back to try the other flavors to get my morning sugar high on!"

I was not disappointed when I showed up. \n\nThe country gravy here is the best I have ever had. It's not that canned stuff, they make there own gravy here with bacon, milk, and flour. The biscuits & gravy and the chicken fried steak are the best things they got here. \n\nThe customer service is superb.

We were sold on the trek from the Strip based on their menu online.\n\nWe found this cute lil place that clearly had good food.  We were told it would be a 20 minute wait, but we were seated in under 5 minutes.\n\nThe waitress got the drinks quick and was ready with all our questions on the menu.  We had three different omelets that were picture perfect!  We tried their German Chocolate, Strawberry, and Cinnabon pancakes.  All were great lil piles of smiles!!\n\nA really great bang for your buck breakfast spot!!!"

With all the options around it is not easy to come up with a different breakfast menu. Its different than most places. BUT does it make it better?? My main complaints:\n\n1-OJ is NOOOT fresh or natural. WTF!!? You would expect a decent juice madeout of fresh oranges. Especially with the high ratings in Yelp. Nah. \n\n2-Burned coffee. Yes, burned. \n\n3-Slow service. I waited around 30min for a table and when seated, other 10-15min only for the first plates to be served. \n\n4-My fiance\u00e9 ordered the \"popeye crepe\" or something like that. The sauce (hollandaise?) was awful. Very greasy, salty, creamy and disgusting. I had the flavor in my mouth all day long. \n\n\nThe only decent thing was the walnut pancake. \n\nIll stay with Eggworks."

The red velvet pancakes are wonderful!  Not too sweet.  I had the garlic rice and eggs and it was savory and perfect.  My husband indulged in a Full Stack of the Rocky Road pancakes.  Really good, but rich and he took half home.  A short stack is plenty.  This place is close for us and I look forward to going back and trying more of their menu!"

Babycakes did and I had to try them with a quickness! \n\nI've been here twice already. The first time was with a girlfriend of mine. We were seated immediately, but then again, we came on a Monday morning. Of course, I had to order the red velvet pancakes... and I was not at all disappointed! They were done just right... fluffy, not too sweet, and the cream cheese syrup was the icing on the cake... well, the syrup on the pancake! :P They were so delicious and very filling. I only got the half stack (3 pancakes), but that was more than enough. My friend got the kalua pig benedict and she said it was spot on. I had a little bite and from what I tasted... it was good, but I was just so into my pancakes! \n\nThe second time was just a few weeks ago when my brother & sister were in town. The three of us and the bf came on a Saturday morning and waited about 40 minutes, but we knew to expect that and I told them it was worth the wait (since none of them had ever been here before). I, again, got the pancakes (but as a side, which is only two... enough to get my fix) with the bacon & egg breakfast. The bf got the kalua pig benedict with a side of Portuguese sausage. My brother ordered an omelet with some garlic fried rice and my sister had the spinach/mushroom/bacon benedict. Everyone was quite pleased with what they ordered. They all liked it so much, that my siblings want to come again the next time they're here and the bf really wants to try some of their other items. \n\nThe food is great, their prices are reasonable, and their staff is super friendly. I live on the SW end of town, but will continue to make the drive out there to get my pancakes! Hope that you all open another location soon... maybe on this side! :)"

I tell myself that I'm going to try one of the amazing looking pancakes, but every time I get there I remember the sweet smoky flavor of kahlua pork mingled with the warm egg yolk, rich hollandaise sauce, and crunchy shredded cabbage. I can't order anything else! My daughter has ordered the s'mores pancakes and I did get to taste those, which were heavenly. She has also ordered the spam sliders, but was disappointed to find out the spam was diced and cooked with egg and onion, instead of just spam slices. My parents have both tried different omelettes and have enjoyed them. The service is consistently attentive and the prices are reasonable.

We arrived around 10 am,  so it was not very busy and we were seated right away.  The hostess noticed my daughter and immediately set us up in a spacious corner table with a high chair.  I didn't have to sit awkwardly with a squirming baby in my lap waiting for a place to put her. \nOur server greeted us very quickly. She was friendly and attentive throughout the meal. Our drink order was taken right away,  my coffee was excellent and clearly fresh. (Bonus points for keeping it fresh after breakfast rush has slowed and there is a lull of customers.)\nFor breakfast I had the strawberry cream cheese pancakes with a side of toast and a side of bacon. The food looked appetizing and beautiful.  I had gotten the toast for my daughter,  but it was crusty and tasted like it had been sitting out. She shared my french toast and Bacon with me instead. The French Toast was outstanding and the bacon was thick and cooked to perfection. My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes. She requested extra lemons and they were delivered immediately. I tasted a bite of her pancakes and they were fantastic. Our coffee was never allowed to become empty or cold. \nOur check arrived on one bill which was promptly split when we asked, even though it was getting busier as early lunch dinners were arriving. The server didn't tell us to pay at the front,  so we waited a while before realizing.  In that time she did walk by us a couple times.  She was very busy,  but it might have been nice for her to stop and just let us know where to pay or ask if we needed something. There were customers waiting at this point so would have been nice for them if we had left that 5-10 minutes earlier. Didn't bother us too much though because we still had coffee and we were chatting. \nOverall it was a great experience and i am excited to take my son and my husband to try it sometime!"

Staff was helpful and pleasant, and the place was clean. It was a Sunday morning, the crowds weren't there yet, I think the line out the door started around 9 or so.\nMy husband ordered a Chocolate Milk to start, well I think they only put the C in, it was the lightest chocolate milk I ever saw, our friend ordered one too and his looked the same, I think one drop of chocolate syrup was added to each cup.\nFor breakfast he ordered the Breakfast Burrito with a short stack of S'Mores pancakes and I got a short stack of the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes with a side of Bacon. So my main gripe is about the pancakes, they weren't as light an fluffy as the SW location, they were also a tad over cooked and dry and my pancakes hardly had any bananas inside. My husband agreed that the pancakes weren' t as good this time. The Breakfast burrito was good and so was the bacon. My OJ tasted a little off as well so I just didn't drink it.\n I would visit this location again but with all the other Babystacks around town now, I think I'll skip this one until it's absolutely necessary."

Carrot cake pancakes, red velvet pancakes, lemon ricotta pancakes, and many more!  I was fortunate to try both the red velvet and carrot cake pancakes...YUM!  I had the Huntington Omelet both times (without the bacon) which had just cheese, avocado, and salsa served with country-style potatoes.  Good, but not extraordinary.  Coffee and OJ are average, but also good.  There are other unique items on their menu such as the adobo fried rice omelet (adobo fried rice wrapped in an \"egg burrito\") which my hubby liked.  Menu does not include many options for non-meat eaters (like myself), but there is a create-your-own omelet option.  \n\nService was not really good the first time (I got my pancakes after I was almost done with my meal...my hubby got his pancakes with this meal), but the second time was better.  The owner even came around to check on us.  Tables are tiny (if ordering pancakes plus meal, the plates don't fit!) so it's almost better to go as a three-or more party to get a bigger table...or to ask for one of the high tables, which look a little bigger.  \n\nAfter the first visit, I was reluctant to try them again.  But thanks to some coaxing from a friend, I decided to give them another chance.  Although this is not my favorite breakfast place, I would still go back to try more of their unique pancake creations and to support a local Filipino business. \n\nI'm hoping each time I try it, I'll like it better and rate it better.

We went on a Tuesday morning and there was still a 40min wait, which sucked because we both get hangry (a hybrid of hungry and angry) fairly quickly. We just sat silently perusing through the menu and smelling the delicious scent of fresh cooked food until they finally called us up.\n\nSince we already went through the menus, we threw in our food orders when the waitress asked for our drinks. We both ordered Spam and eggs with pancake sides. I got the Red Velvet and he got the banana. I believe both of our orders were over $11 because we got specialty pancakes and he upgraded to garlic fried rice. I felt that $8.95 for the Spam and eggs was a little pricey considering we got 3 pieces of Spam each and you could easily get about 10 slices of Spam from a can that's only $2.50. We really wanted a taste of home though, so we both got it. \n\nI specifically told the waitress I wanted my Spam crispy, but they gave it to me soft and floppy anyway, so I only ended up eating one piece. My boyfriend ate all his Spam, but hardly touched his rice because it wasn't what he expected (it had a lot of thick long strips of onions all over). I guess we're both used to the Filipino style garlic rice we always get at places like Nanay Gloria which just has small pieces of chopped up garlic and that's it. Having both chopped up garlic AND large strips of onions is just a recipe for halitosis. \n\nOn to the pancakes...\n\nMy Red Velvet pancakes were nice and moist. Even after piling on all the whipped cream and cream cheese syrup, they weren't too sweet either. They were definitely good, but it was the first time I've ever tried Red Velvet pancakes and I wasn't very blown away. There are a few other places in Vegas that also serve Red Velvet pancakes, so it's not exclusive to BabyStacks. \n\nMy boyfriend thought his Banana pancakes were alright. Rather than adding mashed bananas to the batter, they just put 8 small slices on top of the pancakes and serve it with syrup, so it's actually pretty plain.\n\nI guess I had very high expectations for this place due to all the outstanding reviews, so when I went I was a little disappointed. I mean, it's a good breakfast joint, but not something I'd be willing to wait almost an hour for after making the long commute."

It was again a weekday, though, and I noted that 15 minutes after I was seated, there were indeed approximately 10 people waiting.  That being said, I decided to tweak my ordering to include one of the Polynesian elements of the menu, and rather than getting potatoes or hash browns with my over-medium eggs and peppered bacon (yum), I got a mound of garlic and onion fried rice.  Very good call on my part.  The rice was slightly crispy and had slivers of onion and whole cloves of garlic which had a roasted, rather than pungent, flavor.  It was delish with the eggs!  And, as the trip demanded, I upgraded my pancakes to 2 small red velvet pancakes.  My taste buds cried a little.  :)"

Ours was definitely perfect to us today; she was wonderful! They check on you often, and they don't take forever just to serve you or bring you your drinks/food. A+ for their service, seriously. I've never been disappointed.\n\nFood: They have a lot of Hawaiian-Filipino-American fused food items on their menu, so I love that this place is very original for that. I ordered 3 spam and eggs over easy with garlic fried rice & hash browns on the side. I also upgraded my pancake. They're known for their delicious red velvet pancakes with whipped cream and cocoa powder sprinkled on top with cream cheese syrup (yum yum), so of course I upgraded to that. (Almost) Everything came out delicious and hot! However, I wasn't the biggest fan of their garlic fried rice. The rice was really oily and the garlic tasted burnt... I don't like wasting food that I paid for, so I ate it anyway. But I have learned my lesson. Other than the rice, the rest of my food was delicious!\n\nOverall experience: I really do enjoy this place. It's one of my favorite places to go eat at. It's affordable, inexpensive, and delicious. Service is great. The food is delicious. But never again with the garlic fried rice."

            "review": "After hearing about their infamous red velvet pancakes, and taking advantage of their Groupon offer, we decided to give this place a try.\n\nFirst of all, this place is small - we're talking seating for less than 50 people, give or take a few. I had read that there was usually a wait due to the popularity of the place and the lack of seating, but luckily for us, we were seated immediately when we arrived at 9:30 on a Tuesday morning. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nCountry fried steak: I almost always order country fried steak when it's on a menu, and this one was one of the better ones I've had in Vegas. It was really tender, and the outside was nicely seasoned. I also loved the fact that it came with country gravy with breakfast sausage in it - it was yummy and tasted like it was homemade.\n\nEggs: My eggs were over-easy, and they were cooked perfectly; no runny whites, only runny yolks, just how I like them. Hubby had scrambled eggs, and they were nice and fluffy.\n\nPotatoes: I had the hash browns and Hubby had the seasoned potatoes. The potatoes were crispy and didn't require any salt, but were pretty average.\n\nSourdough toast: I don't know how many times I've ordered sourdough toast only to be disappointed. That wasn't the case this time - this is the real deal - not that imitation white bread posing as sourdough.\n\nCorned beef hash: This was the canned version, which was disappointing. If there's one thing on a breakfast menu that most people expect to be homemade, it's corned beef hash. \n\nRed velvet pancakes: Hubby was nice enough to offer me one bite, and boy, was it delicious! It's the perfect balance of the red velvet flavor in a fluffy pancake. It came with whipped cream, chocolate crumbles and... wait for it... cream cheese syrup! I wanted another bite, but Hubby gave me that \"I love you, but don't even think about touching my pancakes or I will seriously stab you with my fork\" look. Yeah, I think he liked the pancakes. ;)\n\nService was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back soon."

Because of its size there always seems to be a wait, even during the week but the wait is worth it.\n\nLike others have mentioned the Adobo Fried Rice is a great staple of this restaurant. They have a wonderful selection of pancakes. The fiance raves about the Kahlua Pork Benedict. He has never shared so I cannot comment on that. I would say that their garlic rice can be hit or miss. Some days it is extremely tasty but others it is very greasy and bland. The Portuguese sausage is on point though!"

Their red velvet pancakes are awesome - you can never go wrong with those.  The cookies and cream and banana foster pancakes are great also.  There eggs and meats are just like any other breakfast place, but the reason to go there is for the pancakes.   Get there before 8:00 AM to avoid the wait on the weekends.

            "review": "Best breakfast place in Vegas by far.  I am a big fan of breakfast.  Egg and I and Original House of Pancakes are good, but the menus there get old with the same old stuff.  At Babycakes, there are so many nontraditional items on the menu. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered a short stack of Red Velvet Pancakes.  I don't like red velvet cake, but I loved these pancakes.  They are not too sweet, so the sweet cream cheese syrup tastes perfect with them.  They are also served with homemade whipped cream.\n\nI had a short stack of the S'mores pancakes.  While they were delicious, I'm not sure if the menu description matched what I got.  It says that it has marshmellow and chocolate cooked into the batter.  However, it's basically just two plain pancakes with a little marshmellow in between.  There was graham cracker and chocolate sprinkled on top that added the S'mores flavor.  It was good, but I think they could make it better by mixing chocolate into the batter.  S'mores is supposed to have melted chocolate anyway.\n\nI also had the portuguese sausage and eggs which was good.  \n\nService was great here.  When we came in, it took awhile for the hostess to take our name and she ended up taking down a party that came in after us before us.  But it was no big deal.  The wait time was not that bad. \n\nI will come back here again and again to try more of the menu items.  I already bought 3 of the groupons."

So might as well make it the best too. \nI came here a few days ago with a friend and the place was packed, waited about 30 minutes to get seated, but it was worth the wait. Once we we got seated we got immidiate service, our coffee was brought to us faster than we could order it. \n\nI looked at the menu for a good minute since everything looked delicious, i am a simple girl and dont like having to choose between so many awesone choices. Why cant i just choose them all?! \nAnywho, i ordered the red velvet pancakes(short stack) and 3 beautifully sized, fluffy red pancakes arrived in less than 10 minutes(now i remind you that i waited an extra 40 minutes to eat, so i was starving) \nand my friend ordered cookie butter french toast.\n\nAbout my pancakes: WHAT THE H*** WERE THESE THINGS MADE OUT OF? CRACK? I didnt eat the pancakes, i inhaled them. They were so good! I wanted more when i was done(even though i was about to explode) and still to this day i am craving them. \n\nFrench toast: i tried some of my friends and it was delicious as well. If i wasnt so stuffed from my pancakes i probably would of inhaled them too while my friend was in the bathroom. \n\nI definetly recommend this place. The food wasnt the only thing that was outstanding, the service was as well."

I love the various pancake selection and that the pancakes themselves are good and comparable to what I would make at home. The coffee has always let me down, but service has never disappointed me since the day they opened. \n\nThe reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of consistency with the pancake batter. Like I said, I've been eating here since they opened. I notice when they change the batter. Most times I get the perfect melt in your mouth pancakes. There was a period I was less frequent because they pancakes were too stiff. I understand they probably play with the recipe to make sure they produce pancakes that hold up under the various topping choices, but I hate stiff and rubber like pancakes. My last visit the pancakes found their way back to their original glory. \n\nFavortie pancakes:\n\ncarrot cake\nbanana fosters\npeanut butter and banana\n\nLuckily large portions does not equal good food to me. If that's your criteria for a \"good' meal then you should go somewhere else. I'm a fan of them not giving me more food than I can or should eat, and I will always comeback for the pancakes."

All tables were in use but there was no other people waiting but us.  So we waited about 10 minutes and immediately got seated.  It really is a small restaurant so be prepared to wait upon arrival if you go in the afternoon.  I ordered the Adobo fried rice omelette and gf ordered the kalua pig eggs benedict.  \"Hey babe, wanna try this?\" I said this because i wanted to try hers! HEHHEHE!!  Kalua Benedict was a different taste, but way better than the classic eggs benedict.  But dont get me wrong, i was happy with my Adobo fried rice omelette, filling indeed and it came with some bomb mac salad.  (QUICK NOTE: mix some tabasco in with the mac salad! gives it a kick! a karate-judo-brazillian jiu-jitsu-MMA-KICK!)\n\nNext is the Red Velvet pancakes, MY GOSH!! they're so good it deserves its own paragraph! Super moist on the inside, crispy outer rim crust. and  the cream cheese syrup and the whipped cream complimented it so well.   Good thing we only ordered the short-stack to share.  We had it as our desert for after our breakfasts.  Our total bill came out to $24 bucks.  not bad eh?\n\nOur waitress was nice and friendly, polite and brief. No complains there.  They also had 2 big tv's to watch while waiting for your food.  All in all, i recommend this place to everyone, and I will bring my friends and family here if/when they come and visit."

In the past we have had, the orange creamsicle, red velvet, maple bacon, nutella, banana cream pie, and carrot cake pancakes. They're all really delicious but SUUUPER sweet. My little family consisting of me, bf, and our 4yr old usually just order a short stack and share between the three of us. They have filipino-esque dishes like adobo fried rice along with hawaiian fusion options like Loco Moco. \n\nMy bf's favorite is their patty melt. It IS delicious but the last time we had it, I think they added an extra helping of grease.... which my bf didn't mind, LOL. \n\nMy favorite USED TO be the Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict, but recently, their hollandaise has had the consistency of pudding, the color of cheez whiz and the taste of.... idk, NOT hollandaise. Tis a shame because I always ordered it when we went. The last time I ordered their Kalua Pig grilled cheese and although it was delicious, it too, had an extra helping of grease. I couldn't finish the whole thing so I just handed it to the bf.  \n\nOther than the hollandaise, this place is pretty consistent and although I have a hard time picking out stuff to eat (partly bc I'm filipino and can cook a lot of what they offer), we can't help but to keep coming back for their pancakes. The 4yr. old is a definite fan! :D\n\n*Also, they've opened up a second location in Spring Valley (still on Buffalo Dr.) It's still a ways from our place but close enough to have in the back of our minds when weekend brunch approaches!"

It kinda sucked bc we'd see parties of two arrive way after us but get seated right away.  :(  It's not their fault that they have many more two-person tables, but it was still irritating.  \n\nAnyway, once we were finally seated, we ordered pretty quickly.  You get a side of buttermilk pancakes with most orders (a stack of two) and can pay a small fee to upgrade to a flavored one.  I think they should offer an option to get one pancake bc I saw a lot of people leave a ton of leftovers due to the amount of food.  I got the Chili Omelet, which had Zippy's Chili (my favorite from Hawaii!) on top and inside.  Though there was Zippy's Chili inside, I wish they put more on top.  It was pretty basic - just an omelet filled with Zippy's!  Good but not great.  The has browns were really good, though, as they were crispy and not soggy.  I also upgraded to the Red Velvet pancakes, which came with a deliciously sweet whipped cream (they must make it there bc it def did not taste like the canned kind), chocolate bits, and cream cheese sauce on the side.  The cream cheese sauce was super sweet, but I liked it, though the whipped cream was probably enough.  Pancakes were light and fluffy and really good.  My friends got the chili verde omelet, which she found to be very average, and my other friend got spam and eggs.  I can fry spam myself at home, so I never order it out, but she had a craving for it.  One friend got a side of buttermilk pancakes, which she said was good.  Food came quickly, and we ate just as quickly since another line was building up.  The place had a constant flow of people coming in.  I can see why, though.

With the build your own, it comes with potatoes which are like little hash brown and a choice of 4 items (choice of 1 cheese, 2 veggies, 1 meat). I opted for spinach and mushroom, pepper jack cheese, and sausage! It was delicious! I personally love eating potatoes and hash browns of the sort with ketchup and tabasco sauce. I was rather surprised because my boyfriend doesn't usually like that kind of stuff so it was great that he wanted mine instead of his own. \n\nThe menu is pretty eclectic, they had hawaiian-ish/filipino food too, but they specialize in breakfast foods of course!\n\nIts a decent drive into the town of Summerlin where my best friend had resided for awhile, but definitely a place to check out if you have some time to spare and want to grab a hearty breakfast before you hit the road!"

The service was spot on and the food was amazing.  I loved watching the plates come off the line.  I didn't know that it was Hawaiian owned and the Hawaiian plates on the menu were a pleasant surprise because I love all things Hawaiian.  \n\nHusband had the deliciously yummy banana cream pancakes, I had the kahlua pig eggs benedict.  I love eggs benedict and pride myself on knowing if a hollandaise sauce is freshly made or not.  This one was.  I could drink the stuff.  Anyway, overall this place had great service and awesome food so support this little local business."

            "review": "When Babycakes Cafe first opened in October, we were invited to join the Husband's cousins in experiencing this new breakfast joint.  Unfortunately, we couldn't make it out that morning but heard raving reviews from them and soon after, it was blowing up on Yelp!  It's been on our radar since, and when a groupon for Babycakes showed up, we scooped up on this coupon!\n\nYesterday was the big day - most importantly, we wanted to avoid the weekend rush.  Reviews about an hour long wait weren't something we were interested in, and luckily, it was only a ten minute wait for our party of three on a Wednesday around noon.\n\nWe decided to share three items that were unique to Babycakes Cafe than other breakfast joints in town.\n\n* Red Velvet Pancakes \"Topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles.  Served with cream cheese syrup.\" (Full stack $7.95, Short stack $5.25) - First off, I'm not the biggest fan of pancakes and it's not my first choice in breakfast.  But hands down, these pancakes are REALLY good.  They aren't too fluffy or thick.  The sweetness is just perfection and sweetness from the cocoa, whipped cream, and syrup all add to this yummy cake.  I was sold and would definitely reorder this over and over again.  We went for the full stack to share, which was a very smart choice! \n\n* Kalua Pig Benedict \"A toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, English muffin.  Topped with our delicious hollandaise sauce.\" ($9.75) - The Husband and Truc N. were loving this dish.  As Truc was saying, he doesn't really like pork all that much but he really enjoyed their version.  They both complimented on how moist the meat was and enjoyed the savoriness.  The accompanying potatoes could use a something something though. \n\n* Rick's Adobo Fried Rice \"A traditional Filipino dish made with marinated shredded chicken wrapped in an egg, garnished with green onions.\" ($8.50) - This was the downfall of our breakfast.  It was a huge scrambled egg concoction with the fried rice mixture inside.  I was the first to split it open and there was a weird smell that came from it.  And then the taste, I wasn't quite getting it and wasn't sure if this was how it was supposed to taste.  When the Husband got into it, he ultimately said their burned it - the rice, the meat, just everything inside.  I'm still not sure if it was intentional to have the 'burnt' taste or not, but all of us were not impressed with it.  Not something we recommend.\n\nOverall, they have some unique items that make them stand out - specifically the first two items we ordered and additional things like Honey French Toast, S'more Pancakes, Bacon Pancakes, seasonal items like Pumpkin Pancakes and Macadamia Nut Pancakes.\n\nService - it did take awhile for our food to come out.  And I can only imagine how much longer the wait may be on weekends after you get seated.  And yes, there is more than just the food here, the view is quite nice too for the men.  I don't recommend coming with a large group as it's a small restaurant and there isn't that much room for large groups."

I walked in and it was packed. Decided to take food to go. Ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes and the Loco Moco. Shoots!! First off let me tell you about the pancackes. Soft, moist & delicious!! The taste was not to sweet like a regular Red Velvet cake. The cream frosting and crushed macadamia nuts complimented it just right. And the Loco Moco was the biz! Gravy was soo good! It had little chopped up mushrooms too. Patty and egg cooked just right. This place will definitely be a must next time I'm back in Vegas. I highly recommend that you try this spot out."

The place is small, but has plenty of solid food options to choose from. \n\nI tried the loco moco breakfast which was scrambled eggs, white rice, a hamburger patty, and delicious brown gravy over the top. I also chose to replace the macaroni salad with hash browns. My wife ordered the biscuits and gravy with seasoned potatoes. Her plate arrived  with 3 massive biscuits and a white gravy that had bits of sausage throughout. \n\nWe topped off our order with a short stack of their red velvet pancakes. WOW-- these are great. However, a little too sweet for me to eat as an entire breakfast. My 3 year old son could not stop talking about these red pancakes, and even wanted them for dinner that same day.\n\nService is efficient, and the staff is friendly. Our bill came out to $28.00  not including tip."

But, we were around the area running errands and found some time to see what everyone was hooting and hollering about. I'm glad we did.\n\nWe walked in around 11:30 and it was semi crowded. We got seated quickly and service was quick. Right away someone took our drink order and also brought our daughter a kids menu and crayons (that was very important). My daughter also noticed the decor, especially the 2 huge butterflies on each side of the beautiful flat screen that was on ESPN. I really liked that decor...not the butterflies but the ESPN. They also put up the kids Babycakes menu colorings all around the restaurants. You can also see the cooking area, it is small but they churn out ONO grindz!\n\nThis was our 1st time but we've heard enough through our friends and  Yelpizzles on what we should try. My wife ordered the Cowboy omelette which was pretty big and ordered their new Rock Road Pancakes. I ordered the Kalua Pig benedict.\n\n~RR pancakes. Our kids loved it and what kid wouldn't. The chocolate pancakes were fluffy and loaded with mini marshmallows, choco syrup, slivered almonds, and topped with whipped cream. They also have other pancakes which you can get in full or short stacks. ( we'll try these next time)\n-Red Velvet\n-S'Mores\n-PB & Jelly\n-Lemon Ricotta\n-Carrot Cake\n-Bacon Pancakes\n-Whole Wheat\n\n~Cowboy omelette-  For $9.95 she got good size 4 egg omelette with ham, peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese. And you can get either toast or get 3 buttermilk pancakes. You can also upgrade the pancakes to any of the above.\n\n~Kalua Pig Benedict was really good. I've had this before at other restaurants and they get thumbs down, but Babycakes does it right. The Kalua Pig-shredded pork has a nice smokey flavor and not too salty is served on a toasted English muffin, topped w poached eggs, and a nice hollandaise sauce (they don't slather it on...It was just on the eggs). They also put a bit of sauteed cabbage on the tender Kalua pig which added a nice crunch. You might think to yourself \"Why cabbage?\" In Hawaii we grew up eating a dish called Kalua Pig and Cabbage, it was an easy and delicious home cooked meal. This a favorite in my book.\n\nI saw the person next to me order the Loco Moco and i wanted to reach over and snake a bite from him. But, my wife said don't do it. This will be my next choice.\n\nBabycakes is worth the drive and the wait. We've been here once and it won't be our last. But, we do have a message to Babycakes owners....Babycakes please make your way to GVR area...PLEASE!! \n\nA Hui Ho"

(the 4 stars are also a result of the lack of interest our waitress showed in our meals and questions) The reason I'm really writing is to tell the world that everyone needs to add red velvet pancakes to their bucket list! Don't trust other bad reviews. They are by NO means too sweet! Infact they are very mind...perfect id say! The cream cheese sauce even comes on the sie so u can add to your liking!"

The eggs benedict came with a biscuit instead of an English muffin.  It was the best I ever had,  I love eggs benedict and have had many, this is the best. Coffee was great and that is important.  This is a definite must every trip, you can't go wrong. Great servers,  always in good moods, nice and sweet."

If this is how you operate your establishment here baby's tacks, this will be the first and only time I will come here.\n\nThe food was mediocre ..I ordered the cowboy omelet with salsa, well the salsa didn't look like salsa so I didn't even touch it.

Okay that's a personal preference.\n\nThe menu says the corned beef hash is homemade. It tasted and looked like it was from a can, maybe doctored a bit but from a can. It tasted okay but nothing special. I ordered seasoned potatoes and I swear they were a commercially available brand. I also had an order of sourdough toast but where was the butter?

The Adobo Fried rice is good, but similar to a lot of Filipino Adobo at any other Filipino Restaurant and again is pricey. Also, the portions are very average. Its a ten to 12 dollar meal that doesn't really fill you up like island food can, so bring a bag of chips or get ice cream on  the way home  Eggs benedict are good and there are a lot of different styles of it so that cool to try. Red Velvet pancakes are good if you really have a sweet tooth. $4 dollars for three strips of o-k tasting bacon....oh no.....\n\nThe service, its a little slow...its gets really crowded, and the servers can be pretty smug...Half of the servers are really hospitable and the other half seem annoyed. We were a big group and we waited about an hour...\nMy friends Waffles came out so late, that he asked to cancel them...for Waffles....there explanation was that the waffle machine wasn't working correctly and they wanted to make them just right...He cancelled but they still gave it him when our meal was basically done, and they still charged him...really...and they were just O-K.....\n\nI love the ideas in this restaurant, but I expected way more and have had way better food, at a better price with better service.

The carrot cake pancake is exactly what it sounds, it was just like eating a slice of carrot cake. Pretty delish.. the Almond Joy pancake was a little overwhelming. I think that flavor should stay with the chocolate bar alone. We had a 45 min wait, the service was good and fast. They have such a diverse selection for pancakes its amazing but if you're feeling overwhelmed just try the red velvet, you can't go wrong! They serve the pancakes half stack and full stack. Half stack is 3 pancakes and full is 6. Not sure who can eat a full stack but kudos to you. This is definitely one of those places you kinda have to try once."

I'm not a pancake fan but I did try their pancakes on 2 occasions, the carrot cake pancakes come with a cream cheese syrup and was delicious, as is their red velvet pancakes but both are super sweet and are more of a dessert to me than breakfast food. I like this place because it has a Hawaiian fusion menu and is good for a change up in breakfast every once in a while. The loco moco is good but not the best I've had, could of used a bit more gravy. The kalua pig benedict completely lacked flavor and the portuguese sausage is extremely greasy but tasty, Ricks adobo fried rice is just okay, nothing I would ever order again."

This is a cool inbetween middle of Hawaiian breakfast and American style breakfast that is similar to what we would have at home. It's the varied options that bumps this place for us. I cannot eat pancakes alone for breakfast as it just is too much, too sweet, so it never seems worth it for us to get a full order at many places and they don't do short stacks of flavored ones. Here, many of the breakfast come with a option of a \"babystack\" (2 pancakes) and you can upgrade it to the many gourmet flavors for just $1.50 more. That amount with a savory breakfast seems perfect and costwise is great to get breakfast AND the flavored pancakes for under $10. Most places we would have to basically order pancakes as our third entree plate and that's usually too much to eat without others sharing.\n\nI tend to favor their omelettes, as they are pretty fluffy and a good size or I let my Filipino all hang out and get a simple breakfast eggs and sausage type plate with rice.\n\nOur go-to pancake flavor is the lemon ricotta. This one is a bit more crepe or german pancake like and is just very light in flavor. Lemon flavored sweets is a new thing for me, and this place definitely has helped convert me We normally get another rich flavor to contrast. However, the chocolately type pancakes here are not overly saccharine and dense. We had a almond joy flavor recently off their specials and it was fluffy, and just deliciously balanced. Nothing richly sweet like the chocolate bars. Chocolate pancakes is one of my least favorite kinds, but theirs is highly enjoyable for me. I've had their famous red velvet before, and honestly, every other flavor I've had surpassed that one so don't be afraid to delve out of the box. \n\nService has been pretty decent of a range of acceptable to great. It's always at least friendly consistently. We go during the afternoon mostly, so it's never been a wait but is busy. I'm not sure if this place is packed with a waiting during usual breakfast hours on weekends, but I imagine so. If you don't like waits, well breakfast at breakfast time is maybe not a good thing to do.\n\nI have yet to try some of the specialties like the kahlua benedict, but mostly because I have trouble thinking about coming here and not getting a pancake. They sound great though that it just might be worth it! In fact, I think I may go this weekend again. I've been on a big breakfast kick lately since we've been waking up early."

DURRRRR. yes. i am slow... but i got there!). he got excited and grabbed a menu. it was sensory overload as we studied the menu like a doc studies a brain to be dissected. before we were even taken to our seats, he decided on the adobe fried rice and the red velvet pancakes. ask i am not a fan of getting the same thing as whoever i'm with (i'll admit, i was a little sad. those were both things i wanted to try hahahaha) i went with the special: white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes and the portuguese sausage and garlic fried rice. actually it was the sausage and it came with rice and pancakes and eggs. i just added the garlic fried rice and white choc mac nut pancakes. and i'll tell you. \n\nLOVE.\n\nL. O. V. E. \n\nthe mac nuts in the pancakes weren't huge and annoying as some mac nut pancakes are. the white chocolate kept its shape but melted easily so it wasn't just huge chunks of chocolate. the portuguese sausage went really well with the garlic fried rice. if you like spicy like me, a little tabasco makes it even better. \n\nnext time, red velvet pancakes and cream cheese frosting, you are mine. \n\noh and btw, love the interior. lots of nice natural light. \n\ni think the only thing that would make this place even better is macadamia nut syrup for their coffee. or kona coffee."

It was 1:30 and I walked in, was greeted and led to a table and told my server would be right with me. \n\nA couple was enjoying huge platters of pancakes and what looked like French Toast nearby. The mood was livened by reggae music playing. \n\nMy trepidation about arriving 30 minutes prior to closing was alleviated straightaway by the cheerful server. She was more than happy to suggest the Turkey & Avocado sandwich when I said I was debating that or salad. I opted for the $1 add on fruit salad in lieu of a side salad whose dressings all sounded heavy to me, and I'm not sure if fries were an option, but I avoid them. \n\nMy sandwich was huge. Hard to get my mouth around huge. Thick slices of toasted wheat bread housed a generous portion of very good turkey, fresh avocado slices and tomatoes, and lots of iceberg. It was so large I took half to go along with half of my fruit salad which contained strawberries, melon, grapes, blueberries and pineapple. I made the oversight of failing to request mustard or to put mayo on the side, so it contained quite a bit of mayo (unnecessary because the turkey was moist and avocado only added to that) \n\nChatted with some of the staff who were very sweet, and in no way felt rushed so close to closing time. I'll definitely be back to try some other items and bring my chocolate lover friends in for those red velvet pancakes. Some of the crepes and other pancakes sound promising. \n\nThere was cute and cheery decor and the place was clean and inviting. After reading of long lines, guess I lucked out taking a chance. \n\nFor 11$ + 5& tip because my waitress was just so sweet talking about explaining skype to her grandma in Hawaii, I enjoyed a lovely lunch & dinner later on. \n\nGlad to have finally discovered this neighborhood gem and look forward to supporting a charming local business."

Me and my family went here for breakfast on 5/3/12 and after 6 months of researching for a great place to eat breakfast in Vegas i was set on Babaycakes after reading about thier red velvet pancakes.  Yum!  Im a fanatic about awesome breakfast and red velvet cake so to find a place that puts both of things together in to one dish made my day.  I got the long stack which came with six pancakes and a heaping scoop of whipped cream, butter and these chocolate chip coco nib things.  When i bit in to it the cakes were nice and warm and had just the perfect amount of sweetness with the cream cheese syrup.  Perfection.  The whipped cream and cocoa nib things were just the perfect amount of sweetness and was not overly sweet especially for me a person who doesnt have a sweet tooth.  It was heaven on a plate.  When i was done i felt very fool and satisfied with nothing left on my plate.  My lady had the breakfast burrito and it was really good espcially because i have a high standard for breakfast foods and its hard to mess it up.  My daughters shared the usual which was scrambled eggs, sausage and the regular pancakes.  My mother inlaw had portuguese sausage and french toast and she really liked it she said it reminded her of home and made her feel like she never left Maui lol.  \n     All the food was exceptional for diner food and the prices were very reasonable.  Babycakes is a little restaurant outside the Las Vegas strip probably a 13 min. drive but well worth it.   The atmosphere and decor is like a typical diner. but more hip because it has a flat screen tv lol.  The service was exceptional and attentive and our waiter was very nice and patient and hooked it up with some crayons and paper for my girls.  Our food took about 15 mins which is not that long but like the drive its well worth the wait for it.  All the food came out hot and steaming although the presentation isnt anything to write home about, but once you take that first bite, devine!  Are you drooling yet???\n     I highly recommend this place for breakfast people especially for those that love red velvet cake.  When you pull up to this place it seems like its a hole in the wall but once you walk in its a whole different world.  I believe its one of the best breakfast spots in the area and even though its away from the strip it creates a suspence so dramatic that once you get there you wish it didnt end lol.  Enjoy!"

The breakfast is done well, they have tons of unique pancake concoctions, the price is reasonable and they do a military discount. The only downside is the size of the facility; it creates a bit of a wait if you're there on the weekend. In any event, it's WORTH the wait!"

A little on the small side for Vegas but just about right for a nice sit down meal with friends and family.  Friendly atmosphere and staff make you feel like your in someone's home rather than a strip mall.\n\nAlthough comfortable, I did not like the bar table setup we were seated at.  About half the seating is bar height and the rest your normal booth/chair setup.\n\nMenu is a mixed bag of Breakfast fare, definitely Asian/Hawaiian influences with your typical pancakes, waffles, and benedicts.\n\nWhat we tried:  Loco Moco; bland gravy and patty was prepackaged and had no flavor.    Adobo fried rice; definitely fried but no distinct adobo flavor...the presentation was odd as well, almost sent it back thinking I got the wrong order (rice is stir fried then folded into an omlette) .  The macaroni salad that came with the omlete was runny and bland...and seriously who serves mac salad for breakfast?\n\nThe food was decent but not exactly what I was expecting... I think maybe they are going for Hawaiian/Asain-Fusion on some of the items (Adobo Fried Rice, Kalua Pig Benedict) but for the most part I think they are missing it.  \n\nGets pretty busy so make it early on a weekday to save yourself the wait."

            "review": "Baby Stacks is a very cute breakfast joint that reminds me of grandma's kitchen. Unlike other chains of breakfast restaurants such as IHOP or Denny's, Baby Stacks definitely has an aura of individuality, making it a fantastic ma and pop hideaway. You can almost be certain the recipes are original and as homemade as it can get . With it's homey country style decor and easy, laid back ambiance of staff (all servers are casually dressed in jeans and a t-shirt), this place is definitely the spot to go to for breakfast and a newspaper.. or brunch dates with a few close friends. \n\nDefinite Recommendations:\n\nRED VELVET PANCAKES *Signature dish*  (short stack $5.75/ full $8.95). \nBefore trying these pancakes, I was never a fan of red velvet cakes because they were always too sweet for me. However, these pancakes were amazingly balanced in taste that it blew my mind away. It's served with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles along with the most delicious cream cheese syrup. The pancakes itself is fluffy to the taste and sweeter than your traditional buttermilk pancakes. (In this case, the sweetness comes from the pancake rather than the syrup we're so used to in regular pancakes). \nThe best part about this dish is definitely their cream cheese syrup. The creamy cheesy flavor of the syrup extremely compliments the sweetness of the pancakes, balancing it out, making ever bite the perfect combination of sweet, with a hint of salt and richness. Words cannot describe how amazing this dish is so definitely try it for yourself!\n\nKULUA PIG BENEDICT ($9.75)\nThe Kulua Pig Benedict is an English muffin layered with Hawaiian style slow-cooked shredded cabbage and pork, poached eggs and topped with hollandaise sauce. This dish definitely kicks the traditional Benedict to the next level. The Kulua pig taste so tender and juicy with just the right amount of saltiness that goes well with the muffin and sauce. You can get this dish with a side of seasoned potatoes that are delicious with or without ketchup/ sauce.  I always get this when I'm in the mood for something light that I know can fill me up right away and then easy to take home later to eat again. Because this dish comes with 2 Benedicts, it makes portioning the meal perfectly, and definitely something I recommend if you want to split with someone else.\n\nCORA'S CORNED BEEF HASH AND EGGS ($10.95)\nNow I know corned beef hash is a very common dish that can be purchased anywhere. There's really only so much you can do with corn beef, however, the corn beef at Baby Stacks has a very fresh flavor that definitely separates it from the canned corned beef you find in the stores. The flavors definite taste homemade, with a delicious garlic flavor that follows every bite. The dish comes with 2 eggs and a choice of either buttermilk pancakes, hash browns, seasoned potatoes or steamed rice ( you can always upgrade ).. My suggestion is to upgrade to their garlic rice *drools*.. It's simply rice that is fried in garlic and onions, enhancing the flavors of the beef to the next level. With Tabasco and ketchup on the side, this dish is definitely my favorite dish of all time."

In fact, I have yet to encounter a pancake that didn't make me swoon.  The non pancake dishes and even the coffee are whatevs, but the pancakes are reason enough for me to return again and again.  Carrot cake and Red Velvet are my favorites on their regular menu, but keep an eye out for their seasonal specials because THOSE are spectacular, particularly the pumpkin pancakes... yummo! \n\nI am glad I only live around the corner, because the wait times on the weekends are ridiculous.  I have done it once and learned my lesson. (Boy, was I grumpy!) Weekday brunch dates when my husband rolls into work after noon are wait free!  Stick to the pancakes and you won't be disappointed!"

IRL. JUST HAPPENED. Ok, so not only do they have Red Velvet Pancakes that are served with Whipped Cream, Chocolate Crumbles and CREAM CHEESE SYRUP (more like a not so think icing) but they also have S'MORE Pancakes, Peanut Butter and (Jelly, Banana, Chocolate...you pick) Pancakes and one of my personal favorites, Bacon Pancakes (aka: a one stop shop). \n\nThey also offer a variety of traditional breakfast options, as well. We wanted to try the Red Velvet Pancakes but knew that it would be sweet overload so we opted to also get the bacon and eggs breakfast. Their seasoned potatoes need a little more seasoning but other than that, delicious. A great savory balance to our sweetest ever breakfast. \n\nThe place is totally CHARMING with high-top tables, flowers and a GREAT waitstaff. I spilled my drink all over our table (in typical Katie fashion) and we had 2-3 staff members come over to help us clean it up.\n\nThe best part was as we were wrapping up (our $20 bill....bang for your breakfast buck!), Andi and Austin, who recommended the place to me, walked in the door. Andi said she had woken up saying \"Pumpkin Pankcakes....\" and they headed out the door. \n\nI'll be heading out the door every weekend to my new favorite breakfast place."

It didn't take too long for the food to come out either for a place that was busy. Sadly I was on a budget that day so all I got were nutella crepes. Since it was my first time trying crepes I wasn't sure if there suppose to be cold? I still want to come back and try the other foods on the menu. One day I will!  Food can be pricey but that's basically like any other restaurant/cafe out there. If you love a sweet breakfast, this place has a lot of options for you! The staff is friendly as well so that's a bonus!\n\nOnly negative things I have to say about this place is that the tables are very close to one another. Almost as if I was eating with the family next to me haha. And the tables were too small. If there was more room/space in general, that would be great."

Their variety of pancake selections. Red Velvet, Rocky Road, Nutella, and my personal fav Lemon Ricotta. There is a hotcake to please everyone. 2.

Cashier gets her manager and I see her laugh at the fact that we were complaining about the wait. And then she gives my family and I dirty looks. Definitely won't be coming back here again."

Amazing. Like 30 different kinds and flavors, and they're small so your group could get multiple flavors to try and share. Red Velvet, cookies and cream, classic chocolate chip, and S'more are some of my favorites. Additionally, some of the dishes are influenced by Filipino island flavors, like Rick's adobo fried rice \"omelette\" and the Kahlua pig Benedict--the bomb! Not a ton of seating, and it's a popular place so expect a little wait, but it's totally worth it. My favorite place to eat in Vegas."

This place is a good 10-15 minute drive away from the strip. We arrived around noon time on a Tuesday but were still in the mood for breakfast since we didn't eat anything beforehand.   The place was filled with people but thank goodness there were still a handful of tables available so we didn't have to wait.\n\nI did decide to yelp the place to check out the popular food items. The same two menu items kept coming up:  RED VELVET PANCAKES and the ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE. So what do we do?  of course we order:\n\n*RED VELEVET PANCAKES \n*ADOBO FRIED RICE\n\nWe decided to try both entrees and it was a big hit.  I've was a little apprehensive about ordering the red velvet pancakes because I have ordered them before at other places and they just don't really ever live up to the expectation of my favorite Red Velvet cupcake at Sprinkles but to be honest, it was pretty darn DELICIOUS.I loved how the pancake had a crisp taste on the outside but was also fluffy in the inside.\n\nI only had a few bites of the ADOBO FIRED RICE OMELETTE but from the couple of bites, it tasted YUMMY.\n\nService  was great too so  I will definitely be back."

So, off we went...\n\nAt first site of the red velvet pancakes, my sweet bud sensors went off. ALARM- this may be way to sweet to eat! I was afraid, I was petrified. The beautiful red pancakes covered in chocolate pieces and whip cream with a side of cream cheese icing look....sweet. I WAS SURPRISED! The pancakes were not overly sweet at all. They were sooooo tasty. The cakes were rich tasting, almost like a cake. The icing was smooth and creamy and perfectly accented the cakes. YUM!\n\nWe also had the Kahlua pig benedict as well. It was pretty good too. I found the Kahlua pig to be a big to oniony but my boyfriend loved it .\n\nOverall a great place to have breakfast / brunch.

The egg and the macaroni salad helped tame it, but I was still gulping down lots of water.\n\nThat didn't deter me from coming back to try their kalua pig benedict and splitting a stack of their signature red velvet pancakes with some friends. They have the basic eggs benedict on lock. English muffins were toasted well, eggs were poached perfectly, and the hollandaise sauce was creamy but not heavy. Love their Hawaiian twist on it with the moist kalua pork!

This place sort of reminds me of Eggs 'n Things and Koa Pancake House in Hawaii, but comparing BabyStacks to those places just isn't fair.\n\nBabyStacks is your typical breakfast/brunch joint with an island/filipino-inspired flare. Their menu items include the usual eggs, bacon, sausage, crepes, french toast, pancakes (large variety), etc. but if you're looking for something more (I'm talkin' to all ya'll Pacific Islander Yelpers) they also have spam, Portuguese sausage, loco moco (with the choice of garlic fried rice), Kalua pig (benedict), adobo fried rice (omelette), etc. \n\nThe restaurant is quite small and fills up rather quickly, but for our party of 7 (arriving after about an hour and a half of opening) only waited for about 15 minutes. Not too bad. I ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, and thanks to my family, I was able to try bites of the Kalua Pig Benedict and Nutella Crepes. The Adobo Fried Rice Omelette was delicious! The rice is fried with Filipino-style chicken adobo, wrapped inside a fried egg (hence, \"omelette\"), and garnished with scallions. The portion they serve is big enough for two people, so if you're not too hungry or want to try more things on the menu, I'd suggest sharing. The Kalua Pig Benedict was also very good. The pork was cooked and seasoned well. I wouldn't mind ordering it on my next visit. The Nutella crepe was just alright. I prefer my crepes to be thinner. The thickness of the crepe topped with cream made it a little soggy for my taste. If you do decide to order crepes I'd, again, suggest sharing it because they're huge! Talk about kanak-attack!!!\n\nThey also have daily specials that aren't menu regulars, so if you're looking for a unique breakfast experience check this place it out!"

I do think I will be the odd man out when I say that this place was just A-OK though.\n\nThe bf and I wandered in for a late brunch around 2pm, and we were seated right away. This place is super small, so I can see how there would be a wait during peak hours which is from 9a-12p Sat and Sun. They take to-go orders, but not during peak hours so be advised. They are open 7 days a week from 7a-2p on weekdays and 7a-3p on weekends. \n\nI ordered the loco moco with garlic fried rice (+$1) and for my side I upgraded to a small baby stack and got the red velvet pancakes. My boyfriend had the piglet omelette with seasoned potatoes and toast. The loco moco is a Hawaiian dish which has 2 burger patties topped with 2 eggs and brown gravy, all sitting on a bed of rice. I loved the garlic fried rice, it was soo tasty and went well with the rest of my food. The burger patties were underseasoned, but the gravy was really flavorful and definitely made the dish come together. I tried the pancakes the minute they arrived at my table. This should be a dessert they were soo sweet. They were good though, but I didn't think they lived up to the hype. They were topped with whipped cream and cream cheese syrup which came in a little cup on the side. I did really enjoy the cream cheese syrup and found myself scraping the little cup to get the last bit of it onto my cakes. \n\nMy boyfriend's omelette was 4 eggs stuffed with bacon, sausage, ham and cheddar. He also added jalapenos for a small charge. While it was plentiful, it was nothing memorable. It was $23 for both of us which I though was very reasonable. We only ordered waters though so drinks would have been a bit more. I plan to come back and try some other yummy pancake flavors, especially the lemon ricotta and the banana cream pie."

            "review": "What do I love about this place? The question should be, what don't I love about this place? \n\nWe had Rick's Adobo Fried Rice - a traditional Filipino dish made with marinated, shredded chicken and rice wrapped omelet style with green onions, accompanied with their homemade macaroni salad. The omelet is exactly what one would expect, if you ever had adobo...VERY, VERY GOOD! The mac salad was a little salty for my taste, but still very good!\n\nTheir Kalua Pig Benedict - toasted English muffin, topped with Hawaiian-style, slow-cooked, shredded pork, cabbage, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce...A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  If benedicts are what you're looking for, this one tops them all. My absolute favorite!\n\nOur son had their bacon cheeseburger, well done, and fries. My husband was quite pleased and surprised that, yet again, another great entree! \n\nOur daughter had their carrot cake pancakes. I love carrot cake to begin with, and I have to admit that it was even better than I thought!\n\nTo top everything off, we ordered their Red Velvet Pancakes with chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup. If pancakes are what you're looking for, anyone who's been here would, I'M SURE, highly recommend the Red Velvet. Words cannot even describe such a simple dish that is OH SO, well...you'll just have to try it!!!  \n\nDon't think that we could eat all this. I'm actually sick to my stomach from all the amazing food! We packed up two take-home containers and went home to crash, but I wanted to take a moment to rate this restaurant. Definitely worth it. This being our first time there, we wanted to order so much off their menu to try what we heard/read rave reviews about, so we already knew we were \"taking leftovers\"...the question was, just how much?\n\nBeing New Year's Eve, it was really packed! They served us juice and coffee as we waited, which was extremely nice! You're happy with how their items are priced! Service was still very good for how busy it was.  EVERYONE, including us, walked out of there with a smile on their face. \n\nWHAT A GREAT FIND! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for breakfast/brunch!!! ENJOY! :)"

I've had the bananas foster pancakes and the carrot cake ones and they are both fantastic. The bananas foster was really sweet. Surprised? Their bacon and eggs are also good. I can't recommend the coffee. It isn't terrible, but it tastes a lot like Folgers and it is my only real complaint about the place. I've had good service both times. Definitely recommend this place for a leisurely breakfast on a cheat day."

The place is hidden on the back side of a shopping center. Was not busy so we were seated immediately. Food was served about 10 minutes after ordering. Red velvet pancakes were moist and delicious. Sure to satisfy your sweet tooth. We also shared Rick's Adobo Rice & Egg. It was also delicious. Came with macaroni salad. All generous portions. We will return."

            "review": "I'll start off by saying I love BabyStacks. My boyfriend is a huge Cragged Egg fan (which I am not) so getting him to even try this was a struggle. The first time I finally convinced him to give it a try he ordered the chicken fried steak. It was okay, he of course preferred the one at cracked egg, and after tasting it, I agreed. After coming back a next time, he tried the mexican skillet. That's his new go-to. I'm giving only 3 stars because of the service. Coming in for sit down, theres never a problem. Lately we've only been in the mood for take out & its only a minute drive from Desert Shores. The past 2 times we've been, the take out service has been horrible.I don't think I'll be ordering from BabyStacks anymore due to our past 2 experiences. First time, we called in to order the mexican skillet to share. The hostess said it would be about 15-20 minutes. We got there about 20 mins later, thinking we would actually be late because although they say 15-20 mins, it usually never is. It took an additional 20 mins for our food to come out!!!!! 40 mins for takeout on one item? okay, I get it, they're busy.. but PLEASE give me an according time. It bugged me, but I understand it happens, so I let it go. A few weeks later we decided to order the same thing. We called in and its the same 15-20 mins. We got there in about 17 and were greeted by a new hostess. We told her we were here for pickup but she informed us the hostess was in the bathroom and she had not learned the system to cash us out yet (not her fault). So instead of waiting in front of the tiny cashier table because people were sitting on the bench to our left, we took a step back to give the people some room. Upon waiting 5 mins, a group of ladies walked up to the cashier to check out and stood in front of us. While the new hostess watched. My boyfriend wanted to say something but I told him to not to, reassuring him that the new hostess would tell the other hostess that we were there first. 5-6 mins later the hostess came out. I decided to try to inform her that we were there first(nicely) while she was walking towards us just incase the new girl forgot. I started out with \"Hi....\" and immediately got cut off with a \"I'll be right with you\" Being a hostess for 4 years and now a server, I thought that was extremely rude. So she proceeds to the cash register and starts checking out the ladies who stood in front of us, while the new girl watched and didn't say anything. Of course they wanted to spilt their bill. Another 4 minutes. After receiving our food, we took a bite in the car because I was starving, and to no surprise found our food to be extremely cold. The ladies cutting in front of us was not the hostess' fault, but to cut me off trying to tell her, is. I was so upset after this experience; it bugged me so bad I highly doubt I will be returning. Not for a good while at least."

She ordered the banana foster pancakes with eggs and potatoes. And for myself I got a BYO Omlette with potatoes and upgraded to the banana foster pancakes as well, also with a side of red velvet pancakes. These pancakes were so big and huge we were shocked how good they were. On top of that our server which I forgot his name was outstanding, He was by far a very good server and on top of his work. First visit I was like 5/5.\n\nSo how amazing it was the first time we decided to come again I even skipped my gym session just to make it since they do close early, and that's like a very big thing for me to do. So when we get there we get sat right away it was way less busier than the first time. Our server was kool she didn't go the extra miles but was there and took our order. My girl got the same thing as last time and me myself got BYO Omlette potatoes and white chocolate nut pancakes. When the food arrived the potatoes and omlette seemed the same. But the pancakes were like so tiny and boring. Both her banana foster and mine seemed like all they did was throw topping on the pancakes like nothing.so they were okay. As we get our check wr go and pay while paying and I was talking to the cashier some pig of a cook was hitting on my girlfriend in Spanish. Once we got out of the building she said did you see that and I was like what and she told me she felt violated that he was saying all these nasty things and she felt violated. He was lucky I wasn't paying attention to notice cause then there would have been a problem. On top of that she is not one of those girls that dresses all out either she was just in pants and a plain tback shirt with no makeup of anything. So it wasn't like she was calling for attention like some girls do. That visit was a 1/5\n\nWe want to go back so bad but at the same time we are iffy about it. the second time we visited was just bad. We are also talking about making a trip across town to another location. Just because how great the first time it was\n\nAlso one more thing I love fresh OJ wish they had it of something better than consentrate."

For a restaurant that opened a month ago, they were bustling with activity.  The hostess told us there is a 35 minute wait.  Even though my partner gave me a look that meant \"should we?,\" I ignored the tone that came out from his voice and told the lady we would wait.  While we waited, we perused the menu in and out because they had so many choices.  I was having a hard time keeping to my pescatarian leanings when I saw the Rick's Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelet.  I finally gave in and ordered the adobo and a short stack of red velvet pancakes.  The partner ordered the Breakfast Burrito (without the meat, so proud of him).  I was so happy when the pancakes came.  It had whipped cream, chocolate chips, and cream cheese syrup.  The pancakes were awesome.  Even my partner enjoyed it and I am the one with the red velvet cravings.  When the adobo omelet came, I was in heaven!  The egg that wrapped the adobo rice(yes you read right) was fluffy and had green onions in it.  Plus, the fried rice had TONS of chicken adobo.  I didn't regret the meat eating after the first bite.   It also came with macaroni salad on the side.  Like everything else, it was yummy.  My partner ate his Breakfast Burrito and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The owner also asked how the food was and when she walked away, my partner  said she looked like an Asian Jessica Alba.  The place was a nice place with cozy decor.  I would totally recommend this place to anyone.  We are definitely coming back there when my sister visits.  She saw the picture of the Red Velvet Pancakes and told us to take her there next time."

There are so many options and we have yet to go through the entire selection.

I didn't enjoy the flavor of it at all and it didn't taste like the Portuguese Sausage I was accustomed to eating when I'm in Hawaii.  Bummer.\n\nMom couldn't finish her Jalapeno Burger, so she gave me a few bites.  I thought it was OK, nothing special.  Certainly not worth $8.75.\n\nOur server was friendly and on top of things.

The sandwich was tasty but I had kind of lost my appetite.  I gave half to my son and ate the other half.  \n\nNow here is what disappointed me.  I would have thought that the server would've offered to pay for my soda...offer a little dessert...something.   By all accounts, this was not a good dining experience.  Nothing.  \n\nI suppose I could've been a jerk.  Maybe that would've been more effective?"

However, it was very mediocre and I found myself saying what they could have done to everything to make it just a bit better. One star for using real blueberries in their pancakes, and one star for the service. Our waitress was so nice with us even when they lost our order, it didn't even seem like a big deal to us when she told us because she was so apologetic. The only good thing I did eat was the pumpkin pancakes. The whipped cream on top was actually one of the best things I ate here. \n\nTheir \"cream cheese\" syrup was meh. They should use more cream cheese in that syrup to keep the tang of the cheese. One fork dip for the testing and that was all I needed. They should also think about using real maple syrup...... Just sayin'. The hashbrowns were so generously pulled out of the freezer, browned a bit on each side with some thick grease, and put on a plate. Real tasty and this is me being real sarcastic. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."

Although the wait was a bit long, we are used to waits from other happening spots like The Bagel Cafe, Hash House-a-Go-Go and The Omelet House. So, 20 minutes wasn't too bad, if I was starving, yes, it would not have been good. \n\nThe cafe is little, and there were a couple large parties that definitely slowed things down a bit. I'm not sure if there is a best time to come but it was worth the wait.\n\nWe had the red velvet pancakes (to die for), the honey french toast (deliciously large and savory) and the s'mores pancakes (divine!) \n\nWe also shared an omelet with cheese, bacon and sausage and potates. \n\nThe former Becker restaurant is closed - maybe they can take that place over so there's more seats and less of a wait - just a thought :) \n\nOverall, we were very happy and full! We would definitely come back again. The cafe is quaint and you feel like you are at a local's spot, which is always very nice. This is definitely a once a month treat because I can only imagine how many calories are associated with food that tastes so heavenly! \n\nYay Babycakes!"

            "review": "Leaving Las Vegas en route for Los Angeles we'd originally considered traveling pastries from Bouchon versus our leftovers from Robuchon as breakfast - at least until I heard about Babycakes Caf\u00e9.  Highly regarded on Yelp! and reported to be committed to local high quality ingredients the small shop was a brief detour and, honestly, how often do I have a car at my disposal in Las Vegas?  Opening at 7am we woke early, loaded the car, and arrived at the restaurant at 7:05 - so early the coffee hadn't even finished brewing.\n\nEntering the restaurant we were greeted sleepily by a young Hispanic woman at the front and seated by a young Hispanic man who would also act as our server throughout the meal.  With water poured menus were delivered and once coffee and tea were optioned for we were told it would be a few moments as water was still boiling and coffee still brewing.  Low on d\u00e9cor we sat back and watched highlights of DeSean Jackson lighting up the Giants on the plasma screen until the young man returned with beverages and took our orders.\n\nWith quality service throughout the meal - coffee refilled frequently and water never empty - we watched the restaurant slowly fill to half capacity while we waited...and from my vantage point I watched the kitchen, a two man operation running the griddles and grills with great speed and skill.  With the time just shy of 7:30 our plates would arrive - each warm, well prepared, and accompanied with appropriate toppings in small plastic cups.\n\nThe first plate, ordered by my sister, was the short stack of Peanut Butter and \"make your own combination!\" pancakes - in her case banana and chocolate.  Served with maple syrup the pancakes were decent but not spectacular - a mild peanut butter taste within and chopped bananas and chocolate chips atop.\n\nMy aunt's selection, a short stack of Red Velvet pancakes topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles and served with cream cheese syrup would fare better than my sister's choice, albeit largely only because of the syrup.  Cocoa tinged, thin, and somewhat crisp on the exterior the pancakes themselves were tasty while the addition of the chocolate crumbles lent some textural variation and the whipped cream was expectedly sweet.  In the cup, imagine a mildly citrus cream cheese frosting thinned out - a great idea that worked nicely on both this dish and my selection.  As we'd be dining on Red Velvet pancakes for the next two days I feel obligated to note that these were the worst of the group by a large margin.\n\nFor my choice, Carrot Cakes - certainly the most interesting of our pancake selections with shredded carrots and pecans studding the batter.  Topped with more crumbled pecans and the same lovely syrup served with the red velvet options I actually enjoyed my short stack quite a bit and was glad I'd opted for less food so I could sample some of my mother's choice - the best of the meal.\n\nTitled Honey Toast and described as \"two pieces of thick sliced honey toast dipped in a farm fresh egg wash and cooked to perfection! Then drizzled with sweet honey. Yummy!\" I will have to agree with Babycake's assessment - they were prefect and yummy.  Significant in size and heft the two thick slices of toast were perfectly caramelized on the exterior and custard within while the slowly melting whipped cream and honey proved to be a smooth and sweet balance without being overly saccharine.  While superfluous, I will note the house syrup was actually quite good - it reminded me of the Sweet Syrup at Camellia Grill in New Orleans.\n\nSettling the modest bill - a mere $7.50/each with tax and tip - at the front before making our way to the car we were bid farewell and told to come back soon.  While I'll admit that in retrospect I rather wish we'd have simply gotten some pastries for the road, I certainly did not dislike Babycakes - it just wasn't worth the special trip.  While the small caf\u00e9 would be well suited for a city like Columbus or Toledo, given the quality of the competition in Las Vegas it just doesn't stack up, even if the price is a steal compared to options on the strip - I'd much sooner venture to Hash House a Go Go (on strip or off.)"

I showed up with my family and was told 30-35 minutes was the wait to be seated.  The place was packed and decided to take a chance on the wait.  It was in a shopping center and we weren't going to wait outside with 3 kids.  I took the kids to go sit in the car while my wife went an picked up an item at a nearby story in the center.  After 15 minutes, I asked my daughter to go check and see how the wait was going.  She came running back saying that they had called us several times and we needed to go or we would lose our spot.  I grabbed the kids an ran into the restaurant; however, the hostess asked if we were all together and I told her No, but my wife will be here in a moment.  The hostess said, \"I can't seat you unless you are all together.\"  I replied with, \"You are going to seat us and if I need order for my wife, I can since I know what she likes.\"  The hostess told me, No again. I told her that we would not be in this predicament if she would have been more accurate on her time.  So, she sat us down.  Some may be excited that to see that they wait wasn't as long as suggested, but when you're juggling 5 people.  That task is not as easy as one might seem.  Luckily the food was okay.  But due to the service at the beginning, I have no intention of returning.  I wish I recalled her name, but it was an older woman with a grumpy attitude and who likes to yell.  A hostess is a critical component of a dining experience.  They are the first person the customer sees and the last one too.  Centennial doesn't have many good breakfast options, but I don't mind traveling 10 miles to get the experience I expect."

It's not like I eat pancakes for dinner...regularly. And I totally don't own pancake batter in a spray-can form. And I DEFINITELY have never argued with a McDonald's clerk because they wouldn't serve me a Hotcakes 'n Sausage platter a measly five minutes after breakfast ended. Never.\n\nOkay, you got me. I may be fibbing a little. The truth is that I have a hard time saying no to pancakes. I could be wish-I-wore-my-stretchy-pants full, and if a warm stack of fluffy flapjacks somehow landed on my table - well, let's just say I wouldn't let it go to waste.\n\nAnd so you can imagine what a pancake caf\u00e9 would be like for me. Tummy temptation at its finest! Babystacks boasts the most ridiculously extensive selection of pancakes I have ever had the pleasure of choosing from. Red Velvet...Cinnabun...White Chocolate Macadamia Nut...Rocky Road - their pancake list reads more like a dessert menu! For those who seek savory over sweet? BACON pancakes! And even a Honey Whole Wheat option for the carb-conscious. \n\nThe best part? Each is available as a short stack of three pancakes. Translation? You can order like THREE different kinds without busting your pancake bank!\n\nI played it cool and ordered just two flavors - the PB & Banana and the Red Velvet.  The PB & Banana was definitely the frontrunner of the two, with banana as the perfect complement to the unmistakably peanut-buttery batter. Simple, yet such a mouth-pleaser! The Red Velvet did quite well in its pancake debut, served with a delightful 'cream cheese syrup.' Though I would have done without the chocolate crumble topping -- it was an unnecessary distraction from the decadent-on-its-own batter. \n\nBottom Line:  The perfect place for feeding your flapjack fetish! Short-stacks are your best bet for maximum pancake sampling. Beware the long wait for a table -- especially on weekends."

We were excited to try the red velvet pancakes! We ordered a full stack to share and bring extras home. We had other things too, but the pancakes was what we craved!\nSOOOOO YUUUUUM! My daughter couldn't stop eating them! I couldn't either, I must confess!\nWe'll be back....maybe even try something else on the menu!"

The food is normal breakfast fair.  I did try the buttermilk pancakes and they were o.k.  But like I stated before I am not a pancake person, so maybe this isn't the place for me.

Yes.... BACON pancakes.\n\nThe corned beef hash was delicious. Scrambled eggs, good. Seasons potatoes weren't really noticeably \"seasoned,\" but it wasn't bad either. The bacon pancakes are a creative invention, but when it comes down to it, it tastes as if you took a bite of pancake and just so happened to shove some bacon into your mouth a couple seconds later (Don't judge. That's probably a normal thing for people who eat fast). The pancake with or without the bacon though, is really good.\n\nKalila got scrambled eggs, 4 sausage links, hashbrowns and RED VELVET PANCAKES! She doesn't even like pancakes, but there was no way we were going to baby stacks without getting the RVpancakes. She got them and loved them. They were really good! Kalila was nervous about the \"cream cheese syrup,\" but she loved that too! It tasted like the frosting that comes with toaster strudel. Scrambled eggs, just as good as mine. Sausage links, bomb dipped in maple syrup. Hashbrowns were tasty! \n\nEverything was really good! While walking back to the car, we talked about how much fun we actually had eating that meal. It was worth the road trip it took to get there."

I thought I'd give it another chance with the boyfriend this time because he loves breakfast food. As soon as we walked in I regretted it. It was dirty and kind of embarrassing because I had chosen where we were to eat. We got seated by the door and were FORGOTTEN about. No one came by, looked at us, acknowledged us, or gotten us water. They must have clearly seen us sitting there. We were so irritated, but didn't want to drive elsewhere. I walked up to the front counter and explained that we have been waiting 15 minutes and no one has helped us. No one felt bad at all. We finally got a waitress who rushed us and made us feel like a burden. Needless to say it ruined my meal, and frankly my morning. I've never had worse service. Fast food has been better!

It was appalling that when I asked a male waiter why she let them cut in front of everyone, both him and Felicia (Phylicia) **LAUGHED** and did not take the customers' concern seriously.\n\nI was polite when I asked about the situation, but their attitude back towards me was rather rude.  Finally (after much debate), she told her friends they had to leave (since they clearly were skipping the line ahead of all those people waiting and they didn't even have a reservation).  However, she continued to give mean looks to myself and other customers who complained to her about this unfair situation, while we were finally seated and eating our meal.  Very poor service.\n\nSo again.... do yourself a favor... if Felicia (Phyllicia) is still working there, then ask for another waitress.

However, the service and the food were lackluster at best.\n\nBeing seated on a Wednesday afternoon, my brother and I were fully expecting to evade the normal rush. However, this didn't stop service from being inattentive and practically non-existent. Sitting for a few minutes without being acknowledged at our table, another waitress noticed our unsettled behavior, and quickly made amends with service. Normally, I'd understand a wait, but Babycakes has about 15 tables throughout the restaurant. Small is an understatement, and in this, I didn't understand the neglectful service we received. I felt more attended to by our neighboring table's child than by the wait staff. \n\nMy brother and I shared the Lemon Ricotta pancakes and the adobo fried rice. The adobo fried rice was nothing special - other than surprising me in being wrapped in an omelet. The Lemon Ricotta pancakes were the biggest disappointment. I fully expected lemony, fluffy crepes; however, what was placed on my table were dry, bland crepes. Nowhere could I identify an ounce of ricotta, and the only lemon throughout was squeezed on myself. \n\nThe price is decent for the portions we got, but the taste isn't justified for that price. Overall, for such an adorable concept, I was disappointed by the lack of service and lack of flavor."

Our total came up to be about 23.00. The place is small and cramp but clean and so are the bathrooms. We came in at 0800 on a Friday and was seated immediately. Servers were friendly, checked on us often and our food came out quick and hot. \nThe food.... Rob says his Portuguese sausage eggs and rice was throwback to what we were used to eating in Guam and his orange juice tasted like the canned ones  we were served in school. \nMine was the loco moco, they used a darker gravy than what I'm used too but I did like it a lot. I'm glad they don't use cheap rice here which takes away from the dish like the other island restaurants here do. I don't know which they use but it was not heavy and thick. I got through two of the patties and was stuffed,only got to eat a quarter of my pancakes which is a shame since they were soooo good."

I was going to order the chicken fried steak, but the server said it's frozen and then fried.  I asked about the corned beef hash being made scratch, but it's out of a can.  I asked if they make their biscuits from scratch and the server said \"I think so.\".  I was alarmed.  I went with the Kaluha pork eggs benedict with the seasoned potatoes.  Very disappointing. The potatoes are just deep fried potato cubes.  No bellpepper and onions.  The pork was smokey and just okay.  My sister had the loco moco. The gravy was bland.  The hamburger patties had a good flavor.  We also had a short stack of buttermilk cakes.  They were okay.  Nothing I would write home about.  140+ Yelpers averagin 4.5 stars really had me puzzled.  The food isn't made from scratch.  Frozen and canned just don't get me in that 4.5 star mood.  Spam is the only canned item I would accept only because you know it's canned.  Corned Beef Hash doesn't mean it's canned unless they say Hormel Corned Beef Hash."

They come out hot, moist and delightfully soft. Soft enough you do not need a knife to cut them, as all good pancakes shouldn't. Aside from the texture, the innovative spins they have in their recipes (Cinnabun, orange creamsicle, PB and ?) tie them together in an extremely palatable and delicious experience. Boyfriend had rocky road, I enjoyed the hazelnut myself. Both were delish!\n\nAs it was pushing into lunch time we also ordered a kalua grilled cheese and an eggs benedict. The grilled cheese deserved a 4/5 in terms of tastefulness and innovation. The benedict I found a little bland in flavor and too reminiscent of many other breakfast joints in town. \n\nService was an A+. Seated at approximately the given wait time, staff was very friendly and attentive.\n\nAltogether a thumbs up!"

Both places were good, but Babystacks was outstanding, with original offerings. The Adobo Fried Rice Omelette was huge, and perfectly seasoned -- really delicious and different. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\nThe Almond Joy and Butterfinger pancakes were heavenly. Surprisingly, not too sweet. Red Velvet were also predictably good based on reviews. \n\nService was fantastic. Worth the wait, no question. Excellent value.

I've been wanting to try BabyStacks ever since I discovered that they serve Adobo Fried Rice omelette. \n\nWe headed over to BabyStacks as soon as we arrived from our long journey from LA.  The place a bit small and there was already a wait at 8:30AM on a Saturday morning.   The 10 minute wait wasn't too bad considering some of the lengthy waiting I've had done in the past.  \n\nWhile I waited, I noticed the sign with the pancake specials: Almond Joy pancakes or Butterfinger pancakes.  Ooh!  That sounded yummy.  I also noticed that a lot of the people were ordering Red Velvet pancakes.  It was going to be hard for me to decide what to order.  \n\nWhen we got to our table, I quickly scanned the menu for the Adobo Fried Rice omelet and I got nervous when I couldn't find it under omelettes.  Then, low and behold, I saw Rick's Adobo Fried Rice. The description said it was chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an egg.  Bingo!  That was it.  I ordered that as well as the Almond Joy pancakes.  \n\nI got my pancakes and was pleasantly surprised at what I saw.  I thought it was going to be a regular pancake with bits of Almond Joy candy pieces scattered though the batter.  Instead, it was a chocolate pancake with coconut flakes and sliced almonds sprinkled on top of the whipped cream with chocolate drizzle.  It tasted like a friggin cupcake, it was sooo good.  \n\nThe Adobo Fried Rice was also spectacular.  It was such a clever idea.  Why didn't I think of making that?  I made a mental note to try making my own version one of these days.  The only thing that fell flat was the macaroni salad that was served with it, it was very bland.  I doused it with Sriracha sauce, which helped.  \n\nThis is an awesome breakfast spot. Prices are very reasonable and it is great for families. I wished they had a location back in LA.  At least it will be one of my breakfast spots whenever I am in Vegas."

We actually got seated faster than they said it would take. I personally don't care if there is a long wait. A long wait means there are tons of people that want to eat there and I understand why. If you complain about a wait at a restaurant you are the same kind of person who thinks traffic is a personal attack on you. Wow I'm preachy.\n\nThe food is excellent. Everything we ordered was great. I can tell they care about making good quality food with real ingredients. There is no comparison between a place like this and some chain restaurant. \n\nLets talk about the food! I ordered the breakfast burrito and the carrot cake pancakes. Holy hot damn were those pancakes good. The breakfast burrito was also great, I ordered it with the sausage (I think its Peruvian sausage or something, I can't remember). My gf ordered the Two eggs and bacon with the red velvet pancakes. It really is like having cake for breakfast. They are amazing, I get why they red velvet pancakes are so popular.\n\nThat's it!

Going anywhere outside the strip just seems sketchy, right?\nWe wanted to meet up a couple of friends, who are both locals, for brunch. We suggested going to the buffet at The Cosmopolitan and they both gave us these hesitant, unsure faces. They suggested going to this local mom and pops place instead, which is off the strip. Then it was my turn to give the hesitant, unsure look. But when they mentioned \"Adobo fried rice\" and \"red velvet pancakes\", I was convinced.\n\nBaby Stacks is a small restaurant located in a shopping strip. I was told it was originally named \"Baby Cakes\", but people kept thinking it was a bakery so they had to change the name.  The place definitely looks like an unpretentiously casual, local diner. Nothing fancy, no frills. Scanning the menu, the theme of the restaurant seemed to be Hawaiian with items like \"Loco moco\" and \"Kalua pork egg benedict\".\n\nOur server, Lori (or Laurie, Lawry, Lorie, Loree...), who was a very agreeable lady came to take our orders. I decided on getting the \"Loco Moco with garlic fried rice\", my bf got the \"Adobo fried rice\" and we both got half a stack of the Red Velvet cupcakes.\n\nI loved EVERYTHING! I was surprised with how I shamelessly devoured everything, considering that I have a very little stomach for food. Maybe, it's my genetic predisposition to love white rice.\n\nThe Loco Moco has 2 solid beef patties atop rice. (It originally comes with steamed rice but I strongly suggest you get the garlic fried rice instead.) 2 eggs go on top of everything while smothered by some tasty gravy! Ultimate comfort food!!!\nThe adobo fried rice is genius idea! You get fried rice mixed with chicken adobo pieces (you can also do garlic fried rice) wrapped in beaten egg. Exactly, it is an adobo fried rice omelet.\nThe Red Velvet pancakes were the perfect way to finish our meal! You think you wouldn't have room for it? Think again! The half stack comes with 3 pancakes while the full stack comes with 6. The pancakes are sprinkled with mini chocolate chips with a side of sweet cream cheese sauce. \nI am soooo glad I was convinced to get off the strip. You can almost never go wrong with mom and pops restaurants. *BURRRP!*"

The hoopla has been mainly about their red velvet pancakes, and since red velvet is my most favorite dessert, how could I pass up an opportunity to try it in breakfast form? \n\nFrom my understanding, the line to get in to this joint is typically outrageous, but little secret..on a Tuesday morning around 11AM, you'll have virtually no problem finding a seat in this strip mall hidden treasure. \n\nThe restaurant itself is small which would explain the (typical) wait time to get a table. I have reduced my rating by a star due to this fact because the seating is awkward, the restaurant can be noisy and most seats in the house will have you facing the kitchen or hallway to the restroom. \n\nMoving right along.. The other half ordered some garlic infused omelet (I'm Italian, but garlic in the AM is just too much for me) complete with potatoes and a side of red velvet pancakes and I ordered their cinnamon bun pancakes and a side of scrambled eggs. \n\nMuch to my surprise I quite enjoyed my cinnamon pancakes even better than the red velvet! But hey, if you forced me to eat either one, I wouldn't complain. \n\nAll in all, food was delicious, service was great and should I ever be in the area again and there's not a line, I would happily indulge once again in the Babycakes extensive, festively flavored pancake menu."

Adobo Fried Rice and Red Velvet pancakes are my go-to, can never go wrong with these two dishes. \n\nAdobo Fried Rice-- the egg wrapping the fried rice like a burrito is cooked perfectly, texture-wise. It isn't salty, lacks a little bit of salt in my option, BUT the fried rice itself is so rich you won't need the extra salt. The fried rice is flavorful AND moist, which is a lot of Asian fried rice lack almost always. The potatoes I ordered was seasoned well --  had a little kick. I believe it had cayenne or paprika. \n\nRed Velvet pancakes-- I ordered the short stack which was plenty for me. It came with seemingly homemade whipped cream. It was light and tasted very good. It also came with cream cheese syrup -- it was quite thick and sweet, so instead of pouring it all over my pancakes, I just dipped in it every bite I took. The dish was garnished with some chocolate powder and some chunks.\n\nBanana cream pie pancakes-- I didn't have these my last visit but I remember it being creamy and tasted amazing! And I'm not really a big fan of bananas. \n\nBreakfast burrito-- my girlfriend had this dish. She was very satisfied with it and said it was filling.

After awhile I finally did and am happy to say the service was much better and the food was super yummy.  We have been back a few times and I always get their egg breakfast and upgrade to whatever pancakes are on special.  I've really enjoyed the bananas foster and appreciate their serving sizes.  Great for sharing with a toddler who doesn't eat that much.  I can tell this is a businesses that really does care about their customers.  To bad they were not in a bigger location as the wait times can be bad especially when you have kids in tow. Which is always for my family."

Ok let's just start with the food. \n\nRV pancakes it's alright nothing to rave about. The only thing that is good was the sauce for it and it was moist. White Mac pancakes nothing different just add mac nuts in a regular pancakes and top it off with white chocolate chips. oooooh so exciting. I ordered the the Rick's adobo fried rice and my niece ordered the loco moco. Man can I say \"someone REALLY loves pepper. Even the mac salad was way to peppery. It seem like someone was mad at the pepper that day. The Loco moco was ehhh good. My nephew ordered the piglet which was actually good. But I can't say about the home fries I did not taste it cause I'm not a fan of any type of home fries except for hash browns. \n\nThe service was friendly and I think she was the manager she was awesome. She came a few times to check on us. And so did the waitress. That's always a plus. Water was filled and with a smile. \n\nThe place is cute and the decor was pretty cool. They even have a section for the kids coloring section. plus plus for that. \n\nThe parking is a private lot which there is plenty. I would love to come back but it's far from where I live so it might be awhile. \n\nBut be prepared to wait for awhile there was a wait of 15 mins when we got there at 1230 (lunch time)"

I love that they have tons of pancakes to choose from.  My choice is always the red velvet, it's like having dessert for breakfast, need I say more?  I don't have to use the cream cheese syrup as it is good by itself.  My mom and I always share a spam scramble plate (scrambled eggs, spam, rice, and furikake) which appeals to my Filipino side and the red velvet pancake.  My husband always try different types of banana pancakes, he got the banana cream pie this past 4th of July.  Our children loves the s'mores one.  Our youngest who has a hard time finishing his food actually ate spam scramble and his own stack of pancake and finished it all!  They also had adobo chicken fried rice which is very good but can be too much if you have to finish it yourself, so share!  We can't wait to visit our parents again and have delicious breakfast at Baby Stacks!\n\nBtw, the wait is super long...but definitely worth it.  Service is good and fast."

I noticed several benches outside and I can only assume that is because sometimes the line is out the door from people waiting to get into this place. Lucky us though we got in before a rush came through and nabbed a spot without wait. The inside is clean and the employees are very friendly. Seating seems limited for the amount of people wanting inside. I saw the occupancy sign said it could seat just 50! If BabyStacks keeps putting out such a good breakfast they might have to move to a bigger location. \n\nThe coffee here is awesome! It is full of good flavor. This is one of those cups of coffee I just really enjoyed sipping on and could have stayed all day just for that! I figured my first visit wouldn't be complete if I didn't order pancakes. With all of the options BabyStacks offers for pancakes how does anybody ever decide?! I chose the \"Banana Cream Pie\" pancakes. OMG! These pancakes are the b-e-s-t I have ever had!! The pancakes are so darn thick and fluffy and have such good flavor. There was banana in the pancake batter as well sliced fresh all over the pancakes. It also had banana cream sauce, almonds and pie crust on it.  I only ordered a *short* stack and couldn't finish my meal. The short stack cost just $5.75. What a great price! Others in my party grubbed on \"Carot Cakes\" and \"PB & Bananas W/Chocolate Chips\" and of course I had to try a bite of both of those. I would order everything at our table over and over again it was just all so good. I will be back for sure!\n\nOur server was excellent. I asked him what his favorite thing on the menu was and he suggested \"Portuguese Sausage And Eggs\". He said they have a \"Garlic Rice\" that pairs very well with this dish. He had me at garlic rice! I need to try this rice for sure at some point. \n\nThey have a great kids menu at affordable prices."

If you don't mind rubbing elbows with hungry Las Vegans and don't get claustrophobic easily, Babycakes is worth a shot.\n\nThe menu is plentiful, most notably, Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, Kalua Pig Benedict and the Red Velvet pancakes which come with a cream cheese frosting.

The place is clean and bright and was pretty quiet for a weekday morning. \nI ordered the Adobo Fried Rice. Disappointing. The rice has hard and had a few charred pieces of chicken lending it a strange burned off -flavor. The egg \"wrap\" was thin and oily. I can usually finish a whole plate but it was so unappetizing I only had a third. The adobo fried rice rules at Thelmas... check em out. My husband had the Loco Moco and it was alright. It was the standard Hamburger patty and brown sauce found in many valley local places, nothing special. The kids had the children's breakfast - eggs & pancakes. Also nothing special. Our big mistake was getting only a side of Red Velvet Pancakes to \"try em out\". They were heavenly! I almost like em better than Nothing Bundt Cakes Red Velvet Bundt. They came out hot soft and fluffy, with a light puff of whipped cream and choco shaving. There was a side of cream cheese topping which was heavenly drizzled on top. Just lovely. It was funny watching a grown man wrestle over pancakes with a determined and hungry five year old. Priceless. Save yourself some disappointment and go there for the Red Velvet Pancakes... you won't be sorry! \nStaff was very friendly and attentive.  The tables were very small though and crammed together so if you want some breathing room I recommend you come on a weekday cause the weekends are packed!"

The owners of Babycakes are some mighty nice PILIPINO (I say it like my nanay) people!  Have you eaten yet?\n\nBabycakes is packed in the morning especially on weekends because they are only open for breakfast and lunch up until around 2 PM!  So if you can get over your \"What happens in Vegas...stays in Vegas\" hangover get here early!  If you get to Babycakes at prime dining time be prepared for a bit of a wait.  But it's ok because it's worth it.\n\nWe meandered here on a Furlough Friday for us and intended not to spend any money of this day of no pay.  Boy was that a mistake!  We 'accidentally' pulled into the parking lot just to see what the crowd was like.  Once that smell of pancakes and grilled goodies hit me I couldn't help it.  We got out of the car and walked in.  Thankfully, no wait!\n\nI just couldn't keep myself from looking around the dining area and checking to see if I was related to anyone in the place!  So bad...I know!  So many Asian people around me...like I was at a Wow-Wow-Wee taping!  Or a Journey concert with Alan Pineda as the lead singer!  Alas, there was no relatives of mine within the vicinity.\n\nOn to checking out the Babycakes Cafe menu.  Lots of familiar breakfast choices.  Babycake pancakes, favorites, omelettes, benedicts, crepes, all kinds of good stuff!  We ended up ordering the Baby Chick omelette with chicken, mushrooms, spinach, garlic, and cheddar cheese ($9.50), the Two-Egg Breakfast with two eggs, and hashbrowns ($6.25), and a short stack of their famous Red Velvet babycakes ($5.75).  Both of our orders each also came with two buttermilk babycakes included!  Not too shabby!  \n\nThe food?  Delicious!  The omelette was fluffy and had a good amount of fillings, the eggs were cooked great (sunny side up..yum) and my hashbrowns were the way I like em'...super crunchy!  The babycakes were excellent as well, buttery and light.  But damn...those Red Velvet babycakes?  They were pretty bomb!  Topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips?  It was like having dessert for breakfast!  So savory!  Didn't even need the cream cheese syrup.  I will be sure to order a FULL stack of these next time!  And probably not share, ha ha!\n\nBabycakes Cafe also has some stuff on the menu that is definitely Asian/Filipino/Hawaiian inspired.  These guys serve Spam!  Oh yeah!  The king of meats in Hawaii!  Definitely feelin' like I'm home.  Babycakes also has a Kalua Pig Benedict which definitely rings in the islands.  Don't forget Loco Moco!  It's made there too.  They serve Asian inspired Honey Toast!  Japan would be proud!  One of Babycakes biggest specialty sellers is Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.  I wish I had ordered it because it looked so yummy!  Steaming hot with a side of macaroni salad included, all I needed was to top it off with ketchup, shoyu, and Tabasco.  Breakfast nirvana I say!\n\nWe'll be going here again soon.  Food was good, service was good, atmosphere is good.  I heard on the grapevine that the members of Jabbawockeez and Super Cr3w frequent Babycakes Cafe quite a bit and they love it!  I didn't see any of them in there the time we visited...but then again, how would I know what the Jabbawockeez guys look like without their white masks on?\n\nGo here for a good breakfast!  It's the most important meal of the day!  If I remember correctly, the lady owner of Babycakes Cafe was super duper, mighty fine lookin', very pretty lady!  Friendly too.  Another reason to visit sooner!"

After reading so many reviews from ecstatic foodies about how fantastic this restaurant was, I braved the over 18 miles drive to Babycakes to get some of their \"famous\" fare.  On a Saturday morning, we waited 50 minutes to be seated.  Hostess Lindy needed some serious lessons in customer service.  She called my name and motioned for me to follow her. She slapped the menu on the table and left without a word. Granting that it was a busy morning, a little courtesy would be much appreciated.  I guess, she was doing us a favor by giving us a seat in this unbelievably busy morning.  Waiter Preston was attentive and cheerful.  He was patient in answering my questions about the dishes and the restaurant operations in general. \n\nNow on to the food recap.  I had the Portuguese sausage and two over easy eggs, paired with two small red velvet pancakes.  Nothing special with the sausage and eggs, no garnishing at all.  Eggworks' version of this dish was more acceptable. Anyway, really, how could you mess up commercially bought sausage and fried eggs?  The RVP - what's so special about red colored pancakes?  They were fluffy like the way pancakes should be.  The special sauce was simple condensed milk. If anything was added, it was beyond detection.  Verdict:  Entr\u00e9e was acceptable but nothing exceptional.\n\nHubby had the in\"famous\" adobe rice.  Since we were told the Filipino owner developed all the recipes, I was hopeful I would be enjoying some nasty good adobo rice.  Since I read the reviews I knew that it would be served wrapped in scrambled egg like an omelet.  Japanese often serve omelets in this fashion so I did not find it strange.  After the first bite, it was clear I was headed for disastrous disappointment. The adobe, which I assumed was pork, was shredded and did not taste anything like Filipino adobo. It looked and tasted like reincarnated kalua pig mixed with soy sauce and nothing else.  What a shame to call this dish \"adobe rice\".  It was clearly a misnomer. Verdict:  Entr\u00e9e was crap and an utter waste of money.\n\nConclusion:  There was so much hype about this restaurant.  It was not worth the drive and definitely not worth a second trip."

We both agreed that this is a great place for breakfast! The pancakes were honestly some of the tastiest pancakes I've ever had. I ordered the hazelnut short stack with strawberries...wow! They drizzle Nutella with whipped cream and chopped hazelnuts on top! Plus the fresh strawberries made it even better! Every single bite was delicious..I actually finished the short stack! I don't think I could ever order a full order though! A short stack is perfect! I ended up ordering two different sides of potatoes, the hash browns and the breakfast potatoes. Both were good but I will probably stick to the breakfast potatoes next time! I spent about $14 for a short stack with strawberries and two breakfast sides and was not upset about it.

The fresh strawberries sent it over the edge.  So good!\n\nWe shared:\n- Short Stack of Red Velvet Pancakes: topped w/ whipped cream & chocolate crumbles, served with cream cheese syrup.\n\nThese were very good.

You are eating cake for breakfast- and no one is judging!\n\nMy husband asked me to bring him home the Tuna Sandwich on Wheat.  The tuna was good, but not \"like mom makes\" if that makes sense.  We didn't touch the fries because they were cold by the time I got home.  \n\nI want to go back to get the Adobo Fried Rice and the Cinnamon Bun or the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes.

My initial thought was insanity and my second was whether or not anyone in town other than some compulsive gamblers needing a hangover meal would actually be there.  But then I heard three words that I didn't think was possible to string together in one phrase: Red...Velvet...pan-Cakes.   Having grown up in the south, folks take their red velvet cake pretty seriously, so I had to at least make the trip for a taste.\n\nWhen I arrived, not only was my friend there 10 minutes early, but the entire place was already packed, so I knew I was walking into some serious eats.  As multiple orders of the infamous pancakes were ordered at our table, I began to think of that sketch where Bill Cosby talks about feeding his children chocolate cake for breakfast only to incur the wrath of his wife.   Perhaps these pancakes would have salvaged Bill from the doghouse.  If you ignore the sinfully red color of the pancakes, the chocolate chips are disguised as blueberries, the whipped cream as butter, and the sneakiest of all is the cream cheese syrup as the maple syrup....pure genius.  Assemble the components together and you get the perfect bite of warm red velvet cake with some additional bonus textures of the slightest crunch and chew from the edge of the pancake and the chocolate chips respectively.   \n\nThis dish offers irrefutable proof one CAN have their cake and eat it too."

Waited about 50 minutes! Can't really complain about the wait since it was a breakfast place and I did come on a weekend. The ladies that serve us was very friendly! I ordered the piglet skillet and upgraded my pancakes to the red velvet pancakes and let me tell you nothing was left on that plate!! It was sooo good!!! The steak and eggs was absolutely delish! The best part about eating with the family that I was able to taste also the banana cream pie pancakes and adobo burrito! Everything I tastes was really good! I see why there was a line! I have to say that those Hispanic line cooks, can definitely cook adobo!!! If ever you are in Vegas this must be on your list!!"

I was expecting something that was going to make my tastes buds happy and go \"mmmmmmm\" like how a s'more usually does... but that moment did not come.\n\nMy mom's seasoned potatoes had no flavor.\n\nMy sister's red velvet pancakes were a big flop; it was super bright in color (too much food coloring) and very lacking in flavor, if I was blindfolded, I would not have thought it was red velvet.  I guess I'm a little spoiled with red velvet pancakes from Cinnamon's out in Kailua, Hawaii - which is melt in your mouth chocolate heaven!\n\nI really wanted to like this place but it's just all hype - I'll wait until I go back to O'ahu to get some real red velvet pancakes, I'm going to bring my sister next time she's there so she will know what I'm talkin' about."

All other places bow down to the new cool kid on the block: Babycakes Cafe!\n\nEasy enough to find in the Northeast corner of Buffalo and Smoke Ranch, there was not one moment where I was not impressed. The ladies serving were all incredibly sweet and service was top notch. \n\nThe Salty:\n-  The fianc\u00e9 ordered corned beef hash and eggs which comes with crispy nuggets of happiness (hash browns).  The corned beef hash had the reminiscent lingering taste of childhood memories associated with the canned deliciousness that is corned beef hash.  mmmmm comforting canned food....  \n-  Chicken Adobo Fried Rice.  Anyone who's had chicken adobo knows that it is one bomb filipino dish.  Add that into fried rice, even better!  Wrap that into a fluffy egg wrap.  Mind blowing!  The fried rice inside consisted of shredded flavorful adobo chicken and super greasy (not a bad thing in my mind).  Add a touch of siracha, I fell in love at the first bite.\n\nThe Sweet:\n-  Red Velvet Pancakes.  Holy moly baloney!  This is the best breakfast marriage ever!  Red velvet cake is awesome by itself, and making into pancake form kicks its deiiciousness to unbelievable levels!  The texture of the pancake itself had a very slight crispiness on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside.  Add in a healthy dollop of whipped cream and chocolate bits on top, I don't even think I needed to use the cream cheese syrup at all.  Sweet sweet pancake bliss......... mmmmm\n\nConclusion:  Babycakes, you are the ruler of my breakfast world."

I'm not mad about it.  I'm just jealous, that's all.\n\nThere was about a 20 minute wait at 10am on a Friday.  This place was packed!  That didn't change during our whole meal, people eat, people leave, more people sit and more people eat.  I think we got here at the right time, because it seemed like the people who came after we got seated had a longer wait time.  This isn't a big place, maybe one day, they'll expand.  Anyways.....\n\nI've been terrible at deciding lately, but I suppose it's just a Vegas thing.  Too much looks good, and there's not enough space in my body.  I was torn between the Spam scramble with rice and mac salad, and the Ricks adobo fried rice omelet....What to choose?!?  Lucky for me, my mother-in-law ordered the adobo fried rice, and I was able to get the Spam scramble, but I changed out my white rice for garlic fried rice, of course!  \n\nSo the Spam gets diced and thrown in with eggs and cooked on the flattop, and left a teensy bit runny, and while that would have been just gravy, they went and sprinkled Furikake on it!  It kinda seems to lift everything it gets put on, that Furikake.  Next time, I'm going to put it on my frozen yogurt and make it 10x better.  The only thing that kind of turned me off to my breakfast was my rice, because the garlic and onion were both slightly raw.  Is that a Hawaiian thing?  I've just never had it that way, and when I cook, I make the garlic kind of crispy and dice and saute the onions so they're less noticeable, , but it wasn't that bad due to my LOVE of garlic and onion, even if it was a bit undercooked.  The Mac salad, al dente noodles with subtle flavored dressing, I don't know anyone that LURVES mac salad, I certainly don't hate it.  I hate half because I was saving room for....wait for it......\n\nAdobo fried rice omelet!  \n\nI'm from that school of eating that loves to cut their food up into little pieces, mix it all together and eat it with a spoon, and adobo and rice?  Certainly falls into the category of foods that take well to being mangled like that.  I just wish it was Pork Adobo instead of chicken.  But I suppose if I'm going to gain a pound a day every time I'm in Vegas, I should do it healthier right?  \n\nThe adobo fried rice omelet, so wrong yet so right!  Soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, shredded meat and rice all wrapped up in egg and sprinkled with green onions?  Done improperly, this could be about the worst garbage ass omelet in the history of man, but in the magic hands of the chef at Baby Stacks, it turns into a culinary masterpiece!  Just don't be afraid to destroy the art, it can't stay beautiful forever.  \n\nGood coffee, great food, a bit on the small side, but a great place to start your day.  Just don't forget to get portuguese sausage like I did.  I guess I have another reason to make my way back to BabyStacks."

We have been trying to eat somewhat healthy, and this showed up under a search for 'healthy breakfast' haha well after reading about red velvet pancakes, all bets were off. We turned on the GPS and headed over.\n\nWe waited for quite awhile, probably a half hour or so, because of the fact that it was Saturday at around 11:30. We really hit the rush because right when we sat down, like four or five tables got up and they didn't get re-seated (do we stink or something!?)\n\nThe menu looked INCREDIBLE. Banana cream pie pancakes, carrot cake pancakes, orange creamsicle pancakes, SMORES pancakes, and I believe cookies and cream pancakes (there were plenty others but these stuck out to me). We had choice overload, because every single one sounded unbelievable. Since we also read about the homemade corned beef hash, I also wanted to try that.\n\nWe ended up getting the meal that comes with eggs, corned beef hash, and a couple of pancakes, and ordering a separate short stack as well. We got the short stack of red velvet, and the other 2 were banana cream pie.\n\nWell, first, the corned beef hash was FANTASTIC. I would come back just to have that for breakfast again. For some reason I was craving it, and man did it hit the spot. \n\nThe red velvet pancakes were probably the best I ever had, and mostly because of the creamcheese sauce they put on top. If I wasn't 'eating healthy' I would have asked for some extra, because that would have made it the best thing in the whole world.\n\nThe banana cream pie ones were also really good, but my girlfriend felt they tasted a bit too artificial. I personally really liked them. \n\nThe bill was something like 20 bucks, and for 2 people including coffees, we were more than happy with that. The two woman that were at the front were also really friendly, and chatted with us about our experience afterwards.\n\nGreat value, great breakfast, and incredible pancakes. Will definitely be back again."

I was torn between lemon ricotta, hazelnut and banana cream pie pancakes...(they need a sampler plate! For real!) I asked my waiter, Mike, his suggestion and he told me lemon ricotta was the way to go. Delicious!! But the pancakes are way HUGE. I mean huge. Bigger than your head. Think the size of a large dinner plate. The short stack is three pancakes. I went famished but finished about half.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were thin halfway between a pancake and a crepe and had a nice lemony taste. I squeezed on some fresh lemon and butter and dipped them in cream cheese syrup (WHAT???) and had a foodgasm. \n\nI am going back to try some more!\n\nMy bill came to $16.50. Very reasonable.  I had coffee, oj, short stack of pancakes, and a side of scrambled eggs. I'd probably skip the eggs, not great...and since the pancakes are so huge I wouldn't have needed them if I'd known."

My boyfriend and I needed to fuel up before we head out to the outlet for some serious shopping. We wanted pancakes so I did a quick Google search under \"Best brunch in Vegas\" and this came up as one of the 10. I have the tendency to look up menus to see if anything jumps out at me before I actually head there...the red velvet pancakes got me.\n\nThis cafe ended up being a little further than I expected off the strip...but wasn't hard to find. \n\nTo our surprise, we walked into a Filipino owned restaurant! It's as if the motherboard was calling my boyfriend home! :p As we got to our seat, I kept seeing patrons munching on a breakfast burrito and I couldn't find it on the menu at all! Whenever there's a breakfast burrito on the menu, I had to get it. So being too shy to ask, I ended up ordering Baby Chick Omelette with a side upgrade of the red velvet pancakes.

The red velvet pancakes were good but I think Larchmont Bungalow in LA makes it better. I had a bite of the Adobo Fried Rice. It was good but a little dry for my taste. My boyfriend loved it though. His Rocky Road pancakes were to die for!!! It's ice cream in carbs form. Yum!!\n\nI think this establishment is a great change from your strip buffets and overpriced food. I would definitely come here again. \n\nAs we went to the front to pay, I noticed behind their cashier was a blackboard of....their specials. And guess what was on their...the burrito. :( Lesson learned...ALWAYS CHECK OUT THE BLACKBOARD FOR SPECIALS!"

Red pancakes sprinkled with choco chips and a huge dollop of what looks and taste like fresh whipped cream , served with cream cheese syrup . These are some of the best pancakes I ever ate, they taste like a cross between a cake and pancake. Pure genious .

It  was much smaller than we thought inside -- but not too crowded. Cozy, I'd call it.  But there are no booths, it's all table seating.\n\nThe staff was really nice and attentive as they could be considering it was pretty busy. We walked in around 10:30 on a Saturday morning, but we must've gotten lucky, because despite her saying it would be 20-25 minutes, we were seated within 5 minutes. Not too shabby.\n\nI ordered the Mexican Omelette with buttermilk pancakes instead of toast.  The omelette was delicious -- could've been a little spicier or maybe had another elements, like pico de gallo, but I just hit it with some Tabasco and all was well. Delicious carnitas, pepper jack cheese, jalapenos and topped with sour cream. Yum. I'd order it again, for sure.\n\nI'm kind of picky about my pancakes. So many places make them heavy or dense or way, way, WAY too big. I don't need silver dollars, but I prefer them smaller than my face.  These are the exact right size, especially to accompany eggs.\n\nI wanted to try the red velvet pancakes everyone raves about. The guy at the table across from us ordered them and they looked amazing.  Babystacks lets you get a specialty pancake instead of just buttermilk in lieu of toast, but I figured if this is a breakfast joint that specializes in pancakes, I should start with the basics. If their buttermilk pancakes are good, the rest probably are, too.  And they were good! I ate them both and ended up bringing home most of my omelette.\n\nNext time, I'd like to try the lemon ricotta stacks or the red velvet. There are really so many to choose from, though i'm not much of a dessert-for-breakfast type of girl, so I likely won't try them all.\n\nBut I'll definitely be back -- it was comparably priced with places like Cracked Egg just up the street.  And while I love Cracked Egg, Babystacks will provide a nice alternative, especially when I really want pancakes."

My husband and I came here by the suggestion of our family in Vegas, I read the reviews and Yelp, and I was not disappointed.  \nFirst of, it's a small, cozy venue.  Greeted really nicely.  Reasonably priced. \nWe could not decide on the flavors of pancakes so we had 3 short stacks: banana cream pie, red velvet, and bacon pancakes. Plus we had a side order of the Portuguese sausage.  Everything was delicious.  My husband loves the red velvet.  It was not super sweet, just perfect favors. Enjoy!!"

It has so much flavor and the carnitas are properly cooked. The skillets come with pancakes so my kids always have something to eat without having to order their own meal (they are 1 and 3 and can't eat a huge portion). \n\nThe prices are reasonable especially for how fresh and consistent the food is.\n\nThe only reason I took away a star is because the wait time is always so long!!! They definitely need a bigger location to accommodate their business!"

Oh how I love thee....let me count the ways..                                                                                                                                         \n\n1.) Red Velvet Pancakes (Yum!!) - These pancakes are nice and light. Not too heavy. Very flavorful but not too rich where you feel like you would need to drink a gallon of milk. To top off this wonderful dish it comes with a whipped light cream cheese syrup and mini chocolate chips.           \n\n2.) Loco Moco - ( Oh ma gawd!) - This amazing dish is made up of steamed rice, an all beef patty, and eggs served any way with brown gravy on top. So magical. All the flavors blended together very well. The only thing I don't like about this dish is the macaroni salad that comes with it. No flavor. Maybe you could substitute the salad with some fruit?                                                                                                                            \n\n3.) LJ's  Scramble - (Kids dish) - This dish is on the kids menu. I think they give a nice size portion for the price. It comes with a scrambled egg, sausage or bacon, hash browns (which is enough for my daughter and I to share) and 1 baby stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n\nBaby stacks is known for their gourmet style pancakes. They have several different options to choose from such as s'more, lemon ricotta, carrot cake, Rocky road, cinnabon, and bacon. If I could ever get out of my comfort zone, step out of the box and try something new, I would like to try these other pancakes. They sound wonderful! I will also need to try the Kaluha pig Benedict or spinach Benedict. I hear these dishes are tasty as well?   Baby stacks has two locations. I live closer to this location (smoke ranch) but I think the one off of Flamingo is a bigger? You definitely want to get to either location early because there can be somewhat of a wait. I am a fan though and find myself going at least 1-2 times a month."

If you like the smokey flavor, then get this! I've had salmon eggs benedict before, but the flavor of this thing just BURSTS forth like no other.) We also got the Honey Toast AND the Wheat French Toast. Both HIGHLY recommended. If you LOVE HONEY then get the Honey Toast, and if you really love cinnamon and the whipped cream from here AND a crunchy texture, get the Wheat French Toast. See, the Wheat French toast had \"cereal bits\" built into the bread that added an extra level of crunchiness, yum yum! Rick's Adobe Fried Rice was also on our table and was devoured within a few minutes.\n\nThese are just some of the things we ordered which were definitely NOT your typical breakfast/lunch items (except country fried steak and eggs).

This last trip, we went to Babycakes Cafe (@BabycakesCafeLV), which is about 20 minutes off the Strip. Their claim-to- fame is pancakes inspired by popular cupcake flavors -- you know it was a must-try for Kim.\n\nThe pancakes were really good. They were light and fluffy but packed full of flavor. You can tell they put a lot of care into their pancakes and perfecting cupcake-like pancake batters. They had many flavors like lemon ricotta, peanut butter, strawberry and we had a hard time choosing. We decided to go with red velvet and carrot cake pancakes. Both were awesome and served with a cream cheese syrup. One suggestion for them, selfishly speaking, would be to create a pancake sampler to give customers an opportunity to try a variety of their flavors. We had to order two separate dishes just so we could taste more than one of their flavors.\n\nIn addition to cupcake pancakes and traditional breakfast menu items, they also have Filipino and Hawaiian-inspired dishes. I ordered Rick's adobo fried rice. This is a Filipino dish that includes shredded chicken adobo and fried rice, wrapped in egg.\n\nIt was nice to find a place that Kim and I can both enjoy. It lets her justify eating cupcakes for breakfast and gives me an opportunity to eat dishes that I enjoyed when I lived in Hawaii. Moreover, it has a little bit of everything so you can satisfy a diverse group of people and palettes. The food was very good and we stuffed ourselves. They could work on their service a bit. They have a lot of teenagers working that don't have a lot of service experience - you have to ask for refills or flag them down when you want your check, but the food was awesome, so it's definitely worth a visit."

The only thing I was a little disappointed in upon ordering was the macadamia nut pancakes. Having had authentic Hawaiian macadamia nut pancakes with the sauce all over the top, I think I kind of had high expectations. I personally couldn't taste much of the macadamia nut flavor and felt as though I was eating a regular stack of pancakes."

Heard about Babycakes a while back and finally tried it this morning with another breakfast lover. The menu is phenomenal. I'd go back with a large group - preferably after running a marathon so I could indulge guilt-free! This is a breakfast and lunch place but I was all about breakfast.  The menu featured any kind of egg item imaginable - many omelettes. Eggs benny. Etc.  And this place is a carb lover's dream come true. Pancakes. Waffles. Crepes. Combos. I tried an egg combo with poached eggs and turkey bacon so I could enjoy bites of two different types of pancakes - banana and also peanut butter. (Go with someone you feel very comfortable with so you can share and sample, as I did today.)   The peanut butter pancakes (studded w/chocolate chips) were outstanding. So good that I was content after a few delicious bites. I'd love to try the cinnamon bun pancakes (a special this week) or the mac nut pancakes. The menu also featured carrot cake pancakes, s'mores, lemon ricotta and many others.  Side items include everything imaginable plus some more unusual items, like garlic fried rice. The eggs benny varieties were also impressive!  Kalua pig eggs benny, for example. Loved the inventive and affordable kids menu , which features a grilled PB&J.  This places gets really busy on weekends so trying it for the first time during the week is a good idea.  Was worried the hightop tables would be uncomfortable but the leather barstools were great - they also had some lower tables.  I loved that the combos are so inventive and that the menu was so extensive."

I honestly HATE spending money on breakfast. What is a pancake, except for some flour and water? And Let's be real, waffles are WAAAAAY better. \n\nExcept here! We found BabyStacks when looking online at places to eat off the strip. We live in Ut and make the trek to Las Vegas a few times a year. Buffets and overpriced hotel food gets old. When we heard about the red velvet pancakes, we figured it was worth the drive. \n\nBabyStacks, is really small, and if you get there are the wrong, time or with a larger group expect to wait. We were a party of 4 and waited about 25 minutes on a week day. It is a family run establishment and everyone is really friendly and nice. They are quick to refill your drinks and check in a few times to see if you need anything else, and to make sure everything is tasting great. The staff was really accommodating- my mom wanted Adobo but no rice, and not in a full plate. They threw in a side for her, free of charge so she could taste it. Maybe it was because we ordered so many damn pancakes. \n\nWe decided to just go hog wild. We ordered 6 small stacks so we could all try different pancakes: red velvet, carrot cake, rocky road, orange creamsicle, white chocolate macadamia Nut & banana cream pie. They were surprisingly delicious. We figured we would find one or two that was a miss, but we didn't. The carrot cake was my favorite, and the orange creamsicle tasted just like the popsicle of my childhood. I only wish they had a sampler platter so that you could taste a variety of pancakes. \n\nWe will defiantly be going back on our next trip to finish tasting the rest of the pancake menu."

I understand that this makes sense in case a person gets seated at a bigger table and then the rest of their party doesn't arrive until much later which could cause wait times to lengthen. However, sometimes people only have an hour lunch and if one of the party their meeting up with is able to go early and order everyone's food so it's on the table by the time everyone else gets there then what's wrong with that? All the food is being ordered at the same time! Especially for a small party of three which would not take a big table even if the rest of the party got held up and didn't show all the food would have still gotten paid for. Also, if your establishment is doing so well that you have to have this unpleasant policy bc of all the people that want to eat your food then get a bigger establishment. Babystacks is no hole in the wall even tourists go there. It would be a nice place for an afternoon brunch when family or out of town friends are here except that it is so small. I really like the food at this place but today they made me feel like they were too good to work with me and my situation. When I called the girl who answered the phone said it was the manager's call and when I asked to speak with the manager she said, \"Well he's busy if you wanna hold it would be awhile.\" Just disappointing service."

I'm not a pancake fan by any stretch of the imagination, but the reviews made them sound so good that I was a believer. I'm really happy I got over my hatred for pancakes and gave Babycakes a try.\n\nMy brothers, a friend, and I made this our last stop in Vegas before heading home. While it was a little out of the way for us, it was well worth it. We waited maybe 20 minutes, just long enough for me to change my mind on my order a few hundred times. I was going to go with the s'mores pancakes or the white chocolate macadamia pancakes, but I ended up giving in to the Yelp reviews and going with the red velvet.\n\nAnd you thought my hatred for pancakes was bad, I despise red velvet. Not because it tastes bad (it doesn't), but EVERYONE is doing it. Every bakery and cupcake shop from here to Kalamazoo is doing it. Every baker on Cupcake Wars thinks they have the original, prize winning, most amazing, down-home, just like moms red velvet cupcake. It's run of the mill. It's tired. It's boring. It's so freaking cliche I can't handle it.\n\nThen there was Babycakes. It's criminal what they've done here. A short stack (three pancakes, full stacks are six) of fluffy, brilliantly colored red pancakes command your attention from across the restaurant (and they did at least three times). On top sits a generous mound of whipped cream studded with chocolate chips. Heaven on earth! They come with a side of a lightly sweetened cream cheese syrup. The pancakes are prefect without the syrup, but add a little and you'll be sure to find yourself in a foodie nirvana. The red velvet pancakes were simply amazing. Sweet, tender, not at all like any other pancake I've had.\n\nMy brother had the cinnamon roll pancakes and they were delicious as well. I'm not entirely sure if the pancakes themselves were  regular pancakes or something else, but they were good. Topped with a cross-hatch of the cream cheese frosting, a dusting of cinnamon sugar, and a generous handful of walnuts and these things are phenomenal!!! They come with a side of regular syrup, though I doubt you'll be needing that.\n\nMy friend loved her omelette, but her pancakes were the epitome of my distaste for pancakes. This surely wasn't Babycakes' fault, I blame the pancakes. My brother loved his bacon pancakes.\n\nService was great, really friendly. We ordered and our food was out within minutes. Everyone was so friendly and the food was delicious. We will certainly be back!"

We were told there's no wait, come on down!  So we jumped in the car and got there literally 5 minutes later and there was *surprise* a 25 - 30 minute wait.  There were only 2 parties in front of us, so I figured it would probably be less of a wait.  Well, we ended up waiting 40 minutes.  That put a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth right at the beginning of this experience, going from no wait to a 40 minute wait.  But that's the nature of the restaurant biz, and I wanted those red velvet pancakes!\n\nWe ordered.  I ended up getting an omelet and upgraded my bread side to the RVP, my husband got the fried rice adobo, and my mom got the Eggs Benedict.  When the food came out...I was surprised by how crappy it looked.  Sorry to be blunt, but that's how it looked: crappy.  I expected more after hearing so much buzz.  My omelet, which was supposed to have swiss cheese in it, had 2 slices of processed-store-bought-fake-sandwich-slice white stuff barely melted on top.  My potatoes were obviously from a frozen bag and blandly seasoned at that.  My husband didn't mind his fried rice, but said it was very dry.  My mom's eggs benedict was just ok, and it also came with the frozen potatoes.  I couldn't believe the lack of quality.\n\nThe RVP were the only saving grace for the place.  They truly are delicious and I'm glad I got to experience them.  However, I definitely would not be able to eat a whole order of them as they are extremely sweet.\n\nSo in short: the wait is long, the food is from frozen and processed crap, and the pancakes are delicious.  Would I make a trip back and wait that long just for the pancakes, though? No."

We like trying food places and found this great place for breakfast/brunch.  \n\nWe went here as party of 12. The service was so attentive and kind.  Food was the bomb!!!  I had the kahlua pig benedict and a hazel nut pancakes.  Had some of my son's adobo fried rice (wrapped in egg) and it was delicious.  My son says it was one of the best fried rice he's  ever had.  I'd recommend this place to anyone in or visiting  Vegas"

After reading a bunch of reviews about Babycakes Cafe, I decided to make the drive across town for some \"AWESOME\" breakfast.  Ok so trust me here, it did not disappoint.  The taste and atmosphere went well beyond my expectations.  \n\nOur orders consisted of:\n\n- Red Velvet Pancakes - I suggest you get the short stack if you're not a big eater, because even that felt a lot.  The taste and consistency of the pancake was amazingly delicious, and the cream cheese syrup is what made the taste even better.  \n\n- S'mores Pancake - I've always been a big fan of s'mores, but for some reason this dish just didn't catch me.  It was good, but I was under the impression that the batter would have s'mores in it.  Probably something I wouldn't order again.\n\n- Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict - OMG! you won't believe how amazing this dish was. Everything about it was just delicious! This dish made my trip worth while.  The flavors of everything just bursts in your mouth, like a \"FOOD ORGASM!\" Ok, probably not the right choice of words, but I wouldn't know how else to describe it.  Get it, and you won't be disappointed."

The place is nice and homely filled with welcoming services and a great variety of choices (especially for those asian/filipino people and their type of breakfast with rice and spam.. etc).  I ordered a crunchy whole grain french toast and i must say i was very surprised how good it was! it seems very simple, a french toast covered in crunchy corn flakes, but it was so yummy and good looking, the people next to me ordered it too and loved it! My boyfriend got an veggie omlete and the red velvet pancakes as the side so we can both try. Overall this place was good but I wouldn't drive all the way across town to come eat again, sorry!"

Obviously, by the look of everyone's review its screaming out RED VELVET PANCAKES!!! Once I saw those three words, I immediately bookmarked it! I was sooo stoked when my girlfriends and I went on Sunday morning. There were groups of people standing outside and my first thought was \"this place is serious.\" It was a bit of a drag with the wait time taking more than 30 mins since we were starving. So definitely must come early on weekends. \n\nI ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes of course. You have a choice of ordering the short stack (3 pancakes) or the big stack (6 pancakes). It was absolutely amazing. So fluffy. So velvety. And the cream cheese syrup adds the cherry on top. It was pure heaven in my mouth. I had one of those silent moments to myself for a good 3 mins (: I've gotten to try the Smores pancakes as well from my cousin's order. It was also good but it did not compare to the red velvet. \n\nI've also tried some of the Kalua Pig Benedict from one of my girlfriends, which has the toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. That was a good choice! The meat was tender and juicy. Plus adding ketchup and hot sauce to it made it more flavorful! I love spice. \n\nI was completely satisfied with my whole experience. The staff, the service, the quality of the food, and the atmosphere of Babycakes Cafe were fantastic! Spread the word... this place is phenomenal."

I sprinkled a bit of lemon on them as well, which added a bit of extra zest!\n\nThe Kalua Pig Benedict was okay- the pork was tender and flavorful, but the \"hollandaise\" sauce was closer to congealed and brought the dish down quite a bit. It wasn't terrible, but I would try something different next time. \n\nOther dishes at our table included a skillet (looked delicious) and the red velvet pancakes, which were basically cake disguised as breakfast and well appreciated all around."

From what I saw, most of the items on the menu are your typical breakfast/brunch items: eggs, bacon, crepes, etc. I'm sure they're all cooked great BUT I really encourage you to get the menu items that make this restaurant unique! It seems that a very popular choice is Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelette. Yup, thats: fried rice lathered in chicken adobo sauce and chicken, wrapped in an egg omelette - making it look like a burrito. It is indeed very good, and that's an endorsement coming from a Pinoy. For those not too familiar with Filipino food, the rice/chicken part WILL be salty, so if you're not in to salty foods, this may not be for you.\n\nDespite being a big fan of that dish, my family members around me got it so I just picked off their plates. I myself got the Kalua Benedict with country potatoes. What makes the benedict special is its shredded pork. The pork is so tender and moist, its a unique substitution from what you typically have on benedicts.\n\nMy dad and uncle both got the Loco Moco, and although I didn't get to taste it, they both gave their endorsements. We all ordered nutella crepes, and that plate is very large! We were able to split it among 6 peoples as a perfect dessert.\n\nWhat a gem! Mahal na mahal kita!"

However, I am also a very small person.\n\nI loved that it only cost a couple dollars extra to upgrade my pancakes from plain buttermilk to the.. of course.. RED VELVET PANCAKES.  Lol!\n\nThey were definitely good and pleasing and different however... just like my overall opinion of this place... nothing to go out of my way for.\n\nThe service was attentive, and the place was very small.  I went on a weekday morning so there was no wait but I can't imagine on a weekend morning!\n\nWas pleased and will go back, but nothing I can see myself craving."

This place is not that big, so I can see a wait being an issue if it was busy and if you were a party over 4 there is really only one table that you can be sat at. We ordered S'mores, Cinnamon pancakes and Spinach Benedict with fruit. Everything was delicious. Service is excellent. I like how you just pay at the register. Great pancake place. I am actually sad that it is a 30 minute drive for me."

I have no complaints because when I go, there's only a few tables occupied. I usually go when they first open.  The food is good. Their Red Velvet pancake is a must have. Nom nom nom. My mouth is drooling thinking about it. Well the Red Velvet is nice and fluffy. It's not chocolately like a red velvet cake. It has that perfect balance to it. The icing and dollop of whip cream I think with mini chocolate chips makes the pancake taste even better."

I have pulled into the parking lot and left as many times as I have been in to eat. They are almost always busy, which is a great thing for them and a good sign of the food.

Some people who the hostess apparently knew were offered coffee while they waited, but nobody else was.  Our 20 minute wait was actually a 40 minute wait.  We ordered red velvet pancakes, smores pancakes and an omelet. We all thought the food was awful.  It was obviously prepared quickly and just slopped on the plates.

Service is friendly and quick, but once they give you your bill make sure you head to the front to cash out- the servers don't do that part.\n\nKAHLUA PORK BENEDICT: Didn't care for the cabbage, found the pork itself a little bland, but somehow all the flavors together really made a great dish. Wish the potatoes had just a touch more seasoning, but they were perfectly crisp.\nHUNTINGTON SKILLET: Seasoned potatoes topped with over-easy eggs, bacon, cheese, pico de gallo, AND avocado?! It's a party in your mouth, no additional seasoning needed. \nWHITE CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA NUT PANCAKES: These are so sweet, you wont even need the syrup. Between the two of us, we couldn't even finish a short stack they were so sugary. Didn't detect any macadamia flavor or crunch, though.\nGARLIC RICE: Love how fragrant this dish is! Smelled it cooking and had to have some, definitely tempted to upgrade to the adobo fried rice next visit.\n\nThe thing that really amazed me was that none of the food we received was unnecessarily greasy, a common issue with breakfast/diner food. If you want to come here, better to go early (before 10) or wait til lunch- the place really cleared out by 11:30AM. Really liked the friendly island-style service, want to come back for the Kahlua grilled cheese."

My poached eggs came out well and I didn't even get the opportunity to send it back because no one came to check on us. \n3. Your red velvet pancake is the bomb, but it's not showcased. It's like having Kobe Bryant on your team, but keeping him on the bench. Why bother? \n4. The wait is atrocious for people who would want to trek here for breakfast. If you live far away and come here to wait for another 45 min - 1hr, you may leave feeling disappointed. \n\nI guess my expectation for this place was too high.

You would think they could at least get the regular pancakes right, they were not soft and fluffy and couldn't even fork into them to cut a piece off, they were subpar at best.  My hubby had the biscuits and gravy which the gravy was flavorless, the scrabbled eggs were runny, and the sausages links, he had me try them, there was definitely something wrong there.  The corned beef hash was little to be desired.  We got there very early and didnt have to wait to be seated but if we had to wait, I would've never heard the end of it from the husband.  Will never go back, I know I didn't try the \"specialty pancakes\" but so what, it's a breakfast place, get the breakfast part right too. Will return to my regular place from now on as hey have never disappointed me.  Yelpers.....you are so off.  WOW!"

For those who don't know what chicken adobo is, it's a very popular Filipino dish. It's basically chicken cooked with soy sauce and vinegar. My friend ordered the red velvet pancakes and those were amazing! They taste as good as they look!\n\nThe second time I went, I had the spam scramble, which was pretty good. Nothing too special though. My friend ordered the Loco Moco, and we both had the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes!

I waited until a day that I had a good, long workout in before venturing over and imbibing what I assumed would be massive amounts of carbs.  Today was that day:  I ran 10 long miles (triathlon training) beforehand and then met a friend at 8:30am for the sugar-fest.  There was a short wait for our table since this is a cozy, little joint, but we were seated in 5 minutes instead of the 15 that was initially mentioned.  Service was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal.  Afraid that the red velvet pancakes would be just too sweet for a whole breakfast, I ordered the corned beef hash, eggs over medium, and hash browns with the pancakes on the side.  Yes, this girl can eat!  The nice surprise is that the pancakes were not as sweet as expected.  Yes, they come topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips, but the cream cheese syrup is on the side and one can control how much sweetness with that stuff.  I LOVED them!  My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were also delish.  I want to go back tomorrow and try some of the other tempting items on the menu--it may be a blessing or a curse that Babycakes is right down the street from my house!"

Not too sweet and amazingly light and fluffy. \n\n-Do not order a side of the potato spuds. By far, one of the worst sides of potatoes I've ever had. Greasy and looks like it was slathered with oil AFTER they were done. The portion was beyond tiny too, which is ridiculous, as potatoes are one of the cheapest things for a restaurant to deal with. \n\nI'll probably come back if I have a craving for the RW or lemon ricotta pancakes.

            "review": "Went here looking for a real good breakfast spot after reading the reviews.  I must say that overall, I was pretty disappointed.  I wanted to like this place, I really did, as I want a great breakfast spot.  This is a pretty small (about 10 tables) spot in a little shopping center.\n\nFirst off, the orange juice I ordered was tasted like cheap concentrate, which is a knock against them in my book.  Second, the service was pretty slow.  We were a party of 6, and they brought 2 plates of food, then a few minutes later, 2 more.  By the time they brought the last 2 orders, I had already almost finished my breakfast.  Not to mention, one of the last orders was bacon and eggs, and the bacon was ice cold when it came out.  Third, the potatoes that came with some of the entrees were just frozen bag potatoes (the little squares), which were mediocre at best.  I had a full order of blueberry pancakes, which were fine, but nothing to write home about.  They say they are homemade, but does that just mean you made some instant batter?  The pancakes were not terrible, although I thought they were a little rubbery, and the portion size did not blow me away.  My wife, however, did enjoy her cowboy omelette quite a bit.  She stated the mix and texture of ingredients was very good, although I do not enjoy omelettes so I cannot comment directly.  Also, some in my party had huevos rancheros, which had a pair of absolutely dry and miserable looking cheap store bought tortillas in them.\n\nThe menu is filled with a lot of esoteric items, like red velvet pancakes, loco moko, kalua pig, etc.  I think that a great deal of the interest in this place is the variety of unique breakfast offerings on the menu.  However, I found that for standard breakfast fare, the quality and service were pretty mediocre at best.  Now to be fair, the service was polite and friendly, just not that efficient.  Overall, I found what most of us ordered to be perfectly average or below average, so I am not sure where the fuss is.  Maybe if I had ordered something unique like the red velvet pancakes, but as I said before, I would expect better work on the basics."

All were excellent -- even better than anticipated! My omelet was chockful of chicken and rice, and the marinade made the chicken taste almost like pork. (It reminded me of my grandma's pork-fried rice, and that's a good thing!) The only bad thing I can say is that I loved the adobo so much that I can't imagine ordering anything else. (Maybe a different side dish, although the red velvet pancakes were delicious.)\n\nThis place is tiny, which is part of the reason why there's usually a line out front.

I read the yelp reviews and got excited because it's close to where I live and I've been looking for a really great and convenient breakfast spot... but after my two experiences here, I will never go back. Even if it was across the street from my house and offered free breakfast, I would never ever go back. It is that disgusting. \n\nHow do you mess up any egg dish? That blows my mind. I had a denver omelet and it was mostly egg, hardly any cheese or peppers, and just had maybe 10 ity-bity bits of ham. Other than the loud-mouthed waitress who had no manners, what I noticed the most from this visit were the cheap crappy plates and tableware. Never seen anything so cheap in any restaurant ever in my life. I felt dirty using them.\n\nOn the second visit (yes, I stupidly gave it a second shot), I had steak and rice, and both were absolutely inedible. HOW DO YOU F UP RICE?!! The rice was hard and dry. The steak was like the meat I would imagine you would get in prison. It was tiny, round, and charred to the point where all you could taste is charcoal. The meat was so hard that the cheap flimsy fork wouldn't penetrate it. \n\nBut that's not the disgusting part. \n\nI reached for the steak sauce so I could try to choke this charred crap down and nearly dropped the bottle. The bottle looked like it's been used and refilled for at least five years without being cleaned in any way. The opening of the bottle was so clogged with nasty, crusty old sauce, I'm sure the sauce that was left in there would only trickle out. Not that I wanted to use it after seeing that. Then I reach for my straw to drink the nasty water and the straw was stained with what looked like blood O_O. I quickly dropped that too, completely appalled. I waved the waitress down to get another straw, and she grabs another from her dirty apron and throws it on the table and guess what?... it's stained and crusty looking too! \n\nAt that point I decide I'm done. I didn't eat, didn't drink and I just wanted to run out of there as fast as I could. I grabbed my stuff and paid and got the hell out of there. I didn't raise hell or demand to speak to a manager because... how do you tell someone everything about their establishment is repulsive and they should be shut-down. I'd be embarrassed to even have to say that to a place of business. They should be ashamed. Yelpers beware."

It was more like brunch time when we got there and it wasn't packed, but most of the tables were full. \nI ordered the white chocolate macadamia pancakes with hash browns and bacon. My daughter had the kalua pig eggs benedict. Delicious all around and the bacon was thick sliced and cooked perfectly. Only negative was the two eggs on the benedict didn't match, one was cooked hard, the other was properly runny.\nIt's a small, cozy restaurant. If you're looking for waiters in tuxedos, this isn't your spot. But if you want a homestyle breakfast served by friendly people with a tv up in the corner showing the game, try Baby Stacks."

I seriously wished there were half-star ratings, as this place deserved more than just 4 stars.\n\nDad: Go find where the latest I-HOP or Dennys is that isn't on the Strip for breakfast. Don't want to walk that far.\nWhenever a suggestion of either occurs and I'd rather not go to chains , I use Yelp to find where I could find a gem.\nMe: (looks at the review page for this restaurant) How about this place? I'm already sold on red velvet pancakes.\nDad: Sure.\n\nSo after about ~20 minutes of driving, we come across what appears to be the REAL Las Vegas, even down to the \"Lugaw\" sign. We kinda got lost, but quickly found our way back after realizing that their restaurant was across the street and had changed their name.\n\nWe came in at just the right time, we were able to find seats yet the restaurant was starting to fill up. I observe the \"People Love Us on Yelp\" and \"Best of Las Vegas 2011\" stickers near the front door. \n\nAs I looked at the menu I see a couple of things that struck a chord. \"$1 extra for garlic fried rice\". \"Corned beef hash and eggs\". \"Rick's ADOBO fried rice\". This wasn't going to be a typical breakfast place. What sealed the deal was the \"extra charge to replace buttermilk pancakes with your favorite pancakes.\" SOLD. (If it wasn't already obvious, I'm a Filipino-American with a slight obsession for red velvet). It also helps that all the waitstaff looked Filipino.\n\nMy mom built her own omelet, dad ordered the adobo fried rice and I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs with garlic fried rice and red velvet pancakes.\n\nI was quite pleasantly surprised that our breakfast came out pretty quickly. I wolfed my dish down in probably the same amount of time it took to cook it while maintaining a sense of decency. The dish was everything I expected from a Filipino family if they were going to cook the same dish using American corned beef. The onion in the garlic fried rice was a nice touch and I'll consider modifying my garlic fried rice recipe to include onion.\n\nThe red velvet pancakes were quite delicious, it tasted like red velvet, but more savory than say a red velvet cupcake. Went well with the melted cream cheese frosting and chocolate chips.\n\nOne of these days I'll have to try the adobo fried rice. I wasn't able to have some because I didn't want to infect my dad with a cold, and though it was one of my choices as to what to order, I didn't order it because the dish didn't come with pancakes. Maybe next time.\n\nFrom this experience I learned a lesson: A lot of the more casual dining gems in Vegas are found off-strip and I look forward to finding more of them. I WILL come back here someday just to round off my review and (hopefully!) upgrade to a 5."

The cream cheese syrup is a bit on the sweet side, but it paired perfectly with the flavor of the pancakes - regular maple would not be nearly as good.  \n\nThe Eggs Benedict was also very good, although the ham was a little on the tough side.\n\nThere can be a super long wait here and they aren't always accurate with their quote times.  We were quoted 20 min and ended up waiting 45 min for a table.  They had many tables clear of people, but the one busser couldn't keep up to get people seated quickly.  They could get a lot more business if their service was ran more efficiently.  \n\nNonetheless, I would return for the fantastic food!"

There is always a wait as the restaurant is pretty small, but if you're a party of two, it seems easier to be seated quickly. Be prepared, though, you may be sitting REALLY close to people at the next table. I hate this, but for such an awesome breakfast, I'll sacrifice.\n\nI am not a pancake eater- I'm an egg & meat lover, but I just *had* to try the red velvet stacks. BabyStacks allows you to add their specialty stacks to your egg order, so I ordered a skillet (always my breakfast favorite) and added the red velvet pancakes. \n\nThe red velvet pancakes are not too thick, not too thin, sprinkled with mini chocolate chips and a generous dollop of whipped cream. The cream cheese syrup is to die for - it just totally reminds me Nothing Bundt Cake frosting! It's like eating chocolate cake for breakfast, which may gross some people out, but for a chocolate lover it's sinfully delightful.\n\nThe skillet was one of the better skillets I've had in Vegas. They layer potatoes, cheese, and any omelet choices and top them off with eggs any style. I ordered my skillet with onion, tomaotes, spinach, cheddar cheese and sausage. It was gigantic, could barely finish half, but so full of flavor. The tomatoes were very sweet - just the way I like them.\n\nNext trip: carrot cakes with cream cheese syrup!"

The combination of the oozing butter, the melted chocolate crumbles, and the whipped cream  added up to some of the best pancakes I've ever tasted. \n\ni also ordered the Adobo Fried Rice which also comes with a small macaroni salad.

Seasoned potatoes were a lil dry, but a lil over medium egg yolk solved that problem. I also tried the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice. What an awesome concept....eggs and fried rice in one. Yum! My pancakes.....well I don't think anything can beat my light fluffy blueberry pancakes from Maui....so that was a bust for me.\n\nOverall, service was good, we all left full and plates were emptied.

            "review": "This restaurant appears to be a mixed bag for me.  In some things, it is amazing, and in others, not so great.\n\nFirst as to ambience and first impressions:  The restaurant is small (maximum capacity 50) in an uninspiring but clean strip mall.  upon entering the restaurant, it is clean, with warm homelike decorations and a warm inviting somewhat neutral light brown paint color that you might see in model home.  The decorations are ones that you might get in a bed bath and beyond or pier 1 imports which give the ambience of a homelike restaurant environment.  Some of the tables are high stool oriented that use comfortable leather stools as the chairs.  Other tables are against the wall using hardwood bench seating as chairs.\n\nInitially the hostess was welcoming.  But within moments the hostess gave a cold uncaring impression.  She stated that the table would be ready in a few minutes and then proceeded to do cashier work, which was fine.  However, three new customers came in and for no less than 5 minutes, she never spoke with the new customers.  Not even the quick look up and \"I'll be with you in a minute.\"  She would even walk past myself and other customers and not establish eye contact.  Even when she did establish eye contact, there was no smile.  Not something that will destroy an experience, but also not something that would help the overall feel of the restaurant.\n\nUnfortunately, after being seated no menu was provided and it took the waitress a few pregnant pause minutes to get the menu to me.  I had the feeling that she was the only waitress in the restaurant -- which I later found out was not the case.  \n\nHowever, when she did provide the menu, her attitude and service were warm and friendly with many smilies.  She certainly helped to overcome the feelings that the hostess had created.  \n\nFood:  In this regard too, the restaurant did some things amazingly well, and others oh so mediocre.  For the good, they are known for their red velvet pancakes.  I tried them and they are very good.  If you don't like sweet, don't try them.  They are inviting and indulgent.  They come with a creme cheese syrup.  The two combined make for a taste of red velvet cake combined with a sweetness of a cinnabon roll with syrup.  Decadent.  The waitress invited me to have them as a side to my omelette which was just perfect -- rather than a full stack of pancakes.\n\nIn addition, I had the mexican omelet which included carnets, jalape\u00f1os, cilantro, onions, cheese.  The combination of the omelet and the pancake made for a wonderful confluence of tastes from spicy to sweet and then back.\n\nWith such a wonderful combination, the frozen potatoes that came with the omelet was such a violent speed bump on my wonderful country road journey for breakfast.  The potatoes were clearly dull, uninviting in taste and such a contradiction with the other dishes that you are now questioning why you came to the restaurant in the first place.  It is a shame that they couldn't just pan fry some homemade potatoes to complement an otherwise wonderful meal.  I felt like was experiencing a painting by an artist and as I moved from left to right I realize that the oil painting of the mona lisa is done in exquisite detail, but the background is quickly drawn in crayons because there is a deadline to put out volumes of art.\n\nOverall, I would still try to go to the place for an experience.  I would probably go again to see if the experience was the same, but I worry that the generic school cafeteria style could infect other dishes."

Upon walking in the first thing I heard was the local music playing in the background.  I haven't heard any local music since I last visited Hawaii during the summer, so it was a very nice surprise. \n\nThe menu at BabyStacks Cafe definitely reflects that Hawaii feel as well. There are some great breakfast selections such as Portuguese sausage & eggs, Rick's adobo fried rice, and of course the pancakes. I decided to try the red velvet pancakes after reading many, many, many positive reviews off of yelp. I also ordered a side of seasoned potatoes because of my HUGE potato addiction. \n\nThe red velvet pancakes weren't disappointing at all. Keep in mind they are sweet though, so if you don't care for sweet tasting foods I would stay away from them. The red velvet pancakes are served with whipped cream, chocolate bits, and a side of cream cheese syrup. The combination of all of those toppings definitely leaves a heavenly taste in your mouth after every bite. The seasoned potatoes had the perfect amount of seasoning and wasn't overpowering at all. The texture of the potatoes was slightly crispy, which I enjoyed very much. \n\nI definitely recommend that you try this place at least once. Be warned though, there is always a long wait to be seated. Also, the cafe is only open during select hours during the day, so be sure to double check those before heading out!"

Though the counter girl told us it would be a 30 to 40 minute wait and wrote our names on the list on the wall, with 4 people ahead of ours. The \"hostess\" was SUPER RUDE! She made it seem like they were doing US a favor by ALLOWING us to eat there! To make it worse, she started a new guest list, and after adding the next 10 customers that came in, she out those of us who had already been waiting AFTER THEM! So the 4 people in front of us quickly turned into 14 people in front of us! When I asked the hostess if she could adjust the list so that those of us who came in first could still be at the top of the list instead of the bottom, she became RUDE and snapped back \"I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!\" .. well, obviously, you don't.. So, that 30-40 minute wait turned into an hour and 15 minutes and there were STILL 5 people ahead of us! Which is messed up since there was only 4 ahead of us when we got there! To make it even better, some one missed their name because they went shopping to kill time had come back 30 minutes after their name was called and was still put ahead of those who had been waiting patiently!! I regret buying those Groupon tickets for Babycakes now, because now I'm stuck either forfeiting the money or going back to that hell hole full of rudeness.  I even tried calling and speaking to a supervisor, but no one will return my calls, so I guess management cares as little for their customers as their \"lovely\" hostess.

The adobo is nice and salty but not to much with the mac salad on the side this is winner and is highly recommended to try for your first time. The pancakes were a great surprise!! Chocolate pancakes were light but dense, I know weird but true! With cookie bits and an awesome syrup these pancakes was mean!!

Our fearless leader set up this Brunch and let me tell you I was really impressed. Upon entering the parking lot the place didn't look too special but I could see lots of people waiting for a table. I was running late as USUAL so once I entered we had already been seated. Our  server Jacob was prompt at greeting me politely with a smile and asking what he could get me to drink while he went to grab me a menu.

Let me tell you he was RIGHT!  about 3 of the 8 ladies went with the fancy eggs benedict varietes another got a crepe and some fruit. Since I didn't try any of them all I can say is EVERYONE had empty plates . My dish was super yummy but HUGE so I ended up bringing half of it home. I am terrible at remembering the names of items but I will say this place is priced around 10-15$ per entree but you get TONS of food and good quality taste and EXCEPTIONAL service. I was helped by Happy and Friendly people even when checking out and paying at the front. What impressed me the most though was they had no problem giving us seperate checks and at NO TIME were we rushed at all even while we were done eating and sitting there talking the afternoon away. I can't wait to return with my family to try out some more awesome dishes...If you're a breakfast person or even just a fan of delicious asian fushion give this place a shot!"

After a long wait 45minutes on a weekend we were finally seated five of us not including the baby. It states all over the menu that a party of six automatically gets charged a gratuity of 18%. We did not order a meal for the ten month old baby, the waitress did not serve the ten month old baby but yet counted him as a whole person charging us the 18% gratuity. I did not notice this on the receipt until we got home. I had left her a twenty dollar tip not realizing that she was counting the baby to get the 18%. I should have checked my receipt before I left the restaurant that is my fault. I don't think a ten month old baby should be counted as a whole person to get a big tip. I have learned a expensive lesson to always check your receipt at restaurants. I don't like this kind of business. Needless to say that I will not be dinning at BabyStacks cafe again."

Too bad they were out!  We picked other items off the menu and they were great.  I had one of the omlets and my husband had something with pancakes!  Sorry it has been a month so I don't remember exactly!  But it was GOOD!\n\nWhat also stood out was the great service we received.  Our waiter was very nice and that really stood out in our minds.

But....there is no way I could eat a stack of them for breakfast! \n\nSo we went at lunch time and ordered a stack for dessert! I will admit that they were just the tiniest bit dry but once you pour on that delicious cream cheese syrup, it didn't matter. We thought they might have been just a tiny bit better if they had mini chocolate chips in them (ala red velvet bundts at Nothing Bundt Cakes). We shared the Kalua pulled pork grilled cheese which was solid. Really good pulled pork with muenster and cheddar grilled on sourdough.  The fries were crispy but my son said they reminded him of the Ore Ida frozen fries that are marketed as \"extra crispy fast food fries\". He's right, that's totally what the fries are like. But not terrible.\n\nYoungest kid had a kids meal of scrambled egg, bacon, and hash browns with a s'more pancake on the side. Pretty standard fare except for the amazing pancake. It's a pancake with marshmallows, melts chocolate chips, graham cracker crumbs and marshmallow fluff.  So yum.\n\nWe went on a weekday close to 11am and had to wait close to 30 minutes. I'm sure weekends are crazy. Our server was great (and cute!) and very apologetic when our red velvet pancakes were delayed due to another server swiping them. \n\nWe'll be back every time we are in Vegas."

We both had the two egg breakfast with pancakes-regular and red velvet.  \n\nFirst, my eggs were delicious!  They tasted so fresh and were cooked just as I had asked-over medium.  I got them with seasoned potatoes which were not seasoned at all-just fried little squares.  But, that is fine cuz they soaked up my yolk just fine.  Dad said his eggs were great and he got hashbrowns that were cooked perfectly crispy and not at all greasy.\n\nNow onto the pancakes.  He got just the plain pancakes and they were not good at all!  It was like the dry mix was missing the sugar or there was too much baking soda.  They almost had a sour taste-blech. \nI was dying to try the red velvet.  I love, love, love red velvet cupcakes but sometimes they are just too sweet for me.  So when i read about these and that they aren't that sweet I had to come in and try them.  Okay, they were just okay.  I just feel like there was something missing.  They were a good texture and the cream cheese syrup was okay.  \n\nI will come back and try other things.  The omletes looked really good as do the eggs benedict, sandwiches...well it all looked good.  This is a nice small NON-CHAIN (love that) place that hopefully continues to do well and sticks around.  We need more of this kind establishment to help give the town some heart!"

It basically reminded me of going to my friends house (Filipino) after they had a party and in the morning making some scrambled eggs and eating some left over fried rice and adobo. Then serve have options for a side and recommended their special banana foster pancakes. Man that was just a taste of heaven! Also what was great about this place is the accommodation, since my gf is vegan they we're able to make a vegan breakfast burrito, did fresh vegetables and breakfast potatoes with avocado on the side.

My eggs on the other hand weren't scrambled soft per my request, but that's not a deal breaker for me I suppose. The service was friendly, and the spot is cute. They definitely need to expand, as I don't know I could regularly justify waiting 30-45 minutes on a weekday afternoon to get a plate of pancakes.

Without the cream cheese \"syrup\" and whipped cream, it would have been nothing special at all.\n\nWe also tried the Adobo Fried Rice, which comes in am omelete. It was a nice, large portion, but I thought there could have been less eggs, and more flavor. \n\nThe other specialty pancakes we tried were the Cinnamon Tres Leches (the best, in my opinion-- DELICIOUS), the Smores (soso- basically just pancakes with chocolate chips and cinnamon cereal and marshmallows on it), and the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut (our second favorite, our second favorite after the Tres Leches).\n\nAs for the service, the place was really really crowded. We arrived around 11:45 and it was about a 30 minute wait. I kind of felt like we were rushed, as the server kept asking to take away our plates. Despite how often she came by to try to clear the table, we got zero refills on coffee or drinks. Not even water. It wasn't until she bright the check that she asked if we wanted more coffee. I get that it's busy, but I feel like they should pay more attention to their service, rather than try to rush out all their diners."

We were seated right away (I mean, it was 7am so...obviously it wasn't very crowded). Took our orders right away and they were also ready quickly.\n\nBoth times I've been, I got a \"skillet,\" which is a type of meat and combination of veggies and cheese on top of some country potatoes with 2 eggs any style on top. I know this place is named after its pancakes, but honestly, if I don't have some none-carbohydrate food in the morning, I get hungry again 20 minutes later. 20 pancakes? Hungry in 20 minutes. 20 pancakes and 1 egg? Hungry in...many hours. I had the carnitas skillet (delicious) and some sort of chicken skillet (very good) and was very pleased with those decisions.\n\nOver 20 flavors of pancakes make this your toughest decision of the morning. I think pretty much any way you go, you'll get something delicious. I've had the PB & banana and the plain banana and both were fantastic; my older sis raved over the chocolate mint chip 'cakes as well. Anything you're into, they put in a pancake here, and they'll sub in flavored pancakes for the plain ones to any skillet or omelet meal. Definitely do that.\n\nHighly recommend, the earlier in the morning you can go the better! Can't wait for my next trip here!"

Being the lover of red velvet cupcakes that I am, I wanted to try out the red velvet pancakes that everyone was raving about to see if it really was that great.\n\nLadies and gents, the red velvet pancakes were better than just good. They were INCREDIBLY delicious! Every bite was like a fluffy piece of heaven. The last time I had red velvet pancakes was in LA and it was too overly sweet, but Babycakes did a great job of bringing out the flavor of red velvet without making it too sweet. The melted mini chocolate chips added a nice touch to the pancakes. The best part about it was the cream cheese syrup. It added a sweet touch to the pancakes and made it the perfect combo. \n\nI tried the eggs benedict here as well, and it was definitely one of the better ones I've had as well. The eggs were cooked just right, and I barely tasted the yoke that oozed out from the middle. Note: I dislike the taste of yoke, and prefer egg whites, so I rarely order eggs benedict. But the eggs benedict I tried here was delicious. It came with a side of hashbrowns, and those were crispy and yummy as well. \n\nOut waitress was attentive and great, parking space is ample, and I will definitely be returning again the next time I'm in town =)"

We waited about 1/2 before being seated and another 15 minutes before we got our food.  I was surprised that with the many Hawaii related food items that the decor had no tie-in to Hawaii.\n\nOur waitress was friendly and was quick to take our order.  She was so quick that we got our food before the couple that came in before us got there's.  (They had a different waiter)  I was disappointed that she offered us another beverage after our meal was done and we were about to leave.\n\nMy wife had the portuguese sausage and eggs with hash brown, and I got the Zippy's chili omelet with hash brown.  I got my food exactly what I ordered, but wished I got more chili.  My wife got the garlic rice instead of hash brown (which she didn't like and we felt it wasn't worth upgrading).  The mistake wasn't the waitress's fault, but with the kitchen because we didn't get charged extra for.\n\nOverall, the food and service was okay, but factoring in the wait time, the mistake with my wife's food and the constant staring from the couple.  I would rather go to the breakfast place up the street on Flamingo."

(shout out to my naning Mary Rose F.!) So I knew it was a must... I am the queen of breakfast... I love breakfast for lunch and/or dinner :)\n\nSo we got there closer to closing time (2pm on weekdays) because nobody vacationing in Vegas gets up earlier than noon (well, definitely not me!) so we beat the morning congestion and were seated promptly. I guess we got lucky because I've read that the wait can get pretty bad.\n\nI ordered the red velvet pancakes and my sweetheart ordered the s'mores pancakes. DAMN! Both were sooo good. The red velvet pancakes were like eating perfectly flattened cupcakes smeared with cream cheese syrup and whipped cream! Each bite melted in my mouth... perfection!  \n\nThe service was great too! My coffee cup was always filled and we didn't wait too long for our food to come out. Also, they were very accommodating and  even though we showed up closer to closing time, they didn't rush us at all which I appreciated very much. \n\nDefinitely a must-try especially if you're visiting from out of town. Yeah, so it's located on the other side of town from the strip but it's definitely worth the drive!"

I did my research prior and read most of the current yelps and decided I would try it out myself. We were greeted with a smile and offered drinks almost right away, surprised that someone could be that happy at 730 in the morning. She was attentive and helped us guide our way throughout the menu to her favs, and we decided to order a full stack of red velvet to share and a country Benedict. When the food hit the table about 10 mins later I was amazed. Everything was beautiful and served with the right portions. The red velvet was soft and lived up to every part of the hype it deserves. So as I went back and wanted to review babycakes I noticed some of the more negative reviews and I started to wonder, does anyone address the issues as they sit in the restaurant? When the server comes back to check on your meal do you attempt to have the errors corrected or do u sit here and yelp about an issue you never asked to be fixed in the first place. The employees here seem so willing to help that I can't imagine anyone leaving here dissatisfied.  I'm sure remaking something your not happy with wouldn't be a problem. Take it from me babycakes goes above and beyond with theie service and homemade goodness they call breakfast, this place is a must try!"

My hubby got the spam scramble and we got a short stack of bacon pancakes to share.\n\nWe both liked the spam scramble the most... so simple, yet so delicious! \n\nThe kahlua pig itself was also good, though I'd have to say, as a benedict with the hollandaise sauce, the two flavors were competing with each other.  And they didn't quite go together, in my opinion.\n\nThe bacon pancake was just okay too. I had such high hopes for it, since I love both things.  I was hoping the bacon was crumbled inside the pancake, but it was more like two strips of bacon plopped onto a cooking pancake. The pancake also seemed too fluffy to me.  Maybe as a meal on its own, it would've been delicious, but since we already ate other entrees before trying it, it became too much.\n\nI give 4 stars overall, because the service was superb, and there are so many more things I want to try from their menu!"
