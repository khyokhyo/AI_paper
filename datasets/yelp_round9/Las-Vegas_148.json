            "review": "Yet another strip mall restaurant that completely does not know how to arrange their shop, but that is neither here or there if the food is good. Before I entered I had heard good things about this place so was a bit put off but not unreasonably so. We were greeted and seated within a reasonable amount of time (it was like 11:00 am so I would hope so) and handed menus and placed a drink order that was filled immediately. So far so good.\n\nLike my quest for good Q, I have a thing for great pastrami. There are a few places in LV that do pastrami ok, but here was a cafe with one of the most unlikely sandwiches I could think of on the menu. They call it \"The 215\", (probably because the 215 freeway is a couple hundred yards away) and it is a pastrami, turkey, and slaw stack sandwich. Any of you Deli Heads recognize this recipe? It is the #11 at most deli's or what is known as \"The Sky High\". This is a good sandwich and from a pretty discriminating deli fan that is saying a lot. OK, it's not Canters Deli in LA, but it kinda reminds me of it. The only strange thing is they put it on a soft roll, not a Kaiser Roll, but then again, I have a feeling these people do not have a clue what real deli food is, they just got lucky. Look, they had crosses for sale and I am betting the place is owned by good Christians. Hey, no problem, just I am not seeing a lot of deli understanding, just good copying.\n\nMy wife ordered a Feta Burger. Feta, spinach, a sauce and a burger on the same soft bun and my wife enjoyed it. Side were acceptable. Beverages (Iced Tea and Iced Coffee) were fresh and tasty. Service was attentive to the point of maybe being too attentive. (There is something to be said for not being asked if everything is ok every 4 minutes.)\n\nI would come back here again, but honestly I do not see what the rave is all about. If doing a respectable job and having respectable food is now a 4 and 5 star dining experience I think people need to learn to be a little tougher in their reviews. This is a solid 3 star place and places it on the \"diners I would visit again\" list. Heck i would even take friends there. 5 stars, no. 4 stars, not likely, but a solid 3 stars with confidence.\n\n---\n\nMy wife and I had an interesting conversation about why things are served in a deli. Whether the owners of deli's know it or not there is a reason for what is on the table and what is served as sides. It all has to do with how they make the meal taste. Why are there pickles on the table at a deli? Simple, to cleanse your palette and open your taste buds to the spices to come. Why are all the side on a deli plate kind of creamy? Also simple, to knock out any strong spices in your mouth. It is almost the same idea when you eat Q actually. So, a bite of pickle, a bite of the sandwich and then a bite of the slaw (repeat) creates a great way of maintaining a great tasting meal instead of having the strong pepper (piper nigrum) of a good pastrami sandwich blow out your taste buds. These are Food 101 concepts, but it is surprising how few people understand them and apply them. It is easier to copy a menu than to grok it."

Owned by husband and wife team, he cooks and she's awesome with the customers. The staff knows the menu and they are great about substituting items... Fruit instead of potatoes. I usually get the veggie Benedict. Just the right amount of sauce without drowning. Choice of different bagels. My daughter loves the French toast. Fluffy with just the right amount of powdered sugar. Also great is the turkey Reuben, turkey philly. For the sides ask for the cole slaw."

            "review": "We were told about this restaurant by an aquaintance, so decided to give it a try.   We went there today on Sunday.   We were seated and then looked at the menus.  I notice a Bible Quote on the Dry Erase board. The waitress was pleasant, and we ordered something to drink, and looked at the menus.    I had the French Dip, and we also ordered two Hamburgers.   They use a pretzle bread for all the Hamburgers, which we were not so crazy about.   Also, they don't serve fries, and I was craving some, so instead ordered the Hashbrowns.   The French Dip was delicious, and the Au Jus was also pretty good.  I would have liked the Au Jus a little stronger but it was not bad.   They use provolone cheese in their French Dips, and that tasted pretty good.  The Hamburgers with bacon were very tasty.   For three lunches, the tab came to $29.   The place was about 80% full all the while we were there.   We will be back for breakfast.   I do wish they had French Fries though which would have given them a 5 star rating."

They actually make most of their omelets with egg whites and great fresh adds not to mention they don't bathe their food in oil. The service was spectacularly friendly even though they were hella busy and seem to stay that way so you'd probably be safe to say you may wait a bit."

Coffee okay too. Good service. Nice find! It is a noisy place when so many people, and you do sit close to the next table. ...so if they are concerns, this place may not work for you...instead, eat quickly and be off...I think you'll be happy with your breakfast!"

It has a really comfortable feel with all the positive decorations all around. There's also a few outside dining seats that are nice especially on overcast days--not so much the scorching hot Las Vegas summer days--but when they're packed, it's worth it!

The food is made from scratch and you can tell! The servers are always friendly and well kept. I think they need a bigger location they are always full of diners inside and out. My husband loves the cordbeef hash he said it's the best in vegas, I always get the jacob's slammin platter, the price is cheap compared to all the food you get. The potatoes are nothing you have ever had anywhere! I always get a bagel for my bread choice with spread. I am yet to finish all my food because you get some much! This is hands down my favorite breakfast spot! I bought a discount card from my kids school so last year they had discount buy one get one 50% off, Iove a place that helps out it's schools and provides great food and svc. Its also dog friendly if yo want to eat outside with your pet not sure if they are allowed indoors"

Filed with wonderful suggestions and really attentive in a busy restaurant.   \n\nI'm cheap so the prices were a little high at first.   But the portion sizes, flavor, and atmosphere really make up for it.   \n\nWe had the LEO sandwich,  a banana pancakes,  a bagel and the snow caps for breakfast.   Everything was delicious! \n\nFor lunch we had the kids pizza,  Cajun Benedict,  hamtastic sandwich,  the French dip with prime rib, and the pumpkin cream cheese cake.   Again a home run.   We prefer the mac salad to the potato salad but both are yummy.   The French dip is a little salty with the aus jus but most and flavorful without.  The pesto on the ham sandwich took it over the top yummy!   And the kids scarfs down the dessert. \n\nI probably wouldn't go out of the way to get here as the lines can be long and the bathrooms are one holers, but when in in the area,  I'll definitely be back."

The house dressing is a sweet honey mustard which was very generic and nothing to make it stand out for something that  was made in house. \n\nThe omelette was  ok. Cheap and diner style.

The food was tasty and huge portions. I had the pastrami omelet and I ordered the hash browns extra crispy and substituted the toast for bananas. The omelet was amazing. There was an explosion of my favorite flavors happening in my mouth. The grilled onions, the pastrami, and oh the Swiss cheese together was out of this world. And to boot, it's just around the corner from my home. So I will be introducing others to this place for breakfast meetings and lunch. Gotta try this place. But come early as they are always busy."

I started the meal asking for a cup of coffee only to have burnt coffee presented to me that not even 8 sugars could remove the awful aftertaste. That twas the first sign something was wrong. My server Tiffany tried to tell me that it was a strong coffee. Cuban coffee is strong coffee, this was weak and burnt in effigy.  When it came time to order I asked for the corn beef hash and eggs over medium with a side bagel with cream cheese. The only thing edible of that meal was the bagel and I suspect that was because the cook missed it with his flamethrower.  The corn beef was non existent and resembled the smattering of the crumbled bacon they couldn't find anything else to do with and heavily burnt potatoes, the eggs were just as bad as they were over cooked rubbery disks. \n\nOn a positive note they did offer to take it off my check or replace it with food cooked by the owner but by that point my appetite was gone and my party had finished their meal with much the same disdain. Kudos to them trying to fix the problem after the fact and the waiter not checking the table til after our meal was done.\n\nI'm sure there are a lot of fans of this place but I am not one nor will I be coming back to it again."

I ordered a FUZE drink and a power wrap on whole wheat, Chicken, egg whites, salsa, and Swiss cheese. SO YUMMY!! I did get the potatoes instead of fruit, (I have to be a little bad right??) It was under ten dollars and they have super nice staff, a bright room that needs big sunglasses if your there for a weekend brunch and amazing healthy food!!\nI'm hooked and will be there weekly! Thank you!!!"

We were there on a Thursday at about ten AM. The place was busy but we were seated almost immediately. The menu had a lot of choices for a place that's only open for breakfast and lunch. i ordered the eggs Benedict. The price was at least three dollars cheaper than the same dish where I live. Our water glass was immediately filled and it was filled, without asking, the whole time we were there. The same is true for the coffee. Along with the eggs, they served potatoes with onions. They were some of the best that I have ever tasted. The eggs were delicious. They were completely covered with sauce. In most restaurants I'm lucky if I get a spoonful! Our waiter, Jeff, was super friendly and very attentive. Now this is a real treat. I hate to say it but most of the wait staff in local restaurants here are rude or in an extreme hurry to get you out. Several other people came by to see how we were doing. There is no doubt that I will stop by here on my next trip to Vegas. If you're from California the land of the almighty dollar, you're in for a treat. By the way the restroom was spotless. I checked the grout. There wasn't a spot anywhere!"

They specialize in just breakfast.  You can pretty much find all types of breakfast items at Sunrise Caf\u00e9.  Their menu consist of eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, French toast, sandwiches, wraps, Benedicts, oatmeal, and even burgers.  My go-to meal is the Jacob's Slammin' Platter for $8.99 (eggs, silver dollar pancakes, bacon, Canadian bacon, sausage, potatoes, and choice of bread).  You really can't go wrong with that order.  Lately, I've been keeping it simple with a BYO Omelet for $8.99 or just 8 eggs with bacon.  \"The Lighter Side of Guilt\" is also on their menu, which is their healthier portions and lower calorie meals.  But who has time for that.  I have no complaints with the food.  The prices are great and the service has always been excellent. \n\n \n\nTIP #1:  $2 upcharge for egg whites.\n\nTIP #2:  MAKE IT A MONSTER for an additional $3.25. They'll hook up the omelets.\n\nTIP #3:  2 stars for the parking.\n\nTIP #4:  This place can get really busy during the weekend mornings.  But it's perfect during lunch in the middle of the week.\n\nTIP #5:  Country Potatoes Extra Crispy!!\n\nTIP #6:  Try the Snow Caps (buttered fried bagel bites covered with cinnamon sugar). YOLO!\n\n \n\n2017 Yelp Review #32"

While driving around the Green Valley area for work a few days ago, Cesar Q and I stopped in for a quick bite.  \n\nThe place was jam packed but we were seated immediately.  The server came by and asked for our drink order.  Within minutes she was back and we ordered our meal.  In less than 10 monitors our meal was served!  WOW! That's fast!  I'd seen other Yelp pic's of their notorious breakfast potatoes so of course I had to order something that came with these little babies.  So glad I did because they lived up to their hype!  So so good!  I think I would come back and order a plate of potatoes and that's is, they are that good!  I did order the build your own omelet and it was just ok. Nothing special but nothing wrong with it either.  I liked that you could have avocado at no extra cost but I didn't like that they were not very generous with the serving.  Personal opinion maybe.  Cesar Q isn't a breakfast guy so he tried their lunch and said he liked it.\n\nLocation is great as it's just off the 215 at Eastern.  Parking wasn't an issue as this place sits in a strip mall like setting.\n\nI would recommend this place if you are out and about and want to try some killer potatoes!!"

            "review": "As much as it pains me to write a POOR review, I truly feel this one is very well deserved. I met with friends here for breakfast expecting to have a relaxing morning filled with great food and company, instead what our group received was quite the opposite. Upon reviewing the menu I was a bit stumped as to why most all of the omelettes were $13. bucks a piece. Since I had never been here before I figured these were going to be big, fluffy and loaded omelettes like the one's at Original Pancake...I couldn't wait! After we ordered from an absolutely no personality waiter, we quite literally NEVER saw him again for the entire meal. In fact the entire experience from that point became without service and quite SELF SERVICE! \n\nNow on to the food...The pastrami omelette was essentially and empty, flat, two egg piece of misery filled with absolutely nothing but nasty grilled onions. Pastrami? What pastrami? The Caesar salad was small, contained too much dressing, very little LOW QUALITY lettuce and had NO love put into it's preparation. Back to the service, they took my bagel away to put cream cheese on it as I had ordered it and never came back. No waiter to tell, no drink refills once ever during the meal. I actually had to get up and go over to the front counter to ask for my bagel, some ketchup, drink refills and to let them know of the disappearance of our waiter. They acted with very little concern, but did finally bring the things I had asked for. Bagel arrived 3/4's of the way through my crappy omelette. My other guests food was prepared with Slop Shop style and the chefs (I mean guys off the street) were obviously preparing food as if they were making food for their dorm buddies. \n\nOverpriced crappy food (BTW - Menu pics on here are 30% less than current prices).  Absolutely non-caring service staff (Might have been better off in an old folks home cafeteria). Chefs that aren't actually chefs, rather Slop Shop egg flingers. And finally, NO SERVICE, and I mean \u00d1ONE once waiter took the order.\n\nI truly cannot believe the Overrated Hype and reviews this place has received! Is it that so many people have just come to expect mediocre at best service, food and high prices due to their food inexperience? Could it be that the patrons of this establishment no nothing of good food, good service and value? Or has everyone just come to expect third-world quality in this day and age here in Vegas? I'm sooooo conflicted about these questions. I wish people were more accurate when describing their experiences through this format. If so, I would have NEVER wasted my time here.\n\nIf you want real breakfast in Vegas, go to Weiss Deli, Original Pancake, or even any casino coffee shop. This terrible food is a direct reflection of customers willingly allowing such an establishment to continue to succeed. Folks...Please complain on the spot about crappy food, bad service and overpriced garbage. I have no issues paying dearly for excellent quality food, but honestly an Egg McMuffin would have much better satisfied my breakfast desires than this place! Sunrise Cafe - Good Luck To You!"

I've heard of Sunrise Cafe from a few people and we thought we'd pay them a visit. \n\nIt was quite busy and people were waiting for tables outside. We wanted take-out so went straight to the cashier to order our food. I got the Garden of Eden omelette. It was an egg white omelette with mushrooms, black olives, red and green bellpeppers, and had avocado, alfalfa sprouts and pepper jack cheese to top it off. I thought it was very delicious. Never had black olives in an omelette before and it was good! I'm pretty olive crazy.. so I'd eat it with anything to be honest. It also came with potatoes, and wheat toast. My boyfriend got some roast beef dip sandwich with coleslaw. He initially said it looked small, which it did, but was actually pretty packed with meat. I didn't try it but it didn't look that great. \n\nWorkers were friendly. The lady asked if we wanted water while we waited. We didn't really wait too long. Less than 10 mins and we were on our way.\n\nIt sucks that breakfast is soooo expensive when you eat out. Sunrise Cafe & The Griddle are all like $9 for breakfast.. I sometimes don't even eat lunch for that price. OH well. Overall, the food and service is good. I will definitely return, but probably won't be returning back too often. I'll come back next time I have family or friends in and looking for a good place to eat some grub in the early AM."

Not being a fan of counter dining, I asked for a small table instead, so I was whisked to a small two-seater next to a sunny window. Not 5 seconds after sitting down, I got a fast-talking waiter who asked if I was ready to order. The diner was at half capacity customer-wise, so I was a little confused by the fast \"New York\" pace that I was experiencing. Feeling a little rushed at this point, I quickly picked the \"Jacob's Slammin' Jam\" or something like that - plenty of protein and carbs. Waiter quickly returned with coffee and water, much appreciated. Coffee tasted burned. Needed the caffeine, so I just drank it. for breakfast, potatoes loaded with grease and toast was already cold with butter re-solidifying on the bread. The meal tasted (eggs and meat) fine, but I felt rushed and the food wasn't anything to write home about.  If you're into a rushed \"New York\" vibe and don't care much about quality of food, this is a great place. Otherwise, there are plenty of better places to try. Three stars because the waiter slowed down long enough after paying the check to be polite and ask if things were ok and offered more coffee (but not water, which never got refilled)."

The eggs are always cooked exactly as ordered. It's not rocket science but it does seem to be a lot to ask in many restaurants to get your eggs as ordered, but that's not the case here.

I docked one star because I noticed a sign on my table saying there was going to be an additional $1.25 surcharge to any menu item that had egg whites due to a \"national egg shortage\" and this surcharge would apply to all menu items that have egg whites only.

It's nothing special, i would much rather go to the Starbucks in the shopping center and then come have breakfast.  In my opinion, the coffee you serve at a breakfast joint is pretty important.  \n\nDespite the coffee, this is my FAVORITE breakfast joint!  They need to add another location in the Southwest area!!"

It's a cutesy spot that serves breakfast, wraps, sammiches, smoothie bar, and stuff.  \n\nWe all ordered their iced tea since my friends insist they have really good Tropical Iced Tea, and sure enough they were right.  I'm not a big fan of iced tea, so its remarkable that i was able to take another sip or in this case a refill.\n\nFor my meal I built an egg white omelet (99cent to sub egg white) with turkey, ham, and cheddar. It cames with hash brown and with choice of bread, but i skipped the bread because i knew i was going to order the Blueberry Pancake once it popped up as i skimmed through the menu. Sadly, the Blueberry Pancake was huge disappointment since my recent discovery http://www.yelp.com/biz/m-and-m-donuts-anaheim#hrid:cm5Iy1u9yABwimWy3pM5SQ. I was expecting that the berries would at least be infused in the with the pancake batter but they were just a regular pancakes made with blueberries toss in it.  Weak!  Oh, and my turkey in my omelet were big cube chunks of turkey similar to deli meat.  \n\nTheir stripped hash browns however were amazing. I'm a sucker for any stripped hash and OSC does their well. Each strips were cooked just right with a subtle yet hint of a distinctive flavor. I mean i could be the only one but the nip was so minute that i think they cook it in a meat flavor oil or something.  It was delish!\n\n\nOverall I left the place and felt pretty good and not have over the top disgusting brekkie feeling. 3.5\n\n*TIP*  Dog friendly outdoor sitting area with dog treats available."

I, being the faithful Yelper that I am, looked for a good spot to try since our favorites are near us in SW Las Vegas. The Original Sunrise Cafe is a solid place and got the job done. They were very busy but still managed to get out food out  quickly and be attentive to our needs throughout the meal. The menu selections are pretty standard for breakfast with some spins on classic items like their \"Bueno\" and \"Brooklyn\" eggs benedict. I ordered the \"Garden of Eden\" omelet, and thought it was decent, it needed some love...or maybe just salt. I really liked the potatoes. They were shredded, but in a wider form than I've seen before, and yummy. My partner in crime got the corn beef hash and ate the whole thing. So, I say give it a try and you probably will not be disappointed; but, I think I'll save the gas next time I want breakfast and go somewhere closer to home."

It was so amazing. I was thoroughly impressed with the service, the food, and the large cup of coffee that my server kept hot. The meal came with delicious taters, and a bagel too. I usually never finish a whole breakfast, but I couldn't resist finishing this one. It was the best breakfast I have had in a really long time.

I love their friendly service, menu options and absolutely love the fact that I can pay $1.50 to substitute 2 pieces (1 slice of Texas toast cut into two pieces) of French toast for my toast/bagel. I normally go to Egg Works (which I also enjoy and dine often) but Sunrise Cafe definitely beats Egg Works when it comes to potatoes!! Sunrise has crispy on the outside, soft and hot on the inside hash browns that are made with love and cooked to perfection. Brandon is an awesome waiter and he is incredibly helpful when it comes to menu suggestions. I've tried the breakfast plate with the silver dollar pancakes and the big Greek omelette and I've enjoyed them both. My mom ordered the Garden of Eden omelette and by the looks of her completely empty plate, I know she enjoyed it. Also, the person who cooked my bacon deserves a hug. It was crispy just how I like it, the Canadian bacon was delicious and I really enjoyed their sausage patties. I usually don't order meals with a ton of meat included in them but Sam's breakfast platter (I think that's the name) had great portion sizes that weren't overwhelming. I definitely looking forward to going back, I live in Summerlin and they're totally worth the drive!!"

Certainly not the worst Eggs Benedict I've ever had, but assuredly the most bland.  The bagel vs English Muffin wasn't a thing - the bagel was actually the best part.  The Hollandaise was utterly tasteless, which kinda negates the whole point of the dish.  My husband's Pastrami omelet was very salty, and the filling was all at one end, so not a terribly satisfying omelet experience.  The \"well done\" potatoes were bland and a little greasy.\n\nThe half order of french toast was tasty - but that's the thinnest, softest Texas Toast I've ever seen.  Perfect levels of cinnamon though.  I've certainly had worse.\n\nI guess that should be the title of this review \"We've had worse....\" which isn't much to recommend about a place."

This being my first review I notice that the lowest star it will allow me to put is a one star.. After my experience I would put 0 STARS if I could. A week ago from today I came in with two of my friends for breakfast midway through our meal I bit down into a ROCK.. Yes, a ROCK in my food. After biting down on it and chipping my molar.. I was in shock and notified my server. My server told me that he would grab the Manager which is proper protocol in situations like this. So the manager comes to the table and from the start approached the situation with a mild attitude \" I talked to the chef and he said there was and is NO WAY that could have got in your food\" insinuating as if I were lying. Then she proceeded to tell me \"Well I'm sorry about that but there is nothing I can do\" after a few seconds of standing there awkwardly shrugging like she didn't know what to tell us, she took the rock and walked away. We were all stunned. Not sure what kind of experience she has as a manager but that is an inexcusable way for you treat any customer that just broke a tooth (which is now constantly sensitive) on a rock that was in their food in their establishment. We all immediately stopped eating (not even halfway through finishing our meals), paid our bill, and left upset. I hope they sharpen up their customer service, and something like this never happens to another paying customer ever again."

For some, like myself, you don't want to give up your buttered toast and potatoes for a side of pancakes. With the platter, you get it all! Yay! I often want just a few bites of yummy pancakes and not an entire sugar loaded breakfast. Sunrise gives you 4 perfect little silver dollar pancakes to curb your sweet cravings without sending you into an AM diabetic coma! \nOther winners include the omelets with tasty additions such as creamy garlic sauce and sliced avocado. Corned beef hash is good stuff as well. \nAll in all, a 5 star breakfast you'll return to over and over again."

An open-faced bagel with jalapeno bacon, pepper jack cheese, two eggs and a spicy hollandaise sauce, this meal is amazing and really has a great kick of heat.

Very typical... Nothing special.  I would not rave about the place, or go out of my way to eat there... If it is convenient, it is ok... That's it.  I would rate it a notch below Cracker Barrel in terms of food quality, value and service."

The food here has always been amazing, and anyone I take there is delighted as well. I have been here a plethora of times and never had one complaint. \n\nIf you do happen to go on a Saturday or Sunday (Especially Sunday) morning, be prepared to wait ~15-20 minutes.

People are usually considerate though, and if the place is packed, customers eat and go so others can sit!"

The sliced option would make it easier to cut without having to worry about escaping chunks of turkey. The hollandaise almost took over the flavors of the other ingredients but either way it was awesome."

They were good, but all the blueberriers were right in the center of the pancakes [in the batter, of course]. Not what I expected nor cared for. I'd prefer to have them spread out evenly. However, they were still appetizing.\n\nGood food at a decent price so I would go back."

I ordered the bagel with lox platter which was simple, yet full of flavor: a toasted bagel spread with cream cheese, a light layer of lox, topped with tomato slices, sliced red onion, and sprinkled with capers.  The lox was good quality but not in large quantity; the capers added a nice brininess, and red onion complimented the dish. The least appealing aspect was the tomatoes which were slightly mushy and not super flavorful.  The dish came with a side of skillet grilled potatoes which were good even though under-seasoned.  The others in my party had the classic breakfast with bacon, eggs, toast, and potatoes and their only complaint was that their eggs weren't cooked as ordered, but good nonetheless.  Overall a good experience that we would try again."

There were a lot of people waiting in front of us, and I thought we were in for a long wait, but the hostess asked us if we were ok with counter seating, and we were, so we literally glanced at the menu and our name was called.  Counter seating is a bit tight if you're a bigger person, just FYI.\n\nWe had a craving for eggs Benedict, but noticed this place does it on bagels, not English muffins. This was almost a deal breaker,but I'm glad we didn't leave and just stuck around and ate here. We ended up getting the LEO sandwich on a kaiser roll. LEO is lox,egg, onion. The lox is lightly cooked, so it doesn't have the regular raw texture to it like I'm used to. But this was good. It was perfectly cooked so it was soft still, the eggs fluffy, and the onions translucent but not caramelized. IMO perfect. The kaiser roll was topped with poppy seeds and very soft as well, and the cream cheese was generous. The potatoes it came with were better than the Doritos flavored ones from Egg and I. These were more like hash browns, and were really good with the lime and chili Franks Redhot sauce they have there.\n\nWe also got the prime rib eggs beni. It's on a roll also, with thinly cut prime rib, with grilled onions, cheese, and scrambled egg topped with hollandaise sauce. It's like a Philly cheese steak with egg.  Very good! The beef was very tender, and I didn't see any traces of fat. This also came with potatoes, but you can also opt for fruit, I think bananas.\n\nService like I said was so fast it shocked me. From the time we entered till we got our food was probably no more than 15 mins. Coffee was refilled quickly too. People do tend to camp out here even after they are done eating, but the staff still refill their coffee and don't rush people out. Personally I hate when people do that, ESP if there are a lot of people waiting, i think its rude. But we scarfed down our food and were happily on our way.\n\nThe only reason this place didn't get five stars from me is its a bit on the pricey side for breakfast. Hopefully I can come back sometime soon and try lunch. Btw they are only open until 3pm."

I promptly forgot about it and then saw it again a few days ago and decided that I needed to give it a try. \n\nMy husband I arrived at the prime breakfast time. Prime breakfast time is apparently 10:30 a.m. for those that are wondering. We got on the waiting list and were told it'd be about 25 minutes. It ended up taking this long, but was worth the wait. \n\nI had the Cajun Prime Rib Beni. This was a delicious combination of Texas Toast, prime rib, onions, mushrooms, and hollandaise sauce. Yum. The meat was delicious and sliced thin which was the perfect consistency for a dish like this. There was also Cajun seasoning on top that really added to the dish without overwhelming it. I also loved the hashbrowns served on the side and found that ketchup was unnecessary. \n\nMy husband had the Steak & Egg Wrap. It was tasty, but definitely not the most exciting thing on the menu. My husband loved it. \n\nThe service was friendly and efficient. Our waitress took good care of us and didn't leave us wondering where she was at any point. Her other table was a group of 20 and she still gave us great service."

Sunrise Caf\u00e9 is a bustling little caf\u00e9 in a convenient location, right off the highway. And next to a Starbucks, a bonus in my book. \n\nHuge selection so get to reading when you sit and with breakfast choices as good as the lunch choices, you'll have to deal with a battle within yourself regarding which meal to show some love. I absolutely love the Glenn Wrap, mainly because I have a severe Frank's Red Hot addiction that governs my ordering patterns just about everywhere I go. I love their hash browns too, not greasy or too seasoned, just right. For lunch I've made sweet food love to the Reuben and was not disappointed. \n\nThe staff is super friendly and you can chill at the counter seating or choose from a table or booth. You can even sit outside if the weather is to your liking. Bring Fido or Rover along, they provide dog treats and water for their canine customers. If you're hitting this place up on a weekend be prepared for a little wait. Check out the shelves as you walk in, they've got some pretty cool old school candy. Who doesn't need some Big League Chew in their life? \n\nI could spend the rest of my life eating at places in this shopping center, for realz. Go support a local business and enjoy Sunrise Caf\u00e9."

It's located right next to a Starbucks, so we grabbed coffee and chatted while we waited to be called, which was sooner than we thought.\n\nI'd say for both of us first timers, we were blown out of the water. Not only was our waiter friendly, but the service was fast and the food was delicious. Eggs Benedict on a bagel!?! Genius. My mouth was in heaven! Aaron enjoyed his French toast too! Anytime I find myself in Henderson in the morning, this will definitely be my go-to spot from now on."

We got the patty melt and the eggs and hash dish. Both were large portions and delicious. I really liked the vibe of this place too, very inviting and open, bright colors.

Never, ever will I eat at IHOP, or Denny's again.

I kept my order pretty basic as I don't eat pancakes, bagels, or any of the other breakfast goodies... but I can say that the menu options looked AWESOME.  Buffalo chicken omelet with blue cheese?  Are you kidding me?  Can I roll up inside and eat my way out?  I opted for a build-your-own with steak, avocado, and jalapenos.  Jalapenos.  The only time I've seen jalapenos as an option for something is pizza.  And now they are in my omelet... and they are good!  I would love to come back and try one of the menu omelet creations - I can't imagine anything tasting bad here.  Another big plus - the giant box of hot tea selections!  Its so nice to see options for tea, especially at breakfast.  +one star JUST for the tea!  Next time I'm in the area, I will make effort to get back here for breakfast.  Prices, service, atmosphere - all a nice change of pace from the LV Strip."

I'm not making an excuse for them and maybe they need to improve staffing on the weekends, but I believe you as customer should also speak up, instead of sitting there pissed off. Let yourself be heard, those guys running around are there for you...flag them down-you're allowed that. As a business i'm sure they are open to constructive criticism. \n\nYou can't miss the place. They are on Eastern across from Moon Nursery. They are in the same lot as Yogurtland,  LVAC, Pho Saigon, and Starbucks. Plus you will see their bright orange SUNRISE on the building.\n\nThe inside is big and clean. They have inside and outside seatings. If you have a large party, just call ahead and they will accommodate you. There is also have a breakfast bar towards the back of the restaurant if you don't want to sit at a table.\n\nWe wished that they would open earlier but their hours are 7am to 3pm everyday. We come here so much that we don't look at the menu. We get seated and just order...it makes it easier for our server. We order the Traditional Sunrise with eggs & canadian bacon. Its a Sourdough french toast with banana's, maple syrup, & granola- It's ONO! They also have good fluffy blueberry pancakes. The banana cream pie pancakes are disgustingly good...it's a big order, enough to share with someone. The kids go for the ham and cheese omelette- it is what it is and the kids love it. If it wasn't good, trust me, they would say so. I've had the Dave-zilla- egg whites, spinach, sausage, & cheese. It's enough to fill you up without weighing you down. And when Im watching my girlish figure (usually before the winter holiday parties) I order it w/out cheese. We've also tried the Power Wrap-grilled chix, egg whites, & salsa, and the steak and egg wrap, both are very good. They also have salads (you can create your own), all kinds of wraps (breakfast, lunch, and healthy), burgers, and specialty sandwiches. They serve Shangri La iced T which is always a plus for us...the common lipton iced tea is nasty. You can also buy the Tea from them, as well as other stuff like, candy, protein shakes, and other drinks that they sell in their drinks display.\n\nWe haven't gone their for anything but breakfast but you could order lunch items anytime. We'll have to try something from their lunch menu, but its tough because I love breakfast food!"

Which makes sense because the food is good, but it's nice because there's always plenty of seating to wait for your table. Not to mention, the tables are turned over quickly and even when you have to wait, its never too long of a wait. \nMy favorite is the corn beef hash and my girls favorite is the Veggie Benny. They're both delicious and I love the fact that you get a bagel with each! Another thing that I like about this restaurant is the service. Its consistently good. Probably my favorite  servers are Amy & Micheal, he's a great guy and is always on it.  I recognized him when I saw he went from the Starbucks next door, to here.\nI also love the fact that this is a family establishment. The owners are always there and working hard on the weekends and its a big reason why I come here as often as I do. Overall, it's a solid restaurant that I love to support because of its great food, great service, and family atmosphere."

It's a good spot to sit, relax, eat a tasty breakfast and people watch. It's not uncommon for someone to bring there dog and eat outside. Not the best place if you are in a hurry or want solitude."

Today I ordered the Fiesta Benedict, and shared it with my 9 year old son. It was very tasty, great flavor and half an order was a perfect amount,  it just didn't really do it for me, I guess I'm not really into sauce on top.

Very simple ingredients and each bite had the right amount of everything so  I didn't get a mouthful of salsa followed by a hunk of cheese, everything in every bite as a wrap should be. Their house style potatoes were perfectly cooked, mostly tender pieces and a few nice crunches pieces. No exotic overwhelming spices, just the taste of the food, like a good home cooked meal - appropriate for a family diner style restaurant like this. \nI was more than just pleased with the music they had playing, I was overjoyed.

For a place with many healthy options, this is a behemoth of a breakfast:  eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, canadian bacon, silver dollar pancakes, and a bread (I always choose the everything bagel toasted).  80% of the time I order this, the other 20% I get the crispy creamy wrap, an egg/bacon/cream cheese wrap.  Again served with their potatoes, which are fantastic when ordered extra crispy.  My wife typically gets Chester's Way, their corned beef hash dish.  This is another huge meal, we always take some home even with me helping...\n\nI would arrive earlier in the day if possible, the wait can get long at high peak times on the weekend due to its popularity.  Also, they do run out of bread choices, which we found out the hard way a few times.  During nice weather, sitting outside on the patio can be fun, but it's RIGHT by the parking lot.  So, car noise/exhaust can be an issue. Dogs are welcome on the patio.\n\nService is fantastic.  They have a lot of servers that have been there for years, which I think is indicative of how they run the business.\n\nBe advised it's good for kids, but no changing table in the bathrooms."

It was all delicious and cooked really well. The bacon was amazing.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the ranchero wrap with the chipotle tortilla and hashbrowns.  He liked the wrap, but the hashbrowns definitely stole the show here. \n\nHis mom had the short stack pancake platter ($7.69 + $3.50) and grandma had the Garden of Eden omelette ($9.25).  They both loved the meals.\n\nThe service was a little slow.  It felt like forever before our waiter finally came to take our order.  At least he was friendly.  The man who actually brought out our food was great, making sure we had everything we needed.\n\nThe prices here are very reasonable.  The $3.50 it cost me to make my french toast a platter included two eggs and four pieces of bacon, which is more than what you usually get at other breakfast spots."

Corned beef hash was just right, and a generous portion to boot.\nMy DW enjoyed the French Toast, which was also a large portion with thick sliced bread. Very good flavor!"

            "review": "I'm a local, and I've had way better breakfasts at other restaurants. We arrived, and were told that there was a 25 minute wait for a table for 4. That's no biggie, as we've waited longer for tables before. The issue we had was when \"friends\" entered the establishment. Those people waited maybe 10 minutes for a table. We kept getting bumped. That did not bode well, and we sure hoped the food was worth the wait. Meh...it really wasn't. We ended up waiting close to 40 minutes for a table, and after being seated, there was confusion about exactly where we were to sit. So, we shuffled between two tables until someone made a decision and put us at a table. Brendan (Brandon?) our server was the highlight. He was very kind. We ordered the ultimate french toast, which was okay, but we've had better. The pb/jam french toast is pretty unique, and my child loved it. I had an omelet, which came with hash browns, and it was okay. I've had just as good elsewhere. We also ordered corned beef hash, and it tasted salty, according to my spouse, and I thought it tasted like the canned stuff we prepare at home. \n\nOverall, we expected a wait, as it was the weekend. However, the constant bumping of us down the seating priority (we counted probably 4-5 times we were bumped) was really the deal breaker. \n\nIf you want a super good breakfast, go to the Beach Cafe, which is off Jones, in Las Vegas. Egg Works are good. Rise and Shine is good. Bite in Summerlin is good. Lots of places are good in Las Vegas and Henderson. We won't be back here because we apparently don't know anybody there to get seated in a timely fashion. This was a one and done for us."

Given the full house on a week day I figured it must be at least decent! ;)  It's just a regular diner on the inside but really bright and alive! I ordered the Bueno Beni, which is basically an spicy eggs benedict on an open bagel. I asked for the Hollandaise to be on the side as it's usually too much (good call by me!).  I though the dish was flavorable and had a kick, which was what I was looking for. I poured a little of the Hollandaise over it but nothing near what it could have been. Supposedly they are known for their bagels and the bagel was super and very fresh so that's good to know for the future. \n\nGood breakfast option if you're in the area."

Yes, he was!\n\nThe place was very busy when I got here about 10 AM on a Tuesday morning.  The hostess asked me if I wanted a table and I asked if they had a counter.  They do and she took me there immediately.  The counter area was relatively empty.  From where I sat, it  looked like the place was once a pizza joint because of the oven along the wall there.\n\nRegardless, I was given a menu and brought a mug of coffee very quickly.  I then checked out the pancake/waffle section but they all seemed like they'd be larger breakfasts that I wanted to get.\n\nI settled on the Brooklyn Benedict which consists of two basted eggs on an open faced bagel with turkey cubes, spinach, and melted Swiss cheese all topped with Hollandaise.  It was excellent!  You are given a choice of bagel and I opted for the sesame bagel.  The combination of flavors--the turkey, Swiss cheese, and spinach--was wonderful!  The bene also came with potatoes.  I could have had fruit but why spoil a good breakfast?\n\nCoffee was refilled often and I was asked if I wanted a cup to go at no charge.  The staff was very accommodating and service was top notch.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to return for breakfast here.  It is very good and they have a large variety of breakfast dishes."

More than half of their omelet choices are made with egg whites.   It has a homemade light, clean taste with no frills.  Their bread, biscuits and muffins are not homemade, which was a little bit of a disappointment.  The jam is just the little prepackaged stuff.  \n\nIt's a nice neighborhood restaurant, but with nothing really drawing me here, I probably wouldn't make the drive to Henderson just to eat here."

It immediately assumed the food would be good. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty unique. There's a standard open seating area, a bar area and in various places you can find nostalgic items for sale. We were seated right away. The menu features a variety of breakfast and lunch specialities - I opted for breakfast and chose Jacob's platter. It didn't take very long for our food to come out. Everything was hot and good, especially the potatoes. I would be completely content with a plate of cheese potatoes. I did taste their homemade turkey sausage, which is pretty awesome. They were pretty successful in making turkey taste just as good as pork - actually better. \n\nService was excellent and prices were great. If you have the Entertainment Book, you there's a BOGO 50% coupon. I'd return."

The staff was incredibly friendly, the portions were large, but not to large to take some home, and the environment was very welcoming. \nI've had bad experiences with eggs Benedict in the past, but this plate was a winner. Brooklyn Benedict is a great choice if you don't like spicy things!! My brother got the sin-o-man pancakes, which he finished off with a smile. \nIf you are in the Vegas area or heading to the airport looking for something unique, and not too crowded, please go here!

The Original Sunrise Cafe had very high/good reviews, I knew I found our place. Boy am I so glad I did. The customer service is top notch. Our waiter kept us laughing, our coffee and water were never left empty, and he told us about the freshly made bagels. We told him it was our first time there and we were excited. A few minutes later the manager came over to talk to us. That is so rare these days and it was very much appreciated. My friend and I each ordered a \"Create Your Own Omelette\" I got turkey, avocado and american cheese. With a sesame bagel. When our orders came out the omelette was huge!! It was fluffy and the ingredients were very fresh. I definitely couldn't finish it, even though it was so good, I wanted to. The bagel was also very yummy. I was so full I took half the bagel home. Can't forget the homemade potatoes, which reminded me of the ones my grandma use to make. Overall it was a very wonderful experience and I can't wait to bring my family."

It was pretty packed, but we lucked out and got seated at the bar. Sometimes bars like that can be a squished situation, but there was plenty of room. \n\nSunrise Cafe's menu is large and everything sounded excellent. I was torn between one of the Benedict's and the Lox Platter. Since Jamie decided on the Fiesta Benedict I picked the Lox Platter. \n\nOur server was very attentive and offered many refills to Jamie on her coffee. The food came out very quickly. Jamie and I shared our meal. My Lox Platter came with a sesame bagel. It had cream cheese, lots of Lox, tomatoes, onions, and capers. Plus, home style hash browns had onions mixed in, but they lacked seasoning. Jamie's Fiesta Benedict was covered in Hollandaise sauce and piled on an everything bagel. I loved that it had a tad of spice to it without burning your mouth. Plus, it had lots of crispy bacon. Yay! \n\nI can't wait to bring my husband to this place. Next time I think I'll try the Prime Rib Benedict!"

            "review": "The waits are long because the hype is true. I've only been here once so have not tried too much on their menu, but everything i did experience was five stars. \n\nFirstly... the food: The Bueno Beni was great. The eggs were perfectly done and the spiciness added with the salsa and fresh jalepenos was a great twist on your normal eggs beni. would certainly get this again. The wife got some sort of healthy omelette which seemed good, but she's a breakfast rookie and hence doesn't understand that the meal is all about maximizing grease, butter and hollandaise. But you can do that if it's your thing. Looked good. \n\nSecond... service: What you'd hope for for breakfast. Quick. Not in your face... more just to facilitate you getting in and out and keep your coffee and water full. We sat at the counter, which was a little cramped, but was the quickest way to get a seat.  Overheard a couple next to us which sent back a meal for a reason that was completely not the fault of the server/restaurant, and he dealt with it very professionally... it reminded me of why i'm not cut out for food service.\n\nThird.... price: very reasonable. You're far away enough from the strip that you dont have to deal with the whole 3,000% markup thing. \n\nHighly recommend. For the money, it's one of the best breakfast spots in town."

The comparison to the Hash House A Go-Go, one of our favorite breakfast joints in town, really had our juices flowing. The Garden of Eden omelet sounded enticing to my girlfriend and the Pretzel Sunrise Burger is one of those interesting menu items that I just can't keep from ordering.\n\nI'm sad to report that The Original Sunrise Cafe did not live up to the expectation. We arrived just before 9 am on a Saturday and there were still a few tables open, so we didn't have to wait. The hostess was very pleasant and put us in a decent table. The menu was varied and as original as a breakfast menu can get. Our food was prepared very quickly and brought to us without delay. That's the good part.\n\nTo begin with, our waiter didn't seem like he wanted to be there. He was not rude to us, but it seemed that whatever he was doing the night before was interrupted by this work-thing that he had to get up for. \n\nThe Garden of Eden omelet was mediocre. The eggs were fully cooked but the veggies weren't drained very well and this resulted in a watery substance that oozed onto the whole plate. This made the texture of the omelet less than desirable. While my GF was happy that she had the option of fruit instead of a starch, it certainly didn't seem to be freshly prepared. It more seemed that they picked up a fruit bowl at Smiths or Vons and used that. Her bagel was fine, but it was a plain sesame bagel and there wasn't much of a choice. The bagels at The Cracked Egg are better, of a more firm texture, not the lighter bready kind.\n\nMy Sunrise Pretzel Burger was a disappointment. I LOVE soft pretzels and really love sandwiches made on them. This was more of a bread that resembled a pretzel than actually being a big soft pretzel. The worst part, however, was the burger. Not only did it seem to be a prepared burger (where the restaurant receives it cooked and they basically reheat it), but it didn't seem to be all meat/beef. It was that fine texture indicitive of filler. I ate half and took half home, but I honestly don't know if I'll eat it as leftovers (I LOVE leftovers as much as I love pretzels!)\n\nThere is no comparison to the Hash House A Go-Go and if you are willing or able to drive over to that part of the town it is well worth the effort. For a better alternative closer to this place, I'd recommend the Cracked Egg on Green Valley just north of the 215."

            "review": "I enjoyed my breakfast here this past Sunday, suggested by the lovely Allison S. We got there around 10ish and it was busy, but there was no wait for 2 seats at the counter which we happily took. Our server was nice, he took our drink order then let us browse the menu. They have a big 2 sided menu with breakfast and lunch options. The menu was not too big, not too small, but justttt right. I hate when a menu is a bazillion pages long. One thing that I found odd was there was no side items on the menu for either lunch or dinner. I knew I wanted an egg breakfast, but I thought I might have also wanted pancakes and it would have been nice if there were a side option. \n\nAnyway we both ordered breakfast. My dining companion went with the bagel and lox platter which is essentially just a bagel with cream cheese, lox, and a few toppings. I was in the mood for eggs benedict and Sunrise had 6 different options for me to choose from. I was torn between the veggie benedict and the fiesta benedict, which I ultimately chose. It had jalapeno bacon, pepper jack cheese and eggs, smothered in a fiesta hollandaise on top of an everything bagel. Both meals came with potatoes that were okay, but I had to douse in ketchup and Frank's chili lime sauce for flavor.\n\nSo I've never had eggs benedict served on a bagel before, which you can choose your flavor by the way, and while it was good, it was hard to cut because the bagel was toasted. Sure I could have just shoved the whole thing in my mouth, but I was with company and didn't want to embarrass myself =P. I got to try Allison's bagel and lox, which was loaded up with capers, tomatoes and onions. It was good but something I eat often, and can make at home. I would probably come back here if I were in the area."

Always trending sweet over savory it was with gluttony followed by glee that I inquired about half-portions or short-stacks and informed that both could be accommodated it was a quartet that comprised my order, the signature \"Snow Caps\" of sliced bagels fried in butter under a dusting of cinnamon sugar soon delighting me in its simplicity as I watched the restaurant fill.  Ever gracious in service as java flowed free a pair of pancakes arrived next and although improved by creamy dulce de leche the cakes themselves lacked, a mistake thankfully not replicated in either of the French Toasts, The Ultimate a more traditional version with buttery bread soaked in toffee and caramel while the Homerun can best be described as a battered after-school snack griddled to soft and topped with fresh bananas plus grape jam - a concept as simple as the Snow Caps and every bit as worth getting out of bed early for."

My favorite healthy item is the power wrap with chicken, egg whites, and salsa in a wheat tortilla.  If you are looking for more traditional fare you can't go wrong with chesters way (their version of corned beef hash) or even just the classic with bacon (always crispy) and the buttery potatoes.  If you want a bit of everything go for Jacob's slammin platter.\n\n\nAs if the food wasn't enough to keep me coming back the service is top notch.  Very attentive and friendly.  Go there a few times and they start remembering your drink order.\n\nDon't be alarmed if the place is busy.  It may seem like it will take forever but they turn tables there very quickly and they'll bring around samples to taste too."

I thought to stop by here a couple of times since they open right after I get off of work, and they're on the way home. \n\nThey have an outdoor eating area, and this place does get fairly busy on the weekends. it is a cafe which revolves around a pet friendly, family environment. I think what I love about the place is that although they serve items that you can usually get from other cafe's, some of their items are different from other places.\n\nI have ordered the STEAK AND EGG WRAP for $8.29 and its huge! It comes with potatos on the side so you don't feel like you've spent so much on just the wrap. You also have the option of the TYPE of wrap you'd like. You can do wheat, chipotle, or sundried tomatoe. I usually get the Sundried. If you're a meat lover and all protien. Definitely get the Steak and Egg wrap. It's deliscious and does contain big chunks of steak slices so you feel satisfied.\n\nI've also tried the STEVIE T'S WRAP  which is also deliscious but expect it to be REALLY filling and sweet thanks to the pancake and maple syrup. It was a good wrap, but the sweetness and thickness of the wrap honestly doesn't satisfy my appetite. It just makes you feel like the wrap itself is filling up my stomach for the sake of it. BUT! Don't be discouraged. If you're into sweetness and pancakes definitely go for the wrap. It'll be worth while.\n\nThe service is great, but because they are always busy they don't conversate so much with you. They do get the job done though, and someone is always asking if you need helped or if you have been served."

It comes with fabulous sides of bananas, granola, raisins,blueberries and brown sugar.  The only bad dish I have had so far is the Banana Cream Pie pancakes-they cook the bananas in the batter, which makes the pancake taste like it is undercooked and gives a bad taste. The Hot tea selection is really good-they bring you a box of Shangri La Tea assortment to choose from. Service is always good. Can be noisy at times, but worth the wait."

Only negative thing I have to say is that the tables are extremely close together and it's pretty loud inside.  Love this place though."

Whether you're eating it at 7 AM , 7PM , or 1 AM ... there's just something about the first (or last) meal of the day.  \n\nI'm relegated to eating oatmeal every weekday morning (don't ask ... ), but on the weekends I like to splurge a little.  And the Sunrise Cafe is one of my favorite places to welcome the day.\n\nThe vibe is hip, for a breakfast joint.  Lots of fit people migrate over from the nearby LVAC (Las Vegas Athletic Club for the recently transplanted).  Think beautiful people dressed to work out - though whether they really did work out is a mystery. \n\nThe menu is about what you'd expect from a breakfast eatery.  Eggs, french toast, pancakes, omelettes about any way you can imagine, bagels and lox, wraps, and some specialty dishes like the Peter Brady (you guessed it - pork chops and applesauce).  Prices are reasonable to high for breakfast.  \n\nI eat here about once a month or so.  Right off the 215 and Eastern, it's a convenient, fun, place to eat.  And with the number of people they serve in a given day, you know that the food is always fresh.  I have yet to show up when there wasn't a wait.  Not too long mind you - occasionally it can be 30 minutes, but usually the wait is only 5-10 minutes.\n\nMost recently I had the Power Wrap; grilled chicken, egg whites, salsa, swiss cheese on a sun dried tomato tortilla with hash browns (crispy).  Very tasty, and pretty healthy, if you don't count the 1/2 pound of cheese and hash browns.  No matter, I'll work it off at the LVAC. \n\nSo to sum it up, if you're looking for a good place to eat, with a wide selection of \"healthy\" choices, friendly wait staff, and plenty of eye candy ... Sunrise Cafe is the place to go."

Despite this, the server was super friendly and didn't seem to mind one bit - talk about #nojudgy.  Oh and I would also like to add that I didn't end up eating most of my food until after leaving the restaurant, after I had re-established my livelihood, but this doesn't really make all that much of a difference.\n\nThe prices are pretty standard for breakfast foods, about $7-10 per plate.  However, the coffee price was kind of steep at $2.45.  Not the biggest deal in the world except for the fact that I could only get down like half my cup, but I guess that was my fault, not theirs.  It was strange, though, that they only sell bottled juices, which are standard breakfast fare; you'd think they would at least have a juice machine of some sort.\n\nThe food was super fresh and they're actually one of the only places ever that has made my eggs perfect over medium, my favorite.  I did find the sausage pretty salty, not to mention they come patty style versus in links, which I prefer.  I like that they give you the option between a banana and hash browns as a side, but we actually ordered both. The potatoes were light and crispy, and the bananas came sliced in a small bowl, which was very convenient."

Every time I order I substitute the turkey for sausage. I have been doing this for the past year consistently keep in mind. So I ordered last week the same thing and this time I go to pay and my total was different so I looked at the receipt and saw that they charged me for the full Benedict with turkey and a side of 1 piece of sausage for $4!!!!!!! So I asked the lady at the counter who is always nice what happened so she went and got another lady. I asked her why I was being charged differently from 2 weeks ago when I had got the same thing and she told me \"the person who rang you up last time did it wrong\". So someone has been ringing me up wrong for a year because that's how long i have been ordering this. I am so disappointed in this place because I love it but that's just wrong to switch it up on me with no explanation And to be a regular local loyal  customer. I refuse to go back."

All in all I think I've been here about 6 or 7 times in the last 4 years and they hit a home run every single time I've dined. Always had breakfast items and never lunch so my experiences are a bit one-sided.\n\nIt's always very busy on weekends during the breakfast-brunch hours and usually there is a wait to get a table. It was me and a couple buddies and ones fiance after a night of drinking a few brews. Comfort food was in need. We walked up at about 10:30 saturday and they said it would be 10-15 mins for a table, but we could sit at the bartop right away if we wanted it. We chose the bartop and immediately got waters, menus, and silverware. The waters are big which is very nice after a night of drinking and becoming dehydrated.\n\nWe all quickly scanned the menus and ordered. I got the Jacob's Slammin Platter and it was large and fantastic and was about all I could put down. The eggs (scrambled) were perfect, the country potatoes were awesome and crispy.  The 1 sausage patty, 2 strips of bacon, 1 Canadian bacon slice, and the 4 mini pancakes were all perfectly cooked for me as well. It also came with 4 half slices of toast, two were a little bitty bit burned for me, but I was full anyway so I just nibbled on the toast at the end of the meal. \n\nEverybody in my party was extremely pleased with the food, service and speed, price, and location. We all crashed at my buddies house which is near GVR so it was just 3 or so miles down the road. We all went back to the house happy and fat, and didn't take a hug chunk out of our wallets. You can see on the yelp business page for OSC snap-shots of the menu, prices are all in the $6-10 dollar range for most meals, and there's plenty of food in each of the ones I've had."

It was my first time trying out their lunch menu and it impressed me enough that I would happily try another lunch entree again. \n\nMy boyfriend had his usual bueno beni which consists of a bagel, sausage patty, basted egg, fresh jalape\u00f1os, and a sauce of verde hollandaise that is out of this world!\n\nIf you're ever in the SE, this is a must try. Prices are fair and service is solid. There is a morning rush so be prepared to maybe wait 5-10 minutes especially on weekends.

From the surrounding conversations between patrons & servers I could tell they have a lot of regulars, which is very comforting. The menu is a perfect size. It has enough variety for everyone to find something they'd like but not too big like other breakfast places, sometimes it can just be too overwhelming early in the morning. If you like a nice little spice kick you have to give the jalape\u00f1o bacon a try. Our server was Jesse. He's great at what he does. He's very attentive, knowledgeable, & efficient. I think we'll become regulars too."

I ordered the  Crunchberry french toast, I love concept of them using crunchberries from Captian Crunch cereal.  The presentation was great, but the French toast itself wasnt, all that great. All i could taste was the blueberry sauce, what a disappointment! I was so worried that the meal would be too sweet, but it wasnt.  I think if you order this meal you should ask for the sauce on the side as a cautionary.  Overall the place is ok and I think it deserves another chance. Perhaps the cinnamon pancakes will be my next choice to try."

My bueno beni (southwestern eggs bennidict) was delicious.   The waiter was incredibly friendly and executed each of our special requests perfectly. \n\nComplaints:  egg was basted a bit too hard, it took forever to get a table and the food took a long time to come out. This is really to be expected at an awesome breakfast place at 10am on Saturday morning. They also had a tough time with a group of six at a really busy time, like almost everywhere. It was much less busy by noon, and looked like it wouldn't have been bad had we gotten there early. \n\nAll things considered I would definitely go again, and probably will work my way through most of the menu."

First, we got seated fairly quickly and had a great waiter but then got a text that our two relatives joining us were stuck in traffic and running 30 mins late! Since the place was busy we didn't want to hold up the table and told our waiter what was up. He was super appreciative, helped us move with our drinks to a waiting area, put our names on the waiting list again and then got us refills. While we waited another lady came by and offered us blueberry muffin samples. When our family arrived, the hostess immediately came over to let us know the next table would be ours. Our new waiter was just as friendly. In fact, it should be noted EVERYONE in this place was nice and accommodating, even the bus boys. Very rare and such a refreshing change in this town. Lots of food choices. Our group had Brooklyn eggs Benedict, an omelette, a burger and a lox bagel sandwich thing. The food was all amazing...tasty, hot and prompt. I really really wanted one of their fabulous French toast creations but made a more reasonable choice...maybe next time lol anyway, we will definitely be back next time we are in town..I can't say enough great things about this place!!!"

A few of my takeaways (we got there for lunch, and there was a decent crowd, mostly workers it seems):\n\n-The hamburgers are pre cooked patties, and only prepared well done. \n\n-Friendly waitress. I had a good banter with her and she kept the conversation flowing. Also very quick to refill coffee and water.\n\n-I went with the Fiesta Benedict on everything bagel as my meal. Not too bad. You at least get a good portion. Wasn't a huge fan of the fiesta Hollandaise sauce, but it's at least creative.\n\n -There's also seats near the bathroom if there's a line, and an odd amount of religious crosses on wall. I'm not sure if this is a big Christian establishment or not, but either way, good food on your way into Sin City."

I ate the Fiest Benedict - which had a toasted bagel, basted egg (perfectly cooked), Jalapeno Bacon, and pepper jack cheese. It was coated with a spicy hollandaise sauce, that was simply devine. The best Eggs Benedict I've ever eaten. Very unique. I loved it. Even the potatoes had great flavor and crispness. \n\nMy friend had the coolest Banana Cream Pie Pancakes... banana syrup, bananas on top, and dulce de leche whipped butter!!! YUMMMM. Comes with 3 cakes. The coolest thing by far was the Jalapeno Bacon! Excellent flavor, worth the money to have a taste of this. Several pieces to a side, so it's a good value. \n\nThe place was very busy, as it was Sunday morning, but we still managed to get a table inside right away. There is also patio seating, breakfast bar seating, tables or booths. Bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. Server was very nice and very prompt. When should couldn't make it over, she sent a runner. So our drinks, food, and general needs were quickly attended to. \n\nI don't know why anyone would eat at IHOP or Denny's with this little gem just down the road on Eastern & 215.

Anyway to the review:\n\nThe Original Sunrise Cafe was packed! However, with good luck on our side we were seated in about five minutes.  The cafe had a nice vibe and was filled with people.  Fresh coffee was....well....Vegas cafe coffee; nuff said.  After a few glances around the menu we both noted how they covered several breakfast categories but only offered a small selection for each. \n\nWe both decided on omelets and OSC offers egg white versions of every omelet.  I have to say that my omelet the Eggzilla (Egg whites, spinach, roasted peppers and salsa topped with sunrise garlic sauce and jack cheese) was pretty good.  Although, Ashley D's omelet was nothing to write home about; sadly.  Overall, for $8.99 they come with a bagel/toast on the side making it a decent deal.  I just think for the amount of breakfast/brunch locations you can do a little better."

There's lots of ample seating, and the service was fast and friendly. There's an older crowd that comes in (kinda like early-morning grandparents that like to go out for breakfast and coffee), but that doesn't really take away from the experience.\n\nI got to taste the Brooklyn Benedict. It looks just as good as it does in the first picture. It comes in two giant pieces dripping in hollondaise sauce. It's got some turkey bits inside, which was different, but it went well with it. The whole piece was topped on top of an everything bagel, which I guess is where the Brooklyn name comes from, and it tastes very good with it! I didn't expect that at all. Only thing is that the bagel (like any other bagel) is very hearty, moreso than the normal bread you would get. So it's extremely filling. But it tasted great in combination.\n\nAlso got to try the Crunchberry Toast. It's french toast with what seems to be small bits of colorful cereal meshed into egg/batter that surrounds the bread. It's very good, but very sweet. So I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a sweet tooth (as if the maple syrup wasn't sweet enough), but I was able to manage through a few bites. I probably wouldn't be able to finish a whole plate by myself though, because I'm not a big sweets guy myself. But otherwise it was still really good.\n\nIf you're looking for coffee. It's horrible. Don't even bother. Get juice or something. Coffee we had was extremely watery. I tried to mask it with cream and sugar (I usually drink my coffee black), but I still couldn't handle it and didn't take more than 4 sips from my mug."

A table shouldn't have even been there in the first place. Not only were we subjected to people walking right up against our food while they were going to and from the restroom, there were a number of flies circling throughout our meal. Since the restaurant was packed, there was nowhere else to move.\n\nOkay.. let's just try to focus on the food and service. The service was great- very attentive, and they must have asked us if they could top off our coffee about 10 times. Toward the end of the meal, we started feeling rushed. I know they were trying to turn the table, but I hate feeling like they are ready for us to get the heck out!\n\nThe food was good, and a good value. The omelettes were nicely sized, and came with potatoes and toast for $8.99. My friend opted to get sliced bananas instead of potatoes (I know-weird), but they came with a hair attached.

Maybe I'll try something different the next time I come in lol, foreal this time. \n\nThe servers we've had have at this place are always so attentive and kind. I don't remember their names but one of them said, \"my rule for ordering is that if I have to ask to remove more than two of the ingredients, it's not worth it.\" It's actually very clever since removing more than two would just change the whole dish altogether. Anyway, will definitely keep coming back!"

I asked Tara for the 'Classic Breakfast' w/ turkey sausage & patties.  They offered to split the two meats when we ordered it last time.  She says the Turkey & Eggs?  I say no the classic just split the meat so she charges us still for the Turkey & Eggs?  \nI don't think I've ever been here on a Thursday so maybe that's why service sucks.  The Caramel coffee was the ONLY awesome thing this time.  \nAfter our meal was served, Jeff C.'s toast looked like someone took a bite of it & was super soggy.  Mine looked good & from a totally different bag.  We sat w/ no place set-up, silverware or hot sauce... the server who brings our breakfast brings it...two full bottles of Franks Red Hot like somehow I was going to finish a whole bottle.  He asks anything else?  Yes silverware. \nWhen we did get it Jeff's was sticky like jelly.\nUsually they fill up the coffee. Mine sat empty for awhile.  \nItll be awhile until I come back.  Disappointed.\n\nWe originally went to Cracker Barrel, but still the wait is an hour on a Tuesday so we headed not far to the OSC.  Immediately, we were greeted & seated.  Love the original staff some of which are still here too. Forewarning, expect a wait on the weekends, usually no more than 15 minutes & packed, but worth it!\n\nThey not only have awesome breakfast, lunch and a bar counter to sit at, if you're in a rush or alone, but they sell local art pieces displayed on the wall, old fashioned candy & sodas so it gives you that down home comfy feeling.  Also I am a coffee freak so always look forward to their specialty coffees such as the Cinnamon-Hazelnut coffee.  Mmm!  \n \nDaisy was our awesome server today.  Thank you for making our morning so wonderful.  \n\nNew to OSC Bacon Ribs glazed in bourbon BBQ sauce!"

First off, we were seated and brought drinks really quickly. But upon seeing the menu, my boyfriend and I were very unimpressed. We usually like to order country fried steak or skillets, but they had neither. We ended up picking the two best sounding items on the menu and after a suggestion from the waitress, ultimately ended up ordering the Cajun prime rib Benedict and the crunch berry French toast. And we were so ready to be disappointed but man... It was SOO  delicious. The texture and flavor of the French toast was perfection, not too sweet and not soggy. It had a really good crisp on the outside and was warm and fuzzy and the inside. And the bendedict... I must say that it was topped with the best hollandaise sauce I've ever tasted.. Overall a wonderful experience. Device was stellar as well, very friendly and attentive. I would definitely stop here again next time I'm on this side of town!"

We figured we'd be in & out so we didn't mind waiting and decided to stay. They kindly handed out water for those that were waiting.\n\nFinally, we were seated. Our order was quickly taken, but the wait for our food was lengthy. It gave us time to notice the booth beside us had some misbehaved children that were bouncing all over. The boy bounced about so much that he heaved up breakfast. They left the mess and what appeared to be a very small tip. The table sat empty waiting to be cleaned, they got a bus boy over with a stomach that could handle it. He cleaned the table like it was any other mess. And the next couple was immediately seated. I really expected the area to be disinfected with care. I cringed when the unknowing couple sat down. I'm sure this sort of thing happens all the time, but it's the first I've witnessed it. So that was a turn off.\n\nWe were starved and sweaty by the time our breakfast arrived. The garden of eden for me and a build your own for him. We prefer omelets with the cheese on the inside, a personal preference, I know so I try not to let it sway my judgement. However, these were underseasoned. Just very bland. They might be eggwhites, but that doesn't mean that shouldn't be flavorful. Breakfast came to $30 plus tip. We failed to find the value."

This is a solid 4 Star breakfast/lunch joint that offers a diverse portfolio of eggs, sandwiches, meats and potatoes. This place is very unique in that egg whites seemed to be the preferred favorites. Right away I feel like this is a health conscious diner. \n\nI ordered the Jacob's platter and I must say that you definitely get the best bang for your buck with this item. I'm a man of variety so I do love the option of getting everything I want on a dish without the pesky additional charges. Poached eggs, home potatoes hash, jalepeno bacon, Canadian bacon, sausage patty, silver dollar pancakes, and a cinnamon bagel and cream cheese on the side for $8.99! Throw in a fantastic staff that works well together and you have yourself a fantastic breakfast. \n\nSo why not a 5 star? I'm a breakfast/brunch snob.

A half portion is really enough, and the hash browns were nicely crunchy. The toast had pecans and hints of toffee in the batter.

I ordered the eggs benedict with sausage and jalapenos, my hubby had a stack of pancakes.  \n\nLet me start with the pancakes:  They were a good size about the size of a medium dinner plate.  One of the pancake seemed a little over cooked as the outside was a bit darker then the other two and a little tougher.  The give a small amount of syrup but you can always ask for more.\n\nEggs benedict:  The hollandaise was just so so meaning it was light but too buttery and needed a little kick (maybe a hint of fresh lemon juice).  There was nothing special about the sausage just your typical sausage patty.  The touch of jalapenos was good; however it was drenched in jalapenos so it over powered everything else.  The eggs were perfectly poached and everything was served on top of an original bagel.  I've had eggs benedict on a traditional english muffin, croissant, and even hawaiian bread and I have to admit having it on a bagel is not something I particularly care for.  It is just too much.  \n\nAs for the potatoes: they're hash brown style cut a little thicker then your traditional hash browns.  Their grilled to a crisp on the outside and soft to the bite.  Made with lotsa butter though that's why it tasted so good.\n\nAt the end of our meal they gave my 4 year old a pick at their treasure chest and that made him happy.  I would come back and maybe try something different.  So, just A-ok for now...maybe will get a better  rating next time."

We come here probably twice a month, despite the 20+ minute drive from our house. \n\nService: The service is typically excellent. After our first meal at Sunrise, we told our server that it was our first time and everything was delicious and we would definitely be back. Shortly after, the owner came over to welcome us and to say thank you. She's a really friendly, genuine person. Whenever there's a wait, she'll go around with a treat, like banana bread, to give to the waiting customers. There usually is a wait, especially on weekend mornings, but the service is so efficient that I've never waited more than 15 minutes. The last time we were there, one of the hostesses was unfortunately pretty snippy with us. It was such a shame because we usually are met with nothing but genuine friendliness. Perhaps she was having a bad morning. \n\nFood: The food is consistently fresh and tasty. I usually get the Jacob's Slammin' Platter, which is two eggs, bacon, canadian bacon, sausage, silver dollar pancakes, potatoes, and toast or bagel. It's like a breakfast sampler. The potatoes are some of the best I've ever had. My boyfriend gets the Bueno Beni, which is eggs benedict over a bagel with jalapeno hollandaise and cheese. It's a delicious, spicy indulgence. The kitchen is also really good about modifying if you have any dietary restrictions, so don't be afraid to ask if you want to make any changes. The orange juice is really sweet, so I tend to get a small size rather than the very big large. Price-wise, it's so affordable, especially considering the quality and portion-sizes. \n\nAtmosphere: Great, bustling atmosphere. It's lively and fun and fast-paced, but I've never felt rushed. Sunrise is like a diner in that it is quick, as well as welcoming and casual. You can see straight into the kitchen to watch your food being prepared, especially if you sit at the counter."

Nothing that would ruin a meal but a little annoying.  Hubby used to love the Crunchberry French Toast.  On this visit it did not live up to what he remembered.  You couldn't taste any Crunchberry flavor.  It tasted like regular french toast with a berry sauce.  There are a few pluses, you can get half orders of french toast and service is always friendly."

While waiting for our table, they handed out samples of the grilled blueberry muffin! Excellent! So fresh and tasty. And the bribe worked, because our table ordered one as an \"appetizer\". We also ordered the snow caps, their French toast bagel. Another excellent choice. We were all so pleased before our entrees even came out. Once the main course arrived, we were treated to another round of delicious food. Serving sizes are beyond generous. And prices definitely reasonable for Las Vegas!"

However, it was a large portion and it was pretty yummy. I was only able to eat about half before giving up, but they were just as good the next morning warmed over. The service was also good, but seemed to geared to rush you out the door, so it's probably not true best place for a meeting.

I have dined here twice. The first time was under serious time constraints, and all I had was a turkey wrap. All I can say is that it was indeed a turkey wrap.\n\nThe second time I had a bit more time to peruse the menu and make an informed decision. What surprises me is that it is the type of place where you expect to order whole grain pancakes, but there is a small problem, they don't have whole-wheat pancakes. This is not a darling, hippie, organic, super creative, knockin' my socks off caf\u00e9 where you can get a mixed green salad with your sundried tomato pesto egg white omelet and glass of carrot ginger juice. They serve breakfast, sandwiches, wraps and salads, and it is all simply getting the job done for me.\n\nOn the repeat visit, I went with the Veggie Benedict with the Hollandaise on the side on top of an everything bagel with a side of potatoes. The veggies included sliced tomatoes, spinach and mushrooms. The Benedict sans sauce definitely tasted good for you. The bagel could have used a little more everything, but it was soft and easy to eat. The potatoes were tasty--definitely not the best for you, as I am pretty sure the tastiness was a result of butter. I would eat it again if I were in the area and needed a breakfasty bite, but I would not drive there just to eat it. \n\nThere was no wait on a Sunday morning at 11am. The service was great. And, note to dog peeps: They have a dog friendly patio."

You'll be sure to be searching for a parking spot and be waiting to be seated if you come later in the morning as this place is family friendly, beefcake friendly from LVAC next door, and dog friendly.\n\nTheir menu has been exactly the same as far as I can remember but is consistently executed well. They have a create your own omelette section to accompany your standard breakfast options. There are some creative French toast selections and benedicts served on bagels. If you're leaning toward something on the sweet side, I would recommend one of the French toasts. On our most recent visit, I went with the Crunchberry French toast which definitely brought back some childhood memories, with actual crushed Crunchberries. My wife created her own omelette which included her choice of three items which were spinach, bacon, and mushrooms served with potatoes\n\nThe hosts are efficient at seating the tables and the servers handle the volume quite well, but are sure to have occasional absences because of the number of tables they are covering. We've never had an issue with the kitchen as they handle the number of orders well also. \n\nPrices probably average between the $9 and $10 range which I think is fair considering the portion sizes. If you're in the area, and see that there is no line, I would stop by because they  consistently provide a good experience."

I am admittedly a coffee snob though so this is a nit picking statement. \n\nCertain menu items could be made easier to eat.  For instance the tomato and onions on the bagels and loks could be diced as opposed to being served as a slice."

Food came out fairly quickly and it looked amazing when she sat it down on the table. Four slices of Texas toast with pecans, powdered sugar, and syrup! How could this go wrong? Well, it did. Took a bite of the bread before lathering it in syrup and it was much too soggy in the middle and there was no contrast between the textures in each bite. Pretty disappointing dish. The flavor was fine and loved the pecans obviously, but the lack of quality in the preparation of the toast just killed it.  \n\nAgain, service was fantastic and would come back to try other things on the menu perhaps."

More than enough food for the two of us. This place is a bit pricey, but again not so bad if you are splitting. I have also tried the banana cream pancakes and I could eat a vat of the delicious dulce de leche butter. I am also a huge fan of the chicken chipotle wrap, the homemade chipotle ranch is awesome! Their sandwiches are just as good as their breakfast, but there is nothing special about the macaroni or potato salad. I am addicted to french fries and I am always a little disappointed when restaurants don't have a fryer.

Sunrise diner just goest above and beyond for all their customers...\n\n\nAND THE FOOD! Ugh! Just as good as the service. Delicious fluffy omelets made anyway you want it. The menus is a good size and doesn't have 1 bad thing on it. I wish I was a local so I could have more time to try more of their food. One of the best!"

Didn't try the coffee yet but they need FRESH squeezed OJ it tastes like tang whatever they are using.\n\nThe staff is great, very casual and sweet. All throughout the morning and afternoon this place is packed with couples, friends, and students sipping coffee and eating healthy but delicious food.\n\nI think this is one of my favorite breakfast places, I love the Jacob's platter, I dig any breakfast that includes a bagel & cream cheese along with hash browns and three kinds of meat. The boy enjoyed a egg Benedict over a bagel with Canadian bacon. Both awesome!"

My parents of course know me well, that I would be reluctant to go to a casino buffet primarily due to the foul smoke... not very appetizing while I eat. \n\nAgain thanks to Yelp, I was rescued from eating at iHop or Denny's. Well it must have been ~9:30am, and there was already a line. As much as I despise waiting in lines, I knew that usually a line means \"it must be good and worth the wait\". \nAND fortuntely this was true for this case.\n\nTheir breakfast-lunch menu was impressive. I have to agree with a previous review, I wished they served french fries... skinny fries.  But their home fries was a pretty tasty alternative.  From eyeing the neighboring tables, the omelettes were big or decent size.  I was hungry but didn't want to overeat, since I knew the primary plan for Christmas-Holiday wkends are to eat... so I wanted to pace myself.  So I shared the Greek omelette with my nephew.  I wanted to add more protein but gave him the choice between grilled chicken and steak.  We had the steak and it was delicious... totally hit the spot.  It was also super cool that they didn't charge to split our entrees.  My parents were pleasantly surprised that a yummy breakfast hot-spot was so close to them, but they would have never stopped by to check it out if it wasn't for me Yelping this place:)  \nWill definitely come here again when I come back and visit!"

After ordering and waiting about 15 minutes they refilled our drinks and the waitress mentioned that since we ordered french toast it will take longer. \n\nA whopping 25 minutes later we get our food (total of 40 min wait) we get our food.

I had a cheese omelet that was accompanied by some very flavorful and well seasoned hash browns. A cut above the usual fare. The bagel that came with my order had REAL cream cheese on it. My wife's bagel plate included some very good lox. Even the coffee was good. Service is extremely attentive and friendly. This will be a regular stop for us. No bar service. So no Bloody Mary for me"

The host and waitstaff were extremely nice, very attentive and personable.  They were very helpful with menu suggestions and the menu was fun and creative without being overly trendy.  The food was fresh and perfectly done.  Especially liked the large grated hashbrowns and the French Toast was among the best I'd ever had.   \n\nWe're not generally in that area when we visit, were near there for a softball tournament, but it was so good that in the future we'll be willing to go out of our way to eat here.

It's nothing fancy, but the food is tasty, and the service is so friendly. After only a few visits, the staff came to recognize us and remember our favorite dishes. Of course, our favorite of all time turned out to be the fiesta benedict, featuring said jalape\u00f1o bacon and a spicy hollandaise sauce. I also really appreciated their flexibility; anytime I wanted to customize anything on the menu (such as, say, adding jalape\u00f1o bacon) it was always no problem. I loved that all their benedicts came on bagels rather than muffins, and that we could get sliced bananas as a side. Other than their benedicts, we really enjoyed their morning wraps and omelettes (especially the Davezilla omelette with amazing garlic sauce). We even went for lunch there once and had some delicious burgers. Now that we've moved, we certainly miss this place!"

This was at least 5 minutes. \nA big fan of when a customer walks in, immediately greet them.\n\nThe place was crowded at 9:30am during the week, so I thought this place has got to be good!\n\nI ordered the veggie benedict. Didn't realize they specialized in bagels until I asked that I have an english muffin for my benedict and was told they did not have them., that they are known for their bagels. I asked for the Hollandaise on the side which they were accomodating. \n\nMy meal came, it was two sunny side eggs on top of spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes and an everything bagel. The bagel was soft and chewy and loaded with butter. Didn't taste much like other everything bagels that I have had, but it was good. \n\nI was drinking hot tea, and a server walked by with a hot pot. I asked if by any chance was that hot water, her response, No, coffee, and she continued walking. \nEven the woman with me was surprised over the response and not, I'll bring you back some, I'll let your server know.... \n\nFood is ok, that most likely will return. Hopefully I will have a better experience on the service. Not asking much, just a smile and hello."

The potato salad was also pre made probably the standard from U S Foods. Will give it another try sometime."

Jordan had their Fiesta Beni, a little spicer than most but perfect for him. He also tried their coffee of the day which was a warm butterscotch flavor. I opted for the normal black coffee as well as their oatmeal overload. Unfortunately, as I am gluten free, I was unable to try their pancakes or French toast. However, the oatmeal came with blueberries, bananas, raisins, brown sugar, and granola. I also tried a side of their homemade potatoes since they are never fried and always fresh! \nNeedless to say we had a fabulous experience, I highly recommend this cafe to anyone!"
