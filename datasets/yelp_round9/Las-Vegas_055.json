So when a Korean person says this place is good, then you know it's good. The wait staff is super friendly and it's like they are family. They served you boiled peanuts while you wait, which is super tasty. The panchan (side dishes) changes day by day. My favorites are the bean sprouts and the Kim chee. They add a refreshing kick in between your bites of hot food. I ordered bi bim bop in the stone pot. The meat, rice and vegetables stayed super hot throughout my whole meal and I had to wait a good 5 minutes for me to even take a bite. The rice at the bottom of the pot gets crispy and adds texture to the meal. My bf had the combo plate which came with kalbi, meat jun and teriyaki chicken. All the meat was tender and full of flavor. We were both super full and happy. Definitely one of the best Korean spots in town."

I cannot stress enough how comforting our server was, who is also the owner! He encouraged us to try the side dishes he served us, offered more rice, offered Korean tea, etc. It was like eating at a relative's house. \n\nI loved my teriyaki hamburger steak along with the banchan, and I would love to come back again."

            "review": "Why oh Why has it taken me so long too check out Island Style. Talk about some awesome local grinds. Think not even taped the surface of this menu! Geesh! I think this place taken over my top spot for local style plate lunch food. Plus if local food not your thing they have another whole section of the menu of Chinese. No doubt is coming too Island Style need too go local style!!!!!\n\nI keep hearing about the Meat Jun and its something always always been fan of when it comes too korean food. Toss up between Meat Jun and Kali bi. Only winnahs either or both. The Meat Jun was Amazing!! I love the fact that the egg batter outside not too thick but just right amount of coating not see the meat until dig in, outside nice golden brown, the meat inside has nice seasonings, and meat was moist. Tradition local style white rice and mac salad. I liked the mac salad. The portion size is great! All of it under ten dollars. Is there better deal for lunch?? Think not! Hawaiian food always get your money worth and more....\n\nOne of the highlights was the sides that your meal came with at Island Style. Moist Korean restaurants been too can be hit or miss the amount they give plus the different types you get. Here you get five different ones. Although it was only me they were very generous with everything. Korean kim chee fan for life. The kim chee here not hot hot but still good. The roasted peanut action. Now if that doesn't speak too keeping it local style not sure what else can say.  It comes with anything you order almost like bread no charge. They even put it in a to go container so can take it home. Sweet! \n\nThe service was great! U can tell local owners and care about putting out good local grinds. They just expanded couple weeks ago so restaurant is lot bigger. I went for lunch so the place was not too packed. Parking can be issue if go when busy since only parking in front of the restaurant. If looking for Meat Jiun Island Style the only way too go. No doubt plan on going back because Kali bi, Katsu, combo plates, fried noodles, and so much more too try."

You cannot get anymore customer friendly, and customer pleasing than this place OMG!! Everything is homemade and seriously tastes like your eating at someone's house super good!!! While you wait they serve you peanuts MMMMmmmMMm and kimchi. NO JOKE BEST KIMCHI IN VEGAS (other than my mother in laws) I have had every dish here (yes if you read my other reviews I LOVE TO EAT!) and am yet to be disappointed, only thing that I would change is make the spicy pork a bit spicier and for them to offer POKE! This place has been in business for 18 years for a reason! Stop in and you will not be disappointed with anything that you order or the service provided by the owner himself!"

Island style is a restaurant a couple miles off of the strip that looks kind of run down from the outside, and not much to look at from the inside either. I was brought here to try food that was Hawaiian, but also Korean\n\n...huh?!?  \n\nRegardless of what type of food it was, it was super tasty!\n\nI ordered the teriyaki beef plate.  It came with rice and macaroni salad.  The beef and the macaroni had great flavor.  The rice was rice, and tasted like rice should.  The curveball was that they served Korean style vegetable side dishes, like kimchi, to go along with the food.  They were okay, but the real highlight was the main entr\u00e9e.  I am still salivating over how delicious the beef was, and I can't wait to have it again.  \n\nIsland Style is not the type of place to take someone who is vacationing in Vegas if you want to impress them...unless they really like flavorful food! Thankfully I do! It was an awesome find, and a great new place for me to go whenever I want to venture off of the strip."

But the owner was incredibly nice and went out of his way to make us feel at home. He even showed us what he used to make the tea (which was delicious especially when iced!) and gave us extra kimchi!

The black noodles always hit the spot and you can tell it's good as many local Koreans flock to this place for that dish. Only a few places in town that can execute that dish like they do.\n\nThey have many other items on the menu i have never tried. Looked and smelled like they had good Hawaiian/Korean barbecue plates as well. \n\nWhen I was there, I believe it was the owner who took care of the front of house flow while his wife was the one whipping up the amazing dishes. I believe the guy is hawaiian and his wife Korean. Amazing service and great food. \n\nBeing a Korean restaurant they obviously have some ban chan and also some peanuts to snack on before the meal which was nice. \n\nI like that they do not try to be anything flashy or special. Highly recommend this place."

I ended up ordering the spicy chicken, Korean style. It was literally AMAZING! It came with a generous side of white rice and Hawaiian style mac salad. And of course, some Korean appetizers, they were all soooo good! My boyfriend got the same thing I did, but with pork and his was fantastic as well. I believe it was $11.95, and honestly for that price and the amount of food you can't beat it! I will definitely be stopping here next time I'm in town."

            "review": "Island Style serves up affordable, delicious bibimbap and banchan with attentive and sweet service. This pocket gem can be hard to find and I was finally notified of its existence when my co-workers suggested it for lunch.\n\nMy favorite parts of a Korean meal are the complimentary banchan plates and hot tea and this place delivered. The standard kimchi, sprouts, and pickled cucumbers tasted sour and \"fresh\". Surprises included tasty diced franks saut\u00e9ed with onions; boiled peanuts; steamed broccoli; and salty, dried tiny fish. But don't expect all of this in one meal. Every visit yielded different banchan plates and that's totally fine in my book. \n\nThe signature bibimbap was executed very well. It's served hot and the medley of diced vegetables, sliced steak, steamed rice, and a fried egg came out perfectly like Kim Yuna landing a triple lutz. The serving size is ridiculously generous and I NEVER finished.  It's served two ways: regular bowl ($8.95) and hot spot ($9.95). I personally liked the regular bowl better because the hot pot can turn the rice super crispy and that those little suckers will get stuck in your molars. But the hot pot is fanciful and the sizzling caused me to oohh and ahhh. Definitely, a dish if you desperately want attention from others."

My boyfriend and I were trying to kill time since our flight came in wayyy earlier than our hotel check in, so we came here to have lunch. \n\nIt was easy to find but the parking lot is soo small and crowded, so be careful driving around in there. The restaurant itself is small and can get very crowded during lunch hours. Luckily for us, we got here when it wasn't too busy but got extremely busy when we left. They serve Korean and popular Hawaiian dishes which made it extremely hard for an indecisive person to pick. I settled with the salmon teriyaki which was really good. Generous portions and decently priced.  The owner was EXTREMELY nice and made his way around checking up on us occasionally and even joking with us."

Last night, the noodles were slightly overcooked and seemed different from the first two times I've had it, but the sauce was on point. It's also just $8.95.\n\nAfter feeling like the Hawaiian eats were a bust, I ordered the Kalua Pork and Cabbage ($12.95) the last two times and it is delicious! It's one of my favorite Hawaiian dishes, so it has my stamp of approval. The sticky white rice and macaroni salad were good too.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Banchan didn't impress me. I didn't like their kimchi at all and there wasn't anything else memorable. However, we love the complimentary boiled peanuts (another Hawaii \"pupu\" staple)!\n\nService is wonderful and everything is so quick, which is very good because it gets busy! We were there for dinner on Saturday night around 7:30pm and although there was no wait, the tables were full.\n\nI wish this spot wasn't so far from home, but there aren't many places that serve Jajangmyeon, so I'll definitely be back for those noodles and some Kalua Pork and Cabbage!"

We have been coming here for years and they never fail. Whenever we want good island food or quick Korean food this is a good place to come. They have delicious loco moco, hamburger steak, bibimbap, and my favorite Korean meat Jun. Meat Jun is basically tender beef dipped in egg pan fried and served with a soy dipping sauce. In Hawaii you can find it on any menu but in Vegas it's hard to find. I love the fact that they serve banchan with all the menu items because I'm obsessed with banchan and Korean food in general. This place has expanded since my last visit which has been quite a while but they are busier than I remember them being before. Regardless of all that when your craving island style Hawaiian Iran food this place doesn't disappoint. Just a tip you might have to park next door in the eyeglass parking lot and walk over as this shopping lot gets busy and rarely has parking."

We met in the middle and decided to try Island Style.  \n\nAs we drove up, went in and sat down, there is nothing special about the ambiance of this place.  The place did not feel welcoming.  Bland, basic decor, lighting is almost hospital sterile in many ways.  Based on the name, we thought it would be 75% Hawaiian food and 25% Asian Fusion food.  But in reality it was 30% Hawaiian food and 70% Korean food.\n\nWe focused on the Hawaiian dishes and we just thought they were OK.  We tried Bi Bim Bopp, Masubi and the Combo Dish (meat & egg platter or sorts).  Based on reviews on YELP on this place, we were expecting something more and some element of WOW.  It did not happen.  It's not that it was bad, but We've experienced better.  Food was just OK.  Staff was nice, but not particularly attentive of friendly.  \n\nIn Las Vegas there are too many food options and as such, we will not be back."

The galbi, meat jun, fried rice were all good.. not amazing. Mool naeng myun was terrible. I usually don't order it unless I'm really in the mood, because I haven't found many places outside of Korea that can make this well. Unfortunately, I happened to be in the mood for it. Sometimes I can tolerate it by adding vinegar and mustard to cover most of the taste. This one didn't taste like much of anything even after adding the mustard and vinegar. Probably one of the worst / bottom five.\n\nWe ordered chili japchae which we thought was regular japchae with peppers to add a kick. Instead, it was stir fried onions and peppers, which confused us. It tasted like a thai dish I've had and was pretty good, but not what we expected at all.\n\nThe kimchi was good, so I wouldn't mind buying this to-go."

(I'm from Hawaii) I've been to Island Style three times and will definitely be back. I'm slowly working my way through the menu. haha. \n\nOk for starters, the place looks sketchy from outside, but inside is bright and welcoming.  The owner/host is super friendly and makes you feel right at home.  First you get hot tea, warm boiled peanuts if they have any, kimchi, and a couple other korean appetizer munchies. ... and you get a LOT of it (and it's all free!). The owner is quick to notice if your little dishes get low, and will bring refills and send you home with more if you want.  \n\nI have tried and recommend the eggs, rice, and portuguese sausage plate, the fried rice, and the meat jun plate.  happy eating :)"

I was very excited to try the meat jun because I kept reading about it on the reviews.  What I discovered was that its marinated meat, covered in egg and then pan fried.  This dish was pretty good overall but I would have passed on the teriyaki chicken.\n\nI was really happy when I asked for a grilled fish but a small portion, the lady owner offered to make me just 1 grilled Corvina for a low price.  Sure!  And yummy mini grilled fish it was.  If I could, I would just eat that and a bowl of rice...and then just be sated for the day."

We were looking for a highly rated and affordable place off the strip and my wife and I love Korean so we decided to give this place a try.  Once we arrived we almost turned around as there were no other customers in the restaurant and it always seems odd to me to eat in an empty place.  But it was Monday so I expect that it is traditionally a slow night, especially for places away from casinos.\n\nI am so glad that we stayed.  Russell is a great guy and he welcomed us like we were eating in his home.  I ordered a combo plate with short ribs, meat jun and chicken and my wife ordered the bibimbap served in a hot pot.  Russel kept bringing out plates of food, some which come standard like the boiled peanuts and kimchi, and other dishes which he just offered on the house.  He brought bowls of soup, dumplings and hot tea.  Pretty soon our entire table was covered in plates and I was in heaven.  The food is simply prepared yet it all tasted awesome and was very satisfying.\n\nThe bill for all of this food, soda and hot tea was less than $20 so I gave Russell a generous tip since I think he gave us about double the food we were actually charged for.  I hope that he stays in business a long time because we will be back the next time we are in Vegas."

They aren't especially attentive and you can end up waiting between refills or struggling a little to get their attention if you need something else.

It's an older generation korean saying about how to judge a restaurant and their food quality.  \n\nOf all the Korean restaurants that I've been to, this place has to be the best in town! About 10 minutes from the strip, I highly recommend coming here for all your korean OR hawaiian food cravings.   Of course being a Yelpy, I found this on my phone app and noticed their great ratings by a lot of people.  Since bf loves hawaiian food and I absolutely need my kimchi fix at least once a day, this sounded like a perfect place to satisfy both our cravings.  \n\nDon't expect anything fancy.  It's located in a ghetto strip mall with nothing so glitzy like the strip.   But don't let that fool you!  I was skeptical about how their food would taste like when both the server and the owner were NOT korean.  However, once the big slab of kimchi came out along with the other side dishes, it was game over.   Even my mom was very impressed with the way they make their kimchi.  Then again, even my bf who doesn't EVER eat kimchi actually ate it!  Now that's saying a lot about how great and awesome they prepare their kimchi. \n\nMy favorite was their radish kimchi.   We asked for more to take it back to the hotel with us!  \n\nOh yeah, haven't even said anything about the main dishes yet.  lol  My mom and I shared the hot stone pot rice with veggies.  (dolsot bibimbap)  which was surprisingly good.  I especially loved the little pieces of marinated beef on top of the rice.  \n\nBF got the meat jun which he thought was very yummy.  He gives it 5 stars!  We also shared the fried dumplings and I loved the crispy won ton skin!  The overall experience was very positive and satisfying.    This is our Must Go to place in Vegas!\n\nThe owner said his wife makes EVERYTHING herself and they also have another restaurant inside the Greenland market nearby.

It was not far from our hotel on the strip, so in minutes we were at the restaurant.  I have to say, do not let the exterior of the building deter you or you'll really be missing out on some great service and tasty food!\n\nAs we entered, we were quickly greeted by a gentleman with a big smile, asking us if we were hungry?  He quickly sat us and we were given menus and asked what we'd like to drink.  As we waited for drinks, I couldn't help but noticing the food pictures on the wall.  I'm not  big on ordering your meal by the picture, yet that is exactly what I did. It all looked SO GOOD!  We were brought 4 different types of kim chi type vegetables and some boiled peanuts. I can still taste them! Yum!\n\nAs we asked plenty of questions about the menu, our server, who ended up being the owner, patiently answered all of them making suggestion as we went.  We made a joke about wanting to try it all, and he said \"Let's do it!\"  He was excited that we were excited to eat and try new things. OK...now to the order.\n\nWe started off with an appetizer and I'm not sure what they were called, yet they reminded me of an empenada. They were hand made that day, and I regret not taking an order to go!  As for the entrees, my friend and I both ordered the meat combo: egg battered ribeye, short-rib and chicken with spam fried rice. If you love meat, this is your dish!  I am not a spam guy, but the spam fried rice was SO good!  Another had this meat over a bed of rice dish smothered in a thin beef gravy.  I forgot the name, yet it was DELISH!  Our last order wasn't even on the menu.  One of us was hung over, so the owner said, \"Let me make you something to cure that hangover.\"  He brought out this big bowl of soup for my friend, and after tasting it, I ordered a small bowl myself!\n\nAll in all, a tremendously positive, inexpensive experience with solid, good tasting food!  We have found our new lunch spot in Vegas!  \n\nThank you, Yelp! \n\nJ~"

Their combo plate - chicken teriyaki, kalbi (beef short rib), and meat jun (beef wrapped in egg) is seriously good value, almost three meals in one.\n\nAll in all, super-friendly service, great value, and a deservedly huge local following. A nice hole-in-the-wall restaurant tucked into the middle of a strip mall that's all too easy to drive past."

            "review": "My husband and I came by here two Thursdays ago for lunch. I had this place bookmarked for a little over year and have always wanted to come and glad that I finally did.\n\nAnyways, when we arrived, I didn't really know what to expect. From the outside, this place looked a little sketchy. The sign has graffiti on it and the little strip mall this is located in just seemed kind of small and not in the best of neighborhoods. Anyways, when we walked in, we were acknowledged by a server and she told us to pick a table to sit down. When we sat down, we were given 2 cups of water and a closed styrofoam container. Wasn't too sure what that styrofoam container was for and thought our server accidentally put it on our table and that she boxed up someone's leftovers at another table.\n\nInside the styrofoam container is cold boiled peanuts so we started eating that as we were deciding what to order. Our server came by pretty quickly and we ended up ordering:\n\n2 orders of Bibimbap in a stone pot- delicious! Just as good as any other place I have had bibimbap. Loved the crunchy rice as well (the benefits of ordering this in a stone pot/ bowl). \n\nChicken Musubi- Delicious! I didn't know musubi could be made with chicken since I have always seen it only with spam. The only thing is that the chicken was a bit oily, but that's expected at a down home place like this.\n\nSpam Musubi- I didn't get a bite of this but my husband liked it. The size for this musubi and the chicken one was a pretty big piece. \n\nOur meal was also rounded out with some banchan. We got 4 little plates and my favorite was this one with broccoli. One man, whom I suspect is one of the owners (or maybe the manager) refilled our banchan throughout our meal. Our server was great at refilling our water. This other guy (I guess you can call him a server to?) also refilled our water and was really friendly. Service was very attentive, quick and very friendly. I will definitely come back here again the next time I am in the area. Oh and real random, this place has fast (ask for the password) wifi."

It's a neighborhood restaurant but it does a pretty good job with Korean food.\nI ordered the combination plate, which came with ghalbi, meat jun and grilled chicken. The ghalbi was excellent and that's what earns it a four-star rating from me. Really good grilled flavor. The meat jun is like an omelet and it was nice too. The grilled chicken was petty much standard grilled chicken.\nIsland Style is a fusion Korean and Hawaiian restaurant and I guess that showed in my meal with the inclusion of macaroni salad with the meat and steamed rice. It was nice, too. There were only two banchan dishes, white radish kim chee and cabbage kim chee. But the dishes were quite large for banchan. The white radish kim chee was a stand out. It was a pretty good version. The kim chee at Island Style is not especially spicy but still good.\nIf I were to go back, I'd skip the combo and just order a plate of ghalbi. But it looks like there's other good things on the menu, too."

The day was cold, dreary, and rainy. The service definitely brightened up my party's day. \n\nI am always craving Korean food and was looking for something on this side of town to meet Katrina M. for her lunch break. My sister and I got there early, so I took the liberty of ordering for everyone. Our very enthusiastic server, and most likely owner, came over to point out some suggestions. Combo plate ($9.90) comes with rice, mac salad,  kalbi, meat jun, and BBQ chicken. Sold, you had me at kalbi. Everything else was an added bonus. Chicken is one of those meats that can be dry, boring, and rarely the highlight of a meal. At Island, it definitely is a contender. Juicy and flavorful. The meat jun was intriguing. A thin slice of beef that has been thrown in an egg batter and browned. It is the first time I have ever had this and it was my sister's favorite off the plate. Brown rice is an option on their menu. We got it subbed instead of regular white and there was no charge. Bonus points! We had also got the bibimnaengmyeon ($9.90). A cold buckwheat noodle tossed in a spicy sweet sauce with radish, cucumber, half a hard boiled egg, and beef slices. I am glad they keep this even in winter. I am usually all for seasonal specialties, but forget that when it comes to this dish. In Korea, this item usually disappears once summer is over. Luckily, not here in Vegas. We had also got the seafood soondubu ($8 something). Bubbling hot, large chunks of tofu, plenty of seafood, and a raw egg dropped in. All good signs... but no kick. I love it best when it possesses a spiciness that can only be remedied with a spoonful of rice. All the dishes come with beansprouts, radish, and cabbage kimchi. The last two items had the same issue, but they were fresh. \n\nEveryone vowed to come back and try some of the other dishes on the large menu. Even after lunch, I was eyeing the loco moco for next time. \n\nHot tea is also complimentary. That is worthy of a mention as well."

He sent me to Island Style, and I'm glad he did.  IS serves Hawaiian specialties like loco moco & saimin, but they also offer traditional Korean dishes like stone pot bibimbap & mandu.  Its located on W. Sahara & Las Verdes, not too far west from Palace Station.\n\nWe ordered pan fried mandu ($7.95 for 8 pieces), large won ton mein ($11.95), fried rice ($11.95), fried saimin w/ spam & kamaboko, and stone pot bibimbap ($11.95).  Banchan is included in the meal.    Sorry, only the mandu, banchan, and bibimbap are pictured.  BTW, come hungry because the portions are big here.\n\nFirst of all, the mandu were very good.  They were packed w/ fillings, and crisped nicely:  4 Stars.  Likewise, the won ton mein came in a huge bowl, and was filled w/ tons of chewy noodles & mandu.  It was the largest bowl of won ton mein I have ever seen:  4 Stars.  Thirdly, my friend who ordered the fried rice doesn't eat much.  However, he killed the massive plate.  I had a bite and it was pretty tasty:  4 Stars.  Fourthly, the fried saimin was also ono (tastes good).  It had a lot of spam & kamaboko, and the noodles had a nice chew to them:  4 Stars.\n\nThe banchan was all very good, with the exception of the hot dog.  My rec would be to grill it longer, or pickle them to give them some uniqueness.  BTW, the kimchee must be good, because some local Koreans bought some to eat at home:  4 Stars.  On the other hand, the bibimbap was excellent.  The portion didn't look that large, but I could barely finish.  Additionally, the dish stayed hot throughout the meal, and the rice crisped up perfectly:  5 Stars.\n\nRegarding the ambiance, its a total hole in the wall.  My friends even wondered if it was open.  Nonetheless, the restrooms are clean:  3 Stars.  Surprisingly, the service was very good and friendly.  They really made you feel at home here:  5 Stars.\n\nMahalo nui loa (TY very much) braddah Nelson.  Da grinds were da kine (the food was very good).  I was happy to find good Azn food that was not on Spring Mountain Rd.  Its worth a drive from the strip where overpriced, mediocre & fake Azn food abounds."

Myself and a few coworkers came here today, and not a single one of us wasn't impressed.\n\nFirst off, the kimchi is bomb here.  I can usually leave out the kimchi, but that's only because so many places in Vegas have mediocre kimchi.  Not this kimchi.  You'll get this as an appetizer, so even if you are not a kimchi person you have to try it.  Our server (the owner?) sensed my coworker's enthusiasm over the kimchi, being the kimchi fanatic that he is, and complimented us some dumplings.  Off the hook.  The crust was kind of thick, but not greasy at all.  The meat was delicious, great spice and herb flavor.  A good sign of things to come...\n\nI ordered the Hot Rock Bi Bim Bap.  Friggin tasty.  Quality beef, super fresh veggies, and really nice Kochujang(?) sauce.  The Kochujang was slightly sweet but not too sweet, and subtly flavored.  What set this dish apart for me was the high quality for just around $10.00.  Oh, and don't forget the crystallized rice grains at the bottom. Despite gorging myself on refills of kimchi, I couldn't stop eating the Bi Bim Bap until every last rice grain was gone.  Just a great version of this classic Korean dish!\n\nI also managed to taste my friend's bulgolgi.  I normally don't like bulgolgi because it is always tough and overly sauced.  Not this bulgolgi, which is the best I have ever had.  VERY tender, and expertly seasoned.  The sauce was light and of a homemade quality.  Just delicious!\n\nAgain, special thanks to Jade and the other Yelpers.  I don't know why it has taken me so long to try Island Style.  If you don't know if you like Korean food, this is the place to try it.  If you don't always feel like Korean food, this is the place to go when you do.  If you are a Korean food snob, give Island Style a try and let me know what you think!"

Very generous portion and prompt and friendly service! I gave 4 stars. I saw a couple of things that prevented me for giving it a 5.\nI was trying to figure out why some tables didnt get the same selection of banchan. The Korean customers were automatically given the full assortment of banchan as a greeting shortly after being seated and even before their order was taken. We, on the other hand were first asked what we wanted to order then we only got kimchi, radish kimchi and the onions and yellow radish pickle with black dipping sauce. Far less than what I saw other tables had. I guess my amerasian features were mistaken as being Caucasian and my Korean mother from another asian country?  The table across from us had the same noodles and they received several banchan side dishes. Im wondering if the Korean customers are given the full selection of banchan because they expect it so they give good service to them. Ive been to other korean restaurants and it doesnt matter what you order from the menu every table was presented with same banchan. My mother even noticed it and asked me , \" why didnt she give us bean sprouts and the other dishes too?\"\nThe other turnoff was after some customers finished eating and left and before the buser came to clear off the dirty dishes a server went to the table and picked up ONLY the bowl of boiled peanuts and took them up to the front counter area. The front counter is high so I couldnt see what she did with them. I found it very odd why she did not take a few dirty dishes to clear off the table at the same time.  I am wondering if she pulled the uneaten boiled peanuts to be put back into a container to be served again. I've heard mexican restaurants doing the same thing with chips. \nWith these observations, I wont be making a return visit from the NW anytime soon."

The lady makes really good water kimchee- which you HAVE to eat with the moolnaengmyun. um...I think they have soju there too?

I ordered grilled chicken (came with rice and macaroni salad) and hubby had chicken Katsu (again with rice and macaroni salad). We also had to order 4 of the fried Mandu.

Weil \n\nA wonderful spot for great tasting food on a no-frills budget.\n\nWe came to Island Style looking for Jajangmyun (Wheat noodles in a black bean sauce) and Seafood Jangpong (Wheat noodles with spicy broth)...we found really good versions of both of these dishes as well as some other pleasantries.\n\nThe Jajangmyun was made with love. I tasted exactly how I imagine my Korean grandma would make it...if of course, I had a Korean grandmother... Needless-to-say it was great! Jajangmyun is a highly pleasing dish. The black bean provides great flavor, but also makes for a nice thick sauce--coating the noodles as well as your tongue...and who doesn't enjoy the occasional tongue coating? I enjoyed this dish more than the Seafood Jangpong, but the Jangpong was pleasing too with all kinds of seafood swimming in a delightfully spicy broth.\n\nThe service this night was on point--attentive of our needs and even fulfilling some of them before we realized there was a need...recommendations, drinks, utensils, side dishes, condiments, to-go boxes...everything taken care of. The banchan (side dishes) were a little more hit and miss then I am used to, but these rotate, and the overall experience more than made up for this area.\n\nThis certainly not a place that would draw me in on its own. The fa\u00e7ade is simple and cheap looking. The interior is modest as well. But the food is priced according to the humble appearance of the restaurant, not the quality of food. As such, it is a welcome spot in my rotation."

Also, where else can you get korean AND hawaiian food?? If you're debating between a couple places, this is the one to choose. \n\nOn the recommendation of the owner, we ordered the manju (dumplings) fried, the combo plate with teriyaki chicken, kalbi, and meat jun (marinated meat topped with egg), and the fried saipan. The dumplings were really good...juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside with a delicious sauce to dip in. The combo plate came with macaroni salad and we added the spam fried rice to it (definitely do it). All of the meats on the combo plate were tasty and I'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting to try a lot of different items on the menu. The fried saipan was good, but I would probably try something else when I come back since it didn't blow me away. Along with the meal, there's a couple banchan (side dishes), which were pickled daichon, kimchi, and fried hot dog pieces. All of these were well made as well.\n\nIn terms of the service, it was as if I was at my aunt or grandma's house... we were hooked up with an extra dumpling on the manju plate to make sure that each person had an equal number of dumplings at our table. When our water ran out, we were given bottled water at no charge. Also, our Hawaiian Sun drink was on the house. The owner also gave us a sample of the saipan noodle soup, which was delicious and contained no oil whatsover, a rarity these days. At the end of the meal, we were given hot tea on the house as well in to-go cups. Can't say enough about the treatment of customers here. Amazing."

I think even those who don't like pork may like the dish. \n\nWhat I am most impressed by was the servers. Through out the meal we were helped by thee different servers constantly. They were very observant of all our needs and were so quick to respond to our requests whether that be needing more forks or napkins.

We had the homemade mandoo because we saw the lady making them last time.  The meat jun was on the tough side.  I think the beef needs to be sliced thinner for that.  \n\nMy main complaint is with the kim chee.  It was slimy and not very hot or flavorful.

I personally have never ventured to the Chinese part of the menu so you are on your own with that. I come here for the Hawaiian-Korean food and nothing else! \n\nFirst off they hook you up with a tray of boiled peanuts as soon as you sit down. I'd come here just for the boiled peanuts during football season. \nThey also provide you with 3-4 plate of ban chan that also have a Hawaii flavor to them as well. One of the non-traditional ban chan that is one of my favorites is the chopped hot dog and onions. I remember eating this all the time when I was a kid.. It  strikes a chord with 8 year old Pat. The rest of the ban chan is your typical Korean fare consisting of kim chee variations and other pickled goodies.\n \nMy default order:\nPan fried mandoo a custom mixed plate: \nKalbi, Meat Jun and Chicken Katsu .\nThe rock star of the combo is the Mean Jun! Great meat to egg ratio and killer sauce!\nI can say that their Meat Jun is my favorite in the valley!\nOn occasion the lady gets the Jajangmyeon (hope that's the right spelling) which is  \n\nThis place has become our default Hawaiian-Korean spot.\n\nGo see Uncle Russell and fam to satisfy your K-808 cravings\n\nAloha \n\n-P"

I wanted to speak with a manager to inquire about a charge on my credit card, and she just said 'manager not here' and hung up on me. I called back to find out when the manager or if anyone could help me and she yelled like my mother would yell at me asking how I know about the restaurant and how could I have been charged if I haven't been there. What? I just told her I ate there a few days ago. Anyway she yelled again that she is busy and hung up on me again.  They were super friendly taking my money but when there is an issue they certainly don't care.  I ate here twice. Both times the black bean noodles were way too greasy (was trying to give it another try).  The champon seafood noodle soup was ok but just because you throw in a bunch of seafood it doesn't impress me if it isn't quality.  The kimchi fried rice was ridiculously salty so I just took it home and mixed white rice with it.  I think the great reviews exist due to personal taste, and Hawaiian style food is usually cultural not something most people like.  It's not like Italian or sushi where quality is a must, because from reading some reviews about this Island restaurant, quality is not a standard...cockroaches and dirty diapers? Definitely not appetizing."

From the outside, the place looks sketchy. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the clean and inviting dining area once we walked in the door. \n\nFor lunch, I chose the Moco-Loco which was layered with steamed rice, a hamburger patty, a fried egg, and brown gravy. I asked for my egg scrambled, not fried. Oh well - I ate it anyways. The dish was good--not great. \n\nMy wife tried the Korean noodle dish-Japchae. We didn't like the texture of the noodles they used for this dish. Imagine the texture of gummi bears while eating noodles. Because they were so spongy, no flavor stuck to them. Who wants to eat plain spongy noodles? Not this guy....\n\nMy parents were with us since they were visiting from the Bay Area. They both chose the bibimbap (spelling?) which was a bowl of rice, vegetables, beef, an egg, and spices. The beef inside these bowls was bland, tough, and fatty. Oh, and the side of macaroni salad was way too salty.\n\nThe service was spotty. For example, I didn't like that our entrees were coming out one at a time -every 5 minutes.  Plus, I was not offered a drink refill at all during lunch.  The more I write this review, the more I realize I don't really like anything about this place."

Went in, it was quite busy. an old lady greeted me while she was cleaning tables. But she didnt really say if I should just get a table myself or wait for someone to have me seated. After about 2mins of standing there, i finally came up to her while she was still cleaning a table and ask, she was like \"for here to go?\" I said for here and she said, oh ok please have a seat (while pointing on a table for 4 on the corner). Sat down and a young lady came up, gave me the menu, and ask what I wanna drink. Her smile was very welcoming so I forgot about the earlier incident. A minute later an old man came up and brought my water, convincing me to try their iced tea instead. But no thank you, im good with iced water. He was very friendly and the whole time i was there, he kept checking on me, but never refilled my water. As for food, food is ok. A little pricey. I ate by myself but i felt like I paid for two. I had the combo which has kalbi, meat jun, and chicken that comes with white rice and mac.. Banchan doesnt have my fish cakes! Huhu. Banchan only consists of kimchi, cucumbers, and bean sprouts. I was so sad. I want my fish cake and tofu! lol. I didnt finish all the meat jun and chicken so i asked for a to go box. The old man came back with a to go box full of rice and he said \"for your dinner\" how nice of him! I wanna give this place 4 stars at least, but the food is too pricey, ive had kbbq on same average of taste and quality or better. Just a couple more bucks, i could have had an all u can eat kbbq."

I am almost positive that all the staff has a sixth sense--whenever you try to catch their attention, one of them is already on your way to take care of needs.\n\nThe two dishes we ordered were black bean noodle and spicy seafood soup. The portions were as big as I remember and the taste was as good as I was hoping. We shared both dishes and had enough leftovers for the next day.\n\nI am so happy that we finally stepped into Island Style and we will certainly come back to try other Korean-Chinese dishes."

I'll admit that the $17 kalbi plate with 4 slices of kalbi was a little more pricey than it should have been.  However, that was probably the only setback we had with this restaurant.  Even though we were only getting take-out, the service was awesome.  Employees were smiling, friendly to customers, and really turned \"just picking up some food\" to an experience which makes me want to try this place again (and wouldn't mind dine in).\n\nThis really is an island style Korean BBQ kinda place.  The plates even came with kimchee and mac salad.  Definitely worth going back for!"

I mean, talk about an owner taking pride in his business and giving his best. This is a total hole in the wall joint, but don't be fooled by its location or outside appearance. This is Korean Hawaiian fusion at its best!\n\nAs soon as we sat down, we were given menus and boiled peanuts to munch on while looking over the menu. Already, we're off to a good start! There is so much to choose from, so just go with what you're in the mood for.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nMusubi: SPAM on top of rice, all wrapped in nori. There is a special sauce in there, quite possibly with a little bit of crack in it. Crack sauce. I love it.\n\nYook gae jang: there is really nothing better that cures a hang-over than hot, spicy soup. This had all the right ingredients and the perfect amount of spice. I hate that some places skimp on the meat, or have wayyyy too much green onion, or whatever the case may be. But our soup had the right amount of each ingredient, which gets an A+ in my book.\n\nJjam Jja Myun (Jjajang myun and Jjambbong in a split dish): The best of both worlds! I love both noodle dishes, but hate wasting the food because we usually can't finish it all. But this way, you get half a serving of the Jjajang myun, and then half a serving of the Jjambbong.\n\nLoco Moco: this heart attack waiting to happen is rice, hamburg steak, a fried egg, and then gravy poured all over the top. It's very heavy, very savory, but incredibly delicious! We opted to get our gravy on the side, so that we can limit how much gravy to pour over. I think it worked out for the best, so as not to overwhelm our taste buds with too much heaviness.\n\nBacktrack, I want to give some more kudos to the owner's son. He doesn't even need to say anything, just one look at him and you know that he is a kind and gentle soul who really just wants to provide excellent service to go along with the even more excellent meal. He noticed one of the girls in our group was very sick (she completely lost her voice, we later find out she had pneumonia!), so he brought some hot tea, lemon and honey...without her even asking. I just think that's the kind of service that's hard to find these days -- where they offer to bring or give something without you asking for it first. I really felt like he cared about our experience in his restaurant, whether just the overall experience or the quality and taste of the food. Thanks for one of the best meals we had in Vegas!"

This hole-in-the-wall is nestled amongst the seedy massage parlors and stripper clothing stores. GPS led me right to it. They are opening a new location at Spring Mtn. and Rainbow this week, so try that one if you're looking for more ambiances. \n\nKorean food in Vegas is usually sub par and way over priced. This place was a complete surprise and a wonderful new experience. Not a place to take a first date, but a great place for home-style Korean and Hawaiian food. The menu said fusion, but the dishes were not really fused. Korean food was just like mom makes, and the Hawaiian food was just like I've had in Hawaii. Didn't see anything like Moco Kim-chee bap. \n\nMy group of 5 enjoyed everything we ordered. Here is the breakdown:\n\nMe - I ordered the Loco Moco. Although I've only had it at chain stores like L&L and Ono Hawaiian, I can say that Island Style's is hands down the BEST. The gravy is awesome. It is Loco Moco, so I'm definitely going to gain a few lbs from it, but it wasn't as heavy as the chain versions. Highly recommend. \n\nWife - Soon Du Boo. Excellent. Just like the local spots in L.A. Very authentic. \n\nDaughter (6yrs old) - Spam and eggs. \"Yummeee!!\". If you like Spam and eggs, how can they get it wrong? \n\nSister - Curry lover say the curry is as close to home made as she's had. She is so picky that she doesn't even like Curry House. \n\nMom - Madu Guk. Even my mom was impressed with the taste. She said it tasted really homemade. \n\nOverall a wonderful place to stop to get a great meal that tastes very authentic.  Husband is from Hawaii, and the wife id Korean, so they really know what they're doing. The fact that the menu had both styles made me real nervous, but the tastes were not sacrificed in any way. The hospitably was top notch. Both the husband and wife were super friendly and overly generous with the side dishes, tea, boiled peanuts, and even gave a dish of fried wontons for us to sample. The kim-chee was super authentic and the pickled cucumber was awesome. As soon as we got close to finishing a dish, they brought out another heaping dish. \n\nEnjoy!!"

Better than the first...\n\nIt's definitely the laid-back Hawaiian casual dining you'd find in the Islands, serving awesome Hawaiian & Korean food. \n\nPrices seem a little bit higher than their competitors, but you easily forget that when your food arrives. The portions are big, plentiful side dishes, and a vast menu, consisting of Loco Moco, fried rice, spam & eggs, to traditional Korean dishes like Bi Bim Bap, spicy tofu soup, and Kalbi. \n\nLast time I was there, I intended to get take-out. The staff greeted me warmly and saw that I had a grocery bag with me as I looked at the menu. They politely suggested I eat there, and offered to keep my milk chilled in their side fridge. Is that awesome or what?!?! I did end up eating there, ordered the Bi Bim Naeng Myun/Kalbi Combo, and took most of it home. How great was that for them to offer?!\n\nService I received both visits were great, very friendly, and the staff always thanked and welcomed the customers back soon when they got up to leave. \n\nThis is a no-frills casual hole-in-the-wall.

But as soon as I opened the door, the place was humming with activity - a rather surprising sight.  What can I say about a place that offers not 2 but 3!!! different types of cuisine -- and all my favorites!!!  You have your Korean, then you get the Chinese Korean menu and finally Hawaiian!!! all in one single stop!  The place is run by a family and it appears everyone from the family works there - father, mother and 2 sons (they looked alike).  I'm pretty sure they were Koreans originally from Hawaii -- there's that island infused look they have.   \n\nI had the Korean naeng mein and garbi ribs combo plus a spam musubi.  It wasn't the best naeng mein, garbi or the musubi I had.  What makes this place special is that it has a home made feel to everything.  The garbi, definitely was marinated \"island\" style.

They were really good it had just the right amount of spice in it. \n\nThe Kalbi combo came with macaroni salad and white rice. The portions are pretty big so I ended up taking half of it home. The Kalbi was nice and tender and the mac salad was tasty. I also liked the fact they served regular hamburgers so my husband can eat something that is familiar to him. When I usually take him to Asian places to eat and he orders a hamburger they usually taste sweet which he finds awkward . He says the burger and fries here are good and they are cheap too!"

It's in a schlocky strip mall which had me slightly skeptical upon arrival. Walking in the place was pretty warm and there were flies flying around. The owner said he would be right over and the natives stared @ us. As we waited a few minutes I started to worry that this was going to be a miss. (I understand Nathan Y's review) However, once the food started flying and the owner began razz-ma-tazzing with my party, we had a great time and meal.\n\n~ Loved the boiled peanuts\n~ Loved the veggie apps: bean sprouts, Napa cabbage and turnups, he brought us a second batch.\n~ My teenage nephews (human garbage cans, or robotic eating machines, take your pick) were tapping uncle with the gut-bombs that were fried rice and 5 egg omelets.\n~ My bro had the combo plate with the ribs, chicken & egg mixture. He said he would order it again.\n~ I had the Teriyaki Pork. I had to ask what cut it was, I thought belly since it was thin and like bacon. It's pork loin cut really thin and marinated. It was one of the best pork dishes I've ever had. It has a sweet taste, it eats like candy. Really, really good & I don't care for sweet dishes by and large.\n\nGreat place, that is a hike, but worth the hike. Very cool owner working the front while his wife cooks in back. 5 stars for the food. The place itself would be a hole without the food and owners jivin' & cookin'."

Both are very good by the way.  They have gotten more staff to handle the added tables and the Hawaiian/Korean stuff is great as always and her sides (bonchon) are great.

He is always very sweet and always makes you feel like you are coming home.  The food is amazing and you get good portions as well.  You are always treated like family when you go there, no matter who you are.  We ordered the Meat Jun which comes with rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. This is a must have.

The kind lady that runs the place is Korean and tends to make your food more \"Korean\" (if that even makes sense) if she knows that you are Korean. \n\nThe food is FREAKING awesome. A bit on the sweet side, but I seriously can't complain. Had the mul-bi naeng myun (buckwheat noodles 2-ways: one spicy, one with cold broth), the summer noodles, the spam fried rice.

From Asian Pacific Islanders to East Coasters know that the best places to get your taste buds a fix is that the least suspecting places. This hole in the wall offers not just home run flavor Korean but also many Hawaiian favorites from Chicken Katsu to boiled peanuts. Me & my family have always been big Korean fans and finding a good place in Las Vegas has been hard for quite some time, but when we discovered Island Style we find ourselves stepping in their doors anytime we crave Korean food. \n\n The Kalbi is excellent, but my favorite is the Meat Jun! They have plenty of tasty appetizers to pick from, large portions, reasonably prized, and the owners are so friendly! They are always either helping customers or working in the kitchen and their dedication has payed off! Everything I order here is consistently great, and the owners are so friendly they offer great help in making a good choice. \n\n I have some Vegan & Vegetarian friends and as much as I love this place it probably wouldn't be my first choice seeing as how it's a largely meat based menu. Overall I back this place hard with 5 stars & if you're local and haven't tried you are missing the boat! Wether it's just you & a friend, or you & a family it's very accommodating and much more spacious than it looks. All this talk is making me crave some Boiled Peanuts & Chicken Katsu, I must fix this ASAP. Hope you enjoy your visit to Island Style!"

A must try for the newbies out their is the meatjun, fantastic! They recently added a Chinese Menu which, unfortunately, makes it much more difficult to decide what to eat.  If you aren't sure what you're appetite is feeling like, the server an owners spend more than enough time to explain everything on the menu. \n\nSeating is sometimes limited due to locals who eat here on a daily basis but do not fear, expansion is near! The owners informed me that they will be expanding the restaurant this year to maximize seating occupancy! If you do find yourself waiting for a table however, the servers treat you with their famous boiled peanuts as an appetizer for the wait. They are also very attentive to their customers and always work quick to keep their customers satisfied.\n\nLast tip. If you see the owners son (cute boy with the nose piercing) say hello!

They bring it out accompanied with a sampler plate of kim chi which consisted of cabbage, bean sprouts, some kind of radish, and sliced hot dogs? As for the Teriyaki Beef, they actually give you a decent amount of beef and rice. (refer to my pic). \n\nI probably would of enjoyed my meal better if I got a refill or two on my water.

This place is located at the middle of a line of shopping stores, it will take an extra second to find it but not hard following the gps.  Also since it is in Vegas, all the windows got black screens to block the Sun, so you wouldn't be able to look inside, I had to double checked the sign few times before I walked in.  \n\nIt is a little warm inside but it is in the middle of the summer in Vegas.  The waitress gave me 2 menus and when she found out that I was eating by myself she was surprised and started to talk to me.  I told her I visited Korea a while back and how much I loved Korea, she told me to find a Korean girlfriend and move to Korea. Very friendly and funny, then I decided to get the cold noodle soup.  The soup was really good, almost as good as the one I had in Korea.  Since I been back to the States I tried few the same dish in different locations in California but they were a bit disappointing.  \n\nI really want to try the black beans noodle but I will give that a try next time.  Actually there are many items on the menu that I want to try.  Great food with friendly staff, I will come back for sure."

While Island Style's menu certainly  holds its own against its competition, its true advantage lies in its affable, long-time owner, Russell.  His enthusiasm for his offerings is as unprecedented as it is well-deserved.  My family and I have enjoyed nearly every item on his menu, and we have yet to be disappointed.  During our most recent visit, Russell even went so far as to invite us to call him if we ever would like to try to cook one of his specialties at our home in Houston.  Not a chance!  We shall continue to let the master do his work in the kitchen while we sip hot tea and eat boiled peanuts in his dining room.  Do not be fooled by the storefront and off-strip location.  Island Style is the best bet that you will ever make in Las Vegas."

There was no L & L those days, so we'd have to make the trek all the way up Sahara to get here.  Short story long, no matter strong my craving, it was tough to get here and it was lost to memory.\n\nFast forward to 2010 and, thanks to Yelp and Misti Y, this place is back on my radar.  It's still a haul from my hood, but I HAD to give it a try.  Walking in the door was, well, strange.  It looked and felt completely different.  Gone was the darkness (not sure if they even turned on the lights back in the day), the drink cooler up front and the booths.  Apparently, three renovations makes a difference.\n\nAnyway, enough with the memories and down to business: the food.  There were four adults and two kids in our party, so we took the big table up close to the counter.  We were readily greeted with boiled peanuts and juices for the kids (it was pretty amazing to watch how an entire can of juice can make kids bounce of walls).  We were also brought never-ending dishes of different types of kim chee, which always seemed to be empty when I looked for it.  The mandoo was especially tasty, definitely not the kind you get from the market.  Our meals were onolicious and no one left hungry or a plate empty.  \n\nI like this place, but it's so far out of my normal eating radius.  I hope to be back before another 16 years elapses."

Then like as if Russell reads minds, he brought us over a kimchee soup to try- that was pretty good and I gotta order that sometime when I'm feeling like soupy.

            "review": "\"MAH SHI SUH!\"     \"ONO!\"\n\nI just haadd to say \"delicious\" in both Korean and Hawaiian. \n\nIsland Style is quite the hole-in-the-wall. Now I am aware they have added a new location in the Greenland Supermarket food court, but I urge you to try it's original location first. It's a little mom and pop restaurant located in the middle of an older business complex. It seems very modest from the outside, as the small establishment is covered by highly reflective film on its storefront. Nonetheless, from the moment you walk in, there's a overwhelming feeling of coziness. It is furnished nicely with wood flooring and homely decorations, which provide a nice and warm environment to eat in. It reminds me of being in someones own kitchen, especially since the owners are extremely genuine and welcoming. \n\nOn to the goodies. I've been here several times, and it's often a struggle to decide whether to choose something from the Korean menu or the Hawaiian side. Both are equally solid. I have a few favorites on the Korean side, the stand-outs being the Casseroles and the Cold Buckwheat Noodle soup (Neng Myuhn), which is THE BEST IN TOWN. I live in the far Southwest side of town, and when I get a craving for Neng Myuhn, I take the 20 minute drive without hesitation. For those of you who haven't had this dish, you might be a little intrigued over a noodle-based soup that is served... well, cold. It is mainly a summer dish, but plenty still enjoy it throughout the colder seasons. The ingredients are fairly simple. The soup consists of a beef broth, is chilled, the served with thin and stringy buckwheat noodles. The garnishes are what really tie this dish together; sliced lean beef brisket, julienned cucumber, sliced Asian pears, pickled radish, and half of a hard-boiled egg adorned with sesame seed sprinkles. You are also presented with white vinegar and hot Korean mustard paste, both are things that I add to mine. The reason why Island Style's Buckwheat Noodle soup reigns supreme is because their broth is perfectly seasoned and the noodles glutinous texture is just right, or \"al dente\", if you will. If you haven't had this yet, and are a fan of Korean cuisine, I strongly suggest you try this, regardless of the temperature outside.\n\nIsland Style's Hawaiian fare also delivers, and it's apparent because this place is frequented by Vegas's local Hawaiians. I've tried most of their offerings, which consist of the usual favorites. My personal go-to dish tends to be the mixed plate, with the Meat Jun often being the first to disappear from my plate. I do recall them having a few specialty Hawaiian items on Thursdays, such as Kalua Pork & Cabbage and Ahi Poki which were delightful as well. \n\nThere really isn't much else to add, except.... BOILED PEANUTS?! OMNOMNOMNOM. Oh and the Fried Mandu (Pork Dumplings) are also worthy of being labeled best in town. Hand-made daily.\n\nAnyways, Island Style never fails to provide a quality meal in warm, homely atmosphere by owners who really seem to enjoy taking care of their local, and first time customers."

Lol. \n\nit's a small place, and easy to miss when your driving down sahara in traffic and all the construction. Once we got there, it was not busy, a quiet relaxing place to have a meal. They got a wide screen tv w/ the basketball game on. \n\nWe were greeted and served by the owner. He got the pidgin accent. I love that, always make me feel like I'm back home. the menu is simple, that's good for people like me who can love everything on the menu and have a hard time deciding what to get. \n\nThis is the first place I've been to that has fish jun! My favorite Korean-Hawaiian dish is meat jun, but I wanted to try this. I'm the adventurous type so I always like to try new things. \n\nI like the appetizers here. It's different than other Korean restaurants. They got the kimchee, pickled potatoes?, and some other ones. They were all soooo good! I couldn't eat a lot of it, so I stuffed the rest in my take out box hehe. My friends didn't care for it, lucky me... I had it all to myself! \n\nI appreciate it when the owners are able to serve and chat a little bit with us. it seems humble. \n\nI told him I love meat jun, but this is the first time I've had fish jun. He said the next time we come in he'll make zucchini jun for us, right on!!! it's not on the menu. \n\nThe meat jun is pretty good, but Soon's meat jun  in salt lake, Oahu, Hawai'i tops my list. but this will be my go to spot for anything jun in Vegas. \n\nOh yah, I like that they give a delicious tea at the end of your meal, no charge. :)\n\nOne con is that it's a bit of a drive for me coming from east Henderson. maybe that's another reason why I've haven't heard about this place.\n\nThey've got other locations in Vegas, but this is the one to go to. Others have tried the other locations, and all said it's not the same!"

My daughter had musubi while I tried the mixed grill plate. The banchan was fresh, spicy and a wonderful prelude to the entrees. The mixed grill plate was the epitome of what grilled meat should be; juicy yet crispy and full of flavor. This was the first time i had tried meat jun and that egg covered steak was uniquely satisfying, will definitely order it again. The service was attentive despite the number of people being served."

After an appetizer of fried mandoo and the usual banchan I had the combo plate (meat jun, kalbi and BBQ chicken) and he went with the roast beef and gravy plate lunch. Neither one of us left anything on the plate when we finished. Yes, its that good!\n\nRussell, the owner is a very friendly person choke full of the 'aloha spirit' and it rubs off on the wait staff as well. We didn't have to wait very long for our meals - I'd say it was already piping hot and on our table in less than ten minutes.\n\nDefinitely a must eat place in Sin City - and you got a customer for life!

Hawaiian food and the iconic plate lunch is NOT Korean take out with four choices of vegetables.\n2.  Stop throwing pineapples on everything and calling it \"Hawaiian\".\n3.  Just because they say it on Hawaii Five-0, calling me \"brah\" or asking if I \"hang ten\" does not make you cool, it just makes you sound stupid.\n\nHow does it stack up?\n\nExcluding the more traditional Korean items, these are island flavors.  Heavy handed on the salt and MSG, lots of sweetened shoyu (soy sauce) infused with ginger and garlic marinades.  Portions are West coast sensible, no two pound plate lunch.\n\nKalbi, meat jun, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken all greasy, oily, and deeply flavored.  Two scoops rice, macaroni salad, some Korean style veg.  Done.  Hawaii Yeeps, think Yummys.\n \nA bowl of saimin (not ramen) with slices of spam, egg, kamaboko maybe some won ton and green onion in a supercharged MSG based bonito broth taste like Shiro's.

Island Style was easy to find, there was plenty of parking, the outside looked kinda scary but I wasn't going to let that stop me from my new culinary adventure. Inside was full of tables to pick from that later on became occupied. The server which I think was the owner was super nice and greeted as very quickly with water and a bowl of boiled peanuts. I'm allergic but I tried the peanuts, they were tasty and salty. \n\nThe menu was sorta divided with Hawaiian/Korean dishes. I ordered some crunchy mandu to start with; they are meat filled half shaped moon dumplings that resemble Japanese gioza, they were very flavorful. Our server arrived with four Korean side dishes of unexpected banchan. The banchan included kimchi, radish cubes kimchi style, mung bean sprouts, and vienna sausages. I decided to order the famous bulgogi which I haven't had in more than 4 years since my last trip to Korea. The bulgogi was right on point just like I've had it in the past but smothered in onions which I just pushed to the side. I also got to try the katsu chicken, it was so good and crunchy, I didn't care too much for the sauce but it was decent. Both entrees came with a side of rice and macaroni salad. \n\nThis place was way tastier than Island Flavor, their macaroni salad was to die for, it wasn't bland at all. Our server came to check on us and asked us if we wanted refills on the banchan! Anywhere else they charge you but not this awesome joint. We were even offered hot tea but it was kinda warm inside so we skipped it. I can defenately keep coming back to this place. I want to try the musubi and kalbi ribs next time."

When we pulled up into the sketchy parking lot of Island Style, my husband had some hesitation and suggested we go somewhere else.  But, I told him that people I trusted on Yelp recommended it- so let's just take a look.  Well, when we opened the door- we were welcomed by the owner, Russell like we were \"ohana\"- and the place was pretty packed with Korean, Filipino, and Hawaiian diners. \n\nI am so glad we stepped inside because it truly reminded me of my favorite family owned restaurants in Hawaii! I ordered the combo plate and instantly fell in love with the Meat Jun.  It was my first time trying it, and it will definitely not be my last.  My husband ordered the Stone-Pot Bimimbap and said it was the best he has ever had.  We also ordered a couple Spam Musubi because I can't eat hawaiian food without having some good ol' spam, and the seaweed wrapper was perfectly crunchy. Throw in some delicious good sized plates of banchan- and we were a happy bunch.  If I didn't show some restraint, I would have filled up completely on the kimchi (which is homemade by his wife). \n\nRussell's friendly hospitality was awesome. He even offered to change the TV channel to some cartoons for our toddler- but I told him to leave it on Jeopardy because if she is watching TV, she won't eat. We chatted a bit, and he told us that his wife runs the Island Style at Greenland Market.  Well, the next day- we actually made a trip down to Greenland- and my husband ordered a plate of Meat Jun just for himself this time and loved every bite!"

The place is simple and no-frills but the food tastes like home cooking and the portions are large. The owner was very courteous and friendly. We had Cha Chang myun, (noodles are made fresh) mapo tofu, and bulgogi which comes with Cham pong (spicy soup) not to mention all the pan chan that is on the house.

If you are Hawaiian-Korean and you are looking for some meat jun, banchan, bulgogi, kalbi, kimchee, with some local dishes like loco moco, katsu, spam and eggs, etc. this is the place for you.  This is old style local fusion (not to be confused with Roy's or Sam Choy).  Service is friendly.  It is great for the Hawaii-style food but it is no 5 star.  But I like it recommend it."

I'm always greeted with some boiled peanuts (yum!) and some water or green tea while I wait for my food.\n\nI've been on the search for some good hamburger steak/loco moco and I do have to say, it is one of the best that I've tasted here in Vegas.  The gravy tastes homemade, not from powder like most. And the hamburger is yummy, but a bit overdone.  I need to remember to ask for it to be cooked medium.  Even with my drive home clear across town, the egg is always perfectly over easy.\n\nAlso, the have some super delicious fried noodles.  That is also a hard thing to find out here.  Whatever we order, we ALWAYS have to have an order of fried noodles to go with our food.  Most places seem to use a lesser quality noodles when making this, but yours is perfect!!\n\nWe're still making our way through the menu, but so far, everything has been great!"

Koreatown... etc.\n\nBut I was thoroughly impressed with Island Style.\n\nWe didn't end up ordering a lot of the Hawaiian style food, but next time I do want to try the meat jun or the loco moco.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered naengmyuns and his sister ordered a dolsot (stone pot) bibimbap. It was a hot day! The naengmyun was delicious and so refreshing!!! I really enjoyed it. The bibimbap wasn't bad either. She didn't add in the gochujang (sweet spicy Korean chili sauce) at first because she was intimidated by the deep red spicy-looking color, but once she did, she loved it.\n\nWe also ordered a short rib side to share. It wasn't the Korean style galbi I craved with my naengmyun (gal-naeng, anybody?!?), but it was still good.\n\nThe banchans were all good as well. And of course, the boiled peanuts were awesome. Flavored just right.\n\nIt's definitely a place for the locals. I kind of felt out of place, being from out of town.\n\nThe service was on and off. Some of the servers were attentive and good. But the server that took our order completely forgot the sweet and sour pork (tangsooyook) my boyfriend wanted. We ended up cancelling that order because it just never came out. Also, I felt that the Korean workers were nicer to the Koreans. Even though I am Korean, I spoke English to the non-Koreans I was with and I felt that it cost me some quality service. But what can you expect... that's how most Korean restaurants are anyways."

Checks in with you to see if your OK and he even shook my hand and said thank you when I left. This is how it should be at every dining establishment.

They provide boiled peanuts in the beginning on top of the regular banchan! There's also barley tea at times. \n\nThis place is pretty nostalgic for me. It popped my soon dubu cherry and I've been a fan of the dish ever since I tried it here! The owner is super friendly and unique with his Hawaiian-style hospitality. I haven't seen the son around recently but he used to work there and would pimp out my mul naengmyun with greens and spices! Good 'ol days.\n\nLately I've been going there for the mul naengmyun. My boyfriend loves the jjajangmyun there. They expanded as well, taking over the Hawaiian souvenier store next door. Some of the tables have become a cafeteria style where you may end up sitting next to strangers. I think it's kind of cute and nostalgic. \n\nIsland style is definitely a local favorite, having been here for so long and providing consistently awesome service and delicious food. My only gripe is that it's more expensive than most other Korean restaurants I go to but you know what to expect here. There are also TV's for your viewing pleasure. All in all a great family restaurant."

He recommended a bunch of dishes and ended up giving us a plate of deep fried mandu on the house! Turned out to be a ton of food for three people but that didn't stop him from giving us extra servings of mac salad. Towards the end of our meal he also gave us bottled water and otter pops for free.

I met Russell (the owner) by the end of my meal I wanted to call him Uncle. \nFirst I started with a nice helping of boiled peanuts then came the banchan all dishes were nice and cold. I didn't have time to finish all three before Uncle brought three more out. I eat the boiled peanuts slowly because I wanted to take the rest home, not knowing that Uncle had another batch for me to take away. I was able to have a late night snack when I got home. \nI don't think that I've ever seen boiled peanuts served other than in Florida (the south). A nice addition. \nI had the seafood soup. It came in a big bowl pipping hot with a big ladle and a cup of rice on the side. Uncle gave me instructions on how to put together the dish. It was a little spicy and the shrimp was a tad small but very filling. For under $10 bucks. The veg was crisp and clean. Would order it again. The broth was red so be careful slurping. \nI paid my check with a very pretty girl at the desk and was on the way out when Uncle brought a plate of cold sliced watermelon. We chatted about the menu and what I can order next time. Due to the fact that I don't eat meat. He was so warm and accommodating that I'm going to look Uncle up again this weekend. \nSo ,of you are looking for a down home place to kick back and feel like you are at someones kitchen table. This is the place, no frills but it hits the spot."

There were only a couple of tables open.  We ended up getting our food to-go.  While we were waiting to put our order in, we sat down at one of the tables since the whole place is tightly packed in with the maximum amount of tables they can stuff in the space without breaking fire code.  A server came up to us and asked us what we would like.  I ordered the Meat Jun, hubs ordered the chicken katsu and our 11 year ordered kalua pork and cabbage.  The server asked us also if we wanted a drink and hubs and daugher ordered Hawaiian Suns.  He even walked my daugher to the cooler to show her what they had so she can pick what she wanted.  I had Korean iced tea which I LOVE.  A couple more parties came in and ordered and all got their food before us.  I don't know if it's because we weren't Korean or because they were Korean or if it's because our food was harder to prepare?  Then, another server came up to us surprised like she didn't notice us the first 4-5 times she walked by us and gave us menus again.  We told her that we already ordered.  I thought that was funny.  \n\nWe finally get our order after about 20-25 minutes which normally I would mind, but we had really no place to be.  The orders were correct and everything was really good.  It was my first time trying meat jun and I think I will always order that there.  Hubs liked his chicken katsu and daughter liked her kalua pork.  She didn't finish it all, but she's a tiny 11-year-old.  \n\nI will be back, but I might take my Korean friends next time to see how much faster our orders go through.  Lol."

Bi bim bop hot pot--a stone pot with crunchy rice on the bottom, and piled with noodles, veggies, teriyaki beef, and an egg on top. I don't even like eggs but I had to go for it, mixed it all in, and I wasn't sorry. My friend had the beef jun--beef fried in a thin egg batter, unique and amazing. We were also plied with many appetizer things, just because: five different kinds of kimchi--including an extra fresh serving that the owner brought out, boiled peanuts (realllllly good), and we also ordered the fried potstickers--also done with their own unique crunchy goodness.\n\nThe service, brah. The SERVICE! From the moment me and my four pals came in, we were treated like friends. The owners took the time to ask us our preferences, explain stuff to us (because they could tell this was somewhat new to us), and brought out extra things when we reacted so gratefully to the other things they put on the table. And they just acted like we were their buds. It's been too long since I've had this kind of friendliness at a restaurant.\n\nThe vibe, mate, the viiiiiiibe. Yes, when you drive up you will look at the joint from the outside and say, \"Is this place open? Is this place even legit?\" (the window isn't see-through so it looks almost like it's being remodeled or something). But when you push through the door, everything changes: It's well-lit, clean and bright, and almost cozy. There's a happy greeting from the staff, and a comfortable hawaiian vibe.\n\nWe ate at many good places on our Vegas weekend, but this was the one where every so often when we were contemplating our next meal, someone would say, \"Hey we could always go back to Island Style...\" In fact, even before I was halfway through my hot pot, I was thinking about how and when I could come back again.  \n\nGo here. Unlike many other cheap eats, it's not a dive, it's not greasy, and the food isn't just good for the price. It's GOOD. \n\nYou won't be sorry. You'll just be delighted and full."

Kal bi and BBQ chicken was awesome.\n\nMy friend had the Hot Stone Bi Bim Bop. Never really saw that in Hawaii but they have it all over on the mainland. Very good as well. She loved it and she spent her hi school years in Korea (Dad was stationed there).\n\nThe owner was there working his butt off greeting and serving everyone in the place.\n\nNext time we're in town, we're skipping the strip and making it out here again.\nMahalo for making me less homesick."

I'm so happy that he introduced me to this simple yet super tasty dish that I have just fallen completely in love with.  Thank you Jeremy C.!  Every since I had it at 3 different restaurants in Oahu, I had to find one in Vegas.\n\nVerdict: Island Style does not disappoint.  It is almost as close to the meat jun served at Millions in Oahu.  Flavorful well season beef inside a hefty egg batter served over white rice or fried rice!  Don't forget to dip it in their tasty sauce for an amazing trip in your mouth!\n\nTheir dumplings here are a great appetizer too!  And the workers here; I believe a family that used to live in Oahu, are super nice and friendly.  We chopped it up with them about the Islands and food!  My boyfriend and I will definitely be back for the meat jun and to try their other menu items!  They're straight from Hawaii so I'm sure the rest of the food here is legit!  Yum!"

Not as good as Hawaii meat jun but since I live in Las Vegas this is as close as it gets. \n\nExtra stars for the fact that he remembered on my second visit that I like a side of siracha hot sauce.

            "review": "One of a must in any Korean community is the existence of a good jajangmyun and jamppong restaurants.  This is because, unlike most other Korean foods, these dishes are very difficult to replicate at home.  Many good cooks can whip up a good dwenjang jjigae, ddukbokki, or jun, and even more can fire up a kbbq or jungol on their portable gas grill that every Korean family owns.  But trying to perfect the sauces that are the catalysts for these two noodles so that they taste just like the ones from the old country, that is a monumental challenge.  For this reason, jajangmyun restaurants that make great sauces are known by every Korean in that community.  In Vegas, apparently there is Island Style.\n\nI guess to non-Koreans this is a Hawaiian place?  But in the Korean community, this place is known as Baek Li Hyang, a Korean-Chinese restaurant that serves up Jajangmyun, jamppong, and tang soo yook (sweet & sour pork, Korean style).  They also have other Korean dishes, one of which I noticed is the beef jun.  We were here specifically for the noodles, and thus ordered a dish of each.  Expectations were high because we heard consistently that this is the best Chinese noodle restaurant in the valley.  As a result, disappointment was also high as we realized that it was not going to meet those expectations.\n\nFirst the good.  Jamppong is pretty good.  The soup has that requisite taste required, and the ingredients were ample with fresh and plump seafood pieces.  The deep red color is accompanied by an equally deep taste, although not quite as spicy as it appears.  Now the mediocre.  The noodle on both dishes were just okay, not as firm and chewy as it should be indicating it's not handmade.  Take note, noodles are a big differentiator in these two dishes.  When they are not proper, it will \"tire out\" the dish.  This will result in the symptom where you will initially like it, but then find yourself not finishing the dish.  It was such here.  The bad is the jajang sauce.  It was too sweet, and did not possess that distinct taste required to qualify as good jajangmyun.  The combination of that sauce with the noodles made it at best an okay dish.  \n\nThe bare set up did nothing to enhance the experience, but the servers were pleasant.  While the Korean-Chinese dishes we had were only mediocre, I'm wondering if there is something that they to well since the place was decently busy.  Maybe I will give it another go on some of the other dishes... But based on what we had, I can't do any better than 3 stars.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  Absolutely fine to eat by yourself here, both the atmosphere and the dishes are set up for it."

It's in a small, run down strip mall.  Completely unassuming, and a little sketchy looking at first glance.  Don't let that scare you.  It's well worth a visit.\n\nInside, I was quite surprised that this place was more a Korean restaurant than a Hawaiian joint.  We went with it, and ordered mostly Korean.  They started us out with a good assortment of banchan.  I had the spicy pork and it was delicious.  Spicy, sweet, served on a sizzling hot plate with a boatload of onions.  I had it with a side of mac salad, which was ok.  I've only had one mac salad that absolutely blew me away, so this was along the lines of most others.  \n\nThe kiddo had the kalbi ribs, and from the look of the plate of bones, I think he was pleased.  \n\nThe hubby got the jajangmyeon, and said it was delicious as well.  I had never tried this particular dish before our visit here, and it was a little intimidating at first.  Since then, we've had it a few other times, and this place is one of the best.  The sauce is so flavorful, and the noodles were just right.  \n\nA few other dishes on the table were the spam musubi (did not disappoint), and hot stone bibimbap (another solid dish).\n\nSo, if you want Hawaiian, they've got a few basics (spam musubi, kalbi, teriyaki, katsu) but the shining stars here are the Korean dishes.  Apparently the meat jun is one of the best around, so I'd go that route if you're not sure what to get."

They treat their customers like family. The food is cooked the way your Korean/Hawaiian friend's momma would cook it. Lots of love and plenty of flavor. \n\nBanchan is always on point, sundobu, kalbi, bulgogi, jajamyun, spam fried rice, you can't ever go wrong with ordering any of the items on their menu. If you think it might be pretty costly to come here, you are wrong. The price is very reasonable for the portion, the taste and for the service.\n\nI'm so glad they expanded, and I'm so glad they are still around."

This is exactly the kind of restaurant I love no matter the cuisine, and Russell serves all sorts of Hawaiian/Korean so very good, scratch that, not good, great.  My only complaint is they are so far from my house.  \n  Every meal comes with boiled peanuts, and I've been served kimchi, and bean sprouts with my meals.  Your glass is never empty and if you are drinking water quickly you'll get a pitcher.  I've had the tea on each visit too and will get it again.  \n  I've enjoyed their combo platter and very hot (both in spice and temperature) seafood & tofu soup.  Experience the food for yourself, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.\n  Island Style may be a small family run \"hole in the wall\" (a term I use with much respect and endearment) restaurant in a strip mall however has a rare combination of excellent food, warm attentive staff and more than reasonable prices compared to the servings you receive.  So long as I'm live in Las Vegas I'll be a customer of Island Style."

The restaurant is very clean and well-kept. Even the chopsticks are nicer than most restaurants in Vegas\n\nService: A+++ Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by Russell right away. Before i could even put my bag down he came by with free boiled peanuts, water and menu recommendations for us. Guess we looked like newbies :P Russell also made sure our water and tea glasses were never empty and kept refilling our side dishes without even being asked. He is definitely not stingy about his food like most Asian restaurants. We weren't treated as customers, but more like family\n\nFood: A+++\n         - I got the Seafood Soondubu + Kalbi + Fish = A+++ Tasty tofu soup with clams, mushroom & shrimp. The kalbi and fish were good, but nothing extraordinary. \n           - My BF and GF got the Combo with Meat Jun, chicken & Kalbi with substituted    fried rice. DELICIOUS! Not to mention, the portions were pretty big, which just means i get to share with them :P\n\nComplimentary Side dishes: A+++ radish, cabbage kimchee, bean sprouts, & Hot dog with onions. My favorite was the cabbage kimchee --i could eat those like chips!!! The hot dog and bean sprouts were also yummy. Russell also brought us some dried seaweed and \"korean style\" kimchee to try out; that one was too sour for me.\n\nI am definitely coming back the next chance i get! I love Russell's enthusiasm and charismatic personality! How he runs his restaurant is refreshing and rare in this town. My BF even said he felt like Russell was like an Uncle to him LOL\n\nTIP: Don't confuse this restaurant with the one on spring mountain, with almost the same name!"

            "review": "Annyeonghaseyo!\n\nCheat day approved. We always feel hustled at all of the high-price-point Korean restaurants in town. Out of all of the ones we have tried since moving to Las Vegas, Island Style did not let us down. You seriously get a ton of food for your buck and the food actually tastes good. If you are looking for a small portion, or tiny bite, this is not the place to go. \n\nYou will not even believe the portion sizes here. HUGE. Even the banchan (Korean side dishes) were a generous, heaping serving. My boyfriend and I came here with our massive appetites and we were totally defeated. We ended taking home over 60% of the food. That's nuts, even for us. We decided that when we return, we will only need to order one combo plate and share it.\n\nWe really enjoyed the authentic Korean banchan selection. The salt boiled peanuts were shockingly delicious. I'm really obsessed with munching on those tasty little guys. Everything else was seasoned and pickled just right; tangy, slightly sweet, and not obnoxiously spicy. They offered - kkakdugi (pickled daikon radish), kongnamul-muchim (bean sporuts), kimchi (pickled cabbage), cold seaweed, and also my absolute favorite was the addictive cheonsachae with mayo (white crunchy kelp noodles). Flavor rating: 5//5\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the meat combo plate that was about $12 - Its a crazy amount of food! It comes with 1 Kalbi rib, 1 meat jun, 1 thin breast of BBQ chicken and a big scoop of macaroni salad. We also substituted the white rice for spam fried rice. My favorites were the meat jun and the spam fried rice! We never had meat jun before, but it was so delicious! It's a seasoned hamburger patty covered in a tasty egg batter. The fried rice also had a bunch of spam. The kalbi had great charred and grilled flavor, but 1 rib didn't offer up enough meat; more of a tease. Also the grilled chicken was a tad bland. Flavor rating: 4/5\n\nI really wanted something warm and comforting: a hot and spicy soup would hit the spot. I had my mind on ordering the Soondubu (hot and spicy tofu soup) but I later discovered that they only carry a seafood version, which I was not feeling at the moment. Our waiter was kind and recommended that I try the Yukgaejang (spicy beef and vegetable noodle soup.) I appreciated his tip, so I went for it. It came out steamy hot, the broth hit the spot. It was slightly spicy and very comforting, yet, it wasn't proportional; I wish there was more noodles, after 3 bites I was left with all veggies, some dry meat and a ton of broth. In the future I would definitely  request for extra, extra noodles. Flavor rating: 3/5\n\nThe SKIP list:  \n* Spam musubi - The spam was sliced paper thin and there was way too much packed, dense rice. I ended up peeling off over half of the rice. Also, the dark, savory and sweet sauce to enhance the musubi was missing. Flavor rating:1/5\n\n* Pan fried mandu, it came out soggy and the filling was exceptionally bland. Unfortunately, the dipping sauce didn't do much to enhance it. Flavor rating: 2/5\n\n~Gamsahabnida!"

Quick example of the hospitality and service we received before I review how wonderful the food is...We arrived just before noon and made our way to a corner table next to the soda cooler. There was another patron waiting for her carry out order sitting next to us. While we were looking at the menu, the carry out order came out and the customer left. Before we knew it, Russell came out and insisted we moved to the next table. He was concerned that we'd be uncomfortable from the heat coming off the refrigerator. It may not seem like a big thing, but just the fact he'd go out of his way to make sure we were comfortable before we could feel any discomfort was so refreshing! I read all the other reviews talking about how genuine Russell is, but you can't believe it until you experience it.\n\nNow, the food! After reading other reviews, I needed to make sure we sampled as much as we could and I can honestly say Russell delivers! My oldest son had the combo (bbq chicken, kalbi ribs, and meat jun), my youngest had the saimin, my wife the spicy beef soup, and I had the Bi Bim Bap. I'm am so happy we tried all the different dishes. No one was disappointed with what they got. The food came out fast, hot, and in huge portions. It was everything we could hope for and then some.\n\nOne other observation I can't pass up. The place has such a neighborhood feel to it. The dining room filled up quickly after we arrived with locals that were obvious regulars.  It almost felt like a backwards \"Cheers\". Instead of everyone greeting Norm coming to the bar, greetings of \"Hey Russell!\" from the majority of the people walking in the door!\n\nRussell is so inviting and his food is so comforting, I wish him nothing but years of success. I know I'll be back as soon as we go back to Vegas! Mahalo!"

As with any Korean restaurant, the table is offered banchan and rice water tea. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the meat jun was, especially with the flavorful and tender thinly-sliced beef.

Not only do all the employees check on to ensure you have everything you need, but they make sure you have rice and sauce for your leftovers too.  We will definitely be back to try more dishes.  We ordered the combo plate which had Kalbi, meat jun, and BBQ chicken.  We also ordered the spicy pork & my boyfriend assured me it was delicious.  Try this place out!"

First time having this so I was quite too excited.  It came with mussels, clams, shrimps, and a side of flavorful fried fish with a small bowl of rice.  I expected the soup to be a little more spicy but it was not spicy at all (for my taste).\n\nBrother enjoyed his plate but was wanting more rice.  I had a bite and the meat was tender and juicy.\n\nFOOD COMA!"

My first impression after walking in was relief.  Friendly, open seating in a clean restaurant.  Very kind, friendly service and fellow diners looking relaxed, happy, and enjoying their lovely food.\n\nAs soon as I sat down I noticed the man at the next table devouring the Loco Moco which looked so good.  He overheard me comment about it to my friend and told us it was excellent. He then confirmed that anything ordered here is delicious.\n\nMy friend, an island girl, had such a hard time choosing a dish...mainly because everything looked so good.  She decided on the Portuguese sausage, rice and egg...requested egg whites only-- no problem.  I didn't even have to look at the menu. The first dish I always select is Bulgogi.  The food came to the table pretty quickly and, wow.  So good!  Perfect flavors, cooked just right.  Ban chan was mmmmmm yummy.  So much food!  The Portuguese sausage was very nice:  full flavor, not greasy, dense, delicious.  My bulgogi was so scrumptious. It was tender, mixed with a delicious blend of onions, carrots, and sesame sprinkled on top.  The kimchee was so good that when we had eaten all of our first small plate we were tempted to pour the juice on our rice and keep on munching.  I made that comment before our second small dish of kimchee came out and my friend told me she had been thinking the same thing.\n\nWe are planning on becoming regulars there and bringing our friends.  What impressed me the most was that as dishes were brought out to other tables, they all looked and smelled divine.  I do not think you can go wrong ordering anything. \n\nThe atmosphere was laid back, industrious but not harried, and, yes, loving.  It says a lot that in this kind of town the owners have created a spot where people leave, full, happy, relaxed, and eager to return.  While there, locals, families, foodies, and friends came to eat or pick up orders to go.  This place is well hidden but well-known and my favorite new spot.  And I don't know who he is but there is a very handsome young man working there, too..."

Service was dismally slow, as my friend and I sat there staring at the counter waiting for someone to take our orders. When they finally brought us a glass of water each, as well as the side dishes, the water was the most disgusting water I have ever tasted; either someone did not wash the glasses right, or the pipes in the establishment are filthy, because the water tasted like buttermilk. \n\nWhen the waiters got around to acknowledging us, the service was otherwise pleasant and attentive, and our waitress was very helpful in explaining the dishes. Food was otherwise quite tasty, I ordered a bibim kook soo that was everything I would expect from a Korean restaurant like this. \n\nAt the end of the meal however, as I was eating some kimchi, I found an odd-looking vegetable in there, and lo and behold, there's a pickled flying insect inside of a leaf! Those cooks in the back really need to wash their vegetables better. Sorry to say, but my experience here was just awful."

Still lots of aloha spirit at Island Style!\n\nI was feelin' the Korean vibe that day so I went with a staple, the Bi Bim Bop.  Rice topped with bulgogi beef with lots of veggie sides like pickled carrots & daikon, bean sprouts, spinach, and cucumber, all topped off with a runny sunny side up egg, sesame seeds & seaweed!  Comes with a side of broth too for pouring over.  Delicious!  Love that runny egg yolk combining with the hot rice & bulgogi, then getting the crunch from the cool veggies.  That's some good eats!  I should have opted for a dollar or 2 more for the Bi Bim Bop in the hot stone pot, would have been sizzling hot from beginning to end.\n\nIsland Style has the hookup for banchan too!  Who else in town served boiled peanuts as banchan?  Such a good start to a meal.  I had no shortage of other banchan either - kim chee, kim chee cucumbers, bean sprouts & more.  Sides to my hearts content!\n\nI also got a Cheeseburger as well.  Surprisingly simple & tasty!  Flat top grilled meat, cheddar cheese, fresh lettuce & tomato, bun.  And lots of mayo & ketchup just the way I like it!  Opted for no fries, needed to keep the calorie count down LOL.\n\nIsland Style I'll be back again when I need me some down home eats!\n\nHawaiian!

They flood it with enough gravy to eat with my rice, which is just how I like it. Also comes with macaroni salad which is pretty standard at Hawaiian places, but I like that their macaroni salad isn't smothered in mayonnaise.\n\nOther than that, I like the loco moco, kalua pork, bbq combo, and bi bim bap bowls. Honestly, everything is delicious here and definitely worth a visit."

After looking up on Yelp, we decided to head on to Island Style. \n\nBest decision ever!\n\nDo not be fooled by the shabby exterior on a strip mall. \n\nThe interior is nothing impressive either. But I'm not there for ambience. It's the food that I'm there for. And it surely delivered!\n\nThe moment we sat down, we were served the ban chan by the very friendly owner. He was such a joy! He was very patient and helpful and explained to us what we have in front of us. These little plates of appetizers were yummy! My favorite was the white crunch seaweed that looked like noodles. \n\nThe owner suggested some yummy specials but since we practice only halal/kosher meat, we opted for the seafood options. My husband is not too adventurous so he got the salmon teriyaki. We got our son the fish katsu and I got the spicy grilled octopus. \n\nFood didn't take too long. Our son's fish katsu came undercooked and it was promptly fixed by the owner who was so apologetic. \n\nHe later even offered us canned Hawaiian drinks on the house. \n\nThe food was sooooo good! Hot and fresh! \n\nI left feeling satisfied and would love to come back again. The friendly service makes it even better here!"

I mean, honestly, I've only tried a handful of Korean dishes, and probably couldn't tell you much about them other than a brief description. But I stick to what I love and know best: meat and noodles.\n\nMy brother and I met Katrina M. here for a lunch date - welcomed warmly on such a dreary day. We ordered the Meat Combo plate ($9.90) that came with Meat Jun, BBQ Chicken, Kalbi, macaroni salad and rice. Then, of course, we ordered my spicy cold noodles ($9.90) and a sauntering pot of seafood soup for Katrina M. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed all the meat options - the Meat Jun unexpectedly becoming my favorite. Egg battered beef, it was tender and bursting with flavor. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and kalbi is always good. But my cold buckwheat noodles - they were perfection. The balance of spice and acidity warming me up perfectly on a \"Seattle\" day.\n\nWhat really made this trip to Island Style was the hospitality. Warmly greeted by both the proprietor and his never-ending supply of hot barley tea, I felt like I could sit there forever, taking shelter from the sporadic weather, eating my spicy noodles in bliss."

All of it delicious, all of it hard to not ask for refills; gotta save room for the entrees!  I've had the Dolsot Bibimbap and the Fish Jun.  The Bibimbap delivers well, and the Fish Jun portion is huge!  Two very large filets battered and fried.

Located in a random strip mall, one would easily pass this place up. Luckily, our Yelp app was working [as opposed to not working when we were in the middle of nowhere, Utah], and the recommendations were good ones.\n\nAs we sat down, he brought over a few dishes [\"banchan\"] to get us started - pickled radish, sprouts, and kimchi.\n\nWhen we asked Russell about the unique flavor of the kimchi at the table [it was the \"Hawaiian version\"], he brought out the \"Korean version\" of the house kimchi for us to sample as well. It was just as good as the other version with very different flavors.\n\nWhen we couldn't decide what to order, he brought us pictures, which instead of helping me out, confused me more. I was hungry, and everything looked good.\n\nWe finally settled on the combo and the loco moco. Tasty. Filling. Just what we needed to continue our trek eastward. Near the end of the meal, Russell brought out boiled peanuts for us to take on the road. \n\nIf you're looking for something tasty in Vegas that will fill you up as if you'd been at the buffets without giving an arm, leg, and liver up, then this is it.\n\n4.5 stars."

We were done eating our fiod and he noticed I didn't have my fried saimin. \n\nHere's my story... let me start by saying I'm from the 808- exit 8 home of the best meat jun in Wahiawa Hawaii. With that said i know meat jun and know how one should taste. The meat jun here is not bad at all. Best so far on the mainland. I think the dipping sauce could've been a little better but hey it's still good. \n\nWe arrived here around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was busy but glad they had large party tables available. We had 8 of us total. \n\nThe server was very nice and served the table ban chan and boiled peanuts. The peanuts and cucumber kim chee was the bomb. \n\nIn addition to my meat jun order, i had the fried saimin and kalbi. Omg, broke da mouth fo realz. The fried saimin was on point. Lots of flavor and made with fish cake. Yay! \n\nAlthough they forgot about my fried saimin, it was actually worth the wait. I'm excited to visit again. \n\nAfter viewing the menu, this is a Korean Restaurant serving Hawaii style dishes. Felt like I was eating food on Kapiolani Blvd back home. \n\nDefinitely a place you gotta check out."

I happen to love eggs though. \n\nThe bibimbap (you have to get the one in the hot rock/dolsot style, because you mix it together and press down to get the rice crispy!) was great. Definitely ask for that spicy/sweet paste to add a couple dollops before you mix it in. Really legit bibimbap. \n\nFried saimin was also good. Great balance of flavors and it was slightly salty and mild. Spam is the real way to get it, you get to experience the saltiness of the spam flavor with the slight sweetness of the cabbage and kamaboko (fish paste cut into strips, the pink and white stuff), and richness of the egg. They gave us a TON of this stuff.\n\nThey also served us boiled peanuts (which were delicious), some kimchi and kimchi style raddish, and some nice palate cleansing broth. \n\nI wish I could have eaten everything.

I was short on time, had a 40 minutes lunch break and since Island- style was right across the stress, I was thinking 35 mins should be plenty of time to eat my food and leave. I was waiting over 20 mins for my food and I understand there were a few orders ahead of me and by looking at everyone else's food, it does take time to cook. After 15mins passed by I asked the guy if it would take long cause I only had 15 mins left to eat and go back. He did said he would check on it then left. Approx 10 more minutes passed by I gave him my credit card so it would be faster if I ate and left. He told me that it takes time to make my buckwheat noodles and that everything was made to order. Ughhh.... buddy I'm Korean and I know damn well that it only takes 30 secs once in boiling water to cook the noodles and put in the broth. Needless to say I took one bite of the cold noodle and it wasn't hand made, it was the store bought noodles you cook in boiling water. The broth was so salty, and the spicy buckwheat noodles tasted like pure hot pepper paste + vinegar and again salty. I took literally two bites and left. The guy who took my order grabbed the checkbook from me and told customers next to me 'shes telling me how to cook brah...'. I know you've been cooking for 19 years BUT if you knew anything about customer service you do not talk shit when I can clearly hear you, grab the checkbook out of my hand, and give me dirty looks. Everytime I came here its the owners that now operate the one at Greenland. They are soo nice and helpful... total opposite of this guy... oh yea btw your Nengmyun (cold buckwheat noodles in broth) and Bibim gook-so (spicy, cold buckwheat noodles) is tasteless... \n\nIf this guy didn't offend me so much, I would come back for their Hawaiian plate lunch, it looked really good.

Located in a strip mall with a lot of parking, this place has about 16 quad tables.  There are 8 of them side by side in the middle of the room so you can put several parties of 8 easily, so it's group friendly.  The menu is mainly Korean, but for some reason, they choose to put the word Island in the name of the restaurant giving me the impression they were Hawaiian.  We had the BBQ combo and the Pork Katsu.  I was looking for the Hawaiian aspect, but ended up with a Korean aberation of Hawaiian food.  The katsu sauce was more like a ketchup sauce or a shrimp cocktail sauce.  The pork katsu was over cooked and dry.  I suspect the cutlet was under a heat lamp i.e. precooked like a mickey dees.   The Kalbi and BBQ chicken were good.  The meat jun is coated with egg and like the cutlet, I seemed like it was a heat lamp item too.  It didn't have that freshly made taste.  I was disappointed after reading the good reviews.  If I come back, it would be for the Korean food because the photos on the wall look really good.  Maybe they should change the name of the restaurant to Seoul Style to give the customers a better description of what you're going to get."

For being such a hole-in-the-wall, there's a very warm & welcoming ambiance to the place. \n\nBOILED PEANUTS: Get in on it. Enough said. \n\nFOOD: The menu offers a big variety of classic Korean dishes such as Soon Dubu, Naengmyeon, GalbiTang, and Kalbi. All of which I have tried and are delicious! Then there are the Hawaiian staples: Spam Eggs & Rice, Loco Moco, & Rice Omelette. The menu is pretty big here and you can't go wrong no matter what you get. It all has that home-made Korean food flavor. The Meat Jun is spot on here and I never leave without a belly full of their Jjin Mandu (Steamed Korean Dumplings). You could opt for the fried ones but steaming gives them a more delicate flavor as well as cuts the grease. Those along with the Kim-Chi are made in-house. Portions and Value are definitely better here than at some Korean restaurants.\n\nBAN-CHAN: There's always a bunch of little dishes which is the usual for Korean eating. Kimchi, Radish Kimchi, spinach, potato salad, etc. It seems to vary every single time I come here. But its all good. They don't have a problem refilling them either!\n\nTEA: The type of tea they serve is some random type of Korean root tea. Its delicious. Its not the usual Barley Tea (BoRee Cha). It comes from seeping whole pieces of the root and not some store-bought tea bag. \n\nWhat you lose in 'Location & Decor' you gain in 'Food & Flavor.'\n\nYou can also sample Island Style in the Greenland food court."

And why I waited so freaking long, I have absolutely no clue.\n\nWe pulled into the parking lot and I thought I would just run in and see if they had a to go menu so we could look over a menu to see if we truly wanted to eat here. They didn't have one but the lady told me to take my time and look over one of their menus. \n\nInstead, I just went back to the car and told my hunny and son to come in. I mean we were here already, why not. \n\nThey were pretty busy when we first got there, or so I thought.  Time would teach me very well that I was wrong in my assumption.\n\nGlancing over the menus, they have a good selection of items. Mostly Korean with hint of Hawaiian items. What won me over is that they had American items for me to choose from for my son. \n\nI settled on the hot rock bi mi map and my hunny got a regular bi mi map and for an appetizer we order Mandu. The kiddo got fries.\n\nWhile we were waiting on our Mandu we were served some boiled peanuts which were so good. Art kind of looked at them weird because he had never had them but once he tried one he couldn't stop eating them.\n\nNext came our cabbage kimchi, radish kimchi, sesame bean sprouts, and some kind of stir fried hot dog.\n\nI am a HUGE KIMCHI FREAK. This stuff was amazing. Other than it needing more heat (for my taste) it was extremely flavorful and still crunchy. I basically inhaled Kimchi and kept eying a jar that they had filled in fridge with that stuff and wondered how much they would have sold that jar to me for. \n\nI concentrated on the kimchi for so long, I didn't realize that Art had ate almost all the mandu and bean sprouts. Mandu had come out sometime while  I was lost in heaven eating that kimchi.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with the mandu. I didn't know what to expect for the filling but it was a noodle, veggie mixture deep fried in a pot sticker wrapper. They were hot and crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. \n\nMy hot rock bi mi map came out and you could just hear the sizzle and smell the rice getting slightly burnt and crunchy. They dressed my bi mi map once it arrived to the table and that was nice. \n\nArt's bi mi map came in a huge white bowl and looked almost better than mine but I knew that I had the crispy rice to look forward to. My egg was slightly under cooked so it could finish cooking in the hot rock. My mouth is literally salivating now just thinking about it. It had a nice combo of meat and veggies in it. I meant to take a picture of it but I couldn't stop eating it.\n\nWhen they brought out my son's fries they were sure to tell me that they didn't put any salt on it. I thought this was very considerate. They even brought him an otter pop at the end of our meal.\n\nI don't know if our bowls were too big or we filled our selves on kimchi, peanuts and beansprouts and mandu but we had to go take half of our bi mi maps to go.\n\nThis place was a big hit for me and the fact that it was a huge hit for my hunny says a lot too. He doesn't love Asian food as much as me, so this definitely says a lot. \n\nThe only downfall to this place is that they are small and get crowded, I mean no seats available crowded FAST! At least they did the night we were there. \n\nWe will definitely be back. There are no ifs ands or butts about this. I want to go back and try some of that fried fish and bulgolgi I was eying on other plates."

Better still, only one item on the menu is over $10 and you are generously showered with large portions of free appetizers.\n\nWe were given addictive boiled peanuts and kimchee, as well as pickled bean sprouts, cucumbers, and radishes, all before we even ordered. The peanuts were the highlight, with the shells enveloping the salty brine they were cooked in so you could enjoy it with your legume. Did I mention they were free?\n\nAs you may have surmised from the appetizers, Island Style serves \"Fusion Korean Food and Island Style Loco Food.\" Though you may recognize most menu items, many will probably provide you with a learning experience, as they did for me. Don't worry, your uber friendly host will explain each item with big picture menus and photos on the wall so you aren't at a loss for what to order.\n\nI passed on my favorite Korean dish, Bi Bim Bap, in favor of the Hot Spicy Beef soup ($9.90). This was served in a massive bowl filled to the brim with shredded beef, glass noodles, mushrooms, scallions, and egg simmered in a paprika broth (think Korean goulash). It was hot and spicy for sure, but not overwhelmingly so, and it kept growing on me sip after sip. Ian ordered the Meat Jun ($8.25), which we both agreed was even better. This dish consists of pounded beef marinated in a sweet and salty shoyu (soy) sauce, that is then coated in egg and pan fried (think paillard francese). It is served with rice, bland macaroni salad (a Hawaiian staple), and more of the incredible shoyu sauce. If you eat meat, get this.\n\nWe were honestly shocked by how good the food was as it was better than anything we had in Hawaii and there were actually some healthy items as well. The server, who I believe was the owner, couldn't have been more genuine, friendly, and competent. Even if the food wasn't good, we still might have gone back anyway just because of his hospitality. If you want to explore Hawaiian cuisine in Vegas, this is definitely the place to do it"

So let's just start with, if you're looking for the full-on Korean experience with dozens of bowls around you and formal, even surly, sullen service, this is not the place. But if you want some excellent food in a relaxed environment, you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe name says it all: this is Korean (and Hawaiian and, coming up, Chinese/Korean) with island style. The owner (or the husband of the owner couple) just oozes chill; it's practically relaxing just talking to him. And he'll hang out and chat. Even call you \"brah.\" The service overall is personal, informal, and pleasant.\n\nThis is a tiny place; it's in a strip mall, and you'd be forgiven for not finding it right away. You have to look hard and hope that you're not being pressed by busy Sahara traffic.\n\nI was on my own, in town for CES. When seated, he first gave me a bowl of boiled peanuts to nosh on. Then came the banchan trio: kim chi, kaktugi (Korean radish kim chi), and bean sprouts. I'm reasonably familiar with kim chi (I make my own occasionally); this was good, although not particularly sour or complex. The kaktugi was great. He then brought out a separate bowl of this radish-green kim chi. This was absolutely excellent; spicy and sharp with a hint of sweet.\n\nI went with the spicy squid; really good. (Not super spicy, but then again, I have a high threshold.)\n\nCost: around $15 for everything. Really. In contrast to many Korean places. And I left totally full.\n\nApparently they have just installed three high-intensity burners (they had just been inspected and approved that day), and they plan to do Chinese-style food too, like black noodles. They will also hand-make their own noodles.\n\nPity I don't live here; it would become a regular place for me. Clearly they have other regulars (one couple came in and the waiter asked if they wanted him to clean their regular table so they could sit there instead of somewhere new). Nice local indie place; that's where I like to spend my money when traveling, and I'll be back here at some point."

I love the plate lunches there, especially the Kalua Pork or if I want something heavier, the roast beef and gravy over rice. The combination plate is also good with the short ribs and bulgogi. My boyfriend loves the Loco Moco plate and the Bibimbap. Occasionally you can substitute white rice for brown (if they have any made). Ask for a cup of Soloman Seal tea if you want the perfect drink to go with your meal. \n\nWe came here because we were hungry and we will always return because we are treated like ohana."

As my husband says, \"In vegas you can get what you paid for!\"  Yes, that's right!  I ordered Soon dub with seafood. Ono!  Spiciness is just right for me.  My husband ordered Combo, which comes with Kalbi, Chicken and Meat Jun. This is his favorite plate.  He used to come here with his dad when he was alive and my husband was living in Vegas. \n\nThey recently renovated this place and according to my husband, the place is double the size of before.\n\nAnd the price is reasonable.

Since I couldn't see waiter/waitress, I thought I'd wait until someone showed up and guide us.\n\nThen someone from back peeked me behind the curtain and moved on, without saying a single word.  I thought \"OK.  She will probably inform someone.\"  After a short while, guy came out from back and started to pick up dishes and clear the table.  He also peeked us for brief moment, without saying a word again, and went back to what he was doing.\n\nFrom that point I got pretty pissed that none working in the restaurant really wanted my business.  Those people who peeked could have at least said \"WAIT.\"  I have not heard the single word from them.  I then just left the restaurant and went somewhere else.\n\nIt was my first visit, and I am not going there ever again."

We were seated quickly and when the waiter came over, he asked if we had any questions about the menu (considering that half of it is written in an Asian language, I'm sure this is probably a concern!).  We ordered the Japchae, Combo plate, and a spam masubi.\n\nA few seconds later, the waiter comes back with all these complimentary apps!  What?!?!  Awesome surprise.  There were boiled peanuts, anchovies, bean sprouts, and radish/cucumber/bok choy kim chee.  I liked the bean sprouts the best; the dressing on it reminded me of seaweed salad.\n\nThen we got our food.  The spam masubi was a nice huge chuck of rice, spam, and seaweed.  The Japchae was a very large serving and it had some out of this world mushrooms and bulgogi in there.  The noodles were sweet and slightly chewy; an interesting texture.  The combo plate was excellent, a great way to try a little of everything so you know what you like.  The BBQ chicken was my favorite, and the kalbi beef was juicy and flavorful.  The Jun meat was not my cup of tea, I didn't like the egg batter.  Of course, I was really excited about the mac salad: very tasty and black peppery.\n\nI have to say someting about the waiter, because he is really what made this such an enjoyable experience.  I think he knew it was our first time there, so he kept giving us hints about what was good and how to eat some of the stuff.  He was sooo laid back, kind, funny, and welcoming, like we were best friends or something!  At the end of the night, the door opened and a big gust of cold wind came in.  My husband, who refuses to wear jackets, shivered and the waiter gave him some tea in a to-go cup to warm him up on the way to the car.  How sweet is he?"

I LOVE whenever we get unlimited side dishes & nothing else goes better with banchan than a hot stone pot soup. I will either get the soondubu or korean miso soup and homemade mandoo to top it off. \n\nThe exterior isn't much to marvel at when looking at the strip mall in general, but the interior is a cozy, hole in the wall that is welcoming to bring the ohana by & have a delicious meal together."

The owner was very welcoming from the minute we walked in and the service was great.. very fast and I never had to ask for refills of anything. This prevented any awkwardness that I normally encounter when asking for refills multiple times......The side dishes were all very good and the portion sizes were generous compared to other korean restaurants that I've been to. \n\nWe ordered the combination plate (kalbi, meat jun, & chicken) & seafood soondubu. Both were excellent flavor-wise & we had zero complaints! The owner made this special sauce (also amazing) that you use with the meats on the combo plate which was very tasty and paired well with the beef. The meat jun was also something new for me (thinly sliced beef inside this fried egg kinda thing) but it did not disappoint. The soondubu also came with a fried fish which was interesting as I've never seen this before at other restaurants. All in all, both selections were amazing and I can't wait to try more of what they have to offer.\n\nGood food is definitely important in a good restaurant, but one of the most important things to me is good service. There are very few places that have AMAZING service but I'd say Island Style is one of them.. so with good food AND service I will most definitely be back in the future."

My parents have told me before that Chinese and Korean culture have many similarities, but I never really paid much attention. Not probably until I ate at Island Style, which happens to be a Chinese Korean fusion restaurant. There are many dishes that crossover into both cultures, and each style has a different spin to it. There's also Hawaiian too though. So it's easy to be all sorts of confused here. But hey, food is food. And as long as it's good, I really don't care what culture wants to claim it. \n\nWe had tangsooyuk (sweet and sour pork) and Jjamjjamyun - a combo of their two house specialties jjajangmyun (noodles with black bean sauce) and jjampong (spicy seafood noodle soup). The pork was crispy and well seasoned and came with vegetables. I think the Chinese rendition leaves bone in and doesn't have vegetables. Flavors are similar but there's a different kick to this one, and there's a sauce you're meant to dip it in. Both types of noodles were good. I've never had jjampong, but jjajangmyun (the black one) is a Chinese dish I'm pretty familiar with. Here, the sauce is dark and you can't really tell what's inside it. You get to choose what kind of meat you want. The flavors were so good. In the Chinese version, there's a lot more diced vegetables and tofu along with minced meat. I'd order both versions depending on my mood. The seafood noodle was spicy but also delicious. There was a huge amount of seafood in there, including mussel, shrimp, crab legs, and squid. I really enjoyed all the food. \n\nThe venue is very casual. Nice staff. Laid back seating. Clean bathrooms. Outside can be a little shady if it's late at night since it's not the busiest and most well lit area. But it's not bad. \n\nOverall I'd come back."

I tried the Loco Moco from the Hawaiian menu and it was fantastic. I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with any mac-and-cheese but the ample amount of ban-chan will keep you preoccupied.\n\nIf you like spicy noodles, I highly recommend the Bibim-Guksu. Simply the best guksu I've had in Vegas and possibly top K-town California guksu. My friend calls it 'the crackdish'. Yes, you will be addicted to it as well if you're a fan of bibim-guksu.\n\nIf bibim-guksu doesn't excite you but you still want noodles, maybe you can try the black bean noodles or jajjangmyun. If you're REALLY indecisive the jjamjamyun is a great choice; one portion of jajjangmyun and another portion of jjam-bong (spicy seafood with noodles) on a single divided bowl.\n\nI'll have to say all the dishes I've had at Island Style/Baek-il-an has been satisfying. It seems a little awkward to have one restaurant host such a variety of different food but if they get it right, who's complaining??!?!!"

You also get hot Korean tea with your meal. Ordered the loco moco and got a nice sized hamburger patty on top of a huge mound of rice and topped with an egg and lots of gravy, Also had to try a side of Spam, which was grilled to perfection but a little too salty for me. The loco moco was just like the ones I had in Hawaii, though. The kimchi was great, especially the one that has been fermenting for a while, although it has a huge bite, so watch out when you are eating it. The regular kimchi was very good as were the pickled radishes. The staff makes you feel like you are in the islands with their laid back attitude and attentive service. Definitely recommend checking it out if you are in Las Vegas."

Instead of the usual expensive resort fare, we decided to duck into Island Style instead and have a light snack. Right. \n\nIsland Style is a very unassuming place in the middle of a nondescript strip mall on the west side. As plain looking as the place is, it is really about the food. I had hot rock Bil Bum Bop and the Missus had a combo that included the best tasting Kalbi ever. The homemade Kim Chee (cabbage, Radish, and cucumber versions) was terrific. Everything on the menu is hand made. As we were walking out, they were making fat hand stuffed won tons.\n\nThe only down side was that we ended up eating everything to the point that we may have to beg off on our dinner reservation at the big time strip restaurant.\n\nI have to go back for some Moko Loko for breakfast before I leave town."

The owner, Russel, was closing shop early that day due to a catering gig. We were super lucky to find the place and get there in time to relax and hide from the midsummer heat. On that particular day in Vegas, it was over 110degrees outside and we didnt have AC in our car. All of our sodas and bottled waters were on the house. He fed us like kings, suggested what he thought we would like and then cooked us even more food for free. The whole time he laughed with us and tried to get us to interact with the only other family in the restaurant. He was absolutely the sweetest. Russel took the orders, made all of the food himself., entertained us and prepared for his catering job all at the same time.\n\nWhen he flipped the sign on the door to close, a man (he explained an annoying regular) came in sometime after and tried to make him feeling guilt for closing early. The terrible man kept nagging, \"Why don't you want to feed my wife?\" Russel fnally yelled at him and kicked him out. It was great. I wish all restaurant owners and workers were able to deal with horrible and demanding customers in such a way.\n\nWe can't wait to go back! Russels spot is a Vegas staple!"

My friend and I were the only white folks in this 20-year old restaurant, and got some weird looks from the regulars.\nImagine a fusion of Polynesian-spam-based lunchroom, Korean kim chee joint and basic Chinese restaurant. Usually, when we hear \"Korean,\" it's some sort of Asian BBQ joint. Not this place.\nUpon sitting down, you will get a number of different pickle-type appetizers. We got two types of kim chee, kelp noodle in a mayonnaise sauce that was quite new and tasty, boiled peanuts, and bean sprouts in brine.\nWe ordered the pan-fried dim sum and it was adequate.\nWe ordered the fried chili shrimp and the meat-and-seafood stir fry. \nThe waiter warned us that the stir fry was the real deal, with sea cucumbers (sort of a cross between mushrooms and squid, but slimy). And indeed it had sea cucumbers, but nice enoki mushrooms too. I'm honestly not a huge fan of sea cucumbers but as the wait dude promised, they help make a nice gravy.\nBoth dishes had a mix of fresh vegetables and that staple of Polynesian/Chinese lunchrooms, mixed frozen vegetables of cut string beans, corn, cubed carrot and peas. I put that mix in canned chicken noodle soup to increase the nutrition content, but otherwise don't see much advantage to adding frozen mixed vegetables to real food. \nNothing to write home about; good solid food. I would be happy to try other items on the menu."

What makes this place so great is not only the food, but the GREAT, TERRIFIC, AWESOME hospitality.

Loco Moco (hamburger and egg on top of a bed of rice with gravy)\n2. Fried Rice Omlet\n3. Bim Bim Bop \n4. Fried Saimen\n5. Chicken Katsu\n6. Fried Mandu (homemade, the owner was so nice to let us try this on the house) \n\nEverything was delicious! I mean the Katsu was crunchy, the fried saimen contained the freshest ingredients (spam, cabbage, kamaboko, saimen noodles, eggs, etc), the bim bim bop had great flavor, the loco moco had some pretty awesome tasting gravy which made the dish so good, and the fried rice was great (something so simple tasting so good just tells you how good it is).  I don't know exactly what was in the fried mandu but man did that taste good as well. I don't even know what more to say except that I would highly recommend trying this place out. \n\nLater in our trip we had Hawaiian food again at the California Club, Aloha Specialties and man, Aloha Specialties doesn't even compare to Island Style! Come here! Best meal of the trip :)"

What can I say...I loved it! \n\nTASTE: authentic\nSERVICE: great\nCLEANLINESS: very clean \n\nAfter a week of hiking, I wasn't really in the mood to get all fancy and did not want to dress up to have lunch on the strip. I walked in with running shorts, t-shirt, and Rainbows and felt completely comfortable dining here. Island Style felt like a family-run restaurant and I'm so happy I stopped here before the long drive home! \n\nI was super surprised when they brought out various side dishes for us, as I wasn't expecting that at all. The cubed kimchi and Napa cabbage kimchi was the greatest I've ever had and as I'm writing this review, I'm wishing I had some right now! There was also a side dish that came with raw onions, takuan (pickled daikon radish), and a brown dipping sauce that I really liked as well. Dipping the raw onion into the brown sauce magically transformed the onion into something delicious and sweet. \n\nI was really afraid of having food coma on the way home and debated on coming here. I guess I could have gotten a salad, but I'd be way too hungry shortly after. I had the Hot Rock Pot Bi Bim Bap and he had the Meat Jun. Both dishes were really tasty and the portions were large. My bi bim bap was sizzling as it arrived and the crispy rice on the very bottom was so good! The bi bim bap was packed with vegetables and thank goodness it wasn't oily!! \n\nThe Meat Jun was a piece of seasoned pork sandwiched between thin layers of eggs. It was sort of like an omelet, I would say. I had a bite of it and it was pretty good, but it's a lot of protein so make sure you have some vegetables or kimchi with it! \n\nOur server was really nice and even with the crowd, he made sure to refill our waters often. Also, the women working here were very sweet and greeted everyone with \"yeoboseyo!\" Overall, I really liked the food and I would definitely come back!"

Good thing, cuz the in-laws were clueless and needed direction. \nLong story longer, they seemed to enjoy their food somewhat. They said it wasn't super good, but it was good. Ray L. reviewed the same experience as I did. Service was bad. Our waitress was taking our order and while I was talking to her she walked away and helped another customer. WTF?? I was talking to you ya freak! Next our food came out one at a time. BOO! No offers for refills....Ok that's enough. \n\nThe guy there was very nice, almost too nice. He made some boiled peanuts for my in-laws to take to the airport. He talked about them like they were a delicacy. To be honest, my in-laws couldn't even stand the smell they made in the car and we had to pull over and throw them away.\n\nThe place definitely has heart, I just wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless they can be more consistent in service and food..."

Dont be fooled however, there is nothing trendy or hip about this place which is why I love it. Good service and great food at fair prices. They usually make almost anything I ask for even its not on the menu and most of the time Jody remebers what I like and I dont have to ask. \n\nThe fried rice here is crackin which is saying a lot because, well.. how good can fried rice be right?

Why?\nHere are some reasons:\n1. Impeccable geniune service from the owner Russel who is a hawaiian native (big island) whose wife is korean. \n2. Its a hole in the wall place, but neat and clean. A place where you feel safe to eat. But don't be fooled by the surrounding stores in the unassuming strip mall.\n3. Price is right for good hawaiian and good korean food in Vegas. \n4. Big servings! FRIED RICE IS GREAT! Spam, eggs, and all the rest of the typical fried rice ingredients. \n5. Mandu - fried gyoza/dumpling type stuff which is extra crispy skin on the outsdie and delicious pork,cabbage stuffing. \n6. They have kimchee that is homemade! =) \n\nAll the best homestyle hawaiian food and korean favorites (bulgolgi, spam, bi bam bop in a claypot)\n\nThe best part of our experience is the owner and his generosity. He's the surfer type, hawaiian, laid back - he's your uncle kind of guy that treats like your his old friend. Offered us complimentary katsu with our meal and brought out extra soup for our table of 4. Most generous guy. \n\nThey have another place located downtown near the korean stores, we must check it out next time we're in town. \n\nA must go place off the strip if you have a car go there, and if you're really hungry and strapped for cash, definitely go there!"

They have been making their rounds to every Hawaiian eatery and yelping their love. Mahalo nui loa! \n\nI followed their yelpings to Island Style, a Hawaiian/Korean joint. When I set out on my Island journey, I had sundubu and banchan on the mind. I thought it might be closed with I pulled up. They have highly reflective glass, so you can't see inside, but I trusted the open sign and went on in. The restaurant is definitely a little hole in the wall, but very warm and inviting. They have nice wooden tables pushed together to accommodate large parties. When I arrived, there was a family of probably ten eating. They all seemed very happy. There is also a large TV, and they were tuned into March Madness. \n\nI thought I should order from the counter, but if you are eating there, just take a seat. The owner, who is friendly and helpful, came over to take my order. I really wanted a kimchi sundubu, but they only have a seafood one on the menu. I didn't want to be picky, so I decided I would try something different. (Although, he probably would have made it for me. I might try next time.) He started suggesting things, and I guess it became apparent that I had never tried Hawaiian food, so he brought out the picture menu. You know you appear clueless when they have to bring out pictures of the food.\n\nI finally decided on a spicy chicken dish based on the pictures. Just pointed right at it: \"I'll take that one there.\" In the meantime, I got a nice hot mug of Korean tea, boiled peanuts and three banchan. Yum. Yummier. Yummiest! The tea was great. Boiled peanuts are always a welcome treat, and all three banchan were fresh and flavorful. I inhaled the bean sprouts in about four bites. I felt embarrassed ordering banchan refills as a solo diner, but the super friendly server quickly noticed my bean sprout love and arrived with a new serving noting: \"I think you really liked that one!\" I didn't even have to ask! The kimchi tasted homemade with love. I finished it too!\n\nI think they went a bit easy on the spice for the spicy chicken, but that is okay. I hadn't really conveyed an \"I can handle spice\" attitude given my picture-assisted ordering incident. The portion was very generous, and the seasoning was scrumptious. If you are not an onion lover, you might want to avoid this one. However, I love onions, so the onion festival on my plate made me smile, as did my overall experience at Island Style, and it only cost $10! \n\nI am not sure if it is a good spot for vegetarians given the spam and oxtail soup and other meaty options, but you could make a good go of it with a couple of servings of banchan. The thought did cross my mind that I could have been perfectly happy with my mug of tea and my three little bottomless banchan. I am no expert on Hawaiian cuisine, so I can't say it is as good as it gets, but I can say I'll be going back to see what other tasty things I can nosh on!"

The boiled peanuts were delicious and complimentary! I had to refrain myself from eating too much so I still had room for the meat jun.\n\nI got the combo, which had the chicken teriyaki, galbi (short ribs), and meat jun. The chicken and galbi is juicy, tender and flavorful, but the meat jun was the real centerpiece.\n\nMeat jun is a fusion dish originating from Korean immigrants in Hawaii I believe. It's basically a tender piece of marinated beef pan-fried with a beaten egg. The marinade is a little sweet and has some soy sauce flavor. It compliments the tender, juicy beef perfectly. Add an egg and it's a unique and tasty dish! Highly recommended!\n\nThe tea they serve is very good too. \"Polygonatum tea\" apparently.\n\nLastly, the service was amazing. The waiter/owner was very attentive with tea refills. He also told us about his experience in Hawaii, the special tea, and the meat jun. \n\nOne of the greatest restaurants in terms of food, service, and even artwork on the walls! Try the meatjun! You won't find it anywhere else!"

The food and owner were so good that I went back for dinner.\n\nFor lunch I decided to get the Combo due to the reviews here. The steamed peanuts were very nice and Russel gave me tons (too many given how much food was yet to come). The pickled radish was great, but the kimchi was a bit bland and squishy. But when Russel saw me eating the kimchi he asked if I liked kimchi and I said yes. He then brought out a large leaf of cabbage and cut it into pieces for me at the table. It turned out to be kimchi that was aged longer and it was wonderful! Nice and crisp with a good bite and more heat. \n\nThen the Combo came. The portions were very generous and I enjoyed everything. I sadly couldn't finish the macaroni salad because I was stuffed. Russel then brought out a bunch of sheets of dried seaweed and I finished them off. They were a perfect light salty ending to the meal. Then when I paid he charged me only for the combo, adding nothing for the extra kimchi and seaweed.\n\nThat night I had the Saimin (noodle soup). The noodles were very well cooked with just enough firmness. The soup was tasty, and the small bowl was plenty given that I had stuffed myself at lunch. \n\nIf you are a local or have a car when you visit you definitely have to eat here."

I could see how it would be small when it gets busy but, it's not as small as a \"Hawaii hole in the wall\" would be. \n\nAnyways, when we first entered at 11:15 (15 mins after opening, there was already a couple people waiting on their orders. \nThe gentleman that greeted us (I assume, the owner) told us to sit where ever we wanted and had so much energy that he basically told us the favorites within 5 minutes of sitting down.\n\nI already knew I was going to order the meat jun. \nSince another friend couldn't decide on what to order, she just ordered the combo. \nAnd my roommate ordered, fish jun AND luncheon meat with eggs.\n\n- Meat jun was good that the meat and egg batter was sweet. Slices of meat was thin but, thick enough that it didn't fall apart from the egg. \nThe meat jun sauce wasn't to my liking tho as it isn't as vingegary as Jun's meat jun sauce but, the meat jun itself was good enough that I could eat it without sauce.\n******If I could eat Island Style's meat jun with Jun's sauce then life would be perfect.\n- The combo was good that the chicken and kalbi had a good marinade as it was sweet.\n- Fish jun was good for my friend but, not my cup of tea. He loved his luncheon meat meal out of the two as he hadn't had luncheon meat since being a kid in Hawaii.\n\nThe banchan (Korean side dishes) is better than most places as they had boiled peanuts. Can I just tell you that I haven't had peanuts in FOR-EV-ER!\nKim chee radishes and bean sprouts were yummmmy, too! Not to much spicy and wayyyy crunchy :)\n\nOddly enough, the best thing about the whole meal was the hot tea. We had 3 cupfuls of hot tea before we left. The owner even took the bag of tea root out to show us and told us how to prepare it. \n\nI was so full after this meal that I didn't eat til 9pm the next night. And I still have leftovers!"

I think that bowl could have fed me three meals. Even though I ordered the regular, it came with tons of seafood including mussels, squid, shrimp and octopus. You can vary your spicy level but I thought the broth was very flavorful. By the time I was done eating, it looked like I did no damage.\n\nI came here with a group of friends so I also got to try the ja jang mein (black bean noodle).

I walked into this restaurant not knowing what to expect, so I braced myself in case the food was terrible. Upon entering, I was greeted by uninterested waitresses who looks preoccupied with whatever was going on at the counter. I stood in the middle of the restaurant not knowing whether I should wait to be seated or order up front. Once, they realized that I was confused, they beckoned for me to sit anywhere I please. \n\nThis was not the restaurant you go to if you want fantastic service. It's one of those, our-food-is-delicious-so-come-here-if you'd-like-or-gtfo! Having said that, I was crossing my fingers for the best because I'm not a fan of bad service and bad food! \n\nI mentioned that this was not your typical Hawaiian spot right? It's more of a Korean place with a terrible name! I don't think Island Style suits the food that they serve despite the fact that they have many Hawaiian plates available to order. You can tell this was not a Hawaiian restaurant because half of the restaurant was packed with Koreans enjoying an authentic meal. I felt like I was in an underground Korean joint aliased as Island Style so that when you find it, you're part of a secret society. \n\nI ordered the combination of chicken teriyaki, kalbi, and meat jun. The chicken and kalbi were seasoned the same way with a delicious balance of sauce. I'm not too sure whether you can legitimately call this sauce teriyaki because it tastes nothing like it. Nevertheless, when dipped in house sauce, it was HEAVEN. I swear this was like a rewind back to California's Korean BBQ spots. This restaurant was hands down the best Asian-style bbq I've had here in Vegas. The moment it was delivered to me at the table, I can tell that it was quality meal given the heavenly aroma! It was sweet. It was juicy. And it was slathered in grease. All diets end with this meal. \n\nPart of the combination was meat jun which was thinly sliced beef dipped in egg batter and fried to pure deliciousness. Think omelet and delicious meat mixed and you have, meat jun! If you ever visit this place, the combination plate is your go-to."

And the taste was absolutely amazing, better than a lot of restaurants that specialize in Soondooboo...\n\nThis is by far one of the tastiest restaurants I've been to, and based off of my experience here, I would strongly recommend everybody to come and try it, because they will guarantee, give you the best service and food."

Ivan was truly one of the nicest people you'll ever meet! Always a good story about his childhood and he just love seeing his customers faces as they enjoyed the Ono dishes he would whip up! While Grace has since remarried, the place is still as good as I remember from back then!  She and her new husband have done an awesome job on preserving what made Island Style famous! Meat Jun and the delicious Kalbi are just some of the good eats you'll find at this place. The customer service, the ambiance and the food will just grow on you to the point that it will be a must eat spot every time you come and visit!"

It's located in a small sketchy looking plaza, and may get crowded at times.\n\nI ordered the bulgogi plate whereas my friends got the meat jun combo. Our meals came with a small assortment of fresh banchan. I really liked the kimchi, seaweed salad, and boiled nuts. Before our entrees came out, I was already full from stuffing myself with the banchan. \n\nThe bulgogi was very delicious! I enjoyed every little bit of it - even the leftovers. The meat jun was pretty good as well. And all for around $10. What a steal! My only gripe is that they mixed up my order, which led to a bit of a delay with my entree. But luckily the banchan was there to satisfy me in the meantime. Also their cups have a strange yellow tint we just could not figure out."

It was late, maybe 1:30 and they weren't busy at all on a Saturday.  We were quickly seated and given menus along with iced barley tea and boiled peanuts.  We eagerly fell on the peanuts while perusing their menu.\n\nSo............I hate to do this to a joint that's so highly rated and with such friendly people but..............\n\nMy food came after an appropriate wait, not too long but not particularly quickly either, oxtail soup and spam musubi.  Hubby graciously persuaded me to start eating so I dug in while he snacked on the ban chan and peanuts and tasted my food.  No mac salad, no cold noodles.\n\nAfter another while longer, we noted two, three other tables seated well after us getting all their food and chowing down together.  We gave it a few more minutes because maybe different kitchen zones were less busy than others.  Finally, we had to flag someone down.  The guy said he would go check on our order.\n\nThis part is what peeves me:  I know the temptation to cover up is great.  But I really don't like it when people don't come clean.  Apologize and tell me you forgot the order and I'll most likely forgive you because you were honest.   But don't tell me \"Your order will be out shortly, it just takes a little while.\"  A few minutes later, I see through the window, the cook transferring dark noodles from point A to point B.  They plain forgot about the cold noodles AND the mac salad!  They didn't even acknowledge the mac salad after we got the cold noodles.  We gave them another few minutes and then just had them cancel it and they were like \"Ok.\"\n\nThe food is good and the people are nice which is why I'm still giving them three stars.  But it wasn't busy and there was no reason that not even the mac salad was a no-show. No regrets but probably will try other places next time."

The original gentleman who cooked Hawaiian food for Island Style, as I found out from Russell, passed away in 2002. Russell is half Japanese and half English/Irish and his wife, Gina, is Korean. She worked with the original cook, and when that gentleman passed away, she continued on with his beloved cuisine and also decided to include Korean offerings. Russell said that there was a period of time where she was just using the cheapest canned ingredients from Sam's Club or Costco, but since he entered the business, they have been making everything fresh. \n\nWe were sitting amongst some elderly and another family and everyone seemed very laid back while enjoying their seemingly scrumptious morsels and bites.\n\nHe appetized our palates with\n\nBoiled Peanuts: a complimentary and delicious appetizer of whole peanuts still in their shells that have been boiled in a soy-based brine with a very unique blended texture of hard and soft.\n\nSpicy Cucumber: a complimentary, crisp, and slightly tangy side dish\n\nRadish and Kimchee: I didn't care much for the radish, and the kimchee was still refrigerator temperature cold, but it was delicious\n\nWe ordered the\n\nHot Rock Pot Bi Bim Bop (Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop): Delicious rice, perfectly runny egg, thin strips of nori, and a blend of vegetables in this super hot rock pot will make your mouth water before, during, and after! The rice touching the rock pot is crispy and just the way I like it, like a crust made from rice. \n\nCombo (Kalbi, Chicken, Jun): standardly marinated and grilled meats, mostly tender and came over white rice\n\nI will be back to try other items. For their prices, their top-notch service, and their intense flavors in foods down to every detail, they definitely deserve five stars."

The bbq chicken was juicy and full of flavor! Rice was great!! (Being from hawaii rice is very important, if get crunchy dried rice its almost no sense to eat lol!) But no worries rice was cooked perfect and the mac salad with some sriracha was mean!! The guy serving us was very nice, always making sure we were ok. He sounded like he was from hawaii but didn't ask, will next time though! After we paid he even gave us some otter pops!!! That was awesome, brought back memories from hanabata days!

What we had was the teriyaki salmon and the fried rice, the son had the spam masubi. What we also tried was the this fried wonton gyoza type thing, I'm not sure what the name of it was, because he brought it out to us \"on the house\". They brought in some side dishes before our meal that was kimchi, sprouts, hotdogs, and some radish type thingy. I really want to describe all my food (but I will only reviews my teriyaki salmon) and everything I sampled from others that were with us, but the thing is, I'm not sure what their meal was, but what I can tell you is that everything I did try was really really good, with no complaints whatsover. \n\nOk for our teriyaki salmon, it was probably the best salmon I've ever tasted at a restaurant, they made my food perfect. Don't you hate it when your fish turns out dry because it has been over cooked? well this salmon was a bit rawish in the middle, I guess you can say it was cooked \"rare\" I guess you can say in steak terms. I love raw fish (sushi type) and this meal reminded me just that, cooked on the outside, but slightly in the inside. Just typing about my meal is making me hungry again. It was nice and juice cooked to perfection with some yummy dipping sauce and mac salad and rice on the side. YUUUMMMMMMM\n\nI will cut this review short because I will come back and re review this place. I really wanted to try the oxtail soup on the menu, but already thought we ordered way too much food. I'll be back for more soon.\n\nUsually a good service place + really really good food = 5 stars, but I yet I only gave e'm 4. I will promise an update after I try their oxtail soup and if knocks me out of the park, I will definitely give this place a home run (5 stars). You can check out what we had at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkcFRZ8rE1c&feature=plcp (this video is about our days, so skip to 1:50 to see the food).

Looking for a restaurant that compares to Island Sushi is difficult in Las Vegas, so I looked for a four plus star restaurant. The restaurant is compact with wooden tables, wooden floor, and little room to move in. I started thinking that maybe I should go to Diamond China for their delicious steamed fish. I got a menu to order take out... Holy!!! Korean food?! Great! I am tempted to order here now being a fellow Korean.\n\nI got the spicy chick (Korean style) with the hopes that it compares with my mother's. Brown rice added. The server came and gave me boiled peanuts and water as I waited for my order. This is the first restaurant in Las Vegas that I have been to with a boiled peanut appetizer. Amazing!!! So far, so good.\n\nKorean spicy chicken is usually only good if the bone(s) are still attached to the chicken. I took some boiled peanuts to go along with some sriracha sauce to mix with the brown rice. The chicken is delicious although it came in chopped thigh pieces (no bones). I was quite amazed at the flavor of the dish. The take out order came with kimchi (kimchi is good, but better at Mr. Tofu) and macaroni salad as well. I think I could have gotten more chicken pieces, but it was definitely worth a try.\n\nI am excited to check out the soon dubu as it will be compared to Mr. Tofu."

It's so tender and flavorful. From what I remember, it is about $15. Expensive, but you're getting really big portions. You could share the meal with someone, especially since it comes with a giant pile of homemade macaroni salad (yum!). When it's cold outside, I like warming up with a hot bowl of soondubu. It's a Korean soup made with soft tofu, egg, and green onions. They add a seafood twist to it with shrimp and muscles. It's definitely a nice touch to the mildly spicy soup.\n\nOverall, I always leave Island Style with a tummy full of delicious food that always comes with a side of great service.

The banchan are always good with extra care put into everything.  The most nostalgic thing is the complimentary boiled peanuts.  Ono!  No matter how busy, they treat you like family.  This is the best Korean / Hawaiian Plate Lunch place in Vegas.  Why?  Because they know how to cook, they use quality ingredients and they actually care about their customer and what they do."

            "review": "Started off with a tasty batch of boiled peanuts.  Then the owner comes by with a big serving of kimchee which he proceeds to cut right on the table.  We introduce ourselves and immediately, I like the guy.  Terrific owner and a wonderful host.  \n\nI ordered the combo platter and a side of fried eggs.  The combo platter is a mountain of food consisting of a lot of rice, a huge piece of LA kalbi, chicken teriyaki bbq, and the biggest piece of meat jun that I have ever seen.  Also, the side of macaroni salad served as a great palate cleanser.  I tried to finish the plate but could not finish the rice.  The food brought back many childhood memories of Korean beach bbqs in Guam, namely in Ypao Beach, Tamuning.  Amazing.  \n\nWill have to try the Korean food next time.  A must visit for anyone who spent any time on the islands."

This place is AWESOME!!! don't judge the appearance of the restaurant coz their food are SUPER delicious, could find anything in Seattle that could compare to this one!!! Their appt Kim-Chi is just great, not to mention the boiled peanuts as well. The owner/server was SUPER nice, after he knew we want to bring home some spicy cold noodles. He gave us the raw noodles and advice us how to make it at home with all their sauce!!!! \n\nThey are now one of our MUST-GO places when we visit vegas!!!!"

I love that this place is a hole-in-the-wall also. \n\nThe food here is great! Not the top of my list, but definitely worth a visit every time I'm on/near Sahara! I usually get the BBQ Combo, because it comes with a LOAD of stuff, and the Stone Pot (Dolsot) Bibimbap is worth mentioning too. I also like that boiled peanuts and side dishes are served almost immediately after taking a seat.\n\nThey also have a booth in Greenland Supermarket! I haven't made my way to that one just yet, but i'm sure they've still got it goin' on!"
