When we came in  though it was really cute. The person at the front was really nice. We got a kisses waffle that was really good. Not like a waffle i have tasted before also got a vanilla latte with whipped cream that was super good. The bacon waffle also looked good. Next time."

I ordered the Country Chick Sandwich with avacado, chips and a green tea, a chicadilla, the cinnamon sugar waffles, and the wafflenut with Nutella and almonds-- OMG I'm full!  This place is pretty awesome.  Definitely not a dieting place though lol... Their waffles have got to be one of the best I've tried.  Served up fresh and warm, the waffles are nice and crisp on the outside, and chewy on the inside.  Loved it.  \n\nIt's located on the corner of Flamingo and Maryland in the Target complex.  Really chill environment.  Great for breakfast or lunch, or maybe a snack or dessert.  There were 2 girls behind the counter cooking and taking orders.  Super friendly staff.  I think they have wifi, because a lot of college students look like they were meeting to get work done.  \n\nDefinitely enjoyed this place.  I just wish it was closer to my house!"

            "review": "We came here on a Saturday and it was really busy. The wait took forever because the amount of people there. There's also a limited amount of tables available. And from what I saw, they only had three waffle makers. You would expect a waffle place to have more waffle makers than just three, which probably added to the wait. Unless, they have more waffle makers hidden from view, which makes the waiting a little worse if they do. However, I suppose the waffles were worth the wait.\n\nThey are pretty cheap for a big (at least for me) sized waffle. Here in California, waffles that big cost about $9-$10 but in Vegas, they were half the price. They have a variety of different waffles to choose from if you prefer waffles or a waffle sandwich. They even have a vegan menu if that's for you. They also have a huge variety of drinks.\n\nI'll definitely be back here again when I return to Vegas. I look forward to trying the different waffles and drinks on their menu."

Right when we came in, they greeted us. Since it was our first time here we took a while to choose what we wanted.  I ended up ordering a West Coast. It was okay! I wish they put more chicken. The cheese melted with the waffle which made it taste good! I also ordered a honey cream latte. I'm no coffee person so I can't tell what coffees are good but my friends and boyfriend said it was \"really\" good. The last thing I ordered was a Red Velvet. I personally liked it because it wasn't as sweet. It kinda bothered me because it was so perfect... (Hahahaha). I had a weird urge to stab the holes... When I'm near Vegas again, I am definitely coming back! \n\nStars for the customer service! There was one lady who was kind of rude but then two other employees took her place right away when they saw our faces from smiles to me and my friend looking each other giving \"She's so rude\" look. (Yes, it's a thing haha.) Usually they would charge for Avocado and Chips but they just gave it to us for free with a smile. Thank you again! :D"

My husband I went shortly after they opened and we were the only guests dining in - there was a couple take-outs while we waited and dined (their website permits for online orders).\n\nWe were assisted by Mae (one of the owners) who was incredibly friendly and welcoming about our first visit.\n\nMy husband had the red velvet waffles, I had the #breakfast sandwich. I had a Carmel apple cider (by far much better than Starbucks) and my husband had a mocha latte (great also). \n\nWhile we did wait about 15-20 minutes for our food (not bad by any regular standards) - Mae was apologetic for our time waiting and treated us to a sample of their Churronimo (delicious!).\n\nWill definitely revisit in the future!"

Last time we had the lemon puppy seeds waffle at Mother hubbard's it was disaster...They effing poured the lemon syrup and sprinkled the puppy seeds over the plain waffle. And we waited for 45 min for that lousy waffle. Still pissed me off today!!! \n \nSolid 4 stars."

            "review": "I've gone here twice now after buying a Groupon worth $8 each for three visits. My first visit was early in the morning on my way to work and I decided to try one of their lattes and salads out. I ordered the green tea latte to drink there and the kale salad to eat for lunch later on. The green tea latte was very good. The size was reasonable and the price is what's expected even without the Groupon discount. The kale salad was also very good, decently proportioned and reasonably priced. The lady that was working there was very kind and helpful. It's good to say that my first experience there was rather pleasant and I was excited to drop by again to try the waffles.\n\nI came in the second time with my boyfriend so that we could both try the waffles. I was looking forward to purchase the red velvet waffle since red velvet is one of my all time favorite flavors lol. After ordering, I sat down and waited for our waffles to be done. I noticed an uncleaned table the table over us. This table was not cleaned the entire time we were there. Now, I used to work at a food establishment and I can be very understanding in certain situations. One, the place wasn't busy. There were probably 4 people eating including us with a few customers coming in to order. Two, there were three people in the back because I counted 2 guys and 1 lady. One of the three could have easily cleared out the table the entire time I was there. It's just professional to keep your establishment clean. The workers seemed rather distracted and too busy talking to each other rather than checking the dining area for mess.\n\nWe finally got our waffles after 15 minutes or so. I feel like that's rather a long wait for just two small orders of waffles. I ordered the red velvet one (of course) whereas my boyfriend ordered the regular golden waffles. We both agreed they were good after finishing them. They only gave us two waffles per order and you'd have to pay an extra $2 for another one. But for the price, you get what you paid for so it was fine. However, on the website's menu, it says that you get more with the waffles like bacon and eggs. This is very misleading because I did not. It doesn't say on the menu at the store so I wasn't so surprised when I got my food. I just think that the website menu should be updated so that future customers are not mislead.\n\nOverall, the waffles were good, the coffee was good and the salad was good. The customer service may need a little work however."

I got the Guru Burger and thought it was quite good- this is definitely a compliment from me because, honestly, I'm not usually a huge fan of waffle sandwichs! My previous waffle sandwich experiences have always left me feeling like I could have made the sandwich at home with two Eggo waffles (and it, honestly, would have probably been easier to eat than the folded, taco-ish style they all go for!). This waffle sandwich blew my Eggo creations to the wayside- their waffles are really flavorful and fluffy, better than I've had in ages. I also had one of their seasonal lattes- the Fa La La Latte, because I'm a sucker for anything mint!- and a bit of the lavender latte on accident... which, leads me to my only complaint about this place. I came with a friend who has a very similar sounding name to mine and when the barista called out her name, we both thought it was mine because I had ordered a few minutes before her... well, we were definitely wrong! I thought the latte didn't have much mint to it (but it was damn good, either way!) but didn't think anything of it until the barista called out my name followed by the name of my latte about 5 minutes later. That could have been avoided so easily just by writing the name on the cup. Having to remake a drink sucks way more than taking the 5 seconds to write a name on the cup! Either way, great coffee and great waffles- would recommend! :)"

This was 9:30 am and there were only 6 other people in there the entire 1:15 hours we were there. Really cute place, small portions at great prices; but it just doesn't matter when they are so slow. Seriously, the woman behind the counter was even moving slow, no sense that people might be coming to her food establishment because they are hungry. And - the reason for 1 star- I could see her work because I was facing the counter, she was handling all the food with her bare hands. Picking up waffles, slicing strawberries, AND taking cash, answering the business phone, texting on her cell phone, never putting on gloves to handle food AND never washed her hands. Disgusting, I won't be back."

Definitely recommend hitting up this little gem next time you're in Vegas and don't want that tourist Vegas service. :)"

I am an admittedly picky diner as I am a pretty good cook myself...Bacon-stuffed Belgian waffle was cooked to perfection!! Wanted to eat the whole thing but was pleasantly stuffed after adding a fresh fruit cup for a dollar and a caramel frappe. :) Fruit cup was amazingly fresh, tasty and ample (for only a dollar extra, mind you), and caramel frappe did not disappoint! Total cost was under 15 bucks with tip. -Not bad for Vegas fare!! Eat breakfast here over the Strip!!!!!"

No menus just stand up and order from the board. The iced macchiato I ordered was absolutely delicious & came with a piece of churro waffle. My waffle breakfast sandwich was also very tasty and my grandparents loved their meals as well. My grandma had a red velvet waffle and my grandpa had a blueberry waffle.

The toasty Tokyo was good along with the waffle club.  \nThe groupon and punch cards are a nice touch.

I was greeted by the friendly cashier who was open to answering all of my first time client questions. I ordered two regular caramel macchiatos and also received a macadamia/caramel Lolly waffle for checking in. The macchiatos barely had a caramel taste, but did showcase the fresh coffee it was made with. Definitely better quality and more refreshing than any chain coffee shop. The Lolly waffle was satisfying but had an awful amaretto after taste and was undercooked in the center. If they gave their waffle maker a good scrubbin' and ditched the almond tang, I think the lolly waffle could have a chance to be great. Overall, the customer service was friendly and coffee was tasty, but the lolly waffle and cleanliness of the establishment need improvement."

Today though, years later, my bf went to pick one up for me. \n\nWhen I first saw it my initial reaction was that it looked more green than usual. And then when I tried it, it was definitely NOT the kale champ I knew and loved. It was waaaay too bitter and I felt they left out an ingredient, maybe banana. Had I gone there and ordered it myself and tried it before leaving, I would have asked them to recheck it or add something to it to make it drinkable.

It'd be easy to miss it if you don't know where to look! \n\nIt's a small cozy cafe with seating for around 30-40 people? It's super close to UNLV which makes it a prime place to go to for a coffee break and possibly to study. They do have free WiFi! And the owners are pretty cool and really nice.\n\nI ended up getting waffles and tea, more specifically I got the vegan version of Viva Las Elvis with vegan ice cream. It's a waffle with peanut butter, honey (agave if vegan version), and coconut bacon with a scoop of ice cream on top. It was pretty good, nothing too spectacular. The peanut butter melted into the waffle which was pretty awesome, because I mean melted peanut butter on anything is delicious! And the ice cream was well vegan vanilla ice cream and wasn't too special to me. \n\nI'll probably not get tea again, only because it was $2 for a bag and one cup of hot water. I'm not sure if they'll give you more hot water, but one bag and one cup of water doesn't seem like it's worth it. \n\nMy biggest gripe was that it was DIRTY. I mean the tables, I went through two tables and they were both dirty. There was dried syrup on them and stains from the last customers. I looked down to see if there were any other tables, but most of them seemed like they were dirty to me. I tried cleaning some of it off, but most of it didn't come off with a napkin and some water. That to me is disgusting especially since it seems most people leave their dishes and the owners clean it off. That's just how it looked to me, when other customers ate and then left. When I got there the whole cafe was empty but as I sat there there were people that came and go. So they didn't really have an excuse to be dirty. \n\nI do however want to try some other menu items the next time I go. I just hope it's cleaner this time. I like the owners, they're pretty nice to talk to. I like the atmosphere. I like the location. I like some of their food so far. But I don't like dirty tables where I'm going to eat especially at cafe/restaurants/etc."

Located at 3961 South Maryland Parkway, it is at the Mission Center just north of the main UNLV campus. This place has some appealing waffle options that are different from what you'd expect elsewhere.\n\nThis spot focuses heavily on unique waffle creations. These include traditional waffles as well as some sandwiches that use waffles.\n\nA Different Approach\n\nTiabi Coffee and Waffle is a contemporary dining spot that offers various types of waffles. It has many vegan food options and plenty of different coffee choices. It was established in 2013 and continues to be an entertaining place for waffles.\n\nThis spot has a rather modern look that isn't too unique or different. Still, it is an intriguing place to visit. It has a friendly look to it that stands out as an inviting spot for all members of the family.\n\nWhat Does It Take To Get Waffles?\n\nThe food here at Tiabi is excellent but it can take a while to get. We waited about twenty minutes to get our food. However, we assume that this is because the food is so intricate and designed with an immense approach to detail.\n\nThe people here are friendly and do well with getting orders down. They always ensure that the food is made precisely as desired. The fact that these people can work with vegan requests if desired is an attractive point too. It ensures that people can get a great waffle even if they have particular limits on what they will eat.\n\nGreat Foods All Around\n\nThe foods here start with plenty of great signature beverages. Tiff's Waffle Macchiato has cinnamon vanilla macchiato with a churro waffle and whipped cream. This has a brilliant design that is creamy and detailed.\n\nThe Stiles Java Jolt has a vanilla breve misto and vanilla with a bit of extra espresso. This adds an extra amount of caffeine to create a good taste. Various frappes and teas are all around the place too.\n\nThe creative nature of this place is particularly highlighted in the waffle sandwiches it offers. The Waffledilla features chicken, Tiabi sauce and melted cheese and an optional avocado. This is carefully made with waffle patties to establish a great flavor all around.\n\nThe classic options here are interesting to see as well. The Strawberry Kisses waffle mixes sliced strawberries with a chocolate drizzle. The Viva Las Elvis waffle has bananas and peanut butter plus chopped bacon. A bit of honey is added to create a stronger flavor too."

A+ on the drink.\n\nI also ordered some golden classic Belgium waffles. Finally, I find a place here in Las Vegas with real waffles. Waffles are supposed to consist of a juxtapose balance of crispy exteriors and soft almost custardy interiors. These waffles had that. They were so delightful to eat that I didn't even bother drenching them with maple syrup or butter. \n\nI would definitely go again for their coffee and 2 nice little Belgium waffles to accompany my delightful coffee. Great job Taibi!\n-Ozzy"

There were only two employees working there, and we understood how difficult it must be preparing for two medium sized tables, but the thirty minute wait for our food was just too long, and that ultimately contributed to my three-star review. :( \n\nOn the other hand, I'd give the food a four. I split a West Coast and South American. I'd highly recommend the classic waffle with sandwiches instead of the Belgian! They ran out of ham for the South American, but they compensated it with bacon and chicken; it basically became another West Coast though. Our party also checked into Yelp, and received the wafflenut. I tried the white chocolate macadamia, and although it wasn't exceptional, it was still delicious. :)"

They have all different types of waffles that will satisfy your craving. I personally love the waffledilla. It's the cheapest waffle sandwhich and will melt in your mouth! It's chicken, cheese, special sauce (that is sooooo yummy) in between a waffle folded in half and is super scrumptious. You can add a fruit bowl (variety so I'd ask what kind they have that day in case you are allergic or don't like a certain type of food) or homemade chips just for $1! Sweet deal! And it's pretty much a meal. They have a water pitcher towards the back. But they also have teas and smoothies. I haven't tried the smoothies but I want to! I like the \"Just Peachy\" tea. It's not too sweet but has a good taste. I always suggest this place because it's very central, it's cheap, they have dessert waffles too (try the red velvet) and they're friendly.

I would always go to the target in the same plaza and Sakana sushi right next to it, so I always saw Tiabi's sign... I just never actually went in until a few weeks ago! Since then I've been addicted and wish I walked in to try it sooner! \nSo far I've tried the Break Your Fast, Hashtag Breakfast Sandwich, Tokyo Sandwich, Guru Burger, and the churro waffle as well as the Honey Cream Latter, Lavender Latte, and my favorite yet - the Pistachio latte!! I am seriously addicted. \n\nNeedless to say, customer service is amazing. The staff are all so welcoming and kind. \n\nAs for the food.. The way they make their waffles is so different than I'm used to. They're thinner than typical fluffy waffles, which give their sandwiches the perfect crunch and texture! I assumed the waffle sandwiches would be soggy, but they weren't at all. Also, for the dessert waffles, the waffles have the perfect texture. While the outside is crispy, the inside is still quite fluffy despite how thin it is! Specifically for the churro waffle, the cinnamon sugar was not at all too strong, it was perfect.. Not too sweet and not at all lacking flavor. Also don't be shy about trying out any of their waffle sandwiches, at first I was skeptical because I've never tried a waffle sandwich, but each one I've tried have been really good. Tiabi puts flavors and items that really compliment each other. I don't even know what their Tiabi sauce consists of, but it's a great flavor in many of their items. \nOkay now for the drinks... If I had to single out my ultimate favorite Tiabi menu item I would have to say 100% the PISTACHIO LATTE. Hahaha. The staff must think I'm crazy because I've been coming back so many times for that drink. I get it hot with soy and ahhh it's literally heaven. It's so good that I make any of my friends around me to try it and each one of them were in love too. It's so silky with that perfect flavor of pistachio - seriously spot on pistachio! I have also tried the Lavender Latte and the Honey Cream Latte, which are good as well, but no where near the pistachio latte! Hahah\n\nSo by my review I think it's only obvious that I'm in love with this little whole in the wall and would recommend anyone to stop by. Aside from their food and drinks options, the little cafe itself is so adorable!! The decorations are cute and it's so cozy to do homework/study or even hang out with friends. Even though it's a bit small, they actually have plenty of tables/seats and even a cozy couch! Plus each table has a deck of cards and they also offer of board games for people to play as well. Awesome place, great food/drinks, with a lovely staff :)"

The \"West Coast\", I was told is the fan favorite and if you read what I wrote above, that's easy to believe. This sammie is big, about half the size of an average dinner plate. The tasty ingredients are added to the savory waffle, then folded over to immediately give you this pocket-like snack item. As I ate, I was afraid of two things; all of the food falling out of the opposite biting side, and a weird sweet waffle paired with cheese. My fears waffled away as the crunch of the bacon filled my ears, the tender & juicy chicken, cheese, and veggies came together in the warm waffle. This sandwich was fantastic, and turned out to be one of those food items you realize you haven't put down since the first bite. This Wafflicious sammie was paired with seasoned homemade waffle chips. Fantastic mutated breakfast/ lunch combo.\n\nThe Stiles Java Jolt was delicious. Espresso, coffee, and just a tad of vanilla flavoring. I went half on the flavoring, because I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but Normally it comes with four pumps of vanilla. I could have drank two more of these delicious caffeinated bullets, but then I might turn into Spider-Man and climb the walls."

            "review": "Bought the groupon so I had the opportunity to check out this spot 3 times. Suffice to say, after all 3 visits, I thought that it was OK.\n\nI guess that this place focuses mainly on waffles used in a traditional sense, with sweet toppings, as well as savory preparations, such as using a pair of waffles as a bun for a sandwich.\n\nFirst off, I would say that using the groupon was pretty difficult here. I had 3 of them, good for $8 to spend. The waffles ranged from 5-6 dollars, and the coffee drinks ranged from 4-5. You do the math. I think it would have been better to offer 2 $5 for $10, instead of the 3 $4 for $8.\n\nThe good news first. The fillings and toppings they use are great! For the hashtag breakfast sandwich, the egg and turkey sausage was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. For the Tokyo sandwich, the chicken was moist and tender, and the veggies were very fresh. The sauces they use are well balanced, the sweet ones aren't too sweet, and the savory sauces are packed with flava!\n\nThe bad news. I hated the waffle. I've tried both the thin waffle they use for sandwiches, and the thicker Belgium style one. My conclusion is that I frankly don't like their waffle recipe. They both had a strong metallic taste that resonated the more I ate it. This happens when I eat biscuits or other quick breads that use too much leavening, such as baking powder. This may be the culprit. The interior of the waffle is pretty doughy as well. \n\nAlso, it took a little longer that I though it would to receive my order. On my last visit, I ordered a waffle sandwich, lolly waffle, and small hot coffee, and I timed them at 16 minutes. It would be better than to rather than to stack 3 separate customer orders at the same time, it's better to do one order at a time, because the 2 other people received their orders 1 minute after mine was ready :/\n\nThe coffee is ok but pricy for the portion size. The employees are nice and friendly, but also they seem to be easily distracted.\n\nWasn't the worst waffle, but not the best. Slightly middle of the pack is where I would put them. If you are in the mood for a savory waffle sandwich, this place would be the place to go because no one else in town is doing it (RIP Bread and Butter). Liked everything 'cept for the waffle itself. 'Nuff said."

As I walked in, I noticed how lovely it smelled and was excited to try their waffles.\n \nWe sat and perused the menu for a while and I was a little disappointed that no one really checked on us or even asked if we wanted waters or more menus than just the one for our group of three. We finally figured out what we wanted and went up to the counter to order.\n\nThe lady behind he counter kept interrupting my dining companion as he started to order by yelling behind to another person who worked there. I thought that was a little rude, so that definitely put me off.\n\nOur food took a while to come, but it looked really pretty. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n-red velvet wafflenut \n-Nutella and almond wafflenut \n-The Fat Elvis waffle\n-Strawberry and chocolate waffle\n-Vegas churro waffle with honey, cinnamon, sugar and vanilla ice cream\n\nEverything was solid. The consensus was that the churro waffle was the favorite and I personally enjoyed the strawberry waffle, minus the chocolate sauce. \n\nService needs work and the location is awkward, so I don't see myself making much effort to come back to this place in the future."

Waffle breakfasts, waffle sandwiches, waffle coffees. We went here in the afternoon when it was slow; no lines and plenty of staff running around. My party ordered three food items and three drinks. The first two waffles came out in about 10 minutes. The third took 30 MORE MINUTES. The first two were done with their meals (and then drinks) before the last waffle came out. There were three staff members basically standing around looking at the waffle makers. No one looked like they were in a hurry to get our food out. There was no apologies or anything as to why the food took 40 minutes after ordering to be prepared. \n\nThe food and drink were good once they were out, but I expect a business, whose sole food item is waffles, to be able to put out items in a reasonable amount of time. I suggest they order an extra waffle maker (or dozen) so this isn't a hamper on their business anymore. I sincerely hope they fix this, for an otherwise fine cafe."

            "review": "It's been a while since I wrote a review, but I wanted to write one about my favorite cafe - TIABI.\n\nTIABI - \"To Inspire And Be Inspired\". I discovered this little place through a student organization at UNLV. They are super close to campus and an excellent place to \"be inspired,\" in my case this is the only place where I know I can sit down and focus on writing and studying. I've been here several times already and have accomplished so much (yelping reviews is the bottom of my list up until now). \n\nFirst, the only downside I can mention is that there is only one wall outlet (that I know) where I can plug in. That little area has become my personal spot. Other than that, I thoroughly love this venue.\n\nLocation/Open times: TIABI is down the street from UNLV. It is in a secluded area of the Target shopping plaza right next to a great sushi place. As a potential schoolteacher, the 7am open time is right when I have to get to class but it is open until 8pm on most days making it a good place to have breakfast on my off days, lunch, or chillax after class/work.\n\nAesthetics: Local art, waffle \"hashtags\" everywhere, a couple of couches and sturdy tables and seating. The wired art light fixtures  add a nice rustic look (though they tend to accumulate dust quickly). Nothing is too distracting, and I can zone into my work or a conversation easily. Their playlists are provided by Pandora and varies by the people working, but I have enjoyed the musical tastes of the staff thus far, ranging from islander to indie.\n\nFood: In the words of a lego dude, \"EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!\" There are plenty of options, especially health and allergy conscious, handcrafted on the spot. I have always enjoyed that \"fresh\" taste and have never suffered a regretful feeling leaving (as is sometimes the case with Chipotle or even Starbucks). As I am writing this review, I am having their red velvet waffle (so sweet and delectable) paired with a new beverage, the Frankenstein frappe, a cool and refreshing drink lightly sweetened with agave but not so much as to overpower the taste of the coffee. I am enjoying myself and am getting my morning kick (which is why I can write). \n\nService: The owners, Tiff and Mae, are both super awesome and have taken care of me on numerous occasions. Their staff are just as kind and sociable, and I haven't had a problem striking up a conversation as I am often here alone. I feel as welcome as sitting at a desk in my own living room. I'm surprised that not as many people come to just hang out, but I'm certain that will change as more people come to know about TIABI.\n\nI like small hole-in-the-wall local places, and I feel especially at home at this one. Hope this review was inspiring!"

The place was slammed and the four employees behind the counter were busy making fresh smoothies, espresso, waffles, and the like.\n\nMy iced honey latte was perfection. Fresh espresso, cream, and a touch of honey. It wasn't overly sweet and it still tasted like coffee. Really enjoyed it. It was just too small. I had to order another.\n\nI got the Hashtag Breakfast Sandwich. Really nothing too special about it. Fresh made waffle, egg, cheese, and sausage. Wasn't awful, wasn't knock my socks off. It was offered with either a side of fruit or house made chips for $1, I opted with the fruit (because this was a total fat kid breakfast).\n\nAs I stated previously, the place was slammed. My friend and I snagged a table after a group of four left. We stacked up the dishes and ate at the \"dirty\" table because we are savages and needed the immune system boost.  We sat at that dirty table and the place had died down, not once did the 4 people behind the counter begin to clean the place up or even clear our dishes. \n\nDecent spot, coffee was the bombDOTcom, food was meh.

After greeting us, the cashier noticed that we were probably new to the place, so he told us a little about the ordering process and menu (regular items, faves, and seasonal specials). Pretty chill and nice guy. \nThe sister ordered the Halloween-themed menu for a waffle and a cold latte. Mom ordered a Halloween-themed hot latte with a West Coast Wafflewich. I ordered a cold Chocolate Coconut with a West Coast Wafflewich. Hahaha... The sister liked her waffle and her drink, but she wished she had ordered the same wafflewich as us. It had a pretty amazing sauce, and the ingredients tasted as fresh as can be. I will admit that I wish I had their latte though. Don't get me wrong 'cause I liked my drink, but I tasted more chocolate than coconut, and I'm looking for a balance. \nThe cashier also kept making sure we were okay as I got the food whenever it was ready to be picked up from the counter.

The creations are also pretty darn creative so you don't really lose with any choice, sweet or savory.\n\nI went with the Viva las Elvis cause peanut butter, bacon, and honey are a match made in heaven. My only complaint (and I feel like I'm disappointing so many people saying this) was that there was too much peanut butter. It completely overwhelmed the bacon. I also had visions about adding some chocolate to this dish so I stole a chocolate chip off my brother's waffle and yes, it was 100% worth it. Also, paired it with a honey cream latte - yum!\n\nBrother went with the red velvet waffle. He said it was pretty simple, but it was still very good. Mom and dad shared their choices a wafflezilla and west coast waffle with a fruit cup. Both enjoyed the savory/sandwich twist for their breakfast and they were also impressed with the fruit cup which featured fresh chopped fruits. Mom had the pistachio latte, which is definitely more on the sweet, not really coffee side. The only caveat was that food prep was a tad slow. Each person's meal came out one by one. Hard to have a holistic breakfast this way....but it's a small operation. \n\nAll in all, it was a delicious experience."

            "review": "I used to love Tiabi, thought it was the best waffle place in Vegas for vegans. Until the past couple of times I've ordered my waffles to go & they were completely burnt to a crisp!!! The first time this happened I called them & they replaced it but I had to drive back there to pick it up which was annoying but because I loved their waffles that made it worth it. Now, this just happened today. I ordered 2 vegan golden waffles. When I picked them up I had to check them to make sure they were okay because of the previous incident. So One waffle was soft & warm like it should be while the other was hard & stiff, resembling a piece of card board! So I have my boyfriend take it back to them to make me a new one & he showed them the difference between the waffles. He then asks my boyfriend if he touched it like duh! Why would I waste my time returning it. So we were in a rush & couldn't wait an extra 15 mins for a waffle so we told him we'd be back. When we come back the waffle was SO COLD & EVEN MORE HARD & BURNED THAN THE FIRST WAFFLE. I was furious. HENCE MY REVIEW. I've never had service like this before they've always been kind & helpful. So basically when I go in I show him the first waffle that I kept, I picked it up showing how it can actually move & is soft then show him how hard the \"new\" waffle he gave me & how cold it was!!! Like I honestly don't understand how someone that works in the food & beverage industry feels okay handing out COLD food to a customer?!?!?! Even McDonald's employees know better than that (not to speak down on them). I think he must of been new or something because he tried to tell me that it's because of the batter that vegan waffles are hard & that it's been sitting out waiting for me that's why it got cold. I told him I come here often & I've had soft vegan waffles & I also told him it's unacceptable to serve cold food! I was completely frustrated I just asked for a refund so I gave them back their cold hard waffle & the other waffle I held on to & received a refund ... I suggest going in the morning when they open, the guy who opens (I forget his name) is very kind & always makes my orders great. Also the black guy is very kind & assists with any issue or concern ... if this didn't happen today Tiabi would've gotten 5 stars but because of this guy & his poor service it dropped to a weak 3.... I honestly might just have to drive to the summerlin location to get better service"

My wife ordered the banana Nutella waffle which came out first and the waffle was overcooked and very dry. The Nutella was flavorless and limited as it was drizzled on. My only other experience to compare this type of waffle with was at Disneyworld and there waffle was moist, soft and warm with the Nutella adding a great accent. \nI ordered the hashtag waffle and a banana Nutella for me. The hashtag was again an overcooked, dry and burnt in some areas waffle with turkey sausage that tasted like they came out of the frozen foods section at Von's supermarket.  Completely flavorless. The egg that came with it I cannot not even explain what it looked like.  My banana Nutella waffle did not even look like my wife's as by the time I got it I was told they were having issues with there waffle maker. It reminded me of one my 12 year old made me for Father's Day. \n\nThe Ugly\nDue to technical problems everything took twice as long as long as it should.  I even saw A gentleman get up who had been waiting there before us asking why was it taking so long for his food.  For my inconvenience of waiting so long they offered me a cookie. At that moment they should've offered to discount my food at least. \n\nOne of the things I hate having to do on a yelp review is do a negative review. Hopefully, for others they will not receive this type of food or delay.  My goal is always to stay away from the chain restaurants and find those little hidden gems in the city.  Unfortunately, I didn't find the gem."

            "review": "OK, this is a lengthy review.  here's a summary:  The wait is FOREVER.  If you're disabled or in a hurry, skip it.  If you're fully-abled with plenty of time on your hands, Tiabi is probably worth the wait.\n\nNow for the actual review:\n\nThis place is very popular - there wasn't an empty seat in the house.  This is a problem for me as I'm disabled.  I was feeling halfway decent today and decided to take my daughter out for a (long overdue) mommy/daughter date, since I don't get to do that very often.\n\nWe went inside and stared at the menu for a few minutes.  It's big and on the wall near the front of the store, which is convenient.  After deciding what we wanted, I walked around to find the area for placing an order.  There are 3 sections where the counter is open, so they all appear to be there for communicating with the people behind the counter.  After examining the other items at the counter (there's stuff everywhere), however, it wasn't obvious where to stand to place an order.  One of the staff members saw the lost look on my face and directed me to the right place.  Once there I noticed an ipad on the counter which I assume they use to take orders.\n\nWe moved to the appropriate counter spot (which is at the front of the store, by the menu), and then waited to be helped.  I was able to wait for 10 minutes, but that's when my back issues kicked in.  In that time, we were given an apology, but no other eye contact or acknowledgement.  I got the impression that they were overwhelmed and didn't WANT to take anymore orders.  I've worked in retail and food service, so I know how that that is.  It was probably a blessing that they didn't take my order, as I wouldn't have been capable of standing around much longer to wait for the food.\n\nIn their defense, all 3 employees were shuffling around and working very hard.  The place was just seriously understaffed.  They could've used AT LEAST 2 more people today.  Since my back issues don't allow me to stand for extended periods of time, I hate to say that I won't be able to return to this establishment.  For anyone in the same boat - having limited physical abilities - I'd suggest ordering Tiabi for delivery if you live close enough, or just try a different waffle bar.  The one at Tivoli has plenty of seating and wasn't busy when I went.\n\nI was very disappointed.  My young daughter was VERY excited to try some new and desserty waffles.  It kills me to get that far into the process, only to break her heart and go somewhere else.  It also sucks because I'm usually in too much pain (or too medicated) to even leave the house.  So when I do leave the house, every minute counts and is very special to me.  Don't take your good health for granted!!!!!!!!\n\nNot entirely related, but worth noting:  Across the street from Tiabi, the wash runs between Toys R Us and Seafood City.  This part of the wash spawns a lot of water pokemon, which are hard to find elsewhere in the desert.\n\nI kinda wish I could leave a review without giving a star rating.  Although I couldn't try the food, it's obviously good.  They wouldn't have been that busy if they weren't doing something right.  I just REALLY REALLY REALLY wish the owners would staff it better, or maybe expand or something.  We aren't all fully-abled college students with the ability to wait around all day.  I also want to mention that I'm NOT the type of person who expects everyone to cater to ME and my specific needs.  My belief - no matter what side of the counter I'm on - is that if your customers are important to you, you don't make them wait more than 2 minutes to be rung up."

The establishment is clean, and they have a few  yummy looking things for vegans on their menu. The staff is passionate and friendly, and I loved the small business vibe that it had.\n\nI didn't personally have a great overall experience there, but I realize from other's reviews that my experience was definitely not the norm.\n\nWhen my fianc\u00e9 and I ordered our food, I didn't think it would take much more than 20 minutes to get it on the table, but the guy working there did warn me that it might take a couple extra minutes. No big deal. After waiting about 45 minutes, I needed to leave for work but we had already paid for our food- which I found out hadn't even been started yet. There was only one other couple in the restaurant, so I went to find out what was going on. It turns out, the one person working there was filling a 30 sandwich catering order before making our 2 sandwiches. The owner/manager person came out to see what was wrong, and ended up basically yelling at her employee for not offering us a free upgrade to Belgian waffles so that he could use the other iron and get our sandwiches out quickly.\n\nNow, yes, that would have been a smart thing to do, but what about the possibility of putting the only two waffles ordered in the last hour in front of the 30 catered waffles? Or the possibility of not charging for the meal we had to take to go and I still ended up late for work? Or at the very least not chewing out your employee for a unfortunately handled circumstance that could not have possibly been covered during training? \n\nAlso the manager/owner lady was worried that I would give her a bad review on yelp, and kept bringing it up and asking that the employee's mistake wouldn't cost her a good review. I don't go on yelp just to give people bad reviews, but it's not often that I have an experience this bad either.\n\nThe sandwiches and coffee themselves were absolutely fabulous, and since the service was definitely situational, I would not be opposed to going back sometime to give it another shot. Even more than being late for work and not getting any sort of complimentary item as an apology, I just really don't appreciate the lack of professionalism that the management showed the day I went in. I've been in situations where my boss embarrassed me in front of customers before, and it's really the worst thing.\n\nBut like I said, it was just a poorly handled situation, and the food was so dang good that I would not be opposed to giving them a second chance- I'm just not chomping at the bit to walk through those doors again."

Right now they have a tarp sign that says something to the effect of \"Coffee and Waffles\" instead of their name.\n\nAlthough there is a chalkboard menu on the wall grab a menu to get the full details of the items. Order your food at the counter. Ordering was slow when I went, but hopefully will get better with time. Then find your own seat. I would recommend ordering 2 wafflewiches since they do not come with sides (besides chips) or adding items to your sandwich to make it bigger. They are petit. Here's what we ordered:\n\nBreak the Fast Wafflewich- The actual waffle is delicious. I like that it's a little sweet. It's also a harmonious texture combo- sturdy and moist. Inside were scrambled eggs, thin bacon, and cheese. The items inside were sparse and the bacon was the thin kind. The price is right (about $5), but I would gladly pay more for a fuller sandwich. I think next time I will ask for extra eggs and maybe avocado on the side.\n\nB.A.T Wafflewich- Same great waffle housing bacon, arugula, tomato, and a delicious sauce. We also wished this sandwich was fuller. The tomatoes were great. I bet this one would be great with avocado.\n\nRegular Coffee- I drink mine black. This coffee was a-ok and came in a to go cup.\n\nIced Americano- Also a-ok and definitely caffeinated.\n\nI'll definitely be back now that I have a better idea of what to order. Businesses in this area need our support so give Tiabi a try."

The coffee is mainly milk and barely any coffee. We tried a skinny latte, iced coffee, tiffs coffee with a waffle on top. The coffee flavor is not strong at all but mainly milky ... Maybe next time we should just order black coffee. \nThe waffles on the other hand are kinda soggy. They are topped with so much whipped cream and sauces that is what probably took out the good crunch in the waffle. \nThe best thing at this place was their smoothies surprisingly. I would give their smoothies a 5! The Green Nut is absolutely the best smoothie ever! And it is healthy with almond and kale it is so refreshing!! I would highly recommend it to anyone. I would come here again but ONLY to get another smoothie not for anything else. \n\nAlso there is a good groupon for this place my friend and I tried it out we each bought $24 worth at this place. But interestingly enough the Groupons  come in three separate Groupons worth $8 each. I am ok with that because we can come multiple times, but when I came with my friend he had his groupon and I had mine and they had the audacity to question us and tell us that we cannot use it when coming within \"one visit\" well he bought his separate and I bought mine. It is a different transaction who cares it is also separate visit because it is his visit, then my visit. \nAlso,what if I wanted to use my second groupon would it be considered a \"different visit\" if I walked out the door then came back in? They are sticklers about this rule so if you bought a groupon then watch out they are going to grill you about it!"

Sweet, just how I like it!\n- Tiff's Waffle Macchiato: THE BEST DRINK EVERRRR! lol. It comes with a waffle that is dusted with cinnamon sugar, it's messy but worth the mess. So yummers!\n- Pac-Man Waffle: Exactly what it sounds like. Pac-Man shaped waffle with blueberries & raspberries as the thing that Pac-Man eats. Lol. Super cute!\n- Vegan Wafflewich: Tomato, spring mix, avocado & Tiabi sauce toasted. Pretty much like a salad in a waffle, sandwich styled. Sooooo good! I ordered this with the Macchiato every time I went here.\n\nThe employees are AMAZING! They remembered us & they're super friendly.\n\nI totally recommend this place, RECOMMEND, RECOMMEND! You will not be disappointed!"

The kids were served their food & finished eating (20 minutes) before the other food arrived. I was truly floored!  The kids initially wanted to wait for our food to arrive, however, had they waited their food would have been cold. \n\nWe also ordered a side of eggs & bacon to accompany the waffles we ordered. That too was served 20 minutes apart. \n\nThe hostess/owner apologized & said their was a \"mixup\" but I wasn't impressed with the lack of concern that was given with our poor dining experience. \n\n\nI know this is a new venue & only opened a month ago but sometime & effort really needs to be put into the flow of business. We came to eat as a family & that did not happen. I'm extremely disappointed."

Seeing the pictures and menu on Yelp, I already super intrigued by the banana and Nutella waffle. \nWith a big group entering the shop, we were sort of aware that maybe we would have to split up our group to sit down and eat. \nIt was self serve, so we each ordered our meal, standing around at first trying to find a spot to sit. Eventually we found a table big enough for us if we all squished together. \nThe food sort of took a little while to get to our table, but we did get our drinks first. \nI ordered the Serena tea (or something like that I don't remember), but it was super refreshing. Especially against that Las Vegas heat. Some of our friends had also ordered several other drinks, and they loved theirs as well. \nWhen our food finally came, we got the sandwiches first. Most of my friends had ordered the west coast sandwich, and they were super pleased with it. Another one of my friend ordered the Thai chicken and he was really glad with that one as well.\nOverall I'd say that tiabi was pretty satisfying for my group of friends. Although small, it does give off a comfortable vibe. Very easy going and relaxed, the customer service was also pretty great."

They smile when they work and seems like they all love what they do, like it's more than just a job to them. They also take the time to get to know their customers. While we were there, they greeted multiple customers by name and had casual conversations with them.\n\nThere are a lot of options on the menu, for both drinks and food. We got the Viva Las Elvis (amazing), Tiff's Waffle Macchiato (amazing), Hashtag Breakfast Sandwich (good, but sausage seemed like it was a frozen patty), and Snickers Latte (good, not too chocolatey).\n \nOverall, this place is a gem! We'll definitely be coming back :)"

The brew of the day was Guatemalan which I loved because I could drink it black. It wasn't too bitter and I felt it was sweeter then most other beans. I had the hashtag breakfast which was tasty. The waffle had a good balance of softness and crunchy. I also had a side of chips which I believe were barbecue flavor and it was way better than the Lay's ones. 10/10 would want to come here again to try their other items like the normal waffles or the dessert waffle taco."

While I really like waffles, I can also make them at home, so they are usually just okay, in my opinion.\n\nI ordered the waffledilla sandwich without tiabi sauce. It was spectacular. The flavor of the waffle is off the charts. It had just the right about the sweetness, and the texture was a perfect balance of soft and crispy. The chicken was also moist, and I really enjoyed the whole thing. The chips are also pretty good too, which was unexpected as, again, they are just chips. \n\nFinally, for dessert I had the cinnamon sugar covered waffle with ice cream. It was really good. I surprisingly enjoyed my sandwich more, though, because the sandwich was more so something that I would not be able to replicate at home. \n\nTiabi also frequently has living social or Groupon deals, so this place ends up being super, super cheap. \n\nI will definitely be back for more."

Add the incentive of a groupon, and I'm on it...but unfortunately, I have to say that I was slightly disappointed both times I went.\n\nI had gone to eat here when they had opened a few months ago. I didn't particularly have an optimal experience - my boyfriend's hashtag waffles were served a little cold, and though we were the only customers there, I remember we had to wait a good amount of time for our food to arrive. I understand that this place was just starting out and just getting into the groove of things, so I chalked it up to that factor and refrained from writing a negative review. Additionally, the location is kind of sketchy, but they have no control over that really. \n\nFlash forward. I decided to give it another shot a few months later. I ordered a dirty mocha chai and a West Coast waffle sandwich (bacon, chicken strips, avocado, tomato and cheese), which was the same exact order I had the first time around. The sandwich is what I'm giving the extra star for. It's worth a try, pretty good. It was better this time too as far as the amount of toppings go. Very filling. \n\nThe bad news: Service time is still pretty lousy. I even added the pre-tip in hopes of speeding up our food, but it was in vain. The employees are friendly, but I was expecting a smoother and more efficient delivery. They should train the people in charge of preparing the food a lot better. It shouldn't take long to make a waffle and add the trimmings. Especially if the trimmings don't require much maintenance and cooking at all. I'm all about trying small businesses and was really rooting for their success, but it was just disappointing to see that this place hasn't fully quite worked out its kinks yet."

            "review": "Finally after the longest time being in my bookmarks, I got to try this place today!! Located in the shopping center on the corner of Maryland Pkwy & Flamingo with the Target, next to Sakana. Clean and spacious on the inside and I like that they had playing cards on the tables, feels like a place you could spend an hour or two catching up with friends.\n\nI was pretty surprised at how large their drink and food menus were! They have coffee based drinks, frappes, smoothies, teas, and other non-coffee drinks. Cool selections like Red Velvet, Chocolate Coconut, Honey Cream Latte, Java Jolt, Kale Smoothie & Raspberry Lemonade! Tons of different options! My boyfriend and I settled on the Chocolate Coconut Latte and non blended White Chocolate Tuxedo. The Coconut one had some coffee but I'm pretty sure the White Chocolate one didn't. Great flavors but I was expecting them to be more coffee based. The White Chocolate Tuxedo tasted Iike a World Class Chocolate ice cream shake from Baskin Robbins! Both super tasty and an amazing price at $3.75 & $4. Score!\n\nNow the food items! Waffles, waffle sandwiches, salads and desserts! I was also pretty suprised at the amount of vegan items they had! I think I counted about 9 options for food, Awesome! We settled on the West Coast waffle sandwich. Oh and all waffle sandwiches can be substituted with ciabatta bread. It came with chicken, tiabi sauce (vegan aioli), avocado, bacon, cheese and tomato. I was expecting some tiny thing but it was kind of around the size of a 6 in' sub. And for $5.99! Perfect! The waffle was nice and fluffy, had great flavors, and filling!\n\nOur bill for the three items was $17.84 (including tax & 20% tip)! I will definitely be back especially since it's near UNLV. Thank goodness as I was getting tired of all the Chipotle-styled bowl & burrito places. Yummo!"

I like that they have vegetarian and vegan options, but the waffles and sandwiches aren't anything too amazing or memorable to me. It's worth a try if you're really into waffles, but for me the food menu items are just whatever. So far I've had the cinnamon waffle, elvis, and vegetarian wafflewich. I'll keep trying more items and update if anything deserves recognition.\nThe location is a bit shabby so I make sure to bring my stuff with me. I wouldn't think of this place as comfortable- so it's not a place that you would want to study at. Eat, chat a bit with friends, and go. \nAs for customer service, don't expect too much. They get the order done. \n\nGroupon has some deals for this business ($24 for $12 or so), so be sure to check that out."

The staff is always friendly and before they expanded, it was the owners Tiffany and Mae working everyday and they would try to know everyone personally. The drinks and food are great but it's even better knowing you're supporting genuine people. \n\nIf you're into coffee, they have some quality beans and drinks for you. If not there are smoothies and teas. Lots of veggie options for food, which is nice but they pretty much cater to any preference. They are from Guam, and I've found that islanders have a pallet that leans more towards sweet flavors, so expect that when ordering food lol. It's not a bad thing, you can definitely taste that a lot of their inspiration comes from their home. Food is made fresh and to order. \n\nAnyway, check this spot out and tip your baristas."

The place was packed and there's only 3 employees- 1 cashier and 2 food prep staff. \n\nSince it was already 12:00, we decided to take our food to-go. Coffee was okay. Nothing special. The waffle was crisp and crunchy which was good. Breakfast wafflewich was delicious but needs a little maple syrup, which we didn't get to have anymore bec we took the food to-go. Prices are reasonable. \n\nI'll think about whether giving this place another try. Otherwise, they should add more staff."

Despite living in the area, and walking as my primary mode of transportation, I hadn't noticed this place before as it is tucked away on the East side of the Target shopping center.\n\nWhat a delightful find!  This corner of Las Vegas is not known for it's culinary delights, and Tiabi Coffee & Waffle is a gem.  We ordered a nutella, banana, and almond waffle which was delicious, and my constant companion ordered some sort of coffee.\n\nHonestly, I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but my constant companion didn't seem overly awestruck by the coffee.  The waffle was delicious, though, and the waffles at the tables near ours looked equally scrumptious.  I look forward to slowly eating my way through the entire menu in future visits.\n\nI definitely recommend as this as one of the better breakfast places in the immediate area, and the waffles beat any of the waffle/crepe places I've eaten at on the Strip.  Definitely worth moving off the Blvd for a better breakfast meal at a much better price."

            "review": "I really want this place to succeed (who wouldn't want two young entrepreneurs to be successful?)  but some improvements are needed. We were lured here by a Groupon offer. I hope this critique is viewed by the owners and taken into consideration with this in mind. I love the concept of a waffles and coffee shop. Our coffees and waffles were very tasty and we did enjoy the food (maple bacon and red velvet). However, a place that specializes in waffles really needs more than one regular waffle iron and I would also like to see the option of a Belgian waffle added. Heck there are even waffle irons that make waffles shaped like the state of Texas...that would be a fun addition. Invest in more waffle irons! When ordering coffee to drink in the restaurant it is much, much better served in a glass coffee cup/mug. The paper plates and very cheap plastic utensils did not provide the best presentation. At the very least try to budget for a better quality of eating utensils. Again- the coffee (an iced snickers coffee, a latte and a cupcake coffee) were all very good, so maybe glass mugs can be added to make them perfect. The atmosphere is okay but I would encourage the addition of some cozier seating and d\u00e9cor...I would have ordered another coffee and stayed longer. I liked the chalkboard wall. The place was a bit cluttered with trash, overflowing trash cans and our table was sticky with dried syrup from what seemed to be days old. There were no pastries in the pastry case which made me sad. The music was too loud at first but was adjusted and included a nice variety of genres. This place has big potential. I realize it takes a lot of money to open a business and hopefully the owners can make some adjustments and improvements to make Tiabi a place to return to. Good luck girls!"

When the server was getting it ready, she asked me if I wanted butter and I said no, which was okay. \nAt any rate, waffle was good, bacon was crisp and I switched out the sugar free syrup for real stuff.

Ended up getting the Elvis, waffle with peanut butter, bacon, and banana.... of course this was good, how could that be bad?!?! I also had their specialty latte with the cinnamon that comes with a triangle of the cinnamon vegan waffle (got the latte sans vanilla syrup, you know, being healthy and all... lol).... oh ya, super tasty.

            "review": "This place really took a beating on Yelp from some of my friends. Did they have a bad day or what? Maybe they've just improved overall? I love this place so far.\n\nTIABI has been over on Maryland near Flamingo for a quite a while now. Maybe it's just out of sight, out of mind for me (since I haven't been to neighboring restaurants like Sakana that often), but it's certainly not too far from one of my workplaces. I was able to stop by for lunch to try their menu at long last.\n\nThey seem to be having some issues with music skipping (streaming lag perhaps), but it's a pretty quiet place either way with plenty of seating for studying or just enjoying food and drink. Baristas have all been friendly so far, and it was easy to use the Groupons that I'd recently purchased.\n\nThe iced Snickers coffee ($3.35 for 20 oz large size) is appealing, even mildly addictive. Although it doesn't perfectly capture the peanut-y essence of the candy bar, its chocolate and hazelnut combo are a reasonably sweet flavor fusion that provide both fuel and happiness. Plus, it's quite reasonably priced compared to other places.\n\nThe West Coast waffle sandwich ($6.59) is an obvious choice for a savory lunch. I was pleased first and foremost by the lightly crispy and spongy, fluffy waffle that's creased so that you can just pick it up. The chicken and bacon satisfied my carnivorous sensibilities. The delicious, fresh veggies (avocado, tomato) brightened the dish up. Finally, although the sauce wasn't that distinctive alone, it served as a perfect complement. Nothing was limp about any of this.\n\nI went for the Pumpkin Truffle Latte ($4.65 for a large) on my second visit, opting for hot rather than iced. What a treat. It's a perfectly sweet, creamy drink with a moderate spice accent, and I wish it wasn't just a seasonal item. Maybe if I just ask nicely and bat my eyes, it won't be just seasonal? It's the drink that has finally sold me on that whole annual fad.\n\nI also had the seasonal Zombie Waffle ($6.50). This red velvet waffle has bacon cooked on the inside. I had to ask because they're not immediately visible, but using a knife (obtainable at a station near the counter) to cut and even cross-section the waffle, I saw the thin fatty strips. This dough otherwise had the same texture as my wafflewich, which means it rocked. Flavor-wise, it's actually mostly savory, with the chocolate syrup drizzle serving more to accentuate the red velvet batter than to tilt the balance toward sweetness. This also needs to be a year-round treat.\n\nTIABI has impressed me so much on my two visits that I wish I hadn't been so apathetic before. It's a great spot for caffeine and fuel to carry you through the day, and I'll be back even after I use the last of my Groupon 3-pack."

My husband and I got the west coast and hash tag breakfast sandwich and strawberry sunrise smoothie. The west coast was good BUT the hash tag breakfast sandwich was hands down..the best waffle sandwich I ever had. The waffle was so airy, fluffy, and buttery and the sausage and egg was puuuurrrfect. The smoothie was the best I ever had.  The guy at the register was so chill and patient while we couldn't make up our mind! We also had a red velvet lollie and it was was such a treat. I give this place 2 thumbs up!"

I thought I walking through heaven, this is intense.  \n\nThese guys have a great list of waffles ranging from sweet to savory.\nMy favorite sweet waffle is the Vivas Las Elvis\nBananas, peanut butter, chopped bacon and honey on a Belgian waffle. Vegan version-sub bacon and honey for almonds and agave.\n\nI believe the place stands out for the Wafflewiches.  \nThe West Coast wafflewich is chicken, tomato, avocado and bacon in between a toasted waffle.\nThe lightly crunch with the saltiness of the chicken and bacon combination is over the top.\nDefinitely something you must try!\n\nOn top of that they make fabulous coffee too, complements the food.\nThey carry all types of coffee you would expect with few specialties the one I'm eager to try is Tiff's Waffle Machiato; Cinnamon vanilla latte, whipped cream and caramel sauce and served with a churronimo waffle on top. \n\nThe customer service there outstanding!! \nMae is a delightful person and shes cool to have conversation with. I was fortunate to have similar food interests with her as far as finding new things in town to eat. \n\nI'll definitely be going back!!"

Up the street from the Boulevard Mall, in the Target parking lot. \n\nWhen I arrived I was kind of nervous because we were the only people there on a Saturday around 4pm. I took the lack of business as a bad sign, but I was wrong!! Maybe not enough people know about it?? I'm not sure, but if you aren't going to Tiabi, you are totally missing out.\n\nAs I said, this was a recon mission, so I had to order a little of everything, right?? We ordered 3 of the Wafflenuts - the white chocolate macadamia, the red velvet, and a vanilla one that wasn't listed on the menu. For waffles we got the Strawberry Kiss, but instead of strawberries we subbed bananas (on a Belgian waffle) and customized a classic waffle with blueberries and white chocolate. Everything was fantastic!! Everything was cooked to order perfectly. Hot, melty, sweet and so delicious!! I almost always get a to go box, and this is one of the few times ever that it was so good...I couldn't stop. No to go box needed.\n\nThe have lots more on the menu I would like to try...including their coffees. I am excited to go back. I, also, heard there might be ice cream coming in the near future. Fingers crossed!!\n\nYou should definitely check them out. They are worth a drive even if you don't live down that way. They are pretty affordable...$20 for everything I ordered plus a bottle of water. Portions are perfect...not too big or too small. The establishment is clean and relaxed. They have games and decks of cards on the table should the mood strike. Staff is super friendly and helpful.\n\nI will definitely be back!"

The special here is waffles done in all sorts of ways (with toppings, or as a sandwich in some cases).  \n\nI went with a waffle with almonds, bananas and Nutella on it for about $6.  The taste of it was OK, presented and cooked well, but nothing too special about the batter.  The disadvantage was it took what seemed like forever to get it (maybe just because I was hungry?).  I also got a hot chocolate which was just so-so.\n\nFor the price it's a wonderful place, and it's close to Target so I could see coming here for brunch and doing some shopping, I know I'll be back, but the location and low pricing is the main driver."

Just a quick search for \"waffles nearby\" and I came across this lovely gem, and boy, I am glad I did!\nI've come here often enough for the staff to recognize me and have tried a number of things off their menu (and there's still plenty more to try!). I've recommended this place to people and have brought friends and family here, each trip ending up in a generally positive reaction the the food, atmosphere, and service.\nThe waffles and drinks offered here are numerous and delicious. From savory wafflewiches to sweet treats, theres something for just about anyone. The most popular item amongst the people I've brought here is probably the West Coast wafflewich or the Bananatella waffles. But if you can't find anything tempting on the menu or can't decide, you're welcome to create your own. And that can be anything--drinks, waffles, sandwiches, salads--if you can think it, they'll make it for you. Just to prove it, my boyfriend decided one day that adding chicken to their Bananatella would be a great idea (he's an interesting one). And while our server found it an odd request, they fulfilled it anyways. (Surprisingly, it didn't turn out that bad!) For the less daring, my personal favorite is a customization as well: the Strawberry Kisses waffle with bananas, paired with the Snickers iced coffee.\nAs for the place itself, the atmosphere is chill and welcoming. They have a nice rotation of music playing and a deck of cards on every table. The furnishings are quirky; tables with mismatched chairs, antique-style lights, and plenty of photographs and waffle-and-pop culture inspired paintings on the walls. It's a perfect place to eat and chat with friends or to catch up on some studying while sipping on some coffee. The servers are nice and friendly, always up to explain the menu and the new, seasonal items they're promoting at the counter (ex. Egg Nog Latte at Christmas-time or the Pumpkin Spice Waffle during the fall). The downside is that it gets pretty busy in the small space during peak lunch hours, and service can begin to get slow. The place isn't usually meant for a take-out and run, it's definitely better suited for people willing to sit, eat, and chill.\nI definitely recommend this place to the Leslie Knopes of the world. In other words, it's the perfect place for a waffle-lover with time to chat."

Hopefully his gloves aren't latex because he would send anyone with a latex allergy to the hospital with his pulling waffles hot from the iron off with his fingers and then flipping the waffle between both hands then shoving them back on to the iron if he decided it wasn't dark enough. Despite the constant fiddling my waffle still managed to come to me cold.  It couldn't even melt the butter on it.\n\nFlavor wise its not worth anything. My mocha was so over chocolated that the only flavour from the coffee was a bitter under note.

The menu is impressive with a lot of options. You can have breakfast or lunch, I opted for breakfast. I had the Viva Las Elvis waffle (peanut butter, bacon, bananas, and honey) and it was pretty good although I could of done without the bananas and I added maple syrup. Others in the group seemed to enjoy their meals.\nDue to the small size of the place and how popular it seems I did notice that there were several people who came in but left because of the lack of seats.\nI am not sure if I would come back again just because of the location. It is a little farther than I would drive just to have a waffle but if I was in the area I would go back."

Apparently named as an acronym of the underlying motto \"to inspire and be inspired\" with free WiFi and an innovative drink list including a rich caramel and cocoa infused iced coffee for myself plus a heavily praised honey cream iced latte for my friend it was after only a few moments of indecision that our order was placed and chatting while we waited the tasting soon began with a duo of $2.50 \"lollies,\" the single strips of spongy dough pressed between hot metal proving paltry in portion and largely flavorless save for the sweet finishing drizzle that unfortunately warned of things to come.  Entirely eschewing savories in favor of items far more sweet it was after perhaps a twenty minute wait that our proper order arrived and beginning first with a doughy Belgian topped with fresh berries beneath artificial tasting chocolate I quickly turned my attention to the alternatives, the Elvis faring a bit better by balancing sweet and savory over a slightly more study base while the \"Honey I'm Home\" proved the best of bunch in its sugar-crisp coating overlying a somewhat dense crumb - its \"veganism\" thoroughly compromised by honey and ice cream but the result all the better for it."

She attempted to make me get the Halloween waffle, but I did not want that.

She began to harp on charging me for glazed pecans because that  was how the original came. I told her why would she charge me considering they could not provide what was on the menu? She began discussing that the pecans cost $, and had an attitude the entire time. Also, we almost choked on smoke inhalation.

I truly love the concept of their establishment along with the ideals and communities that they promote. In a town that lacks a sufficient number of locally-owned, independent restaurants and coffee shops, TIABI was always a beacon of light; particularly for the neighborhood that they established themselves in (the UNLV campus community and surrounding areas).\n\nThe reason why I have decided to leave a one-star review today, after years of supporting TIABI, is that I have noticed a steady decline in quality -\u00a0and today was the tipping point for me. Prices have gone up, which is understandable for a young and local business, but quantity and quality need to stay consistent to justify the increase in prices. My partner and I spent $26.15 (that was INCLUDING a student discount) on a breakfast sandwich, a West Coast (chicken sandwich) and two 20oz smoothies, and a very small side of fruit. While the breakfast sandwich on a waffle was of \"standard\" size, the West Coast is easily comparable in size to a fast-food dollar menu sandwich.\n\nThe part that pushed me over the edge follows here: While I did understand that this was a high price for a relatively small amount of food, I decided to still purchase regardless because I believe in supporting businesses like TIABI and the food is creative and light on a hot summer afternoon. However, when I order a chicken sandwich, I do expect there to be more than three, one-inch, pre-sliced chicken bites on the sandwich. What I was served was a bacon, avocado, cheese sandwich with a hint of chicken. This is not the end of the world, but then I come to find that the strawberries in my small side of fruit was spoiled and sour. Then my partner proceeds to pull out a piece of plastic from the sausage packaging in her breakfast sandwich. Since the sausage comes in individually wrapped packages, a large chunk of plastic wrapping made its way into her food. The restaurant was not busy at all, so there was definitely no rush to prepare the food, and there is no excuse to find plastic in one's sandwich; that's absolutely careless food preparation.\n\nAs a college student, I would love nothing more than to go down the street, grab a smoothie and a sandwich from a local coffeehouse, and enjoy myself without spending ridiculous amounts of money and finding plastic in my food. I am really saddened to see what has happened to TIABI over the last few years, and I hope they fix it. The owners are such great people, but things need to change before I can return and recommend that my friends and family return as well. \n\n(As a side note, a supervisor/manager should remind the staff that it is not appropriate to mention that you \"can't stop sweating half of your body weight in the Vegas summer heat,\" only to then turn around and prepare a customer's order.)"

Why? \n-The prices are fair\n-the atmosphere is clean, welcoming, and work friendly\n-the employees are extra helpful\n-the food is just okay\n\nWhile the waffle alone is tasty, there's nothing extremely unique about it. And when put in sandwich form, the only unique thing is that it's sandwich stuff....inside a waffle. If you're expecting to be full, you may need to order another menu item as well. \n\nHere's what I've had:\n-Golden waffle- tasty basic comfort food\n-Vegan Tiabi Waffle- no difference in taste/texture so also tasty\n-West Coast Wafflewich- bland and not filling \n-Tokyo wafflewich (i think that's what it was called. pretty much chicken, lettuce, and special dressing)- bland and not filling\n-Avocado Dream Smoothie - not my jam\n-I had a really delicious Coconut/Lime drink not listed on their menu online\n\nLike I did state before though, the atmosphere is top notch. Everyone is warm, friendly, and very helpful when it comes to making food decisions. The other day I was there to pick up the golden waffle and I was kindly offered syrup, utensils, a back, all with a smile :-D The service definitely makes up for the okay food, and I'll probably just stick to ordering things on the sweeter side as opposed to the savory (bland) sandwiches."

Gross waffles, I am assuming someone screwed up the waffle mix recipe that morning because if that's how the waffles taste everyday I'm truly surprised that place hasn't gone out of business yet. \nThe waffles just had a weird texture and an off taste. They just did not taste right. We also ordered a \"hot\" coffee but it was cold, probably had been sitting out all day. If you serve nothing but coffee and waffles you better have fresh brewed hot coffee and decent waffles but they couldn't even get that right. \nWorse than the sub par food was the service, when the server came to check on us and asked how the food was I told him it was not very good and he just said \"okay\" and avoided eye contact and walked away! Wth!!! What kind of service is that?! No apology, he wasn't even interested in asking why I didn't like the food for the sake of feedback. He did not offer to call a manager over, just said \"okay\" and left... That is NOT OKAY!"

Well, fast forward to today and I decided to come in for a coffee and bite to eat. I was instantly met with a lovely charm that was warm and refreshing to my soul. Adrian greeted me with a smile and kind patience as my indecision kicked in. I ordered a white mocha with almond milk (huge win) and the flavors that came from my cup tickled my senses and angered me because I deprived myself for so long from this treat. Anyway.. I look forward to being back soon and seeing where else this Vegas gem can take my senses..\n\nThank You Adrian!"

I've tried multiple items and have been satisfied each time - never have I felt I wasted my money. \n\nHot White Mango Tea - I was having a huge headache and getting this hot tea definitely made me feel better. I'm not usually a flavored hot tea person but this will be my togo when I'm craving a hot and healthier beverage.\n\nIced Caramel Macchiato - The coffee taste here is suuuper heavy - not too much of my thing, will skip this for the future.\n\nTropical Siena and Just Peachy Tea - they are separate teas and I've tried them both. The taste for both were a bit subtle, can live without it in the future.\n\nRed Velvet Frappe - holy crap is it good here or what. Per me since I don't like too much chocolate, I've asked them to lessen the Cocoa and oh my, it is delish. Per bun it's probably the best we've found out here so far.\n\nWaffle Sandwiches:\n\nThe Waffle Dilla - add the avocado. You'll thank me later.\n\nCheers!"

The Living Social is $4 for $8 or $6 for $12. \n\nThe shop is in the same plaza as the Target on Maryland Pkwy. It is to the right of Target if you're looking at it straight on. The shop itself is cute with some couches and drawings on the walls. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I have to say. \n\nThe girl at the counter did not know how to use the Living Social deal we had. After calling 2 other workers over and charging us the wrong price she had to refund the entire order and start over. Also she never scanned the app so if I were not the good person that  I am, I could re-use the deal and get $12 of free food haha. You should probably teach your workers what to do with it!\n\nAfter our food was made they placed the food on the counter and called our names, however we didn't hear them and the food ended up sitting on the counter for a couple of minutes. There were four workers in the store all standing around behind the counter talking. Take the time to bring the order out guys! It was obvious we didn't hear you and it wasn't like you were busy- it was the only new order you had.  I thought it was a little rude that you would call our name out again instead of just walking it over. \n\nWe ordered the bananatella waffle and pac man waffle. The bananatella was good, but nothing I was impressed with/would want to go back for. The presentation of the pac man waffle was horrible. I hope there's a picture of it on here, because I forgot to take one. Who wants a waffle that's a quarter missing? \n\nThe dirty mocha chai sounded amazing on the menu board, but it was all disappointment in my mouth. It was just a strange combination and did not work for me."

With my go to being the West Coast. It's savory and refreshing (thanks to the avocado). Other notable favorites include Kisses and the Red Velvet Waffle for those with a sweet tooth.\n\nThe only thing about this place is that you never know what to expect with service. There are times when it would be swift, friendly, and efficient. You are going to be welcomed with a bright smile from the cashier and get your order in a reasonable time. But there are times when you are greeted with a blank, cold stare as if you've obviously interrupted them with their cleaning and get your order after a longer than usual wait.\n\nDo yourself a favor and if you are return guest, do a call-in order.

The Baristas are very engaging and accommodating to your needs. The owners are very passionate with Coffee and inventive with their food items that they offer. \n\n**A little FYI, I'm good friends with these former green apron workers for years. If your interested about their background ask about their story and how they come to have a coffee shop. Personal favorite is Stiles Java Jolt and West Coast Wafflewich, must try items along with Tiff's Waffle Macchiato and Coconut Truffle Iced Coffee drinks. Ambience is pretty much straightforward with emphasis on artwork and pictures of random travels of the owners with a hipster vibe. \n\nCool place to hangout with friends and expect a lot of millenials and tourist here since it's near LV Blvd."

She gave us recommendations for a health nut like me and I was not disappointed! I always opt for the gluten free options and I tried their Hashtag Waffle with turkey sausage & eggs- it was delicious!!! My friend had the West Coast Waffle that had bacon, chicken, avocado with their TIABI sauce & she was speechless! The waffles had the right amount of crunchiness & sweetness at the same time- & the portions are huge! We had the Kale Champ (kale, bananas, orange, almond milk) & Tif's Waffle Macchiato that came with a cute tiny churro waffle with the drink (like an umbrella in cocktail drinks but you can eat the waffle & dip it in your coffee- yum!). Kale Champ was a champ! No bitterness & just a tad sweetness. The macchiato- Wow! Smooth, aromatic with a hint of cinnamon. The price is very reasonable- where can you have gourmet coffee or shakes with an out of this world waffle entree for just a little over $10 bucks?!  The place is simple with a local vibe touch to the interior- chalk board with cute drawings, a locker that has graffiti signatures from customers, and couches to relax or study. It's right next to Target near UNLV.\n\nWe came here after our Spartan race yesterday because we were craving for some good waffles. We heard about this place from the locals & drove there from the race site as fast as we could without getting a speeding ticket :-) We were still wearing our medals. It was such a perfect place to celebrate another successful Spartan race!"

You're greeted with a smile and upon looking at the menu excitement builds as you can tell that this is no ordinary coffee shop. It becomes obvious that the proprietors Tiffany and Mae put a lot of effort into creating menu choices that are not only healthy, but delectable and unique. The coffee is wonderful and flavorful especially if one's tired of the over roasted bitterness of Starbucks and many others coffee. As far as the food goes I have trouble ordering anything other than either the hashtag breakfast sandwich or the mixed berry salad. My favorite smoothie would definitely have to be the kale champ as it is not too sweet and tastes incredible.  frequent this establishment as I feel others should as well. Oh yeah and if you're having a bad day you should pop in for an ice cream waffle. It makes everything better."

            "review": "I'm all for helping out small, locally-owned shops, but to get me to visit a second time the food has to be good. With Tiabi, I'm on the fence. On one hand the B.A.T. wafflewich ($4.95) with its bacon, arugula, and tomato was delicious. I don't know what the Tiabi sauce in the wafflewich consisted of, but in combination with the other ingredients it made it unbelievably tasty. On the other hand, the Break-The-Fast wafflewich ($4.95) was a complete disaster. The whole thing looked sad. The sausage was barely warm, the cheese looked like it was straight out the fridge having had no contact with any heat to melt it, and the scrambled eggs looked like prepackaged/pre-cooked eggs found at McDonald's.\n\nSomewhere in between in quality were the two waffle dishes I tried. Ordered as a Belgian waffle, the maple bacon waffle ($5.99) was thick and soft, as expected, with large chunks of bacon in the batter. The savory and saltiness of it in combination with the sweetness of the batter and syrup made it a solid choice all around. The red velvet waffle ($5.50), ordered as a classic thin waffle, lacked any crispness around the exterior. The flavor was well balanced with a moderate amount of chocolate chips and whipped cream giving it enough sweetness without making it too overindulgent.\n\nWith classic, Belgian, and vegan waffles, specialty coffee drinks and frozen drinks, there's plenty of promise here. Unfortunately, some of the execution on my visit was lackluster. And, don't expect fast service. Even with three employees hustling in the back we waited a while for our orders despite being the first ones through the door in the morning."

Such a bummer for me since my whole reason for coming was for a fun latte. \n\nIt was a 3 star but the menu still has me curious (half the fun) so I give it 4 stars. There are lots of vegetarian options (even a coconut bacon, bacon alternative which is shredded, roasted coconut with ketchup/liquid smoke and other ingredients that give the coconut a more savory flavor over a sweet coconut flavor. They also offer a V ice cream alternative). \n\n(4/5) I got a small pistachio latte because of my love for pistachio ice cream. It did not disappoint in terms of flavor. What brought me here, though, were the pictures of the fun drinks with waffles on them. Visual appeal simply makes everything taste better. My latte got defaulted into a to-go cup  even though I was never asked for here or to-go. I'd even set up my spot to study and my drink came after 3 others drinks so there was time to simply glance over and see I was staying (not populated at all, regardless of the three previous orders). So if you come and want a foam design, verbalize that it's for here. \n\n(2/5) I also got the kale chocolate chip cookie- the green cookie. I'm all about the healthy way of life but this did not make me want to stay on track. Yes, you could taste the kale. The cookie was fluffy (I'm thinking lots of flour), and had I not had my coffee I wouldn't have finished it. It wasn't sweet like a cookie, but it did remind me of a scone without the shape. I probably would have liked it if I was thinking I was getting into a scone, actually. Subbing out for larger chocolate chips would have also added to the texture in a positive way. \n\nI asked a lot of questions, some were answered with \"I don't know\" with no intention on finding the answer (such as when I inquired about the different types of cookies) and others were answered by the guy making the drinks. I sort of felt like an inconvenience and like I should just go and sit back down because they wouldn't elaborate much without me 'pressing.' But the cashier could be new. I don't know. \n\nI loved the menu. It looks really interesting and I love places that have originality. \n\nThe restaurant didn't have a warm, cozy feel but it was nice, nonetheless. Fun, far chalk wall mural. Actually, chalk was the main art theme. I liked it. \n\nThe music was reggae. I dig. Perhaps a little loud. Startling at times. \n\nDefinitely give this place a try, though."

It's funny because I bet those are the same people that drive like dumb-asses on the road. It's fook sakes man. Your food can't be made ahead of time, or maybe your dumb-asses should call in if you know the wait time is going to be long. Are you guys the ONLY people living in Las Vegas that your food should be made and delivered fast? Does this place look like a fast food joint to you serving burgers? NO!\n\n  They have a big demand and they can only do so much in their small confined space they have. Be grateful theres a spot like this close by. The staff knows you want your food quick because you are either hungry or an impatient child throwing yourselves on the floor over a damn latte not being hot enough, or some other monkey business you all have. Maybe the cafe should have a spot where it read, \"Be aware, we aren't mind readers, but we try to make your food as quickly as possible. So please be sure to wait. To knock on Jack in the boxs phrase\" We don't make it till you order it\". It's like have people turned into a bunch of self-centered egotistical impatient nut jobs now that they forget that if you want great service, your gonna have to wait a little? I mean just like going for a job interview... time your shit out! Don't just go in the last minute! \n\n  Next time you walk in remember that you aren't the only ones waiting, and think about what your ordering and how reasonable time it should be to make it considering everyone else. This type of stupid inpatient behaviour is what replacing our cashiers and food service workers for machines. It's like fuck... this city is stressful and these comments in one way or another hit home to the owners and end up giving bad service because of your choice of words. Now the owner shouldn't take offense because they know that they have delivered and still can deliver great service. Once you stop caring about the customer maybe its time to quit, or revamp your way of doing things. But still the customer should realize when they should stay quiet and be reasonable. I mean... you do have your smart phones to keep you guys busy right? Then shut up, sit down, and wait!\n\n  I really wish I could agree with the rest of the customers here but I just cant when it comes to something that can easily be solved if you take time to consider things. They are responsible for the wait time as much as you all are. If your in a hurry ask how much it will take. I mean these bad comments are in the minority and not much of them give off really over the top bad comments about the place. Just wait time and questionable service.\n\n  Now on to my review... Place is nice inside. I honestly thought it was going to be tiny, but it's an okay size for the location. Parking blows, but what can you do about it. I see some people complain about the parking like if its the cafe's fault. Uhhh what? lol. Price are fine for the grub. Uhh one thing I always look for is a place to sit down for wifi and submit job applications or read with my laptop. But since this is a busy spot I kinda saw that I kind of just taking up room. So maybe I will try showing up later in the day or on a none productive Monday, or Tuesday when there aren't so many customers. I should of ordered something to eat, but had a feeling about not staying too long. I was right so good thing I did not. Waffles looked good. Place is more for a quick to medium social spot. Maybe I would say 2 to 3 hours then outsy. \n\nNow that I'm writing this... I realized they have playing cards so customers can be entertained, but it doesn't work anymore lol. Maybe you all should bring in a mariachi band to keep them entertained bawahahahahahaha!"

I doused my order with srircha. \n\nDespite my table's seemingly simple wafflewich orders, we were left waiting for our food for an unreasonably long time period. There were only two people working in the shop, sharing the responsibilities of taking orders, preparing and carrying out the food, and attending to guests. Needless to say, the service was definitely lacking. One of the owners actually asked my friend and I to wait before ordering, but she completely left us hanging. There was a moderate amount of people in the shop, but it wasn't terribly busy. \n\nBy the end, I don't think anybody in my party was super impressed with their wafflewich nor their wafflnuts, which tasted super doughy and undercooked.

It definitely filled me up but if you're coming in famished, you should probably check out the savory wafflewiches. The woman taking our order was super friendly and was more than welcome to give us suggestions. I can definitely see this place being popular with UNLV students because there's a couch closer to the front of the store, free wi-fi, and random decks of cards at the tables but since it's the summer right now the place wasn't crowded.

I introduced many of my family and friends to this place.\n\nThat being said, the service is below average. Not only is the wait time long (they only had 2 or 3 waffle makers, understandable bc they're a small mom and pop shop which I loved), but the owner/worker takes customer requests and suggestions personally. I asked for strawberries and Nutella on my waffle, as I always ordered it. When I received it, there were no strawberries. I hate to complain about food bc they have the power to spit in it when you're not looking, but I thought they'd be ok with me asking since I'd been there several times previously. When I asked, they took a few minutes and handed over a small bowl of sliced strawberries. I thought they were going to add it to my plate, so I brought it up to the counter. When she saw I did this, she grudgingly said,\"Oh, you wanted ME to put those on there?\" I replied that I could do it, a little embarrassed. \n\nThe reason this was a red flag for me is because one of my earlier stops there, I heard the staff talking about a recent Yelp review. The review spoke of the bad service the customer received. The girl in question defended herself and stated she did nothing wrong. I didn't think anything of this the first time. A subsequent time I was there, a foreign couple (Italian accent?) was asking why their 2 waffles were not similar and if they could remake one because they enjoyed the crispier one. The same owner/worker who didn't take criticism well kept insisting that it was made the same and they just had to let it sit longer to get the crispy consistency. \n\nAt that point, I hadn't been crossed by one of her moods yet, so I continued visiting to get my delicious coffee, waffles and to study. Then, that day hit as it inevitably would. I haven't returned since and don't intend to. Customer service is key, any business owner should know this. \n\nSince I know you (the owners) read the Yelp reviews, I'd like to offer up some constructive criticism: you should cater to your customers. If you take these comments personally and become defensive, your customers will only continue to be dissatisfied with your service."

I think these might be the best waffles I've ever had. And when they are made into a wafflewich?!? Wowwwww, that's just.....wowwwww. So freaking good!!! We ordered the breakfast wafflewich, the Thai basil wafflewich and the bananatella on our first visit here. We came here twice in 3 days. Luckily it wasn't hard to convince my husband to come back since he thought these were delicious too! Yessss! Waffles FTW!!! :)\n\nOn our 2nd visit we got another Thai basil wafflewich (obviously our favorite!!!), the west coast wafflewich, the maple bacon, and the Elvis (with bacon, honey, AND peanut butter! All were delicious, can't say a bad thing about any of these waffles. \n\nThank you Tiabi for the awesome service too, we will def be back!"

Tiabi gives you the option of the classic waffle (thin, round waffle) or a Belgian waffle (thick, square waffle) for the sandwiches. The classic waffle reminded me of the one at Bruxie, but the quality and service were lacking. \n\nI ordered the West Coast sandwich and it was decent, but I felt like it was lacking flavor and thrown together a bit sloppily. I also got the red velvet wafflenut and it was super sweet, doughy, and just seemed like it wasn't fully cooked. There were only two people working, so it took us about ten minutes to order and another 20 minutes to get our food. For the amount of customers that were there, they definitely would benefit from having another employee. \n\nOverall, cute place, vegan friendly, but they just need to work on their consistency and their service."

The wait can be a bit longer than expected, but the food is rather good. I had a smoothie my first time, which was delicious and filling. The second time, I had a Red Velvet frappe, which was amazing and a sandwich. The sandwich was my least favorite item. I don't know if it was the batter used for the waffle of the sandwich or the fact that it took 20 minutes to be served the sandwich, but I was not pleased. I would recommend this place, especially the Groupon if you plan on being in the area for a few days. I do suggest more staff to accommodate the orders.

I had the bacon waffle and my husband had the Western waffle (chicken bacon avocado etc) and their coffee is excellent and he had lemon ginger tea.  Kids would love that place.  The only thing that keeps us from giving it the 5th star is that it is too small and the tables and chairs are not that comfortable and really no d\u00e9cor...so you are there primarily for their menu and they don't let you down there.  \n\nPS...if you order something that requires butter, have them butter it.

They make the Vegan batter here in the premises.  I'm not Vegan, but I am for the period of time it takes to scarf one. They have many of sandwiches and desserts to choose from, all made with waffles, including the Churronimo(a waffle churro), which I wolfed down yesterday.  \n\nThe coffee items that I've experienced so far are the Red Velvet Latte, speaks for itself, and the Espresso Frankenstein.  One would think the Frankenstein to be a very strong and intense drink, one would be correctamundo.  Four shots, ice, and agave, all blended together into a very light and frothy monster of a drink...don't be scared, try it!  Even though it's strong, it's not bitter strong.  You can really taste the roasted smoothness of the beans. \n\nYes TIABI has hit a home run with me.  The staff is lively, informative, accommodating and diligent.

They keep calling \"Maria\" when my name is \"Nadia\"...I looked around and noticed no one was responding to \"Maria\" so I went up to the counter to clarify the name...With an attitude, one of the girls making a drink said \"isn't that what you  ordered?\" (as if the sandwich was exclusive to me alone)... I said \"yes, but before I take the food I want to make sure it's actually my order and not some Maria that could be nearby\". After taking the food I sat down and immediately overheard the same girls  gossiping about me, laughing and saying my name. Whatever. At least wait until the customer leaves to trash talk. The Thai sandwich was just okay. The waffle was too soft and when I bit into it it was unpleasantly soggy. It's been that way on each visit. The idea of a waffle sandwich is good, by if it isn't cooked crispy enough, it ends up tasting like dough. I think I'm going to scratch this place off my list."

I made my way around a group of women clustered near the entrance talking, perused the posted menu, then stood behind a guy chatting at the front counter for a good five minutes before the woman he was speaking to realized I was a paying customer, and said she'd help me. \nI find it a little tacky that the employee (who seemed to be one of the co-owners) was not more attentive to the fact that I was waiting in line to place an order.\nAs it is, she excused herself in such a way that I felt I was inconveniencing her. \n\nRegardless, I ordered a skinny vanilla latte- originally planned on getting a sandwich, but it seemed this would have really been a problem to her, so I just stuck to the drink. It was tasty, even if the foam was overflowing along the lip of the lid.\n\nFound a table of samples toward the back as I waited for my drink- the cinnamon sugar waffle and the bacon-cheddar waffle were both really flavorful, though the former was nice and crisp while the latter was more on the limp and soggy side. \n\nLocation seems like it'll be good for students, and they seem to have a lock on the niche market- doubt bistro waffles are offered anywhere else nearby. Hope they succeed, maybe I'll be back when they work out the kinks- namely waiting for the novelty of business ownership to wear off enough for them to prioritize customer service. Their product seems like it'll do well."

No gimmick, no half naked servers, no gaudy decor or slots. Plain and simple good eats, drinks, wifi and everyday people.\n\nTiabi opens early, around 6:30 am on weekdays. Which is good because I arrived around 7:45, parched and hungry. Strawberry banana smoothie took the edge off for a few hours, then the West Coast waffle sando took care of the rest. \n\nA few hours of normal does a body good. I headed back to my hotel feeling recharged and ready to take on the Strip again."

Well, it's a great idea for a business using waffles on every single plate but unfortunately their waffles are not unique.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Kisses Waffle\n- Golden Waffle\n- Waffledilla \n- South West Sandwich\n- Breakfast Sandwich \n- Americano\n- Chai Latte\n- tuxedo frap\n- waffle caramel ice coffee\n\nWhile the whole menu idea is creative, some of the waffles were burnt and crunchy. The kisses waffle, golden waffle and Waffledilla were so toasted that it would hurt to eat them.\n\nAll others were soft and done the right way. Flavor was ok but nothing to wow anybody. I just feel that they are missing something that makes their waffles in general stand out.\n\nTheir drinks were amazing. I would definitely come back for drinks. Tasty and several options available.\n\nThe Good:\n- Great cafe in a random strip mall\n- Nice Staff\n- Great Drinks\n- Only one of the very few places that have Stevia\n\nThe Bad:\n- Burnt Waffles\n- We got all coffees on to-go cups although we ate there. \n- No High-Chairs available"

I can imagine it being something similar to heaven's scent. The music isn't too loud... it could be better but some of it was decent. \n\nWe were greeted at the counter by a very nice young man. He was knowledgeable and gave us great suggestions. They have a variety of vegan options in both coffee lattes and waffles. We chose the Java Jolt and the dark chocolate lavender latte both with almond milk. They were great and I would highly recommend. Both were priced like any other coffee house in Vegas, nothing outrageous and totally fair. \n\nWe ordered dessert to go... vegan the cinnamon churro waffle with vegan vanilla ice cream. It was so amazing. The ice cream was like nothing I've ever experienced. The waffle was made perfectly. We put it in the microwave to make it extra warm and soft, since we took it to go... and it was just so amazing. I can not wait to go back and get it again.

The smoothie wasn't icy at all and you could actually taste all the ingredients they put into the drink, unlike most places. IMO, $5.25 is a lot for a smoothie, but I would say it was well worth it's price.\n\nI also ordered the west coast ($5.99). I was torn between the steak and egg waffle (a new addition to the menu) vs the west coast. I went with the west coast since the person at the register suggested it and I'm glad I did.\n\nThe west coast was the perfect balance of sweet and salty. The avocado didn't over power the sandwich which I feel most sandwiches do. It was definitely enough to make me full since I also ordered a side of house chips. The house chips tasted like kettle cooked mesquite bbq chips, but they season it themselves kinda like potato corner. Would recommend. We have a place like this in Cali called Bruxie's, but I'd rather come here because their items are more flavorful. \n\nP.S.

Yup, pretty much,\n\nAs we walked in, we were greeted by happy faces and the scent of warm, delicious waffles. I was very impressed by the selection of vegan goodies they offered. But luckily, im not vegan, so it was time to indulge with deliciousness. We ordered the Banana Tella waffle and sat down. They make the waffles fresh for each order so we had to wait a couple of minutes. When the waffles came out I had one regret: we had ordered one to share. And although one is actually pretty big, this is the kind of dish that should never be shared with a lived one. Its seriously good enough to break friendships and end marriages. Luckily for my husband, I had a big lunch before it, so it  wasnt so bad (the sharing, that is).\n\nIf you like waffles, GO. If you like smoothies, GO. If you like coffee, GO.\n\nJust go. Seriously.

It is two square belgian waffles topped with whipped cream, sliced almonds, and Nutella. The waffle is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. \n\nI am taking off two stars because the interior is unappealing. The decoration does not look good, the paint color is unappealing, the furniture is mismatched, the table looks old and dirty (even though it was clean). \n\nOverall, love the food and dislike the atmosphere/interior decoration."

The Wafflewich was good (wasn't the biggest fan of the tomatoes, as I felt it was too much of a soft component, I took them out and replaced them with some chips and added the crunch I was looking for) and the peach tea was great. (next time, I'll get all the sweetener--who am I kidding). \n\nLater, I additionally had an Almond Milk Green Tea Latte and it's possibly my favorite Green Tea Latte I've ever had.  It was refreshingly nutty and not overly sweet.\n\nThe owners who had served me were great and friendly personalities and I can't wait to come back here again with others."

I really liked it but my wife said it tasted like an eggo waffle. \n\nWe both had a west coast sandwich despite it being \"breakfast\". Both really good. Warm waffle as the bread and creamy avocado with bacon and chicken unside-Yum!\n\nWe also both had coffee. I had a honey cream iced latte- awesome! My wife had a regular latte with sugar free caramel-also awesome! There coffee is amazing. No bitterness in our milk drinks for sure. \n\nOverall we loved this place. Great coffee and pretty decent food. Me: 5/5. Wife:4/5. I round down. \n\nWe will be returning for sure!\n\nBtw it is counter service but it was friendly and quick."

The deal was for 3 - $8 vouchers to be used by 1 person with only 1 voucher per visit. Understood. So I go over from the Strip and plan to order and leave then come right back; then I was going to come back again before leaving town. Well I get there and they tell me I can't leave and come right back because it has to be on a different day or at least a few hours later. I tell them that is not ideal because it's a $40 taxi ride roundtrip from the Strip, plus that is not what the fine print says. They tell me it's up to them to determine what qualifies as a visit. I tell them that needed to be included in the fine print since they want to stick to the fine print. They said it's their decision and I can't leave and come back within a certain time period. ((So if I order something and decided it was really good and want another one, I have to wait a few hours before I can come get another one with my Groupon. Foolishness)) At that point I didn't want any of the food because the poor customer service and the bad attitudes of the employees made me lose my appetite. So I can't comment on how it tastes. But as far as the customer service and employees' personalities are concerned, they left much to be desired. If you don't mind crappy service then go for it. But if pleasant service is an important facet of your dining experience, then don't waste your time."

It was kinda cool but the colors get obnoxious if you stare at them for too long.\n\nI was pretty impressed with the waffles here. I ordered a sugary cinnamon one, and my boyfriend had one of their waffle sandwiches. I think the only thing slightly disappointing was the coffee.

But it was quite delicious! My friend ordered the bananutella waffle (which I actually preferred to mine) and my other friend ordered a waffle sandwich + the captain berry crunch smoothie (which was bomb, but only order it if it's all you're going to have because it was dense and filling and super sweet.) \n\nI have already been back to this place to order the Honey Cream Latte, which was amazing and will definitely have to make a point to stop by whenever I'm in the neighborhood! \n\nThe staff is very friendly and the place is inviting."

Then they also have savory waffle sandwiches with bacon, turkey - and even egg and cheese!\n\nWe stuck with the Banana Tella which has banana, nutella drizzle, almonds and whipped cream. You can make any waffle a \"dessert\" by adding a scoop of ice cream. YES PLEASE! The waffle was incredible. I would of liked more of a \"home made\" whip cream - this one was possibly from the can - but it was still great.\n\nWe got the chance to chat up the owner and she was so nice! We asked her about the concept and apparently it started as a coffee shop - then they wanted to add some desserts and decided waffles would be a good fit - then decided to hit the lunch crowd so they added the savory waffles. Genius!\n\nAwesomee concept - great folks working there - and a delicious product! Wish I had tried the coffee! Aw, well - gives me reason to come back to Vegas!"
