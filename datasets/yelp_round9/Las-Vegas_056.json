            "review": "I was truly blown away by this particular yard house inside the red rock Hotel in Las Vegas. The first thing that stood out was that even though they were in a gambling casino they did not give priority to high rollers and even though I am a highroller I love the fact that they were so cool about that and handed me a beeper and said it would be a 20 minute wait.\n\nInstead of waiting we found two seats at the bar and they were able to make me an ice cream drink with vodka Kahl\u00faa and cream de coco and only one in 20 bars will do that for me. And it was perfect.\n\nThe Caesar salad and guacamole and chips were awesome and came promptly to the table. My best friends meal was great and my turkey pot pie could not have been better\n\nEven though the place was packed we were not rushed and were able to hang out for about 90 minutes at the bar chatting with others and just having a good time.\n\nThe vibe at most Yard Houses I have visited is high energy and very loud but this one was a lot more sane.\n\nI would strongly recommend you give it a try when you are in Las Vegas because they don't allow smoking and as you know if you eat in a casino your clothes smell like smoke for weeks."

The food, drinks, and service went beyond my expectations. Matt C. took care of my family. He was extremely attentive and made sure everything was going well. He had to leave and passed us on to Christine, who was just as awesome. I had fish, I cannot remember the name but it was mighty tasty. I also had a few Paulaners as well. The kids menu has a good selection for the little ones. If you're passing through the casino and your tummy is grumbling, I highly recommend stopping in for a bite and drinks."

It's a great space...roomy...great for a happy hour with friends...and fantastic for a late dinner (the kitchen is open until 1am on Friday & Saturday nights).  I started off with the Lobster, crab and artichoke dip...hot, cheesy...great with the accompaning chips for slices of pita bread.  I drank my dessert...that is, I had a half and half...Youngberry Chocolate!  Half raspberry beer...half chocolate stout...it was a fantastic melding of flavors in my mouth!  The beer list is extensive, so I definitely have this on my list for my next trip to Vegas!\n\nFor dinner, I had the grilled cheese (three cheeses on sourdough bread) and organic tomato and basil bisque.  WOW!  That was a fantastic combination of cheeses and soup...the fried basil leaf on top was the perfect accent.  Along my main course, I ordered a side of truffle fries...these were divine!  If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll know that I LOVE anything with truffles...this definitely didn't disappoint!  Perfectly fried shoe string fries...sprinked with fresh herbs, salt, black pepper, parmesan cheese and truffle oil. YUM!!\n\nThis meal definitely didn't disappoint...my only regret is that I don't live closer!"

A server who told us he is slamming the kitchen because he was slammed by tables. 40 min for salad and chix sandwiches. Salad arrived soggy, wet, but amazingly enough the chicken was dry, burnt and tasteless. \nAdd to the joy, the fans and misters were off. When I asked why, I was told they were broken. 5 min after complaining to the manager, fans and misters are turned on. \nHow hard is it to provide consistent food and service. It's literally the backbone of all successful restaurants. Clearly, Yard House isn't successful"

Be prepared to wait.\n\nOur visit was Thanksgiving day, meeting up with family for a late lunch together.\n\nSome things to note, the tuna roll (appetizer) is not a traditional \"tuna roll\" as one would expect.  The fish n chips is delicous!  Beer selections are considerably better than most places I've visited.\n\nWhile service wasn't \"AWESOME\" it wasn't bad.  Our server was a bit of a newbie so we cut her some slack.  Timing on the food was a little off... apps came first, but food followed way too quickly after the apps, not leaving enough time to enjoy the appetizers before the main course."

Everyone is normally happy with big smiles on their face except our waiter tonight Justin.  Sadly to say, our friend had to call over a manager to complain.  She was great and got it turned around to a much better situation. We normally wouldn't complain but with all four of us noticing the attitude in the first 10 minutes we just couldn't let it go.   Of course, the food was still great just took a while to get to us especially my drink which took about 25 mins. and it still didn't come out the way I requested it.  I know the restaurant was crowded so tried to take that into consideration but still the customer service should have been better.  \n\nSorry Yard House you may need to be your own secret shopper.  =)"

Nice environment, great outdoor seating, not impossible to get a table, a fun menu and great beer selection.\n\nOne of my fave parts of this restaurant/bar is the gardein options for all vegans or vegetarians.  Their jerk chicken gardein option is beyond delicious and flavorful.  I must find the recipe to share for Football Sunday with my veggie friends.  The same goes for their Buffalo Wings and Firecracker Wings.  SOOOO good!  I think they're WAY better than actual wings and the flavor is so on point that I will most likely only eat gardein wings moving forward!\n\nI've tried several things on the menu that weren't just vegetarian friendly and haven't been let down since.  I'd name them all, but, who's got the time for all that?\n\nIf you're looking for a relaxed joint with a chilled atmosphere, huge selection of food and decent beer, check out Yard House.  It's become my favorite neighborhood bar.  Great service and the wine is always fresh tasting, as well.  (I hate when I get served a glass of red from a bottle that's been open for a few days..)\n\nGreat place!"

There are TVs outside and fire elements along with heaters. We sat here and had good food and service. We started with one waiter who ended up being sent home  early because the place was not busy. Our replacement servers of a waiter and a trainee were very friendly and helpful as well. We shared the summer salad which was very good. I also enjoyed the jambalaya. With this dish you are given the option of three types of carbs for it to be based on - I chose brown rice. This is a beer lovers place - lots of drafts in big glasses."

I've been to other Yard House locations and wasn't expecting to receive the great service that we did. \nThe husband and I stopped here after a day of hiking at Red Rock Canyon. We were super hungry and Yard House was the first thing we saw so we stopped. The parking lot was pretty full, but we found a spot towards the back. \nWe were seated immediately (it was like 3:30 pm) and our server Nicole cheerfully greeted us and proceeded to take great care of us. Our beers were always delivered cold and promptly. She always made sure our water glasses were full. We both had the tacos (chicken tinga and fish) with rice and beans. Delicious food (I think the fish were my favorite)!!!!! Nicole even gave us plastic cups to take our beer into the casino when we were done. Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely stop here again."

I asked for soup and they told me they was closed BUT shelbie went out of her way to go to the kitchen and graciously got me a bowl of tomato bisque before they were going to throw it out and stop serving. my birthday was October 1st and I came all the way from long beach to stay at red rock casino with my mom to celebrate and it was well worth it. I had multiple drinks at the bar to celebrate my 21st and Josh took AMAZING care of us and made my birthday fun with innovative new shots and attending to me consistently making sure we were good. he was the first person in Vegas to card me so it was fun :) I used to work at yard house at the pike so I know the hours are long and they stay open late so I am sooooo appreciative of Shelbie catering to my drunkenness friday night (Oct 3rd) and getting me the most delicious tomato bisque soup (plus bread and crackers!!!) about 5 mins past 1am. employees like that are an amazing assets to the yard house team and Josh (the trainer and bartender) and shelbie (the waitres) should be recognized for their sincerity and great attitudes. I am impressed with yard house at red rock casino and would definitely return!! thank you! I am so happy I am eating my tomato bisque as I write this haha.. thank you for an amazing birthday and delicious drinks and food. MUCH LOVE ! xoxo :) 5 stars and will return."

I have been too the one in Town Square Mall. Really not much difference between them just the location and fan of both. The menu is HUGE sometimes can be good thing or bad thing. I stopped here for lunch after nice long bike ride up too Red Rock Loop with friends. Something caught me eye on the menu. I never notice before was they have small lunch special section half sandwich and soup. It straight forward but lot of things that enjoy about it. They have four too five sandwiches and soups too choose from mix and match. The portion size the sandwich is decent size combine with a nice cup of soup for under $10 think steal of deal. I got the pastrami sandwich with clam chowder soup. Both were excellent! The pastrami nice hot, moist, fan of the bread, and like the spread in it. The clam chowder was solid have decent amount of clams, potatoes, and even cup of soup felt hearty and filling. If you want can even up size your cup too bowl of soup at cost. It perfect meal after getting great workout in light, hearty, and healthy lunch. \n\nThe service was fantastic. We went as soon as they opened at 11am. Still our waitress was great, friendly, and informative she was the one that told us about upgrade our cup too bowl is want for extra charge. If looking place for light lunch or heavy lunch Yard House has it and that not even going into the beer list."

They have a lot of items to offer and the portion size for happy hour isn't changed.  Take advantage.  They have a lot of beers to choose from also though I'm not impressed with their wine selection.  \n\nThey have a separate gluten free menu so be sure to ask for it if you're on a gluten free diet.  \n\nJust be weary if you're here for happy hour, sometimes they jack the price up or input it in \"error\" and charge you full price.  sneaky sneaky"

I even had a toddler with me, and I've found that in Vegas, kids are not always a good trait in a customer. They were super nice.\n\nHowever, when I received my French dip sandwich, I was not pleased. The meat was so fatty that I couldn't even choke it down. There are few lunchtime quirks worse than fatty roast beef! It really ruined the sandwich for me, and it's been a while since I was there. I was so disappointed! I usually love this place. I was especially disappointed that they served it to me in the first place, as it was obviously lame meat, even without taking a bite. I stopped about 3 bites in. I'm usually the very last person to ever return food, but it really was nasty. \n\nI'm not sure I would chose to eat here again when there are many other restaurants nearby that seem to be more consistent. This location is normally slammed, so I wonder if going in when they were pretty dead was the problem. I might give it another chance sometime if I were to be invited by a friend or something, but never again will I come here for lunch."

            "review": "We frequent the Yard House at Town Square and Red Rock pretty often, but last night was the first time we had the new menu. There were 4 of us and we decided to order several appetizers and share. The chicken nachos are soooo good. Possibly best nachos ever. There are 2 sauces...a green and a red, beans, chicken, guacamole, sour cream and CHEESE! Real shredded cheese, not processed cheese sauce. There goes the diet. \n\nI read a few reviews on yelp and several people raved about the searing ahi so we tried that, as well as the hummus, garlic noodles, shrimp lettuce wraps & mushroom lettuce wraps. The hummus was ok, but on the salty side. The tuna was disappointing to say the least. The last piece I put in my mouth had such a repulsive texture I had to spit it out immediately. I guess its a good thing the texture was so fowl because if I had swallowed it I probably wouldve gotten food poisoning. It seems like the tuna is previously frozen (and possibly artificially dyed bright pink) and wasn't great overall, but that one piece was absolutely disgusting.  I didn't have any of the lettuce wraps, but my friends said the mushroom ones were super salty...bordering on inedible.  The garlic noodles were decent.\n\nWe really like Yard House, but I think it tries to have a menu to please everyone instead of sticking to what they do really well--bar food.  The bf loves the giant selection of beers and the service is always very good. I'm going to steer clear of the Asian menu items and stick with my favorite bbq chicken salad...or when I want to splurge, the chicken nachos."

It seems to me that the first time I just didn't have a good time or didn't order the right foods, but this time I really loved this place. First of all, we showed up for happy hour which was great. And this review might be a lot a review of their happy hour. My husband had a beer (Hefeweizen Dunkel) and I had a Gin and Tonic. They both were very good and the happy hour prices made me happy. \n\nMove on to the food: We ordered three of their appetizers (they were all on their happy hour menu), the Ahi sliders, their traditional bone in wings, and the Hawaii Poke Stake. We really enjoyed all of those things and it really was plenty of food. The wings were actually ordered by my husband, but I ended up eating more than him. He loves his wings soaked in sauce whereas I like mine more dry. These were more on the dry side and super good. The Ahi Sliders came with a medium sized basket of thinly sliced potato fries. They were very good spiced and nice and crunchy. I ate so much of those I was getting almost sick. And the Poke Stake? Oh man, it was delicious. \n\nLesson learned: Always give places a second chance. This time it was really worth it."

First I tried the House Tripel which was good, if not a tad malty for my taste. Then I had the North Coast Pranqster, one of my absolute favorite beers - golden and fruity. It was a decent price ($4) for a pint since it was HH. Drinks and food arrived fast. I went with the Baja Fish Street Tacos and they were incredible! Not very big portions, but combined with the beer enough to fill me up. I will definitely be back for more. Can't wait to try this again with friends. Highly recommended."

And the wait always seems to be longer too. When our server asked if we wanted separate checks, and we said yes, a 20 minute debacle ensued as she had no clue who had ordered what. Not enjoyable. The ambiance here is the same as any other Yard House. The food and beer is the same too. (Duh, it's a chain.) I like that the beers rotate enough to keep things interesting. And while the beer list isn't crazy beer snob-ish, there's enough to tantalize most beer palates. And while the food isn't gourmet or necessarily crave-worthy, it's good enough to satisfy most foodies.  My particular favorites are the queso (it's actually a bit unique) and the mac 'n' cheese (it's chock full with multiple cheeses, bacon, and chicken). The bernaise sliders are also a fav. But they've stopped putting the bernaise sauce on the burgers and just serve it on the side. (Hint: The bernaise sauce makes for a nice fry dipping sauce.) Everything else I've had here has been just fine. There's been nothing I wouldn't eat. But it's also not a place I come to unless someone else suggests it. All in all, it's an a-ok spot."

Although I do have a great story to share. My roommate and I were eating dinner and he asked for a suggestion for a beer to which our waiter suggested a random German beer. My roommate then thought it would be clever to say \"I can't have anything German, too painful for my roommate, he's Jewish. The Germans burned him pretty bad.\" At this point our waitress looked at me with a completely lost glare on her face and said \"that's horrible!\"\n\nThe menu has recently been changed a bit but I'm not sure if it was cosmetic or if items were actually added. If you can find something that isn't absolutely delicious on the menu you've done something wrong. Their spicy jambalaya has crawfish in it which is unheard of and adds an extra level of deliciousness. If you are into eclectic burgers try the surf n' turn which includes asparagus and a lobster claw. I don't think I've had a better burger outside of Burger Bar at Mandalay. Add in their extensive beer selection, great atmosphere, and cheap prices and you basically have the best first date location you could possibly hope for. Or you have the best Sunday hangout, or Friday...or who the hell needs a reason let's just go to Yardhouse! Thank me later, I'll be in the corner having a German beer."

When we bring our young son, it seems they always find time to say hello to him specifically--a nice touch!\n\nThe atmosphere is a little dark, but not in a bad way, and while I wouldn't say the restaurant is loud, the noise level may bother folks with sensitive hearing.  This may be because it always seems to be fairly full.  Lunchtime is quieter, and on weekends you may have to wait to get seated.

It was sushi grade tuna, perfectly seared on the outside and raw on the inside.  The problem is this...If all of the slippery things, like tomatoes, caramelized onions and aioli sauce are all touching each other on the sandwich, its gonna slide and fall apart.  That's exactly what happens with this sandwich.  After the first bite, the whole thing just slides apart.  It was absolutely delicious, but you don't want it to look like it has been in your stomach before you eat it.  And it is really messy for lunch when you have to go back to work meetings. \n\nLater on that night, I brought my wife back for dinner. We had to wait almost 45 minutes for a table.  It was REALLY busy...But we had a couple beers while we waited and watched football.  \n\nFor dinner I had the Porcini crusted halibut, Parmesan mashed potatoes, porcini cream sauce, white truffle oil, asparagus and bok choy.  The fish was SO overcooked that it was stiff.  The rest of the plate was ok, I guess, but when the protein isn't cooked well, the rest of the meal is a let down.  I think it's because the place is so busy.  The food tastes like the cooks are overwhelmed and can't keep up. It's not clear if it was fresh or frozen because it was so overcooked.  It was also a very small portion of fish and a ton of potatoes.\n\nThis place has the potential to be really good, but they need to straighten out some things back in the kitchen..."

The eating area is big and open enough (I actually prefer it to the one in Town Center).  But thats where the good news ends.\n\nThe wait staff was slow and inaccurate.  They actually argued that the raspberry beer they brought was the dunkel we ordered.  The manager ultimately agreed with us.  Secondly, but importantly, they have a 1-drink-at-a-time rule.....\nEveryone knows at a popular restaurant you order when the waiter comes around.  At this particular YardHouse, they will not bring you a beer until the one you have is less than a quarter done.  So now you must wait another 20-30min until the server comes around to check to even make an order.\nThey let us slide a little because they thought we were a good crowd....ridiculous"

This location was so bad it was almost funny. Inside was freezing so we asked to be seated outside bc it was warmer. My friends wives were still cold so my buddy asked if they could turn on the heaters above our table. The manager came out and Said that the heaters were all connected so he wouldn't turn them on bc they might heat up the neighboring 3 tables. Makes sense, no big deal. When my buddy asked him if he could Ask the other tables if they minded the heaters bc his wife was extremely cold, the manger Rudely said \"I'm not going to ask people that.\" Very weird for a manager to speak that way, but maybe he is having a bad day. I have an oil allergy. I told our waiter I have the allergy and asked for my asparagus to be steamed. I also ordered a med Rare steak. Food comes out , my asparagus is drenched in oil my steak is well done. They  also totally forgot my buddies steak all together. Very bad customer experience"

HOWEVER, the staff was rude rude RUDE. I was going to take my son to the movies inside Red Rock Casino, and had placed a to-go order from Yard House so we could grab our food and make it over to the movies at the other side of the casino. We were out running errands when I placed my order over the phone, and by the time we arrived I realized we had plenty of time to sit down and eat. This apparently was WAY too complicated a request for A) the girl at the first counter B) the lady server who was going to grab our order and B) another chick who brought us waters. I walked in and said, \"Hey, I placed a to-go order but we actually have more time now, I was hoping we could be seated.\" All I got was weird confused looks in response like no one could understand what I was saying. So I said again, \"We just have more time than I thought we would, can we have our to-go order at a table?\" The counter girl looked as though I had kissed her boyfriend. I'm not sure what all the confusion and disgust was about, but I couldn't get an actual answer until after other customers had already walked up and picked up their to-go order, so I asked again and then was told, \"YEAH we're getting you a table.\" Um.... okay. Thanks? \nThen they had a fit over whether or not we needed our food plated. No, I said, that's okay, we're still going to head over to the movies and want the to-go boxes. Then there was a bunch of confusion about our drinks. A woman dropped off glasses of water, to which I said (softly, as I was already afraid of getting a pissed off response), \"We had actually ordered sodas with our food.\" And she just shook her head and said, \"I don't know anything about that.\" And walked away. So then the other woman who had seated us passed by, and I asked about the sodas (because our food had already been brought over, but not the drinks, so I was wondering if they'd been forgotten) to which she replied, \"Yes, I know you had drinks. We are bringing them.\" It was a good 5-10 minutes between getting the food and getting the sodas so I don't think it was weird of me to ask about them. \nMy grilled cheese and tomato soup was phenomenal. Just wish I could say the same about the restaurant staff. For the record, this is maybe the first (possibly second) YELP review I've ever written, because I don't usually bother. But this experience was enough to make me never go back. Oh! And while we were there, I jumped onto a group text with my 5 best friends and told them what a shit show it was, 2 of them wrote back to say they had similar experiences at this location. Great establishment, tastey food, good beer and not too shabby prices........... SHITTY staff."

There is no other game in town that comes close to their variety...and so many truly great selections on tap!\n\nThe beer selection literally pleases everyone regardless of what you're looking for!...of course they have too many American Lagers...but they also have as many Belgium Whites and IPA's!\n\nOne of my favorite bar pairings is at the YD.  I am so fond of the Bearnaise Sliders with a Big Sky Moose Drool.  It is not my favorite beer on the menu by far, but together they make sweet X-Rated magic in my mouth!\n\nI really enjoy the Hawaiian Poke, the Mac-N-Cheese, the Enchilada Stack, and the Vegan \"Boneless\" Wings.  They have several other staples as well though.  You have to try to pick out something that isn't downright good!"

Alternated with Bj's across the street! :) \n\nThis place is great . . . almost always comes with a wait though, probably because it's in the Red Rock Casino and there aren't many choices for this type of venue.  They have great patio ~ we love sitting out when the weather is nice, having a beer (hundreds on tap literally) and watching a game on TV.  \n\nThe menu is enormous and the food is good!  I don't think I've ever been disappointed here, ever.  And there's something for everyone.  My favorites are the seared tuna, turkey burger (I have one everywhere I go it seems), grilled cheese n tomato soup and their wings rock too!  Hubby loves the ridiculously large chicken pot pie!  \n\nHappy Hour here is so worth it unlike other places - it's M-F 3-6 (there's also a late night happy hour too) and includes many of their appetizers and drink specials too.  It's a good one -- lots to choose from and not just the typical bar fare.  \n\nService is hit and miss - they are usually very busy so it varies.  I've had great luck at happy hour and on the patio.  We've even been able to order for last call so when it nears 6, she lines up our beers just before the buzzer!  Everyone seems nice, but sometimes you wait awhile for your visit and I am big on service. :)  So worth it -- go ahead and stop in!"

(I've even had an actual yard of beer, which has now been relegated to a display case by the hostess stand.  Should they change their name to Half-Yardhouse? :)) I think I may have emailed Yardhouse in a drunken rage one night in 2004 because they did not have a location here, but they were opening one in Phoenix. But anyway... now we have two!\n\nSome friends wanted to meet up here and I felt a little apprehensive because it is always crazy crowded.  All twelve of us squeezed into one of the long booths, which was a feat and just started ordering.  It worked out surprisingly well thanks to the attentiveness and patience of the staff.  They kept clearing as needed and just made it work with a fun, can-do attitude.\n\nTwo things I did not know about Yardhouse:\n1) Apparently someone took the time to type in all the ingredients to all the dishes into their Micros (aka ordering machine computer  thing).  So if you have people in your group with allergies (we had two), they can get a printed list of all the ingredients lickity-split.  None of that, \"I asked the cooks and they think it may not have peanuts in it.  Maybe.\"\n2) On Monday night, during football season, happy hour is from 3pm until close!  How come no one said anything!?!  Check out http://www.yardhouse.com/NV/las_vegas/ for all the happy hour options and prices.  Maybe this is to compete with LBS that has a $15 mug one-time purchase with 10 cent refills promotion?  Not sure if the Monday happy hour applies to the Town Square location...\n\nPlus, a bonus for me is that they actually had Goose Island Matilda on tap, which is my favorite beer.  Last couple times I came to visit it was tapped out.  \n\nThe only thing that sucks a little is that their firecracker wings have gone the way of the yard.  Back in the day they were actually spicy as the name would imply. But apparently, like the yard of beer, they were too spicy from some folks and finally management relented.  Now they are just wimpy and sweet.\n\nNevertheless, all in all a good night at the Yardhouse! Reminscient of those days of old in Socal."

Unfortunately it is due to poor customer service from management. \n\nI politely asked Jocelyn if I could have the tv above the bar turned to a college hoops game as there was no one on my corner of the bar.  She was happy to ask the two managers working on the tap system to change it for me.  They both told her they were busy with the taps and \"she could do it if she wanted to.\"   I'm not a brewmaster so I have no idea how many white shirts it takes to fix a tap system but I am familiar with proper customer service and that's not it.  \nI politely waited 40 minutes (the entire first half of the game) to inquire again.  Jocelyn apologized saying she had thought management had gotten to it.  She asked once again and 30 minutes later....still nothing.

Very loud.  I'm not a big fan of loud restaurants, and this was no different from the Yard House in Town Square.

Deep fried crab cakes - just the thing to stick between two big hunks of break.  I have to admit I liked the crab cakes a lot - I just don't like to eat fried food.

It had tons of good stuff in it - greens, kale, tomatoes, edamame, carrots, radish, egg (I skipped this), bleu cheese, corn, bacon, avocado.  I loved that it had lots of exciting stuff that is not in a traditional cobb salad.  It was good size and definitely enough for a lunch portion.  My mom had the soup/pizza combo.  She had the tomato bisque and pepperoni pizza.  She liked both options.  I had a bite of pizza and it was tasty.  Pepperoni was a bit spicy.\n\nOur server was very nice and helpful.  She came around often and refilled drinks as needed.  I would say the kitchen seemed busy as the food took longer than it should.  Otherwise all was good."

I've been to the Yard House in Town square, so I know what kinds of food options they have.  I typically visit the Yard House for their happy hour specials, so this lunch was going to be kind of a new experience.  \n\nOne thing I've noticed about this location is that it's much bigger than the Town square location.  It was super busy, yet we got sat super fast which was a plus.  Our server was super attentive and really tried her best to engage with our party.  I really liked her personality, I wish I had remembered her name, though.  Blonde hair, maybe Breanne.  She was super awesome, whoever she was.\n\nFor lunch, I started with the Cupcake Sauvignon Blanc for $8.00.  As stated on the menu, it's from the Marlborough, New Zealand region.  I just started drinking Sauvignon Blanc recently and I thought this glass was a little to dry for my taste.  I probably should have just stuck to the Pinot Grigio I was thinking of getting.  Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio is usually a great glass, but that's what I get for trying something new. \n\nFor my entree, I got the half sandwich and cup of soup lunch special for a little less than $10.  I also added a bowl of shoe string french fries for an extra $1.80.  The half sandwich I chose was the grilled pastrami sandwich on a toasted sub bun.  The pastrami was a little tangy and was accompanied with mayo.  The bottom of the sandwich was lined with jalapenos.  Not spicy at all, I think they may have been grilled.  This sandwich was great!  As for the soup, I decided to get the clam chowder.  The day was a little brisk so I thought it was a good decision.  I didn't necessarily think the soup was the best clam chowder I've ever had.  Seemed process for some reason, maybe it was the ingredients that made it taste that way.  This soup was garnished with chopped chives.  \n\nThe experience was great at the end of the day.  I wouldn't mind returning for another round after another morning of hiking.  The next time I come, I'm for sure getting the Spicy Tuna Roll on the appetizer menu.  I think it was for about $13.  My friend go this and it was sooooo good!  Seared Ahi, avocado, edamame, cucumber with a soy sauce and looked like a little sriracha.  I had the amazing opportunity to try this dish and I fell in love!  If you haven't been to a Yard House, you're missing out.  So many options, so many beers!  Get your butt down and try it out!"

It is simple, boozy enough, balanced, and delicious. Also the lettuce wraps, while not the best ive had, were satisfying with flavorful sauces and the elaborate wonton bowl aspect. \n\nHowever, the service we received at the bar left a really bad taste in my mouth.

When i pointed this out to another bartender, she tracked him down and he made a big fuss about how busy he was, clearly bothered and blaming it on other guests saying how weeded he was. I am sorry but i work in the industry and this is textbook how NOT to handle being slammed.  You dont say that to a guest!\n\nAnyway after he left to \"go get our change\" i overheard him complaining about us to another employee (!!) making exaggerated annoyed gestures in my direction and blatantly rolling his eyes. Then, when he finally came back, he asked me how much money id given him. How can you take someones money, lose track of how much they gave you, and still have the audacity to make them feel like its their fault?\n\nThe icing on the cake here was that when he  finally managed to give us our change  he said \"easy fix bro\", with no apology or eye contact, immediately giving us an annoyed cold shoulder.

            "review": "The only saving grace to this review is the fact that I've dined at this location without AS MANY issues as we had last night.  \n\nWhen I first moved here to Vegas, this was the first Yard House that I had ever been to and now I've been to many in a few different cities. I usually really enjoy Yard House because the food is good, there are so many different foods to choose from on the menu and they have my favorite 'Gin & Ginger' drink (that I modify to be completely different using Fireball..check out my 'Tips' for more on that).  Last night, however, was one huge disappointment after another in what I thought was an otherwise pretty consistently good corporate restaurant.\n\nMy friend decided to have his going away dinner here for all of the above reasons that I just mentioned but also because this boy LOVES beer.  I don't drink beer (gluten intolerance) and hence brings forth my first issue of the night.  I ordered a tequila and soda in a tall glass, with a splash of OJ and a lime, please.  My drink came in a short glass, with an orange slice and I'm not sure what the deal was but it tasted funk-ay. And this is my go-to drink, so I knew what to expect - and that wasn't it. \n\nIt started out that there was only 5 of us and we were sitting in the first-come-first-serve bar area.  My friend made sure to call almost a week in advance and spoke personally to the manager.  He made a reservation for 25 people for 7PM.  When I got there at 7, there was no table for us - hence the bar seating.  The numbers continued to grow with most people being forced to stand behind other people who were seated and crowd around our table like it was a bar in itself.  Not ideal for us as guests and I KNOW not ideal for the servers who were working.  \n\nThe manager came over at one point to apologize, saying there was a 'mix up with the reservations' to which we assured him that we weren't high maintenance and totally willing to cooperate.  THEN he goes into 'actually, your party is really difficult for my servers because people are moving around so we're just going to have to group people together on checks and you guys can figure it out'. My friend, rightfully surprised, reassured the manager that we were easy going and he would cover anything left over at the end if checks got mixed up.\n\nThis was again,, where I started to get more irritated.  If everyone in the party had a SEAT, they wouldn't be moving around. Not to mention, most people didn't even have drinks because it was about a 20-30 minute wait between ordering something with a server and it actually showing up.  Trust me, this isn't an exaggeration. That one drink was my only drink of the night for this very reason. \n\nWhen it came time to order food, I had actually taken the time to research the gluten-free options online beforehand so I would know what to order.  As I'm ordering the 'Chopped Salad', I recite from the website that I can't have the 'Bloody Mary vinegarette' because it isn't gluten-free. The server doesn't believe me/isn't sure what I'm talking about so insists he will get me an actual gluten free menu. Fine. He takes everyone else's order and says he will return with the menu.\n\n*cue Jeopardy music*\n\nI didn't get a GF menu until right before the table's food was about to come out. \n\nI still ordered the chopped salad (without the dressing I knew I couldn't have anyways) and got it shortly after everyone else. And..it was gross. The worst part was the chopped celery - why you would put celery in that salad, I have no idea but it would have been so much better without that bitter crunch in every bite. I then had to stop eating halfway through because I had no water and there was no sign of a server in sight. Womp, womp, womp.\n\nWhen the party was winding down, I was over it.  Myself and 2 other girls decided to ask for our checks, assuming that because we knew exactly what we had and were the only 3 who were ready, it wouldn't be 'too difficult' to split us off.  Nope. 25 minutes later I got my check..the same time everyone else wanted theirs too.\n\nI'm not sure what happened last night but it was a huge disappointment. Yard House is great but I wouldn't recommend it for truly special occasions because I don't get the impression that they can deliver the kind of service those events deserve."

I'll try a few other places before I go back, if I ever come back.  Food was nothing to come back for, and maybe other places will show the game."

Now, I am not much of a beer drinker, but this place carried some of the most diverse drink menus I have ever seen. Not only did they have a large selection of conventional beers, but they also carry rare flavors such as honey tangerine, blueberry brew and chocolate... all of which were tasty and refreshing. Don't know much about beer? Have no fear! Their staff seemed welcoming to all our questions and recommended some great beers based on what our preferences were. \n\nAfter having a few cold ones you can enjoy some of their awesome appetizers. We got the chicken nachos and they were delicious and their portions were huge. I will definitely return to this place next time I am in the mood to hang out with friends and get drinks."

I also want to add that I am a big fan of Yardhouse in Town Square but definitely not this one!  I am writing this review after the third visit and third strike against this place.  Drove all the way across town to meet some friends and showed up at 5pm for Happy Hour.  At this time, we were told that it would be a 15-20 min wait.  One hour later we were very frustrated and still waiting to get a table!  We had a 2 y/o with us which made the wait even worse.  I have never been to a restaurant in town at 5pm and had to wait an hr to get a table and I feel this is unacceptable at this time especially when there are tables sitting empty inside!  They finally call our name and we are seated.  Our waitress comes up and we immediately see that she is a scatterbrain (says a quick hello and apologizes saying she will be right back?)  Ask to see a manager immediately to see if we can do anything about missing happy hr.  Manager comes over and is a decent enough guy who says any drinks and appetizers will be at happy hr pricing but doesn't have a reason why it took an hr to be seated?  Order drinks and it literally took 3 tries with our waitress to get our drink order right.  When she finally did, it took another 20 mins to get a pint of beer???  This continued through our meal and needless to say, we were all upset and unimpressed!  The food all arrived cold and unappealling as well.  This very poor service/waitstaff has been experienced all three times at this location and I will not be coming back.  The friends we were with go there about 3 times a week and also said they will not be returning here.  Loser here in my book that needs to really get their act together!"

Was looking very forward to meeting up with a group of ladies from our social meet up group and have another great experience, but at a location closer to home.\n\nI ordered the Tomato Bisque with Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  The Tomato Bisque was wonderful......but the Grilled Cheese was VERY bland.  No flavor at all.  Extremely disappointing.  I also had a French Vanilla Cappuccino, but it was VERY bland - almost like it was watered down.\n\nBut the BIGGEST disappointment was our waitress, Janine I believe her name tag read.  She was not very attentive or pleasant.  Our whole table was talking about it,  Maybe she was just busy.\n\nHOWEVER, it took us FOREVER to get her attention so I could ask for a refill on my ice water.  After one of my friends was finally able to stop her, and asked if I could get a refill on my water, she said \"Sure.\" And while walking away from the table my friend and I heard her say, \"I'm keeping an eye on your table.\". We were shocked and just looked at each other for a second.  Then I picked up my water glass and said to my friend, \"Well, if she's keeping an eye on our table, then my water glass wouldn't be empty now would it?\"\n\nUnfortunately, because of her over all service or lack there of today, I gave her probably less than a 10% cash tip so that I could get my point across.  I'm usually AT LEAST a 20% tipper.\n\nOver all, not the greatest experience at your restaurant, not sure I'll be back, and I won't be recommending this location to anyone.  The consensus was the same with all the ladies in my group.  That's SEVEN customers that probably won't be eating at your restaurant again."

It is bright red and tastes like a full-bodied fruity beer. The half price apps are a marvelous deal! The crab cakes are delightful, a little bit heavier than I prefer, yet tasty nonetheless. The spicy tuna roll is my standby because it is consistently delicious. It is a deconstructed roll of course and it's enough for 2 to share. Another favorite is the Chinese garlic noodles. It's egg noodles sauteed with garlic, butter and shitaake mushrooms, YUM! The poke stack is also delectable. They also honor the lunch specials until 5pm. I tried the lunch portion of the mac and cheese, as it came highly recommended by a friend of mine. I found it to be too heavy. The flavors weren't bad, it just left me feeling like I had a bowling ball in my belly. I think the mix of the chicken and the mushrooms and the cream sauce are just too much.\n \nThe atmosphere is loud here, as it is a bar. The outside dining on the high tops is much more reticent. The weather in the afternoons lately has made it a perfect spot to nosh and enjoy a beer."

(Under 600 calories) \nThis dish is my mothers favorite because the ahi is seared perfectly and seasoned just right. The vinaigrette is not too over powering and blends very well with the freshness of the fish. \n\nMiso Glazed Sea Bass ($29.65) - Bok Choy, carrots, edamame, jasmine or brown rice\nBest dish in the house by far!! If you're a fan of seafood, this is prepared to perfection! Though the glaze was a bit overwhelming, we will be sure to get the glaze on the side next time.\n\nLobster Garlic Noodles ($22.85) - Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, shiitake mushrooms, spinach, parmesan. \nOnly a few pieces of lobster with some shredded crab and whole shrimp, this dish was very delicious. I had wished the noodles were a little more powerful in the garlic flavor, but that is just my personal option. \n\nMini Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e ($4.85) - Vanilla bean custard, chocolate, caramelizes bananas. \nPresentation caught my eyes first and you know what they say, you eat with your eyes first. After indulging in this dessert, I found happy surprises of chocolate chips at the bottom of the ramekin. Delicious! \n\nAlso! Thank you to our waiter Gary for providing us excellent service, he had made our dining experience all the more enjoyable."

There was a good amount of people, but it wasn't crowded or overly loud considering it was happy hour. We sat at the bar area and ordered Tomato Bisque, sliders, Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Blueberry, and a Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat. I really love their tomato bisque. It is organic (not a big deal), topped with a fried basil leaf, creamy, and oh soo flavorful. Even though it isn't on the happy hour menu, I always get it because I'm addicted! The Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Blueberry was pretty good. I'll admit, I don't drink beer very often at all, but once in a while I like to try something new and I was surprised at how much it really tasted like blueberries. It was almost like having blueberry soda with a mild taste of beer. I highly recommend it if you don't really love the taste of beer very much because the blueberries cover it up a lot. The Tangerine Wheat was a little too bitter for my taste (think tangerine peels), but my friend thought it was refreshing. The sliders are a great deal at just under 7 bucks for three sliders and a good amount of fries. I didn't get it this time, but I usually get the Bearnaise sliders. They also have Ahi sliders, but they're a few bucks more.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience at this location. It wasn't too noisy or crowded and the service was very fast."

I'd steer clear from any \"signature cocktails\" because everything they use \"dekyuper\" in everything which 1) makes everything overly sweet 2) clearly these drinks are overpriced. Most cocktails tasted like Four Loko, so why not drink the Four Loko at a cheap price and really have an 'experience'\n\nFood is mediocre but its easy to bring a group of people here because, just like the beer, they have a little something for everyone. Artichoke and Wings were delicious.\n\nService is always a little slow. My bartender seemed a little confused and scatterbrained. Its Sunday and its not even busy. The other bartender did not even acknowledge my presence. But the barback was very attentive on how he could actually help in any way possible.\n\nOur Halibut and Filet were literally drowned in sauce, so I'd recommend sauce on the side. Wedge salad was good, but we had an up-charge for bacon! Wedge salad standard is wedge, bacon, bleu cheese. Simple. Its like charging me extra for my bacon on a bacon cheeseburger! \nWhen we sat at the table, the girl was incessantly hovering over us. I get it, you are there. We are also a table of four- two couples who are clearly just trying to have a relaxed dinner. Its not busy and I know I'm not taking up your table! Give me some space, please!\n\nAll in all, its not bad. Always consistent so you know what to expect. Mediocre food and great beer. I'll be back, not sure when, but I'll be back.\n\nSide note- We tried to watch a hockey game that was clearly playing at Sports Booking next door, but they couldn't play it here. If you have that many TVs, invest in some NHL/NFL/NBA packages. Yard House has the potential for a great sports bar, and we all know Summerlin needs a good sports bar and if you played every game, every time, I'd be here all day everyday."

I've been to several locations of this joint - Pasadena, Irvine, 2 locations in Vegas - and they are very consistent in what they have to offer.\n\nI was in Vegas over the weekend to catch up with my friends and see if my brother is keeping the house in shape, and the gang of us decided to gather here for lunch.  I honestly cannot remember everything we ordered here, but off the top of my head: lobster crab artichoke dip, seared ahi, california roll, and sweet korean bbq beef for apps, and fish & chips, thai chicken noodle salad, grilled pastrami, and a couple of burgers for entrees.  I tasted all the apps and my fish & chips.\n\nAhi - good, a bit bland\nArtichoke dip - good, a bit bland\nCalifornia rolls - interesting shape like pie pieces, but tasted pretty standard\nKorean bbq beef - meh, my main complaint about the Asian fusion thing\nFish & Chips - great fish, great chips\nPastrami looked really good, as did the burgers.\n\nAs I said great service up-and-down, sufficiently noisy for lunch for vibrance, and the absolute best thing - Boddington's on tap!!!!\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  It's big enough and bar is absolutely huge with lots of TVs, so I think it should be fine.

You don't have a right to receive a tip, it is up to the customer to determine if you earned one and how much.

I don't know if the snack menu is a new concept for the Yard House because I don't remember seeing it before. I liked that idea a lot because we were able to order a couple of different things to taste. \n\nI had the Shrimp Ceviche that were served with four filled spoons. If you are hungry don't order this because it may just piss you off. I wasn't that hungry so it was just right! It had little bits of Mango in it which was a nice twist. \n\nI also ordered their salad that came with Avocado, Mandarin Oranges, Strawberries, and Candied Pecans. It was really good some people don't get the fruit in salad combo but I really enjoy it. It just makes it more satisfying for me. \n\nWe also snacked on some good old chips in salsa.

My Boyfriend and I were there last weekend and unfortunately the selection of staff doesn't seem to have been done with the same amount of care and discretion as it was in other locations throughout the valley. \n\nWe were quoted a 45 minute wait time, and went to the bar for our first beer. They didn't have what I ordered, but the bartender didn't seem to know of any similar options (even though there are 3 or 4 on the menu). We were sat in about 15-20 minutes (one star earned there) and so took a few minutes to finish beer #1 and decide on #2. I decided to venture out of the normal and try one of the Yard House blends. When I asked our server about a specific option, she replied \"Oh, I don't know, I don't drink beer.\" Then proceeded to go on and on about how it has too many calories and makes you fat. So  A) Thanks, you're calling me and my boyfriend (we're both pretty in shape people) fat cows for wanting to enjoy a tasty beverage? B) You work in a restaurant that specializes in a certain product, and you don't know ANYTHING about it? At least fake it till you make it next time, OK?\n\nWhat I ended up ordering wasn't at ALL what I was expecting and basically tasted like strawberry juice (since I obviously didn't get any information on it from our server) and I was pretty disappointed with it. When the manager came by to check on our table, I asked for a sample size of the less sweet part of the blend, to try to make it more bearable. She begrudgingly complied, brought it back 10 minutes later and then never came back to make sure it was satisfactory. Not HORRIBLE behavior, but a good manager would have been a little more attentive. \n\nThe food was about the same as the Town Square location, but since the service was not even close to comparable, I would definitely not make this one a first choice again."

I also happened to stumble in during happy hour, which sweetened the deal even more. The appetizers were half price and more than served as a meal. The tuna roll was fresh, heaping with avocado and very flavorful with an elegant presentation.

Needless to say the service was sooo horrible last night, my family and I will never be back to Yard House in the future.  Which is disappointing since we really enjoy the food & the atmosphere is nice.  Las Vegas is a service industry town, so you expect to get at least decent service... especially with soo many restaurant options.\n\nI would not recommend anyone go to the Red Rock location.  We had a party of 8 so I understand sometimes there are challenges with larger parties but waiting an hour & a half just to get our food is a bit ridiculous.  Our beverages were empty most of the night, our server never checked on us and not once acknowledged the fact that we had waited sooo long to get our food.  We would try to get her attention and she would walk past us.  When our food finally did arrive, we had asked for a few items such as refills on beers & drinks as well as something simple like tarter sauce for the fish & chips... which our server never brought us.  At the end of the night we mentioned how unpleasant the service was to the manager and he didn't seem to care.  I guess they are not too concerned with making their customers happy.  This was by far the worst service I have EVER had.  Very unacceptable."

My lady and I were actually excited to try YardHouse for the first time. The menu looked attractive and plus it's inside of my favorite casino resort Redrock Station. Unfortunately the experience was poor as soon as we walked through the door. We were first greeted by a gentleman that said we had to see somebody else to be seated. I really couldn't understand what he was saying. We ask him where do we go, and instead of him giving us proper directions or better yet walking us to where we needed to go, he just randomly pointed and stated \"down there\". So we decided we would figure it out and proceeded to walk, trying to stop someone for directions. Once we got to the waiting area we were told it's a 20 minute wait. The wait was more like 30 minutes but we were so excited to eat here we didn't mind at all. When we were finally taken to our seats our table was across from the kitchen directly in front of the main entrance. We definitely do not like trying to enjoy a meal with constant servers and customers passing us and hearing the commotion of the kitchen, so we asked to be seated at a booth, the young lady replied with broken english \"it's up to the boss\". My lady and I both looked at each other in disbelief. I was so shocked that I ask the server again and she actually said it again but this time with a long and awkward explanation. She took us back to the waiting area and it looked like the conversation she had with \"the boss\" seemed to irritate \"the boss\". \"The boss\", who's name tag read Allessa, was irritated to the point that she scratched our names from the top of the waiting list, put our names at the bottom and practically threw the pager at my lady with no eye contact or explanation as to what was going on. I ask her do we have to wait again and I received no response. So I switched up the question and ask how much longer is the wait and she answered \"about 5 minutes\". While waiting outside for about 15 minutes we wondered into Lucilles Bar-B-Q, which is literally about 10 steps away. We really weren't in the mood for barbecue plus the menu was a little more pricier than YardHouse, but the staff was so friendly and welcoming we considered it. We went back outside to wait but after about 25 minutes we returned the pager and told the \"the boss\" aka Allessa that we were leaving. What's even worse is that her attitude basically said good ridden. Something like that could definitely ruin your night especially when you have high hopes of a great experience. My lady and I ended up waiting an hour to be seated at Lucille's barbecue but the wait was well worth it! In my line of work I have to give not just excellent but perfect customer service, otherwise I don't generate income. It's highly unfortunate that a reputable establishment such as Yard House would have employees representing the business in that manner. This place definitely doesn't live up to the excellent customer service experience associated with Station Casinos."

A person like me who hates to wait because I lack the luxury of free time m would like to make reservations.\n\nOverall the staff is friendly and their food is good.\n\nThis place is LOUD and it is hard to talk with other people without scremaing.\n\nSo if your dining here make sure your ready to scream you conversations..\n\nWe had the spinach and artichoke dip which was so freaking good and their poke, lettuce wraps and their bbq chicken salad.. 4 people actually shares all this asian style and made us all full.. If your into sharing and tasting all kinds of foods i suggest ordering appetizer's or sharing your entrees..  It's a great way for everyone to taste the food.."

Their \"gardein menu\" items are all cooked on the same flat top and in the same oil as all the meat, as the waitress informed us. The hostess also seated us at a table near the bar, next to a 12 top of extremely drunk and loud women. I asked her to reseat us at a booth and she flat out said no. We asked for the check after the drinks as our friends were disgusted at the thought of consuming meat juices. The waitress practically threw the check at us and stormed off. Luckily when I complained on twitter about the whole incident, a woman from the yardhouse corporate office did her best to rectify the bad experience. We may be back with non-veg friends..."

            "review": "I've been to the Yard House a few time but this was the first time since I found out that the menu offered Gardein selections.  I'll breakdown our experience chronologically for fun.  We were seated and given our HUGE menus.  Seriously, they are huge, the size of a photo book, half of it listing the drinks.  We carefully reviewed the Gardein and other vegetarian and vegan options before I decided on the Firecracker Gardein Buffalo Wings and an order of Truffle Fries minus the Parmesan.  BF ordered the vegetarian mushroom and pepper street taco plater.  I ordered their house Blonde and he ordered the Sam Adams Octoberfest beer.\n\nBeverages were delivered right away, but his was not correct.  A few minutes to get our server's attention for a correction but soon enough, the Octoberfest made its way to the table.  Shortly after that, the Buffalo Wings, Street Tacos & Truffle Fries are delivered and we are both dissappointed (but not surprised) by the small size of portions verses the large prices charged for them.  \n\nTruffle Fries - pretty good.  Served warm, nice seasoning, small hint of truffle oil and without the Parmesan as requested.\nTacos - okay.  A few vegetables grilled on a flat top served on a 4 or 5 inch corn tortilla (seriously the smallest at the grocery store is 6 inches, can't that be the normal?) sloppily sprinkled with queso fresco.  Served with a scoop of rice that appeared to be seasoned but tasted blah and a small dish of undrained pinto beans topped with cheese.  Save the additional $2 or $3 dollars for the rice & beans and order the tacos ala carte.\nBuffalo Wings - fried goodness.  The coating was a nice balance to the chick'n inside and the sauce was flavorful.  Although, I'm not positive that I had the Firecracker sauce, rather than just a sweet tasting one.  It was not spicy at all.  \n\nOur server stepped away on break, but introduced us to her colleague but then we got thirsty.  Beverages were empty, several sightings of replacement server without inquiry about another round.  Stopped eating food so we could order another beverage but it took several more minutes.  Received another round, but wanted to get the check since the food prices were high and the beers were $6.50 each!  Can't afford to stay too long on those prices.  The check had the incorrect beer on it plus the 2 we each consumed.  Flagged down our server, and before I could say anything about the check, beer, extra charge, etc., she made mention of the extra beer and went to correct the check.  So...is that standard practice?  Not to remove a mistake and hope the guest does not review the bill?  Maybe she was psychic?  Sketchy.\n\n$55.08 plus tip and that was all our wallets could stand.  Even if we never return I do not expect the Yard House's bottom line to be hurt, The place was super busy and was not slowing down as it approached dinner time."

It was a bacon maple cream sauce. Omg I want some right now thinking about it. \n\nBeers are great. I'm not much of a beer drinker but I do appreciate their fruity beer selection.

During happy hour when it isn't super busy. We came here after a disastrous attempt at Hachi and ugh, we were let down. It's not their fault they are busy on Saturday night and have a 20 minute wait. I get that. What I don't get is the 5 tables we saw open while people were waiting. That gets annoying from a customer POV. Anyway, we get seated and place our order. I got the grilled cheese with tomato  bisque. I've had the bisque before and it is devine. Absolutely fantastic. The others in my party ordered sandwiches as well. I guess they made mine first and then put under the heat lamp because when it came out it was cold. Seriously. COLD. And the cheese wasn't melted. What good is a heat lamp????, since it's a pretty costly sandwich my brother asked for them to bring me a new one. So, I wait. And I wait. And wait some more. Finally,it comes out. Not grilled AT ALL and cheese still cold!!!!!! WTF? Waiter says he will bring me another one, I ask for original one back lol. It was grilled, as sandwich implies, but cold. He offers something else. At this point  we just want to go. they buy us dessert which was very nice and didnt charge me for the sandwich but I left extremely disappointed. I love this place.  I've always had fantastic service and great food. Tip: don't come Saturday night. I learned my lesson."

From the hostess to the waiter to the bus boy ---- Wow! They made me feel so special.\n\nI entered via the entrance within the casino and was directed to the front of the restaurant for seating arrangements. I hope in the future that they are able to seat customers at both entrances.\n\nThey asked if I preferred indoor or outdoor seating. I was in a movie for the two hours prior, so I chose indoor seating just in case the weather was acting up (again).\n\nOur waiter was fantastic. We ordered what he recommended, which was the jambalaya and the mac and cheese. Their fried calamari was okay; I still think Olive Garden's is a lot better. Don't forget to ask for extra marinara sauce.\n\nThe jambalaya was tasty with two large shrimp atop a bed of linguine (or jasmine rice, if you prefer). It was tasty and I'm not usually fond of spicy food.\n\nThe mac and cheese was good. I think I have had better elsewhere, but it's a personal preference of mine to have super creamy mac and cheese, not dry as if it were baked, which I think it was. It was supposed to have bacon in it, but I did not find any. The chicken and mushrooms were a great additions. \n\nMy boyfriend raved about his jambalaya, but the mac and cheese was only okay. I'll be back to try more of their entrees.\n\nOverall, the customer service is what made this experience so good for me. I don't know if it's due to them just opening, but I hope it stays that way."

I also had the french onion soup it was perfect.. way better than outbacks. My date had a caesar salad and the french dip both were great!! The only reason I was unable to give 5 stars was how slow the service was... our server was very nice, had a great personality it was just slow!"

With an open parking lot, you're only a few steps away from their outdoor patio or main entrance where smiling faces will quickly greet you.  BUT, dinner time can be a small wait.  Yes, it is a popular place and many others know it, so be prepared to grab a drink or two at the bar (if there is space) before your table is ready.\n\nWhere to start once you are seated?  A drink, for sure...and they are known for their many choices of beers. Ask your server for the most popular. Wine and cocktails are great too.\n\nFor an appetizer, try their Hawaiian poke stack, grilled jerk wings, Buffalo wings, pastrami sliders, Ahi sliders...\n\nYour main meal, you have to try (and share) their Mac + cheese which has a chicken breast, apple wood smoked bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and Parmesan cheeses with pasta and white truffle oil. Their Southern fried chicken is also great along with my favorite (and very filling) New York steak salad.  This bad boy has field greens, roasted peppers, avocado, green beans, crispy potatoes and red onion tossed in Gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and fried pickled egg.  Mmm Mmmm...\n\nIf you have enough room and you're not afraid to loosen that belt a notch or two, check out their desserts, I enjoyed their macadamia nut cheesecake. A friend had a Kona coffee ice cream sundae and another went \"lite bite\" and ordered their Mini lemon souffle with fresh raspberries and house made whipped cream.\n\nBottom line, come hungry with many friends to enjoy the evening."

            "review": "For anyone who knows or was part of a large group by the bar today, Sunday July 18th that showed up around midnight- part of your party needs to learn some manners. Yeah, you're at a place that is a dining establishment as well in case you didn't notice it isn't a club where standing room is expected. \n\nThere is a long bar with empty seats so there is no need to have a circle like we're at fucking camp bunched around 3 people already sitting at the bar. I am calling out particularly a guy with a  white longsleeved shirt depicting a archangel religious scene holding up a British flag- thank you for invading my boyfriends dining space and making him feel really intruded upon. I glared and made eye contact with you and the girl even to know that you aren't appreciated and it goes unnoticed. One of your party (thank you greyish? shirt guy) pointed  to our table and pointed out that you and your girlfriend in a purple-ish, blue-ish tank were in our space- you didn't listen to your friend proves you guys were class A people, A- hole class that is. A few of your friends did it too, but then when they actually touched the back of my boyfriends chair appologized and moved out (mohawk guy with a white shirt and tie thanks). If it wasn't for my levelheaded boyfriend I would have gone to the middle of the group and told them off to notice that they aren't the only ones here. \n\nThe waitress was okay. I think as a persons dining host, the comfort of your guests is of importance. I learned from hospitality that seeing the party hover so close our table that it's courteous to ask if we are okay sitting there or to ask the people if they would like a table or a place set up for them at the bar to keep them away from diners. We ended up reseating ourselves when it took a while for her to come back for us, far the fuck away from the bar in a different section. We took our drinks and plates of food to a booth with the help of a different waitress. After we move, guess what happens? They spread out a bit more properly to a table and part of the bar...of course it happens only after they irritate people. \n\nA beer wouldn't make up for it, but it helps my mood. They did not have Goose Island Matilda on tap today which I wanted and I settled for a random pick I haven't seen around Vegas- Petrus Blond which was not balanced with it's malts and underwhelming. Fuck, couldn't even get a decent blind pick beer today.  Our food was good (garlic noodles, turkey sliders, crab cake) , but not good enough to level my mood. 3 is being VERY nice and only because I love YardHouse."

            "review": "This was not my first trip to Yardhouse's happy hour by any means and I'd say that each visit is quite similar (star-wise). It's just that when I get 3 drinks in me, the experience gets ramped up a bit, the food tastes better, and I forget how mediocre everything was. \n\nMy husband and I caught the Happy Hour last night and our server Cristian was really nice and helpful with the menu selection. My husband asked him what a really strong, decent tasting beer was and upon recommendation, he ended up choosing the North Coast PranQster. It was unfortunately a bit sweet for his taste buds and then we saw Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale and wondered why our server didn't recommend that because we knew the reputation of Bastard beers.\n\nSo my husband downed his goblet and ordered the Bastard Ale. We got it and realized exactly why he didn't recommend it. It tasted like absolute crap! On a scale of disgusting brews, $1.25 Earthquake High Gravity Lager from a gas station with 12% alcohol content, comes in at a 10 for the most disgusting beer on the planet. Now, this Bastard Ale, even at happy hour prices, is 4 times the cost and a gnarly 9.5 on the disgusting beer-o'-meter. Moral of the story: listen to your server about beer recommendations; they seriously know their stuff. \n\nOnto the food! We ordered gardin(soy) chicken wings with buffalo sauce, chicken nachos, spicy Thai chicken pizza, and seared ahi sashimi. We opted for the gardin because I wanted to boost my soy intake for the day. They were battered perfectly and tasted pretty much like chicken. As they cooled, the tofu side came out more, but I didn't care because I love tofu anyway. The sauce is a really delicious typical buffalo sauce and the ranch was tasty. The chicken nachos were HUGE. The plate had to be close to 2 ft long and it was covered in nachos with all the goods: pico, sour cream, pinto beans, guacamole, cheese, salsa, and chicken. My only complaint about this dish was the chicken. They were pretty large strips and not many of them, which wasn't a bad thing because they were definitely on the chewy side.\n\nThe seared ahi was alright. I've always loved the sauce on that dish. I can't explain it other than being spicy, refreshing, and a perfect complement to raw fish. However, I found the fish to have some fat or tissue which was hard to cut through and seemed of a lesser standard than what you would find at a sushi joint. Lastly, the spicy Thai chicken pizza. We had to send it back for a different pizza. It was really salty because of the peanut sauce plus all the salty toppings made it salt overload. We replaced it with a pepperoni mushroom which is pretty fail-proof and it was the typical mediocre Yard House pizza with soggy center and all. \n\nYou know those places that you go to once every 3 months because they have a great environment and service so you forget about how mediocre the food is? I think Yard House is one of those places if you plan on being sober. However, it is excellent for beer and vegetarians!"

We sat there in shock, my daughter got upset because she didn't know what was going on, and we decided to leave after seeing that.  We cannot support an establishment that treats their staff that way!  There is no reason Steven should have been told \"Get off my floor, you're fired!\"  In front of us!

Lauren asked her how many was her party for again and did we want to sit inside or outside.  Really did not make us feel that the Yardhouse was interested in our business so we went elsewhere and let the manager know on our way out why we were leaving.  He (did not catch the manager's name) wanted to know how many were in our party and he would get us a table right away.  Apparently you do not have to count past one to work at the Yardhouse and need to give your party size more than three times.  This local is not going back."

My iced tea was refilled 3 times and our server brought two of us a glass with extra ice as our ice started melting.\n\nFor food, I ordered from their lunch pick two menu.  I got the turkey club with a bowl of clam chowder.  The club sandwich was good.  Each quarter had a piece of avocado which added to the flavor.  There were a lot of clams in the chowder.  It was enjoyable also.\n\nThe service.  Tina, our server, was simply top notch at what she does and that's the reason for the 4th star.

I've also been to the Red Rock location several times for post work pints, which are less torturous.\n\nYardhouse is a chain, and the two locations are largely comparable. No miracles here, no surprises, no shocks. The beer list is pretty amazing, and so if I'm going here in a small group, it'll be for some sort of weird belgian quadrupel. \n\nWhere yardhouse shines is the \"middleground\". It's a great place to go with a fussy group, or if you can't decide. There's pretty much an option for everyone- vegetarian, carnivore, no carb, the works. The price point is a little bit high, but if you've been dragged along, there are affordable options, as well as the \"impress the date you don't know at all\" sort of pricing. The food is actually shockingly good for a chain, most of the time, too. I have a had a few \"yep, that was a formula. bluh\" meals; the avacado, pepper, dry chicken and corn flatbread. That was a flavorless mess of huge chunks of slippery veg. I really don't want to feel like I have to cut a pizza-again to eat it.\n\nBut the fries are fantastic; probably one of my favorites of all time. I have no idea why. It is simply so. The soups are always spot on. The tomato bisque and the French onion are perennial favorites, and the lunch soup and salad/sandwich combo is a pretty affordable meal."

I ordered my burger medium well. The burger was slightly over cooked I am pretty sure it was well and not medium well so you may have to go with just medium.

So service was a plus.\n\nBeer selection was awesome and I will admit the only 2 other times I have been to a Yard house was for the libations and not for food.  Opted for the Stouts since it was before noon.\n\nThe place would have gotten 4 stars if the food was presented a little better.  We started with the Moo Shu Egg Rolls, Poke Stack, and Spicy Tuna Roll, then shared a Lunch portion Spicy Jambalaya.\n\nMoo Shu Egg Rolls were great, nice combination of flavors, crispy and paired great with the sauce.\n\nThe Poke Stack was far from good quality poke and our stack was more like a landslide about ready to tumble.  Although hardly a poke expert, I've cut my share of fish in my life to know that poke should be bite size pieces of fish, not mangled rough chopped pieces of flesh (have some respect for your fish).\n\nThe Spicy Tuna Roll is a beautiful bounty of elegance, and tastes good too.  Not your traditional roll but presented in stacked layers which works.\n\nThe lunch portion of the Jambalaya only had 2 shrimp in it, and if that is their idea of blackened, someone better find their spice peddler because they are getting ripped in believing they are delivering a good creole dish when all they are serving up is some shrimp with tomato sauce over some rice.\n\nOverall a good place for some drinks and a good time but I will definitely be trying some other dishes."

He was wonderful and made great recommendations. I think this review moved up to the 5th star level because of his wonderful and attentive service to us. \n\nI liked that we could sample around a little bit before I found \"my\" beer. LOL! I had the Speakeasy Double Daddy IPA. It had a deep hoppy flavor. Seriously they have the biggest selection of draft beer around. I can't believe someone couldn't find a favorite here.\n\nLaurie had the same thing she had last time. The Spicy grilled chicken flat bread sandwich and she asked our waiter Beau to sub the fries for a salad. No problem! I ordered the Mac+Cheese2 and it had pulled chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, campanelle pasta and truffle oil. It was as good as it sounds. The campanelle pasta was on point. I loved that it was not overcooked like you might find in some mac and cheeses.\n\nThis whole time while we are enjoying our meal we were never in need of anything. After the customary check back to see how our meal was and if everything was as we wanted we never had a want for a soda or water glass to be refilled. Beau also recommended another beer and brought us over samples, while consistently keeping our table cleared of any empty plates.\n\nDesert was in my mind as I had read a previous Yelpers compliments of the Salted Carmel Butterscotch pudding. I ordered it and when it was brought to the table it had a great presentation, but an even better taste. The only thing that could of made it better is if they could of put the salt all the way around the top of it. Laurie had 4 spoonfuls before she ever tasted it, and I had 1 and was coughing because it was all on my side of the cup. It was too much for me, but might have been fine had it been spread around. Don't take this wrong, it was great and I probably would order it again!!\n\nOverall I feel that service can make or break a great restaurant. I think that the Yard House is certainly becoming one of my favorite places to dine. The great food and the service we received tonight has me already planning my return!"

I don't usually like going to restaurants where I know there will be a 30+ minute wait to eat during peak hours/days (Friday night dinner, or so..). But I would definitely never say no to some Yardhouse.\n\nThe price is right for the food you receive. The atmosphere is calm and not over the top, and modern. Comfortable. The service is well trained, and inviting across the board.\n\nYou can't really go wrong here because of the great selection and convenient location (at least for me)!"

I visited Las Vegas this past weekend, and this location is just as awesome as I recall. Hands down, the best Yardhouse I've been to.\n\nThe food quality is consistent. There are plenty of vegetarian menu items prepared with Gardein's meat substitute. The Thai chicken salad is delicious, as is the chicken/mushroom macaroni and cheese, firecracker wings, and buffalo chicken pizza. They have wonderful French onion soup, and a ton of delicious appetizers. To name a few, I enjoy the grilled artichoke, spicy tuna roll, coconut shrimp, and moo shu egg rolls. The small plates are affordable sharing options; the flatbreads, deviled eggs, and ceviche are my choices. Obviously, I eat here a lot. AND THE BEER. PLENTY OF DELICIOUS BREWS ON TAP. Listen, there's really nowhere else in Vegas I'm going to find a decent selection of porters and stouts, so it's only natural I come here. \n\nThe service here has always been 5 stars, for the 5 and a half years I lived here and even during my last visit. The wait may look horrific, but I've never waited longer than 30 minutes on a Saturday night, and the staff is super friendly and very good at what they do. It may get noisy in here, but the ambiance is nice and the restaurant is clean. Huge bar, and outdoor dining is also an option."

The nachos weren't hot when served as if they had been sitting around for awhile. Chicken wings were good but a little on the spicy side. The dip was by far the best thing we ordered. Served with large pita chips. Overall, I probably wouldn't go back for the food. Beer maybe."

We were seated right away at a high top table close to the bar and kitchen entrance.  Pretty busy area to say the least.\n\nWe were greeted by a nice young guy to take our drink orders.  We all ordered beer.  My girlfriend and I always order Coors Light and Bryce (our server) gave us a hard time being that we were at the \"Yard House\" ordering a domestic beer. haha  He recommended the light beer which I went with and I must say it was pretty darn good.  My BF on the other hand ordered a raspberry beer (a girly foofoo beer I guess. haha).  With that said, it was the focus on the rest of the night because our dear server Bryce was not going to let him live that down.  (read on)\n\nAs we went over our menus Bryce brought the BF a kids menu (hence the beer reference).  So you know its going down at this point.  It's on son! LOL  That followed by a straw in BF's beer when he wasn't looking...totally crackin-up-classic.  So silly.\n \nVARIETY is where its at on this menu.  Huge assortments of food and drinks....what more could you want to satisfy a craving for a fab Saturday night out.  I had beer, sushi and Italian all in one sitting.  How's that for variety. Amen!\n\nRun Down:\nAppetizer the California Roll: - It is huge, great to share, totally delish. It is literally  one piece of a sushi roll-but times 10 in size topped with snowcrab and avacado...a definite must try.\nMe - Penne with chicken, mushrooms, asparagus, sundried tomatoes in a cream sauce - Never ever a disappointment (definitely not a dish for the diet)\nBF - Orange Peel Chicken - Total Yum.  He gets it all the time and loves it.\n\nTo end the meal Bryce brought over a to-go kids cup in case BF wanted to take his drink with him (not for real because Im not sure you can do that). haha  What a delight Mr. Bryce was.  He definitely has that something special to add to customer service.  I hope his manager takes notice!  We will be back hoping to get his table again.\n\nAnyways, food and ambiance are always amazing.  They have a cool outdoor patio with TVs which is definitely fun watching your favorite teams play.  Anything we have ordered on this menu has been consistently perfect.  I do think that the mac&cheese is one of my favorite dishes and the hummus is yummy too.  The service is always good.  This is a regular stop for us and we will be back soon for sure.  My stomach is growling just thinking about it....hey it is FRIDAY!!! ;)"

My brother tried the Carnitas Street Tacos one time, and the Chicken Enchilada Stack another time - and he said they were both excellent as well.  The service was very nice as well - the staff were all friendly and waited on us right away.  The food arrived promptly, and the server checked back often.  Looks like a great place for Happy Hour as well, with a very large bar - a great place for drinks and they have a large selection of small plates, snacks and appetizers."

My husband and I, only ordered an appetizer, a dinner, and 3 beers and paid $60 with tip.  There are so many other places that serve the same food in a more timely manner, cheaper, and without the loud music blaring that I'm not sure why people go here.

I immediately told the hostess I did not want to sit there, that I might as well sit outside.  \n\nAt my new table Joseph C took my order and then came back to tell me he was going on a 10 minute break.  My meal was very good, but I quickly ran out of water.  Joseph C finally came back and did get me a refill of water.  Then he disappeared again.  I finally had to walk up to the side station and get my own water.  Another waitress came over and helped me.  She asked if I needed my waiter and I said no, I've been ignored my whole meal, why would I need him now?  \n\nSo now Joseph C shows up from behind me and asks if I want some more water.  I said no, just the bill.  I love how he brings me the bill from behind so he doesn't have to face me again.  The restaurant was busy, but was well staffed.  I wouldn't show my face either if I had done such a terrible job ignoring one of my guests.  There was no reason to have such poor service.    \n\nSo overall while the food was great, the front of the house staff really dropped the ball, leaving a bad taste in my mouth.  But with the money I saved on the no tip for Joseph C, I had some great ice cream at Ben & Jerry's."

We have been to other location's with mixed experiences in the past.  This night we decided to sit out side on the patio with the misters and it was just the right temp.  \n\nI selected the Jambalaya and she had the Gardein Chicken Sandwich.  Throughout the entire meal I was comparing the recipe to my mother's home made Jambalaya and at first I was a little disappointed.  Once the heat started kicking up and chunk's of the chicken and sausage and craw fish started blending in my mouth my thoughts changed.  This recipe was fairly respectable as far as Jambalaya's are concerned.  Nothing beats momma's home cooking but a very good dish that I would order again.  \n\nThe Gardein (Faux) Chicken sandwich was pretty decent as well.  These Gardein products really try to mimic a meaty texture with vegan or veggie lover in mind.  I felt the texture was fairly chewy and was juicy like a real breast of chicken.  The Avocado on this sandwich was refreshing and made it perfect flavor combo on a hot summer night.   The YardHouse is a great place to try if you have a veggie lover in your group because they have something for everyone and an excellent beer selection as well."

It's pretty much like going to the Cheesecake Factory (tons of choices.) They have a veggie-based meat substitute that can be put into any one of SIXTEEN of their dishes. I finally settled on the spicy chicken sandwich. It was definitely spicy, but very good. It came with a pile of very thin fries, which I dipped in our guacamole after we ran out of chips. I hate to waste good guacamole.\n\nI just realized that the waiter boxed up my fries for me and I think I forgot them on the table. Sad. :( I guess I'll have to go back for more. :D"

The chocolate stout really has a strong cocoa note and nice depth.  Really yummy stuff.  I have a serious sweet tooth, so I loved the framboise with the vanilla ice cream.

Not since I lived in Strasbourg, France, and frequented The Irish Times bar, where I would often drink this tasty brew, have I seen Kilkenny anywhere. I've been searching for it on US soil for years, and have come up empty handed. Not for lack of trying, mind you. Distributors just don't sell it here. But the Yard House on Charleston, at the Red Rock Casino has it! It's a miracle. I've been to other Yard Houses, with no luck. This is the only one. So if you've been searching for this beer, like me, this is the place for you to go. Plus the food is pretty good, and the Red Rock Casino is one of my favorites in the valley. Go play a game of Bingo. It's one of the best deals around!"

We came on a week night, so it wasn't too crowded.  There didn't seem to be too many tourists, which was nice.  \nThis time around, I tried the Tangerine Wheat, which was really fruity, and refreshing, but I expected it to be a little more tart, and a bit less hoppy.  \nMy second choice was the House Honey Blonde, and I loved it!  It was very light, smooth, and had a lovely honey aftertaste.\nMy boyfriend told me that I would probably like Boddington's, so I tried that as well.  It was very unique, and super tasty.  It's kind of like Guinness, but it's light.  It has a creamy feel to it, very enjoyable.\nThe bartenders were very friendly, attentive, and experts at pouring pints.\nOverall, I think if the price of the Yard House experience isn't a deterrent, then you should definitely stop by.  If it is, stop by during happy hour.  There are drink specials, and the appetizers are half off.  The chicken nachos are a personal favorite."

Luckily for my party of 10, we had reservations. The host told us it was a 2-Hour wait if we didn't! The music they play is pretty cool, but WAAAAYY too loud! You have to yell and read lips just to have a conversation with the person sitting right next to you! I'm all for a good vibe with good music, but please turn it down a notch or 3!!! \n\nThe food here is just okay. Granted, I haven't tried many things on the menu, but the sliders and fries I ordered came out kind of cold. I would compare the food to maybe B.J's across the street. It's just OKAY. But, the food does go well with the alcohol you'll be drinking! The only drink I order from here is their Framboise. You gotta try it! It's kind of a raspberry flavored beer that doesn't really taste like beer but probably a girly version of it. Regardless, the Framboise...get it! SO GOOD! \n\nThe service was actually pretty good. Our waitress was kind enough to ask us if we would like separate checks before taking our order, and was able to do it for us.

Other restaurants didn't have such a variety at the time which made their beer list quite impressive. I tasted ever beer at least once and some a few times. :-)    \nI ordered the crab and artichoke dip as an appetizer and fruity cocktails for my main dish. I was on a date so I appreciated the dim lighting. I think the candles were even scented. Or Maybe I was just buzzed. Either way I enjoyed my evening.\n\nMy second time was yesterday about 2pm. In my opinion this restaurant was to loud and lacked intimacy. I was disappointed. Due to slow service I only had time for 3 cocktails. It's a brewery for goodness sake. I felt like I was in a school cafeteria. I didn't know whether to eat my food or start a food fight. I was terrified. Kids were running around everywhere. I was waiting for the servers to get trampled. \n\nI will never step foot in The Yard House before 8pm."

It usually comes with tomato bisque, which my man always gets, but I prefer the rich, creamy, clam chowder.  We went last Sunday, my sandwich could've been more golden brown, but the bacon was super crispy and the cheese very gooey so that made up for it.  The clam chowder was very hot and generous with the clams.  Service was o.k., I finished a glass of water and put the empty glass where the waitress could see it but she passed it many times before I stopped her and asked for a refill.  We'll definitely be back."

First my dish was a pasta dish but was cold when I got it and only the plate was warm. Our other dish had noodles instead of rice as suggested by the waitress when first ordered. I got a new hot dish and kept the noodles.\n\nLater towards the dinner, Alfredo came out and apologized for the mistake from the kitchen and  comp the 2 dishes. That's great customer service at its finest!! Thank you Alfredo"

If you are a beer lover, this place is for you.  There are over 100 beers from which to choose, all excellent and worthy of serious consideration, according to my husband, a huge beer lover.\n\nThe food is great and consistently well done.  Menu choices include  ethnic-inspired dishes (Korean short ribs, noodle dishes), burgers, seafood, and steak.  On this visit, I had the turkey burger, which is one of the better ones I've had anywhere.  Even without cheese (I'm allergic to dairy), the burger had loads of flavour and was moist.  The accompanying fries were thinly sliced and abundant.  My husband had the full rack of St. Louis ribs and the meat literally fell off the bone.  Each rib had plenty of meat and the bbq sauce was spicy and tasty.  Hubby's sides were a lovely serving of cilantro infused baked beans and creamed corn, the latter of which featured \"a ton of butter and cream\" (sayeth the spouse).  We both finished half of our meals and are looking forward to tomorrow's lunch.\n\nFor dessert, I chose the mini peach-apple cobbler (ice cream on the side and happily consumed by hubby) and it was warm and full of fruit.  The size of the dessert was perfect: just enough to satisfy, not too much to sicken.  :)  \n\nYard House would garner 5 stars from me if the servers displayed consistent service.  Some days, my server is awesome, not too attentive but just enough, courteous and charming, and nailing every dining request I may have.  Other times, I'll see the server two times, the first time to take the order and the second time to bring the cheque.  Today's server was good and would rate an 8.5 (she remembered that my turkey burger was supposed to be cheeseless but forgot to include my garlic aioli sauce on the side).  \n\nAll in all, overall great food and decent service.  I always have a good time when I go and it's one of my go-to places for a fun time."

Oh the excitement. \n\nNot so exciting is the placement of the doors.  If you are entering from the casino, the host person still has you schlep across the entire restaurant to the other host person.  We have technology people..use it.  \n\nSo we get seated and surprisingly it was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon. In fact there were only 2 tables occupied in our section so imagine our surprise when it took more than 15 minutes just to have someone come take our drink order.  \n\nWe ordered appetizers and then our lunch.  We got the Korean BBQ beef & the firecracker wings.  I have to say the Korean BBQ was delicious with the jasmine rice as an accompaniment.  \n\nThe firecracker wings? not so much.  In fact we sent them back. They were not even close to spicy as the description said but rather just covered in a gooey tasteless sauce.  I should have gone with my gut and ordered the jerk wings instead.  \n\nFor our lunch, we had the Mac + cheese 2, which was ok considering the huge chunks of bacon that came with it.  I think it might have been better without the truffle oil since the combo of mushrooms & bacon overwhelm the flavor already but geeze it's only mac & cheese x2.  \n\nI had the tomato bisque and grilled cheese.  The bisque was quite good as was the grilled cheese. Not quite as good as Serendipity 3 but certainly closer and easier to get to without schleping to the strip.  \n\nThe thing that took this down a * to a 2* was the service. I can understand if they are jamming on an NFL Sunday or the World Cup etc but it was pretty much an echo chamber on our side of the room, yet service was so very slow. Except in getting our food on the table because about 5 minutes after our appetizers showed up, there was our meal.  Which in retrospect of the bad wings, was ok, but I would have liked to have finished the shared Korean BBQ first. \n\nThen after we were done, we sat there for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our waitress (and asking the bus person 2x) to bring our check.  \n\nThis is like the 3rd place in a row that we've been that the food was not bad but the service was so non-existent.  I know the excuse 3 years ago was because there were so many people pouring into Vegas that restaurants didn't care whether you got good service or not, you were \"lucky\" to get a table but you'd think with so many places closing their doors, the ones who are actually doing a good job would want to encourage passable customer service.  \n\nah well ..IF we can get in, we'll def. go back.  I want to go when I'm not driving so I can try some of their handcrafted libations."

We started with the chicken tender appetizer and I got a barbecue chicken salad for lunch. I went for the small size which was still way too big. Note to others: do not get the regular size unless you're planning on eating it for 3 meals straight. Seriously.\n\nThe chicken tenders hit the spot--not overbreaded and still had some flavor. My salad I didn't enjoy quite as much, but it certainly wasn't bad. It had a good portion of chicken along with lots of other fix ins that made it truly a barbecue chicken salad instead of a salad with chicken and barbecue sauce.\n\nWe also split a brownie for dessert. It was way too hot but still excellent and a good way to finish a good meal.\n\nAgain, our waitress was fantastic and on top of everything. Food was good, service was good, atmosphere was good.

Their manager Tex was so helpful and accommodated my large party for me. He reassured to me over the phone that they will try their best to make everything work out. Once I got there, I met Tex and found out that the tables were all set and ready to go :) The waiters were very good and checked back with us constantly. They refilled our drinks regularly, checked if our food was good, and made sure my guests and i were doing well. My friend's salad accidentally had an ingredient she requested not to have, but they took care of that, apologized, and ended her experience with a happy note. Again, thank you so much to Tex and the staff for making it memorable for me and making my guests feel happy :)"

I had the blue crab cakes, which I like my crab cakes pan-seared, but these were fried.  The three sauces they served with them were all disgusting.  Would not order these again.  I had the Angel Hair pasta with shrimp and vodka sauce.  It was ok.  The shrimp were perfect and the angel hair was good.  The sauce had WAY TOO MANY shallots and spices in it.  Shallots should be used in small doses.  My Dad had the sliders, which looked good and he enjoyed, but said they weren't really anything special.

Yeah, I have to deduct a point because during busy sports seasons like NBA Finals or Football playoffs, the servers tend to not be as diligent, and the food portions get a little too small. Plus, the take-out service is lacking. I came one time and did not get my food promptly because the hostesses are more concerned with paying attention to the tables.\n\nBut enough of the negative. Good vibe, cool music, not too loud. Come at 3-6 for happy hour. I usually get the Pepper-Crusted Gorgonzola or the Fish and Chips. Appetizers are amazing, but be careful: Calamari is pretty small, but the Chicken Nachos are huge."

Asked to sit on the patio and expected to be seated at one of the empty two-tops with somewhat of a view albeit the parking lot.  Hostess took me somewhere else and I asked if I could sit at one of the empty two tops.  She had to make me stand there while she went back to the desk to see if it was okay.  When she came back she basically told me no, because there was no server assigned to that area....but there were people seated within 6 feet on each side of where I wanted to sit! So, I asked why one of the servers handling those people couldn't handle one lone diner sitting within 6 feet!?! The moment she started to argue with me, I walked out.  Stupid and never should have happened.  Poor customer service and a lack of hospitality training. Will spend my money elsewhere today."

There is a ton of beers on tap & the menu is one of the fanciest & most diverse, that I have ever seen in a bar. I am not saying that this is the best restaurant, even though it is better than most. In  the Red Rock Casino, there are many places to eat, for the price, this is one of the best & better than the Cafe by a wide margin. \n\nThe downside: Yes, it is loud. It is not a good place to bring kids. During peak hours, you may have to wait to get a table. They only have shoe string French Fries. Portion size is on the smaller side.\n\nThe Pluses: Great menu. BEERS! Very friendly, attractive staff. Open later than most of the Red Rock other restaurants. Not packed with kids like BJ's Brewery across the street. Reasonable prices, for the quality of food that they serve. Fast service."

I have heard lots of great things about Yard House, so I was excited to try it out.\n\nWhen we first entered the restaurant, we were struck by the ambiance inside.  It's beautifully decorated and well-maintained.  The hostess was nice, and asked us if we preferred to sit inside or outside on the patio.  We opted for the patio since it was a beautiful night.  We walked around to our spot and about 10 minutes went by before we were greeted by our waitress.  She advised us that she wasn't supposed to be given any more tables so she could go home, so we were her last.  It made us feel awkward and rushed.\n\nWe put in our order quickly, which was pretty disappointing because we didn't get a chance to really review the drink and menu offerings.  I was interested in trying a yummy cocktail, but I didn't get time to review the menu and I was afraid to ask questions lest the waitress need to stay around and waste time.  So, I just ordered a Coke.  My husband was going to try a few new beers, but just went with Newcastle.  At least it was on tap!\n\nWe ordered the California Roll, which is actually just a large \"cake\" of sushi.  It was supposed to be fancy, but in my opinion was lame and the staff should let people know that it's not your typical roll.  Also, we ordered it without the wasabi soy sauce, and, naturally, it was doused with it.  I also ordered the chopped salad, which, unfortunately, was covered in a disgusting dressing that I later found out was \"bloody mary vinaigrette.\"  This was missing from the menu description.  When the waitress noticed I hadn't eaten much of the salad, she asked if I liked it and I told her \"No, the dressing is too harsh and the flavors don't work well together for me.\"  She replied that it was one of her favorite things on the menu and shrugged her shoulders.  Sigh.  I had hoped maybe she would offer to have it remade without the dressing, or something.  But, she was busy waiting for us to get the heck out of there, so, that was a $10 waste of money and food.\n\nDinner was a bit better.  I had a margherita pizza, which, admittedly, is pretty difficult to screw up.  My husband had some orange chicken, which he said was decent enough.  I had eaten 2 pieces of pizza when the waitress came around and asked if I need a box.  Almost like: Can you please go home now?  After she brought the box, she left the check and said: \"No rush.\"  Which literally made me laugh out loud.  \n\nWe paid for the entire meal and left, in quite a disappointed fashion.  I will not be going back.  I would've been happier going to Roberto's!"

The Yard House didn't disappoint. I started salivating at the hundred plus kegs at the entrance. I knew right then and there, I was home. \n\nDig on the sizes of the beers. You can get an eight ounce sampler, a regular pint. or this massive glass. I stuck with the eight ounce and pints and traveled around the world with beer. Japan. Belgium. Australia. The US. Come on, I had to have me some PBR. I'm a Midwestern boy. \n\nService was top notch. Scott was our waiter's name. You know how to tell a good server? They don't talk down to kids. They treat them like customers. And that's what he did. Our kids (who behave in restaurants, yeah, I'm a proud Dad, I gotta give 'em some props) were treated well by Scott. \n\nThe winner at the table was Jambalaya Pasta. I had entree envy over it. It was perfect. My salad was fresh (I had to offset the beer calories somehow!) and while small, it was good. Tzvi got fish and chips. He always does. He digs it. And he said this was one of the best he's had. \n\nThis place is perfect if you're at Red Rock, wiped out from swimming, don't want to leave the resort, have kids and want a nice, cold beer. \n\nAnd it was like, 112 degrees that day. Perfect beer drinking weather! \n\nNext time I'm in LV, I'll probably be back."

Their veg menu is much more than salads and veggie burgers, they have fish 'n chips, chicken wings, fried wings, and even meatballs. \n\nThey also have some very good truffle fries and a California rolls app that is one huge circle of rice, fish, and ginger. And for those who like alcohol they have a huge selection of draft beers and wines. HUGE.\n\nDown sides are that they do not take reservations, lighting is very dim, especially outside, and wait staff can be slow at times. I once had my water filled all over twice after I told them to just bring me a bunch- I am eating buffalo wings for cripes sake!

The manager Anthony was really nice too. we let him know we really enjoyed our dining experience a previous visit. I am happy that they have a very nice kids meal menu as well and offer side dishes like fruit and veggies instead of just frenchfries. I am eating low carb, and the servers are so accomodating and helpful with low carb choices. I can't wait to visit again , my husband says they have the best wings he's ever had."

            "review": "I gotta admit, I'm a pretty big fan.  I like cheap.  I like tasty.  This review is for the Happy Hour part at Yard House...I've never eaten any regular meals there!  Everytime we've gone, it's for Happy Hour.  Yes, Yard House does keep me happy!  Just look at my check-ins for this place.\n\nOK, yes, it's bar food, and yes, it's nothing overly stellar.  But for what they do it is remarkable in terms of food.  And the prices!  You can easily get away for feeding a group of four for under $35.  Take your kids, take your friends, double date!  A good time can be had for little cost.\n\nYard House has Happy Hour M-F from 3 PM - 6 PM, Sun-Wed from 10 PM - Close.  Lots of opportunity to stock up on grub!  Our first time here was on a hunch since we were staying at Red Rock Casino at the time for my birthday.  We've been back at least twice a month since!  Payday = YHHH day (Yard House Happy Hour).\n\nMost days, especially weekdays after 5 PM Yard House is packed!  The good thing about their Happy Hour is that you can sit ANYWHERE in the restaurant and partake in the cheapy goodness.  No need to only sit at the bar or the patio.  Happy Hour indeed!  We bring our kids quite often to eat with us.\n\nFor Happy Hour at Yard House there is a plethora of food and drink selections.  Pints (of a $hi+load of different choices) go fron $3.75 - $5.75 range.  Half yards go from the $7.50 - $10.00 range, house martinis are $6.50, and specialty drinks and wine by the glass are $2.00 off.  But honestly, I come for the food!  For me Yard House does not disappoint!\n\nYard House has a bunch of appetizers and pizzas that are 1/2 price during Happy Hour.  Choices abound, variety too!  Some of our most ordered faves:\n\n-Spicy Thai Chicken or BBQ Chicken Pizza\n-Fried Calamari\n-Hawaiian Poke Stack (most def a fave)\n-Onion Ring Tower\n-Chicken Nachos (another fave)\n-Seared Ahi Sashimi (yet another fave)\n-Spicy Tuna Roll (it's not sushi but we like it anyway)\n-Buffalo Wings\n-Chicken or Mushroom Lettuce Wraps\n\nOn most occasions we will have nearly all these items on our table!  We are piggies!  It's a good thing the tables at Yard House are HUGE.  No matter though, whatever we don't finish we take home for leftovers later!  Although we ALWAYS end up finishing the Hawaiian poke stack and the seared ahi.  Those are very ONO.  \n\nYard House doesn't offer sushi like other Happy Hour joints around Las Vegas but no matter.  Their food usually fits the bill pretty good.  Another plus?  Each dish available during Happy Hour ranges from $5 - $8...and they are full appetizer servings!  Cheap, and lots of it.  A very good choice for decent eats in the Summerlin area!\n\nI have a beer (or three), and a few appetizers and I'm as happy as a clam during Happy Hour.  It is a good time.  Service is very courteous and pretty quick, even during peak Happy Hour time.  Keep up the cheap eats Yard House, I will be back!  H-A-P-P-Y H-O-U-R"

Whether you like a fruity blueberry brew or a manly dark, rich stout... this place has you covered.   The food on the other hand is nothing that tasty.\n\nThis place is TGI McFunster, with a better beer menu.  That's not really a complaint, just a note.  I love the beers!  I really do.  And there is nothing wrong with a big chain restaurant burger or chicken fingers.  Just don't come expecting more than that.\n\nThe menu is too big for any decent kitchen to put out.  Expect mass produced entrees with plenty of frozen and deep fried boredom.  I know what you are going to say.... they have a Vegetarian menu... they have exotic dishes.  Well  I am forever unimpressed with these special menus. Remember the ingredients here are falling off the same US Foods or Sysco truck as the burgers.  There is no brilliant young chef in the back struggling to express himself with his unique cuisine.  These are corporate recipes on menus meant to suck the dollars from your wallet.  In the end, they probably hope you drink enough beer to forget the food.  So don't kid yourself into believing that the ingredients are anything extraordinary.  \n\nOn the good side...  the food is not bad and the beer is noteworthy.  In proper combination this can result in a nice, fun dinner.  If that is your expectation... you are in luck.  I like this place, but I just don't see it as anything particularly unique or special.   Welcome America to yet another TGI McFunster Exotic Brew Garden and Neighberhood-like pub."

            "review": "I've been here twice, so this is a combined rating of both experiences.\n\nThe first time I went was in April at 6pm with my girlfriend. The  I ordered the the Chilled Edamame, Grilled Sweet Korean BBQ Beef and a half portion of the Ahi Crunchy Salad. I also ordered a glass of pinot noir and a large bottle of sparkling water. I can't recall what my friend ordered, so I'm only going to write about my experience. Our waitress seemed friendly enough, however she spoke so fast, that it was difficult to understand her. After we placed our order, we didn't see her for almost 20 minutes. A runner delivered my friend's drink and my sparkling water, however, the pinot noir was no where to be found. Then the edamame came out and my friend's appetizer, still no wine. We asked another waiter (not ours bc we still couldn't find her) if they could check on my wine. Our next courses came out -- Korean BBQ Beef, which was hot and tender with great sweet and tangy flavor and the white jasmine rice was hot and the perfect stickiness.  We started to eat, but I wanted to have my wine with my meal, so I ate slowly. 10 minutes later, I had to ask yet another waiter about the status of my wine, and they went to find our waitress, who finally brought my wine 15 minutes later. The Korean BBQ Beef was still good though, even though it was cold from waiting for the pinot noir. My salad came out shortly after by yet another waiter, then our original waitress came by and said that she was transitioning our table to another waiter since she was going on break, which was laughable bc to us, she had been on break for 45 minutes. Our new waitress asked us if we wanted to order dessert, which I did, a scoop of caramel ice cream. My GF also placed a take away order for her husband to bring home, so I assumed that while we waited for his food, the waiter would bring out my dessert. But instead, they brought out my dessert when they brought out his take away food. So I had to eat my ice cream really fast so the take away food wouldn't get cold. \n\nFood Score: A\nService Score: D+\nAtmosphere: B+ (a little loud, but fun and ively)\n\nThe second time I went to  YH was on Sat night during Memorial Day Weekend. The place was packed so we got put on the wait list, and then went to the bar. Fortunately, 2 seats opened up at the bar, so we decided to eat at the bar instead, which was good for me bc I knew that my drink would come out much faster than the time. Our bartender was friendly and took our beverage order right away while we looked at the menu. We both had Stellas and then we ordered the Onion Rings Tower and Hummus to start. The food came out pretty quickly and the onion rings were nice, crispy and hot, but the hummus was runny and slimy and had a weird after taste, so we didn't finish that dish. I had liked the Korean BBQ Beef dish the first time, so I ordered it again for my main, while my husband ordered the Spicy Jambalaya with Brown Rice. That food came out in a timely manner, however, my dish was very disappointing and my husband's came out with white rice, so they took it back. Instead of replating it, they scooped out the white rice and put brown rice on the same plate, which was now a total mess. My husband was so hungry and didn't want to wait, that he ate it anyway, but we both couldn't believe that it didn't get replated. I was really looking forward to my dish bc it was so good the first time, however, this time, the beef was dry, much smaller pieces, almost shriveled and lacking any of the juicy flavor from last time and the rice was also dry and cold. I was hungry, so I ate it anyway. I was afraid to send it back bc it could've been worse, especially after what happened to my husband's dish when he sent it back. Our bartender asked us if we wanted dessert and I told her we wanted the caramel ice cream and she said that they didn't have it. She told me that I must be mistaken, bc it's not on the menu. I told her that I had it last time in April, and she said that they didn't, but instead, recommended the salted caramel butterscotch pudding. We ordered that instead, and we're glad we did bc it was quite good. Still annoying though that she said that they didn't have caramel ice cream bc I just checked the menu online and there it was - \n\nICE CREAM\nvanilla, caramel, mango sorbet, java chip, mint chocolate chip\n\nFood Score: C-\nService Score: B+\nAtmosphere: B+ (a little loud, but fun and ively)\n\nI really wanted to like this place based on previous reviews. My husband and I are both in the hospitality industry and we like to support local businesses, so we may give it one more try, especially since it's conveniently located. Hopefully the third time's a charm and the service and food will both be good."

But take note that it's a hot dish because it's topped with jalape\u00f1o rings.  It comes with a very generous portion of fresh, seasoned poke, diced avocado chunks, and wonton nachos (so perfect)!  If you're a fan of Poke you'll know that when paired with avocado, it's very refreshing and light... but those wonton nachos do so well at complementing the dish.\n\nI haven't been in the US for a while, so I just came here recently and noticed this gem on their happy hour menu.  Thanks, Yard House, for making your happy hour EVEN BETTER!  Yard House service and taste, at any location, is always on point, in my opinion.  Any meal time is great here, but if you can't already tell, the happy hour is one of my favorites- don't miss out!\n\nPS. Super cool place for beer drinkers!"

The best thing the whole night was the Moscow mule!  Definitely get one of those.  I won't come back for the food but the drink was really, really good!!

But I've been really impressed with this location, both from the service and food standpoint.\n\nAs I said, the burgers are decent, but I've tried some other menu items, like the stacked chicken enchilada, and they been pretty tasty as well! What I really like is that the quality of the food they're using is excellent.\n\nAnother interesting thing to note about the Yard House, at least this location, is that they have an excellent kid's menu. This hadn't been a concern to me in the past, but with a 9 year old stepson now, I find myself sometimes seeking out places that are kid-friendly. Who'd have though that the Yard House would be one of the best options for kids? Not only do they have a huge selection (for a kid's menu, relatively speaking), but they offer decent portion sizes and, of course, good food quality.\n\nPerhaps I'm biased because I go way back with the Yard House. I remember when they opened their first location (and I loved the concept at the time). And I remember when they began to expand. Though I'm not necessarily a big fan of chains, the Yard House deserves its success, and I'm glad to see them maintaining great quality.\n\nIf you're near Red Rock and looking for a good place to eat, the Yard House won't let you down."

Also, this place being not near my house, how many beers can I really sample when I have to drive back in the hood? \n\nStill, this place is kinda cool. I'm always impressed by the amount of beer these guys must to serve on a nightly basis, and I'm impressed by what some of the bartenders seem to know about beers. On more than one occasion I've walked in and said \"Surprise me\" and gotten a delicious beer. (I've also gotten gross ones, where I drink it because I'm too cheap to waste it). \n\nIn terms of the food, it was good. It wasn't amazing, nor was it the kind of food you get at your local dive.

The portions are huge and the food is delicious. \n\nWhen we go for happy hour we get their chicken nachos, four cheese pizza (my two year old would kill for it!) chicken wings and chicken strips (which comes with fries)\n\nNext time we shall get their spinach dip.\n\nThe nachos have red enchiladas sauce, guac, sour cream. Cheese, beans, and a tangy green sauce. Four cheese pizza is pretty big, more than enough for one person. I wish the crust was crispier but it was still good especially for the price. Chicken wings came in three favors and were great. 10 came on a plate. The chicken strips are very crispy but its not a usual crisp. They're light and have more of a Chinese tempora outside. The fries were thin and great. \n\nThe beers are half priced as well but I didn't try it.\n\nThey had other lunch specials and dinner specials but I shall save that for next time when I write my update!"

The place is really cramped and loud, not what i like if im going out to eat. Its cool if u want to go cheer on a game or be loud and drink with friends, tvs EVERYWHERE U TURN, but that wasnt what we were into that night. Took awhile for our waiter to come over, when he did he was very nice, took our drink order. Ordered apps and dinner, it took soooo long to come out.

We got Calle (like the state Cali, not the street in Spanish) who was very accommodating at the last minute, got us everything we needed. Basically, she was awesome and we are going to ask for her again! \n\nLet's talk turkey. Actually, that is about the only thing my paid male escort for the evening did NOT get. It was happy hour. Happy hour means (usually) small plates so you better order a bunch at the Yard House this is NOT true. You get normal sized meals at happy hour prices. There was so much food in our table that I couldn't get all of it in the photo. \n\nLet's just start off easy. I had a Bikini Tini. Loved it. Cheese curds. (I had them before and have fantasized about them since, don't tell anyone but at one point I was looking at photos of them on the Internet as though there were illicit adult content.) Loved those.  Okay, now to know me is to know I love dessert. I am a fat kid who loves cake. Well I had the SALTED CARAMEL BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING. Um. Foodgasm, anyone? If you happen to be lonely and can't afford the paid male escort of the evening like I can, come here, get this dessert, it's almost better. I can say TOP 5 DESSERTS OF MY LIFE!\n\nMy escort he got...everything. No not everything... He got deviled eggs. Not his favorite, he said they were fancy. He's used to my plain old mayo and egg version, theirs had horseradish, cumin and had salsa and bacon on it. He had sliders. Okay they are good, but come on, this is a burger cut in quarters! Nice try YH, but you can't fool me! French Onion Soup. He said it was good but needed more salt. He got wings, he said they were hot and didn't want them to touch his lips. He got fries and had canon seasoning put on...I like my fries plain.  But I wanted to try a couple and 50 fries later, yup, you guessed it they were quite tasty... And he also got a buffalo chicken pizza. We boxed that to bring home. It looked good but we haven't tasted it yet.  He also got two margaritas and a coke. All expertly made/poured. \n\nAnd now we are at home wondering why did he get all that food? If you kept a tally...\n\n3 alcoholic drinks\n1 soda\n1 cheese curd \n1 pizza\n1 cup of soup\n1 order of 10 wings\n1 order of sliders\n1 side of fries\n1 order of deviled eggs\n1 cup of French onion soup\n1 dessert\n\nBill total:  $71.08.  SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! I have paid more at other places that are terrible. Spend your money wisely YH is where you can get a good meal! AND if you like beer 130 are in tap. \n\nRemember salted caramel butterscotch pudding."

I could really give a rat's ass about Las Vegas gambling and tourist culture. The rub of making a climbing trip to Las Vegas is, well, Las Vegas: a dearth of decent beer selections, overpriced food, the dreaded strip. I was explaining all of this to a local climbing out at Red Rocks, explaining apologetically that my girlfriend and I were from Portland, and thus we were insufferable beer snobs. This local fellow, a guy named Adam, told us to go to the Yard House, explaining that it had the largest draft selection on earth. I'm not sure if this is true, but they clearly have well over 100 taps, including a full section of their menu devoted to \"piny, citrusy, hoppy IPA\". Hello! Furthermore, it's right outside of Red Rocks on your drive back to Vegas.\n\nAt any rate, we stopped by after a day of climbing and discovered that happy hour is from 3 - 6 daily, and that their normally rather overpriced pints ($7+) were a more reasonable $5. Stone Ruination double IPA worked for me. More importantly, select appetizers are half off. I ordered Chicken Nachos for $6, expecting, well, and appetizer sized portion. What I recieved was a MASSIVE platter of nachos. Well more than I could eat by myself. My girldfriend ordered spinach cheese dip and chips, which was equally huge. We returned here daily for a few pints and shared an order of the chicken nachos--which was more than an ample meal for the two of us. Dinner for $3 a head? In Vegas (well okay, Sommerlin really)? Awesome.\n\nDirt bags, this is your cheap post climb dinner destination. It get's kind of packed for happy hour, but you really can't beat the beer selection and the prices. And while it is at a casino, it's not really 'in' a casino. There is outside access from the parking lot, so you can avoid the sea of chain smoking slot machine slaves."

The Seared Ahi Sashimi has a great complexity to it, I'll save the description of the flavors to the Bourdain Types but it seriously makes my mouth water just thinking about it.\n\nWith regard to the beers, try the ever rotating list of short-termers that are posted on the screen above the bar, they keep a nice variety flowing through there and some of them have been absolute winners. If you are a fan of IPAs this place has a selection that is incredibly diverse, and you should try the Double Daddy, it is SICK.\n\nThe Happy Hours are great here, half price apps, pizzas, and discounts on every beer in the house if I remember correctly, check it out they do a great job and you always it'll be good. \n\nMost of our visits were previous to Darden Restaurants buying Yardhouse, so hopefully the product will stay the same!"

I asked the waiter what his \"go to\" meal is, 3 tacos fish, carnitas and I'm unsure the third- looked and tasted like jerky, priced at $17.85.  The fish taco was edible.  The beef was undercooked and flavorless.  The third, I already described as jerky like- was heavily sauced and unrecognizable.  A cup of rice and small ramekin of beans.  I will not be ordering food here again.  They are a brew house- eat elsewhere and drink here.  The atmosphere is group friendly and they have 100+ beer on tap.\n\nI think there are better choices for food.\n\nUpdate: will give another star for restaurant's effort to get in touch regarding my experience.  If they care enough to know, I'll care enough to help/discuss.  I can appreciate the effort."

Service has never been exceptionally good but not bad either. \n\nTonight was the worst meal we've ever had and we won't be returning.  \n\nSat down pretty easily in the patio on a beautiful Vegas evening.  One of my sons ordered a kids pepperoni pizza with a side of mashed potatoes.  That was tasty.  \n\nMy other son ordered an adult mac and cheese.  That was decent.  \n\nMy wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and she really enjoyed it.  \n\nI ordered the bacon cheeseburger.  That was okay.  Way too much bbq sauce all over the plate.  I had a side ranch salad that was flavorless and soggy.\n\nThe worst was the penne pasta that my teenage son ordered.  It was awful.  Flavorless.  We told the server and she said she would bring more sauce because the kitchen probably didn't put enough sauce on it.  \n\nPersonally I would've just taken it off the menu and replaced that entree.  \n\nProbably the worst thing that happened was when a different server brought a clam chowder to our table.  When he dropped the soup off, he also placed an order of fries on our table that was supposed to go to another table.  My 6-yr old didn't realize that and grabbed a fry.  The server saw that, grabbed the little bowl of fries, and took it to the table that it was supposed to go.  That's just weird.\n\nI left a 15% tip and wrote a note to the server that she should've removed the dish that we barely ate.  Poor service = lower tip for the server and no return visit to the restaurant.  \n\nToo many options in Summerlin to waste money here."

Hostesses wiping down menus instead of actually hosting. I go here at least once a month when I go to a movie, and I've never seen such crappy service.

No one was really at the front when we entered, but we found our relatives pretty quick because they were all seated at a booth near the front. The service was kinda weird here. I ordered passion fruit iced tea and my relatives all got drinks from the bar. They all got their drinks first and I had to wait a while for my tea. We also ordered an Ahi tuna stack and we got that before I got my iced tea. It was kinda annoying because I was super thirsty. A couple minutes after we got our appetizer my iced tea finally came. It kinda tasted off though, like a diet iced tea, bleh. I ended up just drinking water for the rest of the time we were there. \n\nThe Ahi stack was ok. The tuna was good, the wontons tasted like they were fried in old oil though and there was just a huge amount of daikon and carrots that were pretty bland. The sauce on the plate was a really gross brownish green color that wasn't very pretty. It was a wasabi soy sauce, it tasted good though, not too overpowering. \n\nI haven't been to a Yard House in a while and they've really redone their menu. There's a lot of interesting stuff on their menu that I actually wanted to try. I didn't get to this time around though because we planned to go to dinner somewhere else. I might actually try out Yard House again to check out their new menu."

They are located inside the Red Rock Resort, with the usual Yard House setup. Lots of tables, good for group, and a fantastic beer selection. I would absolutely go back for drinks with a group of friends. \n\nThe food at this location was a bit below average- it was all okay (pasta, appetizers), but nothing stood out as great. Unfortunately, our waiter was basically unable to answer any questions about the food or the beers. Something I usually enjoy at Yard House is how knowledgable the staff is about the beer.  \n\nPros/Cons for going with a large group: \nThey split the check by customer (so it was easy to see what you ordered and total up how much each of us owed), although we then waited more than 30 minutes for our cards and cash to be taken."

The wait was not too bad, and with the bar and sports on TV it went by even faster. The bartenders were friendly and quick, and my Longboard Ale did not disappoint. Mmmmm, beeeeeeeeer. \n\nOnce seated we decided on the Lobster Crab Artichoke Dip as an appetizer. Personally I like this with the Pita wedges so I think they need to 86 the chips on the plate and add more Pita! I highly recommend this appetizer, it's one of our favorites! \n\nFor dinner we decided to try something new. Going off positive Yelp reviews I chose the Jambalaya on Jasmine Rice. My husband went with the Chicken Garlic Noodles. We were both happy with our meals, good flavor, cooked properly, all the basics. I've never had a bad meal at Yard House so this was no surprise to me. If we have to choose, my Jambalaya was the better of the two (Katie FTW, yet again!). \n\nI love bringing a large group to Yard House, we came here for my pre-bachelorette party dinner :) and that was yet again another great Yard House experience. \n\nI recommend Yard House for quality food and beer, it is consistent, family or large group friendly and they have a large, diverse menu."

Now that they've opened up in Red Rock Casino, its even better! The restaurant has much more space than town square with higher ceilings and bigger outdoor patio seating. Not to mention flat screen TVs around to watch them sports. \n\nThe food here is great. These are my top picks on the Appetizer menu:\nFried Calamari** (I'm a typical Filipina so you cannot NOT try calamari).\nHawaiian Poke Stack** (De-lish! It's fresh ahi with crispy wontons, carrots, bean sprouts, avocado, and wasabi soy sauce).\nSpicy Tuna Roll ** (This is not a cut roll. This is like one round giant roll. But yummy. Has seared rare ahi, avocado, edamame, cucumber, and the wasabi soy sauce). \n\nMy favorite Entree salad is the Ahi Crunchy. It has seared rare ahi, Asian slaw, field greens, crispy wontons mixed in soy vinaigrette. I feel like I could go on forever on all the yummy entrees they have. They have everything from burgers to steaks, to pastas and seafood dishes. Which is a plus for me because I need OPTIONS, so having selections to choose from, I can pick depending on my mood of the day.\n\nI am so glad that Yard House is much more closer to me, even for locals in the Summerlin area. I don't have to drive to Town Square and worry about the annoying one lane conversion once you exit Las Vegas Blvd off the 215. GIVE ME A SNAKE BITE PLEASE!!!"

            "review": "I have been to the Yardhouse a couple of times before, but I'll base my review on my most recent visit.  We visited on a Sunday night, specifically for the late night happy hour they offer (10PM-12AM).  First of all, let me start by saying their beer selection is fantastic and the happy hour food menu is decent.  It offers discounted beers, well drinks, and select appetizers.  \n\nOur waitress was nice, she seemed busy and maybe a little rushed at times.  She was helpful in explaining the beer list.  She checked on us a couple of times throughout the meal.  My only complaint is that I had to ask for a glass of water, which I think should be at least be offered, if not served without question  I give the service a 4/5.\n\n I had a bourbon and coke, which had a good amount of alcohol.  My girlfriend ordered the St. Louis Framboise (a belgian raspberry beer.)  I loved it, actually wish I had ordered that instead.  It was served in goblet, too.  The drinks were discounted during the happy hour, I believe each of our drinks were around $4 or $5 a piece.   \n\nNext, we ordered a bunch of discounted appetizers.  Our order included sliders, chicken lettuce wraps, Hawaiian poke stack, and blue crab cakes.  The sliders came with delicious skinny fries, although the sliders themselves lacked something.  I give them a 2/5.  The chicken lettuce wraps were just okay.   The chicken itself was not the best quality.  The pieces of lettuce were crispy and fresh, though.  This dish also came with 3 different dipping sauces.  The wraps get a rating of 3/5.  I enjoyed the blue crab cakes.  This dish contained 2 crab cakes on a plate drizzled with a creamy sauce and bits of mango.  It was good and deserves a 4/5.  Finally, the shining star was the Hawaiian  poke stack.  I have had this dish before and it was as good as I remember.  It contains plenty of fresh pieces of raw ahi tuna stacked with crispy wonton sheets.  There are some veggies in there too, along with a delicious wasabi soy sauce.  I love this dish and give it a 5/5.  \n\nAll in all it was a good experience.  Our bill came to $36, which is not bad at all.  The atmosphere in the Yardhouse is a bit loud and has a sports bar kind of vibe.  It's good for a casual date night or dinner with friends.  I'll visit again, for sure."

Although we had to wait almost 10 minutes before being greeted. My son and husband ordered burger medium rare that came out medium well. When they remade them it was still not the right temperature. We just ate it anyway since we waited for them long. Everyone else was done with our food by the time they ate! I can't believe they didn't even offer anything for the inconvenience. Table presence is key to good service and it was not here. I didn't really want to come back to this place because of service. I hate being profiled. I gave it a chance since they have great beer selection.  Which, by the way, we did not get in a timely manner. I pretty much hate this place now!!!!!!! Our server was lucky that we still tipped 15%! We go out to eat a lot. WE ARE NOT COMING BACK HERE!!!"

            "review": "Used to love Yardhouse until one happy hour evening.  The bar was quite busy as usual, we asked a bartender if she could let us know if someone is leaving soon as we'd take their seats. We were informed that they could not do so as it was \"First come, first served\" service. Fair enough. As we could not find 2 seats by the bar, we were looking for someone leaving soon. After 10 minutes we finally spotted a couple getting ready to leave, we immediately jumped there. Once we sat down, another bartender came to us and told us those seats were reserved for another couple that was waiting. Hmmm didn't another waiter has just told the opposite??? We were quite upset and were not going to leave since there were no reservations taken for a bar and we were the first to spot those vacating seats. The bartender called a supervisor who yet told us the same thing that a couple was waiting before us and those seats were reserved. She was quite rude about that too. \n\nWe were sooo angry, we called up a regional manager who took 20-30 minutes to arrive; he did, however, straighten the situation but we were way too pissed to enjoy a meal and drinks. We left shortly after. The experience was qite bad, I will not be visiting Yardhouse at Red Rock again."

Waited 20 minutes for table then after we sat waiter immediately wanted to know if we were ready to order. We had not even looked at menu so it was obvious they wanted to turn tables. \n\nGot our drinks and ordered appetizer. Ordered another beer and after 10 minutes waiter said bar was slow and beer was coming. Ordered dinner and nothing. After 20 minutes waiter came over and said kitchen lost our order what was it we ordered again. It was obvious the waiter was no good at this point 20 minutes later dinner came and by that time tables next to us had turned. We were no longer hungry and took food home with us. \n\nOf course when bill came there was no adjustment for late meals or even just a comped drink that we waited on. We are locals and this location caters to locals but we were really disappointed. \n\nNot sure if we will ever go back, they did not seem to care about us so why bother. Very disappointing."

When going out to eat in Vegas with there being so many options it's rare that I go to the same place more than once, especially being new and wanting to explore. But I crave this place so I keep going back (to the one in Red Rock or the 2nd location in the Quad) It has a cool bar vibe with tons of beer options, which is where I was introduced to my new favorite, Leinikugal (however you spell it) Sunset Wheat - it tastes like Fruit Loops! The wait staff has consistently been friendly and the menu is as big as a book...and that's my only complaint, narrowing it down to what I want to order feels like trying to make a life altering decision. Ok it's not that dramatic, but I do have to keep going back to try all the different things on the menu that made me salivate just reading. The food tastes like fine dining quality, without the stuffy restaurant ambiance. I can't sing this place's praises enough and hope I get a coupon or something for this heart felt review, cause I still have about 20 menu items I need to try  :)"

The service was quick and friendly, but the only slight \"quirk\" was the fact that they made us run a tab and closed it out after each round.  And they made us pay for our food as soon as we ordered, like before it even came to the table.  I think my friend and her husband ended up doing 3 separate transactions, one round of drinks of her credit card, cash for their food and another round charged to their room.  \n\nIt's a busy, busy place and there was a bit of a wait for a table, which is why we chose the bar, but I would definitely go back."

On the other hand, a Roasted Turkey Club, accompanied by serviceable French Fries, was a solid choice for comfort food.  No pressed turkey meat here!\n\nThe only negatives encountered on this night were a really loud noise level inside the dining room, and successive waves of circulating cool air that caused hot food to lose its heat rather rapidly. \n\n3-1/2 stars overall!"

            "review": "So went there last night (a Thursday) around 6:30. Wasn't very crowded as I was able to find a seat at the bar after just half a lap around. Waiter was attentive and proactively asked me if I wanted a water while I decided on drink and dinner. That was great and I was pretty excited that the evening would include great service, great beer and great food. The beer is where things went very wrong (especially for a place that people go to to drink a large selection of high quality beer). I ordered the house Belgian Tripel...it was out. He said it would be 5-10 minutes and asked if I wanted something else in the meantime. I asked for a Delerium Tremens. It came out with a 1/4 inch head that disappeared to no head in about 5 seconds. There were no bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. As I watched my sad little beer wither before I even took one drink, I already knew there was a pretty major CO2 problem because I immediately looked around and noticed that everyone else's beers also had no head - even the ones that had just just been poured like mine. I put it up to my lips and sure enough...probably about 10% carbonated compared to what it should have been. I told the bartender and he called over someone else, that person poured a small glass, tasted it and said...\"nope, it's fine\". I told bartender that it was not fine and I wanted another one. So he poured another and held the glass about two feet below the tap so it would create a bigger head. What...do you think I'm stupid? He gave me the beer and I watched the head disappear in 5 seconds. I told him it was also bad and I did not want it but that I would wait until the Tripel keg was changed. It got changed and he poured me the beer I'd been looking forward to all day...and it was as flat as a pancake too. I was super disappointed in the entire beer experience and didn't know why a bunch of people working in a place famous for beers were so ignorant of the product they were delivering. I travel to Vegas every other week and always stay at the Red Rock and always have at least one meal at The Yard House. Probably won't be my ritual any more."

You can't spare a little more sauce? I mean it's just drizzled on the plate with some sort of veggie sticks.  \n\nThe real disappointment was the famous spinach artichoke dip that I used to love, but now it's a smaller portion and the taste was forgettable. \n\nThe place was not packed for a Sunday afternoon, but the service was slow. Took nearly 45 minutes to get app's, had to send the chicken strips and fries back because it was cold, and wait another 20 minutes for a cup of chicken noodle soup that our guest didn't have time to eat and left.  Waitress was polite but seemed distracted, so the service suffered, but overall I wouldn't go back because it's all about the food, and the food was not good.\n\nLiving in Vegas gives you the opportunity to have many great dining experiences and I think that for the prices The Yard House is asking, they could get their act together on simple bar food."

The mash potatoes was also delicious, much better than the stuff at Lawrys, but Cheesecake Factory is still my favorite. \n\n@ Salmon Entr\u00e9e - I got to taste the salmon someone else in our group ordered. The salmon was good, however, it was seasoned very heavily. Almost overpowering much of the flavors of the salmon. If they used a little less seasoning, this dish would have been perfect.\n\n@ Lobster Garlic Noodles - Someone else in our group got this. The lobster had a sweet and fresh taste. Like my parmesan crusted chicken, it was good, but the sauce was a little too heavy and they seem to salt the dish a little too much. Everything tasted good, but they need to go easy a little lighter on the sauce and seasoning. Maybe they want you to order more beer?\n\n@ Crab Crusted Swordfish - Another person in our group got this. The swordfish was very tender and delicious. Like the other dishes, they went a little season crazy on this. The crab was very salty. \n\n@ Macadamia Nut Cheesecake - You may be thinking you get cheesecake, with a small top layer of macadmia nuts on top. Its actually the opposite. You get a layer of cheesecake, composed of a rich base of macadmia nuts, drenched in a puddle of caramel. This desert just didn't work. The cake was very sweet, and I have a sweet tooth. They need to drizzle the caramel, instead of drenching it. Sticking to a traditional cheesecake with a cheese base and macadmia nut topping would work much better. \n\n@ Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e - This desert was good. The only issue is on the menu they claim topped with chocolate, but its actually on the base. At first I was eating it without the chocolate. Then I noticed the chocolate base and got it with my vanilla custard and notice a big improvement. This dish really needs the chocolate flavor to work. \n\nIn the food department, everything was good. There are some major concerns over the seasoning of their meats, but this could be fixed. At least nothing tasted bad. The portions is also just the right size, not like the big plates you get at Cheesecake Factory or Claim Jumpers. No leftovers for lunch tomorrow, sorry.\n\nThere is some service issues with this place. First our waitress April is a very friendly waitress, but she seem a little flustered and didn't have communication with the people bringing our food. She would come to our table to check if the food came, but it didn't come. This happened numerous times. She forgot our drinks once or twice, she dropped the forks on the ground, and came out numerous times to give us more unnecessary utensils and plates. I think she was having an off night. \n\nThe only other issue with this place is the location of the doors. If you're coming through the casino, you're actually going through the back way. While you're greeted by someone, but it seems a little odd to have to go through the entire restaurant just to get your table. The other issue is the person greeting us told us about the wait time 30-45 mins. This was no where near as accurate as they say they were. They need to work on some better communication to better accurately give an estimation. This is just really a bad, confusing, and inefficient layout with many patrons going through the backdoor to be directed to the front just to get a table. We're in the digital age of information, they should be able to seat people from the back or the front of the restaurant. The easier solution would have been to plan ahead for issues like this.\n\nThe newest restaurant at a casino that doesn't suck and is overprice. Shocking! This place does have good food, but needs to tweak the dishes just a bit. For a place thats been open for a couple of days, I'm impressed by how relatively smoothly the restaurant is running and how pack this place was on a Monday night. This place could easily be one of my favorite restaurants to go to."

Hurray!! \n\nWhile I believe Yard House has lost it's allure over the past year and is probably only 3* worthy, I'm bumping it up thanks to their low cal drink menu. This Fresh & Skinny menu is fabulous and features several drinks in addition to the skinny margarita, including a lemon drop, a cosmo and a few others. I can tell you the skinny margarita tasted super sweet and the only difference is the missing salt rimmer - which unfortunately just happends to be my favorite part :-(  These drinks are between 115-175 calories. Not bad!\n\nThe food is average - since I'm a salad kind of girl I can't help but to leave a little disappointed. I'd much rather dine elsewhere, but their happy hour menu is extensive and with all the drink options, it's pretty easy to find a drink and appy for everyone.\n\nWe used to do happy hour here all the time, now we find ourselves here only once a month, if that."

They are like clones as far as food is concerned.  I went to that location first. We had a meetup and that was just a place that was not cheap but not too pricey but they have something for everyone. A $20-25 bill kind of place for a meal, for one that is."

If you like bar food, the Yard House has an extensive menu of offerings, but everything we recently tried was less than mediocre.  There are much better bar food restaurants out there....\n\nOur party of four shared two appetizers:\n\nFried calamari, which was the worse fried calamari I've ever had.  Overcooked and with absolutely no seasoning, it was bland, dry and disgusting. \n\nLobster, crab and artichoke dip with chips and pita, which had an unusual flavor, not quite crab dip and not quite artichoke, and lost somewhere in the middle. Pretty bad....one taste was enough for me. \n\nFor entrees we tried:\n\nSteak sandwich, which had a very tough and flavorless cut of beef in a bun filled with fried straw onions. Awful.\n\nTurkey pot pie, which had an undercooked pastry crust and served in a dish that seemed as big as a wagon wheel. Way too much food although it was filled with tasty chunks of turkey and veggies. Not bad, not good, but edible. \n\nCrunchy Ahi Salad, which had decent quality Ahi that was seared quite nicely.  This was the best dish we received. \n\nFish and chips, which were greasy and sort of bland. Edible but not a lot going for it.\n\nService was good, and again the beer was great.  The waiter removed the calamari from the bill after I told him it was tasteless. \n\nWe won't be back, except maybe for a beer."

Our waiter gave us our menu and then went MIA most of the time. It took longer than 10 minutes to put down our order. It took over 30 minutes for our food (a crab-cake sandwich special and a bbq chicken pizza) to arrive which is bad considering that 1) the restaurant was lacking patrons during this time and 2) they are trying to cater to the speedy lunch crowd.\n\nThe crab cake sandwich ought to be bread with a small side of crab-cake. There were large slices of bread to the point where you can barely see the crab cake. My husband did not finish the bread and actually opened up his sandwich and just ate the crabcake. The french onion soup it came with was okay - not cheesy enough but okay.\n\nThe bbq chicken pizza was okay - not great. The crust was not crisp enough. Too little toppings with too much sauce made this pizza feel pretty unbalanced. The accompanying field green salad was fine except for the raw leeks that were in there. (Leeks are really not meant to be raw, dudes!).\n\nOverall, this lunch service needs to be improved to match what happens here in the evening."

Okay, okay...maybe not famished but stopping at a place that boasts the most draft beers in the world caught my eye, plus it was connected to the red rock casino, double win!\n\nThe draft beer selections lined the center island of the bar all the way around with many of the boring bar regulars but with more craft than anything. The 3 page list of drafts were really impressive and it was nice that they offered 3 different sizes for pours but it was absolutely dreadful that they didn't offer the ability to create our own flights which made them lose a star in my book. The next star was lost because they really didn't have any hard to find specialty brews.... A large selection is nice but ill take a smaller selection any day for better quality.\n\nWe decided a small snack was called for so we decided we would split an appetizer between the three of us. The chicken nachos were mouth gobbling good, it was a hearty portion of multicolored chips that stayed crunchy even with the two different types of sauces, guacamole, sour cream, pinto beans, and obey gooey melted cheeses. Yum!! I was impressed with all the flavors and that it wasn't greasy in the least. \n\nI'd go to this chain again, but not without checking what beers are on tap."

I've had most of the menu, the only thing I really won't eat again is the turkey burger - it just seemed so weird to me - but the jambalaya is awesome, the regular burgers are standard, the apps are good...\n\nServers are friendly and efficient, beer is cold, food is fresh. Excellent for happy hour or a first date, as long as you don't have to wait too long. Cheap to moderately priced, social, good atmosphere, top pick."

Pair that with an overwhelming selection of interesting items and you have a menu full of food and drink that will appeal to everyone.\n\nThis makes Yard House an ideal place for large parties and group gatherings. It might not amaze everyone, but all are pleased with the amount of choices available.\n\nI've had some great food at YH locations and some very forgettable meals.  So while the menu is extensive and generally very appealing, not everything is great.\n\nThe location at Red Rock is a pretty good one. It's conveniently located and usually not too busy. The restaurant usually appears full but I've never had to wait for a table. \n\nThe beer selection is stellar, but tonight, both my pints (grapefruit sculpin and victory IPA) came out lightly chilled. I don't know about you, but I like my beer as cold as it can get before crystallizing. I know restaurants never serve beer that incredibly cold, but a place meant for beer should at least serve their beer cold enough to be called cold. Just a little disappointing to pay $7.50 for a nearly warm pint.\n\nThe food was kinda off tonight too. I got blackened swordfish tacos, which were a little salty, but pretty good. I usually have a burger here and I think I'll probably stick to their sandwiches from now on.  My wife tried a BBQ chicken pizza and it just seemed very uninspired. It was served warm, cheese had no flavor, sauce was way too sweet.. She only had a slice.\n\nI recommend their appetizers and beer highly, though. If you can make it during happy hour, this place is great!"

Here's what went down for dinner tonight!!\nMy beau and I ordered:\n\n- spinach crab dip \n- firecracker wings\n- surf n turf burger\n- Bahn mi pork belly sandwich\n*watermelon wheat beer\n*bacon Bloody Mary w/ beer shooter \n\nSpinach crab dip comes out nice and hot, nice balance of spinach and crab not too fishy like some are. Comes with warm pita bread and chips. I order this every time I visit!!!\nFirst time for the firecracker wings.. Yummy!!! Sweet and a little bit of spicy, but not too much, and had a nice cilantro flavor as well. Crunchy and not soggy. You haveto try these!!!\nBeau had his favorite surf n turf burger, medium done, topped with lobster and a side of shoestring fries and bearnaise sauce. Burger is delicious! Shoestring fries annoy me because they're too skinny, but they were perfectly seasoned and crunchy. Not a big fan of bearnaise, but went well with the burger. \nPork belly Bahn mi was so tasty!!! It came with a side of naked coleslaw with lime (forgettable) but the pork belly was nicely charred and flavorful and a bit sweet. The Vietnamese sandwich came together with a nice radish, carrot- slaw with cucumber and mint on top a ham spread (really good!) and a light citrus sauce. DELICIOUS!!\n\nMy watermelon wheat beer was nice and smooth, not sweet nor bitter, but perfect and the bacon Bloody Mary tasted like bacon and since we like it spicy, was extra savory! Not sure what to do with the beer shooter.. We just added it in! \n\nMy visit to yard house red rock location is always superb, service is friendly and prompt, and am always left satisfied. Thank you Ariandia for you service!!! 5 star all day long!!!!"

We all used to play in rock bands back in LA, so a place playing classic rock seemed seemed like a good fit.\n\nAlthough the place was packed - we got seated fairly quickly at a bar table in the thick of things.  I don't mind being surrounded by some hustle and bustle, but it was cold out - and every time someone opened the door out to the patio, we got hit with a blast of freezing cold air at our table.  Just a crowded restaurant trying to maximize space I guess.\n\nBeer selection is great - I forgot my reading glasses this time so I couldn't actually READ the menu, so I just went with a Stella.   For food I got the Ahi Crunchy Salad with field greens, asian slaw and crispy wontons tossed in soy vinaigrette (according to the menu) - it was quite good.  \n\nI'm a HUGE fan of al fresco hanging out / drinking / eating, and I'm glad to see that more places in Vegas are embracing it, so I'll probably be back later in the year when it gets a bit warmer and try the patio."

It wasn't as spicy that I expected, but boy was it yummy. What was kind of ehhh was my sons food, he ordered the Mac N' Cheese and it tasted a bit weird, maybe it's because I'm use to eating Mac N' Cheese from the box or Yard House's Mac N' Cheese was just odd. It had a weird texture to it that I really wasn't comfortable eating. My son also had clam chowder to go with his meal, that was good, but I still rather goto a warf to getting chowder.\n\nI seriously need to try more off their menu (poki, ahi, sushi/sashimi looks yummmmy), and this place just might be my all time favorite restaurant to eat at. This place does get packed at night on the weekends and when I say packed, I really mean it gets PACKED!

I don't drink, so a big, noisy and crowded bar and a restaurant known for their beer selection didn't really appeal to me. But like I said.... we had gift card, so hubby and I gave it a shot.\n\nWe've been TWICE now, and I have been extremely impressed both times.  \n\nThe first time we sat on the patio, which was really nice and comfortable.  It was a little chilly that day, so I was worried it would be too cold, but the hostess was really nice and let us go out and see how it felt before committing to an outside seat.  It turned out to be just fine because they have little space heaters out there which worked perfectly.\n\nOn a Yelp recommendation, we ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer (or a \"snack,\" I think they called it).  They were delicious, but we found out later that if your entree comes with fries, you can upgrade them to truffle fries (as well as garlic fries, sweet potato fries or onion rings) for just a dollar more, and you get a TON of fries -- way more than you get for the $4 \"snack\" portion -- so if you're interested in trying them, I would go that route instead.\n\nAnyway, the hubs went for his favorite thing on earth - Mac n Cheese - and he was not disappointed.  I tried a bite of it and I had to agree it was pretty darned tasty.  I went for the grilled cheese with tomato basil soup and I have to say... that was the most delicious grilled cheese I have ever had in my life.  That's some big words, cuz I've had some pretty good grilled cheeses in my time!  \n\nAbout halfway into it, though, I started to feel my arteries clogging and as I looked at the small puddle of oil collecting on my plate, I was feeling really guilty about how much i was enjoying it.  I think they must have slathered each slice of bread with a full stick of butter and then used about 2 pounds of thick-cut, full-fat cheese.  No WONDER it tasted so good! I was pretty happy that their dessert menu is crappy because I wasn't even the least bit tempted to order some more fattening food.\n\nOn our visit #2, we took an inside seat, which was still nice, but very loud.  If you're on a date, I would suggest taking the patio seating, which seemed a bit more quiet.  But be warned... even THAT is loud.  This isn't a quiet restaurant by any means.\n\nThis time we started out with the lobster/crab/artichoke dip.  Another good choice.  The husband got some kind of monster-sized burger with garlic fries (here's where we found out about the \"upgrade\") and I got the crab cake sandwich with onion rings.  Nothing bad to say about any of that!!\n\nI feel like the price is good for the quality of food and the level of service you receive here.  We ordered an appetizer and two entrees on each visit, and both times the bill came out to about $40-$45 with tip.  Well worth it for our fabulous meals and some leftovers to eat the next day.  We'll definitely be back."

It made my girlfriend emit garlic from her pores for two days afterwards and she lost a job because of it.\n\nJust joking on the job, but the smell was very real and pungent."

            "review": "The Yard House in Irvine is just like the Yard House everywhere. Clean, loud and full of ice cold beer on tap. \n\nI will get the obvious out of the way first, this is a chain in most suburban western region markets and thanks to the hard floors and being inside of a casino it is very, very loud at night, especially on the weekends. It is also worth mentioning these guys bust Classic Rock all day, everyday. \n\nThe menu features standard American fare that offers little in surprise but what they do offer is better than it has any right to be, particularly their burgers. My personal favorite is the Pepperjack Burger that features roasted green chiles, pepper jack cheese and garlic a\u00efoli on a grilled bun. The Black Truffle Cheese Burger (boasting house made truffle cheese, no less) and B\u00e9arnaise Burgers are also admirable, especially a few beers into the night. All burgers are accompanied with a decent helping of Fries and Yard House seems to get the cooked temperature right every time. Another stand out item is their French Onion Soup boasting a perfectly melted cheese and robust onion broth. \n\nThese guys also have an exemplar Happy Hour Menu offering an Ahi Poke Bowl, Ceviche and Truffle Fries that I can vouch for at very reasonable prices. The service has always been up to snuff both at a table or bellied up to their gigantic bar. \n\nWhich brings us to their best asset; the nearly 200 beers constantly on tap. If you are an adventurous beer drinker, it is pretty damn tough to beat this selection. Every imaginable craft brewery from Coast to Coast and across the ponds seem to be offered. Naturally, this makes the Yard House a great place to catch a sporting event.\n\nIf nothing else the beer selection alone will guarantee my return next time I am in Sin City."

            "review": "First off, I'd like to say that Yard House is our favorite go to restaurant. We were extremely disappointed with the service received on 2/15/14. The hostess told us it will be around 30min, took over an hour to be seated. \nOur waitress was a bit rude and had no emotion. We figured she was being like that because we were a party of 9 and thought she would get an automatic tip, so no effort was made on her part. \nShe asked my mom for her id, which was expired, so my mom handed her a passport. She had to go \"double check with the manager\" \nmy cousin also ordered a beer and handed her a Puerto Rico license. Apparently, she did not have a TAM card or could not verify ids by her self because once again, she had to \"double check with the manager.\" She even asked my cousin for the date on the card. Has she not seen an id other than Nevada's?? When she returned, she did not inform my cousin whether or not the id was fine. He had to ask her and she said yes with an attitude. \nOur drinks were empty. Warm beer. Waitress disappeared for a good while. \nBy the time our food came out, we still had our dirty appetizer plates. I asked her for another drink which she brought another of, yet I had to ask her to take away my previous watered down one. \nMy cousin asked for another beer and to please make sure it was a cold one, she did not look up from her pad and made a face. \nI asked her for a box for my food and it took her around 15 minutes. I looked around, she was not with other tables. \nIt was my brothers birthday so she did bring out a plate of ice cream yet DID NOT OFFER US DESSERT. she dropped the ice cream off and left. Returned 10 min later and asked if we wanted any other desserts (as she pulled the check out) \nOur whole dinner conversation consisted of wondering what her deal was. What type of server doesn't even attempt to get a good tip or make a good experience for their guest?? Horrible experience. Bet part about her was offering to take a picture of us. \nTo our surprise there was not an automatic tip on the bill which drove us even more mad because it just showed us that that's the type of server she is. \nWalking out, the manager asked us how everything was and I did have to let him know and he asked a couple of questions. I saw him go and talk to her immediately. \nI will not stay away because I love the Yard House, but I will not be seated with Ashley again."

The sushi was not fresh and the truffle fries were greasy.\nThis place is always busy, but they need to step it up on their quality of food."

            "review": "Yard house is always a safe choice when my family has no idea where to go for dinner. They have a variety of foods to choose from, something for each of us. I don't think yard house has ever let us down! LOVE the happy hour on food, can't go wrong there! Aureese seated us and she was great, such a sweet heart. Our waitress was also very nice. She got our drink orders right away and our appetizers and can tell we were ready to order our entrees as well. She made sure not to bring our appetizers, soup and entrees out at the same time thank god. If you arent sure what type of cuisine you're in the mood for yard house is deinitely a go to next time you're out shopping at downtown summerlin."
