But I tend to always order my cake :)\n\nThe last time we were there they have a huge new section of the menu of veggie burgers and vegetarian items! I can not wait to go again soon to try out some of the new items...not sure if they are so new I don't think I noticed them last time...because I always order the same thing and I don't open the menu :)))))\n\nYUMMMMM it makes me want one right now!!!!!"

If there's a beer you've never tried , they are more than happy to bring you a sample. Out of all the food my favorite is their lobster burger, it is served with a regular burger pattie but then topped with lobster chunks. Also they have skinny style fries, very good. \n\nIf you are feeling extra maughty the brownie cake is great. Its hot brownie baked into a skillet topped with ice cream."

The only thing I noticed on their menu here (Las Vegas Town Square) they don't have Kung Po Calamri..\nBut other then that..the outside patio seating is a must...( late night around this time 1130pm..nice cool breeze..then a sun blazing at 110 degrees) but I ordered the wings so yup..that's all"

I can't even count the amount of times I come here.  Our new faves we've discovered:  Tortilla soup (the bf loves loves loves he gets a whole bowl) and the turkey burger.  That turkey patty is fricken delish!  I would do it protein style and its just fricken good. Just wish there's was better phone reception here (any att local knows it just sucks). LOL"

Till our last visit...\n\nWe dined here last Friday night and our server, Brandi was awesome! She was friendly, attentive, suggested some good stuff and made us laugh. She touched the table just enough times for us to feel like we didn't have to search for someone if we needed something. \n\nAs for food, I tried the street tacos. The Korean short rib taco and chicken...really, really good! We also tried the poke stack, delicious!\n\nI'm sure we will be back but I want Brandi's table"

LOVE LOVE LOVE this fantabolous place with their awesome selection of amazing beers and a menu to pair with it. \n\nDouble, no TRIPLE kudos to the waiter who knew literally every beer that I asked a question about, and I'm talking well over 10!  He rocks my tubular socks and I hope that I get him again when I make it back there!\n\nI like the setup of the place and how when you walk in, you look to the left and you see this massive amount of keggage going on- it just makes you drool.  The ambiance was perfect, the bar was large and the TV's were all set to the good ole Giants and Cowboys game (first game of the season, this was serious business no matter who your team is)  \n\nSo, they offered me everything I could ask for:\n\n-Ginormous selection of beer\n-Football on multiple TVs\n-Awesome wait staff\n-Perfect ambiance\n\nMake this a stop next time you're in Town Square.  If you don't you're just a silly little goose!"

The happy hour is awesome and the selection of beers on tap is amazing.\n\nI like to sit at the bar because the bartenders are very attentive to your needs.  I really enjoy that they have the option of \"shorty\" glasses to try a couple new beers that you've been curious about.\n\nFood wise the chopped salad is impressive. The seared ahi steak sandwich is really good, so much so that I've ordered it several times instead of trying something new.\n\nYard House is priced accordingly for Town Square, so I'd advise to hit up happy hour for good deals on food. Definitely check it out though anytime for a beer or two."

            "review": "Great new selections like the \"snacks\" and there are indicators for Vegetarian and \"under 600 calories\" meals!\n\nAnother restaurant that I have frequented quite a few times since it first opened In 2008 and have sampled most of the menu. It's been a while since I've visited, but I decided to keep it simple and go back to my favorites.\n\nSPICY TUNA ROLL: They'll warn you EVERY time - it's not really a sushi roll. It's a beautiful stack of chopped cucumbers and edamame, layered with spicy tuna, and topped with avocado. A little sriracha, sesame oil, and sauce around it to add some flavor. Delicious and light!\nORGANIC TOMATO BISQUE (WITH GRILLED CHEESE): You don't have to get the grilled cheese, but you haven't had a grilled cheese sandwich until you've had this one. Crusty, oily artisanal bread with four fabulous cheeses and tomato oozing between their slices. With the hearty tomato bisque, crazy good.\nFIRECRACKER WINGS: I'm not crazy about wings nor do I order this often, but the \"firecracker\" sauce is just damn good. Zesty, spicy, sweet, and very flavorful! Give them a whirl to get away from the boring hot, medium, or wild wing sauces.\nPEACH APPLE COBBLER: It's just really good. Not much to explain. I tried it the first time in the Trio Dessert Sampler and I ended up liking this one better than their souffl\u00e9s. The \"cobbler\" part is really great.\n\nThere's H/H in the middle of the day (M-F) from 3pm-6pm and at night after 10pm (not Fri and Sat), so that's a great time to go for great deals on their appetizers and alcohol. I'm not a big fan of their martinis (not sure why, but I've tried several on multiple occasions and they are really terrible), however, there are people that love them. May just not be my style."

            "review": "I love The Yard House. It's a sports/beer bar, but it's not tacky, or like some kind of man cave, in fact, the Yard House seems to be able to pull off a super chill, highly relaxed atmosphere that feels classy and fun. Lots of big TVs everywhere, any game you could want to watch, with a dimly light atmosphere. YH has more beers on tap than you could ever hope to drink in your visits there. \n\nJust like their sort of combination feel (nicer bar/restaurant- awesome sports bar) they've managed to do something similar with the menu. Normally, Im a fan of restaurants not trying to do too much, and sticking with a few things that they know how to do well, but this place apparently knows how to do it all well. We came during happy hour and had cheap drinks, and half priced appetizers, firecracker wings, onion rings, poke stack and crab cakes. All were absolutely fantastic. Especially the wings. \n\nUnlike most sports bars, this place has never been incredibly loud, the way most sports bars are. Great atmosphere, awesome food, attentive staff, badass place to watch a game."

Pretty good service.  Somewhat dim lighting but it serves a purpose providing nice ambiance. Great place for all kinds of affairs from family dining, to dating, hanging with friends or having a business dinner.  I would come back here again for sure if I get back to Vegas.  I suggest the Calamari appetizer.  It was fresh tasting, not overcooked and flat out yummy!"

            "review": "My boyfriend and I came to eat here for a celebratory occasion however, I wish we hadn't. \n\nI ordered the small chicken Cobb salad and accidentally forgot to ask them to remove the bleu cheese. Our server Mike was fantastic, he had no problem taking the salad back to the kitchen to remove the cheese. When Mike returned with my salad it looked great, but as I started mixing the salad ingredients together I noticed the hard boiled eggs were grey and the tomatoes the cook served me were all spoiled. I understand that because of my mistake they had to remake my salad all over again but, the cooks should not be allowed to even serve rotten or spoiled food to their customers (especially because the food is being paid for). At this point I had lost my appetite so I asked for the manager, Debbie. I thought the manager was suppose to help solve the issue not treat you like you're ignorant. Debbie said \"that's the color tomatoes are suppose to look like\" implying that I was being scandalous for no reason. I grabbed the fork and tossed the tomatoes over so she could see that the tomatoes were Black. She took the tomatoes to the back to show the kitchen manager & tell them to \"be more careful.\" It just didn't seem like a coincidence that the cooks served me a bad salad after I made them redo it & I emphasized that to Debbie but she was no help. In fact, she made my experience worse by talking to me as though I were a twelve year old. She never returned after she took the tomatoes to the kitchen. Mike was the only person who actually helped, which is why I'm leaving two stars instead of one. Kudos to Mike for working with such immature and unprofessional people. & thank you for not charging us for the salad, I wouldn't have paid for it anyway."

Though they were pretty busy, they managed to accommodate us and service us quickly. I had their teriyaki chicken with pineapple and brown rice. Needless to say, they nailed it.

Usually the place good but tonight they bombed out. \n1) waiter needs to go back to bussing tables he's not ready to be serving \n2) nothing worse than just staring your salad and the entree comes.  Really hate that and it's partly due to inexperience with a server who puts the whole order in at once. \n3) don't take my food you brought too early and set it in a warmer for whatever time it takes us to eat our first round and then bring it back. When we tell you we want fresh you better do so or you will get a nasty review like this one \n\nSo bottom line you guys screwed the pooch and lost another group of customers"

This location can get really packed during Thur-Sun night and being located in Town Square that's fairly common with the establishments they have here with the exception of Kabuki.\n\nThey have a big selection of beers on tap in Yard House.  But with the way I am I don't  take advantage of trying out other selections. I'm a Guinness and Bud Light guy. The setting is like any other Yard House and the pretty friendly crowd.  No complaints here except at times its hard to catch the Bartenders attention.  If you're not looking to party but just want to hang out with friends to drink, eat, and watch sports, Yard House is the place to be in Town Square."

My server Sara was fantastic and much better than the service you receive on the strip.\n\nThey have such a great craft beer line up on tap. It was really tough to choose from. But the server was quick to suggest things and talk craft beer. \n\nI had the Calamari and spicy thai pizza and both were great. I mean it is pub food so keep that in mind. But still good.\n\nSo do yourself a favor and go check this place out and take a break from the slots and overpriced Budweiser. Happy hour is from 3-6 so that means cheap pint's and food.

I thinking of good place too go hang out have some good food, good beer, television around watch game, and not loud can hang out talk stories catch up. Yard House would be the perfect place although it can be loud. I went on tuesday night so not so bad plus ended up sitting outside on the outdoor cover patio area. It worked out great! =)\n\nI checked in too my surprise the wait was not very long got buzzed less then ten mins. Just first glance the place was packed that night. The server she was great about being patience since cousin guys running late. The first things I LOVE about the YH but at the same time frustrating figure out beer too start the night, The list is so long if there something that not find or something similar too likely would be very surprised. I went with the Kona Brewery Fire Rock Ale. I love my Kona Brewery not only because from Hawaii but good beer! The most common one see is Longboard so saw another one on tap! Hell yay! The rest of the night went with another my favorite Firestone Pale Ale. It another one that hardly see on tap at bars. I love there beer still have since visited Firestone winery. \n\nThe food was good as always! It been while but remember the Hawaiian Poke Stack stood out for me. Poke never go wrong in life. I love the way everything balances together. The Poke nice and fresh soy style Poke. The crispy wonton that adds little crispy fried texture plus works out great scoop up all the Poke. The vegetable gives it more depth and flavors too the dish. The wasabi soy drizzle around nice accent too the whole dish. It daunting looking at it start height. Once break down all good stuff. The second app had the bearnaise slider. Honestly not really big fan. I asked the server she recommend as second app. It more miss then hit. The slider meat itself nothing special little dry side. The bearnaise sauce itself nothing special. You combine the sauce with the fried onion on top of the slider and the bun. Ok. Sure pass on sliders plus heavy app start the meal.\n\nI had the Street Taco (Chicken tinga). I wanted too try something different then my last visit. I glad I did! It was awesome. The combination of the chipotle tomatoe sauce plus the feta cheese right balance with spice and cheese. I enjoyed the fact not over stuffed with things in the taco. I added the beans and rice. The rice was tasty stuff. The beans honest never got too because the beers and apps all stuff. \n\nDessert my cousin and I split a Lemon Souffle off our sever recommendation. She got right on. It was not your traditional souffle. That it would be bursting like ballon out of the dish. It smaller portion really for one. Dessert we were all pretty full but try something sweet. It was just right amount of lemon and whipping cream or ice cream on top. It perfect dish too end the night. Good good, good times, and family!!"

            "review": "I really, truly, honestly wanted to give this place five stars.  The vast selection of beer is mind-boggling.  Beer after beer after beer...beers you have never heard of, eagerly waiting to be sampled.  I came in with my family for a late lunch (3:00 on a Saturday) so there was no wait.  The service was great.  I have two complaints, though.  First, the beer sampler is mediocre at best.  It was your typical six 5-oz glasses, but the choices were already set.  Whoever picked the beers for the sampler must have been feeling very uninspired, because they had two Gordon Biersch beers.  Gordon Biersch is a good beer, but I feel that with the huge selection available, it is definitely on the JV squad of beers.  If you go to Yard House looking to try something new and exotic, not just the microbrews they sell at your local grocery store, you would be better off convincing your dining partners to purchase a few different pints rather than relying on the sampler.\nSecond, the portabello burger was unimpressive.  The bun turned mushy and fell apart when I tried to eat it by hand.  Maybe it was meant to be eaten with a fork and knife and I am some uncultivated country rube unacclimated to the proper use of dining utensils.  But I think the primary purpose of going to the Yard House is to drink beer; having food available (even lackluster portabello burgers) is a consolation prize."

I was thirsty and this hit the spot. \n\nFor an app, we had had the onion ring tower once before and my husband ordered it again. It was just like our previous version, just fried onion rings served with dipping sauce, it was just okay. \n\nI wanted to try the french onion soup and I could add that to my pastrami sandwich. The soup was really good, served with deep rich flavors of the beef broth and onions all covered with melted cheese and under cover, the french baguette bread. Very good soup. \n\nMy pastrami sandwich was served with pickle and fries and had a fair amount of meat. It was served on fresh bread and was a decent size, my husband had ordered the seared tuna sandwich and we decided to trade off, he took half mine and I took half his. I do have to admit, my pastrami was better. The tuna was lightly seared and seemed fresh, but I like my tuna sashimi style without any bread! \n\nWe did enjoy the meal, however, I guess it's not an impressive place for eating. Since their focus is on the over 100 beers served, this is more of a drinking place."

You have to go there early if you want to sit at the bar. There is always a wait outside every time I go there. So, I guess it is pretty popular. The portions are huge , ideal for sharing."

I had the best steak sandwich I've ever had in my life!  It was a little more cooked than I had asked for ( I ordered med-rare and I got medium toward the well side), but nevertheless delicious!  And the steak was so succulent and tender I really can't complain. My hubby had the seared ahi sandwich, which was mouth watering delicious. \n\nThe service was good even if the waitress was a little bit too fake, but everyone in Vegas is working on tips so I can't blame her. She did let my beer go empty one time though!  Shame on her.\n\nUnlike the location in Long Beach this one seems to be very family oriented, there were tons of people here eating with their children.  Hardly anyone at the bar, go figure.\n\nWe'll definately come back next time we're in town."

We sat at the bar cause there was a half hour wait for a table our bartender was Juan, after ordering drinks we ordered our 1st appetizer, boneless wings with barbecue sauce. What we got was wings in hot sauce so after waiting for someone to check on us they reordered the correct wings only to still come with hot sauce. Juan said at least we are consistent. At this point Jon took over and offered us a free round of drinks only find out at checkout he only gave my girlfriend a free drink and charged for mine. We didn't order anymore food after that. On top of all this an NFL game was on and they kept changing the station. Not cool for a sports theme at the bar. I work near Town Square and have lunch there at least 3 times a week, but I'll be taking YardHouse out of the rotation."

The atmosphere is really inviting, great for groups and reflective of what a tap house should be.\n\nFirst trip I ordered the half order jambalaya, second trip the seared ahi tuna sandwich on rye.  \n\nIt's hard to make a good jambalaya that isn't too salty, most are, and the YH hit it on the head.  The shrimp were large, and sat on top a cup plateau of rice, with the chicken, crawfish, and sausage in a moat of spicy cream sauce around.  Some of the best jambalaya I've had and would certainly order again.\n\nThe second round was the ahi tuna sandwich.  I was a little suspect out the gate with it coming on rye, but had a little trust from the last trip and how great the jambalaya was.  As the plate sat down, I could tell the ahi tuna was not seared to rare, but more of a medium well, cooked white with only traces of pink, bummer.  Hoping the toasted rye bread would compliment the meat and somewhat pickup where it left off, it didn't, and just made the sandwich more difficult to handle, literally.  On the upside, the peppercorn aioli and caramelized onions saved the sandwich from a certain fate in the back kitchen's garbage can.  Normally, I would have sent it back, but I was with my boss for dinner and decided to suck it up rather than act like a food snob for \"overcooking cooking my ahi tuna\", not a good look.\n\nThis place is pricey, perhaps over priced in some respect, but if they can pull off all their dishes as well as they did the jambalaya, I'll come back for not just the beer."

I was here this past weekend 3/12 with a group of about 6-7 girls and our server was an older gentleman named \"Chris\". First of all, he had the worst attitude on this planet. We were waiting on a couple girls to join us (they were literally minutes away) and him and his boss (who I don't know his name) kept asking us if they were on their way, after several times of telling them YES THEY ARE PARKING they must of got the hint. It literally took them an hour to bring out our food, we hardly even ordered anything besides appetizers and drinks. My friend ordered a Lemon Drop martini and it was barely filled to the top WITH NO SUGAR around the rim. Was this for a kid, perhaps? Baby size Lemon Drop Martini. I think they finally got it right the second time around...mind you these drinks are not cheap but they sure are cheap as far as the amount they give you. So, we were on a time crunch and finally our food comes out. My pasta was absolutely DISGUSTING. It's like they took the pasta, chicken and threw in a can of some type of creamy sauce. Had no flavor to it whatsoever!! I always order this meal at the Yard House at Red Rock and it's always so amazing. NOT THIS LOCATION. Our server Chris, was terrible. His attitude was so rude, like he was rushing us but as soon as we asked the status of our order he seemed to have tude. It definitely seemed like he hated his job. Don't work in this industry or high pressure environment if you can't handle it. If you're going to work in the food industry and serving people make sure you fix your attitude or take your damn happy pills. This is not the first time I've experience terrible service here. I will never go to this location again. Save yourself time and avoid this place at all cost."

About 15 dollars on average for an entree. \n\nOur order: \nCoconut Shrimp: About 13 dollars for 4 large shrrrammmppss. Yummy coconut crunchy goodness. 13 dollars worth? Eh. I would have liked it a bit cheaper.\nGarlic Noodles: Not your average garlic noodles. It was more buttery than garlicy. It's not what you taste in most Chinese restaurants.\nSliders with sweet potato fries: decent. To me, they were just a bit average. But nonetheless, good.\n\nIt's a bit dark inside. Sets the mood. :op\n\nYardhouse, I like you. Yes, I truly do."

We had a group of 18 and didn't make reservations, the manager got us seated as soon as possible. Our servers took our drink and food orders quickly and made sure the little kids got their food first. Everyone was pleased with their meals and one of our servers brought over a free habanero beer sampler for my brother. The staff were patient with us as we were a large group and didn't seem to mind all the kids running around. The service here was great and I really appreciated that."

My mom was looking for a dress in Town Square, and we decided to lunch at Yard House.  Generally I am a difficult person to eat with because of my dietary restrictions, but thanks to Mitch my life was made easier.\n\nYard house, a veggie/vegan portion of the menu that has mock meat dishes.  This basicall means, you can can get most the items with meat on the menu, with veggie meat instead.  \n\nI had a grilled spicy chicken sandwich on sourdough, with fries.  It was good,  not huge (which is good), and it came with Fries...The yard house fries are so good, since they use truffle oil.  YAY!  At the time i ordered my server wasn't sure if everything was 100 percent vegan, without having to ask he went out of his way to make sure I was eating no animal products. (THANK YOU!).  Having a server check with out asking is amazing.  No one ever does it, and nothing spoils a meal like hidden animal bits.  \n\nI will come back here again, especially when I am with family or other meat eaters.  A great place for non adventurous eaters."

Umm, yeah that's going to kinda make me a little upset. \n\nI've frequented this location NUMEROUS times, but today was probably a weirder experience. Our server, Jenn seemed very excited to get a nice hefty party of 8 at the table next to us! They seemed like a nice crew, beers and appetizers all around, you know the gang just talking about workflow drama. Our server was definitely more interested in the energy from that table, rather than the quiet somber table of two we had. Don't blame her, make your money girl. I just wish she wasn't so monotone, we are here to get a head change and she's killin the vibe a bit! I couldn't take her recommendations of food seriously because she didn't seem enthusiastic about anything she was naming. \n\nThis used to be THE happy hour spot, but lately I've found other hot spots to hit up! The portions have definitely changed over the last few months, which I should have asked if that was a major difference on the menu since my last visit. I enjoyed some skinny margaritas, because I've taken months off of drinking to focus on my fitness so I didn't want to drink my calories in alcohol! They were okay! I definitely felt a buzz but I just wish the drinks came at a consistent pace to keep the vibe going. Other than that, the lemon drop was alright but the skinny cosmo martini is one of the better ones, in my opinion. \n\nThe appetizers have changed so much, I'm sure the other reviews have pointed that out as well. I enjoyed the Hawaiian pizza and spinach dip(to die for!) The poke nachos & fried calamari are on such a big plates, I'm not a seafood eater so I felt bad my poor date had to chow all these seafood apps by himself. \n\nOther than that, I feel sitting at the bar provides you the best service! \n\n\n\nUPDATE: 10/2 I just checked my credit card app & it looks like my lovely server Jen changed the numbers on my tip to leave herself a nice $21.46 tip! Man, was I generous or what?! HAH! good thing I caught this talking to my friend about credit cards and debt and stuff haha. Wow, I feel betrayed, however the manager Allison definitely took charge on this one. \n\nI'm still in disbelief that someone changed the numbers on something I AUTHORIZED to an amount they DESIRED. I'm very sad one of my favorite locations would employ someone that could potentially do this on a regular basis. Please double, if not TRIPLE check your receipts before leaving! I'm still in shock. I'll be doing a survey, contacting corporate and going down later this week to verify my signature and speak with management in regards to this. \n\nWow..."

We did have to wait 30 minutes on a Friday around 8pm, not bad since it was packed-at least they knew what they were doing getting it moving.\nWe sat outside since it was a nice night. We ordered the b\u00e9arnaise burger (b\u00e9arnaise sauce, fried onions) with garlic fries, the pastrami benedict burger (roasted tomatoes, fried onions, swiss, b\u00e9arnaise sauce, fried egg) with onion rings and the kids chicken teriyaki with fries.\nThe b\u00e9arnaise burger was ok nothing special and a little drying( bland and I wouldn't recommend )\nThe pastrami burger was really good but a mess to actually eat- my man lived it though and will be getting it again. Our son also loved the chicken and fries, his also came with a drink and a rice crispy treat at the end in cookies and cream. He loved it and for only $7 seemed like a great deal!\nThe waitress however was a nightmare, she didn't seem like she wanted to be there and was annoyed after every question I asked. Maybe she had a long day but I felt like I was bothering her.\nPs they also charge $1 extra for garlic fries which was a regret since there was soooo much onion in it, and for a $1 total scam! The onions rings were a dollar more too but very good, I'd pay $1 more again."

Pretty nicely done, actually, but would be nicer if they closed it off to care traffic. We likely wouldn't have found the place, though, were it not for our GPS leading us straight there on city streets. \n\nWas busy for early evening but we got a table right away. The staff was extra attentive and got us everything we needed. My boyfriend and I were meeting friends and since we had a plane to catch, ordered before they got there. Getting meals at different times and two different bills was no problem for our waitress. What a relief!\n\nPerusing the menu, I was surprised at the selection. Though the Yard House is a brew pub, they have a pretty interesting and appetizing menu that include gluten-free and vegetarian options. My boyfriend got a grilled ahi salad and I got the mac and cheese which is nothing like the usual mac and cheese. It had chicken, bacon, and wild mushrooms in it with a small pasta I'd never seen before. The sauce was made of several exotic cheeses and it was delicious! My friend's four-year daughter shared it with me so though I thought it gourmet and exotic, it was easy enough for her to enjoy as well. I tried the ahi and it was really tasty too. Our friends got burgers with cones of crispy french fries and everything looked delicious. \n\nOverall, the restaurant is a loud and happening place but seems to be a good place to bring kids while still feeling like you're having a night out on the town. Prices were very reasonable and the service was fantastic. I would definitely come back."

After a good 10 minutes, I finally got my drink and, at the same time, mi amigas showed up ready to eat.  As crowds started to pile in for dinner, my very bright red disco-light pager thing went off. We were seated in one of their very long booths, that can take forever to get out of if you're sitting by the wall.  We had the pleasure of having a waiter who was training a newbie (shadowing).  It's cool to train new staff, but it seemed like our \"veteran\" waiter had difficulty multi-tasking with serving, remembering small stuff, and training.  Other waiters were gracious enough to help out.  \n \nThe large selection of beers, happy hour, and the fact that it's located in the new Town Square mall, away from casinos, inspires me to come back.  My new favorites at YH are the mouth-freakin-watering Ahi dishes (ahi crunchy salad and seared ahi sashimi appetizer), lettuce wraps, and the lobster-crab-artichoke dip.  Mi amiga's grilled rib eye steak was not cooked to her specs, so she returned it.  Next thing you know, the general manager personally serves her a new rib eye steak done right...on the house.  Now that's the way to do it!"

Never checked on us or followed up on drinks, by the time he came around we weren't thirsty anymore.\nFast forward to the sales transaction....server acknowledged two credit cards and repeated to us that he was going to split the check. Server comes back with only one credit card to which the entire check was charged. After minutes of flagging down our server we told him that only one card was charged and one card was missing he quickly took the check back and walked back to the registers. Minutes pass and he returns again now with both cards with split checks and said that the missing card was declined so that's why he didn't bring it back the first time. Dumbfounded, we then brought to his attention that one card was now charged twice (I verified through my online bank app) and his explanation for the other card missing for five minutes during the transaction is extremely suspicious and made no sense. We demanded to speak to a manager and the manager cited that it was busy and there was just a mix up on the registers. To add insult to injury he then tried to diffuse the situation/appease us by offering $5 gift cards! Wow! What we wanted was an explanation for the missing card and a guarantee that we wouldn't get charged three, four, five times for bad service. We walked away with his business card, which we had to ask for and an insincere apology from our server. \n\nBe sure to dine here if you want subpar service or want to be scammed!\n\nNote: I had to give them a star to continue with this post!"

This time my bae and I shared the calamari and the classic ranch salad. The calamari was pretty average, but good. The salad was a bit disappointing dressing wise, if it's called a classic ranch salad you would think I should certainly be able to taste the ranch, but not the case with this one. I recommend trying the grilled cheese or lamb burger here. Those are typically my go to options. \n\nOverall another great yard house location located in a central part of the valley.

Luckily, reverse Happy Hour happens late at night, which is why on my most recent visit, I was here with Justin G. (6/18/14.)\n\nI've been here before for dinner and this place is pricey. Happy Hour is definitely the way to go if you wanna try this place out. While I won't go over what I've had here before in detail, I will say that many of the entr\u00e9es are quite bland.\n\nJustin and I ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, garlic noodles and chicken nachos. It was a HUGE amount of food and came out to $18. \n\nPizza - according to Justin, \"I feel like pizza is pizza. It's hard to get bad pizza anywhere.\" \n\nNoodles - terrible. Would not get again. I asked them to not put tofu in the noodles, but didn't notice that the noodles were covered in edamame. These were not only covered in toxic legumes,  they were bland and had no garlic taste whatsoever. Skip for time and all eternity. \n\nNachos - good. Too many beans. Would definitely order sans beans (uggggh) and would have been better with hot sauce.\n\nPlace is very loud and very busy. At 10:30 PM, there was a line to get in to be seated. That either speaks to how good this place is or how few options are in Vegas on a late Wednesday night for food.\n\nEdited to add: They do not have good Ranch. They need to get their dressing game on lock because it is shameful."

He's been like that several times now, even when my outgoing husband has tried to engage him in a convo, it's just not happening. That dude either hates life, people, his job, or all three. Not a fun way to start the night.\n\nSo we ended up there Thursday night just because I wanted the Dunkelweizen. Waitress says they don't have it, they're phasing it out, says she'll bring me a tester of a similiar one. Ok. \n\nComes back with another dude who says they're not phasing it out, he thinks they're just out but maybe they have an untapped keg in back. He'll go check. Next thing I know a different guy drops off a pint of some other beer. I take a few sips and it's fine, but not the dunkel and I am confused why it was given to me. \n\nI figure I'll ask the waitress and in the meantime our apps are dropped off by yet another guy. Truffle fries tasted fine, but were cold. Hummus was weird. Couldn't figure out if it was old, over-seasoned, or had been dropped in a dirt pile and scooped back into the bowl. Kept finding weird super dark patches, so that's a no.\n\nAll this time while we're sort of eating,  I am taking sips of the beer because 1. I'm thirsty and have nothing else to drink and 2. Our waitress has pulled the famous Yard House dissappearing act. She finally shows up and I ask her why I have this beer \"Oh, that's the one I was telling you about that tastes like the dunkel\" I said, I thought you were bringing me a tester? Blank stare from her...I say, I wouldn't have ordered this one...She says \"well, I can take it away?\" I said I've already had half of it while waiting for you to come back...more awkward silence and finally she says I can charge you for a shorty? I say sure, fine and she leaves\n\nKeep in mind we never ordered dinner, and when she was at the table our fries were gone, we are not eating the hummus and she proceeds to dissappear for TWENTY minutes. We sat there, not eating, I'm not drinking (husband was drinking soda which was getting replaced by a busser, I think) and we are desperately staring down every server in the place trying to telepathically beg for the check. That is when I added my not so favorable check in because I was pissed. We finally spot our waitress and practically yell out for the check and she seems genuinely surprised (REALLY?!?!) so I guess she was super clueless about us not having an enjoyable time. \n\nLuckily we had cash, so we could bail without waiting another 20 minutes for a credit transaction, and have vowed to never ever ever go to Yard House again."

            "review": "Pop quiz: how sad is it that eating at this Yard House was one of my most anticipated moments before getting on the plane and heading out to Las Vegas for a few days? Gambling, glitz, girls and other words that start with \"G\" are all fine and dandy, but sometimes a guy just wants to down a few beers, chomp on some outstanding food and unwind in a place where not everyone is a raging tourist carrying an over-sized plastic drink that is watered down and reeks of desperation. This is that place.\n\nMy folks and I actually made it over here before they opened on a Monday morning and people were already lined up at 10:50 a.m. That's cool, right? This place clearly has a faithful audience, as evidenced by this review. And once those doors opened, shoot: it's like the customers in line thought the first 10 people in the door got a free unicorn that performs karaoke exclusively to hair metal songs. They rushed the door with a fervent desire to be first in and we just sort of meandered in after them. It's a big place with plenty of seats - there's no point in scrambling over each other to be the first one in. There's a lengthy patio, a surrounded bar and more seating than the average bar would know what to do with.\n\nA hostess guided us to a booth opposite a table of nine individuals who exemplified the \"money cannot buy class\" rule. We overheard them tell the waitress they had to be out of there to catch a movie so right away you could tell this had potential to be the table from Hell. We already felt for this gal and then we realized she was waiting on us, too! Let it be known that Tasha, our waitress, got the MVP award for eternity during this shift because when the place opened, it appeared she got triple sat right out of the gate. Now I'm not an expert in the service industry but I know how hard it is to recover from a hand dealt like that in the opening minutes. We assured her we were in no rush, mostly because we weren't, and partly because we did not want to witness a breakdown on the floor. To her credit, she kept her cool and was efficient as she was sassy.\n\nSpeaking of keeping cool, you might want to psych yourself up before eating here because the menu is positively Dickensian with its verbiage. Six pages of beer alone?! No, you have not died and gone to Heaven; you just happened to wander into a place thriving with variety. Being that we stopped in for lunch, we stuck with sandwiches and the must-have lunch combo: a cup of soup and half a sandwich/pizza. Mom's chicken avocado sandwich was polished off with ease, Dad's... whatever Dad ate, was equally delicious, and my tortilla soup and pepperoni pizza were wolfed down in a shameful display almost as noticeable as my preference for hopping around the beer menu: Big Sky Moose Drool can totally give way to Kronenbourg 1664 if you try.\n\nAnd through it all Tasha managed the suffocating requests of her demanding table, a performance that would go unnoticed if you were not paying attention given that everyone working here is a study in quick service and attentiveness. Food runners actually running food? Hostesses navigating the dining room with purpose? Bartenders keeping their orders flowing? You'd better believe it. We did not see a manager but I am assuming one was on duty, probably sitting in the rafters like Batman/woman, waiting to pounce when the need makes itself known.\n\nThere was one last bit of unfinished business: dessert. I'll just say this now: order the s'more brownie item. It will change your life. As the owner and operator of a beard and mustache, it almost made me consider shaving them off due to me realizing hot marshmallow embedded into my hair is not the most glamorous feeling. But wow if that was not the best way to go into a sugar coma that I have had the pleasure of eating in quite a while.\n\nYes, Yard House is a chain and yes, you know what you're getting by eating at one. But this one in particular has service and set up down to an art form. More TVs than you could ever watch? Extensive seating? A prime location away from most of the touristy things? Absolutely. And believe the hype, too - until the owners build one of these in Dallas, TX (hint, hint), it will remain a \"must-go\" destination for any upcoming Las Vegas trips. Who am I kidding? Even after they build one in Dallas, TX (nudge, nudge), I'll still be stopping here."

I've been to this Yard House a bunch of times and their employees are always doing it right. When ever I have friends or family coming into town looking for a good eat with a reasonable price, this is the place to be.\n\nBut let's talk about food. Their food. OH GOSH THEIR FOOD. Believe the hype when people say that Yard House has some of the best foods you'll eat. Not to mention (pardon me for not being of legal drinking age just yet) that they have one of the largest selections of draft beers and alcoholic specials! I've had a few of their salads, a pizza or two, (the best) mac and cheese, and almost all of their appetizers and they are nothing shy of incredible. During their happy hour, they offer a bunch of specials such as $2 select drinks and half of select appetizers and pizzas, can't go wrong! My friends and I will normally come between classes for a huuuuge plate of their chicken nachos during happy hour.\n\nNeedless to say, Yard House takes the cake on food and service in my book."

Proof: I just went here two nights in a row. ;)\n\nMy friends and I went here after they finished their finals week. There is usually a line to get in, but it's only because they are checking IDs and giving you wristbands. The bouncers are pretty friendly, no elitism at this joint, no cover like at Blue Martini which is just upstairs.\n\nDrinks: I seriously think they sell the cheapest drinks at Vegas. I was able to get vodka tonics for just $5 each...seriously? I can get 3 for the price of ONE as compared to one of the pricey clubs on the strip. I didn't really eat a meal here, but I did nibble on my friend's bbq chicken salad, which was delicious. The alcohol I drank induced french fry cravings, so my friend and I split an order of their fries. The fries weren't the big thick fries you get normally, but they were still really good with ketchup and ranch dressing. The wait staff are very attentive and friendly, also very accommodating. We were in a large group on Friday, and they are not allowed to give separate checks, but she had no problem giving me one.\n\nMy only gripe about this place is that the music is REALLY loud as it gets later into the night and you have to basically shout across the table to hold any kind of conversation. It's also nearly impossible to find parking around Town Square on Fri and Sat nights, but I guess that comes with the territory. Also, it's kind of hard to walk in and get a table at peak hours, so I would recommend making a reservation for a larger group.\n\nIf you are looking for a good place to chill with friends, AND cheap cheap cheap drinks, this is DEFINITELY the place to go."

Fried perfectly and great dipping sauce.\n\nJambalaya was pretty spicy.  You have your choice of pasta, jasmine rice or brown rice. Comes with peppers, sausage, crawfish, and some giant grilled prawns. I stuck with the pasta. It was tasty.

I don't really even like mushrooms but I was a member of the clean plate club here! My husband got some garlic noodles and they were amazing!

We drove past the Yard House twice because the main entrance is not on one of the streets.  And when it is 105 degrees out, you really don't want to wander around on foot."

An almost overwhelming variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and even chicken-substitute options among other choices were appealing to my group. \nWhen we arrived at about 6.30 on a Sunday night, there was a very long line which made me wish I had called ahead. However, we were seated within 10 minutes.\nOur waiter clearly did not think that our 24-and-under table would tip well, a tendency that bothers me since I always tip generously for good service. He was rude and abrupt, especially when we declined to order alcohol. He even took my menu away before I was done ordering. \nThe food was brought out by a different server, and a pleasant smile and the shocking addition of a few kind words were a breath of fresh air from our server, who was anything but courteous. \nThe food itself was stellar. One companion had a grilled burger, which had excellent flavor; my sister had the vodka pasta, which was also delicious. My shrimp lettuce wraps were good, but tricky to put together and eat - I wouldn't order that on a first date or business meeting!\nOverall: great ambiance and location, terrible service, and awesome food!"

It's just not a great place. Everything is pretty solid. But nothing is exceptional.\n\nThe bartenders are very nice and helpful. They will give you a free sample taste of any of the draft beers. And it's a decent list of beers.\n\nThe service has always been good. Even when it is crowded and very busy, we've never had any issues with the service here.\n\nOne of my favorite go-to items on the menu is the bernaise sliders. The sliders themselves are very good. Good burgers and good buns. The bernaise sauce comes on the side. It is definitely not your standard bernaise sauce and would never hold up on a steak. But on a burger, this particular bernaise is delicious. The shoestring fries that come on the side are also great. Just the right amount of crispiness and salt.\n\nThe pizzas have also always been pretty good. Along with most of their menu items.\n\nThe wings, though, have been somewhat of a let-down. They are your typical cheap tavern wings, except they aren't cheap. Poor quality meat and not that meaty. The firecracker wings have a great sauce. Very saucy and flavorful. The buffalo wings, though, while there is a decent flavor to the sauce, is a very oily sauce. The ranch dipping sauce is well above average and pairs nicely with the wings.\n\nThe atmosphere is ok. The space and decor works. It's definitely a family-friendly place, often filled with strollers and small children. The bar area can be quite full during happy hour. Seems to be popular with both tourists and locals alike.\n\nIf you are expecting culinary greatness, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a decent lunch or dinner after a couple of hours of shopping or before hitting a movie, this place will hit the spot. And the happy hour deals are great."

Still it took 15 minutes for our waters to come out.\n\nI guess I'm a little bit of a health freak and when I eat things I think about all the good things and bad things of the food for my body.

They have about 150 different beers on tap which is impressive. I sat at the bar and had one of the beers on tap. After looking thru their extensive beer menu, I ordered the Sin City Light; it was good. It's about $6 for a beer. So for the most part, the bar is what makes the place; along with all the flat screen TVs mounted throughout.\n\nAs a restaurant...they need A LOT of work. I ordered the Roast Beef Dip. A simple dish (it's a sandwich for crying out loud), how can anyone get that wrong...Au Jus was too salty. That's what makes the sandwich! Also, they need to melt the provolone in the sandwich. They just slapped on a cold piece of cheese! One of my friends had the Porter House Steak. She had ordered it medium, but she realized as she was cutting into the steak that it was a little on the rare side. Once she pointed that out to our non-attentive waiter, he did take the steak back and correct it. The manager even brought it back out to her and apologized for that and did not charge for her entree. That was nice of him... My cousin had the lettuce wraps. I didn't try them, but he says that the wraps were really good. My brother had the Ahi salad. He liked it. The prices on their food menu are comparable to that of a Chilis or Chevy's.\n\nNow about our waiter...Seems like he was trying to avoid us the whole time we were there. The sad thing is that he was also training someone on the floor that night; what a good example he is setting for the trainee! We had to wave him down a couple of times for drinks and a couple times for condiments. Come to think of it, we didn't even get place settings until after our food arrived. We had to ask another waiter for that! He only came by to check on us once, and that was the same time he slapped us the bill."

It's probably one of the biggest and famous chain of restaurant slash bar slash sports bars I know of. They're not really known for anything else but the different draft beers that they serve here but since I don't drink alcohol, I wouldn't be very helpful in that department. The atmosphere right when you walk-in is of most restaurants similar to BJ's or Alehouse. You'll find your singles at the bar watching sports, the flock of females in booths wooing loudly because they're in Vegas or locals that are pretending they're tourists and still wooing loudly aka Woo Girls (c) How I Met Your Mother. And sometimes, you'll catch the party of 15 or more in the middle of the room trying to celebrate or have dinner with friends. That's us.\n\nYard House is pretty good about taking care of large groups. We celebrated my brother's birthday here and their service wasn't memorae but it wasn't horrible. They took our orders, gave us our food, checked on us to refill drinks, gave the check, and thanked us for coming in. Nothing out of the ordinary though. The happy hour menu (Sunday-Wednesday, 10pm-close) has a wide range of different eats! I highly recommend the garlic noodles, sliders with Bernaise sauce on the side, and the chicken wings! Superb! For something not on the happy hour is the New York steak salad. I'm not too sure how I feel about red meat on a salad because it's kind of a culinary oxymoron, but the way Yard House throws it together leaves me with some belief that there are chefs and cooks that know what they're doing in the kitchen! Comforting isn't it? \n\nLast notes: Call ahead if you have large groups. The weekends are extremely busy!"

The Kitchen's game is alway on! Kudos guys! Beer prices are a little steep for me even during happy hour I don't like paying $6 for a beer when a six pack at Lee's is $11. But overall great place.

I guess it depends what you order, the burgers and sandwiches come with a side, but not sure about other items. My sandwich was AMAZING. I did add avocado to it too! I was stuffed at the end and it wasn't a healthy meal but it wasn't heavy either. I'd definitely go back.

She was polite enough but i saw her about 3 times the entire 2.5 hours we were dining. I could be wrong but I think she was handling 2 sections which is why the service was so slow. If my instinct is correct then management needs to set their staff up for success and not failure. If I'm incorrect then service needs serious work. It shouldn't take 15 minutes to get a beer and 2 shots."

We were seated quickly though and our server, Kerry G, arrived quickly and was very personable and quick to come back to us for ordering.  My girlfriend got a cheeseburger and fries and the Hawaiian Five O drink, I got the vampire tacos dish and asked for no guacamole, and we split an order of boneless buffalo wings.\n\nThe wings came pretty quick and our server even brought over some extra ranch.  As far as the taste goes, they were OK.  Not the best I've had and not the worst.  The sauce was decent but with only a burst of heat up front and I'm not quite a fan of either the breading or how they fried them -- not sure which.  My girlfriend really liked her Hawaiian Five O drink.\n\nThen began a long wait for our entrees.  We noted that a table of 4 right next to us ordered at the same time and got their food far before us.  A few minutes after they got their food Kerry came over to us and told us our food was cooking and would be out soon, then asked if we were in any type of time crunch.  We said no, thinking we still had 40 minutes to make a movie at the AMC theater upstairs.\n\n10 minutes or so after this our food finally arrived and Kerry noted that they had tried to give him the tacos with guacamole on it.  I surmise they made the order wrong the first time and he just never told us about it until then.\n\nMy girlfriend liked her burger but didn't care for the fries.  I tried them and thought they were pretty good, however.  My tacos were very ho-hum.  They were carnitas and bacon chorizo with cilantro in a cheese-crusted taco shell.  Cilantro dominated the tacos, however, and I could barely taste the carnitas and only got one bite where I clearly detected the bacon chorizo.  The rice on the side was the best part of the meal -- a good portion of it, slightly sweet and spicy.  Something I've never really had with tacos but it was good.  The beans were very bland and a surprisingly small portion.\n\nKerry came to check on us again, but at the end of the meal we ended up waiting at least 10 minutes for the check while Kerry was in the vicinity and I met his eyes several times.  Even after he finally came over and we told him we wanted the check it took another 3 or 4 minutes to get it.  Finally we were able to pay and leave but it was over an hour after we first arrived and we missed the showtime for the movie.\n\nGood service at the start, bad service at the end, and food that ranged from average to bleh."

The food was good the first time -- it's expensive for what it is, but what can you expect being in the middle of Town Square.\n\nThe first time, things went okay. It was a weekend, but an off-hour, so the place wasn't very busy. Service was fine. Food was pretty good.\n\nThe latest time, it was an entirely different story. My sister and I decided to go there and ended up being there at the same time as a wedding reception. Not a big deal; we choose to sit outside under the heater and enjoy the early evening weather. My sister gets a beer, I get a soda, standard stuff. Service is slow, but not terrible.\n\nThen we order.\n\nMy sister and I eventually run out of conversation topics. I get a refill after a long wait, she gets another beer. I look down at my phone and it's been basically half an hour since we ordered -- WTF? No information at all.\n\nEventually our server finally tells us what happened -- My sister's food got picked up by someone and given to the wedding reception guests!! They have had to start her order over entirely. Two refills and another half hour later, they finally bring it out.\n\nMy food is luke-warm and uninspiring, while hers is okay. It is nothing to write home about, especially for the price paid. We ask if we are getting any sort of consolation for having to wait over an hour for our food.\n\nThe manager decides that the employee discount is fine, which amounts to /less than one of the beers/ off of our ticket (which had two meals, two beers, and one drink). For having to wait nearly an hour for what we ordered. I could understand if there was some complaining, like \"Oh, our order came out on time but there was some trivial thing wrong\", but this was entirely on them, both the delay in telling us what happened and the delay in fixing it.\n\nNot going back again. The slow service, overpriced and under-delivered food, and insanely lame fix for their mess up put me off forever. There are better places to go without wandering through Town Square."

A lady walked up with another unwelcoming look on her face I approached her in regards to speaking with a manager.

My group got there at 4:45 and racked up most of the damage before HH ended, but the last few items boosted the check up by a third. \n\nThe well drinks run for four dollars and change, while the beers cost around four to six dollars. All the appetizers are half off and a great deal. If you are like me, a few of them makes for a better meal than any entree. \n\nWe got the chicken nachos, fried chicken strips, seared ahi, classic sliders, hummus, a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, and chicken wings. If you come during the designated time, then all of these except the hummus are half off. It is a great deal, but I would reconsider if it was at full price. They are generous with their portions. Both the sliders and chicken strips come in an order of four with fries. This was perfect because it matched the number of people at our table. Both dishes would be worth it at the regular price. The ahi tuna was cooked nicely, but the sauce was too salty. It definitely did not need soy sauce, but I used up all the wasabi. The chicken nachos were nothing special. It is a generous portion, but the salsa looked more like marinara, the chicken was on the dry side, and the guacamole lacked the tang and spice. They were also bountiful with the wings. Asking for them to be cooked extra crispy and having the sauce on the side guarantees for perfect wings. The hummus was packed with sodium and tasted a little bitter. The pizza came out quick, bubbling, and beautiful. Too bad, I was too full by that time, but my friend liked it.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to try a new beer, but afraid you might not like it, come for happy hour. At worst, you are out a few dollars. At best, you might meet your new best friend. \n\nAnother thing worth mentioning, the staff were on their game tonight. It was not that busy, but our server was awesome. Crystal was funny, sassy, and full of energy. \n\nThe only reason why I gave them three stars is because I worry about the amount of salt they use in all of their dishes. I know people complain about MSG at Chinese restaurant, but I drank five glasses of water while dining and am still guzzling it now. It was tasty, but my taste buds are on over drive and going nuts."

The outdoor seating wraps around the outer perimeter of the restaurant, so if you don't mind sitting in 100 degree heat, there are patio options as well.\nThe HH rocks. Great food specials and beer and wine specials. We sampled quite a few of the appetizers and they were pretty tasty. \nFor Vegas, it's hard to find a place that's not sooo overpriced you can't get a snack for a reasonable price. You must know me to know how important snacks are :) \nThe servers were cool. The atmosphere was OK.

Happy hour features half priced appetizers, $2 off glasses of wine, and $4-5 beer. Since I never know what kind of beer to get, I looked at the menu until something sounded good...Ok, I'll have a Spaten Oktoberfest...isn't this beer only seasonal though? \n\nWe ordered some appetizers to share: onion ring tower, spicy tuna roll, bernaise sliders w/ fries, and chicken lettuce wraps. Our favorite were the lettuce wraps, where the chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauces provided went well with it, especially the sweet and sour that had a little kick to it. The onion rings were a little over cooked and brown/over crispy but were still ok, especially when dipped in ranch. The sliders are always delicious, topped with fried onion strings and 1 of my favorite items on their menu. I didn't have the spicy tuna roll since I don't eat fish so I can't comment on that dish.\n\nYard House is one of my favorite places to grab a drink or hang with friends, especially this one since it's located right in Town Square and near the movie theater, making it a good place to drink before catching a movie. They also have a large number of TVs, so it's a good place to catch a game although I'm never on this side of town on football Sundays...They also have plenty of patio seating which is perfect on those spring and summer nights"

With over 100+ beers on tap I am sure you will find something that ya like. \n\nI strongly recommend coming in during happy hour. Weekdays from 3-7 and 10-close (except for Fridays) means almost all of their appetizers are half off, on top of that, they have $7 sliders, and cheap pizzas as well. The classic rock and continuously flowing drinks make this place a perfect place to hang out and chill if you want to go out with friends.\n\nThe food here is usually a step above the bar food found at similar establishments. Yes they do have nachos, pizza, but they have more adventurous fare such as hummus and pita, double stacked chicken enchiladas, tuna tar tar, and so on. I will give them props for food that you wouldn't think they would. But the thing that makes this place amazing, like a few other fellow yelpers mentioned is the... TURKEY BURGER! I don't know what they do to they turkey, but they make it delicious. Succulent turkey paired with herbs, cheeses and thin slithers of roma tomatoes make this one of the best turkey burgers I have had. Definitely give it a try.\n\nOf course one of the coolest things about all Yardhouses is what I call the keg exhibition. Ever Yardhouse has a large room where they store the 100+ kegs in cold ice-cold fridge. Large windows allow pass-er-bys to gawk at the beauties. \n\nThe location in Town Square is similar to the other ones around the country. A standard restaurant space consisting of booths and tables. A large central bar in the middle, and a ton of pipes which make the draft beers possible."

Perhaps you will agree with some of them. \n- there are no decent drink prices. Beer is expensive, wine is moderately priced, cocktails are absurd \n- mu Shu egg rolls taste like cat food \n- tuna poke has huge chunks of sometimes tough tuna\n- summer salad was nice with clementines and strawberries\n- I do like the selection of videos they play on tv and the music is general good too\n- service is always decent \n- French onion soup is mediocre at best."

He took our beer flight orders, our apps and main course orders at the same time. Our appetizers came to the table minutes before our beer orders. The food here is always good as is the beer. For our main course we ordered the fried gnocchi. I'm certain it's a good dish, it was probably just something neither of us liked.  We decided that we weren't going to take it home but had no problem paying for it. When Cebal brought our check he told us that he would take the gnocchi off our check. Wasn't expecting that. We will be back as we have had some great food. Great beer and great service."

Great service and great food!   \n\nThis is a great place to get lunch if you have some extra time during your lunch break or if its your day off.  Pretty mellow atmosphere during the day, gets pretty busy during the evenings.  \n\nBefore our friend arrived we told the waitress that it was her birthday and asked if at some point towards the end of the meal we could get some kind of little birthday dessert brought out. She delivered on that towards the end of the meal, no charge.    She was a great waitress in every other aspect of our meal as well.  Made it such a great experience.\n\nThe food was pretty good as well, especially the lettuce wraps. There were no complaints from anyone at the table about the food, there was praise all around.  Best part was it was a pretty cheap meal for 3 people, at least cheaper than i expected it to be and that's always a pleasant surprise. \n\nThis is definitely my favorite Yardhouse out of all the ones in the Las Vegas area.  Will have to go here again when we get the chance to visit Vegas again since we now live in Utah."

We would always order the same thing, The happy hour specials. Its too many items to name but you can look it up and see what it is(Pizza, onion rings, sliders, poke, calamari, fries, etc). All of the items were very good and I would say the Bernaise sliders are my absolute favorite. Some would say they are pretty basic, which I agree, they are. But its the mild yogurt-based dipping sauce that they serve with it that gives me an O-Face everytime I take a bite. Im a slider expert and I dont know about yall, but I like my sliders basic(beef, cheese, onions). None of that foie gras, pork belly, cilantro leaves crap. Keep it simple stupid!! I would also always order the same drink, a St Bernardus 13(14% alcohol, yeah buddy!!!) Cant wait to go back, probably wont be for while since monster-in-law and her boy toy broke up. We'll see tho."

I often frequent this place with friends or bring out of town guests here because the menu is extensive and there is something on it for just about everyone. Plus the beer selection, as well as the wine, and mixed drinks have the ability to please every palate. \n\nRecently I brought my sister and brother-in-law here based off of those facts. Three people with probably rather different tastes is kind of a hard combo to deal with when choosing a dining spot. Luckily, Yard House did the trick. \n\nThere was a wait when we arrived, but it was only about 10 minutes and we were seated in a large, comfy booth, although next to the kitchen and a bit noisy, it was okay as we could all still carry on a conversation without yelling to be heard. \n\nThe run down of the food went as following -\n\nGrilled Artichoke Appetizer - delicious! The artichoke was grilled perfectly and served with a garlic dipping sauce. We ate every bite and then tried to eat more. Baked potato chips were also served with it, the perfect appetizer.\n\nSeared Ahi Steak Sandwich - Okay, this was just about the best thing I've had to eat in a LONG time. The ahi was seared perfectly, somewhat cooked around the outside, and deliciously raw on the inside. The pairings in the sandwich were perfect- spinach, Swiss cheese, tomato, and caramelized onions. It comes on a rye bread and with shoe-string french fries. Honestly, this sandwich is worth every penny. \n\nCuban Roast Pork Dip - My sister ordered this sandwich and it looked very good. It came with a BBQ au jus and shoe-string french fries. \n\nHouse Salad & Clam Chowder - My brother-in-law opted for this. The soup came out piping hot and he said it was really good. My sister declared it to be good too. The house salad was BIG, much bigger than I was expecting, so kudos to YH on the portions. \n\nOverall I have to give it up to Yard House. This most recent visit was definitely a 5 star affair. Everything was cooked well, service was good, the wait wasn't long, the noise level was decent, and  we were in and out with zero problems."

Yard House has a phenominal number of beers to sample on any given night including some local brews as from Sin City Brewery (my fav 7 years running) and Tenaya Creek. I ordered an Anderson Valley Boont Amber from NorCal before I saw the Sin City beers. No worries though. The hops in this California style amber went well with my dinner. I ordered a black truffle chesse burger. Freshly grilled and topped with gooey truffle cheese and onion bacon jam, this burger was some rich pub fare. The bitter hop notes of the beer cut through that richness. My only complaint was the size of the burger. I think I can get a bigger burger at Carl's Jr but it wouldn't taste so good. Luckily there were enough fries to make up the difference. Lovely little shoestrings that took to ketchup real well. \n\nOther fare ordered on this particular night were average fish and chips with the unique jalapeno tartar sauce and garlic aioli, a roast beef sandwich and jambalaya with pasta in place of rice. I tried the fish and a bite of sausage from the jambalaya. My favorite part of any of it was the garlic aioli for the fish but that stuff would be good on just about anything.\n\nIt was very loud in Yard House.  The music was loud which is fine by me especially given the classic rock sounds they were pumping out but it was difficult to hear my family over the sound of music. Not to mention the place was packed so we were talking over the couple hundred other people in there too. Despite the noise, the food was good and service was adequate. I will be back."

It's delicious art). They are must orders. We ate every bite. They service was pretty good at the bar, but that's because we went on a slow night. I will come back again and I need to have some of those beers. Then I can give it 5 stars, maybe :-)"

The drinks are reasonably priced.\n\nHappy hour is M-F 3-6 PM, and Sun-Wed 10PM-1AM where a lot of their dishes are in the $5-8 range and drinks are even more reasonably priced.\n\nI always go with friends and try a variety of their dishes. Their ahi poke bowl is decent although there are probably better poke places around Vegas, but it's decent for a bar. Thei fried calamari is always on point. I can never complain about good calamari. I've tried some of their lettuce wraps and they're all pretty good. If you're watching your sodium intake, some of their seasoned meats can tip you over the edge if you're not careful.\n\nThey have a wide selection of drinks available and I have a good time trying out different brews.\n\nTheir staff is friendly and mostly attentive although they can become forgetful if business becomes busy. However their staff should take their breaks away from public since some of their staff become rowdy when on break in front of the restaurant.\n\nOverall the Yard House at Town Square is a good experience and you won't be disappointed to hang out with friends there."

We didn't feel welcomed she'd  roll her eyes every time we asked her something. You can tell she just wanted to get out of there. You know most servers ask \"how's your night going?\", \"what brings you in tonight?\" Or s a simple welcome my name is..... She asked for our drink orders right when I looked up from looking at the menu she was gone I guess we took to long for her. When we got our food she didn't being bring us cutlery, not ketchup, napkins or asked if we needed anything for our meals. I guess I'm suppose to eat my rice and beans with my hands. We asked three different people that walked by our table if they can get it for us of course they said yes but never came back. She finally showed up and brought us some 5-10 minutes later. I understand it's busy but if your working for tips you'd think you'd put some effort into giving A+ that would've been better instead of getting treated like shit. We wanted to go catch the movie but again she was no where to be found finally brought the bill and left right away so we went to the front cause we wanted to leave already the hostess said you have to give it to the server so we saw a guy with a white shirt not sure if he was the manager he took it said the server will take care of it. When she gave it to us guess what she disappeared again so we asked if the hostess can take the check book she said you have to give it to your server I asked can't you take it it's empty mind you she was leaning on the counter talking to the other 2 host I guess if she would've grabbed it the counter would've fell because she wasn't leaning on it. If you want to get treated like shit definitely come here. If you want amazing service go elsewhere cause you won't get that here. I wish I can give them a 0 They don't even deserve a 1."

Let me tell you about when I gave it a 1.\n\nWe go there, wait an hour right in front of the booth with three attendants (who have had a clear view of us the entire time). After the one hour mark (they quoted 35 minutes) I politely walked up and ask what the deal was. \n\nThey then inform me that they activated the little beeper they gave us and no one answered it. (remember we are sitting 4 feet away from them the whole time) \nThey then proceeded to seat what looked like 10-12 parties ahead of us (from the crossed out names I saw on the waiting list)\nOK no big deal mistakes happen and it's hard to find good help.\n\nWe get to our table. Order some beers. The waitress can't figure out if she is able to use my friend's passport as a legal ID... I mean, my friend is obviously over 21; in fact she is nearly 40, but again no big deal, she leaves and comes back at best 7 minutes later with a manager approval.  We then order our beers and our food. \nIt takes 20 minutes just to get our drinks. This is just silly because I know they have only 4-5 table sections.  \n\nSo the beer comes and I did check my watch, it took about 40 minutes to get our food.  The food my girlfriend and our mutual friend ordered came out looking and tasting good, but mine... a simple burger..  came out burnt when I ordered it medium rare. I made a small comment about it and initially refused to have it remade because of time restraints and not wanting to wait another 40 minutes. I then realized it had some ingredients that I asked not to be put in the food. The waitress assured me it would only take ten minutes at best so I conceded to have it remade.\nWell another 30 minutes goes by and my table mates are done eating and I'm sitting around waiting for a burger that finally arrives... BURNT again.  So wtf.  The manager comes to talk to us for the 2nd time and clearly must be high. It went something like this\nManager walks up... and says;\n\n\"oh Man I'm sorry, dang I hate it when that happens to me... ahh *sigh* wow that totally sucks\"\n\nThen; proceeds to just stand there looking upset about my burger until we had to basically console her about it!! \n\n\"ah no worries it's not that big of a deal\"  \n\nLOL oh man. So they did infact comp the burger. But hell for a 14 dollar burger you would think you could get it cooked right.\nI have had good experiences at yard house too btw. But DAMN WTF"

We were deciding on what place to eat in Town Square and found that this place had the best menu. \n\nAmbiance: 5 - This place had a good energy all around. The host greeted us and was helpful by explaining the happy hour menu. In the center of the restaurant is a bar and all around the room are TVs playing sports. At sunset, they added tea light candles to each table and I thought it had a very nice touch. I highly recommend going to this place if you're looking to watch a game or to have a date night here.\n\nService: 5 - If I could give higher stars than a 5 I would! Our waiter was incredibly helpful when we were ordering. There were times when it would take a while to get our food but he would make sure that we got our food hot and ready. I definitely would want to have him as my waiter the next time I eat there, if only I could remember his name haha. \n\nFood: 4 - I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and parmesan truffle fries. The Hawaiian pizza was a pretty large size and I was really satisfied with it. The only thing I didn't like about the pizza was it was very thin crust and soggy. I like to have my crust a little fluffy and if I do order thin crust I would like for the bread to have a crisp/crunch to it. The truffle fries were heaven!!! The portion was pretty decent and definitely worth paying for. It wasn't too oily, it had a little crunch, and the parmesan was added just right. I highly recommend ordering the truffle fries!\n\nThe next time i'm hungry at Town Square, I will definitely visit this place during happy hour. Great food for an amazing price!"

The wait was fine, and we were seated a nice corner booth. The young lady who sat me was super friendly and attentive. Once my buddy arrived, we had to wait far longer then usual for our waitress to grab drink orders and refills (which were beers). \n\nThe calamari appetizer was on point. I ordered carnitas and pork belly tacos, which comes with a side of rice and beans. When the food arrived, it was cold and I was to hungry to send it back. The carnitas taco was flavorful, but the pork belly (which was a micro portion of meat) was bland, and the fatty part was not crispy, which is how I've always had pork belly served. Couple that with being cold, and I spit the fat out into the napkin. Gross. Maybe the pork belly bao at Fat Choy restaurant has ruined me when it comes to pork belly. \n\nMy buddies fish & chips were good, with a healthy serving of fries. I hope the food issue was just a bad night for Yardhouse. In the past, I've always enjoyed the food. I hope they get it fixed, especially with all the close by competition in Town Square. Cheers!"

The Yard House is a fun place for groups of friends to hang out over beer and good food. The restaurant does a commendable job accommodating large groups. Both times that I went to the Yard House we had no problem getting a large table. The service is precise. And when it is time to pay, we had our own checks. Substitute Yelpers for a gathering of general friends, or a date and the Yard House is everybody's social house.\n\n  The Yard House is my choice chain restaurant for beer selection. The Yard House is to beer what Baskin Robbins is to ice cream. Whereas Baskin Robbins features 31 flavors of ice cream,, the Yard House features approximately 600 flavors of beer (I counted the beer listed in the menu). If I were to go to the Yard House one Friday a week to order a flavor of beer, according to my math it would take me 12 years to done this. Or if I were to go to the Yard House everyday to try a flavor of beer, it would take me 2 years to do this. Some of the beers may have been listed under a couple of different headings. The deal is that the Yard House selection of beer is as good as it gets. \n\n  There are eleven series of beer. There is the chalkboard series. The cider series is the seasonals. The light beer is less than 5.8% alcohol content. This series includes many of the name brands such as Michelob and Budweiser. There is the Honey Fruit series which includes BBC Strawberry Blonde and Blue Point Blueberry. There is the wheat series that includes Blue Hawaiin Hefeweizen. The Malty series includes Bass Ale and Alaskin Amber. The Dark series includes Big Sky Moose Drool and Bison Organic Chocolate. The bitter series includes Anchor Liberty and Blue Point Hoptical Illusion. And there is the Strong and Effervescent series. The menu lists the alcohol content. Unless I overlooked something, the Allagash Curieux is the strongest at 11% alcohol content. There are three sizes of beer. I went for the middle size which is the pint. For the record I greatly appreciated the Firestone.\n\n  This very Yard House features a Happy Hour and Late Night Specials. The Happy Hour is Monday-Friday 3-6 pm and Late Night Special Sunday-Wednesday 10-close. They include domestic pints from $4.25-$5.75, well drinks $4.27-$4.75 and wine by glass $2 off. If you are up to food there are half price appetizers & pizza.\n\n  The food is good but I've tasted better. My complaint about the roasted turkey club is that it was layers of sandwich instead of the sandwich I am accustomed to. The classic cheeseburger was a good choice. The fries are these skinny things that remind me of potato sticks. I feel that the Yard House ought to expand their fries selection to include steak fries and just thicker fries.\n\n  When I socialize at a restaurant, I am big on the music that is playing. I was won over by the music playing. I heard great music from Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones and classic rock era.\n\n  The Yard House excells at their selection of beer. Whether it is my Yelp House or social House I intend to return. When I return I plan to try the Blue Point Blueberry beer that is brewed in Blue Point, NY; 5 miles south of where I lived. Gotta be patriotic to my home town.\n\nDaniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 72"

It was extremely noisy, not sure if that's normal for this place but it makes it difficult to have a conversation. We had to request silverware settings when our meal came so we had something to eat with as apparently no one recognized we didn't have any. My daughter ordered a club sandwich and was surprised that the cheese wasn't even melted. My roast beef dip was nasty. The bun was just barely bigger than a hotdog bun, it was completely soggy on the bottom and the meat was luke warm at best and lacked flavor. I ended up just sending it back. Most likely wont be going back to this restaurant any time soon."

Good parking and an easy walk from the back parking lots of Town Square.\n\nThe service here is superb! We ordered a Hefe-weizen and they said it would take a minute to switch taps. We got it right away. To have a local place that has German beer on tap is pretty awesome.\n\nThe food is fantastic too, I've never had a bad dish. On my last visit, we shared the Queso dip. It was pretty ooey-gooey and very delish. I think it needed more chips though, we kind of ran out and started piling on the queso towards the end.  I think I heard my arteries screaming \"For the love of God, not all at once! \" \n\nFor my main dish, I ordered the miso sea bass with bokchoy and brown rice. I'm a huge fan of miso fish dishes after trying the miso cod at Nobu in 2009. So the miso sea bass at YH is one of my favorites. The sweetness and the freshness of the fish was impressive. I also prefer brown rice, so having it as an alternative over white rice is always a plus.\n\nYay for Yard House!"

            "review": "I'd been avoiding Yard House ever since a failed attempt at the Red Rock location: long lines, extra-loud music, spillover crowds, and a \"more here to be seen than to eat\" kind of vibe. There's nothing wrong with a busy, happy, trendy place, of course, especially one advertising more beers than anywhere else in the world, but it's not for boring old me.\n\nBut, the menu we'd perused online looked so different and interesting (at least for vegetarians) that I had to give in when my husband pushed for a visit before going to see a movie at Rave. Put anything in Town Square and I'll probably visit it at least once.\n\nEven though it was busy and the music was indeed cranked up, it was my kind of music (classic rock), and the space between tables meant we didn't have to feel like we should introduce ourselves to the family at the next table. \n\nWe had two servers during our meal (our first one went on break), and both were as enthusiastic as they were thorough, which is to say amply both. As I ordered, I was pleasantly asked if I'd like my salad dressing on the side, if I was a vegan (so the order could be adjusted if necessary), and - be still my heart - if I was fine with the veggie burger I ordered being a Gardein burger. Seldom do I know what I'm going to get when I order a vegetarian burger. It could be a nuked black-bean patty, it could be a homemade concoction starring bulgur and carrots, or it could be the most dreaded possibility of all: the tasteless Boca puck.\n\nOr it could be the best veggie burger in Las Vegas, which is what I was served at Yard House. Oh boy!\n\nI can't claim it will be the best for every vegetarian. Some people like a strong faux-meat experience, and others want the opposite. I like anything with a traditional burger texture and some kind of spicy flavour with a lot of \"umami\" - fullness, and that's what I got. I went with the potato bun. Fresh, but very squishy. I may try the wheat bun next time.\n\nBut before this we'd already been charmed by the appetizers. The Onion Ring Tower - as tall as its name implies - kept luring my fingers back. The rings were crispy but not greasy, with a dust of Parmesan over all.\n\nThrought the meal our lemonades kept coming, each free refill with a ring of sugar around the rim. Okay. We were *definitely* putting Yard House on the short list for sure things.\n\nAnd, open until 2 a.m.? What was this? And it's a full menu until 2 a.m.? That entire page of Gardein vegetarian items - wings, sliders, thai pizza, sandwiches - plus everything else on the near-novella of a menu is available after most restaurants pack up for the night? And they have half-priced pizzas and appetizers not only during regular happy hour, but also after 10 p.m. (Sunday-Wednesday)? Squeal!"

After thinking it over for about a week, we decided to go to the Yard House at Town Center.  Now, I have been to a couple of Yard Houses in So. Cal. and I liked the idea.  So, I called and made a reservation for the 10 of us.  Here is my experience:\n\nLike I stated before, I called to make a reservation.  And, I talked to Bo, one of the managers.  He was extremely helpful as I told him my needs.  Which were, a table to fit all of us and a T.V. to watch the game.  He hooked us up and explained up front that there was to be an 18% automatic gratuity added to our bill.  Which is policy for groups over 7.  We were fine with that as I'm sure we tipped out more.\n\nOur waiter and waitress were awesome.. they were friendly, attentive and speedy.  I should have gotten their names but, I forgot.  They truly made the night.  \n\nI saw food and drinks come out and everything looked good.  I don't think that anyone had any problems.  I can only comment on the Pizza and beer that I ordered.  I was really happy with my order.  I can't complain at all.\n\nSo, I give Yard House 5 stars because we all had a great night with great service, great drinks, great food and even better company.\n\nSide note: The Angels won! and that was just the icing on the cake."

Appetizers were 1/2 off, as well as beer/martinis. I tried the Pomegranate Martini, which was excellent! I love pom juice, and this drink didn't make my face squint. I couldn't even taste the alcohol! By the end of the night, I had my Asian glow face after a few sips from my glass. GEEZ! It was that good!\n\nFor appetizers, my friends and I had an array of different foods: blue crab cakes, ham and pineapple pizza, firecracker wings, buffalo wings, chicken lettuce wrap, garlic noodles, sliders, and spicy tuna roll. All of the appetizers were pretty good.\n\nI was also able to try their Raspberry beer, Lindemans Framboise. It was mighty tasty, and again tasted like juice. I also found out you can make floats out of the draft beers. Maybe the chocolate stout with vanilla ice cream? YUM!\n\nI definitely would come back here and bring another group of friends. \n\nBTW, you can call ahead Thurs-Sun to get a table."

Served with celery sticks and ranch.\nChicken lettuce wraps- Healthy and crunchy. They give you about 5 or 6 lettuce cups and three different sauces. So the flavor choice is all up to you!\nCalifornia roll- Don't be fooled by it being just \"one\" California roll, but it's HUGE. It's a jumbo California roll!\nCalamari- Crispy and cooked perfectly! Squeeze some lemons and dip it in the spicy tomato sauce and it is TO DIE FOR.\nSpinach dip- Delicious!! Comes with chips. And it's A LOT.\nClassic sliders- Comes with 4 mini sliders. They give you mustard and ketchup bottles. It comes with a pickle slice and fries. The fries are skinny, crispy, and leave you wanting more!\nAhi poke- Though it could be a little bigger of a portion, it's really tasty.\nOnion tower- They stack a huge tower of onions, fresh to eat!\n\nI've been coming to Yard House forever now and they always have great service and good quality food for their prices."

Not the best service every time but overall no major complaints. \n\nLove their happy hour menu, delicious food, great portion and for cheaper. \nNachos, huge portion and delicious, perfect for sharing. Loaded with bean, cheese, chicken, jalepeno, sour cream, pico, guac... the goods!! \nShitake Garlic Noodle - smaller portion, good for one - very good.. not crazy garlicky. \nHummus - they have a chili oil type on top that adds such great flavor to the hummus, but not spicy at all. \nFried Calamari is delicious - decent portion, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, the aioli that it comes with is delicious. \nABSOLUTE FAV: Firecracker wings - these have a little kick to them, salty and sweet at the same time - great flavors - a must try!\nChicken Lettuce Wrap - pretty big portion, good for sharing - 3 options for sauce - all very good!\nThe Seared Ahi sandwich is so good.. I'm usually not a sandwich person but I will eat this one any day. \nMac & Cheese - not for kids - truffle oil and wild mushroom - so good...\n\nI can go on and on and on because I have tried most of the items on their menu - but these are the ones I always go back to!"

Happy Hour half off appetizers and drinks after 10pm, Say What?!\n\nLast night, I joined two of my friends at the Yard House to celebrate one of their birthdays.  I've eaten at the Yard House many o' times  and love the beer choices.  The experience/food is not the worst, but it's not the best.  It's great for happy hour and I'm sticking to that!\n\nFor drinks, I just got the Fat Tire pint for about $5.  Although I appreciate the 130+ beer choices, I'm partial to my Fat Tire/Newcastle beers.  For food, we got a few appetizers which were all half off:  First, the  Jamaican Jerk style boneless wings.  Came with a sweet hoisin type dipping sauce. The chicken was tender and the batter was delightful.  Next, we had Moo Shu egg rolls-chicken, chili cream cheese, carrots, green onions, cilantro, spinach with apple ginger plum sauce.  The chicken was a little dry but was redeemed with the sweet plum sauce.  Lastly, we got the chicken nachos-spicy pinto beans, cheddar, jack, red & green sauce, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole, sour cream.  It's a huge serving, but just your average bar nachos.  The cheese was a little hard.\n\nI did appreciate the great service that night.  The manager came over a few times, because a drunk lady invited herself on our table and then asked for us to pay her bar tab.  She was a little loud but somewhat funny.  Our server was cordial, but not to impressionable.  \n\nThe Happy Hour will continue bringing me back to the Yard House.  It isn't busy and we got a table right away.  There's typically a younger crowd which offers a hip vibe in my opinion.  Let's just say that overall, I wouldn't necessarily wait longer than 15 minutes for a table unless you're crazy about beer."

I have been to Yardhouse before in a few other cities, but had a friend tell me last week about their vegetarian menu.\n\nThey use a meat substitute called gardein and it can be used in any of their dishes but they even have a section of the menu devoted to all of their vegetarian dishes. I decided to choose the chicken & veggie bowl with jasmine rice.. I expected it to be like a teriyaki sauce, but I have to admit that was my own assumption... In spite of not being sweet like I expected, it was a very delicious meal that I thoroughly enjoyed. My friend ordered the veggie chicken strips with a side of sweet potato fries. Of course I had to try this and I have to admit I would have loved to have ordered those too...\n\nI think this is going to be another one of my new spots to frequent as it can totally fit into my diet and keep others around me happy too...\n\nyay!!!\n\nPS: Can someone tell me why this isn't classified under vegetarian??

From the bachelor-pad-sheik decor and numerous large flatscreens, to the cute and friendly waitstaff, and who could forget, the wonderful food and huge beer selection, this place is a winner.\n\nI'm not sure what problems some other reviewers had with the kitchen at this place, but they were on top of their game the afternoon I dropped by.  The Korean BBQ appetizer didn't have as strong a garlic flavor as one would expect, but the meat was perfectly cooked, and the flavor of the meat shone through well.  The rice could have been stickier, though.\n\nThe burger I ordered medium was perfectly cooked, and wonderously tender and flavorful.  It certainly goes down as one of the better burgers I've ever had.  The fries were light and crispy, but could have been more numerous.  My friend ordered a very tasty upscale mac'n'cheese which came adorned with perfectly cooked and juicy chicken breast pieces.\n\nThe servers were very attentive, and made for a very nice overall experience.  This is definitely the kind of place for you, if you're looking for great food and a relaxed, fun enviornment, but a touch more upscale than that little local hole in the wall.  Whether the goal is after-work unwinding, weekend playtime, or just a nice meal in a comfortable place, the Yard House delivers."

My last time I was served here.My waiter seemed confused as to what I was saying as if I had a hearing problem. I asked for pepper for my chicken soup, and he thought I said the opposite.\n\nHe then promptly walked away without me having the chance to correct him. He never truly took the time to ensure our orders were correct. For instance, we were brought the wrong beer and had to have another server fix the mistake.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not recall his name, but he was a young tall man with long hair. \n\nAlthough I just ranted about service, you must know that the food is incredible.

Well 7 rolls around and no table, so half of our party waits to leave their hotel, because...no table. Well we finally get seated at 7:45 (we tell our friends to come meet us). The server comes 5 minutes later to get drink orders, 5 minutes after that, the Manager Leo comes and asks us when the rest of our party will be there and we say shortly, and he then complains he can't have empty tables for long. Well unfortunately there is a movie theater upstairs (and Stars Wars opened yesterday, so Town Square is busy) so our friends have trouble finding a parking space. Well maybe after 10 more minutes, the Manager Leo comes back to our table and begins to actually yell at us about the empty table, and how they had it reserved at 6 and they held it for us...Which wasn't even for our group! So we tell him this and we tell him our friends are trying to park, but he continues to yell at us and say he needs the table because other people are waiting. We respond and say we had waited (just like everyone else) for over an hour and a half for our table and our friends will be there any minute. He storms off mumbling, and then of course our friends show up 30 seconds later. We did have an issue trying to get our check, and at one point, Manager Leo came over to the corner of the bar area and glared at our table for about 10 seconds and stormed off again. I have to say that I have NEVER seen or been treated that way by a \"manager\" and I think that the General Management need  to have a talk with him. I can't imagine what he's like any other Saturday night during dinner hours."

Food is amazing at this location.\n\n I am a big fan of chicken nahos, its just loaded with chicken, guac, beans, etc. Its a great starter for a big group. Hungry folks will devour it immediately. If you are going there with just another person, than don't get it. Its too big for both, and you can't take it home cause it will get soggy. My favorite are their ahi sliders. They are just delicious. The fish is fresh and its hint of citrus. Its a must have for anyone who's trying to eat healthy.   \n\nThey also have awesome beer selection, it could be bit more pricy than other local places, but the variety negates the higher price on beers. \n\nOverall, if you are hungry and if you are anywhere near town square than go here. On weekends, if does get really busy so if you have a big party than you might end up waiting for 15-30 minutes. I am not sure if you can reserve ahead of time."

That was my experience at Yard House this past Saturday night.\n\nWe sat down at a booth and order drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Our drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive, they don't come in chilled glassware, and the tap isn't cold - so your drink is warm after three-four sips. \n\nOur appetizers arrived with our entrees. The bowls/plates are large and with five people in a booth, we didn't have table space for the food. We were eating on top of one another. Since we ordered appetizer soups and entr\u00e9e sized salads instead of finger food - this wasn't cool! Armando blamed this on the kitchen, so my guess is they don't fire entrees separately from appetizers. Some restaurants fire appetizers and then check on the table's progress before firing the entrees. My recommendation on a busy day at Yard House would be to place your appetizer order, wait 15 minutes, and then order your entree.\n\nWe had a sixth person join us after our food arrived and her drink arrived just about the time we were all done eating. Overall, the experience was nothing special. I generally order appetizers for one reason, to offset the hunger and pace the food so you can enjoy the company your with and experience the meal.\n\nOutside of the service complaints, the Chicken Tortilla Soup was very good. It has a creamy white cheddar flavor with slices of avocado and tortilla strips in addition to a nice portion of chicken. The bowl of soup is not a large generous portion, so it could easily be an appetizer. \n\nThe entree portion of the Chopped Salad w/ salmon was fresh looking and generously portioned. It comes with the typical tomatoes, bacon, and avocados in addition to corn, cucumbers, celery, onion and cilantro.\n\nFor dessert, we decided to try the Mini Peach Apple Cobbler and the S'Mores Brownie. All three bits of crust topped cobbler were delicious. The S'Mores brownie required a topping of ice-cream, ordered afterward, because it is too dry to eat."

We didn't get to the desert menu because we were full. Maybe next time I am at Town Square I'll stop in and enjoy the food, beer, and great atmosphere."

Among the calamari were five (5) slices of lemon, battered and deep fried, and mixed in with the calamari to make it look like you get more than you do.  Biting into a slice of deep fried lemon is not pleasant.   We commented to our server who, when he returned to the table, told us we would have to take our complaint to Yardhouse.com.   So much for putting the customer first.  \n\nI recommend you stay away from the calamari unless you specifically order it 'with no lemon slices.\""

They have an amazing happy hour with over 100+ beers on tap!  Better yet is the food.  Everything I've tasted is simply to die for.  My favorite is the Lobster Garlic Noodles - huge chunks of lobster, crab, and shrimp - I couldn't ask for more!  The only thing preventing me for giving 5 stars is the wait... but it's constant max. capacity only affirms everything I just wrote."

Great food and service. When we go it's usually about 20+ people and the servers are on top of everything. It's a great place because it's not just a bar so coworkers under 21 can still come but for anyone who would like a drink it's perfect.

So if you are planning a get together, call ahead and make a reservation. Even then, there might still be some additional wait time for the tables to be cleaned up and reset for your party.\n\nThe biggest draw for hitting up Yard House is probably their beer selection.  Because the food is just alright overall with highlights here and there that I have discovered. For arranging parties when you don't know where else to go, Yard House is a safe bet.  Everyone in Vegas that goes out even occasionally will know about it.\n\nLove watching sports and paling around with friends or near by strangers?  This is a good spot, if you are willing to wait for an open table or vacant chair at the bar.  There are plenty of flat screens to occupy your attention.\n\nLooking for a quiet intimate and relaxing place to chill and grab a bite?  The noise alone will get this place crossed off the list.  But you are also not going to be spending the kind of money you would expect to pay at a restaurant with nice tablecloth and illuminated by real candle lights.\n\nThe service is okay to way above average.  What I do love about coming here with a large party is that the waitstaff has been trained to keep track of who ordered what, so splitting the bill at the end of the night is as painless and effortless on the customer's part as it is going to get.  Uber kudos for that alone!\n\nI would almost give this place a 4 stars, but for that to happen the food has to be better."

I was only expecting five people or so, but she reserved almost 20 some-odd seats!!! So good to know that the Yard House does take reservations in advance for such a huge party.  The party didn't start off as planned since the birthday girl was nearly two hours late for her own party!! lol. However, thank goodness for the large LCD TV screens plastered on every inch and corner of this place, we were able to kill the time, starting with some drinks and enjoying Sunday Night Football at the same time...so it all didn't go to waste :) The beer selection is AMAZING! They dedicate a whole two pages of the menu just for the beer, I've also seen Beer Floats and I have yet to try one. If you don't want to spend full price on alcoholic beverages, they have Happy Hour from 10pm-Close. \n\nThe Yard House...its an interesting restaurant. The ambiance in this place is...well....AMAZING!? ha ha. It's weird, you sit there at your table and the lighting is dim and serene, yet at the same time, with the LCD Screens and the bar smacked right in the middle of the restaurant, it's also like a pub! So...like a high class restaurant/Pub/Sports bar/Lounge? Does this make any sense? Because I'm just typing away and totally going off subject..........\n\nFood! I usually start off with the Calamari, the baby-squid type, not that O-ring type! Yum Yum....and my main dish is always the Crab Crusted Swordfish on Wasabi Mashed Potatoes. Absolutely amazing! The swordfish is cooked just right, every time I have ordered this dish, and not once was the fish over cooked. Its pretty pricey, $23.00 (give or take), but the portion is well worth your money! :) However this time I decided to try something else and a bit lighter. Since i filled my body with a lot of alcohol for the night, something big would get me sick so I decided to order something small. So I figured an appetizer, that's small enough right? I ordered the Ahi Poke Stacker which was $11.95. Ahi Poke is cubed raw tuna tossed in a mix of soy sauce, sesame seed oil, onions, limu, green onions. I grew up on this stuff, so I was quite curious of the Yard House's recipe. I was VERY satisfied. When I received my plate, first layer was ahi poke, then a layer of \"fried something\", next topped with seasoned sauteed Carrots, another layer of  the fried \"crispy something\", topped with more poke. It was light, refreshing, and absolutely delish!!! The taste was just as amazing as its presentation. :) My new favorite dish! Don't forget to finish off with the Kona Coffee Sundae for dessert, it's quite big, so you can share with a friend or significant other! \n\nUsually with big groups, taking orders could be tricky. It makes sense for a group of 14, to assign two waiters to take orders. After that experience, unless the two waiters can communicate good, its not a good idea. Problems such as taking double orders (esp with drinks..) not cool! But it was all squared away with no problems. Other than that the waiters were on their game and totally cool!"

When we get to the entrance of the Yard House, we saw people walk in and out, and some of people were just gathering in front of the entrance. This restaurant was very busy that it took us about half an hour to get a seat. We sat in the restaurant booth, which is about 8ft from the bar. The design of the dinning room is pretty. The room is dark, but very comfortable. I ordered the small size Penne with Chicken, which is in the House Favorite category. My friend ordered the small size BBQ Chicken Salad. Even though the restaurant was very busy, the service was very fast. It took only about 10 minutes for the dishes to be served. In the Penne with Chicken, the penne was nicely mixed with the asparagus, mushrooms, tomato, and cheese, and it also looked glossy. The size of the dish was about 12 to 16oz. The smell of the dishes is very good that it is not too strong but mild. The penne was smooth and a little bit creamy; it was slippery in the mouth. The chicken was tender, and its flavor was salty, a little acid, and creamy. The acid flavor of the tomato was balanced with the marsala cream sauce. The BBQ Chicken salad had a very fresh smell and bright colors. The fried onion had a weaker smell than the no fried one, and it was well mixed with other greens. The texture of the salad was crispy and moist. Because avocado, tomato, beans, corn, cilantro, and pasilla were included in this dish, it had flavor of salty, sweet, acid, and spicy. The chicken of the salad had a little burnt taste. The size of the salad is big that we did not finish it even though the one we order was a small size. Due to the good first impression, my friend and I would like plan for a return."

I am willing to admit that my disgust with GB's could have influenced this particular visit to Yard House, but after all, the right time and the right place are also factors by which we develop opinions.\n\nI had two items off the happy-hour appetizer menu, the Seared Ahi Tuna and the Spicy Tuna Roll.\n\nThe bartender kindly warned me that the Spicy Tuna Roll was presented in a completely different manor than I was probably used to, offering my a bit of his personal insight to allow me an opportunity to rethink my decision. But I am a culinary warrior with the self-proclaimed fortitude that has catapulted me toward some of the worlds greatest food discoveries - and I was not about to be deterred by unconventionalism.\n\nThe presentation was unusual, to say the least. But this work of art was visionary delight, in a castle of tuna, a delightfully mild wasabi sauce and a number of items I wont embarrass myself trying to identify. It was almost too beautiful to want to breach the walls of this incredible castle, but the urge to sample its goods was too tempting. I can say, although its taste resembled a spicy tuna roll in many ways, it uniqueness made it truly a one of a kind item.\n\nThe Seared Ahi Tuna, which I had had before, was delicious as always and its presentation rivaled that of its chivalrous brother.\n\nI am truly blessed to be within a stones throw of Yard House. I suggest you stop in some time - you might just see me there."

It's at Town Square and right by UNLV, perfect place to go to during Happy Hour with the amount of draft beers they have!!\n\nThe restaurant is huge inside with outdoor seating!! I like sitting outside during fall/spring time frame and definitely indoors during winter and summer. It's a laid back chill environment that's good for everyone. The ambient lighting is good for that kind of romantic feeling if you want it to be, but also just to relax and chill. \n\nI'm here for Happy Hour with a bunch of friends usually, we used to frequent this place at least once a week, now not so much as we're getting tired of the same ol' thing, lol. \n\nI like trying something different every time I come here as far as the draft beer goes. I've tried almost everything and found some of my favorite types through doing this! Just gotta keep an open mind and be willing to try something new in order for this to work out! Amber ales have been my favorites, followed by stouts, and then lagers, but I've also been spoiled by what's on tap and now I stay away from bottled beer as much as possible! It really does taste different.\n\nWith my friends and I, we usually just stick around to what's on the appetizer menu, because they're half off during Happy Hour. Some of our favorites include the Chicken Nachos, Chicken Tenders, Seared Ahi Sashimi, Sliders, Spinach artichoke dip, and pizza. You'll almost always see these items on our table from the Happy Hour menu. Other items we usually end up ordering are the Truffle Fries and the Mac & Cheese. The portions are decent for the appetizers and good for sharing, especially the Chicken Nachos. \n\nIt's good for just all around hang out with a bunch of friends to just relax and catch up. I don't usually do large groups at other places, but here it's fine, because it does get pretty loud."

The fish tacos were decent, but lacked the flavor I'm accustomed to in San Diego. It could have used something to brighten it up. Perhaps mango pineapple? At any rate, it was lacking that tang that makes fish tacos pop. The beans were also just okay, as was the rice. Actually, the rice was pretty oily.

Food was tasty but portion size was small with my two asada tacos with rice and beans, my son's scallop dish, and side of sweet potato fries. Other dishes were fine (jumbulaya, cheese sandwich w/tomato soup, and orange chicken), but everyone finished their entire plates. We ordered dessert because we were not quite full. Our trio dessert was okay, but my daughter's chocolate dessert was not served warm as described. I think we will return for lunch next time, as this place doesn't serve enough food for dinner even after spending over $25 a person."

The place reminded me a lot of BJ's restaurant, although this place had more of a different twist to their menu.  They also serve a ton of beer!  The display of all of the beer kegs right when you enter is quite impressive!  Since I'm not much of a beer drinker, I opted for the fruitier belgian drink called the Lindeman's Framboise.  It's seriously an alcoholic juice...very dangerous!  \n\nAs for food, I think our eyes were hungrier than our stomachs!  We ordered the Truffle Fries (shredded parmesan and herbs) with a hint of garlic.  It was delish!  Then we ordered the Ahi Poke Bowl with some fried wontons that were also quite tasty.  Then we ordered Pastrami sliders which did not meet my standards.  I have had better pastrami burgers and this one was on the salty side.  The hubby also ordered Moo  Shu Egg Rolls (no good) and Chinese Garlic Noodles.  Maybe I was delusional to think that the garlic noodles would come close to Thanh Long's.  \n\nAll in all, if you want lots of beer variety and a good atmosphere, then this place is for you.  Just don't expect them to excel in the food department."

Our bill was also settled fairly promptly. \n\nSome drinks offered and ordered that day included Old 43 and  Timmerman strawberry lambert. Old 43 a mixed drink with bourbon and citrus.  Timmerman strawberry lambert was on tap. One of the two was a bit more on the bourbon and the other was bit more sweet. Both good. The strawberry drink was good.

I would highly recommend coming here during happy hour, which is currently between 3pm and 6pm on weekdays and 10pm until close on Sunday through Wednesday. I believe most of their draft beers and many of their appetizers are half price. Otherwise, prepare to spend quite a bit (for my taste anyway).\n\nI've really only been here a few times. Each time, I've been able to find a beer that has been really enjoyable. On my most recent visit last night, I had a Delirium Tremens (a Belgian Strong Ale) and an Alaskan Amber (also an ale). I believe I once had the Delirium Tremens at the Freakin' Frog and it was almost $10. Here it was around $5.\n\nHonestly, I've always liked the idea of Yard House, but it's not a place I go to often. If it's happy hour, I definitely recommend it, especially if you want to try a new beer."

Between California and Nevada, I have eaten at this restaurant at least a few dozen times, and general eat the same few options. Getting to the point, upon arrival of the main course, i saw a dark piece of something poking out of the breading of my chicken fingers. Considering I eat these almost every time I eat at Yardhouse, dismantling deemed appropriate. I pulled the breading off and discovered a cockroach /bug type wing and a limb on an insect. The food runner was notified of the incident, and attempted to take the plate back. I denied him, took a photo and requested a manager. The manager (Beau Boskey) assured me it was cabbage, but also denied eating it upon request. At this point, he offered to take that dish off the bill, and shrugged off the entire situation as a misunderstanding. He entirely discrediting my opinion, and I'm a collector of  scientific insect displays. Kind of ironic. Our server came over and apologized about the whole situation. We understood it wasn't her fault, but did let her know that the manager handled the situation wrong(she was tipped). She apparently notified him of my dissatisfaction and conversation of taking this to his upper management/corporate. After Beau, the manager, caught word, he decided to retract his original offer and comp the whole meal. This attempt to appease me was an appropriate gesture, a bit late and an obvious back step. Overall, this restaurant experience will never be forgotten... in a bad way. .........By the way... I looked up deep fried cabbage on google image search and my photo looks very different. gross. \n3/22/13 Update- I was recently offered a free meal and assurance that my experience is going to be used as a training exercise. Obviously, I'll never eat at this place again, and hopefully they figure out how to deal with these situations better in the future."

The fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nAllow me break it down for you:\nHappy hour is Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm, Sun-Wed 10pm-close\n\nDomestic Pints - $3.50, Craft&Import Pints - $4.25-$4.75\nSliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): Classic, Bearnaise, Pastrami, Turkey, Veggie. Ahi is $9.95\n\nHalf priced pizzas: BBQ chicken, 4cheese, Ham & pineapple, Margherita, Pepperoni & Mushroom, Spicy Thai Chicken\n\nHalf priced apps: Crab cakes, Calamari, Cali Roll, Chinese Garlic Noodles, Chicken Nachos, Onion Ring Tower, Wings, Boneless wings, Veggie wings, Hawaiian Poke stack, Spicy tuna roll, Seared Ahi Sashimi, Chicken lettuce wraps, Fried chicken strips, spinach cheese dip, Moo Shu egg rolls\n\nDoesn't that just BLOW your mind? It's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nSo far I've tried:\n-Bearnaise sliders (Bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)\n-BBQ chicken and Margherita pizzas (They pretty much taste as they should. Sometimes the BBQ chicken is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (Yum. Perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. Served w/ marinara and, I wanna say tartar sauce? I usually go with the red..)\n-Traditional wings (First and last time I had these, they were so spicy! My bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. The thing that I don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\nEverything I've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more I have yet to try! I know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour poke stack. He's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the poke stack, so I can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nKey points:\n-Happy hour is awesome here\n-Traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-Calamari is delectable\n-French fries are close to perfect\n-Great for groups\n-Service has been pretty fast on the days that I've gone"

At first they messed up our drink orders.. we shrugged it off.. no big deal.. Then they bring half the table their food and just never came back with the other half. After having to get up to find a manager we still had to wait 15-20 minutes for it. Then they bring out the completely wrong food.. So we send it back.. then another 20 minutes goes by and the first half of the table is done and ready to go.. Then finally they bring out the food. Two of which items were burgers that were ordered medium rare and came out burnt.. To make matters worse the server never came back for drink refills and we eventually had to find someone to do that for us as well. It was embarrassing especially since I made the recommendation to go there (having been there only one time before just to drink)  Just about everyone at the table who was a first timer said they would never be back, and I dont blame them."

Mostly because I've always wanted to say \"Can I get the spicy chicken sandwich please?\" I've never been able to say that before!). Its the Gardein substitute for meat, a gluten-free, soy-based protein that is supposed to duplicate the flavor/taste/texture of meat. I thought it was delish. Moist and Very filling. The aioli was great too. Don't be afraid of the cabbage (I was, I hate cabbage). It's a thin layer, quite sparse and the other flavors conceal the cabbage anyway. I'm not sure if this is a NV thing or a new feature at the chain, bc the last one I went to in So Cal didn't have that many veggie options (they had the regular amount, just not a half of a page in the menu dedicated to soy protein (fake meat) dishes!!\n\nI'd love to give them 5 stars, I really wanted to. The staff was friendly, they called when the order was ready (I picked up), they even had the water I requested all ready to go... But the sweet potato fries weren't cooked all the way through. Not all of them, at least. As a giant fan of sweet potato fries, that is disappointing. It means enough to knock off a star even though YH knocked my socks off with the veggie menu.

The team I'm rooting for wins and now I'm off to check out the Foodie Festival at the Silverton.\n\nComparing my Scottsdale Yard House experience to here, I would say this waif staff has the edge by a half point."

But the one thing I love about the yard house is if you try to be adventurous and you don't like the item you ordered they will either take it off your bill or try to please you with something else.

I never knew they had ciders on the menu based on the names, but the new categories made it easy to see that they do...love the pear one!!!\n\nMy only issue with Yard House is that they don't have a late night happy hour on Thursday nights...I can understand the weekends, but what's up with Thursdays?? I always seem to get my Yard House cravings on Thursdays late night, but no Happy Hour :("

Beer - The selection of beer on draft is amazing.  Who knew about a yard glass of draft could be what the doctor ordered.  Not the cheapest beer, and a bit slow to make its way to your table.  However, very nice selection.\n\n2. Food - A very large menu.  Plenty of Vegetarian dishes, Gardien substitute dishes as well as your Hamburgers, Pastas, Meats/ Fish, Pizzas and plenty of other items. \n\n3.  Service - Great service, attentive and friendly.\n\n4.  Music - Kind of loud atmosphere.  A little too loud to have great conversations, however,  you can cuddle up tighter if need be!\n\n5.  Waiting time - Takes a bit of the food and lots of time for the alcohol to come out and served.  Also, why not serve the food together rather than waiting 10 minutes for food to dribble out and then some getting cold?\n\n6.  The price - Very pricey this place is.\n\nGK says, a great place and you will pay for it!"

Seth my server was great and tried to fix the problem .But there u go the table was gone this great day i had looked forward to was gone.i do hope they tell there hostess how important they are they can make or break the mood from the start . Why oooo why do I keep going back ?  I love town square and being out side i went back to yard house this time with my daughter and my service dog when I asked for water they said no that the law said they could not give him water. Not wanting to kill the day with my daughter she just ran to the pet store and picked up a container for him to drink from . I do hope this inspires them to check out what the law is"

Sure, you can go to the neighborhood bar and find $1 beers on tap at odd hours...but the quality offered by Yard House is seldom seen in combination with their prices. Expect to pay $4-5 for a delicious imported beer, $4 wells, or $5-6 for one of their signature martinis and cocktails. \n\nOn top of that, their food is delicious. And by delicious, I mean I've never eaten anything there that wasn't. Generously portioned half priced appetizers will undoubtedly keep you satiated to the tune of $6-7, or you can enjoy their sliders or pizza selection for similar pricing. \n\nI rang in my 21st birthday here in 2009, and my friends had a blast exposing me to all sorts of fun delicious drinks - I can give Yard House some credit for the eclectic taste in spirits I have now. Take me seriously when I say, they have beer for EVERYONE. If you hate beer, THEY HAVE BEER FOR YOU. If you love beer, they have 250 of them! If you think beer is tolerable but haven't found one you love yet, get in your car *right now* and go to Yard House. I'm serious. My personal favorites are Goose Island Matilda, a Belgian style pale ale that tastes a little bit fruity with a lot of kick, and Stone Ruination IPA. They always card - ALWAYS - which I also enjoy ;)\n\nThe reason they lose a star isn't even really their fault, but it does deserve to be said - cell phone service is RARE. I've received many angry text messages and voicemails after being unreachable for the few hours I spent enjoying my Goose Island Matilda and Ahi Poke Stack. No bueno. However, although Yard House doesn't provide WiFi as stated on this page, Town Square does and I have been known to bring my laptop with me for a working lunch here. \n\nWith both afternoon and late night happy hours - you can't lose. Unless you hate food and alcohol and prefer to live in a cave chewing on cardboard. In that place, you should probably get off Yelp."

Once inside, we found a spot at the always large bar and were greeted with the information that Happy Hour was still going and encouraged to take advantage of it. Not only did we do so, but even our second round of drinks were billed to us at the Happy Hour discount despite being ordered at least 15-20 minutes beyond its expiration. The Happy Hour was a tremendous value, especially on the food as both the crab cakes and turkey burger sliders were rather tasty and filling. Not only were our bartenders very nice and attentive, I really appreciated how a store manager was extremely active in keeping a very full bar of customers very happy. Happy Hour or not, I'm a loyal customer of any Yard House and wish there was one in the Tampa Bay area I could visit on a regular basis."

Why would I want to eat bar food? I was wrong because the food is good, not just average bar food.\n\nThe lunch specials are very tasty and accommodate a lunch hour at a reasonable price. My favorite combination is the 1/2 Roast Beef Dip with a salad. Diet splurge meets healthy. My favorite appetizers are the Onion Rings and Chicken Nachos. When we come here for work dinners the Mac & Cheese with truffle oil is a favorite for several of my coworkers. The burgers are also really good, loaded with toppings and very juicy.\n\nThe menu is huge and has something to accommodate all tastes. Great spot to take a picky friend. This is obviously a great spot for beer lovers since they have so many beers on tap.\n\nThis particular location has a lot of outdoor seating which is a great option on a nice day. The patio is in the center of the shopping center for plenty of people watching entertainment."

We were quickly seated at a table and greeted about five minutes later by our server Seth, who brought out our hibiscus tea and water. He was efficient and friendly and made great menu recommendations. We don't eat much at one sitting so we went straight in and my sister ordered their classic cheese burger with fries and I ordered the shrimp bowl with rice. One thing I noticed was their drink selection was ENORMOUS. Drafts, cocktails, mixed drinks and margaritas you name it they know it. Looked like a great happy hour spot if only we could've came at 10 pm. But it was ok, once our food came out I was very happy with my choice as I love veggies with my food and this place did a rice bowl with veggies and shrimp PERFECTLY. Since we were pressed for time we did not stay long but overall satisfied with the experience, I recommend going for happy hour on the weekdays so your server isn't rushed because I got that vibe a few times from the look of the servers there. Would go for happy hour!"

Usually the bartenders are on point and more than willing to serve, but not tonight.\n\nWhen we sat down the bartender asked if I wanted a drink (as she should), but when I said I needed a second she had a little attitude. I was also waiting for my wife to join me and she returned a few times with no drink order yet. After that it seemed like she wanted nothing to do with us.  \n\nWe ordered some fried cheese curds (which were delicious), but took nearly 40 minutes to arrive. When it came time to order food I made it blantely obvious we needed something and no one came to help. Finally tracked down a bartender who said \"I thought you ordered already\".  Our 2 salads took another 30 minutes to get. \n\nMay have to rethink when I want yard house again which is sad because I generally love this place."

I have had a few different items here but I always end up getting the mac and cheese squared.  This stuff is a grown edition of the kids meal.  My wife likes to order the \nChilean Sea Bass.  The beer menu can be daunting when you first see it.  Don't worry they offer beer samplers.  The samplers are hit and miss.  One time we went the sampler had 2 different Sam Adams and common hefeweizen.  Sometimes it can have some great selections.  They also have some cool beers blends.  I like to order the Dark Castle which is new castle and Guinness.  So if you have a friend or relative from out of town visiting take them to the Yard House, chances are they don't have one in their town.  Cheers!   Oh and if you go on the weekend, call ahead and reserve a table.  trust me!"

Maybe people feel more comfortable at a chain, maybe people are just boozehounds, the world may never know. \n\nI like Yard House better for lunch personally because I find the dinner entrees to be a bit overpriced. When it first opened friends constantly wanted to dine here and my wallet cringed as well as my patience as we jammed up against the bar waiting for our table. Once you get past that however, the place is quality. The portions are big and no one can complain about the beer selection (unless, like me, you await the arrival of Yuengling to the west coast, I check every time I go). They have a great selection of food so everyone in the party will be able to find something they're in the mood for. Yard House reminds me of Cheesecake Factory, but substitute cake for beer. The lunch specials are very fairly priced and will fill you up.\n\nThe outdoor seating is awesome in the still bearable months of summer and at night prepare to see some sights sashaying over to nearby Blue \"wait this isn't Tao?\" Martini. Good times all around. There are TV's everywhere in this joint, including outdoors, so you won't miss a pass, kick or homerun. Overall I recommend but if you're going for dinner, have a snack before you leave the house to hold you over."

Our waitress Nancy was super friendly, but it seemed like she was stretched pretty thin - I think they're understaffed. \n\nHere's what we tried...\n\nDeviled Eggs - a classic deviled egg covered with a sweet tomato sauce and topped with bacon. SO GOOD! \n\nEgg Rolls - solidly delicious, but probably nothing different/special from anywhere else. Basically, it made me happy because I love egg Rolls. \n\nChicken Fingers - just like the egg Rolls, pretty much like what you'd find anywhere else. It's well done and can hit the spot. Also, they come with Fries which can be upgraded to truffle Fries. \n\nTruffle Fries - Awesome! You can actually taste the truffle flavor, unlike at so many places. The Fries are skinny cut and pretty drench in the oil. But they have enough Crunch so it didn't bother us. \n\nShort Rib - meh. Great flavor, but too chewy for me. Also, it was accompanied by saut\u00e9ed spinach that hadn't been seasoned at all and simply tasted of the oil they'd been cooked in \n\nBurger - my friend Mr. P ordered this. While he enjoyed his burger, he made the mistake of getting a side of veggies instead of fries. The veggies seemed to simply be steamed and not seasoned - no good. \n\nButterscotch Pudding - awesome! Definitely my favorite dessert! \n\nCoconut Ice Cream - much better and more exciting than most coconut ice creams out there. Not only was it full of toasted coconut shavings, but it was bursting with flavor! It almost tasted like a Samoa cookie without the chocolate. \n\nS'more Brownie - fail. Wouldn't get this again. While it was a generous portion, it was wider than it was deep. I was hoping for a deep dish, warm, Gooey Brownie. Instead, it was only a little thicker than a cookie and very dry. No good. \n\nI'd love to go back for happy hour to try more and pay a better price!"

Don't get me wrong.. food here is great but the service of the waitstaff needs a little work. The last time I was there, the food runner dropped off our pizza at the table next to us. We were already irritated the food was taking long so we saw the whole thing. The girls next to us were talking among themselves that they got a free pizza and proceeded to pick and eat the toppings off. The server came by 5 minutes later and apologized to the other table... TOOK THE PIZZA OFF THEIR TABLE... AND DROPPED IT ON OUR TABLE and said \"Sorry... here, enjoy!\" Gross. That was the last straw.. I'm NEVER going back there again. Try the Summerlin or the LINQ location. I've been to both and it's MUCH better service there."

During our visit, we even had a shift change, where our original waitress was kind enough to let us know she was leaving and who was taking over.  \n\nAlthough the rest of our table had appetizers, The Husband and I arrived in time for entrees:\n\n* New York Steak Salad \"green beans, roasted peppers, avocado, crispy potatoes, red onion and baby lettuce tossed in a gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and pickled egg\" ($16.95) - A generous and flavorful salad, loaded with the ingredients listed and a tasty steak.\n\n* Cuban Roast Pork Dip \"tomatoes, pepper jack cheese, pickles, dijon and garlic aioli on french bread grilled with bbq au jus\" ($12.65) - This was The Husband's order and I had a bite.  It wasn't that great, especially when I recall my previous experience with a Cuban sandwich.  The fries were good though.\n\nMy concern was more with service.  The waiter asked the birthday girl what kind of dessert she wanted (out of three choices), and she went for the Chocolate Souffle Cake \"mini serving with vanilla ice cream, served warm\".  When it arrived, there was no candle which surprised us all.  (How are you supposed to sing happy birthday without a candle to blow?)  And he only gave us one spoon, which reminded me that he never brought back dessert menus for the rest of us.  At this point, we didn't bother ordering dessert since the birthday girl already had hers.  That part made the experience disappointing.\n\nThe other waiter was able to do a split tender on the check, which was helpful.  (Although he put the costs wrong on my receipt, oh well.)  I usually think Yard House is on top of things, but I guess they weren't that night."

We sat at the bar and ordered Ephemer, they didn't have it. (the only reason why I went there in the first place) got the Sam Adams summer ale instead.  Ordered wings but took like 20 mins for the staff to realize the printer was broken in the kitchen. 10 mins later, by the time we actually got the wings the movie was starting in 5min, so we decided to catch the next showing.  \n\nFor those of you that like only the drum stick and not the wing of the chicken, this would be perfect.  They only serve the drum sticks that are breaded.  I would assume because they had to get it out of the kitchen so fast the chicken was not done all the way.  Still had a bit of pink by the bones.  We did not finish it.  \n\nThey did take the wings off the check but the service was not as attentive as I would expect in a place where they have such an exotic selection of beers.  For someone that does not know about beers would feel intimidated and inclined to just order a bud light cause of the lack of help.  \n\nOverall it was not the best first impression, but they have a great product and I will visit again for the beers."

Onion ring tower is delicious, it comes with ranch and some other sauce. The other sauce is delicious, I just don't know what it is. The garlic chicken noodles is my favorite thing on their happy hour menu, it has a lot of flavor and is definitely good enough for a meal even though it's listed as an appetizer. My friends have ordered almost all the pizzas their and they're nothing special. Although I am from New York so I'm a pizza snob lol. Spinach dip is also yummy but very rich. \n\nOur favorite drinks are the ciders especially the pear and raspberry ones. My friends have ordered  many different kinds of ales, beers, etc and have enjoyed each and every one. \n\nRecently, we came for lunch and I ordered their lunch special. It consisted of either a pizza or sandwich with soup or salad. I had the pastrami sandwich with clam chowder. The pastrami sandwich lacked cheese and mustard but did come served with jalape\u00f1os. It was good but not quite what I expected. The clam chowder was yummy and I wished I had just ordered that by itself. \n\nAll in all, it has decent food and definitely a nice place to hangout with some friends."

            "review": "Okay, there are a few things that are going to be brought up and I'm almost guaranteed to get a manager comment on this, but whatever, it's happening.\n\nWent here last night to try the Gardein line here. I was very excited to see that vegan meats have been added to some of their dishes. How cool is that?? But upon doing some internet research before we ordered, I found out that due to cooking methods, ALL of the dishes wouldn't be vegan OR vegetarian. They cook everything on the same grill as the meat. What sense does this make? None. It's like having a black coat and putting bleach all over it - it doesn't resemble a black coat anymore and is tainted. If you mix vegan food with meat, what is the point? \n\nAnd here comes why it is 2-star. IT IS NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR THE VEG*N MENU TO BE COOKED IN A SEPARATE PAN. You have to go out of your way to ask for this, and even then a manager comes out to explain that it's not going to taste the same as if it were on the grill. Hmm - do you really think a vegan WANTS dead cow mixed in with her food? HELL NO. Granted, Yardhouse has already taken *some* action and put a little dot next to a few items that absolutely will come in contact with meat since these items are fried and have to go in the same basket as everything else. But they haven't specified that ALL the menu items will come in contact with animal products which is not okay. It would be really helpful if people who come here know this right off the bat. If I hadn't had my phone on me that night, I literally would have gotten sick since I haven't had any sort of meat in 6 years. \n\nHere's what I would suggest: just like other companies before you (Chipotle comes to mind), please automatically make all the vegetarian/Gardein items cooked separately from the meat. You don't want a lawsuit a la McDonald's. It is ridiculous that these vegan meats come to you and then you cross-contaminate them with animal sources to make them not even vegetarian. Oh and this isn't just for this Yardhouse, it goes for all of them - trust me, I will be contacting your corporate offices today. Also, it would be nice if you could put a little V next to the items that could be made vegan or are vegan on the menu. Makes ordering easier, and the confusion of your staff minimal.\n\nAnyways, I ordered the veggie sliders that come with fries, and we also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Matt ordered a thai \"chicken\" pizza. After some back and forth, the sliders couldn't even go on the bread (only the wheat bread is vegan) so I got them protein style, wrapped in lettuce. The sweet potato fries we got as our appetizer were severely lackluster. Very bland, no taste, no toppings like sugar or anything. We couldn't have the sauce since it contained bacon, so I guess that's where all the flavor is. After the aforementioned back and forth with the wait staff, we got our food. Do they seriously only have the meat and the bun (in my case, lettuce) for the sliders? NOTHING else? No tomato or onion or even ketchup and mustard? For serious? The taste of the Gardein patty was wonderful, but for almost $11 for plain patties is ridiculous. The fries were way better than the sweet potato ones, but it just wasn't worth the price. I wish they would have suggested to make my order a veggie burger since that's essentially what they did anyways, was cut the patty into four pieces and pass them off as sliders. At least then I could have had the wheat bun and toppings. \n\nIt was very difficult throughout the night to try and signal our waitress. I know it was very busy and that I did ask a lot of questions and such, but she was an expert ninja. Not the best customer service in the world. I also unfortunately don't see this Gardein line lasting here at Yardhouse. Until cooking the items separately becomes standard procedure, I can see a lot of vexed veg*ns. Honestly, what is the point of having vegan meats if they're going to end up on the same grill as actual meats? I just don't get that logic. Yardhouse itself is a bit pricey and I understand this, but at least give the customer the most you can. Plain sliders are not okay. In fact, I don't think I've been anywhere that has completely bare sliders. \n\nDue to the lackluster food, the outrageous price tag and the lack of good customer service, Yardhouse really deserves a 1-star review but I still love that a chain has decided to put vegan faux meats on their menu. The intent is there, but the execution is awful but can be easily improved upon. I might be back since there were other items that looked appetizing, but only when I want to deal with the headaches and the hassle. Until then, I'll stock up on Gardein at Whole Foods and make my own delights at home."

I certainly can't speak for anything on the menu aside from their appetizers, but everything that I have eaten has been excellent (and not just because I had downed multiple assorted beers).  The tap selection is unparalleled, which is great for people like me who like to see choices that go far beyond the basics like Sam Adams and Fat Tire.  They have scores of beers on tap that I haven't seen at any other bars in this city.  The only bad thing I could say is that they require 80% of your party to be present before they will give you a table.  That can be frustrating when you know that 10 co-workers are going to show up, yet they won't give you a big table because you only have 6 people present.  No matter, we usually just put in for the table and wait at the bar for everyone to show up.  Obviously I'm not too upset about it, because the great prices on Happy Hour appetizers and the ridiculous beer selection are what make me give this place a resounding 5 stars."

I immediately regretted my decision, since the last time I went to the Yard House in Summerlin the chowder was watery, had very little flavor and was not good. Instead of canceling my order I figured I'd try it since I was at a different location. Wow! I was pleasantly surprised to have the most fantastic New England clam chowder I have had since the East coast. It was the perfect consistency and loaded with flavorful clams. I definitely got my money's worth. The service was excellent, as they bought my glass of wine since there was a minimal delay in my drink order. A delay I barely noticed, but I did make a point of telling them to call the chef in Summerlin and teach him how to make clam chowder."

The service is terrible on the weekends at the bar, you almost have to throw something at a bartender to get service. The food is great though. Honestly, I have never had a bad plate of food from there. It is a little pricey for a bar I will say. They have a huge list of beer available on tap and it can be a nice place to go to if you don't go at the already pre-specified times by another reviewer. It's basically a less fancy pick up bar on the weekends for college kids. If you want to get loud and rowdy, this is the place to go on Friday and Saturday. If you want some great food for dinner before a movie that's not on the weekends, this is your place."

It's a real Yelp success story....We came as strangers and discovered friends. I mean I adore a lot of people on Yelp, but I'm particularly lucky to have met Jieun L, Anthony M., Elnino F, and Andy T who cared \nenough to get me out of the house and get me out of my birthday funk.  My BF reads my reviews and he also turned everything around with the small things. Thank you guys and I love you all. \n\nBeers are here so I have a hard time not liking this chain...with the circumstance above though I was in that kind of mood to almost hate everything because I'm reserved to being \"done with\" today. It's extra kudos to the Yardhouse reliable brews, decent food and our server that I still enjoyed the restaurant. Yeah there are setbacks like any spots but drink selections make me happy so it was a good choice to turn around any bad day. Our server (Mitch) was pretty good in service, had good beer recommendations and he also brought me a happy birthday brownie sundae (yay!). Nachos were pretty good and loaded with stuff. Sweet potato fries maple bacon sauce was delish that I want to pour that on just about every breakfast item. Ceviche spoons were fresh and light. Chicken garlic noodles- good but go for the plain garlic noodles. There was chicken, tofu, mushrooms, edamame, asparagus, chives, garlic, cheese and it's too much at once. Simple is better with garlic noodles.\n\nBF found a favorite beer worth mentioning- Rogue Dry Hopped Red. Smooth with a bit of hops...a good choice to baby step into the IPAs and DIPAs. He liked it much so that we went back 4days later to order this beer again...we never order twice since our goal is to drink down the whole list (past halfway). \n\nA few drinks and plates in we were laughing so hard that I was snorting. I mean, I like never do that unless I'm really fighting hard to stop laughing. Anthony has awesome one liners. Jieun makes funny beer faces. Elnino is a violent funny drunk. My BF coined some T-shirt worthy terms at the table. Andy is just a G and always for a good time. \n\nI expected to go home from work, eat lunch and stay home alone until my BF can get off, head to dinner and go sleep and forget about the day even being my birthday. \n\nEverything is alright when you have good company to make you smile."

For some reason, out of all of those, I found myself munching on the fries and dipping them on the honey mustard that accompanied the chicken. I guess the fries were just in the sweet spot of crunchiness and fluffiness, and the honey mustard was way too addictive. I can't speak for the beer, but everybody at my table seemed to enjoy theirs and they have a huge selection. Finally,  gotta love a place that plays some Beatles and some George Harrison.\n\nI also wanted to add a tip for finding this place. Gotta locate it before you can enjoy it, you know? It's kinda hidden if you're driving along most of the streets, so locate it on a map of Town Square beforehand or else just park somewhere and walk around. I think it might be best if you park near H&M and take the alley that starts off with the sushi bar and Yogurtland, then walk past the \"clearing\" in the middle. You should see it on the right."

Further more, order poorly, like really really poorly. I blame my actions on fatigue, and pray you don't judge me. \nCame here today for lunch at 3pm. Was seated in their lovely patio. Started off with guacamole, it was fine. When it came to our lunches my friend asked if he could have a pizza half pepperoni half BBQ chicken. We were told you can't do half pizzas when they have different sauces. What? He explained he didn't care if the topping ventured onto the wrong sauce (BBQ/tomato) and the kitchen refused. Then came my brilliant order of the Hawaiian poke stack. At this time, an alarm should have sounded in my brain \"Rachel! It's ahi tuna! It's raw! It takes skill and quality to create a sublime product and your at a chain!\". Instead my tummy prevailed, and what I got  was a stringy, chewy, tough, pile of butchered fish. \nLesson learned, when hungry and if you wind up at a chain, pause, think, then order.\nI do want to mention the staff is great and this in no way reflects on them."

I've heard the new beer cocktails are \"weird\" so haven't tried those.\n\nService is usually good. The servers attitudes are sometimes better than the food runners. I've had plates slung at me...I laughed it off on all accounts, it's a tough job, I get it. They try to keep drinks filled, sometimes they succeed. Better at keeping the alcohol flowing than the water, if you get my drift aka $$. \n\nSome of my family's favorites are chicken fingers (kids menu), their fries, spicy tuna roll & California roll (two of my faves), seared ahi sashimi, Pastrami Sliders & the chicken lettuce wraps. Mac n Cheese is AMAZING, but I usually allow myself to order it once a year- it's so rich. Also, loved the Lobster Garlic Noodle; it's a special occasion dish, too! Any of their salads are good. The Gorgonzola dressing is great. Skip their pizzas. \n\nCheck their HH special before you go.\n\nOverall, I am especially fond of the vibe, the layout/lighting & decor, and their great playlist. Service and food are good enough and the drinks are great!"

So we won a visa giftcard of $100 and decided to celebrate at this yardhouse earlier...everything from the food, drinks, and service was going great until the bill came of $160. Ok so we explained to the waitress to charge $100 on the card and the rest will just be cash of $80 which the change would be her tip...she comes back to us saying the card wouldn't go through because ''giftcards like this takes out a percentage,'' so she claimed she tried swiping $95, $90, $85, and finally the amount of $80 went through. She also said it took out an extra $12 as the ''percentage that goes to the back to the bank.'' we made sure to ask if that $12 goes to her and she said \"NO.\" ok nothing seems to make sense, so I called customer service and they told us that the reason why the amount didn't go through BECAUSE they charged the amount of $115, $113, $110 (so obviously it wouldn't go through BECAUSE the card only contains $100!!!) and that extra $12 was charged as a gratuity for the restaurant, it doesn't go back to the bank merchant...So this waitress PRETTY MUCH LIED to our face not realizing we won't call the customer service of the card!!! They obviously keep track of every single swipe and was able to tell us what amount they charged us. She purposely charged more than $100 into making us think that it won't go through and charged that extra $12 for tip but lying that it doesn't go to her so we can give her more money...that is just plain SHADY! are u freaking kidding me? Why would she lie like that? Has other waiters here done this as their way to pocket more tips? It's not about the amount that gets me, it's this dishonesty that really boggles my mind! It was such a disappointment because she was accommodating but forget that when you're dishonest! Normally patrons would have made a fuss over this but I'm not like that, we just left but I would like to talk to a manager about this tomorrow because that's just wrong. We were willing to give her 25% tip but we're not as stupid as she thought we were so we left. She still got that $12 though so whatever."

Happy hour deals are not great compared to many places, and not even a deal compared to some normal prices. You pay for the location and trendiness at all Yard House's, and they are a deal compared to casinos or others such as Tommy Bahama's at Town Square.  I have found all Yard Houses to have poor service, so suggest corporate implement a revamped training and process evaluation.  Seems to be enough workers, so that is not the problem that I usually see. The beers seem warm, and are in warm or room temp which makes it go down more slowly, and when it is gone, if you are not at the bar, it will sit empty for a long time.  The food is only okay for the price.  There are better places including in Town Square.  Oh and lastly all Yard Houses have acoustics that make it very loud, so hard to carry on conversation with a group."

Plus there are so many other choices to try to come here regularly.\n\nOh the music they play (mostly classics) is very  very loud.  It didn't bother me, but my husband was really annoyed by it."

And if you still aren't convinced, imagine big delicious portions and an amazingly generous happy hour menu. Two friends and I recently enjoyed a late evening dining experience: Chicken Nachos, Margherita Pizza, Bernaise Sliders, Tomato Bisque, 2 beers and a martini = under $50 with tip. \n\nGreat atmosphere and plenty of TVs for those who want less conversation and more game time. When the weather is nice, grab a seat outdoors and enjoy some people watching. Even when the weather isn't so nice (just for a few short months in Las Vegas) there are conveniently located outdoor heaters, as in they are out of your way and you won't burn yourself after stumbling out because you sampled all 150 beers.\n\nTo my not-so-crazy-about-beer-people: take it from someone who doesn't care for beer. Do you like juice? Carbonation perhaps? I highly recommend giving the Lidemans Framboise or Strawberry Fruli a try. I promise you won't even notice its beer. If that doesn't work out Yardhouse has a great selection of mixed drinks and martinis. Try the Gobbstopper Martini or the Black Orchid Martini. \n\nAnd remember people: always drink responsibly :)"

After looking over the menu we decided to stay seeing that everyone was able to find something they could settle with for the late lunch.  The menu selections seemed ok but something you can find almost anywhere. Typical burgers, sandwiches, salads, some steak and seafood options as well.  \n\nI decided on the Lamb burger with the feta cheese which gave the burger a different and savory flavor.  The meat was tender and seasoned well.  The fries were these little toothpick looking things that were not as satisfying as they looked.  I guess I prefer a steak style fry something with a little more carbs I guess.  \n\nThe service was sufficient, a little slow at times but there was a football game on that allowed the time to pass.  However when you have a family the kids do not find equal enjoyment.  We might try this place again, but I am not sure if I would go out of my way to visit.  Maybe for the Happy hour they have tons of beer choices.  I don't care for the big crowds of rowdy people that do not know how to handle their booze."

While the beer and menu are the same, the atmosphere is much more relaxed and mellow than the one on the strip, as expected. I dined for lunch on the weekend and found myself really wishing it was happy hour because they offer such great portions at a discounted price. \n\nOur table ordered a few salads and sandwiches, a burger, and macaroni and cheese. No complaints about the food; the portions are great and the food was tasty. The menu in general is pages long and offers a little bit of everything with convenient half and full size options. \n\nAs for the beer, this place has it all! I discovered a very special watermelon IPA that was only $8/pint and 10%ABV! One pint did the trick and it was really fun choosing from the pages and pages of specialty beer on tap. They do offer 2 free samples, which I didn't realize, so I'll be sure to take advantage of this on my next trip.  \n\nI think I definitely prefer the other location; my fun-meter wasn't as high while dining here, but I would be sure to come back if I'm ever shopping at the Town Square outdoor mall."

You can go there just about anytime and have some great appetizers, entree's or dessert!  It's usually busy at night any time on the weekend so get there early.

Lets start with the lobster sauteed in garlic butter; dried out piece of rubber that once looked like a piece of lobster. Hamburger, medium rare was more like medium sawdust burger. Little flavor with zero juices.  The one stalk of asparagus was okay. The fries were somewhat good. I don't know where they hid the bearnaise sauce but it wasn't on our plates.

The puff pastry was underdone, so it was greasy and not very edible. There were far too many leeks in the dish, so it tasted like turkey and onions which is not bad for me since i love onions, but it was just lacking in other flavors.

The chicken nachos were delivered on a huge plate!  This plate alone would have actually been enough for both of our stomachs to be filled.  They had a great combination of ingredients with plenty of chicken spread throughout the nachos.  Fabulous! \n\nThe sliders came out with 4 on the plate and a side of shoestring fries. I didn't see that fries were included so that was a bonus.  Plus I love shoestring style french fries.  Yum.  The sliders were just ok.  I almost wish we ordered the classic style sliders.  Yes I did love the bearnaise sauce that accompanied the sliders on the side but the burger itself was very plain.  It still enjoyed them.  \n\nTheir dining area itself is spacious and roomy.  There are plenty of seating inside and on their outdoor patio.  Everything was kept very clean and tidy! It doesn't hurt to see their keg room when you first walk in...  puts a smile on my husbands face!  It is a great place whether you are visiting or a local."

Ample indoor and outdoor seating with enough TVs to watch any and every sports game.\n\nWith their burgers, Asian influenced fare, pastas, and Gardein selections, their menu has something for everyone and it's just a matter of deciding what you want most. Eventually, I settled on a surf and turf burger, which has a beef patty topped with lobster, grilled asparagus, and a swiss and tomato b\u00e9arnaise. The burger was all right, but I should've gone with my gut instinct and ordered the pepper jack burger. I dipped my fries into the b\u00e9arnaise instead of putting it on my burger. Oops. Let me just say that I'm just a sucker for crisp fries and savory dipping sauces.\n\nFigured I might as well get a drink since I could walk it off around Town Square. One hpnotini for me please! It's a balanced mix of pineapple juice, pineapple rum, hpnotiq, and vodka. Basically, sweet + fruity + alcohol = girly drink. I'd drink it again, but I'd want to try their Snake Bite, the birthday guy's favorite, before making repeat orders.\n\nEven with about 20 or more people in our group, the wait staff never stopped being accommodating, patient, and attentive. Major kudos to them for being amazing to us despite having a full house on a Saturday night.\n\nCelebration or not, Town Square's Yard House is a hot and casual spot for watching the game with some pals or get-togethers for a meal."

Even though there's a bunch of outposts of this Irvine, CA based chain in LA (including the new LA Live location downtown) I've never been to Yard House before. Shame on me, I know. They've got their own microbrewed beer in two varieties and a great Late Night Happy Hour so prices are really good if you come in late for drinks or apps. Another thing I like is you can get a sample shot of any brew for a buck. Which is what I did as i sampled four different beers including Vegas' own Sin City. Bartender was actually upfront with me that it wasn't that great a beer but when in Vegas, try the local stuff and for a buck, why not? So I tried the Sin City Amber and it was fair alright but at least it wasn't downright atrocious. Surprisingly, Tenaya Creek isn't offered here. They should do something about that. Also odd. They carry Gordon Biersch. Don't they have their own brewpub just a couple miles away? Waste of taps in my opinion. Plenty of variety and a chance to really improve your brew knowledge. I've got to finally check one out in the LA area sometime soon especially that the LA Live location is now open."

I knew that I would enjoy this place immensely.\n\nThe Yard House is in a nice location. It's away from the main Strip, down near the airport, but not too far that a taxi ride is too expensive. We didn't check out any of the shops around the restaurant but it did look like somewhere worth coming back to.  We didn't have a reservation, but received a booth with no hassles or wait time. It was a Sunday night and there was a football game on and the restaurant was very busy and noisy, but our waitress told us that everyone usually left as soon as the game finished, which they mostly did. Our waitress was extremely helpful and friendly and gave us some delicious suggestions for beers to try. \n\nFor dinner I ordered the Rib Eye, which was delicious and my vegetarian wife had the BBQ \"Chicken\" Salad. There is a massive selection of vegetarian meals on offer here, which apart from the beer was the main reason we came here. Both of our meals were very nice indeed.\n\nAfter several beers and a perfect amount of food later we left the Yard House very full and very happy. The only downside to the whole night  was that our first very friendly waitress finished her shift shortly after we ordered our first beers. The waitress that took over from her was far from friendly and barely paid any attention to us all night. This wasn't enough to take away from a great night and if we're ever back in Vegas we will definitely be making a return visit here."

Combination of Guinness and Blue Moon.  Honestly I just got it because I hoped Edward Cullen would come sprinting around the corner.  Kidding...or am I?  No, seriously though, it was a great beer.  Not too sweet, not too bitter.\n\nThe atmosphere:  It's a pretty live joint, day or night.  Can't tell the locals from the tourists; don't really care.  Everyone's there for the same thing.\n\nGreat place for girls night out because according to Maria, Yardhouse gives out condoms because their waiters are fiiiiiinnnnnnnnnne.  I'm not gonna disagree with her, but I try not to leer at the employees.  Call me crazy but I think drooling into my buffalo wings while I'm undressing Timmy/Justin/Brad with my eyes would be considered rude.

They have nice cushiony booths so if you and a date come by then you can have a semi-romantic dinner on one of those. Want to sit outside? They have a nice patio area in which they have heaters for the chillier days. They have TVs all over the place with different channels. Games are on most of the time. If you want to watch a specific game on a specific TV, all you have to do is ask.\n\nI'm not a big beer person. But Yard House is the one place I will indulge in a glass (or two...or three...). My favorite beer is the Lindeman's Framboise. A Belgian lambic beer, it has the perfect cidery raspberry taste. They serve it in some sort of champagne glass - it makes me want to pinky up because I feel almost sophisticated drinking it! I also love their fruit ciders, especially their pear cider. The Snakebite is also divine - it's a blend of the pear cider and harp. Besides their beer, they have pretty good specialty mixed drinks. One that comes to mind is their Pomegranate Margarita. Tart and pomegranite-y with a pretty presentation!\n\nTheir food awesome! My faves are listed below:\n\n[Before i list specific food items, I'd like to say that Yard House has really really good fries. They're super thin and super addicting. If you're into the thick cut steak fries, you won't find them here]\n\nAppetizers\n- Seared Ahi Sashimi: About 6 pieces of seared tuna covered in soy vinaigrette is served next to a small bed of red cabbage also covered in the vinaigrette. I really like this dish when it's made right. Sometimes they over-drench the sashimi pieces and the dish becomes ultra salty.\n- Onion Ring Tower: Literally, the name says it all. It's apparently beer battered and comes with a chipotle ketchup and ranch dressing. \n- Spicy Tuna Roll: If you're expecting a typical sushi roll, then don't. This is served without rice and as a stack. Bottom layer are edamame and cucumbers. Middle layer is your tuna and the top layer is the avocado. It's a pretty dish. Very innovative. \n- Sliders: Specifically the bearnaise or ahi sliders. Four sliders plus a handful of fries. They call this an appetizer, but the portions are not appetizer-like!\n\nEntree\n- Mac & Cheese squared: Chicken, bacon, mushrooms, truffle oil. Can't go wrong with this one. They use wild mushrooms that elevated your boring mac & cheese to the next level. \n[This is it for entrees. I usually stick with their appetizers.]\n\nDessert\n- Chocolate souffle: Small souffle good for one. Scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with mint garnish. Do not leave without trying this. I'm seriously serious. \n\nYard House has great happy hour. 3 PM - 6 PM Monday - Friday and 10 PM - close Sunday - Thursday. Drink specials and half off on a lot of their appetizers! Their sliders are discounted as well. Perfect late night meal."

A lot of places serve really small portions for their lunch specials or Happy Hour but I think this place does it right and gives you huge portions hoping you stay around long enough to drink up a nice tab. I for one am willing to fall into this trap any day of the week as long as their food stays on point.

Yuck.  After that experience I received an e-mail from the manager apologizing and offering a free dinner.  I never responded and hadn't been back since.  I don't want free things, I just want your kitchen to send out non-moldy bread!\n\nAnyhow, my Mom and I were in the area and decided to stop in on a Sunday night for dinner.  It was pretty crowded, but we were sat immediately and approached by a friendly server, who took our drinks/appetizer order.  I have to add....if you know anything about beer, the list is nothing but long.  There is really nothing exciting about it.  Anyhow, our beers came out quickly and our server took our order.  I figured our app should be out any minute, but instead we sat there waiting and waiting and waiting....until BOOM! Our entrees came out.  We told the food runner that we never received our app, and he said he would be happy to take our food back and have our app sent out, or he could just make sure we aren't charged for it and leave our dinner.  Uh, no....we are hungry and ordered an app, we want it.  So he takes our food back and I start worrying that I am going to either end up with moldy bread again, or our entrees were going to sit under a heat lamp until we were ready for them.....I saw our server talking with a Manager, who then came over to our table to apologize for the error and that our crab/lobster/artichoke dip would be out momentarily and that she would ensure our meals were made fresh. (Also that the app would be no charge) Once we received it, the dip was really good and it disappeared quickly.  Our entrees were fresh when we received them, and I did not have moldy bread. (WHEW!) Our server also apologized and said that it was his error, which I know isn't easy.  Now, all of this may not seem like that big of a deal, but after my previous experience and having not returned to the restaurant in over a year after the moldy bread, it is just really disappointing.  I used to go to Yard House almost every Sunday with a big group of friends, and we loved the food and service.  Now it seems like both have gone downhill and I am not sure if I will find another reason to go back.  It was very generous of the manager to comp our app, but I am not looking for free food.  I just want my order to come out correctly, in a timely manner, and without mold. Is that too much to ask?  Apparently so.  Unfortunately, I think that Yard House has gotten lost in the shuffle of getting tourists in and out as quickly as possible....\n\nJust an FYI....I was a server in college and I understand that mistakes happen.  Our server still received 20% tip after this debacle, as I only thought it was fair to tip based off what the check would have been, if the appetizer would've been charged."

It was 13 of us so I took them to Ellis Island Casino and restaurant for cheap food, but they couldn't take our group. The manager giving us all kinds of excuses. So I called Yard house to see what they can do they said no problem. Food was great as usual It was a little hard to find in the huge out door shopping area but we go there, and it was great. Would definitely recommend to any one. Especially beer lovers, they have many beers on tap. I love the big beer section in the menu."

I love the atmosphere and the one draw back is that it seems everyone else always has the same idea to go when I do.  So my only suggestion is to arrive to be pleased, have fun, and above all patient to be seated or find a spot at the bar.  \n\nMy most recent excursion was for an ill advised late night snack that had me succumb to the delicious Calimari.  I do love to order this dish in many places but I always love how here it's prepared fresh and hot, and rather quickly and accompanied with the spicy tomato and tartar sauce.  I love the plentiful dipping sauce and attentive service for more on request.  I also appreciate how this is a place that serves fresh brewed ice tea for those of us in a hiatus from imbibing the many beers available on tap. \n\nSo if you're a drinker, have plenty of hungry friends, love ice tea, and just want a fun time, check out Yard House."

I love the selection of beer and when you go you HAVE to get your beer in the half-yard glass. It's a must. The best/worst part about it is when you get towards the bottom of your beer the glass acts more like a beer bong. The liquid just shoots down your throat. I guess it makes the experience more fun. \n\nThe food was good. We just got a bunch of appetizers. \n\nSliders: Theses were okay, not out standing. \nAsian glazed chicken wings: YUMMIE! They were my favorite but a bit spicy. \ncoconut shrimp: You get like two shrimps.. okay maybe three and they weren't that good. \nMac and Cheese: Yummie!

However, I was VERY disappointed to find out that happy hour was not being honored.  My birthday is on St Patricks Day and the server informed me that there was no happy hour because it was a holiday.  I informed the server that it's not a national holiday and there happy hour policy on their menu does not state that holidays are not included.  We were not informed when we entered the restaurant that there was no happy hour.  We were also not informed when we were seated and our first orders were taken that there was no happy hour.  If my husband had not inquired if a certain beer was on the happy hour menu, I believe we would not have been informed that happy hour was not being honored.  \n\nMy evening was ruined because there was no happy hour.  I did not want to order as many items as I would have liked because there was no happy hour.  My husband did not want to cause a scene that evening so I did not ask for a manager that night.  \n\nThe food that we did order was good for the most part, but it wasn't great.  We ordered the spicy tuna and california roll.  The spicy tuna was good but the california roll's rice was hard and undercooked.  The hummus lacked flavor.  The only really good thing I ate was the jamaican jerk wings.  \n\nThe next day I called other Yard House's in Las Vegas and the one at Red Rock informed me that they honor happy hour on holidays, it just depended on which holiday.  They said it was at the manager's discretion.  They said that they had happy hour but only from 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. and not the late night happy hour.  I also called Blue Martini, McFaddens, and Buffalo Wild Wings who said they had happy hour on St. Patricks Day.  \n\nI then called the Yard House at Town Square and asked to speak to a manager.  I spoke to Leo and he informed me that the policy for no happy hour came from corporate.  He informed me that customers were being informed at the door that there was no happy hour and I informed him that was not the case with us.  He explained there was nothing he could do for me because corporate sent that policy.  He informed me that no Yard House in the country had late night happy hour on St. Patrick's Day.  I asked him for the number to corporate and thanked the manager for his time.  \n\nI then called four other Yard Houses in the country and three out of the four said they had happy hour both early and late, even though it was St. Patrick's Day.  I contacted corporate and left a message since it was after hours.  I waited 2 days but heard nothing back.  I called corporate again on Friday, March 21 and spoke to customer service who researched the information for me.  He was first unaware of the policy so he said he would contact the Yard House in Town Square and give me a call back.  After calling back he informed me that there may have been some miscommunication and that he was new and that is why he may not have heard of the happy hour policy for St. Patrick's Day.  He asked if the manager at Yard House did anything for me and I informed him that he did not.  In the end, he said he would do more research and send me some gift certificates in the mail.  \n\nAs of 3/28/14.  I have not received them but he did say they would take approximately 7-10 business days.\n\nAll in all, I was just very disappointed with the way they went about the happy hour policy.  They should have made a sign out front or placed a note on the menu, or trained ALL STAFF to inform EVERYONE before they were seated."

Our server was so sweet and friendly and paid us just the right amount of attention during our meal.  Then there's their pudding -oh my goodness their pudding!  I'd have to say it's the second yummiest thing I've ever eaten, only behind the salty caramel macaron ice cream sandwich from Ginger Elizabeth in Sacramento.  I shared the pudding with someone on this particular visit but not next time! :p  If you are a caramel lover like I am get that dessert for sure!  For my entree I ordered their mac and cheese which you can't go wrong with.  I love that they now have a smaller less expensive portion of the mac and cheese which I still found to be quite a bit of food!  I've enjoyed drinks and other entrees at a Yard House back home in Northern California and I think it's safe to say that their food is consistently good from one location to the next.  I definitely enjoyed my meal here and our server made the experience that much better!"

It was crowded, but not packed, which was nice since we got a late start. The hostess said 20-30 mins and we were seated in 10. There are plasma TVs everywhere here, so I can't imagine there being a bad seat in the house to watch a game. \n\nIf I were designing the perfect sports bar (for me at least), this place would be the model. Start with the beer. The selection is impressive. You can take a beer tour of the world without leaving your seat. If you aren't sure where to start, do the 6 pack taster. \n\nThe food?  I think the hardest part about ordering is picking something. All of the appetizers looked delicious. We had the lobster, crab and artichoke dip. Excellent choice!  E, who is a salad connoisseur, had the walnut pear salad.  R had the sliders.  Both were excellent!  I had the BBQ bacon and cheese burger.  That burger is now on my \"top 5 burgers I've ever had\" list.  The meat was full of flavor and juicy and the rum BBQ sauce had a nice tang to it.\n\nThe atmosphere?  Nice and clean inside, with an upscale feeling to it.  The clientele was a good age mix, attractive and dressed like they actually cared about their appearance.\n\nLast but definitely not least, the service.  Our server was great.  I think her name was Cyndi.  She was attentive without being intrusive and best of all, when it comes to us at least, she was patient.\n\nThe bottom line?  I wish they would seriously consider a location in Northern California.  Might I suggest the Streets of Brentwood Shopping Center?  This is definitely in our rotation of Vegas places to go when we're there."

That being said...Town Center Yard House gets the fourth star rating because of it's proximity in relation to everything around: shopping, movies, and bars. \n\nHere, Yard House is the perfect addition to a night out at the mall. \n- Gone shopping? Get a beer. \n- Seen a movie? Get some dinner. \n- Headed to the Blue Martini for a Natural Vibrations concert? Drink here first.\n\nThe ambiance here is always great: kind of like a dark SUPER SIZED PUB full of beer selections from around the country, hell even the world. \n\nThe food is as I said before, comfort food (or it could be the only things I decide to order). My usual order consists of either the Mac and Cheese Squared, Turkey Pot Pie, or Grilled Cheese (with bacon and tomato)/tomato soup. The M&C2 is perfect, what more could one ask of pasta, cheese, bacon, chicken, and truffle oil...brilliance in every spoonful. Turkey Pot Pie is an entire plate of turkey, cream sauce, and veggies covered in a flaky fresh crust. And Lastly, the grilled cheese is the perfect accompaniment of a cold day...or cold beer. Speaking of beer, try the sampler. Daily, the beers of choice switch up so enjoy the variety. \n\nService is quick with the drinks, courteous, and fun to be around. \n\nYard House in Town Center exceptional. Beware, place gets crowded pretty quick. Give it a try and see how new age comfort food is made."

A few minutes later, she finally decided to walk towards it after she was done chatting about things that were absolutely not work related.\n\nOnce at our table, our magnificently pathetic server didn't even bring the 4 of us waters for a solid and literal 25 minutes. I did however get my beer in the meantime. \n\nWe ordered food, and while we were all eating and drinking, the waters still never got refilled but once over a 4.5 hour time span. The waiter went out of his way to avoid our table because I think he acted as if we were way to demanding. I know that getting drink refills and taking food orders is a tough gig, but that's your job.\n\nWe asked for our bill to be split between the 2 couples, and ours came out about half correct when he brought it out the first time. Then 5 of my buddies friends walked in the door and stood around to say hi because they'd not seen each other for years. When our waiter came back, I asked him to correct the bill and supplied my card to be charged the correct amount while my friend paid him cash for his portion. When it came back being delivered by another waiter, I'd been charged an 18% gratuity for a tab from a party of 9 (because of the standing friends), and my buddy didn't get anything back!\n\nThe waiter had left because the place was closing, that's what he charged, and I was basically told that they didn't have time to remove the gratutiy and that they could charge it even if there was not a group over 8 people, and my friend was out $14 in his change because the guy just kept it.\n\nI'll never go back here again. They were terrible service, and terrible people. If you just did your job correctly in the first place, you wouldn't have to go out of your way to steel your tips from people."

I went here with a friend and my boyfriend and we loved the sliders and the sweet potato fries. The few times I got burgers they were pretty good; no real complaints about the burgers. But I wanted to try something new (big mistake) so I decided to order the Ahi Tuna Crispy Salad (something along those lines). Our server was great, which made not enjoying the food kind of a flop. \n\nWhen I received the salad, the tuna was sliced into maybe 1/4 inch pieces and the edges of each piece was covered in pepper. I do not like a whole bunch of pepper so that was a big disappointment for me. Also, they saturated the salad in salad dressing. I had to send it back because it made it very difficult to each and extremely unappetizing. I tried to enjoy it after they fixed the drenching of the salad and put the dressing on the side, but it was still difficult to enjoy the food. I was highly considering asking them to change the salad into the sliders but I  didn't want to wait even longer to get my food because we waited a while to get my salad and my friend's burger. I was very disappointed and would not recommend getting that salad. I almost did not want to pay for the food because I felt that I did not enjoy the food and I wasted the tuna :("

By the time we sat down and got comfortable, our pager went off, and to the table we ventured.\n\nWeaving through groves of people, we arrived at a table toward the back of the restaurant, furthest from the kitchen. I think the host was trying to talk to us during the trip, however, it is so ungodly loud in there, that I couldn't hear a word he was saying.\n\nFlipping through the menu, neither of us remembered it being that expensive and of course, our lack of decision making skills due to hunger kicked in again and nothing looked good.\n\nI, for the second time in the night, settled and chose the four cheese pizza. One type of food that I had expressly stated I did not want prior to arriving. Oh well, can't win them all.\n\nIt seemed to take forever for our server to bring two glasses of water, almost as if they made her go to Lake Mead, fill a jug with water, bring it to a purification center, then make some ice cubes and finally, deliver filled ice water glasses to our table.\n\nOur orders were taken and again, it seemed like an eternity for the food to get delivered. It was an OK pizza, about what you would expect from a non-pizza-centric establishment. I did find it odd though, that the crust was soaked with grease or water or something, and was as flimsy as a wet noodle.\n\nFinishing the food, the service seemed to pick up, plates were cleared almost the instant they were clean, the check was dropped off, a moment later, was picked up, with our payment. Then... the waiting began again. I think Yard House makes the staff bring the credit cards to the issuing bank to extract their funds.\n\nOnce we were able to reclaim our card and head to the exit, the wife was almost bowled over by an employee that was on a mission.

There are these little U's next to menu items that are under 600 calories, and to my pleasant surprise, they had a 5 oz. turkey burger with a salad with cirtrus soy dressing with a U next to it.  Fan-effin-tastic!!  I ordered it, despite thinking of every dry, tasteless \"healthy\" burger I've ever eaten.  My expectations were low.  Granted, I've never ordered anything at Yardhouse before that I didn't like, but the pessimism from my experience with healthy non-beef burgers trumped my consistent satisfaction with the food from Yardhouse.  \n\nOur meals came quickly and my neat little plate of burger and salad (with dressing on the side, which I didn't even ask for, thanks server!!!) actually looked quite delicious.  Upon my first bite, I was in heaven!  It was juicy, tasty, delicious goodness in my mouth.  It came topped with roma tomatoes, which I think really sealed the deal.  At 5 ounces, I finished my entire plate and felt perfectly full, unlike most of the time when I go out to lunch and overstuff my face.  I was so happy that I promptly forgot about the annoying sales rep I had dealt with at a meeting earlier that morning. I was ready to go back to work with a renewed pep in my step.\n\nThe service at Yardhouse is always fast, efficient and friendly.  Although, I used to have this one server that would always try to upsell shots and drinks during my business meetings.  It was quite awkward, but I haven't seen him the last few times I've been, so maybe he quit when he realized the lunch crowd here was not exactly his demo.  We've always been able to get a table quickly for both lunch and dinners.  I also love sitting at the bar sometimes at night and trying new beers from their vast selection.\n\nYardhouse is just an all-around great spot!"

I've been to yard house many times in California, however it's now in Las Vegas in the town square center. \n\nThis place was packed, sure the games were on and with a place having 160 beers on tap one could imagine it would be. This is their strong point, all their beers on tap and they have tastings of the different beers as well. \n\nWorkers have good personality and the food is brought out quickly."

She thought it would be really cool to take me to the Yardhouse because they have so many taps and seem to be a fun place. We were seated fairly quickly and our waitress was very nice. But it took about 15 minutes to even get our drink orders. And then we order appetizers and our meal. That took a while as well and the food was definitely nothing to write home about. The calamari and squid were tough and chewy, and the lobster/crab dip was way to salty! I got the seared ahi sandwich and couldn't even eat half of it, the tuna was dry and overcomes and the dressing was not good. My mom got the baha fish tacos with rice and beans. They were also less than appetizing. Especially for the price! Way overpriced for what you get! I order another beer when our entrees were brought out and it didn't even arrive until we were finished and ready to leave. Yes, this place a great variety of excellent beers, but would definitely not recommend it!"

The servers were very friendly and accommodating. Everyone ordered the yardstick($13 for 2 glasses of beer) while I drank my water since I wasn't in the mood to drink. I ordered the steak and shrimp which I rarely order but since we were splitting the check, it wouldn't be fair if I paid $66 dollars for a pizza or a chicken pot pie. Which by the way, the chicken pot pie is HUGE! \nOverall, the restaurant is spacious for big parties.\n\nMet up with my friend last night. Ordered the calamari since I wasn't that hungry. I must say, not really a martini person since some bartenders make it really strong. But my friend introduced me to the Georgia Peach and Hawaiian sunset and absolutely LOVED IT! Not too strong but a creeper, so beware. \nMy bf ordered the lobster burger and it was surprisingly delish! \nWe also had the same server from a couple of weeks ago which she also was fantastic!"

Yet, the grub and half bad either.  \n\nI tried almost everything on the menu and can't go wrong with the Chilean Sea Bass.  The bad boy is one of the priciest items on the menu though.  There is also great appetizers from poke to street tacos...good for complimenting your choice of beer.  \n\nThe Yard House in the Town Square is always bustling and nearly impossible to get a table without some sort of wait.  The happy hour menu is pretty good as well.  I usually just take up the standing room along the bar.  \n\nThe countless screens should cover all your sports needs, and if not, the helpful staff should be able to flip the channel to your desire.  \n\nStill, the main reason I come here is for the beers.  My favorites include Delirium Tremens, Chimay Cinq Cents, Trois Pistoles, Gulden Draak and a special offering of Firestone Sucaba (limited offer).\n\nI have visited the other location at Red Rock and noticed that they seem to be less packed.  Either way, they are perfect for pre-funking, dinner, or whenever you get thirsty.\n\nP.S. put the waitlist buzzer pager in your pants to get an unexpected surprise!  Never gets old..."

It wasn't hot (Vegas weather) since there were mists to keep us cool. However, when they turned it off, the water kept dripping and splashing us.  We were irritated so we placed napkins on the area the water falls to prevent from splashing us. We informed our waiter about it and he said that it's been an ongoing problem and it's still in the process of being fixed.\n\nDj was our waiter for the night. He was very nice in the beginning. Yard House is known for their beers on tap. I wanted to try something new. I asked Dj for a recommendation. He served me 2 tasting beers. Unfortunately, I only remember one of them, Leffe Blond. When I asked Dj what it was again, he was unsure and couldn't remember the name. I was a little confused since he was the one who recommended the beers to me but yet he forgot the name of it.\n\nYard house is very pricey. Luckily, we were there during happy hour. I ordered the Pastrami Sliders ($7) with Sweet Potato Fries. The sweet potato fries were delicious! It took very long for the food the come out. Once the food came out, the sweet potato fries were hotter than the sliders. The sliders were very disappointing. I was expecting much from the sliders, but it only had pastrami and cheese. The sliders were also cold!\n\nMy sister also ordered dessert (Souffl\u00e9 & Creme Brulee) togo. Everything was paid for already. Dj never came back to check on us to see if we received the dessert order. Instead, we had to ask one of the busboy to check on our to-go order. Keep in mind we were waiting for 30 minutes already & we ordered the dessert before we were done eating. The busboy followed up and said that they were packing the dessert. After another 20 minutes, we finally received our order from another waiter & not Dj. Dj never came back after we gave him the money. \n\nI was very disappointed with the waiting time and the service from our waiter. It felt like our waiter didn't want anything but the payment & his tip. His service was not consistent."

The carried a Woodchuck Autumn blend which can be hard to find in specialty stores let alone a restaurant.  They also have many different wines and a full bar so no worries if you don't prefer beer.  The food has always been great.  On past occasions I've tried the fish tacos (yummy), Cobb salad (had a twist to your traditional Cobb with edamame beans and corn on it), and blackened salmon with a mango salsa (excellent flavor).  There can be a bit of a wait to sit outside but there's usually a spot or two at the bar where you can wait.  Usually don't have to wait more than 5-10 minutes even on a busy night.

Well, if you bring a big group or if you're sharing for 2.  You can get about 3 to 4 dishes for almost $13.00.  \n\nThe atmosphere of this place is ok, if you like that fast paced and loud noise ambiance.  It's tolerable, and I have yet to experience bad service.  The servers are quick to get your order, great with drink refills, and the food comes out in less than 20 mins.  (*QUICK NOTE: NEVER EAT HERE, NOT UNLESS IT'S HAPPY HOUR, otherwise you'd be paying $10 - $15 for appetizers and entree's*) \n\nThings to Order:  \n- Chicken Lettuce Wrap - Ground chicken sauteed with diced mushrooms, onion leaves, and spices, served upon a fried wonton bowl accompanied with 8-9 lettuce wraps.  There are three types of sauces, I think regular, mild and spicy?  I'm not too sure on that, but the regular sauce is my favorite.  \n\n- Fried Calamari - Nothing too special, but a definite must have for a vast mix.  The calamari is always fried to a crisp, tossed in a salt a pepper mix served with tartar sauce and a marinara sauce I think?  \n\n- Hawaiian Poke Stack - For some reason the fish tastes very fresh, as opposed to other restaurants who try their hardest to execute a poke dish.  Yardhouse I'd say, prepares it well.  Ahi poke tossed in a Hawaiian style marinade, served upon two wonton crisps with soy & sesame oil bean sprouts and carrots.  \n\n- Onion Ring Stack - An onion tower served with two types of sauces: ranch and chipotle.  I personally like the chipotle sauce.  The onion rings are fried to perfection, the onions doesn't slip out of the fried batter.  \n\n- Chicken Nachos - MMmmMm, a huge plate of nachos served with the toppings of a mexican nacho.  The cheese sizzles when served and the chicken is quite succulent, although the pieces should be chopped up a little more.  \n\n- Spinach Dip - My very favorite, spinach and cheese mixed together in a hot mix (not spicy).  Served with largely cut toasted bread instead of chips!  What's even better, they lightly top the bread with parmesan! \n\nThis a definite must go to if you're having a get together.  The food is good, and so is the experience.  Another pro to this, is that after eating you can go watch a movie.  Since the movie theatre is in fact right across the building."

Late night happy hour begins at 10pm until they close. Happy hour here includes a wide range of both food and drink options for a fraction of the price. Unlike some other restaurants, Yard House's happy hour food options are desirable and the portions/prices are reasonable as well. \n\nGive Yard House a visit if you are looking for a drink and a small bite, or just a full on dinner!

If you come during happy hour, fine, the prices are clearly stated on the menu. And actually, during happy hour, the beers are priced fairly, not really cheap, but fair, and the happy-hour appetizers are great deals and delicious. \nBut if you come outside of happy hour, there are no prices listed for beers. There are hundreds of beers and they all are priced differently. Asking a waiter brings a vague response: \"The most expensive one is $8.50 so most of them are less than that.\" But they ain't much less! It's easy to spend $7 on a pint without realizing it. So...insist that the waiter give you the price of each beer before you order. Or, better plan, come only during happy hour."

I have fond memories of many of their locations (Costa Mesa, Irvine, Long Beach and West Palm Beach) and it was always with a crowd, so this is one of those chain places where good times are guaranteed.  \n\nWe went for happy hour since the appetizers were half priced and pints were 3.25.  The beer selection is HUGE and my companion and I had a hard time in choosing something to start with.  One of the two servers taking care of our table suggested we get a \"pre-designed\" sampler.  This is when the bar selects six beers for you, rather than you choosing six, and they stay within a certain medium, such as pale ales, darks, etc.  We wanted something in the medium category.  \n\nThe sampler is something I totally recommend you do if you're undecided about what beer you'd like and you have someone to share with you.  We sipped each beer, rated them accordingly, and decided our top three, in order, were Redhook ESB, Redhook Blond, and Fat Tire's New Belgium.  Since the top two were the New Belgium and the Blond, we ordered pints of each and shared 'em.\n\nAs for the appetizers, we picked up an order of the fried chicken strips and Hawaiian poke stack.  Great choices (kinda hard to mess up chicken strips, though); the poke was a pretty good portion for an appetizer and was tasty!  \n\nBoth of the servers were outstanding in tending to our party of 14.  Very attentive, didn't miss a beat, and were great about reminding everyone to get their last orders in before happy hour ended.  Can't beat that!\n\nIf only the Yard House were in the DMV....."

The first time I tried this restaurant was a few years back, and I absolutely love it.\n\nIf you love beer and some great food, you must try this place.  They serve fresh fish every day and it's cooked to order.  We always have the fresh fish when we eat dinner there.  Lunch time is usually something else, like their mac n cheese squared or some sliders.  What I enjoy about this place is their variety of foods, from american to asian.  \n\nWant to save money and still eat well?  Their appetizers could be a meal in itself!  They are huge portions and things like chicken strips come with fries, anyway, so you can always order a beer and save money on the food. I really do love eating here and haven't tried everything on the menu yet.  I'm looking forward to more culinary adventures here soon!\n\nSome great tips: always ask your server about their favorite beers, or what beer they prefer from lagers, stouts, etc.  They are well versed in their beer and usually their preference is really good.  Another thing--their portions are big, so if you're a small eater order one dish for 2 people.  Seating can take awhile in the evenings, so coming in around 830/9pm may help seat you sooner.  If you want to eat dinner between 5-7 and you can't find parking, just use the valet right next to the restaurant side of town square.  It's open till the early morning and saves tons of time on finding that open space."

That person did not realize the impact on my life that he made when he said the words \"Yard House\".\n\nThis place is located in Town square which is a huge maze.  I have no idea how to navigate around this area, so be prepared for that.  Anyways, we walked in to a lively wonderful atmosphere of people enjoying themselves and just a fun vibe.\n\nWe were seated and were amazed by the beer selection.  This place is like an ale house where they must have like 100 beers on tap.  It was awesome.  The first time we came here we sat in a booth with a really nice waitress.  She was quick, interactive, and knowledgable.  I started off with a beer. The first beer I got was 9 dollars and the second beer i got was 6, so I assume that the prices of the beer vary.\n\nWe tried the asian thai pizza  - which was amazing.  I think asian thai salads and all of those asian dishes taste the same.  The pizza was amazing and extremely flavorful.  It was like 16 dollars or something.\n\nThen we ordered the Bisque and grilled cheese. It was ok.  Average.  Not the best gr cheese and not the best bisque. 12 bucks or so. (The menu w pricing is easily accessible online)\n\nI ordered the Turkey club which was moist juicy and saucy, which i love.  Bottom line - food is amazing here.  \n\nOne final thing of note - My girlfriend is a vegetarian and they have a GARDEIN menu.  This has changed my life forever.  It is a soy protein that tastes JUST LIKE CHICKEN.  I now know gardein exists and its amazing.  Thank you Yard House\n\nThere are tvs all over the bar and are clear as day.  Great place to watch games and anything.  It was awesome."

A good loud - because it's hopping with business!  \n\nMy visit last night gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the service was considerably slow.  The restaurant was full, like always, but the service seemed much slower than ever.  That being said, this place never dissapoints me.  \n\nVisited Yard House last night (Friday night around 6:00pm) for drinks and dinner with friends.  Wonderful time with great food and great beer!\n\nI tried a new dish last night and it was YUMMY!  The Chicken Tinga tacos rock!!  But be ready - they are SPICY!  When a beer restaurant can make some of the best tacos in town, you know you are in a special place!   The mexican rice and beans are excellent as well!  It was one of my favorite meals I've had at Yard House - and I've probably had about 25.  I paired my meal with their House Belgium Trippel Ale - which was very good!  \n\nThe children's menu is very good as well.  We ordered the Mac-N-Cheese for the kiddo, with a side of fruit, and it comes with a drink and an ice-cream dessert for $6.95.  A little on the pricey side of Kids Menus, but the food is top quality kids food!  It's not Kraft macaroni and cheese out of a box - it's homemade with the same cheeses they make the entree meals from."

Now all I'm missing is a chicken dinner.\n\nBut there's a lot more to be had. Like all Yard House menus, the variety spans from Americana to Asian in one giant menu. It's like Cheesecake Factory, but pricier and vastly higher quality. If there is a place to enjoy a killer selection of beer, while ordering everything from Hawaiian Poke to Korean Kalbi to Shrimp Ceviche, let it be here.\n\nAs a venue, this Yard House is stacked. A robust wait staff, plenty of seating all around, with TVs lining the ceilings and corners and game audio for a crowded Monday Night Football viewing. Who ever said this side of Vegas (Town Square) was boring? Certainly not I.\n\nMy hungry and tired of group of frenzy eaters ordered a plethora of random stuff, just as their menu intended:\n\nChicken Lettuce Wraps ($12)\nKung Pao Calamari ($11)\nSeared Ahi Sashimi ($14)\nBoneless Wings ($13)\nHawaiian Poke Stack ($14)\nTurkey Club ($11)\nSpicy Tuna Roll ($13)\n\nAll in all, everything was decent. The chicken lettuce wraps were fresh, tasty, and abundant. Wasn't the biggest fan of the kung pao calamari, but folks looking for a different take on fried squid ought to try it once. While the turkey club, boneless wings, and spicy tuna roll (which looked like mofongo!) were somewhere in the middle, the seared ahi and poke stack were the surprising winners of the night. Extra surprising that it tasted like fresh fish all while in the middle of the desert? Most definitely.\n\nWhile I'm not one to frequent chains, I can see myself coming back to this Yard House with beer loving, sports seeking, hungry, good company. Lastly, it's a solid spot that is  within 2 minutes away from McCarran International Airport."

I pretty much love this place.  The atmosphere is great, the music is usually pretty jammin (albeit someone has the top 40 hits on rotation nowadays and I'd definitely rather have the classic rock they usually throw on), and I always seem to run into someone I know.  Now, I'm usually not an advocate for chain restaurants but the Yardhouse has it's own uniqueness to pride itself on.  What exactly am I talking about you ask?  THE BEERS: the main reason why I commute well across town to Town Square.  The Yardhouse, aside from the Freakin' Frog on Maryland Pkwy, has the most impressive variety of beers available that I have ever seen.  They have all kinds of different types of beer for every type of palate and for 3.50 domestics and 4.50 goblets/specialty beer mixes during happy hour, that is definitely hard to beat.  I did mention happy hour and I will also mention that happy hour is the best time to go (10 to close Sun-Wed and I'm not sure of the mid-day happy hour but I know there is one).  Select appetizers are half off during happy hour and they even have well drink specials for the spirit and hard liquor lovers out there.  All in all, I must say that the Yardhouse is one of my favorite hangouts and they usually never cease to impress.  I say usually because they did get rid of one of my favorite beers (the Kulmacher Eisbock for those interested) but I guess they have another hundred beers to choose from to help console my woes.  Cheers and happy beer-ing..oh and please drink responsibly ;)"

The food while good is slightly too expensive.\n* Due to the popularity, they're generally crowded with long waits.\n\nI believe Town Square to be the best shopping and restaurant plaza in Las Vegas. The quantity of choices for either is only matched by the quality. There certainly is no shortage of great food at Town Square and on yelp, Yard House is rated best of them all. I haven't tried them all but I can definitely say Yard House is the best I've had yet.\n\nI went with a group of four on a late Tuesday afternoon. They weren't busy or crowded but I have seen the line pour out the door enough times to know I was lucky. We were promptly sat down just time to enjoy the happy hour menu. We ordered their famous tower of onion rings while we sifted through the massive menu. I ordered the chicken salad with a cup of tomato bisque soup. The other members of my party ordered the barbeque chicken salad with a cup of chicken tortilla soup, pastrami sandwich, and a mushroom burger. \n\nWhen the onion ring tower arrived it instantly lived up to the expectations. Thin, lightly battered, crispy onion rings sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with ranch and chipotle ranch. They bursted with flavor to die for. At first the tower seems so incredibly large but when you finish the memory feels small in hindsight. My soup and salad was good with a pleasant, creamy, rich ranch dressing and well-seasoned tomato bisque soup. However, it paled in comparison to the nothing short of perfect, chicken tortilla soup. I have never had a tortilla soup so creamy and flavorful. They put a large piece of avocado in the cup along with the crispy tortilla strips and large chunks of chicken. Together, they blend to create a truly wonderful and hearty cup of soup. I had a bite of the barbeque chicken salad and while it was a bit too saucy for my tastes, the barbeque dressing wasn't overpowering and went well with the large pile of onion strings atop the salad. The pastrami sandwich looked great and the burger looked even better. The burger bun instantly caught my eye with a smooth crisp surface devoid of any grease or sheen. Next time I will surely try a burger. \n\nThe Town Square location is large and wide open. The lighting is dim and creates a hip vibe that went well with the modern menu. Everyone in my group had a few questions about the menu and the server was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help. The prices however are a bit steep and you might want to arrive early to take advantage of the happy hour choices. One specific item that caught my eye was the 17 dollar macaroni and cheese. It looked delicious but it would have to be at that price.\n\nIn the end I walked away satisfied and yearning to return to try a burger or maybe even that posh mac and cheese entree."

It was her birthday and I will be the first to admit she was slightly intoxicated... I would understand if my friend spilled a drink, broke a glass, screamed obnoxiously, or literally fell over in her chair which she did not. She. Did. Nothing.\n\nMy friend was a little tipsy and the manager was quick to judge. I understand that if someone at a bar seems intoxicated it is a liability issue, however, I feel there could have been more professional and polite verbiage used to relay that message. This was not the the case. \n\nLeo was cold and came off rude. The group I was with were all surprised and shocked because as I said earlier, the friend we were with by no means was acting obnoxious or creating a scene. I asked for the man's name who happened to be the manager and he told me it was Leo. He also tried to grab his business card and realized he didn't have one with him. He didn't offer to retrieve one for me either.\n\n... I get it. Working in the restaurant industry I know there are a lot of difficult and intoxicated guests to deal with (I've been a server back in the day myself) however, there is also a thing called empathy and delivery which goes a long way. I don't work in the restaurant industry anymore but I do work in guest service management. The manager could have asked politely what he would have liked to occur, but that didn't happen. I hope Yardhouse management improves because I actually really liked that place. My interaction with Leo really bothered me (still does). \n\nMitch, a bartender working at the time tried to defend Leo and didn't show empathy as well. He event spelt his name out for me because he was very confident in defending why I was wrong to feel offended with my interaction with Leo. Not sure if Mitch understands what the interaction consisted of. He sure was quick to make me feel like I was in the wrong.\n\nUnfortunately this recent experience has really affected my overall experience with Yardhouse. I will not be recommending anyone to this restaurant nor I will be returning. Being a large chain as they are I hope they improve in customer service to retain some loyal business."

Looked great and it did for the most part tasted pretty good. Only thing is it was the same plate of nachos with the one layer of guac just scraped off the plate.

It's no fault of the server. Rest of our orders were pretty good.  But the cook line needs to know that food allergies should be taken seriously. Had I ate anything that even had a smidgen of guacamole, you would've had your guest knocked out on your table."

Ranging from Korean BBQ to Jamaican Jerk. I have never tasted a dish I did not enjoy at Yard House. My personal favorite being their (Mac + Cheese)2. Take your typical mac n cheese, replace the elbow macaroni with some campanelle pasta, throw in some chicken, bacon, truffle oil, mushrooms, and breadcrumbs, and you have the makings one of the best mac n cheese dishes I've ever had.\n\nIt can be a bit pricey at times and it is almost always busy (I've seriously never seen this place have a slow day), but good food and a great beer selection keep me coming back"

That's the first time I've ever gone out to celebrate a birthday and they did absolutely nothing but a snide remark. This was a family affair. The waiter was insensitive. We probably should have called a manager. I've been writing for TripSheet Magazine for 15 years and will let the know in my dining and entertainment column. Some 12,000 cab and limo drivers will know not to take birthday parties to The Yard House. My wife was in charge of organizing and both my wife and daughter reminded the waiter. He still got a good tip. We are loyal customers of this establishment. They sent me a $25 gift certificate so my wife and I came back for a late night dinner. I was between the full rack of BBQ ribs and the rib eye steak and the waiter try the steak. It was juicy and delicious. It came with broccolini with too much salt, mashed potatoes and I guess they forget the creamed corn. My wife had the turkey burger which was good. This place was packed on a Thursday night."

After a failed night at Nu Sanctuary,  (fail on them, not on us) my friends and I decided to head over to Yard House and hang out.\n\nI was sad to find no happy hour, but that was my bad for going so late. :[ This meant that I had to pay full price for my appetizers? I haven't done that in...well, ever. \n\nSince I had to DD, I ordered a plate of fish and chips. I must admit, those were some pretty good fish and chips. It's not THE best I've ever had (check out my Mad Greek review for that), but it is definitely up there.  \n\nI was surprised to find out that their last call is at 1:45.  It reminded me of being in California.  I didn't think any place in Vegas had such an early last call, but since they close (what? they close?) at 2, it makes sense.  \n\nDespite us being there so late, I didn't feel rushed to leave.  I truly appreciate that because so many places are egging you to leave when it comes to the last 15 minutes of business hours.  Instead, they started to clean up around us, close up the bar, etc, but our waiter still came by to see if there was anything else we needed or wanted and even came by past last call just to double check we didn't want anything else.\n\nOverall, I am down to go back. Hopefully, I'll make it for happy hour. :D"

Don't know if every server there is similar but if so, then this place is gold. \n\nMy favorite was the chicken lettuce wraps. FAN-tastic. We ordered plenty of food... 2 different pizzas and crab cakes. The crab cakes were \"o-k\" and the pizzas were what I expected.. but wow those lettuce wraps. I highly recommend them. They have beer \"tasting\" flights, which 2 of our friends ended up ordering. If you are a beer drinker, this place is heaven! I didn't care much for my martini but I think it just wasn't for my taste. \n\nI've had a bite of my friend's take-out turkey burger from here and that is definitely a 5-star turkey burger!

My girl loves cider and enjoy the raspberry Wyders that's on tap. We were here for a friend's birthday party, so our group was pretty large. The service was lacking and they were slow to bring our drinks, food and checks towards the end, but all in all they were able to acommodate our very large group.

Not much going on for such an intriguing dish. \nGlad I had my favorite appetizer (chicken lettuce wraps) and a cup of the tomato bisque or it would have been a total bust. \nSince my guy and I split everything we saved room for dessert. Ordered the baked brownie with a scoop of caramel ice cream. It says that it takes 15 minutes to bake and come out. Ours was about 25.

The following is about my most recent experience. \n\nWe met with a couple of our friends for drinks and dinner on a Friday. We were quoted 25-30 minutes, and were seated in 20. They were pumping people in and out of there quickly and turnover was efficient to say the least. \n\nService is always excellent. Our server this time around was the perfect blend of attentive without being annoying. Despite being incredibly busy, we couldn't tell because he never skipped a beat, never made us wait long for anything, and never seem rushed/hurried/dismissive. \n\nFood is surprisingly good here. The exception being the calamari was rubbery and definitely overdone, and the two dips were rather bland (one was a marinara and one was some sort of jalape\u00f1o something or other). I have had ALL of their pasta dishes, and for a place you would expect to only have \"bar food\" the pastas are DELICIOUS! They are willing to substitute different types of pasta in each dish if you want (I subbed the penne for angel hair). Food prices are $1-2 too high in my opinion. \n\nDrinks: One of the reasons I like this place so much is the beer selection is MASSIVE. I have never had the same beer twice. Only like ciders? Well they have several to choose from of those as well. Beer flights here are also a great idea and affordable. \n\nDefinitely will be back! Especially as it warms up to sit on the patio."

Outside of the happy hour menu, the food is pretty good and a little expensive for what it's worth to us.  Beer Seletction here is ridiculous!  Something like over 100 different one.

This place is nestled in Town Square between Guitar Center and Rave Movie Theatre. \n\nSome may sleep on this gem because of its location. When you think of dining inside of a shopping area and you are not shopping, it can be a deterrent. It's no fun to push through crowds and fight for parking just for a drink or meal. Yard House sits in a class by itself and begs you to push beyond that way of thinking and here's why. Valet parking is available. There's great food choices for every palette and an extensive drink menu that's should be categorized as the winos bible. \n\nThis place is huge. But apparently, not big enough! We pushed our way through a crowd waiting for tables to the bar area. After all, why wait when you don't have to. The bar area offers the perfect view. It sots in the center of the room. It was rectangular shaped with tons of TVs and plenty of seating. Upon sitting, we were immediately greeted by Mitch. Before he could slid a coaster, I inquired about a cider on tap. To my surprise, there were at least six to choose from. Mitch did a good job of describing the makeup of each one which was very helpful. While sipping, I decided to look at the menu (while I could still see). It was huge! .... And admittedly, I am somewhat skeptical of places with tons of options. But, again, Yard House delivered. For starters, we ordered the lobster and crab dip. It was served with a sea of pita bread and chips. The dip was blended with just the right amount of cheese. Each bite was packed with lobster or crab and it was seasoned. More cheese please! I ordered the Mac n Cheese House Favorite (chicken breast and bacon filled pasta served in a mixture of cheeses). It was delicious. Too much to eat in one sitting. If you are not sharing, I would recommend the smaller portion. My compadre chose the street tacos which is served a la carte or as a meal with spicy rice and beans. Mitch pointed out they could be prepared various ways (i.e. on lettuce) and you could mix them up. We went with the pork belly taco and vegetable taco (something Rojos). Notice I said we. After reading the descriptions, we agreed it only made sense to share. Both entrees were worth seven stars easily. \n\nI topped my evening off with a sparkling wine specialty beverage. It was infused with  Chambord which happens to be one of my favorite liqueurs.  If that wasn't enough, I also tried another cider. Shots out to Woodchuck for the Raspberry Cider. It was perfect. Just like the evening. Yard House, rock on!"

The energy's always there making it effortless to have a great time regardless of what the occasion might be.

In their defense, though, the beer list is quite lengthy.\n\nThis particular location has a pretty nice patio with a fire pit outside that makes for some great people watching. I find that every Yardhouse I've been to is always incredibly loud. Maybe it's the cement floors that just ricochet the sound throughout the restaurant, but it makes for the main reason I stay away from these restaurants until a friend drags me along for happy hour.\n\nThe food is decent and I'll give them props for having a wide variety of tastes that goes well beyond your typical bar food. Unfortunately, everything is only decent. People rave about the truffle fries, but for me personally, I've never been into the white truffle oil thing and think it tastes like gasoline - fresh truffles are another matter entirely. \nThe ahi tuna poke bowl is fresh and my favorite thing to order here- light soy sauce, rich avocado, a little bit of crunch and sesame oil.. great success. \nThe ahi tuna burgers on the other hand- which claim to be fresh ahi tuna that is hand chopped - automatically comes cooked well. Who.. in their right mind.. cooks fresh ahi tuna well?! It's madness I tell you, and made those burgers that were once great, completely below par. If you decide to go this route - make sure you specify how you want them done!\nThe deviled eggs were a little sweet, but definitely a fun and unusual choice for a restaurant.\nAhi tuna caesar salad- exactly what you'd expect.\nFrench onion soup - decent, but nothing to rave about. A small bowl with provolone melted over the top, a little lighter broth than most places, the bread was okay. Just okay.\n\nOverall, a good happy hour with something for everyone - even a fire pit!"

Don't feel comfortable at the \"Bar\"? ... well there's dimly lit table seating around the extremities of the interior of the Yard House, as well as outside seating under a covered patio.\n\nIf you're not consuming your liquor at Happy Hour here at the Yard House... you have a lot more money to spare than I do, or you're just being extravagant for no rational reason.

Carrots, Green Onion, Cilantro, Mozzarella, \n      Macadamia Nuts, and Firecracker Sauce as a topping... essentially \n      very, very close to a Vegan Pizza.

Word to the \n      wise... consume this appetizer quickly, or it just turns into mush. \n      Definitely, not as good as one of the many cheap, late-night Taquerias \n      you can find around Las Vegas.\n  Fried Calamari (**** 1/2) An appetizer which I never order because most \n      restaurants usually over-fry the Calamari where it becomes \n      super-tough and chewy... but not that night when we consumed it! \n      Served with spicy Tomato and Tartar sauces.\n  Spicy Tuna Roll (**) Definitely, not a favorite at the table. Not enough \n      Tuna, maybe? Or it could've been the odd mixture of textures with an \n      almost crunchy Edamame. Seared Ahi Tuna with Avocado, Edamame, \n      Cucumber and Wasabi Soy Sauce.\n  Classic Sliders (***) Nothing special here. Four mini Burgers made from \n      Naturewell Natural Angus Beef served with Cheddar Cheese, House \n      Special Sauce, Fries and Pickle. Preparation of the Fries were better \n      than the Sliders!\n\nDo you know what it takes to transport all the Liquor over to the Bar area? As I was looking around Yard House to take some pics...

Being someone who loves rice this bothers me. I really enjoy soft rice with my dishes. It does add a texture and it does prevent the dish from getting soggy but there needs to be a happy medium. The bok choy was cooked well and is roasted. these were so delicious. I have to admit the miso sauce on the rice was pretty salty. It complimented the lightness of bass.\n\nI also had a taste of the pan seared ahi tuna. this was an interesting one. The ahi was cooked to perfection but the bean sauce was exxxxxtremely salty. Unfortunately the individual I was with came to the same conclusion. I have to say that the fish was cooked to perfection and was fresh.\n\nEnvironment was extremely loud and packed. Personally not my cup of tea. For the food it was worth it though."

I also like vegan dishes but I like to add meat to them just for flavor. I ordered the fried calamari, not calamari rings, this one had tentacles and all. Also ordered The vodka shrimp pasta, which it was very good even though I couldn't taste the vodka. (There goes my plan of having food and drink for the price of one.)\nThe beer selection is humongous . Like a kid in a candy store i couldn't decide what to get so I went with the diet coke.\nMy friend ordered some green stuff and some green tea.\nAtmosphere is great!

First off, our server Zack, waited a very long time before he even came to our table, and when he did, he complained about the amount of tables he already had. My friends and I then order the chicken tenders requesting bbq and hot sauce on the side his response was \"can you remind me when the food comes out? The kitchen won't do that, I'll have to do it.\" Why don't you be a little proactive and get it so our food won't get cold while you're fetching the sauce we orders ahead of time. My friend order Korean short rib tacos, a dish she has had many times. When the food came out she questioned it and the severs argued with her telling her it was correct. One even told her to take a bite to double check. They sent out a replacement taco, which looked completely different from the original. Zack still continued to argue it was still correct after the fact, we requested a manager to come over. As soon as the manager looked he said that is a pork belly taco, we then explained out concerns of the entire evening. He then confirmed that the tacos were entered wrong and that he removed them off the bill, he also took 50% off the tab. The manager did a nice job at trying to recover the service, but it will be a long time before I return to Yardhouse, a celebration turned into many issues after another."

            "review": "Big fan of yard house especially this location at Town Square, because it's a usual family friendly spot for happy hour where the parents can enjoy food and a few adult beverages and then walk it off at Town Square afterwards :)  Yet it's also a cool spot to hang with co-workers or friends.  A good mix of either, yet when your their with the family you don't feel awkward because so many other people are having family nights out and then when you are there with adults only, you aren't bothered by all the kids around, which is pretty rare to find a place that can manage to do both at the same time.  Maybe because it's a little dim and louder inside, but either way how the booths and tables are set up it's not too loud where you can't hear each other talk.\n\nHappy hour menu is one of the best I think in town.  A variety of good choices that aren't just appetizer size, but could be full meals, so getting a good amount for what you pay for. \n\nGarlic noodles, poke stack, sliders, onion stack and cheese pizza for the kids are our go-tos.  I have had items off the happy hour menu and those were delicious too.  I don't think I've ever had anything I don't like here.  Recently had the mushroom lettuce wraps while doing the Daniel fast and those were really good as well.\n\nA good local go to spot for us, especially for Family Friday nights at Town Square :)"

All the bartenders Tyler the girl and the black guy that is bald avoids making I contact and never greets.   It a very negative vibe  like they just don't care about hospitality. Tyler fine came by and handed me a menu, the neglected to return to see if I'm ready to order or sample, finally when Tyler returned  I asked if I can sample the house honey blonde. She grabs a goblet instead of the sample cup so I had to informer her that it was just a sample and that's when the attitude started...  I decided  to get a miller lt and when I received it, it had 2 inch of foam so I waited to show her  to ask if she could top it off and when she came  it was deflated. She informed me that she could not do that cause I could have drank some which I hadn't. I told her I never touched it because of that reason, she rolled her eyes and went to fill it.  I thanked her and was going to giver her a tip but after all that forget it! I am a bartender as well  and hospitality is key with a smile..  Hope this will get to management and vouching will be in order.  Thanks"

It's not on the Happy Hour list but it's only $4.  You can't go wrong with that considering truffle oil costs $20 a bottle!  These fries are bomb!\n\n-Garlic Noodes w/ Shiitake mushrooms.  Sounds simple but the dish is really flavorful.\n\n-Sliders.  Pastrami or Classic.  You can never go wrong with these especially at 4 fairly sized sliders for $6.95 during Happy Hour!  They don't come in your natural hamburger bun, they come in sweet rolls; yum!  You can substitute your fries on this dish for more Truffle fries.   That's how I do!\n\n-Ahi Sashimi.  This is good paired with the Garlic Noodles.  \n\nSome other items to try of course are their pizzas.  They're all pretty good, pretty big, and half price during happy hour!  Awesome.  \n\nI like sititng in the booths here because they are a perfect distance from the bar and TVs to watch the current sports games while you eat, plus its a good view to people watch.  Sometimes it's nice to eat outside on their patio as well.  Their brownie dessert is pretty good too if you have room for it! Oh, and don't forget the beer.  They have a wide variety to choose from and you can have a whole YARD size glass to yourself.  Good luck with that!"

In the midst of all of that, I stopped another server to say that I think that drink at the bar is mine and she told me she'd inform my server.... my server comes back to apologize for the wait and she's just waiting on the bartender to actually make it to bring to me... walks over, picks up the SAME martinis and brings it to me.

We came for a friend's birthday and about half our group arrived 20 minutes before the other half so the waiter took our drink orders until the others arrived. About 4 out of the 8 ordered drinks and it took him 30 minutes to finally return with 4 beers - this is no exaggeration. Once the other half arrived he got them their drinks and then we didn't see him for a long while and had to flag him down to order our food. Luckily the food was fast, but that's because our waiter had no part in that. He never once came over to check on us as see if we needed anything else like drink refills or ask if the food was ok. The busboys cleared off our table when we were done and once again we sat and sat and sat waiting for our waiter to come over and bring the check. Once he was done flirting with a group of girls at the next table over he finally stopped by to ask if we wanted the check. After that it took another 20 minutes to finally get the check. I understand we were a large group of people, but it was a Thursday night and it was not at all busy. And I'm sure he had it in the back of his head that he was getting his 18% auto gratuity due to the group, but he could have made a lot more if he stopped by to get people more drinks. \n\nThe food however was good and everyone was happy with their selections.

The wait isn't as long as BJ's, we waited after 8 for a table for 3 for about 20-30 minutes.  However, the prices seem a little higher than BJ's.  My friend who lives out there took bf & I to dinner here since her & her bf eat here all the time.\n\nThough parking was kind of difficult, I love the location of the restaurant in Town Square.  Town Square reminds me of The Grove in LA without the snootiness.\n\nI loved my Cuban Roast Pork Sandwich!  The pork was moist and the pepperjack cheese was melted nicely.  The au ju was a perfect accompaniment...even though the sammie didn't need it because the meat was not dry at all.  It also came with a mountain of crispy shoestring fries.  Oh god, I just looked at the site's nutrition facts for it....luckily I saved half of it for the next day.   Bf thought his BBQ Chicken Pizza was okay.  And my friend always gets the same pasta dish that she enjoys."

            "review": "Until last night's visit to the Yardhouse I was a big fan....now, I'm not so sure, here's why.\n\nA good friend and his fiance were visiting from California and wanted to get together for dinner & drinks.  Since Town Square is located on the Strip, it was a convenient place for us to meet.  Over the past few weeks I've been drinking a lot of IPA's and Chimay and was telling him that the Yardhouse would be a great place for him to give them a try.  Since they don't have a Yardhouse where he lives in California, we were all very excited.\n\nThe Better Half and I met them at the Yardhouse.  It was pretty packed for a Sunday evening but we were able to find 4 spots at the bar in the corner so we could face each other and get seated immediately.  After browsing the beer menu, we decided on a Stone IPA.....the bartender said they no longer had it.  Ok, how about the Long Hammer IPA?  Nope...no longer carry it.  He proceeded to tell me they only had 1 or 2 of the IPA's on the menu because they are in the process of switching out the menu......what?  WTF is that?  I understand changing out the menu, but not being able to offer what you have listed until you make the change.....that's BS!  Especially for a place that claims to have 100's of beers on tap!  Ok.....well, if that's the case we asked for a Chimay Triple....guess what?  They didn't have any!\n\nAt this point I was a little embarrassed because I hyped up this place as a solid \"go to\" place to enjoy new brews and good food.  We settled for a Ranger IPA and called it a day.\n\nFor food we ordered Hot Wings, 4 Cheese Pizza, Jambalaya, and Sliders.  The Pizza was very soggy, even though I ordered it well done....that's the second time we've had Pizza and it come out soggy....we won't order it again.  The rest of the food was good, but not great.\n\nOverall, it was a disappointing night at the Yardhouse.  There are tons of places in Vegas that serve good bar food, but came here specifically for beers that were not available....and that's suppose to set them apart from the rest.  I hope this was an anomaly and not the beginning of a trend."

I sat outside and you have the baseball game on TV looking one way, and the beautiful Town Square center looking the other.  A great place to enjoy yourself and relax, especially with nice weather.  The Town Square location is exceptional and reminds you more of Scottsdale than the normal barren wasteland of Vegas.  This just adds some freshness to this Yard House location.\n\nUpdate: I've been back since and the service was still great.  Got to watch Kobe's final game and the place was locked in on the TVs.

I told him forget his tip, and I spoke with  Eric the general manager, who was partial to staff, and basically said \"get lost\". Bad overall experience."

The prices are a bit higher than most happy hour menus, but the portions make up for it.  Other choices include Ahi Poke Stack, Domestic pints for $3.50, and Calamari.

She was so friendly, fast, and attentive..even with the place being quite busy. My guy got the jumbo shrimp with Indonesian rice and spinach and I got the fish of the day which was the tombo, served with white rice, broccoli, pesto, mango chutney, and another sauce which I don't remember...sorry! \nMoving on, the shrimp dish was excellent! The rice had a lot of flavors and the sauce they had for the shrimp was a wee spicy..yum! The fish on the other hand, was over done and came out a little dry. So we informed Erika, and bam! No problem! She was so sincere and I actually felt bad that I had to send it back, but the guy insisted. They actually gave me a new plate with the perfectly done fish and once again, Erika was there to make sure everything was right! She also made sure our glasses of water never went empty!\nWe finished off the meal with a chocolate souffle and as usual, it was deelish! The whole meal cost us 69 bucks and we made sure we left our server with more than 20 percent! \n\nGreat food, excellent service, equals a great night at Yardhouse!"

Ashley serviced our end of the table and she did a great job, we had three kids in our party and the other server thoughtfully took their orders first since the adults were chatting over drinks and appetizers. We were celebrating a birthday and the other server brought out the birthday cake our party brought and Ashley gave us plates and a knife to cut the cake and boxed it when we were done. I'd been to Yard House at Town Square before, and it delivered the same great experience - sports on the multiple tvs, packed restaurant and bar, knowledge staff and great service. \n\nI give it two stars because my dinner entree was incredibly disappointing. I ordered the cilantro lime shrimp with tabouleh salad and will be honest, I was expecting a more substantial portion for $16.00. What I was served however, was five shrimp, a smear of hummus underneath the shrimp and a large scoop of tabouleh salad over two mid-sized romaine leaves. The (luke-warm) shrimp was very tasty and the chilled salad was fresh, but the five shrimps on the plate were not prawns, they were medium-sized shrimp and I was not expecting there to only be five of them. I was famished and this was not the dinner entree I had expected. \n\nQuite frankly, I would have expected such an \"artful nouveau\" $16.00 rectangular-plated item at a different type of restaurant, not at a loud sports bar type joint. (See my picture)\n\nNext time I will stick to their large Cobb salad or Turkey burger with a cup of soup. \n\nOr I wont come hungry or skip the appetizers."

I have eaten here so many times and had an okay experience.\n\nHowever, yesterday I was there for happy hour with a small group, and we had our share of issues.  First - for whatever reason, the waitress stacked like 7 or more menus on the table, and never picked them up.  As people came to join us outside on the patio, we had to keep moving them on top of the planter divider things that separate the patio from the sidewalk.\n\nWe ordered different flavored teas.  The waitress brought separate ice cups and was very slow to refill tea.  She also never brought the limes my friend asked for twice, until we flagged her and reminded her - she had to write it down.\n\nFor happy hour, they make the chicken lettuce wraps half off but not the mushroom - weird.  So we opted for chicken...and out they came, with the nastiest lettuce cups I have ever seen - completely brown and pink, looking rotten and absolutely inedible.  Since the waitress disappeared, I had to wait like 15 minutes before showing her and asking for new lettuce.  Quite a while later, she brought a plate with nastier, browner, pinker lettuce.  I told her no way, and she took that away to show her manager.  She took that off the bill and replaced it with another item, and luckily the protocol is to have the manager come out.  The manager apologized for the \"bad lettuce shipment,\" but I explained to her that under no circumstances should anyone in the kitchen allow nasty lettuce to be served, especially not TWICE.  I told her I strongly recommend that they do not serve lettuce to another person that day.  I hope she took my advice.  Kinda turned me off....would rather come back for beer than food now."

We had a guest in town with a gluten allergy and found that they advertise a GF menu. Excited to find some place to take our guests, the menu and excitement quickly faded. Their GF menu lists a burger (and sandwiches), but it wasn't really a burger. It was just the patty with a side of lettuce, tomatoes, onion and pickle. That's not a burger, then fries were not an option (oil is used to cook battered onion rings, chicken, etc). So burger and fries, became a patty and salad. Why bother with a special GF menu? You can order the same way off the regular menu, by skipping the fries and say no bun. Other non-GF plates ordered were pretty basic. Wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, especially if our food allergy guest comes back. If you have a gluten allergy, skip this place and go to the Chesesecake Factory in Henderson and get a real burger with the bun and fries...all GF."

My favorites are the garlic lobster noodles, the surf and turf burger (a hamburger with asparagus, lobster and a bernaise sauce) and the \"Spicy Tuna Roll\" which may be the best appetizer in this type of restaurant in Las Vegas. It's basically a deconstructed spicy tuna roll that looks like a birthday cake  - with layers of endamame, cucumber, tuna and avocado. It's awesome, and even my kids like snacking on the endamame before the entrees arrive.\n\nThe beer selection is immense, and it used to be perfect, but I have to take points off because they recently removed Tetley's (one of my favorite beers). But honestly? Any place that has both obscure Belgian ales AND Pabst Blue Ribbon on draft can't be bad.\n\nAs for the kids menu it is what you'd expect, but all the food is just a little better quality than you normally get in a similar restaurant. In fact the mac and cheese is so good (I'm pretty sure there's some truffle oil in there) that your kids might not like it. Though, you'll probably enjoy it the next day for lunch.\n\nI can't vouch for the service in other Yard Houses, but the service in the one in Vegas has always been outstanding. And in the very few instances where we've had a problem, they've taken money off the bill and rectified the situation immediately.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this restaurant, and if you find yourself shopping in Town Square and need a quick place for lunch, it's really the best."

I do like their jambalaya when it's cooked ok and their buffalo boneless wing when they are not overcooked. I used to go there once a week but the raw shrimps on the jambalaya made it become once every 3 months, that was the last drop and we make sure we eat before we go there"

Definitely will be back at least to get some beers as I love fresh beer.  Bottled beer does not do the name \"Beer\" justice.  \n\nAnd the service was excellent all around.  Since we had to wait for a table, we actually hung out at the bar for about 20 to 30 mins.  And since they had so many beers, we needed to ask the bartender for advice.  He was extremely patient with us.  And once we sat down at our table, again, the server, was excellent.

Hello? 5 stars!\n\nI've been to a few of these and the cool thing is that depending on where you are you can taste a few of the local beers along with staples like Stella, Sam Adams Seasonal, etc. \n\nAs far as food goes, this is far from simple bar food. I had the Cuban with tomato bisque and my cousin had the spicy tuna roll. When she ordered the waiter asked, \"Have you had the tuna roll here before?\" she knowingly shook her head yes. The tuna \"roll\" came and let me just say, \"Fabulous!!\" It's shaped like a huge can of tuna not a roll. It has all the ingredients of a spicy tuna roll except for the rice. Instead of rice it sits on a bed of edamame. A delicious red wasabi sauce wraps around it. It's one of those dishes that make you look at your plate and get immediately sad because you didn't order it. Don't get me wrong, the Cuban was amazing but if you like sushi, make sure someone gets that spicy tuna roll! Service was great and there were a plethora of screens for football. Did I mention a yard of beer?"

Tasha was great about turning it on and off if we got too hot. \n\nWe ordered the Pepper Jack burger with roasted pablanos and a fantastically tasty garlic aioli. The fries were awesome. I am not a fry person and will typically leave them for last. I am so glad I ate them first because they were some of the best fries I've ever had a perfectly seasoned shoe string fry. I love super thin cut crispy fries.\n\nIronically the first few beers I mentioned Tasha were not on the menu such as Franziskaner Hefe-Weissbier. Tasha was able to point out a couple of other suggestions but I ended up with my other favorite, Tripel Karmeliet. After living years in Milwaukee I have tried a lot of beers. Yardhouse is great for finding things I haven't had in awhile. \n\nThey make a mean turkey club with fresh ingredients the only low note of the dinner or should I say blah moment was the seared ahi tuna that we had for an appetizer.

The Ahi Poke bowl I'd give a thumbs up. Don't get the burger though , it's was underwhelming. As for their beer selection , it's really something.  They have an amazing amount and the scarffe  Hendrick quadruple was delicious. Great service , great beer , bad food. (Just my experience)"

            "review": "I've been to Yardhouse several times. I like that they have so much beer on tap. My wife enjoys the Rose Gaarden (a mix of framboise and Hoegaarden that is really honestly delicious) and I usually go with the Rogue Hazelnut brown.\n\nThe food has always been solid. The (mac + cheese)^2 is usually good, the hawaiian poke stack is always tasty (their tuna in general is pretty nice), and they can cook a good burger. So why the three stars? \n\nWell, we brought some guests here and found ourselves sort of embarrassed. To be fair, it was a Saturday night and they were very, very busy, but our waiter (Ryan) stood out as rude enough that our guests actually commented on it afterwards.\n\nLest you think I'm being unfair, here's specifically what went wrong, in order.\n\nWe had a party of six and were seated at a round table set for five. The host said he'd have us an extra chair in \"just a second,\" after which I saw him speak to our waiter. Our waiter looked at us and then, presumably, went off to find a chair. I stood there, waiting, for five minutes while I saw our waiter serve drinks and food to other tables, patiently waiting for my chair. I finally had to flag him down and ask for a chair, again, before I got one. This kind of set the tone for the evening, but I didn't know it at the time.\n\nFinally sitting, we ordered drinks. One of our guests ordered a framboise. That's pronounced \"fram-bwahs\" due to the final E. This is important in a second, so hold on. Our waiter replied \"that's framb-wah.\" My wife, looking embarrassed that our waiter had just corrected our guest, told him that no, it's pronounced fram-bwahs. I know this sounds like a silly thing, but \n\n1. she's right, and\n2. she's had people try to mansplain at her that she's wrong before, which is exactly what this dude was doing. \n3. furthermore, in what universe does a waiter correct a guest's pronunciation, even if they are wrong (which she wasn't)?\n\nOur waiter gave her kind of a funny look when she said that. Okay, maybe he's just tired or just had a rude table or something. Not going to let it bother me.\n\nHold on, because this is where it gets weird.\n\nThat's when he started blowing us off. We had to ask for silverware twice after our food showed up and sat there, cooling, with us unable to eat it. He passed our table six times (six times! yes, I counted!) without even offering to refill our drinks until I finally had to flag him down. When he did bring refills, he brought them for everyone except my wife.\n\nExplain that. I'll wait.\n\nLook, bottom line, I'm still going to go to Yardhouse. In fact, we went back a couple of days after, if only to wash the bad taste out of our mouths. I'm not going to let this one dude ruin it for me. But if I get sat in his section again, I'm going to ask to be moved."

It's not good enough to be paid for full price but definitely worth when it's half off lol \nSo we got the chicken nachos, queso dip, chicken wings, spicy tuna roll and California roll. The California is a big giant roll. It's not like a traditional roll. It's just one big roll. The rice was under cooked so we ask them to take it back but literally everything else was great. Best buffalo sauce ever! I especially loved the wings because I'm a chicken person lol \nThey have great quality fish for their spicy tuna roll, they use ahi fish instead tuna bc it's a better fish I guess. \nThe chicken nachos is HUGE, you can check the picture, one order of chicken nachos is enough to share with your whole party. It's ginormous. \nTheir queso dip was really really good. The cheese was a bit spicy, for white people, but it was delicious for me. Haha \nOur server, Mike, was really friendly and helpful. \nThe only thing that I think would be a concern for some people is the loud noise. But then again people only come here for the loudness. Lol bc they have like a million tv in here with sports turned on. Haha \nAnyway, I hope you enjoy it and hopefully this helped. :)"

Yes the food is amazing atmosphere is amazing but dude where is the amazing service to go along with the rest of the amazing things to this place. I have been to yard house probably a dozen times. I'm always hoping that every single time I go the service will eventually be better. Thinking maybe even writing these reviews the owner or manager someone will see it and really start to look at the service and maybe make a change. And I honestly love this place but want to give whomever is reading this a heads up on the service...I have never had good service here. Maybe its just my luck but I really haven't. I'm hoping one of my future visits maybe that will change because I don't want to stop coming here. So I am giving 3 stars for atmosphere and the food...and sorry it had to lose 2 stars for service but like I said that is a huge part of eating out. At least to me it is..."

This should be renamed the \"Shredded Carrot Bowl.\" I'm a fan of beta carotene packed veggies, but I was anticipating more poke than carrots. \n\n+Grilled Korean Pork Belly Taco: As I took bites from my taco, I found myself questioning in my mind if what I was eating was really pork belly, because there weren't many fatty pieces. The meat's flavor was lacking, and that's all I can write about. There was also kimchi in this taco which was too sour for my taste, but it did have a little spice.\n\n+Smoked Gouda and Chicken Flatbread: Not enough cheese. I tasted more of the sundried tomato than anything else. \n\nDRINKS\nIf there's one aspect I like about Yard House, it's the opportunity to sample beers on the menu prior to making a decision. Both my friend and I tried six different beers before settling. In the end I went for the Hofbr\u00e4u Hefe Weizen, though the Franziskaner Hefe Dunkel was a close second and was surprisingly not as dark as I thought. \n\nSERVICE\nSlow, but much improved from the last visit in regards to attentiveness and attitude. I have to thank our waiter for being patient with us as we were deciding on which beers to order. \n\nOVERALL\n My rating for the Yard House remains the same even though service and food were better than my first experience, but both weren't impressive enough for me to award another star or two."

            "review": "Not sure what's more embarrassing: the fact that the other day before going to see the Master at rave (two thumbs up!) that I spent $120 on dinner for 2 at Yard House, or the fact that I thought it was worth every penny.  This is not to say that the average opinion on the Yardhouse is low, but I do think it's typically thought of as a place to grab some cheap happy hour appetizers and some beer and not a place to spend $30 on entrees.  Well I did that, and I was damn happy with the results.\n\nWe arrived shortly before happy hour ended and I started with a Black and Tan and we also ordered the seared Ahi Sashimi appetizer which I was pleasantly surprised to find half off on the happy hour menu (which also discounted the price on the beer a bit).   I've had the Ahi appetizer here several times and it's almost always a winner.  I'll venture to say it's the best of it's kind among chain restaurants.  For entrees my dining partner got the Pepper crusted Filet Mignon and I ordered the Ginger Crusted Norwegian Salmon.   Both were accompanied with Wasabi mashed potatoes which I've always enjoyed for that slight hint of wasabi in every bite.  My salmon was a little masked with all the toppings (namely carrot strings, the ginger crust, and the sesame vinaigrette).   Usually I would find this to be a negative, but I''ll be damned if all of the ingredients really work together here.  I've been known to sneak a bite of the salmon on it's own from time to time anyhow and found it to be nicely cooked.\n\nThe one issue with the entire meal was the filet which was ordered medium was a little inconsistently cooked.  Some of it seemed cooked Medium well (little to no pink) while some of it did seem cooked as ordered.  I was able to taste a little of both sections and found them both tasty, though the one with some pink was more to my liking.  \n\nService was great throughout and we ordered several jack and cokes once happy hour ended and they were constantly being refreshed.  When we informed the waitress we had a movie to make she made sure to bring the check to us quickly.  When the check first arrived I was slightly taken aback by the price (and the amount of alcohol we'd consumed), but realized it had been worth it.  It also made me appreciate that I could go into the Yardhouse and make a choice on whether to have a great $30 experience of a couple of drinks, an onion ring tower and a sandwich, or go all out and have a great steak or piece of fish for extra.  You can't do that (or much of anything else) at Applebee's folks!  \n\nLater on in the theater while everyone else was fleeing for the exit midway through, we sat content.  I initially blamed this on poor movie taste by the others, but in retrospect perhaps it was the contentedness of the meal beforehand that transferred over to our cinema experience."

That being said, Yard House offers an entire section offering Gardein, a delicious meat alternative suitable for vegans and vegetarians.  HOWEVER, beware because they cook it on the same grill as the rest of the meat.  They were nice enough to cook my meat substitute in a separate pan so that my meal was still vegan, and it was pretty decent.  It was great when we were in a bind for time, as they got us in and out of there as quickly as possible and the waiter was very nice and attentive.  It is really loud and busy there, not exactly my cup of tea.  However, they were able to accommodate me despite the business and I am super happy about that.  I would definitely come back to this location, as many other Yardhouses are not willing to cook the vegan meat separately."

For appetizers, we tried the Onion Rings, California Roll, Fried Chicken Strips, Fried Calamari, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Blue Crab Cakes.  Onion Rings, Fried Calamari, and Blue Crab Cakes were all nice & crispy.  Fried Chicken Strips came with fries and were good as well, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The California Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll were interesting, in that their presentation was unlike that of those you see in a sushi restaurant.  They actually came as one huge, cut sushi piece, kind of like a cake or a tart.  The presentation was pretty unique, but the taste was also good but nothing really special.  If I was really craving sushi, I'd probably go check out normal sushi places like Osaka, Sushi Club, or something along those lines.  For drinks, I've tried the Mangolicious Martini, the Malibu Peach Martini, Blue Moon beer, and Wyder's Raspberry Cider.  I'm usually not a huge beer drinker, but the Wyder's was good...nice raspberry taste! Of course, looove the martinis!  And to top it all off, we all shared a Kona Coffee Ice Cream Sundae, which was to die for!!!

BIG! Screens everywhere with piped in Vid's. Music, I heard Foghat, Alice Cooper, and......lost track.\n\nGood crowd. 20's -30's. It was Saturday night.\n\nIt's on the South side of Town Square (near the Airport). Just behind Guitar Center & Rave Motion Pictures.\n\nFood looked Great!! Prices? Didn't look.\n\nYard House. Get's it's name from the Yard tall glasses you can get a beer in. Looks like a hassle to me.\n\nDefinitely hopping place!!\nAnd a lot of Tap's to choose from.\n\nI don't know if they have any of their own Brews though. If not, they should.

I have always liked Yard House because they have an entire Gardein section (fake meat dishes) on their menu that I just go nuts for. I started hyperventilating the first time I went to Yard House. I always end up ordering the Spicy Chicken Gardein Sandwich, which runs me about $12-$13. For some weird reason the Spicy Chicken Sandwich is not on the menu but it is online. Regardless, the waiters know exactly what I'm talking about when I place my order. The portions are always overwhelming, which takes me to my happy place.  \n\nThe menu and beer section at Yard House is ridiculously huge. I think that's why Yard House is so popular - it's great for groups! The vibe at Yard House is great. People are buzzing and if you don't mind talking loud, you'll be fine. The dim lighting makes everyone prettier too lol. The prices sneak up on you though. It's one of those restaurants where you get the bill and you wonder how it got so high. Sneak attack!!"

They were pretty busy so we had about a 45 minute wait time to get seated. We took a quick stroll around the area and when we returned we got seated shortly thereafter. We were quickly greeted by our server who was knowledgeable about the menu. We placed our drink order and began looking over the vast choices in the menu. We then placed our order and received our food about 30 minutes later which was surprising given the amount of people there. The food was excellent and really hit the spot. I would have loved for the prices to be a little lower but overall I think it was worth it do to the customer service our waiter gave us."

This happened last time and it happened again. Thankfully the server wasn't on lunch for a godly amount of time and we were actually able to get our order in in a timely manner.\n\nThe food seems really consistent location to location and you can't get me away from their french fries or  BBQ Ranch chicken salad but seating your customers in an area that won't get any service needs to change.

He went back to the kitchen to ensure that the product was purely vegan!  Not only that he was very accommodating with her order.  (She got the gardin spicy chicken sandwich).  She said it was tasty & would come back.  I had the Turkey Burger which was one of the best tasting burgers I've had in a long time.  Since I didn't Want fries Mitch patiently ran down my other options until I decided (on mixed veggies which were crisp & not covered in butter & crap).  My mom got the beef sliders & she was very pleased.  We will all come back again since the service was Fab & they are vegan friendly!"

I don't think I need to add to their marketing scheme, but I couldn't resist adding a review. \n\nMy review is completely based on this location only. I come to this Yard House a bit too often during their happy hour. I love it because of their late night happy hour. After a long day of school and work, I'm usually done way after the normal happy hour ends. Fortunately, Yard House caters to the night owls out there and starts at 10pm on Sunday-Thursday. \nNow, I'm sure none of this is new to anyone, every Yard House in the nation offers late night. \n\nHere's why I love this location:\nThe bartenders here are the best in town. I have come to love the 6 main guys that work the later shift. I usually have one of them pick out my beers for me, and he's always spot on as far as my cravings go. The bars on the strip could really learn a bit about service from these guys. I wouldn't recommend sitting at a table. SIT AT THE BAR! No wait and better service."

            "review": "The unmatched draft beer list is something that always draws me to any Yard House. We used to flock to this location for happy hour at the bar after work. The perimeter of the center bar was roped off like it still is now and we would stand in this roped off area crammed butt to nut, with the entire area around the bar lined with people three deep not able to move or hear any conversation while everyone still tried to act cool.\n\nNowadays, I just go with my family for maybe a beer or two and for dinner. We came on our most recent visit on Saturday night with about a five minute wait. We sat inside at a booth with a ten top table next to us and an overall very noisy restaurant. Quarters are much tighter in this location compared to others.\n\nWe were served by Victor who did a fine job despite being busy, but also taking time to make my daughter and her friend laugh along with bringing the entire table water without request. We started off with the shrimp ceviche and nachos. The nachos were a nice portion and loaded with plenty of chicken, beans, cheese. I wasn't that pleased with the ceviche as the mango papaya salsa was too sweet and overpowered the dish hiding the traditional tart flavor of a ceviche.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered two tacos, fish and pork belly, which I preferred the pork belly. And also ordered were a chicken Cobb salad and mini creme brulee for dessert. The Cobb salad was nice sized portion with plenty of ingredients and big enough for my daughter and her friend to split. The bananas topping the custard on the creme brulee were also hit by the torch giving them a bit of candied texture also.\n\nThe menu is large at Yard House with some items done well, but nothing exceptional. This location isn't as family friendly as other locations due to the louder environment and with a clientele that favors groups that are there hopping between other bars in Town Square. I would come back to this location with my friends during one of the early or late happy hours to sample the discounted beers and while munching on some food."

I will on occasion go to the red rock location if I'm in that area. But town square is the go to. \n\nEvery time I come, it's usually always busy. Meaning I've never come on an empty night. Still receive great service and seated within an acceptable amount of time. There are great for large parties! ***side note: if you have a large party, be patient with them some servers look and act annoyed** I've come in with a party over 30 and they always accommodate us. (We come after we  perform in shows) \n\nLike I said I love the reverse happy hour menu so honestly that's the only things I've ever tried... And their dessert! Yummy! My absolute favorite is the Garlic Chicken Noodle!!! I see it more as a meal than an appetizer! Lo mein type noodles with chicken chunks accompanied by garlic flavor, edamame seeds, Parmesan cheese toppings, shiitake mushrooms, chunks of tofu, and sliced asparagus!!! Who wouldn't love that?! It's absolutely delicious and just the right amount of garlic flavor. \n\nAll of their happy hour appetizers are a must try. Their half off pizzas are delicious, and my other favorite go to meal is the Ahi-poke Stack. Perfectly lightly wasabi coated ahi tuna chunks stacked on wonton wafers accompanied with carrot and radish slices all lightly coated in the soy and wasabi ginger sauce with slices of fresh avocado on the side!!  \n\nWhen I order just the chicken garlic noodles and the poke stack during happy hour, with tip and tax included I walk out paying $15. Can't beat that!!! \n\nNot to mention to amazing beer selection they have available!! Pear Cider is my go to! \n\nTry everything on their appetizer menu! I promise they do not disappoint"

            "review": "I have lived in Vegas for now over a year, and I have to say that by far this was the worst restaurant I have been too. \n\nWhen we first came in it looked fun, loud, dark - perfect for a younger crowd looking to have some fun. We decided to sit outside because Vegas weather is to be enjoyed as much as possible and were quickly concerned by the size of the menu. \n\nI have never seen a menu this large. Yes 2 pages are of the brews that they have on tap but the other 5 pages (back and front) are of food they serve. They serve pizza, soup, salad, vegetarian, tacos, fish, sushi, dessert, sandwiches, burgers, pasta EVERYTHING. This is when I got nervous. Usually when I see a menu over 2 pages I'm wondering if they're a \"Jack of all trades and a King of NONE.\" As I looked through the menu every item had this grandiose listing of ingredients that looked as if they belonged in a high end restaurant. As far as I knew I was in a restaurant that cherished beer and was named the \"YARD HOUSE\". It was obvious that they were overcompensating or just flat out LYING about what they put in their food. After reading a novel of a menu for over 10 minutes I thought I had finally decided what I wanted. I ordered a ranch side salad and their \"famous\" mac n cheese. My husband ordered a BBQ burger - well done with french fries. We did not order any brew. \n\nWhen they brought out my salad I was surprised to see that they had used a hot plate to serve my cold salad. It did not help the taste. The lettuce itself was very weak and not crunchy at all like Iceberg lettuce generally is. After eating a few bites I saw something dark and shiny in the bottom of my bowl...I began to dig it out and realized that it was a long thin dark black hair. I stopped eating. \n\nA few minutes after I stopped eating I asked for our waitress to take the salad away due to the hair and she apologized and asked if I would like something else instead. Just to be safe I ordered the Caesar salad. The salad quickly came out within two minutes and I was excited to try it because I LOVE Caesar dressing. I took a huge bite and for some reason my nose and my pallete tasted and smelled something skunky...I had assumed it may have been the man who had just walked by and continued to take another bite. After that bite I knew it was the dressing. The Yard House had tried to \"remake\" caesar dressing and it was awful. It tasted like someone had just rubbed their dirty gym sock all over my salad. I didn't take another bite.\n\n\n\nShortly after that our meals had arrived and as I am the BIGGEST mac and cheese fan I was super excited to taste their rendition of an old favorite. They had used some \"fancy\" pasta with a few different cheeses, chicken, bacon, mushrooms and a bread crumble on top. The cheese sauce was good, the pasta itself was way overcooked and too soft, the bacon was soft..which was not appealing and some of the chicken was cold as if they had frozen slices and just heated them for the dish. I pushed everything but the pasta and the cheese to the side and tried to enjoy it. After a couple of bites I started to feel really sick. I'm not really sure what caused it but I honestly felt like I was going to throw up. It might have had something to do with the fact that a few seconds before the table next to us OUTSIDE had ordered fish and I was drowning in bad fish odor at our table. My husband even complained of the stench. That fish was IN NO WAY FRESH. It smelt like rotten salmon that had been sitting under a heat lamp all day. I almost gagged when they first brought it out. I think that, and the combo of feeling like I ate a dirty sock and soft pasta may have made me sick. \n\n\nMy husband said that his burger was alright, and the fries were okay, but really stringy. \n\nHalfway into eating my mac and cheese a woman came out to speak to me about the hair that I had found in my salad. She let me know that it was NOT a hair, and that it was actually corn silk, left over from the \"fresh\" corn they had just chucked to make my salad. I've eaten fresh corn, canned corn and frozen corn all of my life. They have very distinct differences. I know, that that was frozen corn. It was gooey and hard to chew, fresh corn just pops in your mouth. I don't know why anyone had come out to argue with me about what I found in my salad. Last time I chucked corn the silk was usually white to a yellowish color. Not BLACK. Nice try though.\n\n\n\nAnyway, my husband and I both left feeling very nauseous and the drive back to Henderson was NOT a pleasant one. The entire drive home I was trying my hardest not to throw up. I don't want to explain what the rest of my night was like but I'm sure you get the picture. We wont be back here."

They usually try to get you in a spot so you can view most of the games.\n\nWe all got burgers and everyone seemed to like them. My mouth was watering from all of those taps behind the bar but my brain was saying no go. My liver would just have to wait until next time to try all of that deliciousness.

Service was good and they sat us at the table immediately. We made a reservation beforehand. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of stuff so I got to try a little bit of everything. The sweet and sour \"chicken\" off the vegetarian menu was so good!  It's made out of soy but it's crunchy sweet and sticky. I also enjoyed the texture. I got to try the truffle burger and garlic fries. Liked it both. It was good, nothing really special but definitely a solid burger. The fries are cut thin and they were generous with the garlic. I got the angel hair pasta with all kinds of vegetables and olives in the half size. Portion is a little small but I wasn't that hungry so it worked out. I enjoyed it but it wasn't my favorite dish. I kept eyeing other people's food. I think there's too many olives in it.  I also liked their Korean steak dish with rice. It came with saut\u00e9ed spinach that were delicious. \n\nSince it was a birthday they were nice enough to give the birthday girl a free dessert. Ice cream and a brownie. They also split the check for 20 people. That's amazing!  Love it when places can do that so you don't have to worry about calculating it and splitting the tips and tax. Saved us the headache!  Will definitely come back for their happy hour."

This is a great place that is located fairly close to the Strip.  It is very easy to get here by car or taxi too.\n\nYardhouse has a decent selection and it's good for meals or just snacking with their Snacks Menu. You can also choose from appetizers, Salads, Pizza, Street Tacos and their Gardein vegetarian selections. Whenever I come to a Yardhouse I like to choose from the Grilled Burgers, Sandwiches and House Favorites.  \n\nWe ordered the Ruben sandwich on rye, grilled chicken with avocado and the grilled cheese with tomato bisque.  I tasted all of the sandwiches and I thought that Ruben was by far the best.  When I ordered the Ruben I asked if it came with rye bread and the waiter was not sure.  He was going to check and come back.  It took him some time but he returned and let me know they had rye bread.  A Ruben isn't a Ruben if it's not on rye bread!  \n\nWhen the food was brought to the table I was talking so I didn't check my sandwich and the bread was not rye.  It took me a while to flag down our waiter and he finally noticed me came over and took my sandwich and fries and replaced them very quickly.  According to the waiter, it seems that the server took the wrong sandwich to the table and mine was sitting there.  It did not seem as warm as the original sandwich they sent out but if I was going to ask for them to exchange it again then everyone would be done with their meals and I would still be eating. So I ate a not so warm sandwich but it had a nice taste to it. I think it would have been an awesome sandwich if it was fresh out of the kitchen.  \n\nThe chicken and avocado sandwich was delicious.  The avocado was very fresh and the flavors went really well together.  The chicken was juicy and not overcooked.  The grilled cheese sandwich had tomato on it and it was good. The tomato bisque soup tasted fresh as well and was served at the perfect temperature.  The fries that came with the food were good with one of the orders but not with mine since they must have been sitting around a bit. \n\nIf you are a beer fanatic this is the place for you.  They have a huge selection of about 200 beers.  They rotate some beers so they don't always have all of them available. There are even beer blends, beer floats and beer cocktails. As far as mixed drinks they also have mixed drinks including martinis, cocktails and mules.  They have plenty of wine as well and even Sake.\n\nI only gave the place three stars for serving a sandwich and fries that were not at the right temperature.  Our waiter was professional and polite.. When I'm with my sister we make each other laugh a lot and the waiter was very patient with us.  \n\nI would come back."

My only pet peeve about this spot is that they don't have any type of call ahead seating or reservations, so if you go on Friday or Saturday, expect to wait at least an hour for a table. Something like that just bothers me, I don't care if you want to take a credit card to hold a reservation like the high end joints do here in Vegas, but at least give us the option of reserving a table!

Serving sizes are large - one plate comes with four sliders and a side of fries.\n\nThe sliders are served on a slightly sweet pan-styled bun. Overall, there is probably a little too much bun and not enough meat inside. The patties are well-seasoned, crisp however are a might on the dry side. \n\nThe classic came with some standard cheese and pickle - which was okay but would have been better if there was some lettuce or tomato on top. The bearnaise sliders come with some fried onions which really improved the flavour of the sliders and texture. The bearnaise sauce wasn't anything I needed to go back for however.\n\nThe skinny fries are okay when they're hot but once again suffer once they've sat out for too long. They are crisp but are a little on the thin cut fries side of things so it lacks some of the lovely mealiness inside.\n\nOverall, not bad sliders, but nothing really special. The edge goes out to the bearnaise sliders by virtue of the fried onion topping."

We waited and sat outside. We have our kids and it was a beautiful night so we figured why not? It is also fairly loud inside, so outside was best for the kids. The tables inside and out are extremely close together and I felt like the ladies sitting next to our table should have just joined us because we heard everything they said (or they could have just been being really loud, but we were very close). The service was only okay we had to practically grab our server's arm just to get refills. The food was pretty good, but the selection of items were not fantastic. Not to mention I felt the pricing was much more than similar restaurants. While the food was good we probably won't be back because there are other places just as good with much better pricing."

            "review": "This is a review of one thing and one thing only: the turkey burger. Walking around Town Square on a Friday evening with a pal seemed like something different to do (at least for me). \n\nHonestly, I don't adore Town Square, and I don't really adore any of the limited culinary experiences I have had at Town Square. I do like the relatively pedestrian-friendly space it provides to roam about and window shop. And, I had remembered reading a glowing review of the turkey burger here, so I wanted to give it a nibble.\n\nLet me be upfront and say that if you care about being healthy, you should probably skip this turkey burger. It was frickin' delicious, but I just knew there had to be some bad things in there to make it taste so good. I checked out the nutrition info on the Yard House website, and this mamma jamma has 2810mg of sodium, plus a lot of other large numbers in unhealthy columns. Wow. I should be swimming laps and doing jumping jacks instead of writing this review. At least I substituted the fries for a salad, right?\n\nJust browsing around their nutrition info, I get the impression that the secret to their tasty eats is salt, salt and more salt. Be warned. The California Roll has 3415mg of sodium. Now, how does that happen? I know fish comes from the salty ocean, but... this crab must be dating someone in the Morton family.\n\nSo on pure taste, that burger was definitely in the 4 to 5 star range, but I probably will never eat it again.\n\nDespite being absolutely slammed, the service was great. Our waitress didn't even try to rush us off, which really impressed me.\n\nI think I am seriously going to go swim some laps now."

Smiles and good times was all over the building, not only from the staff but also the customers.\n\nThe food was amazing and if you're a beer lover such as myself they have over 100 brews to choose from. The selection included everything from lagers to ale's and even mixed beer drinks if you want to mix raspberry Lindermans Framboise w/ a chocolate flavored beer. And worse case scenario, let's say that you can't make up your mind on a beer selection; they also have samples of every brew to find the perfect one for your taste buds... I prefer Peroni.\n\nThe dinner was delicious. My girlfriend ordered a spicy chicken flatbread sandwich with parmesan & herb fries. I had to take a bite lol, and that was bomb.com! Chicken was grilled to perfection with avacado, cabbage, and spicy mustard. I ordered the BBQ cheddar burger! Heaven on earth. 1/2 lb sirloin cooked to order, melted cheddar cheese, smoked applewood bacon on a sweet Hawaiian bun and sweet potato fries on the side. Best burger I've ever had hands down.\n\nThe only downer I seen about the place is that its extremely loud inside of Yard House. I'm not knocking anyone's fun but it was hard to carry a convo with my girlfriend without shouting at eachother and we're sitting next to eachother in a booth. But there's also outside dining so that probably could've been more peAceful to enjoy a nice elegant dinner. Definitely is the spot if you're having a nice date and get hungry :-)"

He had a huge smile on his face, and it actually seemed genuine.  There were some new menu items that had been added since our last visit, Seth knew about all of the new items.  He answered all of our questions without skipping a beat.  Best part about it...he didn't seem annoyed at all.  He was very pleasant and informative.  \n\nOur food arrived very quickly and was just as delicious as always.  Seth came back to check on us a few times, but we had nothing but great things to say.  He never let our drinks get less than half full, and he anticipated our needs like a true professional!!\n\nEveryone knows that Yard House has great food and a great happy hour.  I decided to write this five star review because I'm sure that not everyone knows how fantastic Seth's service is!!  My husband and I were so happy that we were seated in his section, especially when we saw most of the other servers.  They just looked so miserable...(mostly) smiling while they were at their tables...and then frowning as they turned away.  I don't think they know that their attitudes come across and can sometimes ruin a dining experience.  Seth was incredible.  I really wanted to let a manager know how much I appreciated him, and I would have...if I saw one at any time during our meal.

            "review": "Normally I love going to Yard House and would just stock up on appetizers but this time I decided to order an entree just to try it.\n\nI ordered the \"SEARED SEA SCALLOPS\" which comes with a description of \"orzo pasta with wild mushrooms and white truffle sun-dried tomato sauce\".  Sounded great but was a disappointment when it arrived.\n\nFirst off, you were given 4 scallops.  Two of which must have been bay scallops and two of which must have been the larger sea scallops.  So the first thing that you noticed was that you received 4 scallops which were not all of the same size but seems to have been cooked for the same amount of time.  Any one that has seared a scallop or eaten a perfectly seared scallop knows that you want a middle that is still slightly translucent.  The two smaller scallops were completely white and over cooked.  The sear on one side too much and the sear on the other side not enough.  With the two larger scallops, it was closer to a perfect sear.  However one scallop was falling apart (bad prep) and almost white on one side receiving no sear at all.\n\nFor the orzo pasta, the description indicated wild mushrooms.  I am a huge mushroom fan and love almost every kind that I've had the opportunity to try.  However, I feel that I (as well as most people) probably do not think of button mushrooms or shitake mushrooms as wild mushrooms.  \n\nI know that most sun-dried tomatoes are kept in oil to keep them moist.  But when they were added to the sauce, far too much of the reserve oil was added to the sauce.  If I tilted my plate, bright red oil would be able to leak onto the table below.  It was a far to heavy sauce for such a tiny pasta as orzo.\n\nNow I do realize that I am at Yard House and not a celebrity-chef named sea food restaurant, but I would have at least hoped that their entr\u00e9es would have been as good as all of the appetizers that I've had.  That a chef there would still be able to provide equally sized scallops for one plate and that I would not receive overly greased pasta.\n\nAll in all, this will not detour me from returning to Yard House for some apps or a beer but it will detour me from ordering an entr\u00e9e again."

I've tried Miller's Ale House on the opposite side of the outdoor mall also and I can say that Yard House is, hands down, way better than Ale House - in so many levels.  Am not a big fan of chain or franchised restaurants and tend to be very judgmental of them.  \n\nMy friend was starving after watching the most recent Superman movie at the Rave, or AMC Theaters.  I blamed my friend for choosing Ale House the last time because that was just a waste of a hard earned money so we went to Yard House which is literally a few steps away from the cinema.  I wasn't very happy of the choice, but hey, I might as well give it a try. \n\nWe were quickly seated and drinks were served in a flash.  I ordered their Spicy Jambalaya with linguini instead of rice, and my friend ordered their Parmesan Crusted Chicken.   My review is based on the food that I pig out on.  My friend liked the chicken too, more than the pork medallion (actually pork schnitzel) from Ale House.  \n\nWe didn't wait long for our entrees.  The Jambalaya pasta came tolerably hot.  Good servings, if I may add.  It was reasonably seasoned.  Not that spicy as I was expecting but there sure was some kind of a bite and kick because of the paprika, cheyenne pepper and cajun seasonings.  The dish was perfectly tossed in cajun sauce generously packed with small shrimps, roasted red and green peppers, fresh tomatoes, slivers of andouille sausage and topped with two grilled huge shrimps (mini prawns).  I remember having Jambalaya pasta from Cheesecake Factory and Claim Jumpers decades ago and I thought they were good, but Yard House's is better.  \n\nWe liked the way our server/waitress didn't bother us every 5 minutes or so asking how everything was.   We were left to enjoy and savor our food, and only came when necessary (refilling our drinks, clearing up our table and bringing in the check).  Suffice to say, i finished my plate and was happy with it.  Total damage for me was $25.00.  A bit pricey for a pasta dish but considering the ambience and the service, it wasn't that bad."

If you're here you're going to be most likely getting one of those long glasses filled with beer, I always thought they were yard long glasses, hence the name Yard House, but I think they're half yards now. They have a great selection of domestic, imports, and craft beers.  They also have a special selection of beer which they'll serve until they run out.  I'd recommend trying those first if they sound good to you.\n\nHappy Hours:\nMonday - Friday 3pm - 6pm, half off those drinks, apps, and pizzas, there's also specials on some drinks.\nSunday - Wednesday 10pm - Close, same as M-F except no half off those long drinks.\n\nIf you can try to get a sit outside because inside is usually pretty loud and you might get your drinks faster, the bar is usually crowded.  It's also easier to get a party of about 20 seated together.  I think we had about that many last time, some passing out, everyone a drunken mess, good times. They have heaters during the winter and when it gets warmer nice place to have a beer away from the A/C.\n\nTheir food is actually pretty good better that what you'd expect from a place that serves mass amounts of alcohol.  They have everything from burgers to seafood to pizza, pasta, ribs, desserts...\n\nService is usually most of the time, haven't had a problem yet except for the time I asked for a yard a crown and they said no jk.  I'd say the only problem about this place is that when it's crowded, every time I've been there, it gets difficult getting a beer at the bar. Overall I'd always go back."

I've been there thrice and if by the fifth time I don't encounter any problems I will bump it up to a 5... your move Yard House!\nP.S. yeah I used the word thrice!"

My favorite is the grilled cheese and tomato bisque soup, especially in the winter. Their sweet potato fries are divine! Their pizzas are tasty too. I've never had a bad meal here."

Great energy, and I got to watch the game from my table. Would've gave 5 stars but the server seemed to disappear at times. All in all a great experience. Will return for sure."

Actually everything on the happy hour menu is pretty darn good.  Poke stack, and thai chik pizza are my fav."

Finally the server came back and said they are changing out the taps it'll just be a little while longer. Then my server came back and told me the beer was tapped out. So I ordered a different beer. Waited. Finally received a beer at 5:30. So I waited 45 min to get my first drink and sat there while all my friends drank one or more of their drinks. I have never had a bad experience at this place but after this I'm considering not coming back."

Perfect way to do business.\n\nWe came here for the Happy Hour. The amazing thing is that the \"appetizers\" here are nothing short of greatness. We got the classic sliders (protein style), ahi poke, spicy tuna style (2), calamari, chicken lettuce wrap, and ahi sashimi.\n\nThe sliders are similar to any other bar food. The ahi tuna, spicy tuna roll style was amazing. Presented beautifully as well. I think the portion of the calamari was huge for $6. The chicken lettuce wrap alone will hit all of your taste buds! Also, the sashimi here is amazing! I can't wait to arrive again!\n\nOur server was Bryan, and he got a great tip to accommodate his service!"

We got the vanilla creme brule, chocolate souffle, and the banana berry macadamia nut cobbler. The vanilla creme brule was vanilla custard with burnt bananas on the top of it??? If you enjoy real creme brule don't bother here.\n\nThe chicken nachos are more then enough for 2 people to share as an entree and the chocolate souffle was just ok.\n\nOverall it's okay, the service was the best part, all the staff was extremly friendly. I would came back if some else choose to, but wouldn't be my first recommendation."

I ordered the angel hair pasta, my bf ordered the dip with a side of sweet potato fries and our friend ordered a grilled chicken sandwhich with broccoli. When all of our orders came out, I tried the fries and they were cold. I mentioned it to my boyfriend and when he touched his sandwhich, it was also cold. I thought that was a bit weird, but when my friend took a bite if his sandwhich he said his chicken was also cold. I was thinking, maybe because it's a sandwhich, it wouldn't be that warm even though my bf ordered the roast beef dip. So, I took a bite of my pasta and my pasta was dry, bland, and COLD. It seemed like they left it out for a long time because the pasta was kind of stale. It was by far the worst meal I have eaten. No one in my party enjoyed their cold food. The food is over priced and they serve cold food. What I did notice yesterday night because I was sitting in front of the kitchen, was the food was coming out fast, but the food was standing there forever. I saw 4 dishes waiting there to be picked up for roughly 10 min. No wonder the food was getting cold! Not enough runners to even bring the food out. Horrible way to manage a business that can't have enough staff to bring out orders. I will never return here for the food. Like a huge company like this, they should have already gotten their shit together. Horrible."

However, this is the newest Las Vegas locals kick-it spot, so it's more about the experience than anything else. Be forewarned, it goes get packed on the weekends, so be ready to wait an hour to an hour and a half."

Once seated we were greeted by Kasandra, our server who turned our whole day around! She was pleasant, knowledgeable and patient. The menu here has something for everyone! We ordered drinks, I had a half yard of Anderson Valley Wild Turkey Bourbon Stout and my girlfriend had a Pineapple Express cocktail, both delicious! We started with the chicken nachos, really good, they used poached chicken, kinda weird, but still delicious! She had the lamb burger and I had the blackened chicken torta sandwich! Both equally awesome! If the food and service wasn't good enough, the manager, I assume based on his outfit, stopped by the table to check on our experience! Level 5 service right there! I highly recommend this location here at Town Center! We will definitely be back! Thanks again to Kasandra and the manager and the whole team who made this a great experience!"

I keep going back, thinking it's a fluke, but it's not. Every time, it's fantastic, and the salad it comes with is surprisingly flavorful and light.  Also, having a keg room the size of my apartment is a bonus.  As a beer snob, this is the place to drink.  The turkey burger makes it the place to eat too."

Guerrero is the worst server of them all. How do you not know there is a vegetarian section on your menu? And then after you seriously ask if I want to add chicken??? Food and drinks deserve 5 stars but service deserves 0 stars."

They have a ton of beers on tap!!  We lucked out and got there at happy hour.  I can't remember the names of the beers, but the brown ales were right on!  I tried the Irish Creme Ale (I think that was the name of it.)  Being half Irish I wanted to get back to my roots... : )  It wasn't my favorite but it was still good.  \n\nTried some sliders with a side of bernaise sauce,  they were tasty.  \n\nI was pleasently suprised with this place.

I use to go to Yard House all the time when I lived in a different city and loved it. This location.. Well.. I mean it was just okay because I really didn't feel anything was 4-5 star worth type of service. The drinks are what was really disappointing. Our waiter was very friendly and cool however that didn't make up for the weak drinks that the bartender was pouring up that night. I ordered a long island because I know it should have a PUNCH to it, and it wasn't even a jab to say the least. My bf ordered a Long Beach and that too wasn't made well. When we were asked would we like another drink from our waiter I had to kindly decline and let him know that the first round was awful. He informed me that they do some sort of measuring technique and I guess can't pour more alcohol than what's listed. I don't know but we ended up only ordering appetizers off the happy hour specials because after the under whelming drinks I was ready to depart! Chicken nachos are HUGE and filled with flavor, Calamari was great as well. Will I be back? Maybe..."
