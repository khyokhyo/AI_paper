            "review": "This place is amazing. :)  I had asked the conceirge for a restaurant recommendation when I was planning my Vegas trip and they had recommended this venue.  It was a totaly splurge for my boyfriend's birthday and to compliment the dining experience, I had tickets to Cirque du Soleil's \"O\" after dinner.\n\nThe restaurant is hidden, and is the only restaurant at the Bellagio that does not have signage for the restaurant facing the Bellagio pool.  We had to ask hotel staff how to locate the restaurant, as to there not being any signage for the restaurant inside the Bellagio as well.\n\nThe restaurant is an experience for all the senses.  The decor is beautiful and I had requested a window seat for my dinner reservation.  You are able to enjoy the Bellagio fountain while dining.  \n\nService is impeccable.  We had a very knowledgeable and gregarious waiter.  It was definitely worth the splurge.  The total bill came out to be over $300 dollars including wine.\n\nWe had both ordered filet mignon (I opted for filet mignon with foie gras) and a side of tempura, a side of truffle mashed potatoes, and a side of creamed spinach.  (I can't seem to recall our starters nor dessert.)\n\nIt was a great experience and we can't wait to return to Prime."

            "review": "I had a fantastic experience at Prime.  The food was savory, well prepared, and the presentation was very nice.  It is very expensive, however, and only a few select tables get the views of the fountains.  \n\nWe started out with orders of Salmon Sashimi and Ribbons of Tuna.  Both were incredibly flavorful and exceeded our expectations.  The Ribbons of Tuna comes with a radish and ginger marinade that completely rocked my world.  I was not sure if I would like it or not, but I ended up using bread to soak some of it up once we finished the tuna.  I highly recommend it!\n\nEveryone in our party ordered steak.  I opted for the special which was a bone-in filet.  The steak came out cooked to perfection and I savored every single bite.  Fantastic!  It was not the best steak I have had, but nothing has ever held a candle to the Wagyu steak I had back home.  I really wanted to try it here, but I just thought it was too expensive ($30 per ounce).  \n\nThe side dishes are very good, and the portions are large enough to share.  I opted for the Tender Broccoli with Truffle gouda fondue.  It was rich, and I couldn't finish it.  By then I was already full from the appetizers and steak.  \n\nOur service was top notch, and I expected nothing less.  I have little doubt that we will be back again soon!"

We got to sit right where they show the water show. It was pretty great :] . They ordered an onion soup for me because I can't eat seafood....fantastic. So cheesy..mm!\n\nI ordered the filet mignon..AOSDOAJDSOJ\nIt just pretty much melted in my mouth!\nNever tasted anything so amazing..\n\nMy sister also ordered the truffled mashed potatoes...best I have EVER tasted. It was amazing.\n\nOf course a very pricey place.\n\nIt was the boss's girlfriend's birthday that day. Usually restaurants would bring out like ice cream, or a slice of cake..NOT HERE.\n\nTHEY BROUGHT A FULL CAKE. It was HUGE. I was so shocked..and...it was delicious :] \n\nDEFINITELY RECOMMEND!"

            "review": "I chose Prime as the location to propose to my girlfriend yesterday and I am thrilled that I did. From the reservation a few days before all the way through they were kind, courteous and extremely helpful. I initially picked Prime for the location and knew that I wanted a seat on the patio where we can watch the fountains go off. They sat us at a table close to the water and right in the center. Could not have asked for more.\n\nShe ordered the 18oz ribeye and I ordered the beef short rib. We shared a side of the fingerling potatoes. Everything was delicious and exactly what you would expect from a fine dining experience. The bread basket has three bread options... sourdough, pretzel and a sweet raisin/walnut I believe. I have to say that I could have just ate bread and would have been thrilled. It was sooo good.\n\nThey brought out a beautiful little desert with Happy Birthday inscribed right as the fountains were going off as I had requested.\n\nI look forward to returning to Prime down the line and know that I will receive top notch service and food.\n\nThank you to the staff (Charles-manager, Jesus-waiter and the rest of the team) for making our experience one to remember. You guys are awesome!"

We were originally mis-booked at 2 separate tables, but when our party raised this with the hostess, she re-arranged house seating to accommodate our party within  5 minutes - seamless service at its best.\n\nBest steak in Vegas - enjoyed this steak over Smith & Wollensky's and Capital Grille. \n\nSeamless service throughout entire meal - party of 15 was attended to by a team of servers without interruption. Members enjoyed their meal at varying pace within the party, while service remained completely unobtrusive yet attentive. One of the best dining staff I've ever experienced.\n\nGorgeous, opulent decor. Luxe floor-to-ceiling drapery, larger-than-life floral arrangements."

            "review": "I brought my wife here for our 4 year anniversary and we got a seat close to the window that looks at the Bellagio fountain. Good atmosphere and a nice restaurant inside. The service was good and the waiters were friendly. We ordered a Caesar salad to start off, which we shared and I didn't like their dressing at all. My wife got the French Onion soup which she really liked. For our main course, I ordered the Rack of Lamb which was amazing. I really liked the sauce they put on it also. My wife ordered the Ribeye which was equally as good. We also had sides of steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes which both were good. We opted for no dessert as we were pretty stuffed. I was a little surprised that the restaurant didn't do anything at our table since it was our anniversary and I let them know that when I made the reservation. Usually a nice place like this will bring you out a plate of chocolates or a small dessert but we got completely stiffed this time. Overall the dinner was pretty good, but a little pricey for what it was ($217 after tip, no wine or alcohol at all). We said that we lived the meal and the view of the Bellagio fountain, but not somewhere we would be craving to come back to."

Wow, so many choices.  Settled on Prime and hoped for the best.\nChris, a ma\u00eetre d at Prime, was instrumental in helping assure us of a window side table. Class act...thank you Chris.\nPedro, with the caring and on the spot support from Natalio made sure our evening was memorable. \nThe food was second to none and included what we felt was THE highlight dish, that being the Short Rib. The Rib Eye was ok but a little tough, appetizers choices were a great Cesar, awesome carpaccio with steak tartar.\nThe only let down was the sommelier who gave us a bit of cold shoulder, probably due to the fact we brought a very special 25 year old bottle of wine. We gladly paid the $50 corkage fee to enjoy our special keepsake, but would have loved to enjoy the same courtesy and caring service provided by Natalio and Perdo....Thank you gentlemen. \nWill DEFINITELY be back when next in L V."

            "review": "This is one of the most beautiful rooms in Las Vegas and one of my favorite restaurants, so when my best friend asked where I wanted to go for my birthday, Prime was my pick.\n\nWe requested one of the tables for two up against the windows overlooking the fountains and I was kind of surprised that the place was packed on a Wednesday night. Even the outside patio was full. Fortunately, I do have a casino host to take care of things like this.\n\nIn any case, the food and service are just superb here. Just my opinion, but once you are at a place that is using the best ingredients and knows what to do with them, the rest is just what kind of ambience you are looking for and other very subjective things. We wanted to talk and have a laid back evening without blasting music and a low douche factor.\n\nWe were served an amuse of salmon on cucumber, which was a fabulous start. I had the tomato and burrata salad, which was perfection. It's amazing that something so simple like a perfectly ripe tomato can taste so wonderful, although most of the time I'm just used to whatever passes for a tomato in CA.  My friend had the seared foie and said it was in her top 5.\n\nFor our entrees, I chose the surf and turf special- lobster tail and a filet that was at least 3 inches thick with a tablespoon of lemon spaetzle, while my friend had the peppercorn New York. Both were cooked medium rare as asked. Two plates of heaven.\n\nThe sauces are really standouts here. I could have had a glass of the soy/ rice wine. It was perfect with my lobster and the filet. \n\nFor sides, we had fingerling potatoes, cream corn and tempura onion rings. Only the onion rings didn't hit it out of the park- they were just OK.\n\nAs you would expect, the service was friendly but professional and I really did appreciate the server mentioning the price of the specials. The surf and turf was $118 (hey, it was my birthday!), but it can be awkward in a group or business dinner if someone has to ask. I've been burned a couple of times.\n\nFor dessert, they sent out a trio of lemon tart, vanilla bean ice cream and a chocolate mini-cake. Yum!\n\nWhile Prime is one of the more expensive steak houses in Las Vegas, it is certainly a great pick for a special occasion or when you just feel like treating yourself to a lovely evening."

            "review": "My wife and I dined at Prime a couple weeks ago. She had a beef filet cooked perfectly to her liking. I am a vegetarian, and they had wonderful offerings for me, including a vegetarian tasting menu. Prime not only offers a separate vegetarian menu, they also have vegan and gluten-free menus.  Do not shy away from Prime if you are a vegetarian. They have thoughtful, creative, seasonally driven selections - you will not be limited to broccoli and rice, or a salad. Think of it, if you have a group of six, or eight, chances are someone in the group will want some sort of alternate menu and Prime can take care of you. As a vegetarian, Prime is among my favorite restaurants along with with Michael Mina at the Bellagio and several of the restaurants at Wynn/Encore, including SW, which have vegan selections. Of course, atmosphere and service at Prime is exquisite. Corkage at Prime is $50 - of course, wines you bring must not be on their list. I highly recommend Prime for steak lovers and vegetarians."

            "review": "I came with in hungry and with an open mind, being a huge steakhouse fan.  They charge a hefty price for their steaks; and the steaks are very good.  However, the steaks are nothing special.  I had the ribeye, and my date had the filet.  Both were obviously quality cuts of meat, but just nothing that would set either apart from other steakhouses.\n\nI did not appreciate the attitudes of the snooty staff and hostesses.  This place is over-the-top pretentious, which is to be expected, but I just felt like there was an ora that was disgusting.  In Vegas, I've enjoyed Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon which are other even higher-end restaurants.  There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.  At Prime, they made it feel as though I should be thankful to be served and seated in such a prim and proper, \"high\" class environment.  \n\nPrime is trying to be something that it's not.  This restaurant is located 45 yards from a wheel of fortune slot.  There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.  We're not in Paris folks, we're in Las Vegas- king of the nobody doing his best to act like he's somebody, and paying the credit card price for month's to come (LV is my favorite city in America).\n\nFinally, the $100 seafood appetizer platter was a complete waste.  The oysters were terrible (relative).  Prime needs to lose the attitude, and focus more on special food that matches the price."

Now, just a quick bad note, my husband got the peppercorn steak, which was not great at all. A little over done and the pepper flavor over took the steak in a bad way. My husband was too nice to send it back. \n\nBUT, the lamb made it a 5/5 for both of us. It was a perfectly done medium rare. With a tomato sauce on top. Since my husband had food envy and it was a generous portion, I shared with him. This was the best lamb either of us have had. It's been a few months since we've been there and I'm still telling everyone about it and dreaming of it!"

Same with the scallops - nothing wrong with them - but just good, not great.   \n\nIt is a nice setting and if you are close to the windows the view of the fountains is a bonus.

When we arrived, we were offered a table on the patio, but it was such a terribly hot day, that we declined.  The hostess kindly seated us inside by a window so that we could still see the fountains.  I didn't even ask, as I figured those tables would have all been taken.  I was thrilled that she did that for us.  The service was second to none.  I was thoroughly impressed with the staff throughout our meal.  They really make you feel special.  We ordered drinks (which were made perfectly).  We then ordered appetizers.  I asked for the beet salad and my husband ordered the pea soup.  Both dishes were great.  I ordered the surf and turf special and my husband got the dry-aged ribeye.  We also got the whipped sweet potatoes and the herbed peas.  Wow.  The surf and turf was unbelievable.  The filet was so tender and cooked perfectly.  But, the lobster tail was probably the best I have ever tasted.  Everything else was also tasty.  My husband really enjoyed his steak.  Although I am a dessert person, I was too full to indulge in anything else.  But, we were presented with a dish with \"happy anniversary\" written on it with four gourmet chocolates on it.

We're both lovers of steak and felt it would be a good way to start the night.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived at the restaurant we were well taken care of, we got a booth immediately in a quiet room with a few tables that looked out onto the Bellagio fountains. While we couldn't hear the music outside, it was still nice to look out and watch the fountain shows while we enjoyed the atmosphere.\n\nWe opted to skip appetizers as we wanted to ensure we would be able to finish all of our respective dinners. I had a bone-in rib-eye while my wife ordered  filet mignon. Both were perfectly cooked, and had some of the best flavors I've had in steaks.\n\nThe real treat however was the sauces they brought out. At first I was appalled a steakhouse would suggest a sauce, let alone bring out three, but I skeptically tried each one on some small pieces of my steak, and boy was I happy I did. Both the bearnaise and pepercorn sauces were very tasty and worked well with the steaks adding flavor but not overpowering them. The real winner was the house rice wine sauce however; they could have served the worst steak ever and paired it with this sauce and still gotten me to finish it. \n\nThe gratin potatoes we ordered as a side was extremely tasty as well and was more than enough for the two of us. Again, the house sauce was an amazing addition to the already delicious gratin. We got a look at the rest of the sides when a neighboring table ordered one of each and they all looked equally delectable. I look forward to trying the ginger sweet potatoes and the truffle mashed potatoes on future visits.\n\nOne thing to be careful of though is if you ask for water and only want tap water, be sure to make this clear to your waiter. We asked for water to go with our drinks and got an $8 bottle of Fiji water."

I couldn't get a happy medium piece. The soy based sauce that came with it helped it a lot.\n\nOther than that, the stone crab appetizer I had was very good and fresh. I didn't like the seared foie gras (I prefer the smooth spreadable kind, this was the lumpy really livery looking kind). I had a taste of the butternut squash soup which was excellent. The mushroom side was perfect, but the truffle mashed potatoes was lacking in truffle. For dessert I had the poached pear and the coconut souffle. The poached pear dessert seemed a little bland to me. The souffle was really good and it was nice to have a coconut variation of it. I don't think I will find my way here again (sticking with CUT next time).\n\nwww.anitaeat.com"

            "review": "Was hoping to give this restaurant 4-5 stars being it was Jean-Georges restaurant in Las Vegas.    Dined here with a group of 5 for our last evening in November, looking forward to a memorable A+ dining experience.  Our concierge at another hotel had recommended this restaurant (among others) when we asked for the best steak house in LV.  The indoor atmosphere was luxurious, overlooking the famous Bellagio fountain with a spectacular view.  It was tastefully decorated and the service top notch, unfortunately the dishes we ordered were not. Be prepared, the wine list is extensive, and expensive, but expected of a restaurant of this caliber.  I, and several others, decided to try the Caesar Salad as a starter.  We were stunned such a mediocre salad could be served at such an acclaimed restaurant.  The tired & limp romaine lettuce was thinly chopped with what looked like small store bought croutons, no joke.  The croutons didn't even look house made.  There was no shaved Parmesan or Pandano, just grated cheese throughout.  The taste was lack luster store bought, no wow factor at all.  We all agreed we could find this salad in just about any super market deli, very disappointing. Next, I ordered the peppered New York steak, medium rare, as my second dish.  The steak was over seared on the crust making it very difficult to cut through, like cutting a piece of leather, leaving the steak to be tough and chewy.  I've had much better steak elsewhere for less.  Other diners in our group had similar dishes with less than top notch results.  We were on a show schedule and didn't have time to send back any dishes, so we stuck with what we had.  This dining experience left us thinking that maybe signature restaurants ride too much on the coat tails of outdated reputations, using location and aesthetics to make up for the quality of food served, seemingly over rated.  Not sure if I would spend big bucks to eat here again when there are so many other great restaurants in Las Vegas."

Our experience with the restaurant's (different) hostesses had greatly improved, and I was very impressed with their patience, kindness, and professionalism. The hostess kindly told us that while we had requested a fountain view, it is based on a first-come, first-serve basis, and for the moment they were all taken. She suggested another table, but first made sure to give me and my parents an opportunity to decide whether we were comfortable with this table or not. We were seated in the center of the dining room and still had a view of the fountain outside. The wait service was fantastic and the food remains amazing (tip: get the foie!). I'm impressed with this restaurant's management, it's willingness to make the necessary changes, and its employees for their professionalism and tasteful service, from beginning to end. My family and I are certainly looking forward to coming back soon."

            "review": "Well, this is a first for me, in writing a review where the experience was so poor on entry to engaging the restaurant that I can't even comment on the food.\n\nTonight is our 10 year anniversary, so I thought it fitting that we go to an iconic location while in Las Vegas, The Bellagio.\n\nPrime is their center field front row top steak restaurant, or so they market themselves.\n\nThe idea is a traditional steakhouse in an ideal setting with indoor and outdoor dining while viewing the majestic Bellagio fountains.\n\nI took the time to call this afternoon and secure a late reservation (9:30pm) indicating clearly the importance of the date and asking for a special location.\n\nWhen we arrived, after walking through the Bellagio AKA Grand Central Station meets Disneyland's crowd, we approached the hostess stand.\n\nNow a restaurant selling itself as a top notch experience should have a direct human interaction upon entry, not two teenage girls working behind a desk.\n\nWorse, what clearly must have been the assistant manager walked past us, ignoring us on the way to take a phone call that was obviously more important than acknowledging their guests.\n\nWhile we stood there dressed in suit and my wife's beautiful gown, we endured the conversation that consumed the attention of both \"hostess\" explaining to the fat man in shorts and an untucked polo shirt, that he was welcome to come in later but needed to wear pants.\n\nNow at this point I have to laugh at the irony. Clearly Prime's reputation is strong enough from a perception standpoint to bring clients in, and the stuffy 'dress code' is there to enhance the \"exclusivity\" if you will. All the while the service is worse than the worst McDonalds restaurant. What a joke.\n\nWe finally connected with one of the hourly employees at the front counter and they proceeded to try to negotiate with me about wether we had actually requested an outside table or not. It was the equivalent of a conversation with a night club promoter about what it would take to get he table you want. Happy Anniversary I guess... \n\nThe good news is we went to the bar where a very friendly, competent and quality old school bartender provided real service. We ordered a glass of champagne, settled the check and informed person number 6 that I had to interact with that we would be going elsewhere.\n\nThey quickly back peddled, all of a sudden a front row table outside was available.\n\nI politely informed them that we would be going elsewhere.\n\nThe four employees were huddling around with the real manager and watching to see what we would do. I doubt they expected that I would take the time to share the truth about the experience on line.\n\nLook, here is the bottom line. When you are heading out to an expensive dinner, especially for an important event, and preparing to spend a considerable amount of money, you deserve the absolute best service and mentality. There's no entitlement here. Just because your restaurant is overlooking the Bellagio fountains doesn't mean it's automatically any better than a revolving restaurant exploiting its view to sell you overpriced food.\n\nThe restaurant is down stairs from the Bellagio Esplanade, it's a stuffy, dark, cave like environment with a very heavy small of cooked and worked over food. Think senior retirement center cafe with expensive decor.\n\nIf you want my advice, there are a dozen steak houses in town, all much better in every way. I would recommend the SW at Wynn or Carnevino at Pallazo. Of course I can't speak to the food since I couldn't stand the mentality. I can only tell you about the smell and the attitude. Both stink.\n\nTry the bar I guess then high tail it out of there before they take your cash and feed the snob beast.\n\nBetter luck elsewhere."

We had a nice table off to the side with a partial view of the fountains.  Since it was my first time at the restaurant my friend let me have the chair with the view.  We decided to share our plates.\n1.  Steak Tartare:  This was the main reason why I came.  It was magical.  The punch of flavors was amazing.  You pick up different flavors all over your palette.  \n2.  Crab Cake:  The subtle flavor of the crab was allowed to shine.  The spice was just right to add to and not take away from the crab.  \n3.  Beat and Goat Cheese Salad:  This was the only item all night that I liked, but wasn't blown away by.  The quinoa and pumpkins seeds were not my favorite.\n4.  Peppercorn Rib Eye:  We both loved the Rib Eye, but we agreed that the next time we come we would opt to get something else.  We felt the peppercorn wasn't needed on such amazing cuts of steak.  \n5.  Veal Chop:  Best veal I have ver had.  The meat was perfectly cooked and juicy.  The meat was outstanding on its own.  It didn't really need the rich sauce that accompanied the meat.  \n6.  Cream Spinach:  Excellent\n7.  Truffle Potato Gnocchi:  Flavor overload!  Incredibly reach and decadent.  \nWe skipped dessert and opted to have a cappuccino instead.  We ended speaking with a lovely group of ladies at the next table visiting from England and we joined them for coffee.  \nOne thing that I LOVED about this experience - we were not rushed.  We arrived at 9 PM and left the restaurant at 1:20 AM.  We were able to savor every bite and enjoy our company over an amazing meal.  After the restaurant emptied out a bit my friend moved his chair to the other side of the table to see the fountains too.  Wonderful experience."

I should have ordered the special of the night: a bone-in filet. Instead, I started off with a craving for duck, but our server squashed that desire by telling me that the duck l'orange was prepared in slices and did not have a crisp skin And he hadn't heard many good comments about it. He recommended the pork chop, so I got that, and I regretted it. When the server inquired how my pork chop was, I told him it was just ok--did not have much flavor. the accompanying mushrooms, on the other hand, were delicious. The server said, \"well at least you like one of the things, right? \" Uh, okay... I really didn't expect him to do anything, and yes, I was the dunce ordering a non-steak dish in a steakhouse, but our server's lack of concern over my enjoyment was a little disappointing. I've actually had better service at The Outback. And, we overheard the server at a nearby table say, \"Whatever you want, I will make it right for you\". Wished we had gotten that guy. \nAs an aside, my family always stays at the Bellagio, and service at this hotel overall is at a pretty high standard, so I guess I was expecting more out of this restaurant--it was our first time here.\nThe interior looks like Sleeping Beauty's chamber with powdery blue drapes. The music is really awful--I just have to point this out, and it is disappointing that they don't have a cocktail menu.\nCrab cakes were very good, and the sea bass was cooked perfectly with a lovely, delicate, slightly gingery sauce. Potatoes au gratin were rich! Butter & cheese galore. Ginger sweet potatoes were silky smooth and had just the right amount of sweetness. Sorbet looked much better than it tasted--perfectly scooped orbs, but the mango was too tart, coconut did not taste like coconut.\nThe house photographer (who looked just like Wendy Malick from Just Shoot Me) took gorgeous pictures of my family--she really directed us--made us get out of our seats, place our hands just so...my father has stage 4 cancer, so this is why the photos meant a lot to us.\nWill not return to this restaurant and can't say I would recommend it, but I savored every bite of my foie gras and we'll cherish our pictures."

We didn't make reservations because honestly, we didn't think we'd need any. We got there at 8:30 and asked for a table for three. Even though the dining room looked busy, it wasn't completely full. They asked if we had a reservation, we said no, and they put one in for us for 9:00 and told us to come back at 9:00. So, we went and gambled, then came back and our table was ready right when we got there. I appreciate promptness.\n\nThe dining room is a tad on the small side, but dark and cozy. The chairs are nice and comfortable, and the tables are large. I felt underdressed in a T-shirt and jeans. Though they don't \"enforce\" a dress code, they have a sign that says they recommend a jacket for men. Not sure what the dress code for women is, but I'm pretty sure my T-shirt and jeans didn't quite make the cut.\n\nUnfortunately, we didn't get a table by the window. We could still see the water show from our table, but we couldn't hear the music. I'm sure if we had a reservation well in advance, we probably could have requested a window table, but oh well. But yeah, if you make reservations, ask for a window table! They're really nice and the water show comes on every 10 minutes or so. It's a nice little distraction during dinner, y'know?\n\nAnyway, our waiter was the bomb. Generally at these uppity-steakhouse places, the waiters are a tad pompous. But, ours was awesome. He cracked jokes with us, told us what the specials were, and answered any questions we had about the menu. He also made great wine recommendations as well. He was great!\n\nWe each got a steak as well as a few sides (a T-bone for my friend, filet for my bf, and some kind of regular steak for me). Our food came out in about 20 minutes. My steak was very good -- moist, juicy, and flavorful. My only small complaint is that it was a *tad* overcooked. I asked for medium-rare, and it came out a little more on the medium side. All of their steaks are accompanied by several homemade sauces. My favorite one was their house sauce, which was some soy-based sauce. It was so yummy! For sides, we got the creamed spinach, asparagus, and sauteed mushrooms. The sides were an OK size. All three of us could split them, but a bigger helping would have been great. The asparagus was not good at all. They were overcooked and more soggy than crunchy. I was disappointed because that's one of my favorite veggies. The creamed spinach was good, but could have used some garlic or other flavoring. The mushrooms were by far the best side dish. They were flavorful and so delicious! If I had known that in advance, I would have gotten two orders of the mushrooms and passed on the asparagus. \n\nWe passed on dessert, since we were all pretty much full. When the bill came, it was a tad over $300. Not bad for the three of us. All in all, it was a positive experience. I probably wouldn't go there again, seeing as how I don't go to Vegas much and would like to try a different steakhouse next time. But, I definitely liked it and would recommend it to a friend."

If you are looking for a fab steak in Vegas, look no further.\n\nI dined on the patio, which is a total must - AMAZING view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\nThe staff were superb. Very friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.\n\nThe bacon wrapped shrimp were huge and oh-so-delicious! The caesar salad was a bit unique in that it had mustard greens. Tasty dressing to boot. The filet mignon was huge! Perfectly cooked and super tender. And it came with sides of sauces. I have a serious love for bernaise and the bernaise here most definitely did not disappoint. Go with the bernaise! Lather it on your steak! And for sides, I had the mushrooms and truffle potatoes. The truffle potatoes were positively divine. Creamy and delicious. And the mushrooms were a fabulous compliment to the steak. I had zero room for dessert, but the desserts looked delicious.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience here. Prime is truly a top notch experience. A total Vegas must-do."

I am from LA and used to high-priced dining, but this place was unbelievable.  They did not have any affordable wines on the menu, and the prices for steak were unbelievable.  $65 for a filet that arrived well over-cooked and very bland.  The wines were very overpriced, and the side dishes were pedestrian and incredibly expensive.  \n\nI have been to many of the Bellagio restaurants, and expect it to be expensive, but the others are much better than Prime.  Even though Picasso and Cirque are expensive, they are great.  Prime was average in terms of the food, decor, and service, but incredibly expensive.  I would avoid it."

Dinner here was definitely a driving factor and the primary reason I planned my return trip to Vegas. I typically don't order steak but last year a filet here changed my life and convinced me that beef is possible of trumping all when prepared properly.\n\nTo celebrate a special occasion I made reservations in advance to secure a seat along the windows which allows you to enjoy the Bellagio fountains throughout your meal. Our server Beau set the bar for service. He was personable, knowledgeable and attentive without being overbearing.\n\nHe suggested a moderately priced wine which paired perfectly with the 8oz filet I ordered. Although the truffle mashed potatoes are delicious, they are sometimes offered with lobster, which is divine. \n\nThis place is expensive, but true to the cliche \"you get what you pay for\" So if you're looking for an experience and not just a meal I highly recommend Prime. It just might change your perspective on culinary quality."

            "review": "I got back from a fantastic meal at Prime two nights ago.\n\nA few girlfriends and I were looking to try one of the fine dining restaurants in Vegas, and with so many to choose from, we decided on Prime given its location next to the Bellagio fountains and rave reviews on Yelp.\n\nWe started our evening at 8:30 and were a bit befuddled that we had to wait until 8:40 to be seated, despite having reservations and arriving a few minutes early.\n\nThis was a minor snag, as the decor and ambiance of Prime quickly trumped that.  Prime is located quite literally next to the Bellagio fountains. Even though we were not seated by the window, our party of four still had a great view. The dining room was dimly lit and featured gold accent moldings and beautiful sweeping windows.  This set the tone for a rich meal, complete with a large variety of wines, good menu variety, and more.\n\nHaving waited tables myself, I quickly asked our waiter for recommendations. As a general rule, I've always done this and it has served me WELL. Waiters want you to go home pleased (their tips depend on it), and they know what is popular.  Although they may not say outright if something is bad, they WILL tell you what is very good or perhaps make an alternate suggestion.  Our server began by saying everything was delicious (as you could expect in this type of restaurant), but did point out the menu highlights. Of the list he told us: the truffle mashed potato, the filet mignon steak, one of the steaks served w/ bone, scallop entree, and sole.\n\nWe were in the mood for a meal with some punch, so we started with the bacon wrapped shrimp (incredible! One of the highlights of this meal!), and crab cakes to share.\n\nThe bacon wrapped shrimp themselves were large and the order came with four shrimp. The bacon and green sauce it came with were lovely; the bacon itself was so hearty and smoky that I didn't think it was possible to have such great, varying flavors in a simple slice of bacon. The shrimp was tender.  Right on.\n\nThe crab cake was also excellent and was served atop a type of cabbage slaw and avocado.  Not overly \"crabby\", but great taste and a good size cake to share with maybe one other person.\n\nWe were having a hard time picking out wines, being as none in our group could be called a wine expert by any means.  Many a night of Franzia and Barefoot gulping means my pallet was no match for the variety and quality of wines Prime had to offer. Our waiter did a great being patient and recommending some of the cheaper California wines.  In the end, we went with a delicious California Pinot Noir bottle for $75.\n\nFinally, our meal.  Three of us did the Peppercorn New York Steak, which came complete with caramelized red onion and three dipping sauces. The fourth in our party went with the Caramelized Scallops.  We completed this with the acclaimed truffle mashed potatoes (aaahhh-mazing!), creamed spinach, and asparagus.  The steaks were definitely on the spicy side given the peppercorn, but were not overbearing. Our wine, along with the sweetness of the onion and muted, sweeter dipping sauces made the amount of spice just right.  Out of the three sauces, the soy-rice wine stood out as the clear favorite, just as our waiter predicted.  The steak was fresh, cooked to a medium rare perfection, and delicious.  The peppercorn rub was mouth watering and spiced just right.\n\nAmazingly, the scallop dish was the most memorable of the entrees. It was served in an amazing caramelized sauce that was so good I found myself mooching sauce to dip my bread in. (Sorry, Shayna.  I've done worse.) ;P This might be my next dish here.\n\nThe truffle mashed potatoes were also delicious, as was the creamed spinach.  Of the two sides, however, the truffle mash was definitely more appetizing. The potatoes were creamy, and literally melted in your mouth.  My mouth is watering just remembering them.\n\nSince we were celebrating a birthday, our server was kind enough to bring out a delicious chocolate cake free of charge as we waited for our check.   Here, service was a bit slow, and we had to ask a busser for assistance on more than one occasion in order to make an 11:00 show. We quickly realized this was because our waiter was preparing the cake, but I also noticed he was assigned seating on the opposite side of the dining room. Having served myself, I know how bad it sucks to be serving a fine 3 course meal with tables in opposite directions, or simply having too many. This is a potential area for improvement, however, our waiter was very kind and patient with us as we took forever to order, so perhaps we also had a part in this.  I will admit, we took forever to order.\n\nOverall, this was an exquisite meal and made for a wonderful night out for our friends. Be prepared to drop some cash here-with wine, sides, and appetizers, our meal came out to $125 a person, not including gratuity. I highly recommend Prime for any special occasion or a night on the town.  Well done."

We had a great chat about their extensive whiskey selection.  Andrew's knowledge was impressive to say the least.  If you are looking to dine on a budget look elsewhere but as they say, you get what you pay for.  As Vegas locals we don't make it to the strip as much as we would like but Prime is worth the trip."

I'm not only honored but extremely happy that as of yet this steak was the best steak that I have ever had so far.\nAs chef Jean-Georges mentioned on a commercial for the steakhouse in my Bellagio suite, every decent Chef can cook a steak, but what complements it are it's sauces or condiments. Many will agree with this, and few will disagree. But those who know where to get great cuts of meat, aged to perfection, know that salt-and-pepper and a good grill will always equal to a good and some even say a great steak. But what put this steak over the top, was the chef's recommendation to try his house sauce. I am not talking about some sort of steak sauce/barbecue sauce. I am talking about his signature steak sauce or juice as some may describe. Along with trying this steak with the other three common sauces normally used on steaks, his shined through with brilliance.\nAccompanied with a very well matched and seasoned subtle mashed Yukon Gold potatoes and a Caesar salad that I will never forget. This made for, if not the best but, one of the best meals I have ever had in my lifetime so far."

The restaurant sits right behind the Bellagio fountain show and if you are fortunate enough to get a window seat or sit out in the patio, it can be a very romantic evening. Even if you sit in the middle or back areas of the restaurant, you have a decent chance of seeing the water show as well but just not to its full potential. \n\nThe service was simply amazing as most of the fine dining establishments in Las Vegas, however the food is a little hit or miss depending on what you order. AND like most fine dining in Vegas, it is extremely pricey as I had the custom made surf and turf style dish. \n\nThe waiter for our evening made some excellent suggestions as far as cuts of meat and even some unique sauces which I tried and were amazed with. Again, service brought Prime up a notch with me otherwise I might not have rated it as high. \n\nOur group ordered the seafood bonanza (not the actual name but that is what it felt like) and it was simply crazy. From crab legs, jumbo shrimp and oysters ... just a hodge podge of seafood. It was good but I am not a fan of most of that stuff except the shrimp. \n\nI was also tempted to have the lobster bisque which I always enjoy at restaurants. The presentation was very nice however the soup itself was way too rich for my taste. Because of that, I didn't finish it which is very rare for me. It should have been toned down quite a bit but the lobster in the soup was very tasty. \n\nI did have the special order of the surf and turf which was a 6oz Kobe beef strip along with a lobster tail. The Kobe beef could have been cut with a spoon and simply melted in my mouth, I was amazed. I did order it medium as I like my meat but it came a little bit under but I didn't care because it just blew me away. The lobster tail was very good but what put it over the top was instead of using the butter, I tried this butter/shallot emulsion and it was amazing as well!!! \n\nSides are a la carte and I do recommend the spicy mac & cheese. Never made it to dessert but that is ok ... I am stuffed. \n\nSoup: So so \nMain Course: AMAZING \nSides: Great \n\nFavorite dish: Kobe beef (medium-rare) with lobster tail in the special sauce (which comes on the side). \n\nGo out and EAT!"

Stuffy, perhaps, but also beautifully and tastefully done.\n\nI would recommend dressing up, as most of the men were wearing jackets. Of course, they won't kick you out if you show up in jeans, but it's a classy place, so dress appropriately.\n\nWe were seated right in front of the window, which provided a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains at night. So pretty! This was one of my favorite parts of the experience.\n\nTrying not to over-do it on my first night of eating in Vegas, I ordered the Market Tomato Salad and the Scallops. I had a lemon martini to start, and it was fantastic. I asked for more savory than sweete, and the bartender made the drink perfectly. We ordered a Trimbach Riesling for the table, and this very dry riesling from the Alsace region in France has become one of the white wine staples I keep in my home.\n\nThe burrata on the tomato salad was perfectly creamy and balanced well with the fresh tomatoes. I've had some mediocre tomato-mozzarella salads in my day, but this one was perfect. The scallops were perfectly seared, and the capers added the appropriate level of salty bitterness to match the sweetness of the scallops. Delicious!\n\nOne of my friends ordered the filet as she always does, and it was a perfect medium, with the perfect level of charring on the outside. I tried a bite and dipped it into the peppercorn sauce. It was fantastic. I had a bite of creamed spinach as well, and it had just the right amount of acid to counterbalance the cream.\n\nEnjoying conversation with friends while watching the Bellagio fountains at night capped off the evening. I can't wait to go back on my next trip to Vegas."

The ambience of the indoor dining room is above par, although due to the glamour that is Vegas it pales a little in comparison to some of it's nearby counterparts. The wine list is extensive and fair and their white chocolate martini is one of the best I've ever had. I started with The steak tartare. Of the five times I've had this dish this ranks second (to Tony Bourdain's). The entree was amazing. The truffle mashed potatoes seasoned perfectly, the filet melting in my mouth. They asked my party if we would like to move to the terrace for dessert with water fountains. The chocolate Lave cake was intense and could have used a little more ice cream ala mode. Overall one of the best meals of my life."

The filet was perhaps the best steak I've ever had...and we are from a city that prides itself on its meat so there is definitely a list to compete with! He started with the onion soup and got the surf and turf for his entree and was thrilled with all of it. We also split the mushrooms and gratin as sides. I didn't love the potatoes but he did; the mushrooms were delicious, though! I had mentioned it was his bday when I made the reservation and they surprised us with a TO DIE FOR molten cake and homemade ice cream. The service was also excellent -- very sociable and knowledgeable. Russell and Scott were the best! Although this was of course on the pricey side, the next morning, he woke up and thanked me again for the meal so it was worth it!"

The desert was pretty good we ordered a couple dishes and we enjoyed every single one of them.\n\nPROS: Desert, view of the fountains\nCONS: service, decor"

We made our reservations by walking by the restaurant on Thursday nite, so it was kind of last minute. They had a sign that the dress code was business casual or something like that. We took note of that. We had Friday 5;30pm reservations which we didnt mind since we like to eat early anyway, so it was perfect. \nGot seated very fast, right by the window, looking at the fountains. It's odd to see the fountains dancing, but not to hear the music for it though :), just didnt have the same effect. \nOur waiter was an older gentleman, with superb service skills. He suggested items, described them really well, same with wine. We were going to order a bottle of good ol' Joseph Phelps, but he suggested something else as well and we tried it. Weren't disappointed! (would like to point out that we are frequent wine tasters so feel to have some ability to distinguish wines). \n\nFor appetizer we had shrimp cocktail (huge pieces of shrimp, I could barely eat it all). Main course was lobster (amazing!,and 8oz was just right) and fillet mignon (for hubby, rare, excellent!). The side dishes were great as well, the truffles mashed potato was to die for, as was the crunchy potato! For dessert we shared the chocolate cake (melted chocolate inside and ice cream on the side). Yum. \n\nThe only complaint - as we tried to dress as best as possible, I was astonished to see a couple at the next table wearing 'jean's'. And another guy at another table as well. Com'on..Why have the sign up if you aren't going to enforce it? ('Jacket Preferred') As we were leaving, there were people wearing evening gowns for godsakes, why would you wear crappy jeans to a place like this??? \n\nI would definitely go back to this place on our next visit!"

Had I been yelping when we first started going there, this would be a 5 star review.  2 times ago, 3 of us went, for my birthday, and noticed the decline in the food.  Still,the service, and having desert and coffee on the Terrace afterwards, with a front row view of the fabulous fountain show more than made up for it.  The last time (2011) when I called to make reservations, I stated that we would like coffee on the Terrace, after dinner.  I was told that you could now have your entire meal on the Terrace!  That was great news, except that you could not reserve a table there, but could take your chances.  Why??  I was calling 2 weeks ahead.  Ultimately, we were seated outdoors, as requested.  Our waiter, Luis, I think,  was RUDE and he and the mini waiters helping him, were slow and inefficient.  Our meals finally came, and my daughter's steak was wrong.  She ordered a medium rare, Kobe filet mignon, and was brought  a dried out, well done, New York.  The waiter was upset, and insisted that was what she had ordered.  The New York had never even been considered, and we told this idiot, when we placed our order, that we were anxious to compare the regular filet that I ordered, to the Kobe filet.  He said the kitchen would be \"mad\" if we sent it back.  We sent it back anyway. Pretty brave on our parts!  It took 1/2 hour to bring what she had actually ordered.  In the meantime, my meal, and our sides, were getting cold, so we ate from my plate.  Our bill was over $400, for 2 people.  I didn't want to raise hell, and spoil what was left of my daughter's birthday dinner, but did email the manger when I got home.  I gave her a detailed description of our experience.  As the manager, she should have appreciated  the polite, constructive and honest feedback.  Her email back said that she was sorry, and was looking into the matter.  She said she did not want to lose us as future guests to Prime, and would I please send my phone number so she could call and discuss the matter further.  I sent my phone number, and never heard from her, again."

A Shrimp salad was deemed very good. A Broccoli side dish was considered strange, it was seasoned with fresh mint. Not to the liking of those who tried it. Our waiter was genial, yet we had a feeling of strained politeness from the waitstaff team - and a collective sense of moving our party out as fast as possible.

The show was amazing the hotel was beautiful however dinner at Prime was not a good experience to put it politely. My mother's steak came out like shoe leather. My sister ordered the lamb medium well and that came out like shoe leather. The service was just as bad. Once the food was served, the waiter never returned to check on us. We had to catch the show so we were on a time crunch. The next day my mother called the restaurant and explained what happened and they said to leave a name and number and they would check the ticket and get back to her. We are still waiting. We are not complainers but again wanted this special occasion to be a nice experience and the restaurant did not try and correct the situation. The lack of customer service is what is most disappointing, not typical for a nice hotel in Vegas."

The darkly handsome restaurant inside the Bellagio overlooks the hotel's famous dancing fountains and provides an extra treat for diners. Not that they should need it, however, for the food here is world-class. Let's start with the steak, since that's what Prime is all about. We sampled the filet, a 10-ounce cut of wonderfully lean, pungently flavored meat ($67) that was oh-so tender to the knife and meltingly tasty in the mouth. We didn't find it required salt, pepper or -- God forbid -- any kind of sauce. The Caesar salad was a yummy accompaniment, and the French fries were amazing: fried golden brown, crunchy on the exterior and packed with a rich, potatoey (is that a word?) taste. Yes, we enjoyed some appetizers and our bread, but we really just kept raving about the steaks. They have some other entrees on the menu, but honestly, please do yourself a flavor (pun intended) and order a ribeye, t-bone or filet and savor your wisdom. By the way, the bartender is darned good, too; he made the best dirty vodka martini we've ever had. And he did it several times, too! Add into this fabulous mix very attentive yet unobtrusive service and we highly recommend Prime for your special night out."

Even though we had reservations two weeks in advance, we were told it might be about twenty minutes(we got there about 10 minutes before our reservation). Which is fine, I know there are limited seats outside and people will stay and chat. When we were first seated, it took our waiter a good five minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink. It took probably 8-10 minutes to get bread to our table.   Not a great start!  We were decided what we wanted to order and sat there for another 10 minutes or so before our waiter came back and yes, our menus were closed on the table that whole time.  Our appetizer came fairly quick but our steaks took quite a while. We had the crab cake which i thought was pretty incredible. We saw a few tables who sat down after us get their food much quicker then we did.  Whatever, though, it was our anniversary and we had a great view of the fountains. I ordered a medium 18 oz t bone steak which ended up being more rare then I would like, and hubbies medium rare porterhouse steak looked medium. Steaks were tough to cut with the knife provided but melted n your mouth. It was delicious, as was the sauces they provided.  Our water glasses never went empty and that really was the only attentive service we received.  We were asked if we wanted coffee, which I replied yes, along with a dessert menu.  We got our menus right away and it took at least 20 minutes for someone to take our order.  When the waiter took our order, it was another 20 minutes before we got our creme brulee.  The waiter simply forgot because I looked up at him when he walked by our table and the look on his face was one of oh s*&^% forgot their desert.  He did apologize and since it was our anniversary, it was complimentary.  I was in great company but the amount of tip left on our bill reflected our dissatisfaction with our service.  Our total was $192 for the crab cake appetizer, two steaks, two baked potatoes, and some coffee.  Just a warning, they do allow smoking as it is outside, which can be not so pleasant when the smoke is blowing in your direction.  We also had a rowdy group at the table next to us who were quite loud and obnoxious but I understand the restaurant wouldn't want to lose a customer.  We had to ask for our check, as did everyone around us, so I guess that is not unusual.  For the ambiance, and hubby's company it was an enjoyable evening. I loved being so close to the fountains and enjoying them go off every 15 minutes.  We never got any spray and it was a bit windy while we were there.  If we decide to go to a high end restaurant for our next anniversary, we will probably check out another place."

I have to say that the manager and sommalier took care of us at the end when they realized how much of a jerk our server was but it really did leave a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\n3 of us went to this place instead of our usual tried and true Delmonico's at the Venitian. First thing we did was assess our budget. Looking at all the numbers, we figured we could spend just about $500 on our meal. We decided to go food heavy and budget on the wine (well, for this place that meant $100 for wine). \n\nOur server came by and I told him that we were on a wine budget and that we only had about $100 to spend and asked for some suggestions:\n\nme: '...can I find some good dry, full bodied reds for about $100?'\njerk: 'If you look HARD enough'\n\nI'm all, are you for real right now? Then he starts going down the wine list (which is huge and pretty darn impressive) and picking out all the ones that are $100 just based on price. So I tell him that I read numbers really well and that what I want is a suggestion.\n\nThen we start ordering and my friend asks if they have lobster tail for the table to share. Jerk says they have small and large sizes even though it's not on the menu and then says he'll be back with the prices. Comes back pretty quickly and says, 'the large is $168 so you guys will probably want to small one if you really want one'. My buddy is pretty pissed at this point and just based on that comment he orders the large. Jerk doesn't let it go and tries to convince my friend to order the small saying stuff like, 'it's better for you to order the small one'. At this point we are all pretty pissed, but it's been over a year since I've seen my friends so we try to brush it off.\n\nThe sommalier suggests a VERY nice silver oak for like $108 that turns out to be a really good wine so we're kicking back and enjoying our wine and the appetizers that came out super fast. The crab cakes were very good as well as the stuffed mushrooms. Everything cooked well with great flavors.\n\nThe steaks were also on the money. I'm partial to bone-in ribeyes and this one was really really good. Rare-plus is the way to go if you want to full juicy flavor of this bad boy.\n\nI slow down after eating almost half the steak and start wondering where the lobster tail is... I wave down Jerk and and ask him when the lobster is coming and he runs off and comes back and tells me 10 minutes. So I start digging into him why it would take so long and find out the he never put in the order. What's worse, he tried to blame it on my buddy, saying that we weren't sure if we really wanted to order or not and that's when I had enough and went off on the guy. I can be an a$$ at times and this called for all my a$$ness to come out, especially since I was fueled w/ Patron and Silver Oak. I chewed him out and asked for the manager.\n\nManager finally comes and she apologizes and all that stuff but at that point we were seriously fed up. I mean, I went on a rampage, brought up the service, asked if they were racist, asked if they didn't serve young people, you name it, I accused it. \n\nThe only thing that kept us from leaving was that the food was so dang good. I couldn't leave my perfectly cooked bone-in rib. It just didn't seem right. I'm sorry.\n\nWe ended up getting the lobster tail right away (delicious), ordered another side (on top of 3 others we ordered) and got 3 desserts. Molten cake - awesome, some italian cookie thingy with icecream in the middle - awesome, creme brulee - good. \n\nAt the end I figured we completely blew our budget but the manager came by with the bill and it was far less than about 1/3 of what we should have paid. I think they comped everything but our steaks and appetizers. \n\nWas it worth the price? Not sure. Was it good? Heck yeah. Would I go back? Only if my friend pays again."

My girlfriend and I sat down at the last seating (10 pm) and there was still plenty of commotion. The decor is very old fashioned and seems outdated and like I am in my grandmothers dining room. \n\nI prefer modern decor in an intimate setting where you can enjoy conversation and not feel rushed . This is not Prime.\n\nAs every other review points out, the food is good and so is the wine list.

(no pun intended : ),  The patio was closed due to the chill in the air. So,  we were seated right next to a window where the water was no less than 5' away.  From the very second we stepped into the Prime up to paying the check...it was an absolutely stunning evening.  The service was impeccable, classy and just what I was taught how it should be.  I ordered the beet salad and it was so good.  There were roasted beets on top of yogurt, no doubt.  LOVED the combination and never had thought of putting those 2 foods together.  My husband ordered the french onion soup which he said was the best he's ever had!  We both ordered the 16 oz. rib eye, med. rare!  The steaks were served still hot and perfectly cooked to our liking.  They put 3 different sauces on the table but, the steak was so good that a sauce just wouldn't do it justice.  Not a sauce person much anyway.  We had a side of the mushrooms and chickpea fries.  Excellent!  And all the time we were delicately devouring our dinner, the fountains entertained us over and over.  \n\nThis is a restaurant that will be revisited over and over by us.  It's pricey and I guess one has to pay for the view, as well.  But, such a lovely indulgence!"

Still picked up on this weird snootiness from Bob the whole time. We get our check, pay, sign. As were sitting there in the middle of our conversion, he flat out interrupts us, sticks his arm in front of our faces to take the signed check before we even left. Absolutely unprofessional and rude. You do not cut me off mid sentence and take the check from our table before we leave. This is not Denny's.

I'm saying this because of the following bold statement of the day: IT WAS AVERAGE. \n\nSo, did I miss something? I simply don't understand why it gets so many high ratings. It was very disappointing, to say the least. My steak was so incredibly dry that it tasted like something from Denny's (...yeah, gross). I'd rather spend money at Ruth Chris's or Flemings.  Anyways, let's get to the details. We ordered the following: \n\n1. Seafood appetizer (came with lobster, shrimp, oysters, crab, and clams) -- not bad, the seafood tasted quite fresh and delicious. I'm a fan. \n\n2. French onion soup -- please, do not burn the top of my soup. The top (the bread and cheese part) was so burned that I could actually taste it while drinking the soup. Uhmm, no. \n\n3. T-bone steak -- my steak was DRY. I asked for medium, but it was honestly well done. For $70, please do not overcook my steak. The others in my group agreed, their steak was overcooked. Major negative. \n\n4. Side dishes: macaroni and cheese (the cheese was WAY too strong), asparagus (good - but honestly, how can you go wrong with steamed asparagus?), sauteed spinach (ew - do NOT order this, the sauteed flavoring is just weird. trust me), baked potato (...it's a baked potato, nuff said) \n\n5. Caesar salad - standard. \n\nHonestly, i'm a huge steakhouse fan, and this has got to rank as one of my bottom choices in the future. Like I said, Ruth Chris's and Flemings tastes much better because the steaks are juicier and prepared with more detail. If i'm going to be paying $70 for a steak, the chefs should be sure to cook a steak medium if requested. This is just super disappointing..."

            "review": "We went here last night for dinner. This place is the essence of fine dining, so dress the part and definitely be prepared to spend some money. We chose this place based on the fact that it had great reviews and it had outdoor patio seating right on Bellagio lake, so we could be RIGHT in front of the fountain show. \nWe went there around 7:15 and were seated almost immediately. First we stopped by the bar to get ourselves two dirty gin martinis. They offer blue cheese olives which is a HUGE plus in my book. However, the martinis for $17 each and not blowing my mind is what disappointed me. But hey, that's why I always order extra olive juice on the side. We were seated right next to fence leading out into the water of the lake. We had about 2-3 people taking care of us. All of them were very attentive and useful for helping us decide what to order. \nFor an appetizer we got the steak tartar and carpaccio with an aioli sauce. HOLY MOLY was this orgasmic in my mouth. Extremely fresh and decadent! A must order! For dinner I got the sea bass. My boyfriend got the rare filet mignon (on the bone!! Something I've never seen before) and a side of mashed/whipped potatoes. The portion sizes were EXTREMELY generous, which made the prices (around $80-90 for the filet and $44 for the sea bass) worth it. The filet came with some sauces that I wasn't really a fan of for steak purposes, but I could definitely see them being great with other kinds of food. However, nothing could compare to the merlot reduction sauce we had at mon ami Gabi the night before. The mash potatoes were out of this world, and I'm not particularly a mashed potato fan. Dessert was surprise birthday treat. Some lava brownie with ice cream and a fudge decorated concoction with \"happy birthday\" and a candle. Very tasteful but couldn't be finished after our exquisite dinner. \nThroughout the meal we were amazed by the spectacular fountain show. At times we could actually feel the water mist. Just like the night before, the Vegas sunset during an outdoor dinner is beautiful. We watched the sky light dimmer down as the surrounding building lights slowly light up. However, I must say that if you end up dining indoors, you won't be disappointed. The decor is made of deep and light blues. It's quite magnificent. \nAll of the staff are professional and eager to please. You can tell by looking at the menu and tasting the food that chef has put A LOT of thought into the menu and likely makes a great effort to use he finest and freshest ingredients. Our main server, Paul or Kevin I want to say, was extremely useful and refreshingly honest in helping us decide what to order. He didn't try to push us into buying the most expensive items or getting more than we wanted. Also, I want to say thank you to the gentleman who actually walked me to the bathroom and opened the door for me, so I wasn't wondering around like a lost puppy, HAHA! \nThe only reason I don't give this place a full five stars is because of the prices. Although the portions are quite generous, I've experienced other amazing quality food and service at other steakhouses in other expensive cities like New York and DC, and haven't seen prices THIS high. However, Prime is an indulgence nonetheless, and there's no doubt in my mind that you won't walk away extremely happy with your experience there. \nOverall,  I'm a very pleased customer. Last but not least, if you're an M Life member like me, just give them your M life member card when you get your check, and you'll be able to add points to your M life account...so your expensive indulgence will probably benefit towards a comp later :)\nENJOY!"

It makes you feel like a classy person when you're in Prime and that goes for the price of your food as well. For the price and the taste of your food, you can probably get better steakhouses(Craft or SW ). \n\nI did quite enjoy having the sauces on the side which give it a nice little spin to it. However, I only end up using one and we never got one of the 4 sauces( the miso-mustard). I was a big fan of the soy-rice wine sauce which was a winner for me(I believe there was garlic in it) Moving on, the steak was good quality but it didn't exactly differ too much from other steak houses(including Mastro where I get Porterhouse as well) for a more inexpensive price than I would rather go back to Mastros. On a side note, what did win for me in Prime was their sides. Their sides were one of the better sides that I've had(way better than SW) in my opinion. The mac and cheese which was layer with lot of truffle(yay) was quite awesome and so was the mash potatoes. \n\nOh the service was wonderful and they didn't charge us for a bottle of wine that we brought(usually it would be $50 so be warned)...probably because our bottle of wine was too cheap for them :p. Whatever the case, I like that they didn't charge for us it. The dessert were okay. \n\nYou can give it a try when you are in Vegas but the winner for steakhouses for me is definitely Craft.

I was not impressed with the steak, again I would say above average at most. I did like the soy based dipping sauce but it almost overpowered the natural flavor of the steak. So with that said, I could of used practically any meat and dipped it into that sauce and it would probably taste the same. I didn't care much for the other sauces including the bearnaise. (bearnaise, usually is my preferred sauce with a steak)\n\nOn the other hand, their Truffle Mash Potatoes.. I must say is impeccable!

Not only is the food and service impeccable, this is the best place to see the Bellagio water show, which plays every 15 mins after 8 pm.  It's an emotional experience from the windows and ambiance of the restaurant.   If you're here in the summer, they have a patio where you can have a romantic dinner on the terrace over looking the water.  \n\nWhen you're in Vegas, it's nice to get away from the lights for a few hours, and devour a decadent meal.  The decor here is subtle, reminds me of the London West Hollywood.  Warm candle light, with hints of modern styled art deco patterned glass on the ceilings, and the walls.  Luxurious velvet curtains in deep browns and periwinkle, and fresh cut cymbidium orchids (my favorite).  \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR FOOD: \nYou really can go wrong here, but Here are my faves from the menu: \n-Succulent Lamb Chops \n-Bone in Fillet \n-MUST TRY Warm Shrimp Salad.  (Worth coming into the bar and ordering this with a glass of wine)\n-Side of Crab Leg\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR WINE: \nIf you've won big at the slots while you're at Vegas, by all means indulge.  They have an extensive wine list, some rare French wines that run over $60,000!  If you're looking for robust red wine at a reasonable price point, try Faust, Cabernet 2006.  \n\nSometimes you get what you pay for, and at Prime, the ambiance, the service, the food does not disappoint.  Indulge while you're in Vegas.  Life is short;  Live a little."

The location was enough to make this a 5 star location.  Every 15 minutes, you are enchanted by the fountains of Bellagio.  What else do you need?  You can get full of that! But luckily, this place serves amazing food as well.\n\nSeafood Platter:  A medley of raw oysters, raw clams, lobster, king crab legs, mussels, shrimp and a mixture of dipping sauces.  The oysters were extremely fresh and sweet.  The lobster was cooked well.  Not chewy.  The king crab legs were brine-y but also sweet in flavor.  The shrimp may have been one of the best shrimp cocktails I have ever had.\n\nFilet Mignon: Ordered medium rare and it came out medium rare.  What a shocker.  No matter where I go, it's always so hard to get a steak delivered to your preference.  The meat was tender, not salty.  Dip it in their special soy dipping sauce, which the waiter said goes well with anything, and you are in carnivore heaven. After the platter,  you don't have any more space for the whole filet but you will want to eat it all.\n\nTruffle Mashed Potatoes:  Creamy, rich goodness with the essence of truffle throughout.  SOOOO Good.  A must try when you are there.  Sprinkles of truffle on top.  Be shady and just scoop the top layer so you can get all the truffle flavor that your taste buds can handle.\n\nThe service was also amazing.  Waiters (and waitresses) were very attentive: always refilling water, refilling wine, providing details of the dishes and always asking if everything is OK.  Very polite and also very personable.\n\nHad a great time at Prime.  The location was already amazing but the food and service topped it all off."

Everyone was in place and the guests all looked fantastic. \n\nThe food was of course really expensive and the portions were small. We all took a group photo.. and each guest got a copy that was very nice so we could remember the evening. \n\nUntil the manager realized he had made a mistake and they were not paid for. He immediately took all the photos back and told us if we wanted them we had to purchase them for $40!! \n\nAll in all it was a good time, long walk for Aria Hotel but I would say it was worth it."

We just came out from the Pacquiao Bradley fight and has reservations here.  \nLet me say, I would normally have been taken back by the prices, but since I was 'in Vegas', I figured I would just roll with it. \nConclusion: I spent a lot of money, however, I really enjoyed the experience and the food. \n\nI had the filet mignon, and my gf had the lobster tail. The main entrees wee great.  The sides were also exceptional. They were pricey for side dishes but they did not disappoint. \nThe best part was the 'house sauce' steak sauce. I forget the name but it was a ginger-soy sauce., that was crucial to the overall party going on inside my mouth! \n\nScrumptious, to say the least. \n\nNow, one thing j really didn't appreciate at first was the photographer chick that shower up at our table and asked us if we would \"line our procured taken\".  \nLook, my gf is Asian and as you should know -- Asians like to take pictures. She is no exception. So, there we were.   \"taking pictures\".\nThe initial result there was a $70 cost. But, the nice part is we have a 4 pack of nice pictures of that moment -/ which was very forced. ..  By the photographer. \nAnyway, it was still very special and since I was 'in Vegas' -- I rolled with it and had a great time. \n\nThumbs up, Prime!"

At first I though it was odd that they were serving three different sauces with steak but it really caters to each individuals taste buds and is a brilliant idea. The restaurant ambience is perfections with their drapes, curtains, and dim lighting. Most importantly the view from the restaurant is breathtaking because you can see and enjoy the bellagio fountain show up close while you're eating. The sides here and everything they serve is cooked to perfection. I go back every year now, whenever I got to Vegas!"

Husband and I were there for our 1 anniversary on July 4th, 2010. \n\nFOOD\nWe both enjoyed the Filets, Au Gratin Potatoes, which were the most delicious, decadent foods I've ever eaten. The Bearnaise sauce was the best I've ever experienced. They also brought a few other sauces like a peppercorn mustard and another I can't quite remember...all good.\n\nSERVICE\nSpectacular. Helpful and always attentive. They brought us a little desert for our anniversary and made sure we always had everything we wanted.\n\nATMOSPHERE\nIt's dark, plush and very romantic. The place settings and dinnerware were of high quality as expected. We sat next to a window overlooking the fountains of the Bellagio. It was after 7pm so it was dark and the lights were beautiful. When you make your reservation ask for a window seat or the patio (in the summer).\n\nOVERALL\nFirst, the filets are easily the best on the strip. The price is a little on the high side as compared to other places where you can fill your stomach. But it is a high-end establishment for a high-end clientele. If you're the type of person who is concerned about $8 bottled water, then Prime may not be the place for you. \n\nIf you can drop around $200-300 (two people) for an excellent meal and it doesn't deplete your entire vacation fund, then I probably don't need to tell you that this is a must. Highly recommended. Go here, enjoy life because it's probably one of the best experiences you'll have.\n\nBIO\nJennifer(27) and Chris(31) are Vegas fanatics. Enjoying multiple trips every year, they continuously search for new and delicious findings Las Vegas has to offer."

It has lost some of its class. It use to be a quiet, intimate atmosphere. It now has a hectic feel to it. The background noise is terrible. But to the dinner. We love the chilled seafood platter. It is still good but the crab legs were soggy and size of the platter has decreased by a third, with an increase in price. \nMy wife had the Australian lobster. It was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I had the dry aged bone in ribeye. I always order it med+. It arrived undercooked. I did not send it back but probably should have. The sides have always been excellent. We split the steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes. Still excellent. Prime is still one of our favorites and I'm sure we'll be back.

When we arrived we were shown right to our table.  \n\nWhen I opened the menu I was struck by how simple it was, there weren't a billion choices it was just simple and to the point.  Our server was very attentive to the details and we had an awesome dining experience.  Our waiter also reminded me of the butler from Mr Deeds.  When I came back from the restroom, I didn't notice anyone around me when I went to sit down.  But as I was moving my seat forward there was a slight push from the back, I thought I had bumped into the seat behind me.  I turned around and there was our server, whoa like super sneaky.  When I told the waiter of my stomach not feeling well, he suggested right away soda water to help settle my stomach.  He also very patient with my lack of knowledge to pair which red wine to the filet mignon my dad was having.  We also ordered the Ribbons of Tuna, Truffle Mashed Potatoes, and Creamed Spinach.    \n\nThe Ribbons of Tuna was a very nicely designed dish.  The tuna sashimi was top grade because there were no lines running through them.  There was finely chopped avocado at the bottom of the dish with a sauce containing yuzu and a slight hint of spicy oil.  It was delicious, so light and tasty a great way to start a meal.  \n\nI specifically requested that the butternut squash soup be brought out as my entree since that was going be my main course.  And the staff brought it out exactly the way I wanted to.  The filet mignon came with three sauces the soy rice wine was my dad's favorite.  The Truffle mashed potatoes were fluffy and had little chopped up pieces of truffle which brought a nice texture to the dish.  I wasn't able to try the creamed spinach and it looked ok.\n\nOverall the service was spot on, attention to detail is the way I like it, and the food was outstanding.  O yeah we also got a nice view of the fountains outside which was like the cherry on top of the ice cream.  I highly recommend this restaurant and its a great stop in Vegas."

Ambiance makes all of the difference and this was over the top! We highly recommend the patio if you are lucky enough to score one of the few choice tables. We dined later in the evening which probably why we were able to land the choice patio seat. Prime has always been rated as one of the top steakhouses in Las Vegas but they also have a great selection of seafood. My seared rare tuna steak lightly coated in pepper was among the best I've had. My spouse and our guest shared a beautifully prepared 10 ounce filet but certainly could have chosen many other prime cuts that looked utterly amazing at the surrounding tables. Large selection of sides to share made our meals complete. Service\nIs certainly among the best too with multiple attendants hovering over us in a respectful manner. It's a \"prime\" experience dining a Prime."

Where the \"brown\" libations are over the top.\n\nAt Prime, the menu is seasonally updated.  The fall of 2012 features an outstanding, air flown colossal stone crab appetizer (three huge claws the size of your hand with a pile of knuckle and leg meat).  Heaven and at $75, and worth every penny.  Sweet.  Perfect.  The steak tartar on a platter of Carpaccio is delicious but slightly unbalanced with over the top Asian spice heat.  Finally, the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Wow.  The fat of the bacon permeates the rich, sweet flesh of the barely cooked through shrimp.  Outstanding.\n\nBeef mains are to die for.  Japanese A5 Kobe cuts of beef (4oz minimum $35 per ounce).  Sublime if you don't over indulge.  A four to six ounce portion is enough for anyone.  Offered in a strip, rib, or fillet cut.  The rib is the most flavorful.  DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU WANT YOUR BEEF COOKED BEYOND RARE.  You are wasting your money as the fat will melt during cooking and the beef taste like any other piece of beef.\n\nThe 30 day dry aged, bone fillet is excellent.  Huge umame finish without tasting edgy.  Soft and tender.  The veal chop is equally good.  Sweet, deep beef flavor from free ranged calves.  Double cut, perfectly seared and moist throughout.  \n\nAll mains come with sauces and sides.  They match and are very flavorful but do not pass on ordering some veg and off the menu potato dauphinois to share.  Sides are perfectly cooked.  Rich and refreshing.\n\nKiller wine list with great depth of cult wines.  Great values to be found at higher price points (best priced Screaming Eagle in Vegas). Outstanding cognac selection.\n\nService is excellent.  Friendly and extremely efficient.\n\nNote:  Unlike most Vegas restaurants, for reservations, you MUST be a high status member of Mlife to book the best tables and times on short notice.  If you use OpenTable, make your reservation at least 60 days in advance  Outdoor and window tables where you can view the incredible fountain show at the Bellagio are very difficult to secure.\n\nA truly memorable experience in Vegas not afforded to everyone.  Do whatever it takes to try it.  \n\nA dozen plus visits since my initial review.  Extremely consistent.  Highly Recommended."

I think maybe it was a little overcooked since my shrimp wasn't as succulent as I would have thought it to be and the bacon was a tad dry.\n\nSteaks, however, were really good. We got the filet mignon and the porterhouse. Filet was soo soft, melted in your mouth. Porterhouse was equally as amazing.

Then, to top it off, we had a nice window view of the Bellagio fountain and of the Paris hotel.\n\nPhuong, our server was also quite helpful with his recommendation of the 28-day aged rib-eye steak with crab mashed potatoes. He also recommended that we pair it with a pinot noir, which we did. The meal was splendid. I only wished that he had mentioned how big the rib-eye steak was going to be... It looked like it could be a 32-oz steak. Wow. Ok, I can eat, but not quite that much. I ended up boxing half of mine to go. I especially loved the crab mashed potatoes -- what a perfect combination of two of my favorite food: shellfish AND mashed potatoes (the perfect side dish for steaks, in my opinion). \n\nWe also ordered a key lime pie for dessert with espresso. I enjoyed the pie a lot. It came with a thin layer of rock sugar in the middle. Crunchy and sweet, like candy. \n\nNext time, if we come here again, I'd like to split the surf and turf.

The steak I ordered to be pink inside, not runny red, turned out to be red in the WHOLE middle of the filet mignon.  I had to eat only the outside edges of the steak.  Even the $14 baked potato was not baked to complete softness.  Come on!!  Everything is overpriced, of course, as is expected in a tourist town, but please make the steak to order and bake your darn potatoes long enough.  Gee.  The servers were nice, but could have come by the table more often.  The restaurant was gracious enough to provide a special request I had made in advance for my disabled sister and I do thank them for that."

Our server was knowledgeable and very attentive.\n\nThe wine list was 24 pages long! I had a glass of Rhumbauer Chardonnay ($15), an 8 oz. Filet ($40), a side caesar salad ($14), and potatoes gratin daphinois ($8). The filet was hands down the BEST STEAK I HAVE EVER HAD. It was tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The caesar salad was a little lemony, but still very tasty. The potatoes were amazing. Basically potatoes au gratin, but with several different cheeses (Gruyere, Reggiano, etc.). However, one of my friends ordered a $150 Kobe ribeye, which was overcooked. He didn't send it back, but I'm positive if he had, it would have come out perfectly.\n\nWe had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain show and we weren't even directly by a window! This will go down as one of the best meals of my life."

They enforce the dress code pretty strict here, most places in Vegas will let you in wearing just about anything. This is a 1 or 2 page menu place, alot of expensive steaks, and sides you would expect in a high end steakhouse. The iced shell fish platter here is killer!  It's a quite beautiful piece. My wife had a bone in fillet which was fantastic. Don't ask for a wine recommendation from the waiter unless you won some serious cash  at the baccarat table.

Truffle mashed is a must have while the Brussels sprouts were also good.  Great wine selection but best part was the availability of wine by the glass.  Although common at most steak houses their list had some great choices.  We had the 2008 silver oak which nice and smooth.  We were so full that dessert was not an option. However to put the cherry on top they brought out a chocolate souffl\u00e9 with ice cream on a beautifully prepared plate. I had forgotten that I included my wife's birthday on the reservation.

Started with squash soup and Seared Foie Gras both were good. The ambiance is fantastic with the Bellagio surroundings and the memorizing fountain... stunning. It is very pricy, but inline with higher-end Las Vegas showcase restaurants.  \n\nSo the negatives: I started the meal by ordering a dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives, it was very good. The problem is they started slamming down plates as soon as the drink was served.  I hardly had time for a few sips before the super fast service started.  It was Go Go speed racer style service. It felt very rushed. The rushed plating and service made the experience feel very touristy. The waiter forgot our wine order, we had to remind him. This seems especially bad for a fine steak house to fail to service up the ordered wine with the main course., a fat juice steak, that begs for a big red wine. I would assign most of our negative experience at the hands of the waiter... he seemed distracted and lacked the finer art of high quality service."

Was given the wine list and menu and our overbearing waiter wanted to get my wine order even before i was able to look at the menu or hear if they had any specials.  I asked if there were any wines on special as the wines on the list are over-pricey.  He said no and that i should consider wines by the glass or half bottles.  The 2012 Husic Estate Cabernet Sauvignon was listed at $65 per glass. Now, i don't know how much wine is in the glass, i suspect NOT MUCH, but since the bottle retails for less than $100 and the restaurant likely got the bottle for around $60, i'd say that was serious gouging.  Suffice it to say that the wait staff was so haughty, snooty, overbearing and money-grubbing, that we opted to JUST LEAVE and NOT get any of the overpriced items on the menus.  We went to Olives, also at Bellagio, and were taken care of by a wonderful Chris instead."

            "review": "Prime has the winning combination which is great food in a scenic location.\n\nThe location feels very secluded and separate from the chaos of the strip. The restaurant is on the lower level along the fountains. We made a reservation and were able to get a table next to one of the large windows in front of the fountains. The table was even set so that my husband and I were both facing the beautiful view. \n\nThe feel of the restaurant is swanky and regal, but without being stiff and pretentious. The design of the restaurant was very appealing. \n\nOur service was good as you'd hope it would be in a restaurant like this. Our waiter insisted on taking photos of my husband and I when he saw me doing my Yelp thing. The waiter and server were never far, but not in a hovering manner. \n\nBefore coming here I read so many articles talking this restaurant up and the food lived up to the hype. I had the 10 ounce Filet Mignon and my husband had the 14 ounce Peppercorn-Crusted New York Strip. We shared the Gratin Dauphinois. \n\nThe Filet Mignon was perfectly prepared, tender and flavorful. The 10 ounces was more than enough meat. The Peppercorn-Crusted New York Strip's peppercorn crust was delicious and seasoned well. This steak was also well prepared and flavorful. The Gratin Dauphinois was a sizeable portion for two. There was plenty of cheese sauce in the dish and broiled on top. Delicious.\n\nOne of the unique things about this steakhouse is that they bring out three steak sauces. The sauces offered were Soy-Rice Wine, Bearnaise, and Peppercorn. I loved all three and enjoyed trying them on both of the steaks. The meats didn't need sauce, but I always love a good sauce.\n\nWe finished the meal by splitting the Apple Pie with Maple Ice Cream. It arrived bubbling and hot. This appears to be a dish that is freshly prepared with each order.I loved the flavor of the apple pie and the delicious maple ice cream on top.\n\nHaving been to a few of the steakhouses now I would rate this among some of the best. The food is great, but the view and puts it over the top."

It really felt VIP like to sit that close to the fountain and with a sun burn getting the mist from the fountain show upon its completion was an added bonus.\n\nCollectively we had the same problem with our steaks. We both ordered the filet mignon medium and it was more of a how to cook steak diagram. The ends were burnt, the middle was far from medium, and that just didn't cause for a great feeling. We also ordered crab mashed potatoes which were way too buttery and the crunchy potatoes which certainly lived up to that, but that's NOT a good thing. It was too crisp on the outside and mashed in the middle, but the taste honestly just wasn't there.\n\nThe worst feeling overall was hearing my wife feel like she didn't belong there. It seemed from the very beginning the staff felt that as well and displayed that all through the meal. It seemed they looked down on us and my wife even said one of them ran to our table after we left just to make sure we paid. REALLY? If I was in the right mindset I would have dealt with that, but honestly Karma is a you know what.\n\nTruth be told they can continue to prepare sub par side orders and wow with a chef who clearly didn't know a medium prepared steak without us. Now drench your house made steak sauce in that Prime!"

I have also eaten at the neighboring Picasso which is great but doesn't come close to Prime(unless you are talking about the art on the wall). While not cheap (and not meant to be), Prime is flawless in terms of food, atmosphere, service, and has a comprehensive wine list and knowledgable sommeliers.\nWhile I am not a fan of ordering massive seafood platters where the restaurant gets huge margins on serving you a couple meager crustaceans on a heaping bowl of ice, I must say Prime's shrimp cocktail and Florida stone crab (when in season) are as good as it gets. Their accompanying sauces are also phenomenal.\nThe steaks are nothing short of perfect. I usually go with a small 8 oz. filet which is cooked rare plus and is very dense yet tender and consistent throughout. Their steak sauces are unparalleled. My personal favorite is the soy rice wine sauce... simply amazing. Their sides are solid - I keep it simple with mashed potatoes and asparagus.\nI have read some reviews of Mastro's in Bevelry Hills which gets 4-5 stars per review. I have eaten @ Mastro's twice and was not excited by my meal either time. In my opinion I would eat @ Prime any day over Mastro's and I could not recommend a finer steakhouse in Vegas."

Asked for fountain view seating, outdoors if possible, and asked  for a special dessert item.  We did indeed have a fountain view, in the corner with another couple (not with our party) practically sitting on top of us, with my back to the view.  The outdoor area was open but that request was not noted on our reservation in their book (although it was listed on my email confirmation) and was full.  The food itself was of high quality, cooked to perfection, and very tasty in and of itself, but ruined by bitter sauces.  I could not finish my sea bass as the sauce was literally making me feel sick.  My guest enjoyed his steak but again, the sauce garnishing the plate left a lot to be desired and enough of it saturated his filet that he could not enjoy it nearly as much as he should have.  The dessert item was available and they did bring out a petit tray of complimentary truffles with a candle for my friend, which was appreciated.  Overall though, not worth our time or money."

A buser filled our waters repeatedly but trying to get any other drinks was pretty much well pointless.  The atmosphere is beautiful and romantic but most tables do not have a view of the fountains which is a shame. They also seem to rush out the smaller tables as well.  We were done under an hour.

Portion was so big that we both only ate half of our steak.  \n\nAlthough we didn't sit near the window with the fountain view,  I was still able to see the spectacle.

While there to celebrate a friend's birthday, I felt that Prime is one of the classiest places to dine, truly a creme de la creme place to celebrate any special occasion. We were treated superbly well by our server who was charming and gave sound advice as to what wines to complement with the types of entrees we planned to have as well the types of side dishes that would work best with the entrees.  \nAnother high point was the professional photographer Grace walked among the tables offering to take (and sell framed) photographs of the patrons, and I'm so happy we took her up on the offer as her control of the lighting effects on camera, the way she was able to \"direct\" us and take the photos made us 5 already beautiful women look even better in the photos that turned out.  Her service/product provided a wonderful keepsake for all of us from this special birthday occasion.\nIn hindsight, although I loved my 14-oz New York steak (medium well is perfect) and its soy-ginger reduction, 14-oz was definitely WAY too big for me (eyes bigger than stomach, what can I say :-).  If you are 5'6\" woman like me who usually can barely finish a 8- or 10-oz steak, I'd stick to the 8-10 oz steak selections, not to mention the super yummy sides will take up room in the belly too.\nWatch out for the very expensive wines (by the glass, I ordered a $40/glass Cab to go with my entree). The wine was delicious but they are definitely on the premium price side even by the glass.  Ask for corkage fee if you can bring your own wine.\nOverall, a beautiful place to dine with excellent food and service.  Would love to go back again."

I made a last min reservation by phone 4 hrs before going but only because it was a Monday night and we didn't expect it to be too busy. The place closed at 10pm that night and I was able to get a reservation for 2 at 9:30pm, the hostess had mentioned that they were actually busy for a Monday night. The moment you step foot into the restaurant the light is a lot dimmer, and to the right is the restaurant Bar top with about 8-10 stools and to the left the hostess stand. The restaurant decor was fancy with lots of paintings on the walls and pretty blue ceiling to floor curtains that are pinned to the walls. Once we were seated the waiter came to the table with menus and gave us a few recommendations. My bf ordered the bone in ribeye and I ordered filet mignon, they were absolutely delicious! Cooked perfectly on the outside but yet juicy and tender on the inside. Neither were overly seasoned! For our sides we ordered the Mac and cheese, gooey and creamy and has to be one of the best I've had, and the creamed spinach. The creamed spinach wasn't amazing, was a little bland but ok since it was a healthier choice. They do start you off with sourdough and raisin bread with butter in the beginning and both were delicious! We each got a cocktail, one steak each and two sides to share and the bill came out to 220.00 without tip. It was well worth it and more importantly, worth it to see my boyfriend satisfied. We would definitely come here again!"

Our filets were requested medium but came out undercooked. The fries and onion rings that came out at the same time were cold. Once our steaks returned 5 minutes later  they were cooked appropriately and were very tender and well seasoned. The sever rarely checked on the table.

My family went for dinner on Christmas Eve and everything was just so well done it is difficult to express just how good it was.  Firstly the bread that comes is exquisite, there is a compilation of breads with a chive salt and butter and the rolls are hot and fresh and perfect.  The salads seemed steep for a side salad but in reality, they are nearly a full meal in themselves and really we did not need a salad and dinner but we did not realize it would be so big.  I had the mixed fall vegetable salad and it came with a whole wheel of goat chevre with delicate vegetables in a vinaigrette.  My father  had the Caesar Salad and Butternut squash soup which were dynamite.  My mother had a truffle salad and it was just a touch woodsy for my taste.  Where this place really shines though is the steak, oh the glorious steak.  I had the mammoth 18 oz bone in ribeye cooked medium rare.  For $66 it was an absolute bargain.  The meat was so flavorful and tender and perfectly cooked, no gristle and perfect melt in your mouth fat.  My father went one bigger and had the 28oz steak and even though he had it cooked to well done it was still tender and juicy.  My mother had the Short rib which was a bit over salty but still really good and sweet.  The side dishes were also very good, the Brussel sprouts are well worth getting and the gnocchi is so soft and pillowy they are truly heavenly. We also had the macaroni and cheese which was standard fare but good and the potatoes dauphanoise which were just a bit dry and over done.  \nIn all though for the service and truly reasonable price for the amazing meal that you get this place is well worth a visit for some special occasion, indeed I wish that I was rich enough to eat here every night I don't think I could get tired of all of the truly exceptional food and atmosphere that this place provides."

I looked up Open Table reservation availability, and the place seemed to be booked up from 5:45 to 8:30, which overlapped with our show, so I made our reservation for an early dinner at 5:30. I just want to note that throughout dinner, the place was only half full, so I don't know why Open Table said it was booked up. Was it to promote exclusivity? I don't know.\n\nAnyway, I had written in our reservation that a view of the fountains would be appreciated. The first table we were escorted to was against the wall and in a corner with a slight view. It was an OK spot, but considering that pretty much every other table was empty with no one in sight, we requested to be seated more centrally at the window. Our request was met with some trepidation as apparently that particular table was booked. Again, half-full restaurant at 5:30. It still confuses me. Anyway, finally we were moved.\n\nWe were greeted by...a sommelier? A waiter? I'm not sure. Leaning towards waiter. He was not particularly friendly. When my husband asked for a recommendation, he was kind of gruff and short. Not the best sell. He gave us the wine list and we ordered two drinks (lemon drop for me,wine for husband). After this, he disappeared, and another waiter (Asian, bald head) took over in his place. Maybe the first waiter was covering for this one? In any case, neither of them introduced themselves. In fact, in the ten minutes between them we looked at our menus and then the second guy showed up. His greeting was, \"ready to order\"? In most places, this would be really no big deal. But if you're a steak house who prides yourself on service and class, introductions should always be made. Not to mention you're in the Bellagio and it's not even particularly busy.\n\nWe ordered. Went with truffled mashed potatoes and a tomato salad with burrata cheese, filet mignon for me and rib eye for my husband. We wanted to also try the macaroni and cheese but the waiter was particularly judgmental about this, telling us everything would be more than enough. I'm sorry, but if the waiter is not asked this particular question, they should not comment. This is not a tapas place and maybe we wanted to sample a little of everything? Especially if people note it should be tasted. I was really turned off by this. Personally, I didn't eat all day so that I could indulge in everything that I wanted. He kind of made the decision for me when reciting back what we ordered.  I was incredibly uncomfortable and felt judged for my appetite, so I didn't put up a fight and told my husband to keep quiet as well. I've been to many fine steakhouses and this has NEVER happened before. \n\nThe food is what deserved the stars, but the service negated a lot of points. The truffle potatoes are worthy of all the praise. The salad was delicious. My steak was a little red for my liking, even at medium rare, but still yummy. I liked that the steak came with three sauces to sample, and really enjoyed the house speciality sauce. It was a bit of a soy sauce Asian blend. My husband also enjoyed his steak. Interestingly, I noted that a woman to my left got the same steak, but the same waiter offered to...cut it up for her? And to my right, the first waiter who was so gruff with us, was practically kvelling and gossiping with the two older ladies next to us.  Did we look like degenerates? Um, answer is no. I had on a beautiful dress and my husband a beautiful Italian suit. But nevertheless, it seemed like we were targeted as...not big spenders? Not worthy of attentiveness? Who knows.\n\nThe only star at that restaurant is the waiter that comes around and refills the water glasses and removes the dishes. He was friendly and chatty and we would have rather tipped him 20% than the guy we did.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we were given a free dessert in celebration of our anniversary. It was ok. More chocolate cursive letters than dessert. But hey, it was free. This pleasantness was again negated by having to wait for the check for 40 minutes. Once the waiter had collected our credit card and finally come back, he tried to hand it to me. The name on the credit card is clearly one for a man.  It exemplifies the lack of polish here, as at any other fine restaurant, the credit card would be handed back by name to the person who possesses it (and it's pretty easy to tell who did between the two of us and similarly so if you note the person handing it off to you before you swipe it). Even places like TGI Friday's do this. \n\nAnyway, I would never come back to this style over substance establishment even if the truffle potatoes are at the top of my favorite foods to eat in Vegas. There are better places to dine. Even in my hometown of Philadelphia, Del Frisco's outclasses this place by miles!"

My party and I arrived a little before 7 and the place was packed, the bar was overflowing with people.  I checked in with the hostess and was told it'll be a moment while they set up our table.  Ten minutes later she tells me that there are no tables available overlooking the fountains.  I said it fine, just seat us anywhere.  Finally, thirty minutes later we were finally seated at some cramped up table next to the restrooms.  How lovely. \n\nService was slow.  Food was whatever.  My brother ordered the special surf and turf.  Lobster was way rubbery and dry.  His steak was alright.  I ordered the special kobe beef plate.  It had 3 oz of each rib eye, filet mignon, and boneless sirloin.  A total of 9 oz of kobe for $240.  It was the most expensive plate I ever ordered.  And sadly I wasn't really that impressed by the food.  I had ordered them medium and the filet was beyond well done.  Sigh.  I had nothing to say about our sides and starters.  The wine we ordered was the only good thing about the meal.  I usually am a big fan of dessert but I was so thrown off by the food that I had to skip dessert.  \n\nFor our party of four, our bill ran out to a little over $600.  Thank God it was comped by the hotel (thanks to my mom's love of the slot machines), otherwise I would have had to make a run for it. I suggest dining at Michael Mina or Picasso when at the Bellagio.  Prime Steakhouse is for old folks with limited taste and too much time and too much money on their hands.  I feel a little bad saying that, especially since it seems like so many other people on Yelp enjoyed this place."

All the food was great the the few steaks we had and the tuna and all the sides were all great.  The only reason i'm not giving this place a 5 is that they have an old school dress code requiring pants and my father in law had to get a \"loaner pair\" from them.  As long as you wear pants, this place is great!!!"

The sauces only compliment what is already a perfect steak, and this place has only cemented my love for chef Jean Georges Vongerichten.

I had the ribeye which was impressive but not the best I've ever had.  It had decent flavor and was actually quite tender.  My friends each had the filet. They seemed satisfied but not blown away.  They had three different sauces to go with the steaks.  This isn't really my style as most good steakhouses let the meat speak for itself.  Also, I found it odd that even though we ordered different cuts of meet, we got the same sauces to go on our meet.  Shouldn't a world class chef be more creative?  Also, the server was unable to tell  which sauces were better for each cut.  \n\nTheir wine list was impressive and had all of the Napa wines you would expect to see and most other good Caliornia wines.  We went for a bottle of Justin Isosceles.  It was a very good bordeaux blend that paired well with our steaks.  \n\nThe server was friendly but might have been more appropriate for casual dining than a fine steakhouse.  He joked with us that our table was typically one of the worst in the restaurant because it was one of the only tables without a view of the Bellagio fountains.  We were a group of successful 20-somethings so I'm used to not getting the best service but to make it blatant that the hostess gave us the worst table in the restaurant sort of ruined the meal.  Honestly, we hadn't even realized the other tables had a view until he said this and never would have even realized it was a bad table but once he said something, we were left wondering why we were given a bad table."

We were lucky and got a table with a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nService could not have been better. Our service team was attentive but not annoying. Everything was timed perfectly, dishes cleared properly, etc. \n\nI started with the black and blue martini. Gin and blue cheese stuffed olives with a sprig of rosemary. It was good but the rosemary was overpowering. Gin is so aromatic already, I felt like it was ruined with the rosemary. I quickly pulled it out and enjoyed the rest. \n\nThey bring out a complimentary bread basket. Pretty basic with two types of bread and regular butter. Nothing special. \n\nFor my appetizers I had the bacon wrapped shrimp. They were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. I also had a wedge salad. It was good but pretty standard as far as wedge salads go. I have had better. \n\nThe steak that I ordered was great. New York strip medium rare. It was done perfectly and had great flavor. You can choose peppercorn or some type of glaze on your steak. I chose peppercorn but should have ordered it plain. They bring out three kinds of sauces with the steaks, so it's probably better to try the steak plain and add sauce on your own. It didn't disappoint though. \n\nFor sides I had baby brussels sprouts with pear and bacon (a special that night) and also had potatoes gratin. Delicious!! \n\nDessert was a very slight let down. I had the pumpkin creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was more like pumkinless creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e but still good as far as a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e goes. \n\nThey have nice restrooms within the restaurant. Anyone familiar with Las Vegas restaurants knows that having restrooms within the restaurant itself is a treat. They also provide Molton Brown soap and lotion. Nice touch! \n\nI will definitely return to Prime at Bellagio. \n\nEnjoy!"

The food was exceptional- bacon wrapped shrimp, beet salad, wedge salad, short ribs and garlic soy steak, asparagus, au grautin potatoes plus 1 mojito and 1 cosmo. The flavors of each item were amazing. \n\nSo why not 5 stars? We were shoe horned into a corner next to 2 very large parties and the service by our main waiter was lacking. The other waiters  were very attentive.\n\nWould we return- yes after we save up money as this is definitely an over $300 meal for 2 people."

            "review": "My husband and I dined here this past weekend before going to see \"O\" while in town. He had been once before with a group in the private room and raved about the whole experience so I was excited to try it. \n\n\nThe ambiance and decor is absolutely stunning, as was the view of the fountain. Super romantic and very elegant. We actually had the same server (initially) that my husband had previously but my husband remembered him because he provided such great service. I believe his name was Danny. We picked out a bottle of wine and perused the menu. After we ordered the wine, we placed our order with someone entirely different, he did not introduce himself other than to say 'I'm Danny's assistant' when we looked at him with confusion. Ok fine- they are busy so makes sense. But we literally never saw Danny again at our table. My husband and I both assumed it was because we ordered a moderately priced bottle of wine and as soon as we were labeled as not big spenders we were ignored. Just because I'm not spending thousands of dollars here does that mean I don't deserve excellent service?? Don't get me wrong, the assistant was very nice but it just wasn't the same experience. \n\nOur food was very good - I'd say 4 stars. Started with the hamachi which was divine. Then we each had the butternut squash soup which was just ok. Kind of bland and very stingy on the mushrooms. It came with maybe 4 mushroom slices when that was listed as a key ingredient on the menu?? I ordered the filet (wish they offered a petite version) which was well executed but not the best I've had. My husband had the dry aged rib eye and he loved it. We also tried the brussel sprouts and mushroom sides. Be warned - the brussel sprouts come with potatoes even though it's not listed on the menu. We don't eat potatoes and would not have ordered them if we had known. Mushrooms were delicious. \n\nMy biggest issue wasn't the service snub or the fact that we have had better steak for less money. It was overall service. Only one word to describe it: GLACIAL. Our food took FOREVER. After we ordered we looked around and noticed that no one in sight had food in front of them. That's a scary sign. Our appetizer took 45 minutes to come out. It was 5 slices of raw fish. What takes so long?!? Finally at 9:20 I had to inform our server (Danny's assistant) that we needed to leave by 9:45 at the very latest to catch the show. He had a look of panic on his face but said sure he'd do what he could. Our steaks came quickly after that and we did leave on time so I appreciate the efforts made but we were so rushed we didn't get a chance to enjoy our expensive meal or finish our wine. Instead of it being romantic it gave us a slight bit of anxiety. My husband didn't even try the sides because he didn't have time. \n\nI wouldn't advise people not to go, but if you do just plan to make it a 3 hour event."

            "review": "This review is longgg overdue! Visited Prime Steakhouse on Valentine's Day. My boyfriend made reservations a month in advance to celebrate both the holiday and our two year anniversary. I couldn't have asked for a more romantic and beautiful setting to celebrate these special occasions! Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio was truly a wonderful experience.\n\nFirst off, the ambiance. Breathtaking. The inside of the restaurant is dim and decorated beautifully. Glass windows gives you and incredible view of the fountains and of the rest of the city lights. Dress code is formal, so ladies, make sure to put on a nice dress and your sexiest heels, and men, a dressy shirt and tie is suggested. Seating indoors seemed great, but my boyfriend had reserved a table for us outside on the balcony/patio. Wow! That's all I gotta say. You are sitting right by the water, where the Bellagio fountain show takes place every 15 minutes. This was truly and amazing and breathtaking view! Your table is under heat lamps so being cold is not an issue, and it's also decorated w a candles to set the mood. Very romantic! Would definitely recommend trying to reserve this section. Holds about 5-6 tables.\n\nNow to the food, delicious! We started off by ordering the shrimp cocktail, served over a bed of ice with wasabi and its cocktail sauce. So good! The shrimp is cold and fresh and definitely very tasty. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon and loved it! He said it was cooked just right and the sauces it comes with adds the perfect touch to it. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, comes with white asparagus and lemon basil butter. It was good, but very big! Such a huge dish! I couldn't finish it and left a little more than half in my plate. Very filling because of its size. Order if you're hungry or maybe share it with someone. Huge! \n\nWe also ordered the truffle mashed potatoes to share. Mouthwatering. The mashed potatoes literally melt in your mouth and the truffle oil tasted so good! A definite side you must order! \n\nAs for drinks, we each had a cocktail, which I believe was called the Jasmine. So good. Very light and refreshing, great for a lightweight like me. :) I had 2 glasses! \n\nDessert was a must! We had a chocolate souffl\u00e9 cake that came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Of course we finished it all! Amazing!\n\nI really loved this place! If you are looking for a classy, romantic night out, Prime is the place to be! We even saw a guy propose to his girlfriend during the fountain show! So beautiful! \n\nReservations are very easy by either calling the restaurant or booking online through Opentable. Hope you enjoy the restaurant as much as my boyfriend and I did!"

Tuna Ribbons and Steak Tartare - amazing. My filet mignon was cooked nicely (medium rare) and I love all the sauces they bring for you. Sides are ordered separately, and our waiter did lead us astray saying they were individually portioned. Uhmm NO. 2-3 people can easily split them, especially the mashed potatoes, which are more like liquid gold. Also worth trying: the wild mushrooms."

And, as many note, you can see the fountains well from some tables.\n\nOn to the food:\n\nWe had the seafood tower.  Usually, the lobster is the star, but in this one, it was the crab for me.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked.  \n\nCrabcakes was probably the most disappointing dish.  Serviceable, but not what I expected.\n\nHad several sides.  The stars were mac n cheese and onion rings.  Will defintely get these 2 dishes again.  My wife had the filet and lobster.  Filet cooked PERFECTLY rare.  This was textbook, and no black on the outside, which was a feat for such a thick steak.  The lobster was one of the best I have had.  I had the bone-in ribeye, which was another perfect medium rare.  Excellent flavor, the dry aging came through.\n\nThe wine list is extensive, and pricey.  We had Italian at our table and all choices were excellent.  Port for dessert was actually not as bad price wise.  But, expect to pay if you are a wine drinker, as is common on the Strip.\n\nOverall, a very expensive evening but one that we will do again.  If you are a steak fan, highly recommended.\n\nI will say, the bathrooms were underwhelming for such a nice place."

Single guys should bring a date here. \n\nI however, was on a business dinner that turned not too friendly, but that did not detract from the food.

Nobody intruded when I was taking to task a supplier, and when things lightened up they came around doing what wait staff do. \n\nAtmosphere outstanding.

I made reservations as a Yelp friend had recommended well in advance of the date I wanted.  I had a ticket to see 'O' at 7:30 and this was one of the Bellagio restaurants that I never went to and also one that opens at 5 giving me plenty of time to enjoy dinner and not worry about making the show on time.\n\nI was seated promptly after a few parties ahead of me.  I was taken to a side room in the front--not one of the coveted center tables directly overlooking the fountains--but it was a really nice room and I could see much of the fountain show in any case.  My servers were Team #18.  I'm not sure if the waiter gave me his name or not.  If he did, I missed it.  He asked about drinks, gave me the menu, and explained some of the things on the menu.  I was also brought a nice selection of bread and some butter.  The bread had been warmed nicely.\n\nI started with the tomato gazpacho.  The bowl had several groupings of avocado, celery, some peanuts and other goodies.  Onto this vegetable grouping, the server poured the cold gazpacho.  He then ground some fresh pepper on the soup and I was off enjoying the first course.\n\nFor the main course, I got the 14 ounce filet with bone in cooked barely--blue.  It was accompanied by two shishito peppers.  I also got a side of gratin dauphinois with Comt\u00e9, a gussied up name for potatoes au gratin.  When I saw Comt\u00e9, I knew this was it.  It's the kind of cheese I always buy for eating at home.  The steak was done exactly the way I like.  The potatoes were excellent.  A very pleasant side dish that I almost finished.  With the steak, the waiter brought a platter with three sauces, peppercorn, a classic B\u00e9arnaise, and their house soy, rice wine sauce.  Of the three, I liked the soy, rice wine the best but I used it sparingly.  I'm generally a purist when it comes to steak.  It really doesn't need a sauce.\n\nFor dessert, I got the coconut souffl\u00e9 with chocolate sorbet.  The plating was beautiful.  The souffl\u00e9 was perfect and the round of sorbet on a small bed of toasted coconut was a perfect accompaniment.  \n\nNow as to service--it couldn't have been better.  It was top notch.  The server was a friendly gentleman and the bus person was quite efficient.  I had a fresh glass of iced tea before I finished the first one.  The plates were cleared promptly and when my server said the souffl\u00e9 would only take 7 minutes, he was correct.\n\nThe maitre d'h\u00f4tel came around twice during the meal to check how things were and we chatted for a bit.  It was a grand meal and I'll be returning.  This would be a great anniversary dinner.  I think I'll make the reservation soon!"

            "review": "Lauren C's review of Prime described her waiter as a \"Jeeves Wannabe,\" and she couldn't have been more correct.  And when I told the Sommelier I was taking the Level 2 exam after passing Level 1, but that I wasn't a \"real\" sommelier at the time, he practically scoffed.  The correct response is: \"Good luck!\"  I told the same thing to the Sommelier at Gary Danko last week, and he gave me his business card and asked how he could help.  THAT is how you treat a customer!\n\nBeing a top-service-rated restaurant, even if it's super-high-end, means having servers that are professional, and knowledgable, but also cool and who act like \"real people\" at the same time  Example:  Go to Gary Danko.  It's a high end establishment, but people are just cool.  No snootiness, and they have a natural flow to how they interact, with a sense of humor as well.  Perhaps I was at Prime on an off-night, but other reviews have confirmed the same attitude.\n\nTo Bellagio's credit, however, I must say that my experience at Picasso two years ago was unbelievable, and the service at Picasso blew me away.  Furthermore, the wine pairing at Picasso was one of the best I've encountered in my life.\n\nMy Prime experience was overall a good one, saved by the bartender (I had a glass of wine at the bar before dinner, he picked one blind and I guessed it), and the unbelievable bone-in filet.  There was a little too much \"rub\" on the filet, as I'm a pureist with my steaks (like to have several bare bites before I go to sauces).  That said, I did try the four homemade sauces, which are pretty incredible:  bernaise, soy reduction, a mustard sauce, and peppercorn.  The bone-in filet is ginormous, and is an amazing cut of meat.  At $60, it's probably the best bargain on the menu, because a cut of that quality and size is very rare.\n\nWine list is great, although they only have one Rioja; which shouldn't be the case with a list of that size."

We didn't get any wine, but had a couple of cocktails (cosmos) that were literally the best I've ever had (think of that perfect shaved layer of ice on top). \nWent here for Thanksgiving dinner - my brother had the turkey dinner complete with stuffing and sweet mashed potatoes. I didn't try his because mine was so good I didn't want to waste any bite of fullness on someone else's food. The older heavier watier was looking more and more attractive as I ate my beef. I actually thought as I was eating that if someone cooked for me like this on a regular basis I would do anything for them including marrying them! HOLY GOD this is GOOD FOOD!!!!!!!!! \n\nI had the beef from Australia - the fillet. And the sauces that went with it were out of this world! (Peppercorn, and 2 others that were creamy). \nFor the appetizer, we had the chilled seafood platter - lobster, king crab claw, mussels, clams, oysters, shrimp, lump crab meat - all ready to eat! No peeling or cracking involved! It was also amazing! The total bill for the 2 of us was 300. Not bad at all for what we got. I highly recommend this place."

I did, however, let the manager know that I wanted the tip money to go to the busboys because they did our waiters job.  He offered me a complimentary meal, but I declined.

We got there a little earlier then our reservation so we were able to change it to seat outside, front row seat to the water show, and perfect romantic night! We loved the food, and the scenery! The service outside on the patio could use some improvement but overall we were very satisfied!"

            "review": "I was very lucky to eat at prime and have my dad pay the bill. \n\nI've eaten at nice steakhouses before such as Mastro's and BOA, and I've concluded that most top-of-the-line steakhouses are very similar in their menus. Other factors are what can make the difference, such as service and ambiance.\n\nThis place does have spectacular views of the Bellagio Fountains, but inside the design was a bit tacky. I get it, I get it, it's supposed to feel like an opulent steakhouse from many decades ago with chandeliers, columns, big drapes everywhere, and waiters that bring food out on rolling carts. But for me, it was a little stuffy and got pretty old after a while. \n\nMy impression of this place is that it's trying very hard to be a classic fancy steakhouse. But I was just left with chairs that were uneasy to maneuver and a waiter who seemed kind of absent. I've had better waiters at a Chili's while ordering nachos. This guy was only at our table a handful of times, while an army of other people kept our water glasses filled. He didn't check on us nearly enough  throughout our meal and wasn't very personable. \n\n(And they could stand to update their bathroom)\n\nAt Mastro's, you do get amazingly attentive service in a more modern and classy place. Although, just as at Mastro's, you do get an amazing steak at Prime. \n\nAs for the food, my initial impression was of how small the menu was. There are maybe a dozen entrees. There are a large number of side dishes to choose from, though. \n\nI would say that the sauces--particularly the bernaise--make the steak entrees very good. I ordered a filet mignon medium rare. It was cooked nicely, with a juicy and red interior, but the outside of the steak was dry. \n\nThe sides are nothing to write home about, except for the black truffle mashed potatoes. These are whipped clouds of carbohydrate perfection. The earthy black truffle is generously shaved on top and is abundantly stirred throughout. (But let's be honest, you could shave black truffles on anything, even a twinkie, and it'd be delicious.)\n\nEating at prime was a wonderful experience and I do recommend it. But as for its rank among other steakhouses, I would say it falls toward the upper middle. With Mastro's still on top."

The service is fantastic and our professional servers were friendly, attentive, and very helpful with the menu. After a couple of masterfully executed cocktails at the bar our group was seated.\n\nJohn Burke our Sommelier for the evening has an incredible ability to pair wines with everything you are eating weither it be Seafood, Steak, or Salads. He knows just what your palate and especially your soul needs.\n\nI ordered the seafood tower, tomato and mozzarella salad, aged bone in rib eye (medium), and the donut tower. All accompanied by Mr. Burke's selection of several incredible wines. A monumental meal.\n\nOur table of 6 had everything one could desire to eat and drink. The bill, hold your breath. \n\n$2,880 with tip. Worth every hard earned penny."

I enjoyed a Delmonico steak that was as good as I have had anywhere, melt in your mouth excellent, someone else had the duck which I sampled and it was also done perfectly. Those that had room for dessert were also pleased. \nIt was an excellent meal, the service was the only reason I did not give a 5 star. Our waiter was a little overwhelmed with all of his tables. The food came out at a perfect temperature, but was a little slow between courses. We also had to wait a while to order. The table he was taking care of before us had 8 people and it seemed that each person needed to discuss their order in detail with multiple questions, most were answered to the previous person at the table, IE: what salad dressings , how much pink does med well have , can I super size my fries..... really, it must have taken 15 minutes for them to order, the waiter was exhausted afterwards and we were starving. .. For a restaurant of this caliber, the wait manager should have stepped in and taken our order, it was obvious we were starving and he was dying at the next table."

News flash: people that order salmon are usually health conscious individuals that are trying to make a lean and healthy choice, not usually want a stick of butter dropped on in prep. I will say that I ordered the hot chocolate/lava cake with vanilla ice cream and it was amazing! However the coffee that I ordered to go with it was absolutely awful.

The dining room is stunning, intimate, and inviting and has gorgeous views of the Bellagio fountains. The service was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. We completely splurged, and went from classic caviar service to appetizers, entrees, and deserts. The steaks were cooked perfectly, dry aged and juicy, with a nice selection of sauces... though they didn't need them. I was told the lobster was as succulent as could be, but I am allergic and could not try it for myself. The shrimp cocktail, however, was excellent so I believe the comments on the lobster. The side dishes - the element that ultimately defines the overall success of a steakhouse for me - were perfect. The onion rings were battered, seasoned, and crisped to perfection. The mac & cheese was ooey gooey. The creamed spinach was fresh and not too creamy. The warm chocolate cake was heavenly.\n\nThis is easily one of the best steakhouses in Vegas, and the fountain view might just push it to the top if that's your sort of thing."

One of our party is vegan and the fact that a steakhouse had a special vegan/vegetarian menu available was really awesome. The others in our party enjoyed the sea bass, short ribs and bone in rib eye. All the dishes were fantastic. Mushrooms as a side dish were terrific. As we enjoyed our slow paced meal, we also enjoyed the wonderful Bellagio fountains and music every 15 minutes- a highlight of the dinner for me! We were never rushed so they could turn our table and we sat there for dinner and dessert until 10pm. Dessert was a cinnamon bread pudding presented inside a chocolate sphere over which a warm caramel sauce is poured, melting the chocolate. It was amazing. This is a place for a special meal!"

If you look past the high class attitude of the staff you see true elegance and fine dining.\n\nOur experience started off with a long wait due to a mix up with the reservation, good opportunity people watch and checkout the fountains.  They later made up for the botched reservations, but still annoying.  Very crowded for fall weekend night and the sure sign they over booked was the sight of the staff rolling out tables to setup mid evening.\n\nSteaks are surely prime cut and the kitchen really knows their stuff.  Head waiter was a bit stuffy and kept disappearing on us.  Wife has the Rib Eye, nice and tender, cooked perfectly - rare warm center.  I went off in left field and ordered the Duck - must have been the cocktails that threw me off course (nice stiff drinks $$$).  Was expecting something different but after mulling it over a few days, came to the conclusion that it was a spectacular dish.  Hearty breast fillet that cut like a steak, cooked perfectly.  The almond crust was like candy and the red wine amaretto reduction was paired perfectly.\n\nFor the sides, the table shared the Truffle Mashed potatoes, Mac and Cheese, Roasted Mushrooms, Roasted Broccoli, and Crunchy Potatoes.  Mac and cheese seemed to be everyone's fav but it had too much depth (if there is such a thing) for me, if you like sharp cheese this one is for you.  The crunchy potatoes has a great name but in the end was just a deep fried baked potato.  The truffle mashed was nice and creamy.  The roasted vegetables were surprisingly good, the broccoli has some heat with the jalepenos.\n\nAll in all a good experience, will definitely order steak next time!"

Except the people taking selfies and photos of the fountains right next to our table during entire meal. Maybe they could discourage this somehow, it really takes away from the moment.\n\nFull review:\n\nI went to prime for my birthday. It was also my first time visiting Las Vegas. I had an amazing meal on the patio overlooking the fountains. I definitely recommend sitting outside if the weather is nice (two other parties in front of us at the hostess station were denied patio seating, so make sure to mention it when you make your reservation if you want to sit there!). \n\nThe service was incredible. There were several waiters in our area, all were extremely attentive, but unobtrusive.\n\nMy date and I both ordered the Dry-aged Bone-in Rib Eye. It was hands down the best steak I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection. I savored every succulent bite. It was served with 3 different steak sauces. I tasted each one, they were alright, but I don't know why anyone would want to mask the flavor of that meat! Unfortunately, the steak does not come with any sides, they must be ordered separate. \n\nThe wine list is the size of a small novel. I finally decided on a bottle of Chianti, it was superb. Every time I neared the end of my glass a waiter would appear to refresh it. \n\nAfter the main course they brought me a complimentary dessert with a candle and \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate on the dish (I had mentioned it was my birthday on the reservation that I made far in advance). It was a nice gesture. \n\nBe aware, this place is on the expensive side. 2 steaks, 1 bottle of wine, 2 sides, and the tip came to about $400, but it was worth every penny! I left very happy and would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice dinner."

The man said he would try but he couldn't promise anything, so I wasn't expecting anything. But they had our window table for two all ready when we showed up!\n\nIf you are looking for a fantastic steak, amazing service and an impressive wine list, this is it. Everyone from the hostess to the wait staff to the bus boys were attentive and polite and made us feel very welcome. As a couple in their young 20s on a budget, we appreciated how welcoming they were. It was one of the most expensive meals I have ever payed for (and we picked one of the the lesser expensive \"budget\" bottles on the wine list) so we were looking to be pampered. The employees at Prime did not disappoint. The food was even better! I had the Boston lettuce salad, 18oz. bone-in ribeye. She had the caesar salad and the 8oz. filet mignon. We shared the garlic mashed potatoes and chile broccoli. I am not a huge fan of buttery mashed potatoes but this bowl was pretty incredible. For dessert we shared a special anniversary lava cake and vanilla ice cream. They spelled out \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate in chocolate syrup, and it was on the house!\n\nI wish I could remember the name of our waiter. I want to say it started with a J (Joseph, maybe?). Anyway, he's probably mid-40s, and I do remember that his nametag says he's from Costa Mesa, CA.

My friend, who was traveling with me, arrived without his bag. They said it would be around 10 that night before he got it. The big problem - my friend only had shorts. The restaurant had a \"no shorts\" policy. I called the reservation line and asked if they would make an exception - NO. I went directly to the restaurant and asked if they would make an exception - NO. I understand policies. I have them in my business. My deal on policies is that, if circumstances dictate, I make exceptions. This is not the theory for Prime Steakhouse. At least for us, it wasn't. \n\nI saw many of the patrons of Prime later that night. I have to say I couldn't effectively gauge the dress code. There were hookers with body parts spilling out of all parts of their dresses (that's using the term \"dress\" liberally). There were men in ripped jeans (which they said they had a policy against) but I guess when you pay $400 for ripped jeans, it doesn't count.

Never again.\n\nThe people are super nice and the service is exemplary. Decor is top notch. But I don't go to a steakhouse for service and decor. I go there for steak. Please go ahead and mistreat me but if you're going to charge me $85 for a ribeye it better be the best darn ribeye I've ever had. It needs to be at the level of J&G in Phoenix or Prime 112 in Miami for these kinds of prices. Probably even at the level of Peter Lugers (sp?) in NYC. Well it's not even close. Though I'll leave out good ol' Ruth's Chris since it's pretty hard to beat a steak that's drenched in sizzling butter. Both of the last two times I was at Prime, the ribeye was meh - gristle-y and a little on the chewy side. Totally not what I would expect from a $60-70 aged, prime ribeye. Had a piece of my neighbor's filet and it was a little better. Still rather flavorless to be honest. The sides are microscopic - they have no shame charging $14 for amounts to 4-5 Brussel sprouts. Definitely NOT sharable among 2-3 people as they say their sides are.\n\nGiven their level of service and the decor, it would just be wrong to give them a 1-star. But the food quality really just isn't there and I definitely will not go back.\n\nGoes to show that Pavlovian principles only apply to dogs. But no really, next CES, I am not subjecting anyone to Prime."

So maybe they are not aging their steaks in the sun? Letting them spoil a little to get more of a flavor? We went to Las Vegas for my 30th birthday and I was reading reviews of this place and I thought why not try it. I have heard both positive and negative and being in the Bellagio hotel you would think that it would be great! I had the filet, garlic potatoes and mushrooms that we both shared. And my husband had some other cut. (cant remember exactly what) But obvioulsy it wasnt too good considering that early Saturday morning he was in the bathroom and it was not pretty! Basically our entire trip was ruined from this so called wonderful steakhouse. NEVER again will I come back to this place. It obviously was food poistening. So thank you Prime Steakhouse for ruining my 30th birthday weekend. You did a great job of it."

In hindsight I wish I would have saved this room for dessert. \n\nMy filet was prepared perfectly and served with three sauces - this may just be the best steak I have ever eaten, and was only made more perfect by the sides we had.

First of all, the staff person who showed us to our table pulled the chair out for my husband and not me - while HILARIOUS, was a tip-off that the place is \"off.\"  Our waiter was obnoxious - condescending and LOUD voice.  We had a reservation at 6 and tickets for a show at 8 - he seemed uncertain that we would be done on time, which was ridiculous as we were completely rushed through dinner.  He treated us like rubes who just fell off the turnip truck, \"Heard you heard of Alaskan king crab legs?\"  Really.  \"Uhhh, how do you say that word, 'craaa-bbbb?'\"   D'oh - annoying.  We started with a salad, which was fine, very small portion size.  I had a filet - okay, but didn't change my world.  My husband had the lamb.  Fatty.  We split some brussel sprouts and potatoes - again, really unremarkable.  Rushed service and the very loud waiter made it a not-so-fun experience.  $230.00 later, we should've skipped it. \nWe are foodies.  Prime is not for foodies.\nOn the plus side, elegant decor and nice views of the Bellagio fountains."

I started my dinner off both nights with the Burrata and tomatoes which was absolutely delicious.  The porterhouse melted in your mouth.  The second night wasn't as good as the first night but was still a very good.  Our salads came out so quickly that we hardly had time to enjoy the bread basket, which by the way has some really good pretzel bread and a delicious raisin bread too.   I guess it was a slow night and the kitchen wasn't busy.  I'm not complaining since the food is so good here.   The waiters and bus boys are very efficient.

However, I knew I would have limited options and knew what I would order prior to arriving at the restaurant. That being said, my limited amount of options is NOT the reason for my low rating. \n\nI went with a few girls for Valentine's Day, for fun and for a nice fancy dinner before a girls night out. We were seated and it took about five minutes before we were greeted by our server (at least who we thought was our server). He disappeared for a bit and then came back to ask what we would like to drink. I fully understand that it was a busy night, but I know that restaurant is busy in general, and can handle busy nights. After our drink orders were taking, we waited about ten minutes before receiving them, and another ten minutes until a completely different server took our orders. I understand its odd that I venture to steakhouses and don't order meat, but I don't make a fuss over what I eat; so I really didn't understand why the server had to give me a disapproving look when I didn't order a meat item. I wish I was exaggerating with the amount of time between when we would see our server (if at all) but I'm not. Our reservation was at 9:30pm and we left the restaurant close to midnight. Considering that this restaurant has earned a Triple A 4-diamond rating, I assume it solely due to the steaks, chops, and seafood options. \n\nOn a happy note, I loved the truffle mashed potatoes!

Watching JG & his wife on the show is the reason we had interest in Prime & decided to come and celebrate our V-day weekend dinner out at the Bellagio.  We booked a table through Open Table & requested a table near the windows so we could see the fountain show in the front of the hotel.  You can't hear the music, but you can hear the roar of the water.  We were seated in this smaller dining area, tucked away near the entrance, next to the water & fountains.  It just so happened that night, Carlos Santana was there with 4 other people sitting right behind us.  \"Happy Birthday\" never sounded so good.\n\nAs for the food, we started with the salmon & oyster tartar with black bread.  SO GOOD.  The olive oil and light oyster flavors were really good & paired well with the sashimi grade salmon.  We then ordered a salad (fairly large mixed greens salad) & soup (french onion), both good, but could have probably been happier trying another appetizer on the menu instead.  For our main course, we split the Porterhouse, roasted brussel sprouts and crispy potatoes.  My boyfriend likes his steaks cooked medium, bone to edges, the steak was perfect.  One of the dining staff members or \"team 18\" cut our steak for us portioning out half and half onto separate plates for us.  The brussel sprouts were were paired with pork & quince, sweet & savory.  Crispy potatoes, think of a really good potato skin with creme fraiche.  Although we were both stuffed, we couldn't skip out on dessert.  We split the cracking key lime pie.  What made it crackling was that they put in pop rocks into the filling.  Definitely a nice pleasant textural element.  The key lime was very tart and paired well with the whipped cream topping. \n\nAlong with our meal, we shared a bottle of Tobin James Zinfandel Reserve.  Their wine list is a huge directory of wines, local and international.  I want to say that the year they brought out for us was different than what was listed in the menu, but I still love that winery so it was an easy no-brainer.  The wine was listed at $65, one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest wine in the directory, but i still love that winery!\n\nPat on the back JG.. too bad you only go there 3 times a year to check up on the menu."

Great ambiance and very hefty price tag. Magnificently appointed from the small 8 seat bar when you first walk in to the large tables placed not to closely with views of the fountains through the large picture windows its pure Vegas.   Table for 9 on this Saturday night and we are given a large round table where we are seated very comfortably.   Fresh baskets of bread, pretzel bread, are a nice start as we peruse this shall we say ok no way around it Ridiculously overpriced menu. There I said it. \n\nThe wine list is long as it is equally if not one of the most expensive wine lists I've ever seen.  In fact most were 300% mark up.  There was an exceptional vintage a 2008 Justin Isosceles which for $131.00 was simply marked up 110% which made it the best value on the entire list.   Note 5 bottles were consumed tonight.  The menu itself is your typical steaks & chops menu with some fish thrown in.   Don't think I'll be able to get to each appetizer and entree but I'll try. \n\nAppetizer Highlights:  \nShrimp Cocktail exceptional, Cesar Salad authentic and outstanding. Special tonight Burrata cheese over watercress was really unbelievably good, A dungeous crab cake also as good it gets.  Knocks off for poor Seared Foie Gras. \n\nEntrees: \nNY Strip Dry aged incredibly tasty and cooked  to perfection but the typical dry aging left it no juice whatsoever.  (8) out of 10\n\n (2) Small Bone in Rib Eye with Shishito peppers was tasty with just enough marble to give it some excellent secondary flavor (10)\n\nRack of Colorado Lamb was simply killer, not gamey and rich in color texture and taste. (10)\n\nProsciutto wrapped pork chop was dry and lacked flavor (5) Nice looking but didn't get it done.\n\nPan Roasted Dover Sole was fresh and tasty but completely overpriced at $65.00 (7)\n\nVeal Chop was grilled and tasty and hanging off the bone as it should be.  Very rich flavor (10)\n\nFilet Mignon with Shishito peppers everything a filet should be and then some (even for my friend who tried to ruin it by ordering it medium well :(   (10)\n\nSides: \nMashed Yukon Gold Potatoes (6) Nothing special\n\nBaked Potatoes large giant with all the fixings (10)\n\nMac & Cheese crusty topping and rich and creamy underneath (10)\n\nCreamed Spinach lacking that extra kick (6)\n\nGlazed Mushrooms again nothing special bland (6)\n\nNo Deserts were tried.  Service was exceptional throughout the meal from every direction.  \n\nBottom line is was the price tag worth it?  Really borderline as almost every entree except the Sole was top shelf, and the appetizers were great. Ambiance, service exceptional as well.  Negatives All but 1 of hundreds of wines were so overpriced we were lucky to find a bottle to order.  Sides and prices of entrees were completely outrageous.  Kind of a 4 star if you have unlimited spending in your budget as it certainly was not a 100% slam dunk perfection and 1 star off for price points and wine list.  3.5 stars is more like it but we have to be fair."

However my boyfriend and I left disappointed. \n\nI had made reservations over a MONTH in advance asking for a seat with a view of the Bellagio fountain show. I informed them that this was our first time to the Bellagio and we wanted to make it special. I was told that there were no guarantees but my request will be placed. \n\nWe arrived promptly to be seated only to be told that the wait time for a window seat was 1 hour and 1/2 to two hours. Needless to say I was disappointed, especially after making reservations so far in advance. \n\nWe were then seated at a larger table and then waited to be serviced. One of the servers handed us a wine menu (this menu is about 35 pages!). I drink wine but I am not a wine connoisseur (and either is my bf) and didn't know what wine would go with what. While I poured over the wine menu, seemingly overwhelmed our main waiter showed up; and boy was he something. He had this total, I-hate-my-job-this-is-my-last-shift type of attitude (you all know what I'm talking about). He didn't introduce himself he just asked if we wanted wine. I felt like we were being pushed to purchase a glass (or two) of wine and I said no, I'll go with another drink for right now. He didn't seem to like that and left the wine menu just in case we changed our minds. \n\nWe both ordered the 8oz filet mignon, truffle mashed potatoes and mushrooms, and for an appetizer the bacon wrapped shrimp and that's when the server asked us AGAIN if we were going to get some wine. Look, I know that restaurants make the bulk of their revenue off of alcohol; I understand that, however my boyfriend and I did not appreciate being \"prodded\" to buy wine. What was more shocking to me (especially in such an upscale place) was that he never suggested a wine pairing to go with the meal we were having.\n\nI also noticed that two of the servers were having a argument right near me. I couldn't help overhearing their snickering and was surprised that they would be having it out near customers. \n\nI will say that the filet mignon and truffle mashed potatoes were amazing (if you go you must try the truffle potatoes!!). So I will give them three stars. But the service overshadowed the food. I feel that if we are going to pay around 200 bucks for food then we should be treated accordingly.\n\nSadly, I'm not sure if we would go there again. If you do decide to go I hope that your experience was better than ours."

            "review": "One of the best steaks I've ever had! The richest, beefiest, most delicious Ribeye imaginable! \n\nBeautiful location in the fabulous Bellagio. We lucked out and got a killer table that had a view of the fountains. Make a reservation and request the view! Everyone there was dressed to kill! Dark restaurant, plush furnishing, fancy! Fabulous! \n\nService was A-ok. Knowledgable and friendly enough. \n\nBread basket was below par. Save calories here. \n\nMartini was disappointing. So very unfortunate. \nI took a chance and ordered the black and blue. A vodka martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and a sprig of rosemary. The blue cheese stuffed olives were hanging out at the bottom of the beautiful martini glass. No skewers? How am I supposed to eat the olives? Wait till the end? I hated it. I requested a side of olive juice and made it a filthy martini. Still hated it. 2nd martini- \"a dirty martini please\". The olive juice came on the side and olives again were sadly hanging out at the bottom. So, I have to mix my own dirty? Hated it. Skip the handcrafted cocktails and play it safe with wine or champagne. \n\nBacon wrapped shrimp- heavenly. Wedge salad- meh- I've had better. Potato Dauphinoise- to die for. Brussel sprouts with pear- amazing!  The best part of the meal?  The 18oz bone in Rib Eye. Holy hell. Delicious. Cooked perfectly medium rare. So flavorful. Tender! Marbled to perfection.\n\nLooking to splurge on an elegant steak dinner? I highly recommend this place. Skip the handcrafted cocktails. Share an appetizer and salad and be prepared for a premium steak dinner!"

Unfortunately that's where the amazingness stops :/ had the braised ribs and scallops and they were, MEH. Forgettable,  not that great. I can't complain about the service,  staff was awesome!  But what took away from the experience was that tacky photographer pushing us to buy photos while my friend and I tried finishing our meals.  She stopped TWICE and kept interrupting our meal. Totally took away from the 5 star,  upscale experience. I kinda felt I was in a wedding and not at a wonderful restaurant prime is. Definitely not returning"

We started off in the bar and were served by 2 awesome guys...Doug and (not sure other guy's name). Turns out all the bartenders have been here since it opened 13 years ago, so you know they like their jobs and they are happy to chat with you. \n\n2 dirty martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives please! OMG...do NOT miss these olive. 2 more please!\n\nWe had requested a special seat for my birthday so we could see the fountains, and even though we had to wait a little bit (2 more please!) it was SO worth it. Best seat in the house!\n\nMiguel was our server and he was so nice and knowledgeable....I loved how he took time to speak with each table and we did not feel rushed or pressured. Here's what we had:\n\nSteak Tartare - a very delicate portion of raw beef with some sort of spicy mayo...very good. I think it was a bit light for 2 people to share though. \n\nFrench Onion Soup - (BF's starter) Oh wow...super chunky, hot, cheesy deliciousness...this could be a stand-alone meal and in hindsight, it probably was too heavy to have before the steak. \n\nCeasar Salad - (my starter) Honestly jut ok. Nothing special to the dressing. \n\nFilet - (BF's steak) Cooked a perfect medium rare with just the right amount of searing. So soft you could cut it with a spoon. \n\nBone-in Filet - (my steak). There's nothing I love more than a bone-in filet. Imagine the juciest, tenderest, mouth-wateringest piece of meat, and then throw extra flavor on top of that from the bone. This was a special that night, and Miguel had to go ask Chef to find me one because they were sold out by the time I ordered. If this is on the menu when you go, do NOT pass it up. Amazing, I'm still slobbering over it. \n\nThe only \"ding\" I will give them is that you can't bring in your own wine. We brought a special bottle all the way from CA for my b-day, and they would not let us cork it. I get it, they need to make money, but it seems like they could have bent the rules just this once. \n\nOverall, a fantastic meal. I've been asked if I think it's the best steakhouse in Vegas (that I've been to) and I think it edges out Craftsteak by a margin. \n\nSave your money and try this place!"

The service was excellent. The wine is very overpriced but it is a great selection. The experience was great, but when I asked to go to an almost empty patio to order dessert and coffee, the server brushed us off and said they don't do that anymore. So I need to get on my iPad and re-reserve just to do dessert at an empty patio? Should rethink that a little for slower nights and customers I think. Overall really good experience for us!"

            "review": "My friend and I had dinner here on Halloween night, 10/31/14.  We arrived without reservations!  Of course they are recommended, but we had chosen another venue and changed our minds at the last minute.  The hostess was very nice and accommodating and asked us to wait in the bar for approximately 15 minutes while a table was being readied.  That was great with us.  At the bar we enjoyed a mixed drink each.  Drinks here are about $15 pp.  We were promptly seated near the windows and had a cozy table for two.  The view onto the Strip and the Fountains of Bellagio are fantastic.  Prime is definitely an upscale venue.  We had one primary waiter and two others who assisted.  The menu is a la carte and comprehensive.  I selected the Squash Soup ($15) and it is poured into your bowl at the table.  She selected the baby Iceberg Salad ($18).  There is nothing baby about the salad; it's huge.  You will be full after eating it.  We shared and both were delicious.  For the main course we ordered the 18 oz Ribeye ($64) - just one - and I asked the waiter to split it at the table.  It was more than enough for two.  We also had the roasted Asparagus ($14), the Mushrooms (($16) and Mac and Cheese ($12).  That was too much and I told the waiter it probably was.  All of it was delicious!  The total, without tip, was $164, and that included one more mixed drink for me.\n\nActually, I thought the venue, service and experience overall was excellent, responsive and courteous.  The prime Ribeye was good, but not the best I've had.  I would rate it 3.5 stars, although it was cooked properly, by the time it was served, it was a bit cool.  I like a steak hot.  This was not.  I did not complain -- it was fine, just not hot.  By the time I had eaten the last morsel, it was definitely cold.  If you like rare, this is perfect for you.  \n\nI agree with the other reviewers that this is a beautiful restaurant overlooking the fountains.  During the weekend, the fountains are active every 15 minutes, so this is quite a show while you dine.  Very romantic."

For our appetizer we had the Ribbons of Tuna. OH MY GOD it was amazing. \n\nFor the main course, we had the filet mignon with sides of spinach and truffle mashed potatoes. The filet came with the following sauces: peppercorn, soy-rice wine and bearnaise, all of which were carefully explained to us. \n\nFantastic wine selection. I did not tell the waiter I was there for my birthday until the signed credit card receipt was returned. He immediately said \"please...DO NOT LEAVE YET\" and within a few short minutes I received a complimentary chocolate cake that was delicious. Extremely professional wait staff, great teamwork. \n\nMinor note: there is a photographer walking around taking photos. She was kind of cold and somewhat rude when we said we did not want out picture taken. However, we did understand that was her job. Also, it was kind of awkward but also VERY entertaining to hear all the coaching she gave the people at the next table: \"Give that pretty lady a kiss!\" FLASH \"You are one lucky guy!\" FLASH"

In terms of entrees the porterhouse was good but not mindblowing. Same goes for the sauces. The sauce made from grapes was good but the others were pretty standard. At the suggestion of the waiter we ordered the crispy potatoes as a side. They were literally exactly the same as TGIFridays potato skins, but maybe a little greasier.  \n\nService - This was mixed. Our waiter was very nice but the host/busboy/captain (?) kind of huddled and made my friends and I a little uncomfortable.\n\nAtmosphere - The person selling photographs is tacky. The view is top notch but the other decor feels a little tired. This also definitely isn't a young or happening crowd (which I probably should have figured).\n\nIt's vegas, go somewhere better."

Every 15 minutes or so, you'll get a glimpse of the show and really creates a relaxing, decadent ambiance.  The table service / waiters, for the most part, are professional and up to par in fine dining service.  \n\nI've had some outstanding meals here...the best ones included the Seafood Tower which included fresh oysters, gargantuan crab legs, huge prawns/shrimp, and lobster claws - all accompanied with all the dipping sauces.   As for the meal, I go for the New York strip as is my favorite cut, and sides of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes are never-miss choices.  I just love the whole experience from soup to nuts.   A great one to put on your bucket list if you're looking for a high-end steak house while in Vegas."

The server offered to exchanged them but we were running to a show and the service had already taken quite a while. For a $62 filtet - you would be better served at N9NE or the Capital Grille. Also, for some reason I find it insanely cheesy when they have the photographers running around from table to table taking professional photos and asking for $30 each. You just ruined my steak and want to charge me $30 for ONE single photograph? \n\nTip - ignore their dress code of \"jackets preferred for men.\" This must be a joke. The place was packed when we got there and not one guy was wearing a jacket. We did see one guy in a wife beater, another in sweat pants, and another in shorts (supposedly not allowed)."

My water was never refilled the entire night! We were going to order dessert but it took them 30 min to come take our order so we just asked for the check.

Soft-spoken, not pushy or intrusive yet he was helpful and informative, as well as super nice, Rob was a seasoned veteran in the service industry and we benefited.  All of the additional staff assisting, bringing out wine, entrees and filling our glasses etc., were wonderful as well.\n\nTo start, I ordered the Market Tomatoes and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the Baby Iceberg lettuce salad.

Probably one of my top, favorite restaurants of all time.\n\n-ATMOSPHERE: An exquisite experience with wonderful and attentive staff. One feels like a whimsical princess or royalty as the staff all make room for individuals to pass through the restaurant with ease. Their recommendations and service is fitting for this restaurant. I loved the beautiful, classy decor and low light setting.\n\n\n-SEAFOOD: Large platter of various crab legs and oysters. Delicious, fresh and as good as it gets!\n\n\n-STEAK: At some steak houses, people will fight with me to ensure I order the medium well rather than well done. (I do not understand this. I absolutely hate any pink in my meat and will feel sick looking at pink so how can you know what my taste buds will enjoy?)\n\nAs snooty as this sounds, I can tell how fine the dining experience will by the response I get when ordering a well-done filet mignon. Here: no funny looks or push back on my request. (The same response for my friend's extra well-done rib-eye)\n\nI am happy to share that a well-done filet mignon is still very tender and absolutely delicious here. No chewy, jerky style meat. They know how to cook their steaks!\n\nAll meat entrees came with an assortment of fine sauces: Soy-Rice Wine (Favorite), B\u00e9arnaise, Peppercorn, Miso-Mustard\n\n\n-SIDES: Creamed Spinach (I'm still drooling over the though of this, HIGHLY RECOMMEND), Truffle Mashed Potatoes (Probably the best truffle mashed potatoes I've had in my life. HIGHLY RECOMMEND), Mac & Cheese, Glazed Market Mushrooms, French Fries, Roasted Cauliflower"

Sides are pretty big, and I remember ordering a side that resembled baby food, like maybe sweet potatoes, but the baby food version! Wine was delicious as well! They knew it was our 1-yr. anniversary, so they surprised us with a cute lil delicious desert that said \"Happy Anniversary\"! \n\nI love it when restaurants pay attention to detail and deliver. That is how it should always be especially when you are shelling out $$$ for one meal! \n\nP.S. after your meal request to have your dessert or some drinks out on the patio. We did that because we heard you could, but for whatever reason they said there were no seats available at the time even though there were...oh well!"

The bartender seemed like he was having a bad night or maybe he was just a jerk, thank goodness we only waited a few minutes until our hostess advised us that our table was ready. Besides the wonderful steaks that were a bit charred to perfection and juicy pink on the inside, we really enjoyed the famous truffled mashed potatoes. We ordered a salad with enoki mushrooms to start off with and it was large enough to share. They have an extensive wine menu and the dim lighting gives the restaurant more of a romantic feel. I enjoyed my meal very much but may stick with Craftsteak and Cut in the future since they have much better service."

The food was delicious and plentiful. The overall experience was well worth the price and we will be back every time we come to Las Vegas. It's no big secret that Las Vegas is becoming the food capital of the US, and Prime at Bellagio is definitely setting the bar!\nThey even brought us a dessert with a candle and decorated with anniversary wishes on it!

The food is superb, and service is great. The prices are in-line with other high end resturants in Vegas. Now, as for the reason why I did not give it 5 stars: One time, when I made reservations for dinner, the hostess asked me if there was any special occasion that they should be aware of....I said yes, it was my mom's 80th birthday...the hostess then said \"wonderful, I will make a note of it\". When we showed up for dinner they literally gave us the worst table in the resturuant (right near the entrance, with no lake view, and people constantly walking by). There was also no complimentary cake, or anything else, for my mom (not even a \"Happy Birthday\" greeting). Needless to say, I was very disappointed that The Prime did nothing special for her....I am sure it was just an oversight, but I still have to subtract 1 star for that night."

The patio was beautiful, and the view of the fountain show was spectacular. It was a very intimate, date-worthy spot. Our food was delicious, with my bone-in ribeye cooked perfectly, melting in my mouth. The service was a little spotty. My date had to ask a few different people for his soft drink several times. Our server (I cannot remember his name - he was probably in his thirties, Asian-American with glasses) was very rigid and quite inattentive. I could tell he was profiling his tables and spending the majority of his time with the wealthiest looking table in his section. His SA was very pleasant, and very attentive. The food runner did auction off our entrees, which is something that I'm not accustomed to at establishments like this, but was very pleasant. The portion size of the bacon wrapped shrimp was awkward since there were two people enjoying it, but the sauce was to die for, and the shrimp AND bacon were cooked perfectly. I would order this again, just for myself, though. I am eager to return to try more of the seafood and wine selections.\n#ComingFromPeopleInTheIndustry"

My husband and I were referred to Prime to celebrate our anniversary, and we are so glad decided to make a reservation there. The feel is very elegant inside, yet the hostesses and servers are warm and friendly. Especially so for our server- Walter. He was incredibly friendly, chatty, and personable. We felt as if we were eating at his house with how comfortable he made us feel while dining there. \nThe food was as amazing as the service. Hubby had the peppercorn steak and I had the salmon. Both were melt in your mouth goodness. They also brought a few different sauces to go with the entrees, but there was no need for sauce at all. They were delicious already without anything extra. \nThe only thing that we felt kind of ruined the night was the photographer, Morgan. She was friendly, but it seemed forced and fake. When she came to take pics, she made it very posed and studio style right at our table. Beware- the pics are very expensive- something like $50 and up for two poses which she doesn't mention in the beginning. I've been to Morton's for a special occasion and they've taken our pic, but never charged for it. When i politely declined after she brought us the pics, she gave me a dirty look, and cold fake smile then left. It was a shame because this occurred at the end of the meal so despite the amazing experience in the beginning and the middle, the end part is now what's stuck in my head. \nWe will definitely return to Prime next time we're in Vegas. We will ask for Walter and make sure to decline the pics in the beginning.\n\nQuick side note- the area where you can view the Bellagio fountains is under construction until Dec 2015. Unfortunately when I booked the reservation a month before, and confirmed the day before no one ever mentioned about the construction. The view of the fountains was one of the main reasons why I made our reservation!! It was very disappointing when the hostess informed me upon checking in. Fortunately, she put us at a table that still faced Windows looking over a part of the Bellagio lake, and ending up working out anyway since we were taken care of by Walter."

I know being compared to a Peter Lugers, Keens or Del Friscos is a hard hand to be dealt but if you're gonna charge more than those places and then name yourself \"Prime\" then you're challenging someone to wonder. I wouldn't consider this steak equal. Its still great but I'm being critical for the reasons above. \n\nAll that said, I didn't have a horrible experience. I ordered a filet mignon rare. Before you jump on me for being at a steak house and ordering filet just understand that I wasn't hungry. Everyone else ordered the bone-in rib eye med rare or rare and I got to taste it. \n\nMy steak didn't come out rare. It came out medium. The catch is someone else ordered a filet and they got theirs rare but ordered medium. By the time I realized it was too late since my friend started eating his while I was in the bathroom. So the servers messed up. Whatever. \n\nAgain, just want to end with this place isn't horrible. It has an average rating of 4/5 for a reason. Im being critical on purpose. When i go back to Vegas Ill be visiting a different steakhouse though. It wasn't good enough to compete with the best so I have no reason to be loyal to them when there are so many other options I have yet to try there. \n\nTLDR: It is overpriced and not as good as the best NYC steakhouses I have been to. Its still good. The view is great."

My group (4 of us) had made a reso for 8pm, and arrived about 10 minutes early. Once I went to the hostess to confirm, she had told me it would be about 20 minutes (place was not even half full). Now, I don't mind waiting at all. I've been in the restaurant biz all my life, and I know the tricks of the trade. Mainly, when a restaurant is empty and they tell you to wait, it's generally a way to get you over to the side bar to buy a round of drinks. Usually I would take the bait because Kris loves me some drankssss....but this time we decided to pass since we were drinking at the pool all day.\n\nOnce finally seated, the service was outstanding. If there was no food involved, I would give this place 5 stars on the service I recieved. By service, I mean someone who greeted us quickly, explained the menu in detail, provided a wine list, and made sure drinks were filled at any opportunity they could be filled.\n\nNow on to the food. EHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.\n\nI am no food snob. I would rather eat nachos and dirty water hot dogs then have a fancy french dinner. However, I do enjoy a nice outing every now and then, and don't mind spending for it. The sides were very good. It was a few weeks back, but I remember getting a potato side that was outstanding. Also, their side of brocali was perfect.\n\nThe real problem was the steaks. 3 out of 4 of them were just horrendous. I ordered the Ribeye. I order Ribeyes' just about every where I go for steak. Mainly bc of the quantity, and the heaviness to the cut. This was probably the fattiest steak I have ever seen in my 26 years on earth. Where did they cut this from, the cows ass? Seriously, I was perplexed as to which part of the cow this fat came from. I looked around and almost laughed out loud because I thought I might have been on a game show. \n\nI ate up all of the side dishes, and the portions were a good size. I left about 3/4 of the steak with all of the fat cut up on the plate. Now, I would NEVERRRR complain about food at a restaurant, it's just no my style. The way I look at it, I CAME INTO YOUR KITCHEN, and you cooked for me. If I don't like it, shame on me. However, being a bartender I know that if I saw my guest barely touch his 60 or 70 dollar entree, I would ask if something was wrong. The server didn't say a word as he took my plate, which made me want to shove it down his throat. (Just kidding, wanted to add dramatic effect!)\n\nAll in all, very nice place but I am sure there has to be better options for an expensive steak. And if there isn't, Im sticking to sushi and hooters."

Only one person drinks in our party of 5 so what can I do?  Asking for water was also annoying - Sparkling or still?  Still.  Bottled?  No, tap is delicious thank you very much.

I've had equally good at other restaurants.\n\nWe all ordered steaks and the most disappointing was the filet mignon.  It was very tender but it had ZERO beef taste and it was overcooked even when I asked for medium rare.  The best was the Kansas grass-fed rib-eye.  The porterhouse was good but again, not amazing.  I've had better steaks at restaurants that are half the price of this place.  Heck, even the reserve aged steaks at Vons are better than the filet mignon here.\n\nThe dessert selection was boring.  We shared the profiteroles and a cheesecake.  Not impressed.\n\nAlso, one odd thing - the bread they serve is cold.

We were seated, and based on the service, we were so impressed, and resolved to do this more often. However, after we ate our food, we quickly changed our mind! For the price, our meal was DEFINITELY not worth it! I would have rather taken the money spent and put it toward the couch I've been wanting for like a year...there's only a little resentment here ;)\n\nI would give a 5+ on service, but food, really just average, and no where near worth the price."

I really wanted the Wow factor and didn't get it.  The service was excellent.  The view overlooking the fountains was great.  The food was average. My husband tried the aged bone in rib eye. He said it was good but not better than a regular rib eye he has had elsewhere. I had the salmon.  Again, it was good but that's as far as it goes. The side dishes were tasty although it seemed like there was a lot of salt in everything. $250 for 2 meals, 2 sides and 2 cocktails."

            "review": "This was my second time at Prime and I was really looking forward to the same wonderful experience I had the first time a few years back. \n\nTo start with, this was a Monday night at about 9:00pm. My wife and I took our 2 friends there after bragging about our last experience. We did not have reservations but we were easily seated, unfortunately in the very back part of the restaurant as far away from the fountain as can be. The evening began pleasantly enough with our drink order from the bar. My wife ordered a very dirty martini and absolutely loved it. Our friend ordered a Lemon Drop and unfortunately it tasted more like syrup than anything else. She refused to send it back and made the best of it. After placing our complete order we asked the waiters assistant if we could have some bread (like we noticed the other tables were having almost immediately after being seated, not us) and the response was a bit stiff with \"I'll be there as soon as I can.\" We were eventually served some delicious sourdough bread and pretzel bread. The bread was delicious and we made quick work of it. As it was taking a while for our food to be prepared (no complaint here as good food should take some time) we asked the waiters assistant if we could have some more of the pretzel bread. His response this time was \"we are out of pretzel bread because it is so late, that is also why you didn't get any raisin bread.\" Let me state that 9:00pm in Las Vegas is not late. I am also not sure what the point was to tell us what we didn't get. My wife then asked for more sourdough and his response was \"Are you sure? You have a lot of food coming.\" After making it clear that we would still like to have the bread it was brought out without any further comment. We took it with a grain of salt and let it go.\n\nThe rest of the entrees were eventually brought out and the food was fabulous. Paying a premium at a nice restaurant is a treat for most people, like us. We absolutely do not mind doing it but when the experience falls short, then it makes it so not worth it. As much as I enjoy the food at Prime, I feel that this may have been my last visit there. I will happily try one of the many other Steakhouses with excellent Yelp reviews the next time I am in Vegas."

The only thing that was marginally good was the breadbasket. The waitstaff was incompetent and smug. I'm not sure what happened to Vegas and especially the Bellagio but 5 diamonds, really?

Very plush decor and dim lighting makes it a cozy dining experience. They do have a small patio area for outdoor seating as well.\n\nYou can view the menu we had on our visit on 3/1/15 since there are a few price and dish changes: https://butterfly1465.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/prime-steakhouse/\n\nOur Order:\nPotato Gnocchi\nSea Bass\nPorterhouse\nDry Aged Ribeye\nBone in Filet Mignon\nBottle of Red Wine: ($188) 13528 Isoceles - Justin Vineyards & Winery from Paso Robles. 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 11% Cabernet Franc.\nDouble Espresso: ($5.75) Added a twist of orange zest\n\nThe BF ordered the Bone in Filet Mignon. The meat was tender and extremely juicy. It was quite funny because as people were eating, there was a lot of moaning and comments on how good the steaks were made. The two favorite sauces were the Peppercorn and the B\u00e9arnaise sauce (made of clarified butter emulsified in egg yolks and white wine vinegar and flavored with herbs). BF wanted to try the Sea Bass and since I was still full from lunch, I obliged him (even though I didn't think it was a good idea). Unfortunately, I wasn't too fond of the fish, it had flaky chunks of meat but was slightly dry and didn't taste really fresh. I suggest just sticking to the meats here.\n\nService was excellent. I had requested a table close to the windows for the birthday boy and the table definitely gave us a great view of the shows. We were super lucky because it had just stopped raining and the night was clear for us to easily see the show. Our waiter was able to give us great descriptions of the food and provided fantastic recommendations. The chairs were pulled out for everyone and every time someone walked away, their napkins were folded. Drinks were constantly refilled and since there was a waiter always nearby, anything we needed was quickly retrieved.\n\nDinner came out to about $100/person for our group of 7 and was really worth it. With several good restaurant picks for my BF's friend's birthday, I've now been assigned as the restaurant-picker on all future trips! :D"

We had skipped lunch and were hungry early, so this was great.\n\nDress code says jackets are recommended, but I think I only saw one or two men actually wearing one. My husband wore a button down shirt and dress pants and looked fine. I saw men in Polo shirts, so don't worry about not being snazzy enough. It's the sort of place that is fine with business casual, but you wouldn't feel out of place if you got really dressed up.\n\nWe were seated right next to the window with an amazing view of the fountains. We had a main waitress, along with another waiter and a nice young man that served our drinks and cleared our plates. My husband ordered a glass of the house cabernet. Fair warning, it was $26! This is not the place to go if money is tight.\n\nWe skipped appetizers. My husband ordered the surf and turf (large lobster tail and beautiful fillet). It was the \"special\" that evening and came with a $120 price tag. I opted for the salmon which came in closer to the $40 mark. Although my salmon came with (fantastic) truffle mashed potatoes, we also split the gratin dauphinois. Highly recommend. Everything was divine! The sauces that accompanied my husband's steak were delicious and I practically licked my plate clean. \n\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful. Very opulent. Decorated in light blue and chocolate brown. Heavy drapery. Food is brought out on a rolling tray under silver domes. Fancy schmancy. I was a bit surprised that my napkin wasn't swapped out for a black one since I was wearing a black dress. Seemed like the sort of place to do that.\n\nWe ordered the cheesecake, and while nothing out of this world, it was still delicious. The bill came. $320. Whew! This is now our most expensive meal to date. But you know what? You only live once. When in Rome (Vegas), right?"

Prime provided me with a truly divine experience, and not only from a culinary perspective; the service, presentation, and ambiance were second to none.  Magnificently situated on the lagoon in front of the Bellagio, it's subdued and pleasing on the eyes, but provides sweeping views of the fountains every 15 minutes.  I ordered a Porterhouse and an 8oz. lobster tail.  It wasn't cheap by any means, but by golly was it worth it.  The steak was cooked to perfection, and just as I had ordered it (medium rare).  Many steakhouses and restaurants have the tendency to stray on the conservative side, particularly when it comes to raw meat.  Not this time.  The strip and filet were both delicious, flavorful, and tender, and the medley of sauces they provided only added to the experience.  The lobster tail, well, does lobster tail really need any introduction?  Highly recommended if you want to escape the hubbub of some of the more mainstream dining choices in Vegas; it was a taste of culinary serenity nestled in the middle of a zoo."

So I flew to vegas just for the evening to see my parents who were visiting and staying at the Bellagio....which was amazing in itself.  So we didn't have any set in stone dinner plans, but we were looking forward to a great meal.  I had heard prime was good, but my dad was actually the one who suggested it.  So we made reservation for 8:45 cuase my parents were going to see Criss Angel (which they said was so atrocious...) so they left early, and we were all starving so we went down to see if we could get in early, and to our surprise they sat us around 8:30 since they were super busy...It was 15 minutes- but still they did everything they could to help us out.  So we sat and were promptly greeted, and I mean service was wonderful and super friendly.  Our server even told us that they were understaffed that night (wow, they work well together) \n\nSo let me tell you what I was super impressed with (i'm pretty easy to please) but our server came over to open our wine...we ordered the Bethel Heights Pinot Noir, which isn't a baller wine, but a really amazing Pinot.  Anyways- so he came over to present it and as he was about to open it the table next to us very rudely kept telling him to come over while he was in the midst of opening the wine.....so I told him it would be fine if he found out what they wanted....since they were making a big to-do about it....it was actually quite absurd and rude.....and he goes \"No way, I am opening your wine, and you come first....\" now this other table had multiple bottles of very expensive wine/champagne, and were a party of over 10.....the reason I was impressed was becuase the server didn't think about the money he was making with the other table, he made sure to take care of us and give us great service.  I was really happy.\n\nNow the food:  WOW.  I ordered the onion soup to start....I don't think once in my life have I ever been able to finish a full onion soup.....i almost licked the bowl, it was amazing.  My mom and I decided to split the 28 ounce ribeye (very very ambitious)  We obviously didnt' even come close.  But it was cooked to absolute medium rare perfection....the truffle mashed potatoes were super super super smooth- and absolutely melted in your mouth.  We also go the broccolli....okay i'm started to get hungry just talking about this food.  Anyways service was out of this world, food was incredible and the atmosphere warm and chairs were super comfy!!  I can't wait to go back :)"

            "review": "What a disappointment! It's too bad that Prime is a big sore spot in what is otherwise a very strong lineup of restaurants at Bellagio.\n\nUnfortunately, we encountered service issues all night. Overall, the waitstaff seemed very slow and inattentive - which is amazing considering how many staff they seem to have just standing around - and I think some of the problems indicate poor management and training. Most noticeable was that we often had to flag down waiters to get our wine and water refilled. The food runners also kept putting food in front of the wrong people - this happened with our appetizers, entrees, and even after-dinner drinks! The most mind-boggling service failure occurred when the runners brought out all appetizers, salads, and soups at the same time, leaving a bunch of appetizers to be chucked in the middle of the table vaguely near the person who ordered them (and only after we told the runners who had ordered what).\n\nAlso, I think the way Prime does the table settings and places food could be improved; we were at a larger round table and it felt like waiters were constantly leaning over us to get to stuff nearer the middle of the table - personal space violations abound!\n\nAnd even given the service problems, Prime's biggest failing was that our steaks were very poorly prepared. Mine was perhaps the worst; they offered a bone-in filet as a special, which I ordered medium rare but came out extreme 'black and blue' - gushing red in the middle while being charred on the outside. Several party members noted they had steaks that were overcooked. The steak was also very, very salty.\n\nOriginally, I was going to give +1* because of some solid sides, including the truffle mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, gnocchi, and Brussels sprouts; also, my tuna ribbons appetizer was tasty, with a nice spicy kick to the accompanying sauce. The problem is, who goes to Prime for appetizers and sides and ignores the steak and bad service? I wouldn't, and even though Prime is closer to a 1.5, that's why I can't in good faith rate any higher than 1*."

This is a given and I have no problem with this, considering that we did get the patio seating.\n\nHere are the breakdowns...\n\n\nService : There was only 2 servers, that I saw, serving the entire patio floor, of perhaps 8 table or so.  It was difficult to flag a server for help.  For a restaurant of this caliber, I shouldn't have to flag a server, much less wrestle to get their attention.\nIn addition, the delivery of the drinks, the bread, and the food was painfully slow.  If not for the water show at the Bellagio fountain every 15 minutes, I would've thrown my hands in the air long before we received our food.\n\nFood: Our order was taken at about 8:50pm.  \nOur drinks and bread came at around 9:00pm (10 minutes after the order was taken?)  The 3 different types of bread were all cold and stale, but we were all famished so our party took in what we had.\nThe food came around 9:30pm (40 minutes AFTER our order!!!)\nIt arrived COLD and uninspired.  The cream of spinach was so cold that I could not separate it.  The whole thing lifted from its plate as one whole lump piece.\nGROSS!\nNone of the food was warm, or hot.  Why the food was left standing for so long is beyond me.  Our party was too tired from our delayed flight in to make an effort to flag a server to let them know of the food quality.\nThe porter house steak was uninspiring and overpriced at best.  The new york steak which was literally covered with peppercorn was so disgusting, that we had to return it for filet mignon...(surprisingly, the exchange only took 5 minutes!)\nFilet mignon, too, was just bland.  The ahi steak I had was just overpowered by the thick crust, and once again, non inspirational.\n\nTake away its \"PRIME\" location at bellagio, and this steakhouse would've been closed down long ago.\n\nI, for one, will not be returning."

However, like many Vegas institutions, once they \"jump the shark\" it typically does not get better. \n\nThe customer service has been lacking over the past several visits and it was absent on this recent dining night. I had to ask for bread three times and by the time it was brought out my bread plate was removed. Another guest requested drawn butter four times before it was brought out and by then the shellfish platter had been polished off. Additionally, several guests were forced to repeatedly ask for their drinks to be delivered. It may seem like a small detail, but the pepper mill did not work. Who is performing their quality control?\n\nFinally, the attached photo shows just one of the two garbage cans in men's room, both of which were in nearly identical condition. \n\nFor a restaurant at Bellagio, especially Prime, to be in this horrendous condition and without the management oversight needed to ensure a pleasant dining experience from a diner guest service experience is completely unacceptable. I have been dining here since their early days but Prime is off the list for future dining plans."

You can't beat the elegant cozy ambience sitting alongside the Bellagio fountains.  \n\nSeafood platter - raw clams, raw oysters, muscles, prawns, lobster, crab. Served with a plethora of sauces, your typical vinegar, horseradish, cocktail sauce, tabasco.  Everything elevated on a bowl of ice. My does it feel grand. A bowl for shells conveniently located just underneath.  To prepare you for the next course, a warm damp dinner napkin garnished with a lemon to cleanse your hands.  \n\nTartar and carpaccio - if you love it raw ;) you'll love this.  The drizzled sauce makes the carpaccio. It's delicious!   \n\nSides - creamed spinach, truffle mashed potatoes, beans... Probably the smallest serving of side dishes I've seen.  At least you can have space to try a little bit of everything. \n\nSteak - filet mignon *heart eyes* if this steak could be cooked any better, I doubt it. PERFECTION. just the right texture without char to the outside... Nice and tender on the inside.   Juicy and perfectly medium rare (how it should be ;) ) For the way it is seasoned I would never even think to adulterate it with unnecessary sauces.  3 sauces come alongside.  The famous one they point out, with ginger is TO DIE FOR.  \n\nI always appreciate good food, the best is the kind you crave. I read somewhere, that is the goal of the chef here.  With that sauce I refused to try, because I knew I didn't need it.  Icing on the cake, mission accomplished!  I already feel the withdrawals. \n\nService was excellent.   With a party of 6 I would say everything went smooth.  I'm ready for a date night with Prime!\n\nP.S.  I forgot my designer bag at the table.

The steaks were juicy, tender and packed with great flavor, and every single bite tantalized our taste buds more and more. Mine was so good that I didn't want to dip any of my 16 oz steak into the three sauces provided (i thought they were a bit too strong and didn't let the steak itself shine through), but my friend had no such qualms. After declaring it the best steak he's ever had, he fell in love with the miso sauce and proceeded to dip every single piece with the sauce since he loves strong flavors. So either way, it's melt-in-your-mouth kind of good steak.\n\nWe also ordered a side of whipped sweet potato and that was also amazing. A smooth, creamy texture with a hint of ginger to really let the sweetness shine through. \n\nAnd we were seated next to the Fountains. BEST EVER."

My husband ordered a $70 Porterhouse, which is a downgrade to his usual $120 Japanese Waygu, needless to say, he didn't quite like it. I thought it was perfectly cooked, he thought it to be way too salty. Oysters and wedge salad were good, and my Chilean Sea Bass was decent, but I have had better. Bread basket, I could do without, not impressive, and cocktails were ok. However, I was impressed by their Murano chandelier that hangs in one of the private dining rooms, only because I have had the pleasure to stare at the exact same one, but smaller, hanging in my parents dining room still to this day. Overall, it was  nice quiet dinner, enjoying each other and of course sitting there all gussied up, but I would probably pass and make this a one and only time."

Patio seating is always what we asked for during reservations too.\n\nThey always say patio seating is first come first serve, but we never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated from our reservation time. Service is top notch. Everyone is very kind and thorough. Someone is always making sure our drinks are filled and our table is free of crumbs. \n\nWe usually order the same things here. We share the 28oz bone in rib eye in medium, lobster Mac and cheese, some oysters and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. The steak is absolutely delicious and flavorful, cooked to perfection. It comes with a few sauces, but I only taste the sauces and not really having to use them because the steak is already perf without them. The side lobster Mac and mushrooms just go well with the steak.\n\nThe water show and night view of the strip is an extra added bonus to a romantic dinner here.

We tell him where we live and he starts talking about his timeshare there and how he can't be bothered to play at anything but the best clubs there. It was almost like he was talking down to us but kind of funny at the same time because we honestly don't really care.\n\nI was hosting a corporate dinner there and this guy was going for the company card with no mercy. Ask for a wine selection and he suggests a bottle that is on special for $140, so I select it. Well, he billed me $255/bottle so much for it being on special, I missed that when i went over the bill because I was looking at the up charge on the steaks. \n\nHe asks our guests if they would like something to start with, perhaps some caviar and a seafood tower made special for us. One of them spoke up and said we just came from an event where we had all of that. Before we could ask for other options, he looked annoyed and walked away, no give me a second, no i'll be right back, literally turned around and walked away. Our guests and I got a chuckle out of it. Then someone jokingly pointed out that the seafood app was $65/person and the caviar was up to an extra $200. \n\nThe server comes back after literally 15 minutes to take our order and starts the hard sell again. As we go around the table, some of the guests order the filet and he looks at them and says \"your want that bone in right?\", so they said yes, well no mention that the bone in is an extra $20 per guest. Its not a big deal but its the way he did it, his intentions were so obvious, he was just so slimy. Every suggestion he made was the most expensive thing he could think of. We went along with it but even the guests got a laugh out of it when he walked away. One commented that he should be a used car salesman with how apologetically sly he thought he was being. He hit the deserts and scotch hard as well, we just played along at this point. The guy was such a tool. Anyway, the bill came, I gave him a shitty tip and got out of there. This is the first time i have given under 15% ever. I know these people live off their tips and its a big deal but this guy was just so slimy i couldn't support it. Anyway, i'll never, ever, ever go back. The rest of the meals we had in vegas were great. We hosted a dinner at Sinatra's and it was awesome, we definetly spent way more per person which really didn't matter but when we left, we felt like I had been served well and got great food. It was a relaxing environment with class. Not some guy druling over your corporate card hitting you up like a used car salesman selling an 1985 caddilac.  \n\nAnyway, the food...\nThe good: \nBone in filet was amazing. Really well cooked, well seasoned and good sized.\nSalads were good as well, nothing out of this world but good.\nDesert was amazing. It really shined. \n\nThe bad\nThe steak tartar was terrible, its one of my favorite dishes normally but they had some kind of sour cream sauce on it and it was chopped in chunks with lots of big fat hunks. I would have sent it back but just didn't have the energy to deal with our server. He probably would have suggested that I wash the taste out with the Louis XIII and 2 ounces of caviar while he prepared a new \"special for me\" tartar for like $600... \n\nSo i leave you with this. If you want to go to a \"5 Star\" steak dinner hosted by a shameless used car salesman, this is the spot."

It was a half inch thick, and couldn't have weighed 12 oz. I haven't been to the Sizzler since I was 12, but I would give the edge to the Sizzler.

If not, or if you just like reading about poor dinners like watching a car accident, read on.  \n\nWe ordered the crabcakes.  And this is where the problems started.  We dutifully split it in half as usual, I began eating and noted it was good, then I bit into a crab shell.  Wow, that hasn't happened to me at any decent restaurant and I've had my share of crabcakes.  Disappointed but willing to overlook this, I bit into another piece of shell.  I'm paying a pretty decent sum for a crabcake that isn't remarkable in any way, and I'm biting into shells?  Unbelievable.\n\nNext up, the salads.  Except we didn't order salads.  They were for the table next to us.  With some horror I realized that our steaks and another table's salads were on the sam f-ing cart, but they served their salad first!  I don't think they do that kind of thing at a Black Angus, much less a restaurant that claims to be a top steakhouse.  Horrified but willing to ignore the two insults already suffered, we got our steaks and sides after a bit of a pause.  \n\nMy steak was ok.  18 oz bone-in ribeye.  The sauces weren't special but I'm not much of a sauce guy.  However, if you are going to pride yourself on your sauces, it should generate some interest from me.  Sides were decent.  Truffled mash potatoes were creamy, creamed spinach was what I expected.  I didn't much enjoy the bread though.  I got a pretzel roll that was extremely salty.  \n\nAnd then the final insult.  We finished our steaks, and waited a long time for our waiter to come back, but we didn't see him again.  The second cleaned up and brought us out the dessert menu, but that took quite some time.  At this point I hadn't seen our waiter in so long I assumed he actually left.  I thought that was incredibly rude to do that without turning the table over to someone.  Why are we ordering dessert still?  I wanted to give this place a chance to right the wrongs.  After ordering the crepe suzette (17 layers!), we waited a long time for our dessert.  A real long time.  And after finishing what I thought was a good dessert, we waited a long time for our check.  At this point our waiter returned!  We hadn't seen him since we ordered.  Apparently he had been taking care of another table.  He didn't tell us this, which would have alleviated a lot of the insult I felt by this time.  He cleared our dessert and we wanted no more of this restaurant.  It took a full 15 minutes for him to bring us our checks.  By this point we were angry.  We got here at about 6:45, and it was now 9:15.  So we spent an equal amount of time being seated, ordering and eating as we did waiting on our dessert and paying our check.  I won't be back here when there is so much better in town."

Definitely a place where \"pretty people\" go to eat/ be seen.  We had a reservation and had to wait for 10-15 minutes, but nothing major.\n\nI cannot give 5 stars because it was not the best steak that I ever had.  For a $62 filet, I was expecting a bigger serving than 10 ounces, but it was very good and cooked properly.  Another member of my party was disappointed in the cooking of his steak, which was ordered rare, but he still ate it and said it was good.  Meat quality wasn't the best and didn't seem to be as good as my favorite Chicago steak joints.\n\nOur server was professional and knew his stuff, even after being questioned on random food details by the foodie member of my party.  He wasn't in our face, but was very attentive and also sent over a free desert for my friends birthday.....no singing thank God!\n\nWould never tell anyone not to go there, but there might be better steak places in Vegas.  Because it's in the Bellagio and has a view of the fountains, can be considered a destination restaurant."

Our reservation was at 6 but took us at 5:40. We got to see the fountain show 4 times while eating so that made it more perfect for out staycation. Our server was an Asian male with glasses. He was very robotic and didn't smile once. I know it's fine dining but smiling helps. A lot of the work was done for him by his assistants. I figure with all that help you would spend more time with your tables. They forgot my coke not once...but twice...\n\nI loved the food. Can't complain AT ALL. My soy garlic glazed Ny strip was cooked to perfection. On the side I had tempura onion rings. The kitchen cooks very well here. My Favorite part of the meal was the bacon wrapped shrimp. It came with a passion fruit sauce that more than paired well with it and made it more interesting than a normal BBQ sauce that's served with that dish normally. Only negative thing is that the shrimp came with 3 pieces and there was two of us. Spending $28 for one piece of shrimp was a little extreme. \n\nFrom the host to the server assistants to the fountain show to dinner this place was a hit. The service can be more personable and empathetic. \nManager table touch would have made this night even better. Didn't even see one all night and it wasn't busy.\n#ComingFromPeopleInTheIndustry"

The steak and service  is on par with other high end steakhouses I've been to, but what's really special about this place is the ambiance. The setting is very intimate and you have a view of the fountain/Bellagio watershow from the restaurant. Great spot for a special occasion.\n\nAs for the food, the dungeness crab salad tastes like a very expensive california roll sans the rice--light, refreshing and tasty, but not sure if it's worth the price. The dry aged bone in rib eye was tender, beefy and flavorful, but i'd definitely suggest you split it with your dining companion(s) because it is way too much meat for one person. The chilean sea bass (which was what I ordered) was a smidgen overcooked and therefore a tad dry, but the portion was also huge at 8oz; usually restaurants give you a small filet of fish, but the portion here was double the size. This place is definitely not for those on a diet as the food is quite rich and heavy."

The wine list is pretty expansive as well.\n\nLow lights: Prime's ambiance is extremely stuffy. The waitstaff does little in the way of making you feel at home and we found our server to be very impatient and overbearing. The ornate setting doesn't really compliment the menu properly, however the panoramic windows in the dining room provide a nice view of the Bellagio's water show. None of our steaks had been seasoned before cooking which is practically a cardinal sin. How would any chef hope to create the perfect crust and flavor profile without a generous helping of salt and black pepper? Seriously disappointing...\n\nIf you're staying at the Bellagio and looking for a steak dinner, Prime is a convenient option. Otherwise, go to the absolutely fantastic Carnevino at the Palazzo."

In retrospect the waiter really wasnt trying to sell.the special.I should have heeded this.To my surprise what came was 3 slices of what looked like Jennie  O turkey loaf,(it was tough to cut with a steak knife!)on top of a meager amount of mashed potatoes(  I think it was baby food )with a huge glop of canned  cranberry sauce ,a square of dark meat confit and a square of stuffing(the best tasting part of entire dish),reminiscent of McDonald's  fried hashbrown squares,awful Brussel sprouts ,drizzled with a tiny amount of gravy.Im not sure where the best turkey dinner was in Las Vegas on Thanksgiving  day 2015,but Prime takes the cake for one of the worst  I've ever had.I did not finish.\nSkipped dessert   we were weary of loud  pretentious annoying neighbor blathering with his neighbors  about world politics, his world travels,terrorism,Donald Trump  and Hillary Clinton, and left feeling disappointed, had planned this dinner for 3 months and expected excellence,only 3 stars due to service and ambience."

The food itself was very good: the oysters, bacon-wrapped shrimp, pea soup, and wagyu were all hits with the table.

That was however most definitely NOT the case. We started the experience by having a manager approach my brother and ask him to roll down his pants. My brother is a fashion stylist and was in Gucci and looked great, meanwhile guys in Levi's and kids in ripped jeans are walking by, no problem. But ok, fine, we get it....dress code is dress code. You would think said manager would later stop by to check on us given how he started the experience...he did not, strike 2. We just got back from a trip to Napa so we brought our own bottle of wine, we called ahead and found out the corking fee was $50...steep, but fine. When we sat down the waiter aggressively told us that the corking fee was $50, three times! As if we were stupid or he'd convince us to buy his overpriced wine? Strike 3. Our salads came and they were good, the Caesar was a typical steakhouse Caesar but the wedge was really good. Delicious blue cheese dressing. Now they were starting to redeem themselves, a little. After the salad course it took a good 30 minutes before our steaks came out. That is way too much time between courses in my opinion. When my rib eye came out it was over cooked. I order medium rare and it was at least medium plus bordering on well done. I told the waiter (new guy, maybe second in command?) that my steak was over cooked. He aggressively questioned me. Told me I needed to cut it in the middle to be sure, so I did and it was. He held it up, shined a light on it and was like, no this is our medium rare and that's what you ordered. He was so condescending and rude it was ridiculous! Finally my brother told him to take it back and cook it properly. They brought it out again and this time it was rare. I ate it because I just wanted to get out of there. Oh and during the wait, while my entire family was enjoying their meal, did said manager or waiter #1 come ask me if I needed anything or apologize? Nope. In fact, waiter #1 didn't even check on us at all after our steaks came out, he came back at the end to ask if we wanted dessert which we of course passed on. Overall, the food was fine, but not worth the inflated prices and terrible, condescending service. We will never return and will be spreading the word. If you're up for a pretentious place with staff that think they're better than you, then go ahead and drop $150/head here. If not, go elsewhere. In fact, I was at Fix, Bellagio's cheaper steakhouse and had a much better experience. My date's (a chef) steak was over cooked there and they handled it flawlessly. They took it back immediately and the manager came to check on us and bright him a scotch. My recommendation - spend your money elsewhere."

The decor was pretty nice - has a nice view of the fountains, not as nice as the view from Picasso, but ok.  The filet mignon was cooked well, but the flavor was lacking especially from a steak that is supposed to be prime quality.  The sides were just ehh... the citrus glazed baby carrots ended up being large carrots cut up into little strips - not impressive.  The dungeness crabcake appetizer was also disappointing - being a little too fried and lacking in flavor - definitely not worth the price.  Also tried the diver scallops with sweet pea ravioli - the scallops were overcooked and the vinaigrette sauce was way too overpowering for the dish.  The service was also a bit lacking - not of the quality that one would expect when eating at a high end steak restaurant.  Overall, would not go back"

As long as you realize that, you'll be fine.\n\nThe special that night was a bone-in filet that was incredible.  I've never had such a good steak and I am well-versed in the ways of cow chunks.  Also to die for were the truffle mashed potatoes.  I could have eaten a giant bowl of these myself.\n\nFor an appetizer we had a giant bowl of seafood containing lobster, shrimp, oysters, clams, and king crab legs.  It was fantastic and would have made a nice meal by itself.\n\nThe wine is expensive.  I didn't see a single bottle for under $70.  Be prepared to spend big."

The steak is certainly phenomenal, but I'll leave that to the other reviewers to rave about.  I don't think the steak is the BEST in the world, but my best might not be your best.  Once you hit a certain level of goodness, it's becomes exponentially difficult to stratify what is best and what is second or third best.  \n\nBut I think I've fallen in love with our waiter that night.  If he was my waiter at every restaurant I go to, then all my yelp reviews would probably end up with an extra star.  Friendly, engaging, accommodating, caring, smart, eloquent, polite, perceptive...I've ran out of adjectives...   Too bad he's not the person who actually bring you the food or takes away your food; they were not as A+ quality.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful and if you're lucky or special or important enough, you'll be able to get a seat at the window/balcony and watch the fountain show every 15 min.  But don't expect to get those seats if you're not  some VVVIP.   And unfortunately, being that this is in sin city, you will occasionally see diners in t-shirt and jeans...just look away and stare at the pretty decor instead...\n\nSide note:\nI met Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten the night before at the Grand Tasting (a Vegas Uncork'd event) and what a gentleman.  Super nice and kind and took the minute to autograph my souvenir bag :)"

We arrived at 9 pm, walked passed the outside patio area and asked to be seated there, since almost all of the tables were open.  This rude hostess told us that they didn't offer patio dining and to try Picasso's or Olives.  What?  I had been seated in the patio many other times.  Dismayed, we left.  Upon returning, another hostess greeted us and asked if we would like inside or outside. Right then, the original hostess popped up from behind the counter and exclaimed \"I already told them we don't offer outside dining!\"  We were dressed very nice and were very pleasant, yet couldn't understand why this woman was so hell-bent on not giving us a patio table.\nWe then took a table inside.  I asked the waiter when they stopped serving outside.  He said that there were plenty of open tables, and he would ask the hostess.  She then came to our table and told us that those table were for reservations only.  It was then 9:20 and 4 tables were open.  Not sure what was said in private, but we were then moved to the patio.  No other parties ever did take those tables until closing.\nThis hostess, with her condescending yet does it with a smile attitude, was by far the rudest person I have come across in a long time.  I will never go back, no matter how good the food is. The rudeness overpowers all of that and ruined what should have been a great dinner celebration."

            "review": "Prime Steakhouse in the Bellagio is owned by the reknowned chef Jean-George Vongerichten. I have eaten at his name-sake restaurant in New York so I was very excited to experience the food here. My overall opinion would have to be that the restaurant was good, but fell short in a few areas.\n\nMy friend and I split two dishes, the Chilean Sea Bass served over braised mushrooms, poblano peppers and dill, and the special: a bone-in filet that was dry-aged 21 days. They served our meal first, which was a little disconcerting as it was split table-side. I was slightly cringing at the thought of the other dishes getting colder while ours was being prepared. The filet was terrific, perfectly cooked and juicy, while the sea bass was good, but rather un-inspired. The mushrooms underneath the seabass were superb, however, the poblano and dill were so mild the flavors never would have been obvious to the consumer. My friend's fiance ordered the roasted duck breast with almond crust and red wine amaretto sauce. The crust was fantastic, but sadly the duck was tough. The best dish of the evening was ordered by my friend's grandma. This was the rack of lamb with smoked chili glaze and broccoli rabe. The lamb was so tender and juicy, and the inherent flavor was fantastic. Obviously it came from a really good little lamb.\n\nAs far as the sides, I would have to say they were hit and miss. The brussell sprouts were something worth going back for. They were roasted with just the right amount of char, and the use of pistachio nuts was ingenious. Execution = perfect. The sweet potato puree, which I swear also involved butternut squash, was superb, but the parmesean broccoli was painfully overcooked and the florets were cut too large for easy sharing.\n\nAll in all, I would say that Prime definitely uses great ingredients, and the food was solid, yet for the price I think one should demand more. I think this is a case of the talented, celebrity chef opening up a restaurant in Vegas because the $$$ is there (or rather, used to be there) and in the process reliquished a bit too much power to someone not as talented as themselves."

            "review": "This has been my third experience with Prime. I guess I will look for something else. Honestly the only draw here is to dine by the fountain which I guess I would advise to maybe try one of the other restaurants in the Bellagio or watch the show from the street a couple of times and get your fix. Prime markets itself as an upscale steakhouse, they have a dress code that is barely enforced. They may need to revisit this policy. I am far from a snob but if I am going to go to the work to get \"dressed for dinner\" and go out to enjoy the evening, it would make the experience much nicer if all the other patrons would make a little more effort to a least look nice. Both occassions we came here and had dinner were special occassions (birthday and anniversary) and I would summize that most of the other patrons were there for the same. I was the only male there in a button down shirt with collar. Really? T shirts and crappy old jeans with tennis shoes that is business attire for men? Women dressed like service staff for hooters pass for dress code? We got a table at the outside table to enjoy the fountain show during dinner, every time the show started some of the other patrons stood up and went to the fence to watch and take pictures thus blocking everyone elses view. Isnt this something that could have been done out on the street? The one woman was jumping and clapping in a leopard print dress her ass in front of some elderly woman whos view was completely blocked. I dont know it just ruined the entire experience.  I guess overall I blame management for not controlling the situation, if you have patrons behaving in a way that is disruptive, speaking loadly and inappropriate language (saying FUCK every other word) just diminishes the experience for the other patrons who are trying to have a nice meal. I dont mind this if I am at the bar but here??? Overall It is an overpriced applebees."

I had a couple of people recommend this restaurant and I was so excited to try it out when we got to Vegas. The decor is lux and beautiful. Very elegant but not too much. Low lighting created a great romantic atmosphere. Especially the booming of the water fountains at Bellagio.What great entertainment. \n\nWell with all the ambiance I was drooling for what more has to come. The service was great, staff was very nice but it wasn't outstanding for an expensive restaurant especially for Vegas. The bread and butter was nothing to rave about. So come on steak! I'm a Rib Eye fan and always order it so then I can do a fair comparison for the quality and taste of the steak. When the steak had arrived, I dived into it and kept on cutting and cutting. Well it wasn't as buttery as I hoped. The fat on it didn't taste that great. And the meat itself was okay. Don't get me wrong. I did eat a majority of it with the three accompanying sides. 2 out of 3 were good. The mushrooms I would not recommend but the potatoes with the bacon marmalade was very good. My husband didn't think his steak was amazing either but we loved seeing the fountains. \n\nWould I recommend this place? No not really. There are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas this one was not one of them. It wasn't that it was bad but it was just disappointing. The one steakhouse that was unforgettable is STEAK from Gordan Ramsey at the Paris. That place I give 5 stars."

It definitely was not! \n I feel short changed with the whole experience, not just because it was pricey but because it did not end up being the special dining experience we though it would be. The service was poor and the waiter displayed an arrogant and condescending attitude during the service, which I found interesting coming from a waiter. \n\nWhen I made the reservation I had requested seating either by the window or in a booth/table combo. Neither one of these requests were accommodated.\n\n I was staying in a suite so we had requested that the under cooked steak be boxed we requested that the salmon that was ordered not to be boxed as the fish might spoil the steak and had also explained that the lobster had been entirely eaten which was clear to see . We had figured we could cook it thoroughly ourselves and have it later as a snack. When the steak was boxed it contained the waste and scraps from the lobster tail that was entirely eaten. It seemed like it was some sort of insult for requesting togo boxes. We threw the steak out. \n\nThe cost of dinner for two was $400.00. I would definitely say Prime did not live up to expectations. \n\nWithout sounding entirely negative the lobster was decent but not exemplary and the restaurant's decorations were beautiful and opulent."

I think Steve Wynn's group learned from that oversight as he thought through Botero and the SW Steakhouse.  Once you experience the settings at those places, it's hard to overlook it at Prime.  \n\nYou'll have up close views of the fountain show here, but the better views of it are across the street at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant."

Some detail on each:\n\nAmbiance - The restaurant is nicely decorated with long curtains and the tables were well spaced so that you weren't sitting on top of anyone else. They played great standards in the background (Sinatra, Tony Bennett, etc.) One of the biggest pluses is the setting -- you're right next to the Bellagio fountain. It definitely adds to the experience to be able to watch the water cannons fire off every 10 minutes. Be warned, though, I don't think every table has a good view of the fountains. You might want to request that when you make your reservation.\n\nService - All of the service staff, from the hostess to the busboys to our waiter Russell were very friendly. Everyone was polite and asked how you were doing. This is the kind of class you expect from a nice steakhouse. On the other hand, Russell was actually almost a little too chatty. When he found out we were from New York, he took the opportunity to tell us about his daughter's recent trip to New York with her friends and on and on he went. This happened a couple of other times too. Listen, it could've been much worse. He was very friendly and offered good advice about the food. But someone just needs to remind him that people don't go out to eat to make friends with the waiter.\n\nFood - Smallish house cocktail list. My wife enjoyed the house cosmopolitan. I ordered a Chimay Red from the good-sized beer menu. For dinner, I had the 21-day aged bone-in filet mignon special. The waiter said it was 8-10 ounces but when the plate came out it was definitely at least 10. Was overcooked just a tad (more like medium than medium rare) but had excellent flavor anyway that was even better with some of the waiter-recommended soy ginger steak sauce. My wife had a New York strip which was served already marinated in a soy-ginger glaze. That, too, was very flavorful. We added a side of the brussel sprouts and pancetta, which we gobbled up eagerly. My wife's only complaint was that her steak knife was actually quite dull -- she traded knives with me and even though I had the more delicate cut of meat, I still had some difficulty making a clean cut in my filet. For dessert, my wife enjoyed a delicious bread pudding and I struggled to finish a large, tasty trio of raspberry, coconut and mango sorbet."

I almost felt uncomfortable with how pretentious the vibe was during our dining experience. The food was excellent, I will say, but a Prime Cut of meat, is a Prime Cut of meat at some point. It wasn't anything I haven't had before for half the price. This is Vegas though and I definitely knew to expect an expensive dinner. The more disappointing part was the service. I don't even think our sever told us his name. It felt very impersonal and was not an \"experience\" at all. Everything was rushed and he was not sincere, just very pushy. It would have sat better with me spending $260 for an entree and two sides if the dining experience was enjoyable. The wine list is very small and prices are extremely inflated. Definitely won't be back :("

Unfortunately, it took three tries to get my bone-in filet right. I asked for medium and got medium well-well. I sent it back and got my cut steak cooked longer until fully well. They obviously weren't listening to what I said. They re-did it again and got it right.  My fiance's peppercorn NY Strip was overcooked on the first try (ordered med. rare and received med. plus), as well.  It was sent back and replaced with a rare to medium rare steak (not perfect but acceptable).  Truffle mashed and crab mashed were great!  Steak had good flavor but I'm not sure if it was $70 quality, though. I've definitely had better steaks for half the price.  The ambiance and front row patio seating for the fountains made up for alot.\n\nService was below par for the level that you expect in a restaurant of this caliber.  Our waiter \"forgot\" about us several times.  He basically disappered from our table, only to be seen serving couples that arrived after us.  Like I mentioned before, the service was sub-par.\n\nGreat location with romantic views of the fountains but that can only take a restaurant so far.  The food and service must be kept at the same level.  The photographer that comes around and takes pictures, which will be available for purchase, did a great job.  She took some great shots and provided a great memory of a special dinner / trip.  The pictures were resonably priced, as well.\n\nNext time, we'll try one of the many other high-end steakhouses in Vegas."

The mac and cheese wasn't my taste, as it had gouda and Sharp cheddar, a little too strong. The French onion soup was huge and the best I've had. I would return solely for the purpose of ordering the French onion soup. Definitely ask for a table inside and by a window so that you can view the bellagio water show while eating dinner. There is an outdoor eating area, but it's not as nice as the decor indoors."

Nine at Palms has better ambiance - if you are more into people watching and scene than the food I would choose there.  The steak here is top quality - I shared the porterhouse, sampled someone else's kobe (which was amazing), and, luckily, did not have to pick up the check!  Definitely a more low key, quiet atmosphere........I sort of felt like going into a food coma after eating vs. hitting the clubs to party all night (this is Vegas, after all).  One highlight was the patio outside for dessert - you get a close up view of the water fountain show at Bellagio, which is a different experience than seeing it from the street.  This was fun - and would also be a cool first date thing to impress."

            "review": "Primed with a gift card from my son and daughter-in-law to ease the financial outlay required to dine well here, Diane and I at last ventured forth to sample Prime.  And, besides finding it to be the most expensive restaurant we have each visited to date ($330.52 for 2 diners, including tax and tip, but without any alcoholic beverages), even taking into account many renowned restaurants we have frequented at some time or other across the globe, it was without doubt one of the best.  We did not scrimp on food, but did not order that extravagantly either.\n\nAfter being promptly seated at one of the few booths in the cavernous restaurant as requested in our reservation, with a distant but still good view of the Bellagio Fountains, and immediately receiving black cloth napkins substituted out for the white ones on the table to cover our black pants, we decided to begin with a Shrimp Cocktail app.  After being presented with big shrimps unconventionally lying side by side on a plate, we then enjoyed the great cold and meaty morsels, which I dunked in a fresh and quite tasty Wasabi Cocktail Sauce.\n\nNext for me was a large gargoyle-headed, and seemingly bottomless, white crock of hot and cheesy Prime Onion Soup.  With well-caramelized onions, a very generous supply of clotted Gruyere and Emmentaler Cheeses, and a few chives sprinkled on top, it was a memorable Onion Soup Gratinee that took me awhile to fully consume.  But of course I eventually did, to the last drop!\n\nFor our entree we each ordered a medium-rare 10 oz. Filet Mignon.  The tall and long, lightly charred prime-grade steaks yielded buttery, melt in the mouth meat which was quite tasty in its own right, but even better after being joined with a trio of sauces: Soy-Rice Wine Sauce, Peppercorn Sauce, and classic Bearnaise Sauce.  I enjoyed alternating forkfuls of beef with a few drops of the three sauces, and never did determine a clear favorite between the Soy-Rice Wine Sauce and the Bearnaise.  Each was an excellent flavor amplifier of the perfectly cooked beef, as were the Shishito Peppers that accompanied my Filet.\n\nAlong with our steaks we split a single wide Crab Leg from South Africa with Drawn Butter at $38.00 a pop.  I had decided in advance that if the one crab leg seemed insufficient, I would order another.  But there was no need.  In fact, because my stomach was quite full, I left 2 ounces of my steak on my plate, uneaten, which is uncharacteristic for me, and which I now regret!  \n\nI'm sure that our sides took a toll on our bodies as well, making us very content.  For what is a steak dinner without some fine sides?  And fine sides we had!  Gratin Dauphinois Potatoes were as cheesy and as great as they looked in photos on Yelp.  We reveled in oozing Comte Cheese.  And, Roasted Glazed Market Mushrooms were a quite interesting array of several types of mushrooms, including Enoki.  Each side was easily enough for two diners, and a few mushrooms were also left behind.\n\nNot to be overlooked were the fine slices of complimentary Sourdough Bread and great Raisin Bread with Walnuts served with an elongated slab of butter with some specks of Chive Salt on top.  Initially I thought I had encountered my first slice of salty Sourdough Bread--until I realized that the Chive Salt was causing the sensation of a burst of salt in my mouth.  But I grew to like this, and more Chive Salt Butter was ordered, quickly received, and slathered on more bread.\n\nTo finish, Diane enjoyed Warm Valrhona Cake with a molten center and a scoop of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, while I very much liked my scoop of Chocolate Sorbet specially adorned with a brittle Chocolate Bow.\n\nService by three attendants was superb.  A request for decaffeinated Iced Tea was responded to with three successive pots of brewed hot decaffeinated Chamomile Tea and Relax Tea made specially for me, and poured over a large glass of ice.  Water glasses were continually filled without any need for a request, and we were regularly visited by a member of our formally clad waitstaff to see if we needed anything.  \n\nOur seating in a corner booth was very comfortable.  And the sumptuous decor surrounding us, combined with our window view of rising jets of water from the fountains just outside and the sound of jazzy music piped in overhead, afforded a classy, upscale ambiance that, along with the wonderful food, yielded a luxurious and quite memorable five-star dining experience.\n      \nI am going to start saving real soon for our next visit to Prime, and highly recommend this dining experience to all!"

I never liked any sauce with my steak but that sauce... whatever it was, it was like MAGIC. \n\nFilet Mignon: This was so tender and juicy. It literally felt like it was melting in my mouth. \n\n28 oz Bone in Rib eye: This was so HUGE. It could fill up two people. So if you wanted to save a bit of money, ordering the 28 oz and sharing it with another person would be a good idea. This was a little bit tougher than the filet mignon but it's still soft and very flavorful.\n\nYukon Gold Mashed Potatoes: This was the best mashed potato of my life! I just wanted to go back just for this. Unfortunately you can't order food in the bar area so we were never able to have some of this delicious side.\n\nMac and cheese: Very cheesy but it also had a soft taste and the cheese they used didn't overwhelm us. It was really delicious.\n\n\n\nNegative: Steaks didn't come with sides. The sides were 12-18$ a piece."

I always order this as an appetizer to start off. \n\nI only eat medium rare steak - (each visit) my steak has been prepared to perfection! \n\nI do not feel taking photos of my dishes (in this classier environment) is ideal.

It's odd, though, jackets are preferred for men but they have no coat check. Anyhow, it's a nice dining room with fountain views. We noshed on the bread basket filled with a variety of sour dough, pretzel and raisin walnut.\n\nFirst Course\nTomato Gazpacho; Summer Flavors, Marcona Almonds & Olive Oil and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp; Passion Mustard & Cumin Scented Honey\n\nSecond Course\nFilet Medallions; Sweet Corn, Crispy Spaetzle & Fiore Sardo Cheese\n\nThird Course\nWarm Valrhona Chocolate Cake; Vanilla Ice Cream and Summer Berries; Strawberry Gel\u00e9e & Marsala Cream\n\nThe gazpacho must have been a blend of tomatoes and watermelon. It would make the perfect smoothie. Still, it was a refreshing treat with fun surprises of raspberries, strawberries, peppers, and marcona almonds. The shrimp were properly cooked and the bacon was nice and crisp. The flavor was a unique blend of sweet and smokey.\n\nThe filet was cooked to perfect and it sliced like butter. It was fantastic on its own, but coupled with the shallot sauce? Wow. We agreed the Bearnaise and au pouvoir hindered the already fabulous flavor of the steak. The spaetzle was light and tasty with the sweetness from the corn.\n\nDessert were tasty, but they were the weakest links of the meal. Properly executed but both just lacked pizazz. Service was attentive throughout the meal. Prior to Restaurant Week, we had never dined in a Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant. We've been missing out. Both Prime and Jean-Georges were highly enjoyable."

I guess when I order a steak medium-well I expect it to be slightly pink, not totally gray through and through and on the tough side.  The macaroni and cheese was so sharply cheesy I honestly could not eat it.  The truffle mashed potatoes were too truffly (I didn't think that was possible until Prime). The bread basket was excellent though. \n\nThe bar is very small so if you have to wait for a table you're pretty much standing in the foyer. \n\nThe hosting staff has an impeccable system for knowing who is next to be seated, what time your reservation is and \"remembering\" your name. This impressed me a great deal.  \n\nThe waitstaff was good but a bit stuffy.  \n\nThe room was nicely appointed and appealingly quiet except for a large party that had three very young children with them (all certainly under 5 years old who spent a great deal of time crying and unhappy - why bring children to a restaurant like this?).    \n\nWith so many options in Las Vegas, I certainly wouldn't choose to dine here again."

We order sooo much food, we had to take some of it home!!! \n\nCame here for a friends birthday celebration and we sat at a nice table with a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. Started off with drinks of course. I ordered the Prime Car which is made of Zaya rum (my favorite rum!!!) and orange Cura\u00e7ao served up with a sugar rim. It was fabulous, right up my alley, so much that I had a couple more. If you order the perfect gin and tonic, which is tangurey, tonic, cucumber and mint... Be aware that this is served in a wine glass, up with the bottle of fever-tree tonic on the side. This way it will not be watered down. \n\nWe had two seafood platters amongst the 7 of us... And we demolished these! It had crab, lobster, oysters, mussels, clams and shrimp! Also came with a few trays of sauces. \n\nI ordered French onion soup, which came out to the table earlier than I expected, but was also taste worthy. \n\nHere comes the steak!!!! Amazing!!! I had the bone in ribeye and there were plenty of filets around the table. A steak is amazing if it doesn't need any additives... And although this needed no additives I just had to try the three sauces they offered on the table. The peppercorns had some spice too them and was my favorite! I had a couple bites of the sea bass too, and although it was good, it wasn't nearly as good as Noodles (restaurant also in Bellagio). \n\nCreamy spinach was a weird flavor to me. Shiitake mushrooms had ALL the flavor.  \n\nWe ordered blow job shots but really wanted Cinnamon Toast Crunch shots. I advise them to get Rum Chatta at the bar, it's becoming too popular now not to have it. \n\n\nWe had a cake ordered at Jean Phillipe do we didn't order from the Prime dessert menu. \n\nStaff was very attentive; pulling out chairs to sit and collecting our belongings that fell on the floor.

After a rather disappointing experience at his other outpost next door, the JG Steakhouse at the Aria, I was a little skeptical to say the least ... that feeling went away the instant I entered in.\n\nSituated \"lake-side\" next to the 2star Michelin PIcasso, Prime occupies one of the best locations in the hotel overlooking the famous fountains of the Bellagio.  If you reserve early enough you can easily request prime seating, pun intended, with a beautiful view of the lake, the fountains and the Vegas strip.  \n\nAs for the food, we started with the grilled foie gras with jalapeno marmalade.  The foie was excellent and cooked to perfection ... though I must admit, I find it exceedingly difficult to use the words \"foie gras\" and \"disappointment\" in the same sentence.   We opted for the 28oz bone-in rib eye for two. Now I must say that in reviewing any steakhouse in the past, I always get the rib eye and therefore I can honestly say that I'm comparing apples to apples.  The rib eye was cooked perfectly and the table side carving was a nice and sexy touch. The beef was super tender and full of flavor with the proper amount of marbling.  The steak came with several sauces - and though I don't normally use \"sauce\" at a high end steakhouse such as Prime ... I must admit that the soy rice wine sauce gave the steak that extra punch ... that it didn't necessarily need it was more than fine the way it was.  For the sides, the truffle mash potatoes were exceptional as well as the mac and cheese ... though I more than preferred the truffled mash version at the JG Steakhouse next door.  The lemon tart dessert was a bit of an after thought ... but then again I came here for some great steak and a great steak I had.\n\nAgain, in my eternal crusade to find the perfect steakhouse ... Prime is at the moment, the undisputed leader of the pack.  The impeccable service, the elegant interior, and most importantly, the unparalleled steaks combine to truly put this place in a class of its own.  I suspect that I will no longer be trying any other steakhouses in Vegas as I have officially found my favorite steakhouse in Vegas if not the entire planet.  The bar has undoubtedly been raised by Prime."

They said no guarantees but they will try..\n\n\nAt 7 we came in and had to wait an additional 20 minutes. No big deal. \n\nOur waiter was a bit awkward. He seemed to be in character of an over anxious server in a semi mocking way. Almost like Geoffrey from fresh prince of bel air. I also noticed he didnt speak like that to any of the other tables he served, his tone of voice and personality completely changed. But he remained in this character for our table. When he approached us he didn't introduce himself or ask how we were. Just asked if we were ready to order drinks from out of nowhere. \n\n\nWe ordered the aged rib eye, short ribs, shrimp cocktail , and truffle mashed potatoes. \n\nThe short ribs were so soft and tender. It was probably the stand out if the dishes we ordered. The shrimp cocktail came with four shrimps that were basically the size of baby lobsters i felt. Very meaty and enjoyable. \n\nThe aged rib eye was good but left me wanting for a bit more. When i bit into it i couldnt help but think this was a somewhat mediocre steak. The three sauces it came with were fun, but i was slightly disappointed in the steak itself. \n\nThe truffle mashed potatoes were good but very whipped, borderline runny; maybe more than what I'm used to. But the truffle flavor was definitely there. \n\n We sat smack in the front of the fountains in the inside of the restaurant. During winter months it can be a bit cold. All in all im glad i tried this place out. However , i think one time is enough for me."

            "review": "If a six star existed, Prime would be the one to get it. I had one of the most delicious meals of my life in one of the most beautiful settings around. Imagine eating a 5 star steak meal window-side to an eye-level view the Bellagio Fountains. Picture front row access to a one-of-a-kind Bellagio Fountain show and eating as the Fountain goes off every 15 minutes in front of your window. This is an experience at Prime. \n\nNow, mostly everyone has described the food perfectly so I want to focus chat more about the picturesque atmosphere. Yes, the dress code exists so don't plan on coming here unless your dressed to impress. Yes this is the perfect option for a delicious high-end meal (without the cheesy Vegas vibe) and yes, this is probably one of the most fancy restaurants I've ever dined at. I really can't do justice to the restaurant's setting and while it is a little stuffy, it's perfect for a delicious and delightful dining experience. \n\nI can't leave this review without mentioning the food, especially since it was perfectly flawless. The wedge salad has the right amount of dressing with just enough kick and the pretzel bread that comes with the meal is buttery perfection. But let me talk about the real winners of the meal: the sides and the main courses. You know when people say Filet tastes like butter? Well now I know what they mean. I have never tasted anything so tender in my life. The short ribs are so perfectly cooked that you don't need a knife to enjoy it (maybe a little elf magic helped the chefs create these culinary creations!?) Finally, the sides. Oh the sides! Truffle mashed potatoes. They are expensive and come in a very small kettle. However, it's so rich in flavor and butter that it can easily fill up two people, especially with accompanying sides and an entree. The mac 'n cheese is just as delicious. Between those two sides, a salad and an entree, I could easily have called this my last supper and been happily content in life."

We usually start out with the seafood sampler platter which is a jaw dropping mound of ice with lobster, crab, shrimp, oysters, etc.   I'm not a big red meat eater so I usually get seafood, although a couple times I've ordered a steak. Everything has always been delicious and the service is great.\n\nThey have a private room that seats 12 in the back which has been perfect for our group dinners. If you are staying at the Bellagio you have to try this place out. Especially if you can expense dinner. ;o)"

We had a quaint table in a dining area near a large window so we could see some of the fountain. I started out with the Shrimp cocktail which was 4 large shrimp with cocktail sauce perfectly displayed on a bed of ice with lemon. They were delicious and a perfect appetizer. We both ordered the Caesar salad which was not only delicious but a nice sizable portion. I ordered the filet mignon which was superb and my companion got the dry aged bone in ribeye which he loved. We split the truffled mashed potatoes which were so creamy and delectable and a perfect portion to share. They did give us a nice bread basket with various bread including my favorite pretzel bread. We were too stuffed for dessert. The service was absolutely impeccable and friendly. Would definitely go back. Definitely pricey. Also, I might add there is a dress code which was not necessarily enforced."

The service from start to finish was impeccable. I started with the iceberg wedge salad, and the blue cheese was divine as was the bacon. I ordered the dry-aged bone in ribeye. It was absolutely huge, cooked perfectly, and came with three sauces. I'm a sauce girl so I was excited to see bernaise, au poivre, and soy ginger brought to the table with that marvelous piece of meat. The side dish I cannot stop thinking about.... the truffle mashed potatoes. They are a must have, and I salivate even thinking about them. Such heaven. I will definitely be going back."

I went for a birthday dinner in a group of 5, made reservations, and we were seated as soon as we arrived. We probably weren't as dressed up as we could have been, but we were all presentable, and there were no issues. The table ordered a variety of things from appetizers through dessert: the french onion soup, wedge salad, filet mignon, ribeye, chicken, salmon, loaded baked potato, asparagus, lava cake, and more! We also enjoyed cocktails beforehand, and even those were noteworthy. The service was impeccable, with water refilled as needed throughout the night, without ever having to ask. They timed letting us get settled, ordering drinks, followed by appetizers, meals and desserts perfectly. I am definitely going back the next time I'm in Vegas, and would recommend this to anyone looking for a beautiful restaurant, delicious meal, and flawless service to round out your night!"

I don't want to give anyone the false impression that the food or service here is in any way bad (or even close to it), but for the money you are paying, the food falls well short of expectations.  \n\nThe high point of my trip to Prime was the service, which was outstanding as expected, service that even went as far as to bring out an extra table cloth for a member of our party who was cold due to one of the doors being left open.  The food, however, was just uninspiring.  The bottom line is that you can have food that is just as good, if not better, at a number of other places on the strip, for much less money.  Everything was prepared and presented perfectly, as expected, but it sadly doesn't make up for the fact that I've had better steaks for much less money, and the service, ambiance, and prestige of Prime Steakhouse doesn't make up the difference in price.  \n\nI have very high expectations for Prime, and they simply were not met."

            "review": "The Prime Steakhouse is an elegant restaurant tucked away within the confines of the Bellagio Hotel. Unlike the other steakhouses located on the strip, the Prime is one of those classy restaurant that caters to the sophisticated diner with high expectations in service and the quality of the food. Reservations are strongly recommended and an evening in this restaurant will set you back a minimum of $250 for two people. \n\nOverview: I have visited at this restaurant a total of 3 times in the past several months and I was never once disappointed. The service is outstanding and they will generally try to work with the customer to provide the best possible dining experience. One of the Prime's main selling point is that they feature dry aged beef that has been aged for over 30 days for the best possible flavor. They also have a varied selection of wines to compliment your dinner. \n\nPROS: An enjoyable and sophisticated atmosphere, excellent staff, and quality cuts of beef. \n\nCONS: The restaurant has a dress code posted requiring dinner jackets for men. However, that dress code is loosely enforced. I have seen some guests come in with a dress shirt and jeans. \n\nRestaurant Class: Lower-Upper \n\nFood: (4 out of 5 stars) The steaks are well prepared and cooked to order. And the dry aged ribeye do not disappoint. Any steak you order in this restaurant will be a quality cut of beef. The side dishes were also surprisingly good. They are also large enough to be shared. The only negative thing I noticed about the steaks was that it was a bit on the salty side for my palliate. But that can be easily remedied by ordering your steak with less salt or unsalted. \n\nAtmosphere: (4 out of 5 stars) If you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to have a romantic dinner, this restaurant is definitely for you. The atmosphere is relaxing yet vibrant enough to keep your attention; and the mood is sophisticated, yet subtle enough to have a little fun. Lastly, you can never go wrong with a window seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains. \n\nCleanliness: (4.5 out of 5 stars) The entire dining room is kept virtually spotless and comfortable. The tables are cleaned frequently with fresh linens and table cloths. \n\nService: (4 out of 5 stars) The staffs are all absolute professionals. They know their jobs and they know what the customer expects out of them. In fact, they are so detailed oriented that they will give the gentlemen wearing a dark suit a black linen instead of a white one. \n\nRestroom Facilities: (3.5 out of 5 stars) Despite this restaurant's location, it does have it's own facilities. And like the dinning room, the restrooms are kept relatively clean and well stocked. Additionally, the men's room also comes with complimentary amenities like lotion or hair cell."

I made a reservation the same day and since the restaurant overlooks the Bellagio Fountains, requested a seat with a view.

They knew their menu and wine choices and made our experience extremely enjoyable.  The food was tremendous and the sides were mouth watering.  It was a bit pricey but that's what you can expect from a Vegas steak house.  I'd certainly visit again next time we are in Vegas."

            "review": "Disappointing. I would recommend spending your hundreds of dollars elsewhere. Dinner started off well enough.  We were seated right away and our wine was brought promptly.  The salads were delicious as well as the soups. However when the main course came, my filet mignon wasn't seasoned at all.  Unseasoned to the point that I thought the chef just must have honestly forgotten or gotten distracted by something. I would have informed the waitress, but she never came to the table between the time our main course was served and when she brought the bill. She seemed annoyed when we then ordered a round of after dinner scotch.  After she then dropped the bill off for the second time, we never saw her again.  We waited at the table for her to come get our credit card. When after about 25 or 30 minutes she never came back, we found someone else to help us. Of course the hostess had stepped away for a moment which normally wouldn't be any issue, but it just added insult to injury having to try to spend so much money on such an unsatisfactory meal.  We were there at an off-peak time (very early dinner due to an engagement) and there were very few people in the restaurant, however I expected so much more.  We didn't want to spoil our evening by asking to see a manager and causing a commotion (we rarely complain so it was a little nerve-racking  to have to try so hard just to do so), plus we had an engagement we had to get to. We didn't feel welcome and I didn't even have a good steak at what as supposed to be an amazing steakhouse."

First and foremost, the food was incredible. After we shared the salmon sashimi as an appetizer, I had the seared tuna and my boyfriend had the filet mignon. Both were tender, juicy and just as we ordered. We also split the family-style side dishes, wild mushrooms and truffle mashed potatoes as sides. I insisted on the mashed potatoes after reading about how great they were on Yelp! and everyone was right - they were even better than anticipated. So creamy with a special 'bite' to them that I find impossible to describe. You really have to taste it to believe it. Drooling as I write... but I digress. Prime has an extensive wine list and the excellent staff even surprised us with a 'happy anniversary' free dessert of lava chocolate cake a la mode. Everything from the ambiance to the service to the food was perfect. The incredibly romantic view of the fountains at the Bellagio which went off frequently throughout our meal made the night even more memorable and special and the waiter didn't even complain when we asked him take a photo of us. We had a hard time getting reservations even calling a month out - we had to choose between 5:30 or 10 p.m. so I recommend making reservations as soon as you know you will be in Las Vegas and celebrating a special evening. This restaurant should be saved for special occasions though as it was a very pricey meal! But if you want to impress, this is the place to come."

Perfect in every way. My boyfriend comes here every time he goes to Vegas and reports they never have had an off day. I order the 8-oz fillet and asparagus and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were very creamy and the asparagus was asparagus. Really just speedbumps on my fantastic steak journey. Additionally they give you 4 sauces to have with your steak and I couldn't decide which was more delicious or if I just wanted to taste the fantastic steak on its own. Wow. Really. I am not a foodie but every bite I wanted to stop and savor. \n\nThe steak was so good I almost forgot the mention the appetizers. I had salmon sashimi that was extremely fresh delicious fish. I thought the sauce was a bit much. But it was a great price for great cuts of fish. Plentiful and expertly presented. My boyfriend got the crab cake and it was a single cake for $24. The taste was smooth and creamy, but for 1 cake I was a little disappointed for him and stuck to my salmon sashimi.\n\nFor the restaurant it is nice but not overly so. No pretentious feeling and a nice cozy place for a date. Decor is pleasant and chairs very comfortable. The wait staff was nice  and attentive but not disruptive."

I eventually decided to make an online reservation at Prime with a request to have a table with a view of the Bellagio Fountains. \n\nSo we get to the restaurant and noticed some available outside seating and it turned out that one of those seats outside right next to the water was ours! \n\nSo my girlfriend had the filet mignon and I had the 18oz bone-in prime rib. We decided to share the sides which were buttered mushrooms, creamed spinach, and garlic mashed potatoes along with some red wine. Let me tell you, the meal was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sides accompanied the meal well. The view of the fountains was so picturesque and there were speakers that played the music of the fountain show. It was a magical night.\n\nI think what made this night mostly memorable were the little things that made you feel like you were high-class. The host and server greeted us \"Happy Anniversary\". They even brought out a little lava flow cake for dessert with the words \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate syrup. They even had a professional photographer who took photos of us which we eventually bought 2 of them as souvenirs for our night.\n\nThe only thing of note is that this restaurant is not for the budget-conscious. A dinner for 2 can easily set you back a $200+ if you go all-out, but my girlfriend and I don't go out to eat at restaurants all the time and this was a special occasion so I didn't really flinch twice at the prices. We got what we paid for.\n\nGreat restaurant! Amazing steak. Highly-recommended for a romantic night! Will definitely go back again!"

The avg meal after tax/tip with a drink or appetizer should set you back about $150 per person at minimum, and once you add bottles of wine and the high end appetizers you're closer to $200-250+ per person to do it the right decadent way not holding back and just having a good time...

For my entree I ordered scallops and they were great! My husband shared a few bites of his ribeye with me and we both found it to be pretty bland. It was served with three sauces that I didn't try because a great steak shouldn't need a sauce. Our sides were macaroni and fries. The macaroni was delicious but the fries were just average everyday boring fries. Service was great. I understand that the restaurant is classy and upscale but I'm pretty sure this is one of the last few that doesn't allow shorts, nice shorts, not talking cutoffs or cargos here....but jeans are acceptable, strange to me. My poor husband had to borrow a pair of their pants which they have on hand because apparently it's a common issue and even stranger he had to walk through the entire restaurant in his shorts to get to the restroom to change. Seems pointless."

I HIGHLY recommend asking to sit on the patio when dining here.  It's an unforgettable experience.  \n\nI got my go-to steak which is the cajun bone-in ribeye. Theirs is dry-aged and cooked perfectly.  I ended up splitting mine with a buddy who made the horrid decision of going to a steakhouse and ordering the salmon (whoops), but still left full.  The menu offers a wide selection of cuts, including A-5 Wagyu at $45/ounce, and a huge selection of sides (truffle mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, Glazed Mushrooms) that round out your meal nicely. \n\nIf I'm in Vegas, I always make it a priority to visit this place."

If your visiting Las Vegas or looking to have a possible life alternating steak then this is the place. \n\nI'm usually on top of snapping a few photos of everyone dinner plate. However, it was a special night celebrating my brothers bday and I got so excited to try all the dishes, I forgot. I've been on a health kick lately so this was a cheat meal. I must say FAITHFULLY cheated. It was delicious!! My brother enjoyed his dinner, too. That was my biggest mission. He religiously and generously is a high profile high roller in the family who has been to all the top spots around town. So it's hard to server this man a good, GREAT steak. The server suggested a the old aged prime rib! In addition, they brought 3 different house steak sauces to our table. Generally, I never care for the extra sauces but I couldn't resist. You have to try all 3 of them. That's exactly what I got and exactly what I recommend. Any restaurant at the Bellagio is generally a hit. Plan accordingly and treat yourself! MY TASTEBUDS WERE IMPRESSED!!!\n\nLack of one star is the service! I felt like the nagging customer reminding them we needed a refill, we needed a dessert menu, we needed our bill, we needed our server. It was towards closing time so most of the staff were occupied cleaning the tables down. :("

            "review": "Ok first of all, this review isn't based on the quality of food, but on the experience I had with my friends and my girlfriend. \n      My girlfriend, our friends and I, had made reservations for tonight, about a month ago, at 8 pm (7/1/16) for my girlfriend's birthday. We came for dinner and were told that we would have to wait an hour to be seated outside as we requested, which was fine because we really wanted to see the view for our dinner. So we waited a little over an hour and were finally seated at 9:08 The server was polite and very professional when taking our orders. And the wait began.\n       So after waiting an hour to be seated, we had waited for over an hour with still no food. And let me remind you that this dinner was to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. So we were all hungry and anxious, waiting for our food and my girlfriend is getting upset. Our server who was very polite and apologetic, had to repeatedly go and check on our food. \n       After about an hour with no food except bread and water our server had came back to apologize another time and had told us that the manager would come speak to us about the horrendous wait time for our food. The so called \"manager\" came to our table to apologize. I had to give her a piece of mind to give her a sense of what we were going through. Waiting an hour to be seated and another hour with NO FOOD! And on my girlfriend's birthday too..  This \"manager\" INTERUPTS me MIDSENTENCE to explain to me why we had to wait an hour to be seated. I understand why it took so long to be seated, that's fine. I just wanted her understand how we felt having to wait for so long. But to interrupt me after I had to wait AN HOUR without FOOD, to give me the same \"your food will be right out\" response and excuses as to why the food was taking so long. I had told her that this was unacceptable and she tells me in this disrespectful tone \"What do you want me to do? Cancel the order? Bring out more bread?\" \n        First of all, if you have to ask the guest what you want her to do, then you should not be the manager.\n        Second, are you implying that you want me to cancel the order? Are you challenging me that I won't? The amount of disrespect was appalling. Why? Because we were a younger group of guest in their early 20s? That's another thing I noticed. This establishment seems to favor guests of an older crowd and seems to treat younger guests like children.  I felt like she was belittling me for voicing my opinion against this terrible experience. \n           Third, please don't offer me more bread when I've been waiting a whole hour for real food. It made me feel as though it would take even longer for the food to come out. \n            We ended up leaving the restaurant without eating dinner. Mainly because of how that manager was speaking to me. If this \"manager\" knew how to talk to a distraught guest, we would have given them our business. But this manager's disrespectful tone was the last straw. \n             I'm sure the food would have been delicious if it had gotten to us in time. I felt bad for our servers for being embarrassed do to a kitchen error. They were respectful and kind, but the manager was disrespectful despite her apologizing. \n             It's not the mistakes, but how they are corrected that matters. And this \"manager\" never learned that lesson."

            "review": "Let me begin by saying this is the most elegant steakhouse I've been to. ( Although CUT is my favorite steak wise ) It is beautifully situated on the lakeside level of the Bellagio hotel. We were seated right by the elegantly draped huge windows that overlook the Bellagio fountain show and smashing chocolate brown and light blue decor.  The posh surroundings are warm, welcoming and yes... romantic.  The staff was very courteous and very knowledgeable on their selections of wine and food.   Although there are many other notable restaurants to choose from at while in Vegas, we didn't want to be late to our cirque de soleil - O show so dining here seemed to be the most practical solution. On to the food..\n\nAPPETIZERS \n1. Shrimp cocktail  =  Succulent and delicious \n 2. Butter-Poached King Crab w/ apple-chive Salad & Brioche = How can you possibly go wrong here? Melt in your mouth sensation as soon as it touched a taste bud. The chucks of crab were huge which i would have expected for an almost $30 dollar appetizer. Hehe. Well worth the price.\n3. Caesar salad = Your typical Caesar salad with a little twist, the parmesan baked cone. So cheesy! \nMAIN COURSE\n1. Bone-in Rib Eye Steak 18 oz = We both opted for the same steak and unfortunately I was NOT impressed. The quality of the meat is honestly not worth mentioning.  It wasn't very juicy or marbleized as other steaks I have tried.  Very mediocre, which I was not expecting.. sadly.  I almost forgot to mention that there are three different sauces for the steak that are provided, but for good steak the sauce just gets in the way. Well at least, in my opinion. =)\n2. Bone-in Rib Eye Steak 18 oz\nSIDES\n1. Truffle mash potato = Ahhhh, SO GOOD.  I absolutely love anything that has truffle in it!  The flavor will explode in your mouth!  A definite must try for yourself!  \n2. Mac and Cheese = I tasted white cheddar here.  Rather tasty. \n3. Steamed asparagus = Perfectly seasoned, but wasn't cooked enough.\nOTHERS\n1. Grey hound = Refreshing and light. \n2. Red Zinfandel = Recommended by our server, GREAT! Not too acidic or dry. Went well with my steak.\n3. Red wine =  I forgot this one. \n\nOverall,  the atmosphere is close to perfection, but the food was very mediocre in taste with the exception of the Truffle mash potatoes and appetizers.  Although I was not impressed by the steak, I would return to try the seafood on their menu and the butter king crab again.  One thing I like about Prime is that they cater to their clientele. If something is not to your liking, they will do whatever they can to make sure you are pleased. The staff is exceptionally warm and personable too. Would return, but no steak for me! How ironic to say at a steakhouse.. \n\n1 out of 5. 5 being the highest\nFood - 3 , truffle mash potatoes gets a 4!\nAmbiance- 4\nService- 4\nPrice - Total with tip $308.00"

            "review": "By NO MEANS is this going to be a disappointing meal.The ambiance was outstanding. Anyone considering eating here, really should try it. Now, for starters, I am a local. When we go for steak dinner, we have ONE place that we always go to and it never fails. (God willing, it never will) The Golden Steer. For my dad's birthday, we wanted to do something different this year so we tried PRIME. While waiting for our table we sat at the bar. You can tell these guys have been working here for a while. They had a great attitude and had stories for days. When we were seated, we could't be happier. We sat in a small room to the right (most private area) and were right by the window on the water watching the fountains in full light. It was stunning. We started with the Seafood Tower. Magnificent. It was beautiful and of course delicious. Here is my complaint: they brought us a serving for three people, which there were three of us. But, if you have ordered a seafood platter before, it is not customary to serve per person because there is SO MUCH. Most places have offered to make it for a person or two less than what is in your party. Afterall, this is an appetizer. $67/person. I wish our server would have been a little more honest with us. This is something that will happen when you're on the strip. Some of the wait staff will try to take advantage of you. Especially when in fine dining and they are only going to turn their tables once or twice on a busy evening. So needless to say, we had way too big of an appetizer. \n\nFor entrees we ordered the Bone-In Ribeye, and two peppercorn NY Strips. $61 for the NY and I believe $70 for the Ribeye. We got sauteed mushrooms, creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes for the sides. We also ordered some bernaise for the steaks. Yeah yeah, so I like sauce with my steak. The steaks were great. Cooked perfectly as well. But, first world problem, it just didn't melt in our mouths. It was missing that perfect tender melt in your mouth feeling that just disappears with a couple of chews. There was just something missing. They did however have a really nice char on them that left a crispy crust. The mashed potatoes though. My god. It was like a pot of melted butter. You had to eat them with a spoon. They were the best I have ever had. The sauteed mushrooms were great too. It is a wild mushroom blend fyi. The creamed spinach was okay. Nothing to write home about.\n\nTotal Bill: $544 (Tip not included.) We left a $100 tip. So this was a little over $200/person. \n\nI am very happy I went. It was a memorable dinner filled with good company, lots of alcohol, and some professional pictures taken by their house photographer. (Completely unnecessary but we were drunk by this point) So if you are considering going to PRIME while you're visiting in town, do it. I am sure you won't be disappointed."

            "review": "In the interest of full disclosure, dinner was hosted by someone who has been here before, has the means to make dinner phenomenal and even had a favorite server (Russell).\n\nWe started off the evening with a GIGANTIC seafood plateau with lobster, rock crab claws, king crab legs, oysters, huge prawns and a trio of delicious sauces.  Our server did us a service and suggested we ordered the plateau for four people even though we had five.  This appetizer alone filled me up half-way!!  Everything was super fresh and sweet.\n\nThat evening, Prime was featuring Tasmanian lobster tails.  You can add it to your dish as a \"surf and turf\" option, have it as an entree or order one for the table.  Our host went with one for the table and let me tell you...never in my life had I seen such a gargantuan lobster tail.  It was probably a foot long and 10 inches around.  It was presented, carved up and served to us with plenty left for the middle of the table.  Sweetest lobster I've ever had.  The flesh was firm yet tender (indescribeable).  No drawn butter necesary!\n\nSo Prime's thing is steak.  I went with our host's suggestion for the 5-peppercorn New York strip.  I'm really glad I did!  The flavor was bold and delicious.  It's what I like to call \"fancy steak\".  I had a few bites of our host's filet and that was melt-in-your-mouth delicious as well.  They give you three sauces to go with your steak and we ignored them all.\nFor sides, we had their spicy mac and cheese, truffle mashed potatoes (DROOL...I could have had the whole thing on my own), sauteed mushrooms, and specially ordered caramelized onions.  All were great sides.\n\nAlas, due to the giantness of our appetizer, I had to give up trying to finish my steak.  Meanwhile, my husband had no problems finishing his porterhouse.\n\nWe were contemplating dessert when someone let slip to our server that it was hubby and my wedding anniversary.  The dessert menus were respectfully plucked out of our hands and in short order, their signature chocolate lava cake was brought out to us, served with a delicious home made caramel ice cream.  They wrote Happy Anniversary on the platter which made it all the more special. \n\nPrime has a great wine list of which I did not get to see.  However, the wines we had were delicious.  I brought the first two bottles (Kamen, CS, 2005) which opened up beautifully.  (NOTE: Their corkage fee is $35 but their policy is that they will only allow it if the wine is not already on their list).  Second was a D.R. Stephens CS 2005 and finally, the crowning glory, the Penfolds Grange 2001 (?).  I was in expensive wine heaven.  If wine tasted like this at a reasonable price, I'd have to have Al Anon on speed dial!\n\nOur evening was fantastic.  Service was perfect.  It felt like we had an army of people waiting on us and constantly bringing us more water, constantly pouring us more wine.  Our server was almost embarassed that he caught our host pouring his own water and ran right over to take the bottle from him.  The best part was service was friendly, humorous and not at all snooty like a lot of fancy places.\n\nThis was definitely an experience to remember, even if I did stumble a little on the way out.  Just a little!!"

            "review": "Let's just start by saying that Vegas has become an over-priced, over-hyped, self-indulgent toilet of a town, if it wasn't already.  Second, I have never enjoyed any meal I have gotten in Vegas, nor has it been worth the price or crappy service that accompanied it.  Letting that color my view of \"fine\" (and I say that with a grain of salt) Vegas dining, it could be hard for me to put that out of my head.  I had recently eaten at Brand in the Monte Carlo.  So I had a feeling of what was to come.  Let's start with bartenders at the entrance of Prime.  Complete jerks.  Just because I am in my early/mid-20's doesn't mean I am poor or not going to spend beau-coup dollars.  The food is horribly overpriced, but when you are trying to cultivate a \"superior,\" asshole feel to your restaurant, that's okay.  The problem is Las Vegas is miles from any reasonable agricultural area or the ocean.  That raises some flags for me.  Maybe that is why it cost more to eat there, but when you look at craigslist for jobs and homes, you see that cost of living is not insane in the Vegas area, so maybe I can just chalk it up as a \"tourist trap.\"\nThe food was actually okay.  I got a lamb dish that was small, but reasonably cooked and came with a tasty mint sauce.  I also got a side of mac and cheese which was decadent beyond all belief but relatively standard for such an easy dish.  We split one bottle of wine for  our group because the prices were psychotic.  While the list was very voluminous, it wasn't worth paying for half the bottles on there since you were paying well over 150% over store retail.  I have a problem with this restaurant because it is no different from every other crap offering that every casino in Vegas has.\nThe service was average, but our waiter was clearly perturbed with the average age of our table.  We tipped well anyways but we felt like he made a thinly veiled comment regarding our ability to pay and the possibility of us ditching the bill.  That cost him $20 as we left since one of our party, who works in restaurants, had said he never heard such a comment."

The problem was all we did was wait - 20 minutes for water, 60 minutes for bread, and we had to ask twice to order wine and our food...you get the picture.  \n\nAfter over an hour had gone by and we still did not have our appetizers - one french onion soup and one Caesar salad - my sister and I finally went into the restaurant and asked to speak with the manager.  After briefly explaining the situation to the manager, he informed us he would \"look into it.\"  As we returned to our table, we found that our appetizers had finally made it.  The french onion soup had good flavor but was really greasy.  The Caesar salad was extremely bland.  \n\nAs we were taking our first bites of the appetizers, we saw the manager pop his head out on the balcony and presumed that he was coming to speak to us.  Instead, he never came back.  At this point, we were all happy to have a bit of food and prepared to sit back, relax and enjoy the entrees with our wine.\n\nAgain, we were disappointed as the entrees took much longer than expected to arrive.  When they finally did arrive, we were surprised to find that the food was pretty terrible.  The salmon was woefully undercooked (more than raw in the middle). The sea bass was far overcooked, chewy and fishy.   The seared tuna appeared to be covered in some sort of batter and flash fried.  The chicken entree was just blah.  Though we were starving, not a one of us came close to finishing our meal. \n\nGiven the disappointing service and food, we asked to speak with the manager again.  When he approached our table, I asked why he had never spoken to us the first time - he mentioned that he saw we had a our starters and thought everything was fine.  After listening to our complaints on the food, he gave us a couple of excuses that really made no sense (it's a big restaurant, the patio is more relaxed).  \n\nAfter confirming that our experience was sub-par, he then asked what we would like him to do about of experience.  We instead asked him what he thought he should do and suggested that the restaurant at least consider correcting the bill a bit given the poor quality of the food.  We were pleasantly surprised when he returned with the bill for the wine, soup and salad only - all of the entrees had been removed.   \n\nWe enjoy fine dining and thought that we had been so lucky to get into Prime - unfortunately, our night was almost ruined by this experience.  I would prefer to give this restaurant no stars because everything was just so terrible from the food to the service to the manager's response.  However, I to give the restaurant credit for two things - the manager properly adjusted the bill so that we did not feel like we had been robbed and the atmosphere is quite lovely.  Would I go back? No, but if you decide to go, stick with a couple of drinks and a fun appetizer or two and then move on to a restaurant with more consistent food."

He stated that he didn't want to complain, but he was not happy at all that he couldn't even eat his steak. We brought it up to the waiter, which offered to bring out another one. My boyfriend declined since he had a little bit of it, and was not about to try to start eating another one. \n\nWith that said, I loved the food. Pricey, but I was prepared to spend $$$$.

My job was to secure the hotel and pick which buffets we were to eat at (we purchases the $45 for 24 hours of buffets pass) and my sister's job was to pick one nice spot for dinner. That was how we ended up at Prime Steakhouse in Bellagio.\n\nThe food was amazing. This was what we ordered:\n\n- Prime onion soup with gruyere cheese = absolutely divine. What's not to like about anything gruyere.\n- Filet Mignon with shishito peppers. I had it medium rare because that's how I like mine to be done = melted in my mouth. Lightly seasoned but was very tasty and so tender.\n- Peppercorn New York steak (this was what the bride ordered). Done medium rare. I had a taste and it was so good. Nice and meaty and lots of flavor.\n- Caramelized scallops = so good! It has a slight sweet kick but also very savory. The scallops filled you up because they were huge.  \n- Some of the sides we ordered were the summer corn, creamed spinach and truffle mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. All were superb! Well-made and delicious!\n\nWe made reservations and got there right on the dot. We were immediately greeted and seated right away. Our server and all the workers were very attentive throughout the whole dinner, refilling our water glass, making sure our cocktails tasted right, brushing the bread crumbs off our table, etc. Since it was a bachelorette party dinner, there was also a photographer that was there and took pictures of our party. She had it all printed on glossy paper and framed for us by the end of dinner and asked if we wanted to purchase any. We bought two for the bride as a memorable gift.\n\nThe restaurant was very clean and the set-up was done well. I couldn't get over how beautiful the restroom was! I could literally live in there! lol.\n\nPrime Steakhouse did me well! I was very satisfied by the quality of the food and staff. \n\nThere are so many good places to eat in Vegas and I'm on a mission to try them all so I probably won't be back to Prime anytime soon. But I highly recommend it! Try it out, pure Vegas experience alright!"

All of our steaks were cooked to \"almost\" perfection.  I say almost because for a few of us, we ordered our steaks medium and we got medium rare.  No big deal & I can only imagine how hard it is to get a steak to be that perfectly cooked between med.rare and medium so no deduction in rating for that.\n\nOur orders ranged from Filet Mignon (with bone attached) cuts to the traditional Rib Eye.  Sides included cream corn, caesar salad, stuffed potato, crispy potatoes, truffle mashed potatoes and onion soup.  ALL of it was superbly made.  We cannot say enough about the cream corn and truffle mashed potatoes.  The food was impeccable and the service was top notch.  One of the guys on the table has dogs so we asked for the bones to be placed in a box after our meal.  The server did one better and scooped more bones from the kitchen (that they were going to discard anyways) and packed it along with ours.  Totally cool....the dogs will be eating in heaven I tell you.\n\nWord of warning though.....the extra condiments for your stuffed potato (sour cream, chives, bacon, cheese) are ala carte.  The water served to your table is priced per bottle.  Yup, water is not free.  And soda refills are also not free.  The soda refill charge was no real surprise to me....but the charge for the water & the condiments for the stuffed potato were, so consider yourself warned.  :)\n\nAll in all, the dinner was excellent and the restaurant is a great place to impress that special lady in your life.  The food is prepared top-notch and the service is second to none.  Will we ever go there again?  That is a definite YES.....though I might not drink so much water next time.  :)"

We ate until we couldn't anymore.\n\nMy first visit here was spring break in college and my roommate who had not eaten steak in years (he went veg for a while) decided he would break down and try it since we were in such a highly regarded steakhouse.\n\nHe loved it and raves about it to this day.

Grading on a curve, using other top-end steakhouses as a reference, I would give it two stars.\n\nThe food was good, but not great.  The small lobster tail in my $100+ (DANG!) surf and turf was overcooked.  I've never sent anything back at a nice restaurant before and I rarely send anything back period, but that had to be resolved.  Staff was cool about it and handled it perfectly.\n\nService was good, but not amazing.  Our waiter was nice enough, but was not allowed to taste the bottle of wine that we brought, which was kind of a drag.  We never even smelled the somalier.  Where the eff was (s)he?\n\nFinally, as we finished dinner and the wildly overpriced Chteau DY'quem, we were asked to move out to the frikken patio!  The restaurant was nowhere near full.  \n\nTurns out, however, that last half an hour after dinner was the highlight of the meal:  we got to enjoy the water show, finish our wine and cast occasional glances at TV's own Tom Selleck sitting nearby.\n\nUnlike meals that I have had at other fine establishments, looking back, nothing about Prime (other than the patio scene) stands out to me.\n\nHere's the thing:  when dropping major coin of this sort, I expect to be dazzled.  Good does not cut it.  Prime just didn't dazzle me."

An entirely mediocre experience at Olive and last night Jean-George's troops were struggling for mediocrity.\n\nUpon making reservations, we were alerted to the dress code. Jackets required. I dressed well and upon arriving a large portion of the clientele was jacketless...some downright funky. If you're going to state the rules, stick with them.\n\nUpon being seated in the beautiful surroundings we were offered menus and the wine list. The wine selection was broad and deep. The markups were also broad and deep. I know many of the wines represented and they were unreasonably priced. Silly. A glass of Veuve Cliquot was considerably more than what I'd pay for a bottle. \n\nThe food....well, it was mixed. The bread was awesome. The sourdough was excellent but the pretzel bread was the real winner. We each got a piece. When I asked for another I was told they were running low and there would be no more pretzel bread for us. That was really too bad because it was the best thing on the table all evening. It was that good. I began with a salad...Heirloom Tomatoes, Burrata Cheese, Mussini Balsamic & Basil. The tomatoes were purple...a bit firm but OK. The dish was, well, ok. Kinda bland but passable. I had a steak waiting for me, right?\n\nUnfortunately, yes. A Peppercorn New York Steak with Red Onion Compote. The compote was good. The steak was very tough. Cooked to a good medium rare, it was stringy and hard to eat. I ate less than half of it. Too much work. My guest is lactose intolerant which means no butter. The kitchen could not see it's way to prepare the carrots without butter. Same with the Brussels Sprouts. Maybe if we knew Jean-Georges Vongerichten...the enfant terrible of the food scene. Ah well. \n\nI wonder if Jean-Georges has ever been in Las Vegas. Nonetheless, I'd advise to wander across the hall to Picasso or head off to the Palms to visit Alize. Now they know what they're doing.\n\n1.5 stars."

It's a very classy place and while there is no jacket required, you really should plan to dress appropriately.\n\nAs you might expect, it has wonderful ambiance and upper echelon service. The steaks are aged well and cooked to perfection. If you want surf and turf, you may have to ask for it because it's not on the menu. Usually the server will inform you though that they do offer it and quote you a price. \n\nMy buddy and I had a fantastic meal here and would definitely go back. I got a kick out of the waiter's reaction when I asked for ketchup to go with my fries. He said half jokingly, \"Here we don't call it ketchup; we call it \"sauce internationale.\" I thought that was hilarious."

Service was attentive, but our server actually argued with us a bit over whether or not there was lactose in one of the dishes. He brought out an ingredient list to prove his point. Bad form. Thankfully, the food overpowered the service... when steaks are that good, the service isn't enough to take away from my 5-star rating."

I don't think this can be trained, and believe it is the servers' experience and intuition after many years in the industry. \n\nOn to the food... Standouts: \n\nFoie Gras - if you love Foie, you will love theirs. Perfectly seared and flavored, with nice acidity on the plate to complement. \n\nCarpaccio and Tartare duo - This is the best of both worlds. When I see Carpaccio and Tartare on the menu, I usually have an inner battle on which one to choose. Well Prime must have thought of this too and decided, why not put both on a plate! The tartare and carpaccio are fresh and the presentation is beautiful with the latticed cream (but side note, a bit too saucy for me and I would ask for less sauce or on the side next time). \n\nSea Bass entree - It's not a petite piece! It is a large piece of fish and cooked well. \n\nTruffled Mash - Buttery with bits of Black Truffle folded in and garnished on top!  \n\nNext time I will be back for the Dover Sole as (I was told) they de-bone right in front of you. \n\nAll in all if you are looking for fine dining and great food, Prime is solid.\n\nI will be back and will probably bring the family when they are in town again."

Mine was not the only beverage he forgot on more than one occasion.\n\nOur table of eight ordered the shell fish appetizer, which cost around four hundred dollars. The crab, shrimp and oysters were good but the lobster was awful. It was chewy and flavorless. \nSeriously about an hour after we had our appetizer our main courses come out. Our table ordered everything from the duck, to sea bass to stake, no one was that thrilled. The food was mediocre, defiantly not worth the price. \n\nThe kicker to the entire night was \"dress code\". \nThey are suppose to enforce a dressy attire and yet I saw guys in Affliction shirts and girls in jean skirts. \n\nMoral of the story, save you money and eat at one of the other amazing restaurants in the Bellagio."

Followed by the peppercorn crusted NY strip for me and the bone in filet special for my girlfriend. Both steaks were aged well and flavorful. I have never been a fan of doucing my steak in sauce. However, I have to admit that the miso mustrad was a nice compliment to the steak. Truffle mash was a perfect side. The surprising highlight of the evening was that they has a mille crepe on their menu for dessert. The only time I have had a good rendition of this dessert outside Paris was at Lady M in NYC. Prime's Version gets an A+ from me. Perfectly textured crepes stacked with a layer of cream in between. \n\nThe big downer of the evening was the impersonal service. While our waiter was attentive and we were checked on by couple other people over the course of the evening. It just seemed like no one really cared. This might be a contrast to our luxurious experience at Twist the previous night. \n\nI have to take away some points for service. Although, I think I may not be the only one that thinks so.

I went on Yelp! and trusted my fellow Yelpers with over 400 reviews and 4 stars. Made reservations through open table for 7 people at 9:30 after our jabbawockeez show. My friend told me they closed at 10, but they still took my reservations so we were fine.\n\nWe made it to the restaurant a little before 9:30, I went up to the hostess that we were there, we didn't get seated right away. Probably took 15 minutes or so to get seated, not sure why when I had made reservations, tables were vacant and it was close to closing so they weren't busy! We finally got seated and several of my friends noticed our waiter was \"sassy\"!\n\nFood:\n* Filet Mingon ($66) medium rare. I ended up getting a steak, well duh! Something you should order at a steakhouse, haha! My steak was perfectly cooked and all 3 sauce that they gave me were delish that I couldn't choose which one was my favorite! \n\n*truffle mashed potatoes, they were yummy!! I totally recommend!\n\nService: \nOur waiter had a stupid, awkward, sarcastic, rude, dry personality! Since the moment we sat down half my party were annoyed by him. My friend asked where the restroom was and pointed one side and when she was getting up he told her something else. Towards the end, the waiter came up he asked if we wanted dessert. We said no thank you and he stayed saying \"talk to me\" leaving us in an awkward situation as if he would not leave until we ordered. Not only did we have a problem with our waiter but the other two waiters cleaning the table next to us were very unprofessional. They are cracking inappropriate jokes to each other that it made me feel like I was eating in a \"ghetto\" steakhouse; they were obnoxiously loud. One of the waiters continued to crack jokes across the table while he refilled our glasses with water. We would say thank you, and normally we get a \"my pleasure\" but nothing from the waiters here. A friend of mine asked for a to go box for her food, the waiter brought back her food in a to go box and said \"here's your doggy, I mean your food.\" They were such jerks! We felt treated like dirt as if we weren't paying customers!\n\n I've been to several steakhouses in California and service was always superior, always exceeded my expectations. The food was good but it does not outweigh the terrible service we received. \n\nWhen my friend went to the restroom, the lady was cleaning the stall but told my friend to use it and she will clean it after. My friend said she'd wait for the other stall...obviously she didn't want to clean it twice. As an employee, you should treat your customers as if you just opened. Just because you're about to close the restaurant, doesn't mean you should rush your customers out of the restaurant or act inappropriate. \n\nThis dinner was for my \"golden bday\" (28th bday on the 28th) and it ruined all of our nights with the service. I don't recommend anyone coming to this place, especially if you care about customer service. The employees here act like they're in high school, very unprofessional and immature!"

We were celebrating a friend's birthday and ordered a variety of steaks/dishes. I really liked the updated version of the Caesar salad. I also thought the sides were spectacular this time around. The onion rings, mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and mushrooms were all fantastic. The steak was just as I remembered, especially the miso one. I really appreciate them getting back to me about my first experience, and would happily recommend Prime to family and friends in the future."

But here you really get what you pay for.  Steak was excellent (had the Peppercorn New York Steak, mid-rare).  Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.  Wine selection follows the theme of being pricey, but the server had good pairing recommendations that tied the meal together nicely.  Our table shared a few sides (asparagus, broccoli, and the mashed potatoes) all of which were excellent.  If you are in the market for a $100-$120 per person Steakhouse meal in Las Vegas, then I would highly recommend Prime.  I would definitely return on my next visit, unless the casino gods dictate that I take a more thrifty approach."

We got to sit front row at the Bellagio Fountains! Unfortunately it was too hot outside, otherwise we might have enjoyed the accompanying music also.\n\nThe first bite of everything was super delicious, in fact, I was assured that I had made the right decision on the location. It certainly had a lot of accolades on the website, highly acclaimed and even won 2014 Open Table's award. Bravo! It was love at first bite, and then, sadly, towards the end and 5 glasses of water later, not so much.\n\nThe steak was carted in with three signature sauces. I was rather glad they didn't make you choose on the spot and instead, left three small gravy boats for you to try them. Unfortunately the steak was just fine on its own, and the sauce wasn't entirely necessary. Though conclusively we decided that if you need sauce on a steak then something else entirely is prohibiting your experience...\n\nThe lamb chops were so divine at first bite, but through it all, about 40% ended up being lamb fat instead of lamb chops, and well, it just couldn't justify the amount spent on the entree. The sauce was overly salted, and thus ended up drinking 5 glasses by the conclusion of the evening. Pretty strange considering there were only three chops.\n\nThe sides however were less disappointing, I absolutely loved (and subsequently murdered) the entire ramekin of truffle mash. I highly recommend this even though the entrees themselves seemed lacking. The peas were also divine. A bit cheating with the bacon, but well put together. It was, however, a tad hard to eat due to the different shapes of peas...\n\nWell, besides the truffle mash potatoes, the birthday dessert was divine. They had just made the lava cake and it was perfectly rich without being too sweet. The ice cream was a prefect touch. Very tasty.\n\nTop items: Service, Truffle Mash, Free Dessert.\n\nNeedless to say, won't be back. Sure, maybe we ordered the wrong items, but just so you know, a restaurant shouldn't make bad items choices on the menu. Haha."

The view was amazing, the restaurant's decor was extremely elegant with a modern touch and the ambiance was superb. My dining experience here was amazing and let me tell you why... \n\n1.) Appetizers set the bar super high for the coming meal\nFor those who love raw stuff-\n*We started with two large Seafood Platters. Served in an elegant setting that had the oysters, lobster, crab, prawns, mussel and clams over ice. Underneath the setting was another bowl that was conveniently placed (yet still hidden) for the shells. Everything in the seafood platter was extremely fresh and of great quality. I'm usually not a fan of oysters but these oysters were to die for. Alongside the sauces which include: cocktail, horseradish, and vinegar, *dont forget to ask your waiter for melted butter and Tabasco* best and most fresh seafood platter I have ever indulged in!\n*The Steak Tartare and Carpaccio was another great choice that we started our meal. Served with Tarragon Aioli and Grilled Crostini, I highly recommend this especially if you are drinking wine.\n\n2.) I think the Steaks are made in heaven\n*The filet Mignon, medium rare, melts in your mouth. The steak cut so easily and was tenderly moist. It was perfectly seasoned and charred on the outside but exactly medium rare on the inside just how I like and wanted. It was served with a zesty roasted green chili, perfect to change up your palate.\n*The bone in rib eye steak was just as tasty! Seasoned more than the filet Mignon and a little more \"fatty\" I would recommend this for those who like their steaks more flavorful. This too melted in my mouth!\n\n3.) The sides are small and properly portioned \n*The glazed market mushrooms and truffle mashed potatoes were my favorite but I also was able to taste the creamed spinach and steamed asparagus. The mushrooms and mashed potatoes are a must order! I'm just glad they we're small portions or else I would've eaten all the sides and wouldn't have room for the main course! \n\n4.) The service was amazing!\n*i wish I remembered our waiters name but he was awesome, I wish I could give him credit. After a couple of martinis, I forgot to ask. He was attentive, personable and funny. The dining experience definitely would not be the same without him and the incredible staff."

But because it was a holiday, reservation by the patio/windows were all full. :( So reserve ahead of time during the holidays!\n\nFOOD:\nWe ordered filet mignons, short ribs ($41.00), and their Chilean Sea Bass ($45.00) with a side order of Ginger Sweet Potatoes, Jumbo Asparagus, and Butternut Squash Soup. I would stick with the Filet Mignon ($67.00), definitely their specialty. It was soooo good. The meat just melted in my mouth, it also came with three different sauces to complement the meat, but I prefer mine plain. The cut was perfect, no tendon was to be found, and the quality was absolutely perfect! My grandmother also really liked their sea bass, said it was cooked perfectly and she absolutely loved her Butternut Squash Soup. Their Asparagus and Sweet Potato Mash are highly recommended, both very good quality and light side dishes to pair with the steaks. The short rib was okay, while the meat was very tender and juicy, the enormous amount of heavy sauce just ruined the dish for me. We also got a basket of bread as appetizers! The raisin bread was highlight of the basket. :)\n\nSERVICE:\nOur waiter was just terrific, he was very personable and knew how to talk and draw his customers in. He made a lot of great recommendations and was also making sure we got what we needed including all allergies and special diet restrictions. The food could take a while, but they provide bread as you wait.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThey do have a dress code that they enforce- business causal is more like business formal. All the men were in clean-cut suits and the women in nice dresses and heels. The lighting is dim and very classy, it's a quiet place that don't allow kids under 6 years old to dine in. Although from looking around, no kids seemed to be around the restaurant.\n\nLastly, they have complimentary self-parking for Bellagio if you're dining in!"

I remember the oysters melting in my mouth as I squeezed a lemon on top and slurped each one into my mouth! I ordered the fillet mignon and my fiance ordered the rib-eye.  The fillet mignon was great; grilled exactly how I liked it -- medium rare.  I personally enjoyed the rib-eye only because the cut was more tender.  We were told the meat has been aged for a period of time which indeed brought out the flavor in the beef. Can't wait to go back to this place the next time we visit! \n\nThe service was phenomenal; waiters are well attentive to your needs. They are very personal & are consistently checking up on you making sure the food is tasting great. We got a lakeside view next to the window, so we got the chance to see the water show in front of the Bellagio nemerous of times. It's much more pleasurable to watch from the inside of the restaurant rather than standing with the crowd of tourists outside. I enjoyed the romantic ambiance of the restaurant... quiet, dimmed lights and tables covered in white table cloths with candles lit on the table. There was a photographer that came around each table to take pictures; she even showed us how to pose for the camera. But unfortunately we left too soon before she was able to come back to our table. We were given two complimentary guest passes two the Bank night club as well at the end of our dinner.  \n\nIf you're a steak-lover, this place is a must try!"

            "review": "The drone of hopeful millionaires waned as the six of us dipped into the paneled honeycomb of Bellagio's steakhouse, Prime. We had drifted away from the hoots and hollers of night owls and seemingly onto the set of a high budget film that hadn't decided whether its focus was Old Hollywood, Gone with the Wind or French Victorian. Blue, velvet drapes careened from ceiling to floor, busting from a girdle of gold chords that could easily fashion Scarlett's next dress. Fountains flitted outside the window like children intent on a game of tag and added just enough Disneyland amusement to complete this abstract portrait. \n\nDespite swiveled heads and rubber necks, we arrived at our table unscathed and dwarfed by an immense painting resembling Venus's sister (staring wide-eyed at our plates to ensure we ate all our vegetables). An ocean of carpet, thick enough to swallow any signs of dropped silverware, necessitated \"Alice in Wonderland-like\" gold knockers on the back of each chair for easy towing. \n\nAuditioning for the stereotypical role of \"Jeeves\", our waiter ascended with a raised nostril of disgust (Scene 1: sniffing dirty sweat sock) and upon ordering drinks (Scene 2: serving a stiff cocktail of contention), one of my culinary colleagues murmured, \"I feel like the waiter thinks he's better than me.\" \n\nWe laughed, but the apparent exasperation wasn't funny. Jeeves's superiority was stifling from the first wrinkle of his nose to his wafting stench of arrogance, and not only did it lessen our experience, but lowered the overall standard of the restaurant. A true upscale establishment ensures the customer's comfort at all costs and Jeeves couldn't even spare a dime.\n\nOur annoyance was overridden by a dining cart bearing silver orbs of secrecy, each cover lifted and replaced in the edible version of \"find the queen\". My fork first tore at symbiotic landmarks of top grade tuna and avocado wading in ginger/ soy with its light, rejuvenating effects similar to a Fountain of Youth (for the palate). The salad set posed an ordinary looking Caesar like a diminutive wallflower, but beneath his classic cover laid a defined body and final punch of citrus that lifted his status to \"crowd pleaser Caesar\". \n\nUnfortunately, the crispy goat cheese fondue did not rival Caesar for top billing and was a disappointment in concept and taste. This tomb of fondue bandaged goat cheese (head to toe) in a fried, phyllo sarcophagus that trapped the necessary tart-n-creamy catalyst. \"The curse of teeth rotting sweetness\" attacked an unassuming frisee salad with grapes and pear vinaigrette (its pungent antidote only inches away).\n\nThe \"meat and greet\" came next with the promise of the protein packed main course that had led us here. My lamb chops, encrusted with chili crumbs, were ordered at medium rare, but arrived closer to rare. Still delectable, I ravaged them, dipping sporadically in the bevy of sauces accompanying the meal (barnaise, spicy pepper, etc.) The steak au poivre was paved with a thick asphalt of peppercorns (not a pothole of naked meat to be seen) with a potency that could remove tar. The tearing and coughing induced by this dish might be used as protection in a dark alley- the original pepper spray. \n\nTwo of our other carnivorous constituents ordered the porterhouse- one requesting medium rare and the other medium. A couple bites into the meal, the medium rare \"requestee\" found himself in the middle of medium man's steak. Medium man had already manhandled the \"mis-steak\" placed before him (cooked almost exactly like the other) and munched happily on what he thought to be his order. This was inexcusable- not only did these prices demand perfection (around $50 a steak), but the moniker of \"steakhouse\" insists on the chefs' aptitude for mastering meat temperatures. This was a blunder that couldn't be overlooked as easily as Jeeves's snippy quips and would be the resounding memory of the meal (though thoughts of their lumpy, heavily salted mashed potatoes would be reminisced of fondly).\n\nI could now empathize with Dr. Malfi's attraction to Tony Soprano. I was immediately enamored with this piece of work's over-the-top and muddled alter egos, but inconsistency and a mafia sized payoff eventually marred my fond feelings. As Prime puckered for its \"kiss of death\" in my final farewell, I still admired its larger than life character, but couldn't trust Prime's rep enough to invest that type of dough."

My steak was just okay, cooked perfectly but a little light on flavor, however the sauce (soy, rice wine vinegar, etc.?) was amazing.  I wanted to bathe in it.\n\nThe place is definitely upscale, and though we weren't dressed like slobs, we were clearly underdressed a bit, which may have accounted for the very average and not overly attentive service.  Maybe they thought we couldn't afford the place, but the service was decidedly average.  The waiter was nice, but didn't seem to take much time at our table to make suggestions, explain the menu or stop by to make sure we were doing okay.  Considering I spent $250+ on my portion alone, I would have expected that to be elite as well.\n\nStill, like I said before, food rules the day ultimately at restaurants and in that regard it was amazing.\n\nI would suggest a sport coat for guys at the least and not just a buttoned-up shirt or nice sweater like we had on, as most parties seemed a little more dressed up.

It seemed like 1 1/2 small round tomatoes.  Could I at least get the other half of the second tomato for that price? Fresh cheese and the seabass's sauce was tasty.

When I arrived, I was seated at a great table close to the window where I could see the Bellagio Fountain Show in the background.  After I ordered my Whiskey, I had a chance to truly appreciate the beauty of this restaurant.  The decor is very upscale, romantic and very ornate.  A great place for a power business dinner or a date.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Butternut Squash Soup, Bone-in Rib-eye Steak, Potato Gnocchi and their Banana Tart for desert.\n\nMy entire meal was amazing.  Each dish was perfectly prepared and super yummy!  \nIf you want a great steak dinner in one of Las Vegas' most romantic places, come to the Prime!\n\nThe food, fountain show and sexy decor rocks!!"

            "review": "When you pay PRIME prices you expect PRIME service and PRIME food. This was at least our fifth visit to PRIME and very likely our last.\n\nWe have celebrated birthdays and anniversaries at PRIME and on December 23, 2010 were looking for a quiet getaway and a splurge on dinner with perfect service as we had enjoyed in the past. We arrived at our reservation time. Our prior request for a table by the window was not honored but it was a nice table and we were happy when we were seated. In all past visits I would have given PRIME a five star rating. We ordered drinks and appetizers. We soon noticed that the highly attentive, though not imposing service we have come to love and expect at PRIME was not present. Drinks took over 10 minutes and bread took 20. The shrimp cocktail was amazing as usual, keeping in mind that 4 shrimp for $20 ought to be amazing. \n\nWe each ordered the Baby Iceberg Lettuce with Crispy Bacon & Maytag Bleu Cheese Dressing. This was served about 30 minutes into our visit. (By then my husband was ready for another drink and started trying to catch someone's eye to request one. Our waiter was occupied with the table of 5 seated next to us. Finally my husband asked someone else for another drink. It took at least 15-20 more minutes for the drink to arrive and the person who brought it was not our waiter and not until after we had complained to the manager.) For $18 each you might expect some interesting salad presentation. I enjoyed eating the salad but not the fact that I had to cut the lettuce myself. It looked like they had just cut a center slice of the baby lettuce head and plopped it on a plate. My husband thought the salad was too rich as there were blue cheese chunks and heavy blue cheese dressing along with very thick bacon. \n\nFor the main course we each ordered the small filet mignon $44 for 8oz. These don't come with any side dishes so we also ordered sides of potatoes and mushrooms to share. We had been there about an hour by now and my drink was empty, our waters were empty and our waiter was now taking an order at a third table. I asked a staff member passing by if I could please speak to a manager. The General Manager came right to our table. I told her we were sad that the service was so poor and that our waiter seemed not to have time for us. My husband still did not have the second drink. The Manager was extremely polite and said she was very sorry and that she would take care of things. This did get things going -- though we did not like to have to complain to get decent service. My husband's second drink came a minute after she walked away. Then the filet were served but again not by our waiter. I suspect they had been sitting \"up\" for a while. The filet were cold to the touch but each had two small charred green chili peppers sizzling next to them. The charred pepper smell was overpowering to the point that it hit the sinus right as they lifted off the silver cover.  Within that same minute sides were delivered. We got the mushrooms but instead of potatoes, we got creamed spinach. \n\nThat was it. The dinner we had been looking forward to for months was ruined. Since neither of us like hot peppers or spinach, we decided to leave. I asked for the manager again and told her that we needed to leave as the wrong side and hot peppers along with the poor service had ruined our dinner. I asked her to please charge what we had eaten up to that point to our room, but she declined to do so. She was very empathetic and offered to reseat us and start over or send whatever we wanted back to our room. This was a kind offer but we were just not up for either as our experience was ruined. By then it was around 9pm and we were just tired of trying to beg for service in what is supposed to be a four star place. \n\nAfter many good dinners and fond memories of the exceptionally fine service, superior food and decor as well as the beautiful view of the fountains, I don't think we will go back. This awful experience has ruined it for us. Given that this hotel opened in 1998, we both wondered whether the waiters we had so very much enjoyed in prior visits had moved on to newer places or were just not working."

I spoke to a resident the other night who was in tears because she does not know how to communicate her concerns to someone other than the management team that is on site. In speaking with our neighbors there appears to be more of us who have valid issues and feel like we have been bullied and have no recourse except to move.\n\nWell for a brand new tenant like myself, moving out of a place that I want to live because of the way I am being treated is not a good option for me. We are not asking for anything but transparency and respect. Due to the fact that our homes have been purchased by a new buyer, we should be able to verbalized concerns and have them dealt with and we should not be \"punished\" or retaliated against because of our concerns with units that we pay to live in. At this point, the retaliation has gotten so far out of control that I feel like we have no choice but to stand together and bring these concerns to the management team at Pinnacle that is off-site. \n\nWe will get in contact with the office just to be sure that we are able to form a tenant association and then we will be posting dates and times soon. For anyone interested, I have obtained contact information and will share it with whoever wants it. Just send a message here.\n\n\nThank you all and I will be in touch -"

Rats still running across my bedroom ceiling at night. Shannon from Pinnacle Management that is the company who mismanages this so called luxury building still continues to hide from me. Will not contact me in regards to the issues only responds with lame excuse on Yelp to try and make herself look good. \nResidents moving out almost constantly. \nThe I took this picture of all the mattresses piled up next to the dumpster that have been there at least the past 2 weeks. Guess they are waiting for the mattress fairy to magically take them away, since the trash people have been here twice a week and they are not in the dumpster.  One can only assume residents disposed of their mattress when they moved out or had to get rid if them because of bedbugs or something worse. \nThis place is really a disgusting place to live."

Although there were some issues caused by renovation procedure, the maintenance team had moved very fast, fixed within 5~10 mins. I think they are the best maintenance team I've ever seen in the US. Super fast and Super nice.\n\nPool&Gym are very nice and clean, I felt peaceful whenever I went there that I didn't need to go to hotel pool. 24hrs open gym is very convenient for me, working until 2~3am. \n\nAt last, I would never enjoyed my half year in prime apartment without these cool neighbor and prime apartment management team.

They were charging everyone an additional $200 for re-signing a lease, now they are charging $400 to re-sign due to everyone moving out on them. I truly believe that if the management actually cared about to tenants, than people would stay. A resident on the first floor here has been here for years, and are now moving out because they found huge holes in their walls created by rats. There were a couple rats found inside their unit in the walls. Don't just take my word for it, go ahead and yelp this place, I'm sure you'll read the review there. Also, My heater was out for a whole month this winter. My house was getting down to 66-69 degrees at night. From the very first time I put the work order in at the front desk to the third time putting a work order in I was told that my heater not working was not an urgent matter and they would get to it when they can. The heating system on these apartments are from the 70's, it's not the year that makes them old it's their performance level. In the summer time we had the same exact problem besides it was with our AC not cooling my house below 83 degrees. For the pet area it is never maintained, there is always dog waste everywhere, and there are even periods that they go without restocking the fecal bags for the dog area. It takes residents going to the office to complain; and even then nothing gets done until Noelle (the manager) feels like it's convenient for her. I don't mean to come off as a negative Nancy but you should be aware of what you are getting yourself into. Do some research on this place before moving in."

Water shut off for 3 days at a time, roaches, bed bugs, washers and dryers break down constantly and then u have to wait up to a month for a refund check of $1.25 or $1.50. Dog urine and feces throughout the bldg. A postage stamp size dog park with artificial turf that is never sanitized. U gag when u unhook ur pup from their leash. I am extremely clean and neat and paid a professional cleaner to come in and clean when I moved out. I am 100% disabled and had to leave a very small lightweight loveseat in the apt when I moved out. They charged me $200.00 to remove it to the trash. Two different people let me down that said they would remove it for me and for one reason or another that fell thru. They want me to pay the apt $200.00 to remove it. So I am not getting my deposit back and they want me to pay them $194.00!!!!!\nEven the mgr said that maintenance had commented on how clean and nice my apt was. They pay their maintenance people minimum wage and work them to death. The head of maintenance found a new job and the two that r left practically run from 1 job to another. The current head of maintenance was out of breath an sweating almost every time I saw him. There were 4 murders not even a half block. They raised some people's rent up to $400.00 and said it was due to what the other buildings in the area were commanding. Prime is right next door to Siegel Suites (they share a wall) and all day long you listen to people yelling and screaming at each and F_ck Y_u. The police r at one place or the other every day. The only good thing about Prime is the fact that u can walk toTarget and Vons for necessities. I lived in Manhattan for numerous yrs. and no longer drive. The fact that I could walk to get my groceries was great.....the gym is nice too....but the day to day quality of life simply isn't there. It is a DUMP...plain and simple. Oh yes...how could I forget the arrogance of the front desk and management. They seem to think that taking our rent money is a favor to US. They seem to forget that WE pay THEIR salaries.\nI have NEVER lived in such a deplorable place.\nOh yes the drug dealing and addicts that live here r overwhelming as r the resident and in and out hookers.\nPIG STY!!!!!!!!!!!!
